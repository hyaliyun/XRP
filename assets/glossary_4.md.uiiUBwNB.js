As compared to a flyer or a handbill, a printed brochure usually has higher-quality paper and more color, and is folded or stapled at the seam. Because the goal of a marketing brochure is typically to assist in sales or distribution of products and services, the wording in the brochure is often very positive, with \\"glowing terms\\" to describe the features and benefits being offered. It is unlikely for a marketing brochure to list major complaints customers have stated about the products, in an effort to avoid any negative aspects about those products or services. The focus is typically on persuasion, to encourage people to want to obtain the items being described in the brochure.

It is located southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. The ground control intercept (GCI) station was closed on 1 November 1983, and was re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) site as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air Support Group, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska. History Sparrevohn AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. Construction of the station began in January 1953 and was completed in October 1955. The Army Transportation Corps undertook the project. The radar station site was located on the summit of Cairn Mountain at 3,400' (top camp), PILOTNAV website: CAIRN MOUNTAIN NDB, SPARREVOHN, AK, USA. with a ground support station on a slight ridge between 1,600 and 1,800' at the base of the summit . Access to the radars was initially by a road built up the side of the mountain, later a cable tramway was built. The tramway cables were constantly breaking because of high winds and ice, and fog and the extreme cold made repairs hazardous. Ice 16 inches thick built up on the cables in winter. The station was one of the most difficult to construct, and one of the most expensive in Alaska. All supplies and equipment initially had to be disassembled then the pieces parachuted to the site by aircraft; and many times the equipment landed in wilderness instead of the cleared base site area. Bears were a hazard, and the initial construction crew had to winter over in the sub-zero environment in hastily constructed Quonset hut; working in the elements. In the spring of 1955, Army engineers constructed a 4,000 ft gravel runway airstrip adjacent to the base site, which allowed transports to bring in supplies, equipment and other material directly without the need for airdrops by parachute. The station consisted of a power/heating plant, water and fuel storage tanks, gymnasium and other support office buildings. Two other buildings contained living quarters, work areas, and recreational facilities plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The station buildings were, except for the civil engineering building connected by heated hallways. As a result, personnel stationed there, with only very few exceptions, were able to wear \\"summer\\" uniforms year round, unless they had a need to go outside during the winter season. The coverings of the station's three radar towers were heated from within to keep the covering from becoming brittle from extreme cold, and thus subject to being damaged or destroyed by high winds. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. The 719th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, activated in March 1954, operated AN/CPS-5 AN/CPS-4 AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-20A and AN/FPS-66 radars at the top site. The top site was a mini- station by itself, where twelve airmen lived; two radio maintenance, nine radar maintenance, and a cook. Later, a control room was added and a full Surveillance and Weapons Control crew lived at top camp, 5 Weapons Control officers and the Radar officer with a full complement of support troops from weapons techs to cooks. Barracks were connected between the radomes. Between the domes were other barracks rooms and the dayroom/library/kitchen/movie theater. The station operated as a long-range surveillance radar station which provided information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at King Salmon AFS where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. An AN/FYQ-9 Semiautomatic Data Processing and Display System was installed and became operational in July 1965, eliminating the need to pass track data manually. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Tatalina site was activated in 1957. It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1983, Sparrevohn received a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program. It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. No longer needed, the 719th ACWS was inactivated on l November 1983 and the station re-designated as a Long Range Radar (LRR) Site. This left only contractor personnel to maintain the site radar. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Sparrevohn LRR Site was transferred to Eleventh Air Force with the re- designation of AAC. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Demographics Sparrevohn Air Force Station appeared once on the 1980 U.S. Census as a census-designated place (CDP). With its closure in 1983, it did not appear again on the census. Current status Today very little of the former Sparrevohn Air Force Station remains. The site is controlled by the Pacific Air Forces 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf AFB. Contractor access to the site to support the FPS-117 is by the Sparrevohn LRRS Airport. It is generally unattended, A few civilian contractors access the site for maintaining the facilities. and a new ground support structure was erected on the site of the former bottom camp for storage of equipment, vehicles, and for brief overnight stays by support personnel. *Currently, the site is continuously attended by contractors to maintain the runway, power station, radar, facilities and supporting infrastructure.

Life and religion  =Work for Russian Government= Lilienthal held a doctorate from the University of Munich when Ludwig Philippson recommended him to head a school inspired by the Enlightenment in Riga, then a part of the Russian Empire. He arrived in Riga in 1840. He made a greater impact with the Minister of National Enlightenment, Sergey Uvarov, than he did with the school. The next year, Uvarov summoned Lilienthal to serve as the Ministry of National Enlightenment's \\"learned Jew.\\"Stanislawski, M. (1983). \\"Tsar Nicholas I and the Jews\\", Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 93. Lilienthal's most important task was to convince the Jews of the importance of enlightened education. Lilienthal summoned committees from the various Jewish communities in the Pale of Settlement to provide recommendations on the reform of the schools, but the notion of reform was so controversial that many boycotted. Nonetheless, Lillienthal embarked on ambitious plans for the creation of Haskalah-inspired schools in Russia. He invited his peers in Central Europe to come and teach at Russian schools. Lilienthal did not understand the degree to which the Russian Jews resented having a foreign-inspired education imposed upon them. They saw Lilienthal as an agent of the tsarist government, which they believed wanted to convert them to Russian Orthodox Christianity. As Pauline Wengeroff wrote in her memoirs decades later, \\"Dr. Lilienthal made it a point to gather many of Brest's young people around him every day, speaking to them of acquiring West European learning, offering useful bits of advice, sketching out their future as men of culture. He won the hearts of these impressionable young people who, while remaining true to their parents' religion in matters of observance, were branching off into new paths in all other respects, turning even further from the cultural orientation of the older generation.\\"Wengeroff,P. (2000). \\"Rememberings: The World of a Russian-Jewish Woman in the Nineteenth Century\\", Bethesda: University Press of Maryland, p. 74. An 1844 law which ordered the creation of schools in which young Jews would learn secular subjects as well as Jewish religion was a victory for the Lilienthal and the Jewish Haskalah, but Lilienthal left Russia shortly afterward. His motivation for the sudden exit remains a topic of debate among scholars.Stanislawski, 85. According to traditional Jewish writers, particularly in the Chabad tradition, his departure was prompted by allegations from within the Haskala movement of the misappropriation of funds, leading to a Russian governmental investigation. =In the United States= Lilienthal served as a rabbi for several years after his arrival in New York City in 1845, including at the Anshe Chesed Synagogue. He opened a Jewish school in 1850. In 1855, he moved to Cincinnati to become an editor of The American Israelite and serve as rabbi of Congregation Bene Israel. As a rabbi in Cincinnati, he promoted Reform Judaism. He wrote for several publications and was an advocate for both Jewish and secular schools, teaching at Hebrew Union College and serving on the Cincinnati board of education. Lilienthal was later an active supporter of the movement to abolish slavery in the United States, though a minority of American Jews, primarily those in the South, were themselves slaveholders and disagreed strongly with his position.Magnes Collection of Jewish Arts and Life, Max Lilienthal artifacts Personal life Lilienthal married Babette \\"Pepi\\" Nettre (born 1821), daughter of his father's friend, Isaac Nettre, the Munich agent of the international banking firm of Solomon Hirsch. Two of his siblings would also marry children of Isaac Nettre: his brother, Samuel Lilienthal, married Caroline Nettre (born 1818); and his sister Henrietta Lilienthal, married Philip Nettre. Lilienthal had eight children: Eliza Lilienthal Werner; Theodore Max Lilienthal (married to Sophie Gerstle); Albert Lilienthal; Philip N. Lilienthal; Victoria Lilienthal; Jesse Warren Lilienthal (married to Lillie Bernheimer); Esther Lilienthal Heavenrich; and Dinah Lilienthal (died in infancy).

He was killed in Milan in February 1508.  Biography  Known as Valentino's executioner, he and Cesare Borgia were thought to be close friends since childhood, going on to accompany one another during their studies at the University of Pisa. On 23 December 1499, a Don Michele de Corella and the Bishop of Trani were left in Forli as lieutenants in Cesare Borgia's army around the time of the seizure of Forli. In March, 1502, Corella was left by Cesare as his governor in Piombino. Corella was then dispatched to Pesaro with Ramiro de Lorqua under the order of Cesare Borgia in October, 1502. With his lances, on his way to Pesaro, Corella heard of the insurgence of the rebelling Fossombrone and Pergola, and ventured to those towns to sack them pitilessly as punishment. Machiavelli describes a conversation Corella had with Oliverotto da Fermo on 31 December 1502: \\"Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of their quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet the duke.\\" On the night of 31 December 1502, Vitellozzo Vitelli and Oliverotto da Fermo, who had been arrested under Cesare's command, were strangled to death, supposedly by Corella (hinted in Machiavelli's letter of 31 December). In November 1503, Michele da Corella and della Volpe had gone north with seven hundred horse to support Cesare's Romagnuoli but the group were defeated in Tuscany by the army of Gianpaolo Baglioni (Rafael Sabatini, The Life of Cesare Borgia, Chapter III: Julius II) After Micheletto Corella and della Volpe were taken prisoner in 1503, Corella was first imprisoned in Florence and then in Rome where he was questioned and tortured. However, he refused to reveal the many secrets he knew about the Borgias. He was liberated by Pope Julius II in 1505, and thanks to Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's mediation, was hired by Florence as bargello. He held this position for two years, until 1507. He was killed in Milan in 1508 by fellow countrymen, although the instigator is unknown. The Italian-English novelist and Historian Rafael Sabatini described Micheletto Corella as follows: \\"Corella was a captain of foot, a soldier of fortune, who from the earliest days of Cesare's military career had followed the duke's fortunes ‚Äì the very man who is alleged to have strangled Alfonso of Aragon by Cesare's orders. He is generally assumed to have been a Spaniard, and is commonly designated as Micheletto, or Don Miguel; but Alvisi supposes him, from his name of Corella, to have been a Venetian, and he tells us that by his fidelity to Cesare and the implicit manner in which he executed his master's orders, he earned - as is notorious- considerable hatred.\\" (Rafael Sabatini, The Life of Cesare Borgia Chapter XII: Lucrezia's Third Marriage.)

Meister has a German-Norwegian father and a mother from Sri Lanka. Meister grew up in Slependen in B√¶rum. Meister first claimed fame in the now defunct Team Aylar, which was a group of glamour models including Elita L√∂fblad and Aylar Lie. Meister became a household name when she was a Joker contestant on the Norwegian reality TV program Robinsonekspedisjonen 2007, where she placed fourth and was much mentioned in the media. Meister is most known abroad for her music single \\"My Ass\\", which was released as promotion for the horror- comedy film Dead Snow. In the music video Meister appears nude in some parts, which created a stir in media. TV Between 2008 and 2009 Meister had her own segment on the TV2 youth program Waschera, where she tried out a number of jobs to more or less success. In one episode Meister is taught how to be a stripper, which was highly publicised in Norway. Since 2010 she has her own television show on TV2 Bliss called Linni which follows her life as a glamour model. Music career Meister began singing at an early age and began choir practice at age seven. Her professional music career began in summer 2007 after her participation in Robinsonekspedisjonen 2007, when she recorded a cover of the Destiny's Child song \\"Survivor\\", which was released by C+C Records. It was panned by critics, amongst them the main Norwegian newspaper VG. The next year she recorded \\"Where My Limo At\\", an ironic song about the life in the spotlight, and in May 2009 she released the music single \\"My Ass\\", which entered the iTunes Stores list of the 100 best selling singles in Norway. \\"My Ass\\" was released in connection to the Norwegian horror-comedy film Dead Snow and the music video, where Linni appears nude, received extra attention both for Meister and the film itself. Other ventures In 2006 Meister was robbed of her private films containing pornographic material with her then-boyfriend, Big Brother contestant Kristian Hilberg. The film contains images from their trip abroad in 2006. The video was uploaded to various pornographic websites within hours of being stolen. Meister tried to make a deal with pornography producer Thomas Rocco Hansen so she could earn money for the film, but the deal never happened and the situation lead to Meister being sacked from Team Aylar.

Set beside the sea, it is one of Conakry's most famous (and most expensive) hotels. History The ocean at the hotel The hotel was constructed by the Russians. It is built block-style, and most of the rooms have a pleasant view. Although completed in April 1964, the hotel lacked essential equipment. For example, the Russians did not supply cutlery, linen or kitchen equipment. Six months later, the equipment was still missing. The building was not well finished, and when the rainstorms associated with the violent tornadoes of the area came, many problems emerged requiring costly repairs. Construction of the hotel and other projects was funded by repayable loans from the Russians, causing Guinea to fall into debt that was difficult to repay. In 1984, the military regime awarded the management contract for the 120-room Hotel Camayenne, and for the Hotel G'Bessia with 168 rooms, to the French firm Accor. By 1990, the hotel, serving a clientele of business people and aid workers, was being refurbished under a line of credit provided by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, using funding from the European Community. As of January 2011, the hotel had been closed for over five years, and required major renovations to come up to international standards. When the hotel was closed, the 105 employees were laid off. When they tried to seek compensation, demonstrating in front of the hotel, the police broke up the demonstration violently. A reporter trying to cover the negotiations with the new owner was badly beaten up. In December 2010, it was reported that the owner, Lebanese businessman Michel Chater, appeared to have finalized the purchase from the government, although the new president Professor Alpha Cond√© had said he would recover any state property that had been sold incorrectly. Chater had also taken over the grand hotel l'Unit√©, renamed Riviera Royals Hotel. Chater, CEO of the Riviera Group, said he was committed to the hotel's rehabilitation at a cost of up to US$12 million. Location and facilities The shore is rocky. However, the hotel has a small beach, a swimming pool, fitness center and tennis courts. The embassies of Saudi Arabia and Iran are both near to the hotel. The Superbobo supermarket, also near the hotel, carries imported items.

Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Caf√© du Tambourin was painted by Vincent van Gogh in 1887. Agostina Segatori owned the Caf√© du Tambourin that Van Gogh knew intimately. It was a gathering spot for Parisian artists, a place where their work was exhibited. Van Gogh, unable to pay in cash for his meals, exchanged paintings for his fare. The paintings then adorned the restaurant. He held a special exhibit of his Japanese prints in the caf√© as well. His connection with Agostina and the cafe came to a sad end when she went bankrupt and van Gogh's paintings were confiscated by creditors. This painting, however, demonstrates an artistic discovery that culminated in his unique, creative style not quite on the brink of being understood and revered. Van Gogh's influence in Paris In 1886 van Gogh left the Netherlands, never to return, for Paris and the guidance of his brother Theo. He entered Paris as a shy, somber man and while his personality would never change, he emerged artistically into what one critic described as a \\"singing bird\\". While van Gogh had been influenced by great Dutch masters, coming to Paris meant that he was influenced by Impressionists, Symbolists, Pointillists, and Japanese prints. His circle of friends included Camille Pissarro, Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Gauguin, √âmile Bernard and others. The works of Japanese artists Hiroshige and Hokusai greatly influenced van Gogh, both for the beautiful subject matter and the style of flat patterns of colors without shadow. Van Gogh explored the various influences and molded them into a style that was uniquely his own. In the years 1886 to 1888, van Gogh emerged as a sophisticated, thoughtful and provoking artist. This painting demonstrates his journey of creativity in that period. The painting In the painting Agostina, a woman in her forties, can be seen smoking a cigarette while having her second glass of beer, evidenced by two saucers under the mug of beer. In demeanor and style, such as her clothing, make-up and hairstyle, she is a modern woman. She is wearing a fashionable hat. According to the style at the time, her jacket is a different design than her dress. A parasol sits on one of the seats next to her. Van Gogh used the theme of a woman sitting at a small table, introduced by Impressionists, such as Edgar Degas and √âdouard Manet. The table and stools were in the shape of tambourines, befitting the caf√©'s theme. On the wall behind her are van Gogh's Japanese prints, which he began exhibiting at the caf√© in February 1887. Portrait of P√®re Tanguy, 1887The brightly colored painting and confident subject represent a shift in Van Gogh's attitude in comparison to his earlier subjects, such as his dark and tragic peasants. Even more, van Gogh's Portrait of P√®re Tanguy from the fall of the same year further explores his use of color and better promotes his Japanese prints. Caf√© du Tambourin Van Gogh occasionally visited Caf√© du Tambourin run by Agostina Segatori, the subject of this painting. Previously an artist's model to Manet, Corot and others, the Naples- born Agostina saved the money she earned working as a model and opened the Italian-themed Caf√© du Tambourin in 1885, which particularly catered to artists. The caf√© on the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris was just around the corner from the home that Vincent lived in with his brother Theo. Besides convenience, the restaurant was notable to Van Gogh as a venue for exhibition of his paintings, a practice initiated by artists such as Henri de Toulouse- Lautrec, Paul-Albert Besnard and others. In 1887 van Gogh had several meals a week at the caf√© which were paid in paintings to adorn the restaurant's walls. He fell in love with Agostina who was twelve years older. Soon after, though, Agostina and the establishment fell on hard times. She became ill and the business, in debt and likely involved in illegal prostitution, failed. Although assured by Agostina that van Gogh could claim his paintings, according to √âmile Bernard's recollection, debtors sold them \\"as waste canvas\\" in batches of 10, ranging in price from 50 centimes to one franc per bundle. Due to the bankruptcy of the cafe van Gogh lost not only the paintings, mostly still life works of flowers, but also the frames. Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Caf√© du Tambourin is on display at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6541 placed at Evergreen Cemetery in 1972 acknowledges Fernando De Le√≥n's contribution to Texas. Early life Fernando De Le√≥n was born in 1798 in Cruillas, Nuevo Santander (Tamaulipas), the first-born child of empresario Mart√≠n De Le√≥n and his wife Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n. Texas =De Le√≥n's Colony= On April 13, 1824, the Mexican government approved a contract allowing Mart√≠n De Le√≥n to settle forty-one Mexican families on the lower Guadalupe River. Coahuila y Tejas appointed Fernando the first commissioner and colonization manager of De Le√≥n's Colony. He employed Pl√°cido Benavides as his secretary. Mart√≠n De Le√≥n died in the 1833 cholera epidemic, and Fernando took over the role and responsibilities of his father. He established his Rancho Escondido seven miles north of town. =War against Santa Anna= When Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna revoked the 1824 Constitution of Mexico and installed his own political machine in 1833, many Tejanos were opposed to the regime. When Stephen F. Austin issued an 1835 appeal for arms to equip the Texans in the war against Santa Anna,Chance (2006) p.37 Fernando De Le√≥n, his brother-in-law Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal and Peter Kerr, began to run livestock to New Orleans to trade for munitions. During a pursuit by the Mexican warship Bravo on the return trip with the purchased equipment, the crew was forced to dump the cargo into the Gulf of Mexico. The crew of the Bravo boarded the Hannah Elizabeth, taking several prisoners.Chance (2006) p.38 Carbajal and De Le√≥n were incarcerated at Brazos Santiago, but Kerr was set free. Fernando De Le√≥n was released with payment of a bribe. Carbajal was transferred to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, with an intended transfer for imprisonment at San Juan de Ulloa. Pl√°cido Benavides bribedHardin, del laTeja (2010) p.64 the guards at Matamoros to effect an escape for Carbajal, who afterwards returned to Victoria. The three men were never recompensed for their loss. =Aide-de-camp to Governor Robinson= In February 1836, De Le√≥n was appointed as aide-de-camp to provisional Texas governor James W. Robinson. He was put in charge of the local militia. In March, following the Battle of Coleto, Mexican General Jos√© de Urrea seized Victoria and arrested De Le√≥n. Urrea forced De Le√≥n to disclose all hidden supplies and horses. Even though he had the information he wanted, Urrea kept De Le√≥n imprisoned. De Le√≥n was freed when Urrea departed Victoria, only to be arrested as a traitor by Texas Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk. In July 1836, General Rusk forced the Carbajal, Benavides and De Le√≥n families to leave Victoria. They evacuated to New Orleans, leaving behind all their possessions. De Le√≥n returned about 1844 to reclaim the family property, but did not become head of the De Le√≥n clan. Leadership of the De Le√≥n family rested with matriarch Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n. Fernando De Le√≥n did, however, manage to regain of his property.Hardin, del laTeja (2010) p.103Chance (2006) p.43 Personal life De Le√≥n married Mar√≠a Antonia Galv√°n before the start of the De Le√≥n Colony. The couple had one son who died in Louisiana. He remarried to Luz Escalera. When his brother Silvestre De Le√≥n was murdered, he adopted Silvestre's sons Martin and Francisco. Death Fernando De Le√≥n died at his home in Rancho Escondido in 1853. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Victoria, Texas.

Initially named Dah Anƒëela (; trans. Angel's Breath) and founded in 1985 by the two musicians with the guitarist Goran Vejvoda, the project was reactivated in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where Subotiƒá had moved to live in the early 1990s, with a lineup of Brazilian musicians.  History  The project Dah Anƒëela (Angel's Breath) featuring Milan Mladenoviƒá (at the time leader of the band Ekatarina Velika), Mitar Subotiƒá \\"Suba\\" and Goran Vejvoda was formed in 1985 and the three started writing material that had been performed at several concerts in Belgrade. However, due to the individual obligations of the project members, the band ceased to exist. In the early 1990s, Subotiƒá had moved to S√£o Paulo, Brazil where he continued working as a musician and a producer. During the spring of 1994, Milan Mladenoviƒá went to S√£o Paulo to join Subotiƒá in order to reactivate the Angel's Breath project, and record the material that had previously been written. The two with Brazilian musicians Fabio Golfetti (guitar), Jo√£o Parahyba (percussion), Madalena (backing vocals), Marisa Orth (backing vocals), Taciana Barros (counselor supreme) recorded the album Angel's Breath released by Imago during the same year. The album featured Subotiƒá as the album producer and keyboard player and Mladenoviƒá on lead vocals, guitar, harmonica and trumpet. The song lyrics were entirely written by Mladenoviƒá with the exception of the opening track \\"Praia Do Ventu Eternu\\", written by Taciana Barros, and as music authors appear Mladenoviƒá, Subotiƒá, Fabio Golfetti and Jo√£o Parahyba. The album cover was designed by famous comic book artist Zoran Janjetov. About the whole project Milan Mladenoviƒá had said: \\"This album represents a continuation of my work in fighting against primitivism in today's culture, which had taken its toll mostly due to the ruthless political power games, causing an overall departure from the spiritual\\". On leaving Brazil, Mladenoviƒá went to Paris in order to record a promotional video for the song \\"Crv\\" (\\"The Worm\\") and then return to Belgrade in order to reactivate his own band Ekatarina Velika. However, the day after the August 24, 1994, performance in Budva at the Pjesma Mediterana festival, Mladenoviƒá was held in a hospital, and it was soon discovered that he had pancreatic cancer. A few months later, on November 5, 1994, Milan Mladenoviƒá died in Belgrade at the age of 36. Subotiƒá, continued working in Brazil and released a solo album S√£o Paulo Confessions, but a few days after its release, on November 2, 1999, he died in the fire that had caught his studio. Legacy The lyrics of the song \\"Crv\\" were featured in Petar Janjatoviƒá's book Pesme bratstva, detinjstva & potomstva: Antologija ex YU rok poezije 1967 - 2007 (Songs of Brotherhood, Childhood & Offspring: Anthology of Ex YU Rock Poetry 1967 - 2007).

The cafe is located on Hanover Street in the city's Little Italy. The cafe features four levels, three liquor bars, and a cigar room. History Caff√® Vittoria was established in 1929 as the first Italian cafe in Boston. It is located in the North End, the center of Boston's Italian population. In 1995, the owners opened a cigar bar in the basement called Stanza dei Sigari (English: Cigar Room). As of 2014, Stanza dei Sigari is the last surviving smoking lounge in the city of Boston.http://www.universalhub.com/2014/boston-down-just-single-cigar-bar According to a few food review sources, Caff√® Vittoria has some of the best hot chocolate and cappuccino in the United States. Many celebrities and politicians frequent the North End hotspot for \\"Boston's best cappuccino and cannoli\\". On March 13, 2013, Caff√® Vittoria was featured in an episode of the television show Syfy's Haunted Collector. They interviewed the owners' son, David Riccio Jr., who submitted a video stating how some of his employees and customers were scared to be in the cigar bar due to paranormal activity. In the episode, John Zaffis and his team investigated the establishment, and discovered that the property at 292 Hanover Street once housed a baby farm. This particular baby farm was run by a woman named Ms. Elwood, who apparently abused and even killed some of the infants that were left there. The team also discovered a syringe from the 1870s buried within the building's foundation. After they removed the syringe from the property, the paranormal activity in the building ceased. The Boston Herald also dedicated its cover page to the story. Menu Caff√® Vittoria serves a variety of Italian delicacies, such as cannoli, tiramisu, and biscotti. They also have gelato, Italian-style ice cream with flavors such as spumoni and Biscuit Tortoni. The cafe serves sorbets in the summertime. Other desserts include rum cake and chocolate ganache.

Aspiring to become a master shipbuilder he joined the Construction Committee early in 1748, and from 1752 spent over four years along with lieutenant F M KrabbeTops√∏e-Jensen, vol. 2, pages 25‚Äì27 studying methods of design and construction in England, France, Italy and Holland. Together, on their return to Denmark, the two young officers designed a Xebec and were to have started on a frigate but Kaas, having already had his first command in 1756 as captain of the frigate Hvide √òrn, was posted to the ship-of-the-line Neptunus and never continued his shipbuilding career. During this time Kaas was promoted twice (to senior lieutenant in October 1753 and to captain-lieutenant in 1755). While Neptunus was in the Mediterranean both captain and second-in-command of the accompanying ship-of-the-line Island fell ill and died, so Kaas was appointed captain of Island and brought her back to Denmark in 1758. Confirmed in the rank of captain in December 1758, Kaas had command of various frigates (including Christiansborg, Falster and S√∏ridderen) over the next eight years, seeing service in the Baltic and Mediterranean and undertaking a diplomatic mission to Morocco in 1763 with the frigate Havfruen. A quarantine period for the ship returning from Salee, Morocco was applied when Havfruen stopped at Lisbon. In 1765 he led another mission to Morocco using an armed merchant ship specifically flying the danish royal standard. On return, in the spring of 1766, he was granted three month's special leave to order his personal affairs. 1767 Commander and in 1769 he became captain of the ship-of-the-line Mars. In this ship he carried the British Duchess of Gloucester from Copenhagen, where she had been visiting her sister, Queen Caroline Mathilde, to Mecklenburg in Pommerania.

It is alongside the Tambo River on the Great Alpine Road, north-east of Bairnsdale, surrounded by state forest. At the , Tambo Crossing had a nominal population. History Prior to European settlement, Tambo Crossing was part of the region occupied by the Brabuwooloong people of the Gunai nation. The Aborigines called the place Neoyang or Noyang, meaning conger eel. The first Europeans known to pass through Tambo Crossing was the party of Walter Mitchell in April 1839, following an existing Aboriginal travel route to the mountains. The name Tambo Crossing was probably given by the party led by Angus McMillan in January 1840; the name is descriptive, as it is the location where the route (now the Great Alpine Road) formerly crossed the Tambo River. This name is somewhat archaic, as the Great Alpine Road no longer crosses the Tambo River at Tambo Crossing, now travelling west of the river until Ensay. =European settlement= During the 1840s, as the area developed and traffic on the route increased, Tambo Crossing became a regular stopping point at almost exactly halfway between Bairnsdale and Omeo. It is thought that a massacre of 70 Gunaikurnai people recorded by Chief Protector of Aborigines George Augustus Robinson as occurring at a place called Shady Creek in the 1840s actually happened at Tambo Crossing. Looking south on the Great Alpine Road to the settlement at Tambo Crossing; at image centre, to the right of the road, is the site of the former hotel A hotel was established at Tambo Crossing on the east side of the river in this period, first being officially licensed in 1849 with the name of The Tambo Inn. In 1854 Duncan McDougall took over the inn, as well as establishing a store at the same location. As an indication of the Scottish background of many of the early settlers in the region, the hotel was renamed the Sir Walter Scott Hotel in the late 1860s. In 1890 a new hotel was built on the western side of the river beside the newly aligned road between Bruthen and Ensay, but kept the \\"Sir Walter Scott\\" name. The hotel burnt down on 8 September 1961 and was not rebuilt. The current information board is on the site of the former hotel, with the Great Alpine Road also passing over part of the site. In 1850 of land around Tambo Crossing was developed as grazing country. It was licensed for 4,000 sheep, and was called the Neoyang Run in reference to the Aboriginal name for Tambo Crossing. Later, as well as the hotel and store, the settlement was large enough to have the small State school No. 3160, and a cheese factory. The school closed in 1971, and was amalgamated with Ensay Primary School. The school building doubled as the public hall, and still stands about west of the information board. During the later part of the 19th century the area was part of the Victorian gold rushes. Significant finds were made at Stirling, northwest, with a smaller alluvial field at Shady Creek, west. In the early 1880s noted geologist and naturalist Alfred William Howitt mapped the area, with his paper, The Rocks of Noyang, being read to the Royal Society of Victoria in 1883. Present day Current minor bridge crossing over the Tambo River at Tambo Crossing With the improved road and means of transportation, Tambo Crossing lost its importance as a stopping point along the highway, a problem exacerbated with the loss of the Sir Walter Scott Hotel in 1961. Additionally, improved technology led to bigger farms, and therefore fewer residents in the area. Tambo Crossing today therefore contains some prime agricultural land for livestock, however consists of only a few individual properties and a small number of residents. The centre of the settlement in present times contains the information board and a commemorative plaque on the site of the former hotel. The former school building is now in private ownership. The original crossing of the Tambo River, in historical times a ford, is now a low-level bridge on a minor dirt side road, about to the southeast of the information board. The folk art sculpture Mr. Stringy is located about north of Tambo Crossing alongside the Great Alpine Road. =Bushfires= Tambo Crossing and the surrounding bushland was threatened and severely impacted by the Eastern Victoria Great Divide bushfires in January 2007. Severe bushfire conditions on 11 January caused the fires to enter private property from the state forest, and quickly burn across private land. Losses included livestock, non-residential buildings and an unoccupied house, and large sections of fencing. Tambo Crossing was again impacted by bushfires in December 2019. The community regrouped and alcohol saved the day...

It was built in 1894 for the Queen Street Manufacturing Company. It closed on 12 March 1982 and was mothballed, but was subsequently taken over by Burnley Borough Council and maintained as a museum. In the 1990s ownership passed to Lancashire Museums. Unique in being the world's only surviving operational steam-driven weaving shed, it received an Engineering Heritage Award in November 2010. Previously open to visitors and offering weaving demonstrations, the museum closed in September 2016 (except for pre-booked school parties). In April 2018 Lancashire County Council announced that the museum, along with Helmshore Mills Textile Museum and the Judges Lodgings in Lancaster, would reopen three days a week.  Location  Queen Street Mill is a former working mill that lies within Harle Syke. It is a suburb of Burnley, an industrial town in the North West of the United Kingdom. Harle Syke is approximately 4 km from Burnley town centre and a part of the civil parish of Briercliffe with Extwistle. It is north of Manchester and east of Preston, two other former large industrial towns that were significant during the industrial revolution. Harle Syke is on high ground to the south of the River Calder near the M65. The hamlet was built on grid-iron layout and housed seven cotton mills, or weaving sheds.  History  The Queen Street Mill Manufacturing Company was established in 1894, capitalised with ¬£20,000 in ¬£5 shares. The first board of directors was listed as Brierley Edmondson (weaver), William Kippax (weaver), George Lane (builder), John Nuttall (glazer), Thomas Pickles (foreman), John Taylor (weaver), Whitaker Whitaker (weaver), and James Corrin (Headteacher, Haggate School) who became the first company secretary. The company built the Queen Street Mill between 1894 and 1895. As money was scarce only one Lancashire boiler was installed, and it was six years before the second was bought. The weaving shed was single storey, and the mill frontage was three storey. All the looms were bought from Burnley companies, Pemberton & Co. and Harling & Todd Ltd., and have not been replaced. The mill was originally equipped with 900 single shuttle Lancashire looms capable of producing grey cloth. When this was not enough, the company installed a further 366 looms at Primrose Mill, Harle Syke which was the room and power mill immediately adjacent but slightly downhill. To the workers it was known as the bottom shed. The completed cloth was taken by horse and cart and train to finishers for bleaching and dyeing. Around 1910, the hauliers, ex-employees of the mill invested in two steam driven flat bed lorries. These were impounded in 1915 for war work, and horses briefly returned. In April 1913 quotes were sought from William Roberts & Co of Nelson to upgrade the engine, which mainly included replacing the slide-valve cylinders with more efficient Corliss valve cylinders. This work was carried out during the following Wakes Week. The financial structure of the company inhibited change, and the original equipment was not improved again or replaced but the company continued to weave when other firms had closed. Mains electricity was only introduced in 1947. In November 2015 Lancashire County Council announced it planned to cease its funding of the museum and shut to the public from 1 April 2016. In March 2016 the museum was granted a six-month reprieve and remained open to the public until 30 September 2016 under the Council. In April 2018 it was announced it would reopen Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from July 7 until 28 October 2018 and between Easter and the end of October 2019. = Harle Syke Strike, 1915 = Weavers were paid by piecework; a good four-loom weaver was paid 24 shillings a week, only slightly less than the tackler. Harle Syke workers had always been paid slightly below the list, which management explained as being due to the carriage costs to Burnley. In August 1915 there was a strike that lasted for several weeks triggered by this injustice. Many workers were also shareholders and took a dividend from the profits of the mill, so they refused to join the strike. Leaflets were printed by the Weavers' Union accusing them of scabbing and being \\"Knobsticks\\". The issue was resolved in December 1915 when the War Bonus came into effect and weavers were persuaded to see this as the rise they had been seeking. Cotton Control was introduced in 1918, which led to a four-day working week. = Fire, 1918 = A serious fire occurred in October 1918. The fire did not affect the boilers or the engine, and the mill was fully operational again 10 days after the incident. However, the mill front was damaged, and was subsequently rebuilt, though as a single-storey building. During the rebuilding, the mill looms were relocated to the bottom shed. As forementioned, Prudence the engine, was undamaged in the fire and was renamed Peace, in respect for the fallen soldiers of the First World War. = Museum, 1983 = By early 1982 the mill was only operating 440 looms and was no longer financially viable. It finally closed on 12 March 1982, and the mill was mothballed. The mill was rescued by Burnley Borough Council in 1983. It was reopened in April 1986 as a working textile museum. It passed to Lancashire County Council's Museums Service who carried out major refurbishments assisted by English Heritage, the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the European Regional Development Fund. It re- opened again in 1997. The mill again produced cloth as a result of the demonstrations, and the machinery is deemed a collection of national importance. Exhibits In addition to the original machines, Lancashire Museums also display other textile machines they own or are restoring, and weave some specialist commissions. One of the commissions is a blue and white shirting that is sold exclusively to 'Old Town' of Holt, Norfolk, who produce Victorian workware. Another is weaving woollen Jewish prayer shawls. There is a large Hattersley Standard Loom, and a treadle operated Hattersley Domestic Loom. There is a Sulzer, and a Saurer telescopic rapier loom that operates at 180 picks per minute. There is a collection of shuttles and machines used to make and maintain them. Also, there are machines for making reeds and healds. Closure In November 2015 the Labour-controlled Lancashire County Council announced the withdrawal of funding from five of its museums: Fleetwood Museum, Helmshore Mills Textile Museum, Judges' Lodgings, Museum of Lancashire and Queen Street Mill because of what the leader of the council described as \\"the financial challenges facing the county council as we deal with relentless cuts to central government funding combined with rising demand for our services\\". They were initially to close at the end of March 2016 but that month were reprieved until September 2016. The museum closed on 30 September 2016, along with the other four Lancashire museums mentioned above, except for pre-booked school groups. In October 2016 Lancashire County Council's website stated that \\"There has been an expression of interest from a potential new operator\\"; it stated that \\"Negotiations are underway to identify a new operator\\". In April 2018 it was announced it would reopen on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from July 7 until 28 October 2018 and between Easter and the end of October 2019. = Architecture = The mill was of four-storey construction, with a large single-storey weaving shed. After the fire in 1918 it was remodelled into a single-storey building, space being taken from the weaving sheds for a new preparation area. On closure in 1982 it was reconfigured by Burnley Council, the weaving shed was partitioned, about a third being used for rentable industrial units, and a similar area being used for visitor facilities. The chimney and the 60 m x 25 m lodge lay to the south. The boiler house, the engine house and chimney are scheduled monuments. The whole site was granted Grade 1 listed status in 2013 giving protection to the rest of the building. As originally built the weaving shed was about by , with the typical north facing roof lights (windows) giving natural light, the shed housed 990 looms. On the Queen Street side was the boiler room and engine house, and the four-storey warehouse. The ground floor was the weft department, the first floor was offices, the cloth warehouse and temporary storage beams, the second floor was the winding and beaming department for beaming and drawing in, and the third floor was the preparation department for tape sizing. After the fire the ground floor of the frontage was rebuilt and used for winding and preparation, 100 looms were removed, and part of the Harrison Street end of the shed became the new warehouse. Rowland Kippax who worked there however reported \\"there were now 1040 looms, there were nine tacklers looking after 130 looms each\\". thumb = Power = Steam is raised by two Lancashire boilers built by Tinker, Shenton & Co, Hyde. The first was installed in 1894, and the second in 1901, when a 120-tube Greens Economiser was fitted.Date uncertain, the current Economiser dates from 1934. Feed water is now supplied by a Weir pump fitted in 1956. Both boilers were stoked manually, until secondhand Proctor automatic stokers were fitted in 1962. Boiler No.1 had the Shovel type and the coking type was fitted to No.2; the manually stoked 1901 boiler is the only one used today. Coal was obtained locally from Bank Hall Pit but now with pollution controls being stricter it has to be imported. At its peak it burnt 6 tonnes a day, but now uses only 10 tonnes a month. The steam raised to 100 psi in the boiler house, drives the original tandem compound horizontal stationary steam engine. The high-pressure cylinder (HP) is and the low-pressure (LP) . It uses Corliss valves. The engine drives a flywheel running at 68 rpm. The engine was built and installed by William Roberts of Nelson in 1895. It has never been moved from this location and runs perfectly true. Power is taken from the crankshaft by a series of directly driven line shafts. Currently the mill uses coal bought from the United States and Russia.

File:QSMM Starting.ogv Peace starting up = Equipment = The mill is particularly notable for its completeness. When yarn enters a weaving mill, it is on different size cops and cheeses, and these had to be wound onto pirns to fit in the shuttles used by the looms installed. The equipment is here and used. For the weft, there are two remaining banks of pirn winders manned by one operative. The warp needs to be taken from a 300 bobbins on V-shaped frame and wound onto a beam. Four or five beams are merged to make the 2000 end beam that is needed, and they are placed in the Cylinder Tape Sizing Machine (made in 1919 by Howard & Bullough Ltd. of Accrington). The threads pass through the size to stiffen them and reduce friction. The size is a mixture of flour soft soap and tallow: specific to this mill. They are dried over steam-heated cylinders and wound onto the final beam, the weavers beam. The weavers beam is now placed on the Drawing-in frame. Here each end is passed through the healds, and then through a reed. This job was done by a reacher-in and a loomer. The reacher-in, who would be young and usually a boy, passed each end in order to the loomer. The mill still has two Drawing in frames. Alternatively, if the loom had already run that cloth, a short length of warp thread could be left on the healds and reed, and a Barber-Colman knotter could tie in warp threads to the new beam. This process took 20 minutes, considerably faster than starting afresh. Spare healds and reeds are stored above head height for that purpose. The loomed weavers beam would be taken into the weaving shed. One weaver would tenter 6, or 8 Lancashire Looms, which would be kept working by a tackler. Today there are 308 looms from 1894 built by Pemberton, or Harling & Todd of Burnley. These would require 65‚Äì80 weavers and 3 tacklers. At its peak there were 990 looms, all driven by overhead line shafts.

The museum was also used to portray the Milton steam mill in the BBC series North & South, featured in Life on Mars and most recently appeared in the 2015 BBC adaption of An Inspector Calls. Queen Street has also featured in a variety of documentaries including Channel 4's 2014 series Hidden Villages presented by Penelope Keith.

Most scaloposaurs, including Scaloposaurus and Regisaurus, are now classified in various positions within Bauroidea. Many therocephalians once classified as scaloposaurians are now considered basal baurioids.

Sexual harassment encompasses a range of behavior from mild annoyances to sexual assault and rape.Dzeich, Billie Wright and Linda Weiner (1990). The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus, University of Illinois Press.Drawing the Line: Sexual Harassment on Campus (2006), the American Association of University Women As committed by teachers, it is often framed as \\"sex for grades\\" and has attracted media attention throughout the world, partly in connection with the #MeToo movement. United States In the United States, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.ed.gov Germany The Universit√§t Bremen was the first university in Germany to establish, in 1992, a contact point for matters regarding sexual harassment. It is generally considered that the power difference between university students and professors, who determine grades and can offer or prolong employment positions for PhD students, results in a risk of harassment. According to a non- representative survey of 12,663 students in 2012, every fourth student reported some form of sexual harassment, and about ten percent of those cases involved harassment by teachers. Concerned students who do not want to report misbehaviour for fear of career repercussions are given advice as to how to handle the situation. For example, a doctoral student may be advised to add an external evaluator to assess their work or to request that they be assigned a different advisor. In the mid-2010s, allegations of sexual harassment were raised against teachers in institutions of higher education in Hamburg, D√ºsseldorf and Munich. Ghana and Nigeria BBC Africa Eye performed a year- long investigation into sexual harassment committed by university teachers in Ghana. Four academics were secretly filmed as part of the investigation. It involved undercover reporters posing as students at the University of Ghana and the University of Lagos. The resulting documentary was broadcast in October 2019, exposing the misconduct. The African Feminist Initiative released a solidarity statement condemning the harassment in an institution that should offer a safe environment for learning. Two academics were suspended from the University of Ghana for six months and four months, respectively, without salary. They were to undergo training about the university's sexual harassment and misconduct policy, to resume work only after a positive assessment, and to undergo an annual assessment for five years. Some have criticized the punishment as too lenient. In 2020, Nigeria's Senate initiated the debate of a bill aiming to prevent the sexual harassment of university students.

Douglas. It describes his childhood and early adult life, ending with his appointment to the Court in 1939 at age 40. The title, a play on the famous American expression \\"Go West, young man\\", alludes to Douglas's upbringing in the Western United States ‚Äì being uprooted often, eventually landing in Yakima, Washington ‚Äì followed by his legal education and professional success in the Eastern United States. It was published by Random House in April 1974 and is 493 pages long. The work showcases a passion for the natural world and includes vivid descriptions of a young Douglas's time in the Western mountains, including such tales as spending a defenseless night with a friend on an isolated spit of land, convinced that a screeching cougar nearby was about to do away with both of them.Douglas, Go East Young Man, pp. 189‚Äì191. While not covering Douglas's tenure on the court, the book does not shy away from expressing his opinions on matters political or otherwise. He also criticizes personal aspects of people by name, including John Foster Dulles. In preparation for the work, Douglas said he had spent time researching records of his family's past and visiting ancestral and familial locations in Nova Scotia and Minnesota. Upon publication, Christopher Lehmann- Haupt of The New York Times found the book to be \\"a peculiar kind of autobiography\\" that, while capturing the nature of its author, is characterized by \\"a disjointedness between one paragraph and the next that [...] makes the book read as if it was the transcript of an interview with all the questions expunged\\". Nat Hentoff, writing for The New York Times Book Review, viewed Go East, Young Man much more favorably, saying his writing both here and in his Court opinions features a high level of quality, wit, and persuasiveness, and that \\"he makes this book so continually arresting that it reads like the kind of novel one wishes would not end.\\" Jim Dinsmore of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote that \\"Justice William O. Douglas has usually been a maverick and is part of an American tradition, which, in contrast to conformity, extols the virtues of individuality and diversity\\" and called the memoir \\"a major testament of our time.\\" Cover of the paperback edition Go East, Young Man spent six weeks on The New York Times Best Seller List. It was published in a paperback edition by Dell's Delta Books division later in 1974, at the same length of 493 pages.Inspection of title page and last page in a physical copy of the paperback edition. The work was framed as the first part of the Autobiography of William O. Douglas, with the second part, The Court Years, 1939 to 1975, being published in 1980 after the author's death. Legal commentator Jeffrey Rosen later wrote that \\"the norms for judicial memoirs were shattered\\" by the two volumes and their openness towards expressing strong political viewpoints and criticizing others. Scholar Bruce Allen Murphy published a heavily-researched biography of Douglas in 2003, Wild Bill: The Legend and Life of William O. Douglas. In it, he wrote that Douglas had long falsified much of his early life, including the nature of his childhood illness, the economic suffering of his family, his military service during World War I, and his performance at Columbia Law School. James Ryerson, writing for The New York Times Book Review, accepted Murphy's conclusions and stated that, \\"In his 1974 autobiography, Go East, Young Man, [Douglas] repeated many of these outright lies, introduced new ones and liberally embellished other key details of his life story.\\" However, another scholar working on a Douglas biography, David J. Danelski, as well as some of Douglas's past associates, said that while Douglas may have exaggerated at times, Murphy's biography had not proven the worst such incidences.

Early life Henry Garnet Forrest was born on 5 December 1895 in Brunswick, Melbourne, Australia. His father was Robert Forrest; he signed the enlistment papers granting permission for his son's enlistment. The younger Forrest was working as a cook when he enlisted on 19 February 1915, and swore he was a British subject. First World War =Infantry service= Forrest originally served as a Quartermaster Sergeant with the Australian Imperial Force's 23rd Infantry Battalion. He sailed from Australia on HMAT Euripides on 10 May 1915. After some time spent in Egypt, the 23rd Battalion shipped out to Gallipoli, whence it landed on the night of 4‚Äì5 September 1915. After his return from Gallipoli to Egypt, Forrest was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 46th Battalion on 12 March 1916. He shipped out for service on the Western Front on 2 June 1916. Forrest led a daring trench raid in the Hollandscheschuur salient in September 1916; this gained him a mention in despatches and the Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor. =Aerial service= During Bloody April 1917, Forrest transferred to the Australian Flying Corps. On 26 May he was given permission to wear his Italian Silver Medal of Military Valor. He served successively in No. 32 Squadron and No. 43 Squadron of the RFC until he was wounded in action on 6 August 1917 and removed from combat. In November 1917, he would return to combat as a Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a pilot in No. 2 Squadron AFC. On 22 February 1918, Forrest was promoted to captain. Forrest began his string of aerial victories on 22 March 1918, when he drove down a German two-seater reconnaissance aircraft out of control, followed by the destruction of two Albatros D.V fighters over Bullecourt. The next day, he set a German reconnaissance aircraft afire northeast of Bapaume. A week later, he drove down another over Le Quesnel to become an ace.Shores, et al, p. 158. On 2 April 1918, he and Roby Lewis Manuel destroyed a German reconnaissance aircraft southeast of Demuin. On the 12th, he destroyed one singlehanded over Vieille-Chapelle. On 9 May, he sent down a DFW reconnaissance aircraft out of control. On 1 June 1918, he destroyed a Fokker Triplane fighter over Chuignes. The following day, in two morning dogfights, he sent a Pfalz D.III out of control near Estr√©es, and another over Albert. His final tally amounted to six enemy aircraft destroyed, including the one shared with Manuel, and five more driven down out of control. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 2 July 1918. He was also returned to Home Establishment in England during July. His DFC was gazetted on 3 August 1918. Its citation read: He was admitted to Cobham Hall on 5 September 1918. He was sent home sick on HT Marathon, departing England on 6 November and arriving back in Melbourne on New Year's Day 1919. Post-war life Forrest was discharged from the AFC on 23 February 1919. On 16 March 1920, he was one of the returned military veterans honoured by the Order of Druids at a banquet; he was granted a certificate in recognition of his service. Forrest is noted in newspaper notes of social and sporting events in the Broken Hill area throughout the 1920s‚Äì40s; he served as secretary of the local tennis club, for instance. On 30 December 1947, he is noted as a pallbearer at a friend's funeral. Henry Garnet Forrest died on 3 December 1945 at the Repatriation Hospital, Caulfield, aged 49.

He recorded it and released it the same year under his own label for the 1965 Christmas season, with little success.

At the outbreak of the Libyan Civil War, Nabbous was the founder of Libya Alhurra TV, the first independent broadcast news organization since Gaddafi took power in Libya. Libya Alhurra TV was established in Benghazi, Libya on 19 February 2011 and started broadcasting online when Nabbous established a two-way satellite connection in the wake of a complete Internet blackout imposed by the Gaddafi government after the 17 February protests. Nabbous was shot by a sniper and killed on 19 March 2011 while reporting on attempts by government forces to fight revolutionaries and attack civilians in Benghazi. Hours after the death of Nabbous, international coalition airplanes entered Libyan airspace to enforce a no-fly zone authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. In the last weeks of his life, Nabbous focused on bringing international attention to the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Libya. His death was widely reported by CNN and various media outlets. Prior to the establishment of Libya Alhurra TV, Nabbous operated a number of businesses in Benghazi city. Background Born in Benghazi in 1983, Nabbous graduated from Garyounis University, with a degree in Mathematics. A member of Nabbous' family, aged 17, was cited as one of the first casualties of the 17 February protests in Benghazi. Nabbous' wife, Samra Naas, was pregnant with the couple's first child at the time of his death. On 2 June 2011, Naas gave birth to a baby girl who was given the name Mayar \\"Maya\\" Nabbous. In an interview with Canal+ France on February 26, 2011 Nabbous said he was running a wireless ISP business in Benghazi in the 2000s with five WLAN access points, but was forced out of the business by competition from government sponsored broadband services using ADSL and Wimax technologies. Work in media NPR social media strategist Andy Carvin called Nabbous \\"the face of Libyan citizen journalism;\\" Nabbous was the primary contact of many international media outlets looking for information regarding the situation in Libya. Nabbous founded and ran the Internet division of Libya Alhurra TV. Der Spiegel reporter Clemens H√∂ges called Nabbous \\"the man who just might be the most important person in the revolution.\\" Libya Alhurra TV was the only broadcast coming out of Benghazi when Muammar Gaddafi shut down Internet lines when the Libyan Civil War began. =Work with Libya Alhurra TV= Libya Alhurra TV included nine cameras streaming 24 hours a day since the channel's creation on 17 February. As Libya Alhurra TV's communications became more sophisticated, Nabbous was able to take cameras with him to different parts of Benghazi in order to capture the destruction and carnage caused by mortars and shelling up-close. Over the last few days and hours of his life, Nabbous continued reporting. Streaming over Libya Alhurra TV, Nabbous was able to share live video and provide commentary regarding the bombing of a Benghazi power station and a fuel tank explosion on 17 March, the firing of missiles on Benghazi from nearby city Sultan on 18 March, the attacks on civilians and consequent destruction in the morning of 19 March, and the death of two young victims: 4 month-old and 5 year-old children killed in their bedroom by a missile launched in the morning of 19 March. These images and reports were broadcast over the Internet, and later rebroadcast by international media outlets such as Al Jazeera English. Death Nabbous was killed while reporting on the claims of a cease-fire made by the Gaddafi government in response to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. Nabbous was allegedly shot in the head by a sniper soon after covering the Gaddafi's government cease-fire declaration; sitting in the back of a truck, he was using a mobile phone to record audio of the then-ongoing violence, and the audio recording cut off at the estimated time of the shooting. Nabbous was in critical condition until he died around 3 p.m. CET. Nabbous' wife announced his death in a video on Libya Alhurra TV. =Reactions= News of Nabbous' death elicited reactions from members of journalistic organizations and personalities: * \\"He touched the hearts of many with his bravery and indomitable spirit. He will be dearly missed and leaves behind his young wife and unborn child\\", said Sharon Lynch, Libya Alhurra TV station representative and colleague of Nabbous. * Bilal Randeree, journalist for Al Jazeera * Don Lemon, CNN reporter who interviewed Nabbous on 19 February and Arwa Damon, CNN correspondent based in Benghazi, paid tribute to Nabbous on 20 March. He was billed as a CNN contributor, and had interviewed Ben Wedeman on 26 February. * Ben Wedeman, CNN reporter tweeted on 19 March: \\"Mohammed Nabbous was one of the courageous voices from Benghazi broadcasting to the world from the beginning. Smart, selfless, brave.\\" * Andy Carvin, NPR's senior product manager for online communities: \\"[A]ll of a sudden, as Benghazi was trying to free itself from Gadhafi, you started hearing voices coming over the Internet and one of those first voices to come out was Mo\\"...Nabbous, Andy says, used Libya Alhurra TV to become \\"their local equivalent of Radio Free Europe or Voice of America, where he was trying to get the world to hear their point of view of what was going on. And as he did that, he basically became a reporter or even an anchor.\\" * UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova: \\"I condemn the killing of Mohammed al-Nabbous [sic], who was killed while fulfilling his professional duty of informing citizens about the dramatic events taking place in Libya\\". * Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) Abdel Dayem: \\"We send our condolences to the family and friends of our colleague Mohammad al-Nabbous [sic].\\" * International Press Institute (IPI) Press Freedom Manager Anthony Mills: \\"Our condolences go out to the wife, family, and colleagues of Mohammed al-Nabous [sic].\\"http://www.freemedia.at/singleview/5396/ Legacy Nabbous was perceived as the face and voice of the Libyan revolution and was one of the first people to be interviewed by western journalists soon after Benghazi was liberated by Libyan opposition forces. The Guardian described Nabbous as the \\"face of citizen journalism\\" in Libya. In December, 2011, the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University posthumously awarded Mohammed Nabbous the Louis Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism. The award was given to Nabbous' wife, Samra, at a ceremony at the Lippmann House in Cambridge on December 1, 2011.

Many artists including Elvis Presley (1966), Andy Williams, Tony Bennett, Herb Alpert, and Roger Williams covered it, and it was also performed by Tommy Sands in the 1968 Hawaii Five-O episode \\"No Blue Skies\\". Perhaps the most famous version was by his friend Don Ho, who was an aspiring singer at Honey's Nightclub, where Lee worked as a doorman and which was owned by Don Ho's mother.Enomoto, Catherine Kekoa. \\"Kui Lee: 'One of the all-time geniuses of Hawaii.'\\" Honolulu Star-Bulletin. May 15, 1997 Frank Sinatra's daughter, Nancy Sinatra, visited 'Honey's' with friends. Hearing Don Ho perform and watching his ease with the patrons of the club, she reported Don's uniqueness to her father who had just started his own record label. Don Ho and his musicians recorded their first 45rpm for Reprise Records the following year; \\"Tiny Bubbles\\" and \\"I'll Remember You\\" on the flip side. Several years later, Don Ho was performing in Waikiki as the headliner of Duke's in the International Market Place. Don performed twice nightly (though there were times he didn't leave the stage). His \\"Suck 'em Up\\" (late show) was often standing room only. Many musicians who knocked off their hotel lounge gigs by midnight, would drop in to perform. It was the hottest entertainment at the best prices in town, and often went on long after the club was scheduled to close. Hawaii was a staging ground for the Vietnam War, for many U.S. military personnel. As such it was the last U.S. soil many personnel left, and the first when returning home. The United States military afforded combat-duty personnel a two-week leave in mid-tour. Often the military allowed Military Air Command flights for both husband and wife to meet. Their most popular stay was at the Hale Koa Hotel in the heart of Ft. Derussy, a relatively short walk from the International Market Place. The lure of Hawaii's best entertainers and all one could drink for $5, made Duke's legendary. Don often closed the \\"Suck 'em Up\\" show by performing the song \\"I'll Remember You\\". For those service personnel about to be sent back into war and their wives soon to be thousands of miles away, this song resonated with many. Elvis Presley had an affinity for the Islands and gave the song a broader audience. An insert in a mid-1960s movie, it was a stunning benefit concert in Honolulu six years later, Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite, that catapulted the song's popularity. Within the next few years, the song had been recorded by several well-known singers of the period. Kui Lee was a prolific composer, writing many songs popular in Hawaii. Knowing of a late- diagnosed terminal illness, this song was written/dedicated to his wife and three young daughters. Kui passed within a couple years of penning \\"I'll Remember You\\".

It was one of only two songs, the other being \\"I Have But One Goal\\", which the group recorded between 1953 and 1956. Elvis Presley recorded the song at RCA Studios on October 30, 1960 and it appears on the album His Hand in Mine. Jimmy Blackwood was lead singer of the Blackwoods, but it was Jake Hess, lead for the Statesmen, who was a major influence on Elvis. The version recorded by Elvis is slow, in the key of B Major and progresses from B to E major, to C# 7 to F#7. Biblical reference The spiritual song makes reference to the King James Version of the Bible in John 14:2 which says \\"In my Father's house are many mansions: if [it were] not [so], I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.\\" The song refers to how \\"In My Father's House are many mansions\\" and how God is preparing a mansion in heaven. It also refers to how Jesus died on the cross to \\"bear my sorrow\\" and \\"so souls like you may have new life\\". Aileen Hanks, a blind singer, composed the lyrics and music of this gospel song introduced by the Blackwood Brothers Quartet and later rearranged and recorded by Elvis Presley. Elvis was said to be particularly fond of playing hymns on his gilded piano in Graceland's Music Room, \\"talking about home as heaven and the mansion as a mark of God's favor.\\" References Elvis Presley songs Year of song unknown Gospel songs Songwriter unknown ","title":"In My Father's House (song)"},{"id":"31230812","text":"Sparrevohn LRRS Airport is a military airstrip located south of Sparrevohn, in the Bethel Census Area of the U.S. state of Alaska.

Mod music file format  Starting from 1987 with the release of Soundtracker, trackers became a new type of music programs which spawned the mod (module) audio file standard. The Mod audio standard is considered the audio format that started it all in the world of computer music. After Soundtracker many clones (which often were reverse engineered and improved) appeared, including Noisetracker, Startrekker, Protracker. Also many derivatives appeared, including OctaMED and Oktalyzer. In the period from 1985 to 1995 when Amiga audio (which was standard in Amiga computers) was of greater quality than other standard home computers, PC compatible systems began to be equipped with 8-bit audio cards inserted into 16-bit ISA bus slots. Soundtracker Module files were used on PC computers and were considered the only serious 8-bit audio standard for creating music. The worldwide usage of these programs led to the creation of the so-called MOD- scene which was considered part of the demoscene. Eventually the PC world evolved to 16-bit audio cards, and Mod files were slowly abandoned. Various Amiga and PC games (such as Worms) supported Mod as their internal standard for generating music and audio effects. Some trackers can use both sampled sounds and can synthesize sounds. AHX and Hively Tracker are special trackers in that they can't use samples, but can synthesize the sound created by Commodore 64 computers. Some modern Amiga trackers are DigiBooster Pro and Hively Tracker. Development of popular Amiga tracker OctaMED SoundStudio was handed over to a third party several times but the first two parties failed to produce useful results. A third attempt at creating an update will be undertaken by the current developer of Bars 'n Pipes. =MOD filetype evolution= Initially trackers (and the mod format) were limited to 4 channel, 8-bit audio (due to restrictions of the built-in soundchip) and 15 (and later 31) sampled instruments. By using software mixing some trackers achieved 6, 7 or 8 channel sound at the cost of CPU time and audio quality. Modern trackers can handle 128+ channel, 16-bit audio quality and can often handle up to 256 instruments. Some even support software synthesizer plugins as instruments. Speech synthesis The original Amiga was launched with speech synthesis software, developed by Softvoice, Inc. (see: Text2Speech System). This could be broken into three main components: narrator.device, which could enunciate phonemes expressed as ARPABET, translator.library which could translate English text to American English phonemes, and the SPEAK: handler, which any application including the command-line could redirect output to, to have it spoken. Reading SPEAK: as it is producing speech will return two numbers which are the size ratio of the width and height of a mouth producing the phoneme being spoken. In the original 1.x releases, a Say program demo was included with AmigaBASIC programming examples. From the 2.05 release on, narrator.device and translator.library were no longer present in the operating system but could still be used if copied over from older disks. The speak handler was not just a curiosity, or a gorgeous demonstration of capabilities of Amiga. In fact, the word processor ProWrite since its version 3.2 was able to read an entire document using the speech synthesizer for the benefit of blind users.

Background At the time of publication, Connecticut and Notre Dame were two of the more successful college women's basketball programs. The UConn Huskies then had seven national championships, while the Notre Dame Fighting Irish had three Final Four appearances with a National Championship in 2001. Both teams played in the Big East Conference before its 2013 split, and appeared in the title game of the conference tournament multiple times, with UConn appearing 21 times between 1989 and 2011, and Notre Dame appearing five times in the same time period. Synopsis The main subject of the book is the Big East Tournament championship game of 2001, although the book intersperses play by play coverage of the game with background information on the entire season, as well as commentary on the players, coaches and other aspects of the two programs. The game featured in the book was neither the first nor the last meeting of the two teams in the season. In January, UConn played Notre Dame at Notre Dame. The UConn team was undefeated, and ranked number one in the country at the start of the game. Notre Dame won 92‚Äì76, remained undefeated, and moved from third to the number one ranking at the next poll. Both teams would also meet in the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, with Notre Dame prevailing and then going on to win the national championship. All of the meetings between the two teams that year were important games for each team, but the game in March had multiple story lines‚Äîa tournament championship at stake, a close game in which neither team led by more than eight points at any time, a devastating injury to one of the game's best players, and finally, a game that was decided by a single basket scored in the final moments, by one of the best players in the sport, Sue Bird. Authors The author of the book is Jeff Goldberg, a sportswriter for the Hartford Courant covering the UConn women's team from 2001 to 2006, although on the night of the game featured in the book, he was acting as a freelance reporter for The Chicago Tribune. Goldberg covered the UConn basketball team as well as the Boston Red Sox. The foreword is by Doris Burke, an ESPN reporter. Players and Coaches Many of the participants in the featured game, or in games leading up to the featured game, had notable careers at the time or went on to notable college and pro careers. Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, Swin Cash, Diana Taurasi, Shea Ralph, Maria Conlon, Kelly Schumacher, Kennitra Johnson, and Tamika Williams played for the UConn team, under the coaching of Hall of Fame coach Geno Auriemma. Ericka Haney, Kelley Siemon, Ruth Riley, Alicia Ratay, Niele Ivey, Le'Tania Severe, Jeneka Joyce, and Amanda Barksdale played for the Notre Dame team, under the coaching of the 2001 National Coach of the year Muffet McGraw. Svetlana Abrosimova did not play in the featured game, as she sustained an injury in a win over Tennessee on February 1, 2001 that ended her college career. But she was the leading scorer in the prior match-up of the season, in which third- ranked Notre Dame defeated top-ranked Connecticut for the Huskies' first loss of the season. Both Auriemma and McGraw remain head coaches at their respective programs to this day. McGraw has joined Auriemma in both the Women's and Naismith Memorial Basketball Halls of Fame‚Äîthe Women's Hall shortly after the 2011 season, and the Naismith Hall in 2017. Ralph, who never played after graduating from UConn due to multiple knee injuries, has been an assistant under Auriemma since 2008. UConn has won four additional national titles (2013‚Äì2016), and has yet to miss a Final Four since the book's publication. Notre Dame has made the Final Four six more times (2012‚Äì2015, 2018, 2019), and won a second national title in 2018. Reception Jeff Jacobs notes that the book is \\"well-written\\" with great metaphors, but the real core of the book is narrative. He writes \\"Women's basketball hasn't left enough permanent footprints in sports literature. From the moment he walked outside Gampel Pavilion, turned to former Courant sports writer Matt Eagan, the beat guy at the time, and said, ' I think we just saw the best women's basketball game ever played,' this was in the back of Goldberg's mind.\\" Jacobs notes the dual nature of the game‚Äîthe positive, a well-played game important to both teams at the time, and the negative, the career-ending injury to Shea Ralph. He also notes Goldberg's regret‚Äîthat the book is viewed as a book about UConn, although he wanted it viewed as \\"just as much a Notre Dame book\\". Stephanie Summers, at Mansfield-Storrs Patch, refers to it as \\"The Game That Stands the Test of Time. Kenneth Best, writing for UConn Today, noted the Notre Dame coverage, quoting Goldberg talking about Niele Ivey‚Äî\\"For Niele Ivey to look back and see a slice of that season, even though they lost the game, she thanked me for allowing her to relive that year. It was a special year for her.\\" Mel Greenberg, former veteran writer for The Philadelphia Inquirer, was initially skeptical of Goldberg's claim. Greenberg had planned to attend the game, but was unable due to the winter weather in the area. However, he read a copy of the book and concluded, \\"before even getting to the halfway point [I] decided that Goldberg‚Äôs point is well taken\\". Greenberg also emphasizes the point that the book is about two programs, not just one. He quotes Notre Dame point guard Skylar Diggins who remembers the game, but didn't want to read the book, and urges her to read it, pointing out that Goldberg goes on to cover the first national title for Notre Dame less than a month later. Mechelle Voepel, columnist for ESPN, urges fans to take the time to read the book, even if you \\"know how the book ends\\". Voepel recounts her own watching of the game when it occurred, standing in a drafty hallway, covering the Big 12 Tournament, but more interested in the UConn-Notre Dame game. Voepel followed up with Sue Bird, who found the book intriguing herself, as it reminded her of things that she hadn't remembered, such as helping Shea Ralph up when she was injured. It also gave her a chance to see the game through the eyes of the Notre Dame team.

Don't know how I happen to write that thing, except that somebody that fell, he's the same man as before he fell, ain't he?\\" In the American Masters film, Danny Dill recalls, \\"He was simply overwhelmed by that song, 'Men with Broken Hearts.' And it was so sad, it was awful! But he loved it.\\" The song, like most of the Luke the Drifter recordings, is a recitation, and Hank's delivery, infused with compassion and sadness, gives it a moral authority that is immediately arresting and would influence countless singers from George Jones to Bob Dylan. Williams recorded the song on December 21, 1950 in at Castle Studio in Nashville - the same session that produced \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" - with Fred Rose producing. He was backed by Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), Sammy Pruett (electric guitar), Chet Atkins (rhythm guitar), Ernie Newton or Howard Watts (bass).

S. State of Alabama in the city of Talladega. The current institution includes the Alabama School for the Deaf, the Alabama School for the Blind, and the Helen Keller School, named for Alabamian Helen Keller, which serves children who are both deaf and blind. The E. H. Gentry Technical Facility provides vocational training for older students, and the institution offers employment to graduates through its Alabama Industries for the Blind workshops in Talladega and Birmingham. The AIDB has regional centers in Birmingham, Huntsville, Tuscaloosa, Montgomery, Mobile, Dothan, Auburn, and Tuscumbia. The AIDB currently serves nearly 24,500 residents from all 67 counties of the state. History The institution was formed at the suggestion of Joseph Henry Johnson, a former instructor at the Georgia Asylum for the Deaf in Cave Spring.Gannon, Jack. 1981. Deaf Heritage‚ÄìA Narrative History of Deaf America, Silver Spring, MD: National Association of the Deaf, pp. 33-34 (PDF )(PDF ) He left that school in 1858 and corresponded with Alabama Governor Andrew B. Moore and State Superintendent of Education William Perry about opening a similar facility in the neighboring state. He purchased property in Talladega and opened the Alabama School for the Deaf on October 4 of that same year. The state purchased the property from him in 1860, but kept him on as president. In April 1867 Johnson's brother-in-law, Reuben Rogers Asbury, who had suffered an eye injury during the American Civil War, lobbied the state's Reconstruction legislature for funds to add a school for the blind, with himself as teacher. The funding was approved in 1870, and the combined institutions were renamed the Alabama Institute for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind. The school then served about 70 students. As it grew, it was split again into separate schools in 1887. Josiah Graves took over the Alabama Academy for the Blind and Johnson stayed on as head of the School for the Deaf. In 1892, Alabama founded the Alabama School for Negro Deaf-Mutes (later the Alabama School for the Negro Deaf and Blind) nearby, with Graves serving as principal. The schools taught music, math, religion and home economics as well as vocational programs such as farming and trades. Athletic programs in baseball, basketball and American football were also offered, with the deaf teams going by the name \\"Silent Warriors\\". In the late 1870s, a student-run newspaper, The Messenger, published its first edition. The Gospel group, The Blind Boys of Alabama, got their start at the Institute for Negro Blind in 1939. Johnson's son, Henry Jr., took over at his death. Under his tenure a bakery, model farm and hospital were added, as well as programs for adults with visual impairments. Eugene A. McBride took over as president in 1955 and opened the Helen Keller school (which educated the first deaf and blind student to receive a General Equivalency Diploma). He oversaw the construction of much of the present campus and expanded the institute's outreach to adults, culminating in the vocational center named for his successor, Euel H. Gentry. The Alabama Industries for the Blind has been the sole supplier of neck ties for the United States Armed Forces since the 1960s. In 2006 it also began producing combat helmet covers and ink jet printer cartridges. The parallel schools were integrated in 1968 following the lawsuit Christine Archie v. AIDB. Under President Jack Hawkins in the 1980s, an AIDB Foundation was created to provide additional financial support for the growing institution. A grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation helped underwrite the creation of regional centers around the state. The current president is Dr. John Mascia.

The greatest supporter for this initiative was Georgian poet Titsian Tabidze, who, together with the group of symbolist writers ‚Äì the Blue Horns (Georgian: Tsisferyantselebi / ·É™·Éò·É°·É§·Éî·É†·Éß·Éê·Éú·É¨·Éî·Éö·Éî·Éë·Éò ) ‚Äì advocated the creation of a literature museum since 1919. Tabidze, together with Ivan Enikolofow, was also the first chair of the museum.  History  right The first building of the museum was located on Mtatsminda hills in Tbilisi, home to the pantheon of Georgia‚Äôs most prominent writers and poets, Mtatsminda Pantheon; initially, the museum was created to guard the documents and manuscripts of those famous personalities. Hence the first name of the institution was Museum of Mtatsminda Writers. Later on however, in 1938, when the collection was complemented by different types of documents from the 19th and 20th centuries of Georgian literature, the museum moved to the new place - at Giorgi Tchanturia Street 8 - the historic building it occupies until present, (built in the late 19th century, previously a residence of the deputy Viceroy in the Caucasus) and became the State Literature Museum. Since 1967, it bears the name of Giorgi Leonidze, co- founder of the museum, who, for 22 years (1931‚Äì1953) was also its director.  Archives  Functioning as a literature archive Literature Museum comprises the richest collection of the Georgian literature, mainly of last two centuries (almost 130 000 manuscripts, about 27 000 photos, more than 2 000 paintings und graphics, etc.). Belongings of most prominent Georgian writers, such as Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, Vaja Pshavela, Ivane Machebeli, Alexandre Kazbegi, Galaktion Tabidze, Titsian Tabidze and many others, are kept here. There are also works of the Nobel Prize for Literature winner, the Russian writer Boris Pasternak and the German writer Arthur Leist, who lived in Georgia.

The lyrics come from a poem written in Arabic by the last Abencerrages king of Granada, Aben Humeya, in a translation by Niceto de Zamacois, which Sevilla found in a magazine used as packing material. The Spanish lyrics use the image of a migrating swallow to evoke sentiments of longing for the homeland. It became the signature song of the exiled Mexicans. The song was recorded in 1906La golondrina (mp3) by Se√±or Francisco. A guitar instrumental was recorded by Chet Atkins in 1955. The song has also been recorded by Caterina Valente (1959), Nat King Cole (1962), Pl√°cido Domingo (1984), Flaco Jim√©nez (1992, instrumental), and Caetano Veloso (1994). Felice & Boudleaux Bryant wrote lyrics in English, as \\"She Wears My Ring\\", which was first recorded by Jimmy Sweeney (also known as Jimmy Bell) in 1960 with notable cover versions by Roy Orbison (1962), Ray Price and Solomon King (both 1968), and Elvis Presley (1973). The song figures prominently in the 1969 film The Wild Bunch, directed by Sam Peckinpah and scored by Jerry Fielding. The local people serenade the bandit protagonists with it as they leave Angel's Mexican village. The song, recorded by 13-year-old Heintje, became a German number-one hit in August 1968 (title: Du sollst nicht weinen, \\"Thou shalt not cry\\").

Incidence While teacher bullying is recognized as serious and harmful, there are no statistics on either teachers bullying others or teachers being bullied. However, according to an article, a high percentage of teachers admit that they bully their students. Comprehensive research carried out in the UK found that teaching was one of the occupations at highest risk from bullying:Hoel, H. & Cooper, C.L. Destructive Conflict and Bullying at Work, Sponsored by the British Occupational Health Research Foundation, Manchester School of Management, UMIST (2000) * 15.5% of teachers stating they were currently being bullied * 35.4% saying they had been bullied over the last five years. In another survey, the Economic and Social Research Institute found bullying to be more prevalent in schools (13.8%) than other workplaces (7.9%).BULLYING in the staffroom is having a deeply traumatic effect on some teachers and their families, new research reveals. Irish Independent April 14, 2009 Students with learning disabilities may be especially at risk for teacher bullying. Complex dynamics There are complex issues with reporting bullying by teachers, not only for children, but also parents. By means of their position of power over the child, power that enables them to impact the child's present and future, children and parents are reluctant to report. There are specific signs that parents should watch for as their child is unlikely to disclose that the teacher is in fact the bully. Furthermore, a teacher who bullies may present as a Jekyll and Hyde figure: they are often celebrated and popular so their abuse can go on for long periods of time undetected. Research on teachers in classrooms is lacking and it is unclear how much these activities go undetected or rewarded by teachers in the classroom. For coaches teaching a sport, it can be seen that adults are often rewarded for bullying conduct that would never be tolerated or condoned if done by a child. Parsons identifies teacher bullying as often being part of a wider bullying culture within a school, with a complex web of dynamics such as:Parsons L Bullied Teacher, Bullied Student: How to Recognize the Bullying Culture in Your School and What to Do About It (2005) * Teachers may be bullied by: other teachers, students, office staff, principals,de Wet C The Reasons for and the Impact of Principal- on-Teacher Bullying on the Victims' Private and Professional Lives - Teaching and Teacher Education: An International Journal of Research and Studies, Vol 26 No 7 Pages 1450-1459 Oct 2010 school governors or parents * Teachers may bully: other teachers, studentsMcEvoy A Teachers Who Bully Students: Patterns and Policy Implications - Hamilton Fish Institute‚Äôs Persistently Safe Schools Conference, Philadelphia, September 11-14, 2005 or parents * Bullying teachers may themselves get bullied by others in turn Staffroom bullying A common manifestation of teacher bullying is staffroom bullying where teachers are bullied by other teachers or school managers.Field T Staffroom bullying The Times Educational Supplement (TES) Magazine 21 June 2002Strickland S Bullies in the staff room The Independent 23 November 1995Dean C Call to beat the staffroom bullies The Times Educational Supplement (TES) 16 April 2004Being bullied in the staffroom BBC News 20 November 2006McCall B Staffroom suffering Education Guardian, 20 November 2006 Manifestations In investigating teacher bullying, it is important to differentiate a teacher or coach who is demanding versus one who is demeaning. So \\"yelling\\" for instance can be highly productive and motivating, but if it involves belittling and is laced with putdowns, personal attacks, and insults, it becomes abusive. Bullying by teachers can take many forms in order to harass and intimidate including: * Swearing, or yelling, especially in close proximity to the child * Using homophobic, sexist, racial slurs, or direct personal attacks, comments targeting a child's disability or difference * Humiliating * Berating * Ignoring or shunning * Throwing objects * Raging * Expressing disgust at the child through gestures or facial expressions * Muttering obscenities so only the targeted child or children hear * Hypocrisy (ex: telling a student not to say \\"well\\" despite using the same word while communicating) Bullying of teachers can take many forms in order to harass and intimidate including:Lepkowska D The shocking stories of teacher-on-teacher bullying Secondary Education News (SecEd) 11 Nov 2010 * Face-to-face confrontation * Memos * Cyberbullying (including the use of text messaging or social networking sites) Bullies often exploit positions of seniority over the colleagues they are intimidating (see rankism) by: * Criticising their work * Making unreasonable demands on workload (see setting up to fail) * Sarcasm and jokes aimed at the victim * Undermining them by over-ruling their decisions and views In some cases, teachers are ignored and isolated by colleagues in the staffroom or turned down for promotion or training courses (see silent treatment). Other times, teachers are ostracized as whistleblowers when they report to administrators on students' reports of bullying being done by their colleagues. Impacts The power imbalance of teacher to student is greater than peer to peer and may well intensify the impact. The possible impacts of bullying of teachers include: * Victimisation and victim blaming * False accusations and fabricated formal disciplinary actionMunday K The Bullying of Teachers Through the Use of Formal Disciplinary Procedures 2003 * Stress symptoms such as anxiety, headaches, nausea, palpitations, and hypertension * Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) such as a compromised immune system, sleep problems, excessive guilt, irritability, hypervigilance (which feels like paranoia, but is not), constant anxiety, reactive depression and suicidal thoughts * Loss of self-esteem * Loss of job Notable incidents In April 2012, Stuart Chaifetz, a father of an autistic boy, released a video on YouTube\\"Teacher/Bully: How My Son Was Humiliated and Tormented by his Teacher and Aide\\", Stuart Chaifetz, video at YouTube, posted April 20, 2012 providing evidence that his son was allegedly the subject of emotional abuse at the hands of his teacher and aide at Horace Mann Elementary School, in the Cherry Hill Public Schools district.Horace Mann Elementary School website The evidence was secured when Chaifetz wired his son with a microphone before sending him to school. When he listened to the audio recording, according to one news report, \\"Chaifetz says he caught his son's teachers gossiping, talking about alcohol and violently yelling at students. He took the audio to the Cherry Hill School District, where officials fired one of the teachers involved after hearing the tape.

(July 17, 1922 - May 18, 1987) was an eminent physician, general and thoracic surgeon, healthcare-reformer, educator, and President of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents from 1984 to 1986.  Early life and education  Ben Lawton was the third of four Lawton siblings, born on July 17, 1922 in Viroqua, Wisconsin, where his father, John Cliff Lawton, was a teacher and public school administrator. Ben was subsequently raised by his mother, Cora Lawton (n√©e Wheeler) and his grandmother, Margaret Wheeler, after his father's death in 1935. Ben attended public schools in Vernon County, Wisconsin. Lawton was admitted to the University of Wisconsin (UW) in 1940, where he majored in zoology and was elected to membership in Phi Eta Sigma, a national honor society. After completing his bachelor's degree (working part-time as a milkman), Ben matriculated to the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine, learning under the influence of Dean William Shainline Middleton and obtaining his M.D. degree in 1948 as a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha medical honor society. He then pursued residency training in general surgery at the University of Wisconsin General Hospital, followed by a fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery. Lawton served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during the Korean War, and returned to Wisconsin in 1954. Career at the Marshfield Clinic At that time, the Marshfield Clinic (MC), in Marshfield, WI, was expanding its medical staff to build a multispecialty capability. Dr. Lawton joined the MC as its 22nd physician and its first board-certified thoracic surgeon. Over the ensuing 33 years he performed over 30,000 operations, served as MC President for several terms, and worked with other colleagues (most notably Dr. George Magnin, an internist, & Dr. Russell Lewis, a gynecologist) to enlarge and diversify the MC facilities and staff. By the year 2000, over 250 physicians practiced there. Dr. Lawton was a Clinical Professor of Surgery at UW, and he served as a preceptor to scores of senior medical students throughout his career. In addition, Lawton published more than 40 scholarly papers in the peer-reviewed medical literature. Medical-political activism Lawton became involved in Wisconsin state politics in the 1950s, as a registered Democrat. As his obituary in the Milwaukee Journal stated, he was \\"stubbornly liberal when it was fashionable and when it was not.\\" Recognized for his activism as well as his medical skills, Dr. Lawton was elected to the Wisconsin State Board of Medical Examiners in 1962, and he served as its President in 1965. When Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey was elected in 1970, he constituted a state Health Planning Policy Task Force and named Lawton as its chairperson. That organization worked to codify public healthcare policy which is still in place. Dr. Lawton was appointed to the UW Board of Regents in the early 1970s, and he was elected to its presidency in 1984. It was during his Board tenure that the entire system of public universities in Wisconsin was consolidated under one center of governance. This was a controversial but successful venture,University of Wisconsin System and one in which Lawton played a key administrative role. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson had appointed Lawton to the National Institute of Medicine. This event recognized Lawton's advocacy for egalitarianism, service to the underprivileged, and development of modern medical research and education. In recognition of these contributions, Dr. Lawton received a pen used by President Johnson in 1965 to sign the Medicare Bill into law. Lawton was always a forward-thinker regarding the delivery of medical care, and was one of the first vocal supporters of physician assistant (PA) training programs. The University of Wisconsin Lawton Award is given yearly to a minority PA student there. The Lawton Center for Medical Research and the Lawton Society were also dedicated to him at the MC. Personal information; illness & death Lawton had lost his father at age 13 and grew up in limited circumstances. He married Ruth M. Klahn (1922-2009) in 1944, and had four children with her: Daniel, Richard, Ben, and Margaret. Mrs. Lawton developed an incurable ocular illness that left her totally sightless. Dr. Lawton acted as her eyes during most of their 43 years of marriage. Daniel Lawton also predeceased his father as a young adult. Lawton had a nearly-fatal myocardial infarct in 1977; after a difficult recovery, he resumed all of his professional activities. However, Lawton ultimately developed pancreatic carcinoma in late 1986; he was visited during his last illness by many state and national political figures who were among his friends and admirers. Dr. Lawton died on May 18, 1987, and he is buried in Marshfield, WI.

The song was recorded by Elvis Presley on at least three occasions during the 1950s, and was one of two songs he recorded in July 1953, prior to the beginning of his professional career, for a demo acetate purportedly given to his mother as a birthday present. Elvis Presley versions On July 18, 1953, Elvis Presley paid $3.98 for a recording studio time at the Sun Studio in Memphis, a recording studio that was also home to the Sun Records label starting in 1952. Presley recorded a double-sided acetate demo single, though he was not yet signed to the Sun Records label. On the A-side, he recorded \\"My Happiness\\", later made famous by Connie Francis in 1958. For the B-side, he recorded \\"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\\". He would later revisit the song in recording studios on at least two occasions, the first during the famous Million Dollar Quartet sessions on December 4, 1956, and the second in January 1957, when it was recorded and released as a B-side to \\"All Shook Up\\".

Plot While on her way to a dancing job at a resort, Maisie Ravier is thrown off the train for not having enough money to pay the fare. She is given a ride to the resort by up-and-coming boxer Terry Dolan. Dolan's suspicious manager, \\"Skeets\\" Maguire, offends Maisie by telling her that he does not want her \\"sort\\" around his protege, despite Terry already having a girlfriend. As Skeets gets to know Maisie better, he realizes his mistake, and he and Maisie fall in love. When Maisie rejects the romantic advances of Ricky Du Prez, her employer and dancing partner, she is fired. Terry asks her to be the companion to his wheelchair-bound mother. When she accepts the job, Terry asks her to hide his profession from Mrs. Dolan, who believes he is a razor blade salesman. Maisie disapproves of lying, but agrees. Terry confides a secret to Maisie: he hates and fears boxing, and would rather run a grocery store just like his late father did. Since he will have enough money to buy a store after the next fight, Maisie encourages him to tell Skeets. Skeets surprises Maisie by telling Terry that he has an ironclad contract, and insisting that Terry will take on the champion after the next bout. Maisie ends her relationship with Skeets. Discouraged, Terry fights poorly and is knocked out in the sixth round. He receives a concussion, and when he revives he is blind. Maisie brings Mrs. Dolan to the hospital. Dolan tells his mother that there are only three specialists in the whole country who are qualified to repair the damage, but it will take all of his savings. Mrs. Dolan is concerned only about his welfare, and is not concerned about his violent profession. The operation is a success. When Maisie discovers that Skeets flew to Boston personally to fetch the specialist, they reconcile.

He was among the earliest jazz musicians to establish the cello as a viable improvising solo instrument.Shepherd, John (2003) Continuum encyclopedia of popular music of the world, Volume II, Continuum International Publishing Group, , page 413. Katz has been described in CODA magazine as \\"the first real jazz cellist.\\" Cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm (b. 1962), who recorded a 2002 tribute album to the older musician (A Valentine For Fred Katz, Atavistic Records), praises Katz for introducing his instrument to jazz: \\"[Katz] managed to find a way to make it swing.\\"Kalish, Jon. (2007) The 'Far Out' Music of Fred Katz, from NPR Music. Biography Born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York City, Katz was classically trained. He studied under Pablo Casals and performed with several symphony orchestras. He was a member of the National Symphony Orchestra. He was a child prodigy on both the cello and piano and performed in public as a teenager, and was drawn to the music of Manhattan nightclubs and to folk music. In his youth Katz was a Communist. During World War II he conducted concerts and wrote musical revues for the U.S. Seventh Army. Katz is best known as a member of drummer Chico Hamilton's quintet, one of the most important West Coast jazz groups of the 1950s. Katz's arco cello defined the \\"chamber jazz\\" focus of Chico Hamilton's Quintet and the group quickly gained popularity.Weber M., The CODA Interview with Fred Katz, CODA The Jazz Magazine, Issue 176 (1980) The Chico Hamilton Quintet, including Katz, appeared in the film noir Sweet Smell of Success (1957), starring Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis. Katz and Hamilton wrote a score for the film which was ultimately rejected in favor of one by Elmer Bernstein.Butler, David. (2002) Jazz Noir: listening to music from Phantom Lady to The Last Seduction. Greenwood Publishing Group, , p. 136 Katz also recorded several albums as a leader. Another high point in Katz's career was writing and conducting the arrangements for singer Carmen McRae's album Carmen For Cool Ones, which was released in 1958. One of his most recognizable pieces of music was his score for the film A Bucket of Blood (1959), directed by Roger Corman, as the music appeared in a total of seven Corman films, including The Wasp Woman (1959) and Creature from the Haunted Sea (1961). According to Mark Thomas McGee, author of Roger Corman: The Best of the Cheap Acts, each time Katz was called upon to write music for Corman, Katz sold the same score as if it were new music. Katz explained that his music for Corman's The Little Shop of Horrors was created by a music editor piecing together selections from other soundtracks that he had produced for Corman.Larson, R. D., A talk with Fred Katz by Randall D. Larson, Originally published in CinemaScore #11/12, 1983 Later in his career, Katz became a professor of ethnic music in the Anthropology Department at California State University, Fullerton and California State University, Northridge, where he taught world music, anthropology and religion for over 30 years. He was a longtime Fullerton resident. One of his students was John Densmore, drummer of The Doors. Katz died on September 7, 2013, in Santa Monica, California.

Sullivan commented, ‚ÄúThe 1940 recording session that Wiley Walker and I did for Columbia records was a mistake. We didn‚Äôt know anything about original songs. We just recorded songs that we liked to sing. The Columbia A & R man, Art Satherley, trashed most of the tunes we recorded and we had to learn six new songs in one day.

So I started to try to write songs.‚Äù ‚ÄúDuring that time, I was moving my family and everything we owned in our car from Lubbock Texas to Oklahoma City for a new job.

Al-Assad's program of reform, considered revolutionary in Syria, aimed to sustain and improve the \\"nationalist socialist line\\" of the state and the Ba'ath party. Al-Assad would rule Syria until his death in 2000, after which he was succeeded by his son Bashar al-Assad.  Events  Al-Assad started planning to seize power shortly after the failed Syrian military intervention in the Black September crisis in Jordan. While Al-Assad had been in de facto command of Syrian politics since 1969, Salah Jadid and his supporters still held all the formal trappings of power. After attending Gamal Abdel Nasser's funeral, Al-Assad returned to Syria to attend the Emergency National Congress held on 30 October 1970. At the congress, Al-Assad was condemned by Jadid and his supporters, who formed the majority of the party delegates. However, before attending the congress, Al-Assad had ordered troops loyal to him to surround the building in which the congress was held. Criticism of Al-Assad's political position continued, but with Assad's troops surrounding the building, the majority of delegates knew that they had lost the battle. Assad and Mustafa Tlass were stripped of their government posts during the congress, although this move had little practical influence. When the National Congress broke up on 12 November 1970, Al-Assad ordered loyalists to arrest the leading members of Jadid's government. While many leading middle men were offered posts in Syria's embassies abroad, Jadid refused, telling Assad, \\"If I ever take power you will be dragged through the streets until you die.\\" In response, Assad imprisoned Jadid who spent the rest of his life at Mezze prison. There were no fatalities, and the country remained calm following the coup. The only proof to the outside world that something was amiss was the fact that official dailies, radio, and, television stations either stopped publishing or were off the air. A Temporary Regional Command was established shortly after, and on 16 November 1970, the new government published its first decree. Reforms =Domestic= Political reforms Assad's faction, which was far smaller than the pro-Jadid faction, began recruiting Aflaqites to top positions to cement their power. Assad appealed directly to Michel Aflaq's sympathizers by stating: \\"Let us rebuild together and if we fail our heads will all be on the block together\\". An estimated 2,000 people responded to Assad's invitation, among them were Georges Saddiqni, a party ideologist, and Shakir al-Fahham, one of the secretaries of the Ba'ath Party's founding congress in 1947. However, despite trying to strengthen his hold on the party, at a 1970 Regional Command meeting, its members opposed Assad's motion to appoint a figurehead to lead the party. As a result, Assad went on to establish a separate power base apart from the party. As part of his \\"corrective movement,\\" at the 11th National Congress Assad introduced a general revision of national policy. Included in these revisions were measures introduced to consolidate his rule. His Ba'athist predecessors had restricted control of Islam in public life and government. Because the Constitution allowed only Muslims to become president, Assad, unlike Jadid, presented himself as a pious Muslim. In order to gain support from the ulama‚Äîthe educated Muslim class ‚Äî he prayed in Sunni mosques, even though he was an Alawite. Among the measures Assad introduced were the raising in rank of some 2,000 religious functionaries, and the appointment of an alim as minister of religious functionaries and construction of mosques. He appointed a little-known Sunni teacher, Ahmad al-Khatib, as Head of State in order to satisfy the Sunni majority. Assad also appointed Sunnis to senior positions in the government, the military, and the party. All of his prime ministers, defense ministers, and foreign ministers, a majority of his cabinet, were Sunnis. In the early 1970s, Assad was verified as an authentic Muslim by the Sunni Mufti of Damascus and made the Hajj‚Äîthe pilgrimage to Mecca. In his speeches, he often used terms such as \\"jihad\\" (a holy war) and \\"shahada\\" (martyrdom) when referring to fighting Israel. The coup turned Syria's social and political structures upside down. The Alawites, Assad's sect, although no more than 12% of the population, came to occupy coveted positions in every sector of life in Syria. Economic reforms Assad reverted his predecessor's policy of radical economic socialism, and strengthened the private sector's role in the economy. In many ways the Corrective Movement resulted in a tacit alliance between the political elite and the Damascene bourgeoise. =Foreign policy= The reforms also sought to normalize Syria's relations with the other Arab states since it had been isolated diplomatically during Jadid's short-lived rule. Assad tried to establish working relations with Egypt and Saudi Arabia in order to establish the so-called \\"Cairo‚ÄìDamascus‚ÄìRiyadh axis\\" to strengthen security cooperation against Israel. The cooperation agreement was effective, and when Egypt and Syria failed to win the October War in 1973, Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil producers ceased selling oil to the West. Legacy The Syrian government commemorates the Corrective Movement with an official holiday, observed on 16 November of each year. When the communist governments in the Eastern Bloc collapsed, an ideological crisis within the government arose. However, Assad and his supporters hit back, stating that because of the \\"Corrective Movement under the leadership of the warrior Hafez al-Assad\\", the principles of economic and political pluralism, which had been introduced \\"some two decades\\" beforehand, safeguarded the Syrian government from the possibility of collapse. Later, on 27 January 2000, Syrian foreign minister Farouk al-Sharaa stated, \\"I am not exaggerating when I say that the Corrective Movement, which took place in 1970 under the leadership of Hafez al-Assad ... has crystallized for the first time in modern Arab history a mature and realistic pan-Arab ideology.\\" References Bibliography   * 1970 in Syria Arab nationalism in Syria Arab nationalist rebellions Revolutions in Syria Nonviolent revolutions Military coups in Syria History of the Ba'ath Party 1970s coups d'√©tat and coup attempts ","title":"Corrective Movement (Syria)"},{"id":"31231307","text":"Sarah Gillespie is a British American singer songwriter and writer based in London.

The town was perhaps founded in the time of the Achaemenid Empire. Under the Kushan Empire it became a major local centre. After the Indo-Sassanids the town was abandoned. Archaeological remains The town proper was about 390 x 390 m large. Dilbarjin had a city wall built under the Kushan rule. In the middle of the town there was a round citadel, built at about the same time. In the North-East corner of the town was excavated a temple complex. Here were found many wall paintings, some in a purely Hellenistic style. Originally the temple was perhaps dedicated to the Dioscuri, of which a mural in Hellenistic style has been recovered. A long inscription in the Kushan language was also discovered, dated to the early great Kushans, around the period of Kanishka I, on paleographic grounds, as it seems slightly younger than the inscription of Surkh Kotal. Outside the city walls there were still substantial buildings. Finds include inscriptions in Bactrian, most of them too destroyed to provide any historical information. There were fragments of sculpture and many coins. =Wall paintings= Kidara on the model of Varahran, of the type found in Dilberjin. Circa CE 350-365, Balkh mint. The paintings of Dilberjin Tepe are very similar to those of Balalyk Tepe, and some from Bamiyan, all belonging to the 5th-6th century CE, or even as early as the 4th century CE according to some authorities, based on numismatic evidence.\\"Furthermore, the style of the later paintings [of Diberjin Tepe], which are comparable to those of Balalyk Tepe and to the oldest frescoes at Panjƒ´kant, both in Sogdia, indicates a date in the 5th-6th centuries C.E., according to some authorities (Belenitskiƒ≠ and Marshak), whereas others argue from the numismatic finds that the final phase cannot have been later than the end of the 4th or the early 5th century C.E. (Vaƒ≠nberg and Kruglikova, 1976; idem, 1984; Pugachenkova, 1984, p. 105).\\" Coins of the Kushano-Sasanians and the Kidarites were the most numerous from the early Sasanian period to have been found on the site. About 72 such coins were found, belonging to Ardashir I, Peroz I, Hormiz I, as well as each type of the Varahran I, that is, the coins first struck under Varahran, and then those struck on the model of Varahran by the Kidarite rulers Kirada, Peroz and Kidara I. These coins suggest that the murals themselves should be dated to the late 4th century CE or early 5th century CE at the latest.\\"Furthermore, the style of the later paintings [of Diberjin Tepe], which are comparable to those of Balalyk Tepe and to the oldest frescoes at Panjƒ´kant, both in Sogdia, indicates a date in the 5th-6th centuries C.E., according to some authorities (Belenitskiƒ≠ and Marshak), whereas others argue from the numismatic finds that the final phase cannot have been later than the end of the 4th or the early 5th century C.E.

Marin and starring George Raft, June Havoc and Helena Carter. Intrigue was intended to be the first of a number of films Raft made, with producer Sam Bischoff, for his own production company, Star Films. It was one of several movies Raft made with Marin. Plot In post-war China, court-martialed pilot Brad Dunham (George Raft) now flies smuggled goods into the country. He attempts to force his immediate superior, Ramon Perez (Marvin Miller), to pay him more, but Perez resists, so Brad steals the cargo back. The boss of the black-market operation is Tamara Baranoff (June Havoc), who agrees to Brad's demand of a 50% cut of the operation and fires Ramon as a show of good faith. Meanwhile, an American newspaper reporter, Marc Andrews (Tom Tully), a friend of Brad's, shows up in Shanghai to investigate black-market crime. Brad meets a social worker, Linda Arnold (Helena Carter), and their friendship makes Tamara jealous. She insists that Brad do something about the prying reporter and steer clear of that other woman. Tamara's criminal rival tips off Marc that his pal Brad is involved with the crime ring. Marc is knifed by Tamara's rival just as he is delivering a copy of his story exposing the black market.

This company expected to make three films over two years at a budget of $3,500,000. The same month, Bischoff signed a four picture deal with United Artists ‚Äì three of the movies would star Raft and the fourth would be Pitfall (1948) (which wound up starring Dick Powell). Biscoff obtained $5 million credit from the Bank of America to make these films. In February 1947 Bischoff announced the first film he would make with Raft under the four picture deal would be Intrigue based on an original story by George Slavin. Slavin's story was inspired by his observations in the Pacific War, where he served with the RAF and American Air Force. Edwin Marin signed to direct in February 1947 by which stage Slavin and Barry Triven were working on a script. Bischoff wanted Gloria Swanson to play the femme fetale role. The role eventually went to June Havoc. Helena Carter was borrowed from Universal- International. Bischoff had a credit line of $5 million to make the films. The plot of Intrigue was originally meant to involve smuggling blood plasma, but this was changed to whisky and cigarettes at the request of Chinese-American organizations. Raft regretted this change. \\"If we had been able to retain the original idea it would have been a lot more exciting\\", he said.Aaker 2013, p. 129.

She's fully present and focused in her scenes with Raft ‚Äì her eyes are alive, interested, alert; she's aware, not naive, nobody's fool. The film would have been far better off with more of her and less of the self-righteous reporter... who is going to expose Raft.\\" Radio adaptation On May 10, 1948, George Raft and June Havoc reprised their film roles in Intrigue with a 60-minute radio adaptation of the film for a \\"Lux Radio Theater\\" broadcast.\\"Notes: 'Intrigue' (1947).\\" TCM, 2019.

(c. 1630 ‚Äì 1699) was an English Independent minister. Early life The second son of Richard Mead of Mursley, Buckinghamshire, by his wife Joane, he was born about 1630 at Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. In 1648 he was elected scholar, and on 6 August 1649 admitted a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. He resigned on 6 June 1651, William Cole says to avoid expulsion, owing perhaps to refusal of the engagement; but he had gained ill-will by urging the expulsion of Richard Johnson and others. In search of a position Francis Charlett, rector of Great Brickhill, Buckinghamshire, died in 1653; Mead hoped to succeed him, but the patron, John Duncombe, presented Thomas Clutterbuck. Mead, on the ground that the patron's right had lapsed, obtained a presentation under the Great Seal. Duncombe appealed to the law, and a verdict for Clutterbuck was given at the Aylesbury assizes. Mead began another suit on the plea of Duncombe's malignancy. Clutterbuck resigned his title, and Duncombe, in July 1655, presented Robert Hocknell, whom the ‚Äòcommissioners for approbation‚Äô (triers) rejected, putting in Mead by aid of a troop of horse. After some violent proceedings, the matter was compromised by Duncombe's agreeing to present William Peirce, a nephew of Hugh Peters. Mead now became morning lecturer at St. Dunstan's, Stepney, the afternoon lecturer being William Greenhill, who held the vicarage. He lived in Gracechurch Street, and was admitted a member, on 28 December 1656, of the congregational church formed at Stepney by Greenhill in 1644. On 22 January 1658 he was appointed by Oliver Cromwell to the ‚Äònew chapel‚Äô of St Paul's Church, Shadwell. From Shadwell, as well as from his lectureship, Mead was displaced at the Restoration of 1660. He obtained a lectureship at St Sepulchre's, Holborn, from which he was ejected by the Uniformity Act of 1662. Stepney congregation In 1663, he was living at Worcester House, Stepney. Either the Conventicle Act (1664) or the Five Miles Act, which came into operation in 1666, drove him to Holland. He seems to have been in London during the great plague of 1665. On 31 January 1669, he was called to Stepney as assistant to Greenhill at Stepney. Shortly after Greenhill's death he was called (13 October 1671) to succeed him as pastor, and was ordained on 14 December 1671 by John Owen, Joseph Caryl, and two others. In 1674, a meeting-house (opened 13 September) was built for him at Stepney; its roof was upheld by four round pine pillars, presented to him by the States of Holland; above the ceiling was an attic with concealed entrance, a hiding-place for the congregation in troubled times. His congregation was the largest in London. On 1 May 1674, he instituted a Mayday sermon to the young; he always held a Good Friday service. About 1680, Mead became the guardian of James Peirce, the Exeter heretic, who lived in his house for some years. In December 1682 Sir William Smith with a strong guard invaded his meeting-house, pulled down the pulpit, and broke up the forms. In June 1683 Mead was apprehended on suspicion of complicity in the Rye House Plot, and brought before the privy council, where the king ordered his discharge. Later life Robert White Mead succeeded John Owen in September 1683 as one of the Tuesday morning lecturers (presbyterian and congregational) at the merchants' lecture in Pinners' Hall. Pleading there on one occasion on behalf of poor ministers, he got a collection of ¬£300., ladies putting their rings and watches into the plates. In 1686 he was again in Holland, preaching at Utrecht; he returned on King James's declaration for liberty of conscience in 1687. After the Glorious Revolution, galleries were built (25 March 1689) in his meeting-house, and the adjoining residence and garden were settled (16 July) by the congregation on Mead and his heirs. Mead supported the movement initiated (1690) by John Howe for an amalgamation of the presbyterian and congregationalist bodies. The ‚Äòhappy union‚Äô held its meeting at Stepney on 6 April 1691, when Mead preached his sermon ‚ÄòTwo Sticks made One‚Äô (Ezek. xxxvii. 19). On the rupture of the union (1694) over the alleged heresies of Daniel Williams, Mead took a moderate part, but remained in the Pinners' Hall lectureship when the presbyterians seceded. When Edmund Calamy applied to him (1694) for ordination he declined to act, for fear of giving umbrage to others. He preached his last sermon on May day 1699, and died on 16 October 1699, aged 70. He was buried in Stepney churchyard; Calamy gives the Latin inscription on his tombstone. Howe preached his funeral sermon. Peirce describes him as a gentleman and a scholar. An elegy on his death, ‚ÄòTristi√¶ Christian√¶,‚Äô was issued in a folio sheet, 1699. Works Besides separate sermons, 1660‚Äì98, including funeral sermons for Thomas Rosewell (1692) and Timothy Cruso, he published: *‚ÄòEnolig≈çi Christianos, the Almost Christian Discovered,‚Äô &c.;, 1662, (substance of sermons at St. Sepulchre's, Holborn, in 1661); often reprinted; in Dutch, Utrecht, 1682; in Welsh, Merthyr Tydfil, 1825. * ‚ÄòSolomon's Prescription for the Removal of the Pestilence,‚Äô &c.;, 1666; 1667, (with appendix). * ‚ÄòThe Good of Early Obedience,‚Äô &c.;, 1683, (Mayday sermons). * ‚ÄòThe Vision of the Wheels,‚Äô &c.;, 1689, (sermons on Ezekiel). Posthumous were: * ‚ÄòThe Young Man's Remembrancer,‚Äô &c.;, 3rd edit. 1701, (his last two Mayday sermons; often reprinted). * ‚ÄòOriginal Sermons on the Jews; and on Falling into the Hands of ‚Ä¶ God ‚Ä¶ with a Memoir,‚Äô &c.;, 1836, (edited from shorthand notes transcribed by James Andrews in 1703 and 1710). He had a hand in the ‚ÄòEnglish Greek Lexicon,‚Äô 1661. His farewell sermon before ejection was published separately, 1662, and also in the ‚ÄòCompleat Collection,‚Äô 1663. He wrote a preface to ‚ÄòThe Life and Death of Nathaniel Mather,‚Äô 1689. Family Married Elizabeth Walton 3 January 1653/4 at St. Mary Woolnoth Church in London. Elizabeth was from Allhallows, Lombard Street. He had thirteen children, of whom the physician Richard Mead was the eleventh. An elder son, Samuel, was a fellow-student with Calamy at Utrecht in 1687; published at Utrecht a ‚ÄòDisputatio,‚Äô 1686, an ‚ÄòExercitatio,‚Äô 1687, and an ‚ÄòOratio,‚Äô 1689; in 1694 he was an evening lecturer at Salters' Hall, but was not ordained, and became a chancery practitioner.

Marin and starring Dennis Morgan, Patricia Neal and Steve Cochran.http://allmovie.com/work/raton-pass-107312 Plot A low-level feud in 1880 New Mexico Territory pits wealthy rancher Pierre Challon and son Marc versus homesteaders on the other side of Raton Pass. The Challon Ranch is so large that it is split in two by the Raton Pass, and the Challons have leased the strip from the homesteaders to allow their 10,000 head of cattle to graze on all parts of the ranch. Two strangers arrive by stagecoach, a ruthless man named Van Cleave and an attractive woman, Ann, who promptly seduces and marries Marc, who is blissfully unaware that she's strictly in it out of greed, not love. While he and his father are away on business, Ann offers to work out a land irrigation deal with Prentice, a banker. Ann, bothered that she has little say in the daily operation of the ranch, seduces Prentice. When Marc returns, he finds Ann and Prentice are romantically involved and planning to swindle him out of the ranch. Marc sells the ranch to Ann, confident she and Prentice will not be able to manage the spread and will not earn enough money to cover more than their initial $100,000 ($ today) down payment, which will put the ranch back in his hands while exacting some revenge for Ann's betrayal. Pierre disagrees with his son's plan and leaves the Territory. Lena Casamajor, a homesteader's niece, has always loved Marc. She fears that Ann will ruin the ranch and escalate the issues against the homesteaders, ruining the region for everyone. She helps Marc meet with the homesteaders, where he offers to use the downpayment to build irrigation for all parties, if they agree to help him deny Ann access to the lease Marc personally holds with the homesteaders. Ann hires Van Cleave as her foreman, leading a band of thugs to battle Marc's original ranch hands and the homesteaders for possession of the strip. Lena later sets off to bring Pierre back after Van Cleave incapacitates Marc by cold-bloodedly shooting him in the back and later shooting her uncle as well. Fed up with her ways, Prentice leaves Ann, but Van Cleave kills him and the sheriff. The Challons are the only ones who can stop him, and they do, but not before a shot by Van Cleave accidentally kills Ann.

The original Fairtex Gym was founded in Bangkok, Thailand in 1975. History The Fairtex Garments Factory Company Limited was founded by Mr. Philip Wong in 1971, selling Muay Thai training equipment and Fairtex branded T-shirts to the Thai department store market. The first Fairtex Gym was created in Bangkok. The Camp was initially established in central Bangkok but later relocated to Bangplee, about 25 km away. This location was chosen specifically to create a professional training atmosphere away from the distractions of Bangkok. The venue benefits from clean, fresh air and the cooling ocean breeze from the gulf of Thailand - a refreshing contrast to the noise and pollution of Bangkok. Wong created Fairtex Promotions in 1978 when he became a promoter at the Lumpinee Stadium. In 1998, Mr. Philip Wong, Founder & Chairman, partnered with Anthony Lin, President & CEO, to open Fairtex Equipment Company Limited to manufacture, market and distribute Fairtex branded equipment and apparels worldwide. In 1993, a Fairtex Gym was opened in Chandler, Arizona, United States but was relocated to San Francisco, California in 1996. In 2004, Anthony Lin moved Fairtex to a new location in San Francisco. In 2007, Fairtex Mountain View was opened and Fairtex Newark, CA in 2009. In 2013, Fairtex Mountain View closed, leaving no Fairtex gyms in the United States. Nine gyms were opened in the Tokyo metropolitan area in 2004, another in Pattaya the following year and one in 2012, Fairtex in China. Author Sam Sheridan wrote about his time training at Fairtex in his book A Fighter's Heart. Some of his experience can also be seen in the 2002 documentary Thai Boxing: A Fighting Chance.

On 5 September 1917, a small cadre of Regular Army non- commissioned officers and privates joined officer cadres that had reported on 29 August 1917 after graduating from the three batteries of the 7th Provisional Training Regiment. Draftees from Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee arrived over the next few weeks, but many of these men were transferred in November and replaced by new draftees from Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and Minnesota and all the states east of the Mississippi River. Initially, the 320th's six firing batteries shared a single battery of 3-inch guns for training with the other 12 batteries in the brigade. In addition to approximately 10 hours use of the actual guns, the regiment's gun squads conducted training with replicas \\"crudely made structures fashioned from the trunks of small trees, tin cans, spools, gas pipes and any available material.\\" A second battery of guns arrived in December, and from December 1917 through May 1918, the regiment conducted firing practice at Blackjack Mountain near Marietta, Georgia. Beginning 8 May 1918, the regiment moved by train to Camp Mills, New York, and then shipped to Liverpool, England on the ship City of Exeter, arriving on 31 May 1918. After a brief stop, the regiment crossed the English Channel from Southampton to Le Havre, France and then moved by train to La Courtine. There, the 320th was fully equipped with 75mm guns and conducted two months of training, culminating in a brigade live fire. From 5‚Äì10 August, the 320th moved into a reserve position behind Chateau Thierry, but was not employed and moved by train to Toul and then occupied defensive positions in the Marbache sector with the 157th/82nd. On 22 August, Battery F fired the brigade's first 75mm rounds against Norroy. In preparation for the St. Mihiel Offensive, the regiment moved into forward gun positions constructed with the assistance of the division's infantry. Beginning at 0100hrs on 12 September 1918, the 320th participated in a four-hour preparation, consisting of counter-battery fires on 16 German batteries and other positions. After the offensive started, the regiment also fired on \\"fugitive targets\\". On 13 September, the 320th and its sister 321st Field Artillery fired 10000 rounds in support of a raid by the 327th Infantry in the Bois Frehaut. The result of the St. Mihiel operation was \\"the establishment of confidence, born of performance\\" throughout the 157th Brigade. After relief on 20 September and assembling near Marbache, the 320th spent the nights of 22‚Äì25 September moving to Beauzee, arriving on the morning of 26 September. On 26 September, the regiment moved to bivouac's near Futeau in the Argonne Forest, remaining there until 5 October. At 1300 hours on 5 October 1918, the 157th received orders for an attack at 0500 hours the next morning. The advanced party established a regimental command post at Chaudron Farm, with the 321st Field Artillery's command post. Poor roads and miscommunications delayed the movement of the regiment's main body, and the first battery began firing at 0540 hours, 40 minutes after H-hour and the regiment missed the first planned phase of its plan. After the truncated preparation, the regiment fired in support of the infantry throughout the day. At 1800 hours, the 2nd Battalion joined the 321st Field Artillery in repelling a German counterattack against the 164th Infantry Brigade. Defensive and harassing fire continued through the night of 6‚Äì7 October. 7 October was spent in establishing observation posts and telephone communications in the new positions. On the morning of 8 October, 2/320th again joined the 321st Field Artillery in firing a rolling barrage for the infantry, while the 1/320th and the French 219th artillery fired a \\"standing barrage\\" to protect the right flank of the 327th Infantry. On 9 October, the 320th again joined the 321st in firing a rolling barrage for the 327th and 328th Infantries of the 164th Infantry Brigade. After receiving new orders on 10 October, the regiment spent the night of 10‚Äì11 October occupying new positions in the ravine west of Exermont. Assigned to support the 164th Infantry Brigade, the regiment assigned one battalion to each of the brigade's two regiments as accompanying artillery. The 1/320th occupied near Fleville, but poor visibility inhibited the identification of targets. Little movement occurred through 13 October, although on the afternoon of 13 October, the regiment fired a defensive barrage to repulse a German counterattack. During the afternoon and evening, 2/320th moved forward to positions south of Sommerance, although Battery E was delayed by the counterattack. The regiment continued to fire harassing fire through the night. On 14 October, the regiment participated in a rolling barrage in support of a general First Army attack on the Kriemhilde Stellung, and at about 1600 hours fired a 30-minute defensive barrage along the Ravin aux Pierres. During this attack, a forward gun under 2nd Lieutenant Edward Gunter destroyed two pillboxes. And on the afternoon of 14 October, 1/320 moved forward to the ravine between Fleville and Sommerance. From midnight on 14‚Äì15 October, the regiment fired preparation fires for another attack against the Kriemhilde Stellung, and then transitioned to a rolling barrage at 0725 to support the infantry's attack at 0730 hours. On 16 October, the regiment continued to deliver preparation and rolling barrage, and the fired against a German counterattack at 1100 hours. In the afternoon, a German plan was downed by machine gun fire, with credit claimed by Battery C, 320th, as well as the batteries of 2/321st Field Artillery. On 17 October, Lieutenant Durrett was killed by German shell fire. After a lull in the fighting, the 1/320th was withdrawn to rearward positions on the night of 21‚Äì22 October, and conditions settled into \\"stabilized warfare\\" until 1 November, with light harassing schedules at night, and close liaison maintained with the infantry for on-call missions. From 26‚Äì31 October, the regiment moved a gun from each battery forward to conduct adjustments in preparation for a new offensive, scheduled for 1 November. The rest of the batteries moved forward on the night of 30‚Äì31 October. participated in a three-stage preparation from 0330 hours. During the night of 1‚Äì2 November, the 320th (and the other battalions of the 157th Brigade) moved forward into a between the 319th and 320th Infantries, and suffered heavy artillery and machine gun fire while covering the gap with their battery anti-aircraft machine guns. On the morning of 2 November, the attack resumed at 0800 hours, and the 321st moved forward and established a regimental command post in the town of Imecourt. Due to poor roads which limited the availability of ammunition resupply, the 320th remained stationary to allow resupply to the 321st. On 3 November, the regiment moved to positions north of Sivry-lez-Buzancy. While moving forward again on 4 November, the Regimental Commander ordered 1st Battalion into action at about 1100 hours against machine gun positions that were delaying the infantry advance. At 1500 hours, the 2nd Battalion also emplaced, and at 1600 hours, the entire regiment delivered a rolling barrage in support of the 318th Infantry, delivering 2600 rounds during 80 minutes of firing. On the morning of 5 November, the 320th relieved the 321st and moved forward with both battalions in close support of the infantry. At 1100 hours, 2/320th occupied southwest of Beaumont and fired at machine gun positions near La Thibaudine Ferme and La Harnot Erie Ferme in support of the 317th Infantry, and later in the afternoon, Battery B occupied south of the Stonne-Beaumont Road and fired on the village of Yoncq. After nightfall, the regiment fired another 500 rounds at Yoncq. This was the last \\"considerable firing\\" done by the regiment before moving to Sivry-Imecourt-St. Juvin (8-9 November), Monblainvill-Apremont (10 November) and Les Islettes, where it received news of the armistice on 11 November.

He attended schools in Albany and graduated from Hamilton College in 1886. Upon leaving college he read law with the Hon. John D. Teller of Auburn, New York, and acted as Clerk of the Surrogate's Court of Cayuga County, New York from 1887 to 1889. In 1888 he was admitted to the New York State Bar Association. In 1891 he went to Buffalo, New York and engaged there in the practice of the law. In 1895 he married Miss Katherine Tremain Bush, of Ithaca, New York. They had two surviving daughters, Katherine and Emily. He was appointed Referee in Bankruptcy in 1898 and was reappointed in 1900 and served in that capacity up to the time of his appointment as Superintendent of Insurance. He was regarded as an authority on bankruptcy laws and was president of the National Association of Referees in Bankruptcy. He is a lecturer on bankruptcy laws in law schools of Buffalo and New York, and in Cornell University. In 1907 Charles Evans Hughes appointed him a Commissioner for the Promotion of Uniformity of Legislation in the United States. With other Buffalo Republicans he made an inquiry regarding the operation of the primary election law of the State of New York and a report was drawn up which led to the introduction of a bill in the Legislature concerning the subject. In 1899 in association with Elihu Root and Paul D. Cravath of New York, Hotchkiss prepared the Primary Election Law of 1899.

Life and work }=Phi Odom garnered some recognition early in his career for his light machines made from fibre optics, that he exhibited at the Knoll International Gallery in Manhattan in the 1960s. Later his career faltered somewhat and he could not repeat his early success. Odom suffered from depressions which ultimately culminated in a suicide attempt and a subsequent hospitalization at the Hudson River Psychiatric Center in Poughkeepsie, where he became a permanent resident starting in the early 1980s. Odom became interested in geometry after visiting an exhibition by Buckminster Fuller in the 1960s. In the mid 1970s he contacted the Canadian geometer Coxeter as he felt his art work was of some mathematical interest as well. This led to a longtime correspondence with Coxeter and another mathematician Magnus Wenninger, a monk from Minnesota, that spanned over several decades. The two mathematicians were among Odom's few regular contacts with the outside world after he had moved to the Hudson River Psychiatric Center, where he led a rather isolated life. Their correspondence was not only about mathematical topics, but also comprised matters of philosophy, psychology, religion and world affairs. In mathematics Odom was particularly interested in various geometric shapes and the golden ratio. He discovered the occurrence of the golden ratio in a few elementary geometrical figures, where it had not been noticed before. The two mathematicians communicated Odom's results to others in their lectures and conversations, and Coxeter incorporated them into some of his publications as well. Best known of these is the construction of the golden ratio with the help of an equilateral triangle and its circumcircle. Coxeter posed Odom's construction in the form of a problem, that was published 1983 in the American Mathematical Monthly as problem #E3007: :Let A and B be midpoints of the sides EF and ED of an equilateral triangle DEF. Extend AB to meet the circumcircle (of DEF) at C. Show that B divides AC according to the golden section }=Phi }=Phi Odom also found another construction of the golden ratio, that is based on an equilateral triangle: :Consider an equilateral triangle ABC with its altitude from C onto AB. Let D be the pedal point of the altitude on AB. Now extend the altitude CD beyond D by BD and denote the endpoint of the extension with E. The ray EA intersects the circle around D with radius CD in F and A divides now EF according to the golden section. Odom used 3-dimensional geometrical shapes in his artwork, which he examined for occurrences of the golden ratio as well. There he discovered two simple occurrences in platonic solids and their circumscribed spheres. The first occurrence requires connecting the midpoints A and B of 2 edges of a tetrahedron surface and extending this line on one side so that it intersects the circumscribed sphere at C; then B divides AC according to the golden section.

His music included folk, post-rock and experimental pop. He performed in Sweden, England, Italy and Spain, mainly performing acoustic renditions from his former band's repertoire and a few cover songs. While on the road, Caccese released an EP under his own name, featuring songs recorded in apartments, hotel rooms, trains and airports all over Europe in late 2010. With the help of Swedish cellist Nadja Ali, Caccese developed the EP into a full-length album, Our Rehearsed Spontaneous Reactions adopting \\"Songs for the Sleepwalkers\\" as a moniker. The album is a folk record with a lo-fi approach, featuring elements of electro, post rock, pop and prog.

History =World War I= Initially formed at Camp Gordon, Georgia, the 321st was part of the 82nd Division's 157th Field Artillery Brigade. On 5 September 1917, a small cadre of Regular Army non-commissioned officers and privates joined officer cadres that had reported on 29 August 1917 after graduating from the three batteries of the 7th Provisional Training Regiment. Draftees from Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee arrived over the next few weeks, but many of these men were transferred in November and replaced by new draftees from Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa and Minnesota and all the states east of the Mississippi River. Initially, the 321st's six firing batteries shared a single battery of 3-inch guns for training with the other 12 batteries in the brigade. In addition to approximately 10 hours use of the actual guns, the regiment's gun squads conducted training with replicas \\"crudely made structures fashioned from the trunks of small trees, tin cans, spools, gas pipes and any available material.\\" A second battery of guns arrived in December, and from December 1917 through May 1918, the regiment conducted firing practice at Blackjack Mountain near Marietta, Georgia. During the training period, the 321st was designated as a motorized unit, causing a personnel shuffle and additional training in engine maintenance (mostly done without actual equipment!). Battery D of the 321st Field Artillery at Camp Gordon, GA, ca. 1917 Beginning 8 May 1918, the regiment moved by train to Camp Mills, New York, and then shipped to Liverpool, England on the ship Cretic, arriving on 31 May 1918. After a brief stop, the regiment crossed the English Channel from Southampton to Le Havre, France and then moved by train to La Courtine. There, the 321st was fully equipped with 75mm guns and conducted two months of training, culminating in a brigade live fire. From 5‚Äì10 August, the 321st moved into a reserve position behind Chateau Thierry, but was not employed and moved by train to Toul. The 321st detached its 1st Battalion to the 89th Division, while 2nd Battalion occupied defensive positions in the Marbache sector with the 157th/82nd. In preparation for the St. Mihiel Offensive, the 2nd Battalion rejoined the 321st, and the regiment moved into forward gun positions constructed with the assistance of the division's infantry. Beginning at 0100hrs on 12 September 1918, the 321st participated in a four-hour preparation, consisting of counter-battery fires on 16 German batteries and other positions. After the offensive started, the regiment also fired on \\"fugitive targets\\", and Battery C destroyed a German airplane that had made a forced landing. On 13 September, the 321st and its sister 320th Field Artillery fired 10000 rounds in support of a raid by the 327th Infantry in the Bois Frehaut. The result of the St. Mihiel operation was \\"the establishment of confidence, born of performance\\" throughout the 157th Brigade. After relief on 20 September and assembling near Marbache, the 321st spent the nights of 22‚Äì25 September moving to Beauzee, arriving on the morning of 26 September. On 26 September, the regiment moved to bivouac's near Futeau in the Argonne Forest, remaining there until 5 October. At 1300 hours on 5 October 1918, the 157th received orders for an attack at 0500 hours the next morning. Colonel Deems and four officers arrived at the brigade headquarters at 1630 hours, conducted a hurried reconnaissance of battalion areas near l'Esperance Farm and established a regimental command post at Chaudron Farm, with the 320th Field Artillery's command post. The regiment departed its bivouac at 1530 hours, but poor roads and miscommunications delayed its movements, and the first battery began firing at 0520 hours, while it was 0800 hours before the regiment's last battery arrived and emplaced. After participating in a truncated preparation due to the late arrival, the regiment fired in support of the infantry throughout the day. At 1800 hours, the 321st, joined by the 2nd Battalion, 320th Field Artillery in repelling a German counterattack against the 164th Infantry Brigade. Defensive and harassing fire continued through the night of 6‚Äì7 October. 7 October was spent in establishing observation posts and telephone communications in the new positions. On 8, 9 and 10 October, the 321st fired rolling barrages to support attacks by the 164th Infantry Brigade's 327th and 328th Infantry Regiments. During the night of 10 October, the 321st moved to new positions southeast of Fleville, to support the 163rd Infantry Brigade. During this attack, from 10‚Äì22 October, a forward gun from Battery E, 321st, under 1st Lieutenant Prentiss Edwards, closely supported the 326th Infantry, destroying at least 8 machine gun positions and killing at least 20 Germans with 657 rounds. On 14‚Äì19 October, the 321st fired a rolling barrage in support of a First Army \\"general attack\\" toward the Kriemhilde Stellung positions. On the afternoon of 16 October, the 157th Brigade's machine guns shot down a German airplane, Battery C, 320th Field Artillery and all three batteries of 2nd Battalion, 321st claiming the kill. On the night of 21‚Äì22 October, the 1st Battalion, 321st withdrew to new positions, and the regiment settled into a period of \\"stabilized warfare\\" until 1 November. During this period, the regiment fires light harassing schedules at night and continued close support missions to the infantry. Beginning 26 October, the battalion moved one gun per battery into forward positions and conducted adjustments in preparation for a new offensive, scheduled for 1 November. The rest of the batteries moved forward on the night of 30‚Äì31 October. During the attack, Batteries E and F of the 321st were assigned as \\"accompanying batteries\\" to the 160th Infantry Brigade's 319th and 320th Infantry regiments. The remainder of the 321st participated in a three- stage preparation from 0330 hours. During the night of 1‚Äì2 November, the 321st (and the other battalions of the 157th Brigade) moved forward into a between the 319th and 320th Infantries, and suffered heavy artillery and machine gun fire while covering the gap with their battery anti-aircraft machine guns. On the morning of 2 November, the attack resumed at 0800 hours, and the 321st moved forward and established a regimental command post in the town of Imecourt. Due to poor roads which limited the availability of ammunition resupply, the 321st, with 3/319th attached, was chosen to receive the division's ammunition resupply and continue forward in support of the 159th Infantry Brigade. The 2/321 assigned two accompanying guns to the brigade's two infantry regiments, but had difficulty acquiring targets due to the lack of German resistance. On 4 November, the 321st continued to follow the infantry forward, remaining about 2-3000 yards behind the front line. On the morning of 5 November, the 320th relieved the 321st, which did no further \\"considerable firing\\" before moving to Sivry-Imecourt-St. Juvin (8‚Äì9 November), Monblainvill-Apremont (10 November) and Les Islettes, where it received news of the armistice on 11 November. The entire 157th Brigade remained near Les Islettes until 18 November, and then moved to Ste. Menehould before regjoining the 82nd Division in the Tenth Training area.Pennypacker, Captain J.

Motto NOLI ME TANGERE (Don't Tread On Me). Symbolism * Shield The shield is scarlet for Artillery. The lion's paws are significant of Field Artillery, which may be likened to a mountain lion whose paw has great strength and power in felling and crushing a victim. * Crest The lion with one head facing forward and the other backward, brandishing a round in both directions, refers to the organization's claim to have been the unit of the 101st Airborne Division to fire the first and the last rounds on German soil. The winged cannon stands for the former designation of the organization as a Glider Field Artillery Battalion and its assignment during World War II to the 101st Airborne Division. The red and blue escutcheon is from the arms of Bastogne; the annulet represents the enemy encirclement of that objective and refers to the unit's distinguished action in its defense during World War II. The three fleurs-de-lis stand for the organization's first war service, i.e., participation in three campaigns in France during World War I.

It is situated around half a mile Northwest of The Hurlers (stone circles). Description The circle consists of sixteen fallen stones with one remaining possible stump, all considerably overgrown making it one of the harder circles to find on the moor. John Barnatt has suggested that the circle was situated so that the summit of Brown Willy marked the midsummer sunset. It is nearby to Craddock Moor stone row and an embanked enclosure. Christopher Tilley noted what he called a \\"possible axis of movement\\" linking the stone row, an embanked enclosure, the circle and the Hurlers. As these cannot be seen from each other, he commented \\"It is difficult to imagine how such a striking alignment could occur purely by chance.\\" Archaeology One of the first archaeological surveys of Bodmin Moor, including Craddock Moor Circle was carried out c. 1800 by Nicholas Johnson and Peter Rose. Folklore Chris Barber and David Pykitt suggested that Craddock Moor is named after the ancient British King of Arthurian legend Caradoc who has been linked to the Pendragon Caractacus who fought the Romans.

A total of nine candidates ran for the presidency, whilst 16 political parties contested the National Assembly elections. Hage Geingob of the ruling SWAPO party, won the presidential elections with 87% of the vote. SWAPO also won the National Assembly elections, taking 80% of the vote. Presidential election =Candidates= Originally, incumbent President Pohamba predicted that twenty-two candidates would contest the presidential election. In the end, only nine political parties submitted presidential candidates. =SWAPO= In 2008, the SWAPO Central Committee produced a policy document stating that the party's candidate would be chosen for each election among the top four Committee members. In March 2011 SWAPO declared that whoever was the party's vice-president following the forthcoming party elections would also be the party's candidate in 2014 for president. Some high-level party members, particularly Kazenambo Kazenambo, advocated that SWAPO choose a non-Ovambo candidate, as the first two Presidents, Sam Nujoma and Pohamba, were from the Ovambo people. Others advocated the selection of a woman. SWAPO indicated that the candidate would be chosen democratically in the 2012 party election.Presidential race thrown wide open New Era, 14 March 2011 SWAPO was viewed as the clear favorite going into the election. Parliamentary election SWAPO announced a gender equality system where women would fill half of their seats in parliament. The party also embraced what it called a \\"zebra system\\", whereby if a minister was a woman, the deputy minister would be a man, and vice versa. Because there were more male SWAPO MPs than female MPs, SWAPO put forward plans to expand parliament to remove the risk of male MPs losing their seats as a result of this gender policy.Namibia's 'zebra' politics could make it stand out from the global herd The Guardian, 8 July 2014 These changes to the constitution were approved a month prior to the election against the votes of opposition parties, as SWAPO had a two-thirds majority in Parliament.

According to tradition, the Rood was brought to Boxley Abbey on a stray horse. Considering that a miracle, the monks of the abbey took the crucifix. William Lambarde, in his 1570 book, Perambulation of Kent, describes how the Rood was created by an English carpenter taken prisoner by the French in order to ransom himself. According to various reports, the Rood was able to move, shed tears, foam at the mouth, turn and nod its head, and make various facial expressions.Kara Reilly, \\"Automata and Mimesis on the Stage of Theatre History\\" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011) p 20; 23 After the dissolution of the monasteries, the Rood was paraded around various market towns, including Maidstone, Kent. On 12 February 1538 John Hilsey, Bishop of Rochester, denounced the Rood of Grace as a fraud, exhibited its machinery and broke it to pieces.Robert Hutchinson, Thomas Cromwell (2007), pp. 162-163. The Rood was eventually burned in London along with numerous other statues of Roman Catholic saints. According to Reilly, sermons and reports by the Protestant iconoclasts who attacked the Rood presumed that the Catholic authorities were misrepresenting the Rood; however, \\"Catholic audiences had seen mechanical theatrical mirabilia or miracles in the medieval cycle plays for generations.\\" (Reilly notes an animated serpent winding around the tree in the garden, mechanical jaws of hell, and cords used to make a dove descend at Pentecost).Kara Reilly, \\"Automata and Mimesis on the Stage of Theatre History\\" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011) p. 21 The Protestant iconoclasts who presented the Rood as a fraud perpetuated by deceitful monks on gullible followers stood to gain politically from spreading that version of the story, yet Groeneveld argues the Rood was, in its time, \\"acknowledged, even advertised, to be a mechanical marvel\\".Leanne Groeneveld, '\\"A Theatrical Miracle: The Boxley Rood of Grace as Puppet,\\" Early Theatre 10.2 (2007):11 References Further reading * English Reformation Dissolution of the Monasteries Fraud in England Statues of Jesus Catholic pilgrimage sites 1538 in England 1538 disestablishments in England ","title":"Rood of Grace"},{"id":"31232003","text":"Astro is a contract bridge bidding convention used to intervene over an opponent's one notrump (1NT) opening bid.

Drumlane () is the name given to a townland situated near the village of Milltown, area 85.76 hectares (211.93 acres), set in a rich fertile landscape of County Cavan, Ireland. The Drumlane name denotes the drumlin region of low hilly ribbed moraines formed over a limestone bedrock created by the movement of glacial ice and melt water during the last Ice Age. Several townlands in this neighbourhood are prefixed with the word 'Drum', while several others are prefixed with the word 'Derry' which is Irish for Oak-wood, giving us a clear description of the local natural terrain before human habitation. History There is recorded evidence of people living and farming around the neighbourhood of Drumlane for over two thousand years. This is seen mainly on maps and on land in the form of ringforts and enclosures. While in the nearby Derrybrick lough there are the remains of crannogs which are man made islands used for living accommodation. The most profoundly unique feature of this countryside comes in the form of a ruined Augustinian monastic church and round tower. The early Christian site at Drumlane is said to date back to Saint Columba around c555 AD. Afterwards Drumlane was regarded locally as one of St. Maedoc of Ferns churches (known locally as St. Mogue) from whom many miraculous stories and legends arise. Significant Church developments started to take place throughout Ireland during the twelfth century with the reforming of diocese and the creation of archbishoprics at Armagh and Cashel. A Synod of Kells in 1152 began further changes where the Kingdom of Breifni became the new Tir Briuin diocese boundary stretched from Kells in Meath to Sligo. Drumlane being the midpoint of the new Breifne Tir Briuin Diocese to come under the jurisdiction of the Abbot of Kells order of Augustinian Canons regular St. Mary's Abbey of Kells. Drumlane priory was called afterwards St. Mary's Drumlane until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid sixteenth century.Drumlane.ie ‚Äì Droim Leathain, Drumlane Monastery Notable historic events went recorded in the Annals of the Four Masters and in the Annals of Clonmacnoise, that in 836 AD Drumlane was attacked by Viking raiders along with other abbeys at Devenish Island on the river Erne. Clones abbey was also attacked during these raids. The King of Breifne Tighearnan O'Ruairc (1124‚Äì1172) gave patronage to the early diocese, But in 1246 it went recorded that Drumlane church was burned during a feud between rival Breifne clans O'Rourke lords of West Breifne and the O'Reillys of East Breifne. Significant also then that Drumlane was once a town on the border line between east and west Breifne, also burial grounds for O'Rourke and O'Reilly clan chiefs. Battles at Drumlane also took place in 1261 between the O'Conors kings of Breifne and Hugh O'Reilly, followed by further battles in 1314 and 1338 where the O'Conors defeated the O'Reilly clan. Peace was restored in 1391 between all rival factions. In 1431 Papal records describe alms needed to rebuild Drumlane abbey with cloisters and a refectory. Then in 1436 the Pope appointed Patrick O'Farrelly as Canon (Coarb) of St. Mary's Drumlane priory then a dependency under the Abbey of Kells. An interesting charter of 19 September 1438 exists which grants the erenaghship of Drumlane to Nicholas O'Farrelly. Feuding within the O'Reilly clan continued, whereas in 1487 Edmund and Fergal O'Reilly attacked Clogh Oughter castle, occupied by their uncle John O'Reilly. Retribution came swiftly and Fergal was killed (buried at Drumlane) and Drumlane town where Edmund O'Reilly lived (according to the annals) was burned in punishment. O'Reilly clan feuds around Drumlane continued in 1512, while the last mention from papal records was in 1538 before the priory and church was confiscated by Queen Elizabeth I and granted to Hugh O'Reilly under lease. However the O'Reillys still carried out their depredations as we find a raid on Drumlane c.1570 by Toirdhealbhach, nicknamed 'An Pri√≥ir Balbh', the illegitimate son of the chief, Aodh Conallach O'Reilly.'A Genealogical History of the O'Reillys', by James Carney, (Cavan, 1959), page 81, section 8 Later to be taken over by the reformed Anglican Diocese of Kilmore and used for Protestant church worship while the priory buildings were left to decay. A new church called St. Columba's was erected by the Church of Ireland by 1821 and the old Drumlane church was then un-roofed and abandoned. Drumlane architecture The original monastic structures at Drumlane were built from wood gathered from the nearby oak forests, having deteriorated over centuries of weather and raids from Vikings and rival clans. During the twelfth century, when under Augustinian monastic jurisdiction the entire structure was rebuilt using local stone to a traditional Gaelic Irish church design, using styles similar to many other monastic buildings in Connacht and elsewhere. The craftsmanship used in constructing the round tower was a key statement of prestige for its time, that perhaps the O'Rourke kings of Breifne wanted to create 'pride of place' within the new Breifne Tir Briuin diocese. Other building works probably came from donations paid by prominent local farmers and pilgrims to view St. Mogues relics at Drumlane. From the mid twelfth century Drumlane priory came under Augustinian Canons jurisdiction from the abbot of St. Mary's abbey in Kells. The Drumlane church was a basic nave and screened chancel measuring (inside) 32.6 metres long by 7.6 metres wide. There is evidence of various stages of construction and significant modifications over the centuries, from the late twelfth and early thirteenth century became a 'Transition' period, when late stages of Hiberno Romanesque style architecture gave way to the English Gothic styles being introduced to church construction all around the country. Typical twelfth century works can be seen in the construction of the doors and windows of the round tower using rounded head openings. The west doorway of the church is similar round-headed fashioned with dog-tooth design typical of several twelfth century churches. The windows and doorways in the south and north walls come from a later period using medieval arched forms, while some are hooded (original English style) Gothic design which became popular from the early thirteenth century. The tall three light east window design is set with the remains of flamboyant tracery (probably 15th century). On the outside, set beside the east window there are the carved heads of a bearded king and his queen (perhaps 12th century benefactors of the church) along with the head of a bishop or abbot. Fragments of decorative masonry remain within the church and outside include the remains of medieval pillars and a richly carved 'impost' that could have supported an arched cloister or screen structure. Another richly carved stone believed to be a tomb slab stands inside the church against the north wall. There are tomb niches located in the south wall, also a Romanesque style doorway chevron fragment (c1170), which perhaps could have come from the priory building once located about two hundred metres south from the church. Drumlane Round Tower shows signs that it was built or rebuilt in two stages. The symbolic stone structure which stands beside the church and is the only remaining round tower in the Church of Ireland Diocese of Kilmore.Eircom.net Milltown History Today the buttressed ruin of Drumlane church with its round tower standing 11.6 metres tall and 15.8 metres around the base circumference represents a significant structure of the monastic period, while little remains today of the old priory buildings which fell into decay after the dissolution of the monasteries in around 1538. The abbey church was then used for Anglican worship until around 1820 before becoming abandoned and allowed to decay. All structures now come under the care and stewardship of the OPW state agency and open to visitors. The cemetery meanwhile is still in use and is maintained by local parish communities.

Deaf studies are academic disciplines concerned with the study of the deaf social life of human groups and individuals. These constitute an interdisciplinary field that integrates contents, critiques, and methodologies from anthropology, cultural studies, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, social studies, and sociology, among others. The field focuses on the language, culture, and lives of the deaf from the social instead of the medical perspective. Deaf studies are also described as those comprising the scientific study of the deaf-related aspects of the world.Deaf studies, From Which Course?, 30.6, Friday, 1 February 2008  Background  Deaf studies emerged with the recognition that deaf people have a culture and that such culture is unique, requiring alternative ways of understanding this segment of the population outside of pathological frameworks. The University of Bristol began using the term \\"deaf studies\\" in 1984 after the founding of the Centre for Deaf Studies in 1968. Scholars began identifying themselves with the field, particularly after degree-granting programs in Deaf Studies began to emerge in the United Kingdom and the United States from the late 1970s to the 1980s. The first master's degree on Deaf Studies was introduced at the University of Bristol in 1992.  Areas  Studying the lives of those who are deaf include learning about their culture, sign language, history and their human rights. Being involved in \\"Deaf Studies\\" means focusing on the sociological, historical and linguistic aspects of the deaf and hearing impaired. Within this, it prepares individuals to work with the deaf and hearing impaired. Those who participate and join this field of study are involved with promoting the change of views and perspectives of the larger society regarding Deaf people. Becoming involved in the Deaf Community takes a while, but the time and effort goes a long way.

Between 1977 and 1987, the share fell drastically from 96% to 66%, and that of banks and other institutions rose from 3% to 36%. The major lenders include building societies, banks, specialized mortgage corporations, insurance companies and pension funds. During the four years after the financial crisis of 2008, the UK mutual sector provided approximately 80% of net lending to the housing market.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/11809109/Nationwide- boss-slams-Government-bank-tax-as-missed-opportunity.html There are currently over 200 significant separate financial organizations supplying mortgage loans to house buyers in Britain, with Lloyds Bank and the Nationwide Building Society having the largest market share.  Mortgage lenders  Over the years, the share of the new mortgage loans market held by building societies has declined. Between 1977 and 1987, it fell drastically from 96% to 66% while that of banks and other institutions rose from 3% to 36%. The banks and other institutions that made major inroads into the mortgage market during this period were helped by such factors as: * relative managerial efficiency; * advanced technology, organizational capabilities, and expertise in marketing; * extensive branch networks; and * capacities to tap cheaper international sources of funds for lending.The Mortgage Loans Industry and Market: A Survey, ISR/Google Books, third rev. edn. 2008, page 16. By the early 1990s, UK building societies had succeeded in greatly slowing if not reversing the decline in their market share. In 1990, the societies held over 60% of all mortgage loans but took over 75% of the new mortgage market ‚Äì mainly at the expense of specialized mortgage loans corporations. Building societies also increased their share of the personal savings deposits market in the early 1990s at the expense of the banks ‚Äì attracting 51% of this market in 1990 compared with 42% in 1989.CSO Financial Statistics and Building Societies Commission annual reports, London One study found that in the five years 1987-1992, the building societies collectively outperformed the UK clearing banks on practically all the major growth and performance measures. The societies' share of the new mortgage loans market of 75% in 1990-91 was similar to the share level achieved in 1985. Profitability as measured by return on capital was 17.8% for the top 20 societies in 1991, compared with only 8.5% for the big four banks. Finally, bad debt provisions relative to advances were only 0.4% for the top 20 societies compared with 2.8% for the four banks.Building Societies Research: Investing for the Next Millennium, UBS Phillips and Drew, London, 1992. (Quoted in The Mortgage Loans Industry and Market: A Survey) Though the building societies did subsequently recover a significant amount of the mortgage lending business lost to the banks, they still only had about two-thirds of the total market at the end of the 1980s. However, banks and building societies were by now becoming increasingly similar in terms of their structures and functions. When the Abbey National building society converted into a bank in 1989, this could be regarded either as a major diversification of a building society into retail banking ‚Äì or as significantly increasing the presence of banks in the residential mortgage loans market. Research organization Industrial Systems Research has observed that trends towards the increased integration of the financial services sector have made comparison and analysis of the market shares of different types of institution increasingly problematical. It identifies as major factors making for consistently higher levels of growth and performance on the part of some mortgage lenders in the UK over the years: * the introduction of new technologies, mergers, structural reorganization and the realization of economies of scale, and generally increased efficiency in production and marketing operations ‚Äì insofar as these things enable lenders to reduce their costs and offer more price-competitive and innovative loans and savings products; * buoyant retail savings receipts, and reduced reliance on relatively expensive wholesale markets for funds (especially when interest rates generally are being maintained at high levels internationally); * lower levels of arrears, possessions, bad debts, and provisioning than competitors; * increased flexibility and earnings from secondary sources and activities as a result of political-legal deregulation; and * being specialized or concentrating on traditional core, relatively profitable mortgage lending and savings deposit operations.The Mortgage Loans Industry and Market: A Survey, pages 15-16  Mortgage types  The UK mortgage market is one of the most innovative and competitive in the world. There is little intervention in the market by the state or state funded entities and virtually all borrowing is funded by either mutual organisations (building societies and credit unions) or proprietary lenders (typically banks). Since 1982, when the market was substantially deregulated, there has been substantial innovation and diversification of strategies employed by lenders to attract borrowers. This has led to a wide range of mortgage types. As lenders derive their funds either from the money markets or from deposits, most mortgages revert to a variable rate, either the lender's standard variable rate or a tracker rate, which will tend to be linked to the underlying Bank of England (BoE) repo rate (or sometimes LIBOR). Initially they will tend to offer an incentive deal to attract new borrowers. This may be: * A fixed rate; where the interest rate remains constant for a set period; typically for 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 years. Longer term fixed rates (over 5 years) whilst available, tend to be more expensive and/or have more onerous early repayment charges and are therefore less popular than shorter term fixed rates. * A capped rate; where similar to a fixed rate, the interest rate cannot rise above the cap but can vary beneath the cap. Sometimes there is a collar associated with this type of rate which imposes a minimum rate. Capped rate are often offered over periods similar to fixed rates, e.g. 2, 3, 4 or 5 years. * A discount rate; where there is set margin reduction in the standard variable rate (e.g. a 2% discount) for a set period; typically 1 to 5 years. Sometimes the discount is expressed as a margin over the base rate (e.g. BoE base rate plus 0.5% for 2 years) and sometimes the rate is stepped (e.g. 3% in year 1, 2% in year 2, 1% in year three). * A cashback mortgage; where a lump sum is provided (typically) as a percentage of the advance e.g. 5% of the loan. These rates are sometimes combined: For example, 4.5% 2 year fixed then a 3-year tracker at BoE rate plus 0.89%. With each incentive the lender may be offering a rate at less than the market cost of the borrowing. Therefore, they typically impose a penalty if the borrower repays the loan within the incentive period or a longer period (referred to as an extended tie-in). These penalties used to be called a redemption penalty or tie-in, however since the onset of Financial Services Authority regulation they are referred to as an early repayment charge. = Self-certification = These types of mortgages were banned from April 2014 for UK lenders. Although they haven't been banned completely by the UK regulator as they are available from European lenders. Self-certification mortgages, informally known as \\"self cert\\" mortgages, were available to employed and self-employed people who have a deposit to buy a house but lack sufficient documentation to prove their income. This type of mortgage was typically used by people whose income came from multiple sources, whose salary consisted largely or exclusively of commissions or bonuses, or whose accounts did not show a true reflection of their earnings. Accounts not showing a true reflection of earnings could have been due to undeclared (typically cash) income, for example, tips paid to those working in the hospitality industry or taxi drivers receiving cash payments. Self-employed people exaggerating expenses to lower taxable income created another group of applicants for self- certification mortgages. These mortgages had two disadvantages: the interest rates charged were usually higher than for normal mortgages and the loan to value ratio was usually lower. Since their abolition, there has been a common misconception that self-employed mortgages are now unobtainable. Whilst it's true the restrictions placed have left many creditworthy self-employed borrowers unable to finance, it has created niche markets for newly self- employed or borrowers who chose not to draw all their profits, that are now occupied by numerous specialist lenders. = 100% mortgages = When a bank lends money to a customer, they want to minimise the risk of not getting the money back. They manage the risk through their lending criteria, carrying out checks on the applicant and the property and also by asking the borrower to fund a certain percentage of the property purchase in the form of a deposit. The higher the deposit, the lower the mortgage amount, so lower the risk of not being able to recover the loan when selling the property in case of a repossession. 100% mortgages are mortgages that require no deposit (100% loan to value). Examples include: * some first-time buyer deals, when perhaps a portion of the loan is secured against a parent's property; * concessionary purchase (inter-family property transaction), when the purchase is at below market value; * Right to Buy purchase at a discounted purchase price; * Shared Ownership purchase 100% mortgages normally offer higher interest rates than deals with even just 5-10% deposit. = Together/Plus mortgages = A development of the theme of 100% mortgages was represented by Together/Plus type mortgages, which stopped after the 2007-2008 financial crash. Together/Plus Mortgages represented loans of 100% or more of the property value - typically up to a maximum of 125%. Such loans were normally (but not universally) structured as a package of a 95% mortgage and an unsecured loan of up to 30% of the property value. This structure was mandated by lenders' capital requirements which required additional capital for loans of 100% or more of the property value. The mortgage part was typically on an interest only basis, while the unsecured loan was on a repayment basis. This meant that when making monthly payments, only the balance for the unsecured part would reduce. This arrangement often resulted in the borrowers becoming \\"mortgage prisoners\\" after the lenders stopped operating (for example Northern Rock), property prices were not rising and the customers were (or still are) unable to remortgage (due to the high loan to value) or sell their property. If they sold the property, the sale price would not cover the mortgage and the unsecured loan, so they would be left without a home and still carry some debt. = Contractor Mortgages = Contractor mortgages were developed for two specific types of independent contractors. First, contractors in the UK who incorporate a limited company to use as a payment structure. Second, contractors who likewise operate through a Ltd company payment structure, but do so via PAYE Umbrella companies. The underwriting criteria that banks and building societies use for this type of mortgage loan is \\"contract-based underwriting\\".BlueWing Financials  Contractor Mortgage This is expressly different from traditional PAYE \\"employee\\", or even self-employed, affordability criteria. These are still ‚Ä≤prime rate‚Ä≤ mortgages and normally available via any broker, although some brokers may not have enough knowledge or experience to source the most suitable deal for the customer. In comparison, if a contractor customer goes directly to a lender who offers contract rate based underwriting, the lender's advisor often insists on assessing income based on Ltd company accounts. The demand for contractor- specific mortgages has risen since the credit crunch. Since 2015, mortgage lenders have added contractor mortgages to their offering at unprecedented levelsFreelancer Financials  Contractor Mortgage Lenders to accommodate the surging gig economy in the UK.Office For National Statistics  Trends in self- employment in the UK February 2018  UK mortgage process  Arrangement fees and survey fees are components of the Cost of moving house in the United Kingdom. Typically, would-be borrowers approach their bank for a single range of products, or use an intermediary (mortgage broker) for access to a select panel of lenders, or the whole market. The first stage is to complete a full fact find. The advisor will then search for the right deal for the customer, and then proceed to get an agreement in principle from the lender. Although an indication of lending approval, this is not set in stone until the mortgage is formally offered, post valuation of the property and assessment of the necessary supporting documents. =Arrangement fees= UK lenders usually charge a fee for setting up the mortgage. =Valuation Fee= The arrangement fee will be followed by a valuation fee, which pays for a chartered surveyor to visit the property and ensure it is worth enough to cover the mortgage amount. This is not a full survey so it may not identify all the defects that a house buyer needs to know about. It does not usually form a contract between the surveyor and the buyer, so the buyer has no right to sue in contract if the survey fails to detect a major problem. However, the buyer may have a remedy against the surveyor in tort.Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors =Survey Fee= For an extra fee, the surveyor can usually carry out a building survey or a (cheaper) \\"homebuyers survey\\" at the same time. International comparisons In the UK, fixed-rate mortgage options are as common as in the United States. Home ownership rates are comparable to the United States, but overall default rates are lower. In the UK, mortgage loan financing relies less on securitized assets (such as mortgage-backed securities) than the United States, Denmark, and Germany, and more on deposits like Australia and Spain, since funds raised by building societies must be at least 50% deposits. Lenders would prefer variable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages to reduce potential interest rate risks between what they charging in mortgage interest and what they are paying in interest for deposits and other funding sources, but borrowers usually prefer payment stability, even if for a short term of 2 years. Prepayment penalties (Early Repayment Charges - ERC) are still common, whilst the United States has discouraged their use. Like other European countries, and the rest of the world, but unlike most of the United States, mortgage loans are usually recourse debt: debtors are liable for any loan deficiencies after foreclosure (or \\"repossession\\" in the UK).

It was the first private television station in Benghazi, in the east of the country. The channel's purpose is to provide the world with news and exclusive on-ground footage from Benghazi during the civil war. Libya Alhurra TV was the only TV broadcast from Benghazi when Muammar Gaddafi shut down Internet lines as the war began.

The historic preservation movement began in the city of Davenport in the mid-1970s with the renovation of several historic structures. A comprehensive study of the city's neighborhoods, districts and architecture was begun in 1978. The study was conducted in three phases. The first two phases were carried out from 1979 to 1982 and the third phase from 1982 to 1983. The results were published in two volumes. Davenport‚ÄîWhere the Mississippi Runs West reported on the first two phases and Davenport Architecture‚ÄîTradition and Transition reported on the third phase. A Multiple Resource nomination was submitted to the National Register of Historic Places that included 12 districts, more than 1,650 buildings on 350 parcels. By March 1985 all the districts and 249 properties were listed on the national register. The Historic Preservation Commission was established in 1992, and the historic preservation ordinance was passed the same year. Davenport became a Certified Local Government in the state of Iowa. It was now responsible to review local projects participating in state and national preservation programs. It was also able to exercise some control over the modification and/or demolition of historic buildings in the city. The historic preservation ordinance also allowed the establishment of a local register of historic properties. The first four properties were added in 1992. As of 2016, there are 56 properties listed, of which 26 are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and 14 are contributing properties in a national historic district on the National Register.

Three Palestinian militants who infiltrated to Israel from Egypt attacked a synagogue full of children and teenagers, in the farming community of Kfar Chabad (Shafrir). Six people, five children and a youth worker, were killed. The attack A Palestinian Arab fedayeen squad infiltrated Israel from Egypt. They entered the village of Kfar Chabad (Shafrir) during the evening of 11 April 1956. One waited by the escape vehicle, another cut the electricity to the synagogue, plunging the interior into darkness, and the third entered the synagogue and fired into the crowd of 46 children aged 9‚Äì16 inside at the time. Five children and an instructor were killed. Five children were injured, three of them in serious condition. A group of village men gathered firearms kept in a small defense locker and rushed to the school, arriving about five minutes after the attack began, but by that time, the shooting had stopped and the perpetrators had made their escape. The police were called with the village's only telephone, and the only two vehicles in the village were used to take the wounded to the nearby Tzrifin Medical Center.https://www.chabad.org/news/article_cdo/aid/3866250/jewish/Murder-on-a- Moonless-Night-How-the-Rebbe-Responded-to-Terror-in-Israel.htm =Fatalities= {  * Albert Edery, 14, of LodAlbert Edery * Kamus Amos Uzan, 15, of ShafrirKamus Amos Uzan * Simcha Silberstrom, 25, a teacher from ShafrirSimcha Silberstrom  * Shlomo Mizrahi, 16, of ShafrirShlomo Mizrahi * Nisim Assis, 13, of JerusalemNisim Assis * Moshe Peretz, 14, of ShafrirMoshe Peretz } Aftermath Following the attack, the traumatized villagers began to seriously consider abandoning the settlement.

Life The nephew of John Angier, he was born at Dedham 28 August 1639, and was a pupil of Richard Busby. He went to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1659, but was compelled to leave by the Act of Uniformity 1662. After some time staying with John Owen he settled as assistant to his uncle at Denton. His ordination, which took place in 1672 at the house of Robert Eaton in Deansgate, Manchester, was the first presbyterian ordination amongst the nonconformists in the north of England, and perhaps the first in any part of the kingdom. At his uncle's death many people supported Samuel Angier as his successor. The warden and fellows of Manchester, however, were not disposed to appoint another nonconformist, and the Rev. John Ogden was nominated; but great difficulty was experienced in inducing Samuel Angier to give up possession of the house. He retired to the adjacent village of Dukinfield. He had to suffer for his nonconformity, and in 1680 was excommunicated; but under the Act of Toleration in 1689 he became minister of a dissenting meeting at Dukinfield, where a chapel was built for him in 1708. In his later years he was almost blind, and died 8 November 1713. Angier kept a register of 'christenings and some marriages and funerals' from 1677 to 1713. One entry relates to the death, 20 February 1698, of another Samuel Angier, who is believed to have been a minister of the 'ancient chapel' of Toxteth Park, Liverpool.

The battalion landed at Normandy in early July 1944 and saw continuous combat as corps artillery throughout the summer. Beginning in October 1944 it was located in Schoenberg, Belgium as part of the U.S. VIII Corps. The unit was partially overrun by Germans during the onset of the Battle of the Bulge on 17 December 1944. While most of the 333rd FA Battalion withdrew west towards Bastogne, in advance of the German assault, Service and C Batteries remained behind to cover the advance of the 106th Infantry Division. The two batteries suffered heavy casualties, and eleven men were massacred near the Belgian hamlet of Wereth. Batteries A, E, F, and G, all Target Acquisition sub-units, took part in the 1991 Gulf War respectively with the 1st Cavalry Division; the 210th Field Artillery Brigade; the 3rd Armored Division; and the 24th Infantry Division.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1960 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82306 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Jefferson in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Coast Guard Historian websiteScheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point Jefferson was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Jefferson included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scheina, p 72Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History After delivery in 1960, Point Jefferson was assigned a homeport of Nantucket, Massachusetts, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. On 18 August 1963, she towed MV Yankee with 149 on board to Provincetown, MA. From 18 October 1964 to 29 January 1965, she served on Cuban patrol. At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 72Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Jefferson was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 Point Jefferson was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Naval Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and .

In early 1970, Point Jefferson and Point Partridge acting as a team made over 300 boardings. Civic action programs conducted during the boardings by the two Squadron One cutters included handing out 3000 bars of soap as well as food items.

Its placement is under the College of Science of the university. It is the smallest department of the college with 10 teaching staff and around 210 students The Early Days As the first optometrist school in Ghana was started at the department of Physics, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in 1992. The first class had just five students and were under the tutelage of Ghana's first Optometrist, Dr. Kofivi Morny. It was opened to only to those who had had their first degrees in either Biochemistry, Physics or Biology. Graduates from the school were awarded the Postgraduate Diploma in Optometry (Pg. Dip. Optometry). Later On In 2003, the department moved from the Physics block to the Biology block. In 2002, a four-year Bachelor of Science Degree program, to be followed by a two-year doctoral program, was started to replace the earlier program. In 2003, when the last Pg. Dipl. in Optometrists graduated, there were 53 Optometrists in Ghana. In 2006, just as the first batch of Optometrists with the BSc. Degree had graduated, they were enrolled for the two-year Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) program. They went on to finish with their doctorate degrees in 2008. More than eighty percent of Ghanaian Optometrists have had their training from the KNUST. Currently In August 2010, the Department finally received its own permanent address as it moved into the multi-million cedi Science Complex Block. The department was allotted permanent classrooms and offices for students and staff members respectively. The 2011 batch who have yet to graduate have are fifty-three. Dr. Dr. Angela O. Amedo, a member of the first batch of Optometrists produced in Ghana, is the Head of Department for Optometry at KNUST. But currently the Head of Department of optometry and visual science is Dr. Nana Yaa Koomson. Today, there are about two hundred Optometrist in Ghana working hand-in-hand with other eyecare professionals to save sight. Staff of the Department As of January 2011, the Department had twelve members of staff overall, with 8 teachers, 2 secretaries, a janitorial custodian, and a driver. All members of teaching staff possess a Doctorate of Optometry. Currently four are pursuing other programs at the Masters level and one is pursuing a Doctorate of Philosophy. Social Responsibilities The Department in collaboration with the International Centre for Eyecare Education (now Brien Holden Vision Institute) in May, 2010 established an eye clinic at Ayeduase as a suburb of Kumasi. The center‚Äîcalled the Ashanti Vision Centre is to serve the community as well as the satellite towns that surround the university. Students go there regularly to build up their skills as well as offer their services to the numerous people who come for eyecare services. In November 2010 the whole sixth year class of the Department undertook a two-day intensive vision outreach program in the Atebubu district of the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana. In March 2011, volunteers from Vision Aid Overseas visited the Department to teach its students as well as embark on Outreaches to cocoa growing areas of the Ashanti Region.

The initial operation implemented a no-fly zone that was proposed during the Libyan Civil War to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi forces. On 19 March 2011, several countries prepared to take immediate military action at a summit in Paris. Operations commenced on the same day with a strike by French fighter jets, then US and UK forces conducting strikes from ships and submarines via 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles and air assets bombing Gaddafi forces near Benghazi. The goal of coalition forces was to impose a no-fly zone for Libyan government forces. The U.S. initially had strategic command of the military intervention, coordinated missions between coalition members and set up Joint Task Force Odyssey Dawn on for the tactical command and control in the area of operations. but passed complete military command of the operation to NATO and took up a support role on 31 March 2011. Prior to that, an agreement to pass command of the arms embargo to NATO was reached on 23 March, and a handover of enforcement of the no-fly zone to NATO was agreed to on 24 March and became effective the following day. With the handover of coalition command to NATO, Operation Odyssey Dawn remained the name for the activities of U.S. forces,Operation Odyssey Dawn GlobalSecurity.org and the coalition's objectives continued to be carried out under Operation Unified Protector.

At this point in the mission, the U.S. was responsible for 80% of air refueling, 75% of aerial surveillance hours and 100% of electronic warfare missions. =28 & 29 March= On 28 March, a USAF A-10 and a USN P-3 attacked a Libyan Coast Guard vessel and two smaller craft after U.S. forces observed them firing into Misurata and at merchant vessels. The P-3 fired AGM-65F Maverick missiles at the patrol boat Vittoria, forcing the crew to beach her. The A-10 strafed the other two smaller boats with its 30mm GAU-8 Avenger cannon rounds, sinking one and forcing the crew to abandon the other.

Forsvaret.dk (11 October 2011). Retrieved on 16 August 2013. Criticism There has been criticism over the handling of the operation and the belief that the Obama administration failed to adequately consult the U.S. Congress. The Obama administration defended its handling of the Libyan crisis, drawing a clear line between military and political objectives. On 24 March White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters \\"We are not engaged in militarily-driven regime change.\\" Instead, the administration is engaged in \\"time-limited, scope-limited\\" action with other countries to protect civilians from forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi. However, this conflicts with multiple statements seeming to imply regime change as at least one objective of the Operation, including a report made to Congress as required by House Resolution 292: > Establishing these conditions would pave the way for a genuine political > transition ‚Äì of which Qadhafi's departure is a critical component.

It has been used in analyses of industrial organization, macroeconomics, and political economy. It is a refinement of the concept of subgame perfect equilibrium to extensive form games for which a pay-off relevant state space can be identified. The term appeared in publications starting about 1988 in the work of economists Jean Tirole and Eric Maskin.Maskin E, Tirole J. A Theory of Dynamic Oligopoly, I: Overview and Quantity Competition with Large Fixed Costs. Econometrica 1988;56:549. Maskin and Maskin E, Tirole J. A Theory of Dynamic Oligopoly, II: Price Competition, Kinked Demand Curves, and Edgeworth Cycles. Econometrica 1988;56:571Maskin E, Tirole J. Markov Perfect Equilibrium. J Econ Theory 2001;100:191‚Äì219. Fudenberg D, Tirole J. Game Theory. 1991:603.  Definition  In extensive form games, and specifically in stochastic games, a Markov perfect equilibrium is a set of mixed strategies for each of the players which satisfy the following criteria: * The strategies have the Markov property of memorylessness, meaning that each player's mixed strategy can be conditioned only on the state of the game. These strategies are called Markov reaction functions. * The state can only encode payoff- relevant information. This rules out strategies that depend on non-substantive moves by the opponent. It excludes strategies that depend on signals, negotiation, or cooperation between the players (e.g. cheap talk or contracts). * The strategies form a subgame perfect equilibrium of the game.We shall define a Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) to be a subgame perfect equilibrium in which all players use Markov strategies. Eric Maskin and Jean Tirole. 2001. Markov Perfect Equilibrium . Journal of Economic Theory 100, 191-219. , available online at http://www.idealibrary.com Focus on symmetric equilibria  In symmetric games, when the players have a strategy and action sets which are mirror images of one another, often the analysis focuses on symmetric equilibria, where all players play the same mixed strategy. As in the rest of game theory, this is done both because these are easier to find analytically and because they are perceived to be stronger focal points than asymmetric equilibria.  Lack of robustness  Markov perfect equilibria are not stable with respect to small changes in the game itself. A small change in payoffs can cause a large change in the set of Markov perfect equilibria. This is because a state with a tiny effect on payoffs can be used to carry signals, but if its payoff difference from any other state drops to zero, it must be merged with it, eliminating the possibility of using it to carry signals.  Examples  For examples of this equilibrium concept, consider the competition between firms which have invested heavily into fixed costs and are dominant producers in an industry, forming an oligopoly. The players are taken to be committed to levels of production capacity in the short run, and the strategies describe their decisions in setting prices. The firms' objectives are modelled as maximizing the present discounted value of profits.Tirole (1988), p. 254 =Airfare game= Often an airplane ticket for a certain route has the same price on either airline A or airline B. Presumably, the two airlines do not have exactly the same costs, nor do they face the same demand function given their varying frequent-flyer programs, the different connections their passengers will make, and so forth. Thus, a realistic general equilibrium model would be unlikely to result in nearly identical prices. Both airlines have made sunk investments into the equipment, personnel, and legal framework, thus committing to offering service. They are engaged or trapped, in a strategic game with one another when setting prices. Consider the following strategy of an airline for setting the ticket price for a certain route. At every price-setting opportunity: * if the other airline is charging $300 or more, or is not selling tickets on that flight, charge $300 * if the other airline is charging between $200 and $300, charge the same price * if the other airline is charging $200 or less, choose randomly between the following three options with equal probability: matching that price, charging $300, or exiting the game by ceasing indefinitely to offer service on this route. This is a Markov strategy because it does not depend on a history of past observations. It satisfies also the Markov reaction function definition because it does not depend on other information which is irrelevant to revenues and profits. Assume now that both airlines follow this strategy exactly. Assume further that passengers always choose the cheapest flight and so if the airlines charge different prices, the one charging the higher price gets zero passengers. Then if each airline assumes that the other airline will follow this strategy, there is no higher-payoff alternative strategy for itself, i.e. it is playing a best response to the other airline strategy. If both airlines followed this strategy, it would form a Nash equilibrium in every proper subgame, thus a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium.This kind of extreme simplification is necessary to get through the example but could be relaxed in a more thorough study. A more complete specification of the game, including payoffs, would be necessary to show that these strategies can form a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium. For illustration let us suppose however that the strategies do form such an equilibrium and therefore that they also constitute a Markov perfect equilibrium. A Markov-perfect equilibrium concept has also been used to model aircraft production, as different companies evaluate their future profits and how much they will learn from production experience in light of demand and what others firms might supply.C. Lanier Benkard. 2000. Learning and forgetting: The dynamics of aircraft production. American Economic Review 90:4, 1034‚Äì1054. (jstor) =Discussion= Airlines do not literally or exactly follow these strategies, but the model helps explain the observation that airlines often charge exactly the same price, even though a general equilibrium model specifying non-perfect substitutability would generally not provide such a result. The Markov perfect equilibrium model helps shed light on tacit collusion in an oligopoly setting, and make predictions for cases not observed. One strength of an explicit game- theoretical framework is that it allows us to make predictions about the behaviours of the airlines if and when the equal-price outcome breaks down, and interpreting and examining these price wars in light of different equilibrium concepts.See for example Maskin and Tirole, p.571 In contrasting to another equilibrium concept, Maskin and Tirole identify an empirical attribute of such price wars: in a Markov strategy price war, \\"a firm cuts its price not to punish its competitor, [rather only to] regain market share\\" whereas in a general repeated game framework a price cut may be a punishment to the other player. The authors claim that the market share justification is closer to the empirical account than the punishment justification, and so the Markov perfect equilibrium concept proves more informative, in this case.Maskin and Tirole, 1988, p.592 Notes  References   Bibliography  Tirole, Jean. 1988.

His eclectic career in liturgical music, dance accompaniment, choir-directing and other disciplines has taken him to various venues in Canada, the United States and Europe. A Fellow of the Royal Canadian College of Organists (winning the Associateship and Fellowship Diplomas in consecutive years as well as the Charles Peaker and the Healey Willan Prizes respectively with those attempts, scoring the highest mark in Canada for the latter), Gaspar was one of a very small number of Canadians who won that professional designation under the age of thirty at the time of his receiving it. He has also conducted chamber orchestras, massed choirs and jazz combos in addition to writing a number of uniquely crafted classical songs (based on T.S.

In 2007 he appeared in Los Angeles at the \\"TAXI\\" convention in a gala promo event featuring some original songs from his collection, entitled The Dancer and I. From 2005 to 2007 Gaspar stepped in as Associate Organist at St. Paul's Anglican Cathedral, London, Ontario, where he performed in the Cathedral concert series as organ accompanist which often featured members of Orchestra London - and where he was publicly declared \\"A World Class Musician\\" on two occasions by the Cathedral Dean, now Bishop, Terry Dance. Personal life Gaspar, born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, began his music studies at a young age with trumpet and demonstrated considerable musical ability at an early age. By age thirteen, after having learned the Haydn trumpet concerto and the challenging Puedert Studies, he began to show more interest in the piano and abandoned the trumpet altogether for some twenty five years. After having finished with his piano and then later, organ studies, he resumed playing jazz trumpet with Jack Hayter and the Con Brio Band in Stratford as well as with the dance band \\"The Royal Aires\\". In 2002, he took a long working sabbatical to focus on composition, song writing, jazz and other disciplines and has worked intermittently as a church musician including his short stint at the London Cathedral.

The Ore Mountains are located in Central Europe on the border between Germany and the Czech Republic. For many centuries it was a countryside in which the local population eked out a hard existence from the land. Long and harsh winters restricted agriculture; in addition the region had very poor communications. With the onset of ore mining a new line of commerce developed, but the hard labour and high risks involved meant that it was only work for young and strong men. Many were injured or died as a result of accidents. The miners rose early in the morning whilst it was still dark in order to go to work and did not return home again until late in the evening after dark. From those times comes a custom that has survived to the present day, the practice of placing lights in the window. These lights were intended to show the miners the safe way back to the homes of their families. It was not long before the winnings of silver ore fell in many parts of the mountains and numerous pits had to close. This hardship forced its inhabitants to look for other work and, thanks to abundance of timber in the region, the manufacture of wooden toys became an important secondary source of income. Entire families were engaged in wooden toymaking, especially in the harsh winters. Child labour in conditions of poor lighting and equipment was the rule rather than the exception. The children often had to work more than 12 hours a day. Families developed a high degree of specialisation. For example, an experienced turner would be working on turning animal shapes (Reifendrehen), another man carved the animal figures out of it and another family took over the painting and the manufacture of small boxes. Earnings from the individual steps in the process were very low. Production was usually bought by travelling merchants who used their position without mercy, to force down the prices. The majority of these products was taken to the toy markets of Nuremberg and redistributed from there. The formation of associations and cooperatives (such as Dregeno) was in order to ensure a minimum level of income. Production is concentrated today in the toymaking village of Seiffen and its surrounding area in the middle of the so-called \\"German Christmas Land\\" as the Ore Mountains are called. A great variety of products has developed, but they are clearly associated with the Ore Mountains and go by the concept of Ore Mountain folk art. They include many typical wooden Ore Mountain products such as Christmas pyramids, wooden R√§uchermann incense smokers, nutcrackers, wooden figures (Christmas Angels, miners, turned animals, etc.), Christmas mountain scenes (Weihnachtsberge) and Ore Mountain candle arches.Treasures from the German Erzgebirge at nutcrackerplus.qcommerce.com.

He received his Masters of Engineering degree from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1885. He was first married on April 6, 1887 to Mary Sue Durgin, daughter of William B. Durgin, a silversmith and clock-maker from Concord, New Hampshire, and they had three children. After the 1897 death of his first wife, Rice married Alice Woodman Kimball of New York March 26, 1898. Engineering career Rice began his engineering career in 1885 heading the testing laboratory at Stevens Institute. From 1885-1886 he was a special apprentice at the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad shops in Dennison, Ohio. From 1886-1887 he was a designer of marine engines at the Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. From 1887-1891 Rice lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts where he was the a designer and chief draftsman for the E.D. Levitt Company in Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, and from 1891-1894 he was the superintendent engineer at the William A. Harris Steam Engine Company in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1894, he was an incorporating officer in the Rice & Sargent Engine Company, and he served as treasurer of the company. Rice and Sargent steam engines were used extensively for power plants in manufacturing companies from the mid-1890s to the 1930s. Rice was also an owner of the Providence Engineering Works, also in Providence.

The original building was significantly damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and collapsed in the subsequent February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. This building had a Category II listing by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. A new building was opened on Christmas Eve 2017. History View of the church in 1885. The wooden building on the left is the older church transported to here from the Hereford Street site Oxford Terrace Baptist Church in 2008 The Christchurch Baptist church was founded in 1863 by 19 settlers from England. Decimus Dolamore, who was instrumental for establishing the Baptist faith in New Zealand, was the first minister. The congregation first met in the town hall in High Street. In 1864, a church was built in Lichfield Street opposite where the Bus Exchange is located (as of 2011). The congregation split in 1867, but reunited in 1870 and built a church in Hereford Street. The congregation decided to build larger premises and purchased land for ¬£1,325 on the corner of Oxford Terrace and Madras Street, overlooking the Avon River. A design competition was won by local architect Edward J. Saunders. The congregation decided, though, that the total costs of the project was beyond their means. As an interim measure, the Hereford Street church was transported to the new site. Much public amusement was caused when the church sat on a wagon next to ChristChurch Cathedral for a weekend in 1879. Three weeks after arriving at the new site, the building was damaged by fire, but opened again some months later. The older building was in use until 1903, when it once again caught fire. View of the church after the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, with props holding the frontage up Tenders for the new church were called for in August 1881, but the prices submitted were too high, ranging from ¬£3,956 to ¬£5,337. A revised tender in September 1881 received a quote of ¬£3,130 by Morey and McHale, which was accepted. The Reverend C. Dallaston laid the foundation stone on 14 October 1881 and the project was completed and opened to the public on 9 July 1882. At that point, it was the largest Baptist church in the country. An organ was imported from England and installed in 1915. The main building was significantly damaged in the 4 September 2010 earthquake and collapsed in the subsequent 22 February 2011 earthquake. It was demolished in late June 2011 following further collapse in the 13 June 2011 earthquake. Heritage listing The building after the collapse on 22 February 2011 On 10 September 2004, the church was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place, with the registration number being 1853. It is significant for its Neoclassical architecture, which is unusual for Christchurch. The church had the last remaining temple frontage in the city. Peter Beck, the dean of ChristChurch Cathedral, lists the Oxford Terrace Baptist Church as one of the \\"iconic churches of the city\\". Post-earthquake 185 Empty Chairs The former site of the church of the church was used for a temporary art installation by Peter Majendie, unveiled at the first anniversary of the February 2011 earthquake. The installation, called Reflection of Loss of Lives, Livelihoods and Living in Neighbourhood, used 185 chairs all painted in white but of different shapes, reflecting the different personalities of those who died. The artwork became known as 185 empty chairs. Within a year, the installation moved to a different site, and in 2017, discussions started to make the artwork permanent. In March 2016, The Press revealed that a modern replacement church had gained resource consent. The NZ$8.5m project will create a two- storey building with an auditorium for 250 people; NZ$1.5m has yet to be fund- raised. The church was reopened on Christmas Eve 2017.

The larvae of this species are predators on both pulmonate and operculate land snails. Alecton discoidalis is the type species of the genus Alecton. Distribution Alecton is the only genus of firefly endemic to Cuba and A. discoidalis is the best known of the four species in that genus. It is found in the western half of the country. The type locality was described simply as \\"the island of Cuba\\".  Description  Alecton discoidalis was discovered and described (based on the larva only) by the French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau in 1833. His type description in French reads as follows: This translates as: Yellow, with the tips of the antennae and the elytra black, with a yellow border which starts a third of the way along the elytra.  Biology  The fireflies of Cuba have not been extensively studied. Research was undertaken in 2009 to examine the association of the larvae with terrestrial gastropods and to learn more about the natural history of the species. Larvae of A. discoidalis were collected in limestone regions of Cuba where they were frequently found in the vicinity of snails. Most collections were made at night at which time the larvae could often be detected when they emitted flashes of light. Representatives of several different instar stages were gathered from leaf litter and from on or under rocks. At the same time, snails of a number of species were collected to determine which species would be the preferred prey for the larvae. The temperature at the time of collection ranged from 26 to 32 ¬∞C and the humidity ranged from 64 to 86%. These levels were maintained in the laboratory during research. An early stage larva of Alecton discoidalis feeding on the land snail Torrella immersa in captivity The most vulnerable snails seemed to be those that live on the ground or rocks, but tree-dwelling species were also targeted occasionally. Acceptable prey species included snails from several families: family Helicinidae (Helicina aspersa, Ustronia sloanei, Alcadia hispida, Emoda sagraiana), family Pomatiidae (Chondropoma pictum, Chondropoma auberianum, Chondropoma irradians, Eutudora jimenoi, Torrella immersa, Rhytidopoma coronatum), family Megalomastomatidae (Farcimen tortum), family Oleacinidae (Oleacina sp.) and family Polygyridae (Praticolella griseola). Snails that were rejected by these larvae as food included Pycnoptychia species and Liguus fasciatus. It was found that attacks took place both during the day and at night with the operculum of the snail being targeted. The larva spent up to 24 hours inside the shell devouring the soft tissues. Sometimes several first-instar larvae attacked a single snail at the same time. On some occasions, the snails H. aspersa and C. pictum emitted a protective foam which enabled them to thwart the attack. When the larvae were sufficiently grown, they pupated and the adult firefly later emerged. The identity of the imago had not previously been known.

It is located in Gamvik Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. It sits along the Barents Sea approximately north of the village of Gamvik on the northern coast of the Nordkinn Peninsula. The lighthouse is the only cast iron lighthouse in Finnmark county. This is the easternmost of the three Nordkapp area lighthouses, and it is often considered the North Cape Light, marking the \\"top\\" of Europe. Fruholmen Lighthouse is located about farther north, on the island of Ing√∏ya, but the Slettnes Lighthouse is the northernmost lighthouse on the mainland of Scandinavia. History This lighthouse was built from 1903 to 1905. The round cast iron tower is tall and it is painted red with two white horizontal bands. The light on top emits one long (2.5 sec) white flash every 20 seconds. The light burns from 12 August until 24 April each year. It doesn't burn during the summer due to the midnight sun. In 1922 the lighthouse got a foghorn with a siren, which gave a signal every thirty seconds, helping in fog and bad visibility. The foghorn could be heard in form of a one to two tone signal with a range of . The fog horn was in use until 1985. The lighthouse was heavily damaged during World War II by German troops, but it was painstakingly restored after the war. The restored station was designed by architects Blakstad and Munthe-Kaas and it was completed in 1948. The station is owned by the Kystverket and managed by Gamvik Municipality as a tourist center, and overnight accommodations are available in the station buildings. In 1998, the lighthouse was listed as a heritage site. The lighthouse was automated in 2005.

Plot  Sam Harper (Chris Pine), a struggling corporate trader in New York City, may have violated federal law and faces a possible Federal Trade Commission investigation. Sam's boss (Jon Favreau) urges him to bribe federal officials. Returning home, Sam's girlfriend Hannah (Olivia Wilde) informs him that his estranged father, Jerry, has died. Sam and Hannah fly to L.A. where he has a tense reunion with his mother, Lillian (Michelle Pfeiffer). Jerry's lawyer and friend (Philip Baker Hall), tells Sam he will not inherit any money. The lawyer hands him a shaving kit containing $150,000 in cash and a note stipulating that the money be delivered to Josh Davis (Michael Hall D'Addario). Josh (Michael Hall D'Addario) is a troubled 11-year-old boy whose bartender mother, Frankie Davis (Elizabeth Banks), is a recovering alcoholic. Sam secretly follows Frankie to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. He learns she is Jerry's illegitimate daughter, making Frankie Sam's paternal half-sister, and Josh his nephew. When Sam tells Hannah he intends to keep the money, Hannah, disgusted, returns to New York. Sam introduces himself to Frankie as a visiting fellow alcoholic, and soon becomes involved in their life, gradually growing closer. He learns that Jerry visited Frankie and her mother on Sundays, and that Frankie has never met her father's wife and son. Meanwhile, Sam broods over his deepening legal troubles. Frankie does not want Sam around Josh anymore because she fears he will return to New York, upsetting Josh. Sam decides to leave, but returns to pick up Josh from school. Frankie later calls Sam, telling him Josh has been in a fight. Sam eventually reveals that he is Jerry's son, resulting in Frankie exploding in anger and ordering him to leave. Later, Lillian is hospitalized following a heart condition. Hannah finds Sam in the waiting room, and they reconcile. Hannah has enrolled into UCLA's law program to remain close to Sam after realizing he wants to be with his family. Meanwhile, Frankie receives Jerry's money through a lawyer. Frankie quits her job, enrolls in school, and move into a suburban neighborhood with Josh. She cuts contact with Sam. After being discharged from the hospital, Lillian tells Sam that she forced Jerry to choose their family over Frankie and her mother. She was protecting Sam, but Jerry instead rejected his son because he was a reminder of the daughter he abandoned. One day, Josh, who is having difficulty adjusting to Sam's absence, tries to find him after obtaining Lillian's address. When Sam visits Frankie, he asks her forgiveness and wants to be her brother and Josh's uncle and father figure. He shows her an old film reel that Jerry shot of a young Sam at a playground. In the film, a girl joins Sam, and Frankie realizes that Jerry had regularly brought her and Sam to play together and thus loved both his children.

Life  He was the son of George Gee, who was minister of Newton in the parish of Manchester, and nephew of Edward Gee, vicar of Tedburn St Mary; he was born at Banbury. He was educated at Newton school and entered Brasenose College, Oxford, as a commoner on 26 October 1626, taking the degree of B.A. in October 1630. He proceeded M.A. in June 1636, having in the meantime entered the ministry. He became chaplain to Richard Parr, at that time both bishop of Sodor and Man, and rector of Eccleston, near Chorley, Lancashire. In June 1640 Gee was married at Eccleston to Elizabeth Raymond. Three years later he succeeded Parr as rector of Eccleston, a living in the gift of William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele as guardian of Richard Lathom; but he left the choice of minister to the people, and they nominated Gee. In 1644 (13 December) he was appointed a commissioner to ordain ministers in Lancashire, and in 1646 was elected a member of the sixth classis (Preston) of the Lancashire presbytery; and attained a leading position in that body. In 1648, he was suspected, along with other Lancashire divines, of corresponding with the Scottish party and of encouraging dissatisfaction with the existing government. He was arrested pursuant to an order of the council of state of 2 September 1651, but was released after a few weeks' confinement. In 1654, Angier became an assistant commissioner for ejecting ‚Äòignorant and scandalous ministers and schoolmasters.‚Äô In November 1656 he preached a funeral sermon on Richard Hollinworth, and received the thanks of the Manchester classis. He died at Eccleston on 27 May 1660, and was buried in his church there.  Works  In 1648, he signed the ‚ÄòHarmonious Consent of the Ministers of the Province of ‚Ä¶ Lancaster with their Reverend Brethren of ‚Ä¶ London.‚Äô In February of the same year his name was appended, as scribe to the provincial synod held at Preston, to ‚ÄòA Solemn Exhortation made and published to the several Churches of Christ within the Province of Lancaster,‚Äô London, 1649. He was also one of the signers of the answer to the paper called ‚ÄòThe Agreement of the People,‚Äô 1649. He is credited with writing ‚ÄòA Plea for Non (Sub) Scribers, or the Grounds and Reasons of many Ministers ‚Ä¶ for their Refusall of the late Engagement modestly Propounded,‚Äô 1650, pp. 136. About this time he wrote two other anonymous pamphlets: * ‚ÄòAn Exercitation concerning Usurped Power,‚Äô without date. * ‚ÄòA Vindication of the Oath of Allegiance, in answer to a Paper disperst by Mr. Sam.

It is located southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. The ground control intercept (GCI) station F-26 was closed on 1 November 1983. A new minimally attended Long Range Radar (LRR) site, A-08 was built about 5 miles to the southeast of the closed Air Force Station as part of the Alaska Radar System. Today, it remains active as part of the Alaska NORAD Region under the jurisdiction of the 611th Air Support Group, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  History  Cold Bay AFS was a continental defense radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. Planning for a surveillance station at Cold Bay began in July 1956 and construction commenced later that year. Not part of the first 25 Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&W;) radar stations, Cold Bay AFS was added as part of the Aleutian extension of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line). The radar station and support base was located at the southwest end of the Aleutian Peninsula, about 7 miles west-northwest of the former Fort Randall Army Air Base (later Thornbrough Air Force Base). The airport facilities were used as a logistics support terminal during the construction of the site, which was completed in September 1958. The station consisted of a power/heating plant, water and fuel storage tanks, gymnasium and other support office buildings. Two other buildings contained living quarters, work areas, and recreational facilities plus opportunities for such sports as skiing, skating, horseshoes, and basketball. The station buildings were, except for the civil engineering building connected by heated hallways. As a result, personnel stationed there, with only very few exceptions, were able to wear \\"summer\\" uniforms year round, unless they had a need to go outside during the winter season. The coverings of the station's three radar towers were heated from within to keep the covering from becoming brittle from extreme cold, and thus subject to being damaged or destroyed by high winds. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. The 714th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) operated AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-20A, and AN/FPS-6(-90) radars. Cold Bay AFS operated as a long-range surveillance radar station which provided information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at Fire Island AFS where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. An AN/FYQ-9 Semiautomatic Data Processing and Display System was installed and became operational in July 1965, eliminating the need to pass track data manually. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Cold Bay site, located next to the radars, was activated in 1958. It was inactivated in 1979, and replaced by an Alascom owned and operated satellite earth terminal as part of an Air Force plan to divest itself of the obsolete White Alice Communications System and transfer the responsibility to a commercial firm. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1982, a new AN/FPS-117 minimally attended radar under Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program was constructed about 2 miles southeast of the station . It was designed to transmit aircraft tracking data via satellite to the Alaskan NORAD Regional Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB. No longer needed, the 714th AC&W; Sq was inactivated on 1 November 1983. In 1990, jurisdiction of the Cold Bay LRR Site was transferred to Pacific Air Force (PACAF)'s Eleventh Air Force with the redesignation of Alaskan Air Command (AAC). In 1998 PACAF initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005. Current status Today very little of the former Cold Bay Air Force Station remains. The site is controlled by the PACAF 611th Air Support Group, based at Elmendorf AFB. It is generally unattended; a few civilian contractors access the Cold Bay LRR Site via the Cold Bay Airport for maintaining the facilities.

It was the only one that covered such a large area. It had five manned detachments at remote sites, each located about 130 miles apart stretching from just west of King Salmon all the way to Nikolski Island, about halfway to Shemya. In effect, they were responsible for radar coverage for all of the Aleutian Peninsula as well as the major Aleutian Islands. No other squadron had such a mission. Each site had an AN/FPS-19 search radar and troposcatter radio relay. Staffing at the detachments included 3 cooks, one water treatment tech, one electrician, an admin/crypto specialist, one vehicle maintenance tech, the commander, three radio techs, a supply tech, a first Sgt, three radar techs, three power production techs and the remainder scope operators. These detachments were located at: * Detachment 1, Nikolski Radars, COB-1 : Nikolski Air Force Station * Detachment 2, Driftwood Bay Radars, COB-2 : Driftwood Bay Air Force Station * Detachment 3, Cape Sarichef Radars, COB-3 : Cape Sarichef Air Force Station * Detachment 4, Port Moller Radars, COB-4 : Port Moller Air Force Station * Detachment 5, Port Heiden Radars, COB-5 : Port Heiden Air Force Station (Former World War II Fort Morrow AAF) Each detachment was manned by 24 enlisted, one officer and in some instances a civilian technical representative. The manning of the squadron and the detachments was part of a \\"minimum manning\\" experiment. If you were assigned to a detachment you stayed there 365 without leave. Only way to leave early was due to severe sickness or a major emergency at home such as death of immediate family member. These five Aleutian DEW Line sites were deactivated 30 September 1969. The main site at Cold Bay AFS was converted to a NORAD surveillance site.

He was a canon in the Mainz Cathedral and then became subdeacon of the cathedral chapter at Cologne and cathedral provost at W√ºrzburg. Ruprecht was elected Archbishop of Cologne on 30 March 1463, but not confirmed by the Pope until August 1464 and not consecrated until Palm Sunday 1468. He only received the episcopal regalia from the Holy Roman Emperor in August 1471.Manfred Groten, \\"Ruprecht von der Pfalz, Erzbischof von K√∂ln\\", Neue Deutsche Biographie, ed.

Chosen for his family connections, he faced the challenge of guarding the Electorate of Cologne against diminution of its powersFor a summary of the encroachment on the territories of Cologne by secular rulers, see Benjamin Arnold, Princes and Territories in Medieval Germany, Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1991, , pp. 236-37, who speaks of a \\"stranglehold\\". while solving its internal problems, in particular the shortage of income from being denied the toll income from the most important Rhine trading towns, which had been mortgaged by his predecessor, Dietrich II von Moers, to raise money for war. He was required to agree to 23 articles presented by the cathedral chapter limiting his financial options which the chapter and the Estates had agreed upon four days before his election,Hans Prutz, The Age of the Renaissance, A History of All Nations 10, Philadelphia/New York: Lea, 1905, p. 310. and to the chapter holding the important trading town of Zons as a pledge of his good behaviour. Ruprecht quarrelled with his advisors and became involved in external politics. In 1467, he entered into an alliance with Adolf, Duke of Guelders against the Duke of Cleves, with the aim of regaining control over Soest, Xanten and Rees. After finally receiving his regalia, by autumn 1471 he was repudiating the agreement he himself had had a hand in drafting as a chapter member and demanding higher taxes,Jahresberichte der Geschichtswissenschaft 12 (1889) p. 617 and to obtain them, he occupied Zons. Ruprecht persisted in trying to reduce the privileges of cities within the archbishopric. With military and financial assistance from his brother Frederick I, Elector Palatine,Cohn, p. 77 mentions substantial loans of money and provisions. he began the Cologne Ecclesiastical Conflict (), which grew into the Burgundian Wars. The majority of Ruprecht's vassals, including the citizens of Cologne, renounced their allegiance to him and asked both the Pope and Emperor Frederick III to intervene. In open rebellion, they proclaimed Landgrave Hermann of Hesse administrator and protector of the archbishopric. Only a few minor lords remained loyal to Ruprecht. Ruprecht appealed for help to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who announced himself the protector of Cologne.Nicholas Michael, Armies of Medieval Burgundy 1364-1477, Men-at-arms series 144, London: Osprey, 1983, , p. 25.John Bagnell Bury, The Cambridge Medieval History Volume 8, The Close of the Middle Ages, Cambridge: University Press, 1936, , p. 152. The Emperor attempted in December 1473 to mediate the conflict, but failed. In 1474, Charles besieged Neuss, a stronghold of the rebels in which Hermann had taken refuge; the Reichstag decided at Augsburg to go to war against Charles, and a general call to arms was issued in the German Empire.Prutz, p. 313. The Siege of Neuss lasted almost a year and ended in Charles accepting the Pope's mediation, including concerning Ruprecht's position as archbishop.Prutz, pp. 314, 315. Ruprecht had been excommunicated by the Pope in 1472 for not paying required contributions from his see to Rome. His position continued to weaken; his brother did not support him against the EmperorCohn, p. 13. and died on 12 December 1476, and he lost the support of all but Kempen and Altenahr and in March 1478 was taken captive by the Hessians. Imprisoned in Burg Blankenstein near Gladenbach and with the Duke of J√ºlich-Berg acting as mediator, he was forced to renounce his position as archbishop in exchange for an income of 4,000 gold guilders. He died before the Pope granted acceptance of his resignation,K. Lyncker, \\"Die Belagerung von Neu√ü in den Jahren 1474 und 1475: Eine Episode zur Hessischen Geschichte\\", Zeitschrift des Vereins f√ºr hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde 6 (1854) 1-63, p. 56 : giving the date as 26 July. Both the Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie and the Neue Deutsche Biographie give 16 July. and was buried in the Bonn Minster. His successor as Archbishop of Cologne was Hermann of Hesse, who had successfully defended Neuss against him and his allies and became Hermann IV; he gave Ruprecht an imposing tomb. Ruprecht had some success in monastic reform, extending even to institutions outside his area of control, in Cleves and J√ºlich-Berg.Elke-Ursel Hammer, Monastische Reform zwischen Person und Institution: zum Wirken des Abtes Adam Meyer von Gross St. Martin in K√∂ln (1454-1499), Ver√∂ffentlichungen des Max-Planck-Instituts f√ºr Geschichte 165; Ver√∂ffentlichungen des Max-Planck-Instituts f√ºr Geschichte, Studien zur Germania sacra 22, G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2001, , pp. 390‚Äì91 He was passionate about hunting and hawking.Friedrich Christoph Schlosser, rev.

The unlicensed airfield consists of a single 660-metre-long grass runway; the runway is not entirely flat, with a dip in the middle and a hump at the eastern end. The runway is located at the top of a ridge of high ground east of and above the town of Dronfield, close to the villages of Summerley, Apperknowle and Coal Aston. The airfield is operated from a nearby farmhouse and prior permission is required for landing. The airfield took over from the legacy of RAF Coal Aston, which was situated on what is now the Jordanthorpe estate in Sheffield to the north-west. The original RAF Coal Aston closed sometime in the 1920s. The older hangar at Coal Aston is a Blister-type hangar, made famous during the interwar years. It was erected by United Steel Companies Limited, later to become British Steel, in 1961. The runway was at that time at its maximum length of around 800 metres; it has since been reduced to 660 metres in 2015. A second hangar was later erected in the 1980s, and this sits alongside the original. In 1995, the airstrip achieved permanent permission for use as an airfield; it is now one of the last remaining traditional grass airfields in Derbyshire. A public footpath follows the northern and western perimeter of the airfield. There is no public right of way across the site. Overnight parking of aircraft is possible and hangarage is available in one of the two hangars on site. A range of aircraft types may be accepted to the airfield at the owners' discretion. On 28 May 2017, a light aircraft crashed on Summerley Road, several hundred metres short of the runway in the nearby village of Summerley, while on final approach to Coal Aston Airfield.

The process produces small animals and other figures or even little wooden houses in outline, that are used as toys or to decorate Christmas pyramids or Nativity scenes. The animals and figures (Reifentiere and Reifenfiguren) so produced are an inherent part of Ore Mountain folk art.  Production  In the process known as Reifendrehen (literally \\"tyre turning\\" or ‚Äúhoop turning‚Äù) a suitable piece of wood, as far as possible free of splits, is worked on a special wood lathe to produce a wooden ring with a diameter of about 30 to 50 centimetres, the cross-section of which forms the outline of the desired figure. Small slices are then sawn or split off the ring with a sharp knife. These are used as the raw material from which the finished figures are made by carving and painting. The technique of Reifendrehen, which demands great experience and skill, emerged around 1800. It enabled, during the 19th century, the efficient mass production of wooden figures, because it was faster and cheaper than pure woodcarving by hand. Today part of the exhibition at the Ore Mountain Toy Museum in Seiffen is dedicated to the craft of the turners - the Reifendreher - who make these toys. In addition, there are several visitor workshops in the region around Seiffen.

He wintered in England. In 1641 Parr rebuilt St. Catherine's, Ramsey. His chaplain and curate at Eccleston was Edward Gee. In October 1643 the living was sequestered and given to Gee. Parr remained in his diocese, where he was not disturbed, as the Isle of Man was held by the royalists till 1651. He died at Bishop's Court, Peel, on 23 March 1644, and was buried on 26 March in the grave of Bishop John Phillips in St Germans Cathedral, Peel. The see was not filled until 1661, by the appointment of Samuel Rutter (died 30 May 1663). The bishop spelled his name originally Parre, and later Parr. He published some sermons. Family Parr married in 1624 Elizabeth Raymond, daughter of Thomas Raymond of Guildford. His son, Robert Parr, was rector of Ballaugh (1640‚Äì70).

His father is Melchior Wathelet. He followed part of his secondary education in Dutch at a school in Bilzen,Limburg. After a degree in law from the Catholic University of Louvain and a Master of European Law from the University of Southampton, he became lawyer at the Bar association of Li√®ge in 2002. He started his political career in 2003, when he was elected as member of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives where he quickly became group member for his party and second vice-president of the cdH. He became secretary of state in charge of the budget in the Leterme II Government, and kept this charge in the Van Rompuy I Government and the Leterme II Government. He became secretary of state in charge of Environment, Energy and Mobility in the Di Rupo I Government in 2010. After the 2014 elections on 22 July 2014 Joelle Milquet resigned to become minister of Lower education and Culture in the Government of the French Community. She was replaced as Deputy-Prime Minister and Minister of the interior by Wathelet. Plan Wathelet and the controversy surrounding it On 6 February 2014 Melchior Wathelet - in his function as secretary of state in charge of Environment, Energy and Mobility - implemented a plan that reorganizes the departure routes from Brussels National Airport in Zaventem. One of the goals of the plan was to spread airplane traffic over a wider area. As a result of this plan, the majority of departing aircraft are routed over densely populated areas of Brussels. This plan ‚Äì referred to by campaigners as the Plan Wathelet ‚Äì soon became the object of controversy and led to a wave of complaints by residents affected by aircraft noise. A revision of the plan was blocked by the government of Flanders in early May. The question of how to route the airline traffic from Zaventem airport, which is located near to the urban area of Brussels has been a contentious political issue for many years. The jurisdictional complexity of the region, and the multitude of intersecting political priorities makes an agreement hard to find with the different Belgian regions, communes and political parties each pushing different agendas. The plan played a role in the federal and regional elections of May 2014, leading to poor results for Wathelet's party, and a solution is not likely until after the formation of a federal government. The main criticisms centered on the following facts: * Plan Wathelet was introduced without any prior consultation with local residents. In other European Countries, such a consultation process is a regulatory requirement before any change to aircraft routes (Standard Terminal Arrival Routes, STARs, and Standard Instrument Departures, SIDs) can be published. Furthermore no impact assessment had been carried out prior to the publication of the new departure routes. Wathelet‚Äôs problem management also came under discussion. * Melchior accused residents‚Äô groups of pursuing an ulterior political agenda against him. * After the implementation of the plan, the Brussels minister for Environment Evelyne Huytebroeck claimed that the number of residents affected by aircraft noise was much larger than originally announced by Wathelet. Wathelet initially dismissed this claim and other criticisms as unsubstantiated. In May 2014, a study by the Free University of Brussels confirmed that the number of residents subjected to aircraft noise has tripled in comparison to the previously used departure routes.

A member of the Alliance '90/Greens, he was President of the Bundesrat and ex officio deputy to the President of Germany from 2012 to 2013. He is the first member of the Greens to serve in these offices. Identifying himself as a green conservative, Kretschmann has been associated with both culturally and economically liberal policies. Kretschmann has been a member of the state parliament, the Landtag of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, since 1980, in the constituency of N√ºrtingen. In 2006 he was the frontrunner in the Baden-W√ºrttemberg state election for his party, as he was in the state election on 27 March 2011. He was also the chairman of his party's parliamentary group. Following the state election of 2011, Kretschmann was elected on 12 May 2011 by the combined Green-SPD majority in the Landtag to succeed Stefan Mappus as Minister-President of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, becoming the first ever Green Minister-President of any German state. Kretschmann has wide personal popularity; if it were possible to elect the Minister-President directly during the Baden-W√ºrttemberg election of March 2016, Kretschmann would have won an outright majority according to polls; he was even favored by 45% of CDU supporters. Kretschmann was re-elected in May 2016 as Minister- President while leading a new coalition with the Christian Democrats. On 12 October 2012 he was elected President of the German Bundesrat for the term from 1 November 2012 to 31 October 2013. This was the first time since 1953, and only the second time ever, that the President was not drawn from the ranks of either the CDU/CSU or the SPD. Early life and education Kretschmann was born at Spaichingen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. His parents were expellees from the mostly Roman Catholic region of Ermland (East Prussia) after World War II. He grew up on the rural Swabian Alb (southern Baden-W√ºrttemberg). Kretschmann attended a Catholic boarding school in Sigmaringen and passed his Abitur in Riedlingen. Following his military service, he studied to be a teacher of biology and chemistry (later ethics) at the University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, graduating in 1977. Political career =Early beginnings= From 1973 to 1975 Kretschmann was active in the Communist League of West Germany.Biography at Munzinger.de He later denounced this orientation towards the revolutionary positions of the German student movement as a \\"political misapprehension\\"; today he is more ecologically oriented and counted among the members of the more conservative wing of the Greens. After three years as a school teacher at Sigmaringen, Kretschmann went into politics. He is one of the founding members of the Baden-W√ºrttemberg section of the German Green Party (at Sindelfingen on 30 September 1979). In 1980, Kretschmann was for the first time elected into the Landtag, the state parliament, and a first stint of his chairmanship of his party's parliamentary group followed from 1983 to 1985. In 1985 he left Stuttgart to work in Hessen at the ministry of environment, then run by party colleague Joschka Fischer for two years. In 1988, Kretschmann returned to Baden-W√ºrttemberg, being re-elected into the Landtag in 1988. He lost his seat in 1992, but returned ‚Äì after four years back as a teacher ‚Äì in 1996 and held his seat in 2001 and 2006.

He identifies as a green conservative. His business-friendly approach to policy has caused him to clash with his party on more than one occasion. While he shared his party‚Äôs official position of favoring an alliance with the SPD after the 2013 federal elections, he repeatedly criticized its campaign. He objected to the Greens‚Äô election platform of tax increases, warning the leadership in a public letter to avoid any move that would be detrimental to business.Brian Parkin (April 29, 2013), Merkel‚Äôs Party Shuns 'Stone Age' Greens Amid Tax-Rise Pledge Bloomberg News. When Bavaria filed a lawsuit in the Federal Constitutional Court in 2012, asking the judges to back their call for an overhaul of the German system of financial transfers from wealthier states (such as Bavaria and Baden-W√ºrttemberg) to the country's weaker economies, Kretschmann decided that his state would not back the lawsuit and instead urged reform via negotiations between all the states.Christian Kraemer (July 17, 2012), Bavaria seeks to trump Merkel with anti-bailout card Reuters. Kretschmann has in the past been vocal about climate change policies. In May 2015, he joined Governor Jerry Brown of California and other international leaders from various states and provinces in signing the Under2 MOU, a non- binding climate change agreement in Sacramento, California. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Kretschmann and Brown convened in Paris during the talks to attract more supporters among governors, mayors and other leaders of ‚Äúsubnational‚Äù governments for stronger commitments to reducing emissions.Sewell Chan and Melissa Eddy (December 13, 2015), Leaders Move to Convert Paris Climate Pledges Into Action New York Times.

It stars Lily Pons and Jack Oakie. It was nominated for an Academy Award in 1938 in the category Best Sound Recording (John O. Aalberg). Plot Corny Davis, a press agent of an American entertainment mogul based out of Paris, France is looking for new work. After the mogul, Lucius B Blynn, faces a series of embrassments, his press agent tries to sign an opera singer for him. He finds an opera singer named Suzette (Lily Pons), Suzette is furious with her current agent and boyfriend (Jimmy James, played by John Howard) who wants her to sing cabaret instead of opera, so she walks out on him, where Corny is waiting. However, Davis's boss is already on a quest to rebuild his reputation by going on safari in French Equatorial Africa. Therefore, he has the opera singer (played by Lily Pons) go to the French Congo and pretend to be a \\"bird woman\\", something akin to Tarzan but having been raised amongst the birds. He \\"finds\\" her in the wild singing, just as Corny intended. Despite the farcical nature of this, Blynn buys it. He has her \\"captured\\" in a wooden cage, Corny says he'll \\"teach her\\" to speak, absurdly Blynn continues to fall for the entire charade. While Blynn frantically telegrams New York telling them about his \\"find\\", Corny and Suzette (who is pretending to be \\"Oogahunga the Bird-Girl\\") scheme to keep the farce going until she's famous and he's rich. Blynn excitedly debuts Suzette on radio in New York City while he wears full safari gear despite being on radio. When questioned on why he's dressed that way he says it's so he can have \\"an authentic mental juxtaposition\\". However, during her inaugural broadcast her ex-boss/ex-boyfriend hears her singing the song she was arguing with him about when she walked out on him. Immediately he knows it's her. Shortly thereafter Jimmy James shows up in Blynn's office. Blynn kicks him out but he scales the wall and finds Suzette upstairs playing piano and singing. Corny walks in on them and makes an arrangement with Jimmy, they get Suzette to agree to do shows for both of them in exchange for James not exposing their scheme. His friend and clarinet player Cedric Cosmos (played by Eric Blore) overhears Corny, Jimmy and Suzette discussing the entire scam backstage during one such cabaret show. He asks Jimmy for hush money and when he doesn't get it he shows up the next day as adventurer \\"Captain Braceridge Hemingway\\", explorer of Africa. Blynn, unaware he's being tricked yet again falls for Cedric's imitation. Cedric, as \\"Captain Braceridge Hemingway\\" tells an elaborate tale of shipwreck off of the coast Africa. He claims to be the long lost father of \\"Oogahunga, the Bird-Girl\\". Blynn gracefully allows him to reconnect with his \\"long lost daughter\\". When Cedric and Corny are alone, Cedric makes blackmail demands of Corny. However, during the next performance of \\"Oogahunga\\", she is recognized as Suzette by Blynn's main rival. Said rival confronts Corny and he too gets cut in on the blackmail money. Blynn goes to the nightclub where Suzette also sings cabaret. He sees Suzette there singing and \\"Captain Braceridge Hemingway\\" playing clarinet in Jimmy's band, and Blynn demands she stop singing, still believing she's \\"Oogahunga\\". Everything is exposed and explained to Blynn who erupts in fury. Cedric plays on the clarinet as Blynn storms away and the rest of the band joins in. Then Corny and Blynn begin drunkenly singing along, and then Suzette joins in as well. Then the entire audience joins in as well.

Both John Mart√≠n and Mart√≠n C√≥il√≠n were born on the island of Inish Bearachain (Irish: Inis Bearachain). The third member of the crew, John William, was born on the nearby island of Inse Gaine, but later moved to Inish Bearachain when he married there. The Seoighe Cousins won many titles in the All-Ireland currach rowing championships known as the \\"T√≥stal \\". In the 1950s and early 1960s the Joyce cousins won a record four All-Ireland titles. Amongst these was the exceptional achievement of winning three years in a row in 1956, 1957 and 1958. They also won a fourth All-Ireland race in 1961. To compete in the T√≥stal final teams had to win qualifying races in their own Gaeltacht regions. The Joyce cousins qualified in the Lettermore region and went on to the finals, which were held at Salthill in County Galway. The 1957 T√≥stal final race was rerun because of the disqualification of all the teams except for the one from Clare Island. The Joyce cousins had won this first race, but the T√≥stal committee claimed that only the Clare Island team ran the correct race course. After much complaint and debate the T√≥stal committee decided that the race would be rerun in Kilkee, County Clare, in later weeks. The Seoighe cousins won the second race at Kilkee and were presented with the trophy by the then president of Ireland, √âamon de Valera. During the years the Joyce cousins competed, the main T√≥stal race attracted huge crowds, with over 50,000 spectators at Salthill one year. In a time before television it was a source of entertainment for people, and there was huge interest in the races, which were broadcast on the radio. Crowds thronged to Salthill with any form of transportation they could get; some walked, others came on bicycles, and a few came in cars and buses. John William Seoighe John William Seoighe was born on the island of Inse Gaineamh in 1919. John William Seoighe is also known as an experienced sailor of the traditional boat known as the Galway hooker. John William and John Bhab√≠n Seoighe were both involved in the turf or peat trade to the Aran Islands and County Clare. They used their own, Bl√°th na h√ìige (Flower of Youth), to deliver the turf. The turf was loaded into the boats and brought to these areas to use as fuel, but in time lorries supplanted the boats. In an interview on RTE RT√â Raidi√≥ na Gaeltachta (Irish-language radio), Tom She√°in√≠n was asked by the presenter M√°irt√≠n Tom She√°in√≠n what he thought of the famous Galway hooker Saint Patrick. His reply became a commonly used saying for any thing or person that looks beautiful: \\"Ligfeadh an taoile tuile ort a' breathn√∫ uirthi,\\" which translated from Irish means: \\"One would let the tide come in while looking at it\\". He has been linked to the phrase ever since. M√°rt√≠n C√≥il√≠n Seoighe M√°rt√≠n C√≥il√≠n Seoighe was born on the island of Inis Bearachain. Along with being a spectacular oarsman he used to sail in the Galway hooker. He was a boat builder and built many currachs. He is known as one of the finest wooden oar makers in Ireland. He was the subject of a documentary shown on Irish-language television station TG4, titled \\"M√© F√©in is mo M√©it,\\" which translates as \\"myself and my friend\\". This documentary showed him with his friend Coleman Coyne and told their stories of their life and times together at sea. John Bhab√≠n Seoighe John Bhab√≠n Seoighe (1917 ‚Äì April 2011) was born on the island of Inis Bearachain. When he married he moved to the mainland of Lettermore. John Bhab√≠n Seoighe, besides being an exceptional oarsman, was involved in the Galway hooker turf trade to the Aran islands and County Clare. Inish Bearachain Inish Bearachain is an island off of the coast of Lettermore, Conemara, Ireland. It is part of an area known in Irish as \\"na hoile√°in\\" or \\"the islands,\\" of which there are many, and with only some accessible by road. The main access point to the islands is at B√©al an Dangain. Here there is a closed bridge, replacing a swing bridge which allowed big boats through. Inish Bearachain is not accessible by road. The origin of the name is uncertain, with some inhabitants believing that it came from a visit of the saint known as Saint Barra. Others believe it came from the Irish Barr an Chuain or \\"Top of the Bay\\". Amhr√°n na Seoighe /Song of the Joyces Amhr√°n na Seoighe or the \\"Song of the Joyces\\" was written by the poet Val Donnach√∫ from C√°rna, Connemara, in praise of the Joyce cousins when they were winning races. A second song was inspired by a rumour there were three black men coming from the United States to compete in the T√≥stal.

All privately and federally owned diesel-fueled trucks and buses, and privately and publicly owned school buses with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 14,000 pounds, are covered by the regulation. Implementation was originally scheduled for January 1, 2011 but recent amendments were considered in December 2010. The rule now requires the installation of particulate matter filters beginning January 1, 2012 and replacement of older engines beginning January 1, 2015. Nearly all applicable vehicles are required to have 2010 model year or the equivalent to 2010 engines by January 1, 2023. Background Diesel trucks are the largest emitter of toxic diesel particulate matter in California. Diesel exhaust particulate matter (PM) was identified as a toxic air contaminant by the Air Resources Board in 1998 after study results showed its potential to cause cancer, premature death, and other health problems. Two years later, in September 2000, the Air Resources Board adopted the Risk Reduction Plan to Reduce Particulate Matter Emissions from Diesel-Fueled Engines and Vehicles which committed to establish retrofit requirements for in-use diesel vehicles to reduce diesel particulate matter 75 percent by 2010 and 85 percent by 2020. In 2007 the Air Resources Board then adopted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) which requires heavy-duty in-use diesel trucks operating in the South Coast and San Joaquin Valley to be retrofitted to meet model year 2007 emission levels by 2014 and 2017, respectively. The State Implementation Plan was implemented to help California's Air Quality Control Regions (AQCR) meet the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and also aims to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) and ozone in the state. This regulation is the next step to help the Air Resources Board achieve their goal to reduce diesel particulate matter. With the new amendments in place, diesel emissions are estimated to be 68 percent lower than they would be without the regulation, and emissions of the smog-forming pollutant, nitrogen oxide, will be 25 percent lower. The regulation also aims to save lives and dollars spent on health care. The Air Resources Board estimates that the reduction in diesel emissions is expected to save 9,400 lives within the 11 year time frame and reduce health care costs, with an estimated savings between US$48 billion and $69 billion. By the time the rule is fully implemented in 2023, no truck or bus more than 13 years old will be allowed to operate in California without particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions controls. = Support = The Truck and Bus Rule is considered by the Air Resources Board and other organizations such as the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Environmental Defense Fund as a win-win for the State of California: reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, reducing fuel use, providing fuel and operating cost-savings for truck owners, and reducing smog-forming pollution, in addition to providing human health benefits. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the retrofits could reduce global warming pollution by 17 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) by 2020 and a net savings of $30,000 over the life of one long-range truck. In addition to reducing air pollution, this regulation is thought to have helped broaden and strengthen the environmental movement in California. = Opposition = On February 15, 2011 the California Dump Truck Owners Association (CDTOA) which changed its name to the California Construction Trucking Association (CCTA) on January 2012, filed suit against CARB, stating the Truck and Bus Rule is \\"unconstitutional as it is preempted by the Federal Aviation Authorization Act (FAAAA) and seeks an injunction prohibiting CARB from enforcing the rule\\". The FAAAA, enacted in 1994 by the U.S. Congress, \\"prohibits any state or any political subdivision from enacting or enforcing any regulation related to the price, route, or service of a motor carrier\\". The California Dump Truck Owners Association also expresses concerns about the regulation because of the costs to retrofit or replace engines and the economic impact it will have on small business owners whose livelihood relies on the income generated by their trucks. Many of the association's members work closely with the construction industry; therefore, business is already slow during this economic depression. The association has alerted the Air Resources Board that many small businesses will close down if they cannot afford to comply with the regulation. The science which supports the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Air Resources Board's conclusions about the health impacts of diesel particulate matter are also disputed. The conclusions being made to protect human health are considered \\"exaggerated\\" and not supported by other research in the field, there are also claims that the Environmental Protection Agency and the Air Resources Board did not correctly calculate all the necessary cancer risks in order to properly regulate diesel emissions.McClernon, Rob. 27 April 2011. Letter to CARB Staff: Subject: PM2.5 SIP ‚Äì Why Didn‚Äôt EPA Calculate a Separate and Exact Cancer Risk from Diesel Emissions if it so Dangerous? Other Key Legal Actions & Dates: On October 30, 2013 CCTA received an order from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal denying its motion for reconsideration of the ‚Äòen banc‚Äô (full court) petition to review the EPA's determination and approval of the California State Implementation Plan or SIP. This was a longshot based on the timing issues, as the SIP was ‚Äòstealthily‚Äô filed and approved during the litigation against CARB. Related to this is a petition directly to EPA for reconsideration of the approval of the SIP by EPA ‚Äì again all ‚Äòsurreptitiously‚Äô done during direct litigation. This challenge is more an exercise of thoroughness than legal utility. The CCTA's main legal action or FAAAA argument claim, stating that state law (CARB regulations) violates federal law is also on Appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court.

All fleet owners, with the exception of small fleets, have three options to comply with the regulation: # They can choose to implement the Best Available Control Technology (BACT). To meet control requirements for both particulate matter and nitrogen oxide, owners can choose to retrofit or replace existing diesel vehicles based on a compliance schedule for engine model years every year starting in 2011. # A percent of the total fleet must meet particulate matter Best Available Control Technology and nitrogen oxide Best Available Control Technology by January 1 of each compliance year, by retrofitting or replacing existing diesel vehicles. # The fleet must meet an average requirement set by the Air Resources Board for particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, or both pollutants, depending on the Nitrogen Oxide Index and Particulate Matter Index established by CARB. These regulations apply to any business, person, federal government agency or school district that owns, operates, sells or runs vehicles operated on diesel-fuel. The requirements of the regulation are as follows under section 2025: *Fleet owners must abide by best available control technology (BACT) or by BACT percentage limits. (p. 15) *Fleets can meet requirements by achieving Particulate Matter or Nitrogen oxide reductions by replacing an engine or entire vehicle. *Records must be kept to prove compliance and maintenance of the vehicle. *Once vehicles are in compliance they must stay in compliance when operating in California. Vehicles that are exempt from the regulation include: *Used for Solid Waste Collection *Heavy-duty over 14,000 pounds that comply with BACT and are owned/operated by a municipality *Subject to fleet rule for transit agencies *19,500 pounds or less exclusively used for personal non-commercial/governmental use *Subject to drayage truck regulations *Private use motor homes *Historic (as defined by the Air Resources Board under Section 2025) *Two-engine cranes *Exclusively used for snow-removal *Off-road vehicles subject to Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations for Motor Vehicles *Authorized for emergency use *Military tactical support vehicles under Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations for Motor Vehicles *Subject to the rule for intermodal rail yards, and mobile cargo handling equipment at ports under Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations for Motor Vehicles Fleet compliance assistance tools  In order to assist truck owners to meet the standards of the regulation, the Air Resources Board provides compliance tools on their website. An Excel spreadsheet called the ‚ÄúFleet Calculator‚Äù assists owners to comply with the truck and bus rule. The owners can determine what type of compliance options may be available by inputting engine model year and emission control technology assumptions into the calculator. The tool follows regulation amendments, and a hotline has been set up for fleet owners called the Air Resources Board's Diesel Hotline. Reporting The system utilized for reporting is the Truck Regulations Upload and Compliance Reporting System (TRUCRS). Reporting guidelines are not required until 2012, however fleets can take advantage of Agricultural Vehicle Provisions or to meet requirements for Tier 0 auxiliary engines in street sweepers. By April 29, 2011, these previously mentioned two-engine street sweepers have to start reporting hourly meter readings beginning January 1, 2011. In order to meet these guidelines, reports can be made online or in paper format. Also by April 29, 2011, those fleets that reported Agricultural Provisions in the previous year can update their January 1, 2011 odometer readings in order to qualify for Agricultural Vehicle Provisions. Annual reporting will be mandatory as of January 31, 2012. All fleet owners may submit reporting materials using paper or electronic forms reporting annually until the expiration of requirements or until the year after Best Available Control Technology. Owner contact and vehicle information including but not limited to type, gross vehicle weight rating and model year are mandatory as a part of reporting. Engine information, verified diesel emission control strategies (VDECS), and highest available VDECS must also be submitted into reporting. Low-use vehicles, fleets claiming vehicle retirement credits, school bus fleets/sub-fleets, agricultural fleets, vehicles exempt from NOx BACT and emergency support vehicles have their own specified reporting conditions which coincide and build onto the overall reporting requirements. All reports must submit compliance certification signed by a responsible official or a designee to confirm that the reporting is accurate prior to submission to the executive officer. If there are any changes since the last reporting, the responsible party must report it to the executive officer. These changes include vehicles that may be removed or added to the fleet or those vehicles that have recently been repowered or retrofitted. New fleet reporting for those that elect to use the Best Available Control Technology percent limits must also submit information to the executive officer. By January 31 of each year, owners must submit information regarding claiming compliance extensions for manufacturer delays including the date of purchase of verified diesel emission control strategies, date the vehicle was placed into service, the date of removal from service, and identification of vehicle that was replaced. Exhaust retrofits A diesel particulate filter on a 2008 GM Isuzu Operators of diesel vehicles and equipment must install Diesel Emission Control Strategies (DECS) to new and existing engines in order to comply with the regulation. DECS are technology-based retrofits that reduce pollutants from diesel exhaust before they are released into the air. A commonly used DECS technology is the diesel particulate filter which serves as a substitution for an engine's original factory muffler. All Diesel Emission Control Strategies must be verified and approved by the Air Resources Board to ensure proper particulate matter and nitrogen oxide reductions will be met. Health impacts Diesel truck emissions include smog-forming nitrogen oxide and are the largest source of diesel particulate matter which is known to cause harm to the lungs, the immune system, the heart and cardiovascular system, and the developing brain. Seventy percent of California's risk for cancer from airborne toxics in 2000 was attributed to diesel particulate matter. In 2004 it was estimated that premature death rates from diesel pollution would supersede the death rates from homicides that year. It is projected that reducing emissions today would prevent 11,000 premature deaths and 16,000 hospital admissions by 2020. The cost-benefit analysis of reducing diesel pollution concluded with the results that small costs of pollution cleanup can drastically cut health-related costs, such as reduced hospitalization. The areas of California with the highest health related risks in exposure to diesel pollution are those that are the most densely populated air basins. Half of California's diesel pollution illnesses occur in the South Coast. 45% of the State's population resides here, and they breathe 30% of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx). The South Coast's projected cost of health impacts is totaled at $10.2 billion per year. The San Francisco Bay Area is the second most highly affected region in California taking in 17% of the state's diesel pollution. The estimated health related costs for the Bay Area are $3.7 billion per year.

Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139 (2010), is a United States Supreme Court case decided 7-1 in favor of Monsanto.. The decision allowed Monsanto to sell genetically modified alfalfa seeds to farmers, and allowed farmers to plant them, grow crops, harvest them, and sell the crop into the food supply. The case came about because the use of the seeds was approved by regulatory authorities; the approval was challenged in district court by Geertson Seed Farms and other groups who were concerned that the genetically modified alfalfa would spread too easily, and the challengers won. Monsanto appealed the district court decision and lost, and appealed again to the Supreme Court, where Monsanto won, thus upholding the original approval and allowing the seeds to be sold.Monsanto Co. and Forage Genetics International; Availability Determination of Nonregulated Status for Alfalfa Genetically Engineered for Tolerance to the Herbicide Glyphosate Federal Register, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 27 June 2005, Retrieved 28 August 2012 In 2005 the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) deregulated Monsanto's Roundup-ready alfalfa (RRA) based on an Environmental Assessment (EA) of Monsanto's RRA.USDA/APHIS Environmental Assessment United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Biotechnology Regulatory Services, October 2004, Retrieved 28 August 2012 In 2006, Geertson Seed Farm and others filed suit in a California district court against APHIS' deregulation of RRA. The district court disallowed APHIS' deregulation of RRA and issued an injunction against any new planting of RRA pending the preparation of a much more extensive Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).0503.pdf Memorandum and Order Re: Permanent Injunction United States District Court for Northern California, Case No C 06-01075 CR, 3 May 2007, Retrieved 28 August 2012 The court also refused to allow a partial deregulation. After losing an appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,McEowan, Roger (15 January 2010)Roundup-Ready Alfalfa Injunction Upheld Iowa State University, Center for Agricultural Law and Taxation, Retrieved 28 August 2012 Monsanto and others appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2009. In 2010 the Supreme Court reversed the lower court's decision to bar partial deregulation of RRA pending completion of the EIS. They stated that, before a court disallow a partial deregulation, a plaintiff must show that it has suffered irreparable injury. \\"The District Court abused its discretion in enjoining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of RRA pending the agency‚Äôs completion of its detailed environmental review.\\" The Supreme court did not consider the district court's ruling disallowing RRA's deregulation and consequently RRA was still a regulated crop waiting for APHIS' completion of an EIS. At the time, both sides claimed victory. This was the first ruling of the United States Supreme Court on genetically engineered crops.Koons, Jennifer (21 June 2010) Supreme Court Lifts Ban on Planting GM Alfalfa New York Times, Energy & Environment, Retrieved 28 August 2012 Background As of 2010, alfalfa is the 4th largest cash crop and grows on approximately of land throughout the United States. This crop is grown for two primary purposes; hay for livestock consumption and seed for future stock. Since alfalfa undergoes open pollination, many farmers that grow organic and commercial alfalfa were concerned about the potential for cross-pollination occurring between the genetically modified alfalfa and non-genetically modified alfalfa.Alfalfa seeds APHIS, a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture, has the right to regulate any organism and product that is altered or created by genetic engineering. They use the precautionary standard when addressing genetically modified organisms (GMO's). GMO's are classified as plant pests under the Plant Protection Act (PPA) and are therefore regulated articles. Anyone can choose to petition the regulated status of a GMO. APHIS is then required to perform an Environmental Impact Statement ( EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). If, in an Environmental Assessment (EA), no significant environmental impact is found, then a full EIS is not required. The petitioner, Monsanto, is the owner and licensor of the intellectual property rights to RRA, and licenses the technology to Forage Genetics, developer of the Roundup Ready alfalfa seed. In April, 2004, Monsanto petitioned APHIS for deregulation of RRA. APHIS has three options: # Take no action # Completely deregulate, requires a finding of \\"no significant impact\\" # Partially deregulate RRA, by imposing geographical restrictions In 2005, APHIS prepared a draft Environmental Assessment and allowed for public comments. Of the total 663 comments only 137 were supportive of the APHIS decision to deregulate RRA. The 537 opponents were mainly organic and conventional farmers who feared that cross-pollination would occur and would have detrimental effects on the alfalfa market. APHIS released its EA, finding that RRA would not have any significant adverse impact on the environment. APHIS found that alfalfa is pollinated by bees and that pollination has been documented to occur up to from a pollen source. Therefore, it was highly unlikely RRA would have a significant impact on non- GMO/organic farms. In February 2006, plaintiffs (see parties below) filed suit stating that APHIS violated NEPA. Subsequently, the district court ruled that APHIS had failed to take a \\"hard look\\" at RRA and its potential for genetic contamination. Monsanto and Forage Genetics argued that many farmers had already purchased and planted or planned to plant RRA seeds for the new harvest. In order to allow the planting of seed already purchased, the court granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting the planting and sale of RRA after March 30, 2007, pending a permanent injunction. In April 2007 the permanent injunction was granted. In 2008 Monsanto and APHIS appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which upheld the decision of the district court. The defendants appealed, and on April 27, 2010 this case was argued in front of the United States Supreme Court. = Parties = This case arose from the 2005 decision made by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), an arm of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). APHIS ( the defendant) performs a variety of services and is tasked with both protecting and promoting U.S. agricultural health and regulating genetically modified organisms. APHIS has the authority to regulate any genetically engineered products that are plant pests or believed to be plant pests. Monsanto ( the defendant-intervenors), is a corporation that manufactures several different chemicals, including pesticides and herbicides. A problem arose when Monsanto applied for deregulation of two specific lines of its Roundup Ready Alfalfa. APHIS responded favorably to Monsanto's request, but the deregulation was put on hold when Geertson Seed Farms (an Oregon Company), Trask Family Seeds (a South Dakota business) and other environmental groups sought to permanently enjoin APHIS from deregulating RRA until a final Environmental Impact Statement was completed. = Granting of certiorari = Certiorari was granted January 15, 2010. = Issues = The Supreme Court limited its inquiry to whether the lower court had abused its discretion. Its analysis turned on the following questions: #Was Geertson exempt from having to show a likelihood of irreparable harm in order to obtain an injunction? #Did the District Court improperly grant the injunction without holding an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed facts? #Did the court of appeals incorrectly affirm the injunction prior to the \\"remote possibility of reparable harm\\" standard articulated in Winter v. NRDC? It was noted that no party challenged the fact that APHIS had violated NEPA and that vacating the deregulation was within the District Court's discretion. Decision = Standing = 1. Respondents (Geertson) have standing to seek injunctive relief, and petitioners (Monsanto) have standing to seek this Court‚Äôs review of the Ninth Circuit‚Äôs judgment affirming the entry of such relief. (a) The Court held that Monsanto satisfied all three Article III requirements for standing to seek review of the lower court decision. (b) The Court affirmed the District Court's finding that Geertson had established a reasonable probability that their conventional alfalfa crops would be infected with the engineered Roundup Ready gene if RRA were completely deregulated. 2. The District Court abused its discretion by enjoining APHIS from effecting a partial deregulation and in prohibiting the planting of RRA pending the agency‚Äôs completion of its detailed environmental review. (a) The Court assumes that the District Court acted lawfully in vacating the agency‚Äôs decision to completely deregulate RRA, but addresses whether it overreached its authority by granting a nationwide injunction pending completion of the EIS process. (b) Geertson did not satisfy the four- factor test for a permanent injunction articulated in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC. (c) None of the four factors justified the District Court's decision prohibiting APHIS from \\"partially\\" deregulating RRA until completion of the EIS. (d) A nationwide injunction was too drastic a remedy given the facts and the District Court's refusal to consider partial deregulation. = District Court's Injunction = The Supreme Court stated that the District Court only considered a complete deregulation of RRA pending the completion of an EIS by APHIS. The four-factor test for granting a permanent injunction: #The plaintiff has to have suffered an irreparable injury. #The remedies available by law are inadequate to compensate for that injury. #The court needs to consider the balance of hardship between the plaintiff and the defendant. #The public interest would not be harmed by this permanent injunction. The Supreme Court ruled that the District Court erred by imposing a nationwide injunction, banning APHIS from partially deregulating RRA because all four factors could not be met, particularly, the irreparable injury factor. It was also held that a NEPA violation does not warrant automatic injunctive relief. The Supreme Court also stated that if a partial deregulation presented further danger to the respondents, they may file another suit for injunctive relief. And the respondents could not prove that partial deregulation would cause irreparable harm. In addition, the Supreme Court found that the District Court further erred in issuing injunctive relief because it preempted APHIS' ability to enact a partial deregulation that may not pose any appreciable risk of environmental harm. It was also held that because the District Court did not consider the use of a less extraordinary measure to relieve the injury claimed by Geertson, the injunction was inappropriate. The second factor, that there must be no other option available to the court to remedy the injury, could not be met because the vacatur would have prevented the complete deregulation. Dissent In his dissent, Stevens wrote that the majority decision was based on an incorrect understanding of the District Court decision, namely, an understanding that \\"the District Court enjoined APHIS from partially deregulating RRA in any sense\\" and in doing so, the District Court had exceeded its authority. Stevens did not accept that reading, finding that the District Court's decision addressed \\"only (1) total deregulation orders of the kind that spawned this lawsuit, and (2) the particular partial deregulation order proposed to the court by APHIS.\\" The majority's understanding and its implications were not the subject of briefs nor extended arguments, and Stevens therefore dissented because \\"the key legal premise on which the Court decides this case was never adequately presented. Of course, this is not standard ‚Äî or sound ‚Äî judicial practice.... Today‚Äôs decision illustrates why, for it is quite unclear whether the Court‚Äôs premise is correct, and the Court has put itself in the position of deciding legal issues without the aid of briefing.\\" In Stevens' dissent, he maintained that the injunction was warranted because there was a clear danger that cross- pollination could happen, even in controlled settings, and that APHIS's ability to regulate and prevent this contamination was limited.

His stage to Cheyenne has a pair of female passengers, Ann Kincaid and saloon singer Emily Carson, when their coach is ambushed by the Sundance Kid and his gang. But when he opens the strongbox, Sundance is furious to find nothing but a mocking poem from The Poet. Jim pretends to be The Poet to infiltrate his gang. What he doesn't know is that Ann is married to the notorious outlaw. She goes along with the ruse to see where it leads. Her husband, the real Poet, is Ed Landers, a trusted Wells Fargo employee, who promises to pull one last job and then get away with Ann safely to San Francisco. Sundance is once again foiled on a job by the Poet getting there first, and three of Sundance's men are killed. He realizes that Ann has double-crossed him. Jim confides to Landers his true identity, not realizing Landers is the man he's after. Landers promptly tells Cheyenne's sheriff that Jim is not just pretending to be the Poet, but is him. Ann detects a whiff of perfume on Landers that she recognizes. It is Emily's, proof to Ann that her lying, thieving husband plans to take Emily away to San Francisco instead of her.

Personal life and political views In 2014, Elissa took to social media to condemn the atrocities committed by ISIS against minorities, stating \\"I'm Lebanese and I'm proudly Christian, shame on such people.\\" Elissa is an outspoken advocate of women‚Äôs rights in the Middle East. An advocate for Breast cancer awareness, Elissa revealed her previously private diagnosis and defeat of an early stage of the disease with the release of her music video for \\"Ila Kol Elli Bihebbouni\\"; previously keeping it a secret from both the press and general public from her diagnosis in late-2017. The video ends with the following message: \\"I've recovered, I've beaten the illness and I won... Early detection of breast cancer can save your life... Don't ignore it, face it... Do it not only for yourself, but for your loved ones.\\" Many applauded her for \\"breaking the taboo\\" of breast cancer awareness in the Middle East and therefore influenced and encouraged women to be checked for the disease. The hashtags #Elissa (ÿßŸÑŸäÿ≥ÿß#) and #To_All_Who_Love_Me (ÿßŸÑŸâ_ŸÉŸÑ_ÿßŸÑŸÑŸä_ÿ®Ÿäÿ≠ÿ®ŸàŸÜŸä#) began to trend in Lebanon and surrounding countries in the Middle East. In October 2018, Elissa was chosen as an ambassador for a breast cancer awareness campaign in Beirut. Elissa admitted in May Chidiac Foundation conference that she was subject of bullying for her mouth on social media, but she said, \\"When you achieve what I achieved in life, you can come and say whatever you want.\\" She is a supporter of Lebanese Forces party and its leader Samir Geagea as she backed him for presidency before the election of Michel Aoun.

Life  The son of George Gee of Manchester, a shoemaker, he was baptised at Manchester Collegiate Church on 29 August 1657. After attending Manchester Grammar School, he was admitted a sub-sizar at St John's College, Cambridge, on 9 May 1676. He graduated B.A. in 1679 and M.A. in 1683. He was incorporated in his master's degree at Oxford 4 March 1684. Subsequently, he is styled D.D., a Lambeth degree from 1695. He took a prominent part in the anti- Catholic controversy towards the end of James II's reign. In May 1688 he was appointed rector of St Benet's, Paul's Wharf, London, and soon after he was called chaplain in ordinary to William III and Mary II. On 6 December 1701 he was installed prebendary of Westminster. Twenty years afterwards, on 9 December 1721, he was instituted dean of Peterborough, but he resigned that office for the deanery of Lincoln, to which he was presented by the crown on 30 March 1722. A few days later he was installed prebendary of Lincoln. At the time of his death he was also incumbent of St Margaret's, Westminster, and rector of Chevening, Kent. He died on 1 March 1730, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

History  The Beach Ball Classic was founded by Marshall University basketball coach Dan D'Antoni in 1981 in order to bring more high school competition to the east coast. \\"The Classic,\\" as it is known locally, began as an eight team competition featuring four teams from South Carolina and four teams from other states; thanks to strong community support, however, it quickly evolved into a 16-team national holiday event.http://www.nba.com/coachfile/dan_dantoni/index.html In 1998, the Classic committee decided to add a women's tournament which added to its already high competition. The \\"Classic\\" is held right after Christmas every year, lasting roughly four or five days until the new year hits. The Crescent Bank Holiday Invitational is held before Christmas and features the newly added women's tournament. The Invitational also feature the Carolina Challenge, which is an eight team tournament of the local women's colleges.  Location, accommodations, and tickets  The Beach Ball Classic is held at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center every year before and after Christmas. Crown Reef Resort at South Beach Resort is a major accommodation for travelers who want to spend their Christmas at the Classic. They offer specials for fans along with other little extras which change yearly. Tickets are purchased at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center the day of the game with general admission starting at $12.00 and reserved seating at $15.00 per game. They also offer books of tickets for the classic games as well as the Crescent Bank Holiday Invitational games starting at $75.00 for the Classic and $15.00 for the Invitational. The Crescent Banks in the area also offer a limited amount of free tickets to the Invitational games. Another feature that has been added is the Carolina Challenge. This eight team tournament features some of the local women's colleges and tickets are priced at $10.00.  Players  The Classic is the home of many past and present NBA stars and will continue highlighting such players if the path its on continues. From Mainland (Fla.), Vince Carter. Carter's team struggled at the 1994 Beach Ball Classic after he broke his hand in the opener, but he put on one of the most memorable, high-flying performances in tournament history by playing the rest of the way left-handed. This 13-year NBA veteran, who won the 1999 NBA Rookie of the Year Award and the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest is just one of the great players that have showcased their talents in the Classic. From Simon Gratz (Pa.), Rasheed Wallace. Wallace was a three-time Beach Baller who led his team to two tourney titles while setting records for most blocked shots in a game (16) and tournament (24). Wallace has been to the NBA Finals twice but only winning once with the Detroit Pistons. Wallace is currently the all-time leader in the NBA with most technical fouls at 304. From Lower Merion (Pa.), Kobe Bryant. Bryant dominated while playing in the Classic, accumulating 43 points in one game then leading his one-man team to a state title and going straight to the NBA. Now the youngest player to ever reach 33,000 points in an NBA career, he has since retired with five NBA Finals Championships. From Latta (S.C.), Raymond Felton. The young players are loaded at point guard, but Felton gets the edge for orchestrating the greatest upset in Beach Ball history when the Class A Vikings knocked off national powerhouse DeMatha (Md.). Felton is one of the younger stars that play in the NBA and that played in the Classic. Felton was recently in a major 3-team trade which sent him to the Denver Nuggets from the New York Knicks. Felton now plays for the Oklahoma City Thunder. http://www.nba.com/players/raymond/felton/101109  Sponsors  The Beach Ball Classic is and has been sponsored by major corporations ever since it started. Some of the major companies featured are: Enterprise Rent-A-Car, McDonald's, HTC, US Foodservice, TGI Fridays, Sonic Drive In, and Verizon Wireless. These companies help the tournament come together. In order to host anything it costs money and these companies are willing to invest into the Beach Ball Classic.

The federal government created several programs, or government sponsored entities, to foster mortgage lending, construction and encourage home ownership. These programs include the Government National Mortgage Association (known as Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (known as Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (known as Freddie Mac). The subprime mortgage crisis was one of the first indicators of the 2007‚Äì2010 financial crisis, characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, and the resulting decline of securities backing said mortgages. The earlier savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and 1990s and the national mortgage crisis of the 1930s also arose primarily from unsound mortgage lending. The mortgage crisis has led to a rise in foreclosures, leading to the 2010 United States foreclosure crisis.  Mortgage lenders  Mortgage lending is a major sector finance in the United States, and many of the guidelines that loans must meet are suited to satisfy investors and mortgage insurers. Mortgages are debt securities and can be conveyed and assigned freely to other holders. In the U.S., the Federal government created several programs, or government sponsored entities, to foster mortgage lending, construction and encourage home ownership. These programs include the Government National Mortgage Association (known as Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (known as Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (known as Freddie Mac). These programs work by offering a guarantee on the mortgage payments of certain conforming loans. These loans are then securitized and issued at a slightly lower interest rate to investors, and are known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). After securitization these are sometimes called \\"agency paper\\" or \\"agency bonds\\". Whether or not a loan is conforming depends on the size and set of guidelines which are implemented in an automated underwriting system.Gates SW, Perry VG, Zorn PM. (2002). Automated Underwriting in Mortgage Lending: Good News for the Underserved?. Housing Policy Debate 13(2). Fannie Mae Foundation. Non- conforming mortgage loans which cannot be sold to Fannie or Freddie are either \\"jumbo\\" or \\"subprime\\", and can also be packaged into mortgage-backed securities. Some companies, called correspondent lenders, sell all or most of their closed loans to these investors, accepting some risks for issuing them. They often offer niche loans at higher prices that the investor does not wish to originate. Securitization allows the banks to quickly relend the money to other borrowers (including in the form of mortgages) and thereby to create more mortgages than the banks could with the amount they have on deposit. This in turn allows the public to use these mortgages to purchase homes, something the government wishes to encourage. Investors in conforming loans, meanwhile, gain low-risk income at a higher interest rate (essentially the mortgage rate, minus the cuts of the bank and GSE) than they could gain from most other bonds. Securitization has grown rapidly in the last 10 years as a result of the wider dissemination of technology in the mortgage lending world. For borrowers with superior credit, government loans and ideal profiles, this securitization keeps rates almost artificially low, since the pools of funds used to create new loans can be refreshed more quickly than in years past, allowing for more rapid outflow of capital from investors to borrowers without as many personal business ties as in the past. The increased amount of lending led (among other factors) to the United States housing bubble of 2000-2006. The growth of lightly regulated derivative instruments based on mortgage- backed securities, such as collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, is widely reported as a major causative factor behind the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis. As a result of the housing bubble, many banks, including Fannie Mae, established tighter lending guidelines making it much more difficult to obtain a loan. = Predatory mortgage lending = There is concern in the U.S. that consumers are often victims of predatory mortgage lending . The main concern is that mortgage lenders and brokers, operating legally, are finding loopholes in the law to obtain additional profit. The typical scenario is that terms of the loan are beyond the means of the ill- informed and uneducated borrower. The borrower makes a number of interest and principal payments, and then defaults. The lender then takes the property and recovers the amount of the loan, and also keeps the interest and principal payments, as well as loan origination fees. = Delinquency = At the start of 2008, 5.6% of all mortgages in the United States were delinquent.Can the World Stop the Slide?, TIME, February 4, 2008, page 27. By the end of the first quarter that rate had risen, encompassing 6.4% of residential properties. This number did not include the 2.5% of homes in foreclosure.  U.S. mortgage process  = Origination = In the U.S., the process by which a mortgage is secured by a borrower is called origination. This involves the borrower submitting a loan application and documentation related to his/her financial history and/or credit history to the underwriter, which is typically a bank. Sometimes, a third party is involved, such as a mortgage broker. This entity takes the borrower's information and reviews a number of lenders, selecting the ones that will best meet the needs of the consumer.MortgageHippo. \\"What is the Difference Between Mortgage Brokers and Mortgage Lenders?\\". Origination is regulated by laws including the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (1974). Credit scores are often used, and these must comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Additionally, various state laws may apply. Underwriters receive the application and determine whether the loan can be accepted. If the underwriter is not satisfied with the documentation provided by the borrower, additional documentation and conditions may be imposed, called stipulations. Documentation and credit history can be used to categorize loans into high- quality A-paper, Alt-A, and subprime. Loans may also be categorized by whether there is full documentation, alternative documentation, or little to no documentations, with extreme \\"no income no job no asset\\" loans referred to as \\"NINJA\\" loans. No doc loans were popular in the early 2000s, but were largely phased out following the subprime mortgage crisis. Low-doc loans carry a higher interest rate and were theoretically available only to borrowers with excellent credit and additional income that may be hard to document (e.g. self-employment income). As of July 2010, no-doc loans were reportedly still being offered, but more selectively and with high down payment requirements (e.g., 40%).Fitch S. (2010). No-Doc Mortgages Are Back?!. Forbes. The following documents are typically required for traditional underwriter review. Over the past several years, use of \\"automated underwriting\\" statistical models has reduced the amount of documentation required from many borrowers. Such automated underwriting engines include Freddie Mac's \\"Loan Product Advisor\\" (fka \\"Loan Prospector\\") and Fannie Mae's \\"Desktop Underwriter\\". For borrowers who have excellent credit and very acceptable debt positions, there may be virtually no documentation of income or assets required at all. Many of these documents are also not required for no-doc and low-doc loans. * Credit Report * 1003 ‚Äî Uniform Residential Loan Application * 1004 ‚Äî Uniform Residential Appraisal Report * 1005 ‚Äî Verification Of Employment (VOE) * 1006 ‚Äî Verification Of Deposit (VOD) * 1007 ‚Äî Single Family Comparable Rent Schedule * 1008 ‚Äî Transmittal Summary * Copy of deed of current home * Federal income tax records for last two years * Verification of Mortgage (VOM) or Verification of Payment (VOP) * Borrower's Authorization * Purchase Sales Agreement * 1084A and 1084B (Self-Employed Income Analysis) and 1088 (Comparative Income Analysis) - used if borrower is self-employed = Closing costs = In addition to the down payment, the final deal of the mortgage includes closing costs which include fees for \\"points\\" to lower the interest rate, application fees, credit check, attorney fees, title insurance, appraisal fees, inspection fees, underwriting fee and other possible miscellaneous fees.Cut Your Closing Costs.

International comparisons Fixed-rate mortgage are common in the United States, unlike most of Western Europe where variable-rate mortgages are more common. The United States has home ownership rates comparable to Europe, but overall default rates are lower in Europe than in the United States. Mortgage loan financing relies more on secondary mortgage markets and less on formal government guarantees backed by covered bonds and deposits. Prepayment penalties are discouraged by underwriting requirements of large organizations such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgages loans are often nonrecourse debt, unlike the most of the world.

Immediately preceding the onset of the American War of Independence in 1775, these six regions were renamed \\"Military districts\\" by the North Carolina Provincial Congress and used for organizing the North Carolina militia. The other districts were Edenton, Halifax, Hillsborough, New Bern, and Wilmington districts. The districts designation was discontinued in 1835 during the North Carolina Constitution Convention. Background In 1766, the Province of North Carolina House of Burgess, at the direction of Province of North Carolina Governor William Tryon, divided the state into six judicial districts. The districts did not do away with the county divisions of the state, which continued. Since the boundaries of Tryon County (part of the Salisbury District) originally stretched into territory which was later found to belong to South Carolina (due to surveying errors), the Salisbury District was, for a time, the legal center of modern-day northwestern South Carolina as well. After the Third North Carolina Provincial Congress held at Hillsborough, North Carolina (Aug. 20-Sept. 10, 1775), the districts became known as \\"military\\" vice \\"judicial\\" districts.. These districts were used to organize the North Carolina Minutemen Battalions for a six month trial as state troops, beginning on September 1, 1775. By April 10, 1776, the Provincial Congress decided in favor or District Brigades of militia with county militia regiments. Each brigade was led by a brigadier general. The county militia regiments were subordinated to the brigade. At that time, two additional districts were added, further dividing the western part of the state (Washington District Regiment in 1776 and Morgan District in 1784). Also, district representatives were chosen and sent to the North Carolina Provincial Congress. These representatives were instrumental in the passage of the Halifax Resolves, in April 1776, during the Fourth Provincial Congress, which is now often referred to as the \\"Halifax Congress.\\" History The Salisbury District was based in the town of Salisbury, North Carolina, in Rowan County. Salisbury was established as the county seat of Rowan County in 1755, two years after Rowan County was created from Anson County. Edmund Fanning was made the first official associate justice for the Judicial District of Salisbury in March 1766. The third colonial court, which regularly assembled at Salisbury, was the court of oyer, terminer and general jail delivery. This court had jurisdiction over criminal cases. The Salisbury District court met in June and December of each year. James Smith had served as the justice presiding over the \\"Court of Pleas and Quarter Session for Rowan County,\\" under King George III, from 1770 thru 1775. From 1775, he \\"took a prominent and active part in every movement tending to throw off the yoke of tyranny...\\" On April 22, 1776, he was appointed to major in the Rowan County Regiment of the North Carolina militia, which was commanded by Colonel Francis Locke. Colonel Lock assumed command from Brigadier General Griffith Rutherford who was selected as commander of the Salisbury District Brigade. Boundaries The Salisbury District originally included Anson, Guilford, Mecklenburg, Rowan, Surry, and Tryon counties. A later addition was the Washington District (also known as the original Washington County, North Carolina) which covered most of the present day State of Tennessee.\\"...all that part of this State comprehended with the lines aforesaid shall be henceforth be and remain Washington County and is declared to be part of Salisbury District.\\"‚ÄîNorth Carolina State Records, Vol. 24; p. 141; NC Laws -1777; Chapter 31; Whitney; p. 681 Eventually, as new settlements were carved out of the wilderness, the Salisbury District encompassed the counties of Lincoln, Montgomery, Richmond, Rutherford, Wilkes (all in present-day North Carolina), and Sullivan (in present-day Tennessee) as well.North Carolina Revolutionary pay vouchers * In 1775, Salisbury District included the following countries: Rowan, Anson, Guilbord, Mecklenburg, Surry, and Tryon counties. * In 1779, Salisbury District included the following counties: Rowan, Anson, Burke, Guilford, Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Richmond, Rutherford, Surry, and Wilkes counties. * In 1783 at the end of the war, Salisbury District included: Rowan, Anson, Guiford, Mecklenburg, Montgomery, Richmond, and Surry counties. * As late as 1800, the term Salisbury District was used in reference to the regional Federal Census headquarters in part of North Carolina.

The site is a designated 'Local Wildlife Site' following a survey in 1981 by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and others. The survey recorded that the site is a 'Phragmites dominated area with open water'. The surveyors record that \\"The loch is surrounded to a great extent by bed of reed canary grass with a dense zone of the sedge Carex aquatilis. There is a good admixture of marsh species, and an admixture of willow (Salix) species in the north-east section. In the surrounding fields there is an interesting interaction between the field ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) and the marsh ragwort (Senecio aquaticus), giving rise to a substantial amount of the hybrid Senecio x osterfeldii. There is a good floristic structure at the site and it is also of real importance due to the presence of the very rare Cowbane (Cicuta virosa). Birds Bird species recorded here include common kestrel, reed bunting, water rail, robin, starling, common snipe, mallard, and mute swan. Rare species are Carex aquatilis, brown sedge (Carex disticha), cowbane (Cicuta virosa), white water lily (Nymphaea alba), ivy-leaved water crowfoot (Ranunculus hederaceus), and bay willow (salix pentandra).

His work draws from Western art history, the mythology of art, and visual culture.  Career  Joe Fig was born in 1968 in Seaford, New York, and received both his BFA and MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York. His early work includes reproductions of the studios of legendary modern artists, such as Jackson Pollock, Jasper Johns, and Willem de Kooning. He also previously produced a group of paintings that focus on the art historical moment when the young pioneers of modernism‚Äîlike √âdouard Manet‚Äîovertook the old guard of painting. In 2005, Fig turned his attention to the work spaces and lives of contemporary artists. In his most recent work, he begins by conducting an interview with an artist in his or her studio. Fig asks them a series of questions about their daily routines and the history of their practice, before photographing and recording their studio and its contents. He then creates a meticulous replicate of that artist's studio, in sculpture, painting, and/or drawing. The artworks both champion the creative process and reveal the mundane tasks involved in making art. Each portrait documents how an artist has organized his or her space, as well as the tools and inspirations he or she keeps at hand. The works contain such details as spectacles resting on a desk, books stacked on shelves, or paint drips on a floor. By presenting this \\"god's-eye view\\" of artists in their studios, Fig not only demystifies the creative act, but also illuminates the contrast between spaces where art is made and spaces where art is shown. Fig is represented by Cristin Tierney Gallery in New York.  Writing  Fig is the author of the books Inside the Painter's Studio and Inside the Artist's Studio, published by Princeton Architectural Press in 2009 and 2015, respectively. In complement to his artistic practice, both books document Fig's conversations with the artists he has interviewed, and include photographs of their studios. His sculptures and paintings of the interviewees' studios are also illustrated. Fig's most recent book, Inside the Artist's Studio, provides insights into the lives and studios of several select contemporary artists, including Leonardo Drew, Kate Gilmore, Roxy Paine, Will Ryman, and Laurie Simmons. Fig also contributed to the book Narcissus in the Studio, which was published by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2010. Publications * Fig, Joe. Inside the Artist‚Äôs Studio.

The club was founded as the United Cricket Club, on 18 September 1862 by players from existing Auckland clubs and was often referred to as 'the United' because of this. The aim of the club was to acquire more regular and more challenging competition than that which was on offer in Auckland at the time. The club's first ground was a field in Newmarket donated by local farmer, James Dilworth, but its distance from the city prompted the administration, on behalf of the cricketers of Auckland, to apply for the use of the Auckland Domain and it began practicing and playing there in 1863. When the Auckland Cricket Association's first District Scheme came into effect in 1903, the club became the Grafton District Cricket Club. It was so‚Äìnamed because, under the terms of the scheme, it was allocated the area surrounding the Auckland Domain to draw players from. The Scheme was abandoned in 1920, at which time the club paired its original and district names to form Grafton United. This remained in place until the second District Scheme of 1952, when the club became Metropolitan District Cricket Club for three seasons and thereafter Grafton and Districts Cricket Club. The Scheme ended in 1967 and the club returned to the Grafton United name. Victoria Park has been the club's home since the Auckland Cricket Association shifted clubs away from Eden Park in the early 1950s and, when the City Council leased the Campbell Free Kindergarten to it for a clubrooms in 1960, it came to be thought of as Grafton's home ground exclusively. In partnership with the council, a new clubrooms and indoor net facility was opened on the site of the old grandstand in 1993 and this continues to be the club's home. The club celebrated its sesquicentenary in the 2012/13 season.

On several occasions airframes were rebuilt and/or reused, both within a program or in a succeeding program. All the aircraft in the I-3 program were affected by delays in the development of the Klimov VK-3 afterburning bypass turbojet engine, and its cancellation and replacement by the Lyulka AL-7F turbojet engine.  Design and development  Both the I-3 and I-3P were ordered by the Council of Ministers on June 3, 1953 ‚Äì the I-3 as a frontline fighter and the I-3P as an all-weather interceptor. They were developed in parallel with the I-1/2 program but had nothing in common with it except a similar wing. On the other hand, the I-3's visual appearance was so similar to the Sukhoi S-1 (the Su-7 prototype) that a common design specification and fundamental research source seems likely. Compared to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 the I-3U was slightly larger and heavier, but aerodynamically very similar.  Variants  = I-3 (I-380) = The I-3 had a longer forward fuselage compared to the I-1 and the cockpit was positioned further ahead of the 60 degree swept wing. Armament consisted of three 30 mm Nudelman-Richter NR-30 cannon, each with 65 rounds ‚Äì one in the left wing root and two on the right side. The Klimov VK-3 turbojet was never provisioned or fitted to the airframe. In 1956 the I-3 was converted into the I-3U. = I-3P = Developed in parallel with the I-3, but equipped with the same Almaz search radar as the I-1. Armament consisted of two 30 mm Nudelman- Richter NR-30 cannon. In addition, two ORO-57K rocket launchers, each with 16 55 mm ARS-57 (S-5) unguided rockets or two 190 mm TRS-190 unguided rockets or two 212 mm ARS-212 unguided rockets or two 250 kg bombs could be carried on pylons under the wing.

During that time, she met Ymir following a skirmish with some drunken women, and has grown acquainted to her despite the latter's merchant-like personality. It is also shown that she tends to rush with her Holy Poses, often rendering them ineffective. :Sigui is very eager to bring down the Rebel Army, who she considers to be a band of heretics, and sees their leader Annelotte, who carries demon blood, as an abomination.

Despite this, they get along well. Nanael, who went on a rampage, ordered Laila to clean the chaos on the human world with the \\"Divine Punishment\\" using Holy Milk. Because she is not a true angel, Laila must wear the sacred tool , an artificial wing, to fly, and she is armed with the Heavenly Rifle which fires Holy Milk.

She wields a huge nodachi called which she carries on her back (she claims on her profile that she picked it up somewhere). She is also able to play a whistle made from seashells that boosts her and her comrades' strength.

She despises the Queen's Blade tournament, as it maintains the present world. With techniques to manipulate departed souls, to summon and to curse, it has reached the extreme that her magical power is perhaps the strongest in the Continent. The true character of the Swamp Witch has the form of a wicked spirit, and her soul and magic are confined in a treasure that has a spider-like form. Unless she parasitizes on an excellent body, her power will be extremely restricted. However, the Swamp Witch has finally obtained the supreme body called Werbellia, and is able to display her complete power. Werbellia is the demonic daughter of the Demon King who lives in the Netherworld, and is Aldra's and Annelotte's mother.

This was known as the . Although she's like an incarnation of evil, she is a being adored by most of her subordinates. Apart from her many unintelligible remarks, she is generous and magnanimous, with an evil charisma. :Werbellia makes a brief cameo appearance in the final episode of Queen's Blade: Beautiful Fighters, where she appears (albeit in hooded form) to curse Tomoe during the latter's journey back to Hinomoto.

She encouraged the research of the , and civilization progressed very quickly with the effort. She also invalidated the traditional aristocrat system to give a chance of prosperity to all the people regardless of their birth. :By becoming Queen, however, Claudette's strictness has increased, and thus became a ruthless tyrant. Those who break the law are punished without mercy, and any opposition to the Queen are completely obliterated by a powerful military force.

Not only does she need to sleep that long, she also experiences sudden cases of narcolepsy, often requiring her to retreat to her hideout whenever she feels drowsiness. Nonetheless, she is a well-revered warrior who is loved by many. Due to the fighting spirit ingrained in her body, even when she falls asleep due to her curse, she viciously attacks all who approach her carelessly.

She became much cooler in personality, no longer being afraid of snakes, and rumors from those who knew the often teary-eyed Ymir say she is now another person entirely.

However, during her travels in the Continent, a curse of blindness was cast on her by the Swamp Witch. Despite her loss of sight, Tomoe did not lose her burning heart and gentle smile. The day her eyes are opened again will probably be the day when the world will submit to Hinamoto's sword skills.

She was a life-long member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39), she was a war correspondent for the Daily Express and is alleged to have been a press agent for the Comintern. A skilled writer, Ross was also a film critic for The Daily Worker, and her criticisms of early Soviet cinema were later described as \\"ingenious piece[s] of dialectical sophistry.\\" Throughout her life, she wrote political criticism and anti-fascist polemics, as well as manifestos for a number of disparate organisations such as the British Workers' Film and Photo League. During her itinerant youth in Weimar Berlin, Ross was a cabaret singer and fashion model. Her Berlin escapades served as the basis for the fictional character Sally Bowles in Christopher Isherwood's The Berlin Stories,: \\"Isherwood's Sally Bowles was based on Jean Ross, a spunky British woman whom he met during his Berlin days with W.H. Auden and Stephen Spender.\\" a work cited by literary critics as deftly capturing the hedonistic nihilism of the Weimar era.: The Berlin Stories \\"form one coherent snapshot of a lost world, the antic, cosmopolitan Berlin of the 1930s, where jolly expatriates dance faster and faster, as if that would save them from the creeping rise of Nazism.\\" The work was later adapted into the stage musical Cabaret. For the remainder of her life, Ross believed the public association of herself with the na√Øve and apolitical character of Bowles occluded her lifelong work as a professional writer and political activist. Sharing this belief, her daughter Sarah Caudwell later wrote a newspaper article in an attempt to correct the historical record and to dispel misconceptions regarding Ross. According to Caudwell, \\"in the transformations of the novel for stage and cinema the characterisation of Sally [Bowles] has become progressively cruder and less subtle and the stories about 'the original' correspondingly more high-coloured.\\" In addition to inspiring the character of Sally Bowles, Ross is credited by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and other sources as the muse for lyricist Eric Maschwitz's jazz standard \\"These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You),\\" one of the 20th century's more enduring love songs. Although Maschwitz's estranged wife Hermione Gingold later claimed the popular song was written for herself or actress Anna May Wong, Maschwitz himself contradicted these claims. Instead, Maschwitz cited \\"fleeting memories of [a] young love,\\" and most scholars posit Maschwitz's youthful affair with Ross as inspiring the song.  Early life and education  Raised \\"in luxury\\" at Maison Ballassiano in the British protectorate of Alexandria, Egypt, Ross was the eldest daughter of Charles Ross (1880‚Äì1938), a Scottish cotton classifier for the Bank of Egypt. She was brought up with her four siblings in a staunchly liberal, anti-Tory household. Ross was educated in England at Leatherhead Court, Surrey. As an unusually intelligent pupil who had completed all the sixth form curricula by the age of 16, she was profoundly bored and loathed school. She became openly rebellious when informed that she must remain at school for another year and must \\"occupy her time doing all the same work all over again.\\" To gain her freedom, she feigned a teenage pregnancy and was summoned before the school's stern headmistress: Ross falsely insisted to the headmistress that she was pregnant, and the Leatherhead Court schoolmasters sequestered the teenage Ross in a nearby sanatorium until a family relative arrived and retrieved her. However, when they discovered the pregnancy was feigned, Ross was formally expelled. Exasperated by her defiant behaviour, her parents sent her abroad to Pensionnat Mistral, an elite Swiss finishing school in Neuch√¢tel; however, Ross either was expelled or fled the school. Using a trust stipend provided by her grandfather Charles Caudwell who was \\"a wealthy landowner and industrialist,\\" the teenage Ross returned to England and enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After diligently applying herself in her first year, she garnered a coveted acting prize \\"which entitled her to take the lead role in a play of her choice.\\" When Ross selected the difficult role of Phaedra, however, she was informed that her youth precluded such a tragic role as she lacked the requisite life experience. Hurt by this refusal, the teenage Ross left the academy after one year to pursue a film career. In 1930, at nineteen years of age, Ross and fellow Egyptian-born actress Marika R√∂kk obtained her cinematic roles portraying a harem houri in director Monty Banks' Why Sailors Leave Home, an early sound comedy filmed in London. Ross' dark complexion and partial fluency in Arabic were deemed suitable for the role. Disappointed by their small roles, Ross and R√∂kk heard hopeful rumours that there were ample job opportunities for aspiring actors in the Weimar Republic of Germany, and the adventurous duo set-off with great expectations for Central Europe.  Weimar Berlin  Ross' excursion to Central Europe proved less successful than she had hoped. Ross was unable to find acting opportunities and, by early 1931, she instead worked as a nightclub singer in Weimar Germany, presumably in lesbian bars. When not singing or modelling, Ross often haunted the offices of the UFA GmbH, the German motion picture production company, in the hopes of landing small film roles as an actress. By Autumn 1931, she obtained a theatrical job as a dancer in theatre director Max Reinhardt's Tales of Hoffmann, the latter Offenbach's '. She also performed in Reinhardt's production of Peer Gynt as Anitra. Reinhardt's much-anticipated production of Tales of Hoffmann premiered on November 28, 1931. In the production, reputedly one of the last great triumphs of the Berlin theatre scene prior to the Nazi Party's gradual ascent, Ross and a male dancer appeared together as an amorous couple in the stage background and were visible only in silhouette during the Venetian palace sequence of the second act. Later, Ross boasted that she and the male performer had capitalised on this opportunity for sexual intimacy in full view of the unsuspecting audience.: Ross \\"claimed that she and her fellow extra used to fuck every single night on stage during the party at Giulietta's Venetian palace in the second act of Hoffmans Erz√§hlungen.\\" = Meeting Isherwood = By Winter 1931, Ross had moved to Sch√∂neberg, Berlin, where she shared modest lodgings in Fr√§ulein Meta Thurau's flat at Nollendorfstra√üe 17 with English novelist Christopher Isherwood, whom she had met in October 1930 or in early 1931.: \\"Jean moved into a room in the Nollendorfstrasse flat after she met Christopher, early in 1931.\\" An aspiring novelist, Isherwood was politically ambivalent about the rise of fascism and specifically moved to Berlin for the gay nightlife. At their first meeting, Ross \\"dominated the conversation, describing men with whom she had slept\\" and, at one point, she \\"delved into her handbag and brought out a diaphragm\\" which she waved in the face of a startled Isherwood. The two soon became intimate friends.: \\"In real life, Jean and Christopher had a relationship which was [asexual but more truly intimate than the relationships between Sally and her various partners in the novel, the plays and the films.\\" Although Ross' relations with Isherwood were not always amicable, she soon joined Isherwood's social circle alongside more politically-aware poets W.H. Auden and Stephen Spender.. In his autobiography World Within World, Stephen Spender described Ross as she appeared in 1931: \\"Her clothes dishevelled, her eyes large onyxes fringed by eyelashes like enamelled wire, in a face of carved ivory.\\" Subsequently, \\"as the sole woman in a group of gay male friends, Ross came to be mythologised by this group in its various memoirs.\\" Among Isherwood's acquaintances, Ross was regarded as sexual libertine devoid of inhibitions who had no qualms about entertaining visitors to their flat while bathing,: \\"I always remember my first meeting with Jean Ross...When I called with my usual punctuality exactly at twelve o'clock, I was told that Miss Ross was in her bath. However a gay voice rang out down the passes ‚Äî 'Is that you, Gerald? Come and talk to me, darling, while I'm having my bath'...I felt rather startled at this warm invitation to sit down in the bathroom while a lady I had only met the night before was performing her ablutions. However, I went into the bathroom...\\" or about discussing her sexual relations. A contemporary portrait of Ross at 20 years of age appears in Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin when the narrator first encounters the \\"divinely decadent\\" Sally Bowles: : A parade of Brownshirts in Weimar Berlin in 1932. By the time Ross and Isherwood departed that same year, such parades were a regular occurrence. Isherwood further described the youthful Ross as physically resembling Merle Oberon but that her face naturally possessed a sardonic humour akin to com√©dienne Beatrice Lillie. Their ramshackle flat at Nollendorfstra√üe 17 was in \\"a working-class district\\" near the epicentre of Weimar Berlin's radical enclaves, subversive activity, and gay nightlife. By day, Ross was a fashion model for popular magazines. By night, she was a bohemian chanteuse singing in the nearby cabarets located along the Kurf√ºrstendamm avenue, an \\"entertainment-vice district\\" which was singled out for future destruction by Joseph Goebbels in his 1928 journal.: \\"Jean Ross, whom [Isherwood] had met in Berlin as one of his fellow-lodgers in the Nollendorfstrasse for a time, when she was earning her living as a (not very remarkable) singer in a second-rate cabaret.\\" These cabarets would be shuttered by the Brownshirts when the Nazi Party seized power in early 1933. Isherwood visited these nightclubs to hear Ross' sing. He later described her voice as poor but nonetheless startlingly effective: : Due to her acquaintanceship with Isherwood, Ross would later become immortalised: \\"Jean Ross...She had not yet been immortalized as Sally Bowles...\\" as \\"a bittersweet English hoyden\\" named Sally Bowles in Isherwood's 1937 eponymous novella and his 1939 book Goodbye to Berlin. While in Isherwood's company, she was introduced to American writer Paul Bowles when he visited Berlin. Bowles was a gay American writer who would later garner acclaim for his post-colonial novel The Sheltering Sky. This meeting between Ross and Paul Bowles ostensibly made a considerable impression upon Isherwood as he later used Paul Bowles' surname as the pseudonym for the character of Sally Bowles based upon Ross.: \\"Isherwood himself admitted that he named the character of [Sally Bowles] for Paul Bowles, whose 'looks' he liked.\\" Isherwood claimed that Ross was \\"more essentially British than Sally [Bowles]; she grumbled like a true Englishwoman, with her 'grin-and-bear-it' grin. And she was tougher.\\" = Abortion incident = Actor Peter van Eyck in Five Graves to Cairo (1943). The 1931 relationship between van Eyck and Ross‚Äîand Ross' subsequent abortion‚Äîbecame the basis of Isherwood's story \\"Sally Bowles\\". Although Isherwood sometimes did have sex with women, Ross‚Äîunlike the fictional character of Sally‚Äînever tried to seduce Isherwood,: \\"Jean never tried to seduce him [Isherwood]. But I remember a rainy, depressing afternoon when she remarked, 'What a pity we can't make love, there's nothing else to do,' and he agreed that it was and there wasn't.\\" although they were forced to share a bed together when their flat became overcrowded with visiting revelers.: \\"On at least one occasion, because of some financial or housing emergency, they [Isherwood and Ross] shared a bed without the least embarrassment. Jean knew Otto and Christopher's other sex mates but showed no desire to share them, although he wouldn't have really minded.\\" Instead Isherwood settled into a same-sex relationship with a working-class German young man named Heinz Neddermeyer, while Ross entered into a variety of heterosexual liaisons including one with a tall blond musician G√∂tz von Eick, later known as actor Peter van Eyck and future star of Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear. Although identified by some biographers as Jewish, van Eyck was purportedly the wealthy scion of \\"land-owning aristocratic family in the Prussian region of Pomerania.\\" As a privileged Pomeranian aristocrat, he had \\"originally expected to a pursue a military career,\\" however, he became interested in jazz as a young man and pursued musical studies in Berlin. When the 19-year-old van Eyck met Ross, he often moonlighted as a jazz pianist in Berlin cabarets. Either during their brief relationship or soon after their separation, Ross realized she was pregnant. As a personal favour to Ross, Isherwood falsely claimed in medical documents to be her heterosexual impregnator in order for Ross to obtain an abortion procedure. Ross nearly died as a result of the abortion procedure after the doctor forgot a swab inside her. These events inspired Isherwood to write his story \\"Sally Bowles\\" and serves as its narrative climax.: \\"The abortion is a turning point in the narrator's relationship with Sally and also in his relationship to Berlin and to his writing.\\" = Rise of the Nazis and Departure = By 1932, the Weimar Berlin that Ross, Isherwood, and other British expatriates witnessed was \\"in the grip of the Depression, with masses of people unemployed.\\" Berlin's daily scenes featured \\"poverty, unemployment, political demonstrations and street fighting between the forces of the extreme left and the extreme right.\\" As the political situation rapidly deteriorated in Berlin, Ross, Isherwood, Spender, and others realised that they must leave Germany. \\"There was a sensation of doom to be felt in the Berlin streets,\\" Spender recalled. In the July 1932 elections, the Nazis achieved a majority in the Reichstag and, by August that same year, Ross had departed Germany for good and returned to southern England. Within a year, Adolf Hitler's ascendance as German Chancellor and the increasing prevalence of xenophobic Nazism in the country would preclude both Ross and Isherwood from returning to their beloved Berlin. Many of the Berlin cabaret denizens befriended by Ross and Isherwood would later flee abroad or die in labour camps.: \\"Erwin [Hansen] returned to Germany several years later. Someone told me that he was arrested by the Nazis and died in a concentration camp.\\": \\"It was probably during the Berlin trip that Isherwood learned that the Nazis eventually caught up with his other companion on his 1933 journey to Greece, Erwin Hansen, who had died in a concentration camp.\\": \\"Heinz [Neddermeyer] might easily have been sentenced to an indefinite term in a concentration camp, as many homosexuals were...Like the Jews, homosexuals were often put into 'liquidation' units, in which they were given less food and more work than other prisoners. Thus, thousands of them died.\\": There were \\"people in danger of their lives, travelling with false papers and in fear of being caught and sent to a concentration camp or simply killed outright. It is only in the past few weeks that I have fully grasped the fact that such a situation really exists‚Äînot in a newspaper or a novel‚Äîbut here where I have been living.\\"  Activities in London  = Joining the Communist Party = Now in southern England, Ross resided at Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, London, and continued to fraternise with Isherwood and his circle of artistic friends, however, she began to increasingly associate with left-wing political activists \\"who were humorous but dedicated, sexually permissive but politically dogmatic.\\": \\"Jean was now beginning to shed her Sally Bowles persona. Her way of expressing herself already showed the influence of her new London friends‚Äîleft-wingers who were humorous but dedicated, sexually permissive but politically dogmatic.\\" During this time period, she was introduced to Claud Cockburn, an Anglo-Scots journalist and the second cousin, once removed, of novelists Alec Waugh and Evelyn Waugh. They met at the Caf√© Royal. Purportedly, Cockburn handed Ross a cheque one evening but‚Äîperhaps having second thoughts‚Äîhe telephoned the next morning to warn her that the cheque would bounce. Despite this \\"portent of unreliability\\" and \\"the fact that Cockburn had already been married to an American woman whom he left when she became pregnant,\\" Ross began an affair with Cockburn. In a subsequent evening, Cockburn expounded upon Marxist economic theory to Ross all night until the early morning hours. Cockburn later claimed that he convinced Ross to become a left-wing journalist and secured her employment at The Daily Worker. Due to Cockburn's influence, Ross formally joined the Communist Party of Great Britain during the tenure of General Secretary Harry Pollitt. She would be an active and devoted Party member for the remainder of her life. Meanwhile, she continued her career as an aspiring thespian. She appeared in theatrical productions at the Gate Theatre Studio directed by Peter Godfrey and, in need of money, she modelled the latest Paris fashions by French designer Jean Patou in Tatler magazine. It is also possible, although unlikely, that she obtained a bit role as a chorus girl in Paramount Studios' musical drama film Rumba. = Isherwood and Viertel = While in England, Ross' connections to the British film industry proved crucial to Isherwood's future career. Ross had only spent eighteen months or so in Berlin between 1932 and 1933, but \\"during this time she became fluent enough in German so that, upon her return to England, she was able to work as a bilingual scenarist in the British film industry with Austro-German directors who had fled the Third Reich.\\" One of these Austrian directors was Berthold Viertel who became Ross' friend.: \\"One morning in the middle of October..Christopher got a telephone call from Jean Ross...'Chris darling, I've just met this absolutely marvelous man [Berthold Viertel]. He's simply brilliant. I adore him...No, you swine‚Äîwe most certainly do not! He's old‚Äîat least sixty, I should think. I mean, I adore his mind...You see, he's an Austrian, only he's a director in Hollywood. He's come here to direct a film...And, darling, this is what's so marvelous‚Äîhe wants you to write it!\\" At the time, translators were sorely needed in the film industry to facilitate productions headed by such Austro-German directors who were now subsisting in the United Kingdom. Aware that Isherwood was living in poverty at the time, Ross induced her friend Viertel to hire Isherwood as a translator.: \\"Berthold Viertel...This Viennese dramatist, stage and screen director met Isherwood in 1933 through Jean Ross, who knew that Viertel needed a screenwriter for his film Little Friend.\\" As repayment for this favour, Ross asked Isherwood to promise to give half of his first week's salary from the job to her. However, after obtaining the job, Isherwood either reneged upon or forgot this agreement with Ross,: \\"I can't remember if Christopher kept his promise to give [Jean] her half of his first week's salary.\\" and this incident may have contributed to the later souring of their friendship. Viertel and Isherwood soon collaborated upon a film which would become Little Friend (1934), and this collaboration subsequently launched Isherwood's long, successful career as a screenwriter in Hollywood. During this period in 1933, Isherwood composed the nucleus of a short story about Ross' abortion in Berlin that would later become his 1937 novella \\"Sally Bowles\\". Dissatisfied with its structure and quality, Isherwood rewrote the manuscript during the subsequent years. He eventually sent the manuscript to editor John Lehmann to be published in New Writing, a new literary periodical. However‚Äîwhen Isherwood informed Lehmann that his story was based on factual events‚Äîthe editor became worried about the story's climax since it drew upon Ross' abortion. Lehmann believed that Ross would file a successful libel suit against both Isherwood and himself if the story were published.: \\"Isherwood's publisher was nervous about the abortion episode and encouraged him to drop it.\\" Anxious to avoid a libel suit, Isherwood implored Ross to give him permission to publish the story. Ross' reluctance delayed the publication of the manuscript. As abortion was a controversial topic in 1930s England and still carried the penalty of life imprisonment, Ross feared Isherwood's thinly-disguised story recounting her lifestyle and abortion in Berlin would further strain her tempestuous relationship with her status- conscious family. In order to prevail upon Ross to give consent for the novella's publication, Isherwood claimed he was in the most dire financial circumstances. As Ross herself was often impoverished, she sympathised with any friend in similar impecunious straits. Accordingly, as a personal favour to Isherwood, she yielded her objections to the publication of \\"Sally Bowles\\". The novella was then published by Hogarth Press. Following the tremendous success of the novella \\"Sally Bowles\\", Ross regretted this decision and believed it permanently harmed her reputation. Now deeply committed to the socialist cause, Ross noticed that Isherwood's story undermined her standing \\"among those comrades who realised she was the model for Sally Bowles.\\" = Workers' League and Embezzlement = Circa 1934‚Äì1935, while in England, Ross wrote the fiery manifesto for the short-lived British Workers' Film and Photo League and also served as its General Secretary. Much like its communist- backed U.S. counterpart, the British Workers Film and Photo League's main objective was to launch a cultural counter-offensive to the \\"bourgeois\\" and \\"nauseating\\" films produced by capitalist societies such as the United States and the United Kingdom. The organisation sought to bring anti-capitalist \\"revolutionary films to workers organisations throughout the country.\\" Despite its limited personnel and modest funds, the League produced newsreels, taught seminars on working-class film criticism, organised protests against \\"reactionary pictures,\\" and screened the latest blockbusters of Soviet Russia to cadres of like-minded cineastes. They frequently screened such motion pictures as Storm over Asia (1928), Ten Days That Shook the World (1928), Road to Life (1931), and China Express (1929). During Ross' tenure as General Secretary, the League was closely tied to the Friends of the Soviet Union and often sublet its office space to the latter collective. Upon her resignation as the League's Secretary, Ross continued to serve as a League member and helped produce the short film Defence of Britain in March 1936. Drawing upon her family's resources, Ross also personally donated a considerable sum to the fledgling organisation in February 1936. However, another League member named Ivan Seruya embezzled the majority of Ross' donation in order to finance his own private venture International Sound Films. This incident and the subsequent dearth of organisational funds reportedly contributed to the League's lack of progress as well as its eventual demise in 1938. = Film Criticism for The Daily Worker = Ross' film criticism focused primarily on early Soviet cinema. Her reviews for those films, such as Jazz Comedy (pictured above), have been praised decades after her death. Circa 1935‚Äì6, Ross was the film critic for The Daily Worker. She wrote her reviews using the alias Peter Porcupine, which she presumably adopted as a homage to radical English pamphleteer William Cobbett who had famously used the same pseudonym. Ross interest in film criticism purportedly begun earlier in Berlin when she often attended the cinema together with Isherwood, Auden, and Spender. According to Spender, their quartet of friends collectively viewed upon release such notable films as Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and Josef von Sternberg's The Blue Angel. They were particularly fond of \\"heroic proletarian films\\" such as G.W. Pabst's Comradeship, as well as \\"Russian films in which photography created poetic images of labour and industry\\" exemplified in Ten Days That Shook the World and The Battleship Potemkin. Pursuing this interest after her return to England, Ross became the film critic of The Daily Worker in a tumultuous era which fellow critic Dwight Macdonald described as spanning the Golden Age and Iron Age of Soviet cinema: : In her film criticism, Ross insisted that \\"the workers in the Soviet Union [had] introduced to the world\\" new variations of this art form with \\"the electrifying strength and vitality and freedom of a victorious working class.\\" Her reviews of early Soviet cinema were later described by scholars as \\"ingenious piece[s] of dialectical sophistry.\\" = Eve of the Spanish Civil War = John Cornford in 1936, eleven months prior to his death. In mid-September 1936, while the Spanish Civil War was in its first year, Ross purportedly met English poet and communist John Cornford at the Horseshoes pub in England while in the company of his friend John Sommerfield.: \\"[Sommerfield] went off to fight for the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, serving in a machine-gun unit and losing his friend and fellow writer John Cornford to the conflict. On his return to England, Sommerfield found that he had been reported dead, his obituary appearing in two newspapers. Volunteer In Spain appeared in 1937 and was dedicated to Cornford.\\": \\"I had been with [John Cornford] when they [Ross and Cornford] first met, very soon after he'd come back from Spain.\\" As \\"the first Englishman to enlist against Franco,\\" Cornford had just returned from the Aragon front where he had served with the P.O.U.M. militia near Saragossa and fought in the early battles near Perdiguera and Huesca. Cornford had then returned to England from Barcelona in order to recruit volunteers to combat the fascists in Spain. Following the initial meeting between Ross and Cornford, a near brawl occurred at the pub when an ex-fascist volunteer who had been in the Irish Brigade was present and almost came to blows with Cornford over the subject of the war. After leaving the pub, Cornford and Ross went for dinner to Bertorelli's on Charlotte Street in Fitzrovia, central London, where Ross impressed Cornford with her knowledge of ongoing political matters in Spain, as well as between England and Germany. By the end of the evening, Cornford and Ross may have become a couple.: \\"Jean was, for all practical purposes, alone with John, talking to him in a low, amorous murmur about some new scandalous bit of Foreign Office subservience to Hitler, while, at the same time, gently stroking his thighs. When we left the restaurant she...linked arms with John and walked off with him.\\": \\"Most of John [Cornford]'s girls had been unsuitable; and Jean [Ross] had been extra unsuitable.\\" Cornford possibly moved into Ross' apartment in the ensuing weeks while he recruited volunteers to return en masse with him to Spain.: \\"After John had walked down Charlotte Street with Jean, he disappeared for several weeks. Then I had a letter, saying he'd moved in with Jean, and would I come round for a meal. 'She's a good cook, too,' he wrote. I liked that 'too'. While living with Ross, Cornford published his first book of poems and worked on a Lysistrata translation.. Visiting them, Sommerfield wrote that he was struck by the love that Ross possessed for Cornford: \\"She seemed positively besotted, watching him all the time, eating him up with her eyes.\\" However, if such a relationship occurred, this brief union was not to last due to their mutual commitment to fighting Franco in Spain.  War Correspondent  = Arrival in Republican Spain = In September 1936, Ross travelled to war-torn Spain either in the company of Claud Cockburn or separately. At this point, Cornford had returned to Spain with 21 British volunteers to fight the fascists and had become \\"the acknowledged leader among the British contingent in the International Brigades.\\" He served with a mitrailleuse unit and fought in the Battle of Madrid in November and December 1936. During the subsequent battle for University City of Madrid, he was wounded by a stray anti-aircraft shell. Despite his injuries, he then served with the English-speaking volunteers of the Marseillaise Brigade and was killed in action at Lopera, near C√≥rdoba, Spain on 27 or 28 December. Upon hearing of Cornford's death, Ross may have been emotionally devastated and may have attempted to kill herself with an overdose of sleeping pills. Decades later, she would confide to her acquaintance John Sommerfield during a personal conversation that Cornford \\"was the only man [she] ever loved.\\" The death of Cornford and other friends in the service of the doomed Republican cause likely solidified Ross' anti-fascist sentiments, and she remained in Republican Spain throughout the prolonged conflict as a war correspondent for The Daily Express. = Journalist and Propagandist = Throughout the Spanish Civil War, Ross worked for the London branch office of the Espagne News-Agency, also known as the Spanish News Agency. During Ross' tenure in the organisation, the Espagne News-Agency was accused by journalist George Orwell of being a Stalinist apparatus which disseminated false propaganda in order to undermine anti- Stalinist factions on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War. In particular, during the Barcelona May Days, when anarchist factions on the Republican side were annihilated by Stalinist-backed troops, the Espagne News- Agency and The Daily Worker published false claims in that the anarchists had been planning a coup and were secretly allied with the fascists and thus justified their extermination. All of the agency's staff‚Äîincluding Ross‚Äîwere \\"trusted junior functionaries of the Comintern apparatus,\\" the international Communist organization determined to create a worldwide Soviet republic. Ross' fellow Comintern propagandists included Hungarian-British journalist Arthur Koestler, Willy Forrest, Mildred Bennett of the Moscow Daily News, and Claud Cockburn. Ross and Cockburn became closer as the civil war progressed in Spain. By this time, Cockburn was \\"a leading British Communist Party member\\" and, within a span of five years, he would rise to be a leader of the Comintern in Western Europe. While covering the Spanish Civil War for The Daily Worker in 1936, Cockburn had joined the elite Fifth Regiment of the left-wing Republicanos battling the right-wing Nacionales and, when not fighting, he gave sympathetic coverage to Communist Party. Ross spent much of her time as a journalist reporting from besieged Madrid under constant bombardment by Franco's forces. Many of Madrid's inhabitants sought shelter in the subway in order to escape the bombs. While Cockburn fought with the Fifth Regiment, Ross served as a war correspondent for The Daily Express. When Cockburn was at the frontlines, Ross ghost-wrote his columns for him, \\"imitating his style and filing it at The Daily Worker under his name, while at the same time continuing to send her own reports to the Express.\\" During this time, Ross was embedded with Republican defenders in the Spanish capital city of Madrid. Among the other foreign correspondents alongside Ross in besieged Madrid were journalist Herbert Matthews of The New York Times, Ernest Hemingway of the North American Newspaper Alliance, Henry Tilton Gorrell of the United Press International, and Martha Gellhorn of Collier's, as well as Josephine Herbst. Ross and other foreign correspondents often dined together for lunch and dinner in the ruined basement of the Gran Via, \\"the only restaurant open in the whole of Madrid\\" during the relentless bombardment by fascist troops. The basement restaurant was heavily guarded by armed Loyalist sentries, and no one was permitted entry without a press pass. = Reporting on the Southern Front = In Spring 1937, as the civil war progressed, Ross, her friend Richard Mowrer of The Chicago Daily News‚Äîthe step-son of Ernest Hemingway's first wife Hadley Richardson‚Äîand their guide Constancia de la Mora travelled to Andalusia to report on the southern front.: \\"Mowrer and I and Jean Ross, a clever and charming Englishwoman working at that time for the Government news agency in Paris and London, started off in an automobile for the southern front.\\" Ross and Mowrer investigated and reported upon war-time conditions in Alicante, M√°laga, and Ja√©n. The latter town had been bombed a week before her arrival by a squadron of German Junkers 52. Amid the rubble, Ross reported on the bombing's death toll and interviewed the mothers whose children had perished in the bombardment as well as other survivors. She then proceeded to And√∫jar where‚Äîamid the ongoing battle and machine-gun fire‚Äîshe interviewed Colonel Jos√© Morales, a commander of the southern armies. Following her interview with Morales, the convoy in which Ross was travelling faced recurrent enemy fire and later, during the evening outside a monastery, were bombed by a fascist air patrol. De la Mora vividly recalled this bombing as one of the daily perils which Ross and other pro-Republican journalists endured to report news from the front lines: : During her time in And√∫jar, Ross would endure nine aerial bombardments by German Junkers and survived each despite the lack of air raid shelters. Recalling these events, Mora described Ross as a fearless reporter who had seemingly resigned herself to death and looked \\"as natural as possible\\" when the bombs fell. Her friends noted that \\"she had a comforting air of calmness about her.\\" Following her reporting in And√∫jar, Ross continued to report from the battle-lines of the C√≥rdoba and Extremadura fronts. She would report on the progress of the war, often from the front lines of the Republican forces, for the next year. = Fall of Madrid and Return to England = In Winter 1938, while pregnant with Cockburn's child, Ross witnessed the final months of the Siege of Madrid and endured aerial bombardment by Francoist attackers. By the time the besieged city fell to the Nationalist armies on 28 March 1939, a pregnant Ross had already returned to England. Her wartime experiences‚Äîespecially the atrocities she witnessed and the friends she lost in combat‚Äîsolidified her lifelong commitment to anti-fascist resistance. Sixty days after Madrid fell to the Nationalist forces, Ross gave birth to a daughter by Claud Cockburn. The child Sarah Caudwell‚Äîborn 27 May 1939‚Äîwas the only offspring of their union. Although some sources allege that Ross did not marry Cockburn due to her political beliefs regarding women's emancipation, in actuality Cockburn still was married under British law to his first wife Hope Hale Davis and he could not marry Ross at that time without committing bigamy. Whether or not Ross knew that Cockburn was still legally married to Davis is unknown. However, several months before the birth of their child, Ross had filed a deed poll in which she changed her surname to Cockburn. The same year that Ross became pregnant with Cockburn's child and that their daughter was born, Cockburn entered into a clandestine relationship with Patricia Arbuthnot. In August 1939, three months after the birth of their daughter, Cockburn \\"walked out\\" on Ross and their newly-born child to cohabitate with Arbuthnot. Cockburn would later omit all mention of Ross from his memoirs.. Isherwood writes in his diary, \\"I admire the first part of Claud Cockburn's autobiography very much. But...I can't find the faintest allusion to Jean Ross.\\" Following her abandonment by Cockburn, Ross did not have another recorded partner. She later opined to an acquaintance that \\"having a man around was like having a crocodile in the bath.\\"  Later life and death  = World War II and Post- War Years = Ross circa the 1940s. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, Ross, her daughter Sarah, and her widowed mother Clara Caudwell moved to Hertfordshire. Ross became friends with Isherwood's old acquaintance Edward Upward and his wife Hilda Percival whom were both socialists in outlook. Upward later met Olive Mangeot through their attendance of Communist Party meetings, and the two began an extramarital affair. Olive‚Äîwhom Isherwood depicted as Marvey Scriven in The Memorial and as Madame Cheuret in Lions and Shadows‚Äîeventually separated from her husband Andre Mangeot and lived in Gunter Grove where she invited Jean Ross and her daughter Sarah to live with her. For many years, Ross and her daughter Sarah lived as Olive's boarders in modest circumstances in Gunter Grove. Much like Ross, Mangeot once had been an apolitical bohemian in her youth and transformed with age into a devout Stalinist who sold The Daily Worker and was an active member of various left- wing circles. According to Isherwood, Mangeot, Ross, and their social circle staunchly refused to consort with Trotskyites or other communist schismatics who had strayed from the Stalinist party line. = Parenthood and Socialist Activities = For the remainder of her adult life, Ross devoted herself to two causes: Advancing the ideology of socialism and raising her only daughter Sarah. In order to obtain the \\"best education\\" available for Sarah, Ross relocated with her child to Scotland. In 1960, they returned to Barnes, London for Sarah to attend Oxford University. They lived with Jean's sister, Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Ross, a sculptor and painter trained at the Liverpool School of Art. At this point, Ross acted as a caretaker for both her invalid sister Peggy, who had severe arthritis affecting her mobility, and her ailing mother Clara who had a debilitating stroke. Under Ross' tutelage, her daughter Sarah became one of the first women to join the Oxford Union as a student and to speak in the Oxford Union's Debating Chamber. She later taught law at Oxford, became a senior executive at Lloyds Bank and later became a celebrated author of detective novels. While Sarah was at Oxford, Ross continued to engage in political activities ranging from protesting nuclear weapons to boycotting apartheid South Africa to opposing the Vietnam War. Even at an advanced age, she continued to make daily rounds to neighbouring houses to sell copies of The Daily Worker and participated in raising awareness regarding ongoing political campaigns. Acquaintances who met Ross during the later decades of her life noted that various hardships and impoverished economic circumstances had taken its toll on her. \\"She seemed burned out,\\" Sommerfield recalled, \\"with bruise marks under her eyes and lines of discontent round her mouth; her once beautiful black hair looked dead, and she wore too much make-up, carelessly applied. Only her voice was the same, a rapid, confiding drawl full of italics. She was still using the slang and political cliches of her youth, and trying to shock with a freedom of speech that now was taken for granted.\\" By this time, she had few clothes and very little money. Ross and writer Isherwood met a final time shortly before her death. In a diary entry for 24 April 1970, Isherwood recounted their final reunion in London in a diary entry: : Three years later, on 27 April 1973, Ross died at her home in Richmond on Thames, Surrey, aged 61, from cervical cancer. She was cremated at East Sheen.  Dislike of \\"Sally Bowles\\" and Cabaret  Liza Minnelli as Sally Bowles in the 1972 film Cabaret. Ross disliked how the stylish, beret-wearing character of Sally Bowles was transmogrified into a \\"vulgar vamp.\\": \\"Jean Ross was a gentle, cultivated and very beautiful woman, not a bit like the vulgar vamp displayed by Lisa Minelli.\\" According to Ross' daughter Sarah Caudwell, her mother detested her popular identification with the vacuous character of Sally Bowles. She believed the political indifference of the character more closely resembled Isherwood or his hedonistic friends, many of whom \\"fluttered around town exclaiming how sexy the storm troopers looked in their uniforms.\\" Ross' opinion of Isherwood's own beliefs is partly confirmed by Isherwood biographer Peter Parker who wrote that Isherwood was \\"the least political\\" of W. H. Auden's social circle in Weimar Berlin, and Auden himself noted the young Isherwood \\"held no [political] opinions whatever about anything.\\" According to her daughter, Ross further disliked the character of Sally Bowles as the character offended her feminist convictions: Isherwood's fictionalised depiction of Ross employed a literary convention which necessitated \\"that a woman must be either virtuous (in the sexual sense) or a tart. So Sally, who is plainly not virtuous, must be a tart to depend for a living on providing sexual pleasure.\\" Such a submissive gender role would have \\"seemed to [Ross] the ultimate denial of freedom and emancipation.\\" Above all, however, Ross resented that Isherwood's 1937 novella 'Sally Bowles' had depicted Ross as expressing anti-Semitic bigotry.: \\"Sally's attractiveness is also diminished by two anti-Semitic remarks she makes, which are omitted in all the postwar adaptations.\\" In the 1937 story, Bowles laments bedding an \\"awful old Jew\\" in order to obtain money.: \\"This job at the Lady Windermere only lasts another week. I got it through a man I met at the Eden Bar. But he's gone off to Vienna now. I must ring up the Ufa people again, I suppose. And then there's an awful old Jew who takes me out sometimes. He's always promising to get me a contract; but he only wants to sleep with me, the old swine.\\" Ross' daughter insisted that such racial bigotry \\"would have been as alien to my mother's vocabulary as a sentence in Swahili; she had no more deeply rooted passion than a loathing of racialism and so, from the outset, of fascism.\\" Accordingly, due to her unyielding dislike of fascism, Ross was incensed that Isherwood had depicted her as thoughtlessly allied in her beliefs \\"with the [racist] attitudes which led to Dachau and Auschwitz.\\" In recent decades, some writers have argued the anti-Semitic remarks in the 1937 novella \\"Sally Bowles\\" are a reflection of Isherwood's own much-documented prejudices. In Peter Parker's biography, \\"Isherwood is revealed as being fairly anti-Semitic to a degree that required some emendations of the Berlin novels when they were republished after the war.\\" Isherwood never publicly confirmed that Ross was his model for Sally Bowles until after her death. However, other mutual acquaintances were less discreet. Ross herself indicated that her former partner, journalist Claud Cockburn, had leaked to his friends in the press that she had inspired the character. In 1951, poet Stephen Spender publicly confirmed that Bowles was based on a real person in his autobiography World Within World, and he further confirmed the abortion incident was factual. Later, Gerald Hamilton‚Äîthe inspiration for \\"Mr. Norris\\"‚Äîidentified Ross as Sally Bowles in his 1969 memoir The Way It Was With Me due to a public feud with Bowles' former partner Claud Cockburn. Consequently, when Cabaret garnered acclaim in the late 1960s, Ross was tracked down by journalists and hounded with intrusive questions, particularly by the Daily Mail. Badgered by the press, Ross refused to discuss her sexual misadventures in Weimar Berlin. Her daughter claimed the journalist's relentless interrogations \\"were invariably a disappointment on both sides: the journalists always wanted to talk about sex\\" while Ross \\"always wanted to talk about politics.\\" Ross bitterly noted that reporters always claimed to seek knowledge \\"about Berlin in the Thirties\\" and yet they did not wish \\"to know about the unemployment or the poverty or the Nazis marching through the streets‚Äîall they want to know is how many men I went to bed with.\\" Ross became particularly incensed when the reporters ascribed her many sexual affairs to her feminist beliefs: : Ross steadfastly declined invitations to watch Cabaret or any related adaptations. Her ambivalence towards the popular success of Cabaret was not unique among Isherwood's acquaintances: The poet Stephen Spender lamented how Cabaret glossed over Weimar Berlin's crushing poverty, and he later noted that there was \\"not a single meal or club in the movie Cabaret that Christopher and I could have afforded.\\" Both Spender and Ross often contended that Isherwood's stories glamourised and distorted the harsh realities of 1930s Berlin. In Ross' own words, Isherwood's \\"story was quite, quite different from what really happened.\\" However, she admitted that the depiction of their social group of British expatriates as pleasure-seeking libertines was accurate: \\"We were all utterly against the bourgeois standards of our parents' generation. That's what took us to [Weimar-era] Berlin. The climate was freer there.\\"  Portrayals and Legacy  = Isherwood canon = Sally Bowles‚Äîthe fictional character inspired by Ross‚Äîhas been portrayed by a number of actress over the decades: Julie Harris in I Am a Camera, the 1951 adaptation of Goodbye to Berlin and the 1955 film adaptation of the same name; Jill Haworth in the original 1966 Broadway production of Cabaret; Judi Dench in the original 1968 West End stage version of Cabaret; Liza Minnelli in Bob Fosse's 1972 film adaptation of the musical, and Natasha Richardson in the 1998 Broadway Revival of Cabaret. In 1979, critic Howard Moss noted the peculiar resiliency of the Sally Bowles character in The New York Times ': \\"It is almost fifty years since Sally Bowles shared the recipe for a Prairie oyster with Herr Issyvoo in a vain attempt to cure a hangover\\" and yet the character in \\"subsequent transformations\\" lives on \\"from story to play to movie to musical to movie- musical.\\" Moss ascribed the character's continuing appeal to \\"the tone of sophisticated innocence\\" which pervades Isherwood's depiction of both the character and Weimar Berlin in which \\"the unseemly and the ugly\\" are either deemphasized or made to appear genial to the spectator. According to critic Ingrid Norton, the character of Sally Bowles later inspired Truman Capote's Holly Golightly in his novella Breakfast at Tiffany's.: \\"Truman Capote's Holly Golightly...the latter of whom is a tribute to Isherwood and his Sally Bowles...\\" Norton has posited that Isherwood's Bowles was the key model for Capote's Golightly character. Norton has alleged that both scenes and dialogue in Capote's 1958 novella have direct equivalencies in Isherwood's earlier 1937 work. Capote had befriended Isherwood in New York in the late 1940s, and Capote was an admirer of Isherwood's novels. = Christopher and His Kind (2011) = Imogen Poots portrayed Ross in Christopher and His Kind (2011). In 2011, British actress Imogen Poots portrayed Jean Ross in Christopher and His Kind in which she starred opposite Matt Smith as Christopher Isherwood. For her performance, Poots attempted to show Ross' personality as \\"convincingly fragile beneath layers of attitude,\\" but Poots did not wish to depict Ross as a talented singer. Poots explained that‚Äîin her estimation‚Äîif \\"Jean had been that good, she wouldn't have been wasting her time hanging around with Isherwood in the cabarets of the Weimar Republic, she would have been on her way, perhaps, to the life she dreamed of in Hollywood.\\" = These Foolish Things = As well as inspiring the character of Sally Bowles, Ross has been credited as the inspiration for one of the 20th century's more enduring popular songs: \\"These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)\\". Although composer Eric Maschwitz's wife Hermione Gingold speculated in her autobiography that the haunting jazz standard was written for either herself or actress Anna May Wong, Maschwitz's own autobiography contradicts such claims. Maschwitz cites \\"fleeting memories of [a] young love\\" as inspiring the song, and most sources, including the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, posit cabaret singer Ross, with whom Maschwitz had a youthful romantic liaison, as the muse for the song.

It was exhibited at the Paris Salon the same year, then was bought by Adolphe Jullien. In 1915, it was given to the Mus√©e du Luxembourg, then was at the Mus√©e du Louvre until 1986. It is currently kept at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris.  Background and reception  The painting was the last of the four portraits of groups that Fantin-Latour devoted to his friends and celebrities in the arts world. He referred here to the concerts given by the group known as \\"Le Petit Bayreuth\\" initiated by Antoine Lascoux. Despite three previous paintings and numerous still lifes, the painter had not received the critical acclaim which he expected. He finally reached it through Around the Piano. The painting, however, remains the least known of series of four ones, perhaps because the people depicted are less famous. Exhibited at the Salon of 1885, the painting was called The Wagnerists by visitors, as the person seated at the piano was thought to be Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, a composer who was an early supporter of Wagner. Adolphe Jullien, a close friend of Latour, rejected this name, saying that Fantin did not want to paint an artistic manifesto, but simply a gathering of friends, and that the score on the piano, although indistinct, was a piece by Brahms.

The bout took place on April 9 at MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. Morales, a Mexican legend and a five time world champion at three different weight classes, made his mark in the Junior Welterweight division by obtaining the WBC Silver light welterweight title in September 2010 and defending it in December of the same year. Following his last bout, he expressed his desire to fight Juan Manuel Marquez, however Marquez turned this fight down and then the matchup was made with Maidana through Golden Boy Promotions. Maidana was coming from a twelve-round decision loss against then title-holder Amir Khan in December 2010, his second shot at a world title. This was his chance to start back on the road to another full title shot.  Background  = Erik Morales = Morales officially ended his retirement on March 27, 2010 by returning and defeating Jos√© Alfaro. Morales' precision and stamina overcame Alfaro; easily defeating him via unanimous decision. In his second fight after returning to the ring Erik Morales fought Willie Limond. Limond started strong in the first three rounds being very quick, elusive, and staying away from Morales' reach. Morales threw body shots to slow his opponent down and fought very conservative until Limond started getting tired. The fight was stopped as Limond could not carry on and won the WBC Silver World Light Welterweight title. He then defended his title against tough challenger Francisco Lorenzo and won by unanimous decision. = Marcos Maidana = In his first shot at a major world title, Maidana lost via points decision to the rugged Andriy Kotelnik somewhat controversially, a result that had a lot of observers questioning the judges. After that he went on to win the WBA Interim belt by stopping prospect Victor Ortiz, both of them exchanging knockdowns. He made three successful defenses before challenging reigning champion Amir Khan, 2 of which were by knockouts. In an anticipated match between two exciting junior-welterweights there was bound to be fireworks. Khan defeated Maidana by unanimous decision, and the championship fight received a lot of recognition as 2010's Fight of the Year.

Fight earnings *Erik Morales $250,000 vs. Marcos Maidana $500,000 The Fight In the first round, Maidana came out with ferocity as expected and proceeded to batter his older opponent around the ring. He landed multiple power punches, including an uppercut that opened a huge swelling over Morales' left eye which worsened over the course of the fight, and when the Mexican walked back to his corner having taken a large amount of punishment in the opening three minutes most observers felt their predictions were being fulfilled. The one-sided nature of the bout continued for the next couple of rounds, but then at the end of the third round Morales begin to fight back and landed a hard combination to the head of Maidana and the tide began to turn. From the fourth round onwards and although he was effectively fighting with one eye, Morales gave as good as he got and was landing the cleaner more effective shots, albeit occasionally being swarmed by the sheer number of punches being landed in return by the relentless Maidana. The fight became a see-saw affair and then, in the eighth round, Morales hit Maidana with a huge left hook that almost stopped the Argentinian. The next couple of rounds continued in this fashion, with Maidana using his strength and stamina to bully Morales and the Mexican using his sharper punching and ring intelligence to land effective counters and combinations. The fight was fast turning into a modern classic. In the \\"championship rounds\\" (the eleventh and twelfth), Morales seemed to tire and Maidana took advantage, overwhelming him with his strength and punishing the ageing warrior continually to the head and body. Maidana finished the fight much the stronger of the two and his late surge gave him the win on the scorecards, 116-112 twice with the third judge scoring the fight a draw, 114-114. With this victory, Maidana put himself firmly back in the title picture, being awarded the interim WBA championship and putting himself back up with the division's elite in Khan and Timothy Bradley. The true glory on the night however went to Morales, who turned back the clock with an outstanding performance against the odds and against a host of seeming disadvantages, and possibly winning the fight in the eyes of some observers. Morales asked for a rematch in the near future and Maidana also seemed keen in the post-fight interviews, possibly for July 30 if the matchup can be arranged. No-one will be complaining if the rematch were to take place and it was anywhere near as good as their first meeting.

Noted for her enthusiastic and great knowledge of the game, she excelled defensively at shortstop, second base and all three outfield positions. Basically a line-drive hitter, she had a compact swing and tremendous plate discipline, collecting a significant .336 on-base percentage and a 2.05 walk-to-strikeout ratio (113-to-55) in a span of three years.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Players Roster All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W.

League play officially began on May 30, 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. Each team was made up of fifteen girls. Davis joined the Rockford team to become one of the sixty original founding members of the league. Her hitting was good enough to win the batting title win a .331 average in 102 games. She also led the league in total bases (155), finished second in hits (116), four behind South Bend's Betsy Jochum, and ranked third in home runs (4), runs batted in (58) and runs scored (78), while tying for second in triples (10). During the midseason took effect the first All-Star Game of the league, which coincidentally became the first night game ever played at Wrigley Field (July 1, 1943). The contest was played under temporary lights between two teams composed of Belles and Comets players against Blue Sox and Peaches players. At the end of the season, she was selected to the All-Star Team.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record BookESPN Page 2 ‚Äì Reel Life: A League of Their Own - Article by Jeff Merron By 1944 the AAGPBL added two teams, the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes.

The documentary explores the journey of the South Asian rock music band Junoon and the struggle they face to become one of the biggest band in the world.  Synopsis  The documentary follows the journey of the South Asian rock music band Junoon and the struggle they face to become one of the biggest band in the world. Salman Ahmad, lead guitarist, parted ways the most successful pop band of Pakistan, Vital Signs as he wanted a change in the band's music for their second album and therefore after leaving the band he went on to form his own band. First, he recruited singer Ali Azmat from the Jupiters and then the former Vital Signs lead guitarist, Nusrat Hussain, on keyboards. The name of band comes from when Salman Ahmad had a dream where one of his teachers shook him and said \\"Tumhey mousiqui ka Junoon hai!\\" (You have an obsession for music!). The band then released their self-titled debut album Junoon barely made a dent in the Pakistani music industry when released in 1991. After the release of their debut album, Nusrat Hussain parted ways with the band to pursue his own professional career. After the departure of Nusrat Hussain, Salman Ahmad contacted Brian O'Connell and invited him to play bass on the band's second album. In 1993, Junoon released their second album Talaash which began to create a cult of a following for the band. Singles from the album, such as \\"Talaash\\", were politically influenced and became subject to censorship, which led to the eventual ban from all state run television and radio during the rule of by then the Pakistani Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. After a gap of four years the band released their third album Inquilaab by which Junoon started to gain success and began to reach a wider audience when one of their singles, \\"Jazba-e-Junoon\\". in 1997, Junoon released their fourth studio album, Azadi, which was the band's first international record deal which led the band win many international music awards and they were now recognized internationally. After two year, Junoon then released their fifth studio album, Parvaaz, which was recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and was hailed by many critics as the finest work by Junoon. The band then released their sixth studio album in 2001, Andaz and then releasing their seventh studio album, Dewaar in 2007. After the release of the album Brian O'Connell went back to United States. Salman Ahmad and Ali Azmat both went on to pursue a career as a solo singer.

It was at the center of a sensational New York City indecency trial involving the play's star and producer/director, Olga Nethersole. The play was not an exceptional success but the incident is considered a notable step in the transformation of American society's attitudes regarding gender roles and public depictions of sex in the 20th century. The play Listing of original Sapho cast, circa 1900 The English actress Olga Nethersole asked prominent American playwright Clyde Fitch to adapt Sapho, telling the story from the point of view of the lead female character rather than the male character as was done with the original novel and play.

Founded on the novel by Alphonse Daudet, with scenes from the play by Alphonse Daudet and Adolphe Belot. Sapho is a so-called \\"problem play\\", centering on a woman who has love affairs with men to whom she is not married. Nethersole had already added two such dramas, Camille and The Second Mrs. Tanqueray, to her ongoing repertoire.At the time, terms such as \\"courtesan\\", \\"fallen woman\\", \\"harlot\\", \\"prostitute\\", or \\"tainted woman\\" described sexually attractive, unmarried women characters in plays, regardless of whether they were prostitutes in the vocational sense. Other examples: George Bernard Shaw's Mrs. Warren's Profession (1893) and David Belasco's Zaza (1899). Johnson, Sisters in Sin, p. 21. Sapho's lead character, Fanny LeGrand, seduces a na√Øve man named Jean Gaussin. In the scene that caused the most furor, the two characters ascend a spiral staircase together, presumably toward a bedroom though that is never shown or stated. In the end, LeGrand leaves Gaussin to reform and marry the father of her child. The play has 23 characters, plus \\"Danseuses\\" (dancers). *Jean Gaussin *Uncle Cesaire *Hettema *Caoudal *M.

Sapho opened in New York at the old (1882-1904) Wallack's Theatre on Broadway and 30th StreetBrown, A History of the New York Stage, p. 310. on February 5, 1900. Reviews were negative and the press predicted it would flop.\\"A coarse and superfluous play, and not well acted, either...'Sapho' will draw crowds for a week or so, but it is not long for this market.\\" From play review: \\"Dramatic And Musical: Miss Nethersole At Last Acts Fanny LeGrand At Wallack's,\\" New York Times, Feb. 6, 1900, p. 6. The show's notoriety kept it going however, and it ran in New York for a total of 83 performances in 1900. From 1901 through 1913 Nethersole took it on tour to cities throughout America, as well as London and Australia. She brought the play back to New York in 1905, 1908, 1910 and 1913, in the later years sometimes just playing the third act. The play remained controversial, with municipal authorities in some cities continuing to ban performances entirely or insisting on changes in dialogue or costume.For example, Springfield, Massachusetts: \\"Springfield Won't Stand Sapho,\\" New York Times, Jan. 5, 1906, p. 5. Actors playing Jean Gaussin in the Nethersole productions included Hamilton Revelle (February through May 1900), G. Harrison Hunter (November 1900, and 1910), Slaine Mills (1905),\\"Olga Nethersole in 'Sapho'\\", New York Times, Apr. 19, 1910, p. 9. and Winnington Barnes (1913).\\"Nethersole in 'Sapho',\\" New York Times, Oct. 7, 1913, p. 13. The original Broadway choreographer was Carl Marwig and settings were by Ernest Albert. Indecency trial Representatives of groups such as the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, the Society for the Study of Life, and the New York Mother's Club, protested that the play's language and costumes were immoral. Some of the outcry was fuelled by yellow journalism, with trial witnesses admitting their tickets had been provided by New York World reporters.\\"Hearing in 'Sapho' Case,\\" New York Times, Feb. 28, 1900, p. 4. New York District Attorney Asa Bird Gardiner ordered Nethersole, her co- star, and two managers arrested on February 21,\\"Sapho Taken to Court\\", New York Times, Feb 22, 1900, p. 3. and police closed the theatre on March 5. Following a month of intense public and press interest (during which Nethersole and her company performed different plays) and a two-day trial, a jury spent 15 minutes acquitting Nethersole and the others. The play reopened two days later, on April 7. The Sapho indecency trial is a well-known step in the transition from the era of Victorian morality as it existed in America, particularly as regards attitudes toward onstage depictions of gender, intimacy and sex. According to Olga Nethersole's 1951 obituary, \\"During the Comstock era...when a public kiss on the mouth was considered an indecency...Nethersole typified the growing revolt against prudery and was a staunch advocate of women's right and intellectual independence.\\"\\"Olga Nethersole Dies,\\" New York Times, Jan. 11, 1951, p. 2. Some historians theorize that the authorities treated Nethersole more harshly than women appearing in other \\"courtesan\\" plays because she was a manager in addition to an actress, which upset other contemporary social norms regarding the roles of men and women.For example, Johnson, Sisters in Sin, p. 17; Houchin, \\"Depraved Women and Wicked Plays\\", pp. 40, 51. Other adaptations *Jules Massenet made Daudet's book into an opera that opened in 1898, while Fitch was writing his adaptation for Nethersole. *The comedy duo of Weber and Fields routinely satirized Broadway plays and sent up Sapho in a sketch called Sapolio.Once Sapho became prominent, \\"Sapolio\\" was added to Weber and Fields' 1899-1900 show, Whirl-i-gig.

It is endemic to the state of New Mexico in the United States, where it is known from only three sites in Eddy County.USFWS. Eriogonum gypsophilum Five-year Review. November 2007.Eriogonum gypsophilum. Flora of North America.Eriogonum gypsophilum. The Nature Conservancy.Eriogonum gypsophilum. Center for Plant Conservation. It is limited to a specific type of soil which is high in gypsum. The plant has been federally listed as a threatened species of the United States since 1981.USFWS. Determination of two New Mexico plants to be endangered species and threatened species with critical habitat. Federal Register January 19, 1981. Habitat and range This rare plant can be found at three locations in Eddy County, New Mexico: the Seven River Hills, the Black River, and the Ben Slaughter Draw, a small, sloping valley.Ben Slaughter Draw, New Mexico. USGS Jumping Spring Quad, New Mexico, Topographic Map The plant only grows on gypsum substrates, including outcrops of gypsum rock and areas with gypsum soils. There are few other plants in this barren, rocky habitat, except for other gypsophiles. Plants that grow with the buckwheat on this nearly pure gypsum substrate include Tiquilia hispidissima, Mentzelia humilis, and Anulocaulis leiosolenus.Eriogonum gypsophilum. New Mexico Rare Plants. This area is within the Chihuahuan Desert and surrounding habitat includes creosote scrub. Description This plant is a perennial herb which usually reproduces vegetatively, by producing new stems from its rhizome, in effect cloning itself. Sometimes it reproduces sexually by making seed, however, the habitat and climate where it grows is often unsuitable for germination. Because many plants are clones rather than separate genetic individuals it is difficult to estimate the true number of plants existing. One estimate suggests there are 11,000 to 18,000 plants in each of the three populations. It is possible that more populations exist in unsurveyed gypsum rock habitat across the Eddy County border, in the state of Texas, but much of this habitat is on private land and is not open for exploration. This wild buckwheat species produces erect stems up to 20 centimeters tall and bearing inflorescences of many tiny bright yellow flowers in headlike clusters or cymes. The base of the plant is surrounded by a mat of green leaves growing on the branching caudex. Conservation The plant is found on an area of land measuring under total. Much of the plant's habitat, including half of the Black River and Ben Slaughter Draw tracts and most all of the Seven River Hills, is protected within the bounds of Bureau of Land Management oversight. In addition, the BLM will manage this land through the year 2028, even if the plant loses federal protection. The main threat to the species is habitat destruction during gypsum mining and oil and gas exploration, but this is prevented in BLM territory. There was only one population of the plant known in 1981 when it was federally listed; the other two have been discovered since, increasing the known abundance. In 2007, this factor, plus the lack of threats to the species as long as BLM protection is in place, led the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to suggest the species be delisted, or removed from the endangered species list.

She was a pioneering champion of the use of recycled materials in furniture design. A system she invented for building furniture out of packing crates represents one of the earliest to adopt a modular approach to the design of individual units. She also founded one of the earliest ready-to-assemble furniture companies, as well as the Home Thrift Organization to teach woodworking to New York City boys. In 1940, she received a medal from the HTA in honor of her quarter century of service to the organization. Early life and education Louise Ashton Brigham was born in Boston, the fourth of five children of William Cleveland Brigham (b. 1840) and Maria Wilson Sheppard Brigham (b. 1845). She had an older brother, Waldo (b. 1869), and an older sister, Lucy (b. 1873). Another sister, Emma, was born four years before Louise but died in infancy. The final child of the family, Anna, was born a year after Louise. When Louise was only two years old, her mother died, and she was to lose her father when she was just 19. Brigham studied art and design in New York at the Pratt Institute and the Chase School of Art (which became the New York School of Art in 1898 and is known today as Parsons The New School for Design), as well as at art schools in Europe. Career At some point in the late 1890s, Brigham became involved in the settlement house movement and established Sunshine Cottage in Cleveland, Ohio. The 1900 census lists her as a teacher and \\"settlement worker\\" in Cleveland, living at Hiram House, a settlement house founded by George A. Bellamy. In the early 1900s, she founded another settlement house in Cleveland, Sunshine Cottage. Information about Brigham‚Äôs youth and the circumstances of her upbringing is scanty. Her father was an apothecary; the 1880 census shows the family living in Medford, Massachusetts. Given that Brigham seems never to have had to work for a living and that for much of her adult life she was not supported by a husband (she did not marry until the age of 41), it seems reasonable to deduce that her family was relatively well-off for the time. =Travels abroad= During her early 30s, Brigham traveled widely in Europe, staying abroad for much of the period between 1905 and 1910. As she herself put it in a 1913 interview: \\"I spent the biggest part of five years in Europe, studying various kinds of handiwork with the peasants and the artists of nineteen different countries.\\" Her destinations included the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. Highly influential for Brigham's later design work were two summers spent in a coal-mining camp on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, which sits well above the Arctic Circle in the Svalbard archipelago. Brigham does not precisely date these two summers in her published writings, but a reference to a visit by members of an expedition led by the American aviator Walter Wellman suggests that one of them was 1906, the year that Wellman set up headquarters in the Svalbard archipelago in an attempt to reach the North Pole by airship. Brigham stayed in a camp managed by John Munroe Longyear, a fellow Bostonian of her father‚Äôs generation. In 1905, Longyear had co-founded the Arctic Coal Company to carry out mining operations in an area along the west coast of Spitsbergen that came to be called Longyear City (today Longyearbyen). The camp housed 80 men at the time Brigham was there‚Äîrising to several hundred in the years leading up to World War I‚Äîand conditions were extremely primitive. Enough food and equipment had to be brought in by ship during the summer months to supply the camp during the eight months it would be cut off from the outside world by winter ice, and the result of this stockpiling was large stacks of empty boxes. Under these difficult conditions, Brigham undertook to design what she called \\"box furniture\\" for the camp out of those cast-off packing crates, following up on some earlier experiments along the same lines. =Box furniture= In 1909, Brigham published a book of her designs for building furniture entirely out of packing crates entitled Box Furniture. Illustrated with line drawings by the interior designer Edward H. Aschermann (whom Brigham had met through their mutual friend, the Viennese Secessionist architect-designer Josef Hoffmann), Box Furniture was a how-to manual for a target audience of modestly skilled working-class householders. It offered dozens of different furniture plans, advice on how to select and break down crates, instruction in basic carpentry, and a list of necessary tools. Designs were grouped into suites for specific rooms, as well as organized along a trajectory of increasing complexity. Brigham also offered complementary advice on curtain materials and overall color schemes. The cover of Brigham's 1909 book on creating furniture from packing crates. In addition to working exclusively with recycled materials of the cheapest kind, Brigham planned many of her designs to be multifunctional and space-saving (a drop-leaf table, a set of nesting stools, a desk with built-in bookcases) as they were aimed primarily at urban apartment dwellers. Brigham also took a modular or sectional approach to some of her pieces, as several of the smaller pieces are designed in such a way that they can either stand alone or work as subunits of larger pieces. A room of furniture built according to Brigham's designs, illustrated for The Ladies' Home Journal, 1910. Brigham specifically aligns her modernist aesthetic with that of Hoffmann, with its focus on the square as a fundamental unit of design. However, the raw surfaces and rough construction that were keystones of her approach don't become a mainstay of modern design for another two decades, when Gerrit Rietveld's crate furniture of the 1930s recapitulates Brigham's box furniture under the banner of De Stijl. A combination desk, reading table, and bookcase built from crates during Brigham's sojourn on the island of Spitsbergen. The plans were later published in her book. Brigham's ambitious project of combining up-to-date design with a do-it-yourself approach was both unusual in its own time and a forerunner of today's green design movement. One writer assesses Brigham's project as \\"a comprehensive system attached to a design theory and a social agenda\\". =Home Thrift Association= In 1910, Brigham showed \\"Room Delightful\\", an entire suite of box furniture for a child‚Äôs room at a Child Welfare Exhibit in New York City. Interested city officials offered Brigham the use of the then-closed Gracie Mansion for further experimentation. Brigham accepted and founded the Home Thrift Association, a woodworking \\"laboratory\\" for boys: \\"We give each boy a set of the seven simple tools and show him the beginnings of his work. Then he does the rest.\\" The HTA, which later opened to girls as well, aimed \\"not only at thrift, but at the conservation of the home.\\" Initially headquartered in just two rooms of Gracie Mansion, the club quickly outgrew its space as it gained some 600 apprentices in its first year of operation. It then moved to 516 E. 89th Street, not far from Brigham‚Äôs own apartment at 539 E. 89th St., which Brigham furnished almost entirely out of box furniture made by the HTA apprentices as a kind of model showroom for the project. The total cost of the box furnishings for Brigham's apartment was around $4, or less than half of an average worker's weekly wage. =Ready-to-assemble furniture= During World War 1, Brigham founded a box furniture factory on the Lower East Side of New York. It aimed to capture the low-cost end of the emerging market in factory- made furniture while providing jobs for modestly skilled workers. It was eventually turned over the YMCA to run on behalf of returning war veterans. Around the same time, Brigham and two partners set up Home Art Masters, a mail-order business offering ready-to-assemble furniture kits with instructions so that the item could be assembled at home with simple tools. This short-lived business was decades ahead of what are usually taken to the starting points of commercial RTA furniture, which include efforts by Australian designer Frederick Charles Ward (late 1940s), American cabinetmaker Erie J. Sauder (1953), and IKEA (1956). Later years In part due to Brigham's teaching at the HTA and associated publicity, box furniture had something of a vogue in the years leading up to World War I. Her book went through several editions and was translated into a number of foreign languages. However, after the war information on Brigham again becomes thin. On August 21, 1916, Brigham married 64-year-old Henry Arnott Chisholm at the Mission Inn in Riverside, California. A graduate of the Harvard class of 1874, Chisholm lived in Cleveland, where he had worked for the Cleveland Rolling Mills and later become a partner in William Chisholm Steel Shovel Works. Henry Chisholm died in 1920, and in the ensuing years Brigham worked on a new edition of her book (never published) and a memoir (since lost). In the 1930s, she became a disciple of the American healer and clairvoyant Edgar Cayce and spent much time with him and his family. She died in the Sylvan Nursing Home in Trenton, New Jersey, on March 30, 1956.

The plaza was opened on 1 August 2009 by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and is part of the City's plans for environmentally friendly renovation projects such as the Cheonggye Stream and Seoul Plaza. It is also historically significant as the location of royal administrative buildings, known as Yukjo-geori or Street of Six Ministries; and features statues of Admiral Yi Sun-sin of Joseon Dynasty and King Sejong the Great of Joseon. The goal of opening and reconstructing this plaza is to make it a historical and cultural place for the common citizen. History The statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin The area of the Gwanghwamun Plaza has a long history. It has been a public space and road for centuries of Korean history. Sometime in the 20th century it has been converted into a 16-lane roadway. A new pedestrian-friendly open downtown urban space was first announced in February 2004, along with projects for Namdaemun and Seoul Plaza. In December 2006, further plans for the plaza was announced. The project in conjunction with the restoration of Gwanghwamun was carried out by the Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea, and schedule for completion by August 2009. Construction of the plaza was originally scheduled to begin in February 2008, however it was delayed because of opposition from the National Police Agency, who was concerned that the plaza could be abused as a venue for mass protests. Construction commenced on 23 April 2008, after the Government decreed it a demonstration-free zone. The plans included moving the statue of King Sejong from Deoksugung to the Plaza. However, after surveys of citizens and experts, it was decided to commission a new statue of King Sejong in a sitting position and chose the design in a competition between a shortlist of artists recommended by the Korean Fine Arts Association and universities. The plaza was opened on 1 August 2009 after a renovation period of 15-months, which downsized the 600-meter Sejongno, from 16-lanes to 10-lanes of traffic, at a cost of . It is in front of Gwanghwamun and stretches south from the three-way intersection, along the front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts on the west side and Kyobo Book Centre on the east side, to the Sejong-ro intersection, where the statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin stands. At the opening the plaza was covered in a flower carpet, 162 m long and 17.5 m wide, with 224,537 flowers representing the number of days from when Seoul was declared the capital on 28 October 1394, to the opening of the plaza on 1 August 2009. Landmarks Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin with the 12.23 Fountain in front in 2012 The Plaza features a water fountain in honor of the achievements of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. It is named the 12.23 Fountain, to commemorates the 23 battles he fought with 12 warships, when he led Koreans to victory during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì1598). The water jets rises to a height of 18 meters along with 300 smaller jets, which symbolize the battles he fought on the sea. It also has a waterway, two centimeters deep and one meter across, at 365 meters along the plaza's east side. The floor of it has 617 stones recording the major events from 1392 to 2008. The fountain is located next to the statue of Admiral Yi Sun-shin. This statue was erected on April 27, 1968. On 9 October 2009, two months after the Plaza opening, a second statue, the 6.2-meter high, 20-ton bronze statue of King Sejong the Great of Joseon was unveiled to the public. It is located 250 meters behind the statue of the Admiral Yi Sun-sin. It was dedicated on Hangul Day in celebration of the 563rd anniversary of the invention of the Korean alphabet by King Sejong. Underneath the statues there is a small exhibition hall and museum about the two historical figures depicted the statues. Administration Rallies and demonstrations are illegal at the Plaza and the Seoul Metropolitan Government has decreed that it is to use for cultural exhibitions and a demonstration-free zone. As of 1 June 2011, the Plaza along with Seoul Plaza are designated as smoke-free zones by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Smokers are fined in violation. On 23 September 2012, the Government started on a trial basis, a 550-m designated section of Sejong-ro as pedestrian-only but permitted for cyclists. The section includes the road from the Gwanghwamun three-way intersection, along the plaza in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts to the Sejong-ro intersection. Events The Plaza is the location for the start of the annual Seoul International Marathon, which finishes within the Olympic Stadium.2011 Seoul International Marathon Information. Dong-A Marathon. Retrieved on 2011-03-19. In the first winter after its opening the Plaza hosted an open air ice-rink from 12 December 2009 to 15 February 2010. The public rink was 2,250 sq. m, which was larger than the one at Seoul Plaza at 2,100 sq. m. The plaza is one of the site of street cheering of the FIFA World Cup. In popular culture On 29 November 2009, parts of Sejong-ro were closed to traffic for twelve hours to film lengthy gunfight scenes for Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)'s 2009 spy action television drama series Iris, starring Lee Byung-hun, Kim Tae- hee, Jung Joon-ho, Kim Seung-woo and Kim So-yeon. The five lanes along the plaza in front of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts were closed to traffic from 07:00 to 19:00, while the five lanes on the Kyobo Book Centre side remains open to traffic. This marks the first time the Seoul Metropolitan Government has granted permission to blocked traffic along the Plaza for filming and it is part of Government's plans to promote the city's major tourist attractions; including Cheonggye Stream and Han River. Entrance to Haechi Madang at exit 9 in Gwanghwamun Plaza On 26 July 2012 at 23:00, boy band Beast held a guerilla concert at the Gwanghwamun end of the plaza, in front of an audience of 4,000 people. It was part of their promotion for their fifth mini album Midnight Sun, and the performance was broadcast on SBS's music show Inkigayo. In 2012, the plaza was used as a filming location for tvN drama Queen and I, where the two lead characters Kim Boong-do and Choi Hee- jin, played by Ji Hyun-woo and Yoo In-na, share a kiss dubbed the 'Gwanghwamun kiss' against the backdrop of Gwanghwamun. Kyuhyun, of boy band Super Junior, used the location as a theme for his 2014 chart-topping single, \\"At Gwanghwamun\\", and his label-mate Jo Sung-mo, of TRAX, recorded a live electric guitar cover of the song with Gwanghwamun Gate in the background.

They were built by Fiat/Viberti in 1958 and were numbered 39‚Äì41. ESHOT never acquired any more articulated trolleybuses. In the 1960s, the high cost of importing new trolleybuses led the company to convert a batch of B√ºssing motorbuses into trolleybuses.

The film was produced and directed by screenwriter Mario Siciliano in his debut as a director. It was based on the novel Rebellion by Piero Regnoli, under his pen name Dean Craig. Plot Set during the Simba rebellion, during the Congo Crisis, the film begins with: a quote from Martin Luther King Jr.; the spearing executions of a group of captured mercenaries; and the pack rape of a French female journalist. At Mercenary Central an angry Colonel Kimber rebukes the only survivor of the incident, German Captain De Brand. De Brand has left important documents in the Simba village that contains information on the activities and employers of the mercenaries. The documents must be retrieved within four days. De Brand says he can recover the papers and rescue the captured journalist with a small patrol. The Colonel agrees, but informs De Brand that his record of performance clearly shows he is incapable of leadership, and appoints African- American Captain Lauderwood to lead the patrol. Kimber adds three men to the patrol: a German Field Commander, a black African named Martinez and an Irishman named O'Fearn. As the patrol is unfamiliar with a swamp and desert they have to cross, Lauderwood recruits Carr√®s, a French gunrunner, for the fee of $15,000. Carr√®s is familiar with the area as he has sold weapons to the Simbas. Carr√®s became a weapons salesman after witnessing the torture of his wife who was burned and beaten to death in front of him. He became further alienated when the French government did not want to antagonise the local situation by seeking their prosecution. Lauderwood also takes along Wooder, a female mercenary doctor. Cast Note: the pairings of actor-to-role at IMDB and BFI are not in complete agreement Production trivia Marturano also acted as the film's armourer and stunt director. Several of the action set pieces of the film were reused in Siciliano's 1978 Scorticateli vivi (Skin 'em Alive).

It is dedicated to Saint Eusebius of Vercelli, the first bishop.  History  The present cathedral is built on the site of earlier ones. The construction of the first, in the 4th century, is ascribed to Saint Eusebius himself, who, it is believed, built it over an ancient necropolis containing the remains of Saint Theonestus, to whom Eusebius dedicated it.Catholic Encyclopedia: Vercelli. The relics of Theonestus are still preserved in the present cathedral. After Eusebius's death he was buried there himself, and the dedication changed accordingly. This building was destroyed during the Gothic invasions of the 5th century. Its replacement was a large basilica inspired by those of Rome and Ravenna. A major refurbishment was carried out in the 9th century. In the 11th century another major restoration took place, as a consequence of extreme decay and in particular of a serious fire in 997 that threatened the stability of the structure. In the 12th century the present campanile was built, and the main body of the cathedral restored again: it now had five aisles separated by columns, a transept and an imposing portico. The apse was decorated with mosaics, and in the presbytery was an ambo sculpted by Benedetto Antelami. In the second half of the 16th century Pellegrino Tibaldi of Valsolda was commissioned by the then bishop, Guido Ferrero, to rebuild the cathedral entirely to replace the medieval building, which the bishop had demolished. Tibaldi was able to erect the choir, the side chapels and the two sacristies before lack of funds brought the work to a halt after eight years. In 1682 a chapel to the south was built for the tomb of Blessed Amadeus IX. Between 1702 and 1717 Stefano Negro built the nave, aisles and transept. The remaining parts of the structure, including the west front, were completed in 1757-63 by Benedetto Alfieri and Luigi Barberis, who towards the end of the 18th century also added a chapel off the northern aisle for the relics of Saint Eusebius, which had been discovered during the reconstruction works of the 16th century. This was rebuilt in the late 19th century by Giuseppe Locarni, and the urn containing the remains is now located beneath the high altar. Giovanni Larghi added a dome in 1857-60. In a chapel off the southern nave are buried not only Blessed Amadeus IX, for whose tomb it was built, but also other members of the ruling house of Savoy, including Charles I, Charles III, Yolande of Valois (wife of Blessed Amadeus) and Victor Amadeus I. Treasury and library The cathedral possesses both an important treasury, now a museum, and an important library, housing the Vercelli Book and the Codex Vercellensis.

Chapman, of the 1st Dragoons, took the first census of the Pimas and Maricopas, he found a Pima population of 535; 110 warriors, 425 women and children led by a Captain named Chelan at this village now named Casa Blanca.Lieutenant Chapman's census was printed in the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, 1858, as an appendix to Special Agent G. Bailey's report of November 4th on the Indians of southern Arizona and New Mexico. United States. Office of Indian Affairs / Annual report of the commissioner of Indian affairs, for the year 1858, New Mexico superintendency, pp.202-208 The next year another official census was taken by the special Indian Agent that showed Casa Blanca had 491 Pimas, broken down as 50 Aged, 146 Men, 103 Women, 105 Boys, 87 Girls, led by Captain Candela. Also enumerated were 30 cattle and 46 horses. \\"On even brief analysis, this census bears little resemblance to reality. The most curious thing about it is why, after he counted almost 400 fewer persons, St. John should have thought that the earlier census was incomplete. The numbers suggest that the reverse may have been the case (St. John to Greenwood, September 16, 1859; Hackenberg 1974a I: 296, 306-307). St. John's tabulations suggest that he drastically undercounted the number of children, or overstated the number of adult men and women, if not both. The clue is that for neither the Pimas nor the Maricopas did the combined total of boys and girls even equal the number of women, which would mean less than one child per family, a population in a precipitous decline. This, as the regular census of 1860 shows, was not the case. He may however have encouraged nearly all of the adult males to be present, in order not to miss out on the manta and other clothing, tobacco, beads and farm implements handed out in September.\\" from John Philip Wilson, Peoples of the Middle Gila: A Documentary History of the Pimas and Maricopas, 1500s-1945, Gila River Indian Community (Arizona: Association), Sacaton, Arizona, 1999, p.153 The 1860 Census showed a total Pima population of 323 composed of 71 Male heads of household, 66 Female heads, 82 Male Children 87 female children and 17 Other males and females.Wilson, Peoples of the Middle Gila, 1999, p.166 Schedule 1 - 8 Pima Villages It also show they had 164 horses and 102 cattle and 59 farmers tilled 587 acres of improved land.Wilson, Peoples of the Middle Gila, 1999, p.167 Schedule 4 - 8 Pima Villages Casa Blanca became the site of the Casa Blanca Station of the Butterfield Overland Mail in 1858. It was located about 4,200 feet west-northwest of the Casa Blanca ruin mound.Wilson, Peoples of the Middle Gila, 1999, p.147 The station agent of Casa Blanca Station, Silas St. John, also became Special Agent for the Pima and Maricopa Indians on February 18, 1859, and later that year built the Indian Agency buildings for the Pima Villages in the village in 1859. These consisted of two buildings with a picket fence or corral between them. located about 3,500 feet northwest of the ruin mound at Casa Blanca and some 800 feet from the stage station. One, an adobe, was a blacksmith shop, the other of jacal construction, was a carpenter shop and agency office.Wilson, Peoples of the Middle Gila, 1999, p. 144, 147 In 1860, the census showed fifteen European Americans at Casa Blanca who were part of Ammi M. White's enterprise there. White, with his half-brother, Cyrus Lennan, and partner E.S. Noyes, established a trading post at Casa Blanca. White & Co. had taken over the buildings of St.John's Indian agency, (after his resignation from that post in late 1859), which included a blacksmith shop, run by Noyes. =White's Mill and the Civil War= White's Mill would be established at Casa Blanca in 1861 to turn the Pima's grain into flour.Wilson, Peoples of the Middle Gila, 1999, p.162 At the beginning of the American Civil War, Ammi White began stockpiling flour and other food for the California Column at the mill, which became the target of a raid by the Arizona Rangers a Confederate Army detachment sent to occupy southern Arizona. Led by Captain Sherod Hunter, the raid destroyed the mill machinery, captured Ammi White and returned the flour and other food to the Pima. When Captain Hunter impersonated White and his men posed as locals, they also captured Union Army Captain William McCleave and his detachment who came to visit the mill. Once the California Column arrived they found they had to wait to gather up flour and food to continue their march to Tucson and so they built Fort Barrett around the mill to protect their depot there. After the capture of Tucson the post was abandoned except as a post for vedettes and express riders. Ammi White was later exchanged, as the Confederate Army retreated from New Mexico Territory, returning to rebuild his mill which, with the increased production of the Pima farmers, helped to feed the Union Army and the local population of the territory during the rest of the war. After White sold the mill and moved away in 1867, it was destroyed in a flood in September 1868. Subsequently, the machinery was salvaged and moved to Adamsville.Wilson, John P., Peoples of the Middle Gila: A Documentary History of the Pimas and Maricopas, 1500s-1945, Las Cruces, N.M., 1999. pp.162 181-182, 218-219  Demographics  As of the census of 2010, there were 1,388 people residing in the CDP.

Born in Trnava, he studied at Comenius University and went into the publishing business. Elected to the National Council in 2010 on the Freedom and Solidarity party list, Matoviƒç founded the Ordinary People (Obyƒçajn√≠ ƒæudia) movement in 2011, which ran on an anti- corruption ticket and was politically to the centre-right. His anti-corruption campaigning has been marked out by \\"publicity stunts to shine a light on alleged graft\\" particularly focusing on parliamentary privileges and bribery. Matoviƒç was reelected in 2020, his party obtaining a sufficient number of seats to enter into a coalition government with three other centrist and right-wing parties. Matoviƒç's choices for his cabinet were accepted by President Zuzana ƒåaputov√° and he was appointed Prime Minister on 21 March 2020. Early life and business career Igor Matoviƒç was born in Trnava on 11 May 1973. In 1993, he began to study at the Faculty of Management at Comenius University, graduating in 1998. He founded a business in 1997 and worked as the chief executive of Trnava publishing house regionPRESS from 2002 to 2010. Matoviƒç later transferred the business to his wife, Pavl√≠na (n√©e Repaska). Agence France-Presse described him as an \\"eccentric self-made millionaire and former media boss\\" who had become \\"a media-savvy but unpredictable politician\\". Political career In 2010, Matoviƒç founded the Ordinary People (Obyƒçajn√≠ ƒæudia) civic movement, which was generally centre-right and emphasized anti-corruption. Matoviƒç advertised the civic movement using free leaflets distributed by his family's press company. Along with three other OƒΩaNO MPs, he first won election at the 2010 election on the Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) list. He sat in the SaS caucus until February the following year, when he supported the opposition Smer's proposed restrictions on Multiple citizenship. Matoviƒç's opposition to the government's position led to SaS being dropped from the coalition. In 2011, Iveta Radiƒçov√°'s government fell apart, which led to new elections in 2012. Led by Matoviƒç, Ordinary People was reconstituted into OƒΩaNO (Ordinary People and Independent Personalities), an independent political party. OƒΩaNO won 8.55% and 16 seats. He stayed in the opposition as he was unwilling to work with Smer-SD. As leader of OƒΩaNO, Matoviƒç attracted attention by campaigning against corruption. To oppose parliamentary immunity, he parked his car on a sidewalk and showed his parliamentary pass to police who tried to tow it; to oppose corruption, he took a polygraph test stating that he had never accepted bribes. However, Robert Fico accused Matoviƒç of impropriety in effecting a fictitious sale of the regionPRESS business for 122 million Slovak koruna to employee Pavel Vand√°k, who supposedly got the money from an internal account. Matoviƒç denies this. Prime Minister of Slovakia Matoviƒç's party OƒΩaNO got the plurality of votes in the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election on 29 February 2020, winning 53 seats in the 150-member National Council with 25.02% of the vote. Corruption was a major issue in the election, which helped Matoviƒç, who had long positioned himself as an anti-corruption activist. On 13 March, Matoviƒç announced he had reached an agreement for a governing coalition with the other centrist and right-wing parties We Are Family, Freedom and Solidarity and For the People, though they had not agreed upon a common governing program. He did not disclose his picks for the new cabinet. Matoviƒç submitted his cabinet selection to President Zuzana ƒåaputov√° on 16 March; she accepted all of the appointments. The new cabinet's composition was revealed on 18 March and was sworn in on 21 March. In July 2020, Matoviƒç admitted to plagiarizing his masters' thesis after an investigation from Denn√≠k N found that entire pages and charts were lifted from the sources. He said he would step down after all his election promises were fulfilled. Comenius University in Bratislava confirmed the plagiarism of the master's thesis. Sociologist of the Bratislava Policy Institute, Michal Va≈°eƒçka, stated that \\"Matoviƒç has started to transform the anger of the society into a class war: city vs. countryside, educated vs. uneducated, common people vs. the elites.\\" He suggested that political polarization would result.

Gomez played for the San Diego Padres 1993 and the San Francisco Giants 1994-1995. He batted and threw left-handed. Pat was a 1986 graduate of San Juan High School, where in his senior season, he fanned 110 batters in 70 innings of work. Having a fast ball that was clocked consistently in the mid-90s, he was drafted that summer in the 4th round by the Chicago Cubs. During his time in the minor leagues, he was a 2-time minor league All Star (Carolina League - 1989, Southern League - 1992). One of his fondest memories while in the minor leagues was being a part of the historic 1992 Greenville Braves that won 100 games, a record that still stands today. Pat's contribution was a 7-0 record with an amazingly low 1.13 ERA. His reward was a call-up to the big leagues in time to be a part of the Atlanta Braves winning the National League West division. They then went on to win the National League Championship Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates. During the winter of 1992, Pat was traded briefly to the Texas Rangers, then to the San Diego Padres in time for the 1993 season. The 1993 roster included baseball legends like Fred McGriff, Trevor Hoffman, Gary Sheffield, Bruce Hurst, and everyone's favorite Padre, Tony Gwynn. During the 1993 season, Pat posted a 5.14 ERA. During the off-season, Pat found out he had a bone spur on his left elbow, which was operated on and found to be a minor inconvenience at most. During that off-season, he had workouts for the Florida Marlins, the Oakland A's, and the San Francisco Giants. The next two years brought him to the San Francisco Giants where he played alongside legends of the game like Matt Williams, Robby Thompson, Dave Burba, Rod Beck, Darryl Strawberry, Willie McGee, Deion Sanders, Shawn Estes, and Barry Bonds. In 1994, Pat posted a 3.78 ERA working mainly long relief. In the 1995 season, Pat posted a 5.14 ERA working long relief. In the off-season of 1995, Pat had learned that an ankle injury he got while working out in the off-season (while still with the Chicago Cubs' farm system) could have a long-term impact on his ability to walk, which made the 1995 season his last in the major leagues. Since retiring from baseball, Pat has worked as a wholesale auto dealer and currently owns a vending machine business out of Roseville, CA. He is very involved in ministry at his church, serving in children's ministry, music ministry, and serving at Salvation Army as well.

The series follows the titular Junk Raiders, a team of eight professionals as they attempt to renovate a site in Toronto's Don Valley (on Bayview Avenue) and renovate it to a two-story \\"clubhouse\\" in one month with only a C$5000 budget, as part of the Evergreen Brick Works project. Because of the extremely limited budget, many of the materials needed must be found by freecycling: finding something unwanted for free and reusing it. The Team The team consists of the following members, both new and returning: *Geoff Woodmansey returns for the second season of the series. Besides from his work on this show and on Canada's Worst Handyman, he spends his time renovating homes in some of Toronto's most exclusive neighborhoods. *Gordie Wornoff, the only other returning member, is a salvager who salvages as a way of life. He is skilled in carpentry, having built his house from repurposed wood, and he is also a freegan, regularly eating otherwise good food that has been disposed of. *Andy Berry is the team's designer. He has designed residences, commercial spaces, and film sets. His ideals match that of the show, as his specialty is sourcing materials from junkyards and making them look pristine. *Paul Graham is the team's tech expert. The president of OpenLuna, an organization that seeks to get folks on the moon, he is also the builder behind \\"Beer-bot\\", a beverage- dispensing robot that keeps beer out of children's hands. *John Johnson is an inventor whose invention, the \\"Scoop-It Pooper Scooper\\", helped him pay for his first home.

He lives an old-fashioned lifestyle, from his way of life, not owning a computer or cell phone, to his way of plying his craft. *Katrina Tompkins is a Sheridan college graduate from 2009 from the Crafts and Design: Furniture Program.http://www.sheridancollege.ca/Programs%20and%20Courses/Full- Time%20Programs/Programs%20A-Z%20Index/Crafts%20and%20Design%20-%20Fabrics/More%20Info/~/media/WF_05_Program_AAD_Hwhitton_027/inmaterialcatalogue.ashx The team's client is Evergreen, a nonprofit organization in charge of the Brick Works project, a massive restoration project eight years in the making. Representing them is Martin Leifhebber, their architect, and Matthew Cohen, their senior project manager. Synopsis =Episode 1 - Days 1-3= :Original airdate: March 21, 2011 The team is introduced to a project from their warehouse in Toronto's west end: a clubhouse whose second story is made from two halves of a shipping container, with various artistic features adorning both floors of the site. The entire clubhouse will be built in their warehouse, and to be shipped over to the brickworks at the end of the project and assembled onsite. While Tom, Merv, and Katarina get to cutting the shipping container, Gordie and John are ordered to spend $1000 for of steel (much to both of their chagrins), used to reinforce the weakened shipping container. They head off to the site which had donated the shipping container, with instructions to haggle as necessary. The steel they need cost $60 more than what they have (if HST was taken into account), so they negotiate down to of new steel and various scrap fixings (intending to weld the rest together to make up the difference). Gordie and John also stop by Gordie's own shop for some of his stockpiled materials. The materials, however, disappoint Geoff (as he believes welded-together scrap will never meet building codes) and the rest of the team, and he takes out his frustrations on John (and less so on Gordie). Meanwhile, Andy gets cracking on the design of the living space, and Paul is tasked to start an online campaign to secure the recycled materials that they need. On the second day, the entire team (with Geoff) visit the Brickworks, where they also meet the clients, who have slightly (but not significantly) altered their plans to include a feature known as the \\"firefly\\". They also take the opportunity to salvage unused material from the Brickworks for various projects: John has secured an old motor and fan that he plans to convert into a wind generator to power the lights needed for the firefly, while Katrina has salvaged a large pipe for at least two pieces of furniture. However, they are unable to use everything that they salvage: a set of stairs (which they cannot use as-is due to building codes) they had thought of reusing is found to contain lead paint. On Day 3, Paul's online campaign has paid off, and he and Gordie secure parts from a local bicycle repair depot. While putting posters around the neighborhood (asking residents to donate useful materials for their project), they also spot a local contractor, who allow Gordie and Paul to scavenge from his dumpster. This junk haul helps the team cool off their tensions (especially between Merv and Tom, who briefly argue over one being a gofer to the other): John now can run his generator using the motor from a scooter rather than the older motor from the fan. Tom, however, is reserved about the use of some of the resourced metal, but he is assuaged by the fact that Geoff intends to sell off any metal that they cannot use. The crew spends the rest of the day inventorying the junk and finishing Katrina's and John project. The clients arrive, and are impressed by the progress so far. However, they are reserved on Andy's design, and specifically requests that the fan blades on John's fan be made larger and that Katrina's wall-mounted table be clear-coated to a matte finish. The team is happy with the great results so far, even if only $4000 remains in their budget. Deleted Scene: The deleted scene from this episode is from Day 1, where Tom is adamant that the bottle of special water that he brings from home each day is cold when he needs it. Geoff is willing to accommodate him, but Merv believes that Tom is being too much of a diva. =Episode 2 - Days 4-7= :Original airdate: March 28, 2011 Day 4 begins with Geoff ordering Tom and Merv to continue the structural work on the containers, while Katrina and John are tasked with their projects. Meanwhile, Paul is tasked to search for free structural steel desperately needed by Tom and Merv, while Gordie and Andy head off with a hot tip on the junk hotline; apparently, an elderly handyman (who also abided by the freecycling philosophy) had moved into a retirement home, and all of his stockpiled tools and materials are up for grabs. While the trip proved fruitful, they are still short windows and structural steel. Andy promptly takes the recovered hardwood flooring for a table project, but Geoff is forced to dip into the budget for the desperately needed steel. By day 5, they are still short on steel, and because Paul could not source the steel, Geoff sends Merv and Gordie to a scrapyard across the city (on McCowan Road in York Region) with $500 for the needed steel. They spend $300 on a series of older steel pipes to use as structural support, along with a series of truck and bus doors, intending to use them as the container's windows. However, they are short $90 on new steel, so he decides to pay the difference out of his own pocket. Meanwhile, Katrina and Andy finishes their project, and Paul is tasked on a project that would let people open the container door from the inside, using mostly bicycle parts. Andy switches gears and uses even more bike parts for a lounge chair as a recovered treadmill. When Gordie and Merv return, Geoff and Tom are concerned with the older (and possibly rusted) pipes, but Geoff is nevertheless forced to reimburse the $90 to Merv, and is sold on Gordie's idea to repurpose the truck and bus doors for windows. Day 6 begins with Geoff getting Tom and Merv competing against each other to see who would finish restructuring their half of the container first. The general consensus is that while Tom may be faster, Merv is more likely to finish with better quality, and indeed this is the case when both finish - so much so that Geoff is concerned with the quality of his work. Geoff, however, is more concerned with Paul's project, as he believes Paul is working too slowly. Geoff also begins work on 4 crib walls needed on the first floor, but they lack the structural steel. Andy suggests that they make the crib walls out of wood (also in short supply) despite Geoff's reservations that the clients would insist on metal. Gordie and Katrina are off in search for wood, but find much more than that, including plywood, steel pipe, scrap metal, and chain-link fencing, all of which are desperately needed. Meanwhile, John's windmill is finished, with the larger fan blades taken from the cut-out portions of the shipping container. Paul's project is sadly incomplete on Day 7, while Tom is tasked with a safety railing to accompany Paul's door opener. However, Merv also reminds Tom that he needs to finish his somewhat spotty work on the container. The clients arrive in the afternoon, and are immediately impressed with the windmill, which has also been painted yellow to match a sunflower found on the outside of the brickworks, as well as Katrina's chair/table combination and Tom's railing. They are also impressed by Tom and Merv's overall work, as Matthew's previous experience with renovating shipping containers had taken three times as long. They are less impressed by Andy's table, and is ultimately reserved on the windows from truck and car doors. They ultimately reject the wooden crib walls due to the industrial aesthetic of the brickworks, but is willing to concede a redesign so that less metal is used. To make things worse, the rusty pipes cannot be used for any project at all, rendering it a potential white elephant, which they cannot afford with $3410 left in their budget. Deleted Scene: The deleted scene from this episode is from Day 3, where Paul shares his fascination with space travel to Gordie. Gordie is somewhat reserved in his reaction, due to his environmentalist ways. =Episode 3 - Days 8-10= :Original airdate: April 4, 2011 Day 8 begins with Merv finishing the container, Tom on the railing, John and Paul on the door opener, Gordie to find sinks for a sink wall, Katrina on furniture projects, and Andy on more design work. While on the road looking for metal sinks and finding only cheap plastic ones, Gordie gets a hit on the junk hotline, where he manages to get 20000 smoke-damaged wine corks. The lack of anything of immediate use adds to Geoff's troubles, already at a high due to Paul spending too much time on the door opener. Geoff issues an ultimatum on the door: finish it or demolish it in two hours. After Gordie invites Geoff on a trip raiding the Canadian National Exhibition (Day 8 being Labour Day, the last day of the Exhibition) for possible crib wall supplies, Geoff leaves Andy in charge of the door opener's fate. However, Martin arrives unannounced just after Geoff leaves, leaving Andy to receive Martin's crib wall redesign. Martin also signs off on Andy's window layout, opening the way for Merv to install the window. Andy also approves of Paul's and John's work after one door is finished in the door opener. Day 9 marks the halfway point of the build in the workshop. However, Geoff is worried that they will not have the manpower needed to finish the steel work, and is contemplating dipping into the budget to hire another iron worker; even reassigning John to the iron work isn't enough. However, Tom and Merv balk at the thought of adding manpower due to morale issues, but the thought makes the crew work harder. Meanwhile, Gordie and Katrina hit a site near Bathurst Street and Lawrence Avenue to assist in a house demolition, and make off with most of the materials there. That night, Geoff makes good on his intention of hiring a steel worker for some overnight work on the steel supports that will prop the container up on the second storey. Day 10 starts with $2550 left in the budget, after the new steel ($500) and iron worker ($360) expenses are deducted. Geoff is concerned that there is no substantial progress in completed projects, and decides to hide the incomplete projects so to avoid Martin and Matthew rejecting their progress. However, the wetland rail is installed despite the door not being fully functional. When the clients arrive, Geoff uses the partially completed door opener, but they are concerned with the railing being a climbing hazard. They are reserved on the window installations, the supporting structure, especially the fact that they only have 3 of the 80 sinks needed for the sink wall. The time crunch is officially on, and Geoff is adamant that the pace must be picked up in order for the work to be finished on time. Deleted Scene: The deleted scene from this episode is from Day 8, where Geoff is riding Paul for taking too long to finish the door, even having to divert John from helping Merv with the steel work to finish it. Paul takes exception to Geoff's \\"eight days\\" assertion due to having done other tasks between working on the door. =Episode 4 - Days 11-13= :Original airdate: April 11, 2011 Day 11 begins with Andy starting on the kitchen, John and Paul on a water purification system, Katrina on various furniture project, Merv and Tommy on further structural work, and Gordie as a spare body. For John, this is not a new project (having once created a water purification system for an entire town from recycled parts), and Geoff is amazed with the design. However, Geoff is adamant that everyone has a parts list so that he knows what to buy, and Merv and Tom's parts list would be sucking up most of the budget ($2000) on the metal stairs, even with a 20% discount that Tom had fought hard to obtain. However, the materials that everyone else needs beyond the steel would easily break the bank. Later in the day, Gordie and John are off to Steam Whistle Brewing for recycled parts; the brewery is expanding and thus have a lot to recycle. Among the parts that they have scored are parts desperately needed for the purification system. Meanwhile, Merv and Tom are at odds over how the stairs are to be built; Tom is adamant that he does things \\"old-school\\" with chalk lines on the floor of the shop, while Merv is adamant that Tom use a calculator. Day 12 begins with Geoff running out of money, and he is turning to Gordie for desperately needed parts. Gordie and Andy head off to an old drive-in theater, where they can raid a storage container for parts. Meanwhile, the parts order has cost more than what anyone expected, and Geoff is forced to beg the crew to pay for the steel. Geoff is forced to tell the whole team that they are broke after Gordie and Andy return. The team is furious, as they forced to sell some of the unneeded metal for any new items. The scrap nets Geoff $360, which placates him. What isn't, though, is Tom's refusal to use a calculator, and though Merv is reluctant to follow Tom's old- school method, Geoff and Tom get into a shouting match, which in turn leads to Tom walking off the job in anger. Geoff and Tom make up at the start of Day 13, but Tom suddenly decides to do things Merv's way. There is another setback, however, as they had mismeasured some of the stairs, wasting some of their valuable metal and time. Paul had also found a buyer for one of their spare cast iron sinks for $200. Geoff is also concerned about how to fill in the crib walls, as their crushed glass wall seems too heavy (but Geoff is hopeful that the cork, which they have in plentiful supply, can be used as a substitute). However, they also manage to finish a brick wall from the wall the clients rejected earlier. Meanwhile, Andy and Katrina's kitchen is raising issues from the incomplete appearance, and Geoff ultimately decides to hide it from the clients. When the clients show up for inspection, they show their like of the brick wall, but they're adamant on the glass instead of the corks. They are also sold on the ozone generator in the water purification system, but they are concerned with some of the health issues. Geoff is forced to think hard and consider pulling the plug on some of the projects, as only $560 is left, all of which have already been earmarked for supplies needed by the team. Deleted Scene: The deleted scene from this episode is from Day 12, as the team contemplates on ways to raise money after Geoff admits to blowing the budget. Geoff considers selling one of the artisan pieces such as Tom's railing. Tom isn't opposed to the idea as he believes he can create a new one (though the rest of the team is reserved due to the massive steelwork still to be done), as long as the team can sell it on the right website for at least $1500; he is adamant about this as ten years ago, he was burned when the piece that took him $1500 to make sold for only $200 due to what he believed was a poor choice of website. =Episode 5 - Days 14-18= :Original airdate: April 18, 2011 Day 14 begins with most of the container structure completed, but one notable project that hasn't even started is the firefly. Geoff had put off the project for a long time, and he's forced to use the rest of his $500 for steel studs to build the firefly. As for his orders to the rest of the team, John is tasked with finding the rest of the sinks needed for the sink wall (as Gordie's chances of finding enough sinks is starting to slim), Katrina with a boardroom table, while Tom and Merv are tasked with preparing the container for installation at the brickworks. John is able to secure a barter deal for the needed sinks, but they do not have the stainless steel needed for bartering. Gordie heads to various sites around Toronto (a Toronto Works and Emergency Services storage locker and a storage space for old Toronto Santa Claus Parade floats) for the stainless steel, but unfortunately he returns with no stainless steel (though he does manage to find parts for the firefly). In a turn of events, Paul receives an offer for the bicycle chair built by Andy that will give them the cash needed to buy the sinks, but Andy refuses to give his consent to sell (despite the clients having stated their dislike for the chair). However, they may not have to sell the chair at all: they had earlier recovered two fudge machines, which contains enough stainless steel that they can trade for the sinks. Unfortunately, at the scrapyard they only have 33 of their 70 sinks, but they had managed to save four stainless steel augers that Andy had fought so hard to keep (as well as $230 in their account). Day 15 begins with Tom and Merv heading off to the brickworks to install the support columns, as Geoff begins building the firefly. The pressure is building for Andy and Katrina, as the furniture builds are up against a time crunch. Andy starts painting the box chairs Katrina had built earlier, and gets the inspiration for a portable kitchen island from a recovered stretcher; it is fully built three hours later. Meanwhile, Katrina starts work on a boardroom table from recovered tongue-in-groove cedar. At the brickworks, Tom and Merv discover that a sprinkler pipe is impeding their container installation, meaning that they must return to the shop and cut the supports down to size. After a late night of cutting, Tom and Merv try for a second try at the supports at the brickworks. Meanwhile, Geoff and Gordie manage to secure uncrushed cans from the brewery, which they use to get another crib wall completed (though two crib walls, including one out of the crushed auto glass that the clients want, is still to be built). As for the firefly, they have very little cladding; only 4 of the of the firefly can be covered with the recovered parts. When the clients arrive early at Geoff's request, they are sold on the can wall, and a design complication on the clients' end means that the sink wall may need fewer sinks than what they had thought. However, Geoff had brought the clients in to address the firefly; he is afraid that he cannot finish the firefly on time, and he makes his concerns clear with the clients. However, this only brings Geoff's time management into question, as they believe rightly that Geoff had put off the firefly until it was too late. Day 17 has Paul working on an AV system, Merv, Tom, and John on finishing touches on the container, and Andy and Katrina on the furniture. Paul heads off to an electronics recycling depot to raid what they have. One old monitor and overhead projector later, and a \\"poor man's projection display\\" is completed. An all-nighter by the entire crew later, Paul continues his work on the door opener, still non-functional after 18 days. Geoff, however, doesn't have the money to dispose of the leftover garbage from their build (needing $500 for a garbage bin), and Geoff is pressuring Andy to sell the bike chair once again. To add to the bad news, just as the door opener is finished and properly working, they discover that the sprinkler pipe may impede the door opener. Finally, the containers are loaded onto a flatbed truck and taken to the brickworks. The build at the workshop is now complete, but the team is confident that complications may still arise in the installation... =Episode 6 - Day 19-22= :Original airdate: April 25, 2011 Day 19 begins with Andy taking charge of the sink wall and Gordie with the garbage disposal. Geoff, Tom, and Merv head off to the brickworks to hoist the containers in place, but because of the limited clearance, the door opener that took Paul so much time to build and perfect must be taken down to get the container in place. Meanwhile, many of the sinks must be cleaned by Katrina and John, as they contain a rubber soundproofing applied to the underside. Gordie's approach to the garbage is exactly according to his lifestyle: selling it in a yard sale. Day 20 begins with Merv and Tom continuing with the container installation, Geoff and John taking the crib walls to the brickworks to be installed, all while Gordie goes to scrap the rest of their scrap metal for cash. However, they still need $30 for a garbage bin (and to avoid selling Andy's vaunted bike chair). Paul is tasked with finding the ultralight material for the firefly, while Gordie is organizing the yard sale. A late hit on the junk hotline allows Paul to get the rest of the firefly cladding they need, in the form of space blankets and LEDs. Back at the yard sale, despite a diminishing crowd, they are able to secure the garbage bin that they need, and the rest of what they cannot sell proceeds to the garbage bin. At the brickworks, while Tom works on the metal work that will secure the two container halves to each other, the rolling wall is discovered to not roll due to a buried rail track running under the wall. Day 21 begins with everything being packed and moved to the brickworks. Merv and Tom are already at the brickworks with a head start on the welding job. Geoff and John start on the windows, Andy and Katrina on installing the sink wall, while Gordie goes on hanging the sink wall. Unfortunately, the firefly's top-heaviness does not allow it to be hung even without the cladding. The kitchen and most of the container's internal furniture are installed without a hitch, but the cork crib wall (replacing the crushed auto glass) is discovered to have been damaged during the transport, and an argument between Tom, Paul, and John over a sheet metal awning (over which a solar panel is to be mounted) causes Tom to walk off the job in disgust. The rest of the team continues to press on through the night on various tasks. Day 22 is the final working day of the Junk Raiders experiment, and the day that the Evergreen Brick Works is open to the public for the first time. Still on the finished list is the firefly as well as some of the furniture. The team has only one hour before the clients show up for their final inspection, and because the firefly cladding is flammable, the bad news is that the firefly is doomed to fail. Furthermore, the water purification system and the projector media player are also acting up. This causes Tom to snap again with so little time until the clients arrive. The rest of the team works on finishing touches to the clubhouse. The clients arrive with four other Brickworks executives. They are greeted with the bad news on the firefly, but the rest of the team helps everyone through the completed clubhouse, as even Matthew and Martin has not seen over half of the projects before this point. The client group is mixed over the final project, especially on the brick wall and firefly, but they ultimately unanimously decide to keep the structure (less the firefly). The Junk Raiders celebrate their success in finishing the project with $5000, of which only $60 of which was spent on things other than structural steel.

It carries a variety of programming, with a focus on comedy, along with some sports events, including Major League Baseball and the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. , TBS was received by approximately 90.391 million households that subscribe to a pay television service throughout the United States. TBS was originally established on December 17, 1976 as the national feed of Turner's Atlanta, Georgia, independent television station, WTCG. The decision to begin offering WTCG via satellite transmission to cable and satellite subscribers throughout the United States expanded the small station into the first nationally distributed \\"superstation\\". With the assignment of WTBS as the broadcast station's call letters in 1979, the national feed became known as SuperStation WTBS, and later SuperStation TBS, TBS Superstation, or simply TBS. The channel broadcast a variety of programming during this era, including films, syndicated series, and sports (including Atlanta Braves baseball, basketball games involving the Atlanta Hawks and other NBA teams, and professional wrestling including Georgia Championship Wrestling, and later World Championship Wrestling). WTBS maintained a nearly identical program schedule as the national feed, aside from FCC-mandated public affairs and educational programming that only aired on the local signal. By the early 2000s, TBS had begun to focus more intensively on comedic programming, including sitcoms and other series. On October 1, 2007, TBS was converted by Turner into a conventional basic cable network, at which time it began to be carried within the Atlanta market on area cable providers alongside its existing local carriage on satellite providers DirecTV and Dish Network. The former parent station in Atlanta was concurrently relaunched as WPCH (branded as \\"Peachtree TV\\", which Turner sold to the Meredith Corporation in 2017) and reformatted as a traditional independent station with a separate schedule exclusively catering to the Atlanta market. History =Early years= TBS originated as a terrestrial television station in Atlanta, Georgia that began operating on UHF channel 17 on September 1, 1967, under the WJRJ-TV call letters. That station‚Äîwhich its original parent originally filed to transmit UHF channel 46, before modifying it to assign channel 17 as its frequency in February 1966‚Äîwas founded by Rice Broadcasting Inc. (owned by Atlanta entrepreneur Jack M. Rice, Jr., owner of locally based pay television firms Atlanta Telemeter Inc. and Home Theaters of Georgia Inc.). Rice built a massive new self-supporting tower later known as the Turner Broadcasting tower which stood 1,031 feet tall, which was the tallest freestanding structure ever built in Atlanta. The height of this tower gave Channel 17 a strong signal boost which greatly helped UHF broadcasts as television sets of that era featured low-sensitivity tuners and substandard antennas. Under Rice, WJRJ‚Äîthe first independent station to begin operation in the Atlanta market since WQXI- TV (channel 36, allocation now occupied by MyNetworkTV affiliate WATL) ceased operations on May 31, 1955‚Äîoperated on a shoestring budget, general entertainment format with a schedule consisting of a few off-network reruns (such as Father Knows Best, The Danny Thomas Show, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet and The Rifleman) and older feature films as well as a 15-minute news program. In July 1969, Rice Broadcasting reached an agreement to merge with the Turner Communications Corporation‚Äîan Atlanta-based group owned by entrepreneur Robert E. \\"Ted\\" Turner III, who ran his late father's billboard advertising business and had also expanded his interests to include radio stations in Chattanooga, Tennessee (WGOW); Charleston, South Carolina (WTMA- AM-FM, the FM station is now WSSX-FM); and Jacksonville, Florida (WMBR, now WBOB)‚Äîin an all-stock transaction. Under the sale terms, Rice would acquire Turner in an exchange of stock and adopt the Turner Communications name; however, Turner would acquire about 75% of the merged company and own 48.2% of its stock, receiving 1.2 million shares of Rice stock worth an estimated $3 million. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted approval of the acquisition on December 10, 1969, giving Turner its first television property. Soon after Turner received approval of its purchase of WJRJ-TV in January 1970, Turner changed the station's call letters to WTCG (which officially stood for _W_ e're _T_ urner _C_ ommunications _G_ roup, although the station used \\" _W_ atch _T_ his _C_ hannel _G_ row\\" as a promotional slogan). The sale was formally completed four months later on April 6, at which time Turner was assigned as licensee of WJRJ-TV. The channel 17 transmitter was originally located at 1018 West Peachtree Street Northwest (it has since been relocated to the Atlanta suburb of North Druid Hills, Georgia), with the antenna located on the Turner Broadcasting tower. The building at this site was once home to the studios of CBS affiliate WAGA-TV (channel 5; now a Fox owned-and-operated station) and, later, channel 17, during its first three years as WJRJ-TV. By 1980, the station moved to new studio facilities a few blocks west at the former site of the Progressive Club, along with overflow offices on Williams Street, across Interstate 75/85; those facilities now house Adult Swim and Williams Street Productions. (It shared the ex-Progressive Club studios with CNN and Headline News until the latter two moved their operations into the CNN Center downtown in 1987.) Early programming included movies from the 1930s and 1940s, sitcoms (such as Father Knows Best, Green Acres, Hazel, I Love Lucy, and The Lucy Show), and Japanese animated series (such as Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, Marine Boy, The Space Giants, Speed Racer, and Ultraman). The station also carried sports, such as Atlanta Braves baseball, Atlanta Hawks basketball, Atlanta Flames hockey, and Georgia Championship Wrestling. WTCG also made very low bids to acquire the rights to syndicated programming and film packages, leaving the network-affiliated stations in the market‚ÄîWAGA-TV, NBC affiliate WSB-TV (channel 2, now an ABC affiliate) and ABC affiliate WXIA- TV (channel 11, now an NBC affiliate)‚Äîto acquire the stronger shows. But, because of programming commitments that the affiliates had to their networks, those stations only kept the shows for a few years at a time and rarely renewed their contractual rights to continue airing them, after which WTCG bought the syndicated programs second-hand at much lower rates. By the mid-1970s, The Andy Griffith Show, The Flintstones, Leave It to Beaver, The Little Rascals, My Three Sons, Star Trek, The Three Stooges, and many others were added to the station's schedule. =WTCG gets beamed via satellite= By the time Turner acquired WTCG, most U.S. cities below the top 20 media markets lacked independent stations running general entertainment programs, and largely only had access to television stations affiliated with ABC, NBC, and CBS, along with a non-commercial educational station. Cable providers in these areas carried network-affiliated commercial and non-commercial television stations from neighboring markets‚Äîusually to serve as default outlets where one or more networks were not available locally‚Äîand if possible, an independent station (often located anywhere between away). Still, many places were far enough out of the reach of an independent station's signal that this was not an option. There were cable systems that carried three stations affiliated with each of the major commercial networks and three stations that were PBS member outlets (one station from within the home market and two stations from neighboring markets of each network). WTCG started to reach far beyond the Atlanta television market in the early 1970s to serve such areas lacking an independent station, as many cable television systems in middle and southern Georgia and surrounding areas of the Southeastern United States‚Äîparticularly Alabama, Tennessee and South Carolina‚Äîbegan picking up the UHF signal off-air and retransmitted the Atlanta studio/transmitter link feed to microwave relay towers (sometimes several times) back to their headends. (By June 1976, WTCG was carried by 95 cable systems in six Southeastern states, reaching an estimated 440,000 households.) Turner began formulating plans to take WTCG national upon hearing of the groundbreaking innovation that premium cable service Home Box Office (HBO) (which would eventually become a sister property to channel 17 as a result of Time Warner's 1996 acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System) engaged in to retransmit its programming nationwide utilizing communications satellites beginning with its September 30, 1975 telecast of the \\"Thrilla in Manila\\" boxing match. In December 1975, Ted Turner unveiled plans to distribute his station over communications satellite, enabling WTCG to extend distribution of its programming to cable and C-band satellite subscribers throughout the United States, especially in markets lacking even a distant independent station. With a more cost-effective and expiditious distribution method in place than would be capable through setting up microwave and coaxial telephone relay systems across the entire country, Turner got his idea off the ground by founding Southern Satellite Systems (SSS)‚Äîa common carrier uplink provider based in Tulsa, Oklahoma‚Äîto serve as the station's satellite redistributor, and subsequently purchased an earth-to-satellite transmitting station to be set up outside of WTCG's Peachtree Street studios in Atlanta. In order to get around FCC rules in effect at the time that prohibited a common carrier from having involvement in program origination, Turner decided to sell SSS to former Western Union vice president of marketing Edward L. Taylor for $1 and sold the transmitting station to RCA American Communications. Upon the sale's consummation in March 1976, Turner reached an agreement with Taylor to have the firm uplink the WTCG signal to the Satcom 1 satellite. Turner's plans to turn WTCG into a national cable service were made possible through various FCC deregulatory actions on signal importation during the 1970s; among them was a cable rules package passed in March 1972 that allowed cable systems in the 100 largest markets the right to carry imported signals (including the addition of two distant signals not already available in the market), restricted cable systems in smaller markets to carrying only three network stations and one independent station (except for undefinable markets that would not be limited in the number of carried imported signals), and instituted leapfrogging rules that required systems importing distant independent stations from the top-25 markets to choose from one or both of the two markets closest to the provider's city of license and any systems carrying the signal of a third independent being required to pick up a UHF or, if such a station is not available, VHF station located within a radius. The August 1975 passage of a policy allowing unlimited importation of distant signals either following a local \\"must carry\\" station's final daily sign-off or at 1:00 a.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time) and 12:00 a.m. (in all other time zones), and the December 1975 repeal of the agency's 1972 \\"leapfrogging\\" rules (which restricted cable systems from selecting a distant signal from among stations in the top-25 media markets beyond those closest to the licensed system). Furthermore, the Congressional passage of the Copyright Act of 1976 on October 1 of that year provided compulsory licenses to cable systems and \\"passive\\" satellite carriers, allowing them to retransmit any broadcast television station throughout the country, regardless of prior consent, without incurring copyright liability; this legislation also granted the U.S. Copyright Office the ability to charge cable systems royalty fees to be compensated to the owners of a copyrighted program. The station would still be subjected to program duplication restrictions covered under the original 1972 incarnation of the Syndication Exclusivity Rules (or \\"SyndEx\\"), which‚Äîprior to its repeal in July 1980‚Äîallowed television stations to claim local exclusivity over syndicated programs and required cable systems to either black out or secure an agreement with the claimant station or a syndication distributor to continue carrying a claimed program through an out-of-market station. At 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 17, 1976, WTCG became America's first \\"superstation\\"‚Äîindependent stations distributed to cable providers throughout their respective regions, or the entire country‚Äîwhen its signal began to be beamed via the Satcom 1 satellite to four cable systems in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States: Multi- Vue TV in Grand Island, Nebraska; Hampton Roads Cablevision in Newport News, Virginia; Troy Cablevision in Troy, Alabama, and Newton Cable TV in Newton, Kansas. At that moment, approximately 24,000 additional households began receiving the WTCG signal. The station's first national broadcast was the 1948 Dana Andrews‚ÄìCesar Romero film Deep Waters, which had been in progress for 30 minutes on channel 17 in Atlanta. With this move, WTCG would become one of the first television stations, and only the second U.S. broadcaster‚Äîafter HBO‚Äîto be transmitted via satellite, instead of the then-standard method of using microwave relay to distribute a programming feed. Turner's decision to turn his television station into a national programming service was an expensive gamble on his part, given that he spent about $6 million of the $14 million that the station made in annual gross revenue at the time on satellite transmission. SSS initially charged prospective cable systems 10¬¢ per subscriber to transmit the WTCG signal as a 24-hour channel and 2¬¢ per subscriber to carry it as a part- time, overnight-only service (with the intent of acting as a timeshare feed on a cable channel otherwise occupied by a local or out-of-market broadcast station during their normal sign-off period). Instantly, WTCG went from being a small independent television station that regularly placed near the bottom of the ratings among Atlanta's television stations well into the 1970s and was available only in Georgia and neighboring states to a major coast-to-coast operation, pioneering the distribution of broadcast television stations via satellite transmission to pay television subscribers nationwide. Ted Turner's innovation set a precedent for today's basic cable television and signaled the start of the revolution of basic cable programming in the United States. Soon after, an increasing number of cable television providers throughout the United States sought to carry WTCG on their systems. Within three years of WTCG achieving national status, the signals of fellow independent stations WOR-TV (now MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV) in New York City and WGN-TV in Chicago were also uplinked to satellite for distribution as national superstations; eventually, other independents such as KTVT (now a CBS owned-and-operated station) in Dallas, KTVU (now a Fox owned-and-operated station) in San Francisco and KTLA (now a CW affiliate) in Los Angeles were uplinked to satellite as well, primarily being carried on a regional basis. The expansion of WTCG into a superstation would serve as the linchpin for what would later be renamed the Turner Broadcasting System to eventually launch or acquire other cable-originated channels in subsequent years, including the Cable News Network (CNN) (launched on June 1, 1980); HLN (launched as CNN2 on January 1, 1982, and later known as CNN Headline News from 1983 to 2007); Turner Network Television (TNT) (launched on October 3, 1988); Cartoon Network (launched on October 1, 1992); Turner Classic Movies (TCM) (launched on April 14, 1994); and TruTV (folded into Turner, as Court TV, following the closure of parent Time Warner's acquisition of Liberty Media's 50% interest in the channel in May 2006). Turner and station management treated WTCG as an \\"active\\" superstation, directly asserting national promotional responsibilities, investing in programming, and charging advertising rates at the national and local levels. This resulted in the station paying for syndicated programming at (albeit reasonably cheaper) rates comparable to other national networks, rather than merely receiving royalty payments from cable systems for programs to which it held the copyright as \\"passive\\" superstations‚Äîlike WGN and WWOR, which opted to take a neutral position on their national distribution and left national promotional duties to the satellite carriers that retransmitted their signals‚Äîdid. (Unlike WTCG, most other superstations had their signals redistributed without their owner's express permission under a provision in Section 111 of the Copyright Act of 1976, which allowed local cable systems to \\"retransmit copyrighted programming from any over-the-air stations across the country to their subscribers under a compulsory license\\".) WTCG initially was identified as \\"Channel 17\\" or \\"Super 17\\" both locally in Atlanta and on cable providers outside of that area; by 1979, the station identified primarily by its call letters locally and nationally. Over time, as WTCG was also beginning to gain traction in the Atlanta market, the station also began to gain traction nationally as more cable systems added the WTCG signal to their lineups; by 1978, WTCG was carried on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states, reaching over 2.3 million subscribers, a total that would substantially double each year into the next decade. Because it utilized a broadcast television station as the origination point for its programming, throughout its existence as a superstation, all programs on WTCG/WTBS‚Äîwhich transmitted exactly the same schedule nationally as that seen on the local Atlanta broadcast feed‚Äîwere broadcast on an Eastern Time schedule (with programs shown at earlier or, for those viewing in the Atlantic Time Zone in far eastern Canada and the Maritimes, later times depending on the location), resulting in programs being shown simultaneously in all six continental U.S. and all five Canadian time zones as they did in the Atlanta area on channel 17. (Promos for WTCG/WTBS programs referenced airtimes for both the Eastern and Central Time Zones until 1987, and the Eastern and Pacific time zones thereafter until 1992 and occasionally beforehand for certain scheduled live sports and event telecasts.) =Initial change to WTBS= In May 1979, Turner made a $25,000 donation to a group associated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to fund the construction of a new transmitter, in exchange for acquiring the WTBS call letters that had been assigned to the university's Cambridge-based student radio station for use on the channel 17 license; Turner also agreed to donate an additional $25,000 to the group if the FCC agreed to assign the WTBS calls to Turner Communications. (MIT subsequently changed the radio station's calls to WMBR.) On August 27, 1979, the Atlanta parent station changed its call letters to WTBS (for \\" _T_ urner _B_ roadcasting _S_ ystem\\", the name its parent company adopted in accordance with the callsign change). Concurrently, Turner began branding the station as \\"SuperStation WTBS\\"‚Äîthe prefix word was re-rendered in mixed case in October 1980, with both \\"S\\"s capitalized‚Äîwith occasional references within the logo to the channel 17 frequency in Atlanta. (Accordingly, many cable providers throughout the country even carried it on channel 17 during some part of its existence as a superstation.) However, the national feed continued to occasionally use the same on-air branding as the Atlanta area signal (which was referred to on-air at the time as \\"WTBS Channel 17\\") until October 1980. By 1981, the Atlanta station would be branded as \\"SuperStation 17\\"; on the national feed available outside of the Atlanta area, though, references to the station's over-the-air channel number were completely removed‚Äîoutside of minor technical issues where local ads and promos aired erroneously on the national feed. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, WTBS continued to acquire second-hand programming such as made-for-TV Popeye cartoons, The Brady Bunch, The Munsters, and other programs. The station acquired reruns of All in the Family and Sanford and Son in 1979, as well as Little House on the Prairie and CHiPs in 1981. Other older shows would eventually be removed from the schedule. WTCG also mixed more movie releases from the 1950s through the 1970s into its schedule. By July 1979, WTCG/WTBS was available to 1,000 cable systems throughout the United States, with a total of 4.8 million cable subscribers receiving the signal. In 1981, Turner decided to split the WTBS satellite feed from its terrestrial signal; under this structure, all of the shows seen on WTBS continued to air nationally over its superstation feed (in a move that preceded fellow superstations WGN-TV and WWOR-TV doing the same thing, though only after the FCC's re-implementation of the Syndication Exclusivity Rights rule in 1990). Although, separate national advertising or per inquiry ads replaced the local commercials intended for broadcast in the Atlanta area‚Äîwhich became exclusively carried by channel 17 locally‚Äîon the superstation feed. Former TBS logo, used from September 7, 1987 to September 5, 1994; the logo was accompanied by the \\"SuperStation\\" subtitle until that moniker was initially dropped from the channel on September 10, 1990. The 1980s also saw WTBS begin to venture into original programming; in 1980, the station premiered Tush, a late night sketch comedy and variety series hosted and developed by comedian Bill Tush (who had hosted newsbriefs and, occasionally, movie presentations for WTBS, in addition to serving as a staff announcer), with Jan Hooks (who would later gain fame during her stint as a cast member on Saturday Night Live). Starcade, a game show that ran from 1982 to 1983 (with a further run in syndication via Turner Program Services until 1984), where people competed to win their very own arcade cabinet by playing various games. Other programming efforts included The Catlins (a Dynasty-style prime time soap opera which ran for two seasons from 1983 to 1985), and sitcoms Down to Earth, Rocky Road and Safe at Home (all three of which formed a block of first-run comedy series aimed at a family audience). In addition, from 1986 through 1989, TBS also produced more than 70 original episodes of The New Leave It To Beaver, which it picked up after that series was canceled by The Disney Channel in 1985. (TBS's addition of The New Leave It To Beaver to its lineup also coincided with the original Leave it to Beaver airing in reruns on the channel, as Ted Turner felt that the former would make a good programming fit with the latter.) On September 7, 1987, the \\"W\\" from the \\"WTBS\\" callsign was dropped from the superstation's on-air branding‚Äîchanging its name to SuperStation TBS‚Äîin order to emphasize the channel's national programming prominence, with the WTBS Atlanta signal continuing to use the separate \\"SuperStation 17\\" branding. By 1987, SuperStation WTBS was available to 41.6 million households with a cable or satellite subscription nationwide; this total jumped to 49 million cable homes by the summer of 1988. On May 18, 1988, the FCC reinstated syndication exclusivity restrictions through the passage of a new version of the Syndication Exclusivity Rights Rule. This version granted cable systems and satellite carrier firms the ability to secure an agreement to air a claimed syndicated program with the claimant local rightsholder or a syndication distributor, effectively allowing for superstations to acquire national cable rights for syndicated programs (either directly or through their satellite carrier). In preparation for the new rules taking effect on January 1, 1990, Turner Broadcasting began to fill the WTBS schedule with additional programming‚Äîprimarily, off-network syndicated comedy and drama series (such as The Jeffersons and Good Times) as well as acquired film packages (consisting of both theatrical features and made-for-television films) and original programs (such as Jacques Cousteau specials, and National Audubon Society and National Geographic programs)‚Äîfor which it would hold exclusive cable rights in order to make the national feed \\"100% blackout-free.\\" Combined with the utilization of indemnification provisions designed to protect against monetary damages if a superstation has \\"a reasonable basis for concluding that[...] programing deletion is not required\\", this ensured that the TBS national feed would be absolved from potential blackouts necessitated by any local syndication exclusivity claims and, therefore, prevent defections by cable affiliates that indicated it would remove any distant signals rather than shoulder the expense of blacking out or substituting non-compliant programs. On September 28, 1989, the channel's name was changed to TBS SuperStation to reflect the strong national standing of the channel. Debuting concurrently with the name change was a promotional campaign utilizing the slogan \\"TBYes!\\", featuring various stars of programs seen on TBS‚Äîincluding, among others, Bob Denver and Alan Hale of Gilligan's Island (as their respective characters Gilligan and Captain Jonas Grumby aka \\"The Skipper\\"), Al Lewis of The Munsters (as his character Grandpa), Buddy Ebsen of The Beverly Hillbillies (as his character J.D. \\"Jed\\" Clampett) and Jimmie Walker of Good Times (appearing as himself)‚Äîwith graphical elements of fireworks and a large rotating glass pane, which could display the TBS logo, change to or from a slogan (depending on the promotional spot) to the logo, or be used to show the airtime of programs mentioned in a specific promotion or summarize the next three programs set to air. Title sequences for movies and special presentations‚Äîwhich were accompanied by music incorporating variants of the \\"TBYes\\" promotional theme's signature‚Äîshowed people in a main street setting flocking to a TBS-branded theater, which transitions to a panning shot stopping at a couch in the front row of the theater's seating area where either a family or a couple (depending on the daypart presentation, as identified at the end of the sequence) sit down in time for the start of the film. On September 10, 1990, the word \\"Superstation\\" was removed from the cable channel's on-air branding and promotions, rebranding it as simply \\"TBS\\", which had been used verbally in on- air promotions since the beginning of that year. By 1992, TBS was available in 58 million households with cable and satellite television service, accounting for more than half of all homes in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands‚Äîand carried by 14,815 cable systems throughout the country. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists library During the 1980s, WTBS focused heavily on movies‚Äîrunning two films during the day, and a largely movie-exclusive schedule during the nighttime hours after 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time (with exceptions made for scheduled sporting events, specials, original programs and, in the case of Sunday nights, off-network syndicated series and paid programming). At other times, mainly during the daytime hours each weekday and on weekend mornings, WTBS continued to run mostly classic sitcoms and vintage cartoons. In 1986, when Ted Turner purchased Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer/United Artists (which he would sell back to previous owner Kirk Kerkorian that October due to debt incurred by the Turner Broadcasting System from its purchase of the film studio), WTBS gained the rights to the entire MGM/UA film library (including certain acquisitions by MGM). It gave WTBS the rights to air many theatrical cartoon shorts such as Tom & Jerry, as well as shows like Gilligan's Island and CHiPs. Along with Tom & Jerry, WTBS began to run The Little Rascals, Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons released prior to August 1948, theatrical Popeye cartoon shorts, and Three Stooges shorts under the banner The TBS Tom & Jerry Funhouse running for either one hour or 90 minutes during the morning hours and for an hour (later, half-hour) in the afternoon from 1986 to 1995. In the late 1980s, WTBS decreased the number of movies broadcast during the day slightly and began to add sitcoms from the 1970s (such as Happy Days, The Jeffersons, Good Times and One Day at a Time) to the evening lineup; Little House on the Prairie aired during the late mornings continuously from 1986 to 2003. Other programming Music videos also aired during its late night lineup on weekends from 1983 to 1992 as part of the program Night Tracks, which aired in the form of two three- hour-long blocks (later reduced to two two-hour blocks in August 1989, and then to two 90-minute blocks in the spring of 1990), barring pre-emptions from sporting events that ran over their scheduled end-time. (The success of Night Tracks served as the basis for Turner to develop Cable Music Channel, a short- lived attempt at a competitor to MTV that operated for five weeks from October 26 to November 30, 1984.) Beginning in 1991, a handful of shows (mostly movies) that were shown nationally were pre-empted in the Atlanta market in order to broadcast FCC-mandated news, public affairs, and children's programming; this continued until the split of the TBS national feed from the Atlanta station in October 2007. In addition to offering conventional television programming over the main video-audio feed viewable to all multichannel television subscribers receiving the channel, Southern Satellite Systems transmitted two teletext services over the WTBS superstation feed's vertical blanking interval (VBI) that required a special decoder to receive the provided information services over the feed. SSS began transmitting the United Press International (UPI) teletext news service over the national feed's VBI signal in 1979. In 1981, SSS repurposed the VBI signal to transmit the Electra teletext service; Electra was transmitted over the VBI until the service was shut down in 1993 due to a lack of funding and interest. (The other partners in the venture, Zenith Electronics and Taft Broadcasting [formerly known as Taft Television & Radio Company during its earlier existence as both an electronics manufacturer and broadcaster] had respectively stopped manufacturing TV sets with teletext capability and had undergone several corporate buyouts.) In the early 1990s, shows such as The Flintstones, The Brady Bunch, Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons, Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies shorts, Gilligan's Island, and others remained on the schedule as other older shows such as The Three Stooges and Little Rascals shorts and Leave it to Beaver were dropped from the channel to make way for more sitcoms from the 1980s such as Three's Company, Who's the Boss?, Growing Pains, The Cosby Show, Family Ties, and Saved by the Bell. Original animated programs such as Captain Planet and the Planeteers, 2 Stupid Dogs and SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron were also added as part of the \\"Sunday Morning In Front of the TV\\" block. Following Turner's acquisition by Time Warner, among the programming changes instituted after the merger was the addition of Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons that were released after August 1, 1948, which began airing on TBS as well as sister channel Cartoon Network in January 1997. =Time Warner purchase; shift towards comedy= On September 22, 1995, Time Warner‚Äîa New York City-based media company formed in 1989 through the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Bros. corporate parent Warner Communications‚Äîreached an agreement to acquire the Turner Broadcasting System (TBS) and its associated properties (including TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, CNN and CNN Headline News as well as Turner Entertainment) for $7.5 billion; the deal would also expand Time Warner's pay television holdings, as it had owned HBO and sister premium service Cinemax as well as cable television provider Time Warner Cable since the Time-Warner Communications merger six years prior. (Time Warner and predecessor Warner Communications had owned an 18% interest in Turner Broadcasting since 1987, as part of a cable television industry- backed bailout of the company amid severe financial issues.) Under the terms, Turner would acquire an approximate 10% interest in Time Warner as well as oversee its subscription network group‚Äîcomprising the Turner and Home Box Office units and its minority interests in Comedy Central and E!‚Äîand hold a position on the company's board of directors (which he retained until he stepped down from the company in February 2006) upon the merger's closure. The merger received regulatory approval on September 12, 1996; the Turner‚ÄìTime Warner deal was finalized one month later on October 10, forming what at the time was the largest media company in the world. In September 1996, TBS replaced religious programs and infomercials that had aired on Sunday mornings and late nights with animated series and feature films, respectively, in those time slots. On December 17, 1996, when TBS celebrated its 20th anniversary as a national service, the channel reincorporated the \\"Superstation\\" moniker into its name, rebranding as \\"TBS Superstation\\" (this time with the second \\"s\\" rendered in lower case). (Promotions for the channel's programming beginning at this time until 2004 often verbally referred to the national feed only as \\"the Superstation\\", a moniker that had previously been used in certain on-air promotions on an alternating basis or in conjunction with the WTBS/TBS name from its national launch as a superstation in December 1976 until December 1989.) During this time, the network's look included a spiral/swirl shape (frequently positioned behind the TBS logo, presumably to depict the superstation's broadcast signal radiating outwards), as well as \\"Super\\"-branded blocks (such as Super Prime for prime time movie presentations, \\"Super TV\\" for weekday daytime films and series, and Super Weekend for film telecasts on Saturdays and Sundays). On December 17, 1997, Time Warner purchased Southern Satellite Systems from Liberty Media for $213 million in cash, as part of a purchase option that Time Warner chose to exercise on September 16. Time Warner held out on an option to acquire SSS through a common stock buyout and instead chose a cash payment citing the \\"strong overall financial performance of its businesses and its belief that its stock remains undervalued\\" in spite of price appreciation having been appreciated. The purchase gave Time Warner control over uplink responsibilities for TBS. On January 1, 1998, the TBS national feed‚Äîalthough continuing to operate as a superstation by technicality‚Äîbegan operating under the conventions of a basic cable channel. At that time, the Turner Broadcasting System began to collect subscriber fees (averaging 26¬¢ per subscriber per month) directly from cable and satellite providers that had previously paid a 30¬¢-per-month licensing fee to Southern Satellite Systems for access to the TBS signal and a 10¬¢-per-month copyright fee to a federal copyright tribunal (which, in turn, paid the fee directly to program distributors) for rights to carry its programming. The additional revenue was intended to be used for programming acquisitions, particularly rights to first-run theatrical films. In exchange, TBS began to lease two minutes of advertising time per hour to multichannel subscription television providers to allow them to locally insert commercials catering to viewers in the provider's service area; as a result, the channel began to broadcast fewer Atlanta Braves regular season games to a national audience, under amended contractual agreements between Turner and Major League Baseball in conjunction with the league's cable-originated rightsholders, ESPN and Fox Sports Net/Liberty Sports, to allow TBS to continue carrying Braves telecasts nationwide. In 1998, TBS Superstation‚Äîwhich continued to run a mix of movies, sitcoms and drama series‚Äîremoved all of its remaining cartoon shorts and animated series (which at the time were running under the Disaster Area banner), migrating those shows exclusively to Cartoon Network. (Many of these series also later became the core of a new channel devoted to classic cartoons, Boomerang, which launched in April 2000.) In 1999, TBS also refocused its original program offerings, removing documentaries and National Geographic specials‚Äîwhich were shifted over to CNN‚Äîin favor of carrying original made-for-TV movies and weekly series such as the reality show Ripley's Believe It or Not! and the short-lived comedy series The Chimp Channel (a series based on the \\"Monkey-ed Movies\\" series of interstitial shorts parodying recent and classic theatrical movies with chimpanzees, voiced by human actors, in the roles). By 2001, several sitcoms from the 1980s and 1990s such as Full House, Family Matters, The Cosby Show, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Friends, Seinfeld and Home Improvement became part of the channel's schedule; many of these shows aired as part of the \\"Non-Stop Comedy Block\\", a late-afternoon block of mostly adult-targeted comedy series that debuted in January 2002. Former TBS logo, used from June 4, 2004 until October 30, 2015. In September 2003, TBS dropped Little House on the Prairie and other dramatic programming as a part of a format shift toward comedic programs, such as sitcom reruns, original reality television series, and theatrically released comedy films. As part of this refocusing, the \\"Superstation\\" sub-brand was once again dropped in February 2004, with the channel reverting to being branded as simply TBS. Subsequently, on June 4, 2004, to signify the channel's new comedy programming focus, TBS introduced a new logo (designed by Publicis New York) that rendered the channel's name in lowercase and incorporated a half-circle made to resemble a mouth open as if it were laughing and adopted the slogan \\"veryfunny\\". The half-circle element took on a motif with half a baseball or basketball rendered within it for Turner Sports programming. The refocusing was intended to position its programming as a direct contrast to sister channel TNT, which had initially focused mainly around older movies and sports but moved toward and now focuses primarily on drama series and films. =Split from the Atlanta signal= In late June 2007, the Turner Broadcasting System announced that WTBS would change its callsign to WPCH-TV, and would be rebranded as \\"Peachtree TV\\". The rebranded channel 17 would offer sitcoms and movies geared specifically toward the station's Atlanta audience, and would also broadcast 45 Braves baseball games starting with the team's 2008 season. The change occurred on October 1, 2007 with the national feed becoming a separate cable/satellite channel that retained the TBS name. In addition, the channel 17 changeover allowed Atlanta-area cable and IPTV subscribers‚Äîincluding those of Comcast and Charter Communications‚Äîthat previously were only able to receive WTBS's local Atlanta signal to begin receiving the national TBS feed for the first time since the early 1980s. (Despite the separation of TBS and its former Atlanta parent station, some local television listings publications have continued to refer to the channel as an Atlanta station in their channel charts and/or by that station's former WTBS call letters in said charts and as an identifier in listings grids.) Following the change, Canadian subscription television providers were legally required to continue carrying the local Peachtree TV signal, instead of switching to the national TBS feed. Beginning with the 2008 season, TBS began airing Major League Baseball postseason games, with regular season baseball coverage expanding to include games from other MLB teams. In November 2009, TBS debuted its first late-night talk show, Lopez Tonight, hosted by comedian George Lopez. One year later, the channel expanded its late-night offerings with the November 8, 2010 debut of Conan, after TBS struck a deal to give Conan O'Brien a show on the channel on the heels of his controversial exit as host of NBC's The Tonight Show. Lopez Tonight ended its run on August 12, 2011, after it was cancelled due to a steep decline in ratings. In 2011, TBS also obtained a portion of the television rights to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship‚Äîwhich it shares with Turner- owned sister channels TNT and TruTV, along with the tournament's longtime over-the-air broadcaster, CBS. During the first quarter of 2012, TBS's viewership in the 18-49 adult demographic beat all other advertiser-supported channels, in spite of the fact that TBS did not air any original programs in prime time during that period nor had it aired a show among the 50 highest- rated cable programs. The channel's third late-night talk show, The Pete Holmes Show, debuted on October 28, 2013, hosted by comedian Pete Holmes (like Lopez Tonight, it could not capitalize on Conan as its lead-in and was cancelled in May 2014). On May 14, 2015, at the Turner Upfront presentation, president Kevin Reilly announced a major shift within the next few years for TBS and TNT. The expanded development slate would see TBS feature more original live-action comedies, original animated series, more late-night talk shows, and lots more of \\"big unscripted ideas with attitude\\". One of the first success stories out of this effort was the satirical news series Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, hosted by the former correspondent for Comedy Central's The Daily Show (which served as a basis for Full Frontals format). A new logo‚Äîwhich was previously revealed on social media 1¬Ω months prior on September 16‚Äîmade its official debut on the evening of October 31, 2015. The new idents, which feature the logo being formed into different shapes, objects, structures and surroundings (such as a gravestone, a flag on a submarine sandwich, and a monster eating the former logo, etc.) are all somewhat similar to the same idents and techniques used by MTV from the 1980s until the early 2000s and by VH1 during the early and mid-2000s (both of which are owned by ViacomCBS, not WarnerMedia). On April Fool's Day in 2017, the T in the logo was removed from the DOG, thus making the logo read \\"BS\\", for the entire broadcast day.Logopedia: Theme/April Fool's Day logos =AT&T; ownership= On October 22, 2016, AT&T; announced an offer to acquire Time Warner for $108.7 billion, including debt it would assume from the latter; the merger would bring Time Warner's various media properties, including TBS, under the same corporate umbrella as AT&T;'s telecommunications holdings, including satellite provider DirecTV. Time Warner shareholders approved the merger on February 15, 2017; however, on February 28, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency will not review the deal, leaving the review to the U.S. Department of Justice. The merger also resulted in the full separation of TBS from former parent station WPCH (this time by ownership) in an effort to expedite the AT&T;‚ÄìTime Warner merger, when on February 20, 2017, the Meredith Corporation‚Äîwhich had assumed operational responsibilities for WPCH from Turner/Time Warner in January 2011 to form a virtual duopoly with CBS affiliate WGCL-TV (channel 46)‚Äîannounced that it would acquire WPCH-TV's license assets from Turner for $70 million. (The sale of WPCH to Meredith received FCC approval on April 17, 2017, and was finalized four days later on April 21.) On November 20, 2017, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against AT&T; and Time Warner in an attempt to block the merger, citing antitrust concerns surrounding the transaction. The proposed merger‚Äîwhich had already been approved by the European Commission and Mexican, Chilean and Brazilian regulatory authorities‚Äîwas affirmed by court ruling on June 12, 2018, after District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ruled in favor of AT&T;, dismissing the DOJ's antitrust claims in the lawsuit. The merger closed two days later on June 14, with the company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T; under the renamed parent company WarnerMedia. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington unanimously upheld the lower court's ruling in favor of AT&T; on February 26, 2019. On March 4, 2019, AT&T; announced a major reorganization of its broadcasting assets, in which WarnerMedia's television properties would be divided among three divisions within the WarnerMedia umbrella. TBS, along with TNT, truTV and HBO would be reassigned to WarnerMedia Entertainment. The move would effectively dissolve the Turner Broadcasting System umbrella as part of a wind-down of the Turner name from the reorganized parent company's corporate structure. AT&T; did not specify any timetable for the changes to take effect, although WarnerMedia had begun to remove all Turner references in corporate communications and press releases, referring to that unit's networks as \\"divisions of WarnerMedia\\". High-definition feed A high definition feed of TBS, which broadcasts in 1080i, launched on September 1, 2007; an HD sub-feed of its Pacific Time Zone feed would be launched on June 18, 2010. Much like sister channels TNT and Cartoon Network, TBS airs a moderate amount of program content broadcast in 4:3 standard definition stretched to the 16:9 widescreen format through a non- linear process similar to the \\"panorama\\" setting on many HDTVs that some viewers have nicknamed Stretch-o-Vision after it was first used by TNT; though other HD simulcast feeds operated by pay channels have also adopted this practice. The non-linear stretching process leaves objects in the center of the screen with approximately their original aspect ratio; objects at the left and right edges are distorted (horizontal panning makes the distortion especially apparent). Programming TBS currently airs a mix of original sitcoms and reruns of sitcoms that were originally broadcast on the major broadcast networks. Original programs currently seen on TBS are American Dad! (which moved to TBS in 2014, after being cancelled by Fox), Conan, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, Final Space, The Misery Index, The Last O.G., and Miracle Workers. The channel's daytime schedule is heavily dominated by reruns of current and former network comedies, with these shows also airing in the evening and sporadically during the overnight hours. , these programs consist of Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Friends, Seinfeld, Everybody Loves Raymond, Family Matters, The Big Bang Theory, New Girl, 2 Broke Girls and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Most reruns shown on TBS are broadcast in a compressed format, with content sped up to accommodate additional time slots for advertising sales. =Turner Time= On June 29, 1981, TBS (as SuperStation WTBS) began to use a specialized program scheduling format known informally as \\"Turner Time.\\" While program offerings on other broadcast and cable channels generally began at the top and bottom (:00 and :30 minutes) of each hour, TBS decided to begin airing programs‚Äîmainly original and off-network series, certain movies that followed blocks of series or maintained end times that did not fall within the half- hour, and sporting events‚Äîfive minutes later, at :05 and :35 minutes past the hour. Programs seen on TBS were listed under their own time entry in TV Guide (which, upon its inclusion‚Äîstarting as early as 1980‚Äîin the magazine's listings section in all editions outside the Atlanta market, was designated under the alphanumeric \\"17A\\" identifier, before switching to the \\"TBS\\" identifier by 1987), during the period in which the magazine published log listings, as a result of this scheduling, thus enabling the program listings to catch potential viewers' eyes more readily. (Newspaper-published television listings magazines varied in how they listed TBS programs scheduled under the \\"Turner Time\\" structure, with some that listed programs in a time-prioritized \\"log\\" format initially continuing to lump the channel's shows with other programs with top- and bottom-of-the-hour start times for some period of time afterward.) The use of \\"Turner Time\\" also encouraged channel surfers who could not find anything interesting to watch at the top of the hour to still be able to watch a program on TBS without missing the first few minutes. Most importantly, since shows ended five minutes later than normal, from a strategic standpoint the off-time scheduling usually encouraged viewers to continue watching TBS rather than turning to another channel to watch a program that would already be airing in progress. (By 1991, the major three American networks also adopted the :05/:35 scheduling in a much more limited form for their late night programming schedules, mainly to allow their affiliates to have additional ad inventory out of their local newscasts; this continues to the present day.) TBS reduced its use of the \\"Turner Time\\" scheduling in 1997 and switched entirely to conventional start times at the top and bottom of the hour by 2000; by this point, log listings were being phased out in favor of a grid-based layout (TV Guide would eliminate logs completely in 2005), eliminating one of Turner Time's strategic advantages. However, the channel continues to use unconventional start times for its movie presentations‚Äîwhich vary in their running times depending on the film's length with commercials added to pad the timeslot (for example, a movie that starts at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and has an allotted airtime exceeding 125 minutes may cause subsequent programming to start within the half-hour, such as at :15 and :45 after the hour). This often causes major disruptions in the start times of programming, and in some circumstances, conventional \\"top-and-bottom\\" start times would not be restored until early the next morning. While this is not exactly related to the \\"Turner Time\\" format, it may strategically serve the same purposes due to the off-time scheduling. The \\"Turner Time\\" format is similar to the scheduling applied by most premium channels and certain other movie-oriented services (which often schedule the start of programs in variable five-minute increments); other broadcast and subscription television channels have utilized similar off-time scheduling formats (such as Telemundo‚Äîwhich utilizes a \\"Turner Time\\"-style scheduling for programs during the first two hours of prime time‚Äîand ViacomCBS-owned channels such as Nick at Nite, MTV and TV Land). =News programming= One type of programming that TBS does not produce presently is news. Nevertheless, TBS‚Äîduring its existence as a superstation‚Äîproduced a 20-minute-long satirical newscast, 17 Update Early in the Morning, from 1976 to 1979; hosted by Bill Tush and Tina Seldin, the program was taped at the end of the workday and aired between movies around 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Its format was similar to the Saturday Night Live news satire segment Weekend Update and was, to a certain extent, a forerunner to The Daily Show. The timeslot and the satirical content of the program were a reaction to FCC rules in effect at the time that required stations to carry some news and information content‚Äîalthough TBS had to broadcast news, the Federal Communications Commission could not dictate _when_ it aired or demand that it have a serious tone. 17 Update Early in the Morning was cancelled months before Ted Turner began his serious television news venture, CNN, amid a Congressional investigation concerning whether he was fulfilling FCC public service requirements. Standard, more serious news updates with the 17 Update anchors‚Äîat first simply known as WTCG (News) Update, and later under the title NewsWatch‚Äîalso ran during the day in-between programs. Upon its launch in January 1982, CNN2 (later Headline News, now HLN) assumed production responsibilities for the TBS NewsWatch segments, which began to be presented by that network's anchors and were split into several topic-specific segments (under the titles BusinessWatch for financial news, SportsWatch for sports news and FashionWatch for news on current and emerging fashion trends). On July 20, 1980, CNN began producing an hour-long weeknight news program for WTBS, the TBS Evening News, which usually ran at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (varying depending on the length of the movie or sports presentation that preceded it). Owing to WTBS's national superstation status, rather than focusing on local news as prime time newscasts that aired on other independent stations had been doing (including those distributed as regional or national superstations), the program‚Äîwhich was originally anchored by David Jensen (who previously served as a host for BBC Radio 1, where he would rejoin less than a year after the program launched), Kevin Christopher and meteorologist Dallas Raines‚Äîfocused on national and international news headlines as well as national weather forecasts and sports headlines. The TBS Evening News was discontinued after four years as a result of low ratings due to the frequent programming delays, with the program ending after the June 29, 1984, broadcast; the program was relaunched on CNN as the CNN Evening News on July 2, 1984. In addition, on July 31, 1980, WTBS also carried a 24-hour simulcast of CNN in place of its regular programming schedule; the simulcast was intended to help encourage subscriber demand to force cable and C-band satellite providers to begin carrying the news channel. When the channel launched on January 1, 1982, WTBS also carried simulcasts of CNN's sister channel CNN2. The channel's launch was simulcast nationwide on WTBS as well as CNN starting at 11:45 p.m. on December 31, 1981, as a preview for cable and C-band providers throughout the U.S. that had not yet reached agreements to carry CNN2. Thereafter, initially to encourage viewers to ask for the network full-time, the station also ran a half-hour simulcast of CNN2/Headline News each morning at 6:00 a.m. in the Atlanta market and at 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time in the rest of the country. Abbreviated editions of Headline News would also be run as filler after the end of movie presentations and before the start of live sports telecasts on occasions. The Headline News simulcasts as well as the TBS NewsWatch segments were eventually phased out locally and nationally in 1996 following the relaxation of the FCC's public affairs programming requirements. (As WPCH-TV, the Atlanta station ran an hour-long simulcast block of HLN's Morning Express daily at 6:00 a.m. until the 2017 sale to Meredith, when it was replaced by a simulcast of WGCL's morning newscast.) On September 11, 2001, TBS (along with sister channels TNT, Court TV, Headline News and the now-defunct CNNfn and CNNSI) carried CNN's coverage of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. During sports blackouts in some areas (particularly in markets where a channel such as a local broadcast station or regional sports network has the regional or local broadcast rights to a particular sporting event that is scheduled to air elsewhere around the country on TBS), TBS carries rolling news coverage from HLN in its place. =Movies= Feature films have been a mainstay of TBS since its inception as a superstation, although the number of films featured on the channel's weekly schedule‚Äîwhich prior to that point, encompassed one to two films during the daytime and up to five at night on weekdays, and between eight and twelve features per day each weekend‚Äîhas substantially declined since its 2007 conversion into a cable-exclusive channel. In the present day, most of the films seen on TBS are of the comedy genre; however, some drama and action films continue to air on the channel periodically; movies on the channel generally air during the overnight hours on a daily basis and during much of the day on weekends (except from between 5:00 to 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturdays and 5:00 to 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday mornings‚Äîwith the start time subject to variation‚Äîdue to sitcom blocks that typically air in those timeslots); this is in stark contrast to its existence as a superstation, when movies also filled late morning, early afternoon and prime time slots on weekdays. TBS broadcasts movies from sister companies Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema, along with films produced by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Lionsgate, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal Pictures, and Paramount Pictures. Between the late 1990s and the early 2010s, TBS had frequently aired its prime time movies interspersed with other content and commentary (for example, Dinner and a Movie included cooking segments, while Movie and a Makeover featured fashion content); these wraparound segments later moved to weekend afternoon film presentations, before being dropped entirely by 2011. Since December 1997, TBS has broadcast the 1983 film A Christmas Story in a 24-hour marathon from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, which has also run simultaneously (albeit at a later time) on sister channel TNT annually since 2011. Once each weekend, TBS airs a movie in prime time with limited commercial interruption, branded in promo advertisements under the title \\"More Movies, Less Commercials\\" (sister channel TNT also runs a prime time movie each weekend, that is telecast with limited commercial interruption). =Sports programming= Baseball Coverage of the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team‚Äîwhich was formerly owned by Ted Turner from 1976 until the 1996 acquisition of Turner Broadcasting by Time Warner‚Äîwas perhaps TBS's signature program, mainly due to its viewer popularity in Georgia and neighboring states. Turner acquired the local television rights to the Braves for WTCG in July 1972, effective with the team's 1973 season, assuming the contract from then-NBC affiliate WSB-TV, which had carried the franchise's games since the Braves relocated from Milwaukee in 1966. Turner's contractual agreement with the team reversed the standard of MLB franchises designating originating stations, arranging their own regional carrier networks and handling advertising sales for their game telecasts. It was also particularly striking given that WTCG had experienced major profit losses ever since Ted Turner assumed ownership of the station from Rice Broadcasting in 1970; WTCG had only then started to break even in revenue and was just beginning to become more competitive with the Atlanta market's other television stations in terms of viewership. Channel 17's Braves telecasts began airing nationally at the start of the 1977 season, after Turner and Southern Satellite Systems uplinked the station's signal via satellite. As WTCG reached a significant cable penetration rate throughout the Southern U.S. during 1978 and 1979, Turner ceased syndicating the team's game broadcasts and relegated those telecasts to the WTCG/WTBS cable feed, making the Braves the first team that did not provide live game coverage to broadcast stations outside of those within the team's home market. Turner once famously tried to get Andy Messersmith to use his #17 jersey to promote Superstation WTBS in its early years (the back of the jersey read, \\"CHANNEL 17\\"). The MLB organization immediately stopped Turner from proceeding with this plan due to league regulations barring team jerseys from incorporating advertising other than that of the jersey's manufacturer. WTBS's broadcasts of Braves games helped expand the team's fanbase well outside of the Southern United States and earned them national prominence as \\"America's Team\\", even as the franchise's performance ranged from amiable to poor for much of the late 1970s and the 1980s. Some sportswriters even posited how such an awful team could have such broad availability via cable television, as with a 1990 Los Angeles Times column in which sportswriter Mike Downey jocularly lamented that TBS was short for \\"These Braves Stink.\\" (During the aforementioned period, the team's only postseason appearance was in 1982 and only three seasons, 1980, 1982 and 1983, had the Braves achieve a scoring average above .500.) At the 2006 MLB All-Star Game, it was announced that TBS would begin carrying a television package that includes all major league teams beginning with the 2007 season. TBS began carrying all Division Series games and one of the two League Championship Series (assuming the rights from Fox and ESPN) as well as the announcements of the All-Star teams and any possible games to determine division winners and wild card teams (those were also carried previously on ESPN). In 2008, TBS began airing MLB regular season Sunday games, with the provision that no team may appear on the telecasts more than 13 times during the season. During the 2007 transitional year, TBS aired 70 regular-season Braves games. In 2008, the number of Braves telecasts was reduced to only 45 games, with TBS's former Atlanta feed, WPCH-TV solely carrying the telecasts; Turner syndicated the package to other television stations and local origination cable channels for broadcast in the remainder of the Braves' designated market area. The final Braves game to be broadcast on TBS aired on September 30, 2007, with the first divisional playoff game airing the following day on October 1, 2007 (when the TBS/WPCH split occurred). On October 18, 2008, a technical problem at the channel's master control facility in Atlanta prevented TBS from showing the first inning of Game 6 of the American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays; the channel aired a rerun episode of The Steve Harvey Show instead. National Basketball Association In October 1972, WTCG obtained the broadcast rights to broadcast NBA games involving the Atlanta Hawks (which was also owned by Ted Turner at the time) under a ten- year agreement. WTCG/WTBS and its superstation feed aired an average of 55 Hawks regular season games per season. TBS aired the games nationwide until the telecasts became subjected to NBA blackout restrictions within of the home team's arena, resulting in many Hawks away games televised by the TBS national feed being unavailable to cable providers within the designated market area of the opposing team. (This restriction was dropped when TNT gained the right to be the exclusive broadcaster of any game that it chose to carry, although it was still subjected to league restrictions first imposed in 1982 that limited the number of games that could air per season on national and regional superstations.) In the spring of 1984, WTBS reached an agreement with the NBA to broadcast games from league teams other than the Hawks beginning with the 1984‚Äì85 season; under the deal, WTBS/TBS maintained a package of approximately 55 regular season NBA games annually, with games airing on Tuesday and Friday nights. From 1985 until 1989, WTBS/TBS also televised anywhere from 12 to 20 early round conference playoff games beginning with the 1985 NBA Playoffs as well as the NBA Draft. Under a joint broadcast contract signed between Turner Broadcasting and the NBA in the summer of 1987, the rights to NBA telecasts began to be split between TBS and upstart sister network TNT beginning with the league's 1988-89 season, with TNT assuming rights to the NBA Draft and most NBA regular season and playoff games and TBS's NBA telecasts being relegated to a single game or a double-headers one night per week. In 2001, Turner Sports signed a new television contract with the NBA, in which TNT would become Turner Broadcasting's exclusive rightsholder of NBA telecasts beginning with the 2002‚Äì03 season. (ESPN assumed TBS's portion of the league's pay television contract.) Professional wrestling Professional wrestling aired on WTCG/WTBS from 1971 to 2001 under several different wrestling promotions. In 1971, the station served as the flagship outlet for the Jim Barnett-owned Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW), acquiring the local rights to the program from WQXI-TV (now WXIA); the program concurrently began to be recorded in a soundstage at the channel 17's now-former West Peachtree Street studios in Midtown Atlanta. When WTBS became a national superstation in 1976, Georgia Championship Wrestling became the first National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) promotion to maintain a nationally televised broadcast, a move which made many of the NWA's regional promoters unhappy; however, Barnett allayed any issues citing that he was only using Georgia- based wrestlers. In July 1984, GCW and the promotion's television timeslot rights were acquired by the Vince McMahon-owned World Wrestling Federation (WWF; now the WWE). The replacement show, WWF World Championship Wrestling (later retitled WWF Georgia Championship Wrestling in March 1985), mainly served as a recap of matches that had previously aired on the WWF's main programms, which angered Ted Turner, who hoped that the WWF would hold first- run matches originating from the WTBS studios. The WWF iteration of the show received much lower viewership than its predecessor; this led McMahon to sell the promotion's Saturday night time slot to Jim Crockett Promotions (owned by Charlotte-based wrestling promoter Jim Crockett, Jr.), who assumed production responsibilities for the wrestling program and utilized the same set. (Crockett's program relocated to a new arena soundstage at the CNN Center in 1988.) In 1985, Turner acquired the television rights to Mid-South Wrestling (owned by Shreveport-based promoter Bill Watts) as a WWF alternative program. Although Mid-South quickly became the highest-rated program on WTBS, Watts lost out on acquiring the two-hour Saturday timeslot occupied by the WWF, when Barnett helped broker a deal that allowed Crockett to buy the slot from McMahon and become the superstation's exclusive wrestling promotion. Through the early 1990s, the wrestling programs and Braves baseball were among pay television's highest-rated offerings, due to heavy viewership in the Southeast. In November 1988, TBS became the television home of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which Turner acquired from Jim Crockett Promotions; from 1992 to 2000, it carried the weekly show, WCW Saturday Night, which served as the WCW's flagship program prior to the launch of Monday Nitro on sister channel TNT in 1995. Another WCW show, WCW Thunder, debuted in 1998 on Thursday nights; the program was moved to Wednesdays in 2000, before it was cancelled in 2001 when TBS executive Jamie Kellner determined that wrestling did not fit the demographics of either TBS or TNT and would not be favorable enough to get the \\"right\\" advertisers to buy airtime‚Äîeven though Thunder was the highest-rated show on the channel at the time. College basketball In 2011, TBS obtained the television rights to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, with broadcast rights shared with CBS, and fellow Turner properties TNT and TruTV. TBS and the other two Turner-owned networks presently broadcast games played in the second and third rounds of the tournament, with TBS alternating coverage with CBS for the Regional Semifinals (Sweet Sixteen). In 2014 and 2015, TBS and CBS split coverage of the Regional Finals (Elite Eight), with TBS gaining the two Saturday evening games and CBS retaining the two Sunday afternoon games. Also in 2014 and 2015, TBS covered the National Semifinals (Final Four). In 2016, TBS televised the Final Four and the National Championship Game, beginning an alternating agreement with CBS through 2024. In even-numbered years, TBS now broadcasts the final three games, and in odd-numbered years, CBS televises the games. College football In 1981, WTBS acquired the cable television rights to broadcast college football games under a special \\"supplemental\\" television contract with the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) beginning with the 1981 season, limited to games which had already not been distributed for national broadcast by other networks. Beginning with the 1982 season, under a $17.6-million deal reached between the NCAA and Turner on January 27 of that year, consisting of live Division I-AA games on Thursday nights and Division I-A games on Saturdays during the fall. With this, its national superstation feed became the first cable channel to broadcast live college football games nationwide. Beginning in 1984, WTBS's college football coverage shifted to primarily focus on games involving teams in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). WTBS/TBS discontinued its college football contract after the 1992 season. WTBS/TBS resumed college football coverage in 2002 through a sub-licensing agreement with Fox Sports, which allowed the Atlanta station and superstation feed to carry college football games involving teams in the Big 12 and Pac-10 conferences, to which Fox Sports held the national cable television rights; the network usually aired two games per week during the first four seasons of the contract, reduced to a single weekly game during some weeks in the 2006 season. These rights were transferred exclusively to Fox Sports and its regional sports networks beginning with the 2007 season. NASCAR TBS first began carrying NASCAR Winston Cup in 1983, when it acquired the rights to the Winston Western 500 (which was carried annually until 1987). It also broadcast the Richmond 400 spring race (later renamed the Miller High Life 400 and then the Pontiac Excitement 400) from 1983 to 1995, the Atlanta Journal 500 from 1983 to 1985, and the Nationwise 500 (later renamed the AC Delco 500) from 1985 to 1987. For most of the 1990s, the only Winston Cup Series races aired on TBS were the two races held at Lowe's Motor Speedway (Coca-Cola 600 from 1988 to 2000, UAW-GM Quality 500 from 1989 to 2000) as well as the Miller Genuine Draft 500 (later the Miller 500 and then the Pennsylvania 500) each July from 1993 to 2000. (TBS did not have rights to The Winston, which usually aired on TNN.) TBS was also the home of the post-season exhibition races held at Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi in Japan from 1996 to 1998. Select Winston Cup, Busch Series and Craftsman Truck Series races aired on TBS until the 2000 season. NASCAR events moved to TNT in 2001 as part of a deal between the organization, NBC and TNT, although the initial plans were for TBS to carry the races. Instead, Turner Broadcasting decided that the NASCAR telecasts would better fit TNT's \\"We Know Drama\\" image campaign. Beach volleyball As part of a multi-year deal with Turner Sports, the NCAA Beach Volleyball Championship was televised by TBS in 2016 and 2017. NHL WTCG Aired NHL games of The Atlanta Flames from 1977 to 1980. eSports On September 23, 2015, Turner Broadcasting announced that plans to launch a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive eSports league beginning in 2016. There is also the possibility of other video games being added in future seasons. Availability TBS is available on multichannel television providers (including cable, satellite and select over-the-top providers) throughout the entire United States. Until October 1, 2007, the national TBS feed could not be viewed within its home market in the Atlanta metropolitan area, due to the over-the-air presence of WTBS (channel 17), which carried a nearly identical schedule, with the only differing programming being children's programs that meet the FCC's educational programming guidelines and public affairs programming. The operations of WTBS and TBS Superstation were separated in October 2007, with the free-to-air Atlanta station becoming WPCH-TV, a general entertainment independent station focused solely on the Atlanta area. The national TBS feed became available to pay-television subscribers within channel 17's viewing area as a result. In April 1985, the Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted authorization for the WTBS Atlanta feed and three other American superstations (WGN-TV, WOR-TV and WPIX in New York City) to be distributed to multichannel television providers within Canada. Under CRTC linkage rules first implemented in 1983 that include requirements for providers to offer U.S.-based program services in discretionary tiers tied to Canadian services, TBS and other authorized U.S. superstations typically have been received mainly through a subscription to a domestic premium service‚Äîsuch as First Choice (later The Movie Network and now Crave), Moviepix (later The Movie Network Encore and now Starz), Super Channel, Super √âcran, Movie Central (the original user of the Superchannel name, now defunct) and Encore Avenue (also now defunct)‚Äîalthough, beginning in 1997, many cable and satellite providers moved TBS to a basic specialty tier under a related rule that allows for one superstation of the provider's choice to be carried on a non-premium tier. Because the CRTC had only approved the Atlanta station's broadcast signal for distribution to cable, satellite and other domestic subscription television providers, following the separation of TBS and WTBS/WPCH in October 2007, Canadian subscribers continued to receive the re-called WPCH-TV, instead of the national TBS channel. As they are not shown on WPCH, most of TBS's flagship programs‚Äîsuch as Major League Baseball (both regular season and postseason games) and original series (such as Conan)‚Äîare carried on other Canadian specialty channels.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as WPB-82320 when commissioned and acquired the name Point Kennedy in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .Coast Guard Historian websiteScheina, p 72 Construction and design details Point Kennedy was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.Scheina, p 71 She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full.Scheina, p 71 Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.Scotti, p 165 The design specifications for Point Kennedy included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room.Scotti, p 165 Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.Scotti, p 165 The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.Scotti, p 166 Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.Scotti, p 166 The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.Scotti, p 166 Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.Scheina, p 72Scotti, p 10Scotti, p 219 History After delivery in 1961, Point Kennedy was assigned a homeport of San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters.Larzelere, p 72Cutler, p 84 While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Kennedy was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single- sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over- under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.Larzelere, p 21Cutler, p 82 For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Larzelere, p 15 Point Kennedy was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Naval Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and .Kelley, p 5‚Äì95 After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Cat Lo on 19 February 1966 in the company of , their temporary support ship.

He played an essential role in the institutionalization of unionism in Trinidad and was an early proponent of Trinidadian independence. Personal life Quintin O‚ÄôConnor was born on 31 October 1908 in Port of Spain to Virginia and Henry O‚ÄôConnor. Virginia was a homemaker and Henry was the manager of a firm of cocoa merchants. They had five children besides Quintin: Lucy, Phillip, Juan, Patrick and Willie. Along with his brothers, Quintin was among a small number of young men in Trinidad whose families could afford to provide them with a secondary education. He attended school at Saint Mary‚Äôs College, though he left school without obtaining the Junior Cambridge Certificate. O'Connor married Lucy Daphne Piper on 31 July 1943. During their fifteen-year marriage, they had four children. Union career O'Connor, as a member of the Clerks' section of the Trinidad Labour Party (TLP), attempted on numerous occasions prior to the riots of 1937 to pass a motion permitting his union to register under the Trade Union Ordinance of 1933, but each and every motion was defeated. He was opposed within the party by TLP leader A. A. Cipriani, who, in addition to believing that the 1933 Ordinance did not provide sufficient protection to union organizers, preferred agitation for political reform within the colony's Legislative Council to union activities, such as strikes and street protests. Following the riots, however, O'Connor led a group of clerks who broke from the TLP to form the Union of Shop Assistants and Clerks (USAC), which was officially registered on 30 August 1938. In 1939, O'Connor and other leaders of the USAC, organized the mainly female workers at the Renown shirt factory and won for them a 12.5 percent wage increase, and an eight-hour workday among other concessions. In 1940, O'Connor incorporated the USAC into the Federated Workers Trade Union (FWTU), which he took over with Albert Gomes. Though originally intent on exclusively organizing clerks, O'Connor and Gomes met with little success and decided to turn the FWTU into an omnibus union. They regularly received advice from the British Trade Union Congress (TUC). When the United States established a naval base in the Chaguaramas area, they secretly organized the base workers and eventually won recognition as the bargaining agents for the base employees. They also organized many government workers. In 1946, on behalf of government workers, they signed the FWTU's first collective bargaining agreement. This agreement was historic because, for the first time in Trinidad's history, wage increases were linked to increases in the cost of living index. In addition, the agreement was a sign from the government to other employers that collective bargaining was to become a normal part of labour relations in Trinidad.Ramdin, From Chattel Slave to Wage Earner (1982), p. 159. In 1948, O‚ÄôConnor became the secretary of the Trinidad and Tobago Trades Union Congress (TTTUC), which briefly united the labour movement in Trinidad and Tobago and was able to enter into block agreements with employers. However, the TTTUC split up shortly after over the issue of international affiliation with the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). As a result of O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs support for the WFTU, as well as his activities in the Caribbean Labour Congress (CLC), an organization dedicated to the independence of British Caribbean colonies and the spread of socialism, O‚ÄôConnor was put on a list of leftists banned from traveling throughout the English-speaking Caribbean. Political career and activism During the 1930s and '40s, O'Connor associated with a small group of left-leaning Trinidadian writers and thinkers, including Alfred Mendes, Albert Gomes, CLR James, and Ralph de Boissi√®re among others. In the 1940s, O'Connor joined New Dawn, a Marxist group dedicated to Trinidadian independence. He also \\"godfathered\\" the Why Not Discussion Group, which regularly denounced British colonial policy and became a \\"focal point for dissent.\\" In 1942, O‚ÄôConnor joined the West Indian National Party, which became a part of the United Front during the 1946 General Elections. During these elections, O‚ÄôConnor campaigned on behalf of Gomes, who won a seat on the Legislative Council with over 65% of the vote. In the late 1940s, O‚ÄôConnor broke with Gomes, who as a member of the Trinidad‚Äôs Executive Council abandoned his pro-union sympathies and left-wing politics. In the elections of 1950, O‚ÄôConnor ran for a seat in the Legislative Council under the banner of the TTTUC, but lost with just over 30% of the vote. In April 1951, he was one of the founding members of the West Indian Independence Party (WIIP). Because of its left-wing views, the WIIP was investigated by a British Commission led by Fred Dalley of the British TUC. The Commission claimed that WIIP was \\"communist-inspired and directed\\" and put pressure on O‚ÄôConnor and others to quit the party. O‚ÄôConnor refused to quit until he was ready to move on to other political endeavours. As a member of the Caribbean National Labour Party (CNLP), he contested a seat in Port of Spain North East, but lost with just under 9% of the vote. O‚ÄôConnor was also active on behalf of a number of social and political causes throughout his life. In 1941, he submitted a memorandum to the Franchise Committee in favour of universal adult suffrage. In 1946, he spoke out against restrictions which banned panmen from playing their instruments in public places. He also spoke out against the racism experienced by Blacks who worked on the US Naval Base in Chaguaramas. During the war, O‚ÄôConnor successfully opposed the introduction of a Sedition Bill, which would have curtailed civil liberties for the duration of the war. In 1948, O'Connor sat on the Constitutional Reform Committee and signed the majority report, which reformed Trinidad and Tobago's political system without granting responsible government. However, at a CLC conference, he later withdrew his signature and supported a resolution in favour of Patrick Solomon's minority report that demanded immediate self-government. Death O‚ÄôConnor died from a stroke on 3 November 1958. The casket containing his body was followed by a large procession through the streets of Port of Spain en route to Lapeyrouse cemetery. Once at the cemetery, people stood graveside and gave panegyrics in his honour. Having observed the tributes paid to O‚ÄôConnor at his funeral, then editor of The Nation and leading Caribbean intellectual C. L. R. James called for recognition of O‚ÄôConnor as a great West Indian. Honours and legacy In 1973, the government of Trinidad and Tobago posthumously awarded O‚ÄôConnor the Chaconia Medal ‚ÄúFor Long and Meritorious Service to Trinidad and Tobago‚Äù for his role in the birth and growth of the trade union movement. In 1985, the government honoured his memory by issuing a stamp featuring his image as part of a series of stamps depicting great Trinidadian labour leaders. The Oilfields Workers' Trade Union‚Äôs library is named in honour of him.

The union was instrumental in the development of the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, seen today as a key development in the Australian labour movement. Together with other unions the Queensland Shearers Union was the genesis of the Australian Workers' Union. Origin In 1886, the shearers began to organise themselves, following a strike that had started at Wellshot Station and spread to surrounding properties. The Queensland Shearers Union was formed at Blackall in 1887. By 1890, the union represented almost three thousand workers, and 3,721 were registered by the end of the year. Strike camps were formed when no landowner in the area was willing to accept the workers on their conditions. The following year saw the landowners or pastoralists join forces to fight the new unionism. By this time the Queensland Shearers Union had tens of thousands of members and at a conference they declared that union members were not to work alongside non-union workers. In response, pastoralists organised to form the United Pastoralists Association of Queensland in December 1890. Conflict between the two groups, which also involved police, squatters and soldiers, arose at many towns across Queensland. Initially other unions did not support the Queensland shearers and the strike was not successful. The union had a victory in 1890 when, together with wharf labourers and members of the British Seamen's Union, they successfully blockaded the transport of wool bales in Brisbane. The union was displeased with the engagement of non-unionist labour at Jondaryan. Strike A strikers' library, 1891 At conferences in late 1890 in Sydney and Melbourne, the pastoralists agreed to lower wages, extend work hours and retain the right to withhold wages until the end of the season. These conditions were first enforced in Queensland by the United Pastoralists Association with unionists rejecting them. The first strike camp of 1891 Australian shearers' strike was set up at Clermont in Central Queensland on 6 January 1891. Shearers and workers at stations affiliated with the United Pastoralists Association also rejected the new conditions and formed more camps. Together with the Central Queensland Carriers Union and the Central Queensland Labourers' Union, the Queensland Shearers Union called for a strike. They organised meetings, processions and protests. After a general call-out to members of other unions in March 1891, arrests were made and in the following months many strike leaders were convicted of conspiracy. Almost all of the executive members of the Queensland Shearers Union were imprisoned. A number of those who were jailed later went on to become Members of Parliament. The most notable of those was Anderson Dawson who became Premier of Queensland in 1899. His premiership was a first for the Australian Labor Party as well as the first parliamentary socialist government anywhere in the world. Aftermath and legacy The Queensland Shearers Union joined with the Queensland Labourers' Union to form the Amalgamated Workers' Union in December 1891. The Amalgamated Workers' Union merged with the Australian Workers' Union and became the Queensland branch of the Australian Workers' Union fourteen years later.

The United States' counterpart to this was Operation Odyssey Dawn, the French counterpart was Op√©ration Harmattan and the British counterpart was Operation Ellamy. The no-fly zone was proposed during the Libyan Civil War to prevent government forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi from carrying out air attacks on anti-Gaddafi forces and civilians. The demonstrations in Libya were part of the larger Arab Spring movement that began in the country of Tunisia on 18 December 2010. When demonstrations began in Libya, the government of Muammar Gaddafi responded with systematic attacks by air and ground forces, and repression of the protesters. In a speech, Gaddafi promised to chase down the protesters and cleanse the country \\"house by house\\". Several countries prepared to take immediate military action at a conference in Paris on 19 March. The no-fly zone was enforced by NATO's Operation Unified Protector. NATO took sole command of all operations in Libya from 06:00 GMT on 31 March, which effectively ended the U.S. Operation Odyssey Dawn, as all U.S. operations were absorbed into NATO's Unified Protector. The Canadian contribution continued to fall under Operation Mobile, which ceased activities on 1 November 2011. Canadian Forces =Royal Canadian Navy= On 1 March, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that would deploy from Halifax on 2 March to take part in Canadian and international operations already under way in Libya. Charlottetown departed CFB Halifax, and joined the Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 on 14 March, and arrived on station on 17 March. HMCS Charlottetown is a under the command of Commander Craig Skjerpen with a crew of about 240 officers and sailors, and a CH-124 Sea King helicopter and air detachment. With the other ships of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1, HMCS Charlottetown was engaged in regional maritime security operations in the central Mediterranean Sea. On 18 August, took the place of HMCS Charlottetown for the remainder of the NATO mission in Libya. HMCS Charlottetown returned to Canada on 2 September. =Royal Canadian Air Force= Task Force Libeccio was the air detachment participating in the enforcement of the no-fly zone in Libya authorized by Resolution 1973, adopted by the U.N. Security Council on 17 March. The task force was named for the strong southwesterly wind that blows all year in the Mediterranean Sea. Task Force Libeccio comprised six CF-18 Hornet fighter aircraft, two Boeing CC-177 Globemasters, two CP-140 Auroras and about 200 Canadian Forces personnel, including aircrews and ground technicians from 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron at 3 Wing CFB Bagotville and 409 Tactical Fighter Squadron at 4 Wing CFB Cold Lake and other locations across Canada. The force also included two CC-150 Polaris air-to-air refuelling detachment from 437 Transport Squadron at 8 Wing Trenton, Ontario. Task Force Libeccio reached the region on 18 March.

Summary of action *21 March: Start of Operations Four CF-18 fighters and two CC-150 Polaris refuellers operating from Trapani-Birgi Airport flew their first mission in Libya on 21 March, acting as armed escorts to coalition jets conducting bombings. Canada expected to take part in bombings as soon as the following night. HMCS Charlottetown also began patrolling the waters north of Libya in order to help to enforce a NATO blockade of Libya. Defence Minister Peter MacKay stated that another six CF-18 fighter jets are on standby to deploy if needed. *22 March Two CF-18s again flew missions on Tuesday, 22 March. However they had to abandon their planned attack on a Gaddafi Libyan airfield as the high possibility of collateral damage was against the strict rules of engagement. For a second day a CC-150 tanker refuelled Canadian aircraft as well as other coalition aircraft. *23 March The third day marked the first time Canadian jets bombed Libya since the campaign began. This occurred as four CF-18s flew two missions against an ammunition depot in Misrata, dropping four 227 kg (500-pound) laser-guided bombs, and supported by two CC-150 Polaris tankers. In other developments, Commodore John Newton, of the Royal Canadian Navy stated that the crew of HMCS Charlottetown were prepared to conduct boarding operations and had been training for search and rescue of downed pilots. *24 March Two CF-18s flew two air interdiction patrols over Libyan airspace. A CC-150 Polaris took part of the operations providing fuel for Canadian and other coalition aircraft. Defence Minister Peter MacKay announced Canada would send two CP-140 Auroras to provide maritime surveillance in support of the United Nations arms embargo against Libya. The Canadian Forces deployed 80 personnel from 14 Wing Greenwood and 19 Wing Comox. *25 March Two CF-18s conducted one sortie and released several precision-guided munitions against electronic warfare sites near Misrata. Two CC-150 also took part of operation and refuelled both Canadian and coalition aircraft. HMCS Charlottetown patrolled the north of Libya and investigated a vessel in distress. *27 March A second ammunition depot, this time located south of Misrata, was destroyed in an operation by four CF-18s utilizing 227 kg (500-pound) laser-guided bombs; in addition CF-18s coordinated other attacks involving up to 20 other coalition aircraft. Enforcing the arms embargo a CP-140A Aurora flew the first Canadian Maritime Patrol mission. *29 March Two CF-18s help the rebels by attacking targets in Misrata. Canadian CP-140 Aurora surveillance aircraft began around this time, a psychological warfare operation over Libya using airborne leaflet propaganda and radio transmissions. The broadcast of propaganda messages over Libyan territory led to the Gaddafi regime trying to jam the transmissions via electronic warfare. *31 March From 08:00 EET, NATO took sole command of air operations over Libya under Operation Unified Protector, taking over from U.S. Africa Command. *21 April Pilots flew more than 100 missions over Libya since the beginning of Operation Mobile. During the past week they were deployed 38 times. They attacked armoured vehicles, ammunition depots, and mobile rocket launchers. *13 May was involved in a naval battle near the port city of Misrata. Charlettetown was conducting patrols at around 2 a.m. local time with other Allied warships when a number of fast, small boats launched an attack. No warships sustained any damage. This was the first time since the Korean War that a Canadian warship was involved in a naval battle. *19 May Canadian pilots participated in NATO air strikes that destroyed eight Libyan warships. HMCS Charlottetown also participated in the operation. *27 May Canadian pilots dropped 240 laser-guided bombs on Libyan targets since 31 March. *2 June On Monday morning, HMCS Charlottetown came under heavy fire. The Libyan army had deployed a dozen BM21 launch vehicles at the port city of Misrata and opened fire on the Canadian warship. Charlottetown did not return fire and did not sustain damage. *16 June During the preceding week throughout four days CF-18s destroyed armoured vehicles, field headquarters, ammunition depots and command-and-control structures with laser-guided bombs. During the same week, CF-18s were recalled to one target because the laser-targeting system on an allied jet failed. *10 July under the command of Commander Bradly Peats, with 225 crew members and a detachment from 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron, departed CFB Esquimalt en route to the Mediterranean Sea to relieve HMCS Charlottetown, which had been on station off the Libyan coast since March. *29 July Canadian CP-140 Aurora surveillance aircraft started a psychological warfare operation over Libya. The surveillance aircraft started broadcasting propaganda messages over Libyan territory while the Gaddafi regime has tried to jam the transmissions using electronic warfare. *18 August A change of command ceremony was held in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, where HMCS Vancouver officially relieved HMCS Charlottetown. The ceremony officially marked that Task Force Charlottetown became Task Force Vancouver, and the Task Force command was transferred from Commander Craig Skjerpen to Commander Bradley Peats. *1 November Operation Mobile officially ceased operations and began mission closure activities.

Artificial Intelligence based on Brian Aldiss' short story Super-Toys Last All Summer Long, first published in 1969. A CGI-driven science fiction film, initially conceived by Stanley Kubrick in the early 1970s, it revolves about a child- like android, played by Haley Joel Osment, uniquely programmed with the ability to love. A critical and commercial success, the film collected US$235.9 million at international box offices. The same year, Streep co-hosted the annual Nobel Peace Prize concert with Liam Neeson which was held in Oslo, Norway, on December 11, 2001, in honor of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate - the United Nations and Kofi Annan. And, after a stage absence of more than twenty years, she persuaded Mike Nichols to stage Anton Chekhov's popular play The Seagull at the open air Delacorte Theater in New York, playing actress Irina Nikolayevna Arkadina. Co-starring Kevin Kline, Marcia Gay Harden, Natalie Portman, and her eldest son Henry, the play received favorable reviews, with The New York Times remarking, \\"Two decades in front of movie cameras haven't diminished her capacity for looming large from a stage. Streep has drawn a portrait of comic ruthlessness and gentle understanding.\\" In Spike Jonze's 2002 comedy-drama Adaptation., Streep portrayed Susan Orlean, a real-life journalist whose book is to be adapted by screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, played by Nicolas Cage. Streep, who declared the screenplay one of \\"the most interesting and ambiguous scripts [...] in a long time\\", expressed dire interest in the role before being cast, and took a salary cut in recognition of the film's budget of US$19 million. Lauded by critics and viewers alike, the film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including a Best Supporting Actress nomination for Streep, who David Ansen of Newsweek felt had not \\"been this much fun to watch in years\\". While Adaptation. ended Streep's winning drought at the Golden Globes, when she - after thirteen nominations - was awarded her first trophy since 1982's Sophie's Choice in 2003, she received a second nomination by the Hollywood Foreign Press for her participation in another project that year: Stephen Daldry's The Hours (2002). In The Hours, featuring Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore, Streep played the role of Clarissa, a literary editor who is followed for one climactic day, during which she plans a party for her long-time friend and one-time lover, played by Ed Harris, who is wasting away from AIDS. Based on the 1999 novel of the same title by Michael Cunningham, the episodic film focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the 1925 novel Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf. Generally well-received, The Hours was praised for the performances of all three leading actresses, who shared a Silver Bear for Best Actress the following year. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone commented, \\"These three unimprovable actresses make The Hours a thing of beauty [...] Streep is a miracle worker, building a character in the space between words and worlds.\\" The film grossed US$108.8 million worldwide on a budget of US$25 million, the majority of which came from foreign markets. In 2003, Streep appeared uncredited as herself in the Farrelly brothers film Stuck on You, a comedy about conjoined twins, played by Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear, who wish to move to Hollywood to pursue a career as an actor. Streep, who filmed her part within three days, was required to perform a musical version of Bonnie & Clyde in the film. The same year, she reunited with Mike Nichols to star alongside Al Pacino, Emma Thompson, and Mary-Louise Parker in the HBO adaptation of Tony Kushner's six-hour play Angels in America, the story of two couples whose relationships dissolve amidst the backdrop of Reagan Era politics, the spreading AIDS epidemic, and a rapidly changing social and political climate. As done in the play, some of the actors played multiple parts in the mini-series, with Streep portraying three different characters: an Orthodox rabbi, a Mormon woman, and American communist Ethel Rosenberg. The mini-series became the most watched made-for-cable movie in 2003, and garnered 21 Emmy Award and five Golden Globe nominations, winning Streep one award each.

In 2004, Streep became the youngest woman to ever be awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award by the Board of Directors of the American Film Institute, which honors an individual for a lifetime contribution to enriching American culture through motion pictures and television. The same year, Streep appeared with Denzel Washington in Jonathan Demme's The Manchurian Candidate, a remake of the same-titled 1962 film based on the 1959 novel by Richard Condon. Streep, who did not know the original movie prior to filming, took over a role originated by Angela Lansbury, playing a U.S. senator and manipulative, ruthless mother of a vice-presidential candidate, played by Liev Schreiber. On her Golden Globe-nominated performance, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that, \\"no one can talk about the acting in The Manchurian Candidate without rhapsodizing about Streep. She's a pleasure to watch - and to marvel at - every second she's onscreen.\\" The thriller became a moderate box office success, grossing US$96 million worldwide on a budget of US$80 million. Also in 2004, Streep appeared alongside Jim Carrey and Timothy Spall in Brad Silberling's adaption Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Based on the first three novels in Snicket's popular children's book series, the black comedy tells the story of Count Olaf (Carrey), a mysterious theater troupe actor, who attempts to deceive three orphans over their deceased parents' fortune. Streep was cast in the role of the children's overanxious Aunt Josephine, a character she has described as \\"a great tremulous bird of a person\\". The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, who called it \\"exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy, and bitingly subversive\\", and was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning in the Best Make-Up category. Though the film became a financial success, grossing US$209 million on a budget of US$140 million, plans to expand the film into a franchise failed to materialize. Streep's was next cast in the 2005 romantic comedy Prime, directed by Ben Younger. In the film, she plays a Jewish New York psychoanalyst, whose 23-year-old son (played by Bryan Greenberg) enters a relationship with one of her patients, a divorced 37-year-old business-woman, played by Uma Thurman, resulting in a dilemma of two conflicting intentions. Streep welcomed the opportunity to reprise her comedic talent, though she and Younger agreed on her not consciously playing the part for laughs. Prime received generally mixed reviews, with many critics declaring it another formulaic Hollywood rom-com. Desson Thomson of the Washington Post commented that the film followed a familiar boy-meets-girl scenario, but found that Younger had turned \\"the routine into combustible fun\\", and that, \\"Streep, meant to be the third party here, rapidly becomes the drama's most entertaining nucleus\\". A modest mainstream success, the film eventually grossed US$67.9 million internationally. 2006-2007 Streep began 2006 with A Prairie Home Companion, director Robert Altman's final film. An ensemble piece featuring Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline, Woody Harrelson, and Lindsay Lohan, the film revolves around the behind-the-scenes activities at a long- running public radio show which is nearing its cancellation, depicting the show's final broadcast. Streep, initially unsure about the gestalt of the movie due to its genre-crossing nature, noted it \\"an odd little creature\\". In the film, she, along with Lily Tomlin, portrayed one half of a sister duo which was once part of a popular family country music act. Required to perform her own vocals in the film, Altman decided to cast Streep without any vocal audition. After releasing in several film festivals, the film grossed over US$26 million, the majority of which came from domestic markets. General reaction to the film was favorable by critics, who called it \\"a worthy swan song from one of the cinema's best\\", resulting in an average 81% fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Streep with co-stars Anne Hathaway and Stanley Tucci at the \\"Prada\\" premiere in Venice in September 2006. The same year, Streep appeared in The Devil Wears Prada (2006), a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same name. Co-starring Anne Hathaway as a recent college graduate who goes to New York City and gets a job as a co- assistant at the fictional fashion magazine Runway, Streep played the powerful, demanding, and much-feared editor Miranda Priestly. Though widely speculated that Streep's performance was modeled after Vogue editor Anna Wintour, to whom Weisberger had once been an assistant, the actress denied basing her portrayal on Wintour, stating that she \\"was just interested in making a human being as contradictory and messy as we all are\\". While the film itself received a mixed reception, Streep's performance drew rave reviews from critics, and later earned her many award nominations, including her record- setting 14th Oscar bid, as well as another Golden Globe. In her review for the Washington Post, Jennifer Frey wrote that, \\"When Streep's on the screen, she has the same effect [as her role] on her audience; she totally commands every scene.\\" The film was the biggest box-office success of Streep's career, and grossed more than US$326.5 million. Also in 2006, Streep returned to the New York Delacorte Theater when she starred onstage at The Public Theater's production of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children. The play was a new translation by playwright Tony Kushner, with songs written by composer Jeanine Tesori and direction by George C. Wolfe. Streep starred alongside Kevin Kline and Austin Pendleton. The following year, Streep was cast in four different films. She portrayed a wealthy university patron in opera director Chen Shi-zheng's feature drama Dark Matter (2007), a film about of a Chinese science graduate student, played by Liu Ye, who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university. The project took its inspiration from a 1991 tragedy in which a Chinese physics student opened fire in two buildings on the University of Iowa campus, killing six people. Premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve Dark Matter out of respect for the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007. Finally released in 2008, the drama received negative to mixed reviews, scoring an average 33% at Rotten Tomatoes. Reyhan Harmanci of the San Francisco Chronicle remarked that, \\"If only it weren't based on a true story. It might have been a good movie [...], but it's a tricky business, and Dark Matter does no one right by sticking to the shocking conclusion.\\" Streep played a U.S. government official, who investigates an Egyptian foreign national in Washington, D.C., suspected of terrorism in the Middle East, in the political thriller Rendition (2007). Directed by Gavin Hood, and co-starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Reese Witherspoon, and Alan Arkin, the film centers on the controversial CIA practice of extraordinary rendition, and is based on the true story of Khalid El-Masri, a German citizen who, in 2003, was kidnapped, interrogated, and tortured by the CIA for several months as a part of the War on Terror, apparently due to a misunderstanding that arose concerning the similarity of the spelling of El- Masri's name with the spelling of suspected Al-Qaeda terrorist al-Masri. Keen to get involved into a thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre she usually was not offered scripts for, and immediately signed on to the project. Upon its release, Rendition became a failure, grossing just US$27 million, and received mixed reviews. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone applauded the cast, but noted that the film was a \\"bust as a persuasive drama\\". Also in 2007, Streep had a short role alongside Vanessa Redgrave, Claire Danes, Toni Collette, and Glenn Close in Lajos Koltai's drama film Evening, based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Susan Minot. Switching between the present and the past, it tells the story of Ann Lord, a woman on the precipice of her death (Redgrave), who, bedridden in body, but not in spirit, remembers her tumultuous life the mid-1950s. Streep joined not until late into the production of the film, playing Lord's friend Lila, a role she shared with her eldest daughter Mamie Gummer, who portrayed the same character at a younger age. The film was released to lukewarm reactions by critics, who called it \\"beautifully filmed, but decidedly dull [and] a colossal waste of a talented cast\\", and earned just US$12.8 million during its limited release. Streep's last film of 2007 was Lions for Lambs, a war film drama also starring Tom Cruise and Robert Redford that takes aim at the U.S. government's prosecution of the wars in the Middle East, showing three different simultaneous stories: a senator who launches a new military strategy and details it to a journalist - played by Streep - on the edge of a mental breakdown; two soldiers involved in said operation; and their college professor trying to re-engage a promising student by telling him their story. Produced with barely a year between announcement and release, director Redford considered the movie \\"the tightest schedule I've ever worked with\\". Upon its release, Lions for Lambs received generally negative reviews from critics, with Wesley Morris from The Boston Globe writing: \\"It does not feel good to report that a movie with Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise makes the eyelids droop. But that's what Lions for Lambs does.\\" 2008-2009 Streep with her fellow cast and all four members of ABBA at the Swedish premiere of Mamma Mia! in July 2008. In 2008, Streep found major commercial success when she starred in Phyllida Lloyd's Mamma Mia!, a film adaptation of the 1999 West End musical of the same name, based on the songs of the Swedish pop group ABBA. Shot in England and Greece along with Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, and Colin Firth, she played the free-spirited single mother Donna in the film, a former backing singer and owner of a small hotel on an idyllic Greek island, whose daughter (Seyfried), a bride-to-be who never met her father, invites three likely paternal candidates to her wedding. Streep, who had seen the Broadway version of the musical several years earlier, felt \\"absolutely flabbergasted\\" about Lloyd's offer to star in screen musical, though her cast was not green lit until a successful rehearsal with original ABBA member Benny Andersson months before filming. Altogether, she recorded fourteen songs for the film, including \\"Money, Money, Money\\", \\"Dancing Queen\\", and \\"The Winner Takes It All\\", some of which re-entered several music charts around the globe. An instant box office success, Mamma Mia! became Streep's highest-grossing film to date, with box office receipts of US$602.6 million, also ranking it first among the highest-grossing musical films of all-time. Nominated for another Golden Globe, Streep's performance was generally well received by critics, with Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe writing, \\"Indeed, Streep brings out the best in everybody. She's connecting with an audience in a way she never has - grinning, eye-rolling, bouncing, and at one point, looking right at us [...] It's an electric image that's been 30 years in coming. The greatest actor in American movies has finally become a movie star.\\" Streep's other film of 2008 was Doubt, featuring Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. An adaptation of John Patrick Shanley's Pulitzer Prize-winning fictional stage play Doubt: A Parable, also written and directed by Shanley, the drama revolves around the stern principal nun (Streep) of a Bronx Catholic school in 1964 who brings charges of pedophilia against a popular priest (Hoffman). Hand-picked by Shanley, who decided on replacing the stage actors for the film, Streep used a cultured Bronx accent for her portrayal of Sister Aloysius Beauvier, a character she compared with her powerful, but dragon- like, roles in The Manchurian Candidate (2004) and The Devil Wears Prada (2006). Though Doubt became a moderate box office success, earning over US$50 million in ticket sales, the film was hailed by many critics as one of the best of 2008. Critic Manohla Dargis of The New York Times concluded that, \\"The air is thick with paranoia in Doubt, but nowhere as thick, juicy, sustained, or sustaining as Meryl Streep's performance [...] She blows in like a storm, shaking up the story's reverential solemnity with gusts of energy and comedy.\\" The film received five Academy Awards nominations - for its four lead actors, and for Shanley's script. Streep also garnered her first Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor from the Screen Actors Guild. Streep with It's Complicated co-star Alec Baldwin and producer Josh Wood at the 15th SAG Awards after party in January 2009. In 2009, Streep played chef Julia Child in Nora Ephron's comedy film Julie & Julia, co-starring Amy Adams and Stanley Tucci. One of the first major motion pictures based on a blog, it contrasts the life of Child in the early years of her culinary career with the life of New Yorker Julie Powell (Adams), who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child's cookbook Mastering the Art of French Cooking in 365 days, a challenge she described on her popular The Julie/Julia Project blog. Ephron's only choice, Streep, considered her portrayal both an \\"idealized version of Julia\\" and personal homage to her mother, who \\"had a similar joie de vivre, an undeniable sense of how to enjoy her life\\". Streep received universal acclaim for her performance which won her a seventh Golden Globe, a Satellite Award, and a 16th Oscar nomination. In his review of the film, critic A.O. Scott of The New York Times affirmed that, \\"by now, [Streep] has exhausted every superlative that exists, and to suggest that she has outdone herself is only to say that she's done it again\\". As in 2002 and the year before, Streep received a second Golden Globe nomination for her cast in another project that year: Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy It's Complicated (2009). Starring alongside Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, Streep played a successful bakery owner who starts a secret affair with her ex-husband ten years after their divorce. Written by Meyers with Streep in mind, the film was released to generally mixed reviews by critics, who applauded the cast, but declared it a \\"predictable romantic comedy fare, going for broad laughs, instead of subtlety and nuance\\". However, It's Complicated became a commercial success worldwide, collecting US$220.0 million at international box offices. For their performances, the cast was awarded a National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Award for Best Ensemble Cast the same year. Also in 2009, Streep replaced Cate Blanchett as the voice of the vixen Felicity Fox, the female main character in Wes Anderson's stop-motion animated film Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009). Based on the Roald Dahl children's novel of the same name, the film tells the story about a fox named Mr. Fox, voiced by George Clooney, who is able to outwit a group of farmers and lives underground after stealing food from them each night. Fantastic Mr. Fox received positive reviews from a vast majority of critics, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. Also in 2009, an article in The Independent called Streep's money-making ability the \\"Streep effect\\", noting that, \\"Julie & Julia, in which she plays the kitchen guru Julia Child, has already taken more than $28.5m (¬£17m) since its US release two weeks ago, and has sent Child's 1961 book Mastering the Art of French Cooking back to the top of best-seller lists, as well as triggering a boom in interest in French cuisine classes in the US... After the star uncharacteristically sang and danced - in dungarees, what's more - in last year's Abba musical Mamma Mia!, the highest-grossing British film ever, not only did the Swedish group's Gold collection top the album charts, there was also a surge in demand from couples who wanted to marry on the Greek island of Skopelos, as in the film, with easyJet reporting flights up 13 per cent in the months after the film's release.\\" References 2000s in film Streep, Meryl Meryl Streep 2000s in American cinema ","title":"Meryl Streep in the 2000s"},{"id":"31235409","text":"The Gulbenkian Commission sought to address inadequacies in the organization of the social science disciplines that developed in the nineteenth century by indicating a direction for social scientific inquiry for the next 50 years. It was founded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. It held three meetings in 1994 and 1995.  Members  Its members included Immanuel Wallerstein (chair), Calestous Juma, Evelyn Fox Keller, J√ºrgen Kocka, Dominique Lecourt, Valentin Y. Mudimbe, Kinhide Mushakoji, Ilya Prigogine, Peter J. Taylor, Michel-Rolph Trouillot. Six of them were drawn from the social sciences, two from the natural sciences and two from the humanities. The commission sought to produce a book length work that would identify new directions for the organization of knowledge in the next fifty years. The report was published in 1996 by Stanford University as the book, Open the Social Sciences by Immanuel Wallerstein. To foster international debate, the report has been published in numerous languages including English, French, Portuguese, German, Dutch, Czech, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Romanian, Serbocroat, Turkish, and Japanese.  Debate  The ideas in the report have stimulated debate around the world. For example, in the Indian Magazine Frontline, Sundar Sarukkai discussed its conclusions and applicability to the Indian context, which he criticizes for being cliquish and unprofessional.Sarukkai, Sundar (2001). \\"The Gulbenkian Prognosis\\", Frontline, 18(22).

Nor do we hear for whom this knowledge will be produced, nor for what ends.

She is the daughter of Irving Adler and Ruth Adler and younger sister of Stephen L. Adler. Early career Adler began her professional career as an illustrator in 1958, at the age of 16, when she was co-illustrator of her father's book Weather In Your Life. That same year, she was the sole illustrator of Hot and Cold. She later illustrated the children's book Numbers Old and New, as well as authoring and illustrating The Adler Book of Puzzles and Riddles; and The Second Adler Book of Puzzles and Riddles. Adler married in June 1962 and had two daughters before filing for divorce in early fall 1967. Authorship Adler continued working as an illustrator, with work published by the John Day Company, Little, Brown & Company, the Journal of Theoretical Biology, the Journal of Algebra, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, World Scientific Publishing the Bronx Zoo, and the Humane Society of the United States. In the mid-1970s Adler returned to writing as well as illustrating, when Franklin Watts published her book, Metric Puzzles, followed shortly thereafter by Math Puzzles and Geography Puzzles. In 1976 Adler remarried and for a brief time, in the early 1990s, worked under the name of Peggy Adler Robohm -- but after a few years, resumed the use of her maiden name. Peggy Adler employed as an Assistant Investigator by the U.S. House of Representatives' October Surprise Task Force (pdf).

Discovering evidence in his files contradicting claims regarding his presence at October Surprise conspiracy meetings, she contacted former CIA analyst-turned-journalist, Frank Snepp. This evidence was the basis of Snepp's February 1992 article for the Village Voice which outed Brenneke as a con artist. Adler worked with Snepp on additional articles for the \\"Voice\\" which went on to prove that the so-called \\"October Surprise\\" was a hoax. Adler's work was also the subject of a chapter in Robert Parry's book, \\"Trick or Treason: The October Surprise Mystery\\" and she was interviewed by PBS' Frontline in this regard for an episode which aired in April 1992. In mid-1992, learning that the House October Surprise Task Force was investigating whether or not there actually had been an October Surprise, she contacted investigative journalist and author Steven Emerson, who put her in touch with the Task Force so that she could turn over to them the seventy cartons of documents she had hauled east from Brenneke's home in Portland, Oregon, in order to write his memoirs. Subsequently, she worked as a consultant to the Task Force, and assisted in drafting and editing the Brenneke section of their final report. In 2000 and 2001, she was the researcher for journalist and author Ron Rosenbaum's articles about Yale's fabled Skull and Bones, which were published in The New York Observer. Community involvement Adler is active in local affairs in Clinton, Connecticut, the town in which she lives. In 2005 she filed a complaint with Clinton's Board of Ethics, stating that a first term selectman had violated his fiduciary duties as an elected official by voting in favor of the town's purchase of properties in his neighborhood for open space, when he had previously been a \\"member of a neighborhood group that vigorously opposed\\" a nearby development proposal. The Board of Ethics dismissed the complaint, despite the fact that Adler was \\"never interviewed\\" and no witnesses were called. Adler later \\"said the Board of Ethics based its finding on a 'misinterpretation' of both the state law and the town's charter and subsequently, Town Counsel said that they had the final say over such matters and their decision would stand. Adler later sought, unsuccessfully, to have the Board's decision reviewed by Richard Blumenthal, who was Connecticut's Attorney General at the time. The Board of Selectmen responded to these outcomes by creating \\"a committee to review the town's code of ethics.\\"Selectmen's Minutes of 5/11/2005 Retrieved 12 September 2011 As a result, a new ethics ordinance was enacted by the Town of Clinton in November 2006, which became effective in January 2007.Clinton's new Code of Ethics Retrieved 12 September 2011 This new ordinance was successfully implemented for the first time in early 2012.

There, she has also served on the Design Review Board, Historic District Commission, and Charter Revision Commission. Intelligence work In July 2000, the New England Chapter of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers held a meeting in Northampton, Massachusetts. Adler served as the program coordinator and kept careful track of the \\"comings and goings at the banquet room to prevent any 'crashers' to the luncheon\\". Describing the purpose of the association, Adler was quoted as saying, \\"A big part of what we try to do is to dispel the misconception that intelligence work is just like what they show in James Bond movies.\\" The meeting was attended by approximately 20 of the protestors, about whom Adler said, \\"It's their constitutional right\\", so long as they pay to attend and dine at the luncheon for the same fee as the membership\\".

The Meiyintang was widely hailed as one of the last great collections of Chinese porcelain by European owners.

The Economist, March 17, 2011, p. 92f. The Zuellig family also collected Chinese bronzes of the Shang, Zhou and Warring States periods. History The Meiyintang Collection was assembled over more than half a century by the Manila-born brothers Gilbert Zuellig (1918‚Äì2009) and Stephen Zuellig (1917-2017). Through their life and business activities in the Far East they developed a keen and manifold interest in Asian art and culture. In the late 1950s, they began to build up a systematic collection of Chinese art. Gilbert Zuellig specialized in early pottery, stoneware and ceramics, spanning five millennia from the Neolithic period to the Han, Tang and Song Dynasties, while his brother Stephen collected the later porcelains of the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties as well as archaic bronzes. Early on in their career as expert collectors, the Zuellig brothers were encouraged and guided by the connoisseur and dealer Edward T. Chow.Transactions of the Oriental Ceramic Society, Volume 73 (2008‚Äì2009), pg. xi. As of 1994, the term Meiyintang gained international recognition among specialists of Chinese ceramics, following the publication of the catalogues written by the researcher Regina Krahl, in which the pieces of the collection are described in a scholarly presentation with comprehensive illustrations.

The letters of Roehenstart's mother to her own mother, Clementina Walkinshaw, provide evidence that this was one of her children, two daughters and one son, all fathered by Ferdinand de Rohan. The daughters were Marie Victoire Ad√©la√Øde (\\"Aglae\\"), who was baptised at the Ch√¢teau de Couzi√®res on 19 June 1779, and Charlotte Maximilienne Am√©lie, born during the summer of 1780. The pregnancy with Roehenstart delayed Charlotte's plans to join her father in Florence, he having been kept in ignorance of all three children. On 23 March 1783, the ailing Prince Charles Edward had legitimised Charlotte, created her Duchess of Albany in the Jacobite Peerage, and made her heiress to some of his private property, but not his claim to the throne. She travelled to join him soon after the birth of Roehenstart, leaving her children behind in the care of her own mother, herself taking on the responsibility for nursing her father until his death on 31 January 1788. Less than two years later, on 17 November 1789, Charlotte herself died of cancer in Bologna.Noel McFerran, Charlotte, Duchess of Albany at jacobite.ca, accessed 20 March 2011 In her Will, Charlotte did not mention her children but left money to her mother Clementina \\"to allow her the power of disposing at her death of fifty thousand francs in favour of any of her necessitous relations\\".Will of Charlotte, Duchess of Albany at jacobite.ca, accessed 20 March 2011 Cardinal Henry Stuart, who was her uncle and executor as well as being the new Jacobite pretender, delayed releasing the money for two years. Charlotte Stuart, by Hugh Douglas Hamilton Roehenstart's grandmother Clementina Walkinshaw lived until 1802, in her later years taking up residence in Switzerland, and Roehenstart was raised in the reformed faith. During the years of the French Revolution, his father paid for his education in Germany. A substantial fortune came to Roehenstart from his grandmother, much of which on the recommendation of Thomas Coutts was invested in London with Turnbull, Forbes & Co., but the firm went bankrupt in 1803. Most of the remainder of his fortune, one hundred thousand roubles, was invested with a Russian banker named Sofniev. In later life, Roehenstart stated that in 1800 he had been commissioned as an artillery officer of the Imperial Russian Army and had been promoted by 1803. On 8 August 1804, in Paris, he signed his name as a witness at the marriage of his sister Charlotte de Roehenstart to Jean-Louis de la Morliere. By 1806, he was no longer in the army, having resigned his commission as a lieutenant colonel, and had taken service in the household of Duke Alexander of Wurttemberg, who was Tsar Alexander I's Governor of White Ruthenia. In Saint Petersburg, Roehenstart was presented to the Tsarina, who was impressed by him. In 1811, he was offered the hand of an heiress, Marianna Hurko, but made the mistake of falling in love with her sister, Evelina, who was promised elsewhere. Unhappily, at about the same time Roehenstart's banker Sofniev failed, and Roehenstart was advised that he would recover only about five thousand roubles from the disaster. To the distress and anger of the Wurttembergs, he fled Russia, sailing from Kronstadt and arriving in London by November 1811. From there, he set sail for North America, in pursuit of John Forbes, a partner in Turnbull, Forbes & Co. who after the firm's failure had absconded to the United States with money Roehenstart believed to be rightfully his.Peter Pini≈Ñski, The Stuarts' Last Secret, p. 187 He lived in Philadelphia from 1811 to 1813.Notes and queries, vol. 198 (1953), p. 72: \\"The Roehenstart Papers (now penes Prof. Sherburn in America) reveal that the Count of Roehenstart himself was on friendly terms with the Couttses (who had done so much for his family in the past, as Miss Tayler shows) and that he spent considerable time in Philadelphia in his younger days, notably between the years 1811 and 1813.\\" He remained in America until 1814. Roehenstart's grandfather, Charles Edward Stuart In 1816, after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, Roehenstart went to Scotland and again to England, unsuccessfully renewing the Stuarts' pursuit of their old claim on the dowry of Queen Mary Beatrice of Modena, his great-great-grandmother. In about 1820, Roehenstart married Maria Antonietta Sofia Barberini, the daughter of an exile said to be an Italian nobleman. She died the next year and on 20 July 1821 was buried under the name of \\"Countess Roehenstart\\" at Marylebone, London, her age at death being stated as thirty. On 13 December 1826, at St Pancras, London, he married secondly Louisa Constance Bouchier Smith, an Englishwoman possessing a modest fortune, the daughter of Joseph Bouchier Smith, sometime lord of the manor of Kidlington in Oxfordshire, who had recently died.Pini≈Ñski, p. 198'Kidlington: Manors and other estates', in A History of the County of Oxford, volume 12: Wootton Hundred (South) including Woodstock (1990), pp. 188-194, accessed 20 March 2011 Louisa Constance lived until 20 October 1853, dying at Paris, but there were no children of either marriage. Following his second marriage, Roehenstart returned to continental Europe and spent much of the next twenty-five years travelling, usually without his wife, but they were settled permanently in his native Paris. In later life, Roehenstart spoke openly of his royal descent, but he became so boastful of his origins and adventures that few believed him.Susan Maclean Kybert, Bonnie Prince Charlie: A Biography (London: 1988), p. 313 In 1853, he lost his wife, and in 1854 he revisited Scotland. While there he was fatally injured in a road accident, when he was travelling in a carriage which overturned. He was buried in the graveyard of Dunkeld Cathedral. His friends provided a modest headstone, with the inscription \\"Sacred to the memory of General Charles Edward Stuart Count Roehenstart who died at Dunkeld on the 28th October 1854 Sic transit gloria mundi\\".Gerald Warner, Tales of the Scottish Highlands (1982), pp. 100‚Äì101 In the twentieth century Roehenstart's papers came into the hands of the American scholar George Sherburn, who produced a comprehensive account of him from them.W. Frost. 'Recent Studies in the Restoration and Eighteenth Century', in SEL: Studies in English Literature 1500‚Äì1900 (vol. 2, no. 3, Summer, 1962), pp. 359‚Äì384: \\"Charles Edward Augustus Maximilien Stuart, Baron Korff, Count Roehenstart (1784?-1854), a pretender to the English throne, left behind him a collection of papers later acquired by George Sherburn and turned into a convincing portrait.\\" Pretender to the throne In order to lay a claim of his own to the British throne, Roehenstart maintained consistently that his grandfather Prince Charles Edward had married his grandmother, Clementina Walkinshaw, and also that his mother the Duchess of Albany had married a Swedish nobleman named Maximilian Roehenstart. The first is unlikely, although not an impossibility, but it lacks evidence; nothing has come to light to support the second claim, and there is no Swedish noble family named Roehenstart. On the contrary, Charlotte's relationship with Rohan is well evidenced.Francis John Angus Skeet, The life and letters of H. R. H. Charlotte Stuart: duchess of Albany, only child of Charles III, king of Great Britain, Scotland, France and Ireland (1932), p. 160 Although he laid claim to the Jacobite succession, Roehenstart made no practical attempt to regain the throne of his Stuart ancestors.

It is a split of the main article Amiga software. See also related articles Amiga productivity software, Amiga music software, Amiga Internet and communications software and Amiga support and maintenance software for other information regarding software that runs on Amiga. History Many games and software, especially in the early years of the Amiga were written to directly access the hardware instead of using the operating system for graphics and input. Consequently games could achieve much faster and smoother game-play, but at the cost of compatibility with newer Amiga models. Cross-platform libraries and programming facilities Several cross-platform libraries and facilities are available for Amiga: * MUI and ReAction are Amiga standard Object Oriented systems for building graphical interfaces. * SDL libraries are widely used in all modern Amiga systems * Cairo support is built into AmigaOS 4.1 and MorphOS 3.0 * Anti-Grain Geometry * CLib2 is a portable ISO C (1994) runtime library for the Amiga. * Allegro Library has been ported to AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS . * an Amiga port of wxWidgets is being worked on wxWidgets-AOS. * Gallium3D is now part of AROS Icaros Desktop Live Distro. * OpenAL free software cross-platform audio API, designed for efficient rendering of multichannel three-dimensional positional audio, is available for MorphOS and any AmigaOS version 3 and later revisions. * AROS and MorphOS support FreeType library in various projects, included its version release of Origyn Web Browser. * FLTK \\"Fast, Light Toolkit\\" version for AmigaOS 4.0 is almost complete and it offers all the functionality of the official 1.1.6 version, including the standard and plastic scheme. For many years Amiga lacked a complete integrated development environment (IDE). This changed in 2005‚Äì2006 when Cubic IDE was created, based on the modular text editor GoldED. Brief list of languages available on Amiga Assemblers: ASM-One Macro Assembler, Devpac Assembler, Metacomco Macro Assembler, SEKA Assembler Basic dialects: AmigaBASIC from Microsoft, ABasic from Commodore (developed by Metacomco), AC Basic Compiler, GFA BASIC, HiSoft Basic, AMOS BASIC, Blitz BASIC, PureBasic C-compilers: Aztec C, DICE C, GNU gcc, VBCC, Lattice C, SAS/C, Storm C, HiSoft C++ PASCAL: Amiga Pascal, Kick-Pascal, High Speed Pascal, Free Pascal Other languages: Forth (JForth), FORTRAN, Amiga Logo, Oberon, Perl 5, Ruby, Amiga E, FALSE, PortablE, Python (AmigaPython), REBOL, ARexx, Scheme (SCM, Gambit, UMB Scheme, SIOD), GNU C++, Modula-2, Benchmark Modula 2, Eiffel, Java (JAmiga), and ML (Caml Light). =Descriptions of some languages= ABasiC was developed by MetaComCo and was bundled with AmigaOS 1.0 and 1.1. AmigaOS 1.2 and 1.3 came bundled with AmigaBASIC (and a complete manual), which other than also being a BASIC dialect, was not related to ABasic. AmigaBASIC was the only programming language (and the only tool) made by Microsoft for the Amiga computer. Its best feature was the lack of numbering lines of code, which was the first attempt in 1985/1986 to create a new approach in BASIC programming. Microsoft then added this feature to all its development language tools. As AmigaBASIC was bundled with so many Amigas it was one of the most common used language in the early years. Because Commodore wanted to save money, an update was never made for AmigaBasic. Due to its vast number of known bugs and limitations it was immediately discarded by professional developers in favour of other programming languages such as GFA BASIC, Aztec C, Lattice C, and then AMOS. These bugs and limitations included: * crashes on newer processors and AmigaOS versions newer than 1.3 when using subroutines (gosub) and sound * the editor being written for NTSC and so not using the full screen on PAL screens (the TV standard in Europe) * commercially released BASIC's provided better IDE's and better (faster) performance SEKA assembler was a popular tool among game and demo programmers in the early years of the Amiga. Later Devpac and AsmOne became popular assemblers. SEKA, DevPac and AsmOne all were IDE's and included editor, assembler, linker and debugger. Devpac Assembler by HiSoft was a professional assembler program that became the de facto standard for assembly programming. It could also be used for Cross-platform development for any other Motorola 68k-based device, such as the Atari ST. It was common for programs to be written jointly for the Amiga and Atari using Devpac on the Amiga. However, since the Atari ST was the less capable of the two machines, programs would be tested on and built primarily for the ST. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) Until 2005-6 Amiga lacked real IDE software (apart from the legacy IDE Storm C). Development was done with advanced text editors such as Emacs, MicroEmacs, Cygnus Editor and Gold Ed (Gold Editor), which could highlight syntax of various kind in programming languages. Gold Ed then evolved into a complete IDE environment commercial program called Cubic IDE. The most widely used IDE programs are the commercial program Cubic IDE and the commercial program CodeBench that is sometimes released with limited functions as free-licence version. =Application Building Tools= Some Amiga programs were complete application tools. Examples were: CanDO, Amiga Vision, Shoot'Em- Up Construction Kit also known as SEUCK, 3D Construction Kit, 3D Construction Kit II and to some degree The Director (BASIC-like language aimed at multimedia, presentations and animations). AMOS itself could be considered an application building tool and was more than a simple programming language (even if SEUCK was aimed at games. 3D Construction series could also handle some sorts of 3D VRML). Other tools to build independent applications or \\"self loading projects\\" were Scala Multimedia and Hollywood Designer. CanDO was one of the first application building tools capable of creating programs for the Amiga that was totally independent (compiled or full binary). It is based on a visual interface, after the modern \\"visual programming\\" approach to programming which became famous with Visual C++ and Visual Basic from Microsoft. Although CanDO has nothing in common with Visual C and Visual Basic, it is a mouse-driven program with an icon approach, and its internal programming is like an interactive flow chart of functions, just like the VISUAL programming tools. Eddie Churchill, one of the primary developers of CanDO, went on to help develop Borland's object-oriented Pascal IDE, Delphi. Amiga Vision is like CanDO for the Amiga. It is a VISUAL \\"application building\\" tool made by Commodore for the launch of Amiga 3000, and it was released for free to all those who bought an Amiga 3000. The Vision is more than a language aimed at multimedia, all icon driven, and the flow chart of the functions was realized graphically, on a page in which the user could arrange visually icons with each representing a program function. Vision saved files (projects) could not be used as pure binaries. From this point of view, the Amiga Vision \\"application building\\" tool was an interpreted language. The AmigaBasic created by Microsoft, CanDO, and then Amiga Vision inspired Microsoft itself to an approach to Visual programming with their line of Visual programming languages, such as Visual Basic and others.

She conducted experiments aimed at improving household efficiency, as well as arguing for women's vital role as consumers in a mass- production economy. She wrote books on these subjects, the best-known of which is probably Selling Mrs. Consumer, which offers an early justification for planned obsolescence as a necessary feature of the industrial economy. Early years Christine Isobel Campbell was born in 1883 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Mimi (n√©e Scott) and William R. Campbell, who separated shortly afterwards. In 1894 Frederick's mother married a lawyer, Wyatt MacGaffey, who adopted the girl. In 1906, Christine McGaffey (as she preferred to spell her surname) graduated from Northwestern University and became a teacher. A year later, she married J. (Justus) George Frederick, a business executive interested in the theories of scientific management put forward by Frederick W. Taylor and others. The Fredericks had four children, David Mansfield, Jean, Phyllis, and Carol. Efficiency expert Photograph of \\"vegetable preparing table\\" from Christine Frederick's 1919 book Household Engineering. Diagram of inefficient kitchen from Christine Frederick's 1919 book Household Engineering. Efficient kitchen plan from Christine Frederick's 1919 book Household Engineering. After moving to New York, Christine and J. George Frederick helped to found a club called the Advertising Women of New York in 1912 because women were refused admission to the men's advertising club. Becoming interested in Taylorism as applied to the domestic sphere, Frederick founded and directed a laboratory for conducting Taylorist experiments at her home in Greenlawn, New York. She was especially interested in making kitchens more efficient for women and is credited with bringing about standardization of the height of kitchen counters and work surfaces. At the Applecroft Home Experiment Station, Frederick investigated some 1,800 different products from household appliances to food, looking for labor-saving methods of preparation and use. In 1912, Frederick began a series of articles under the title 'New Housekeeping' in the Ladies' Home Journal (for which she served as consulting household editor) to explain Taylorism to middle-class women. These articles were subsequently published as a book, The New Housekeeping: Efficiency Studies in Home Management. Frederick's second chapter, on applying motion studies to household tasks, shows the clear parallel between her research and Taylor's well-known studies in the industrial sphere. She followed this up in 1915 with a correspondence course called Household Engineering: Scientific Management in the Home, which was published as a book of the same title in 1919. In 1917, she did some lecturing on the Chautauqua circuit. Frederick inspired the French journalist Paulette Bern√®ge, who became the leader of the Domestic Sciences movement in France in the inter-war years. Christine Frederick visited France in April 1927, where Bern√®ge quickly arranged a meeting of the League for Household Efficiency, Association for Household Electric Appliances and Mon Chez Moi, at which the Minister of Housing presided. Over the course of some thirty years, Frederick served as an editor for a number of other publications. She was home economics editor of Butterick Publishing Company's magazine The Designer, as well as a consulting editor for Shrine and the American Weekly. She also earned money (as well as gaining publicity) by promoting specific products under the banner of home efficiency.Szerlip, B. Alexandra. (2017) The Man Who Designed the Future: Norman Bel Geddes and the Invention of Twentieth-Century America. Brooklyn: Melville House. p. 124. Frederick sometimes worked with her husband, who was president of a company called Business Bourse that specialized in publishing business-related research and data. In the 1920s, the Fredericks broadened their views to embrace the idea of planned product obsolescence as a form of large-scale efficiency. Rejecting the traditional idea that products should be made to last, they argued instead for obsolescence as a kind of ‚Äòcreative waste‚Äô that kept the industrial economy running smoothly. In this view, well-made, long-lasting objects are a problem because they saturate the market, creating resistance to the efficiencies of mass production. In Advertising the American Dream, Roland Marchand calls the Fredericks 'evangelists of the new ideology' of planned obsolescence. Death Christine Frederick died of heart disease in 1970 at the age of 87. Her papers are held in the Radcliffe Institute's Schlesinger Library.

Gameplay Like chess, Zatikon is a turn-based game that takes place on a grid. Using units they deploy from a castle at their end of the board, the players try to move onto the castle of their opponent. Instead of moving only one unit each turn, the players get commands, which they can use to move multiple units or to have a single unit take several actions. Each unit has five characteristics: *Actions, which determine how many times it can move in a given turn; *Life, which determines how much damage it can take; *Power, which determines how much damage it inflicts with each attack; *Armor, which reduces the amount of damage it takes from each attack; and *Deployment cost, which determines how many commands it costs to deploy.Chronic Logic (date unknown). \\"Zatikon Guide.\\" Accessed Nov. 24, 2010. Most units can attack enemy units, though how they attack varies. Archers, catapults, and many wizards can attack units several squares away. Generals and knights can only attack adjacent units. So can warriors, but they attack all enemies in range simultaneously. In addition to attacks, many units have special abilities. For example, the shield maiden can take damage for its allies, the priest can convert enemy units, and the swordsman can block attacks.Chronic Logic (January 20, 2010). Zatikon Unit Guide (PDF). Accessed November 24, 2010. Gameplay Modes The game has five different modes: *Single player constructed, in which one player plays against a computer-controlled opponent that gets stronger each time they win and weaker each time they lose; *Cooperative constructed, in which two players play against the computer opponent; *One-versus-one constructed, in which two players compete using armies they have designed; *Two-versus-two constructed, in which teams of two compete using armies they have designed; and *Random, in which two players compete using randomly generated armies. In the constructed modes, players design their army under two constraints. First, their army can only use units worth 1,000 points. Since each unit has different point values, the players must decide whether to have several less powerful units, a few strong units, or some compromise between the two. They also try to create armies with units that complement each other. For example, a player might combine several cheap units with a captain, which can grant them free attacks by attacking a unit within their range.Author unknown (Monday, May 17, 2010). \\"The Zatikon Underdog: The Captain.\\" Accessed March 19, 2011. Second, players can only add units to their army if they have recruited that type of unit. Players recruit units using gold they win when they defeat computer-controlled opponents or complete a game with a human opponent.

Plants in the genus are small and grow submerged in shallow temporary pools. Although the genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, locating populations is often difficult. Its occurrence is sporadic and local, and the tiny plants are ephemeral. The ornamented spores remain viable for several years, allowing the plants to survive annual drying of their habitat. The plants are easily grown in laboratory cultures. Description Riella plants are small, usually or less, and thalloid, with an appearance like an immature alga. The plant consists of an erect central axis (\\"stem\\") that is commonly forked, but only sparingly, and the plants are bright green. The stem bears a thin dorsal lamina or \\"wing\\", which being on only one side gives the plant an asymmetrical appearance. This lamina is ruffled or undulate. Early descriptions of the species Riella helicophylla overemphasized the spiralled form of the lamina, which does not occur in other species. One species, the Algerian Riella bialata bears two wings along its stems instead of the usual single lamina. The lamina has a thickness of only a single layer of cells, with all the cells thin-walled and chlorophyllose. In addition to the lamina, the central stem bears delicate, small, leaf-like scales in three series along its lateral and ventral aspects. The leaf scales are dimorphic and contain scattered oil cells, with a single oil body per cell. Riella is thus the only member of its order with oil cells, although other genera in the class Marchantiopsida commonly have them. Distribution Although found nearly worldwide, Riella populations are sporadic and limited to only a few known localities. The plants are never common, and are found most often in places where the summer is dry and the winter is wet and mild. Prior to 1900, Riella was thought to occur only in regions around the Mediterranean. The first collections from outside this region were published in 1902 when Porsild reported collecting R. paulsenii in Kazakhstan in 1898. Three further specimens from the United States were reported in 1903, although one of these had been collected much earlier in 1855. Since that time, additional populations have been reported from South Africa, southern Argentina, and southeastern Australia. Riella species primarily grow as submerged aquatic plants, rarely floating or emergent. Although it is unique among hepatics as a submerged aquatic, it is not the only aquatic liverwort. The plants grow in fresh or brackish water of temporary bodies of water, and rarely in permanent ones. Classification The genus Riella was first published in 1852 by Camille Montagne. The group was given its own family Riellaceae 40 years later by Adolf Engler. Modern bryologists classify the Riellaceae in the order Sphaerocarpales, along with the family Sphaerocarpaceae. Studies comparing genetic sequences of Riella plants support this relationship. Porsild recognized a subgenus Trabutiella distinguished by the presence of longitudinal wings on the involucre. The only other subgenus (Riella subg. Riella) bears smooth involucres that lack these wings of tissue. Species of Riella are distinguished using morphology of the spores or archegonial involucres, since the gametophytes of the genus possess few distinguishing non-reproductive characters. There are 19, 18, or 17 species in the genus.

The term may also reference a putative journey undertaken by traditional African music from its homeland to the United States and back. Some scholars and ethnomusicologists have speculated that the origins of the blues can be traced to the musical traditions of Africa, as retained by African-Americans during and after slavery. Even though the blues is a key component of American popular music, its rural, African-American origins are largely undocumented, and its stylistic links with African instrumental traditions are somewhat tenuous. One musical influence that can be traced back to African sources is that of the plantation work songs with their call-and-response format, and more especially the relatively free-form field hollers of the later sharecroppers, which seem to have been directly responsible for the characteristic vocal style of the blues.

The field of criminology studies the dynamics of crime. Most of these studies use correlational data; that is, they attempt to identify various factors are associated with specific categories of criminal behavior. Such correlational studies led to hypotheses about the causes of these crimes. The Handbook of Crime Correlates (2009) is a systematic review of 5200 empirical studies on crime that have been published worldwide. A crime consistency score represents the strength of relationships. The scoring depends on how consistently a statistically significant relationship was identified across multiple studies. The authors claim that the review summarizes most of what is currently known about the variables associated with criminality. Gender and biology Crime occurs most frequently during the second and third decades of life. Males commit more crime overall and more violent crime than females. They commit more property crime except shoplifting, which is about equally distributed between the genders. Males appear to be more likely to reoffend. Measures related to arousal such as heart rate and skin conductance are low among criminals. Mesomorphic or muscular body type is positively correlated with criminality, in particular with sexual crimes. When controlling for age and sex, strong genetic correlates with criminality. Low monoamine oxidase activity and low 5-HIAA levels tend to be found among criminals. Monoamine oxidase A (dubbed the \\"warrior gene\\" in the popular press) is strongly tied to an increased tendency towards violent crime. In addition, CDH13, a gene previously tied to an increased risk of substance abuse, has been tied to violent crime. These tendencies are ostensibly related, as the majority of all individuals who commit severe violent crime in Finland do so under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The presence of the genetic profile is not determinative, although it increases the likelihood of delinquency in cases where other factors are present. Ferguson stated, 'a large percentage of our behaviour in terms of violence or aggression is influenced by our biology - our genes - and our brain anatomy.' Schnupp stated, 'To call these alleles \\"genes for violence\\" would therefore be a massive exaggeration. In combination with many other factors these genes may make it a little harder for you to control violent urges, but they most emphatically do not predetermine you for a life of crime.' Race, ethnicity and immigration Associated factors include race and crime and status as an immigrant. In some countries, ethnically/racially diverse geographical areas have higher crime rates compared to homogeneous areas, and in other countries, it is the other way around. Some studies on immigrants found higher rates of crime among these populations; these rates vary according to the country of origin (immigrants from some regions having lower crime rates than the indigenous population). Notions about the propensity for immigrants to commit crime vary among geographical regions. Likewise, the propensity for immigrants to commit more or less crime than the indigenous population also varies geographically. For instance within the United States, census data shows that immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated for a crime than residents who were born within the United States. The census includes both legal and illegal immigrants, as it counts the total number of people residing in an area regardless of citizenship status. Early life Associated factors include maternal smoking during pregnancy, Low birth weight, perinatal trauma/birth complications, child maltreatment, low parent-child attachment, marital discord/family discord, alcoholism and drug use in the family, low parental supervision/monitoring, family size and birth order, nocturnal enuresis or bed wetting, bullying, school disciplinary problems, truancy, low grade point average, dropping out of high school and childhood lead exposure. Adult behavior Associated factors include high alcohol use, alcohol abuse and alcoholism, high illegal drug use and dependence, early age of first sexual intercourse and the number of sexual partners, social isolation, criminal peer groups and gang membership. Religion A few studies have found a negative correlation between religiosity and criminality. A 2001 meta-analysis found, \\"religious beliefs and behaviors exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals' criminal behavior\\", but that \\"studies have systematically varied in their estimation of the religion-on-crime effect due to differences in both their conceptual and methodological approaches\\". This suggests that religiosity has been operationalized in varying ways, impacting the results of the findings. Additionally, 1995 paper stated that \\"[a]lthough a few researchers have found that religion's influence is noncontingent, most have found support‚Äîespecially among youths‚Äîfor effects that vary by denomination, type of offense, and social and/or religious context,\\" suggesting a complex relationship between religiosity and crime. They also \\"found that, among our religiosity measures, participation in religious activities was a persistent and noncontingent inhibiter of adult crime\\" when controlling for other factors, such as social ecology and secular constraints. An individual with high religious saliency (i.e. expressing the high importance of religion in their life) is less likely to be associated with criminal activities; similarly, an individual who regularly attends religious services or is highly involved in them tends to be less involved in criminality, with the exception of property damage. Other meta-analysis research suggests that those who subscribe to more orthodox religious beliefs are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than those who do not. A 2012 study suggested that belief in hell decreases crime rates, while belief in heaven increases them, and indicated that these correlations were stronger than other correlates like national wealth or income inequality. A 1997 study of six public high schools found no statistically significant negative correlations between religiosity and crime, or religiosity and drug use, and the only relationship between religiosity and alcohol was statistically significant. A more recent review concludes that there are insufficient data to indicate any correlation between religiosity and crime. Furthermore, any possible correlations may not apply universally to all relatively nonreligious groups, as there is some evidence self-identified atheists have had significantly lower incarceration rates than the general public in the United States. Most studies examining correlation to date do not distinguish between different types of low religiosity. Political ideology A 2016 study found statistically significant evidence that political ideology is moderately correlated with involvement in non-violent crime, among White individuals and particularly among White women. It suggests that liberal self- classification can, among some groups, be positively associated with non- violent criminal behavior compared to conservative self-classification. Psychological traits Associated factors include childhood conduct disorder, adult antisocial personality disorder (also associated with each other), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, minor depression, clinical depression, depression in the family, suicidal tendencies and schizophrenia. The American Psychological Association's 1995 report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns stated that the correlation between IQ and crime was -0.2. This association is generally regarded as small and prone to disappear or be substantially reduced after controlling for the proper covariates, being much smaller than typical sociological correlates. In his book The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability (1998), Arthur Jensen cited data which showed that IQ was generally negatively associated with crime among people of all races, peaking between 80 and 90. Learning disability is a substantial discrepancy between IQ and academic performance and is associated with crime. Slow reading development may be particularly relevant. It has also been shown, however, that the effect of IQ is heavily dependent on socioeconomic status and that it cannot be easily controlled away, with many methodological considerations being at play. Indeed, there is evidence that the small relationship is mediated by well-being, substance abuse, and other confounding factors that prohibit simple causal interpretation. A recent meta-analysis has shown that the relationship is only observed in higher risk populations such as those in poverty without direct effect, but without any causal interpretation. A nationally representative longitudinal study has shown that this relationship is entirely mediated by school performance. Several personality traits are associated with criminality: impulsivity, psychoticism, sensation-seeking, (low) self control, childhood aggression, low empathy and low altruism. Socioeconomic factors Socioeconomic status (usually measured using the three variables income (or wealth), occupational level, and years of education) correlates negatively with criminality, except for self-reported illegal drug use. Higher parental socioeconomic status probably has an inverse relationship with crime. Unstable employment and high frequency of unemployment correlate positively with criminality. Low socioeconomic status is thought to be positively correlated with higher levels of stress, and therefore the mental and psychological ill-effects of stress. These higher stress levels would probably be correlated positively with the propensity to commit a crime. Somewhat inconsistent evidence indicates a positive relationship between low income levels, the percentage of population under the poverty line, low education levels, and high income inequality in an area with more crime in said area. A 2013 study from Sweden argued that there was little effect of neighbourhood deprivation on criminality per se and rather that the higher rates of crime were due to observed and unobserved family and individual level factors, indicating that high-risk individuals were being selected into economically deprived areas. A World Bank study said, ‚ÄúCrime rates and inequality are positively correlated within countries and, particularly, between countries, and this correlation reflects causation from inequality to crime rates, even after controlling for other crime determinants.‚Äù Researchers in criminology have argued the effect of poverty upon crime is contextual: > As Levi (1997: 860) noted, macrolevel accounts ‚Äòseldom generate anything > close to a causal account which makes sense of nonviolence as well as of > violence‚Äô. Put another way, the vast majority of individuals who live in > conditions of poverty or disadvantage do not resort to violence at any time. > Hence, in order to understand the patterns of violence that actually occur, > it is imperative to study the social experiences of those who engage in it > (Athens 1992). Geographic factors Associated factors include areas with population size, neighborhood quality, residential mobility, tavern and alcohol density, gambling and tourist density, proximity to the equator, temperature (weather and season). The higher crime rate in the southern US largely disappears after controlling for non-climatic factors.  Parent/child relationships  Children whose parents did not want children are more likely to commit crimes. Such children are less likely to succeed in school, and are more likely to live in poverty. They tend to have lower mother-child relationship quality. Which cites:  Biosocial criminology and other analysis of environmental factors Biosocial criminology is an interdisciplinary field that aims to explain crime and antisocial behavior by exploring both biological factors and environmental factors. While contemporary criminology has been dominated by sociological theories, biosocial criminology also recognizes the potential contributions of fields such as genetics, neuropsychology and evolutionary psychology. Aggressive behavior has been associated with abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: * serotonin systems, * catecholamine systems, * and the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Abnormalities in these systems also are known to be induced by stress, either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress. In environmental terms, the theory that crime rates and lead exposure are connected, with increases in the latter causing increases in the former, has attracted much scientific analysis. In 2011, a report published by the official United Nations News Centre remarked, \\"Ridding the world of leaded petrol, with the United Nations leading the effort in developing countries, has resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, 1.2 million fewer premature deaths, higher overall intelligence and 58 million fewer crimes\\". The California State University did the specific study. Then U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) executive director Achim Steiner argued, \\"Although this global effort has often flown below the radar of media and global leaders, it is clear that the elimination of leaded petrol is an immense achievement on par with the global elimination of major deadly diseases.\\" See also * Causality * Criminology  Biosocial criminology  Environmental criminology  Lead and crime hypothesis * Gender differences in crime * Racial differences in crime References Sources Behavioural sciences Criminology Forensic psychology * ","title":"Statistical correlations of criminal behaviour"},{"id":"31235966","text":"is a public junior college in Miyako, Iwate, Japan.

Lurancy Vennum Lurancy Vennum Mary Lurancy Vennum was born in 1864 near Watseka, Illinois. In the summer of 1877 she suffered a series of epileptic fits, often lapsing into unconsciousness. After awakening, she told her family that she had been to heaven, had seen angels, and had visited her younger brother and sister who had died before her. As Vennum's fits became more frequent, physicians advised there was nothing more they could do, and by January 1878 it was decided she should be placed in an insane asylum. A neighbor and devout Spiritist Asa B. Roff convinced Vennum's parents not to commit her, and instead to call in a physician who was himself a Spiritist, E. Winchester Stevens. Spiritist investigation In 1878, physician and Spiritist E. Winchester Stevens examined Vennum. Stevens accounts were published in the leading Spiritist journal of the time, The Religio- Philosophical Journal, and later in an 1887 book entitled The Watseka Wonder in which he described Vennum as \\"the most remarkable case of spirit return and manifestation ever recorded in history.\\" According to Stevens, Vennum's character would change suddenly, from morose and sullen, to \\"mystic and imaginary trances\\" in which she described joyous trips to heaven and visits with angels. According to Stevens, Vennum often spoke in different voices and became several different people, including an old woman named Katrina Hogan and a young man named Willie Canning. Stevens claims she remembered the names of several people who had died and had possessed her body, and later chose to be possessed by the soul of Asa Roff's deceased daughter, Mary Roff. Psychical researcher Richard Hodgson of the American Society for Psychical Research was also convinced that Vennum was possessed by Roff's spirit. William James briefly mentioned the case in his book The Principles of Psychology (1890). James commented that it is \\"perhaps as extreme a case of 'possession' of the modern sort as one can find.\\"James, William. (1890). The Principles of Psychology. New York: Holt. pp. 396-398 Mary Roff According to Stevens and Hodgson, Vennum allowed Mary Roff to possess her body for about fifteen weeks during which time she could allegedly recognize all Roff's friends and relatives, was familiar with all of the objects in the Roff home, and could retell incidents and stories from Roff's childhood and her past life. Convinced that Vennum was a reincarnation of their daughter, the Roff family allowed the girl to live with them for several weeks. Stevens wrote that when Vennum later married, Roff's spirit supposedly inhabited Vennum, resulting in a painless childbirth for her.  Critics  Upon reviewing the case, psychologist Frank Sargent Hoffman regarded Vennum as \\"a typical case of hysterical impersonation\\" and wrote that there was no evidence Vennum had knowledge she could not have obtained by normal means. Hoffman wrote that the grieving Roff family \\"did everything in their power\\" to encourage Vennum \\"that she was their Mary.\\" Journalist Henry Addington Bruce characterized Vennum as \\"unduly suggestible\\", saying that \\"it may safely be declared that the phenomena manifested through Lurancy Vennum were not a whit more other-worldly than the phenomena produced by tricksters whom Hodgson himself so skillfully and mercifully exposed.\\" Bruce wrote that recurrences of the \\"Mary personality\\" appeared \\"only when the Roff's paid her visits, and that they ceased entirely upon her marriage to a man not interested in spiritism and her removal to a distant part of the country.\\"  Adaptations  An obscure syndicated radio program, Out of the Night, dramatized the case as \\"The Girl With the Dual Personality\\" sometime around 1949, a recording of which survives. DC Comics' horror anthology, House of Mystery (#5, August 1952), had a half page filler titled, \\"Double Mourning!\\" that briefly recounted the alleged facts of the Lurancy Vennum case. A fictionalized play based on the case, \\"Before I Wake\\", was produced and staged in 1986. It was written by William Wesbrooks, focusing on the Roffs who are mentioned as being the writer's great-great-grandparents. The play was reviewed as a thriller by The New York Times.Leah, Frank D.

From the ground, the satellite would appear to be standing still, hovering above the surface in the same spot, day after day. \\"Space Today Online - Answers To Your Questions\\", Spacetoday.org, 2010, webpage: ST-Sats. In practice, this is accomplished by matching the rotation of the surface below, by reaching a particular altitude where the orbital speed almost matches the rotation below, in an equatorial orbit. As the speed decreases slowly, then an additional boost would be needed to increase the speed back to a matching speed, or a retro-rocket could be fired to slow the speed when too fast. The stationary-orbit region of space is known as the Clarke Belt, named after British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, who published the idea in Wireless World magazine in 1945. A stationary orbit is sometimes referred to as a \\"fixed orbit\\". Stationary Earth orbit Around the Earth, stationary satellites orbit at altitudes of approximately . Writing in 1945, the science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke imagined communications satellites as travelling in stationary orbits, where those satellites would travel around the Earth at the same speed the globe is spinning, making them hover stationary over one spot on the Earth's surface. A satellite being propelled into place, into a stationary orbit, is first fired to a special equatorial orbit called a \\"geostationary transfer orbit\\" (GTO). Within this oval-shaped (elliptical) orbit, the satellite will alternately swing out to high and then back down to an altitude of only above the Earth (223 times closer). Then, at a planned time and place, an attached \\"kick motor\\" will push the satellite out to maintain an even, circular orbit at the 22,300-mile altitude. Stationary Mars orbit An areostationary orbit or areosynchronous equatorial orbit (abbreviated AEO) is a circular areo¬≠synchronous orbit in the Martian equatorial plane about above the surface, any point on which revolves about Mars in the same direction and with the same period as the Martian surface.

Mari√°ngel Ruiz and Luis Ger√≥nimo Abreu as the protagonists while Ver√≥nica Schneider, Astrid Carolina Herrera and Beba Rojas star as the antagonists. Plot \\"The Young Widow\\" is about a mysterious woman who has become a celebrity by marrying Baron Von Parker. She has an enormous fortune inherited from her last three husbands. With no known family, the Baroness \\"Inma Von Parker\\" is an enigmatic woman of extraordinary beauty that captivates men with incredible magnetism and charm. Her calm personality and self-control give her the ability to handle all situations around her, but also make her a suspect of having murdered her former husbands; however, nobody has ever been able to prove this. \\"Alejandro\\" is a police detective of humble origin, with a bright career in the Homicide Unit. Marked by betrayal, \\"Alejandro\\" has remained unmarried because of the woman who left him heartbroken. \\"Inma Von Parker\\" is suspected of orchestrating the death of her fourth husband. The press, the \\"Humboldt\\" family, and the Police Force are constantly, almost aggressively, seeking any clues that would finally help to clarify the secret of \\"The Young Widow\\" and expose her for the murderer that everybody thinks she is. The case is assigned to detective \\"Alejandro Abraham\\". Here the tragic past that both of them share comes to light. Inma sees her salvation in the man who she once loved, but the detective \\"Abraham\\" does not feel the same way any more. \\"Alejandro\\" is too hurt, so he takes on the case against the woman who unexpectedly disappeared from his life ‚Äì leaving him waiting at the church's altar during their wedding celebration- promising to get revenge upon her, and reveal her truly evil face to the world. Despite taking several years to get over the incident, ironically, after nine years, Inma reappears just as he meets \\"Abril Armas\\", a charming woman who has renewed his life and reawakened in him the hope of making a home. The crime perpetrated against Inma Von Parker's latest husband is a puzzle. Another husband dead. Another case out of which she comes victorious. Everything points to \\"Inma Von Parker\\", but there's nothing concrete to incriminate her. Then, several questions rise up in Alejandro's mind, bothering him like a stone in a shoe: is Inmaculada innocent or guilty?. The Baroness tries to get the detective emotionally wrapped, for she knows that their once great love is also their great enemy. A relationship of love and fear, passion and mistrust. Alejandro is obsessed with finding ways to catch Inmaculada or her accomplice. The detective is about to solve the riddle, but each time a witness can unravel part of the mystery, something happens to them: they vanish, change their minds, or die! Alejandro has to choose between a passionate love or serene love, a mysterious woman or a devoted wife. Two very different women that will fight a war without truce for the love of the same man.

Before Cornell, she taught at Rutgers University and has given courses in other international centers. She worked at the ILO for two years and has collaborated with other UN organizations, such as UNIFEM and UNDP, and with several NGOs. She obtained her PhD at Columbia University in 1975. In 1987 she acquired a position at Cornell University as Professor Emerita and taught until 2010. She was also the Director of the Gender and Global Change Program, as well as the Latin American Studies Program. Beneria spent her academic year between Ithaca and Barcelona as a senior associate member at the Inter- University Institute for the Study of Women and Gender. Her more recent work focused on the feminization of international migration and the care crisis in Europe. Beneria's work mainly revolved around development issues and on labor markets. In 2007, she was involved in a study of policies that sought to resolve issues regarding family and labor market work in the European Union, specifically in Spain and Latin America. The purpose of the study was to analyze the evolving policies of the labor market conditions in Europe, that were prevailing in developing countries. She collaborated with a UNFPA project that explored the problems faced within the Latin American region and participated in the virtual International Symposium on Gender and Social Cohesion as well.

Notable ideas  Lourdes Beneria, along with other feminists such as Jean Gardiner, Susan Himmelweit, Jane Humphries, Gita Sen, and Maxine Molyneux are credited with starting the conversation to differentiate Marxism from socialist feminism. This idea proposed that Marxism looks at the relationship of gender inequity to capitalism while socialist feminism examines the ways in which work and labor created systemic forces that reinforced patriarchy and white privilege.Seiz, Janet A. \\"Feminism(s).\\" The Elgar Companion to Feminist Economics, edited by Janice Peterson, and Margaret Lewis, Edward Elgar Publishing, 1st edition, 2004.

A British naval squadron commanded by Admiral Edward Codrington harassed the French besiegers with cannon fire and transported large numbers of reinforcements into the city by sea. Nevertheless, Suchet's troops stormed into the defenses and killed or captured almost all the defenders. The action took place at the port of Tarragona, Catalonia, on the east coast of Spain during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Emperor Napoleon offered Suchet a marshal's baton if he could capture Tarragona, so the French general pursued his goal vigorously. He methodically overran the city's outer works as he drove his siege parallels forward. The French general easily fended off weak attempts to relieve the city by land. Near the end of the siege, the French troops captured the lower city in a surprise attack and the garrison's survivors retreated to the upper city. At the end, Suchet's men stormed into the upper city amid scenes of horrific slaughter, including the murder of civilians. The loss of this major base and so many Spanish troops crippled the Army of Catalonia. Napoleon duly awarded Suchet the coveted rank of marshal. Results One authority gave French losses as 4,300 killed and wounded out of an army of 21,635 men, including General of Division Jean-Baptiste Salme killed. Total Spanish losses numbered between 14,000 and 15,000. Of these, 8,000 were captured and the rest were killed, wounded, or died of disease. During the butchery attending the final assault, the French attackers massacred numerous civilians including 450 women and children.Smith, p 365 A second authority asserted that total Spanish losses were 15,000, of whom 7,000 were killed outright. French losses were given as 1,000 killed and 3,000 wounded or sick.Gates, pp 300-301 See also * Juan Senen Contreras * Jean-Baptiste Salme Footnotes References * Gates, David.

He is the author of the book Unstoppable: From Underdog to Undefeated: How I Became a Champion (Gotham Books), which went on-sale September 27, 2012. Youth Robles was born with only one leg for unknown reasons, but refused to wear a prosthetic leg, removing it at the age of 3. Due to his leg missing all the way up to the hip, he has no stump to attach a prosthetic limb to. He endeavored to work around his missing leg, strengthening his body with various exercises. When Robles was in the sixth grade, he set a record for the most pushups by a member of his school. He began wrestling in the eighth grade, joining in while watching one of his older cousins practice. As a freshman in high school Robles had a record of 5‚Äì8 and ranked last in the city of Mesa, Arizona,Tonight Show, , 20 July 2011 disadvantaged by being 10 pounds underweight for his weight class. Robles benefited, however, from tremendous grip strength from his use of crutches. After intensive training, Robles found that he could use his unusually low center of gravity to defend against attack, and became skilled at several offensive moves including one he created. In his sophomore year, Robles was ranked sixth in Arizona, and won two state wrestling championships going 96‚Äì0 in his junior and senior years combined at Mesa High School. Robles won a national championship as a senior, finishing his high school wrestling career with a record of 129‚Äì15. Arizona State Despite Robles' great high school success, none of his top choices for college‚ÄîIowa, Oklahoma State, and Columbia‚Äîrecruited him, likely because of his missing leg. Robles redshirted as a freshman at Arizona State University, and finished 6th in the 2006 FILA Junior World Championships in the 55 kg Freestyle Wrestling category. He started his collegiate wrestling career in 2007‚Äì08, where he was nationally ranked and finished the year with a record of 25‚Äì11, falling just short of being named as an All-American. In his second competitive year as a collegiate wrestler (2008‚Äì2009), Robles earned All-American Honors, finishing the year 29‚Äì8, winning the Pacific-10 Conference championship at 125 pounds and finishing fourth in the NCAA Championship's 125 pound weight class tournament. In 2009‚Äì10, Robles again earned All-American honors, finishing seventh in the NCAA 125 pound weight class, going 32‚Äì4 on the season, and repeating as the Pac-10 125 pound wrestling champion. In Robles' final year of eligibility (2010‚Äì11), he went undefeated, going 36‚Äì0 on the year, becoming a three-time Pac-10 champion (defeating Jason Lara from Oregon State in the final, and a national champion, defeating the defending 125-pound NCAA Champion, Iowa's Matt McDonough, 7‚Äì1 in the final. For his efforts, Robles was voted the Tournament's Most Outstanding Wrestler. The 5'8\\" Robles concluded his Arizona State wrestling career with a record of 122‚Äì23, a three-time Pac-10 wrestling champion as well as a three-time All-American. Robles ranks 8th for most match wins by an Arizona State wrestler. Future Robles has stated that he wishes to become a motivational speaker, specifically for those who face similar challenges. ‚Äú\\" My spirit is unconquerable...I don't care what's probable. Through blood, sweat, and tears, I am unstoppable.\\" is the quote from Robles's book Unstoppable that he says is the overall message of the book. Anthony Robles has been a commentator of the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships since 2012. Robles set the world record for most pull-ups in one minute, with 62, at halftime of a New York Jets game in November 2018. Awards and honors In January 2012, Robles was presented the 2011 Most Courageous Athlete Award by the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association.

According to this concept, a person who perceives him- or herself as stigmatized can attribute negative feedback to prejudice. This can lead stigmatized group members to feel uncertainty about whether negative outcomes are due to discrimination against them or their own behavior. In comparison, they might discredit positive feedback as a form of sympathy rather than seeing it as the result of their ability and achievement. The term was coined by Jennifer Crocker, Brenda Major and their colleagues. Implications Attributional ambiguity can have unfortunate repercussions for members of stigmatized groups. Members of groups that are ‚Äòstereotype- vulnerable‚Äô or are often stereotyped are at greater risk of having less self- worth through the lens of attributional ambiguity. With this concept, when people of an often stigmatized group receive feedback, they are unsure what the basis is for that feedback and believe it could have been attributed to things other than performance alone. Whether it is positive or negative feedback they face uncertainty about how accurate that feedback was and thus feeling uncertain about how to interpret the responses. In the absence of true feedback one cannot totally rely on that evaluation and thus cannot adjust their behavior or performance accordingly. Attributional ambiguity can be applied in a very broad sense, considering how often people seek feedback. In academics, athletics, relationships, etc. are all areas in which feedback can be pivotal. For example, if it is known that a manager is very sensitive to his/her subordinates‚Äô feelings, and he/she gives positive feedback, it is unclear if that feedback was true or simply an action of sensitivity. Empirical support In an experiment conducted by Jennifer Crocker, Brenda Major and colleagues, women who were evaluated unfavorably by a blatantly prejudiced evaluator experienced less negative affect than women who were rated unfavorably by an unbiased evaluator. With African American participants, it was found that when reviewed negatively African Americans were more likely to attribute the evaluator's negativity to prejudice than were white participants. Furthermore, African Americans were likely to attribute both negative and positive reviews to prejudice if they could be seen by the evaluator. Being visible (and thus vulnerable to being stereotyped based on race) helped African Americans cope with negative reviews, but also made them more likely to discredit positive reviews. The same concept can be applied not only to race, ethnicity, gender, etc., but appearance as well. The extent to which one views his/herself as attractive can affect how they perceive feedback. A study by Major, Carrington & Carnevale (1984) found that, as described above, the attractive participants were less likely to believe positive feedback given to them, believing that the observer had an ulterior motive. When the observer could see the attractive participant, they doubted the true motive behind their positive feedback. Unattractive participants were more likely to believe positive feedback than were attractive participants. When an ulterior motive is possible, it is easier to discount the feedback whether it is positive or negative. (See also Lookism.) C. L. Hoyt and colleagues examined attributional ambiguity in Latino subjects as compared to white subjects. They found that when given a negative review Latino subjects were more likely to attribute this negativity to the prejudice of the examiner than white subjects. They also found that when given a positive review, Latino subjects were more likely to discredit the positivity of the reviewer and experience a lower sense of well being than their white counterparts. This research suggests that while attributional ambiguity can be used as a buffer to protect the self from negative reviews and biased thoughts, it can also prevent stigmatized groups from embracing reviews.

Historically the line from Plochingen to Rottweil, including the Plochingen‚ÄìT√ºbingen railway and part of the Stuttgart‚ÄìHattingen railway (sometimes called the G√§ubahn‚Äî\\"G√§u Railway\\") was known as the Obere Neckarbahn (\\"Upper Neckar Railway\\"). History The original Upper Neckar Railway opened from Plochingen to Reutlingen in 1859. It was extended via T√ºbingen to Rottenburg in 1861. The next section from Rottenburg to Eyach was opened in 1864 and the last section from Eyach to Horb was opened in 1866. Historically, the Upper Neckar railway included the section of line between Plochingen and T√ºbingen, now called the Neckar-Alb Railway. Passenger operations  Rottenburg station Regionalbahn services are operated on the line by DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee (RAB), a subsidiary of DB Regio, together with the Nagold Valley Railway as part of the Kulturbahn (\\"culture railway\\"). Between T√ºbingen and Rottenburg services run at half-hour intervals. Services run approximately hourly on the line to Horb, in order to connect with InterCity services to and from Zurich and Regional- Express trains to and from Singen. The line is operated with diesel multiple units of class 611 and class 650.3. =Freight operations = In the morning of one to two work days per week, trains of the Hohenzollern Landesbahn (HzL) run on the line from T√ºbingen freight yard, carrying scrap and timber to Mengen. In Eyach the train runs on to HzL‚Äôs own line, the Eyach‚ÄìHechingen railway. These trains are hauled by MaK V 100 PA locomotives. Between Eyach and Horb there is no regular freight traffic any more. All sidings of the line are closed down and/or blocked off. For example, the Rottenburg freight yard was redeveloped years for a new bus station. Planning  For several years it has been planned to establish new or reactivated stations on the T√ºbingen‚ÄìRottenburg section, including at Buhl, Kilchberg and Weilheim. However, this would require sections of double track.Gemeinderatsvorlage 274/2004 (T√ºbingen) The electrification of the line has been discussed on several occasions as a diversion route for the G√§u Railway between Horb and Stuttgart. For several years discussion have been under way on plans to integrate the line with the Neckar-Alb Railway line, together with other regional lines (Ammer Valley Railway, Erms Valley Railway, Swabian Alb Railway and the Zollernalb Railway), into the Neckar-Alb Regional Stadtbahn on the Karlsruhe model. This would require electrification of the lines. Because of the general financial situation, however, implementation is not currently in sight. It is planned in the long run to integrate train control technology on the line, along with the Nagold Valley Railway and the Zollernalb Railway, with the regional electronic interlocking in Freudenstadt.

After the hotel closed in 1902 Ralph Munroe established Camp Biscayne nearby so there would be a place for visitors to stay. The city of Miami purchased the private property in 1934 for $63,500 ($ in 2015 U.S. dollars) and established it as the public Coconut Grove Bayfront Park, renamed in honor of the aforementioned Peacocks in 1973. Considered the Miami equivalent of the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York, during the 1960s the park and surrounding Coconut Grove area became notable as a center for hippies and the youth counterculture, hosting several be-ins and concerts during the latter part of the decade. Nearby Dinner Key hosted a now-infamous Doors concert where lead singer Jim Morrison allegedly exposed himself in 1969. Park amenities include a baseball field, basketball court, tennis court, playground, peacock aviary, and skatepark. The adjacent Kenneth M.

Course Forge River (which was once called the Wegonthotak RiverStrong, John A. (2013-02-14). The Unkechaug Indians of Eastern Long Island. University of Oklahoma Press.) is the major tributary of Moriches Bay, a part of Long Island‚Äôs south shore bay system that is protected from the Atlantic Ocean by outer barrier islands. The river is a remnant stream bed cut through the southerly sloping glacial out- wash plain deposited during the Wisconsin glaciation that ended some 20,000 years ago. The stream valley flooded as sea level rose. It now functions as a small estuary. Circulation in the river is complex and is driven by a variety of forces including the tides, water column density structure, groundwater discharge, stream flow, and wind. The tidal portion of the river is 3.2 nautical miles long that ends abruptly at Montauk Highway which serves as a dam between the river towns of Mastic and Moriches New York. Two freshwater ponds (East Mill Pond and West Mill Pond) continuously discharge to the tidal Forge at this location. The surface watershed of the river is 43.06 km2 (10.641 acres). About 20 percent of the watershed is in the deep groundwater recharge zone. The river is shallow throughout and has been historically so. The mean depths in much of the center of the river were about (4-4.5 ft) at mean low water. The centerline, mean depth, based on the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS) survey of 2007-2008, is(4.9- 6.6 ft). The depth now is slightly deeper in some locations than indicated on the previous surveys because a 70-m-wide (75-yd-wide) channel has been dredged to a design depth of 2.1 m (7 ft). Tributaries of the river including Wills Creek, Poospatuck Creek, Lons Creek, and Home Creek on the west side of the Forge have been dredged as well. The depths in these creeks can be as great as (6.6 ft). A sill has built up at the mouths of these tributaries so that each one acts as a small basin in which circulation is limited. The same is true for Old Neck Creek on the east side of the river. The upland community of the William Floyd Estate provides habitat for breeding American woodcock (Scolopax minor) and a variety of migrating and nesting songbirds, while adjacent tidal areas afford habitat for nesting American bittern (Botarus lentiginosus), seaside sparrow, and osprey. This area is one of the few remaining sites on the south shore of Long Island where tidal wetlands are contiguous with an undeveloped upland buffer. Duck farming off the river The impairment of Moriches Bay was linked with the growth of the duck ranching industry decades earlier along the Forge and other tributaries of region. Duck farm activities were identified as a primary source of pollution to Moriches Bay in several studies conducted by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) investigators between 1950 and 1959. One of several measures used to attribute duck ranching with intense pollution problems was the unusually high amounts of duck-derived phosphorus in waters proximate to duck farming sites. The last of the farms, the Jurgielewicz Duck Farm (founded in 1919) closed in August 2011 after declaring bankruptcy. At its peak, the 65 acre farm (which was a landmark on the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road) claimed to be America's largest free-range duck operation, raising 1 million Pekin ducks a year.

Retreating from the city, he hoped that his time in Arles would evoke in his work the simple, yet dramatic expression of Japanese art. Height of Van Gogh's career At the time that van Gogh painted this portrait he was 35 years old. Living in Arles in southern France, he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work. His paintings represented different aspects of ordinary life, such as Harvest at La Crau and this painting, La Mousm√©. The sunflower paintings, some of the most recognizable of van Gogh's paintings, were created in this time. He worked continuously to keep up with his ideas for paintings. This is likely one of van Gogh's happier periods of life. He is confident, clear- minded and seemingly content. In a letter to his brother, Theo, he wrote, \\"Painting as it is now, promises to become more subtle - more like music and less like sculpture - and above all, it promises color.\\" As a means of explanation, van Gogh explains that being like music means being comforting. A prolific time, in less than 444 days van Gogh made about 100 drawings and produced more than 200 paintings. Yet, he still found time and energy to write more than 200 letters. While he painted quickly, mindful of the pace farmers would need to work in the hot sun, he spent time thinking about his paintings long before he put brush to canvas. The painting Inspired by Pierre Loti's novel Madame Chrysanth√®me and Japanese artwork, van Gogh painted La Mousm√©, a well-dressed Japanese girl. He wrote in a letter to his brother: \\"It took me a whole week...but I had to reserve my mental energy to do the mousm√© well. A mousm√© is a Japanese girl‚ÄîProven√ßal in this case‚Äîtwelve to fourteen years old.\\" Van Gogh's use of color is intended to be symbolic. The audience is drawn in by his use of contracting patterns and colors that bring in an energy and intensity to the work. Complementary shades of blue and orange, a stylistic deviation from colors of Impressionist paintings that he acquired during his exploration in Paris, stand out against the spring-like pale green in the background. La Mousm√©'s outfit is a blend of modern and traditional. Her outfit is certainly modern. The bright colors of skirt and jacket are of the southern region of Arles. Regarding van Gogh's painting of her features, his greatest attention is focused on the girls face, giving her the coloring of a girl from Arles, but with a Japanese influence. The young lady's posture mimics that of the oleander. The flowering oleander, like the girl, is in the blossoming stage of life. Van Gogh said of portrait studies, such as La Mousm√©, \\"the only thing in painting that excites me to the depths of my soul, and which makes me feel the infinite more than anything else.\\" The painting is part of the National Gallery of Art collection in Washington, D.C. Provenance * Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, the artist's sister-in-law, of Amsterdam had the painting until May 1909. Five paintings that were sold by Johanna became part of the National Gallery of Art collection. * In May 1909 the painting was sold to J.H. de Bois, an art dealer and director of The Hague branch of the C.M. Van Gogh gallery. C.M. van Gogh was Vincent's uncle. * After May 1909 the painting was sold to Carl Sternheim (1878‚Äì1942), German playwright and art collector of Munich. In 1912 he and his wife moved to La Hulpe, Belgium. By 1933 Sternheim's work was banned by the Nazis. * By 1917 art collector and dealer Alphonse Kann (1870‚Äì1948) of Paris, had the painting. * J.B. Stang of Oslo had the painting until 1928. * On 3 January 1928 La Mousm√© was sold through Dr. Alfred Gold, an art dealer of Berlin specializing in French paintings, to joint owners Alex Reid and Lef√®vre gallery of Glasgow and London and M. Knoedler & Co. of New York, art dealer to some of America's wealthiest individuals. * The painting was sold 21 May 1929 through Galerie √âtienne Bignou, Paris to Chester Dale (1883‚Äì1962) of New York. * In 1963 the painting was bequeathed to the National Gallery of Art and placed in the Dale Chester Collection. Chester Dale, as passionate and successful in his art collection as he was on the Wall Street, bequeathed in 1962 some of America's most important collections of French painting from the late 19th and early 20th centuries to the National Gallery of Art.

Bull Demon King (), also translated as the Ox- King and known as his self-proclaimed title the Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven, is a fictional character from the 16th century novel Journey to the West. He is the husband of the Princess Iron Fan and father of Red Boy. He is a demon king based in Sky Scraping Cave (Êë©Èõ≤Ê¥û) on Accumulated Thunder Mountain (Á©çÈõ∑Â±±). Bull King is a major antagonist of the novel Journey to the West by the late Wu Cheng'en, and its multiple adaptations. He can actually be considered to be the main antagonist of the story, despite his limited appearances. He also appears as the main villain in the 2014 film The Monkey King and Doraemon: The Record of Nobita's Parallel Visit to the West as the main antagonist. He is one of the most popular Journey to the West villains, alongside his wife Princess Iron Fan, his son the Red Boy, the Six Eared Macaque, and the Baigujing. Part in Journey to the West In the early chapters of the novel, he becomes sworn brothers with Sun Wukong and six other demon kings, the Saurian Demon King (ËõüÈ≠îÁéã), the Single-horned Demon King (ÂñÆËßíÈ≠îÁéã), the Roc Demon King (Èµ¨È≠îÁéã), the Lion Spirit King (ÁçÖÁãîÁéã), the Macaque Spirit King (ÁçºÁå¥Áéã) and the Snub-nosed monkey Spirit King (Á¶∫Áã®Áéã). He is ranked the most senior of the seven, and styles himself \\"Great Sage Who Pacifies Heaven\\" (Âπ≥Â§©Â§ßËÅñ). He marries Princess Iron Fan and has a son, Red Boy, with her. He appears again in a later chapter when the protagonists arrive at the Flaming Mountains along their journey. Sun Wukong disguises himself as Bull Demon King to deceive Princess Iron Fan and takes away her Banana Leaf Fan. The real Bull Demon King visits Princess Iron Fan, who then realises she has been tricked. Bull Demon King disguises himself as Zhu Bajie to trick Sun Wukong and retrieves the fan.

In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding, which in effect saw Korrelocking as one of the first five bulk wheat locations on the Western Australian Government Railways network, and a site of the beginning of bulk wheat handling in Western Australia The name of the town is an Aboriginal word for a nearby well that had been recorded when the area had been surveyed in 1892. The meaning of the name is not known. A bioblitz was conducted in 2012 in a bush reserve between Korrelocking and Wyalkatchem. 54 people took part and collected samples of scorpions, pseudoscorpions, isopods, spiders and centipedes, including some new species.

They have become common and have gained attention especially in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, economic capital and capital city of the Sindh province. Several targeted killings have also occurred in Quetta, the capital of the southern province of Balochistan. Police and law enforcement agencies have sometimes come under criticism for their ineffectiveness in locating the perpetrators and investigating their motives. For most part, targeted killings in Karachi have been attributed to political, religious and ethnic reasons. There are speculations about the killing but no real proof has been found against any party. Background Karachi is a cosmopolitan city and consists of many ethnic communities; the city's demographics play an important role in its politics. Ethnic politics have resulted in sporadic violence throughout Karachi's history, often leading to bloody conflicts. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Muslim immigrants from areas constituting modern-day India migrated in large numbers to the Muslim nation of Pakistan and became settled in Karachi, the historical capital of the Sindh province. The early migrants who came and settled are known as Muhajirs, something which was resented by a portion of the province's native Sindhi people and radical Sindhi nationalists. After the breakaway of East Pakistan in 1971 and the formation of Bangladesh, Pakistan accepted a large number of Biharis (known as \\"Stranded Pakistanis\\") loyal to the country, trapped in Bangladesh and offered them citizenship. The Bihari migrants assimilated into the diverse Urdu-speaking Muhajir population. Some Bengalis in Pakistan also stayed behind. The Pashtuns (Pakhtuns or Pathans), originally from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, FATA and northern Balochistan, are now the city's second largest ethnic group in Karachi after Muhajirs. With as high as 7 million by some estimates, the city of Karachi in Pakistan has the largest concentration of urban Pakhtun population in the world, including 50,000 registered Afghan refugees in the city. As per current demographic ratio Pashtuns are about 25% of Karachi's population. Karachi's status as a regional industrial centre attracted migrants from other parts of Pakistan as well, including Punjab, Balochistan and Pashtun migrants from the frontier regions. Added to this were Iranians, Arabs, Central Asians as well as thousands of Afghan refugees who came to Karachi, initially displaced by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; some of the Afghan and Pashtun migration brought along conservative tribal culture, further intensifying ethnic and sectarian violence and also giving rise to mob culture.Karachi - Daily Sun Prominent victims of target killings :This list is incomplete.

He is a first cousin of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin He is the Chairman of Igor Putin Fund, an investment company supporting and developing the industry in outlying regions of Russia. Early life Igor Putin was born in Leningrad to the family of a Soviet military officer Alexander Putin, a younger brother of Vladimir Putin senior, father of the Russian President. Soon the family moved to Kovrov and then to Ryazan, where Alexander Putin served as an instructor in Ryazan Military Higher School (Ryazanskoye Vysheye Komandnoye Avtombilnoye Uchilische). Igor Putin graduated from Ryazan Military Higher School in 1974. Career In 1974‚Äì1998 Igor Putin served in the Soviet Army and then in Russian Army. In 1998 he retired from the military and moved to Ryazan. In 1998‚Äì2000 he worked in Ryazan Oblast Statistics Committee. In 2000‚Äì2005 he worked as the chairman of the Ryazan Licensing Chamber.

In October 2006 Igor Putin changed his political affiliations from the United Russia to A Just Russia political party, but his political uplifting was halted by his cousin who did not want to develop nepotism within the government In 2007 he became a director of AVTOVAZBANK. In September 2010, Igor Putin became Vice President of Master Bank. In the same month, the bank received a lucrative contract with Russian Nanotechnology Corporation. Still Igor Putin held the vice president position only a few months and retired in December 2010. In February 2012, he invested in the development of the Murmansk port. At that time, he also owned 51% of Energiya, 40% of Avangard 500, and 25% of Gorizont TV. As of 2013, as Board Chairman of Pechenga International Sea Port, he was a member the Government Marine Board. Money laundering His retirement coincided with a criminal investigation in which over 30 million Russian roubles was allegedly stolen from the bank by its employees using IT technologies. The investigation accused a leading IT specialist of the bank, Mery Tevanyan of operating a large illegal business with the daily volume up to 500 million Russian roubles using bank's money. In March 2011, five days after conclusion of the investigations Igor Putin returned to the bank as a director. According to the bank he is not supposed to manage its daily operations. Igor Putin also keeps his position as a director of the AVTOVAZBANK. In November 2013, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the banking licence of Master Bank following money- laundering scandals. Igor Putin was director of the Board of the bank at the time of the scandal, and had previously served as Vice-President. In 2014, a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) exposed a $20-billion money-laundering scheme between Russian banks and the Moldovan bank Moldindconbank, scheme where the Russian Land Bank wired $5 billion to the Moldovan bank. Igor Putin was a director of Land Bank, and declared to Forbes Russia that he quit this position when he grew uncomfortable about the suspicious activities of the bank. Other banks associated with Igor Putin were involved in a massive money laundering scheme dubbed the Russian Laundromat. The system moved money through Putin's and other banks using fake loans between offshore, paper companies, bribed Moldovan judges and Moldovan and Latvian banks to move money out of Russia and into Europe. The UK company Lantana Trade LLP, owned by Igor Putin, was the company that triggered the attention of the whistleblower Howard Wilkinson who broke the story after he noticed Lantana Trade was filed dormant in the UK while millions of dollars were going in and out of the company's bank account in Estonia. The OCCRP originally exposed The operation involved $230 billion transferred through Danske Bank. The Russky Zemelny Bank, in which Igor Putin was an investor, shut down that same year for suspicious activities related to a 20-billion money-laundering affair. Igor Putin resigned from the Board of Directors of the Russkiy Zemelny Bank, Promyshlenny Sberegatelny Bank and the construction company Yakut. In 2017, the banker Alexei Kulikov was arrested for illegally pumping $10 billion out of the country through Promersbank, a bank that held Igor Putin on its Board at the time of this arrest.
