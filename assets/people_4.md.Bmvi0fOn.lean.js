Strong winds spread the fire during a hot, dry period of weather killing at least eight people, six of whom were in Spain. Some of the wildfires were caused by lightning, along with arson and military training.  Effects  Four Spanish firefighters died in Catalonia on 21 July, and a fifth member died later from injuries on 23 July, as well as a fire engine driver in Teruel. A further two people died from bush fires in Sardinia. More than 120 people were rescued at Capo Pecora on Sardinia by helicopter and civil protection boats. The Arenas prison complex was evacuated and the inmates were temporarily transferred to the beach. Wildfire near Genoa, Italy in September Northern and central Spain saw temperatures of around on 21 July. Around 2,000 people were evacuated from hills around the town of Collado Mediano, near Madrid. Aircraft with water and firefighters controlled the fire. Estimates suggest that 5,000 hectares of forest and bush were affected in the Sierra Cabrera mountain range between Turre and Moj√°car in Spain on 14‚Äì15 July. 500 people were evacuated, as dozens of firefighters and soldiers controlled the fires, including the use of five helicopters and three aircraft. On 23 July, the fires on the Sierra Cabrera on which Moj√°car sits flared again, causing damage to the village and other houses in the area and the evacuation of around 1,500 residents. Outside the French city of Marseille, 1,300 hectares (3211 acres) were destroyed. In Corsica, wildfires led to the destruction of approximately 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) of bush and forest resulting in the injuries of five firemen. More than 320 wildfires affected patches of forest across Greece, although they did affect buildings. Most of them were located on the island of Euboea and the southern Peloponnese. On 23 July, over 15 hectares of land were destroyed in a landfill site in Bodrum, southwestern Turkey. Over 200 volunteers and 100 firefighters tried to contain the fires across Turkey, which saw temperatures of on 25‚Äì26 July.  Causes  Fire in Cagliari, Sardinia In the Mediterranean region, the current fire frequency due to human activity is considered much larger than the natural rate. 95% of forest fires in Spain are human-induced. The 2009 Mediterranean wildfires occurred during a particularly hot and dry summer period, increasing the risk of wildfires burning out of control once ignited. Temperatures peaked at in mainland Spain and reached in Gran Canaria. These conditions, combined with insufficient fire-fighting resources and an inadequate official response in some of the affected countries, exacerbated the extent of the damage. Uncontrolled legal and illegal scrub burning by farmers is a major cause of forest fires in the Mediterranean region. Arson, while still a significant factor, has diminished in Spain and Greece in recent years. Decreasing property values generally and the introduction of legislation in Spain to tackle the issue has diminished the financial incentive to illegally clear forested land for development by burning. Isolated cases of areas in Spain affected by fires caused by lightning strikes include Aragon (Spain), as reported by El Pais and Moj√°car, as suggested by the Spanish Forest Fire Organisation (INFOCA). The wildfires outside of Marseille, France were reported as being caused by military training using tracer bullets. The local government of Corsica believed the fires were caused by arson.

They specialize in acoustic guitars and semi-hollow electric guitars. The company was founded in 1974 by Bob Taylor and Kurt Listug.  History  In 1972, at age 18, Bob Taylor began working at American Dream, a guitar-making shop owned by Sam Radding, where Kurt Listug was already an employee. When Radding decided to sell the business in 1974, Taylor, Listug, and a third employee, Steve Schemmer, bought American Dream and renamed it the Westland Music Company. Needing a more compact logo suitable for the guitars' headstock, the founders decided to change the name to Taylor as it sounded more American than Listug. Kurt Listug said, \\"Bob was the real guitar-maker.\\" Listug became the partnership's businessman while Taylor handled design and production. In 1976, the company decided to sell their guitars through retailers. In 1981, facing financial difficulties, Taylor Guitars took out a bank loan to purchase equipment. As of 2012 Taylor Guitars had more than 700 employees in two factories: one in El Cajon, California, and the other in nearby Tecate, Mexico, where the company makes their lower-priced models and guitar cases. In early 2011, the company opened a Taylor distribution warehouse in the Netherlands to serve the European market. In January 2014, the U.S. State Department honored Taylor Guitars with an Award for Corporate Excellence (ACE) citing Taylor's commitment to responsible practices in obtaining ebony for its instruments, which notably included purchasing their own sustainable ebony mill and increasing its usable timber from 10% to 100%.  Innovations  In 1995, Bob Taylor was interested in finding out if the perception of using exotic tonewoods in quality guitars was more important than luthier techniques and good design. Taylor recovered some oak from shipping pallets found at the factory for the Pallet Guitar's back and sides and used a nondescript 2x4 for the dreadnought's top. The guitar's neck was also made from oak recovered from the pallet and the fretboard features a Formica and pearl inlay, depicting a fork lift. In 2000, a limited edition of 25 of the Grand Auditorium-bodied Pallet Guitars were reproduced with aluminum inlay included to accentuate the original nail holes in the pallet wood. These Pallet Guitars have been sold to collectors, but the original Pallet Guitar remains on display at the Taylor Guitars factory in El Cajon, California. In January 1999, Taylor began making guitars with a patented, bolt-on neck they called the NT (new technology) neck. It differs from other guitar necks by using one continuous piece of wood all the way to the 19th fret to support the fretboard. More common practice in guitar neck construction is to support the fretboard up to the fourteenth fret, and glue the unsupported portion to the soundboard. The NT neck fits into a pocket on the top of the guitar body, achieving the desired angle with small shims. Guitars sometimes require a neck angle realignment (neck reset). Taylor's system achieves this by changing the shims to adjust the neck angle. Prior to 1999, Taylor Guitars had a simpler bolt-on neck design. Those necks can also be adjusted without the more complex process of ungluing the neck joint. Taylor uses their own pickup system, the \\"Expression System,\\" which consists of a humbucking induction pickup mounted in the neck and a pair of dynamic soundboard transducers wired to an onboard preamplifier designed by Rupert Neve. The entry-level 100 and 200 series use an externally similar system known as ES-T, which uses a single under-saddle pickup and no soundboard transducers. The first generation ES system was introduced in 2004. It had 2 transducers: one mounted to the bridge, and one on the lower bout of the sound board. Also, it had a small single coil neck pickup mounted in the neck joint. All wired to the onboard preamp which has 3 knobs for volume, tone, and blend. This early ES system and was available on the higher end models 500 series and above as well as the 30th anniversary limited edition series starting in the fall of 2004. It was a custom order for the 300 and 400 series, and could be retro fitted to some older Taylor guitars with the NT neck design.  Factory  Taylor's 145,000 square foot manufacturing facility is about 20 miles east of downtown San Diego in El Cajon, California. A free, guided tour of the Taylor Guitars factory is open to the public at 1:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except some holidays. For those too far away to visit the factory, Premier Guitars published a four-part tour of the Taylor Factory, narrated by Bob Taylor in 2008.

A case of corporate fraud, for instance, might be settled by means of a deferred-prosecution agreement in which the defendant agrees to pay fines, implement corporate reforms, and fully cooperate with the investigation. Fulfillment of the specified requirements will then result in dismissal of the charges. United States Since 1999, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has set forth guidelines concerning the prosecution of business organizations and corporations.Corporate Prosecution Principles Resource Page The United States Attorneys' Manual (USAM) of the DOJ allows consideration of non-prosecution or deferred prosecution of corporate criminal offenses because of collateral consequences and discusses plea agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, and non-prosecution agreements in general.United States Attorneys' Manual ¬ß 9-28.1000 (2008) Collateral ConsequencesUnited States Attorneys' Manual ¬ß 9-16.325 (2008) Plea Agreements, Deferred Prosecution Agreements, Non-Prosecution Agreements and \\"Extraordinary Restitution\\" Under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, a past deferred prosecution will not count toward a defendant's criminal history, if there was no finding of guilt by a court and the defendant did not plead guilty or otherwise admit guilt in open court. This is in contrast to a deferred disposition, which typically does involve such a finding or admission. According to Rachel Barkow and Anthony Barkow of NYU Law School,Ross, Colin. \\"Prosecutors in the Boardroom \\", mainjustice.com (June 30, 2011). there has been a dramatic increase in the use of DPAs and NPAs by federal prosecutors, increasing from 11 instances between 1993 and 2001, to 23 between 2002 and 2005, to 66 between 2006 and 2008. This kind of regulation-by-prosecutor has also occurred at the state level, for example at the New York Attorney General‚Äôs Office under Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo. Outside monitors are appointed in about half of all DPAs. Canada Discussions about the potential establishment of deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) legislation in Canada began in February 2016. Prior to the DPA, Canada already had \\"prosecutorial discretion\\" in place, which \\"made it possible for offending companies to negotiate a non-criminal penalty for a criminal act\\". In June 2018 Canada enacted a DPA through provisions in the omnibus budget implementation Bill C-74, that amended the Criminal Code. According to the Law Times, the DPA changes the way Canadian courts prosecute white-collar crime which includes a remediation system whereby offenders can avoid conviction if \\"they co-operate with the Crown and the courts\\". The Times, cited Ottawa-based counsel Patrick McCann, who said that the DPA would \\"bring Canada in line with many other countries that have deferred prosecution agreements, including the U.S., the U.K. and most other European countries\\". According to McCann, the DPA \\"addresses the unfairness of the situation when you have a large company that has a rogue senior officer\\" who has committed a crime with the entire company getting blamed. McCann said that the DPA is fair to investors in companies who are innocent of any wrongdoing. The legislation states that, in the case of Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the prosecutor \\"must not consider the national economic interest, the potential effect on relations with a state other than Canada or the identity of the organization or individual involved.\\" See also *Plea bargain *Diversion program (deferred disposition) *Deferred Adjudication (term used within the State of Texas) ReferencesExternal links *Regulating the 'new regulators': current trends in deferred prosecution agreements United States criminal procedure Prosecution ","title":"Deferred prosecution"},{"id":"23743206","text":"Yeh Dil Maange More! is an advertising slogan coined for Pepsi at JWT by Anuja Chauhan in 1998. It combines Hindi and English, and literally meaning This Heart Desires More, which later became a popular slogan. The slogan and its derivatives have been used in multiple contexts in India. The worldwide Pepsi commercial featuring the song, Ask for More, written by Janet Jackson was released in November 2007, later released a single in January 2008.[ Billboard - Janet Jackson's Discography]MTV - Janet Jackson - Ask For More (Pepsi Single) History The slogan has its origins as a commercial slogan for Pepsi advertisement in 1998, at JWT by Anuja Chauhan who eventually became Vice President and Executive Creative Director at JWT, Delhi, and author of books like, The Zoya Factor (2008). Thereafter it soon gained mass popularity, and became a battle slogan and rallying cry, first used by Capt. Vikram Batra, an officer of the Indian Army, during the 1999 Kargil War and widely reported in the media. Captain Batra was martyred during the war in July 1999 was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honour. The slogan continues to be a part of the Indian popular culture. In 2004, it was used as a title for a Bollywood movie, Dil Maange More starring Shahid Kapoor. Pepsi advertisement The slogan was coined as a tagline for a Pepsi television advertisement series that first ran in December 1998 and sought to establish Pepsi as a strong brand with Indian youth. It was a continuation of Pepsi's advertising campaign in the mid-to-late nineties, which it had initially launched as an ambush marketing effort against Coca-Cola during the 1996 Cricket World Cup. The ads featured prominent sports personalities and film stars, such as Sachin Tendulkar, Shahrukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, and Pawan Kalyan and were directed by Prahlad Kakkar, a veteran ad film director. The catchphrase became a runaway success and other business entities sought to appropriate it in their messaging. Pepsi litigated actively to assert an exclusive right to use the slogan.

The hotel is known to have hosted a large number of royals in the past. History The hotel, originally named The Angel, started as a hostel built by the Knights Templar in 1203 on Great North Road, which, at the time passed, through the centre of Grantham. The hostelry was run by the Knights until their dissolution in 1312. The hostel started developing into a coaching inn over the years. In 1812 the Inn was sold by Lord Brownlow to Sir William Manners, along with his other property in Grantham. In 2002 the hotel was purchased by Ashdale Hotels and underwent extensive renovation. =Royal visits= A number of English royals are known to have stayed at The Angel. The first to stay was King John, who held court at the hotel on 23 February 1213. Edward III and Queen Philippa stayed at the hotel in the 14th century; their heads are carved on the front of the building. On 19 October 1483 Richard III held court at the inn. It was from the \\"Chambre de' Roi\\" that he sent a letter requesting for the Great Seal to issue the death warrant against his cousin, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham for his instigation of Buckingham's rebellion. Copies of the letter, the original of which is kept by the British Museum, are displayed in the hotel's dining room. After this, the next royal to visit was Charles I who stayed on 17 May 1633 to receive homage from the alderman of Grantham at the time, Henry Ferman. Oliver Cromwell, fighting against Charles, quartered troops at The Angel in 1643 during the English Civil War, after a successful battle near Grantham. George IV stayed on a number of occasions in the 19th century. Edward VII, who was the Prince of Wales at the time, stayed in 1866. =Construction= The Angel and Royal consists of a number of buildings surrounding an internal courtyard open at both ends, to allow the passage of coach and horses when the hotel still operated as a coaching inn. The arched doorway at the front of the building is the oldest part of the facade, originating from the 14th century, as do parts of the courtyard buildings. The heads of Edward III and Philippa are carved on the corbels on either side, underneath an oriel window. Directly under the window is a gold-painted carved wooden figure of an angel. The rest of the facade is approximately a century newer. The front of the building is built of ashlar blocks of locally sourced oolite. The \\"Chambre de' Roi\\", Richard III's room for his stay at the inn, covers the whole of the first floor with the two mullioned bay windows for both ground and first floors at either end. =Name= The 'Angel' part of the hotel's name comes from the gold-painted wooden demi-angels at the front of the building, holding the crown of Richard III. Despite the many royal visits in previous centuries, the \\"and Royal\\" suffix was only added to the name in 1866, when the inn was visited by the future King Edward VII (though he was Prince of Wales at the time).

Reynolds may have been a member of the Middle Temple. He joined the parliamentary army, and in 1648 he commanded a regiment of horse. He took part in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. He was a member of the Westminster-based Protectorate Parliament for Galway and Mayo in 1654 and Waterford and Tipperary in 1656. He was knighted in 1655. In 1657 he commanded the English force which cooperated with the French in Flanders in the Anglo- Spanish War and was lost at sea when returning to England. Biography John Reynolds, the third son of Sir James Reynolds of Castle Camps, Cambridgeshire, was brother of Sir Robert Reynolds (cf. 1601‚Äì1678). He was educated as a lawyer, and probably was a member of the Middle Temple.Silas Titus who entered that society in 1639, described him as his \\"chamber-fellow\\" cites Whitelocke, Memorials, iv. 379; and Clarendon State Papers, iii. 340. Reynolds joined the parliamentary army, and was probably the Captain Reynolds whose gallantry is praised by Earl of Essex in his narrative of the surrender of the parliamentary army at Foy in September 1644. cites Rushworth, v. 702. On the formation of the New Model Army he obtained command of a troop in Vermuyden's (afterwards Cromwell's) regiment of horse, and distinguished himself at the storming of Bridgewater. cites Sprigge, Anglia Rediviva, ed. 1854, pp. 78, 331. He is said to have taken a leading part in concerting opposition to the proposed disbanding of the army in 1647, and to have been for a time chairman of the committee of \\"agitators\\". cites Clarke Papers, i. 426. Reynolds was popular with soldiers of advanced political views, and in 1648 was put in command of a regiment of horse consisting mainly of volunteer troops raised on the occasion of the Second Civil War, cites Lilburne, England's New Chains Discovered, pt. ii. p. 11; and The Moderate, 5‚Äì12 December 1648. He was one of the officers in charge of King Charles I at Hurst Castle in December 1648. cites Memoirs of the two last Years of King Charles I, 1702, pp. 89, 92. On 17 February 1649 his regiment was placed on the establishment, and ordered to be completed. cites Commons' Journals, vi. 145, 147. It was intended to employ it in the relief of Ireland. Part of the regiment joined in the mutiny of the Levellers in May 1649, but Reynolds, with those who remained faithful, dispersed some of the mutineers at Banbury, held Newbridge against them, and joined in the final suppression of the revolt at Burford. cites Cromwelliana, p. 57; and The Moderate, 8‚Äì15 May, 15‚Äì22 May 1649. The levellers denounced him in their pamphlets as an apostate and a traitor. cites The Levellers Vindicated, 1649, p. 4. Reynolds and his regiment landed at Dublin on 25 July 1649, and played an important part in the victory which Colonel Michael Jones gained over the Marquis of Ormonde at the Battle of Rathmines on 2 August. cites Cary, Memorials of the Civil War, ii. 160; and Whitelocke, iii. 80, 85. He captured Carrick-on-Suir (November 1650), and with a very small garrison successfully repulsed Lord Inchiquin's attempt to retake it. \\"Both in the taking and defending of this place\\", wrote Cromwell to the speaker, \\"Colonel Reynolds his carriage was such as deserves much honour\\". cites Carlyle, Letter cxvi. About April 1651 Reynolds was made commissary-general of the horse in Ireland, and in that capacity assisted in the sieges of Limerick and Galway, and signed capitulations with Colonel Fitzpatrick, Lord Clanricarde, and other Irish leaders. cites Ludlow, Memoirs, ed. 1894, i. 262, 269, 289; and Gilbert, Contemporary History of Affairs in Ireland, iii. 232, 293, 304, 331. In 1653 the Aran Islands (15 January) and Inishbofin (14 February) surrendered to him. cites Gilbert, Contemporary History of Affairs in Ireland, iii. p. 363. For his services to the parliamentary cause, Parliament voted a reward of Irish lands to the value of ¬£500 per annum to Reynolds, in pursuance of which vote the manor of Carrick was made over to him. cites Commons' Journals, vii. 105, 725. With the debentures he received for his pay he invested in seven thousand acres of land in the county of Cork, and also purchased other lands in Waterford. cites Thurloe Papers, vi. 761. In the First Protectorate Parliament of 1654 he represented the counties of Galway and Mayo, and in that of 1656 Waterford and Tipperary. Reynolds was a zealous supporter of Cromwell, was knighted by the Protector on 11 June 1655, cites Mercurius Politicus, 7‚Äì14 June 1655. and voted for the offer of the crown to Oliver. cites Lansdowne MS. 823, f. 90; and Harleian Miscellany, iii. 455, 464. In March 1655 Reynolds was employed in the suppression of the intended rising of the royalists in Shropshire. cites Thurloe, iii. 265, 298, 354. In July 1656 Reynolds returned to Ireland with Henry Cromwell--Oliver's son and a brother-in-law of Reynolds through their marriage to the Russell sisters (see below). In September 1655 the Protector thought of sending Reynolds to command in Jamaica. Henry Cromwell reported that he was willing to accept the post, but added: \\"If you take him from hence you deprive me of my right hand\\". cites Thurloe, iv. 54. In November 1655 Reynolds promoted the petition for the appointment of Henry Cromwell as Lord Deputy of Ireland, or for the return of Fleetwood to his duties in Ireland. cites Thurloe, iv. 197, 421. In January 1656 Reynolds was sent to England by Henry Cromwell to give the Protector an account of the state of affairs in Ireland. cites Thurloe, iv. 404. He was also charged with commissions of importance relative to the reorganisation of the Irish government. cites Lansdowne MS. 823, ff. 66‚Äì88. On 25 April 1657 the Lord Protector appointed Reynolds commander-in-chief of the forces intended to co- operate with the French army in Flanders. cites Thurloe, vi. 223, 230. His pay as commander-in-chief was five pounds per diem. cites Thurloe, vi. 346. Reynolds, after some hesitation, accepted. cites Lansdowne MS. 823, ff. 104‚Äì108. He landed in France in May, and was received with studied courtesy by Cardinal Mazarin, cites Thurloe, vi. 297. but he found it difficult to persuade Marshal Turenne to attack the coast towns of Flanders, and complained that English interests were throughout postponed to French. cites Thurloe, vi. 480. At the siege of Saint-Venant the English troops \\"behaved themselves very stoutly, and were one great cause of the governor's not daring to abide the utmost\\", but the six thousand men under the command of Reynolds were reduced to four thousand by September 1657, solely by the hardships of the campaign. \\"Howsoever\\", he protested, \\"if I must still fight on my dagger, which was a sword, become an oyster-knife, I am content and submit\\". cites Lansdowne MS. 823, f. 114. Mardyck was taken on 23 September, and Reynolds installed there as governor of the English garrison; but the task of keeping so weakly fortified a post was one of great difficulty. Though Reynolds repulsed one attack with considerable loss to the assailants (22 October), both the English troops serving with Turenne and the garrison of Mardyke were so reduced by disease that at the beginning of December only eighteen hundred out of the six thousand were fit for service. cites Lansdowne MS. 823, f. 120; and Thurloe, vi. 497, 654, 658. Partly in order to obtain a fresh supply of men, partly on private grounds, Reynolds obtained leave to embark for England, leaving Major- general (afterwards Sir Thomas) Morgan to command at Mardyke in his absence. The ship in which he sailed was wrecked on the Goodwin Sands, and all on board were drowned, on 5 December 1657. Mercurius Politicus, 10‚Äì17 December. On 7 December, Admiral Richard Stayner reported that the Half Moon had arrived from Mardyke but the accompanying pink containing Reynolds and Francis White had been lost and a trunk washed up containing White's personal letters. They were lost about the Goodwin Sands. John Thurloe wrote that the \\"loss is to be much lamented, they being very worthy persons and of great use\\". A story which was widely circulated at the time represents Reynolds as returning to England in order to justify himself against the suspicions excited in the Protector's mind by a secret interview which had taken place between Reynolds and the Duke of York. The Memoirs of James II prove that such a meeting actually took place, but nothing more than ordinary civilities passed in it. cites Memoirs of James II i. 326; cf. Thurlo, vi. 687, 731. Rumours that he had for some reason lost Cromwell's favour had certainly reached Reynolds, as a letter from Sir Francis Russell to his son-in-law proves. cites Thurlo, vi. 630. Family Reynolds he married Sarah, daughter of Sir Francis Russell of Chippenham, he was the brother-in-law of Henry Cromwell, who had married her sister Elizabeth.About twenty letters from Reynolds to Henry Cromwell are among the correspondence of the latter ( cites Lansdowne MS. 823). By his will, which was disputed, Reynolds left the manor of Carrick to his brother Robert, and his other lands in England and Ireland to James Calthorpe, the husband of his sister Dorothy. On 20 July 1659 the House of Commons declared the will valid, and ordered Robert Reynolds to be given possession of Carrick. cites Thurloe, vi. 761;and Commons' Journals, vii. 725. Sarah, the widow of Sir John Reynolds, married, in 1660, Henry O'Brien, 7th Earl of Thomond. cites Noble, House of Cromwell, ii. 425.

Before the dam was constructed, these islands were separated by a stretch of water called the Sloe. The Sloedam was constructed in 1871 for the railway connection between the towns of Flushing and Roosendaal, the so-called Zeeuwse Lijn (Zealandic Line). After World War II, the areas to the south of the dam were poldered. Since the Veerse Gat estuary was closed off by the Veerse Gatdam in 1961, the Sloedam no longer functions as a primary defense against the sea. World War II During World War II, two battles were fought on and around the Sloedam. = Battle of Zeeland = In May 1940, the area was contested during the German invasion of the Low Countries in the Battle of Zeeland. A combined French-Dutch force under brigadier-general Marcel Deslaurens attempted to stop the German invasion, but was unsuccessful. = Battle of Walcheren Causeway = In 1944-1945, heavy fighting came to the area when the Allies attempted to clear the Western Scheldt, entrance to the harbor of Antwerpen. After heavy fighting, Zeelandic Flanders (south of the Scheldt) and Zuid-Beveland (to the north) were freed from German control by Canadian forces. However, Walcheren island, north of the river mouth, still contained a large German force that controlled access to the Western Scheldt. De Sloedam was the only access road to the former island of Walcheren. The Canadians reached the dam from Zuid- Beveland. The Germans were well prepared, and had established multiple well- prepared mortar sites that allowed them to fire on every point of the dam. The Canadian attempts to reach Walcheren all failed. Two Dutch resistance fighters offered their assistance to the Canadians. They knew the sandbars of the Sloe that ran dry during low tide and they led a patrol to Walcheren that managed to mark the dry area. After a short reconnaissance of the German positions, the patrol returned to Zuid-Beveland. The next day, a large Canadian unit managed to cross the Sloe, once again aided by the resistance men. After reaching the island of Walcheren, it attacked the German positions from the rear, managing to capture the mortar positions. The main Canadian force then crossed the Sloedam and established a beachhead on the Walcheren end. Operation Infatuate, the capture of Walcheren, was about to commence.Canadezen in actie.

Also known as the Golden Horus Name, this form of the pharaoh's name typically featured the image of a Horus falcon perched above /or beside the hieroglyph for gold. The meaning of this particular title has been disputed. One belief is that it represents the triumph of Horus over his uncle Seth, as the symbol for gold can be taken to mean that Horus was \\"superior to his foes\\". Gold also was strongly associated in the ancient Egyptian mind with eternity, so this may have been intended to convey the pharaoh's eternal Horus name. Similar to the Fivefold Titulary Nebty name, this particular name typically was not framed by a cartouche or serekh. It always begins with the depiction of the horus falcon perched above a representation of the sun-(hieroglyph).N5 The combination of the Horus falcon and the gold hieroglyph is frequently found on Ancient Egyptian pectorals (see image). =Gold= The Palermo piece of the 7--piece Palermo Stone.

Popular candies that employ this process in their manufacture include drag√©es, M&M;'s, gobstoppers, konpeit≈ç and jelly beans. Jelly beans use soft panning while the other three are examples of hard panning. The process was initially invented in 17th century France to make jordan almonds. Method A drag√©e pan. The red represents the material inside the pan. Hard and soft panning both are made in a similar fashion, but with different ingredients and at different speeds. A drag√©e pan, a spherical or oval pan mounted on an angled spinning post, is used. The pan is open to the air to allow ingredients to be added and the syrup to dry. The centers are put in the drag√©e pan, and syrup is added. The pan spins, and the syrup is evenly distributed over the centers and dries on as a layer. Soft panned layers can be quite thick and do not well preserve the shape of the center. Hard panned layers take longer to dry and can be as thin as 10-14Œºm. The choice for centers is wide, but they must be strong enough to not break during the tumbling. Nuts should be dried and sealed, such as with gum arabic and flour, to prevent oils from escaping and discoloring the candy shell. Other centers may be precoated for sealing or to improve the syrup sticking to the center. Chewing gum is difficult to pan without precoating. Materials Soft panning uses a syrup that will not crystallize, such as glucose. To assist in drying, powdered sugar or caster sugar is added during the tumble.

The squared feature that surrounds the swamp is the cooling pond of Florida Power & Light's Martin County power plant. The primary feature of the Barley Barber Swamp is its ancient bald cypress trees. This one is estimated at over 1,000 years old. The Barley Barber Swamp, once a vast Bald Cypress forest and waterway in the Greater Everglades watershed, is a parcel of land surrounded by Florida Power & Light's (FPL) Martin County power plant. The swamp is located just over a mile east of Lake Okeechobee and due west of Indiantown, Florida. The old-growth cypress swamp is named after Barley Barber, a man who lived in the area at the turn of the 20th century. Little is known of the man Barley Barber except that he left the region after he had \\"trouble with the law.\\" Location and History Historically, Barley Barber Swamp connected regional wetlands, including the Allapatah Marsh, to Lake Okeechobee, ultimately feeding the Everglades ecosystem further south. The region was once a center of trading for the indigenous people of the Lake Okeechobee area. A tall sand mound with ramp extensions sits in what remains today of the Barley Barber Swamp. Anthropologists contend that the indigenous culture of the area converged on the mound to trade in pottery. Pottery shards and human remains found on the mound are 300 to 900 years old. Significant hydrological changes occurred in Barley Barber starting in the late 19th century with the construction of Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway. Regional drainage projects, highways, and the construction of the Herbert Hoover Dike around Lake Okeechobee altered and disrupted the natural flow. Today the Barley Barber waterway is diverted through the L-65 canal into the St. Lucie canal before it reaches Lake Okeechobee. Nevertheless it remains navigable and interconnected. Flora and fauna Shoestring fern In Barley Barber One of the oldest bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) trees in the entire Southeastern U.S. sits in Barley Barber Swamp. It is estimated at over 1,000 years old, stands tall, and has a circumference of . There are also Florida strangler figs (Ficus aurea), swamp maples (Acer rubrum), and pond apples (Annona glabra). Barley Barber is home to a pair of nesting bald eagles, American alligators, North American river otters, bobcats, white-tailed deer and numerous unique plant species, including giant leather ferns (Acrostichum danaeifolium), shoestring ferns (Vittaria lineata) and whisk ferns (Psilotum species), which are fern-like vascular plants. Many species of migratory and wading birds, such as egrets, ibises, limpkin, and the endangered wood stork, can be seen in the swamp. Tourism Florida Power & Light acquired the land surrounding the Barley Barber Swamp in 1972 in order to construct the Martin County power plant. In the 1973 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Florida Power & Light states that \\"FPL has designated the facilities of this project so that the swamp, containing several of Florida's endangered species, will not only be saved but will be preserved and enhanced.\\"Florida Power & Light,\\"Environmental Impact Statement Martin Plant,\\" February 1973 After the plant's opening, the company constructed and opened a boardwalk for tours in Barley Barber Swamp. Local businesses in Indiantown, such as the historic Seminole Inn, coordinated tourism for the swamp. Barley Barber served as an environmental and economic asset to the small, rural community. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, FPL closed off all access to the Barley Barber Swamp citing security concerns. Controversy Barley Barber Swamp protesters entering swamp through waterway Martin County sheriff's officer climbs tree to bring out tree sitter Stevie Lowe in Barley Barber Swamp Beginning on 5 January 2009, 30 environmental activists staged a five-day vigil along the Barley Barber Swamp to draw attention to what they claimed were damages being wrought by the power company's 3,705 megawatt Martin County plant. They also claimed that the swamp and its waterway is not a part of Florida Power & Light property but rather Waters of the State and Waters of the U.S, held for use by the public. The activists claim that the Martin County power plant is drawing water from the aquifer below the swamp causing the soil to subside below the root systems of the trees, resulting in declining forest health. On January 10, seventeen of the activists were arrested for trespassing. Florida Power & Light has since stated that the company will reopen the Barley Barber Swamp by 2010. Much of the evidence behind claims of the Martin Plant's detrimental impacts on the Barley Barber Swamp come from research conducted by Hydro- ecologist Dr. Sydney Bacchus. Dr. Bacchus has stated that the power plant's cooling pond and water use have caused \\"surficial aquifer draw down.\\" Through the lowering of the water table, Dr. Bacchus argues, the ecosystem, including wildlife and the ancient cypress trees, is dying. On 23 July 2009, Stevie Lowe, one of the seventeen activists arrested at the Barley Barber protest, stood trial for trespassing into Barley Barber Swamp where she chained herself to a swamp maple. The jury found Stevie \\"not guilty\\" of trespassing. She was however convicted of \\"resisting arrest without violence.\\" That the State Attorney's office of Martin County did not prove FPL's ownership of Barley Barber Swamp has led the activists to further their claim that the Barley Barber Swamp is Waters of the United States held for the use of the public rather than FPL's private property.

He is best known for his association with the early cyberpunk culture and his advocacy of open source solutions to social problems. Rushkoff is most frequently regarded as a media theorist and is known for coining terms and concepts including viral media (or media virus), digital native, and social currency. He has written ten books on media, technology and culture. He wrote the first syndicated column on cyberculture for The New York Times Syndicate, as well as regular columns for The Guardian of London, Arthur, Discover, and the online magazines Daily Beast, TheFeature.com and meeting industry magazine One+. Rushkoff is currently Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics at the City University of New York, Queens College. He has previously lectured at The New School University in Manhattan and the ITP at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he created the Narrative Lab. He also has taught online for the MaybeLogic Academy.  Biography = Background = Rushkoff was born in New York City, New York, and is the son of Sheila, a psychiatric social worker, and Marvin Rushkoff, a hospital administrator. He graduated from Princeton University in 1983. He moved to Los Angeles and completed a Master of Fine Arts in Directing from the California Institute of the Arts. Later he took up a post-graduate fellowship from the American Film Institute. He was a PhD candidate at Utrecht University's New Media Program, writing a dissertation on new media literacies, which was approved in June, 2012. Rushkoff emerged in the early 1990s as an active member of the cyberpunk movement, developing friendships and collaborations with people including Timothy Leary, RU Sirius, Paul Krassner, Robert Anton Wilson, Ralph Abraham, Terence McKenna, Genesis P-Orridge, Ralph Metzner, Grant Morrison, Mark Pesce, Erik Davis, and other writers, artists and philosophers interested in the intersection of technology, society and culture. Cyberia, his first book on cyberculture, was inspired by the San Francisco rave scene of the early 1990s. The initially planned publication was scrapped, however; in Rushkoff's words, \\"in 1992 Bantam canceled the book because they thought by 1993 the internet would be over.\\" It was eventually published in 1994. As his books became more accepted, and his concepts of the \\"media virus\\" and \\"social contagion\\" became mainstream ideas, Rushkoff was invited to deliver commentaries on National Public Radio's All Things Considered, and to make documentaries for the PBS series Frontline. In 2002, Rushkoff was awarded the Marshall McLuhan Award by the Media Ecology Association for his book Coercion, and became a member and sat on the board of directors of that organization. This allied him with the \\"media ecologists\\", a continuation of what is known as the Toronto School of media theorists including Marshall McLuhan, Walter Ong, and Neil Postman. Rushkoff was invited to participate as a consultant ranging to the United Nations Commission on World Culture and the US Department of State. Simultaneously, Rushkoff continued to develop his relationship with counterculture figures, collaborating with Genesis P-Orridge as a keyboardist for Psychic TV, and credited with composing music for the album Hell is Invisible Heaven is Her/e. Rushkoff taught classes in media theory and in media subversion for New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program, participated in activist pranks with the Yes Men and eToy, contributed to numerous books and documentaries on psychedelics, and spoke or appeared at many events sponsored by counterculture publisher Disinformation. = Influences = References to media ecologist and Toronto School of Communication founder Marshall McLuhan appear throughout Rushkoff's work as a focus on media over content, the effects of media on popular culture and the level at which people participate when consuming media. Rushkoff worked with both Robert Anton Wilson and Timothy Leary on developing philosophical systems to explain consciousness, its interaction with technology, and social evolution of the human species, and references both consistently in his work. Leary, along with John Barlow and Terence McKenna characterized the mid-1990s as techno-utopian, and saw the rapid acceleration of culture, emerging media and the unchecked advancement of technology as completely positive. Rushkoff's own unbridled enthusiasm for cyberculture was tempered by the dotcom boom, when the non-profit character of the Internet was rapidly overtaken by corporations and venture capital. Rushkoff often cites two events in particular ‚Äì the day Netscape became a public company in 1995, and the day AOL bought Time Warner in 2000 ‚Äì as pivotal moments in his understanding of the forces at work in the evolution of new media. Rushkoff spent several years exploring Judaism as a primer for media literacy, going so far as to publish a book inviting Jews to restore the religion to its \\"open source\\" roots. He founded a movement for progressive Judaism called Reboot, but subsequently left when he felt its funders had become more concerned with marketing and publicity of Judaism than its actual improvement and evolution. Disillusioned by the failure of the open source model to challenge entrenched and institutional hierarchies from religion to finance, he became a colleague of Mark Crispin Miller and Naomi Klein, appearing with them at Smith College as well as in numerous documentaries decrying the corporatization of public space and consciousness. He has dedicated himself most recently to the issues of media literacy, participatory government, and the development of local and complementary currencies. He wrote a book and film called Life Inc., which traces the development of corporatism and centralized currency from the Renaissance to today, and hosts a radio show called MediaSquat on WFMU, concerned with reclaiming commerce and culture from corporate domination. = Awards and appointments = Douglas Rushkoff has served on the Board of Directors of the Media Ecology Association, The Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics, and is a founding member of Technorealism, as well as of the Advisory Board of The National Association for Media Literacy Education, MeetUp.com and HyperWords He is the winner of the first Neil Postman Award for Career Achievement in Public Intellectual Activity, given by the Media Ecology Association, in 2004.  Themes = General = Douglas Rushkoff's philosophy developed from a techno-utopian view of new media to a more nuanced critique of cyberculture discourse and the impact of media on society. Viewing everything except for intention as media, he frequently explores the themes of how to make media interactive, how to help people (especially children) effectively analyze and question the media they consume, as well as how to cultivate intention and agency. He has theorized on such media as religion, culture, politics, and money. = Technology and cyberculture = Up to the late-1990s, Douglas Rushkoff's philosophy towards technology could be characterized as media-deterministic. Cyberculture and new media were supposed to promote democracy and allow people to transcend the ordinary. In Cyberia, Rushkoff states the essence of mid-1990s culture as being the fusion of rave psychedelia, chaos theory and early computer networks. The promise of the resulting \\"counter culture\\" was that media would change from being passive to active, that we would embrace the social over content, and that empowers the masses to create and react. This idea also comes up in the concept of the media virus, which Rushkoff details in the 1994 publication of Media Virus: Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture. This significant work adopts organic metaphors to show that media, like viruses, are mobile, easily duplicated and presented as non-threatening.Boyd, Andrew. \\"Truth is a Virus .\\" Culture Jamming 101 . 2002. Retrieved on May 3, 2009. Technologies can make our interaction with media an empowering experience if we learn to decode the capabilities offered to us by our media. Unfortunately, people often stay one step behind our media capabilities. Ideally, emerging media and technologies have the potential to enlighten, to aid grassroots movements, to offer an alternative to the traditional \\"top-down\\" media, to connect diverse groups and to promote the sharing of information. Rushkoff does not limit his writings to the effect of technology on adults, and in Playing the Future turns his attention to the generation of people growing up who understand the language of media like natives, guarded against coercion. These \\"screenagers\\", a term originated by Rushkoff, have the chance to mediate the changing landscape more effectively than digital immigrants. With Coercion (1999), Rushkoff realistically examines the potential benefits and dangers inherent in cyberculture and analyzes market strategies that work to make people act on instinct (and buy!) rather than reflect rationally. The book wants readers to learn to \\"read\\" the media they consume and interpret what is really being communicated. = Religion = In Nothing Sacred: The Truth About Judaism, Rushkoff explores the medium of religion and intellectually deconstructs the Bible and the ways that religion fails to provide true connectivity and transformative experiences. = Currency = Most recently, Douglas Rushkoff has turned his critical lens to the medium of currency. One of the most important concepts that he creates and develops is the notion of social currency, or the degree to which certain content and media can facilitate and/or promote relationships and interactions between members of a community. Rushkoff mentions jokes, scandals, blogs, ambiance, i.e. anything that would engender \\"water cooler\\" talk, as social currency. In his book, Life, Inc. and his dissertation \\"Monopoly Moneys,\\" Rushkoff takes a look at physical currency and the history of corporatism. Beginning with an overview of how money has been gradually centralized throughout time, and pondering the reasons and consequences of such a fact, he goes on to demonstrate how our society has become defined by and controlled by corporate culture. = Social media = Rushkoff has long been skeptical of social media. On February 25, 2013, he announced in a CNN op-ed that he was leaving Facebook, citing concerns about the company's use of his personal data. = 401K Plans = In 2016, Douglas Rushkoff penned an article critical of 401(k) plans, in which he refers to the stock market as a \\"pyramid scheme\\" and states \\"In the 401(k) game, the patsy is anyone who follows the advice of the human resources department and surrenders a portion of his or her paycheck to the retirement planning industry, all under the pretense of personal responsibility.\\" Rushkoff does not suggest any alternatives to 401K plans for retirement savings.

Career Jones worked for a year as research assistant to Professor W R Dunstan at the Imperial Institute, and was then, in 1906, appointed professor of chemistry at Government College, Lahore. In 1913 he returned to England as assistant professor at the Imperial College of Science and Technology. In 1914 Jones enlisted in the London Scottish regiment and was sent to France. Immediately after the first German gas attack in 1915 he was promoted to captain and became assistant director of the central laboratory, general headquarters, formed to organize defensive measures. He devised methods of protection from phosgene gas, and in identifying quickly any new gas used by the enemy; he was the first to identify the chemical in mustard gas. For his services he was appointed DSO in 1917 and, in the following year, became director of the laboratory with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After the war he returned to academic life, as a chemistry professor at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, then in 1921 Principal of Manchester Municipal College of Technology. From 1938 to 1948 he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leeds. This included the Second World War, in which he also served in the Home Guard and for six months was in charge of the chemical warfare establishment at Porton Down. Jones, who never married, lived after his retirement at Waverley Abbey House, Farnham, where he died on 11 September 1953. His funeral was held at Farnham parish church on 17 September.

At that time, there was a missionary, Miss Anna Lindblad, working at a church as well as the church‚Äôs day school owned by Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1910, Miss Helen R. Galloway was sent to Suining to erect the building for the new boarding school. A land about 7-1/3 acres outside the North Gate of Suining was purchased. In February, 1913, Miss Gertrude Tyler gathered about a dozen girls into some old buildings behind the church in Suining and they opened the first boarding school. In July the school moved into the new dormitory building. Next year in 1914, the Administration Building was erected. The school was known officially as the \\"Stevens Memorial Suining Girls Boarding School\\", but was often called locally the Suining Higher Primary Girls School.  Expansion  The Stevens Memorial Suining Girls Boarding School expanded having the Sunday School (1916), Woman's School (1918), Junior Middle School (1925), Senior Middle School (1927), and Kindergarten (1928). In 1925, the 2nd two-floor Dormitory Building was built. The first floor contained a dining room that seated nearly 200 (named as Shoemaker Memorial dining room), a kitchen and four bedrooms. The second floor had twelve bedrooms and an infirmary. The chapel had seats for about 150 people. There was a science room, library, gymnasium, superintendent‚Äôs office and dining room.

Under Mussolini, no policy of abduction of Jews had been implemented in Italy. Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Nazi forces invaded and occupied much of the country, and began deportations of Jews to extermination camps. Pius XII protested at diplomatic levels, while several thousand Jews found refuge in Catholic networks, institutions and homes across Italy, including in Vatican City and Pope Pius' Summer Residence. The Catholic Church and some historians have credited this rescue in large part to the direction of Pope Pius XII. However, historian Susan Zuccotti researched the matter in detail and discovered that although the pope was aware of the Holocaust, he did not issue a rescue order. Zuccotti states that there is \\"considerable evidence of papal disapproval of the hiding of Jews and other fugitives in Vatican properties.\\"Zucotti (2005) pp 287-89, 307 Various historians have given different emphases to accounts of Pius' actions. According to historian Michael Phayer, \\"the question of the pope's silence has become the focus of intense historical debate and analysis\\" because the deportations occurred \\"under his very windows,\\" a phrase that was also used in the title of a book on the subject by Zuccotti.Phayer, 2008, p. 70. The phrase is based on an actual quotation from the report of Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the German ambassador to the Vatican, who reported to Berlin that the razzia had taken place \\"under the Pope's windows.\\"S√°nchez, 2002, p. 26.John T. Pawlikowski. \\"The Papacy of Pius XII: The Known and the Unknown\\". In Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 77. It also echoes the reported words of the protest made to von Weizs√§cker by the pope's secretary of state on the morning of the roundup: \\"It is sad for the Holy Father, sad beyond imagination, that here in Rome, under the very eyes of the Common Father, that so many people should suffer only because they belong to a specific race.\\" Phayer's and Zuccotti's emphasis on \\"papal silence\\" can be contrasted with that of \\"papal action\\" by Jewish Holocaust historian Sir Martin Gilbert. By Gilbert's account, when the Nazis came to Rome in search of Jews, Pius had already \\"A few days earlier... personally ordered the Vatican clergy to open the sanctuaries of the Vatican City to all 'non-Aryans' in need of refuge.\\" Zucotti argues that there is no written evidence of this supposed papal directive and that claims of its existence only appeared after the 1963 production of a play critical of Pius' failure to protest the Holocaust.Zucotti (2005), p 288 However, as Pius defender Gary Krupp writes, \\"it was not only normal but essential for any incriminating documents, even slips of paper, to be destroyed lest they fall into Nazi hands and endanger the carrier or the referee. In fact, as [writer Ronald] Rychlak points out, Zuccotti had spelt this out herself in an earlier book...: 'Any direct personal order would have had to be kept very quiet to protect those who were actually sheltered' ('The Italians and the Holocaust,' 1987).\\"Krupp, Gary L., \\"Pope Pius XII and World War II, The Documented Truth,\\" Pave the Way Foundation, 2012, pps. 243-44. Lead up to roundups=Foreknowledge of Vatican= According to Phayer, there is no doubt that \\"Pius XII knew of the plan to murder Roman Jews.\\" Phayer writes that Pius XII's under-secretaries of state Giovanni Montini and Domenico Tardini first learned of the planned deportations in mid-September 1943.Phayer, 2008, p. 71. Specifically, the Vatican learned of a \\"telegram from Berlin instructing the SS in Rome to seize the city's Jews\\" several weeks before the razzia began. However, according to Jewish historian Rabbi David G. Dalin, \\"A fair reading suggests Pius had heard rumors and raised them with the Nazi occupiers. Princess Enza Pignatelli Aragona reported that when she broke in on the pope with the news of the roundup early on the morning of October 16, 1943, his first words were: \\"But the Germans had promised not to touch the Jews!\\"David G. Dalin; Pius XII and the Jews; The Weekly Standard; 26 February 2001. =Preemptive efforts to protect Jews= By October, \\"various members of the German military and diplomatic corps\\" were attempting to prevent the planned deportation of Rome's Jews. Ernst von Weizs√§cker took over from bishop Alois Hudal the task of compiling a comprehensive list of the properties of the pope in Rome and sending hundreds of \\"letters of protection\\" to those properties, guaranteeing them extraterritorial status. However, Weizs√§cker delegated the task of actually warning the Roman Jewry to his assistant Albrecht von Kassel, who encountered great difficulty because of prevailing opinion, generated by Jews Dante Almansi and Ugo Foa, that there was \\"no cause for alarm.\\"Phayer, 2008, p. 73. In any case, according to Phayer, \\"Pope Pius gave them no warning.\\" In the end, very few Jews \\"availed themselves of opportunities to hide\\" before October 16. Contrary to many non-contemporary accounts, Zuccotti finds no evidence that \\"the populations of convents and monasteries surged before the fateful day.\\" Father P√®re Marie-Beno√Æt. According to Gilbert, the pope had helped the Jews of Rome in September by contributing to the 50 kg of gold demanded by the Nazis. At the same time, wrote Gilbert, the Capuchin Father Benoit had saved large numbers of Jews by providing them with false identification papers, helped by the Swiss, Hungarian, Romanian and French embassies, and a number of Italian officials. A few days before the October 15-16 roundup, Pius XII personally directed Vatican clergy to open the sanctuaries of the Vatican to all \\"non-Aryans\\" in need of refuge.Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; pp.622-623 According to Zuccotti, not only did Pius XII not aid the efforts of Father P√®re Marie-Beno√Æt (later honored as Righteous among the Nations for his efforts to save Jews), he actively discouraged his work.Phayer, 2008, p. 74. Father Beno√Æt was called to Rome in June 1943. Zuccotti wrote that he had no success in enlisting the aid of the pontiff to help Jews escape Italian- occupied France.Zuccotti, 2002, p. 181. With respect to Beno√Æt's actions during the razzia, Zuccotti writes, \\"far from claiming receipt of material aid from Vatican officials, Benedetto never even wrote that they encouraged him.\\"Zuccotti, 2002, p. 185. For example, Msgr. Angelo Dell'Acqua, an official in the Vatican Secretariat of State, wrote on November 20, 1943 that he had repeatedly told Beno√Æt to \\"use the maximum prudence,\\" lamenting that Beno√Æt had \\"not wished to listen to the humble advice given to him.\\" According to Zuccotti, Vatican officials actively attempted to \\"subdue\\" the efforts of Beno√Æt and others, cautioning them against even meeting with Jews, with \\"whom it would be better to speak less.\\" When Beno√Æt asked Montini for a letter of recommendation that he needed in order to provide false documents to Jews, \\"he received little but a reprimand.\\"Zuccotti, 2002, p. 186. Rabbi Dalin has queried Zuccotti's methodology and conclusions, writing that \\"There exists testimony from a Good Samaritan priest that Bishop Giuseppe Nicolini of Assisi, holding a letter in his hand, declared that the pope had written to request help for Jews during the German roundup of Italian Jews in 1943. But because the priest did not actually read the letter, Zuccotti speculates that the bishop may have been deceiving him ‚Äî and thus that this testimony should be rejected. Compare this skeptical approach to evidence with her treatment, for example, of a 1967 interview in which the German diplomat Eitel F. M√∂llhausen said he had sent information to the Nazis' ambassador to the Vatican, Ernst von Weizs√§cker, and \\"assumed\\" that Weizs√§cker passed it on to Church 'officials'. Zuccotti takes this as unquestionable proof that the pope had direct foreknowledge of the German roundup.\\" =Pius offers loan to Jews= SS Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Kappler is \\"notorious for holding the Jews of Rome for ransom\\" due to his demand of 50 kilograms of gold, for which he was convicted of extortion by an Italian court after the war. In fact, it is possible that Kappler's intentions were to \\"bribe Berlin [rather] than to shake down the Jews.\\" The Jews of Rome turned to the pope in an attempt to meet the ransom. Pius XII offered to loan the Jews the gold, with no deadline for repayment and no interest. However, this loan never took place because the Jews came up with the required amount on their own by 28 September. A German cable from 11 October, which does not mention their recent receipt of the extorted gold, ordered Kappler to proceed with the deportation as planned.Phayer, 2008, p. 75. =Actions of the German diplomatic corps= Ernst von Weizs√§cker, the German ambassador to the Vatican In addition to the opposition from von Weizs√§cker and von Kessel, the deportations were opposed by General Reiner Stahel, the commandant of Rome, Field Marshal General Albert Kesselring and Eitel Friedrich M√∂llhausen, German charg√© d'affaires to Italy.Phayer, 2008, pp. 74-75. Kappler suggested to the foreign ministry on October 6 that the Jews would be \\"better used as laborers in Italy\\" and M√∂llhausen communicated similar sentiments to Stahel. A second telegram the next day from M√∂llhausen to Berlin said that the field marshal had asked Kappler to postpone the roundup. Knowing that the German officials in Rome were unanimously opposed to the roundup, Adolf Eichmann sent Theodore Dannecker, the SS captain responsible for the deportations of the Parisian Jews, to Rome. Having a very limited force compared to the 8,000 Roman Jews, Dannecker pressed Kappler to provide him with additional forces and a list of addresses; both Kappler and Stahel complied. The razzia=Roundup commences= The roundup began on October 16.Phayer, 2008, p. 72. The Germans surrounded the Roman Ghetto on Shabbat and went door-to-door in the early morning, waking up the sleeping Jews on their list of addresses. They were given 20 minutes to assemble their possessions and assemble outside in the rain.Phayer, 2008, p. 76. 1,000 Jews--900 of whom were women and children-- were taken to the Military College of Rome, only a few blocks from St Peter's Basilica. Gilbert wrote that the Germans \\"combed the houses and streets of Rome in search of Jews who, regardless of age, sex or health were taken to the Collegio Militaire. A few days earlier, Pope Pius XII had personally ordered the Vatican clergy to open the sanctuaries of the Vatican City to all \\"non- Aryans\\" in need of refuge. By morning of October 16, a total of 477 Jews had been given shelter in the Vatican and its enclaves, while another 4,238 had been given sanctuary in the many monasteries and convents of in Rome. Only 1,015 of Rome's 6,730 Jews were seized that morning.\\"Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; pp. 622-23. Owen Chadwick estimates the number of deportees to Auschwitz at 1,007 and the number of survivors at 15.Chadwick, 1988, p. 288. =The Hudal letter= That same day, Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione requested that von Weizs√§cker meet with him to discuss the action and sent a telegram of protest to Berlin. The telegram is known as the Hudal Letter, named for the pro-Nazi bishop Alois Hudal, rector of Santa Maria dell'Anima, the German national church in Rome. Hudal became notorious after the war for masterminding the \\"ratlines\\" through which Nazi war criminals escaped justice in Europe, mostly to South America. According to the ADSS, the Hudal letter was conveyed to Berlin by Carlo Pacelli, the pope's nephew, through General Stahel. The letter requested a suspension of the arrests, stating \\"otherwise I fear the Pope will take a position in public as being against this action, one which would undoubtedly be used by the anti-German propagandists as a weapon against us Germans.\\" According to Albrecht von Kessel, Hudal did not write the letter but merely signed it after it was drafted primarily by von Weizs√§cker, von Kessel, Gerhart Gumpel (another German diplomat in Rome) and even General Stahel himself.Phayer, 2008, p. 77. von Weizs√§cker sent a telegram to Berlin a few hours later vouching for the authenticity and argument of the letter. Phayer does not rule out the possibility of papal involvement with the letter, but suggests that if Pius XII was involved, the letter was designed \\"to rescue Jews without risking a papal statement of denunciation.\\" =Maglione and von Weizs√§cker meeting= On the morning of the roundup, Cardinal Secretary of State Cardinal Maglione, on the orders of Pope Pius, met with German ambassador to the Vatican Ernst von Weizsacker. According to Phayer, the meeting \\"ranks as one of the most dramatic scenes of Holocaust historiography.\\"Phayer, 2008, p. 78. The meeting received the attention of British historian Owen Chadwick and is often \\"taken center stage in accounts of the razzia in Rome.\\" Phayer disagrees with Chadwick's assessment of the importance of the meeting. By Gilbert's account, upon receiving news of the roundups on the morning of 16 October, the Pope immediately instructed Maglione to protest to Weizsacker: \\"Maglione did so that morning, making it clear to the ambassador that the deportation of Jews was offensive to the Pope. In urging Weizsacker 'to try to save these innocent people,' Maglione added: 'It is sad for the Holy Father, sad beyond imagination, that here in Rome, under the very eyes of the Common Father, that so many people should suffer only because they belong to a specific race.'\\" Following the meeting, Weizsacker gave orders for a halt to the arrests.Hitler's Pope? ; Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator, 18 August 2006. Chadwick quotes a letter from D'Arcy Osborne to the Foreign Office from the last day of the month: > As soon as he heard of the arrests of the Jews in Rome the Cardinal > Secretary of State sent for the German ambassador and formulated some sort > [undecyphered word] of protest. The Ambassador took immediate action with > the result that large numbers were released [...] Vatican intervention thus > seems to have been effective in saving a large number of these unfortunate > people.Chadwick, 1988, p. 289. Phayer wrote in 2008 that \\"nearly all\\" historians agree that Maglione did not protest the seize of that morning in his meeting with von Weizs√§cker, nor did Pius XII ever speak publicly of the razzia. However, on October 25 (by which time most of the Jews who had been rounded up were probably already dead or soon to enter the gas chamber), L'Osservatore Romano ran an article saying that \\"the Holy Father's charity was universal, extending to all races.\\" According to Gilbert, following Maglione's appeal, to protect Rome's remaining Jews from a possible German reversal, Pius gave instructions for the Vatican to be opened to the city's Jews, and for the convents and monasteries to provide hiding places or to provide false papers. Gilbert credits this papal initiative with a larger percentage of the Jews of Rome being saved than had been saved in any other city then under German occupation. Von Weizs√§cker wrote of the Vatican diplomacy on October 22 in a letter to his mother, saying \\"fortunately so far no one has taken a public position.\\"Phayer, 2008, p. 79. According to Phayer, \\"historians--as opposed to writers whose sole objective is to defend Pius XII--are not in agreement with the editors of the Actes et Documents, who maintained that Maglione succeeded in registering a papal protest of the roundup of the Jews.\\" According to Maglione's account of the meeting, when asked by von Weizs√§cker what the pope would do if these things were to continue, he replied that the Holy See did not wish to have to express disapproval, and when asked whether von Weizs√§cker should report the conversation to his superiors, he replied that he was \\"leaving it to his judgment.\\"Phayer, 2008, pp. 79-80. Historian Michael Burleigh defends the pope, noting acerbically that \\"critics of Pius, evidently unaware of such a thing as tactical lies, routinely alight upon [Weizsacker's downplaying of the Pope's protests of the razzia]\\" as having done \\"considerable harm to the reputation of Pius XII\\". But Burleigh adds that \\"at the time [Pius' and Weizsacker's diplomacy] served the more urgent end of diverting Berlin's malign attentions away from the thousands of Jews hidden in Catholic churches and private homes in Rome.... Such serpentine stratagems were as normal to those who had to negotiate these shoals at the time as they are alien to the academic moralists who deplore them with the luxury of hindsight. Even historians otherwise critical of Pius concede that the Germans would have had no hesitation in responding to an overt protest by invading the hundreds of Church properties where, in Rome alone, five thousand Jews were sheltered.\\"Burleigh, Michael, Sacred Causes, Harper Collins, 2006, pps. 279-80 =Sanctuary in the Vatican, monasteries and convents= A large number of Jews, perhaps more than 6,000, found refuge in the various religious properties of Rome, including in monasteries and convents; a much smaller number took refuge in Vatican City itself.Phayer, 2008, p. 85. It is clear from the number of letters of protection issued by von Weizs√§cker that many of the buildings possessing letters of protection (and asserting extraterritorial status) were in fact not owned by the Church. Gilbert wrote that, in October 1943, with the SS occupying Rome and determined to deport the city's 5,000 Jews, the Vatican clergy had opened the sanctuaries of the Vatican to all \\"non-Aryans\\" in need of rescue in an attempt to forestall the deportation. \\"Catholic clergy in the city acted with alacrity,\\" wrote Gilbert. \\"At the Capuchin convent on the Via Siciliano, Father Benoit, under the name of Father Benedetti, saved a large numbers of Jews by providing them with false identification papers [...] by the morning of October 16, a total of 4,238 Jews had been given sanctuary in the many monasteries and convents of Rome. A further 477 Jews had been given shelter in the Vatican and its enclaves.\\" Gilbert credited the \\"rapid rescue efforts\\" of the Church as saving over four- fifths of Roman Jews that morning.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.314 Il Collegio San Giuseppe - Istituto De Merode, like other Roman Catholic schools, hid numerous Jewish children and adults among its students and brothers. Pietro Palazzini, who was later appointed a cardinal and recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem, endangered his life in his efforts to save the Jews of Rome.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.315 As assistant vice rector of the Seminario Romano (which was Vatican property), he hid Italian Jews for several months in 1943 and 1944. In accepting his title from Yad Vashem, Palazzini said that \\"the merit is entirely Pius XII's, who ordered us to do whatever we could to save the Jews from persecution.\\"David G. Dalin; Pius XII and the Jews; The Weekly Standard; 26 February 2001 In Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy, Zuccotti argued that the pope \\"did not give orders to the various Roman Catholic institutions of Rome to open their doors to the Jews\\".Phayer, 2008, p. xiii. Zuccotti's other published works advance her argument that Pius XII neither ordered nor was aware of the full extent of the rescue operations carried out by Catholics and Catholic institutions. Zuccotti argues that Pius XII disapproved of the rescue efforts, as evidenced by a December 1943 letter from the rector of Pontificio Seminario, Romano Maggiore, apologizing to Pius XII for accepting refugees, apparently having been previously reprimanded. Zuccotti also finds a February 1944 order to remove fugitives from Vatican properties inconsistent with the existence of a papal directive to save Jews. Phayer agrees with this interpretation while arguing that in fact \\"the Vatican cooperated in this rescue attempt,\\" which he believes was initiated by the German diplomats of Rome. Zuccotti argues that any coordination was the result of the efforts of the Italian Jewish agency DELASEM, which petitioned Italian bishops and turned over funds and lists of names to those who agreed to help. Jonathan Gorsky wrote for Yad Vashem that the scale of the rescue of Jews would have been impossible without papal approval: \\"The rescue of thousands of Jews during the Holocaust, and the opening of Catholic institutions as places of shelter, could not have occurred in the face of papal disapproval. This is especially true with regard to institutions within the confines of Rome and the Vatican... No one has denied the significant scale of Catholic rescue activity, and gratitude was indeed expressed by leading Jews after the war.\\"Pius XII and the Holocaust; by Jonathan Gorsky for Yad Vashem; retrieved 4 October 2013 Robert Leiber, a close Jesuit adviser of Pius XII, asserted in 1961 that Pius XII personally ordered superiors of church properties to open their doors to Jews.Phayer, 2000, p. 102. For his statistics on the number of Jews whom he claimed Pius XII had saved, Leiber relied on fellow Jesuit Beato Ambord; the original compilation of the numbers is unknown.Zuccotti, 2000, p. 200. A more recent study by Dwork and Pelt concurs with Zuccotti, concluding: \\"Sam Waagenaar challenged Leiber. On the basis of our research, we find Waagenaar's refutation convincing. Pope Pius XII did nothing. Many convents and monasteries helped--but not to the extent that Pius's close associate Robert Leiber claimed.\\"Dwork and Pelt, 2002, p. 423. Jews within the Vatican City State itself were \\"guests in the private apartments of individual prelates\\" who were in fact ordered to leave in a February 1944 order, but were allowed to stay after much uproar from the prelates in question. In August 2006, extracts from the 60-year-old diary of a nun of the Convent of Santi Quattro Coronati were published in the Italian press, claiming that Pius XII had issued such an order to Rome's convents and monasteries.

Geology The water which bubbles up from the ground at Bath, fell as rain on the nearby Mendip Hills. It percolates down through limestone aquifers to a depth of between and where geothermal energy raises the water temperature to between and .

He was a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and served over 13 years as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of Canada. He served on the CCF's national council and executive, and was elected as the CCF's National Chairman in 1950. After he was defeated as an MP, he returned to his occupation as a farmer until his death in 1980. Wright was born in Beachburg, Ontario, and attended Jarvis Collegiate Institute in Toronto. He served in the Canadian Field Artillery during World War I and became a lieutenant. His career was in farming. He was first elected to Parliament from the Melfort electoral district in the 1940 federal election. He was re-elected in 1945 and 1949. When the Melfort electoral district was abolished, in the 1952 federal riding redistribution, Wright sought re-election in Melville, which contained roughly half of his old riding. It was also the electoral district of incumbent federal Minister of Agriculture James Garfield Gardiner of the Liberal party. In the 1953 Federal Election Wright was defeated by Gardiner, ending his federal political career. When F. R. Scott retired as the National Chairman, just before the CCF's biennial convention in Vancouver in July 1950, there was a rift between the farmer and labour wings. Wright represented the farmer-wing, while Vancouver's Angus MacInnis, the son-in-law of former party founding leader J.S. Woodsworth, represented the labour-wing. Wright defeated MacInnis in the election to be the CCF's National Chairman. He was elected again in 1952. At the 1954 convention Wright retired as National Chairman and David Lewis was elected to replace him. He died in 1980.

Stapley was M.P. for New Shoreham (1624‚Äì1625), Lewes (1628), Sussex (1640, 1653‚Äì1654). He was colonel and governor of Chichester (1642‚Äì1645) and signed the death-warrant of Charles I. He was a member of Council of State in 1649‚Äì1653, vice-admiral of Sussex in 1650 and a member of interim council and of supreme assembly in 1653. Biography Stapley was baptised at Framfield on 30 August 1590, was the son of Anthony Stapley of Framfield, Sussex, by his third wife, Ann, daughter of John Thatcher of Priesthawes, Sussex. The Stapley family removed about 1615 from Framfield to Patcham. Anthony about 1640 gave ¬£10 to the new building at Christ's College, Cambridge, and was probably educated there. Stapley represented the borough of New Shoreham in the parliaments of 1624 (elected 21 January 1624) and of 1625 (elected 2 May), and the borough of Lewes in that of 1628 (elected 26 February 1628), having unseated Sir George Rivers by petition. He was returned both for the county of Sussex and for the borough of Lewes to the Short Parliament in March 1640, when he elected to sit for the county. He was again chosen by the county on 22 October 1640 to sit in the Long Parliament, and represented it in the Barebones Parliament of 1653 and the First Protectorate Parliament of 1654. In January 1640 Stapley, then a justice of the peace, was reported to Dr. William Bray, Archbishop Laud's chaplain, as causing trouble to the churches by his puritan leanings. On the outbreak of the English Civil War he received a colonel's commission in the parliamentary army, and was present at the siege of Chichester in December 1642 under Sir William Waller. He was left as governor of the town and garrison when Waller moved on to the siege of Arundel Castle. On 22 September 1643 he took the covenant. At the beginning of 1644 he raised objections to the quartering in the town of some of Waller's horse. The dispute was referred to a committee of the House of Commons, and finally to the committee of both kingdoms on 26 February. He was ordered by both bodies to observe Waller's commands. While detained in London he was exonerated from all blame in the event of disaster at Chichester. He resumed the command of the town and garrison at the termination of the proceedings early in March. He retained his governorship till 1645, when he was succeeded by Colonel Algernon Sidney. In January 1644 he was deputy lieutenant of the county of Sussex. Stapley was one of the commissioners who sat in judgement on Charles I during his trial for high treason. Stapley was present at Westminster Hall on 27 January 1649 when sentence was pronounced, and signed the death-warrant on 29 January. He was elected a member of the first Council of State of the Commonwealth on 17 February 1649 (when he signed the engagement), and re-elected on 17 February 1649‚Äì1650, 25 November 1651, 30 November 1652, and 9 July 1653. He was one of Cromwell's interim council of thirteen (29 April to 14 July 1653), and of the supreme assembly called on 6 June 1653. He had joined the admiralty committee of the committee of both kingdoms on 6 June 1649, was nominated vice-admiral for the county of Sussex on 22 February 1650, and took the oath of secrecy the following day. He died early in 1655, and was buried at Patcham on 31 January. At the Restoration he was one of the regicides notified as dead, and excepted from the act of Pardon and Oblivion of 6 June 1660 (which meant that his estate was subject to confiscation). Family Stapley married Ann, daughter of George Goring of Danny, and sister of George, Lord Goring. She was buried at Patcham on 11 November 1637. By her Stapley had three sons and one daughter. Stapley married a second wife, \\"Dame Anne Clarke\\", who predeceased him on 15 January 1654. Sir John Stapley (1628‚Äì1701), the second but eldest surviving son abandoned the political views of his father, became entangled in a plot for the return of Charles II as did his brother Antony.

He played college football for the University of Montana and University of Michigan. He was a first-team All-Big Ten tackle and second-team All-American in 1944 for the Michigan Wolverines. He later played professional football for the Cleveland Rams and Los Angeles Rams. He played on the 1945 NFL Championship team as a rookie and was an All-Pro guard/linebacker for the Rams in 1948 and 1949. Early years Lazetich was born in 1921 in Anaconda, Montana. He was the son of Peter Lazetich, a pioneer Serbian rancher. He grew up on his father's cattle ranch a few miles from Anaconda. Lazetich attended Anaconda High School where he played football and was selected as an all-state tackle three straight years in 1938, 1939 and 1940. He also played basketball and was a member of the track team. Two of his brothers were also all-state football players at Anaconda High School. Lazetich played one year of college football at the University of Montana. In a spring game in April 1942, Lazetich returned a kickoff 90 yards. He joined the U.S. Navy during World War II but received a medical discharge. After being discharged from the Navy, Lazetich served as a deputy sheriff in Deer Lodge County, Montana. He also worked as a cowpuncher and rodeo rider. =University of Michigan= He enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played for Fritz Crisler's Wolverines football team in 1944. Because of his prior work in law enforcement, Lazetich was given the nickname the \\"Sheriff\\" by his Michigan teammates, a nickname that stuck throughout his football career. Lazetich was the star of the 1944 Wolverines team that went 8‚Äì2 and finished the season ranked #8 in the AP Poll. After being introduced to Big Ten football in 1944, Lazetich told reporters that \\"no end or back ever threw a block like a pony that has been running wild for a couple of years, especially when he feels the first touch of a saddle.\\" An NEA wire service story reported: \\"To him the Big Nine schedule can't be as tough as the battering bucking broncs handed out.\\" In a pre-game story about the 1944 Michigan ‚Äì Ohio State game, the Associated Press focused on Lazetich: > \\"The Michigan line is built around Milan Lazetich, a big tackle from > Anaconda, Mont., who once was sheriff in his home community. He's the No. 1 > All-America candidate from the Wolverine camp, so the reports say, but he's > only one of a stalwart line which held Illinois speedsters without a score.\\" At the end of the 1944 season, Lazetich, in his sophomore season, was selected for the Associated Press All Big Ten Team as a first-team tackle. He was also picked as a second-team All-American by the Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America, International News Service, and Central Press Association. =Cleveland and Los Angeles Rams= In August 1945, the 23-year- old Michigan sophomore signed to play professional football for the Cleveland Rams. With the Rams, Lazetich was converted from a tackle to a guard on offense and linebacker on defense. Lazetich played in ten games at right guard for the Rams in 1945, and he helped the Rams to win the NFL championship in his first year as a professional player. In 1946, the Rams moved to Los Angeles, giving California and the Pacific Coast its first major league sports team. Lazetich played for the Rams in their first five seasons in Los Angeles. When the Rams moved west, the Los Angeles Times ran an article introducing the city to the team's top players. In its feature on Lazetich, the Times noted that, in \\"Sheriff\\" Lazetich, the Rams had one of the country's greatest law enforcement officers in its line. > \\"Lazetich is a copper from Anaconda ... Lazetich was a deputy sheriff of > Deer Lodge County but he has made most of his arrests on the football field > ... Lazetich played freshman football at the University of Montana after > which he moved up to Big Ten football ... While Lazetich was an All-Big Ten > tackle for the Wolverines, he is the regular right guard of the Rams.\\" In the late 1940s, he was regarded as \\"one of the finest defensive right guards in pro football,\\" and \\"50% of one of the best guard combinations in the National Football League.\\" The Los Angeles Times gave Lazetich substantial credit for the success of the 1949 Rams. He was selected as a first-team NFL All-Pro by the Chicago-Herald American in 1948 and as a second-team NFL All- Pro by Pro Football Illustrated. In 1949, he was selected as a first-team All- NFL/AAFC player by the International News Service, the Hearst newspapers wire service. Lazetich made a key play in the 1950 NFL Championship Game. With the Rams ahead, 28‚Äì27, and only five minutes left to play in the game, the Cleveland Browns were driving toward a score. After Browns quarterback Otto Graham carried the ball on a quarterback draw, \\"linebacker Milan Lazetich hit him from behind, forcing a fumble recovered by the Rams at their own 22-yard line with just 3:16 to play.\\" Lazeitch also recovered the fumble and appeared to have sealed a victory for the Rams. However, the Rams were unable to run out the clock, and the Browns kicked a field goal in the game's last minute to win, 30‚Äì28. In addition to his ability as a player, Lazetich developed a reputation as \\"a wild character if there ever was one.\\" Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the \\"faceless robots\\" of the modern game. He focused in particular on Lazetich: \\"A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable in light of what he pulled at Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team at the end of the '46 season.\\" Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design of a football field topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way: > \\"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to > demonstrate his punting prowess. I don't think he'd ever kicked a football > before in his life. They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which was > a big mistake because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. He > ambled out to the kitchen, plucked the football off the top of the fancy > cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with > beautiful form and a perfect follow through. Cake, frosting and everything > else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows > and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for > the Rams.\\" By 1948, health problems began to affect Lazetich. Prior to the 1948 season, the Los Angeles Times reported on an unspecified medical condition that may prevent him from playing for the team. In November 1949, Lazetich was hospitalized in Pennsylvania during the football season for treatment of a stomach ulcer. He was given several blood transfusions, his condition was reported to be serious, and he was unable to play for the rest of the month. In July 1951, Lazetich announced his retirement from football. At the time, the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Sorry to see the gruff rough Sheriff on the shelf. His departure leaves the Rams with only two members of the original cast of the 1945 world's championship team.\\" =Later years= After retiring from football, Lazetich returned to Montana, where he worked for the Deer Lodge County, Montana road department, as a court bailiff and as a surveyor with the Montana Highway Department. He was a member of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Butte, Montana, the Bokelian Brotherhood Lodge in Butte, and the Serbian Fraternity of Anaconda. Lazetich died in a hospital in Butte, Montana at age 47 in July 1969. He was buried with military honors at the Mount Olivet Cemetery after a funeral in Butte's Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church. Lazetich was survived by his wife, the former Mary Laughlin, and his daughter Milana. Lazetich's nephew, Pete Lazetich, helped the Stanford football team to a victory over his uncle's alma mater, Michigan, in the 1972 Rose Bowl. Pete Lazetich was part of the Stanford's front four known as the \\"Thunder Chickens.\\" The younger Lazetich made 11 tackles in the 1972 Rose Bowl.

The school is named after the great Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu, being the first high school in Transylvania bearing the name of the poet. The Mihai Eminescu National College is one of the only four national colleges located in Satu Mare alongside Ioan Slavici, K√∂lcsey Ferenc and Doamna Stanca. History The high school was established in 1634 when Jesuits received approval to open a college in Satu Mare. The new institution was supported by an act issued in 1639 in Vienna by Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III. It operated with few exceptions until 1804 when a decree was given by the Holy Roman Emperor Francis I that states the college will be supported through state funds. Also in 1804 the school established a bishop college in 1850 which later merged with the gymnasium. Based on an energetic approach of the Roman Catholic Bishop the gymnasium was taken over by the state in 1863 and decreed a royal Catholic secondary school ‚Äì gimnazium regium. Although this school taught young students belonging to all ethnic groups in this land, it is noteworthy that the majority of students have always been Romanians. The teaching language has been changed in the evolution of the college, from Latin to Hungarian and then to German and finally to Romanian. Centuries of injustice suffered by the Romanians were repaired since July 15, 1919 when the Mihai Eminescu high school was founded, the first institution of secondary education with Romanian language teaching in the town of Satu Mare. Present The school has 28 high school classes and 4 secondary school classes. The classes have different specializations: mathematics and science, natural sciences, social sciences and modern languages. Some classes are bilingually specialized: English and French, and others are in intensive learning science.

It is an amalgamation of the New Plymouth Public Library (founded in 1848) and the Taranaki Museum (founded in 1919). Its name, MƒÅori for \\"hill of chiefs\\", is taken from the MƒÅori village that formerly occupied the site.  Site  Puke Ariki (MƒÅori: hill of chiefs) was the site of a significant MƒÅori pƒÅ of Te ƒÄti Awa, dating back to 1700, with a marae called Para-huka. It was the home of the paramount rangatira (chief) Te Rangi-apiti- rua. The pƒÅ was deserted around 1830 when the majority of Te ƒÄti Awa moved to the Wellington region and Kapiti Coast. When colonial settlement began in the area, the hill was renamed Mount Eliot by the New Plymouth settlers, and much of it was removed for land reclamation to form the railway yards. By 1905 it had largely been demolished.  Origins  The New Plymouth Public Library was founded in 1848, as a Mechanics Institute and Library (often referred to as the institute). It initially was run from the premises of a school on Vivian Street, then in October 1852 moved to an auction room on Devon St. It was renamed the Literary Institute in 1856, but had no funding to build a permanent home for some years, and much of its collection was destroyed in a fire in 1859. The Institute and Library occupied the ground floor of the newly built Provincial Council Town Hall building in 1865, but despite paying no rent it fell into debt and was dissolved in 1878, although the reading room remained. The first museum exhibits in New Plymouth date back to 1865 and were housed in the Town Hall; for many years the museum, library, and reading room were regarded as one organisation. Reading room fees were imposed from 1880, but in 1884 the Council declared that the reading room would function as a \\"free public library\\", although funding was quite limited, its librarians were untrained, and its collection was very disordered. All this changed when a new Carnegie Free Library, funded by a ¬£2,500 grant from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, was built on a site on King Street and opened in July 1908. The first full-time librarian, a Miss Free, was appointed in 1908 at a salary of ¬£60 (she remained on staff for 22 years, later as Assistant Librarian, resigning in 1942). In November 1895, William Skinner first petitioned the council for a dedicated room for the Museum in the Town Hall building; a similar petition was received in 1900. In 1913 Skinner and his son Prof. H. D. Skinner offered the town their collection of MƒÅori artifacts and historical documents, on the condition that they be displayed in a suitably furnished fireproof building that would function as a \\"purely Taranaki museum\\". An annex was eventually built behind the Carnegie Library at a cost of ¬£3,000; the old Town Hall exhibits were moved there in 1918, and the Skinner collection in 1919. The Taranaki Museum opened on 28 August 1919. The original 1960 War Memorial building now houses the library and archives of Puke Ariki The library was reorganised on a Dewey system in 1922, and the headquarters of the Polynesian Society moved to Wellington in 1925, creating more space. In 1927 contention over the ownership and display of two MƒÅori treasures ‚Äì the anchor stone of the Tokomaru canoe and the adze used in its construction ‚Äì was resolved in a meeting between museum administration and representatives of three iwi. By the 1930s, the museum and library were considered hopelessly overcrowded, and a new site was sought, but it was many years before approval was granted for a combined library, museum, and war memorial building on a site bounded by King, Brougham, and Ariki streets. The building was designed by Taylor and Collins, and the contractors were Fairbrother, Snowden and Wheeler Ltd. Planning began in 1954, and the four-story building opened on 14 July 1960. Its top floor was the War Memorial Hall, the next floor the Taranaki Museum, and the mezzanine and ground floors the library. One wing, designated for art display, was occupied by the North Taranaki Society for Arts, until they were forced out by a need for more museum display space.  The 2003 building  Tukotahi/Standing Together By the 1980s, both library and museum were running out of room for storage and display. Planning for an expanded building to be called Puke Ariki, after the original pƒÅ site, began in 1993. It was intended to amalgamate the Taranaki Museum and existing public library. The Council committed NZ$12.3 million in funding, and another $11 million was raised externally. The architects were local firm Boon Goldsmith Bhaskar (Team Architecture), and construction was carried out by Clelands Construction. Their brief was to retrofit the original 1960 War Memorial building and construct an addition 5000 m2 museum space. The architects designed the new building to reach the same height as the former Puke Ariki hill before it was excavated as landfill, placing the MƒÅori Taonga level at the original height of above ground level. The building exterior was clad in a woven wall. Puke Ariki was opened by the Prime Minister Helen Clark on 15 June 2003. Eight Taranaki iwi collaborated on the Puke Ariki project; in 1996‚Äì97 a Komiti MƒÅori was formed to represent them and give input into the project. The 1960 War Memorial building contains the library, archives, and research centre, and connects via a second floor airbridge with the new building containing the museum, iSite information centre, cafe, and restaurant. In front of Puke Ariki is a 2001 carved pou (pole), Tukotahi/Standing Together, depicting the first meeting of MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ settlers in Taranaki. The largest cultural project ever undertaken in the Taranaki region, Puke Ariki won Creative New Zealand's prestigious Creative Places Award for 2003.  Collections  The founding museum collections donated by William Skinner were well-documented MƒÅori taonga (treasures), including a rare dogskin cloak (huruhuru kurƒ´). Skinner was a Taranaki surveyor, and later Commissioner of Crown Lands in Blenheim, so had travelled extensively and was well known to local iwi. The current collections consist primarily of archives, social history, taonga MƒÅori, and a large pictorial collection. A significant feature of the taonga MƒÅori collection are the Motonui epa or panels. Forming the back wall of a pataka or storehouse, they are thought to have been crafted by Te ƒÄti Awa artisans between 1750 and 1820. The panels were buried in a swamp near Motonui for safekeeping during tribal warfare. Rediscovered in 1972, they were sold to George Ortiz, a Bolivian collector residing in Switzerland, for US$65,000. Ortiz took them out of New Zealand, violating laws on the export of national treasures, then in 1978 attempted to sell them to recoup a ransom he had paid for his kidnapped daughter. After many years of negotiation and Ortiz's death in 2013, the New Zealand government paid $4.5 million to have them returned, and in March 2014 they were deposited in Puke Ariki under a guardianship arrangement agreed to by the Crown, Te ƒÄti Awa, and NgƒÅti Rahiri. They went on display in the Takapou Whariki o Taranaki gallery in October 2015. The greater part of the photographic collection is the Swainson/Woods studios collection of over 111,000 negatives of vernacular photography from the 1920s to the 1990s, donated in 2005 and digitised by 2016.  Staff  Rigby Allan, appointed Acting Curator of the then-Taranaki Museum in 1959, became Director in November 1961 and retired in 1973. Ron Lambert became Director of the museum in 1975, at which time there were only three staff. He became Collection Manager in 1999, then Senior Researcher in 2001 before that role was disestablished in a 2016 restructure. Roger Fyfe was Deputy Director from 1979 to 1992, before joining Canterbury Museum as an Curator of Ethnology. Kelvin Day, who started at Taranaki Museum in 1992, and had been Manager Heritage Collections since 2008, was appointed Director in March 2013. He left in January 2019, and was replaced as Manager by the acting director of the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery, Colleen Mullin.  Exhibitions  Puke Ariki's most popular exhibition was Bugs! Our Backyard Heroes, curated by Aimee Burbery, which ran from November 2016 to May 2017. As well as pinned specimens from the Ken Fox collection, it featured live cockroaches, stick insects, centipedes, and spiders. Bugs! attracted over 65,000 visitors, and broke the daily visitor record on 3 January 2017 with 1788 attendees. Hina: Celebrating Taranaki Women featured the stories of 11 different Taranaki women, and was curated by Kararina Te Ira, curator of Taonga MƒÅori. It opened on the 125th anniversary of women's suffrage in New Zealand and closed in March 2019.

She received her formative musical training under Gillian Bibby at the Wellington Polytechnic. She then moved to Australia, where she studied composition in Sydney with Peter Sculthorpe. Singing with the Sydney University Chamber Choir under the direction of Nicholas Routley introduced her to the intricate Renaissance polyphony that affected her early compositions. Early compositions In 1985 Maclean composed Christ the King, a setting of New Zealand poet James K. Baxter, which has received numerous performances in both Australia and North America, as well as several recordings. Conceived as several interpolations for a performance of John Taverner‚Äôs \\"Westron Wynde\\" Mass, the composer subsequently tied them together to create a single work that combines elements of plainchant and hymnody with polyphonic passages. The composer‚Äôs ingenious weaving and re-ordering of two Baxter poems, ‚ÄòSong to the Father‚Äô and ‚ÄòSong to the Lord God on a Spring Morning,‚Äô was an early indication (in 1984) of her acute sensitivity to text, a trait that runs through all her subsequent works. In the same year, Maclean also revised four solo settings of Baxter‚Äôs verse. Over the next four years she composed two other major commissions for the Sydney Chamber Choir, \\"Et Misericordia\\" (1986) and \\"A West Irish Ballad\\" (1988). These three works formed the basis for a CD devoted entirely to her music, performed by the Sydney Chamber Choir and released in 1995 on the Tall Poppies label (TP 073). Maturing style During the 1990s Maclean continued to absorb and process a wide range of influences, from the aleatoric effects in \\"Hope There Is\\" (1990), to the use of folksong and chant in Leise rieselt der Schnee (1996). Other significant works from this period include \\"Love Was His Meaning\\" (1992) and \\"We Welcome Summer\\" (1996). Music from this period reveals Maclean‚Äôs growing use of repetitive, almost hypnotic phrases, as well as the overlaying of different rhythms and even text. Nowhere is this more apparent than the short piece, commissioned for the Sydney Children‚Äôs Choir, titled \\"Rain\\" that comprises a series of onomatopoeic syllables to suggest a rain shower. Since her early success Maclean has continued to write to commission, but her appeal has extended beyond her ‚Äòalma mater,‚Äô the Sydney Chamber Choir that had evolved from its original association with the university. She has written for The Maquarrie Singers, the Tasmanian Consort (1990), and The Australian Voices of Brisbane (1995). She wrote her 2002 setting of \\"Aunque Es De Noche\\" for the Sydney Philharmonia Chorus, and in 2003 she wrote \\"In The Year That King Uzziah Died\\" for the Adelaide-based vocal quartet, SYNTONY. More recently, her orchestral work \\"Panah\\" was selected as one of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra‚Äôs Readings in 2008, under the direction of conductor Scott Parkman. In an odd twist of coincidence, Parkman had previously served as Assistant Conductor of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (USA), a city that has hosted more Maclean performances and commissions than any other. This is explained by the relationship Clare Maclean has enjoyed with the Saint Louis Chamber Chorus, a professional chamber choir for which she has served as Composer-in- ResidenceChoral concert focuses on Fall Review: Collaborative performance is complex and impressive since 2005. For this ensemble she composed first \\"Os Anthos Chortou: As the flowers of grass\\"‚Äìsetting Sappho in the original ancient Greek; then in 2007 \\"Misera ancor do Loco\\" (a conclusion in Italian to Monteverdi‚Äôs fragmentary sequence, \\"Lamento d'Arianna,\\" 2007) and \\"Vive in Deo!\\" (a series of ancient Greek and Latin epitaphs) and Psalm 137 (in Hebrew, 2009). The St Louis Chamber Chorus has also recorded several of her works on compact disc. Future commissions for this choir include performances in November 2009 and December 2010. At the APRA Music Awards of 2012 she won an Art Music Award in the category Work of the Year ‚Äì Vocal or Choral for Osanna Mass. Recordings *Clare Maclean, the Complete choral music.

The technique is also known as provider bridging, Stacked VLANs, or simply QinQ or Q-in-Q. \\"Q-in-Q\\" can for supported devices apply to C-tag stacking on C-tag (Ethernet Type = 0x8100). The original 802.1Q specification allows a single Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) header to be inserted into an Ethernet frame. QinQ allows multiple VLAN tags to be inserted into a single frame, an essential capability for implementing Metro Ethernet network topologies. Just as QinQ extends 802.1Q, QinQ itself is extended by other Metro Ethernet protocols. In a multiple VLAN header context, out of convenience the term \\"VLAN tag\\" or just \\"tag\\" for short is often used in place of \\"802.1Q VLAN header\\". QinQ allows multiple VLAN tags in an Ethernet frame; together these tags constitute a tag stack. When used in the context of an Ethernet frame, a QinQ frame is a frame that has 2 VLAN 802.1Q headers (double-tagged). Background 802.1ad specifies architecture and bridge protocols to provide separate instances of the medium access control (MAC) services to multiple independent users of a bridged local area network in a manner that does not require cooperation among the users and requires a minimum amount of cooperation between the users and the provider of the MAC service. The idea is to provide, for example, the possibility for customers to run their own VLANs inside service provider's provided VLAN. This way the service provider can just configure one VLAN for the customer and customer can then treat that VLAN as if it were a trunk. IEEE 802.1ad was created for the following reasons: # 802.1Q has a 12-bit VLAN ID field, which has a theoretical limit of 212=4096 tags. With the growth of networks, this limitation has become more acute. A double-tagged frame has a theoretical limitation of 4096√ó4096=16777216, sufficient to accommodate network growth for the next several years. # The addition of a second tag allows operations that would not have been available had the VLAN ID field simply been expanded from 12 bits to 24 bits (or any other large value). Having multiple tags‚Äîthe tag stack‚Äîallows switches to more easily modify frames. In a tag stack scheme, switches can add (\\"push\\"), remove (\\"pop\\") or modify single or multiple tags. # A multi-tagged frame not only has multiple VLAN IDs, but has multiple VLAN header bit fields. # A tag stack creates a mechanism for Internet Service Providers to encapsulate customer single-tagged 802.1Q traffic with a single tag, the final frame being a QinQ frame. The outer tag is used to identify and segregate traffic from different customers; the inner tag is preserved from the original frame. # QinQ frames are convenient means of constructing Layer 2 tunnels, or applying Quality of service (QoS) policies, etc. # 802.1ad is upward compatible with 802.1Q. Although 802.1ad is limited to two tags, there is no ceiling on the standard limiting a single frame to more than two tags, allowing for growth in the protocol. In practice Service Provider topologies often anticipate and utilize frames having more than two tags. # It is easier for networking equipment makers to modify their existing equipment by creating multiple 802.1Q headers than to modify their equipment to implement some hypothetical new non-802.1Q extended VLAN ID field header. The IEEE 802.1ad standard was approved December 8, 2005, and published May 26, 2006. Frame format Insertion of 802.1ad DoubleTag in Ethernet-II frame These examples are for an Ethernet II framing (length/ethertype field => ethertype) frame. This could also be applied to 802.3 frames (length/ethertype field => length), with or without an LLC (i.e. Logical Link Control), LLC+SNAP header. The top frame is a simple Ethernet II frame. The middle frame has a 802.1q tag added to it. The bottom frame has yet another 802.1q added to it. An 802.1Q header, which is 4 bytes long, is added to an untagged Ethernet II frame in the following manner: # The 4-byte tag is inserted between the MAC Source Address (SAMAC) of the untagged frame and its ethertype field. # The newly inserted VLAN header's ethertype is set to 0x8100 to identify the following data as a VLAN tag. # 12 bits are used for the VLAN ID, the other bits in the VLAN fields are filled in according to the QoS policy, etc. of the interface at which the tag imposition occurred. Notice that after the insertion of a .1Q header to an untagged frame, the frame's original ethertype appears to have been changed to 0x8100. The untagged frame's original ethertype in the single- tag frame is now located adjacent to the payload. Its value is unchanged. A second 802.1Q header is added to a single-tagged frame in the following manner: # The second tag is inserted in front of the first tag, meaning the second tag is closer to the Ethernet header than the first (original) tag. # The second tag is inserted between the MAC SAMAC and the first (original) tag. # The second tag is assigned an ethertype of 0x88A8 (instead of the .1Q standard 0x8100) by default. (An old non-standard 802.1QinQ protocol used 0x9100.) # 12 bits are used for the VLAN ID, the other bits in the VLAN fields are filled in according to the QoS policy, etc. of the interface at which the tag imposition occurred. Any third or subsequent tag imposition will insert the tag in front of, closest to the Ethernet header, than the preceding tags. The frame's original (from untagged) ethertype is always located after all the tags and adjacent to the payload. In the case of an 802.3 frame, this ethertype would be a length value instead, and would contain the length from there to the end of the frame. In the case of an 802.3 frame with an LLC header, the LLC header stays after the length field and adjacent to the payload. The conventions for 802.1ad terminology typically are as follows: # The inner tag is the tag which is closest to the payload portion of the frame; it is officially called C-TAG (Customer tag, with ethertype 0x8100). # The outer tag is the one closer/closest to the Ethernet header; its name is S-TAG (Service tag, ethertype 0x88a8). # tag 1 is the outer tag; tag 2, the second tag, is the inner tag. The tag number has nothing to do with the order in which the tags were added, etc. It is simply a convention. # For a single- tagged (802.1q) frame, that tag is designated tag 1 when mixed with 802.1ad tags. # In frames having more than one tag, the tags are numbered 1 to N, and appear sequentially and contiguously in the frame from Ethernet header to payload. In this case the innermost tag is the C-TAG and all other tags are S-TAGs. In IEEE 802.1ad the CFI is replaced by a Drop Eligibility Indicator (DEI), increasing the functionality of the PCP field. Tag operations In a tag stack, push and pop operations are done at the outer tag end of the stack, therefore: The tag added by a tag push operation becomes a new outer tag. The tag to be removed by a tag pop operation is the current outer tag. Examples= Virtual networks = Simple QinQ Example This simple example will illustrate a practical use of 802.1ad. The diagram shows switches as hexagons, and a Service Provider (SP) network encompassing all items within the dotted oval. The items on the periphery of the oval are networks belonging to SP customers. Different physical locations appear in the shaded rectangle, and include both customer and SP network components. A Service Provider (SP) offers L2 connectivity to customers in the cities of Seattle and Tacoma. Two corporations, \\"Acme\\" and \\"XYZ\\", have a campus located in both Seattle and Tacoma. All campuses run Ethernet LANs, and the customers intend to connect through the SP's L2 VPN network so that their campuses are in the same LAN (L2 network). It is desirable for Acme and XYZ to have a single LAN in both Seattle and Tacoma, obviating the alternative of having two LANs in which traffic must be routed between the LANs. The SP has two switches, one in Seattle (S-Switch #1), and one in Tacoma (S-Switch #2). The customers interface to the SP network in switches designated \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". Each customer has its own pair of A and B switches. Acme switch A is connected to S-Switch #1 through link \\"A1\\"; the rest of the links are labelled. S-Switch #1 and #2 are connected by link S12. Acme's LAN uses VLAN IDs 10,11,12 in their network. The connections A1 and A2 are Ethernet trunks that have single-tagged VLAN traffic, the traffic using IDs 10,11,12. Likewise XYZ uses IDs 11,12,13 in their network, so X1 and X2 are also trunks with single tagged traffic of IDs 11,12,13. The SP, having one network and one connection between S-Switch #1 and S-Switch #2, must segregate Acme's and XYZ's traffic. Since both Acme and XYZ share some VLAN IDs, traffic cannot be segregated by customer VLAN ID. The solution is for the SP to use 802.1ad in their network. They assign a single, unique outer VLAN tag ID of 100 for Acme, and a unique outer VLAN ID of 101 for XYZ. All traffic sent from Acme A to the SP network (sent on A1, destined for Acme B) will have a tag of ID=100 pushed. The inner tag will be either 10,11,12, the original Acme tag. The traffic will be sent through S12 in this format, and just before it exits S-Switch #2 bound for Acme B (link A2), all traffic will undergo a single pop operation, removing the outer VLAN tag with the ID 100. This pop operation is the inverse of the former push operation, with the net result of no change to the traffic. The traffic passes through the SP network as 802.1ad frames, but no 802.1ad frames are sent to or received from the customer. =Problems with previous example= An experienced network engineer will immediately recognize the shortcomings of the above example. This is the reason why 802.1ad is more of a definition for a method of adding multiple tags to a frame than it is an end-to-end self- contained solution. It is used in conjunction with other protocols and standards. The problems with the above example are: # Many switches bridge Ethernet traffic based on MAC addresses‚Äînot on VLAN IDs. This is called Shared VLAN Learning and is done per 802.1d MAC learning/MAC aging, etc. # Should Acme and XYZ use the same MAC addresses in their networks, this will cause problems with the MAC learning, as the assumption in MAC learning is that no two hosts use the same MAC address. In other words, a MAC should only be learned from a single switch's port. # The SP network must learn all customer MAC addresses in order to switch them. This does not scale well. # There is no provision in the above example for L2 protocol frames, Spanning Tree being the most important. # Additional QoS capabilities are lacking. # Bridges that use Independent VLAN Learning (IVL), i.e., the first VLAN tag is included as part of the SAMAC address, circumvent the problems mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2. IVL resolves the problem of MAC addresses possibly being used by more than one customer. However, switches en route still have to learn all inserted VLAN/MAC address combinations (12 + 48 = 60 bits). # Broadcasts from LAN to LAN is always an issue to consider. Provider Bridges (802.1ad) and Provider Backbone Bridges (the IEEE 802.1ah-2008 standard) address the above problems by a further modified SAMAC learning method.

The Maiden Lane Bridge was a railroad bridge across the Hudson River between the city of Albany and Rensselaer County, New York. It was designed by Kellogg, Clark & Co., and was one of the largest bridges they designed. The bridge was owned and built by the Hudson River Bridge Company, which was owned jointly by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company which owned 3/4, and the Boston and Albany Railroad Company which owned 1/4. The Maiden Lane Bridge was often referred to as the \\"South Bridge\\", while the Livingston Avenue Bridge was referred to as the \\"North Bridge\\". The Livingston Ave. Bridge was used for freight (and through-traffic passenger trains) while passenger trains used the Maiden Lane Bridge for access to Union Station, which was completed less than 10 months later. The state of New York authorized construction on May 10, 1869, construction began in May 1870, and the first train crossed on December 28, 1871. The bridge consisted of four long fixed spans, one long draw span, seven long spans over the Albany Basin, one long span over Quay Street, and one long span over Maiden Lane. All the spans except the one over Maiden Lane were double tracked, through, and pin connected; the span over Maiden Lane was also double tracked, but was a deck and plate girder span. A reconstruction of the bridge, except for the draw span, was done in 1899 by Pencoyd Bridge Company and finished by January 3, 1900. The bridge lasted until the 1960s, when the Albany-Rensselaer Amtrak Station was built on the east side of the Hudson in the city of Rensselaer and Interstate 787 was built along the west side in Albany, thereby eliminating the need of the bridge.

The Duke of Berwick led 100,000 men up the Rhine Valley in opposition to Austrian forces, of which 60,000 were detached to invest the fortress at Philippsburg, beginning on 1 June 1734. A relief column of 35,000 under the aging Prince Eugene of Savoy (accompanied by Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia) was unsuccessful in actually relieving the siege. On 12 June Berwick was killed by a cannonball while inspecting the trenches, and command of the besiegers fell to Marshals d'Asfeld and Noailles. The fortress surrendered one month later, and the garrison withdrew to the fortress of Mainz with the honours of war. D'Asfeld was promoted to Marshal of France for his role in the campaign; Wuttgenau was promoted to lieutenant general for his spirited defense of the fortress. Background On the death of Augustus II on 1 February 1733, the Polish throne was claimed by both his son, Augustus III, and by Stanislas I, father in law of King Louis XV of France. Whilst a body double ostensibly left Brest by sea, Stanislas crossed Germany incognito and arrived at Warsaw on 8 September. On 12 September Stanislas was elected king of Poland by the diet. On his election Russia and Austria, both of whom backed Augustus III, invaded Poland. By 22 September Stanislas, who did not have a proper army, had to take refuge in Danzig (now known as Gda≈Ñsk), there to await the French help he had been promised. On 5 October, Augustus III was proclaimed king, protected by Russian forces at Warsaw. Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Sweden, Denmark and the Republic of Venice recognised that Austro-Russian aggression against Poland was the casus belli and pledged to remain neutral. Spain, coveting the Kingdom of Naples and Sardinia, which the Duke of Milan wanted, sided with France. Louis XV's courtiers (including the princes of Conti and Eu, the counts of Clermont, Charolais and Belle-Isle, the duc de Richelieu, but also Maurice de Saxe, Augustus III's half-brother and the former lover of Anna Ivanovna, now the tsarina of Russia) joined up under marshal James FitzJames, Duke of Berwick to form an army for invading the Rhineland with the objectives of gaining the Duchy of Lorraine and distracting Austria from events in Poland. In the fall of 1733 the French army crossed the Rhine and besieged Kehl, near Strasbourg. Although they captured and occupied the fortress, most of the army was withdrawn to the west bank of the Rhine due to the onset of winter in December. During the winter, Austrian field marshal Prince Eugene of Savoy began gathering forces of the empire at a camp near Heilbronn to oppose the French. By the spring of 1734 these forces were still significantly smaller than those of France, which had nearly 70,000 men in the field. Freiherr Gottfried Ernst von Wuttgenau was given command of the fortress at Philippsburg in December 1733. The fortress was in deplorable condition, and its moat had in places been filled to the point where the ramparts could easily be approached. He focused defensive preparations on the fortress' flood controls, a significant defense against besiegers who were required to work in the swampy terrain below the fortress, while his engineer, Gerhard Cornelius von Walrave, directed repairs and improvements to the fortress' eastern works, where attacks had been focused in the past. By the spring of 1734 these preparations were largely complete, although the garrison was short of ammunition and experienced artillery personnel and engineers. The defenders consisted of a battalion of Walseggers, companies from the Kaiser's regiments of W√ºrttemberg, Max Hessen, Kettler, M√ºfflingen, Sachsen-Gotha, Wolfenb√ºttel, Walsegg, and Bevern, the Frankish H√∂ltzl regiment, and companies from the Frankish Bassewitz and Heller regiments. Siege In late May 1734, the French began surrounding the fortress at Philippsburg. A total of 46 battalions were deployed, with 14 on the left bank of the Rhine, and the balance on the right bank, cutting the land approaches to the fortress. Of the troops on the right bank, half were dedicated to the siege, while the rest were detailed to defend the siege camp against any attempts to relieve the siege. On May 26 they began digging the outer trench surrounding the fortress with a complement of 12,000 men. The siege works progressed under Berwick until June 12, when he was felled by a lucky shot while examining siege works at a forward position. Command of the besieging army then came to d'Asfeld. On June 19, Eugene, under orders from the Kaiser, began moving his army, which had since grown to over 70,000 men, toward Philippsburg with the goal of relieving the siege. On June 27 the army reached Bruchsal. D'Asfeld responded by building additional boat-bridges over the Rhine to speed the movement of cavalry across the river, and redirected some of the siege personnel to face Eugene's threat. The French position was further inconvenienced when heavy rains on July 5 caused portions of their position to be flooded. Despite these difficulties, Eugene failed to act decisively to capitalize on the situation, and withdrew his army. By July 17 the French had penetrated the fortress' defenses to its inner moat, and were threatening the heart of the fortress. After failing to establish contact with Eugene, Wuttgenau and d'Asfeld agreed to terms of capitulation early on July 18.

History St. Hyacinth's Church was founded by the Dominican Order and adjoins Warsaw's largest monastery. The church is a mixture of Renaissance and early-Baroque styles. Its construction began in 1603 and it was completed in 1639. During the construction and shortly afterwards the church was encompassed with ornate chapels. In 1627 Jadwiga Mi≈Ñska established the Holy Cross Chapel, the so-called Dark Chapel, and in 1651 the Royal Musicians founded the Chapel of Our Lady of the Snows. When Warsaw was captured by Swedish and Brandenburgian forces in 1655, the church shared the same fate as other buildings in the city. it was ransacked and burned. After the war it was rebuilt and consecrated in 1661 by bishop Wojciech Tolibowski, the bishop of Pozna≈Ñ. In 1662 the bell tower was erected, adjacent to the church, and in 1690 the Wyszogr√≥d pantler Adam Kotowski established the most important church feature - the St. Dominic Chapel. The ornate baroque building was constructed according to the design by prominent Warsaw architect Tylman Gamerski. The 18th century was the age of the church's greatest prosperity. The monastery's library possessed the richest collection of volumes in Poland. Unfortunately it was later completely destroyed. During World War II, the church and monastery served the Polish forces in the Warsaw Uprising as a field hospital. This fact turned these buildings into targets of frequent bombings by the Germans. During the bombardments over a thousand civilians and insurgents were killed. Interior Interior of St. Hyacinth's Church The facade is baroque, although the interior is completely modern, because very few of the original furnishings of the church were preserved. Among them, the most interesting are the tomb monuments - the mannerist tomb of Katarzyna Ossoli≈Ñska, constructed in 1607 (it was only partially reconstructed); the tomb of Anna Tarnowska, carved from brown Chƒôciny marble in about 1616, which depicts Anna in the typical Polish sepulchral art sleeping pose; the black marble epitaph of Regina Sroczy≈Ñska, a wealthy merchant from Krak√≥w, originally adorned with a coffin portrait of Regina painted on tin plate. Next to the sanctuary there is a chapel for St. Dominic with the most valuable element of the church's furnishing - an 18th-century wooden statue of Ecce Homo by Antoni Osi≈Ñski, with profuse stucco decorations, a black marble altar and a portal.

The portrayal of drivers ranges from the heroes of the 1950s, living a life of freedom on the open road, to the depiction of troubled serial killers of the 1990s. Songs and movies about truck drivers were first popular in the 1940s, and mythologized their wandering lifestyle in the 1960s. Truck drivers were glorified as modern day cowboys, outlaws, and rebels during the peak of trucker culture in the 1970s. During the latter portion of the 20th century, the trucking industry's image began to wane, and their reputation suffered. More recent portrayals of truckers have been as male chauvinists or serial killers. Portrayals of the actual semi-trailer trucks has largely concentrated on stories of the machines becoming sentient, or self-aware, usually with extraterrestrial assistance (as in Maximum Overdrive). 20th century=1939-1980= In the early days of trucking culture, truck drivers were more frequently portrayed as protagonists in the popular media. In Trucking country: The road to America's Wal-Mart economy, author Shane Hamilton explores the history of trucking and how developments in the trucking industry helped the so-called big-box stores dominate the U.S. marketplace. The 1940 film They Drive by Night co-starred Humphrey Bogart as an independent truck driver struggling to become economically independent during the Great Depression. The Gang's All Here was a story about a trucking company targeted by saboteurs, released in 1941. In the 1950s, truck drivers were considered the \\"Knights of the Road\\" for helping stranded travelers. Drivers were viewed as the antithesis of \\"The Organization Man\\" (the title of William H. Whyte's 1956 bestseller) or \\"the man in the gray flannel suit\\", who sat in an office every day or was watched over by managers. Popular trucking songs glorified the life of drivers as independent \\"wanderers\\", while attempts to bring factory-style efficiency (using tachographs) to trucking were met with little success. Drivers routinely sabotaged and discovered new ways to falsify the machine's records. \\"Six Days on the Road\\" was a chart-topping trucker hit released in 1963 by country music singer Dave Dudley. Author and country music historian Bill Malone notes the song \\"effectively captured both the boredom and the excitement, as well as the swaggering masculinity, that often accompanied long distance trucking\\". The decade of the 70s saw the heyday of truck driving, and the dramatic rise in the popularity of trucker culture. Truck drivers were romanticized as modern-day cowboys and outlaws (and this stereotype persists even today). This was due in part to their use of Citizens Band (CB) radio to relay information to each other regarding the locations of police officers and transportation authorities. Plaid shirts, trucker hats, CB radios, and using CB slang were popular not just with drivers but among the general public. Author Lawrence Ouellet examines the work lives of truck drivers in his book, Pedal to the metal. The 1971 made-for-tv film Duel portrayed a truck driver as an anonymous stalker, and was the first feature-length film directed by Steven Spielberg. White Line Fever was a film released in 1975, that told the story of a Vietnam War veteran who returns home to take over his father's trucking business, only to find that corrupt shippers want to force him to carry illegal contraband. The movie played upon several cowboy and western film motifs, and portrayed the notion that truck drivers are possessed with a certain wanderlust. In 1976, the number one hit on the Billboard chart was \\"Convoy\\", a novelty song about a convoy of truck drivers evading speed traps and toll booths across America. The song inspired the 1978 action film Convoy, featuring a shirtless and defiant Kris Kristofferson screaming \\"Piss on your law!\\" After the film's release, thousands of independent truck drivers went on strike and participated in violent protests during the 1979 energy crisis (although similar strikes had occurred during the 1973 energy crisis). The year 1977 saw the release of Smokey and the Bandit, the third-highest-grossing film of that year, beaten only by Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Protagonist Burt Reynolds as \\"The Bandit\\", who escorts \\"The Snowman\\" in an effort to deliver contraband (or \\"bootleg\\") beer, envisions trucking as a \\"hedonistic joyride entirely devoid from economic reality\\". Breaker! Breaker! was another 1977 action film focused on truck drivers, starring Chuck Norris and displaying movie posters with the tagline \\"...he's got a CB radio and a hundred friends who just might get mad!\\" Sylvester Stallone starred in the 1978 film F.I.S.T., a story loosely based on the Teamsters Union (a labor union which includes truck drivers) and its then president, Jimmy Hoffa. =1980-2000= The latter portion of the 20th century saw the decline of trucking culture, and the image of drivers generally moved to a more negative portrayal. As a result truck drivers were frequently portrayed as antagonists in movies. In 1982, a southern California truck driver named Larry Walters gained short-lived fame as \\"Lawn Chair Larry\\", for pulling a stunt in which he ascended to a height of by attaching helium balloons to a lawn chair. Walters claims he intended to float low to the ground, but was surprised when his chair initially shot up at a rate of per minute. Walters blamed poor eyesight for ruining his dreams to become an Air Force pilot, which eventually led to his stunt. The 1984 animated TV series The Transformers told the story of a group of extraterrestrial humanoid robots, who are disguised as automobiles. The leader of the protagonist Autobots clan, Optimus Prime, is depicted as a semi-truck. The American Trucking Associations initiated a campaign in 1985 to improve the trucking industry's image in the face of declining public opinion. One such move was changing the name of the \\"National Truck Rodeo\\" to the \\"National Driving Championship\\", because the term \\"rodeo\\" seemed to imply reckless driving. The 1986 horror film Maximum Overdrive by author Stephen King was a campy story about trucks which had become sentient due to radiation emanating from a passing comet. The trucks force the humans to pump their diesel fuel, and the leader is depicted with the face of Spider-Man's antagonist Green Goblin. The 1991 film Thelma & Louise featured a recurring minor character, a dirty and abrasive truck driver who frequently harasses the main characters during chance encounters. Author Michael Dunne describes the character as \\"fat and ignorant\\" and \\"a lustful fool blinded by a delusion of male superiority\\". Thelma and Louise eventually get their revenge by feigning interest in him, then blowing up his tanker truck full of gasoline. The most infamous image of the 1992 Los Angeles riots was the Reginald Denny incident. Denny was a white truck driver who was assaulted in a black neighborhood during the riots, and was almost beaten to death. The footage received nationwide media coverage, and the defendants in the case (the \\"L.A. Four\\") claimed to be fighting \\"economic oppression\\". Long-haul trucker Keith Hunter Jesperson made headlines in 1994 when it was discovered he was the \\"Happy Face Killer\\". The 1998 film Black Dog starred Patrick Swayze as a truck driver recently released from prison, who was then manipulated into transporting illegal guns. Author Scott Doviak describes the movie as a \\"high-octane riff on White Line Fever\\" and \\"a throwback to the trucker movies of the 70s\\". In 1999, The Simpsons episode Maximum Homerdrive aired. It featured Homer and Bart making a delivery for a truck driver named Red after he unexpectedly dies of 'food poisoning'. 21st century The 2001 feature film Joy Ride portrayed the story of two college- aged brothers who purchase a CB radio while on a road trip. After attempting to play a prank on an anonymous truck driver, the pair soon learn the driver is a dangerous killer. In the 2008 direct-to-DVD sequel Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead, the truck driver (\\"Rusty Nail\\") plays psychological mind games with a young couple who are on a road trip. Suspect Zero was a 2004 film which featured a truck driver as the ultimate serial killer, committing crimes in all 50 states without leaving evidence behind to link his crimes together. Also in 2004, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative. The lead suspect in the case was John Williams, a long-haul truck driver who was later convicted of murdering a woman in Mississippi. The 2008 feature film Trucker addressed the unique perspective of a female truck driver. Starring Michelle Monaghan, the actress spent time with other female truckers and actually applied for her commercial driver's license. She claims that if she had failed the driving test, she would have backed out of the role. Los Angeles Times author Paul Brownfield described the film as a small, low-budget character piece, and a stark contrast to the starring actress' previous role in Made of Honor. In 2009, the FBI released the results of a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating more than 500 unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists, many of whom were dumped on or near major trucking routes. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators surmise that the mobility and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. In response to the investigation, executive vice president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, Todd Spencer, said \\"Truckers are just absolutely outraged that various media sources or the FBI would draw the conclusion that truckers are over-represented in the ranks of serial killers\\". The third season of the reality television show Ice Road Truckers premiered on the History Channel in 2009, documenting the lives of truck drivers working the Dalton Highway in Alaska. The show follows drivers as they compete to see who can haul the most loads before the end of the season, while avoiding the pitfalls of dangerous icy roads and mechanical problems.

It flew in 1947 but the design was abandoned when Miles Aircraft was taken over by Handley Page in 1948. Design and development The Miles M.71 MerchantmanFlight 28 August 1947 pp. 221-5 was intended to follow the successful Aerovan freighter as a larger aircraft built along similar lines. Miles aimed to provide a simple, sturdy high-wing monoplane with an easily accessible and configurable cargo or passenger space. This was achieved, as in the Aerovan by mounting the tail unit on a boom from the fuselage top, making access via the rear of the fuselage straightforward. Intended for greater loads the Merchantman was bigger, heavier and more powerful than its predecessor: its span was larger by a factor of 1.33, all up weight by 2.2 and power by 3.2. Unlike the Aerovan the Merchantman was intended to be a largely all-metal-framed aircraft, though the first prototype and only example built had wooden tail surfaces for speed of construction. The wing trailing edges behind the rear spar were fabric covered. The inner part of this trailing edge carried the usual Miles type flaps, hinged below the wings; the ailerons on the outer sections were, unusually, mounted below the wing in the same way. The benefits of this latter mounting were that they could act as flaps as well as ailerons, drooping when the flaps were lowered; and that, mounted in the lower wing airstream they produced less adverse yaw than a conventional aileron. The overall effect was rather like the Junkers \\"second wing\\", familiar from the Ju-52. The Merchantman's extra power came from both the number and choice of engines: it had four 250 hp (187 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Queen inverted inline motors. These were mounted in long cowlings on the underside of the wing, with fuel tanks behind the engine firewall. The Merchantman had a similar boom mounted tail to the Aerovan, with an almost straight leading edge to the horizontal stabiliser, carrying elevators with trim tabs on a strongly tapered trailing edge. There were three vertical surfaces, one central with a rudder and two endplate fins with large moveable surfaces that acted as trim tabs. The outer fins had the same shape found on many Miles aircraft: symmetrical and elliptical at the top but blunted below. The Aerovan's central fin was semi-elliptical, but the initial arrangement on the Merchantman continued the ellipse below the boom. This form was changed quite soon after the first flight tests, when a dorsal fin above the boom replaced the lower surface. The flat-sided fuselage did present a large keel area to be compensated by the fins. On the other hand, it produced a large uncluttered space that could be readily accessed via rear doors that included an integral ramp to the fuselage floor. It had a volume of 780 cu ft (22.1 m3) and the aircraft could carry loads of up to 5000 lbs (2,268 kg). Configured as a passenger aircraft, this space could seat twenty in five rows of four,Flight 18 September 1947 p.327 though there is no record that seats were installed. It had a tricycle undercarriage with stub axles mounted under the fuselage floor carrying short legs that bore a pair of small fixed main wheels, keeping the aircraft close to the ground for loading; the fuselage floor was only 2 ft (610 mm) above the ground. The nosewheel was steerable via the rudder bar as in the Aerovan. The Merchantman first flew in mid-August 1947,Flight 11 September 1947 pp. 280 appearing at the 1947 SBAC show at Radlett the following month with its new fin. Only one was built, registered as G-AILF and flown under B class conditions as U-21 at least as late as NovemberFlight 20 November 1947 p.587 1947\\\\. Miles Aircraft ceased trading in 1947 and their assets were taken over by Handley Page; the Merchantman was scrapped in 1948. The wing of the Merchantman and the Marathon had much in common and so the former survived for a time.

Life Ulitin was born in Migulinsky, a Cossack village located on the Don. His father was a surveyor murdered in 1921 by White Army bandits. His mother was a doctor and highly educated, having completed the most advanced courses then available to women in St. Petersburg. After finishing primary school Ulitin entered the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature, and History (IFLI), where he and his friends organized an anti- Stalin Communist club. This led to his arrest in 1938. Sixteen months later he was released due to poor health. The injuries he received during his imprisonment left him permanently disabled. At the end of the Second World War Ulitin returned to Moscow and began correspondence studies at the Moscow State Linguistic University. In 1951 he attempted to seek asylum in the United States embassy, but was arrested and committed to the Leningrad Prison Psychiatric Hospital, where he remained until 1954. He returned to his hometown, then went back to Moscow. In 1957 he completed his correspondence studies. He supported himself by teaching English and working as a clerk in a bookstore. He died in Moscow in 1986. Work Ulitin's early works were lost after his arrest. It is known that the manuscript of a novel was confiscated following his arrest in 1951, as were further writings following a search of his home in 1962. Inspired by the techniques of James Joyce, Ulitin created his own style, in which a 'concealed subject' is gradually created by the interlacing of a stream of consciousness, recollections of the narrator, quotations (many in foreign languages), scraps of dialogue, and monologues by incidental characters. Within the Soviet Union Ulitin's works were distributed through the samizdat. Beginning in 1976, thanks to the advocacy of Zinovy Zinik, his works began to appear in √©migr√© periodicals. The first post-Soviet publication of his works took place in the 1990s, and three more have been published since 2000 by Ivan Akhmetev. However, the greater part of Ulitin's oeuvre remains unpublished.

Over 2,500 children, aged 5‚Äì17, attend Skateistan's programs in Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa. 50% of students are girls. Through their innovative programs, Outreach, Skate and Create, Back-to-School, Dropping In and Youth Leadership, Skateistan aims to give children the opportunity to become leaders for a better world. Skateistan has Skate Schools in Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; and Johannesburg, South Africa. The international headquarters is in Berlin, Germany. History Girls Skate Lessons at Mekroyan Fountain where Skateistan first began, Kabul, Afghanistan in 2008 The idea of Skateistan began in 2007 when Australian Oliver Percovich arrived in Kabul, Afghanistan, with three skateboards and began skateboarding in the streets with children. Percovich perceived the lack of opportunities for young Afghans, especially girls and working children, and realized that skateboarding was a way to engage them and build community. Skateistan took shape in the following years, with the help of international donors and skateboard industry partners. It was officially registered as an Afghan NGO in July 2009. On October 29, 2009 in Kabul, Skateistan officially opened their first Skate School within a 1750 m2 facility that includes classrooms, offices, a sport court and the indoor skatepark. A second Skate School was opened in northern Afghanistan in May 2013, in the city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Skateistan has since grown to run their programs for children beyond Afghanistan. In 2011 Skateistan Cambodia was founded in Phnom Penh, and in 2014 Skateistan South Africa was founded in Johannesburg. In 2012, Skateistan moved its international administrative headquarters from Kabul, Afghanistan, to Berlin, Germany. Skateistan officially opened its Skate School in Johannesburg on August the 14th 2016. In February 2018, Skateistan opened a new Skate School in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The facility consists of a 500 m2 skatepark, a classroom, library, office and large green space. On April 11, 2018, Skateistan celebrated its 10th birthday marking 10 years of empowering children and youth through skateboarding and education in Afghanistan, Cambodia and South Africa. =Overview= Skateistan's programs are for children 5 to 17 years of age with a big focus on inclusion for girls, children with disabilities, and children from low- income backgrounds. The core programs work to keep children involved in the Skateistan community for the long term. As participants get older, they can become role models for the younger children and the wider community. Their mission is to empower children through skateboarding and education. =What they do: Programs= * Outreach Outreach sessions take place both at the Skate Schools and in the local communities. Educators and Youth Leadership participants head out with skateboards and sports equipment to engage with local children, providing an hour of recreational activity. It is often the first time they will try skateboarding, or other sports and their first contact with Skateistan. Skateistan also develops partnerships with child protection agencies in order to connect youth and their families with important social services. Through Outreach sessions, many students go on to register for the Skate and Create or Back-to-School program. * Skate and Create This 2-hour program consists of weekly skateboarding classes and an educational arts-based curriculum. In the classroom, Skateistan Educators use creative arts to teach a variety of topics, including human rights, cultural studies, nutrition and the environment. Lessons give youth tools to express themselves, think critically and develop confidence. In the skatepark, students find a valuable platform for self-expression and personal development. Accessible to all levels of literacy and education, Skate and Create provides a safe space for youth to develop friendships that overcome deep social barriers. * Dropping In The Dropping In program provides learning spaces and resources where students can develop their aspirations and navigate their potential. Children ‚Äòdrop in‚Äô for organized skateboarding and sports sessions, read in the Skate School libraries, join weekly book clubs and study groups, or use computers and quiet spaces to study. Even when public school is not in session, holiday programs, field trips, and events keep students learning and moving ahead. * Back to School Back-to-School is a program to support children in their pursuit of formal education. In Afghanistan, this is a fast-tracked learning program for children who are out of school. Students come to the Skate School five days a week to attend classes covering the national public curriculum. Upon completing the program, Skateistan enrolls students into public school, usually in the 3rd or 4th grade. In South Africa and Cambodia, the program takes place outside of school hours, where students can ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù and receive homework help and guidance with career and further education planning. * Youth Leadership Motivated older students at Skateistan can apply to join the Youth Leadership training program, assisting the Educators in classes, mentoring younger students, building their skill sets and planning local events. This program helps young people to develop a sense of ownership at the Skate Schools and creates role models for the other students and wider community.

SDSU Library and Information Access. (retrieved 25 July 2009) Tribal enrollment today is approximately 1,857 with 1,033 living on the Reservation. History=Tule River Farm= For thousands of years, this area was inhabited by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. Historic tribes encountered by Europeans in the area included the Yokuts, Mono and T√ºbatulabal. The area was first colonized by the Spanish and Mexicans, followed by European Americans after the US victory in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848. Following the Tule River Indian War of 1856, the Tule River Farm, a farm attached to the Tejon Agency, was established in 1858 at the base of the foothills, near the present town of Porterville. The farm was established on on the South Fork of Tule River. In 1860, Thomas Madden, an Indian service employee, gained personal title to the Tule River Farm, by using state school warrants. The federal government rented the Tule River Farm and paid Madden $1,000 per year. =Tule River Reservation= In 1864, the Tule River Farm became the Tule River Reservation, one of five Indian reservations authorized by Congress. When the United States defeated the Native Americans in the Owens Valley Indian War of 1863, they were removed to the reservation, whose population nearly doubled. In 1864, the population consisted of 450 Tule River Indians and 350 Owens River Indians who were relocated there from Fort Tejon. The settlers around the growing town of Porterville began to demand removal of the Tule River Farm to a more distant location. Indian agents clamored to provide the Indians with a more permanent home. Some also argued the need to separate the Indians from unscrupulous individuals who entered the reservation to entice the Indians to buy cheap liquor. As a result, the Tule River Indian Reservation was relocated; in 1873 it was established by Presidential Executive Order of Ulysses S. Grant as a homeland for Tule River, Kings River, Owens River, Monache Cajon and other scattered bands of Indians. While the Tule River Indian Tribe includes Mono and T√ºbatulabal members, the majority of the tribe are Yokut. Traditionally, 60 Yokut tribes lived in south central California to the east of Porterville. By the end of the 19th century, their population was reduced by 75% due to warfare and high fatalities from European diseases. The surviving Yokut banded together on the Tule River Reservation, including the Yowlumne, Wukchumni bands of Yokut.

Beginning with the reign of Soomar, the dynasty ruled Sindh, in the northwest part of the Indian subcontinent from 1026 to 1356, and re-established local rule over Sindh after a period of several centuries of Arab rule. History  In 711 CE, Muhammad Bin Qasim extended Umayyad rule to Sindh, making it the easternmost province of the Umayyad empire based in Damascus. Under Umayyad rule, the Arab Habbari dynasty was established as a vassal state of the Umayyads, before ruling semi independently between the 9th and 11th centuries from their capital at Mansura. The Umayyad Caliphate was overthrown by the Abbasids of Baghdad in 750, and the Habbari state continued to rule mostly independently, despite nominal recognition from the Abbasids. The Arab Habbari state was then invaded in 1010 by Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, who believed the Abbasids of to be the rightful caliphs and sought to extinguish any remnants of Umayyad influence in Sindh by sacking Mansura. Ghaznavi was unable to hold Sindh following his sacking of Mansura. In place of him, the local Soomro tribe established the Soomra Dynasty, and began to govern Sindh as a vassal state of the Abbasid Caliphate. Soomro historians regarded their first sultan to be Khafif, although modern research suggests that Khafif was the last Habbari sultan, rather than the first Soomra sultan. Some members of the Soomro caste were one of the first in Sindh to convert from Hinduism to Islam, and had become wealthy at Mansura. They were most likely indigenous Sindhis of the Rajput caste, with some intermarrying with Arabs during Umayyad rule. It is claimed that Soomra belong to the Paramara subcaste, but there is no definite proof of this. Despite conversion to Islam, they continued to maintain several Hindu customs and traditions. Under the rule of the second Soomra sultan, Soomra rule was extended northward until Multan and Uch. During the early 11th century, an Ismaili missionary from the Fatimid Caliphate named Abdullah visited Sindh to spread Isma'ilism, resulting the Sindh, Multan, and Uch becoming centers of Ismaili Shi'ism. Around the same time, large numbers of Sunni Sufi missionaries from Persia and Central Asia entered Sindh, and would eventually lead to large numbers of Sindhis converting to Islam. Both the Shia and Sunni traditions peacefully coexisted in Sindh. In the late 1000s-early 1100s, Soomra control was extended southwards to the regions of Kutch and Kathiawar in the modern-day Indian state of Gujarat under the rule of Sanghar, and later under his son Khafif-ll. Following his death, Sanghar's wife Hamoon attempted to usurp the Soomra throne for herself, though her efforts were quickly crushed by Soomra nobles. In the late 1100s, Muhammad Ghori invaded Sindh, leading to struggles over Kutch with the neighboring Samma dynasty. At the end of the 12th century, the Khizzur Khan Baloch ruled in the Sindh, and he was at enmity with the Rajputs of Bhati. Khizzur Khan Baloch successfully expanded the northern part of the Sindh border, but was killed in his fourth campaign. In the 1220s, Jalaluddin Mingburnu of Khwarezm sacked Sindh, and briefly occupied the Soomra port of Debal. The Soomra king Shimuddin Chamisar submitted to Iltutmish, the Sultan of Delhi, and was allowed to continue on as a vassal. The Soomros ruled as Abbasid vassals until the Siege of Baghdad (1258), after which they began to rule independently. Soomro rule over Sindh was weakened in the 1330s as the River Indus shifted course, disturbing Sindh's economy. The Soomra dynasty's rule over Sindh largely ended when the last Soomra king was defeated by Alauddin Khalji, the second king of the Khalji dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. They continued to rule pockets of territory in the Thar desert around Umerkot until the mid 1400s.

Architecture The palace we see today was created from two buildings separated by the alley known as Do Rode (Due Ruote), probably in 1566, following upon a request by Vincenzo Pojana to the town of Vicenza in 1561. The attribution to Palladio is founded neither on documentary evidence nor on autograph drawings, but rather on the evidence of the architectural quality of the articulation of the piano nobile, with its order which embraces two whole floors, not to mention the design of various details, like the very elegant and fleshy Composite capitals and the entablature. However, elements such as the pilasters devoid of entasis (that is, the characteristic swelling which culminates at a third of the shaft‚Äôs height) conform so little with Palladio‚Äôs vocabulary in the 1560s, that one may hypothesize that the design of the left-hand portion of the palace was the product of a youthful project by Palladio, only later extended to include the neighbouring building during the 1560s, when Pojana decided to enlarge his own residence. This would also explain the differences in the configuration of the basement zone between the two halves of the building.

The Doamna Stanca National College is one of the only four national colleges located in Satu Mare alongside Mihai Eminescu, Ioan Slavici and K√∂lcsey Ferenc. The Romanian writer Ioan Slavici gave his baccalaureate at this college. History After 1804, with the establishment of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Satu Mare, the Catholic gymnasium was reopened. The institution functioned in a rented space from the former Jesuit college that was damaged. In the year 1814 the construction plans for a new gymnasium were approved and the costs of the construction were supported by the Roman Catholic Bishopric. The city provided land for the construction and placement of the structure for only 5,000 Hungarian forints. The teaching language in the Catholic secondary school was Latin. Since 1819 there have been efforts to teach the Hungarian language as an object of study. From 1833 grammar, arithmetic and religion, starting with the third class were taught in the Hungarian language. Between 1843 and 1844 the main language was Hungarian, but Latin continued to be an important teaching language. The German language was introduced in 1855, as an object of study in all secondary classes. From the fifth grade many educational courses were taught in German; even Latin and Greek were taught by German textbooks. The Romanian population attend the elementary schools confessional in English, but there were secondary studies in Latin and Hungarian.

The first (age unknown, but in existence by 1418) was built of stone, but later demolished.\\"Guide to St Gertrude's Church\\", privately published by the church. From 1589 to 1591 it was rebuilt. It was again destroyed in 1605 by the Swedish army laying siege to Riga in that year. The rebuilt church was not damaged in the Russian siege of Riga (1656), although its bells and organ were stolen and taken to Russia. In 1700 the church was again destroyed, as part of the fighting of the Great Northern War. From 1743 to 1744 the church was rebuilt, in wood. From 1753 to 1754 the church was again rebuilt, in order to enlarge it, and it was again furnished with bells and an organ. Further expansion led to a rebuilding from 1778 to 1779, and a shift of location back to the exact site of the original stone church. Application was made to build in stone, but was refused by the city council (stone structures were permitted only inside the city walls), so another wooden church was built. This building was destroyed in the French invasion of 1812. The church was rebuilt from 1814 to 1817. Finally from 1866 to 1869 the present stone and brick church was constructed to replace the wooden building.Consecrated 1869; see, for example, this reference. Second St Gertrude's church By the start of the twentieth century St Gertrude's recorded more than 30,000 church members, meeting as three distinct congregations. A German congregation and a Latvian congregation alternated their services between Sunday morning and Sunday afternoons, and a second Latvian congregation worshipped on Sunday evenings. From 1903 to 1906 a second church was built, now known as St. Gertrude New Church, and this became the centre of the Latvian congregations, leaving Old St Gertrude's as the German- speaking church for Riga.

The hardcover edition was released March 9, 2010. Other editions were released on other dates. Plot This book is about a series of exploits by the Corporation, headquartered in The Oregon, a ship that from the outside looks as if it is ready for the scrapyard. In reality this is a ruse, as the ship is as high tech as can be. The Corporation is hired to hunt for and recover the plutonium energy source from a NASA satellite that went down in the jungles in Argentina. What the members of the Corporation find leads them to Antarctica, where they try to foil a multinational plot around a converted scientific station that is actually a vast mining operation that has a large military base built to protect it. Along the way, just like in a Dirk Pitt Adventure, there is a search for mythical Chinese Admiral's Chinese treasure ship called the \\"Silent Sea\\". That ship had to be scuttled along with its crew due to a prion disease, caught by the crew when they traded for meat from the native cannibals. The Corporation is forced to move the ship to deeper waters, since the Chinese, in Cooperation with the Argentines, are using the presence of the ship to claim the Antarctic Peninsula as Chinese territory. The 15th Century admiral is one Tsai Song. Although he is said to be inspired by the travels of the real Chinese Fleet Admiral Zheng He. It is clear from the time line, that he's based on Zheng. However unlike Zheng's south Asia and Middle Eastern voyages, Song had traveled to the Pacific coasts of the American continents and to Antarctica.

The school moved to its current semi-rural setting soon after, in the 1960s it became fully co-educational. A sixth form building was also constructed as the school expanded, its black and white design in keeping with the aesthetic of the older main building, Drywood Hall. Present day In the 1990s the school added new modern buildings and later, in the mid-2000s, added modern sporting facilities such as an all-weather pitch and state of the art indoor sports hall. This new building, which houses a modern Drama studio as well, was opened in 2006 by the Northern Ireland international footballer, David Healy.

Geography The hamlet is located about 15 km (9 mi) south of the Tarvis town centre, in the valley of the Rio del Lago (Seebachtal) between the Montasio and Mangart massifs of the Julian Alps. The parallel road runs further up to the picturesque Lago del Predil and the Sella Nevea mountain pass. An eastern branch-off leads to Predil Pass at the border with Slovenia. A long tunnel under the pass, built in 1905 and originally used for water drainage and later for transport of miners and political refugees escaping from Communist Yugoslavia, connects it with Log pod Mangartom. History Saint Anne Church The lead and zinc mining community was first mentioned in a 1320 deed issued by the Habsburg duke Frederick the Fair, at the time when the surrounding estates belonged to the Carinthian possessions held by the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg. The bishops also gained control over the trade route across the Nevea mountain pass leading to the city of Cividale del Friuli, the importance of which however diminished, after the Friulian lands in the south had been conquered by the Republic of Venice by 1420. Bamberg finally sold its remote Carinthian estates to Empress Maria Theresa in 1759, who incorporated it into the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy. With the Duchy of Carinthia, Cave del Predil until World War I was part of Austria-Hungary, and by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain came under control of the Kingdom of Italy. A local museum covers the military history of the Alpine campaigns from the Napoleonic Wars to World War II. Under Italian control the mines, temporarily managed by Bernardino Nogara, operated until 1991; since then, the population has sharply decreased.

Lord, a Peruvian citizen of Swiss and German descent, was born in Germany, grew up in Hamburg and studied in Zurich, Berlin and Hamburg, receiving his first degree at the University of Hamburg in 1942. He was involved in the Swing Kids subculture, persecuted by Nazi authorities. For his poorly disguised anti-Nazi sentiments and for his contacts with a British Secret Service agent, Lord was arrested in 1943 and interned at Neuengamme concentration camp, a \\"correctional\\" institution set up according to Robert Ritter' theory of race hygiene.Kater 2003, pp. 159-160 In April 1945, as the Allies invaded Hamburg, Dr. Lord and thousands of other prisoners were herded by the Nazis onto several cruise ships (including the former luxury liner Cap Arcona), sailed a few kilometers off the coast of Hamburg into a British- declared free fire zone, and were abandoned by their German guards. RAF bombers sank all the vessels. Lord was apparently on one of the smaller ships. According to cited 1961 articles in Canadian Medical Association Journal etc., \\"he was one of 28 survivors out of 800 inmates of the ship\\". He and the other few survivors leaped overboard before the bombers struck, and swam several miles to shore. Thousands of others were either killed by the bombing or drowned. Lord returned to Hamburg and resided there until 1954, completing his specialist degrees in surgery and urology, and an internship at professor Degkwitz' clinic for the children.Scaruppe, p. 109 He was credited with reestablishment of the Marburger Bund and reintroducing American popular music to post-war Hamburg scene.Kater 2006, p. 51 In 1954 Lord emigrated to the United States. In 1957, after three years of residency at Bridgeport, Connecticut Hospital, he obtained a U.S. professional license and opened a surgical practice in Barnesville, Ohio. He was a member of American Medical Association, fellow of International College of Surgeons and member of the German Urological Society. In December 1960 Lord was elected Secretary-General of the World Medical Association following the retirement of its founder Louis H. Bauer. However, on February 3, 1961 he collapsed at the AMA convention in Chicago and died on the following morning.

In its first 48 hours, the video accumulated more than 3.5 million views. The original upload of the video was the third most popular video on YouTube in 2009, and as of September 2020 had been viewed over 100 million times. Time magazine ranked the video at number fifteen on its list of the fifty greatest YouTube videos. Synopsis The video begins with ushers closing the church doors with everything appearing normal, getting ready for the start of a wedding. \\"Forever\\" by Chris Brown then begins to play. To the surprise of the audience, the ushers, groomsmen and bridesmaids then progressively dance down the aisle, culminating in the groom, Kevin Heinz, tumbling through the group. Ultimately, Jill Peterson dances down the aisle, eventually met by her husband-to-be. According to Peterson, \\"[they practiced for] an hour and a half\\" the Thursday before the ceremony. The wedding occurred on June 20, 2009, at Christ Lutheran Church, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The video was posted on YouTube a month after the wedding at the request of the bride's father who wanted to share it with relatives who weren't there. Tommy Alsop recorded the video. Outcome On July 26, 2009, sales of Chris Brown's 2008 song \\"Forever\\" reached number 4 on iTunes and number 3 on Amazon.com as a result of the post. Due to the controversy regarding Chris Brown and Rihanna, the married couple set up a charitable contribution effort on their website for donating funds to the Sheila Wellstone Institute, an organization whose efforts are to end domestic violence. Two months after the appearance of the video, donations had reached $16,000. Parodies and media Peterson told Good Morning America, \\"I grew up dancing and I danced in college. It was something I always wanted to do. I wanted to dance in on the wedding. And Kevin jumped in on board. \\" The couple appeared on The Today Show on July 25, 2009, to talk about the video. The entire wedding party re-created the wedding entrance dance on stage live the next day. In Australia, the remaining contestants plus guests recreated the wedding dance on Dancing with the Stars. The wedding dance was recreated in the \\"Niagara\\" episode of U.S. TV series The Office. All main characters, except the bride and groom themselves, participated in the dance down the aisle.

Retrieved 2012-02-06. Summary Set around trials at the Old Bailey in Georgian London against a backdrop of corruption and social injustice, Garrow's Law is a legal drama inspired by the life of pioneering barrister William Garrow. The series, co-created by Tony Marchant, is based on real legal cases from the late 18th century, as recorded in the Old Bailey Proceedings. Andrew Buchan as Garrow leads a cast including Alun Armstrong and Lyndsey Marshal. From rape and murder to high treason and corruption, each episode begins with the investigation of a real crime sourced from the published accounts of Old Bailey trials, available in a fully searchable edition online.The Old Bailey Online, 1674-1913 In an age when few of the accused could afford defence counsel, the youthful Garrow and his associate John Southouse (pronounced soot-house), a solicitor, work to uncover the truth or fight for justice, championing the underdog and pioneering the rigorous cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that paved the way for the modern legal system. A gifted maverick, at times arrogant and with a burning sense of destiny, Garrow is driven to change the nature of the trial, thereby creating powerful enemies both in the corrupt underworld and among the political elite. A major subplot running through the series concerns Garrow's relationship with Lady Sarah Hill, an aristocratic figure with an interest in justice and the law. This almost cost Garrow his life in episode three when Garrow challenges Silvester, his main courtroom rival, to a duel when Silvester insinuates that Garrow and Lady Sarah's relationship has become intimate and then refuses to withdraw the allegation. Lady Sarah's husband is Sir Arthur Hill, an important politician and member of the government. The storyline continues when Sir Arthur accuses his wife of adultery with Garrow and refuses Lady Sarah her son by claiming him as his property. The subplot concludes in the last episode of series three. As well as William Garrow, the series also includes other non-fictional characters, most notably Sir Francis Buller, a controversial judge of the age, and barrister John Silvester.May, Allyson N. The Bar & the Old Bailey, 1750-1850 The University of North Carolina Press (2003) pg 40 Google Books However, the series is not a biographical documentary, and Garrow was not actually involved in all of the cases depicted. According to Mark Pallis, the story editor of Garrow's Law, the show \\"aims to give viewers a real sense of what life was like in legal London towards the end of the 18th century; to give people a chance to experience the big legal landmarks and the cases that caused a stir at the time.\\" The rolling subplot involving Garrow's relationship with Lady Sarah Hill is based on his real relationship with Sarah Dore, who had previously had a child with Sir Arthur Hill, Bt., Viscount Fairford, but departs significantly from the facts, as she was never married to Hill.Garrow Society web-site .

Kolhapuri Chappals or Kolhapuri s as they are commonly referred to are a style of open-toed, T-strap sandal. In July 2019 Kolhapuri chappals got a geographical indication tag from the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trade Marks. There is a wrong perception that only artisans from Maharashtra are involved in making these chappals. But many artisans from Karnataka are also involved in making Kolhapuri chappals for centuries. Districts such as Bagalkot, Belagavi, Dharwad and Bijapur district of Karnataka as well as Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur districts of Maharashtra will only be able to carry the tag of \\"Kolhapuri chappal\\". History The origin of Kolhapuri Chappals dates back to 12th century when the King Bijjala and his prime minister Basavanna encouraged Kolhapuri Chappal production so as to uplift the cobbler community. According to historic records, Kolhapuris were first worn as early as the 13th century. Previously known as Kapashi, Paytaan, Kachkadi, Bakkalnali, and Pukri, the name indicated the village where they were made. =Origin claims= There is a controversy behind the origin of Kolhapuris. Karnataka leather industry board claims these were originated from Kapsi village in Karnataka. It is said that chappals were made in Kapsi village and were sold in front Mahalakshmi Temple, Kolhapur and that's the reason they have acquired such name and some claim these chappals originated from Kolhapur. Production process It can take up to six weeks to make a pair of Kolhapuris.http://www.chappals.co.uk/kolhapuri/ Originally made from buffalo- hide and thread, they weighed as much as 2.01 kilos because of the thickness of the sole, which made them durable despite the extreme heat and mountainous terrain found in the state of Maharashtra. For making Kolhapuri Chappal various operations are done step by step:- * Skiving * Pattern making and cutting * Attachment of upper and bottom heels. * Stitching * Finishing * Punching and Trimming * Decoration and Polishing * Assembling  Design and durability  The designs have moved from the ethnic to ones with more utilitarian value and materials from primal hard materials to softer and more comfortable to wear materials. The artisans themselves designed ethnic patterns and sold, but today the traders and businessmen with demand for cheap products drive the requirement of minimalist designs. Kolhapuri chappals are known to last a lifetime if maintained well and not used in rainy seasons. Kolhapuri foot wear in Hyderabad In the seventies, with the Hippie movement Kolhapuri chappals became a very popular footwear in the United States.

It was considered the most important of the Maratha principalities with the others being Baroda State, Gwalior State and Indore State. Its rulers, of the Bhonsle dynasty, were entitled to a 19-gun salute ‚Äì thus Kolhapur was also known as a 19-gun state. The state flag was a swallow-tailed saffron pennant.Gazetteer, p. 380  History  Shahu of Kolhapur (r. 1894 ‚Äì 1922) New Palace, Kolhapur Maharani Tarabai. Kolhapur State, together with its jagirs or feudatory vassal estates (including Ichalkaranji), covered an area of 3,165 square miles (8,200 km¬≤). According to the 1901 census, the state population was 910,011, of which 54,373 resided in Kolhapur Town. In 1901, the state enjoyed an estimated revenue of ¬£300,000. The Maharajas of Kolhapur have a common ancestry with the Bhonsle dynasty of Satara, being direct descendants of the Maratha King Shivaji. The states of Satara and Kolhapur came into being in 1707, because of the succession dispute over the Maratha kingship. Shahuji, the heir apparent to the Maratha kingdom, captured by the Mughals at the age of nine, remained their prisoner at the death of his father Sambhaji, the elder son of Shivaji Maharaj the founder of the Maratha Empire, in 1689. The Dowager Maharani Tarabai (a widow of Rajaram I) proclaimed her son Shivaji II, as Chhatrapati under her regency. The Mughals released Shahu under certain conditions in 1707, and he returned to claim his inheritance. He defeated the regent at the Battle of Khed and established himself at Satara, forcing her to retire with her son to Kolhapur. By 1710 two separate principalities had become an established fact. Shivaji II and Tarabai were soon deposed by the other widow of Rajaram, Rajasbai. She installed her own son, Sambhaji II as the new ruler of Kolhapur. Sambhaji II signed the Treaty of Warana in 1731 with his cousin Shahuji to formalize the two separate seats of Bhonsle family. The British sent expeditions against Kolhapur in 1765 and 1792; Kolhapur entered into treaty relations with the British, after the collapse of the Maratha confederacy in 1812. In the early years of the 19th century the British invaded again, and appointed a political officer to temporarily manage the state.Manohar Malgonkar, Chhatrapatis of Kolhapur, Pub. Popular Prakashan, 1971. A Brahmin regent called Daji Krishna Pandit was installed by the British to govern the state in 1843 at a time when the natural heir to the throne was underage. He took direction from a political agent of the East India Company and among their actions were reforms to the tax of land. These reforms caused much resentment and, despite Kolhapur having refrained from involvement in the previous Anglo-Maratha Wars, a revolt against the British began in 1844. The rebellion began with soldiers locking themselves into hill-forts such as those as Panhala and Vishalgad, and then spread to Kolhapur itself. Both the regent and the political agent were captured by the militia forces led by Babaji Ahirekar. The last ruler of Kolhapur was Maharaja Shahaji II. After Indian independence in 1947, Kolhapur acceded to the Dominion of India on 14 August 1947 and merged into Bombay State on 1 March 1949. In 1960 Bombay state was divided by languages into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat. The boundaries of former Kolhapur state correspond very closely with those of modern-day Kolhapur district in Maharashtra state.

The estate was located on the slope of the Odenwald in Darmstadt-Eberstadt. The authorities in the state of Hesse then approved the establishment of a mission school.History. Marienhoehe College. Retrieved 2009-07-25 In 1925, a new building for the school workshops was built. Over the years, the number of workshops grew to nine: locksmith, carpentry, printing, upholstery, mattress manufacturing, knitting and others. Many students earned money from these workshops, with which they used to pay their tuition fees. Also, the number of teaching departments expanded. There was a seminary, a business school, a housekeeping school, preschool and nursing courses for educators and kindergarten teachers. In the 1927‚Äì28 school year, the school expanded to include a six-year course of preparation for higher education - today's high school equivalent. The students were prepared for graduation, at Marienh√∂he, and entered into tertiary education in the Darmstadt region. The range of educational opportunities and the reputation of the seminary brought more students and pupils to the school each year. In the academic year 1928‚Äì29, enrolment peaked at 227 before the Second World War began. =War Years= In 1933, the Secret State Police closed the school. Books and money were seized and the classrooms, offices and printing plant was sealed. Students had to go home immediately. After seven weeks, the school ban was lifted. In 1934, the school ended its seminary course, and in 1936 it also ended its general course for higher education. Meanwhile, the number of pupils enrolled fell dramatically. On 1 April 1939, on a recommendation of the state's education department, the school decided to close as the small school roll could not justify its continued operation. Two years later, the site was still owned by the school and one of the school's businesses ‚Äì mattress manufacturing ‚Äì was still in operation. In 1941, Marienh√∂he was seized because of a military law by the military district command in Wiesbaden XII. Units of the armed forces moved into the houses and the site received a military face. Solid bunkers and a series of wooden barracks were built. After the war, the occupying Allies used the site as a camp for displaced people. In the summer of 1948, the school was no longer in the control of the Allied forces. The International Refugee Organization began clearing land and buildings. It became a neglected area with dirty smog covered buildings for many years. The main house from 1911, in 1957 In August 1948, 25 future students came together. Most were able to do handwork. Immediately, reconstruction, renovation and cleaning work began. In October 1948, the Marienh√∂he school was ceremonially reopened after the new education authority gave their approval. The school began with the former seminary courses, housekeeping and nursing preschool. The workshops were later reopened. In the spring of 1949, the \\"old school house\\" was thoroughly overhauled. At the beginning of 1949‚Äì50 school year, the Hesse state government approved the operation of the school despite Marienh√∂he only having one class of 7 students. On top of that, construction of a new gymnasium began. In December 1949, the foundations for the new classroom buildings were laid. =Post-War & Beyond= In the school year of 1950/51, the two initial classes which were originally held in the gym relocated to the new buildings. The school was reestablished in 1950. The enrolment also grew from 60 students in 1949 to 160 students in 1952. One day in 1952/53, a fire was started in the dormitory (located on the grounds of the seminary). Nearly all the occupants were absent when the fire broke out. The cause of the fire was unknown but many students lost all their belongings. The seminary students were temporarily moved into the \\"old school house\\". The girls lived in the upper floors of the main house. In 1953/54, on the location where the block had been, a three-storey stable building was erected as the \\"new students home\\". In the year 1954/55, a new teacher's house was built next to the \\"old school house\\". In the spring of 1955, the first matriculation examination was held at the school. Three girls and thirteen boys took part. They received good marks which aided in giving the school a good name. The successful results from the first examination and the full class numbers lead to public recognition of the grammar school in Hesse. In the school year of 1956/57, the school received state recognition by the Federal Republic. In the year of 1959/60, a new division of mathematical science, and another division were introduced. Students at Year 11 were able to choose between the two.

History The Signal Corps, at the beginning of World War II needed a light telephone repair truck, and contracted initially with GMC- Chevrolet, and later with Dodge / Fargo, for truck chassis to mount a standard American Telephone & Telegraph tool box bed. The original bed was styled after the Streamline Moderne motif of the 1930s. The second style bed, the K-50B, was a more utilitairian square box, that mounted the ladder on the top rather than on the side. It was often used in conjunction with the K-38 trailer.

The railway terminated near, but did not connect with, the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) in Oreana due to the Nevada Short Line being gauge and the SP being a standard gauge mainline. The railway intended to eventually transition to standard gauge, but this never happened. The railroad started in 1913 as a sole proprietorship and was incorporated on April 24, 1914. The line only operated for four years. In June 1918, the line was damaged by flooding and the line was abandoned on December 31, 1920. Terrain and Route The railway operated from Oreana (Nenzel) which was located along the east bank of the Humboldt River at an elevation of above sea level. The railroad continued east through the desert where it had to cross the western edge of the Humboldt Range near Limerick Canyon. The railway had to climb to an altitude of at Rochester. The steep terrain the necessitated the need for a switchback and a 6% grade. Locomotives The Nevada Short Line had two locomotives. Nevada Short Line No. 1 - Baldwin-built (Mogul Type) built in 1879 is on static display with a few cars and rests above all other trains on an elevated track at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento. The last time the locomotive was run was in 1939-40 for the Golden Gate International Exposition on daily re-enactments of the 1869 Golden Spike ceremony. The locomotive was originally built for the Hobart Mills Company and was sold to the Nevada Short Line in August 1913. The second engine \\"Francis,\\" was a 2-truck Heisler locomotive built in 1899 for the Borate and Daggett Railroad and was acquired by the NSL in 1916. It was sold to the Terry Lumber Company at Round Mountain, California.

He then went with pitcher Charlie Getzien to play for the ball club at Grand Rapids, Michigan. Gastfield was a catcher for Grand Rapids in the first half of the 1884 season. In August 1884, Gastfield and Getzien joined the Detroit Wolverines, both players making their debut on August 13, 1884.(reporting that the Grand Rapids team had practically disbanded as five players, Gastfield, Getzien, Kearns, Cox and Jones were released; the team had a 48-15 record at the time) Gastfield appeared in 23 games for the 1884 Wolverines, compiling a .073 batting average with 34 strikeouts in 84 at bats.

As a thrower and base-runner he has few, if any, superiors. He is a hard worker and plays ball first, last and all the time. He is considered quite an acquisition to the club, especially as he is very popular and possesses considerable drawing power both at home and abroad.\\" He also played for the ball club in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1888.(Gastfield playing catcher for Omaha) Later years Gastfield died in December 1899 at the home of his father, Charles Gastfield, at 635 North Campbell Avenue in Chicago.

Frost , (born 29 March 1943) is an Australian academic based at La Trobe University. A major theme of his research has involved the European exploration of the Pacific Ocean over the second half of the eighteenth century.

These include Botany Bay Mirages: Illusions of Australia's Convict Beginnings, Botany Bay: The Real Story, The First Fleet: The Real Story, and Mutiny, Mayhem, Mythology: Bounty's Enigmatic Voyage. Frost's arguments radically challenge those expressed by prominent historians Manning Clark and Robert Hughes. Academic career Alan Frost completed an MA at the University of Queensland in 1966. Following this, he went to the University of Rochester in New York, where he completed an MA (1968) and a PhD (1969). He took up his appointment in the English Department at La Trobe University in 1970, moving full-time into the History Department in 1975.

Over the course of his work at the Technion he was the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences and established the separate Department of Mathematics. Historian Benzion Netanyahu was his brother and Benjamin Netanyahu, current Prime Minister of Israel was his nephew. Biography Netanyahu was born in Warsaw, Poland, to the writer and Zionist activist Nathan Mileikowsky. He was the third of nine children. In 1920 the family made aliyah to the Land of Israel. The family eventually settled in Jerusalem and adopted Hebrew name Netanyahu. Netanyahu went to the Reali School in Haifa, from which he graduated in 1930. He later returned to Reali in 1935 to teach mathematics there. He studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, from which he received his BS, MA and PhD (1942). His advisors were Michael Fekete and Binyamin Amir√†. After the graduation he joined the British Army as a volunteer, serving in Egypt and then in Italy as an officer in a unit of the Royal Engineering Corps. He specialized in preparation of maps, which he continued to do during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. After he was demobilized in 1946, he became a lecturer at the Technion. He rose to a professor in 1958, and later became the head of the Mathematics Section, then as Dean of the Faculty of Sciences. His administrative efforts also played an important role towards establishment of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. He had long term visits at Stanford University (1953‚Äì54), NYU (1961), the University of New Mexico (1969), the University of Maryland, College Park (1973), and ETH Z√ºrich (1979). In 1980, Netanyahu retired from the Technion and moved to Jerusalem, where he died of cancer in 1986. Throughout his long career, Netanyahu collaborated with Paul Erd≈ës, Charles Loewner and other leading mathematicians, continuing and expanding the analytical traditions at the Technion. =Personal life= In 1949 Netanyahu married Shoshana Shenburg, his former student at the Reali, who later became the second female justice at the Israel Supreme Court. They had two children: Nathan (b. 1951), a professor of computer science at Bar-Ilan University, and Dan (b. 1954), an information systems auditor. Elisha Netanyahu Memorial Lectures The Elisha Netanyahu Memorial Lecture Series was established by the Netanyahu family and the Technion to honor the memory in 1987 with the first lecture by Paul Erd≈ës. In other years, the speakers included Lars Ahlfors, Robert Aumann, Lipman Bers, Enrico Bombieri, Charles Fefferman, Samuel Karlin, David Kazhdan, Louis Nirenberg, Terence Tao, Wendelin Werner, and Don Zagier.

The Nashville Xpress Minor League Baseball team played two seasons in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1993 to 1994 as the Double-A affiliate of the Minnesota Twins. In those seasons, a total of 60 players competed in at least one game for the Xpress. The 1993 roster included a total of 35 players, while 38 played for the team in 1994. There were 13 players who were members of the team in both seasons. Of the 60 all-time Xpress players, 22 also played in at least one game for a Major League Baseball (MLB) team during their careers. After the 1992 baseball season, Charlotte, North Carolina, home of the Double-A Southern League's Charlotte Knights, acquired a Triple-A expansion team in the International League, leaving the Southern League franchise in need of a new home. Larry Schmittou, president of the Triple-A Nashville Sounds, offered Herschel Greer Stadium as a temporary home for the displaced team until owner George Shinn could find a permanent home for his club. Upon the league's approval, the franchise relocated to Nashville and became the Nashville Xpress. In order to accommodate two teams at Greer, the Xpress' games were scheduled for during the Sounds' road trips. As no other solution could be reached for 1994, Schmittou allowed the franchise to remain at Greer for a second season. Meanwhile, in October 1993, Dennis Bastien purchased the Xpress with the intention of moving the club to Lexington, Kentucky, for the 1995 season, but those plans fell through when he was unable to broker a financial deal with the city to build a ballpark. Bastien later arrived at terms to relocate to Springfield, Missouri, in 1997. The Xpress left Nashville after the 1994 campaign to play on an interim basis in Wilmington, North Carolina, where they were known as the Port City Roosters in 1995 and 1996. The team, however, never made it to Springfield after the city was unable to secure federal funding for a ballpark. The forlorn franchise was subsequently sold and placed in Mobile, Alabama, as the Mobile BayBears in 1997.

He is last played for Stavanger Oilers of the Norwegian GET-ligaen. Playing career Romano was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the sixth round (178th overall pick) of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to the draft, Romano graduated from St. Anthony's High School on Long Island, and played for the New York Bobcats of the Atlantic Junior Hockey League, scoring 50 goals in the 2005‚Äì06 season. After being drafted, he spent the following year playing for Cornell University, where he led the team's rookies with a total of nine goals and ten assists. Romano then went on to play for the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League during the 2007‚Äì08 season, citing the switch in leagues due to his limited number of games played in Cornell. Romano didn't play well during this season, partially due to off- season shoulder surgery. Romano played for the Peterborough Petes in the following season, where he scored 36 goals in 65 games. He was the team's leading scorer for the season. On June 30, 2009, Romano was traded from the New Jersey Devils to the New York Islanders in exchange for Ben Walter and a conditional 2012 draft pick. After being traded, Romano attended the Islanders' \\"mini-camp,\\" where many of the younger Islanders players began training together. Regarding joining the Islanders, Romano said \\"I‚Äôve put in a lot of time through the years. I‚Äôve worked hard all my life, and to possibly be one phone call away from playing with them is a great feeling. I‚Äôm a hometown kid and this is the team I grew up idolizing. Pierre Turgeon was my favorite player, and I remember going to the game when they retired Bryan Trottier‚Äôs number. It‚Äôs just real comforting to be here and be close to home.\\" After beginning the 2009‚Äì10 season with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League, he was assigned to the Utah Grizzlies of the ECHL on December 8, 2009. After three seasons with Sound Tigers, Romano signed a one- year deal with Austrian EBEL side Vienna Capitals. After one season in the EBEL, Romano played two years in the Swedish second-tier HockeyAllsvenskan with V√§ster√•s and Malm√∂ Redhawks. After one year playing in Norway, Romano signed a one-year contract with the Odense Bulldogs of the Danish Metal Ligaen in July 2016.

The penalty for blasphemy may be years of imprisonment as well as a fine. Every Algerian child has an opportunity to learn what blasphemy is because Islam is a compulsory subject in public schools, which are regulated jointly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Religious Affairs.  Constitution and laws  More than ninety-nine percent of Algeria's population is Sunni Muslim. The Constitution of Algeria declares that Islam is the state religion but Article 36 of the Constitution provides for freedom of belief. The Constitution does not provide for Sharia courts in Algeria's court system. Article 35 guarantees freedom of conscience and of opinion. Article 41 says all citizens are entitled to the freedom of expression. Algeria has signed and ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Despite the provisions of the Constitution, Algeria severely restricts what anyone can say or what anyone can do as a religious practice. The penal code forbids anyone from insulting, or inciting hatred against, anyone who belongs to an ethnic or philosophical group or to a religion. Freedom of speech must be exercised with respect for \\"individual dignity, the imperatives of foreign policy, and the national defense.\\" Algeria uses a 1990 law to protect Islam from defamation, to control access to information from outside the country, and to outlaw writing that threatens national unity. In 2001, the government amended some laws to criminalize writing, cartoons, and speech that insult or offend the president, the parliament, the judiciary, the armed forces, or \\"any other authority of public order.\\" Those convicted of giving offense face prison sentences that range from three to twenty-four months and fines of 50,000 to 500,000 dinars. The Ministry of Religious Affairs (MRA) operates to ban publications and broadcasting that might be blasphemous. At the October 2008 Algiers Book Fair, the MRA banned the sale of 1,471 religious titles. Shortly before the book fair, the government banned the printing of author and vocal government critic Mohamed Benchicou's latest book, The Diary of a Free Man. During the 2007 book fair, government officials confiscated and banned a previous book by Benchicou, The Jailhouses of Algiers. Algeria banned the Arab news network Al Jazeera in 2004. Article 144(2) of the Algerian Penal Code states that \\"whoever offends the prophet (peace be upon him) and God's other prophets and messengers or the precepts of Islam (whether by writing, drawing, declaration or any other way), is sentenced to 3-5 years imprisonment and fined 50,000 DZD to 100,000 DZD, or one of these two penalties. Criminal proceedings are initiated by the public authorities.\\" Article 160(1) of the Penal Code states that ‚Äúany damage or desecration of the Holy Book is punishable by 5 to 10 years in prison.\\" The government monitors e-mail and the Internet for material that is offensive to the authorities. Internet service providers can face criminal penalties for the material and the websites they host. Providers are not permitted to give access to material \\"incompatible with morality or public opinion.\\"  Recent history  In 1991, a war began between the Algerian government and several Islamist groups. Fighters on both sides conducted campaigns of torture and murder that were sometimes indiscriminate and sometimes aimed at the intellectual and educated community. The victims included many teachers, students, journalists, writers, artists, musicians, the defenders of human rights, lawyers, civil servants, and foreigners. Hostilities abated after 2006 but a state of emergency remains in effect.  Selected cases  In February 2008, authorities arrested Christian converts Yousef Ourahmane, Rachid Seghir (or Esseghir), and Hamid Ramdani for blasphemy and for uttering threats against a man who allegedly converted from Islam to Christianity to Islam. At the trial, which began on 21 October 2008, the prosecutor asked the court for three years imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 dinars for each man. The court acquitted the men on 29 October because the prosecution did not prove that the men had committed a crime. In 2008, authorities arrested six residents of the town of Biskra for eating and playing cards during the daylight hours of Ramadan. On 5 October 2008, a judge found all six guilty and fined them 120,000 dinars each ($1,770 US). Six days later an appeals court judge overruled the decision on the ground that the original sentence violated the Constitution. In a separate incident, the Algiers appeals court on 18 November reduced the sentence of three years' imprisonment to two months of time served for three men convicted of smoking during Ramadan. Authorities arrested the men on 21 September and detained them for the duration of their trial. In 2007, a court dropped charges of blasphemy against Lotfi Chriet and Houria Khatir and six journalists. Chriet and Khatir were the managers of two television channels. The alleged blasphemy was the broadcast of cartoons which were published originally in 2005 in the Danish magazine Jyllands-Posten. The court ruled that the broadcast's purpose was not to ridicule Muhammad. In September 2007, a court in the city of Biskra sentenced 26-year-old Samia Smets to ten years imprisonment for violating the Quran. On 28 October 2008, a judge of the Criminal Division of the court in Biskra acquitted Smets. The judge found that Smets, while in jail because of a civil matter, had accidentally dropped a copy of the Quran into water during an argument with other prisoners. Those prisoners had accused Smets of tearing up a Quran but the prosecution did not produce a torn Quran.

History The Democratic Party was the principal party in power in the southern United States, before and after the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) and had supported secessionism, slavery and the Confederate States of America. An even greater liability was the accusation repeated by Republicans that most Democrats had been defeatists during the war and supported Copperhead efforts to lose the war. The Republicans, who claimed to have fought and won the war, saving the Union and abolishing slavery, had the advantage. Radical Republicans hostile to the white South took control of Congress in 1866, stripped ex-Confederates of their power in local affairs, and used the Army to support Republican Parties across the South during Reconstruction. Democrats opposed Radical Reconstruction, but were ineffective.Summers (2009) New Departure By 1870, many Democrats had stopped opposing Reconstruction and many Republican policies in an effort to improve the fortunes of their party, in a strategy called the \\"New Departure\\" of the Democratic Party. Democrats began asserting that they were just as loyal to the United States as the Republicans and now supported some civil rights. In the South, Democrats who embraced the \\"New Departure\\" called themselves \\"Redeemers\\". Democrats began pushing for economic modernization and recovery, alleging that the Republican- controlled state governments were inefficient and corrupt. As falling cotton prices further increased economic depression in the South, Democrats attacked the Republicans as creating unwelcome tax burdens and being unable to revive the economy. A prominent example of \\"New Departure\\" success was the election as the Governor of Virginia of William E. Cameron and of ex-Confederate general William Mahone as U.S. Senator from Virginia. Both Cameron and Mahone were leaders of the \\"Readjuster Party\\", which was a coalition of Democrats, Republicans and African Americans who sought the reduction of Virginia's pre- war debt. In Tennessee, \\"Redeemer\\" Democrats supported the Republican governor DeWitt Senter. Georgia Georgia Democrats called their program the New Departure starting in 1872, when they regained full control of the state government. The Party was conservative on issues of race, and vigorously promoted the Henry Grady's New South dream of promoting economic modernization through business, railroads, banking, merchandising, and industry. The New Departure policy made Georgia's reconciliation with the business community in the north easier, and facilitated northern investments in the state. The era ended in 1890, when the Farmers' Alliance captured the Democratic Party.Judson Clements Ward, Jr., \\"The New Departure Democrats of Georgia: An Interpretation,\\" Georgia Historical Quarterly, Fall 1957, Vol. 41 Issue 3, pp 227-236 Ohio On May 18, 1871, Democrats of Montgomery County, Ohio met in convention in Dayton to appoint delegates to the state convention on June 1, 1871. The members of their Committee on Resolutions were Clement Vallandigham, Dr. A. Geiger, David A. Houk, Dr. John Kemp, John A. McMahon, Adam Clay, and George V. Naureth. The New Departure resolution of fifteen points was adopted. The resolution called for abandoning Civil War issues of the Democratic Party \\"thus burying out of sight all that is of the dead past, namely, the right of secession, slavery, inequality before the law, and political inequality; and further, now that reconstruction is complete, and representation within the Union restored to all the States\\" and affirmed states' rights. It \\"opposed to all attempts at centralisation and consolidation of power in the hands of the General Government\\" and advocated \\"to secure universal political rights and equality among both the white and the colored people of the United States\\". The resolution called for \\"payment of the public debt at the earliest practicable moment consistent with moderate taxation\\" and to \\"make the burdens of taxation equal, uniform, and just\\" with \\"adequate reform in the civil service\\". For government finances, \\"a strictly revenue tariff\\" was advocated, along with \\"all taxation ought to be based on wealth instead of population . . . That specie is the basis of all sound currency, and that the policy requires as speedy a return to that basis as is practicable without distress to the debtor-class The resolution stated \\"there is no necessary or irrepressible conflict between labor and capital. The policy on land grants was: \\"we are totally and resolutely opposed to the grant of any more of the public lands . . . holding that these lands ought to be devoted as homesteads to actual settlers, or sold in small quantities to individuals at a price so low as to induce speedy occupation and settlement.\\" It advocated \\"holding still to the good old Democratic doctrine of annexation or acquisition of territory, The \\"Bayonet Bill\\" and the \\"Ku-Klux Bill\\" passed by Congress were opposed on the grounds of \\"intermeddling with the exclusively local concerns of every State. The resolution concluded with a statement \\"that the Radical party of 1871 as now constituted is not the Republican party . . . it deserves the emphatic condemnation of the people.\\"pp. 338-442, Vallandigham, James L. A Life of Clement L. Vallandigham. Baltimore, MD: Turnbull Brothers, 1872. The New Departure policy of Ohio Democrats was endorsed by Salmon P. Chase on May 20, 1871.p. 446, Vallandigham, James L. A Life of Clement L. Vallandigham. Baltimore, MD: Turnbull Brothers, 1872. The resolution may, or may not have been the origins of the New Departure policy of the Democratic Party. Criticism and opposition The \\"New Departure\\" was strongly opposed by large factions of Democrats in the Deep South, who professed loyalty to the Confederate legacy. Republicans attacked the Democrats as being insincere about reform, committed to states' rights at the expense of national unity and to white supremacy at the expense of civil rights.

Fist were one of the original bands that were considered to be part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. History The band first formed in April 1978 as Axe, but only recorded one song (\\"S.S. Giro\\") under that name. The group reformed in late 1979 under the new name of Fist, soon signing with Neat Records and releasing their first single, \\"Name, Rank and Serial Number\\" in April 1980. This single did well with heavy radio rotation and good sales. The single was praised in the pages of Sounds, and bigger things were anticipated for the band as they signed with MCA, releasing a second single and preparing a full-length record for the end of the year. Turn the Hell On was released and the band toured with UFO, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Unfortunately, the LP suffered from a poor mix and MCA did not have any real experience of dealing with metal bands and promoted the band poorly. Turn the Hell On inevitably failed to satisfy the label sales wise and Fist were dropped by MCA in early 1981. Apart from a couple of compilation appearances (including the old 1978 Axe recording of \\"S.S. Giro\\" showing up on the Neat compilation Lead Weight), Fist went unheard from for a short time, re-vamping the line-up in July 1981 and issuing their second LP, Back with a Vengeance, on Neat in early 1982. This new line-up included lead vocalist Glenn Coates from Hollow Ground, John Roach from Mythra, bassist Norman Appleby as well as Hill and Irwin. Reviews were favourable for this album, with a few minor quibbles about the band sounding \\"too American\\" due to Glenn Coates smoother vocals. However, due to limited distribution and scarce label funds the album never took off. The band seemed a little restrained also, mainly gigging locally in the North East of England. Fist went through a few more changes from that point until finally and officially disbanding in 1985. Despite failing to sell in \\"significant numbers\\", Fist were singled out for praise by a number of critics for writing catchy choruses and resisting the clich√©d heavy metal lyrics of many other NWOBHM bands, that primarily sang about the occult; \\"You'll Never Get Me Up (In One of Those)\\", for example, is about fear of flying, while \\"Throwing in the Towel\\" is about an ageing boxer unhappy to be back in the ring. \\"Name, Rank and Serial Number\\" in particular is considered an all-time classic by many rock and metal fans. In 2001, original frontman Keith Satchfield formed a new version of Fist which included members of Hollow Ground as well as guest musicians. This lineup released a new album, Storm, in 2005. The music on this album had a much heavier feel than anything Fist had previously released. The album received a mixed reception, with some camps preferring the older more classic sounding material and other camps criticising the \\"synthetic\\" sound of the recordings especially the drums. There was some initial activity with this line-up e.g., a one off show at Headbangers Open Air in Germany, however, due to ill health, the band remained inactive shortly afterwards and again the album failed to make any major impact. In 2013, Fist reformed with original members Harry \\"Hiroshima\\" Hill, Davey Irwin and Norman Appleby from the Back with Vengeance period. Added to this line-up was new frontman Glenn S. Howes, a veteran of the NWOBHM scene after spending time in such luminaries as Blitzkrieg, Tygers of Pan Tang and Avenger. This line-up debuted at the Bro Fest festival in the UK in 2014, headlining the Friday night to much expectation and excitement. The resulting reviews pouring great admiration for the band and the new formation. Fist continue to play live across the world with this line-up and as of 2015 have rumoured to be writing songs for a new album. In 2016, Norman Appleby was replaced by local bassist Steve East. This lineup played a final gig in South Shields on 1 April 2017, supporting Bernie Torme on the first gig of his Dublin Cowboy tour. Steve East and Glenn S Howes had both previously announced they would leave the band after this gig. Fist will continue with Irwin and Hill being joined by former vocalist Glenn Coates and bass player Norman Appleby.

In the history of botany, different people have used all three grammatical genders for the genus Styrax, and reasonable arguments could be made for treating it as neuter, feminine, or masculine, although it has been recommended that masculine gender should be used. Choosing masculine gender could produce the obassis spelling, except that the specific epithet is not a Botanical Latin adjective to be declined in that way, but a vernacular name.

It represented some of the best known 20th-century entertainers in film, television, and music. During its 109-year tenure it came to be regarded as the \\"first great talent agency in show business\\". In April 2009, WMA announced it would merge with the Endeavor Talent Agency to form William Morris Endeavor. William Morris Endeavor was renamed Endeavor in October 2017.  History = Early history = In 1898, William Morris (born Zelman Moses), a German-Jewish immigrant to the US, posted a cross-hatch trademark above an office door in New York City four \\"X's\\", representing a W superimposed on an M and went into business as William Morris, Vaudeville Agent. By the time WMA formally incorporated in New York State on January 31, 1918, Morris' son William Morris Jr. and his assistant Abraham Lastfogel, who started out as an office boy and after becoming a talent agent in his own right, entered into a business partnership with Morris Sr. As silent film grew into widely viewed entertainment, Morris encouraged his clients to experiment in the new medium. Stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Al Jolson, the Marx Brothers, and Mae West were all represented by the company. By 1930, Morris had turned over leadership of the agency to his son and Lastfogel. In 1932, five years after his retirement, William Morris, Sr. died from heart failure. By that time, the Agency had begun the process of relocating from Hollywood and Vine to Canon Drive in Beverly Hills. = 1945 to 2000 = President Gerald Ford (right) meets in the Oval Office with a representative of the William Morris Agency to discuss advertising for his 1976 campaign In December 1949, the William Morris Agency acquired the Berg- Allenberg Agency. The senior agent in the motion picture department during the 1950s was Mike Zimring. By 1965, WMA's Music Department was representing several clients including the Rolling Stones, Sonny & Cher, the Beach Boys, and the Byrds. In 1973, the Agency's newly established Nashville office provided another significant boost to the operations of William Morris, extending the Agency's reach into country music and beyond. In 1976, Nat Lefkowitz was named as co-chairman of the firm (he later hired his nephew, Ted Ashley who would go on to found the Ashley-Famous talent agency). In 1980, Morris Stoller was named chairman. In the early 1980s, WMA built the William Morris Plaza located at 150 El Camino Drive, directly across the street from its main building at 151 El Camino. In 1989, WMA acquired the Jim Halsey Company. In the early 1990s, WMA's Literary Department announced the largest book-to-screen deal ever inked when it sold the television rights for Scarlett, the sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind. In 2000, WMA acquired The Writers Shop, which was owned by Jennifer Rudolph Walsh. = Post-2000 = In 2003, WMA opened an office in Miami Beach, and in 2004 they opened an office in Shanghai. In 2007, the Agency expanded its London music operation, underscoring WMA's continued commitment to the international marketplace. Along with the addition of new personnel, the London office moved into the iconic Centre Point Tower. In 2003, a seismic shift occurred in the agency landscape when WMA's SVP and Theatre topper, George Lane, and fellow agent in charge of foreign rights, Michael Cardonick, left WMA to open Creative Artists Agency's New York City office and Theatrical Department.  2009 merger with Endeavor  On April 27, 2009, WMA and the Endeavor Talent Agency announced that they were merging to form William Morris Endeavor. Endeavor executives Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell were widely recognized as the architects of the deal and ultimately took the roles of WME Co-CEOs. Following the official announcement of the merger, nearly 100 WMA employees and former board members were let go. One of those leaving was Jim Wiatt, who came to WMA in 1999 from International Creative Management, where he was Vice- Chairman, in 1999. He had joined WMA as President and Co-Chief Executive Officer, and had risen to Board Chairman. After the merger, WMA relocated its offices to the Endeavor building at 9601 Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California.  WMA Agent Training Program  The WMA Agent Training Program, often referred to as the \\"mailroom\\", was established in the 1940s and is well known for its roster of successful alumni. Since the 1970s the program has been replicated at other talent agencies and studios, many of which were headed by former mailroom trainees. Once accepted, trainees rotate through different departments, starting with the mailroom, before becoming a full-time assistant or coordinator. WMA's longtime competitor, Creative Artists Agency, was founded in 1975 by Michael Ovitz, Ronald Meyer, William Haber, Michael S. Rosenfeld, and Rowland Perkins, all former WMA agent trainees. David Geffen once called the WMA Agent Training Program \\"The Harvard School of Show Business - only better: no grades, no exams, a small stipend and great placement opportunities.\\" Graduates from the Training Program were perceived at a high level of prestige within the entertainment industry, because of the caliber of notable alums that have graduated from the program. Former Chairman Norman Brokaw became the first mailboy in the Beverly Hills Mailroom at age 15. The Agent Training program still exists today at William Morris Endeavor. It was famously documented in David Rensin's 2003 book, The Mailroom: Hollywood History from the Bottom Up.

The community is built on the grounds of an campus that has a rich history of family ownership which reaches back to the time of the American Revolution. William Hood Dunwoody The community is named for William Hood Dunwoody. It sits on land which his father James Dunwoody bought from his father-in-law, William Hood.Historic Newtown Township, 1681-1983. Township of Newtown TriCentennial Commission, 1984. Alice and Carl Lindborg, Eds. p.81 Both the Hood and Dunwoody families had emigrated from England in the latter part of the 17th century. As a farm boy in the 1840s, William Dunwoody attended school at the Hood Octagonal School which still stands on the property. After his schooling, Dunwoody learned to be a broker and dealer in grain from his uncle and by age 23 he formed the flour firm of Dunwoody & Robertson. In his childhood, Dunwoody had been sickly and, at the age of 28, he took his physician‚Äôs advice by moving to Minnesota where he could remain active in the grain business.Historic Newtown Township, 1681-1983. Township of Newtown TriCentennial Commission, 1984. Alice and Carl Lindborg, Eds., p.193 He joined Washburn-Crosby Co. in Minneapolis, a prominent milling firm that produced the highly successful Gold Medal Flour. With them, Dunwoody pioneered overseas spring wheat sales and became a silent partner. After Dunwoody‚Äôs death, the company changed its commercial name to General Mills. Dunwoody spent the rest of his life in Minnesota, returning to Pennsylvania annually in order to visit his parents and siblings. Although the family farm had been subdivided after his parents‚Äô death, William used a part of his immense wealth to reconsolidate it for the purpose of establishing a charitable home in memory of his parents. Dunwoody died in 1914, leaving a $1 million bequest to build a home in which sick or injured workers could recuperate until able to return to the workforce. In 1924, the Dunwoody Home opened its doors to needy men and operated with a trust fund that continues to this day caring for those in need. By the late 1960s, recuperative care had been transformed by visiting nurses, hospital sponsored outpatient care, and homes with extensive infirmaries. As there was no longer a pressing societal need for the services of the Dunwoody Home, utilization declined and the facilities became outdated. On the other hand, the concept of a non-profit retirement community was evolving as a viable enterprise. The trustees of the Home sought and obtained court permission to establish a retirement village with continuing care.Historic Newtown Township, 1681-1983. Township of Newtown TriCentennial Commission, 1984. Alice and Carl Lindborg, Eds. p.194 The trustees would oversee both the Home and the Village but the two would be separate financially and operationally. Dunwoody Village Retirement Community Thus Dunwoody Village came into being with its first residents arriving in late 1974. This was early in the age of retirement villages as we know them today. As a result, the design of Dunwoody Village embraced some unique construction features seldom seen in subsequent retirement community designs. These include heated hallways connecting all parts of the complex, atria with natural light and growing plants spread throughout the complex, and cinder block walls to isolate noise and prevent the spread of fire. An operating feature quite uncommon within continuing care communities elsewhere was United States postal delivery to each apartment door. The accommodation plan for independent living was ahead of its time. Not only was there a mixture of studio, one bedroom, and two bedroom apartments, there were apartment suites located at ground level. These were termed country houses. Many communities developed at a later time offered villas, but these were free standing structures that involved some degree of exposure to the weather for residents to reach the core facility. Dunwoody Village opened with skilled nursing and personal care facilities. Over the years, some of the notable improvements have been establishment of a long-term nursing pavilion, upgrading all double occupancy nursing rooms to single occupancy, and the means to provide special care for dementia patients. The headwaters of Hunter Run rise on the grounds of Dunwoody Village. A large barn for farm animals built in 1924 to support the Dunwoody Home still stands. Unusual in having a glazed brick silo for fodder storage, this landmark gives a visual link to the historic nature of the property. The Hood Octagonal School building occupies a prominent position on the grounds. Once thought to date back to 1798, thorough research revealed that it was erected in 1842Dunwoody Retrospective, F. Kramer, 2006. http://www.historicnewtownsquare.org/files/Fred_Kramer- Dunwoody_Retrospective.pdf and the schoolhouse was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. An iconic image of the schoolhouse is used as the logo of Dunwoody Village and by the municipality. The Dunwoody Home itself outlived its ability to provide charitable care both financially and structurally. It was closed in 1991 and demolished in May 1992. The few remaining residents were accommodated charitably in Dunwoody Village.

She was a member of a well known Irish musical family, and had a lifelong musical partnership with her older sister, Sarah. She was a paternal aunt of singers Dolores, Se√°n and Matt Keane.The Irish Times Newspaper, 7 July 2009  Early life  Keane grew up with six siblings in a home where music was always present. The whole Keane family sang and played instruments, and frequently played host to other singers and musicians from East Galway and beyond. Keane's mother, May, was an assiduous collector of traditional songs and tunes, and passed on her passion to her children. When, in later years, Dolores, Se√°n and Matt Keane started recording professionally, they were able to draw on a wealth of material from their paternal aunts. In 1939 Keane and her sister Sarah were given accordions, which they would play at celebrations and funerals in the local area. In 1958 the sisters entertained guests at the wedding of local farmer John Corbett to Mary Murphy, who had recently returned to Ireland after spending five years living in New York.  Musical career  In the 1950s and 1960s Rita and Sarah played as part of Keane's C√©il√≠ Band, who performed for audiences of up to 1,000 people at dances in the local town of Tuam. At one stage, Brendan Burke, father of John \\"Turps\\" Burke who later became a member of the Saw Doctors, played with the band. Daily Telegraph obituary of Rita Keane In the late 1960s the broadcaster Ciar√°n Mac Math√∫na made recordings of the Keane sisters, which he broadcast on a series of radio programmes for RT√â. These proved popular with listeners, and resulted in the recording of an album entitled Once I Loved in 1969. Claddagh Records Their only other album, At the Setting of the Sun, would not follow until 1985.At The Setting of the Sun - CD Universe Both albums feature a mixture of sean-n√≥s (traditional unaccompanied Irish language singing) and ballads sung in English, and have subsequently been re-released on CD, indicating a continued interest in, and demand for, the Keane sisters' recorded work.  Later life and death  Keane's passion for music remained with her up until her death. Se√°n Keane recalls the Keane sisters saying, of music, 'Oh God, it keeps us alive!'. Keane reportedly played her accordion until a few days before her death on 28 June 2009, aged 86. RTE obituary  Personal life  Keane did not marry, and lived her whole life in the house of her birth at Caherlistrane with her sister Sarah, who survived her.  Discography  Once I Loved (1969, Claddagh Records) At the Setting of the Sun (1985, Gael-Linn Records)  Recognition and awards  The cultural significance of the Keane family has been recognised both within Ireland and internationally, with their work having been highlighted by broadcast media from as far away as Japan. In 2006, Rita and Sarah Keane were awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by Irish language television channel TG4 for their contribution to traditional music.Irish Music Magazine  References  Irish female singers Irish folk singers Musicians from County Galway 1922 births 2009 deaths 20th-century Irish singers 20th-century Irish women singers 20th-century accordionists Claddagh Records artists ","title":"Rita Keane"},{"id":"23746567","title":"2004 Ottawa Renegades season"},{"id":"23746577","text":"Pyrgophorus spinosus, common name the spiny crownsnail, is a species of very small freshwater snail with a gill and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Hydrobiidae.  Taxonomy  Pyrgophorus spinosus was described by Richard Ellsworth Call and by Henry Augustus Pilsbry in 1886 as Pyrgulopsis spinosus but until C√©sar Marie F√©lix Ancey established the new genus Pyrgophorus in 1888, it was not clear what genus this species belonged to.Pilsbry H. A. 1886. Description of a New Hydrobia, with Notes on Other Rissoidae. Proceeding Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences, volume V., page 34.  Shell description  The shell is minute, imperforate, turreted and unicarinate. The carina is modified into spinous processes on last three whorls. The carina is darker colored than balance of shell. The shell has 5-5¬Ω whorls. The first two whorls are rounded, destitute of spines or carina. The last three whorls are somewhat geniculate, angled at location of carina. The body whorl is large, sometimes with an occasional spine below the carina. The epidermis is light horn in color, nearly white at apex, with microscopic longitudinal revolving striae and shining. The aperture is roundly ovate, slightly longer than broad and rounded anteriorly. The peristome is not continuous. The peristome is sharp, simple, slightly reflected near the columella, suggesting a faint umbilicus. The suture is slightly impressed. The width of the shell is 1.52-2.34 mm. The height of the shell is 3.00-3.86 mm. The operculum is spiral and reddish horn in color.  Distribution  The type locality is Comal Creek, a clear stream at New Braunfels, Texas, on rocky bottoms.  Habitat  In 1886, Pyrgophorus spinosus inhabited its type locality along with numerous specimens of Goniobasis pleuristriata Say, Amnicola (species undetermined), and Bythinella (species undetermined).

About.com's Deb Aoki commends the manga for its \\"vibrant, detailed artwork that takes its inspiration from nature, real people and real places\\" but criticizes the manga for its slow plot which \\"picks up the pace after a few chapters\\". PopCultureShock's Sam Kusek comments on the interactions between the main characters, saying, \\"[Umi, Sora and Ruka] all share something in common, the fact that they are outsiders from the norm. Ruka is not your normal girl. As athletic as she is, her attitude and aggression towards her teammates leave her high and dry for the summer. Consistently throughout the book, people are badmouthing her as she passes them on the street. Umi and Sora are obviously outsiders due to their extreme circumstances, wearing large robes to cover a majority of their skin and having to constantly bathe in water. Sora especially has a frail constitution, spending most of the book in and out of a hospital. All three are young children, and that is shown throughout the book, but they also have a unique sense of maturity that sets them apart not only from other children but most adults.\\" Anime News Network's Carlo Santos commends the manga for its \\"subtle, seamless storytelling and first-class artistry combine to form a fascinating tale of the sea\\" but criticizes it for \\"mundane events and superfluous scenes sometimes slow down the plot\\". ICv2's Steve Bennett commends the manga for \\"the art is rich with photorealistic details which help to give the fantasy a solid grounding in reality, and has strong, emotionally honest characters which should make this young adult fantasy appeal to both fans of epic fantasy and contemporary teen dramas.\\" Coolstreak Comics' Leroy Douresseaux comments that he is reminded of the \\"1980s ecological sci-fi comic book, The Puma Blues\\" when reading the manga. He also commends on Igarashi's \\"earthy art, with its busy line work and crosshatching and unsophisticated figure drawing, grounds this series in reality, which makes the moments of enchantment all the more breathtaking.\\" He also recommends the manga to those who liked Inio Asano's Solanin.

Mummified 16th Century Monks Members of the Catholic Order of Franciscans known as \\"Little Brothers\\" arrived in Krak√≥w in 1622 and settled at the outskirts of the town in Garbary (1625). History The church was completed in 1640 thanks to a donation from Zuzanna Amend√≥wna, bequeathed around 1644 along with the miracle painting of Madonna displayed today at the side altar of the new church. The first church of the Order was destroyed during the Swedish Deluge. In 1658 monks settled at the Reformacka street in a small manor given to them by Stanis≈Çaw Warszycki, the castellan of Krak√≥w. In 1666 suffragan bishop Miko≈Çaj Oborski laid the foundation stone for the current church. The chief benefactor of the church and the monastery was Franciszek Szembek, a local noble and the castellan of Kamieniec.

A crucifix stands atop the high altar in accordance with the basic rule of the Order. The Patron of the church, St. Casimir, has his facsimile painted at the side altar (first on the left).

Kazimierza w Krakowie, podziemia klasztoru (The catacombs) The catacombs in the crypt under the Church are among some of the most secret places in the city. Unique climatic conditions found in the basement caused the bodies of the dead to undergo a process of natural mummification whereby they remain in an excellent state of preservation. Among them, hidden away since 1667, are the remains of many monks and members of Polish noble families such as Wielopolscy, Szembekowie, and Morsztynowie. Monastic books reveal that in total almost 1,000 bodies were placed in the catacombs over the years, among them around 730 lay people and 250 monks. The remains of the monks ‚Äì all sitting down ‚Äì are placed right under the chancel of the church, without coffins, directly on earth and sand. In a glass coffin there is the body of Father Sebastian Wolicki. Among the most notable corpses is the body of Countess Domicella Skalska, who was employed by the Church as a housemaid for 20 years. She revealed her noble origin shortly before her death in 1864.Marek Strzala, Krakow Mummies in the Crypts of a Franciscan Monastery In the crypt there is also the body of a Napoleonic soldier, formerly dressed in full uniform, with a sabre and rifle. The monks' oral tradition holds that the soldier was seriously injured and dragged himself to the monastic gates in 1812. He died shortly afterwards, in the infirmary, without regaining consciousness. During World War II the Germans took away the weapons and set up an air raid shelter in the catacombs.

He served as Bishop of Providence from 1972 to 1997. Biography Louis Gelineau was born into a Franco-American family in Burlington, Vermont, to Leonidas and Juliette (n√©e Baribault) Gelineau; he has an older brother, Robert. After attending St. Joseph's Elementary School and Cathedral High School in Burlington, he studied at St. Michael's College for two years before beginning his studies for the priesthood at St. Paul's University in Ottawa, Ontario, from where he later obtained a Licentiate of Sacred Theology and a Bachelor of Philosophy. He was ordained a priest on June 5, 1954, and then served as assistant pastor at All Saints Parish in Richford (1954‚Äì1956) and at St. Stephen Parish in Winooski (1956‚Äì1957). Gelineau was sent to further his studies at the Catholic University of America in 1957 and earned a Licentiate of Canon Law in 1959. Returning to the Diocese of Burlington, he was named assistant chancellor of the Diocese and secretary and master of ceremonies to Bishop Robert Francis Joyce. He also served as director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith and assistant chaplain at De Goesbriand Memorial Hospital. He became chancellor of the Diocese in 1961 and was raised to the rank of Papal Chamberlain by Pope John XXIII. In 1968 he became vicar general of the Burlington Diocese and a Prelate of His Holiness. On December 6, 1971, Gelineau was appointed the sixth Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on January 26, 1972, from Bishop Joyce, with Bishops Bernard Joseph Flanagan and Edward Cornelius O'Leary serving as co-consecrators. In 1988, Gelineau declared that removing a feeding tube from 48-year-old Marcia Gray, a comatose Rhode Island woman, \\"does not contradict Catholic moral theology,\\" but emphasized that he \\"in no way supports or condones the practice of euthanasia.\\" He also opposed a 1985 ordinance for the city of Providence to protect homosexuals from discrimination in employment, housing, credit and access to public accommodations. He said, \\"Homosexual acts are contrary to God's command and contrary to his purpose in creating sex. To give support to this proposed legislation may easily be interpreted as supporting the homosexual lifestyle.\\" Later, in 1995, when the Rhode Island Senate passed a gay rights bill, Gelineau stated, \\"If [proposed legislation] seeks to afford protection from unjust discrimination, which is not now afforded under our laws, then those laws should be changed.\\" G√©lineau has long been accused of various forms of sexual misconduct. According to a 1997 deposition by Robert Cadorette, G√©lineau, while assigned to a Vermont orphanage in the 1950s, molested Cadorette as a boy several times and attempted to drown him later. In a 1997 deposition, he denied any sexual misdeeds with an altar boy in 1994. Gelineau was also criticized for his management of sexual abuse allegations in the Providence Diocese. After a 25-year-long tenure, Gelineau resigned as Bishop on June 11, 1997. He became chaplain at St. Antoine Residence in March 2004.

The -story facility, located sixty miles west of St. Louis, housed 155 elderly people and had been converted just two years earlier, after having previously served as the site of Central Wesleyan College. Fire The blaze began at approximately 2:40 p.m. in a first floor annex linen closet during a Sunday afternoon religious service. On the first floor of the main building, Lutheran minister Walter Schwane was leading a hymn, \\"What a Friend We Have in Jesus,\\" when a scream was heard from one of the visitors who had noticed smoke near the room of her uncles. Concerned, she soon saw intense flames near the closet and screamed \\"Fire!\\" as she raced throughout the facility. Within 30 minutes, the annex building became an inferno with local residents offering help in attempting to rescue residents. Eventually, the building's roof caved in, with flames shooting high into the air and smoke visible from away. Aftermath In the aftermath of the tragedy, it was determined that a number of factors served as potential causes, including wood in the building that was more than 50 years old, coupled with thermostats often kept at to keep residents comfortable during the frigid winter months. The facility had been inspected just one week earlier by a state official. However, in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, arson was suggested by one Missouri State Police officer when it was disclosed that the sister of the Home's manager had run a similar facility in Hillsboro, Missouri in which 18 people died in a 1952 fire. During the subsequent investigation, the notion of arson was dismissed as the final determination was that the blaze started from an undetermined cause. Despite this finding, the facility had been operating without a license, had inadequate fire escapes, and lacked a sprinkler system. In addition, there was no alarm system nor evacuation plan, while some residents were locked in their rooms, being a common practice of that period. The end result of those omissions came when Missouri Governor James T. Blair signed a bill in March 1957 that established minimum safety standards for nursing homes in the state.

The Naval Academy was founded in 1872 by the Chief of the Imperial Admiralty, Lieutenant General Albrecht von Stosch, as a graduate school to prepare naval officers selected for higher duties in the Imperial Navy. He took as a model the Prussian Military Academy, which trained general staff officers for the Prussian army. The curriculum consisted of navy subjects such as naval history and general education courses. In addition, course participants learned two modern foreign languages. Initially the training lasted for three years; beginning in 1883 it was shortened to two years.Rolf Hobson: Imperialismus: Seemachtideologie, seestrategisches Denken und der Tirpitzplan 1875-1914. √úbersetzt von Eva Besteck, Beitr√§ge zur Milit√§rgeschichte Bd. 61, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, M√ºnchen 2004, .

The building contained accommodations for the students, also model collections and a library of about 40,000 volumes. In 1910 the Academy moved to the M√ºrwik Naval School in Flensburg-M√ºrwik, where it remains today, used since 1956 by the German Navy of the Federal Republic of Germany.

By virtue of Republic Act No. 5509, approved on June 21, 1969, LNPHS was converted into a national comprehensive high school. At present, it accommodates students from different municipalities of the province offering basic and science curriculum. Its Department of Education ID is 304005.Masterlist of Schools , DepEd Official Website Programs The school has four curricula: Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Basic Education Curriculum (BEC), Open High School and Special Program for Sports (SPS). STEM is a program designed for students with above-average science and technology performance. Unlike BEC, it offers not just introductory but also advance sciences and even research. Analytical geometry and calculus are also introduced. Though operated by the Department of Education, the program is also supported by the Department of Science and Technology. Facilities were funded by DOST - Engineering and Science Education Program. An entrance examination must be passed to enroll in the program. Open high school is designed for students hindered by certain reasons to attend school everyday. The school provides modules for students to study at home and meet only on Saturday and Sunday. Special Program for Sports (SPS) is for the athlete students which focuses on sports. Students Most of the students in the school are under the BEC. Only the top 90 entrance examinees are allowed to enroll in STEM. Qualification will not be based on the grades' overall average but only on average of Sciences, Mathematics and English grades.

She is primarily notable for her organizing and activism against the US Occupation of Iraq while serving as an active duty military member, including serving on the Executive Board of Iraq Veterans Against the War. In 2009 it was announced that she was heading a committee responsible for gaining and training more active duty anti-war soldiers. She has the somewhat unusual status of being a war resister strictly holding to legalities, and has been identified as a primary \\"force multiplier\\" for other servicemembers attempting to resist the war through legal means. Military service Coppa enlisted in the Army in 2000 under the Delayed Entry Program and began her service as a Military Intelligence soldier in February 2001. Much of her work during the war was classified, and she has generally refused to speak about those matters, citing legal restrictions. Protest activities In February 2007, Coppa became active with Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW), though she did not come to prominence until January 2008, when she took over the GI Outreach Team for IVAW. She began coordinating the active duty wing of IVAW, flying and driving around the country, and visiting military bases to speak, distribute information, and organize other soldiers. She rose to international media attention in March 2008, when she testified at the Winter Soldier: Iraq & Afghanistan hearings in Silver Spring, Maryland. One of only two active duty participants, she chaired the Breakdown of the Military panel. Shortly after testifying, she was reassigned to Germany but still made regular appearances inside the US, including at the Winter Soldier on the Hill hearings before Congress in May 2008 and on the State of the Union Base Tour. She was a main organizer of the DNC and RNC protests. In early 2009, she was named to the IVAW Board of Directors, and was subsequently elected to the Executive Board. She later resigned from this position, whistleblowing and citing ethical concerns about another executive board member. She was removed from the board after refusing to recant the charges. Military repercussions Coppa reported suffering informal harassment by her unit and was also investigated by CID with no charges filed shortly after Winter Soldier. Shortly after being named to the Board of Directors, she was also placed under investigation and threatened with court-martial and potential discharge for her blogging and other activities. Coppa was represented by military law expert Michael Lebowitz, who successfully defended her against charges of disloyal statements and dereliction of duty. Coppa later received company-grade nonjudicial punishment for appearing in uniform at a protest march during participation at an IVAW- led march two years prior. Print and film Coppa was a main character in the documentary filmseries \\"This Is Where We Take Our Stand\\", appearing in several episodes and the introductory and closing sequences.

In education The concept was popularized by Robert Havighurst in his 1952 book, Human Development and Education. In the context of education theory, Havighurst explained, :\\"A developmental task is a task which is learned at a specific point and which makes achievement of succeeding tasks possible. When the timing is right, the ability to learn a particular task will be possible. This is referred to as a 'teachable moment.' It is important to keep in mind that unless the time is right, learning will not occur. Hence, it is important to repeat important points whenever possible so that when a student's teachable moment occurs, s/he can benefit from the knowledge.\\"Havinghurst, Robert James, (1952). Human Development and Education, p. 7. The concept pre-dates Havighurst's book, as does use of the phrase,For example, \\"...this opportune time, this most teachable moment...\\" Brandenburg, Walter E. (1917). The Philosophy of Christian Being. Sherman, French, p. 84. Retrieved on 2009-08-01. but he is credited with popularizing it.Wald, Barbara Frankel. Letters: \\"Footnote to a headline,\\" University of Chicago Magazine. Vol. 95, No. 2 (December 2002). The phrase sometimes denotes not a developmental stage, but rather \\"that moment when a unique, high interest situation arises that lends itself to discussion of a particular topic.\\"Lozo, Fredric (2005). The Project Gutenberg eBook of Sequential Problem Solving. Originally published by Eidon Books, 1998, . It implies \\"personal engagement\\" with issues and problems.Parker-Pope, Tara. \\"It‚Äôs Not Discipline, It‚Äôs a Teachable Moment,\\" New York Times. September 15, 2008.

In July 2009, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates was arrested at his home; the incident garnered media attention throughout the United States. The mayor of Cambridge, E. Denise Simmons, said that she hoped that the result would be a \\"teachable moment\\".CBS Broadcasting, Inc. Patrick 'Troubled' By Harvard Professor's Arrest. WBZ-TV, July 22, 2009. U.S. President Barack Obama expressed the same hope as Simmons: Obama's use of the phrase attracted considerable comment in the American media and blogosphere. Gates himself echoed the same theme, stating, \\"I told the President that my entire career as an educator has been devoted to racial healing and improved race relations in this country. I am determined that this be a teaching moment.\\"Baker, Peter and Helene Cooper. \\"Obama Shifts Tone on Gates After Mulling Debate,\\" New York Times. July 24, 2009. On July 4, 2011, Glyn Davis, vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, used the term in an article in Campus Review, describing the Australian Higher Education Base Funding Review as a rare opportunity to educate a wider public about how public tertiary education is supported. Davis argued that Australian Universities must show why Australia's public universities returned to the community the money spent providing higher education, and that this constituted a teachable moment. Pragmatic use A teachable moment is often best demonstrated with a significant emotional or traumatic event, the emphasis being on the 'moment' versus the lesson. An example would be, after a high-speed motor vehicle accident, when the use of a seat belt has obviously saved a life, or conversely, when the lack of a seat belt has caused loss of life. Law enforcement and first responders are often taught and encouraged to use appropriate situations to 'teach' the public. Trust and the creation of teachable moments Teachable moments are not limited to episodes following error or miscreancy, where vulnerability opens the learner to teaching. There is also much work on the mechanisms and psychology by which teachable moments are created in relationships. Recent work by developmental psychologists Gyorgy Gergely and Gergely CsibraGergely Csibra and Gyorgy Gergely (2011) \\"Natural pedagogy as evolutionary adaptation\\" Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 366, 1149‚Äì1157. http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/366/1567/1149 that has been picked up by other psychologists and psychotherapists, especially Peter Fonagy and Elizabeth Allison,Fonagy, Peter; Allison, Elizabeth (2014) The role of mentalizing and epistemic trust in the therapeutic relationship. Psychotherapy, Vol 51(3), Sep 2014, 372-380. describes a \\"natural pedagogical stance\\": this is accessed only when \\"epistemic trust\\" is created in the \\"learner\\", and epistemic trust is created when the learner experiences (recognises) his or her own mind in that \\"teachable moment\\" as having been accepted and understood by the \\"teacher\\". This is what triggers curiosity in the contents of the understanding mind of the teacher, and a readiness to generalise the information taken in from the teacher to other contexts and people. Some impressive experimental evidence supports this theory. They argue that this learning pathway is almost entirely human-specific, requiring as it does the linked psychological function of mentalization to have occurred. The logical corollary of this line of thinking is that in creating the \\"teachable moment\\" the \\"teacher's\\" first job is not to consider how to change the learner's mind, but how to change his or her own mind, in order to better represent that mind of the learner as it is now, and create conditions (through utterances, facial expression and other cues) in which it can be recognised by the learner.

Njaw√© was arrested for the first time in 1981, and would go on to be arrested about 125 more times before his death. In 1990, Le Messager was briefly seized by the government for its reporting on a riot. In 1990, Njaw√©'s publishing of an \\"open letter\\" to Biya led to another arrest. The paper was banned in 1992, forcing Njaw√© into a short exile in Benin, where he continued to publish. Njaw√© returned to the country in February 1993 despite being accused by the government of drug dealing, counterfeiting, and sedition; he founded the Cameroon Organization for Press Freedom one month later. In 1996, he was imprisoned on charges of \\"insulting the president and members of the National Assembly\\". In 1998, Njaw√© was sentenced to two years in prison when Le Messager ran an article suggesting that Biya had a heart condition. The sentence for running this article was later reduced, and due to pressures from Human Rights groups, Njaw√© was pardoned after almost a year in prison. His wife had miscarried in the interim, reportedly due to mistreatment by prison guards. Njaw√© wrote a book about his prison experience titled Bloc-notes d'un Bagnard (\\"Notebooks of a Convict\\"), which he published in 1998. Njaw√©'s wife Jane was killed in a car accident in September 2002, causing him to found an organisation calling for safer road conditions in Cameroon. He had eight children. Shortly before his own death in a car accident, Njaw√© told an interviewer that \\"A word can be more powerful than a weapon and I believe that with the word... we can build a better world and make happier people. So, why give up while duty still calls? No one will silence me, except The Lord, before I achieve what I consider as a mission in my native country, in Africa and, why not, in the world.\\" Awards In 1991, Njaw√© was awarded an International Press Freedom Award by the US-based Committee to Protect Journalists. It was the prize's inaugural year. Two years later, he won the World Association of Newspapers' Golden Pen of Freedom Award. In 2000, he was named one of the Austria-based International Press Institute's fifty World Press Freedom Heroes of the last fifty years. The award citation called him \\"Cameroon's most beleaguered journalist and one of Africa's most courageous fighters for press freedom\\". Death On 12 July 2010, Njaw√© was killed when a lorry struck a car in which he was riding in Chesapeake, Virginia, US. Njaw√© had travelled to the city attend a meeting of the Cameroon Diaspora for Change. The member organisations of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange memorialised him as a \\"torchbearer for press freedom\\". Reporters Without Borders stated that Njaw√© \\"fought every press freedom struggle. We will not forget, for example that he joined us on a visit to Sarajevo, in 1992, to offer support to 'Oslobodenje', the only newspaper that continued to come out during the war in Yugoslavia.\\" References Cameroonian journalists Cameroonian democracy activists People from Douala Recipients of Cameroonian presidential pardons Road incident deaths in Virginia 1957 births 2010 deaths ","title":"Pius Njaw√©"},{"id":"23747306","text":"Rohan Bopanna and Eric Butorac were the defending champions, but Bopanna did not participate that year.

Despite his longevity he is a relatively obscure figure. His origins lie in the same landed and wealthy aristocratic family as those of the Count Piniolo (Pi√±olo) who founded the monastery of San Juan Bautista de Corias.Carlos de Ayala Mart√≠nez (2008), Sacerdocio y reino en la Espa√±a altomedieval [Priesthood and kingship in early medieval Spain] (Silex Ediciones, .), 194. While the city of Oviedo and its diocese were overshadowed at the time of Oveco's election, at the height of his career, during the turbulent reign of Ramiro II, he was the senior bishop of the realm and his city was labelled the sedem regum (\\"seat of kings\\"). Early episcopate (\\"Oveco I\\") According to a theory advanced by Carlos Gonz√°lez de Posada (1745‚Äì1831) and Manuel Risco there were two Ovecos who were bishops of Oviedo between 913 and 961. These years in the history of the diocese of Oviedo are extremely obscure and must be reconstructed primarily from documentary evidence extracted with care from amongst the forgeries of Bishop Pelagius. Posada partitioned the documentary references to Oveco into an Oveco I (until 920, when he died according to Risco) and an Oveco II (926‚Äì61). Part of the confusion is due to the probable presence in Oviedo since at the latest 899 of an auxiliary bishop named Hermenegild and counted by Posada as Bishop Hermenegild II (915‚Äì22) based on a document of 921. Posada also placed a certain Flacinus II in 923‚Äì25. Though Oveco signed a document of 27 June 912 as Oveco Ovetensis sedis episcopus (\\"Oveco, bishop of the see of Oviedo\\"), his predecessor, Flacinus, was still bishop in October that year and it is probable that the copyist of the document dated it early by a year. Oveco appears in several charters of Ordo√±o II that are clearly dated incorrectly, but the authenticity of these (in spite of their dating clauses) is not established. A charter of 1 December 914 conserved in the Cathedral of Mondo√±edo is the earliest attestation of Oveco as bishop with a certain date. On 29 January 915 Oveco attended a council of bishops held in Zamora. The council discussed the refoundation of the dioceses of Tuy and Lamego and the return of certain properties which had been held by the other bishops for sustenance during the period when their cities were under the control of the Emirate of C√≥rdoba but which in fact pertained to the Diocese of Iria Flavia. Senior bishop of the realm (922‚Äì951) Oveco witnessed several charters of Ordo√±o II during the years 916 and 917, some of them of dubious authenticity. One such, a charter relating to the dedication of a church in Le√≥n and Ordo√±o's coronation there (9 January 916), has raised questions because of the lapse in time between Ordo√±o's succession (914) and his supposed coronation. While Oveco does not appear in any royal charters of 918 or 919,A charter of 8 May 920 is redated by Lucien Barrau-Dihigo to 919 on the basis that the dating clause is incomplete in the surviving copy. his importance is illustrated by his place among the signatories of Ordo√±o's concessions to Santos Cosme y Dami√°n dated 12 April 920. He signs immediately after Ordo√±o, his brother Fruela II, and their brother, the infante Gonzalo, a younger son of Alfonso III who had entered the church and was an archdeacon under Oveco at Oviedo. In a royal charter of 1 August 922 Oveco is listed first among the bishops, probably by then the senior member of the Asturian episcopate. When Ordo√±o was succeeded by his brother Fruela, who had already been ruling Asturias, in 924 the royal court was moved from Le√≥n back to Oviedo.Fruela's former realm was then bestowed on Ramiro, the youngest son of Alfonso III. In a royal charter of 17 September 924 Oveco calls himself sedis Regis Ovetensis (\\"of the royal see of Oviedo\\"). In a later diploma of that same year Oveco goes further and calls himself Obecco Dei gratia eps (\\"Oveco, by the grace of God bishop\\") for the first time.This titulature was used again in a document of 9 February 937. Towards the end of 927 a church council was held under the joint presidency of Alfonso IV, son of Ordo√±o II and successor of Fruela II, and his elder brother Sancho, then ruling Galicia, to address the disorganisation of the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Loyo. Oveco is listed second among the assembled at the end of the minutes (dated 23 December). He is recorded as Sancti Saluatoris ouetensis eps (bishop of San Salvador de Oviedo). The record of Oveco in subsequent years is complicated by the fact that Le√≥n also had at that time a bishop named Oveco (928‚Äì50). In many cases it is impossible to determine to which \\"Bishop Oveco\\" a given charter refers. In 933 both Ovecos, of Oviedo and Le√≥n, signed documents of Ramiro II and his queen, Urraca S√°nchez. During Ramiro's reign Oveco of Oviedo usually signed first among bishops. On 13 September 936, Froila Guti√©rrez and his wife donated a parcel of land to his brother Rudesind for the construction of a monastery, later known as Celanova. A bishop Oveco witnessed the donation, but whether the bishop of Oviedo or Le√≥n is unknown. The bishop of Oviedo later witnessed a donation of Ilduara, Rudesind's mother, to Celanova on 27 February 938. Oveco's star continued to rise under Ramiro II. On 26 September 942 Rudesind named a certain Frankila abbot of Celanova and donated numerous goods to the monastery. This donation was undersigned by the king first, Rudesind second, and Oveco third, who is qualified as gerens pastorali cura Ouetencis ecclesia et regia sedem (\\"bearing pastoral care of the royal see and church of Oviedo\\"). The dating clause refers to the year as anno feliciter decimo in sedem regum Ouetho (\\"happily the tenth year [of Ramiro's reign] in the royal seat of Oviedo\\"), indicating the high place of Oviedo in the kingdom under Ramiro II. Despite this, the capital was still Le√≥n, where Oveco confirmed a charter of Ramiro's on 25 May 948, the last date he appears in a document of this king. Declining health and death In 951 Oveco appears in two charters of Ordo√±o III, Ramiro's successor. After that he only appears twice in the documents (in 953 and 957), perhaps due to advanced age, though he may have ruled his see for a decade more. The Spanish historian Manuel Risco places his death in 962, though Antonio Palomeque Torres believes that 957 or 958 was more likely.

UTC was based on Catholic social doctrine. A core sector of the newly founded UTC were the Catholic trade unions in the textile factories of Medell√≠n.Cambridge History of Latin America 8. Latin America Since 1930. Cambridge [u.a.]: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996. p. 609 UTC immediately attracted many members‚Äîsome from the ranks of the CTC and others from small unions, particularly industry groups‚Äîthat had not been enticed to join the leftist CTC. Both industrialists and the Conservative government supported the UTC, largely because it did not represent a threat to the political and economic elite. The subsequent period of labour repression and co-optation by the government served to eliminate radical elements of the movement while taming the less militant segments. The near anarchy that followed the 1948 assassination of Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, a member of Congress who had long been a champion of the disadvantaged, had a different although equally demoralizing effect on rural workers. The plight of smallholder coffee farmers worsened rapidly, and many of them fled the countryside in the face of widespread violence. This served to consolidate landholdings in rural areas, as well as drive large numbers of unskilled rural laborers into the hands of the UTC. Collectively, labor emerged from the 1950s demoralized and virtually without political power. The UTC, which at this point commanded the majority of organized labor and the diminished rural groups, had no political means of effecting even the slightest changes and was without an advocate in national government. Gradually, UTC acquired a more secular profile.Cambridge History of Latin America 8. Latin America Since 1930. Cambridge [u.a.]: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996. p. 638 During the National Front period the UTC faced numerous internal problems, which caused many individual unions to withdraw from its ranks. Moreover, the UTC (along with CTC) was increasingly seen as instruments of the political elite, a factor contributing to its decreasing influence amongst Colombian workers. During the 1980s, UTC had entered into severe crisis.

In the days when light came from burning oil in lamps, a vessel at sea needed crewmen to constantly care for the lamps. This care involved trimming the wick, which drew the oil up from the storage reservoir, so that the flame would be clean and bright. Lamp trimmers also refilled the reservoirs, which held enough oil for several hours of burning, but not enough to start a major fire if the lamp were to be knocked down or damaged somehow. As vessels became larger, the number of lamp trimmers increased significantly, because the only lighting below decks came from lamps. The position of lamp trimmer was so entrenched into marine tradition that electricians were called lamp trimmers for years after oil lamps had been completely replaced. The skilled part of being a lamp trimmer was the ability to trim a wick in such a way that it would burn evenly, without hot spots, so that it would not need attention again for some time. A poorly trimmed wick creates a flame which is dim and smoky. A properly trimmed wick should come to a rounded point, or should be wedge shaped. When lit, the wick should burn cleanly all the way up to the highest flame it can make. The flame should be at least the width of the wick, and even, not ragged.

He served as Bishop of Wilmington, Delaware (1985‚Äì1995) and Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island (1997‚Äì2005). Life and career Robert Mulvee was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to John F. and Jennie T. Mulvee. He studied at St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield, Connecticut; St. Paul University in Ottawa, Ontario; and American College at Louvain in Belgium. While at Louvain, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Manchester, New Hampshire, on June 30, 1957. Mulvee did pastoral work for several years before furthering his studies in Europe, earning a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome (1964) and a Master's degree in religious education from the University of Louvain. Following his return to the United States, he was named assistant chancellor of the Manchester Diocese and in 1966 a Papal Chamberlain. On February 15, 1977, Mulvee was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Manchester and Titular Bishop of Summa by Pope Paul VI. The position of auxiliary bishop was new in the Manchester diocese at the time, with Mulvee the first to attain this position. While in Manchester, Mulvee stayed as a guest at Saint Anselm Abbey. He received his episcopal consecration on April 14, 1977, from Bishop Odore Joseph Gendron, with Bishops Ernest John Primeau and John Francis Hackett serving as co-consecrators. After the death of Bishop Thomas Joseph Mardaga, Mulvee was named the seventh Bishop of Wilmington, Delaware, on February 19, 1985. He was replaced as auxiliary of Manchester by his friend Bishop Joseph John Gerry, O.S.B. of Saint Anselm Abbey. During his tenure as Bishop of Wilmington, he emphasized collegiality in his administration of the diocese, helped restructure the Delmarva Ecumenical Agency into the Christian Council of Delaware and Maryland's Eastern Shore, and founded three new missions and raised a fourth to parish status. Mulvee was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, on February 9, 1995, and later succeeded Louis Edward Gelineau as the seventh Bishop of Providence upon the latter's resignation on June 11, 1997. In September 2002, Mulvee ended a 10-year-long (the longest in the nation) legal battle over clerical sexual abuse cases. Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Mulvee submitted his letter of resignation to Pope John Paul II on February 15, 2005. His resignation was accepted on March 31, 2005, and Bishop Thomas Joseph Tobin was appointed his successor. He served as apostolic administrator of the Providence diocese until Bishop Tobin's installation on May 31, 2006. On December 28, 2018, Mulvee died at St. Antoine Residence, an assisted-living community in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. He was 88.

The Rosenblatts had earlier won a settlement of $300 million on behalf of a group of 60,000 flight attendants who alleged that they had been injured by secondhand smoke and their approach in the Engle case was a focus on how cigarette makers used \\"diversionary tactics to keep alive a nonexistent scientific controversy about smoking and health\\".Meier, Barry. \\"Trial to Begin In Big Lawsuit By Smokers In Florida\\", The New York Times, July 6, 1998.

He studied and lived in Italy and France where he also published many of his works. Boscovich produced a precursor of atomic theory and made many contributions to astronomy, including the first geometric procedure for determining the equator of a rotating planet from three observations of a surface feature and for computing the orbit of a planet from three observations of its position. In 1753 he also discovered the absence of atmosphere on the Moon. Biography=Early years= Boscovich was born on 18 May 1711 in Ragusa (Dubrovnik), Republic of Ragusa, to Nikola Bo≈°koviƒá, a Ragusan merchant, and Paola Bettera (1674‚Äì1777), daughter of a local nobleman of Italian origin. Boscovich‚Äôs father was a Croat (some sources say Serb). He was baptised on 26 May 1711 by Marinus Carolis, curatus et sacristia. The name Ruƒëer/Ruggiero may have been given to him because both his great-grandfather Agostino Bettera and his mother's brother were called Ruggiero, the godfather was his uncle Ruggiero Bettera. He was the seventh child of the family and the second youngest. His father was born in the village of Orahov Do near Ravno, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire (now Bosnia and Herzegovina).'\\"Roger Joseph Boscovich'\\" SJ FRS, 1711‚Äì1787 Studies of his life and work on the 250th anniversary of his birth, edited L L Whyte, George Allen and Unwin, London, 1961.

Boscovich's mother Paola, nicknamed \\"Pavica\\", was a member of a cultivated Italian merchant family established in Dubrovnik since the early 17th century, when her ancestor Pietro Bettera settled from Bergamo in northern Italy. She was described as a robust and active woman with a happy temperament who lived to 103. Paola Bettera left nothing in writing, but Boscovich's aunt, her sister, wrote poetry in Italian. Their sons, Ruƒëer's cousins and playmates, Antun Bo≈°koviƒá and Franjo Bo≈°koviƒá, grew up into good Latinists. His own brothers and sisters were all older than himself, except his sister Anica Bo≈°koviƒá (1714‚Äì1804), two years his junior. His eldest sister Mare Bo≈°koviƒá, nineteen years his senior, was the only member of the family to marry; his second sister Marija Bo≈°koviƒá became a nun in the Ragusa Convent of St Catherine's. His eldest brother Bo≈æo Bo≈°koviƒá (Bo≈°ko, called Natale by Roger in private correspondenceSee the two volumes Edoardo Proverbio (cur.), Carteggio con Natale Boscovich, Edizione Nazionale delle Opere e della Corrispondenza di Ruggiero Giuseppe Boscovich, Milan 2009 ), thirteen years older, joined the service of the Ragusa Republic. His brother Bartolomej (Baro) Bo≈°koviƒá, born in 1700 and educated at the Jesuit school in Dubrovnik, left home when Ruƒëer was 3 to become a scholar and a Jesuit priest in Rome. He also wrote good verse in both Latin and \\"Illyrian\\" (the Renaissance era name for Serbo-Croatian), but eventually burnt some of his manuscripts out of a scrupulous modesty. His brother Ivan (ƒêivo) Bo≈°koviƒá became a Dominican in a sixteenth-century monastery in Dubrovnik, whose church Ruƒëer knew as a child with its rich treasures and paintings by Titian and Vasari, still there today. His brother Petar (Pero) Bo≈°koviƒá, six years his senior, became a poet like his grandfather. He too was schooled by the Jesuits, then served as an official of the Republic and made his reputation as a translator of Ovid, Corneille's Cid and of Moli√®re. A volume of his religious verse, Hvale Duhovne, was published in Venice in 1729. At the age of 8 or 9, after acquiring the rudiments of reading and writing from the priest Nicola Nicchei of the Church of St. Nicholas, Ruƒëer was sent for schooling to the local Jesuit Collegium Regusinum. During his early studies Roger Boscovich showed a distinct propensity for further intellectual development. He gained a reputation at school for having an easy memory and a quick, deep mind. On 16 September 1725, Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá left Dubrovnik for Rome. He was in the care of two Jesuit priests who took him to the Society of Jesus, famous for its education of youth and at that time having some 800 establishments and 200,000 pupils under its care throughout the world. We learn nothing from Bo≈°koviƒá himself until the time he entered the novitiate in 1731, but it was the usual practice for novices to spend the first two years not in the Collegium Romanum but in Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. There, he studied mathematics and physics; and so brilliant was his progress in these sciences that in 1740 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the college. He was especially appropriate for this post due to his acquaintance with recent advances in science, and his skill in a classical severity of demonstration, acquired by a thorough study of the works of the Greek geometers. Several years before this appointment he had made a name for himself with an elegant solution of the problem of finding the Sun's equator and determining the period of its rotation by observation of the spots on its surface. =Middle years= Notwithstanding the arduous duties of his professorship, he found time for investigation in various fields of physical science, and he published a very large number of dissertations, some of them of considerable length. Among the subjects were the transit of Mercury, the Aurora Borealis, the figure of the Earth, the observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the cycloid, the logistic curve, the theory of comets, the tides, the law of continuity, the double refraction micrometre, and various problems of spherical trigonometry. In 1742 he was consulted, with other men of science, by Pope Benedict XIV, as to the best means of securing the stability of the dome of St. Peter's, Rome, in which a crack had been discovered. His suggestion of placing five concentric iron bands was adopted. French translation of Bo≈°koviƒá's De solis ac lunae defectibus. In 1744 he was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood. In 1745 Bo≈°koviƒá published De Viribus Vivis in which he tried to find a middle way between Isaac Newton's gravitational theory and Gottfried Leibniz's metaphysical theory of monad- points. He developed a concept of \\"impenetrability\\" as a property of hard bodies which explained their behaviour in terms of force rather than matter. Stripping atoms of their matter, impenetrability is disassociated from hardness and then put in an arbitrary relationship to elasticity. Impenetrability has a Cartesian sense that more than one point cannot occupy the same location at once.The Conflict between Atomism and Conservation Theory 1644‚Äì1860 by Wilson L. Scott, London and New York, 1970 Bo≈°koviƒá visited his hometown only once, in 1747, never to return. He agreed to take part in the Portuguese expedition for the survey of Brazil and the measurement of a degree of arc of the meridian, but was persuaded by the Pope to stay in Italy and to undertake a similar task there with Christopher Maire, an English Jesuit who measured an arc of two degrees between Rome and Rimini. The operation began at the end of 1750, and was completed in about two years. An account was published in 1755, under the name De Litteraria expeditione per pontificiam ditionem ad dimetiendos duos meridiani gradus a PP. Maire et Boscovicli. The value of this work was increased by a carefully prepared map of the States of the Church. A French translation appeared in 1770 which incorporated, as an appendix, some material first published in 1760 outlining an objective procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters of the fitted model from a greater number of observations. An unconstrained variant of this fitting procedure is now known as the L1-norm or Least absolute deviations procedure and serves as a robust alternative to the familiar L2-norm or Least Squares procedure. A dispute arose between Francis the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Republic of Lucca with respect to the drainage of a lake. As agent of Lucca, Bo≈°koviƒá was sent, in 1757, to Vienna and succeeded in bringing about a satisfactory arrangement in the matter. The first page of figures from Theoria Philosophi√¶ Naturalis from 1763. Figure 1 is the force curve which received so much attention from later natural philosophers such as Joseph Priestley, Humphry Davy, and Michael Faraday. The ordinate is force, with positive values being repulsive, and the abscissa is radial distance. Newton's gravitational attractive force is clearly seen at the far right of figure 1. In Vienna in 1758, he published the first edition of his famous work, Philosophi√¶ naturalis theoria redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium (Theory of Natural philosophy derived to the single Law of forces which exist in Nature), containing his atomic theory and his theory of forces. A second edition was published in 1763 in Venice and a third again in Vienna in 1764. In 1922 it was published in London, and in 1966 in the United States. Another edition was published in Zagreb in 1974. Another occasion to exercise his diplomatic ability soon arose. The British government suspected that warships had been fitted out in Dubrovnik for the service of France, and that therefore the neutrality of the republic had been violated. Bo≈°koviƒá was selected to undertake an ambassadorship to London in 1760, to convince the British that nothing of the sort had occurred and provide proof of Ragusa's neutrality. This mission proved to be a complete success ‚Äì a credit to him and a delight to his countrymen. During his stay in England he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1761 astronomers were preparing to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun. Under the influence of the Royal Society, Bo≈°koviƒá decided to travel to Constantinople. He arrived late and then travelled to Poland via Bulgaria and Moldavia then proceeding to Saint Petersburg where he was elected as a member of Russian Academy of Sciences. Ill health compelled him soon to return to Italy. Bo≈°koviƒá visited Laibach, the capital of Carniola (now Ljubljana, Slovenia), at least in 1757, 1758, and 1763, and made contact with the Jesuits and the Franciscan Friars in the town. The Jesuits incorporated his teachings into their lectures at the Laibach Jesuit College. His physics became the foundation of physical lectures as well in other parts of the Habsburg Monarchy, and influenced the thought of Carl Scherffer, Gabriel Gruber, and Jurij Vega, the prominent physicists of the period. Both Vega and the Rationalist philosopher Franz Samuel Karpe educated their students in Vienna about the ideas of Bo≈°koviƒá and in the spirit of his thought. =Late years= In 1764 he was called to serve as the chair of mathematics at the University of Pavia, and for six years he held this post with the directorship of the observatory of Brera in Milan, That is where Charles Burney met him; since Burney's Italian was not very good at that time, Boscovich obliged him speaking French. He was invited by the Royal Society of London to undertake an expedition to California to observe the transit of Venus in 1769 again, but this was prevented by the recent decree of the Spanish government expelling Jesuits from its dominions. Bo≈°koviƒá had many enemies and he was driven to frequent changes of residence. About 1777 he returned to Milan, where he kept teaching and directing the Brera observatory. Deprived of his post by the intrigues of his associates, he was about to retire to Dubrovnik when in 1773 the news of the suppression of his order in Italy reached him. Uncertainty led him to accept an invitation from the King of France to come to Paris where he was appointed director of optics for the navy, with a pension of 8,000 livres and a position was created for him. He naturalised in France and stayed ten years, but his position became irksome, and at length intolerable. He, however, continued to work in the pursuit of science knowledge, and published many remarkable works. Among them was an elegant solution of the problem to determine the orbit of a comet from three observations, and works on micrometre and achromatic telescopes. In 1783 he returned to Italy and spent two years at Bassano, occupying himself with the publication of his Opera pertinentia ad opticam et astronomiam, etc., published in 1785 in five volumes quarto. After a visit of some months to the convent of Vallombrosa, he went to Brera in 1786 and resumed his work. At that time his health was failing, his reputation was on the wane, his works did not sell, and he gradually fell prey to illness and disappointment. He died in Milan and was buried in the church of St. Maria Podone. =Boscovich's demon= Philosophiae naturalis theoria (1758) In philosophy and physics, Laplace's demon is a thought experiment supporting the concept of determinism. It suggests that if someone (the Demon) knew the precise location and momentum of every particle in the universe, he could in principle calculate the history and future of every particle. For a long time it was believed that Pierre- Simon Laplace, an influential French scholar, was the first one to propose this type of determinism. Recently it has been shown that the first person who offered the image of a super-powerful calculating intelligence was Boscovich, whose formulation of the principle of determinism in his 1758 Theoria philosophiae naturalis turns out not only to be temporally prior to Laplace's but also‚Äîbeing founded on fewer metaphysical principles and more rooted in and elaborated by physical assumptions‚Äîto be more precise, complete, and comprehensive than Laplace's somewhat parenthetical statement of the doctrine. While Laplace's version of determinism is based on general terms, Boscovich's uses physical terms, like position, velocity, direction and centre of mass. Boscovich also (correctly) suggests that the continuity of force is a necessary assumption for determinism, and he presented it in strict mathematical form. In short, Boskovich's determinism is more physical, while Laplace's determinism is more metaphysical, placing it in harmony with Leibniz's metaphysics. Knowing with complete accuracy both the location and velocity of a particle violates the uncertainty principle of modern quantum mechanics, so it is unclear if this is physically possible.

In 1873, Nietzsche wrote a fragment called 'Time Atom Theory', which was a reworking of Boscovich's Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium.

In his most famous book A Theory of Natural Philosophy (1758) he says: \\"Regarding the nature of the Divine Creator, my theory is extraordinarily illuminating, and the result from it is a necessity to recognize Him. ... Therefore vain dreams of those who believe that the world was created by accident, or that it could be built as a fatal necessity, or that it was there for eternity lining itself along his own necessary laws are completely eliminated.\\"A Theory of Natural Philosophy, Zagreb, 1974., page 539 Bo≈°koviƒá also composed poetry with many religious and astronomical allusions. In his Marian devotion, he wrote hexameter verses on the Virgin Mary.Pavle Knezoviƒá -Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá's songs on Virgin Mary, Obnovljeni ≈æivot, Vol.50 No.5 Rujan 1995.http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/3574 In the same dome of St. Peter in Rome, whose cupola he saved from ruin, he worked as a confessor administering the Sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation.  Nationality  The modern concept of nationality, based on ethnic concepts as language, culture, religion, custom, etc., was developed only in the 19th century. For this reason the attribution of a definite \\"nationality\\" to personalities of the previous centuries, living in ethnically mixed regions, is often indeterminable; Bo≈°koviƒá's legacy is consequently celebrated in Croatia, Italy and Serbia. His ethnicity is also part of the Serb-Croat distinctions in self- identification of the Western South Slavic enlighteners, that was one of the major problems in 20th century Yugoslavia.Zlatko Isakovic, Identity and Security in Former Yugoslavia, Routledge Revivals, Edition reprint, Routledge, 2019, , p. 59. Croatian sources stress that he referred to his Croatian identity. Bo≈°koviƒá's published letters and correspondence can be found in the Work of Yugoslav Academy of Arts and Sciences, number 185, year 1911 (of special interest are pages 345 and 377). In writings to his sister Anica (Anna), he told her he had not forgotten the Croatian language. In a letter to his brother from 1757, he describes the encounter with Croatian soldiers in Vienna and remarks at the end of the letter: \\"Eviva Haddick e i nostri Croati!\\" (\\"Long life to Hadik and to our Croats!\\"). While living in Paris and attending to a military parade where he saw a Croatian unit from Ragusa, his words were: \\"there are my brave Croats\\". Italian sources claim that Boscovich was remembered as an Italian. According to Italian sources, he was born in a city with mixed cultures, Croatian and Italian, and the higher social strata of Dubrovnik were under Italian influence (Roman-Dalmatian influence). His mother's family came from Italy, and his life and career had strong Italian influences. He moved to Italy at age 14, where he spent most of his life. In some encyclopaedias he is described as an Italian scientist. He used the Italian language in private, including in correspondence with his brother Baro, and Voltaire wrote to Bo≈°koviƒá in Italian \\"as a sign of respect\\". A number of sources claim that Boscovich is a Serbian scientist or of Serbian paternal origin. The Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts ranks him among the 100 most prominent Serbs, based on the claim that he is of ethnic Serb paternal ancestry. According to this theory, the Bo≈°koviƒá brotherhood, originally surnamed Pokrajƒçiƒá, had settled the village from the surrounding mountains of Popovo. Branches of the brotherhood also settled the surroundings of Stolac. Boscovich himself was proud of his Dalmatian identity. When d'Alembert in his Opuscule math√©matiques... called him \\"an Italian mathematician\\", he shoot back that he was \\"a Dalmatian from Dubrovnik, and not an Italian\\".Harris, Robin. Dubrovnik, A History. London:Saqi Books, 2003. , p. 618. However, he added that he had been living in Italy for a long time since his first youth, so \\"he can in some way be called Italian\\".Dadiƒá, ≈Ωarko. Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá (Parallel text in Croatian and English). Zagreb: ≈†kolska Knjiga, 1987, pp. 51‚Äì52.

They typically depict characters from anime, manga or video games and are designed with a large head and smaller body to give them a cute appearance. Their faces and other body parts are exchangeable, giving them a range of different expressions and poses. The Nendoroid brand spans a variety of different products: the original 10 cm figures, smaller Nendoroid Petite figures, additional display tools known as the Nendoroid More series as well as plushies and play sets. Several video games have also been released based on Nendoroid designs.  Products  Haruhi Suzumiya with interchangeable body parts and facial expressions are shown. The series of figures are made from ABS and PVC. They are designed in a chibi or super deformed style, with a large head and smaller body to give them a cute appearance. The figures are used as both collectors items and toys. Their faces and other body parts are exchangeable, giving them a range of different possible expressions and poses. The name is derived from the Japanese word for clay, , possibly because they resemble clay models. Nendoroid figures have mostly been based on female characters from anime, manga or video games series such as Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Steins;Gate, K-ON!, Haruhi Suzumiya, Fate/stay night, Vocaloid, etc. However, in recent years, the line has begun including characters from various Disney properties, as well as the Star Wars franchise and American superhero movies like Iron Man 3, Wonder Woman, Thor: Ragnarok, Justice League, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War. is the primary series where each figure is approximately 10 cm in height and includes a special Nendoroid stand to display the figure. Most also come with alternate arms and legs allowing for different poses, and expression parts that can be swapped out to display a different emotion. The legs, arms and neck are all articulated allowing some degree of movement. Certain Nendoroid figures known as the Edition series have additional articulated joints. Nendoroids often also include optional parts such as weapons, items, or other key elements from the series they come from. The expressions and other parts can also be swapped between Nendoroids, allowing collectors to mix and match parts from different characters. Nendoroids have no set price, but as of 2013 average between 3000 and 4000 Japanese yen. While most official Nendoroids are released by Good Smile Company, there are certain characters that are released by FREEing, Phat! Company and other companies. They are however always distributed by Good Smile Company. The series is very similar to the primary series, but the figures are roughly half the size at approximately 6.5 cm each. They also include a small stand to display the figure. Nendoroid Petites are sold either as complete sets or in blind boxes that have a single random character. Like their larger counterparts, the facial expressions and other optional parts can be swapped between other Nendoroid Petite characters. As of 2013 singles sell for 600 Japanese yen, while the larger sets differ depending on the number of characters in the set. The series was designed as a project by the new university graduates that joined Good Smile Company in 2012. The idea behind the series was to create an easier and more enjoyable way to display Nendoroid figures. The series includes clips and suction cup stands that can each hold a single Nendoroid figure, as well as decorative parts that can be attached to figures and stands. The are small dioramic rooms that are designed as a display area for Nendoroids. They are produced and manufactured by Phat! Company. The series refers to other goods that are based on the Nendoroid designs, however are not actually ABS&PVC; figures. These include rubber straps, plushies and charms. They are often released by companies other than Good Smile Company.  Video games  An RPG based on Nendoroid figure series titled , was developed by Bandai Namco Games, Good Smile Company and Banpresto for PlayStation Portable. The game features Nendoroid versions of characters from Steins;Gate, Black Rock Shooter, Haruhi Suzumiya, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Zero no Tsukaima, Dog Days, Fate/stay night, as well as Good Smile Company's mascot character, Gumako. The game was released in Japan on February 23, 2012. Hatsune Miku and Future Stars: Project Mirai is a music game for the Nintendo 3DS based on the Vocaloid character, Hatsune Miku, with her appearance based on the Nendoroid design.Project Mirai - Sega A sequel to the game titled Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai 2 was released on November 28, 2013.Project Mirai 2 - Sega  History and reception The first character to be sold as a Nendoroid was Nendoroid Neko Arc from the Tsukihime game, which was released at Wonder Festival 2006. The original creator of the series was Tsuyoshi Oda (Also known as Oda-P), however the series is now worked on by a number of people who work under the collective name Nendoron. The reason for this collective name was that too many people worked simultaneously on a single Nendoroid, making it difficult to credit them all. The planning and production of a single figure is done by over ten people on the Good Smile Company team.\\"Nendoroid Complete File\\" p.73, Hobby Japan, 2012, By March 2009, the Nendoroid series had sold over 1 million units and the Nendoroid Petite series had sold over 3 million units.Tokyo International Anime Fair 2009, Good Smile Company Booth Explanation The series expanded quickly, and by July 2010 there were over 100 different Nendoroids. In May 2013, Good Smile Company released its 300th product in the base series, Hatsune Miku 2.0, which was an advanced version of the previous best-selling Nendoroid Hatsune Miku. The box design and method of connecting face plates was also improved from this release onward.

Teruel in 1992 in the Philippines. The church's goal is to mediate and unite the Western Rite or the Roman Catholic Church, and the Eastern Rite or the Eastern Orthodox Church to form a single Catholic church. The Apostolic Catholic Church has been classified as an independent and autocephalous Catholic institution because it is not in communion with the Pope, although it follows Catholic teaching and theology, such as Marian devotions and the recitation of 15 decades of the Rosary. The church is currently headed by Patriarch John Florentine L. Teruel, and formerly with his mother, Maria Virginia Pe√±aflor Leonzon, who was considered as its matriarch and honorary foundress before her death in 2005. The church is based in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines. It has two main shrines: the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity in Sacrifice Valley and the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Rock in Quezon City. Church governance and congregations As an autocephalous church, the Apostolic Catholic Church has two religious orders and congregations: the Order of the Missionaries of the Holy Spirit (OMHS) and the Order of the Missionaries of John Florentine (OMJF). The members of the congregations are the archbishops, bishops, priests, deacons, subdeacons, nuns, and third order members, bound by their evangelical vows of chastity, poverty, obedience, acceptance of their immediate superiors to the Patriarch and to God the Holy Spirit, whom adherents address as Ingkong (an archaic Tagalog honorific often glossed as \\"grandfather\\", used to refer to any elderly man). The lay governing body of the Apostolic Catholic Church is headed by the Parish Pastoral Council, with its own elected officers and committees as the working force of the church. The church is an active member of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines along with other Protestant and non- Roman Catholic churches whose goal is to achieve ecumenism. It is also a member of the Canadian Council of Churches.Canadian Council of Churches Members List The church claims five to eight million members worldwide, although it provides no reliable evidence for these figures. =Patriarchate= The Apostolic Catholic Church is headed by a patriarchate, and is headquartered at the National Shrine of Ina Poon Bato (Our Lady of the Rock). The Apostolic Catholic Church does not accept the authority of the Pope. Beliefs and practices The church adheres to the doctrine of Trinitarianism and has classified itself as a conservative church due to its observance of traditional church attire. Members of the church are expected to show discipline and piety, with youths forbidden to have intimate relationships, and adults prohibited from drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, using illegal drugs, and gambling. =Saints= The Apostolic Catholic Church follows the doctrine of recognizing saints and holy people based on what they have done while still alive. Similar to the Episcopal Church in the Philippines and the Anglican Communion, it recognizes all Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church saints. There is only one saint beatified and canonized by the ACC Patriarchate: St. Maria Virginia Pe√±aflor Leonzon, mother of Patriarch, Dr. John Florentine L. Teruel, PP and the church. She is the honorary foundress of Apostolic Catholic Church and its Cursillo Movement. Having an elevated spiritual life, she was beatified and canonized a saint in 1995 by Patriarch John Florentine. Because of this, St. Maria Virginia P. Leonzon became the first Filipino non-Roman Catholic saint. When she was still alive, St. Maria Virginia was a living saint for all ACC members. She died at the age of 83 in Sacrifice Valley in 2005.

He has organized numerous Body Worlds public exhibitions and occasional live demonstrations of his and his colleagues' work, and has traveled worldwide to promote its educational value. The sourcing of biological specimens for his exhibits has been controversial, but he insists that informed consent was given before death of donors, and extensive documentation of this has been made available. In 2011, he publicly announced that he is dying of Parkinson's disease, and expressed his desire for his body to be plastinated after death and placed on permanent exhibit, possibly simultaneously in multiple locations. Early life and education He was born Gunther Gerhard Liebchen in Alt-Skalden (now called Skalmierzyce) near Ostrowo, Reichsgau Wartheland, in German-annexed Poland. At the age of five days his parents took him on a six-month trek west to escape the imminent Soviet occupation. Gunther grew up in East Germany. The family lived briefly in Berlin and its vicinity, before finally settling in Greiz, a small town where von Hagens remained until age nineteen. A haemophiliac, as a child he spent six months in hospital after being injured. This stimulated an interest in medical science and in 1965 he commenced studies in medicine at the University of Jena. While at the university, von Hagens began to question Communism and Socialism, and widened his knowledge of politics by gathering information from non-communist news sources. He participated in student protests against the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops. In January 1969, disguised as a vacationing student, von Hagens made his way across Bulgaria and Hungary, and on 8 January attempted to cross the Czechoslovakian border into Austria. He failed, but made a second attempt the next day, at another location along the border. He was arrested and punished with two years in jail. Von Hagens emigrated to West Germany in 1970. Hagens continued his medical studies in L√ºbeck and received a doctorate in 1975 from the University of Heidelberg. Career Von Hagens has worked at the University of Heidelberg in the Institutes of Anatomy and Pathology as a lecturer for 22 years . Von Hagens is best known for his plastination technique, which he invented and patented between 1977 to 1982. Subsequently, he developed the technique further, and founded the Institute of Plastination in Heidelberg in 1993. He has been a visiting professor in Dalian China since 1996, where he runs a second plastination institute, and also directs a plastination center at the State Medical Academy in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Since 2004 he is also guest professor at New York University College of Dentistry. For the first 20 years, plastination was used to preserve small specimens for medical study. It was not until the early 1990s that the equipment was developed to make it possible to plastinate whole body specimens, each specimen taking up to 1,500 man-hours to prepare. The first exhibition of whole bodies was displayed in Japan in 1995. Over the next two years, von Hagens developed his first Body Worlds exhibition, showing whole bodies plastinated in lifelike poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy, which has since met with public interest and controversy in more than 50 cities around the world. The exhibition, and von Hagens' subsequent exhibitions Body Worlds 2, 3 and 4, have received more than 26 million visitors all over the world . To produce specimens for a Body Worlds exhibition, von Hagens employs 340 people at five laboratories in four different countries. Each laboratory is categorized by speciality, with the China laboratory focusing on animal specimens. The giraffe which appeared in Body Worlds 3 & The Story of the Heart was one of the most difficult specimens to create. The giraffe took three years to complete10 times longer than it takes to prepare a human body. Ten people were required to move the giraffe because its final weight, like all specimens after plastination, was equal to its original. The Body Worlds exhibits were featured in a supposed Miami exhibition in the 2006 film Casino Royale, although the actual location for the exterior shots was the Ministry of Transport in Prague. Von Hagens himself makes a cameo appearance, and can be seen leading a tour past where James Bond kills a villain. Von Hagens has developed new body sectioning methods that yield very thin slices, which can then be plastinated and used for anatomy studies. He is also developing similar techniques for larger specimens such as an elephant. He works in a concealed laboratory, with an entrance behind a movable staircase, where he developed his wafer plastination techniques.episode on youtube, at 5min 17 sec Controversy Religious groups, including representatives of the Catholic Church and some rabbis, have objected to the display of human remains, stating that it is inconsistent with reverence towards the human body. In 2002 von Hagens performed the first public autopsy in the UK in 170 years, to a sell-out audience of 500 people in a London theatre. Prior to performing the autopsy, von Hagens had received a letter from Her Majesty's Inspector of Anatomy, the British government official responsible for regulating the educational use of cadavers. The letter warned von Hagens that performing a public autopsy would be a criminal act under section 11 of the Anatomy Act 1984. The show was attended by officers from the Metropolitan Police, but they did not intervene and the dissection was performed in full. The autopsy was shown in November 2002 on the UK's Channel 4 television channel; it resulted in over 130 complaints, an OFCOM record, but the Independent Television Commission ruled that the programme had not been sensationalist and had not broken broadcasting rules. In 2003 TV Production Company Mentorn proposed a documentary called Futurehuman in which von Hagens would perform a series of modifications on a corpse to demonstrate \\"improvements\\" to human anatomy. The controversy was sparked when the company, with von Hagens, appealed publicly for a terminally ill person to donate his body for the project. The documentary was cancelled after the body donor pulled out. In February 2004, the German newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung confirmed earlier reports by the German TV station ARD that von Hagens had offered a one-time payment and a lifelong pension to Alexander Sizonenko if he would agree to have his body transferred to the Institute of Plastination after his death. Sizonenko, reported to be one of the world's tallest men at , who formerly played basketball for the Soviet Union and was later plagued by numerous health problems until his death in 2012, declined the offer. After several legal challenges to the Body Worlds exhibit in Germany, in the Summer of 2004 von Hagens announced it would be leaving the country. From 2004 onwards the exhibitions toured North America, returning to Europe in 2007 with an exhibition in Manchester, UK, and ending in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2011. Legal accusations In 2002 there were legal proceedings against a senior pathologist and coroner in Siberia regarding a shipment of 56 corpses to Heidelberg. The police maintained that the Novosibirsk coroner, Vladimir Novosylov, had sold the bodies illegally to buyers outside of Russia. Von Hagens was not charged in the case, but was called as a witness against Novosylov. The authorities stopped the shipment of bodies and the agreement between Novosibirsk and von Hagens was terminated. In October 2003, a parliamentary committee in Kyrgyzstan investigated accusations that von Hagens had illegally received and plastinated several hundred corpses from prisons, psychiatric institutions and hospitals in Kyrgyzstan, some without prior notification of the families. Von Hagens himself testified at the meeting; he said he had received nine corpses from Kyrgyzstan hospitals, none had been used for the Body Worlds exhibition, and that he was neither involved with nor responsible for the notification of families. In 2003, an animal rights organization filed a complaint alleging that von Hagens did not have proper papers for a gorilla he had plastinated. He had received the cadaver from the Hanover Zoo, where the animal had died. In 2003, the University of Heidelberg filed a criminal complaint against von Hagens, claiming that he had misrepresented himself as a professor from a German university in a Chinese document, and that he had failed to state the foreign origin of his title in Germany. After a trial, he received a fine in March 2004. On 25 April 2005, a Heidelberg court imposed a fine of ‚Ç¨108,000 (equivalent to a prison term of 90 days at the daily income assessed by the court) for one count of using an academic title that he was not entitled to, but acquitted him on four other counts. On appeal, a higher court in September 2006 reduced the penalty to a warning with a suspended fine of ‚Ç¨50,000, which under German law is not deemed a prior criminal conviction. In 2007 the charge of title misuse was finally dismissed by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany in Karlsruhe. German prosecutors declined to press charges, and von Hagens was granted an interim injunction against Der Spiegel in March 2005, preventing the magazine from claiming that Body Worlds contain the bodies of executed prisoners. Personal life Von Hagens describes himself as an agnostic, believing that the human mind is not constructed to answer such a question, and he instead puts all his faith into the human body. He is married to Angelina Whalley, the Creative Director of the Body Worlds exhibitions. He has three children from his first marriage and also retains the surname \\"von Hagens\\", which is that of his first wife. When appearing in public, even when performing anatomical dissections, von Hagens always wears a black fedora (a reference to the hat worn in The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt). Von Hagens has said that his grand goal is the founding of a \\"Museum of Man\\" where exhibits of human anatomy can be permanently shown. He is on record as commenting that after death he plans to donate plastinated wafers of his body to several universities, so that in death he can (physically) teach at several locations, something that he cannot do while alive. In January 2011, he announced that he was dying from Parkinson's disease and that after his death his wife would plastinate his body and put his preserved corpse on display as part of the Body Worlds exhibitions.Exhibitor of Bodies Intends to Contribute His Own. New York Times. Published 5 January 2011. Retrieved 5 January 2011. Television appearances In 2005 Channel 4 screened four programmes entitled Anatomy for Beginners, featuring von Hagens and pathology professor John Lee dissecting a number of cadavers and discussing the structure and function of many of the body's parts. A four-part follow-up series entitled Autopsy: Life and Death aired on Channel 4 in 2006, in which von Hagens and Lee discussed common fatal diseases (circulatory issues, cancer, poisoning from organ failure, and ageing) with the aid of dissections. He made a guest appearance in an episode of the 2004 BBC series Regency House Party. In November 2007, another series of 3 programmes was shown entitled Autopsy: Emergency Room, showing what happens when the body is injured, and featuring presentations by the British Red Cross. In 2009 History Channel broadcast a series called Strange Rituals with eleven episodes. The first episode titled Last Rites featured von Hagens and his plastination method to preserve bodies. On Easter Sunday 2012 the UK's Channel 4 showed a programme entitled Crucifixion in which von Hagens created his interpretation of the crucifixion of Jesus. The documentary examined the enduring iconic image of the Crucifix. A number of donors were used for the plastination of blood vessels to create the main structure of the body. At the end of the programme von Hagens announced that he did not expect to see the final work of art due to his ill health.

The college is the fourth-oldest college at the University of Cambridge and one of the wealthiest. The college has been attended by many students who have gone on to significant accomplishment, including fifteen Nobel Prize winners, the second- most of any Oxbridge college (after Trinity College, Cambridge). The college has long historical associations with medical teaching, especially due to its alumni physicians: John Caius (who gave the college the caduceus in its insignia) and William Harvey. Other famous alumni in the sciences include Francis Crick (joint discoverer, along with James Watson, of the structure of DNA), James Chadwick (discoverer of the neutron) and Howard Florey (developer of penicillin). Stephen Hawking, previously Cambridge's Lucasian Chair of Mathematics Emeritus, was a fellow of the college until his death in 2018. The college also maintains reputable academic programmes in many other disciplines, including law, economics, English literature and history. Several streets in the city, such as Harvey Road, Glisson Road and Gresham Road, are named after alumni of the College.Brooke, Christopher A History of Gonville & Caius College (Rochester, 1985), p. 225, n10. The college and its masters have been influential in the development of the university, founding other colleges like Trinity Hall and Darwin College and providing land on the Sidgwick Site, e.g. for the Squire Law Library.  History  Cambridge University, Gonville & Caius College, from King's Parade Gonville & Caius College in David Loggan's 1690 Cantabrigia illustrata The college was first founded, as Gonville Hall, by Edmund Gonville, Rector of Terrington St Clement in Norfolk in 1348, making it the fourth-oldest surviving college. When Gonville died three years later, he left a struggling institution with almost no money. The executor of his will, William Bateman, Bishop of Norwich, stepped in, transferring the college to its current location. He leased himself the land close to the river to set up his own college, Trinity Hall, and renamed Gonville Hall The Hall of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Bateman appointed as the first Master of the new college his former chaplain John Colton, later Archbishop of Armagh. By the sixteenth century, the college had fallen into disrepair, and in 1557 it was refounded by Royal Charter as Gonville & Caius College by the physician John Caius. John Caius was master of the college from 1559 until shortly before his death in 1573. He provided the college with significant funds and greatly extended the buildings. During his time as Master, Caius accepted no payment but insisted on several unusual rules. He insisted that the college admit no scholar who \\"is deformed, dumb, blind, lame, maimed, mutilated, a Welshman, or suffering from any grave or contagious illness, or an invalid, that is sick in a serious measure\\".Brooke, Christopher A History of Gonville & Caius College p. 69‚Äì70, where it is suggested that 'Wallicum' is a scribal error for 'Gallicum' Caius also built a three-sided court, Caius Court, \\"lest the air from being confined within a narrow space should become foul\\". Caius did, however, found the college as a strong centre for the study of medicine, a tradition that it aims to keep to this day. By 1630, the college had expanded greatly, having around 25 fellows and 150 students, but numbers fell over the next century, returning to the 1630 level only in the early nineteenth century. Since then the college has grown considerably and now has one of the largest undergraduate populations in the university. The college first admitted women as fellows and students in 1979. It now has over 110 Fellows, over 700 students and about 200 staff. Gonville & Caius is one of the wealthiest of all Cambridge colleges with an endowment of ¬£221 million in 2018.https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/discover/strategy-and-policies/finance-and- annual-reports The college's present Master, the 43rd, is Pippa Rogerson.  Buildings and grounds = Old Courts = Gonville and Caius Tree Court Interior of the chapel. The Gate of Honour.The first buildings to be erected on the college's current site date from 1353 when Bateman built Gonville Court. The college chapel was added in 1393 with the Old Hall (used until recently as a library) and Master's Lodge following in the next half century. Most of the stone used to build the college came from Ramsey Abbey near Ramsey, Cambridgeshire. Gonville and Caius has the oldest purpose-built college chapel in either Oxford or Cambridge which has been in continuous use as such. The chapel is situated centrally within the college, reflecting the college's religious foundation. On the re-foundation by Caius, the college was expanded and updated. In 1565 the building of Caius Court began, and Caius planted an avenue of trees in what is now known as Tree Court. He was also responsible for the building of the college's three gates, symbolising the path of academic life. On matriculation, one arrives at the Gate of Humility (near the Porters' Lodge). In the centre of the college one passes through the Gate of Virtue regularly. And finally, graduating students pass through the Gate of Honour on their way to the neighbouring Senate House to receive their degrees. The Gate of Honour, at the south side of Caius Court, though the most direct way from the Old Courts to the College Library (Cockerell Building), is only used for special occasions such as graduation. The students of Gonville and Caius commonly refer to the fourth gate in the college, between Tree Court and Gonville Court, which also gives access to some lavatories, as the Gate of Necessity. The buildings of Gonville Court were given classical facades in the 1750s, and the Old Library and the Hall were designed by Anthony Salvin in 1854. On the wall of the Hall hangs a college flag which in 1912 was flown at the South Pole by Cambridge's Edward Adrian Wilson during the famous Terra Nova Expedition of 1910‚Äì1913. Gonville Court, though remodelled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, is the oldest part of the college. New lecture rooms were designed by Alfred Waterhouse and completed by Rattee and Kett in 1884. Interior north-east corner of Waterhouse Building. Tree Court is the largest of the Old Courts. It is so named because John Caius planted an avenue of trees there. Although none of the original trees survive, the court retains a number of trees and the tree-lined avenue, which is unusual for a Cambridge front court. = West Road site = Caius owns a substantial amount of land between West Road and Sidgwick Avenue. Set in landscaped gardens, the modern Harvey Court (named after William Harvey and designed by Leslie Martin) was built on the West Road site in 1961. Adjacent to Harvey Court is the Stephen Hawking Building, which opened its doors to first-year undergraduates in October 2006. Providing ensuite accommodation for 75 students and eight fellows, as well as providing conference facilities in the vacations, the Stephen Hawking Building boasts some of the highest-standard student accommodation in Cambridge. Additional buildings provide housing for older students, a day care, and various study and music rooms. The college also owns extensive gardens and the land on which the adjacent Squire Law Library has stood since 1995. = Library = Caius also has one of the largest libraries in Oxbridge, housed in the Cockerell Building. Caius acquired the lease on the building, which previously housed the Seeley History Library and the Squire Law Library, in the 1990s. The college library was relocated there from Gonville Court in the summer of 1996, following an extensive renovation. = Other courts and college accommodation = College from adjoining Senate House Passage These courts are across Trinity Street on land surrounding St Michael's Church. St Michael's Court was completed only in the 1930s, with the building on its south side of a new building overlooking the Market Place. The college also owns several houses around Cambridge, on Mortimer Road and Gresham Road, where some second year undergraduates live, and on Harvey Road and St Paul's Road, which are occupied by graduate students. = Grounds = The Fellows' garden lies just beyond Harvey Court, on Sidgwick Avenue. The extensive sports fields are located on Barton Road, a few minute's walk from Harvey Court.  Traditions  Communal dinner at Gonville and Caius College Gonville and Caius College maintains many traditions, and is unusual in that it offers two seatings in Hall six nights a week. Typically attended by between 200‚Äì300 students, Hall consists of a three-course meal served after 18:00 (First Hall) or 19:15 (Formal Hall); Formal Hall requires a gown be worn, also seats Fellows at high table, and is preceded by the benediction: Benedic, Domine, nobis et donis tuis quae ex largitate tua sumus sumpturi; et concede ut, ab iis salubriter enutriti, tibi debitum obsequium praestare valeamus, per Jesum Christum dominum nostrum; mensae caelestis nos participes facias, Rex aeternae gloriae.'' As at most Oxbridge colleges, it is tradition that only the Fellows may walk on the grass. The college also enforces the system of \\"exeats\\", or official permissions to leave the college. Students wishing to be absent from college overnight during term time must obtain leave to do so from their tutors, and \\"terminal exeats\\" must be obtained before the end of term.  Student life  Caius Boat Club is the college's boat club, with the men's 1st VIII remaining unbeaten in the seasons of 2010/11 and of 2011/2012, and (as of 2019) is currently in possession of both the Lent and May Bumps headships. Caius Jazz takes place most terms in the college bar, inviting 'some of the most illustrious names in the contemporary scene' and a house band of students studying at London conservatoires to play in the college bar. In recent years Steve Fishwick, Sam Mayne, Ian Shaw, Barry Green, Gareth Lockrane, and Paul Jarvis have all been featured. The Caius May Ball is an all-night party in June, held every two years. = Choir = The choir was founded by the composer Charles Wood in the late nineteenth century, and was most recently directed by the scholar of South-American choral music, Geoffrey Webber until his resignation in 2019. The choir tours abroad and records eclectically. The choir is made up from Scholars and Exhibitioners from the college, and a few volunteers from other colleges. = JCR= The college currently has a GCSU (Gonville and Caius Student Union).

The head of the Admiralty (Chef der Admiralit√§t) administered the Imperial Navy under the authority of the imperial chancellor and the supreme command of the Emperor (Kaiserliche Kommandogewalt). It lasted until 1889, undergoing several reorganizations, but proved an impractical arrangement given the constant growth and the expansion of the Imperial Navy. Finally it was abolished in April 1889 and its duties divided among three new entities: German Imperial Naval High Command (Kaiserliches Oberkommando der Marine), the Imperial Naval Office (Reichsmarineamt), and the Imperial Naval Cabinet (Kaiserliches Marinekabinett).

It has the distinction of being the heaviest element commonly needed by living organisms as well as the second-heaviest known to be used by any form of life (only tungsten, a component of a few bacterial enzymes, has a higher atomic number and atomic weight). It is a component of biochemical pathways in organisms from all biological kingdoms, suggesting its fundamental significance throughout the evolutionary history of life. Iodine is critical to the proper functioning of the vertebrate endocrine system, and plays smaller roles in numerous other organs, including those of the digestive and reproductive systems. An adequate intake of iodine-containing compounds is important at all stages of development, especially during the fetal and neonatal periods, and diets deficient in iodine can present serious consequences for growth and metabolism. Functions=Thyroid= In vertebrate biology, iodine's primary function is as a constituent of the thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These molecules are made from addition-condensation products of the amino acid tyrosine, and are stored prior to release in an iodine-containing protein called thyroglobulin. T4 and T3 contain four and three atoms of iodine per molecule, respectively; iodine accounts for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. The thyroid gland actively absorbs iodine from the blood to produce and release these hormones into the blood, actions which are regulated by a second hormone, called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland. Thyroid hormones are phylogenetically very old molecules which are synthesized by most multicellular organisms, and which even have some effect on unicellular organisms. Thyroid hormones play a fundamental role in biology, acting upon gene transcription mechanisms to regulate the basal metabolic rate. T3 acts on small intestine cells and adipocytes to increase carbohydrate absorption and fatty acid release, respectively. A deficiency of thyroid hormones can reduce basal metabolic rate up to 50%, while an excessive production of thyroid hormones can increase the basal metabolic rate by 100%. T4 acts largely as a precursor to T3, which is (with minor exceptions) the biologically active hormone. Via the thyroid hormones, iodine has a nutritional relationship with selenium. A family of selenium-dependent enzymes called deiodinases converts T4 to T3 (the active hormone) by removing an iodine atom from the outer tyrosine ring. These enzymes also convert T4 to reverse T3 (rT3) by removing an inner ring iodine atom, and also convert T3 to 3,3'-Diiodothyronine (T2) by removing an inner ring atom. Both of the latter products are inactivated hormones which have essentially no biological effects and are quickly prepared for disposal. A family of non-selenium-dependent enzymes then further deiodinates the products of these reactions. In truth, the total amount of iodine in the human body is still controversial, and in 2001, M.T. Hays published in Thyroid that ‚Äúit is surprising that the total iodine content of the human body remains uncertain after many years of interest in iodine metabolism. Only the iodine content of the thyroid gland has been measured accurately by fluorescent scanning, and it is now well estimate of 5‚Äì15 mg in the normal human thyroid. But similar methods are not available for other tissues and for the extrathyroidal organs. Many researchers reported different numbers of 10 -50 mg of the total iodine content in human body \\" . Selenium also plays a very important role in the production of glutathione, the body's most powerful antioxidant. During the production of the thyroid hormones, hydrogen peroxide is produced in large quantities, and therefore high iodine in the absence of selenium can destroy the thyroid gland (often described as a sore throat feeling); the peroxides are neutralized through the production of glutathione from selenium. In turn, an excess of selenium increases demand for iodine, and deficiency will result when a diet is high in selenium and low in iodine. =Extrathyroidal iodine= Sequence of 123-iodide human scintiscans after an intravenous injection, (from left) after 30 minutes, 20 hours, and 48 hours. A high and rapid concentration of radio-iodide is evident in extrathyroidal organs like cerebrospinal fluid (left), gastric and oral mucosa, salivary glands, arterial walls, ovary and thymus. In the thyroid gland, I-concentration is more progressive, as in a reservoir (from 1% after 30 minutes, and after 6, 20 h, to 5.8% after 48 hours, of the total injected dose).A pheochromocytoma tumor is seen as a dark sphere in the center of the body (it is in the left adrenal gland). The image is by MIBG scintigraphy, showing the tumor by radiation from radioiodine in the MIBG. Two images are seen of the same patient from front and back. The image of the thyroid in the neck is due to unwanted uptake of radioiodine from a radioactive iodine- containing medication by the thyroid gland in the neck. Accumulation at the sides of the head is from salivary gland uptake of iodide. Radioactivity is also seen from uptake by the liver, and excretion and accumulation in the bladder. Extra-thyroidal iodine exists in several other organs, including the mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, cervix, cerebrospinal fluid, arterial walls, ovary and salivary glands . In the cells of these tissues the iodide ion (I‚àí) enters directly by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Different tissue responses for iodine and iodide occur in the mammary glands and the thyroid gland of rats. The role of iodine in mammary tissue is related to fetal and neonatal development, but its role in the other tissues is not well known. It has been shown to act as an antioxidant and antiproliferant in various tissues that can uptake iodine. Molecular iodine (I2) has been shown to have a suppressive effect on benign and cancerous neoplasias. The U.S. Food and Nutrition Board and Institute of Medicine recommended daily allowance of iodine ranges from 150 micrograms per day for adult humans to 290 micrograms per day for lactating mothers. However, the thyroid gland needs no more than 70 micrograms per day to synthesize the requisite daily amounts of T4 and T3. The higher recommended daily allowance levels of iodine seem necessary for optimal function of a number of other body systems, including lactating breasts, gastric mucosa, salivary glands, oral mucosa, arterial walls, thymus, epidermis, choroid plexus and cerebrospinal fluid, among others. =Other functions= Iodine and thyroxine have also been shown to stimulate the spectacular apoptosis of the cells of the larval gills, tail and fins during metamorphosis in amphibians, as well as the transformation of their nervous system from that of the aquatic, herbivorous tadpole into that of the terrestrial, carnivorous adult. The frog species Xenopus laevis has proven to be an ideal model organism for experimental study of the mechanisms of apoptosis and the role of iodine in developmental biology. Moreover, iodine can add to double bonds of docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid of cellular membranes, making them less reactive to free oxygen radicals. Dietary recommendations The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for iodine in 2000. For people age 14 and up, the iodine RDA is 150 Œºg/day; the RDA for pregnant women is 220 Œºg/day and the RDA during lactation is 290 Œºg/day. For children 1‚Äì8 years, the RDA is 90 Œºg/day; for children 8‚Äì13 years, 130 Œºg/day. As a safety consideration, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. The UL for iodine for adults is 1,100 Œºg/day. This UL was assessed by analyzing the effect of supplementation on thyroid-stimulating hormone. Collectively, the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR; AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For women and men ages 18 and older, the PRI for iodine is set at 150 Œºg/day; the PRI during pregnancy or lactation is 200 Œºg/day. For children ages 1‚Äì17 years, the PRI increases with age from 90 to 130 Œºg/day. These PRIs are comparable to the U.S. RDAs with the exception of that for lactation. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and set its adult UL at 600 Œºg/day, which is a bit more than half the U.S. value. Notably, Japan reduced its adult iodine UL from 3,000 to 2,200 ¬µg/day in 2010, but then increased it back to 3,000 ¬µg/day in 2015.Overview of Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2015) Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan url = http://www.mhlw.go.jp/file/06-Seisakujouhou-10900000-Kenkoukyoku/Overview.pdf For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For iodine specifically, 100% of the Daily Value is considered 150 Œºg, and this figure remained at 150 Œºg in the May 27, 2016 revision. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by 1 January 2020, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and by 1 January 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. During the first six months following the 1 January 2020 compliance date, the FDA plans to work cooperatively with manufacturers to meet the new Nutrition Facts label requirements and will not focus on enforcement actions regarding these requirements during that time. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. As of 2000, the median observed intake of iodine from food in the United States was 240 to 300 Œºg/day for men and 190 to 210 Œºg/day for women. In Japan, consumption is much higher due to the frequent consumption of seaweed or kombu kelp. The average daily intake in Japan ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 Œºg/day; previous estimates suggested an average intake as high as 13,000 Œºg/day. =Food sources= Natural sources of iodine include many marine organisms, such as kelp and certain seafood products, as well as plants grown on iodine-rich soil. Iodized salt is fortified with iodine. According to a Food Fortification Initiative 2016 report, 130 countries have mandatory iodine fortification of salt and an additional 10 have voluntary fortification. Deficiency Worldwide, iodine deficiency affects two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Mental disability is a result which occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of dietary iodine (new hypothyroidism in adults may cause temporary mental slowing, but not permanent damage). In areas where there is little iodine in the diet, typically remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency also gives rise to hypothyroidism, the most serious symptoms of which are epidemic goitre (swelling of the thyroid gland), extreme fatigue, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. The addition of iodine to table salt (so-called iodized salt) has largely eliminated the most severe consequences of iodine deficiency in wealthier nations, but deficiency remains a serious public health problem in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe; in Germany, an estimated one billion dollars in healthcare costs is spent each year in combating and treating iodine deficiency. =Iodine and cancer risk = Source: * Breast cancer. The mammary gland actively concentrates iodine into milk for the benefit of the developing infant, and may develop a goiter-like hyperplasia, sometimes manifesting as fibrocystic breast disease, when iodine level is low. Studies indicate that iodine deficiency, either dietary or pharmacologic, can lead to breast atypia and increased incidence of malignancy in animal models, while iodine treatment can reverse dysplasia, with elemental iodine (I2) having been found to be more effective in reducing ductal hyperplasias and perilobular fibrosis in iodine- deficient rats than iodide (I‚àí). On the observation that Japanese women who consume iodine-rich seaweed have a relatively low rate of breast cancer, iodine is suggested as a protection against breast cancer. Iodine is known to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Laboratory evidence has demonstrated an effect of iodine on breast cancer that is in part independent of thyroid function, with iodine inhibiting cancer through modulation of the estrogen pathway. Gene array profiling of the estrogen responsive breast cancer cell line shows that the combination of iodine and iodide alters gene expression and inhibits the estrogen response through up-regulating proteins involved in estrogen metabolism. Whether iodine/iodide will be useful as an adjuvant therapy in the pharmacologic manipulation of the estrogen pathway in women with breast cancer has not been determined clinically. * Gastric cancer. Some researchers have found an epidemiologic correlation between iodine deficiency, iodine-deficient goitre, and gastric cancer;. a decrease in the death incidence from stomach cancer after iodine-prophylaxis. In the proposed mechanism, the iodide ion functions in gastric mucosa as an antioxidant reducing species that detoxifies poisonous reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide. Precautions and toxicity=Elemental Iodine= Elemental iodine is an oxidizing irritant, and direct contact with skin can cause lesions, so iodine crystals should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration such as tincture of iodine are capable of causing tissue damage if use for cleaning and antisepsis is prolonged. Although elemental iodine is used in the formulation of Lugol's solution, a common medical disinfectant, it becomes triiodide upon reacting with the potassium iodide used in the solution and is therefore non-toxic. Only a small amount of elemental iodine will dissolve in water, and adding potassium iodide allows a much larger amount of elemental iodine to dissolve through the reaction of I2-I3. This allows Lugol's iodine to be produced in strengths varying from 2% to 15% iodine. Elemental iodine (I2) is poisonous if taken orally in large amounts; 2‚Äì3 grams is a lethal dose for an adult human. Potassium iodide, on the other hand, has a median lethal dose (LD50) that is relatively high in several other animals: in rabbits, it is 10 g/kg; in rats, 14 g/kg, and in mice, 22 g/kg. The tolerable upper intake level for iodine as established by the Food and Nutrition Board is 1,100 ¬µg/day for adults. The safe upper limit of consumption set by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan is 3,000 ¬µg/day. The biological half-life of iodine differs between the various organs of the body, from 100 days in the thyroid, to 14 days in the kidneys and spleen, to 7 days in the reproductive organs. Typically the daily urinary elimination rate ranges from 100 to 200 ¬µg/L in humans.World Health Organization (2007). United Nations Children's Fund & International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders. Assessment of iodine deficiency disorders and monitoring their elimination . 3rd ed. However, the Japanese diet, high in iodine-rich kelp, contains 1,000 to 3,000 ¬µg of iodine per day, and research indicates the body can readily eliminate excess iodine that is not needed for thyroid hormone production. The literature reports as much as 30,000 ¬µg/L (30 mg/L) of iodine being safely excreted in the urine in a single day, with levels returning to the standard range in a couple of days, depending on seaweed intake. One study concluded the range of total body iodine content in males was 12.1 mg to 25.3 mg, with a mean of 14.6 mg. It is presumed that once thyroid-stimulating hormone is suppressed, the body simply eliminates excess iodine, and as a result, long- term supplementation with high doses of iodine has no additional effect once the body is replete with enough iodine. It is unknown if the thyroid gland is the rate-limiting factor in generating thyroid hormone from iodine and tyrosine, but assuming it is not, a short-term loading dose of one or two weeks at the tolerable upper intake level may quickly restore thyroid function in iodine-deficient patients. Iodine vapor is very irritating to the eye, to mucous membranes, and in the respiratory tract. Concentration of iodine in the air should not exceed 1 mg/m3 (eight-hour time-weighted average). When mixed with ammonia and water, elemental iodine forms nitrogen triiodide, which is extremely shock-sensitive and can explode unexpectedly. =Iodide ion= Excessive iodine intake presents symptoms similar to those of iodine deficiency. Commonly encountered symptoms are abnormal growth of the thyroid gland and disorders in functioning, as well as in growth of the organism as a whole. Iodide toxicity is similar to (but not the same as) toxicity to ions of the other halogens, such as bromides or fluorides. Excess bromine and fluorine can prevent successful iodine uptake, storage and use in organisms, as both elements can selectively replace iodine biochemically. Excess iodine may also be more cytotoxic in combination with selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is theoretically problematic, partly for this reason. Selenocysteine (abbreviated as Sec or U, in older publications also as Se-Cys) is the 21st proteinogenic amino acid, and is the root of iodide ion toxicity when there is a simultaneous insufficiency of biologically available selenium. Selenocysteine exists naturally in all kingdoms of life as a building block of selenoproteins. =Hypersensitivity reactions to iodine-containing compounds= Some people develop a hypersensitivity to compounds of iodine but there are no known cases of people being directly allergic to elemental iodine itself. Notable sensitivity reactions that have been observed in humans include: * The application of tincture of iodine may cause a rash. * Some cases of reaction to povidone-iodine (Betadine) have been documented to be a chemical burn. * Eating iodine-containing foods, especially seafood products such as shellfish, may cause hives. Medical use of iodine compounds (i.e. as a contrast agent) can cause anaphylactic shock in highly sensitive patients, presumably due to sensitivity to the chemical carrier. Cases of sensitivity to iodine compounds should not be formally classified as iodine allergies, as this perpetuates the erroneous belief that it is the iodine to which patients react, rather than to the specific allergen. Sensitivity to iodine-containing compounds is rare but has a considerable effect given the extremely widespread use of iodine-based contrast media..

In Ireland, beginning in the 1990s, a series of criminal cases and Irish government enquiries established that hundreds of priests had abused thousands of children over decades. Six reports by the former National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church established that six Irish priests had been convicted between 1975 and 2011. This has contributed to the secularisation of Ireland and to the decline in influence of the Catholic Church. Ireland held a referendum to legalise same- sex marriage in 2015 and abortion rights in 2018. Like the Catholic Church sex abuse cases in the United States and elsewhere, the abuse in Ireland included cases of high-profile, supposedly celibate Catholic clerics involved in illicit heterosexual relations as well as widespread physical abuse of children in the Catholic-run childcare network. In many cases, the abusing priests were moved to other parishes to avoid embarrassment or a scandal, assisted by senior clergy. By 2010 a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with only a limited number of criminal convictions. In March 2010, Pope Benedict XVI wrote a pastoral letter of apology for all of the abuse that had been carried out by Catholic clergy in Ireland. On 31 May 2010, Benedict established a formal panel to investigate the sex abuse scandal, saying that it could serve as a healing mechanism for the country and its Catholics. Among the nine members of the apostolic visitation were Cardinal Se√°n Patrick O'Malley, the Archbishop of Boston (he investigated the Archdiocese of Dublin); Cardinal Timothy Michael Dolan, the Archbishop of New York (he investigated the issue of proper priestly formation and visited the seminaries); two nuns (who investigated women's religious institutes and the formation there), Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the Archbishop Emeritus of Westminster, England; Archbishop Terrence Thomas Prendergast of Ottawa, Canada; and Cardinal-Archbishop Thomas Christopher Collins of Toronto, Canada. In August 2018, a list was published revealing that over 1,300 Catholics in Ireland were accused of sexual abuse and 82 of them were convicted. Early revelations of sexual misconduct The accepted norm in the Irish Church was that its priesthood was celibate and chaste, and homosexuality was both a sin and a crime. The Church forbade its members (the \\"faithful\\") to use artificial contraception, campaigned strongly against laws allowing abortion and divorce, and publicly disapproved of unmarried cohabiting couples and illegitimacy. Therefore, it came as a considerable surprise when the Irish media started to report allegations of lapses in these aspects of the priesthood itself. The Church's high stated standards had also led on in part to the Ann Lovett tragedy and the Kerry Babies case in 1984. A series of television documentaries in the 1990s and 2000s, such as \\"Suffer the children\\" (UTV, 1994),MOORE, Chris, \\"Betrayal of Trust: The Father Brendan Smyth Affair and the Catholic Church\\"; Marino 1995, ; the producer's book about the programme's content Suing the Pope or The Magdalene Sisters, led on to the need for a series of government-sponsored reports and new guidelines within the Church and society to better protect children. In 1995‚Äì2002 the emergence of the same problem in the USA led to the view that the Church had attempted to cover up abuse and misconduct, and was not limited to sexual abuse (see Catholic sex abuse cases in the United States). By the late 2000s the misconduct was recognised as a worldwide scandal. =Miche√°l Ledwith= In 1984, a group of seminarians in the 'senior division' of St Patrick's Seminary, Maynooth, expressed their concerns to the senior dean regarding the inappropriate behaviour of Miche√°l Ledwith, then vice-president of the College, towards younger students. Ledwith was promoted to President of St Patrick's Seminary despite the allegations. He subsequently resigned as President in 1994 when allegations of sexual abuse resurfaced. In June 2002, the bishops commissioned Denis McCullough to investigate allegations reported in The Irish Times that the bishops had not responded adequately to complaints of sexual harassment of seminarians at Maynooth College in the early 1980s. McCullough's report, published on 16 June 2005, found that, while the seminarians had not complained directly to the bishops regarding Ledwith's alleged sexual abuse, \\"concerns of apparent propensities rather than accusations of actual crime or specific offences\\" had been communicated to the bishops by the senior dean of the college. McCullough concluded \\"that to have rejected the senior dean's concerns so completely and so abruptly without any adequate investigation may have been too precipitate, although, of course, to investigate, in any very full or substantial manner, a generic complaint regarding a person's apparent propensities would have been difficult\\". =Brendan Smyth= One of the most widely known cases of sexual abuse in Ireland involved Brendan Smyth, who, between 1945 and 1989, sexually abused and assaulted 20 children in parishes in Belfast, Dublin and the United States. The investigation of the Smyth case was allegedly obstructed by the Norbertine Order. He was arrested in 1995; however, Ireland's Attorney General did not immediately comply with a request from the Royal Ulster Constabulary for Smyth's extradition. The ensuing controversy over the delay led to the collapse of the Fianna F√°il/Labour coalition government.Escholarship.bc.edu As of early May 2012 Cardinal Se√°n Brady was under pressure to resign because as a part of a church investigation into Smyth he only reported the information he gleaned to church authorities and not to the police. The church's subsequent failure to deal with Smyth gave him the opportunity to abuse more children. Brady only resigned when required to do so by canon law upon turning 75 in September 2014. Abuse in the state childcare system In the 1990s, a series of television programs publicised allegations of systemic abuse in Ireland's Roman Catholic-run childcare system, primarily in the Reformatory and Industrial Schools. The abuse occurred primarily between the 1930s and 1970s. These documentaries included \\"Dear Daughter\\", \\"Washing Away the Stain\\" and \\"Witness: Sex in a Cold Climate and Sinners\\". These programs interviewed adult victims of abuse who provided \\"testimony of their experiences, they documented Church and State collusion in the operation of these institutions, and they underscored the climate of secrecy and denial that permeated the church response when faced with controversial accusations.\\" The topic was also covered by American broadcast media. Programs such as CBS's 60 Minutes and ABC's 20/20 produced segments on the subject for an Irish-American audience. In 1999, a documentary film series titled States of Fear detailed abuse suffered by Irish children between the 1930s and 1970s in the state childcare system, primarily in the Reformatory and Industrial Schools. Response of the Irish government to the scandal In response to the furore aroused by the media reports, the Irish government commissioned a study which took nine years to complete. On 20 May 2009, the commission released its 2600-page report, which drew on testimony from thousands of former inmates and officials from more than 250 church-run institutions. The commission found that Catholic priests and nuns had terrorised thousands of boys and girls for decades and that government inspectors had failed to stop the chronic beatings, rapes and humiliation. The report characterised rape and molestation as \\"endemic\\" in Irish Catholic church-run Industrial Schools and orphanages. Response of the Church to the scandals In February 2002, 18 religious institutes agreed to provide more than ‚Ç¨128 million in compensation to the victims of child abuse. In 2005 the Church published an Instruction Concerning the Criteria for the Discernment of Vocations with regard to Persons with Homosexual Tendencies in view of their Admission to the Seminary and to Holy Orders. In 2006 the Church set up the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland (NBSC) to suggest ways to safeguard children and improve policy, and to monitor practices and observance of policy. In 2008 the Health Service Executive had required a child safety audit which the Bishops felt unable to co-operate with for legal reasons, and in 2009 they asked the NBSC to perform this role. In its report of 2010‚ÄìMarch 2011 the NBSC complained that it had also been denied the same information, also for legal reasons, and that Church funding for its training programmes in child protection had ended in 2009. The 2010‚Äì11 report listed 272 new allegations of abuse, mainly \\"of a historical nature\\", up from 197 allegations in its 2009‚Äì10 report. Brendan Comiskey In March 2002, a BBC documentary, titled Suing the Pope, highlighted the case of Se√°n Fortune, one of the most notorious clerical sex offenders. The film followed Colm O'Gorman as he investigated the story of how Fortune was allowed to abuse him and countless other teenage boys.Suing the Pope BBC News The Church's practice of parish transfers of abusive priests allowed Fortune to be transferred to other parishes without notifying them about any former abuse allegations. On 1 April 2002, Brendan Comiskey, Bishop of Ferns, resigned over charges that he had failed to deal adequately with allegations that Fortune and others were sexually abusing children. Desmond Connell In October 2002, Ireland's national broadcasting station, Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann, or RTE, aired a television documentary titled Primetime: Cardinal Secrets which charged Dublin's Cardinal Desmond Connell with mishandling the sex abuse scandal and accusing him of participating in a deliberate cover-up of facts. Connell retired as archbishop on 26 April 2004. The Murphy Report found that Connell had handled the affair \\"badly\\" as he was \\"slow to recognise the seriousness of the situation\\". It did praise him for making the archdiocesan records available to the authorities in 2002 and for his 1995 actions in giving the authorities the names of 17 priests who had been accused of abuse, although it said the list was incomplete as complaints were made against at least 28 priests in the Archdiocese. He was criticised for being \\"economical with the truth\\" in his useMurphy Report, Page 643 of the concept of mental reservation to inadequately answer questions truthfullyCardinal Connell explained the concept of mental reservation to the Commission in the following way: \\"Well, the general teaching about mental reservation is that you are not permitted to tell a lie. On the other hand, you may be put in a position where you have to answer, and there may be circumstances in which you can use an ambiguous expression realising that the person who you are talking to will accept an untrue version of whatever it may be ‚Äì permitting that to happen, not willing that it happened, that would be lying. It really is a matter of trying to deal with extraordinarily difficult matters that may arise in social relations where people may ask questions that you simply cannot answer. Everybody knows that this kind of thing is liable to happen. So, mental reservation is, in a sense, a way of answering without lying\\". about his knowledge of the abusive activities of priests under his control. Ferns Report The Ferns Inquiry (2005) was an official Irish government inquiry into the allegations of clerical sexual abuse in the Irish Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns. The investigation was established in the wake of the broadcast of the BBC Television documentary \\"Suing the Pope\\". O'Gorman, through One in Four, the organisation he founded to support women and men who have experienced sexual violence, successfully campaigned for the Ferns Inquiry. The Ferns Inquiry recorded its revulsion at the extent, severity and duration of the child sexual abuse allegedly perpetrated on children by priests acting under the aegis of the Diocese of Ferns. Irish Child Abuse Commission 2009 A lengthy report detailing cases of emotional, physical and sexual abuse of thousands of children over 70 years was published on 20 May 2009. The report drew on the testimony of nearly 2,000 witnesses, men and women who attended more than 200 Catholic-run schools from the 1930s until the 1990s. As per 2002 agreement between the victims on one side and the Roman Catholic brothers and Irish government on other side, all those who accepted the state/Brothers settlements had to waive their right to sue both the church and the government. Their abusers' identities are also kept secret. =Response of government= Ireland's national police force announced that they would study the report to see if it provided any new evidence for prosecuting clerics for assault, rape or other criminal offences. The report, however, did not identify any abusers by name because of a right-to-privacy lawsuit by the Christian Brothers. Shamed by the extent, length, and cruelty of child abuse, Ireland's former Prime Minister Brian Cowen apologised to victims for the government's failure to intervene in endemic sexual abuse and severe beatings in schools for much of the 20th century. He also promised to reform the Ireland's social services for children in line with the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse report.\\"Shamed by child abuse, Ireland to reform services\\" Reuters, 26 May 2009 Further motions to start criminal investigation against members of Roman Catholic religious institutes in Ireland were made by Irish President Mary McAleese and Prime Minister Cowen\\"Irish Church Abusers Should Face Law, McAleese Says\\" Bloomberg, 30 May 2009 =Response of the bishops= The highest-ranked official of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, Dublin Archbishop Diarmuid Martin slammed Irish Catholic orders for concealing their culpability in decades of child abuse, and said they needed to come up with much more money to compensate victims. At the conclusion of its summer meeting, the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference said that the abuse of children in institutions run by Catholic priests and nuns was part of a culture that was prevalent in the Catholic Church in Ireland. The bishops spent a major portion of their 8‚Äì10 June meeting discussing a report from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, published 20 May under chairman Sean Ryan. The commission found that church institutions failed to prevent an extensive level of sexual, physical and emotional abuse and neglect. In a joint statement, the bishops said that, \\"the Ryan report represents the most recent disturbing indictment of a culture that was prevalent in the Catholic Church in Ireland for far too long. Heinous crimes were perpetrated against the most innocent and vulnerable, and vile acts with life-lasting effects were carried out under the guise of the mission of Jesus Christ. This abuse represents a serious betrayal of the trust which was placed in the church.\\" Cardinal Se√°n Brady expressed remorse on behalf of the church and the religious saying \\"we are ashamed, humbled and repentant that our people strayed so far from their Christian ideals, for this we ask forgiveness.\\" The abuses were the result of \\"a culture that was prevalent in the Catholic Church in Ireland for far too long\\", said Brady. The bishops offered four immediate responses to address the issues raised in the report: * Sadness over the \\"suffering of so many for so long.\\" * An invitation to survivors to \\"engage with us\\" in an effort to understand how to assist the victims of abuse. * The intention to respond as pastors \\"despite the inadequacies at times of our previous pastoral responses.\\" * Praying for the \\"well being and peace of mind for all who suffered\\" and urging all Catholics to join them in prayer. =Response by religious institutes= In 2011, abbot of Glenstal Abbey and Benedictine monk Dom Mark Patrick Hederman, OSB, was quoted by novelist and writer Russell Shorto speaking about the Church making \\"this island [Ireland] into a concentration camp where [the Church] could control everything. ... And the control was really all about sex. ... It's not difficult to understand how the whole system became riddled with what we now call a scandal but in fact was a complete culture.\\"Shorto, Russell, \\"The Irish Affliction\\", The New York Times Magazine, 9 February 2011 (13 February 2011 p. MM42). Retrieved 15 February 2011. Tony Walsh In December 2010, Archdiocese of Dublin \\"singing priest\\" Tony Walsh was sentenced to 123 years in prison for 14 child abuse convictions involving sex-related offences dating from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s. However, the sentences were to be served concurrently, netting to a maximum of 16 years. By the time he pled guilty in December 2018 to indecently assaulting a teenage boy with a crucifix on a date in 1983, Walsh had already been in prison for 13 years. Summary of diocesan sexual abuse inquiries=Archdiocese of Armagh= *Fr. Andrew Allen pled guilty in 1993 to molesting two boys in Trinidad and Tobago between 1981 and 1985 and was given a two-year suspended prison sentence and a ¬£150,000 fine.

The same year, he was also convicted of molesting an altar boy in Drogheda between 1991 and 1992 and was given a one- year prison sentence. *Br. Francis Patrick Mallon was sentenced in May 1994 to three months in prison for abusing three girls on the grounds of the Servite Priory at Benburb, Co Tyrone. *Fr. Michael Gerard McQuillan was convicted in 2004 of 40 counts of sexual abuse involving five children, four boys and a girl who was the sister of one of the boys. McQuillan met the children when he was the chaplain at a school in County Armagh. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Diocese of Connor and Down *Fr. Daniel Curran received a seven-year jail sentence in 1995 after admitting sex offences on nine young boys; given an 18-month suspended sentence in 2005 for indecently assaulting a 10th boy in the 1980s; in 2006 he received a 14-month sentence after pleading guilty to five counts of indecent assault on a boy between 1977 and 1982. *Fr. Joseph M. Steele pled guilty in 1996 to multiple charges involving the indecent assaults of three girls and two boys between 1969 and 1983 and served two and a half years in prison. He pled guilty to five counts of indecent assault and two of gross indecency against a boy and three counts of indecently assaulting a female victim between 1967 and 1983. He died in 2012 while awaiting his sentence for these other convictions =Archdiocese of Dublin= Fr. Paul McGennis abused M Collins when she was in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in 1961, when she was 13. In November 2009, an independent report commissioned by the Irish government investigated the way in which the church dealt with allegations of sexual abuse of children by priests over the period 1975 to 2004. It concluded that \\"the Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid-1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets. All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities. The Archdiocese did not implement its own canon law rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the State.\\" =Diocese of FernsArchdiocese of Tuam= Fr. Joseph Summerville pled guilty in 1996 to four of the 15 charges against him. He admitted indecently assaulting an adolescent boy during the years 1988 and 1989, while he was a boarding school chaplain at St. Jarlath's College, Tuam and was given a four year prison sentence. A judge later imposed an additional one-year sentence after learning the details of his grooming another victim, a 15-year-old boy, in a parochial house. Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora diocese An eight-year (1999‚Äì2007) enquiry and report by Dr. Elizabeth Healy and Dr. Kevin McCoy into the Brothers of Charity Congregation's \\"Holy Family School\\" in Galway, the major city of the archdiocese, and two other locations was made public in December 2007. Eleven brothers and seven other staff members were alleged to have abused 121 intellectually disabled children in residential care in the period 1965‚Äì1998. A review that was published on 30 November 2011, into the handling of clerical child sex abuse allegations in the Diocese of Tuam has praised Archbishop Neary for his actions. The report said serious harm was done to children by a few priests of the archdiocese but Dr Neary met allegations \\"with a steadily serious approach, taking appropriate action under existing guidelines, and rapidly assimilating the lesson of the necessity for the removal of the priest, where there is a credible allegation, pending investigation.‚Äù The report said it is clear from the \\"excellent records\\" that a genuine effort was made to gather evidence from victims and their families during the Church inquiry stage and such \\"thoroughness is to be commended\\". The report added that \\"It is also a fair reflection to say that the archbishop has met resistance in asking a priest to step aside from public ministry. It is to his credit that in spite of opposition, Archbishop Neary has maintained his authority and kept some men out of ministry where there is evidence to suggest that they should be viewed as dangerous and should not have access to young people.\\" Neary said \\"This is an enormous tribute to all working in this area. It is very encouraging to see that their work has been recognised, affirmed and appreciated in the report.\\" =Diocese of Cloyne= In 2008, bishop John Magee found himself at the centre of a controversy surrounding his mishandling of child sex abuse cases in the diocese of Cloyne. On 7 March 2009 Pope Benedict XVI appointed Archbishop Dermot Clifford of Cashel and Emly as apostolic administrator of the Cloyne diocese, though Magee remains Bishop in title.\\"Bishop Magee steps aside over Cloyne controversy\\", Eoin Burke-Kennedy, The Irish Times, 7 March 2009, retrieved 9 March 2009 Bishop Magee requested that the Pope take this action on 4 February. Magee said that he would use the time to \\"devote the necessary time and energy to cooperating fully with the government Commission of Inquiry into child protection practices and procedures in the diocese of Cloyne\\". On 24 March 2010 it was announced by the Holy See that Bishop Magee had formally resigned from his duties as Bishop of Cloyne and was now bishop emeritus.Press Office of the Holy See A report by a judicial inquiry into diocesan reporting and oversight of alleged abusers was published in July 2011. =Diocese of Raphoe= Prior to being appointed Bishop of Derry, where he served between 1994‚Äì2011, S√©amus Hegarty was Bishop of the Diocese of Raphoe in 1982‚Äì1994, at a time when one of his priests, Father Eugene Greene, raped 26 young men. Hegarty's replacement Bishop Boyce, and the Irish hierarchy, criticised a 2011 media article that claimed that \\"There were hundreds and hundreds of victims, and they were abused again and again while the church actively prevented investigations by the civil authorities\\". Greene was later arrested in 1999 and sentenced the next year to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty to 40 of the 115 charges he was facing. He was released from prison in 2008 after serving 9 years of his sentence. Between January and November 2011, four Diocese of Raphoe priests who were accused of committing sex abuse were convicted. =Diocese of Limerick=Abuse by religious orders As well as the diocesan clergy, a number of Irish members of Roman Catholic religious institutes have been named in criminal prosecutions for abuse; some were tried outside Ireland. These cases amplify, but were not covered by, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse findings (see above). Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland In May 2020, it was revealed that prior to the 2004 merger with the Scout Association of Ireland (SAI) which formed Scouting Ireland, the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland (CBSI) covered up sex abuse committed by people who served in the organization. In a period spanning decades, both the CBSI and SAI shielded 275 known or suspected predators who abused children after becoming aware of the reported acts of abuse. Scouting Ireland backed the findings of the report and issued an apology. Other cases As well the reports, many other victims of clerical abuse came forward with their own stories; including actor Gabriel Byrne and Derry Morgan.Sunday Independent, 27 December 2009, p.14. In each case the victim was told to keep quiet, and the priest involved was usually admired by the victim's family; this made it difficult for victims to speak out, adding long-term psychological injury to the abuse itself. In 2010 Fr. Patrick Hughes was convicted on four counts of indecent assault.\\"Former priest who sexually abused boy jailed for one year\\", The Irish Times, 3 February 2010, retrieved 4 February 2010 Detective Sergeant Joseph McLoughlin said that the Garda S√≠och√°na were \\"getting the run-around from church authorities\\". Investigations continue where Irish abusers were sent abroad by the church to other countries, where they abused other children. The spectacular conviction of Nora Wall was found to be based on evidence from unreliable witnesses who admitted to lying. Alleged abuses by Irish missionary priests On 23 May 2011 RT√â broadcast \\"A Mission to Prey\\", concerning alleged abuses by missionary priests against young people in Africa. It has since emerged that one of the allegations against Fr. Kevin Reynolds, fathering a child, was baseless, and this has caused a political scandal in Ireland since the national television network aired the allegations without arranging a DNA test.Irish TV Network Defames Innocent Priest, Issues Apology , The Media Report, November 2011, accessed 23 November 2011.Republic's government order probe into RTE Fr Reynolds libel case, BBC News, 23 November 2011. At the time of the May broadcast, the Irish Missionary Union, representing 83 missionary groups, issued a statement deploring \\"any crimes of abuse or inappropriate behaviour at home or abroad, which led to children or vulnerable adults being abused\\", but did not say when it would investigate any of the allegations.Seen on http://imu.ie/ on 23 May 2011 Instead it called on the Garda√≠ to investigate, a process that could be slow and expensive. The Irish Missionary Union, along with the Conference of Religious of Ireland and the Irish bishops, followed legal advice to refuse information to the National Board for Safeguarding Children (see above), even though it is one of the Board's sponsoring bodies. Alan Shatter, the Irish Minister for Justice and Equality, commented about the RT√â programme that he had \\"a sense of revulsion at the unspeakable catalogue of abuse against children. While the behaviour took place abroad, we have a solemn duty to do all that is within our power to ensure that perpetrators of this predatory abuse of children are brought to justice wherever it takes place.\\" Irish criminal law allows for the prosecution in Ireland of sex offences committed abroad under the 1996 Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act. The program wrongly made allegations against Fr. Kevin Reynolds, who received an apology and \\"massive damages.\\" Richard Anthony Burke was accused in the same program of underage sex in Nigeria. He sued RT√â for libel in 2015, claiming he and the accuser had only had adult consensual sex. RT√â settled out of court, claiming to have paid part of Burke's costs but no damages. Pastoral letter from Pope Benedict XVI After the pressure gathered from the Ryan and Murphy Reports and the resignation of bishops, Pope Benedict XVI summoned all of the Irish Bishops to the Vatican in January 2010. Following their meeting, it was announced that a pastoral letter would be written to address the issues involving the sexual abuse of children. The letter was released by the Vatican on 20 March 2010. In the letter addressed to the Catholics of Ireland, the Pope said he was \\"truly sorry\\" for the harm done to Catholics who suffered \\"sinful and criminal\\" abuse at the hands of priests, brothers and nuns. He acknowledged the \\"serious mistakes\\" made by the clergy. The letter did not ask for the resignation of the Cardinal Primate of All Ireland, Se√°n Brady, and did not address the Ryan and Murphy reports. The letter was to be read out at Mass on 21 March 2010. Reaction to the contents of the letter was mixed. The letter was well received by Cardinal Brady, Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin and the Conference of Religious of Ireland (CORI). Survivors of Child Abuse coordinator John Kelly said in a statement, \\"This letter is a possible step to closure and we owe it to ourselves to study it and to give it a measured response. We are heartened by the Pontiff's open acceptance that the abusive behavior of priests and religious were criminal acts.\\" Others did not think the letter went \\"far enough\\". One victim of abuse, Andrew Madden, called upon the Pope to resign. One in Four, a group representing victims of sexual abuse, said that they were \\"deeply disappointed\\" with the letter. False allegations Not all allegation made against priests have turned out to be true. Fr. Liam O'Brien, parish priest at Currow, in Killarney, Co Kerry, was subjected to claims of sexual abuse for more than four years starting in December 2008. In May 2013 his accuser, Eileen Culloty, a woman in his parish who had stalked and harassed the priest, even disrupting a funeral service he was conducting in 2011, apologised unreservedly in a letter read to the High Court. The woman admitted fabricating the allegations and said Fr. O'Brien was a person of the utmost integrity. List of accused clergy In August 2018, a list was released revealing that of the over 1,300 Irish clergy who were accused, only 82 were convicted.

His birth name Wassaja, means \\"Signaling\\" or \\"Beckoning\\" in his native tongue. Wassaja was kidnapped by Pima raiders along with other children to be sold or bartered. Wassaja was then purchased by an Italian photographer Carlo Gentile in Adamsville, for thirty silver dollars. Gentile renamed him \\"Carlos Montezuma\\". Montezuma was the first Native American student at the University of Illinois and Northwestern University, and only the second Native American ever to earn a medical degree in an American University after Susan La Flesche Picotte. Wassaja was the first Native American male to receive a medical degree. Until his death Wassaja fought to support the rights of his Yavapai people and other Native Americans.  Biography  \\"I am a full- blooded Apache Indian, born around the year 1866... some where near Four Peaks, Arizona Territory\\", wrote Dr. Montezuma, introducing himself in a letter written in 1905 to the Smithsonian Institution.The letter was written by Montezuma in response to a request from Professor William H. Holmes of the Smithsonian Institution. A typescript copy of the letter is in the National Anthropological Archives. He was named \\"Wassaja\\" (which means \\"signaling\\" or \\"beckoning\\") by his parents. His father was a chief named Co-cu-ye-vah and his mother was named Thil-ge-ya. In October 1871, at the age of 5, he was captured by Pima raiders together with other children to be enslaved or bartered. Wassaja was brought to Adamsville, a mixed Anglo and Mexican village, and offered for thirty silver dollars to itinerant Italian photographer Carlo Gentile, who happened to be in the area for his ethnographic work on Native Americans. Gentile, a cultured and liberal man from Naples who had moved to America in the 1850s, adopted Wassaja as his own son and renamed him \\"Carlos Montezuma\\" as an enduring and proud reminder of the child's cultural heritage, partly after himself, partly from the Montezuma ruins near Adamsville.Marino, Cesare (1998). The Remarkable Carlo Gentile: Italian Photographer of the American Frontier. Nevada City, California: Carl Mautz Publishing. Dr. Montezuma served as resident physician at the Carlisle Indian School from 1895-1897. In the following years, Wassaja/Carlos accompanied his adoptive father in his pioneering photographic and ethnographic expeditions in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. For a few months in 1872‚Äì73 they even joined the theatrical troupe of Ned Buntline and Buffalo Bill, where the boy Wassaja was featured as Azteka, the Apache-child of Cochise in the Wild West melodrama The Scouts of the Prairie in cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville, Cleveland and Pittsburgh, while Gentile produced and sold promotional cartes de visite of the cast members.Palmquist, Peter E.; Kailbourn, Thomas R. (2000) Pioneer Photographers of the Far West: A Biographical Dictionary 1840-1865. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. Gentile and Montezuma resided in Chicago and then New York for some years until the loss of all his belongings in a fire in 1877 forced Gentile back to his itinerant life and to Chicago. Being regularly homeschooled by Gentile and attending public schools in Chicago (1872‚Äì75), Galesburg (1875‚Äì77) and Brooklyn (1877‚Äì78), Wassaja had revealed to be a committed and talented student. Realizing that he needed a more permanent setting to complete his education, in the fall of 1878 Gentile asked for the assistance of the Reverend George W. Ingalls of the Indian Department of the American Baptist Home Mission Society. Wassaja was placed in the care of Baptist minister William H. Steadman, of Urbana, Illinois, while Gentile was busy reviving his business as photographer and editor in Chicago. Wassaja magazine. April 1916. The precocious child could now devote himself entirely to study. He graduated with honors from Urbana High School in 1879. Following one more year of preparatory work, he enrolled at the University of Illinois in 1880. He was only fourteen years old. At the University of Illinois he studied English, mathematics, German, physiology, microscopy, zoology, mineralogy, physics, physiology, mental science, logic, constitutional history, political economy, and geology, excelling in chemistry, which he took each quarter. Montezuma (or Monte as he was referred to by classmates)The Public (November 2007). also began his public activity in support of Native Americans' rights. On May 5, 1883 the campus paper, The Illini, records a speech on Indian's Bravery Montezuma delivered the night before in Adelphic Hall in front of a large audience, in which \\"he likened the Indians to the Spartans at Thermopylae.\\" After graduating from the University of Illinois in 1884, Montezuma returned to Chicago. He there received his doctorate of medicine from the Chicago Medical College, a branch of Northwestern University, in 1889 and obtained his license to practice that same year. Montezuma was not only the first Native American student at both the University of Illinois and Northwestern University, but also the second Native American ever to earn a Medical Degree in an American University after Susan La Flesche Picotte (1889). Wassaja was the first Native American man to receive a medical degree. Dr. Carlos Montezuma plaque As early as 1887, Carlos Montezuma had been corresponding with Richard Henry Pratt, a staunch assimilationist and founder of the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. In the eyes of Pratt, Montezuma was a living example of what educated Native Americans could accomplish. In 1887 Montezuma was invited to address audiences in New York and Philadelphia on this topic. Thanks to these connections, immediately after graduation, Jefferson Morgan, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, offered Dr. Montezuma work as a physician with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). In 1889 Montezuma traveled to reservations and provided services to Native Americans at Fort Stevenson in Dakota Territory. In 1890 he was transferred to the Western Shoshone Agency in Nevada. In January 1893, Montezuma went to Colville Agency in the State of Washington, and finally, in July 1893 to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. Here, Montezuma had the opportunity to work with his mentor Richard Henry Pratt. This relationship, along with his negative experiences working on the various reservations, helped form his early ideas of Indian policy. On October 27, 1893, Wassaja's adoptive father, Carlo Gentile, died in Chicago.Rumors of suicide in later literature (see Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography by Dan L. Thrapp are not confirmed either in the letters Montezuma exchanged with Gentile's widow, or in the obituary published in The Eye of November 11, 1893, where it is said the Gentile \\"suffered from Bright disease\\". Montezuma had last visited Gentile in the summer of 1893 while traveling from the State of Washington to his new job at Carlisle. Being now in Pennsylvania, Montezuma was not able to attend the funeral. He gave financial aid to Gentile's widow and in an ironic twist of fate, he became for some time the custodian of Gentile's six-year-old son (also named Carlos) until Gentile's widow and the child moved to California by 1896. At the beginning of 1896 Dr. Montezuma left Pratt to return to Chicago and start private medical practice. In 1900, he traveled as team doctor with Coach Pop Warner's National Champion Carlisle Indian School football team back to Arizona for the first time since his childhood. The following year he was again in Arizona on his own, contacting long-lost relatives he had not seen since his abduction. Montezuma's hatred for the reservations softened once he saw how connected his people were to their ancestral land and understood that they considered it home. Thereafter, he joined the Yavapai struggle that led to the creation of the Fort McDowell Yavapai or Mohave-Apache Reservation by late 1903. Until his death he would fight to support the rights of his people in the reservation. The grave of Dr. Carlos Montezuma in \\"Ba Dah Mod Jo\\" Cemetery. By 1905, Carlos Montezuma attracted national attention as an Indian leader. He began publicly attacking the government for the conditions imposed upon Natives. He became an outspoken opponent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). In addition, he helped found the Society of American Indians in 1911, the first Indian rights organization created by and for Indians. In 1916 he started a monthly magazine titled Wassaja that he used as a platform to spread his views of the BIA and Native American education, civil rights and citizenship. Dr. Montezuma became very ill with tuberculosis in 1922 and decided to permanently return to the land of his people. He died on January 31, 1923 and is buried at the Fort McDowell Indian cemetery. The memory of his work faded until the 1970s when historians rediscovered his achievements. Legacy The Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation in 1996 dedicated their new health care facility the Dr. Carlos Montezuma, Wassaja Memorial Health Center.* In 2015, the University of Illinois announced that it would be naming its newest residence hall in his honor. The naming included former Chancellor Phyllis Wise meeting with the Peoria tribe, originally from Illinois who were relocated to Oklahoma by the Indian Relocation Act, in order to improve Native American relations on campus.

Plants native to North America were used to reinforce the banks of Goffle Brook, in combination with boulder walls and rock armored bank toes. Additionally, new walking and jogging paths were created, along with benches and refuse bins. To offset the loss of trees during the initial stages of the project, over four hundred new trees were planted. Five hundred new shrubs and plants were also installed, including the vegetation used to restore the banks of the brook. Plantings along the stream banks include various willow species, such as Salix discolor (American Willow) and Salix amygdaloides (Peachleaf Willow). =Colonial past= Prior to the American Revolution, two Lenape camps existed within the boundaries of what would eventually become the park.

Sitting on the eastern foot of Goffle Hill (First Watchung Mountain), the verdant Goffle Brook Park follows Goffle Brook for a little over a mile and a half between CR 665 Lafayette Ave and MacFarlan Ave/Maitland Ave in Hawthorne. While no wider than a third of a mile, the park offers sweeping views from its hilly southern meadows. In the winter, these hilly sections of the park are popular sleigh riding attractions. The southern section of the park also features an enclosed dog run, various ball fields, two playgrounds, a picnic area, and wooded walking trails.

Black-Brown unity, variations include Black-Brown-Yellow unityJung 2006, p. 221.Cooks 1992, p. 11. and Black-Brown-Yellow-Red unity,Eisenstein 2004, p. 132. is a racial-political ideology which initially developed among Black scholars, writers, and activists who pushed for global activist associations between Black people and Brown people (including Chicanos and Latinos), as well as Asian people (referred to as \\"Yellow\\") and Indigenous peoples of the Americas (historically referred to as \\"Red\\") to unify against white supremacy, colonialism, capitalism, and, in some cases, European conceptualizations of masculinity, which were recognized as interrelated in maintaining white racial privilege and power over people of color globally.Eisenstein 2004, p. 37-39. The formation of unity struggles among people of color widely emerged in the 20th century and have been identified as an attempt to forge a united struggle by emphasizing the similar forms of oppression Black and Brown people confront under white supremacy, including shared experiences of subjugation under colonial capitalism, Jim Crow laws, de jure and de facto school and community segregation, voter disenfranchisement, economic oppression, exclusion from white-owned establishments (e.g. \\"No Dogs, Negroes, Mexicans,\\" \\"No Colored Served Here,\\" \\"We Cater to White Trade Only\\"), and the perception by white people that Black and Brown people are biologically and racially predisposed to be inferior, criminal, disorderly, and degenerate.Behnken 2012, p. 6-7 According to scholars, unity becomes possible when the person of color who is oppressed in a white supremacist society first recognizes their status as a subject of racism and then moves to identifying with a community of other similarly oppressed peoples who are already working towards change. In some instances, such as in the case of forging an understanding of Yellow Power, scholars have noted that the need to create a pan-Asian identity and dismantle existing stereotypes (e.g. \\"model minority\\") are also necessary steps which precede the formation of cross-racial unity, as Asian-American activists, writers, and scholars such as Amy Uyematsu, Franklin Odo, Larry Kubota, Keith Osajima, and Daniel Okimoto have addressed since the late 1960s.Watkins 2012, p. 35-42. Black-Brown unity became highly visible in 2020, fueled by activists, journalists, and people who increasingly recognized the shared struggles of Black and Brown people in the United States amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Adam Serwer for The Atlantic stated that \\"the lives of disproportionately black and brown workers are being sacrificed to fuel the engine of a faltering economy, by a president who disdains them.\\" A study found that Black people and Latinos were three times as likely to know someone who had died of COVID-19. The George Floyd protests have increased recognition of police brutality affecting Black and Brown communities and open calls for unity among Black and Brown people. After being hit by rubber bullets at a Los Angeles protest, actor Kendrick Sampson stated that the police were \\"only here to terrorize Black and Brown communities and Indigenous folk,\\" who are the most vulnerable. Sampson previously supported Black-Brown-Indigenous unity in 2019. The Brown Berets, a Chicano/a organization, and Black Lives Matter organized a protest in San Antonio. Protests in Milwaukee were described as unifying Black and Brown communities within the city. In the aftermath of a conflict, activists in Little Village, Chicago, held a rally for Black and Brown unity to fight white supremacy.  Ideology  The racial-political ideology of Black-Brown unity is based on acknowledging the similarities of oppression endured by Black and Brown people. Scholars examining this racial- political ideology demonstrate how the social and economic oppression of Black and Brown people is not isolated from one another, but rather shares many similarities, which may serve \\"as a major potential resource for greater Black-Brown unity,\\" as described by scholars Tatcho Mindiola Jr., Yolanda Flores Niemann, and Nestor Rodriguez. The range of scholarship regarding Black-Brown(-Yellow-Red) unity is broad, yet works toward emphasizing the common goal of unity in the face of oppression.Eisenstein 2004, p. 55. Zillah Eisenstein and other scholars recognize how the need for unity among people of color emerged from the global nature of oppression and its relationship with capitalism, colonialism, masculinity, and white supremacy. As a result of this force, unity among people of color therefore operates as a means of resistance against this structure. > The language of otherness and difference became naturalized as the empire's > continents become dark, and races become savage. There is a colonialist > history to this becoming. Capitalism is the story of colonial conquest, of > the Americas, then of Asia and Africa. And this conquest is part and parcel > of an imperial masculinity which fantasizes the protection of white > femininity. Dominance and domination are white and male. Colonialism simply > presents itself as civilization and attempts to naturalize theft, rape, and > dehumanization. Similarly, Gary Okihiro recognizes how European colonialism was built on an ideology which justified \\"their expansion and appropriation of land, labor, and resources in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\\" This ideology of white superiority was justified \\"in the name of religion and science\\" which was wielded by the Europeans to assert their own purported superiority and \\"civilized\\" status in comparison to the \\"anti-Christian, uncivilized non- Europeans.\\" According to Okihiro, when enacted through colonialism, this ideology led to a plundering of the world by Europeans and the global slave trade, which dehumanized enslaved peoples as units of production ‚Äì a system of European development constructed on the underdevelopment of the Third World.Okihiro 1994, p. 37-38.  First wave: 1960s-70s  The first wave of movements asserting the objective of forming unity or coalitions between people of color and economically disadvantaged whites, began in the late 1960s in the United States and declined by the 1970s. Chicano activists such as Cesar Chavez in 1965-1966 and Reies L√≥pez Tijerina in 1967-1969 collaborated with civil rights and Black Power organizations to forge Black-Brown collaborative activist work. Organizations such as the Poor People's Campaign, organized by Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and Fred Hampton's Rainbow Coalition in 1969 attempted to construct multiracial coalitions based on the common interest of dismantling the structures which created poverty.Mantler 2013, p. 5-6. However, as a result of police brutality, government surveillance and harassment, sabotage campaigns by government agencies and local police departments which targeted activist organizations with the intention of producing distrust and disunity among activists and organizations, and the assassination of leaders such as King and Hampton, this wave of multiracial coalition building declined by the 1970s.Mantler 2013, p. 9-10. = Black-Brown unity = An unprecedented meeting of African American and Mexican American activists occurred in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the Alianza Federal de Pueblos Libres 1967 conference hosted by Reies Tijerina to explore Black and Brown unity, cooperation, and forge a cross-racial alliance. Representatives from nearly every major Black Power organization were present, including Anthony Akku Babu of the Black Panther Party, Ron Karenga of the Us organization, James Dennis of the Congress of Racial Equality, Ralph Featherstone of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and Walter Bremond of the Black Congress. Representatives of Chicano groups were also present, including Jos√© Angel Guti√©rrez of the Mexican American Youth Organization, Bert Corona of the Mexican American Political Association, D√°vid Sanchez of the Brown Berets, and Rodolfo \\"Corky\\" Gonzales of the Crusade for Justice.Behnken 2012, p. 1-3. Activist Maria Varela was also invited to the conference and to join the Alianza by Tijerina. The meeting ultimately produced the Treaty of Peace, Harmony, and Mutual Assistance, a seven-part pact which acknowledged mutual respect and cooperative alliance. Along with the other representatives, Hopi spiritual leader Thomas Banyacya, who was present at the conference along with many northern New Mexican villagers, also signed the treaty, which began with the following five articles:Mantler 2013, p. 74-75. > Article I: \\"Both peoples do promise not to permit the members of either of > said peoples to make false propaganda of any kind whatsoever against each > other, either by SPEECH or WRITING.\\" Article II: \\"Both peoples (races) do > promise, never to permit violence or hate, to break this SOLEMN TREATY > between said peoples.\\" Article III: Both peoples, make a SOLEMN promise, to > cure and remedy the historical errors and differences that exist between > said peoples. Article IV: Let it be known, that there will be a RECIPROCAL > right to send an EMISSARY or DELEGATE to the conventions, Congresses, and > National reunions of each of said peoples. Article V: Let it be known that > both peoples will have a political delegate to represent his interests and > relations with the other. The treaty concluded with the following statement: \\"this TREATY, will be valid between the two said peoples, as long as the Sun and Moon shall shine.\\" While this agreement recognized that disagreements and conflicts between Black and Brown people had been present in a society which actively oppressed both groups, it signified an attempt to forge a coalitive liberation movement, and has been noted by scholars in comparative civil rights scholarship to represent the inception of an attempt to forge Black-Brown unity. Attempts at coalition work between Black and Brown people largely occurred in the southwestern United States and had notable regional differences. In California, Black and Brown unity was exemplified through groups such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the National Farm Workers Association to combat racial segregation and fight for economic rights for farm workers. In Arizona and New Mexico, many Black Americans united with Mexican American groups in order to strengthen their civil rights struggle. In Texas, both Black and Brown Americans had their own widespread civil rights movements and unification was often not accentuated. Scholar Brian D. Behnken noted that \\"when African American and Mexican American activists moderated the divisive power of race by focusing on economics, they recognized the shared oppression of each group\\" and collectively fought for improved wages, hours, and working conditions.Behnken 2012, p. 8-9. Influenced by the Black Power movement, some Chicanos accentuated the similarities between Black and Brown political struggles. In 1968, the La Raza newspaper claimed the following on the relationship and shared struggle of Black Americans and Chicano communities: \\"Our oppressions are one. Our dreams are one. Our demands are one. We suffer as one, we react as one, we struggle as one!\\"L√≥pez 2009, p. 210-211. This new position was a considerable shift from previous generations of Mexican Americans, especially among community leaders, many of whom were openly assimilationist and sought to assert Mexican identity as white. One East Los Angeles study found that twice as many Mexican Americans favored cooperation with Black Americans in 1972 than in 1965, and concluded that \\"when one takes into account traditional animosities marring Black-Mexican American relations,\\" this was an \\"impressive finding.\\" However, while animosity from Mexican Americans notably lessened as a result of new expressions of solidarity among Chicanos, the total number of Mexican Americans who favored cooperation was still in the minority at 39%. In Los Angeles, school segregation became a focal point of Black-Brown unity throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the mid-1960s, 80% of Black students attended schools which were predominately Black. Similarly, 50% of Mexican students attended schools which were predominately Mexican. These schools were often overcrowded and poorly funded whereas white schools were newly built and not filled to capacity. The Chicano Blowouts of 1968, in which tens of thousands of students protested unequal conditions in Los Angeles schools, were accompanied by walkouts of thousands of Black students in South Los Angeles, who also participated. As noted by academic Daniel Martinez HoSang, Black and Mexican American parents and students were often \\"plaintiffs in litigation related to educational adequacy and reform\\" in court cases into the early 1970s.Martinez HoSang 2013, p. 120-123. In 1983, Black-Brown unity in Chicago led to the election of mayor Harold Washington. After Washington's death in 1987, \\"when the black base split over which alderman should succeed Washington, Latino supporters were set adrift, and the remnants of the city‚Äôs infamous Democratic Machine exploited that uncertainty,\\" as written by journalist Salim Muwakkil for In These Times. Richard M. Daley defeated Washington's successor by \\"pitting the gains of one group against the other‚Äîreplacing black officials with Latinos, for instance‚Äîin order to forestall the unity.\\" = Black-Yellow unity = Scholars have emphasized how Black-Yellow unity may be found in the shared experience of being subjected to slavery and servitude by European capitalism. Okihiro documents the \\"coolie\\" slave trade, in which approximately one-third of Asian enslaved peoples perished en route to the Americas under the forced authority of European and American ship captains, to assert that \\"the African and Asian coolie were kinsmen and kinswomen in that world created by European masters. For example, over 124,000 Chinese \\"coolies\\" were shipped to Cuba to service Cuba's plantation system. Historian Franklin W. Knight writes that the Chinese became \\"coinheritors with the Negroes of the lowliness of caste, the abuse, the ruthless exploitation.... Chinese labor in Cuba in the nineteenth century was slavery in every social aspect except the name.\\" African and Asian forced laborers \\"were related insofar as they were both essential for the maintenance of white supremacy, they were both members of an oppressed class of 'colored laborers, and they both were tied historically to the global network of labor migration as slaves and coolies.\\"Okihiro 1994, p. 42-45. African American community and political leaders, such as Frederick Douglass and Blanche K. Bruce, recognized this shared oppression openly.Okihiro 1994, p. 48. Racism against African and Asian Americans was expressed via American law and proposed legislation. In California case The People v. George W. Hall (1854), Justice Charles J. Murray reversed the conviction of Hall, who had been convicted of murder based on the testimony of Chinese witnesses, based on legal precedents which had determined that \\"no black or mulatto person, or Indian, shall be allowed to give evidence in favor of, or against a white man\\" applied to Asian persons, since, in the American legal perception, \\"black meant nonwhite and white excluded all persons of color.\\" The court upheld this decision on the grounds that white men should be shielded from the testimony \\"of the degraded and demoralized caste\\" of racially inferior peoples.Okihiro 1994, p. 50-51. In 1860, California legally banned African, Asian, and Amerindian children from attending schools designated for whites. In 1880, California enacted an anti-miscegenation law which prohibited marriages between white and nonwhite persons, whether \\"negro, mulatto, or Mongolian.\\"Okihiro 1994, p. 51-52. In 1927, challenged by Gong Lum regarding segregation in Jim Crow schools, the United States Supreme Court upheld segregation and concluded that Chinese were \\"colored.\\"Okihiro 1994, p. 53-54. The American capitalist system was instituted along racial lines with the intention of creating divisions and preventing racial solidarity through pitting \\"African against Asian workers, whereby Asian workers were used to discipline African workers and to depress their wages.\\" Ethnocentrism and prejudice between African and Asian American workers often directly developed from \\"ideas and practices of the master class.\\" However, as Okihiro notes, while some African Americans were opposed to acts of cooperation and solidarity with Asian workers, the majority recognized that \\"the enemy was white supremacy and that anti-Asianism was anti-Africanism in another guise.\\" In 1925, following the establishment of A. Phillip Randolph's Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the Pullman Company hired Filipinos, which the Brotherhood initially referred to as \\"scab laborers.\\" However, by the 1930s, unlike the American Federation of Labor which excluded both Africans and Asians, the Brotherhood recognized the common struggle between Asian and African workers: > We wish it understood, that the Brotherhood has nothing against Filipinos. > They have been used against the unionization of Pullman porters just as > Negroes have been used against the unionization of white workers... We will > take in Filipinos as members... We want our Filipino brothers to understand > that it is necessary for them to join the Brotherhood in order to help > secure conditions and wages which they too will benefit from.  Challenges = Anti-Blackness = Anti-Blackness is a global obstacle to forming Black-Brown and multiracial unity. Scholars have identified U.S. media as a major exporter of anti-Blackness throughout the world, by shaping views through \\"racist stereotyping around the world, including negative images of Black Americans.\\" Hsiao-Chuan Hsia conducted a study of fifteen rural Taiwanese who had never been to the United States, yet perceived Black Americans as \\"self-destructive, dirty, lazy, unintelligent, criminal, violent, and ugly.\\" The researcher found that \\"these negative images were generally gleaned from U.S. television shows, movies, and music videos that the respondents had seen in Taiwan.\\" Similarly, researcher Nestor Rodriguez found that U.S. media was disseminating anti-Black perspectives in Central America. In a study comparing foreign-born and U.S.-born Latinas in Houston, it was determined that foreign-born Latinas held \\"even more negative attitudes toward Black Americans\\" than U.S.-born Latinas, which has been identified as suggesting that \\"the foreign-born bring negative views of Black Americans from their countries of origin.\\" U.S. media reinforces anti-Black communities within racialized communities by providing biased and selective coverage of Black Americans. The Kerner Commission, which was assembled to address the causes of the 1967 Detroit race riots, found that American media was a major agent of the violence \\"through coverage and editorial writing that sometimes was blatantly hostile and antiblack,\\" as summarized by academic Amy Alexander. The eleven-member commission wrote: \\"The media report and write from the standpoint of a white man's world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro's burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\\" Television news media in particular has been found through scientific surveys to increase \\"the extent of anti-Black racism in public.\\" The images of Black people the news media portrays have been found to perpetuate anti-Black stereotypes. The study, which controlled for education and other demographic traits, found that \\"heavy television viewers were more likely than light viewers to stereotype\\" Black people as being \\"unskilled and lazy.\\" In regard to non-Black Latino Americans and Chicanos, although they share a history of \\"colonial violence, slavery, genocide and exploitation of natural resources\\" with Black people, many harbor anti-Black sentiments which have existed since colonialism. Throughout Latin American countries, such as Brazil, the idea of racial whitening was made pervasive through colonialism, while mestizaje promoted a color-blind ideology. Because anti-Blackness is upheld by colonial states, such as the United States, many Latinos \\"buy-in to U.S.-based white dominant racial frames\\" while many Latino immigrants \\"bring anti-Black notions from their home countries or adopt anti-Black perspectives\\" as they learn from the dominant white supremacist culture to disparage and separate themselves Black Americans. American mass media has been identified as a major exporter of anti-Blackness to Latin America. Peter Ogom Nwosu identifies that racial slurs against Black people are common in Latino communities and that \\"racial skirmishes\\" in U.S. public schools between Black and Latino youth reflect a distrust among these communities. Nwosu argues that \\"Black and Latino historical struggles for freedom and justice are so intertwined that separation and divorce cannot be the most genuine pathway for progress in America,\\" and that anti-Blackness must be combated through mutual respect. In the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd, many discussed the need to deconstruct anti-Blackness in Asian American communities. Hmong American police officer Tou Thao became a central figure representing Asian American anti-Blackness, which \\"has sparked a conversation among Asian Americans\\" on the need to combat anti-Blackness in their communities. Previous cases such as Peter Liang in the shooting of Akai Gurley and anti-Black violence among Asian Americans during the 1992 Rodney King riots in the murder of Latasha Harlins were identified as exemplifying a tradition of anti-Blackness. Cultural critic Rachel Ramirez remarks that deconstructing anti-Blackness in Asian American communities is \\"a continuous process that requires breaking cultural barriers.\\" Scholar Ellen Wu noted that, even though events such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and anti-Japanese sentiments were pervasive, that \\"in the 1960s, white liberals wielded the model minority stereotype to stifle black social movements.\\" As a result, these gains fueled complicity in white supremacy among Asian Americans, as stated by Wu: ‚ÄúThese gains, however, have come at a cost: complicity with white supremacy.‚Äù The killing of 19-year-old Fong Lee in 2006 and the beating of 57-year-old Sureshbhai Patel in 2015, have been cited as cases of police brutality against Asian Americans that should also be recognized, not to overshadow police brutality against Black Americans, but to form solidarity. Youa Vang, mother of Fong Lee, stated that this was a moment \\"to stand in solidarity with the black community to fight for justice for Floyd ‚Äî and to encourage Asian Americans, who have been divided in support of movements like Black Lives Matter, to do the same.\\" During the George Floyd protests in Little Village, Chicago and Cicero, Illinois there were reports that Latino men of the Latin Kings gang, founded in Chicago, had harassed and attacked Black people driving through the neighborhood, throwing bricks at their cars. They claimed that they were protecting businesses. A 49-year-old Black man was shot in the wrist during the attacks by a youth gang member. Some residents claimed the police had allowed the gang to roam, while the police denied this accusation. In response, eight Latino aldermen, released a joint statement denouncing ‚Äúwhite supremacy, racism, economic exploitation, and anti-Blackness in all its forms.‚Äù A solidarity march at Cicero Town Hall was held shortly after, denouncing the conflict. On June 2nd, \\"a coalition of Latino organizers formed the Brown Squad For Black Lives and a Black and Brown Unity food pantry was planned.\\" The following day, a rally under the 26th street arches in Little Village was held. Stephanie Cerda-Ocampo stated that she had joined the rally to emphasize a ‚Äúneed to stick together and fight against the real issue like white supremacy.‚Äù Michelle Zacarias, one of the founders of the Brown Squad For Black Lives stated, \\"the ultimate goal is to make sure that our Black community members are protected at all costs. And also understanding that Black liberation means liberation for all people. Our struggles are intersected.\\" The Washington Post reported that a truce between the Latin Kings and the local Black P Stones was declared and the conflict was settled. Chicago Sun-Times characterized the conflict as a result of misplaced blame: \\"All too often in Chicago, Latinos and African Americans fight for scraps. We have to accept slumlords as landlords. We don‚Äôt know where to turn when our wages are stolen.\\" = Asian Americans and the \\"model minority\\" = In 1956, social scientists William Caudill and George De Vos initially hypothesized on the commonalities between Japanese culture and \\"the value systems found in American middle class culture\\" and positioned Asian Americans as reflecting similarities with white culture or existing as a \\"model minority.\\" Gary Okihiro notes that, although Caudill and De Vos had attempted to \\"distinguish between identity and compatibility, similarity and sharing, subsequent variations on the theme depicted Asians as 'just like whites'.\\" Okihiro notes that because of the manner in which race is conceptualized in the United States, as a binary between white and black, Asian, Amerindian, and Latinos are positioned as \\"somewhere along the divide between black and white.\\" While Okihiro acknowledges that Asian Americans have \\"served the master class,\\" whether as an oppressed class on a similar status to Black Americans or as a model minority class who presently may be perceived as \\"near whites,\\" he ultimately concludes that \\"yellow is emphatically neither white nor black; but insofar as Asians and Africans share a subordinate position to the master class, yellow is a shade of black, and black, a shade of yellow.\\"Okihiro 1994, p. 32-34. In his 1973 essay entitled \\"Yellow Power,\\" Larry Kubota echoes the sentiments of Frantz Fanon's notion regarding the psychic violence of colonialism and refers to the model minority stereotype as a myth which had conditioned some Asians in the United States to believe that \\"there was no need for change because their own social and economic status was assured.\\" As scholar Rychetta Watkins notes of Kubota's perceptions on the notion of the Asian model minority, \\"this myth not only flattened the image of the community to a small group of successful second- and third- generation Chinese Americans and Japanese Americans, it also isolated Asian Americans from other ethnic minorities, hindering the coalitions which would be necessary for creating a revolutionary coalition in America.\\" Amy Uyematsu similarly reflects that \\"Asian Americans are perpetuating white racism [...] as they allow white America to hold up the successful Oriental image before other minority groups as the model to emulate.\\" Keith Osajima addresses Asians in America who use the model minority myth to uphold white supremacy: \\"fully committed to a system that subordinates them on the basis of non-whiteness, Asian Americans still tried to gain complete acceptance by denying their yellowness. They have become white in every respect but color.\\"Watkins 2012, p. 39-40. =Mexican Americans and whiteness = Prior to the establishment of the Chicano Movement and the consolidation of Chicano identity in the late 1960s and 1970s, most Mexican American community leaders were fixated on attempting to appeal to the white establishment by claiming a white identity. Lisa Y. Ramos notes that, prior to the 1960s, many \\"Mexican American leaders were wedded to whiteness, meaning they possessed a strong identification with the white race and especially the idea of white racial supremacy over other racial groups.\\"Ramos 2012, p. 19-20 In the 1930s, legal scholar Ian Haney L√≥pez records that \\"community leaders promoted the term Mexican American to convey an assimilationist ideology stressing white identity.\\"L√≥pez 2009, p. 1-3. Ramos notes that \\"this phenomenon demonstrates why no Black-Brown civil rights effort emerged prior to the 1960s.\\" Chicano identity was critical in shifting these perceptions among Mexican Americans towards opening the possibility of Black-Brown unity, as \\"Chicanos defined themselves as proud members of a brown race, thereby rejecting not only the previous generation's assimilationist orientation but their racial pretensions as well.\\" Even prior to the 1960s, members of the Mexican community who were of darker complexion, recent immigrants, and/or working-class often identified based on their cultural or familial ties in Mexico and not by their race. In the 1940s and 1950s, as a precursor to the Chicano Movement, Mexican youth rejected the previous generation's racial aspirations and developed an \\"alienated Pachuco culture that fashioned itself neither as Mexican nor American.\\" As a result, some scholars designate a difference between Chicanos and Mexican Americans. According to L√≥pez, \\"Mexican Americans refers to the Mexican community who insisted that Mexicans are white, and Chicanos refers to those who argued instead that Mexicans constitute a non-white race.\\"  Notes References * Abel, Elizabeth (2010).

The 106-episode TV dramaserial was aired on Channel I and it has a rural setting, depicting colourful lifestyles of a rural village. This drama stars Humayun Faridi, ATM Shamsuzzaman, Wahida Mollick Jolly, Chanchal Chowdhury, Salauddin Lavlu, Fazlur Rahman Babu, Mosharraf Karim, Tania, Diti and Bonna Mirza. Plot Vober Hat is a story situated in the village of Vobhodia and the play follows the story of two brothers, Harem Kha and Marem Kha, who have cut off all ties for 25 years over a trivial incident. These two brothers have not talked or looked at each other for 25 years and so instead they both use their own workers to talk to each other. (Nata is the worker for Marem Kha and Adidludin is the worker for Harem Kha.) Harem Kha (the younger brother) and his wife Angoori have two daughters, Goina and Ayna. Goina and Ayna are both college students, but as the elder sister, Goina has failed her final exams one after the other for two years. To stop Goina from failing any more, Harem Kha hires his relative Fisa to tutor his two daughters, plus Khushboo who also attends their College. Fisa is widely known around the whole village for being a Champion Tutor, but, only for females. So Fisa soon enough falls in deep love with Goina, but the third student, Khushboo falls even deeper for Fisa, very secretly. Marem Kha (the older brother) has two sons, Bhashan Kha and Ashan Kha. Marem Kha was married, but his wife had passed when his two sons were young. Bhashan Kha is the older brother out of the two siblings, and is the only person in the whole village of Vobhodia to ever go to University. Roomali is the younger sister of Marem Kha and Harem Kha, but she lives at Marem Kha's house. Roomali's Husband had left Roomali and ran away and never returned, but Roomali is not forgetting her husband to easily and she often goes out aimlessly looking for him. However, the two brothers' offspring seek a family reunion and Bhashan Kha falls in love with the elder sister, Goina and Ashan Kha falls for the younger sister, Ayna. Harem Kha and Marem Kha find out that something is happening between their kids and are both determined to split them using threats, rules and even spying on each other's children. There are another two important houses in this story, which is coachar Mama's house and Carbala Kaka's house. The greatly respected coachar Mama is the local football coach and once coached the two brothers Marem Kha and Harem Kha. coachar Mama lives with his elder Son, Toofa, his younger daughter, Khushboo and his brother-in-law Shada Miya. coachar Mama was also married but his wife died after giving birth to Khushboo. Tofa's is important character of this drama. He is a Music Teacher and he also only teaches females. So following Fisa, Tofa falls in love with Goyna's younger sibling Ayna. But here too there is a love triangle. Carbala Kaka's daughter Nokshi is deeply in love with Tofa. Neighbouring coachar Mama's house is indeed Carbala Kaka's house. Carbala Kaka's house consists of his sister, Gole, his two young children, Dola and Kala and his older daughter, Nokshi, who also attends the same college as Goyna. And again, Carbala Kaka's wife died many years ago. The story goes on slowly like this but one man interrupts the story and turns it upside down. Into the story two important new characters enter, and they are Dhobola and \\"Jotish\\" Baba Huzur. Dhobola is a sweet young girl who lives in the nearby village with her close friend Mahela. She is also a student and is studying for her final exams therefore a tutor would help her. Fiza is the only tutor, so he accepts Dhobola's plea, which ends up being a demand. As like many of the women in the village, Dhobola falls for Fiza, causing even more tension for Fiza. The \\"Jotish\\" is known as the 'Fortune teller'. He is believed to have supernatural powers of controlling the Sun and the Moon which help him to gain the hearts of the people of Vobhodia. But the people of Vobhodia are unaware of what kind of evil Jotish Baba is planning.

Accumulation of plastic waste on a beach. Petroleum has many uses, and the environmental impact of the petroleum industry is correspondingly extensive and expansive. Crude oil and natural gas are primary energy and raw material sources that enable numerous aspects of modern daily life and the world economy. Their supply has grown quickly over the last 150 years to meet the demands of rapidly increasing human population, creativity, and consumerism. Substantial quantities of toxic and non-toxic waste are generated during the extraction, refinement, and transportation stages of oil and gas. Some industry by-products, such as volatile organic compounds, nitrogen & sulfur compounds, and spilled oil can pollute air, water, and soil at levels that are harmful to life where improperly managed.Bautista H. and Rahman K. M. M. (2016). Review On the Sundarbans Delta Oil Spill: Effects On Wildlife and Habitats. International Research Journal, 1(43), Part 2, pp: 93‚Äì96. doi:10.18454/IRJ.2016.43.143 Climate warming, ocean acidification, and sea level rise are global changes enhanced by the industry's emissions of greenhouse gases like methane and micro-particulate aerosols like black carbon. Among all human activities, fossil-fuel extraction is the largest contributor to the ongoing buildup of carbon compounds in the earth's biosphere. The International Energy Agency and others report that oil & gas use comprised over 55% (18 Billion Tons) of the record 32.8 Billion Tons (BT) of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere from all energy sources during year 2017. Coal use comprised the remaining 45%. Total emissions continue to rise nearly every year: up another 1.7% to 33.1 BT in year 2018. Through its own operations, the petroleum industry directly contributed about 8% (2.7 BT) of the 32.8 BT year 2017 total of CO2 from fossil fuels. Also, due to its intentional and other releases of natural gas, the industry directly contributed at least 79 Million Tons of methane (2.4 BT CO2-equivalent) that same year; an amount equal to about 14% of all known anthropogenic and natural emissions of the potent warming gas. Since the industrial age began circa 1750‚Äì1850 with growing wood and coal use, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and methane have increased about 50% and 150%, respectively, above their relatively stable levels of the prior 800,000+ years. Each is currently increasing at a rate of about 1% every year, since about half of the added carbon is absorbed by the world's oceans. The acceleration is also so rapid that half of all emissions and buildup have occurred over just the past 30 years. Along with fuels like gasoline and liquified natural gas, petroleum enables many consumer chemicals and products, such as fertilizers and plastics. Most alternative technologies for energy generation, transportation, and storage can only be realized at this time because of its diverse usefulness. Conservation, efficiency, and minimizing waste impacts of petroleum products are effective industry and consumer actions toward achieving better environmental sustainability. General Issues=Toxic compounds= Petroleum distillates can create a sheen on the surface of water as a thin layer creating an optical phenomenon called interphase. Petroleum is a complex mixture of many components . These components include straight chained, branched, cyclic, monocyclic aromatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The toxicity of oils can be understood using the toxic potential or the toxicity of each individual component of oil at the water solubility of that component. There are many methods that can be used to measure the toxicity of crude oil and other petroleum related products. Certain studies analyzing levels of toxicity can use the target lipid model or colorimetric analysis using colored-dyes in order to assess toxicity and biodegradability. Different oils and petroleum-related products have different levels of toxicity. Levels of toxicity are influenced by many factors such as weathering, solubility, as well as chemical properties such as persistence. Increased weathering tends to decrease levels of toxicity as more soluble and lower molecular weight substances are removed. Highly soluble substances tend to have higher levels of toxicity than substances that are not very soluble in water. Generally oils that have longer carbon chains and with more benzene rings have higher levels of toxicity. Benzene is the petroleum-related product with the highest level of toxicity. Other substances other than benzene which are highly toxic are toluene, methylbenzene and xylenes (BETX). Substances with the lowest toxicity are crude oil and motor oil. Despite varying levels of toxicity amongst different variants of oil, all petroleum -derived products have adverse impacts on human health and the ecosystem. Examples of adverse effects are oil emulsions in digestive systems in certain mammals might result in decreased ability to digest nutrients that might lead to death of certain mammals. Further symptoms include capillary ruptures and hemorrhages. Ecosystem food chains can be affected due to a decrease in algae productivity therefore threatening certain species. Oil is \\"acutely lethal\\" to fish - that is, it kills fish quickly, at a concentration of 4000 parts per million (ppm) (0.4%). The toxicity of petroleum related products threaten human health. Many compounds found in oil are highly toxic and can cause cancer (carcinogenic) as well as other diseases. Studies in Taiwan link proximity to oil refineries to premature births. Crude oil and petroleum distillates cause birth defects. Benzene is present in both crude oil and gasoline and is known to cause leukaemia in humans. The compound is also known to lower the white blood cell count in humans, which would leave people exposed to it more susceptible to infections. \\"Studies have linked benzene exposure in the mere parts per billion (ppb) range to terminal leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and other blood and immune system diseases within 5-15 years of exposure.\\" Fossil gas and oil naturally contain small amounts of radioactive elements which are released during mining. High concentration of these elements in brine is a technological and environmental concern. =Greenhouse gases= Petroleum extraction disrupts the equilibrium of earth's carbon cycle by transporting sequestered geologic carbon into the biosphere. The carbon is used by consumers in various forms and a large fraction is combusted into the atmosphere; thus creating massive amounts of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, as a waste product. Natural gas (mostly methane) is an even more potent greenhouse house when it escapes into the atmosphere prior to being burned. =Microplastics= Petroleum has enabled plastics to be used to create a wide range and massive quantity of consumer items at extremely low production costs. Single-use plastics and improper disposal are common. The majority of plastic is not recycled, and it fragments into smaller and smaller pieces over time. Microplastics are observable in air, water, and soil samples gathered from nearly every location on earth's surface, and also increasingly within biological samplings. Long-term effects from the environmental buildup of plastic waste are under scientific evaluation but thus far mostly unknown. Local and regional impacts Some harmful impacts of petroleum can be limited to the geographic locations where it is produced, consumed, and/or disposed. In many cases, the impacts may be reduced to safe levels when consumers practice responsible use and disposal. Producers of specific products can further reduce the impacts through life cycle assessment and environmental design practices. =Air pollution= Petroleum diesel exhaust from a truck Exhaust emissions Emissions from the petroleum industry occur in every chain of the oil-producing process from the extraction to the consumption phase . In the extraction phase, gas venting and flaring release not only methane and carbon dioxide, but various other pollutants like nitrous oxides and aerosols. Certain by-products include carbon monoxide and methanol. When oil or petroleum distillates are combusted, usually the combustion is not complete and the chemical reaction leaves by-products which are not water or carbon dioxide. However, despite the large amounts of pollutants, there is variation in the amount and concentration of certain pollutants. In the refinement stages of petroleum also contributes to large amounts of pollution in urban areas. This increase in pollution has adverse effects on human health due to the toxicity of oil. A study investigating the effects of oil refineries in Taiwan. The study found an increased occurrence of premature births in mothers that lived in close proximity to oil refineries than mothers who lived away from oil refineries. There were also differences observed in sex ratios and the birth weight of the children. Also, fine particulates of soot blacken humans' and other animals' lungs and cause heart problems or death. Soot is cancer causing (carcinogenic) Vapor intrusion Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are gases or vapours emitted by various solids and liquids.\\" Petroleum hydrocarbons such as gasoline, diesel, or jet fuel intruding into indoor spaces from underground storage tanks or brownfields threaten safety (e.g., explosive potential) and causes adverse health effects from inhalation. =Acid rain= Trees killed by acid rain, an unwanted side effect of burning petroleum The combustion process of petroleum , coal , and wood is responsible for increased occurrence of acid rain. Combustion causes an increased amount of nitrous oxide s, along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil. These by-products combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain. The increased concentrations of nitrates and other acidic substances have significant effects on the pH levels of rainfall. Data samples analyzed from the United States and Europe from the past 100 years and showed an increase in nitrous oxide emissions from combustion. The emissions were large enough to acidify the rainfall. The acid rain has adverse impacts on the larger ecosystem. For example, acid rain can kill trees, and can kill fish by acidifying lakes. Coral reefs are also destroyed by acid rain. Acid rain also leads to the corrosion of machinery and structures (large amounts of capital) and to the slow destruction of archeological structures like the marble ruins of Rome and Greece. =Oil spills= An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially marine areas, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually applied to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. Oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers, pipelines, railcars, offshore platforms, drilling rigs and wells, as well as spills of refined petroleum products (such as gasoline, diesel) and their by-products, heavier fuels used by large ships such as bunker fuel, or the spill of any oily refuse or waste oil. Major oil spills include, Lakeview Gusher, Gulf War oil spill, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Spilt oil penetrates into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals, reducing its insulating ability, and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water. Cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors, including the type of oil spilled, the temperature of the water (affecting evaporation and biodegradation), and the types of shorelines and beaches involved.Lingering Lessons of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Other factors influencing the rate of long-term contamination is the continuous inputs of petroleum residues and the rate at which the environment can clean itself Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up. =Waste oil= Waste oil in the form of motor oil Waste oil is oil containing not only breakdown products but also impurities from use. Some examples of waste oil are used oils such as hydraulic oil, transmission oil, brake fluids, motor oil, crankcase oil, gear box oil and synthetic oil.State of Maine (www.maine.gov) Many of the same problems associated with natural petroleum exist with waste oil. When waste oil from vehicles drips out engines over streets and roads, the oil travels into the water table bringing with it such toxins as benzene. This poisons both soil and drinking water. Runoff from storms carries waste oil into rivers and oceans, poisoning them as well. Global impacts=Climate change= The combustion of petroleum causes an increased amount of carbon dioxide emissions as well as other greenhouse gases. One of the first studies on the effects of carbon dioxide on climate was in the late 1800s by Swedish Nobel chemist Svante Arrhenius. His mathematical model showed that an increase of carbon dioxide results in an increase in surface temperatures. The science has further advanced since then, and the IPCC (2007) states that earth's climate system will heat up by 3 degrees Celsius for a doubling of carbon dioxide. Such warming of the temperatures will have massive impacts on rainfall patterns, retreat of glaciers, and the average sea levels. =Ocean acidification= A fraction of the added greenhouse gases are absorbed by the oceans to form carbonic acid. The increased acidity contributes to coral bleaching and acts more generally to disrupt seashell formation. Ocean warming is also driving the migration of mobile marine life towards the polar regions. Subsidies Modern human societies utilize cheap and abundant energy to promote economic growth and maintain political stability. Government's and economic institutions around the world lower prices and increase supplies of fossil fuels for both consumers and producers by providing various forms of financial support to the industry. These include such traditional subsidies as direct payments, tax preferences, depletion allowances, research & development grants, and the removal of existing environmental protections. Considering all forms of support, the largest assistance to fossil fuels arises from the failure of governments to pass along most costs from the environmental and human-health impacts of the waste. Accounting by the International Energy Agency and OECD indicates that traditional subsidies throughout the world amounted to about $400-600 Billion annually during years 2010‚Äì2015, and remained near $400 Billion in year 2018 with 40% going to oil. By comparison, a working group at the International Monetary Fund estimates that all support to the fossil-fuel industry totaled about $5.2 Trillion (6.4% of global gross domestic product) during year 2017. The largest subsidizers were China, the United States, Russia, the European Union, and India which together accounted for about 60% of the total. According to the theory of ideal market competition, accurate prices could act to drive more responsible industry and consumer choices that reduce waste and long-term scarcity. Eliminating subsidies to restore accurate prices would have their most direct effects from the supply side of the industry. By contrast, the objective of some carbon tax and carbon trading mechanisms is to restore pricing accuracy from the consumption side. Mitigation=Conservation and phasing out= Many countries across the World have subsidies and policies designed to reduce the use of petroleum and fossil fuels. Examples include China which switched from providing subsidies for fossil fuels to providing subsidies for renewable energy. Other examples include Sweden which created laws which are designed to eventually phase out the use of petroleum, which is known as the 15-year plan. These policies have their benefits and their challenges and every country has had their different experiences. In China, positive benefits were observed in the energy system due to higher renewable energy subsidies in three ways. It made consumption of energy cleaner due to moving for cleaner sources. Secondly, it helped increase the efficiency and third it resolved the issue of imbalanced distribution and consumption. However, from the Chinese experience, there were challenges observed. These challenges included economic challenges like initially lower economic benefits for subsidies from renewable energy than for oil. Other challenges included a high cost of research and development, the uncertainty of cost and potentially high-risk investments. These factors make the development of renewable energy very dependent on government support. However, aims of phasing out fossil fuels and petroleum use may also present economic benefits such as increased investment. This strategy may help achieve social goals for example reduction in pollution which might translate to better environmental and health outcomes.Article on Sweden's Phasing Out of Petrol Use (www.guardian.co.uk) Another option for conserving energy and phasing out petroleum use is adopting new technologies in order to increase efficiency. This can include changing production methods and modes of transportation. =Substitution of other energy sources= Alternatives to petroleum can include using other ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù energy sources such as renewable energy, natural gas or biodiesel. Some of the alternatives have their strengths and limitations that might impact on the possibility of adopting them in the future. Using corn-based ethanol might be an alternative to using petroleum. However, studies that concluded that corn-based ethanol uses less net energy do not factor in the co-products of production. Current corn-ethanol technologies are much less petroleum intensive than gasoline however have the GHG emission levels similar to gasoline. The literature is mainly unclear what the GHG emission changes would be by adopting corn-based ethanol for biodiesel. Some studies report a 20% increase in GHG emissions and some report a 32% decrease. However, the actual number might be a 13% decrease in GHG emissions which is not a significant decrease. The future of biodiesel might be adopting cellulose ethanol technology to produce biodiesel as that technology will contribute to a decrease in emissions. Renewable energy alternatives also exist. These include solar energy, wind energy, geothermal and hydroelectricity as well as other sources. These sources are said to have much lower emissions, and almost minimal secondary by products. The production of renewable energy is projected to grow in nearly every region in the World. Natural gas is also seen as a potential alternative to oil. Natural gas is much cleaner than oil in terms of emissions. However natural gas has its limitation in terms of mass production. For example, in order to switch from crude oil to natural gas there are technical and network changes that need to occur before the implementation can be complete. Two possible strategies are to first develop the end use technology first or second is to completely change the fuel infrastructure. =Use of biomass instead of petroleum= Biomass is becoming a potential option as a substitute for petroleum. This is due to the increased environmental impacts of petroleum and the desire to reduce the use of petroleum. Potential substitutes include cellulose from fibrous plant materials as a substitute for oil-based products. Plastics can be created by cellulose instead of oil and plant fat can be substituted for oil to fuel cars. In order for biomass to succeed there needs to be an integration of different technologies to different biomass feedstock in to produce different bioproducts. Incentives for biomass are a decrease of carbon dioxide, need for a new energy supply and need to revitalize rural areas. =Safety measures= There is also the potential to implement many technologies as safety measures to mitigate safety and health risks of the petroleum industry. These include measures to reduce oil spills, false floors to prevent gasoline drips in the water table and double-hulled tanker ships. A relatively new technology that can mitigate air pollution is called bio- filtration. Bio filtration is where off-gasses that have biodegradable VOCs or inorganic air toxins are vented out through a biologically active material. This technology successfully used in Germany and the Netherlands mainly for odor control.

Education and career  Trimble was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland. She studied piano with Annie Lord at the Royal Irish Academy of Music, Dublin, and music at Trinity College Dublin (BA 1936, BMus 1937) and continued her studies at the Royal College of Music (RCM), London, until 1940 (piano with Arthur Benjamin and composition with Herbert Howells and Ralph Vaughan Williams).Klein (1996), p. 466; see Bibliography. She first gained notice as part of a piano duo with her sister Valerie (1917‚Äì1980), earning a first prize at a Belfast music competition as early as 1925.Jamieson (2013), p. 1008; see Bibliography. Joan also composed a number of works for two pianos which the duo performed. A 1938 recital at the RCM, at which they performed three of them, was their breakthrough. Other composers wrote works for them, too, including Jamaican Rumba by Arthur Benjamin, which became a signature tune for the duo. Trimble's Phantasy Trio (1940) won the Cobbett Prize for chamber music. The sisters also performed modern music, including works by Stravinsky, Dallapiccola, Arthur Bliss and Lennox Berkeley and continued to perform in public until 1970. Trimble married in 1942 and had children, which restricted her compositional output. In 1957 her opera Blind Raftery was the third opera commissioned by the BBC for television, and the first television opera written by a female composer.Radio Times Issue 1749, 19 May 1957, p 6, 17 Between 1959 and 1977 she taught piano at the RCM, with the years since 1967 travelling from Northern Ireland. Joan Trimble's music is conservative for her time. She combined the impressionist harmonic language she had learned since her studies with Annie Lord with melodic and rhythmic inflections derived from Irish traditional music. Her arrangements of Irish airs for two pianos do not differ stylistically from her original compositions. Her most advanced music will be found in the Sonatina for two pianos (1940) and the impressive song cycle The County Mayo (1949). Trimble's music is always melodic, tastefully written, and rewarding for performers. After her father's death in 1967 she went to work on his newspaper, The Impartial Reporter in Enniskillen, and cared for her husband who was severely ill for decades. She regained some attention in the 1990s when she was commissioned for a new compositionObituary at the Daily Telegraph and the first recordings of her music appeared. She died in Enniskillen just two weeks after her husband. Legacy On 18 June 2015 \\"Music in Fermanagh\\" presented A Celebration Concert, as part of the Joan Trimble Centenary Celebration, at the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen.

On this date in 1999 India successfully took command of the high outposts. The Kargil war was fought for more than 60 days and ended on 26 July 1999, when the Pakistani army took advantage of the melting snow and - betraying the bilateral understanding of both the nations that the post would remain unattended during the winter season - took command of the high outposts of India. The Pakistani army denied involvement in the war, claiming that it was caused by independent Kashmiri rebel forces, however documents left behind by casualties and later statements by Pakistan's Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff showed involvement of Pakistani paramilitary forces, led by General Ashraf Rashid. The Kargil war resulted in loss of life on both the sides and was ended when India regained control over the post and ejected the Pakistani Army out of the territory. Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated on 26 July every year in honour of the Kargil War's Heroes. This day is celebrated in the Kargil‚Äìsector and the national capital New Delhi, where the Prime Minister of India pays homage to the soldiers at Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate every year. Functions are also organized all over the country to commemorate the contributions of the armed forces.City to observe Kargil Vijay Diwas today Allahabad, The Times of India, TNN July 25, 2009. History About Operation Vijay at Kargil War Memorial Dras. After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, there had been a long period with relatively few direct armed conflicts involving the military forces of the two neighbours ‚Äì not with standing the efforts of both nations to control the Siachen Glacier by establishing military outposts on the surrounding mountains ridges and the resulting military skirmishes in the 1980s. During the 1990s, however, escalating tensions and conflict due to separatist activities in Kashmir, as well as the conducting of nuclear tests by both countries in 1998, led to an increasingly belligerent atmosphere. In an attempt to defuse the situation, both countries signed the Lahore Declaration in February 1999, promising to provide a peaceful and bilateral solution to the Kashmir conflict. During the winter of 1998‚Äì1999, some elements of the Pakistani Armed Forces were covertly training and sending Pakistani troops and paramilitary forces,into territory on the Indian side of the line of control (LOC). The infiltration was code named \\"Operation Badri\\". The aim of the Pakistani incursion was to sever the link between Kashmir and Ladakh and cause Indian forces to withdraw from the Siachen Glacier, thus forcing India to negotiate a settlement of the broader Kashmir dispute. Pakistan also believed that any tension in the region would internationalize the Kashmir issue, helping it to secure a speedy resolution. Yet another goal may have been to boost the morale of the decade-long rebellion in Indian State of Kashmir by taking a proactive role. Initially, with little knowledge of the nature or extent of the infiltration, the Indian troops in the area assumed that the infiltrators were jihadis and declared that they would evict them within a few days. Subsequent discovery of infiltration elsewhere along the LOC, along with the difference in tactics employed by the infiltrators, caused the Indian army to realize that the plan of attack was on a much bigger scale. The total area seized by the ingress is generally accepted to between 130 km¬≤ ‚Äì 200 km¬≤. The Government of India responded with Operation Vijay, a mobilization of 200,000 Indian troops. The war came to an official end on July 26, 1999, thus marking it as Kargil Vijay Diwas. 527 soldiers from Indian Armed Forces lost their lives during the war.Vijay Diwas The Hindu, July 27, 2009.

Sterling Morton High School East (often called Morton East) is a public secondary school located in Cicero, Illinois. Morton East is one of three schools in J. Sterling Morton High School District 201. Morton East is a sophomore through senior building, with future students attending the J. Sterling Morton Freshman Center for one year. Morton East's sister school, J. Sterling Morton High School West is a four-year secondary school. From 1920‚Äì59, the school operated as Morton High School, changing its name when Morton West opened. The district and its schools are named after Julius Sterling Morton because he was friends with Cicero resident and fur trader Portus Baxter Weare.Kay, Betty Carlson.

History In 1892, there were reports that the town of Cicero was beginning to work to consolidate a school district that would include the current Morton Park and Hawthorne district with one consisting of the towns of Clyde and LaVergne, for means of adding what was called a \\"High School Department\\". Though only seven miles from downtown Chicago, the school, in its early history was situated on prairie and farmland. In 1915, the Chicago Tribune reported that Professor H.V. Church, then the principal of J. S. Morton, was forced to walk his cow nine miles from Berwyn to the docks at Rush Street so that he and his family might have nourishment at their summer farm in Michigan, where they stayed the summer. The article noted that the principal was \\"following the example of the mayor\\". More than 20 students were expelled in June 1916, after a lemon throwing incident which started in the evening of a school play, escalated into fighting in the school cafeteria the next day. That 1916 graduating class was reported to consist of 29 students graduating from \\"academic courses\\", 24 in \\"shorthand\\", and 8 in \\"bookkeeping\\". By 1917, the events of World War I were having an effect on the school. Students began raising vegetables on a six-acre plot of land adjacent to the school in order to supply produce for the school lunch room in the autumn. The six-acre garden was so consuming that the school withdrew their baseball team from the league they had been playing in to \\"devote (their) energies to the garden\\". At some point in the 1920s, the school began moving to a split schedule, with freshmen attending in the morning, and upperclassmen attending in the afternoon. This practice would continue until the opening of Morton West in 1958. In 1924, during a basketball game in the school's gym, a major fire erupted which caused US$900,000 in damage. The auditorium, girls' gymnasium, a library, and several classrooms and offices were lost. The fire forced the school to temporarily move to a split schedule, with the 1,200 freshmen attending classes from 8‚Äì12:30 during the day, and the upperclassmen to attend classes from 12:30‚Äì5. Cicero's more infamous claim to fame is its association with former resident Al Capone. In at least one instance in 1930, Capone was known to attend a football game at the school \\"still surrounded by his bodyguard of six\\". Rather than receiving standard diplomas, the 1,045 graduates of the class of 1938 were each given pocket sized diplomas so that they may be \\"conveniently displayed to prospective employers\\". In 1950, a major reconstruction began at the school. The five old frame structures were demolished to make way for brick structures, including two gymnasiums, an auto shop, a greenhouse, two libraries, a band room, a typesetting room, and over 100 other rooms. The expansion was not only in response to the increase in student population, which had already prompted preparations for building a second school, but that the older buildings were considered a safety hazard. The addition was completed in April 1952. By the spring of 1956, construction had begun on what was to become Morton West High School. The school would open in 1958 reducing the population congestion in the school. The graduation of the class of 1956 included a commencement address by the visiting mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Harold Roe Bartle. In 1963, a US$400,000 upgrade to the main library was completed, including new data processing equipment, including equipment that would create and read punch cards. In 1966, Morton East's student government sponsored a performance by the Chad Mitchell Trio, which at the time included a relatively unknown John Denver.

Some time prior to or during 2009 the school hired a \\"High schools That Work\\" consultant that, along with the leader of the school's science department, gave instruction to science teachers on how to teach classes. Marge Scherer, author of Challenging the Whole Child: Reflections on Best Practices in Learning, Teaching and Leadership, wrote that the school decided to \\"reject\\" the demographics of the school, considered disadvantaged, \\"as an excuse for low science scores.\\"Scherer, Marge.

Israel Post has 5,000 employees,Deal on Postal Company ends weeks-long strikes - Retrieved 7 October 2014 including 1,650 mail delivery staff and 2,000 postal clerks manning 700 post office branches around the country. It has a network of 4,262 mail boxes and 1,000 mail trucks. Some 2.5 million postal items are sorted every day.Facts and figures, Israel Postal Company In October 2014, mail deliveries were cut to twice a week. History The Israel Postal Company has its roots in the postal system from the British Mandate period (1920-1948). In 1948, after the establishment of the State of Israel, the Ministry of Transportation was given responsibility for the provision of postal services in the country. In 1951, the Ministry of Postal Services was established, which later became the Ministry of Communications. In keeping with the British model, the service included delivery of letters, parcels, and telegrams, as well as telephone services. The Israeli Postal Bank opened in 1951.Index of Postal Freedom Postal Consumers The Israel Postal Authority was created in 1986. Flag of Israel Postal Authority (not in use) Postal services in Israel have historically operated at a loss. In 2002, the loss was NIS 150 million, and in 2003 it was NIS 200 million. In 2002, in the wake of these losses, political scandals and technological developments in communications, major reforms were implemented. A new government company, the Israel Postal Company Ltd., was founded and went into operation in March 2006. Since 2007, the financial situation has improved, and Israel Post is now making a small profit. In June 2013, Israel Post signed an agreement to deploy the latest version of Escher‚Äôs Group Riposte retail software, a peer-to-peer network technology. In October 2014, Israel Post announced that it would be laying off 1,200 employees and dropping mail delivery to twice a week. Additionally, several branches were closed, while hours of those branches which remained were extended, to reduce waiting times. In March 2015, Israel Post added the ability to make appointments online or via an app, in another effort to reduce waiting times. Political appointments Being a government authority, the Israeli Postal Authority was a fertile bed for political appointments - quoting judge Revivi's take: \\"From the unraveling of testimonies, a grim picture rises, of an authority, in which the phenomena of political appointments has spread under every minister's shift\\".https://supremedecisions.court.gov.il/Home/Download?path=HebrewVerdicts\\\\08/840/042/t06&fileName;=08042840.t06&type;=4 Improper function complaints Public complaints over improper function of the Israel Postal Company have accumulated over the years. Such complaints were still on the rise during the last decade - in July 2015 the State Comptroller of Israel issued a report, stating that the highest rate of rightful complaints he received were issue against the Postal Company. 70% of complaints were found justified. As of 2019, the dissatisfaction of the public from the company's function seems to only be increasing - with State Comptroller of Israel issuing another harsh report - mentioning: \\"In recent years, the number of complaints filed with the Office has increased. The Israel Postal Company is the audited body against which the highest percentage of justified complaints were filed: 74.2% in 2017, whereas the overall percentage of justified complaints for that year stood at 32.2%. It appears that this trend continued into 2018.\\" Israeli philately Mailboxes used by the Israel Postal Service, Eretz Israel Museum, Philatelic Pavilion Automated package pick-up in Tel Aviv In April 1948, the British discontinued all postal services. On Friday, 14 May 1948, Israel declared independence. On Sunday morning, the new state issued its first stamps. There was virtually no paper for printing stamps and no appropriate printing presses or perforating machines. Even the name of the country had not yet been finalized. Nevertheless, Doar Ivri (\\"Hebrew Post\\") stamps appeared immediately after the declaration of independence, and went on sale at postal branches throughout the country. The Israel Philatelic Service was previously located on 137 Haganah Street in Tel-Aviv, but moved to 2 Pinsker Street in late 2019. Letters to God Every year, the Israel Postal Company receives thousands of letters from all over the world addressed to God. Rather than consider them dead letters, the letters are collected at the Givat Shaul central mail facility. Once a year, they are taken to the Old City and placed between the stones of the Western Wall in a festive ceremony.Dear God Ynetnews The post office also receives letters addressed to Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary and King David, but only those addressed to God are sent to the Western Wall.

In 1948, he retired from sculpture to engage in architectural pencil drawings, especially translating musical scores into graphic representation.  Biography  De Cesare was born in Palermo, Italy in 1890.See Elaine Evans Dee, Architectonic harmonies: John de Cesare, FMR issue #103, April‚ÄìMay 2000, p.63-84. His parents emigrated to the US in 1895. He studied sculpture at the Cooper Union Art School, NY. During the 1920s, he worked as ornamental sculptor for architects like McKenzie, Vorrhees and Gemlin. In the 1930s, he created his own company, Stifter & De Cesare, with up to 50 employees until it ceased activities, around 1945-48. He then retired and devoted his time to architectural drawing until his death in New York in 1972.  Sculpture  From 1916 on, the 1916 Zoning Resolution increased the number of skyscrapers being built in New York. Buildings were also meant to convey a strong corporate identity through architecture and ornaments. The prevalent architectural Art Deco style was characterized by the variety of materials used (steel, concrete, aluminium, stone, brick, ceramics, glass, etc.) and its exotic inspiration. John de Cesare created sculptural ornaments or bas-reliefs sculptures with motifs such as fruits, grapes, animals or humans, for the following buildings: the Verizon Building in Lower Manhattan (1923‚Äì27); the 1 Wall Street building (1929‚Äì32); and the Empire State Building (1927‚Äì29).  Drawings  In 1948, John de Cesare retired from sculpture and started working privately on an amazing series of 250 color pencil drawings also influenced by Art Deco's ornamental style. These were architectural drawings translating information from business charts, photographs, songs or music scores. Cesare had devised a coherent system to translate almost any kind of information into graphic representations. 20 of these drawings were based on musical scores, from The Star-Spangled Banner to Wagner, from Stephen Foster's Swanee River, to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, from Gounod's Ave Maria to a Bach Prelude. He devised a system of sound units where millimeters represented duration and pitch, what he calls the Space Rule Keys system.John De Cesare The Theory of Visual Space in Music, Precis 6, Rizzoli, New York, 1987 Notes become triangles where height equals pitch and length equals duration.

Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids and Cambridge,2003: ) is a book by British Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen (1932-). The book provides the reader with \\"the most sweeping scholarly case in a generation for the traditional beliefs held by Orthodox Jews and Christian conservatives\\", according to Richard Ostling. The book was intended to serve as a counterpart to F.F. Bruce's Are the New Testament Documents Reliable? (1943), and in so doing to counter the arguments of Biblical minimalism, which casts doubt upon the historical value of the Old Testament. The book opens with an introductory chapter surveying the history with which it intends to deal, the continuous narrative in the Hebrew Bible from the Genesis creation narrative to the return of the Jews to Jerusalem from the Babylonian captivity in the early days of the Persian Empire in the 5th century BC. The author claims that this history was written at the same time as the events it describes in its various sections, and that this can be confirmed by comparing the Old Testament with non-Biblical sources, both written and archaeological. He clarifies by stating that there are three elements he means to address, history, literature and culture, and three he does not, theology, doctrine, and dogma. The core of the book is eight chapters (chapters 2 to 9) surveying Biblical history and comparing it to the ages with which it deals, from the 3rd millennium (the period to which Kitchen traces the origins of the Biblical stories of Noah's Flood and other incidents from the opening chapters of Genesis) to the Babylonian captivity and the return of the Jews to Jerusalem under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah.

The related term, scientific and technical intelligence, addresses information collected or analyzed about the broad range of foreign science, technology, and weapon systems. Technical intelligence Technical intelligence is intended primarily to counter technological surprise. Knowledge of the characteristics and capabilities of enemy weapons allows nations to develop effective countermeasures for them. Occasionally, armed forces adopt technology developed by foreign nations. The jerrycan of World War II is an example of foreign equipment adopted by the US Army. Technical intelligence should not be confused with intelligence obtained \\"by technical means\\". That is a term of art used in discussion of disarmament to mean information gathered by various sorts of cameras, sensors, or other devices. Technical intelligence is the product: \\"technical intelligence‚ÄîIntelligence derived from the collection, processing, analysis, and exploitation of data and information pertaining to foreign equipment and materiel for the purposes of preventing technological surprise, assessing foreign scientific and technical capabilities, and developing countermeasures designed to neutralize an adversary's technological advantages.\\" Scientific and technical intelligence Soviet Bombers Scientific and technical intelligence (S&TI;) is \\"the (All-source intelligence) analysis and production resulting from the collection, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation of foreign scientific and technical information that covers: * Foreign developments in basic and applied research and in applied engineering techniques; * Scientific and technical characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of foreign military systems, weapons, weapon systems, and materiel; the research and development related thereto; and the production methods employed for their manufacture.\\" S&TI; covers not just the equipment, but the process by which it was developed and produced, the production rate of the country or organization making it, and possibly the economic and other priorities given to the project. Technical intelligence process The production of technical intelligence is a specialized intelligence art used to meet the needs of the armed forces and national intelligence consumers. A multiservice manual describes U.S. military doctrine for TECHINT. The technical intelligence process is divided into three areas‚Äîcollection, exploitation and production. =Collection of materiel and related documents= Chance plays an important part in the collection of foreign weapons and equipment. The collection phase typically begins when a soldier finds something interesting on a battlefield or a defecting pilot flies an aircraft to a friendly country. In a famous case, Viktor Ivanovich Belenko flew a Soviet Mig 25 \\"Foxbat\\" to Hakodate, Japan on 6 September 1976.. The United States granted Belenko asylum and assisted in the dismantling of the aircraft so that it could be crated for return to the Soviet Union. Procedures have been established for development of scientific and technical intelligence requirements, i.e. wish lists, to guide systematic collection efforts. Materiel required may be obtained through any number of channels. For example, materiel may be obtained through commercial channels. An attache might ask a foreign official for information about a piece of foreign equipment. Clandestine operations have been mounted to obtain critical enemy materiel. Probably the most expensive and most ambitious was the construction of Hughes Glomar Explorer by the Central Intelligence Agency to obtain the wreckage of Soviet submarine that sunk in the Pacific. =Exploitation (testing and analysis)= The exploitation phase includes various types of technical and operational tests. The services have well developed procedures for testing various types of materiel. Testing often includes operating the item and non- destructive testing. The Air Force Historical Studies Office Web contains an excellent account of the exploitation of Axis aircraft during World War II. =Production of finished intelligence= The production of technical intelligence includes preparation of a variety of reports and documents. TECHINT documents include a wide range of materials from brief messages and reports prepared in the field to extensive formal studies prepared by teams of researchers. During World War II the Army prepared technical manuals on certain items of enemy equipment; included information about enemy equipment in catalogs of enemy equipment and in handbooks about foreign forces; and published technical intelligence in various reports. U.S. Intelligence organizations Defense Intelligence Agency Headquarters MSIC NSA The primary agencies and organizations of the United States government that are involved in the production of TECHINT reports and all-source intelligence S&TI; are: *Defense Intelligence Agency, is the primary intelligence agency of the Department of Defense. It is charged with providing military intelligence to policymakers, war-fighters, and defense planners in the Department as well as to national-level consumers and the United States Intelligence Community. ** The Missile and Space Intelligence Center, Redstone Arsenal, AL, which is a unit of the Defense Intelligence Agency. MSIC is charged with producing scientific and technological intelligence on adversary surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and ballistic missile systems with ranges less than 1000 km. **National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI) at Fort Detrick, MD, which is a unit of the Defense Intelligence Agency. AFMIC is the only organization in the world with this comprehensive medical intelligence mission. As such, it has a diverse customer base, from operational and tactical commanders, preventive medicine personnel, and medical planners and researchers to the policymakers in the DoD, the White House staff and other federal agencies. *Military Services units **National Ground Intelligence Center, Albemarle County, VA, just north of Charlottesville, which is a subordinate to the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command. The NGIC provides scientific and technical intelligence (S& TI) and general military intelligence (GMI) on foreign ground forces in support of military commanders, force and materiel developers, Department of the Army, Department of Defense, and National-level decisionmakers. * National Air and Space Intelligence Center, Wright- Patterson, OH, which is subordinate to the US Air Force, Air Intelligence Agency. In an extension of TECHINT, predecessors of the National Air and Space Intelligence Center were involved in the search for Unidentified Flying Objects in the 1950s and 1960s. * A section in the Office of Naval Intelligence handles technical intelligence activities for the US Navy. Those activities were formerly carried out by the Naval Intelligence Service Center in Suitland, MD, and by its successor the Naval Technical Intelligence Center. *National intelligence units **National Security Agency, at Fort Meade, Maryland, does scientific and technical analysis on foreign communications and communications security equipment, as well as foreign research in these areas. Historical examples of field technical intelligence Limber Freya radar illustration See Operation Biting for information on a British raid to capture German radar for technical evaluation. R.V. Jones was the leading World War II British expert on electronic warfare. He was one of the primary analysts of the Oslo Report. US programs at the end of World War Two included Historical technical intelligence programs include Operation Paperclip, the general program directed at German scientists and engineers at the end of World War II. It is most often associated with rocket science. Other contemporary efforts included Operation Alsos, focusing on nuclear science and engineering and Operation Lusty, devoted to aerodynamics. Use of enemy material in the field Troops involved in technical intelligence operations have used knowledge of foreign material to put enemy equipment to use. For example, Army troops used German military telephone wire and medical supplies to aid civilians in France during World War II. Similarly, Joseph E. Smith, who edited Small Arms of the World in the 1960s, reported that the U.S. Army captured a large supply of German mortar ammunition in France during World War II. It was discovered that the German ammunition could be fired from US mortars. Troops in the field prepared a firing table for the American mortar firing German ammunition by test firing the German ammunition. Collection techniques at the national level In contrast with tactical technical intelligence, national level science and technology information tends to come less from capture of foreign equipment, and more from HUMINT or creative business relationships. There are some national-level attempts to salvage foreign equipment, such as Project Azorian, a complex and clandestine attempt to recover a sunken Soviet submarine. Scientific and technical espionage The US Economic Espionage Act of 1996 criminalizes two kinds of activity, which may be done either by foreign powers for (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1831‚Äì1839) makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. To some extent, the Act addresses an international problem, but not all countries regard unauthorized technology transfer as illegal, when done for commercial purposes. Technology transfer that involves militarily critical technologies are more commonly a matter This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity: #Theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers #Theft of trade secrets for commercial purposes Categorizing an individual act can be complex, as some national intelligence services have provided scientific and technical intelligence to private firms based in their countries. It becomes even more complex when the information is provided to an organization partially or fully owned by that government, and that organization competes in commercial markets. Other complexities arise when the information is not actually stolen, but where the foreign intelligence service (or business) buys one copy of a high-technology product, and then reverse engineers its technology to use in its own products. End user license agreements forbidding reverse engineering are common in software, but less so in other business areas. Violation of export controls may overlap with information acquisition, or the exported equipment or materials may themselves be things difficult for the offending country to produce. According to the US National Counterintelligence Executive (NCIX), 108 countries tried to obtain US technology in fiscal year 2005. Most of the effort, however, centered around a small number of countries. NCIX named China and Russia among this small number, \\"just as they have since the CI Community first began systematically tracking foreign technology collection efforts in 1997.\\" By no means, however, is the US the only target, nor are China and Russia the only countries trying to obtain such information. In 2003, Sweden expelled two Russian diplomats over accusations of spying at Ericsson, a major electronics manufacturer whose products include avionics for Swedish Gripen fighter aircraft. Even more sensitive, however, is scientific and technical information-gathering by allies, such as Japan, France, and Israel. =Efficiency of espionage activities= Porteous raises the question: is commercially oriented, economic/scientific/technical espionage efficient? He observes that some claim intelligence obtained through economic espionage would be \\"tactically useless\\" for a number of reasons. Typically, the barriers to potential efficiency are related to an intelligence agency's lack of knowledge of the subject area and to problems associated with the dissemination of intelligence once acquired. These arguments tend to come from individuals who at the same time argue for or accept the need for government to defend against economic espionage engaged in by other governments. It is difficult to support these points simultaneously: if economic espionage is \\"tactically useless\\", it is similarly useless to foreign governments that practice it, and thus need not be defended against. He counters the argument that \\"lack of direct knowledge of a certain business or its technology has been cited as a significant obstacle to intelligence services engaging in economic espionage. Yet during the Cold War, intelligence services spent significant amounts of time and energy, with some success, trying to obtain intelligence on various complex military technologies of which the case officers would not have had a profound knowledge. If intelligence services were trusted to obtain such information, a shift of focus to complex commercial technologies and intelligence would not be unthinkable. The same techniques used to obtain military secrets could be turned to complex commercial technologies or strategies without too much difficulty.\\" Another efficiency argument deals with the security of dissemination to industry. National characteristics will be different here; industry-government partnerships, for example, are far more routine in Japan than in the United States. US consortia have been open to foreign firms, and many have shut down, such as the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation and the Corporation for Open Systems (in OSI and ISDN) networking. Some, such as the Open Software Foundation merged with other groups and wound up being international. Porteous observed \\"the existence of means to reduce dissemination difficulties will not erase them. Problems will inevitably arise. Those countries considering engaging in or expanding their practice of economic espionage would be well-advised to consider the alleged experience of France in this area. It has recently been suggested that the embarrassing release of information indicating French intelligence service targeting of American companies, which triggered an American boycott of the Paris Airshow, was the work of disgruntled French firms. The companies responsible for releasing the material to the press apparently were unhappy with what they saw as the tendency of the French intelligence service, Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure (DGSE), to favour some French firms over others in distributing material obtained through economic espionage. The incident reportedly cooled relations between the DGSE and certain elements of French industry. =Espionage collection techniques= Perhaps most common are operations that exploit business relationships, including the marketing and sales phase. There are also efforts targeted at individuals with sensitive knowledge. The NCIX said the easiest techniques can be straightforward, including: *Simply asking companies for \\"classified, sensitive, or export- controlled information. In some cases, a single would-be foreign buyer sent out multiple requests to a variety of US companies, searching for a seller willing to ignore or bend export-licensing requirements.\\" *Joint ventures, perhaps not even on the target technology, but to bring intelligence collectors in contact with people or facilities with sensitive information. Offshoring work from the country with the technology, to other countries where protection may be more difficult, is another approach. *Offering support services to facilities or contractors with sensitive information. These can include technical support services such as assembly and testing, but also services as mundane as trash collection, hoping the trash may contain information inadequately shredded or otherwise destroyed. Even outsourced administrative services, such as payroll, can give clues to which individuals might be targets for approaches. *Conventions and trade shows, of course, offer information. It can be quite easy to enter a show for the \\"industry only\\", although more difficult if the event requires a verified security clearance. *Use of spyware or other malicious hacking techniques to penetrate information systems. Another category starts with agreements of which the hosting government is fully aware, but that may be enforced more or less stringently in specific cases: \\"Since the mid-1980s, development, production, and marketing of weapon systems has been increasingly internationalized through government-sponsored cooperative development programs and various kinds of industrial linkages, including international subcontracting and teaming arrangements, joint ventures, and cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Foreign companies have acquired many U.S. defense companies and have legitimate business interests in them. The U.S. government allows such foreign investment as long as it is consistent with U.S. national security interests.\\" Multinational programs may be even more common in Europe, such as Panavia (UK-Germany-Italy) and Airbus (Germany-France-Spain, but operating under Dutch law). There are also enterprises owned by a combination of industry and government, such as the French Thales Group. Foreign intelligence services, or foreign companies, may still try to recruit individuals. =Relation to economic intelligence= Given that scientific and technical information is an important part of a nation's competitive position in world markets, scientific and technical intelligence blurs into economic intelligence, which is defined by the U.S. government as \\"government-sponsored or coordinated intelligence activity designed to unlawfully and covertly obtain classified data and/or sensitive policy or proprietary information from a U.S. Government agency or company, potentially having the effect of enhancing a foreign country's economic competitiveness and damaging U.S. economic security.\\" Convicted CIA spy Aldrich Ames collected $4.6 million for selling classified information, on CIA activities, to the USSR and Russia. In contrast to the sale of government information, \\"Ronald Hoffman, a project manager for a company called Science Applications, Inc., made $750,000 by selling complex software programs that were developed under secret contract for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The CONTAM software tracks the plumes that rockets and missiles leave in their wake and, therefore, has both military and civilian applications. Hoffman sold his wares to Japanese multinationals-Nissan Motor Company, Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries ‚Äì that wanted the information for civilian aerospace programs. He was arrested in 1992.\\" Porteous identifies two kinds of economic intelligence that are distinct from S&TI;: :#trade negotiation intelligence :#macro-economic intelligence =Espionage examples at the national level= Nations often claim that each is trying to get economically significant scientific and technical information to file counterclaims of each spying on the other. One conflict comes from the fact that some normal business practices in other countries are considered illegal by the United States. Nations have different views of what constitutes offensive and defensive economic intelligence: \\"Decisions informed by the provision of economic intelligence range from determining whether to raise interest rates to the proper stance to take in contentious trade negotiations. This type of intelligence support to government decision-makers is generally accepted as a legitimate function of state intelligence services. Related intelligence services that go beyond the mere collection of information and aim to influence events directly, either at a macro-economic or firm level, are understandably more controversial. Citing a US example, Porteous describes a useful distinction: \\"... the CIA recently distinguished between *intelligence used to inform government policy-makers and *intelligence used to influence events at the firm level, to differentiate their economic intelligence activities in France from the direct industry-support activities in which French intelligence had engaged in the USA.\\" He cites the former category, intending to inform government officials, as where the CIA was allegedly supporting the formulation of American trade policy with regard to negotiations concerning audio-visual matters at the GATT. This was reportedly done through the provision of clandestinely obtained intelligence on the French bargaining position. The Americans argued that this support to government decision-makers was well within the bounds of tolerable espionage behaviour....\\" The Americans contrasted this with :alleged French intelligence activities in support of French commercial actors through directly transmitting clandestinely obtained proprietary information from American companies was not. In 1994, Porteous suggested that there may be a shift in the countries most eager to engage in this sort of intelligence gathering. \\"Early on, the French and the Russians were presented in most North American analyses as the primary practitioners of economic espionage. Now, in a realignment perhaps more attuned to today's geopolitical realities, this dubious status is being transferred to the Japanese and emerging Asian economies. In a recent article in the Far Eastern Economic Review, FBI officials stated 57 countries are running operations to obtain information out of Silicon Valley. These same officials were quoted as labelling Asian governments and multinationals, particularly Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, as the chief culprits.\\" There are differences in economic culture between Europe and Asia. Where European industry-government partnerships tend to be very formally defined, the Asian ones are more fluid. \\"The prospect of huge Asian multinational corporations, with their definite but elusive relationship with government, engaging in industrial or economic espionage, may open new debates on when and how intelligence services should intervene in these cases. For while European states move towards privatization (albeit retaining a \\"golden share\\") in many cases there is little sign of a lessening of links between business and government in the high growth communitarian societies of Asia. The imminent emergence of powerful Chinese multinationals out of the so-called \\"socialist market economy\\" of China will only increase this trend.\\" It can reasonably be surmised that there is a degree of economic intelligence gathering among most or all industrialized nations. Merely because a country, in the list below, complains of intelligence gathering against it should not be interpreted as meaning that country's intelligence service does not collect information from other countries.  Canada  Porteous mentions that in Montreal, two members of the Stasi, the former East German secret police, explained how they used phony work records from \\"sympathetic companies\\" to gain employment at targeted Canadian companies. He speculated, in 1993, \\"In the near future, it is conceivable that the UK would share more economic intelligence with fellow EC members than it would with Canada or the United States. On the other hand, the USA would be more likely to share its economic intelligence with its fellow FTA and NAFTA members.\\" While there has been no official Canadian statement about targeting scientific, technical and economic intelligence, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), the Canadian SIGINT agency, advertised for \\"university graduates for analyst positions noting that \\"graduation in fields such as economics, international business, commerce ... would be an asset\\".\\"  China  \\"China has also warned its people about foreigners seeking economic intelligence. (In this instance the Chinese government felt 1000-year-old remedies and ancient healing techniques required protection.)\\"  France  France and the US have accused one another of economic, scientific and technical espionage at the national level. A US senator, William Cohen, accused the French of hiding listening devices on Air France flights in order to pick up useful economic information from business travelers.\\"In 1993, the CIA warned U.S. aircraft manufacturers to be on the lookout for French spies at the Paris Air Show, and intelligence officials have claimed that France regularly sponsors the theft of information from U.S. companies.\\". France declared several US intelligence officers persona non grata for alleged US economic intelligence-gathering, although Knight stated the US denied the charges. France, according to Russell, also is a target. The French former intelligence official, Alexandre de Marenches described the Japanese as experts in economic espionage; that the Japanese government and industry have close ties with each other. The French intelligence agency, Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure (DGSE), studies Japanese intelligence operations abroad, trying to determine Japan's next technology target. According to de Marenches, Japan examines the global production situation, determines which country can satisfy their high- technology requirement, and then dispatches a collection delegation.  Germany  \\"German articles talk of American or French use of signals intelligence (SIGINT) capacity to eavesdrop on sensitive commercial transactions.\\"  Israel  Several sources describe Israel as having energetic programs in economic and S&TI.; According to a Command and General Staff College thesis, Israeli Air Force intelligence tried to steal 14 boxes of corporate data from Recon/Optical, Inc., a company that develops optics and semiconductors used in reconnaissance satellites. \\"Data the agents removed successfully, before their arrest, went to the laboratories of the Israeli company Electro-Optics Industries. The Government of Israel continues efforts to field a reconnaissance satellite with the services of a prime contractor‚ÄîElectro-OpticsIndustries.\\" Japan \\"In the early 1980s, the companies Hitachi and Fujitsu, and the government agency the Ministry for International Trade and Industry (MITI) were caught stealing corporate secrets from IBM, Cray, and Fairchild Semiconductors. A 1987 Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report \\"concluded that 80 percent of all Japanese government intelligence assets were directed toward the United States and Western Europe and concentrated on acquiring secrets about... technological developments.\\" As of 1994, \\"Japan operates its economic collection bureaucracy in a manner different from France. The Japanese government itself does not provide large amounts of intelligence to its corporations. Companies maintain their own extensive intelligence gathering assets. Instead, the Japanese government provides direction and money; it also collates the information provided to it by companies. Government agencies, the Ministry for International Trade and Industry (MITI) and the Japanese External Trade Organization (JETRO), coordinate national economic collection priorities, provide access to foreign countries (through trade offices), and channel the intelligence they do collect to the appropriate industry. JETRO operates 77 offices in 59 countries; its agents collect economic and technical information and forward it to MITI. According to Japan: 2000, a report commissioned by the CIA, \\"Japan's elaborate system for political and economic intelligence is conducted through the various trading companies down to the office level.\\"\\" Republic of Korea (South Korea) \\"South Korea's equivalent of the CIA, the National Security Planning Agency, places operatives in Korean companies like Hyundai, Samsung, and the Lucky Group. The companies then post the agents to foreign countries to forge close contacts with their industrial counterparts to gather technical and financial information.\\" Former Soviet Union and Russia \\"To address the lag in technology, Soviet authorities in 1970 reconstituted and invigorated the USSR's intelligence collection for science and technology. The Council of Ministers and the Central Committee established a new unit, Directorate T of the KGB's First Chief Directorate, to plumb the R&D; programs of Western economies. The State Committee on Science and Technology and the Military-Industrial Commission were to provide Directorate T and its operating arm, called Line X, with collection requirements. Military Intelligence (GRU), the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the State Committee for External Relations completed the list of participants. The bulk of collection was to be done by the KGB and the GRU, with extensive support from the East European intelligence services e.g. in Poland Departament I MSW ‚Äì Wydzia≈Ç Naukowo- Techniczny. A formidable apparatus was set up for scientific espionage; the scale of this structure testified to its importance. The coming of d√©tente provided access for Line X and opened new avenues for exploitation.\\" \\"In June of 1994, Russian presidential aide Yuriy Baturin accused Asian countries, particularly China and North Korea, of economic espionage.\\" United Kingdom Reuter's stories from Britain make similar claims involving a middle-eastern power and a multibillion-dollar arms deal the UK was bidding on. \\"The concept of \\"economic well-being\\" used above is also found in the British Intelligence Services Act, 1994. The act discloses for the first time the functions of the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) with regard to the economic and commercial interests of the state. According to the Act, under the authority of the Secretary of State, the functions of SIS include obtaining and providing information as well as performing \\"other tasks\\" relating to the actions or intentions of \\"persons outside the British Isles\\". These functions of SIS, like those of GCHQ, are to be exercised only in the interests of national security, prevention or detection of serious crime and, most importantly from the point of view of this article, \\"in the interests of the economic well- being of the UK\\".\\" United States The United States suffers from a degree of conflict, in that it is sensitive to economic espionage against US companies, but it also objects to those companies using business practices, routine in other countries, that are considered corrupt domestically. \\"The United States is the only member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to pass legislation ‚Äî the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ‚Äî criminalizing the payment of a bribe to a foreign official. The legislation arose out of the American bribery scandals of the 1970s. These restraints, which are extraterritorial in scope, have proven a constant irritant to Americans doing business abroad. According to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the legislation costs American companies \\"hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts every year\\". Not surprisingly, the USA is particularly upset about the practice engaged in by some countries of not only turning a blind eye to bribery by their own nationals but recognizing these same bribes as tax-deductible business expenses. The Clinton administration has not been encouraged by progress in lobbying fellow OECD members to pass domestic legislation mirroring America's, or to agree to an enforceable international code condemning the practice. In the absence of any international support for these initiatives, American commercial interests have been pressuring their government either to change the international regime or to rescind the legislation. \\"Unwilling to rescind, the Clinton administration turned to the CIA.\\" Former Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey distinguished between what is licit for the US government and illicit for companies: \\"I... reserve the term industrial espionage to mean espionage for the direct benefit of an industry. ... I don't call it industrial espionage if the United States spies on a European corporation to find out if it is bribing its way to contracts in Asia or Latin America that it can't win honestly.\\" \\" =Statements of current and past US officials about economic intelligence collection= \\"Former United States Central Intelligence Agency director James Woolsey confirmed in Washington... that the US steals economic secrets \\"with espionage, with communications [intelligence], with reconnaissance satellites\\", and that there was now \\"some increased emphasis\\" on economic intelligence. He claimed that economic spying was justified because European companies had a \\"national culture\\" of bribery and were the \\"principle offenders from the point of view of paying bribes in major international contracts in the world\\". Responding to the European Parliament report on interception capabilities and the Echelon satellite surveillance system, Woolsey said that the \\"Interception Capabilities 2000\\" report which had been presented to the parliament's Citizens' Rights Committee on 23 February, was \\"intellectually honest\\". In two cases cited in the report, \\"the fact [is] that the subject of American intelligence collection was bribery.\\" \\"That's correct\\", he told a packed audience of foreign press journalists...We have spied on that in the past. I hope... that the United States government continues to spy on bribery.\\" Woolsey continued, \\"Whether economic or military, most US intelligence data came from open sources, he said. But \\"five percent is essentially secrets that we steal. We steal secrets with espionage, with communications, with reconnaissance satellites.\\" Explaining his view that Europe was the main centre of world industrial bribery, he asked \\"Why... have we in the past from time to time targeted foreign corporations and government assistance to them?... Some of our oldest friends and allies have a national culture and a national practice such that bribery is an important part of the way they try to do business in international commerce.... The part of the world that where this culture of getting contracts through bribery, that actually has a great deal of money, and is active in international contracting is to a first approximation Europe\\". \\"[...] The principal offenders, from the point of view of paying bribes in major international contracts in the world, are Europe. And indeed, they are some of the very same companies ‚Äì the companies are in some of the very same countries where the most recent flap has arisen about alleged American industrial espionage.\\" Woolsey, when newly Director of Central Intelligence in 1993, publicly announced that economic intelligence was now a CIA program. French intelligence had been aggressively going after information from American executives. Woolsey said \\"No more Mr. Nice Guy.\\" In a statement in 1995 entitled \\"A National Security Strategy of Engagement and Enlargement\\", President Bill Clinton detailed just what his administration expected from American intelligence with regard to protecting or pursuing American economic interests To adequately forecast dangers to democracy and to U.S. economic well-being, the intelligence community must track political, economic, social and military developments in those parts of the world where U.S. interests are most heavily engaged and where overt collection of information from open sources is inadequate. Economic intelligence will play an increasingly important role in helping policy-makers understand economic trends. Economic intelligence can support U.S. trade negotiators and help level the economic playing field by identifying threats to U.S. companies from foreign intelligence services and unfair trading practices. =Expert inference about economic intelligence collection by the US= According to Porteous, [Clinton's] statement clearly envisages the use of clandestine methods to obtain this intelligence where \\"overt collection... from open sources is inadequate\\". Russell observes \\"France and Japan provide illustrative examples of foreign governments' actions. \\"It is this direct link between government and business that some individuals propose to establish between the U.S.Government and U.S. businesses. Anticipated rewards of such a relationship include: reduced product research and development (R&D;) timelines, reduced R&D; costs, accelerated time from R&D; to product marketing, and the receipt of lucrative contracts by undercutting a competitor using inside knowledge of his bid and terms. In sum, any benefit gained in these areas has the potential to increase profits.\\" See also *All-source intelligence *Basic intelligence *Geospatial intelligence *Technology transfer References Further reading  *US Army Technical Manual TM E9-369A.

At the 2010 census the population was 8,226, of whom 5,156 lived in the larger Hennepin County part of the city and 3,070 in the Ramsey County part. The city is run by a five- member council consisting of a mayor and four council members who serve four- year terms. St. Anthony was also the name of Minneapolis's older twin city, across from downtown Minneapolis on the Mississippi River's east bank. Minneapolis and St. Anthony merged in 1872. There is also a city named St. Anthony in Stearns County. History Signage to the city St. Anthony's origins date to 1838, when Franklin Steele, a storekeeper at Fort Snelling, made a claim on the land east of St. Anthony Falls. Steele did not begin developing the land until 1848, but it quickly became a center of milling and trade much like the neighboring town of Minneapolis on the land west of the falls. In 1858 the town was formally organized as the Township of St. Anthony. In 1872, Minneapolis annexed most of St. Anthony (much of present-day Northeast Minneapolis). Roughly of mostly agricultural land north of the city retained the name St. Anthony but remained unincorporated. In 1945, the township's residents voted 167‚Äì57 in favor of incorporating as a village. The state challenged this decision on the basis that St. Anthony was too agricultural and rural, but it was upheld by the Minnesota Supreme Court. As the city's suburbs grew outward, St. Anthony evolved from a rural township to an inner suburb. St. Anthony was the home of Apache Plaza, the tenth indoor shopping mall in United States, which opened in October 1961. The second oldest, Southdale, lay only to the south and was completed in October 1956. Built in the 1950s, the St. Anthony Shopping Center was Minnesota's first strip mall and was owned by the Batista family of Cuba.St. Anthony ‚Äì Did You Know?

Located to the southeast of the region, along the Woluwe valley and at the entrance to the Sonian Forest (French: , Dutch: ), the municipality has an environmental advantage. Despite large roads slicing through and the increasing traffic, it has been able to preserve a relatively important part of its natural and historic legacy: the creeks, the Red Cloister Abbey and its art centre, the Priory of Val-Duchesse, the Ch√¢teau of Three Fountains (French: , Dutch: ), the Ch√¢teau of Saint Anne, and the remarkable Chapel of Saint Anne. Auderghem is adjacent to the municipalities of Etterbeek, Ixelles, Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, and Watermael-Boitsfort. In common with all of Brussels‚Äô municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French‚ÄìDutch). The municipality is governed by its 16th mayor, Didier Gosuin (FDF).  History  Three forest villages (Auderghem, Watermael, and Boitsfort-Bosvoorde), were one for centuries. In 1794, the soldiers of the French Revolution decided to separate these into three distinct municipalities. In 1811, Napoleon decided to reunite the three villages, by imperial decree, into a single administrative entity. But Auderghem was withdrawn from this union by royal act, leaving Watermael- Boitsfort on its own. Thus, Auderghem became an independent municipality in 1863, with only 1,600 inhabitants. With the construction of the rail line linking Brussels and Tervuren as well as, in 1910, the construction of /, modernisation came to the municipality and the population grew quickly. In 1956, Paul Henri Spaak lead the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at the Ch√¢teau of Val-Duchesse in Auderghem, which prepared the Treaties of Rome in 1957 and the foundation of the European Economic Community and Euratom in 1958. Demographics As of 2004 the majority of Brussels' Japanese expatriate population lives in Auderghem. State, Paul F. Historical Dictionary of Brussels. Scarecrow Press, July 27, 2004. , 9780810865556. p. 21. Sights The Priory of Val-Duchesse, a gift of the Belgian King, is rarely open to the public. In 1963, Belgium's cabinet ministers met there, planting the seeds of a federalisation of the country though at conditions fiercely criticised especially in some extremist Flemish nationalist circles. Similarly, the Chapel of Saint Anne, whose origins go back to the 12th century, is not open to the public. Decommissioned in 1843, it was sold several times. Its splendid sculptures from the Middle Ages and notable period furniture are still there to admire. The municipality offers many green spaces.

The gallery receives core funding from the New Plymouth District Council. Govett-Brewster is recognised internationally for contemporary art. History The gallery opened on 22 February 1970, in the old Regent cinema building converted by New Plymouth architect, Terry Boon. The gallery trust was established with funds gifted by Monica Brewster (n√©e Govett, 1886‚Äì1973).  1998 extension  The gallery opened an extension designed by New Plymouth firm Boon Cox Goldsmith Jackson in 1998. The extension was principally undertaken to provide exhibition and storage space for the Len Lye Foundation Collection along with a dedicated education space. Len Lye Centre Len Lye Centre, New Plymouth The Len Lye Centre is an extension to the Govett-Brewster, built to display the works of Len Lye. It was designed by Andrew Patterson of Pattersons Associates, New Zealand. It is home to the archives and studio collection of the Len Lye Foundation. Born in Christchurch in 1901 and largely self-educated, Len Lye was driven by a lifelong passion for motion, energy and the possibility of composing them as a form of art. Lye's interests took him far from New Zealand; after sojourns in the South Pacific, Lye moved to London and then New York, where he became known as an intensely creative film-maker and kinetic sculptor. The Len Lye Centre was opened on 25 July 2015. This is the first gallery in New Zealand to be dedicated to a single artist.

He is the founder and artistic director of Black Grace, a modern dance company formed in 1995. Black Grace has toured extensively in New Zealand and internationally including Australia, USA and The Netherlands. Ieremia has also choreographed work for the Royal New Zealand Ballet, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Opera New Zealand, New Zealand Wearable Arts and the Holland Dance Festival. Born in New Zealand, Ieremia is of Samoan heritage. Awards and honours In 2005, Ieremia received the prestigious Laureate Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand for outstanding creative achievement. In 2015 he was awarded the Senior Pacific Artist Award at the Creative New Zealand Arts Pasifka Awards. In the 2016 Queen's Birthday Honours, Ieremia was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to dance. Background Born in Cannons Creek, Porirua, Wellington, Ieremia graduated from the Auckland Performing Arts School, before joining the acclaimed Douglas Wright Dance Company, performing in the major works Gloria, A Far Cry, Forever, How on Earth and Buried Venus. He subsequently worked with other leading choreographers in New Zealand. After forming Black Grace in 1995, he choreographed all of the company's major full-length works and created the concepts behind New Works and UrbanYOUTHMovement. Black Grace was made up predominantly of male Pacific Island and MƒÅori dancers. Black Grace has toured extensively throughout the main centres and regional New Zealand, including sold out performances at the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts. They have performed right across Australia including the Festival of Dreaming, Sydney and UWA Perth International Arts Festival. In 2003, Black Grace toured The Netherlands, performing at the Holland Dance Festival. In the same year, Ieremia received a nomination for the prestigious international Rolex Mentor Programme. In 2004, Black Grace debuted in the USA, at the world-renowned dance festival at Jacob's Pillow. > \\"He has spread his artistic roots in several rich pasts and grown up and out > into a sunlight of his own making.\\" The New York Times, 2004 In 2005, Black Grace's two Auckland seasons, New Works 2005 and 10 ‚Äì A Decade of Works by Neil Ieremia sold out. The company performed Ieremia's works at the World Expo, Aichi and Tokyo, Japan; returned to Jacob's Pillow to perform on the main stage; a four-week season in New York's New Victory Theater; a week at the prestigious Cervantino Festival, Mexico and a tour of Hawai'i. In 2007, The Grass Roots Tour took the company to regional centres in the North Island. In 2008, the company performed at WOMAD as well as Ieremia presenting a short works programme in North America and Canada. In 2009, a major new work Gathering Clouds choreographed by Ieremia, premiered at the Auckland Festival. Gathering Clouds was a response to controversial claims made in 2008 by Massey University lecturer Dr Greg Clydesdale. The Dominion Post newspaper falsely reported that Dr Clydesdale said Pacific Island immigrants are a \\"drain on the economy\\". Samoan heritage Born in New Zealand and of Samoan heritage, Ieremia's work embodies three important Samoan principles: Fa'amaoni (integrity, honesty and pride), Fa'amalosi/Loto Tele (perseverance and determination) and Fa'aaloalo (humility and respect). Ieremia's father, a Samoan, is the cultural adviser for Black Grace.

Geography of the German Democratic Republic, VEB Hermann Haack, Gotha, pp. 32 ff. . () is a depression in the central and northwest part of Thuringia in Germany which is crossed by several rivers, the longest of which is the Unstrut. It stretches about from north to south and around from east to west. Its height varies from about 150 to . The Basin is surrounded by a wide outer girdle of limestone (Muschelkalk) ridges (including Hainich, D√ºn, Hainleite, Hohe Schrecke, Schm√ºcke, Finne), and to the southwest by the Thuringian Forest and to the southeast by sharply divided terraces (the Ilm-Saale and Ohrdruf Muschelkalk plateaus, and the Saale-Elster Bunter sandstone plateau). The Thuringian Basin belongs to the triassic period, during which horizontal beds of Bunter sandstone, Muschelkalk and Keuper were laid down. Below those lie the salt and gypsum layers of Magnesian Limestone (Zechstein). In the Cenozoic era the surrounding ridges were uplifted, whilst the Thuringian Basin sank to form a saucer-shaped depression. The elevation of the Thuringian Basin descends from the south and west to the east. While some of the marginal ridges have the character of low mountain ranges, there are no really noteworthy uplands within it, apart from the Ettersberg and Fahnerscher H√∂he. The Thuringian Basin is dominated by agriculture. Along with the Magdeburg B√∂rde and Leipzig Bay it is one of the richest arable lands in Germany. It was settled in the 8th and 9th century which makes most of the villages and towns in the basin well over 1000 years old. As a result of the fertile countryside, large cities were established very early on in the Basin and on its perimeter (Erfurt and the free imperial city of M√ºhlhausen). Other towns in the Thuringian Basin are (year of foundation and year of achieving town status in brackets): *Schlotheim (974/1277) *Ebeleben (1198/1928) *Gro√üenehrich *Greu√üen/Clingen (?/1353 and 860/1282) to the north, *Kindelbr√ºck (775/1291) *Wei√üensee (?/1265) *S√∂mmerda (876/1350) *K√∂lleda (786/1392) *Rastenberg (1294/1412) *Buttst√§dt (?/1331) *Buttelstedt (780/1454) *Neumark (1179/1326) to the east, *Gebesee (786/1638) *Bad Tennstedt (772/1340) *Bad Langensalza (932/1212) in the centre *Gotha (775/?) in the south Large parts of the Basin in the former Thuringian Landgraviate were held by the House of Wettin from 1264 and, after the 1485 Treaty of Leipzig, formed the Thuringian Circle of the Saxon Electorate. Smaller areas used to belong to the Wettin Ernestine duchies and the County of Schwarzburg; the city of Erfurt was a possession of the Mainz Archbishops. According to the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Albertine and Mainz lands passed to the Kingdom of Prussia, while the smaller areas on the northern and southern rim formed the Thuringian states.

Originally the ticket was issued in Britain and later adapted by the United States, Canada, and Ireland. Jurisdictions=Australia= The ticket of leave system was first introduced by Governor Philip Gidley King in 1801. Its principal aim was to reduce the burden on the fledgling colonial government of providing food from the government's limited stores to the convicts who were being transported from the United Kingdom to Australia and its colonies of New South Wales and Tasmania. Convicts who seemed able to support themselves were awarded a ticket of leave. Before too long, tickets began to be given as a reward for good behaviour, which permitted the holders to seek employment within a specified district, but not leave it without the permission of the government or the district's resident magistrate. Each change of employer or district was recorded on the ticket. Originally the ticket of leave was given without any relation to the period of the sentence a convict had already served. Some \\"gentlemen convicts\\" were issued with tickets on their arrival in the colony. Starting in 1811, the need to first officiate some time in servitude was established, and in 1821 Governor Brisbane introduced regulations specifying the lengths of sentences that had to be served before a convict could be considered for a ticket: four years for a seven-year sentence, six to eight years for a 14-year sentence, and 10 to 12 years for those with a life sentence. Once the full original sentence had been served, a \\"certificate of freedom\\" would be issued upon application. If a life sentence had been given, then the convict could get a ticket to leave and/or conditional or full pardon. Ticket-of-leave holders were permitted to marry, or to bring their families from Britain, and to acquire property, but they were not permitted to carry firearms or board a ship. Convicts who observed the conditions of the ticket of leave until the completion of one half of their sentence were entitled to a conditional pardon, which removed all restrictions except a ban on leaving the colony. Convicts who did not observe the conditions of their ticket could be arrested without warrant, tried without recourse to the Supreme Court, and would forfeit their property. The ticket of leave had to be renewed annually, and those with one had to attend muster and church services. NSW Colonial Government - 1846 Convict Ticket of Leave Passport The ticket itself was a highly detailed document, listing the place and year the convict was tried, the name of the ship in which he or she was transported, and the length of the sentence. There was also a complete physical description of the convict, along with year of birth, former occupation and \\"native place\\". A ticket had two components: The \\"ticket proper\\" was issued to the person named, and it was mandatory for the person to carry that document on their person at all times. The second component was the \\"butt\\", which was the official copy and was kept on file by the Government. Tickets proper are now quite rare as they were in constant use by the holder. The butts are still retained in archival records and are available for researchers. According to Alexander Maconochie, tickets of leave could be suspended in summary fashion for the most \\"trifling irregularities,\\" and a \\"very large proportion\\" of ticket-of- leave holders were returned to government work as a result. =British military= In the Second World War, the \\"ticket of leave\\" was a colloquial name given to the papers allowing a soldier to take leave from active service. =Canada= On 11 August 1899, An Act to Provide for the Conditional Liberation of Convicts - the Ticket of Leave Act - was enacted by the Canadian Parliament. The Canadian Ticket of Leave Act was based almost word for word on the British legislation. There was no reference in the text to the purpose of conditional release, though ticket of leave was generally understood to be a form of pardon. In the beginning, the Governor General granted paroles on the advice of Cabinet as a whole. The act was later amended so that the power to advise the Governor General was limited to the Minister of Justice. This was a significant departure from traditional practice in the use of executive clemency; it was an attempt to separate parole decisions from politics. Even so, because conditional release was still in the hands of an elected minister, public opinion would still have a strong, and sometimes questionable, influence on policy. In the early 20th century, Canada was sparsely settled. Keeping track of men on tickets of leave was difficult and the authorities relied on parolees to report every month to the police. This had its drawbacks, and when the Salvation Army offered to take over parole supervision in some places, the Department of Justice was glad to accept. Salvation Army officers acted as Dominion Parole Officers until the position was abolished in 1931. On 7 March 1939, Bill C-34 was passed, revising the Penitentiary Act and creating an administrative board of three. =Ireland= Walter Crofton administered the Irish ticket of leave system.

She was completed in 1986 as MS Niels Klim and served on the DSB √Örhus ‚Äì Kalundborg along with her sister MS Peder Paars until 1991. Concept and construction In September 1983 DSB ordered two relatively large ferries for service on the intra-Denmark √Örhus‚ÄìKalundborg route from in Nakskov, Denmark. Although ordered by the ferry division of the Danish State Railways, the ships did not have the facilities for transporting trains, but were constructed to transport road freight and passengers. Both ships were named after characters from the works of Ludvig Holberg, a Norwegian-born writer considered to be the father of modern Danish literature. First of the ships, delivered in 1985, was named MS Peder Paars after the poem Peder Paars. The second, delivered a year later, was named MS Niels Klim after the protagonist in Niels Klim's Underground Travels. Early career That year both ships were taken over by Stena Line. The Peder Paars was renamed MS Stena Invicta and served on the Dover ‚Äì Calais route for most of the 90s. The Niels Klim was renamed MS Stena Nautica but spent most of 1991 laid up in √Örhus. In 1992, she was chartered to B&I; Line for use on their Irish Sea services and was renamed MS Isle Of Innisfree; Initially she served Pembroke Dock ‚Äì Rosslare and later Holyhead ‚Äì Dublin. However, her slow service speed of 17 knots frequently resulted in delays. Current operations In 1995, she returned to Stena Line and operated on their Lion Ferry subsidiary between Varberg / Halmstad and Gren√•. She has since remained on that route, despite occasional charters, the closure of the Halmstad leg and the incorporation of Lion Ferry into Stena Line. In 2002, she was rebuilt in order to transport more freight. Her lower passenger deck was converted into another vehicle deck, and her passenger certification was subsequently reduced from 2000 to 653, while her freight capacity increased from 604 lane meters to 1235. Collision On 16 February 2004, MS Stena Nautica had a mid channel collision with the freight ship, MS Joanna, in heavy fog. The Nautica was holed just above the engine room and took on a significant amount of water. Fortunately, sea conditions were calm, which meant the event could have been much worse. All passengers were evacuated to MS Stena Germanica. The Nautica was eventually towed to Varberg, and later to Gothenburg and Gda≈Ñsk for repairs. She reentered service four months later.  Fire  On 24 January 2013 the Swedish Baltic Sea ferry has broken out in the early morning as the fire rescue headquarters in Gothenburg. On board was at the time of the fire, 77 passengers and 40 crew members. The truck erupted in a fire on the car deck and it was fast under control. The fire was not able to spread.

The determination of what is \\"obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy\\" is up to a jury in a trial, which must apply the Miller test; however, due to the prominence of pornography in most communities most pornographic materials are not considered \\"patently offensive\\" in the Miller test. In 1967, Denmark decriminalized pornography with few adverse effects, and the following year, the United States Supreme Court held that people could view whatever they wished in the privacy of their own homes. These two developments contributed in part to Congress creating the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography in 1968 to investigate the effects of obscenity and pornography on the people of the United States. Each member of the Commission was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In what became the most detailed and comprehensive investigation into pornography to date, the Commission in its final report found that pornography could not be shown to do harm to individuals or to society, and recommended the repeal of obscenity and pornography legislation as it related to adults. Released during the presidency of Richard Nixon, the report generated a brief bout of controversy but was ultimately ignored by the administration. Attorney General for Ronald Reagan Edwin Meese also courted controversy when he appointed the \\"Meese Commission\\" to investigate pornography in the United States; their report, released in July 1986, was highly critical of pornography and itself became a target of widespread criticism. That year, Meese Commission chairman Alan Sears sent letters on Commission letterhead to the heads of 23 convenience store chains and other companies, declaring that the Commission would find that they were distributors of pornography and threatening that they would be listed as such in the final Report. In fact, the list of purported distributors had been identified by Donald Wildmon, the head of the conservative Christian advocacy organization that later became the American Family Association. The letters triggered several companies to remove common soft-core pornography magazines as Playboy and Penthouse from store shelves. The American Booksellers Association, the Council for Periodical Distributors Associations, the Magazine Publishers of America, and the publishers of Playboy and Penthouse sued, arguing that the letters constituted prior restraint and were forbidden under the First Amendment. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia agreed, leading it to admonish the Commission order it to withdraw the letter, and forbid it to issue any list of retailers in the report. In the United States in 2005, George W. Bush's Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made obscenity and pornography a top prosecutorial priority of the Department of Justice. The conservative religious organization Concerned Women for America polled every U.S. attorney's office to find out what they planned to do about obscenity. Except for a handful of offices that didn't return calls, not one said it had any inclination to pursue anything other than child obscenity cases. See also *Miller v.

They released their debut album, The Audacity of Hype in October 2009. Biography Inspired by Iggy Pop's 60th birthday gig at the Warfield in San Francisco, Biafra laid plans for his own 50th birthday party and finally decided it was time to start a band of his own. Ten years before he had been attempting the same thing with the likes of guitarist Ralph Spight (Victims Family, Freak Accident, Hellworms) and drummer Jon Weiss (Sharkbait, Horsey). They had also previously worked with bassist Billy Gould (Faith No More) who was tapped for the new group. After cramming rehearsal for a month the four piece band known as Jello Biafra and the Axis Of Merry Evildoers took the stage in a sold-out two night stand at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall and subsequently spent the next 9 months in rehearsal for an album project. Before entering the studio guitarist Kimo Ball (Freak Accident, Carneyball Johnson, Mol Triffid, Griddle) was recruited and the resulting twin guitar attack took the groups sound to new, noisier heights. The quintet now known as Jello Biafra and The Guantanamo School of Medicine began recording tracks for the upcoming LP/CD \\"The Audacity Of Hype\\" slated for release in October 2009, produced by Biafra and engineered by Hip Hop legend and long time Jello co-conspirator Matt Kelley (Hieroglyphics, Tupac Shakur, Digital Underground, Victims Family) at Prairie Sun Recording in Cotati, CA and San Francisco's Hyde Street Studios. The band's sound retains some of the spy- music-on-meth chaos of the Dead Kennedys while adding a healthy dose of Detroit style proto-punk mixed with layers of sonic guitar noise, and Weiss' industrial excursions into metal percussion. Topically, the album explores what Biafra describes as the nation's \\"forced Iraqnophobia and Homeland Insecurity\\" continues to feed lawlessness by political leaders such as in the song \\"The Terror of Tiny Town.\\" Other songs criticize a perceived police state and class war towards the bottom, for example in the songs \\"Three Strikes\\" and \\"Electronic Plantation.\\" \\"Clean As A Thistle\\" evokes family values blowhards caught in sinful trysts, while album closer \\"I Won't Give Up\\" offers an age of Obama anthem on how change comes from agitation from below, not glamor and soundbites from the top. In 2010, Jon's brother, Andrew Weiss (Rollins Band, Ween, Butthole Surfers), temporarily filled the bass position for live performances while Billy Gould took part in the Faith No More reunion tour. As placed here, text released under GFDL and CC-BY-SA. The band's second release, an EP titled Enhanced Methods of Questioning, was released on May 31, 2011. Controversy for the band arose after news was released of the band's decision to play in Tel Aviv, Israel on 2 July 2011. Biafra received much criticism from the left and punk community in light of an artistic boycott of Israel put forward by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign in 2005. On the 29 June 2011, Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine announced that their controversial show in Tel Aviv, Israel, was cancelled. In 2012, the band, now officially including Andrew Weiss on bass and Paul Della Pelle on drums, entered the studio.

Aguiar was recognized as a philanthropist who supported a variety of Jewish causes including Nefesh B'Nefesh and the March of the Living.ASHER ZEIGER and JTA, Body feared to be that of Guma Aguiar found on Florida coast, June 22, 2012, Retrieved December 4, 2013 In July 2009, Aguiar invested over $4 million (USD) in support of the Beitar Jerusalem Football Club. On June 20, 2012, Aguiar was reported missing after his unoccupied boat was found on Fort Lauderdale Beach. The day before Aguiar went missing, a federal court judge ordered his mental health records be presented to the court as part of a lawsuit between him and his uncle Thomas Kaplan. Aguiar was declared legally dead in January 2015. Early life and education Aguiar was born on May 31, 1977http://www.flpd.org/Home/ShowDocument?id=2568 in Rio de Janeiro. He was one of four children of Ellen ( Kaplan), a Jewish mother,Florida Sun Sentinel: \\"Turmoil and depression haunted missing Fort Lauderdale millionaire Aguiar\\" By Linda Trischitta and Robert Nolin June 30, 2012 and Otto de Souza Aguiar, a Christian father. His mother is the sister of billionaire investor Thomas Kaplan, and his father was an artist and model. Though Ellen is halachically Jewish, she considers herself a born-again Christian; Guma was raised as a Christian and the rest of the Aguiar family practiced Christianity as well. At age 26, Aguiar returned to Jewish observance after meeting rabbi Tovia Singer. However, because he was born to an halachically Jewish mother, he did not need to formally convert. His family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida when Aguiar was one year old. He graduated from the Westminster Academy Christian School in 1995. Aguiar enrolled at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina but dropped out after one year. Career Aguiar was the vice chairman and chief executive officer of Leor Energy. Aguiar began his career as a clerk on the floor of the NYMEX in 1999 where he focused on the energy markets, with particular emphasis on natural gas. Transitioning from daily trading activity to the long-term physical markets, Aguiar joined with his uncle, Thomas Kaplan, in 2001 to manage a portfolio of family investments ranging from venture capital to private equity and debt. During this time, he served as a director of several public and private companies and was given responsibility for creating a U.S.-based energy company focused on aggressive early-stage oil and gas exploration. After assembling a diversified portfolio of energy properties in Louisiana and Texas, ranging from unconventional natural gas to shallow oil, Aguiar identified and executed Leor's acquisition of its flagship property in the Deep Bossier of East Texas in 2003. In 2005, under Aguiar's executive management, Leor Energy engineered financings which fully capitalized the projects in Leor Energy LP. Included in these transactions were Leor Energy Lp industrial alliance with Encana, a natural gas producer in North America and the Leor Energy Lp joint-venture partner in the Deep Bossier. Under Aguiar, a mezzanine financing with hedge-fund Amaranth Capital LLC was achieved. Leor Energy has a financial alliance with its first strategic equity partner, Goldman Sachs & Co. Aguiar joined Cadence Resources in July 2002 and served as a Member of the Board of Directors of Corporate Development until June 30, 2003. Philanthropic activities Aguiar was the director of the Lillian Jean Kaplan Foundation and was involved in numerous philanthropic activities. He donated more than US$8 million to fund the activities of Nefesh B'Nefesh, a Zionist organization which promotes Aliyah (Jewish immigration) from North America and the United Kingdom to Israel. He was a supporter of the March of the Living, which organizes educational programming in Poland and Israel to enable students to better understand the Holocaust and the rebirth of Zionism and the creation of the modern Jewish state of Israel. For his philanthropic activities, in April 2009, The Jewish Week recognized Aguiar as one of the \\"36 under 36‚Ä≥ (one of 36 of the most influential Jewish leaders under the age of 36). In 2008, Aguiar founded the \\"Defender of Jerusalem Award\\" which recognizes public figures who have taken uniquely strong stances in support of Jerusalem. In October 2009, Aguiar and his wife Jamie served as the co-chairs of the \\"Facing Tomorrow\\" Conference in Jerusalem organized by Israel's President Shimon Peres. During the conference, Aguiar was featured on a panel with the President and offered his vision of Israeli society and culture from the perspective of one of the country's most recognized entrepreneurs. Jerusalem sports On July 21, 2009, Aguiar announced an investment of over US$4 million to support the Beitar Jerusalem Football Team which, despite a massive fan following, had grown into financial distress and was on the brink of collapse prior to Aguiar's financial contributions. Aguiar was motivated to purchase the team out of his love for the sport combined with a passion for Jerusalem and Israel. In September 2009, Aguiar took his commitment to Jerusalem sports to the next level when he invested over $1.5 million in the city's leading basketball franchise, Hapoel Jerusalem. Since these investments, Aguiar became a fixture in Israeli social circles and regularly met with members of Knesset and local political and business leaders. Aguiar managed the teams and was in contact with the general managers of both Betar (Itzik Kornfein) and Hapoel (Dani Klein). In November 2009, Aguiar travelled with Kornfein to Brazil with the goal of scouting out players for the Betar team. He made an effort to be at team practices and met with the players and staff of both teams. Beitar fans attribute Beitar's winning the Toto Cup on 26 January 2010 to Aguiar's financial backing, although it was won while Aguiar was hospitalized in a psychiatric facility. About a half an hour after winning, Itzik Kornfein took the Toto Cup to the psychiatric hospital but was not permitted to enter. He asked the security staff to take in the trophy to the hospitalized Aguiar. Personal life In 2005, Aguiar married his Westminster Academy high school sweetheart, Jamie Elizabeth Black. Jamie graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in Public Relations. They had four children. Jacob, Lilly, Jonathan, and Leo The process of immigration to Israel was an act described by himself as a personal dream. Prior to his disappearance, Aguiar divided his time between the Yemin Moshe quarter in Jerusalem and South Florida. Aguiar was friends with Alan Dershowitz. Aguiar was a Zionist. Criminal history Aguiar pleaded no contest to drug charges in 2009 after police found marijuana in his car during a traffic stop in Florida. Aguiar publicly stated that the police were out to get him and that \\"When I got to the prison [an officer] took my kippah off and then tried to convert me to Christianity.\\" Aguiar hired Alan Dershowitz to represent him. Aguiar's wife Jamie filed a domestic violence protective order against him in the summer of 2011. He then filed for divorce, but both the domestic violence allegations and the divorce filing were stopped. Mental health Aguiar's mother has said that Aguiar experienced his first psychotic episode at age 19 and that he was diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder and psychosis. Aguiar was admitted to psychiatric hospitals several times. On January 14, 2010, Aguiar was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital in Israel by his mother. In 2011, due to his mental illness, his wife Jamie and mother Ellen petitioned a Miami-Dade judge for guardianship over Aguiar. The court agreed, and appointed an emergency guardianship over Aguiar. Two days after his disappearance in June 2012, Aguiar's mother filed documents in Broward County, Florida court to become conservator of his nearly $100 million fortune. In Ellen Aguiar's petition, she wrote that Guma \\"disappeared as the result of mental derangement or other mental cause\\" or disappeared \\"under circumstances indicating that he may have died, either naturally, or accidentally.\\" It further stated that he suffered from \\"severe bipolar disorder.\\" Aguiar was sued by his uncle Thomas Kaplan. As part of that lawsuit, the judge presiding over the case, John O'Sullivan, found that Aguiar's psychosis \\"manifested itself in both grandiose and paranoid delusions,\\" for example, Aguiar's belief that he (Aguiar) was being followed by snipers. On the day Aguiar disappeared, a federal judge in Florida issued an order appointing an independent medical examiner to see if Aguiar was psychologically sound enough for a deposition in the case. Disappearance On June 20, 2012, Aguiar's 31-foot, center console Jupiter boat, named the T.T. Zion, landed on Fort Lauderdale Beach east of East Las Olas Boulevard around 1:15 a.m., with its navigation lights on and engines still running, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Sea Tow, the company that Fort Lauderdale authorities contracted to tow the boat, said that the vessel appeared seaworthy and did not believe a mechanical problem had occurred. Aguiar's wallet and cell phone were found on board, but no sign of him or any other passenger was found. Authorities on ATVs searched up and down the beach, but found no sign of Aguiar. The Coast Guard commenced a search at sea. In July 2012 and June 2013, the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department said that even though the investigation remains open, there have been no significant leads in the case. Aguiar was declared legally dead on January 29, 2015, two years and seven months after his disappearance.

He was the owner of the William Clendinneng & Son Company (Limited), one of Canada's most important foundries, in operation from 1868 to 1904. He represented Montr√©al division no. 4 in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1890 to 1892 as a Conservative. Born in Cavan, William Clendinneng arrived in Montreal with his family in 1847, at the young age of 14.* Clendinneng joined the William Rodden & Company foundry (est.1810) located at Griffintown, near the Lachine canal, Montr√©al. Starting at the age of 19, he served as a clerk at the foundry from 1852 to 1858, becoming a partner in 1858, and owner in 1868. At this time the foundry's name was changed to W. Clendinneng foundry. In 1853, he married Rachel Newmarch. The foundry was a significant player in the early industrial growth of Montr√©al. Clendinneng's son, William Jr., joined the business in 1884 as a partner, and the name was changed to The William Clendinneng & Son Company (Limited). By 1886, the foundry's 450 workers made castings of all types, including: architectural and ornamental ironwork; agricultural and railway castings; drain and gas pipes; stoves, ranges, furnaces, and hollow ware; and household goods‚Äîthe tools of the homestead farms and Canada's urbanization. The foundry participated in the Great Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851 in Britain and Paris' 1855 Exposition. Canada's first industrial design was a Clendinneng double stove, registered in 1861. The foundry also made the stately main gates and fence for Rideau Hall. Under Clendinneng the business developed into the largest foundry in Canada. Clendinneng was also owner of the Canada Pipe & Foundry Company. Clendinneng was a dedicated Methodist and a founding member and president of the Irish Protestant Benevolent Society of Montr√©al (est. 1856). He was a board member of many different societies, including the Montr√©al Protestant House of Industry and Refuge, the Montr√©al General Hospital, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. and the Young Men's Christian Association in Montreal. Clendinneng played a prominent role in the civic life of Montr√©al. As an alderman for the Sainte- Antoine riding he served on the Montreal city council from 1876 to 1879 and again from 1888 to 1893. He introduced many improvements to the Montr√©al's civic regulations and bylaws, and served as Acting Mayor in 1888. He was a Conservative representative at the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1890 to 1892. After the Clendinneng foundry ceased operations in 1904, Clendinneng left Montreal. He died in Depew, New York at the age of 74 after being hit by a train. He is buried at the Mount Royal Cemetery, Montr√©al. The legacy of William Clendinneng Sr. and his son, William Jr., will forever be associated with iron manufacturing.

It was written by George Harrison, Starr's former bandmate in the Beatles, and was one of several contributions Harrison made to Ringo. Recording for the song took place in Los Angeles in March 1973, with Richard Perry producing the session. In addition to Starr and Harrison, the musicians on the track include Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko and Garth Hudson of the Band, and multi-instrumentalist David Bromberg. Harrison wrote \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\" in Ireland while staying with Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. In a contrast with the reconciliatory mood among the four ex-Beatles when the song was recorded, the visit occurred shortly after the British High Court's ruling on the dissolution of the band in March 1971. The composition reflects the influence of Irish folk music, as well as aspects of country, hootenanny and the sea shanty tradition. In his lyrics, Harrison espouses an escape from modern life for the tranquility of nature. The \\"Raymond\\" named in the song title was a lawyer hired by Allen Klein, the manager of Harrison, Starr and John Lennon, to represent the three former Beatles and Apple Corps in the High Court action initiated by Paul McCartney. On release, \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\" received a varied response from music critics, some of whom dismissed it as an inauspicious track. Among retrospective reviewers, several commentators have admired its lightheartedness and consider the song to be a worthy example of Starr's work in the country genre. Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes it as \\"musically an homage to the spirit of the Band's 'Rag Mama Rag'\\". Background and inspiration Castle Martin, in County Kildare, where Harrison stayed with Donovan in 1971 George Harrison wrote \\"Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond)\\" while on holiday in Ireland with his wife, Pattie Boyd.Clayson, p. 242. The couple stayed with Scottish singer Donovan, a friend of the Beatles since the mid 1960s and a fellow student on the band's 1968 Transcendental Meditation course in India.Mark Paytress, \\"A Passage to India\\", Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution (The Beatles' Final Years Jan 1, 1968 to Sept 27, 1970), Emap (London, 2003), p. 12. The visit took place over the Easter holiday weekend in April 1971, when Donovan, having recently become a tax exile in Ireland,Jason Ankeny, \\"Donovan\\", AllMusic (retrieved 1 September 2016).Romanowski & George-Warren, p. 280. hosted a party for his musician friends at the Castle Martin estate in Kilcullen, County Kildare.Damian Smyth, \\"George Harrison's Irish Easter Egg Hunt!\\", i96 Radio, 19 March 2016 (retrieved 2 September 2016). While discussing the song in his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison recalls composing the melody on an open-tuned guitar, and adds that he wrote it \\"like an old Irish folk song, a bit like country music\\". The holiday provided a respite for Harrison in the aftermath of the Beatles' break-up. According to Boyd, despite the freedom he now enjoyed as a solo artist, and the acclaim afforded his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass,Rodriguez, p. 43. Harrison was distressed at the hostility that prevailed among the four former bandmates.David Cavanagh, \\"George Harrison: The Dark Horse\\", Uncut, August 2008, p. 41. On 12 March 1971, the British High Court had ruled in Paul McCartney's favour against the other three Beatles and their manager, Allen Klein, resulting in the group's company, Apple Corps, being placed into receivership.Doggett, pp. 162‚Äì63.Badman, p. 32. During this time, press reports from the court case had conveyed the full extent of the acrimony that existed between Klein's clients Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr and McCartney.Doggett, pp. 158‚Äì60.Rodriguez, pp. 6, 41‚Äì42. Having expressed his frustration with the legal proceedings in another recent composition, \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\",Leng, pp. 126‚Äì27.Inglis, p. 39. Harrison addressed one of the Klein-appointed lawyers, named Raymond, in the parenthetical subtitle of \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\". In I, Me, Mine, Harrison says that Raymond was \\"in my mind at the time\\", hence the instruction for him to \\"sail away\\". Composition \\"Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond)\\" is in 4/4 time and in the musical key of E. Rather than using formal chord changes, the melody is established through a modal riff over a constant E major chord.\\"'Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond)' (by George Harrison)\\", in Ringo Starr Ringo: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Charles Hansen (New York, NY, 1973). Harrison biographer Simon Leng considers the song to be \\"musically an homage to the spirit\\" of \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" by the Band, who epitomised the counterculture's embracing of pastoral values in the late 1960s.John Harris, \\"Into the Woods\\", Mojo, December 2003, p. 92.Romanowski & George-Warren, p. 50. Having spent time with the group in Woodstock in late 1968,Helm, p. 178. following the completion of the Beatles' White Album,Doggett, pp. 56‚Äì57. Harrison had drawn inspiration from the Band's focus on traditional song forms during the final year of the Beatles' career.Leng, pp. 51‚Äì53, 318. Among other authors commenting on the song's musical style, Starr biographer Alan Clayson deems it \\"a hootenanny hoe-down\\", while Beatles scholar Michael Frontani writes of its \\"authentic country-bluegrass\\" mood. In Leng's description, notwithstanding the song's lighthearted qualities, the lyrical theme of \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\" is \\"escape from people, pressure, and society\\".Leng, p. 139. During the choruses, Harrison states that a \\"sunshine life\\" awaits him if he were only able to escape from \\"this cloud over me\\". In keeping with the rustic theme,Rodriguez, p. 35. Harrison says that he would prefer to associate with trees than with humans,Allison, p. 71. since \\"most folks just bore me / Always imposing ...\\"Harrison, p. 231. In the second verse, he dismisses Raymond with the words:Harrison, pp. 231, 232. While recognising \\"cheerfulness\\" as the song's prevailing emotion, Beatles biographer Ian Inglis writes that Harrison's instruction to Raymond is \\"perfectly apt, given the song's likeness to a traditional sea shanty\\".Inglis, p. 55. The composition ends with multiple vocal parts, staggering the chorus lines. Leng compares \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\" with \\"The Pirate Song\\", a sea shanty written by Harrison and comedian Eric Idle in 1975, in which Harrison sings of wanting to be a pirate rather than a celebrity.Leng, p. 189. Theologian Dale Allison views the track as an example of how its composer's work \\"often revels in the natural world\\". According to Allison, the same \\"easy romanticism about nature\\" returns in \\"Blow Away\\" and songs from Gone Troppo (1982), while also contrasting with the \\"ecological anxiety\\" Harrison expresses in tracks such as \\"Tears of the World\\", \\"Cockamamie Business\\" and the Monty Python-influenced \\"Save the World\\".Allison, pp. 70‚Äì71, 153‚Äì54.

Release and reception Apple Records issued Ringo on 2 November 1973.Madinger & Easter, p. 645.Harry, pp. 184‚Äì85.

In his book The Beatles Solo on Apple Records, Bruce Spizer describes the first five tracks on Ringo as \\"one of the strongest album sides produced by any ex- Beatle\\". The album cover consisted of a painting by Tim Bruckner in which Harrison, the four members of the Band and all the other musicians on the recording appear, alongside Starr.Spizer, p. 308. The song was published by the Material World Charitable Foundation,Harrison, p. 386. which Harrison had set up in April 1973. Comparing \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\" with the devout lyrical content of Living in the Material World, Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner opined that with this song Harrison had \\"managed to be amusing for the first time in years\\".Schaffner, p. 161. NME critic Bob Woffinden admired the track as \\"a sort of update of 'Mother Nature's Son'\\" on an album that conveyed \\"a zestfulness, an unashamed joie de vivre\\".Woffinden, pp. 75, 77.

Among retrospective assessments of the song, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, writing in their book on the former Beatles' solo careers, admire it as \\"a hoedown stomper which was as country as any of the tracks on Beaucoups of Blues\\".Madinger & Easter, p. 503. Ian Inglis writes of \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\": \\"The result is a convincing piece of good-time folk-rock that would have been at home on Fairport Convention's groundbreaking album Liege & Lief, which was itself hugely influenced by the spirit of the Band's Music from Big Pink ... [T]he impression lingers that the track was as much fun to make as it is to hear.\\"Inglis, pp. 55‚Äì56. In the 2005 publication NME Originals: Beatles The Solo Years 1970‚Äì1980, Paul Moody included \\"Sunshine Life for Me\\" among Starr's \\"ten solo gems\\", describing it as a \\"joyful hillbilly romp\\".Hunt, p. 25. Former Mojo editor Mat Snow cites it as an example of how Harrison and Lennon served their former bandmate well with their respective contributions to Ringo in the case of \\"Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond)\\", by \\"amusingly hark[ing] back to Ringo's songs of life beneath the waves while extolling his yachting lifestyle on the surface\\".Snow, pp. 44, 47.

Giuseppe Sirtori (17 April 1813 ‚Äì 18 September 1874) was an Italian soldier, patriot and politician who fought in the unification of Italy. Biography Sirtori was born at Monticello Brianza, north of Milan. He started an ecclesiastic career, being ordained in 1838. In 1842, he went to Paris to study theology and philosophy, but, in 1840, he left the church and returned to France study to medicine. He took part in the 1848 revolution, being amongst those who forced Alphonse de Lamartine to proclaim the Republic at the Hotel de Ville. Circumstances of Sirtori's adherence to the revolutionary movements are unclear, as documents of his life in Paris were later destroyed. Also unknown are the circumstances leading him to the Five Days of Milan (18‚Äì22 March 1848), where he was elected captain of the rebel's army. In this position he was sent to the defence of Venice, which had freed itself from the Austrian. Here he grew strife with the more moderate Venetian leader Daniele Manin, and was even accused of plotting to surrender the city (5 March 1849) during the long Austrian siege of 1849. Anyway, Sirtori was amongst the most gallant defenders of the city, which fell in August 1849. Sirtori escaped on a French vessel, which left him in Corfu. Then he moved to Paris, where, as a fervid Republican, grudgingly witnessed to Napoleon III's suppression of the French 2nd Republic. In Lausanne, he met the Italian Republican leader Giuseppe Mazzini, becoming one of his most faithful followers. In the 1850s he was one of the main members of the Mazzinian committee in Genoa, together with Giacomo Medici, Nino Bixio and Benedetto Cairoli. He however abandoned Mazzini after the failed revolt in Milan of 6 February 1853. Always unset, Sirtori adhered to the French-backed Lucien Murat's attempt to overthrow Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. However, he soon gained the enmity of the Italian patriots in France, who were afraid of a too large French control over Italy; this led Murat to jail him in an asylum in Paris. He was freed after a short stay thanks to other Italian exiled. Sirtori moved to Piedmont, where he sought for a position in the Savoy army; however, his Republican past and the Mazzini veto prevented him to take part in the successful Second Italian War of Independence (1859). He therefore switched to the Monarchic party, obtaining a seat in the Turin Parliament. Giuseppe Garibaldi called him in his Expedition of the Thousand (1860), which would result in the Piedmontese annexion of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the creation of the unified Kingdom of Italy. As Garibaldi did not want to deal with the Piedmontese Prime Minister Cavour, the latter discussed the plan with Sirtori. Sirtori distinguished himself in the ensuing battles of Calatafimi (in which he was wounded at a leg) and Palermo, after which he was promoted as general. On July 19 Garibaldi shortly named him vice-dictator of Sicily, but Sirtori's main role was that of de facto chief of staff in the volunteer liberation army. Sirtori also took part in the battle of Volturno against the last remains of the Neapolitan troops. After Garibaldi left to Caprera, Sirtori was assigned the task to merge the Mille's army into the new Italian Army. However, the conditions were so unfavourable that most of the volunteers disbanded; despite this, Sirtori entered the ranks of the Italian army as Tennant General (1862). His first task, as plenipotentiary in Catanzaro, in Calabria, was the suppression of the brigand bands which had appeared in great number in southern Italy after the Piedmontese occupation. His harsh methods led to his quick removal, but Sirtori continued to address the problem in a Parliament commission. Sirtori's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, Italy In 1866 fought as division commander in the Third Italian War of Independence. In the wake of the defeat at Custoza, he was stripped of his command after a clash with Alfonso La Marmora, the Italian chief of staff (today generally considered the main responsible of the defeat). Sirtori renounced to all his army decorations and wages. His removal led some of his enemies to accuse him of the defeat: the polemics went on until 1871, when another general, Giuseppe Govone, now turned Ministry of War, re-established Sirtori's honor, naming him commander of a division in Alessandria. In 1867 he was elected in the Parliament in the ranks of the left. He died in Rome in 1874, where he was working in a commission for new weapons. and is buried in Milan, at the city's Monumental Cemetery.

Retrieved 2009-07-25. \\"Kolbe is now a great-great-grandmother, and the Esperantists of Leipzig still regard her as their cornerstone,\\" wrote Kay W√ºster in the Leipziger Volkszeitung. On her 90th birthday, 20 Esperantists from four German provinces, including scientists and former students, came to offer their congratulations. Among the distinguished guests were Krause and Detlev Blanke. Esperanto upbringing Her parents were so dedicated to the Esperanto movement that the only language they used around her was Esperanto; therefore before entering school she learned her German only from other children. Kolbe related how she first became conscious of the different vocabulary of another language. As a child of three or four, she and the neighbour children were excitedly playing with her spinning-top toy. After some time she stormed upstairs to her parents' second-floor flat in Leipzig- Gohlis, complaining: La infanoj diris, ke mia turbo estas Kreisel. (\\"The children said that my 'turbo' is a top.\\", where turbo is the Esperanto word for top.)\\"Wie die Welt vereinen sollte Esperanto\\" in Der Tagesspiegel, 27 July 2009. Retrieved 2009-07-25 In 1910, with a group of his friends, Kolbe's father Reinhold Voigt, a convinced pacifist and socialist, had founded Frateco (\\"Brotherhood\\"), an influential workers' Esperanto association in Leipzig. The Workers' Esperantists in Leipzig and elsewhere saw themselves as the true guardians of L.L. Zamenhof's hopeful vision; they hoped to use Esperanto to further the class struggle and had only limited contact with the smaller German Esperanto Federation (Deutschen Esperanto-Bund, DEB), which viewed the popularity of the language among the working class with mixed feelings: while the workers were increasing the visibility of Esperanto as a viable language, extremist right-wing critics had begun to defame Esperanto as the \\"language of hoodlums and Communists.\\" As early as his Mein Kampf polemic (1925), Adolf Hitler had attacked Esperanto as a supposed tool of his imagined Jewish world dominion. Prior to the Nazi era, Germany had been a hotbed of Esperantism; by 1922 more than 100,000 Germans had learned the language and in that one year 40,256 adults were enrolled in one of 1,592 Esperanto courses being taught throughout Germany. Esperanto was also being taught in the elementary schools of 126 German cities. It was a time when even League of Nations Undersecretary-General Inaz≈ç Nitobe attended the World Congress of Esperanto and recommended the use of Esperanto to the General Assembly. During the 1920s Reinhold Voigt travelled widely to promote Esperanto and to give courses in the language. He corresponded with Esperantists around the world, and at six Kolbe already had a young Japanese pen-pal to whom she wrote in Esperanto. His family was often visited by foreign Esperantists ‚Äî Dutch, French and others ‚Äî to whom they showed off their \\"Esperanto child\\". Taking Marx's slogan literally (\\"Workers of all countries unite,\\") the socialist Esperantists took nature hikes, singing Esperanto songs and sporting red banners with the green star of Esperanto. In 1929 the Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda, an umbrella organization of various left-wing workers' Esperanto groups, held its annual congress in Leipzig with 2,000 participants. Kolbe recalled that she and her brother met many of the delegates at the train station and guided them to their quarters.

Tarbell, ca. 1902 The Boston School was a group of Boston-based painters active in the first three decades of the twentieth century. Often classified as American Impressionists, they had their own regional style, combining the painterliness of Impressionism with a more conservative approach to figure painting and a marked respect for the traditions of Western art history. Their preferred subject matter was genteel: portraits, picturesque landscapes, and young women posing in well-appointed interiors. Major influences included John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, and Jan Vermeer. Key figures in the Boston School were Edmund C. Tarbell, Frank Weston Benson, and William McGregor Paxton, all of whom trained in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian and later taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Their influence can still be seen in the work of some contemporary Boston-area artists. History \\"September Afternoon\\" by Joseph DeCamp, 1895 The progenitors of the Boston School were Edmund C. Tarbell, Frank Weston Benson, and William McGregor Paxton, all of whom trained in Paris at the Acad√©mie Julian and later taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Their interest in modern French art can be traced to William Morris Hunt, a well- known teacher, painter, and taste-maker in late nineteenth-century Boston. After a visit to Paris, Hunt, who was on the original advisory board of the Museum of Fine Arts, encouraged prominent Bostonians to invest in the work of French artists such as Millet, Monet, and Renoir. Through his influence, the MFA hosted the first American exhibition of Monet's work in 1911. Tarbell, Benson, and Paxton trained at the museum school in its early days. Tarbell eventually became so influential that the painters in his immediate circle were referred to by critics of the time as \\"Tarbellites\\". The Tarbellites specialized at first in Impressionistic and Barbizon-influenced landscapes. Later they gravitated to indoor scenes, typically featuring women engaged in household duties, recalling the domestic subjects of Dutch painters such as Vermeer. They also painted visually appealing still lifes and portraits after the manner of John Singer Sargent. From these various influences, the Boston painters synthesized their own regional style. As painter William Merritt Chase remarked at the time, \\"A new type has appeared, the offspring, as we know, of European stock, but which no longer resembles it.\\" They placed a high value on technical skill, accurate visual representation, and classical beauty, while adopting what was then a very modern, \\"loose\\" style of painting from the French. Other painters associated with the Boston School include Joseph DeCamp, Philip Leslie Hale, Lilian Westcott Hale, John Joseph Enneking,Volpe (2007), p. 3. Gretchen Woodman Rogers, Aldro Hibbard, Frederic Porter Vinton, Lilla Cabot Perry, Elizabeth Okie Paxton, Hermann Dudley Murphy, W. Lester Stevens, and others. Tarbell's teacher at the museum school, Emil Otto Grundmann, is sometimes included in this group. In addition to paintings, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts includes sculptures and drawings in its Boston School gallery, such as \\"Blind Cupid\\" by Bela Pratt and pastel drawings by Laura Coombs Hills. Ongoing tradition Later artists working in this style include R. H. Gammell, Yoshi Mizutani, Charles Tersolo, Melody Phaneuf, Sam Vokey, Candace Whittemore Lovely, and Dianne Panarelli Miller.. Dana Levin, founder of the New School of Classical Art, an atelier in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, cites the Boston School as a key influence. Charles H. Cecil, founder of Charles H. Cecil Studios in Florence, Italy, was trained by R. H. Ives Gammell and continues to pass on the methods of the Boston painters to his students. Several artists working in the tradition of the Boston School exhibit at the Copley Society of Art and the Guild Of Boston Artists on Newbury Street. Reception \\"Woman in a Fur Hat\\" by Gretchen Woodman Rogers, ca. 1915 Although they are now seen as traditionalists, painters of the Boston School were criticized by academics in the early days for their daring use of Impressionistic techniques.Volpe (2007), p. 1. They soon achieved national renown, and continued to dominate the art scene in aesthetically conservative Boston through the 1930s and into the forties. They were admired for their dedication to craftsmanship and beauty at a time when modernists were challenging traditional artistic values. In recent times they have come under criticism for focusing on the lives of the upper class. Though not necessarily well off themselves, many of the artists worked on commission for wealthy Boston Brahmin patrons. In At Beck and Call: The Representation of Domestic Servants in Nineteenth-Century American Painting, Elizabeth O'Leary notes that servants in paintings of the time were often framed in windows and doorways, creating a distancing effect, as seen in Tarbell's \\"The Breakfast Room\\" (above). Where they were prominently featured in paintings, she argues that they were treated as status symbols, akin to valuable possessions. Chapter 6 of the book, titled \\"Bridget in Service to the Boston School: 1892-1923\\", concerns the use of Irish servants as models. Art historians have noted that Boston was a particularly receptive city for women artists. A 2001 exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, A Studio of Her Own: Women Artists in Boston, 1870-1940, included the work of several women artists associated with the Boston School, including Gretchen Woodman Rogers and Lilian Westcott Hale. Rogers \\"Woman in a Fur Hat\\" (right) appears on the cover of the exhibition catalog. Rogers studied at the museum school with Tarbell, who considered her a genius. Boston's acceptance of women artists notwithstanding, the paintings of the Boston School typically depicted women indoors, reposing or engaged in domestic duties, a tendency characterized by at least one critic as anti- feminist.

It was in Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. The 2001 Census recorded the parish's population as 274. Topography The parish is long north ‚Äì south and slightly more than wide east ‚Äì west. Part of its southern boundary is formed by a stream that flows west to join the River Cole south of Coleshill, about west of the parish. The stream runs in the bottom of a valley that runs roughly from east to west. Part of the parish's western boundary is formed by a brook that joins that stream. The southeast boundary was changed in the 20th century so that it follows the A420 road. Part of the northern boundary is in Badbury Forest. For the remainder the parish is bounded by field boundaries. In 1924 the parish covered , but that was before the southeast boundary was revised. The parish's highest point is Badbury Hill (see below), which is just over high and is about northwest of the village. The lowest point is just over above sea level, at the southwest corner of the parish. The geology of much of the parish is Late Jurassic. Great Coxwell village is on Corallian Limestone beds between and above sea level. The land north of the village is on Kimmeridge Clay, Oxford Clay and Early Cretaceous Lower Greensand. Badbury Hill Badbury Hill is in the north of the parish. On its summit is an Iron Age hill fort that was built about 600 BC. There is ancient woodland on its slopes. The hill is in the care of the National Trust. Toponym The Domesday Book of 1086 records the toponym as Cocheswelle. 13th- and 14th- century records call it Great Cokewell or Cokeswell. In 15th-century records it is Cokeswylle or Cokyswell. The earliest known record of the modern spelling Coxwell is from the 18th century. \\"Great\\" distinguishes the place from neighbouring Little Coxwell, whose village is east of Great Coxwell. The two parishes share a common boundary. Manor The Domesday Book records that King Harold held the manor before the Norman Conquest of England. Great Coxwell was a large manor, which the Domesday Book of 1086 recorded as 20 hides. When the Cistercian Beaulieu Abbey in Hampshire was founded in 1204‚Äì05, King John endowed it with a group of manors that were headed by Great Faringdon and included Great Coxwell. The abbey retained the manors until 1538, when it was forced to surrender all its properties to the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1540 the Crown sold the manor of Great Coxwell to a local landholder, William Morys (or Morris). Under Queen Elizabeth I the Morris family were recusants. In 1580 the Mass was secretly celebrated at Court House Farm in Great Coxwell. In 1581 Francis Morris, grandson of William Morys, was jailed in the Fleet Prison in London for sheltering the Jesuit priest Edmund Campion. The Morris family held the estate until 1638 when it was sold to George Pratt, who already held the neighbouring estate of Coleshill. The Pratt family held both Great Coxwell and Coleshill estates until 1700, when they were sold to George Pratt Richmond, also known as Webb. The estate was still in the Webb family early in the 19th century. Great Coxwell Barn seen from the southwest Some decades later Ernest Cook (1865‚Äì1955), grandson of the pioneer travel agent Thomas Cook, acquired numerous estates including Coleshill, and thus Great Coxwell. Cook left his estates to the National Trust. =Great Coxwell Barn= On the northern edge of the village is a Medi√¶val barn that was built about AD 1292 for Beaulieu Abbey to store the crop of its monastic grange. It is a Grade I listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The barn is now owned by the National Trust, restored and open to the public. Parish church Gothic Revival stained glass window in St Giles' parish church in memory of Rev. John Hope Hooper, who served the parish 1878‚Äì99 first as curate and then as vicar The Church of England parish church of Saint Giles is on a ridge in the southern part of the village. Parts of the church date from about 1200. The west tower was added in the 15th century. The tower has a ring of five bells. Henry Bagley of Chacombe cast the treble, third and fourth bell in 1738. James Wells of Aldbourne, Wiltshire cast the second bell in 1824. Mears and Stainbank cast the tenor bell in 1911. There is also a Sanctus bell that John Taylor cast in 1839, presumably at his then foundry in Oxford. The bells are currently unringable. The churchyard is now managed for wildlife. It has more than 100 species of wild flower, including wild clary, Salvia verbenaca. Public transport Stagecoach West Gold bus route S6 between Swindon and Oxford via Faringdon passes east of the village on the A420 road. Buses run generally every 20 minutes from Mondays to Saturdays and every 30 minutes on Sundays. The nearest stop is just off the main A420 road, about east of Great Coxwell village.

Their boss, FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner, was also often involved. Beginning with season 8, another skeptic named John Doggett, and Monica Reyes, a believer like Mulder, were also introduced. The overarching story, which spans events as early as the 1940s, is built around a government conspiracy to hide the truth about alien existence and their doomsday plan. Not all episodes advanced the mythology plot, but the ones that did were often set up by Mulder or Scully via an opening monologue. Most mythological elements in The X-Files relate to extraterrestrial beings, referred to by the writers as \\"Colonists\\", whose primary goal is to colonize Earth. Late in the series, this was revealed to have been planned for the year 2012.

He is appointed a partner in these investigations‚ÄîDana Scully (Gillian Anderson)‚Äîwith his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire.. A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air Force test pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin), who continues to provide the agents sensitive information.. This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case.. Deep Throat is killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program, and the X-Files unit is closed shortly thereafter.. =Season 2= Unable to continue his work with Scully, Mulder obtains information about possible extraterrestrial contact in Puerto Rico, finding that the SETI program at the Arecibo Observatory is being forcibly closed.. Although the pair are allowed to resume their work, Scully is later kidnapped by an unhinged multiple alien abductee, Duane Barry. Barry takes Scully to a hilltop where she is then abducted, presumably by aliens.. She is found comatose at a later date, having mysteriously arrived at a hospital, and recovers several days later. Mulder receives a call from his father, who informs him that his sister Samantha (Megan Leitch), who had been abducted as a child, has returned. Samantha is being pursued by a shapeshifting bounty hunter, who is assassinating human clones. Samantha is killed, although it is revealed that she was simply one of a number of clones, produced using alien tissue to create an alien-human hybrid.. The Lone Gunmen contact Mulder and Scully about a successful attempt by a friend of theirs to hack the United States Department of Defense computer system. The hacker, Kenneth Soona (Bernie Coulson), is able to give Mulder the downloaded information on a digital cassette. Soona is subsequently assassinated, and the downloaded files are found to be written in Navajo. Contacting Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman)‚Äîa Navajo man capable of translating the files‚ÄîMulder is shown a box-car full of what appear to be alien corpses. He is trapped in the box-car by the series' antagonist, The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and left for dead after it is destroyed. =Season 3= Mulder is later found and nursed back to health by Hosteen. Meanwhile, Scully investigates the possible involvement of the smallpox eradication program in human genetic experimentation, discovering that a Nazi scientist who defected during Operation Paperclip has been conducting human experimentation to create alien-human hybrids. Dana's sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw) is shot by assassins who mistake her for Dana, and dies in the hospital.. Investigating evidence of an alien autopsy, Mulder infiltrates a secretive government train carriage carrying an alien-human hybrid being experimented on by Japanese scientists. Mulder is almost killed by a Syndicate operative guarding the hybrid, but is saved by his informant X (Steven Williams). X had been tipped off about Mulder's activities by Scully. Scully, meanwhile, meets a group of women with abduction experiences similar to her own, and meets another member of the Syndicate known as the First Elder (Don S. Williams). The First Elder claims that during Scully's abduction she was placed on a similar train car and experimented upon by the Japanese scientists.Lovece, pp.204‚Äì208 The crew of a French salvage ship trying to raise a World War II-era submarine from the sea floor are stricken with massive radiation burns‚Äîexcept for one man, who has been infected with a parasitic black oil discovered on the submarine. The black oil, controlling the crewman's body, passes into the crewman's wife and uses her to travel to Hong Kong in pursuit of a middleman selling government secrets. Mulder is after the same man. After Mulder catches Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) in Hong Kong, the black oil passes itself to Krycek. Scully determines that the submarine had been involved in discovering the black oil on the sea floor during World War II, under the guise of finding a sunken fighter plane. The infected Krycek makes his way to a missile silo used to hide a UFO, and the black oil escapes his body to board the craft. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Luis Cardinal, the man responsible for killing her sister.Lovece, pp.211‚Äì212 =Season 4= When the Syndicate suspect that a member is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organise a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder‚ÄîMarita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.Meisler (1998), pp.19‚Äì25. Mulder seeks Covarrubias' aid when he attempts to reach the site of the Tunguska event, in Russia, to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. While there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used‚Äîsuccessfully‚Äîas a test subject for a black-oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found out that Krycek is working with the Russians.Meisler (1998), pp.95‚Äì110 Scully, who has been diagnosed with cancer, is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction, and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who secretly makes such a deal himself.Meisler (1998), pp. 221‚Äì230 =Season 5= While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body. He uses the distraction to infiltrate The Pentagon in search of a cure for Scully's cancer. Meanwhile, Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI.Meisler (1998), pp.259‚Äì270Meisler (1999), pp.27‚Äì46 While a rebel alien race secretly attacks several groups of former alien abductees, the agents meet Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), a woman who claims to be a multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens.Meisler, pp 173‚Äì184 After Cassandra goes missing and her son, Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), angrily attempts to push his way into the FBI, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction. The Syndicate, meanwhile, speed up their tests of the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so.Meisler, pp. 187‚Äì196 Later, the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that strikes at the heart of the X-Files: They learn that the assassin's real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka).Meisler, pp. 269‚Äì280 =The X-Files: Fight the Future (feature film)= The X-Files have been shut down again, and Mulder and Scully are sent on a mission to deal with a terrorist bomb threat. However, after a government building is destroyed, Mulder is approached by a mysterious doctor, Alvin Kurtzweil (Martin Landau), who reveals that a new strain of the black oil has been discovered in North Texas. The new strain allows an extraterrestrial to gestate inside the host within 96 hours. Kurtzweil argues that the conspiracy deliberately placed the bomb within the government to hide the evidence. After Scully is stung by a black-oil-infected bee and abducted, the Well-Manicured Man gives Mulder her location and a weak vaccine, developed by the Syndicate. The Well-Manicured Man is killed by a car bomb, but his information leads Mulder to Antarctica, where he discovers a massive alien spaceship buried. Inside the ship, he finds Scully and administers the vaccine, which heals her. =Season 6= In Washington, D.C., Mulder appears before an FBI panel regarding his experiences in Antarctica, but is later denied reassignment to the X-Files division: Mulder and Scully have been replaced by Spender and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). After a scientist working for the Syndicate accidentally comes into contact with the black oil and gestates an alien, Mulder and Scully attempt to track the creature down in Phoenix, Arizona before the Syndicate can capture it.Meisler, pp. 11‚Äì18 Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is Krycek, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals.Meisler, pp. 120‚Äì132 Mulder and Scully learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra. After they locate her, she informs them that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien-human hybrid. The Smoking Man reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder.Meisler, pp. 135‚Äì144 Fowley forces Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to go to a CDC facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate meets at a check point, expecting to be taken away by the Colonists, who are preparing for invasion. They are met, instead, by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra. The Smoking Man and Fowley manage to escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man.Meisler, pp. 147‚Äì156 Several months later, an inscribed metallic artifact is found on a beach on Africa's C√¥te d'Ivoire. Mulder examines rubbings of the object and falls into a dangerous coma. Hoping to find a cure for her partner, Scully rushes to Africa and discovers a massive wrecked spacecraft partially buried in the ocean.Meisler, pp. 279‚Äì290 =Season 7= Skinner and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) try desperately to learn the truth about the alien object.Shapiro, pp. 7‚Äì16 Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to see Mulder, but she is told that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner, trying to find her partner. In fact, The Smoking Man has taken Mulder away to transplant the telepathic part of Mulder's brain into his own cranium. The surgery is a failure.Shapiro, pp. 19‚Äì28 Mulder develops an inoperable, terminal brain tumor after the surgery; he keeps the news from Scully. While investigating the bizarre disappearance of a young girl from her home, Mulder soon discovers the truth about his sister's abduction.Shapiro, pp. 119‚Äì128 He and Scully find evidence proving that Samantha was abducted by The Smoking Man, who forced her to live in a now-abandoned US Army base and experimented on her. Mulder also learns that his sister was taken by a \\"walk-in,\\" a benevolent spirit who saves the souls of children doomed to die in suffering. Mulder is eventually reunited with the spirit of his sister, allowing him to finally let her go.Shapiro, pp. 130‚Äì139 Mulder and Scully investigate a case of alien abduction which leads them back to Oregon, the site of their first case together where Mulder is taken by a UFO.Shapiro, pp. 266‚Äì277 =Season 8= Scully soon meets Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick), the leader of an FBI taskforce organized to search for Mulder. Although the search proves unsuccessful, Doggett is assigned to the X-Files, and he works with Scully to search for explanations for several cases. When Scully learns that several women have reportedly been abducted and impregnated with alien babies, she begins to question her own pregnancy. Doggett introduces Scully to Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), an FBI specialist in ritualistic crime, shortly before Mulder's dead body suddenly appears in a forest at night. Following Mulder's funeral, Assistant Director Skinner is threatened by Krycek, who tells him that he must kill Scully's baby before it is born. Billy Miles, a multiple abductee who disappeared on the same night as Mulder, is returned as a corpse, but his dead body is resurrected and restored to full health. Mulder also returns from death, with Scully supervising his recovery. Fully rejuvenated and healed of his earlier brain tumor, Mulder investigates several X-Files, against orders, and he is soon fired, leaving Doggett in charge of the cases. Mulder continues to provide input in an unofficial capacity. Reluctantly accepting Krycek's assistance, Mulder, Doggett and Skinner learn that an alien virus recently created in secret by members of the United States government has replaced several humans, including Billy Miles and several high-ranking FBI personnel, with so-called alien \\"Super Soldiers\\". Krycek claims that the soldiers are virtually unstoppable aliens who want to make sure that humans will not survive the colonization of Earth. They have learned that Scully's baby is a miraculously special child and are afraid that it may be more powerful than they are. When Miles arrives at the FBI Headquarters, Mulder, Doggett, Skinner and Krycek help Scully to escape along with Reyes, who drives her to a remote farm. Shortly after, Skinner kills Krycek, and Scully delivers an apparently normal baby while the alien \\"Super Soldiers\\" surround her. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area when Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to the FBI Headquarters, Mulder takes Scully and their newborn son, William, back to her apartment. =Season 9= Mulder goes into hiding, Scully is reassigned to the FBI Academy, and Reyes becomes Doggett's new partner at the X-Files. Doggett, Scully, and Reyes discover a conspiracy to place Chloramine in the nation's water, causing mutations and creating \\"Super Soldiers.\\" This leads them to a clandestine laboratory where a secret experiment connected to Scully's child, William, is underway. The X-Files' investigation is hampered by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) and Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes). Scully is hopeful about reuniting with Mulder after a stranger, \\"Shadow Man\\" (Terry O'Quinn), offers to drive Mulder out of hiding. She accepts his offer, but she and Mulder are nearly killed: The man is a Super Soldier. Later on, Scully, Doggett and Reyes find evidence of a dangerous UFO cult that has found a spacecraft similar to the one Scully studied in Africa two years ago. The cult kidnaps William, but is destroyed when the baby's crying activates the ship and kills everyone while leaving William unharmed. Doggett finds a strange, disfigured man in the X-Files office. At first he believes the man is Mulder, but it is actually Jeffrey Spender, Mulder's half-brother. Spender sticks a needle into William. The other agents believe the injection to be a virus of some kind, but it is actually a cure for William's powers. Mulder comes out of hiding to look for classified information at an army base and, after allegedly killing a supposedly indestructible \\"Super Soldier\\" Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin), he is placed on trial to defend the X-Files and himself. With the help of Kersh, Scully, Reyes, Doggett, Spender, and Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka), Mulder escapes. Mulder and Scully then travel to New Mexico to find an old \\"wise man\\", later revealed to be The Smoking Man, who tells them that the aliens will arrive in 2012. Doggett and Reyes are confronted by Knowle Rohrer, who is killed by magnetite (the only known vulnerability of the \\"Super Soldiers\\"). The four agents then escape from a pair of black helicopters that kill The Smoking Man with missile fire. Scully and Mulder are last seen together in a motel room, facing an uncertain future. =Season 10= Fourteen years since leaving the X-Files, Mulder and Scully are contacted by media host Tad O'Malley who has uncovered possible evidence of the alien abductions being fabricated by the government to cover up their experiments on humans, and Mulder has a theory that everything that he and Scully were led to believe on the X-Files was made up by a conspiracy of men. Mulder and Scully find themselves being enlisted back to the FBI and working on the now reopened X-Files unit, which brings the attention of the alive Cigarette Smoking Man. Six weeks later a mass contagion, the Spartan Virus, begins to breaks out, causing people's immune systems to break down; all but those with alien DNA in their system. This is part of a scheme by The Smoking Man, something which has been put into motion since 2012 (the year the supposed alien invasion was meant to take place). Scully works to try and find a cure by using her alien DNA and Mulder disappears and confronts the Smoking Man in an attempt to stop his plans. Scully finds out that The Smoking Man enlisted former FBI agent Monica Reyes as an assistant to his schemes. Mulder begins to succumb to the virus, but refuses the Smoking Man's chance of a \\"seat at the table.\\" Mulder is eventually rescued by fellow agent Miller and reunited with Scully on a bridge in Washington, where she reveals Mulder needs a stem cell transplant that only their son can give them. As America is thrown into chaos, a UFO looms over Mulder, Scully and Miller on the bridge. =Season 11= The episode \\"My Struggle II\\" is revealed to be a premonition of Scully, foreseeing the end of humanity which leads to trying to find a way to prevent it by finding her and Mulder's son. Whilst the Smoking Man looks to depopulate most of humanity, there is another group looking to kill him and prevent it from happening, also is part of their own motives which allegedly involves space colonization with a select few, something which they feel can't be done if the Smoking Man's plans succeed. The two groups are also after Scully's son William, with the revelation that the Smoking Man is his father. It is mentioned by former Syndicate member Mr. Y (who is on the side opposing the Smoking Man) that the colonization hasn't taken place as the aliens abandoned their plans due to global warming on earth. =The X-Files comic book series= Although published in 2013, prior to the broadcast of Season 10, the comic book series is considered non-canon with the television series taking precedence in the mythology arc. In this comic book series, which is \\"Executive Produced\\" by Chris Carter, Mulder and Scully are visited by Deputy Director Skinner who informs them that someone has hacked into the FBI's files and discovered information regarding the X-Files. Scully has later gone missing and Mulder tracks down the Lone Gunmen, who had faked their deaths several years earlier, in order to help him find Scully. FBI Agent John Doggett investigates a pipeline that mysteriously explodes and is later revealed to possess magnetite. FBI Agent Monica Reyes finds out that William's adoptive parents are dead. Mulder is also visited by the believed-to-be dead Cigarette Smoking Man. Scully, after many encounters with mysterious aliens, reports to an FBI review board that people with connections to the X-Files division are systematically being targeted by an unknown group. As a result, Mulder and Scully are reinstated as federal agents as a countermeasure.  Production = Conception and early work = right At the beginning, Chris Carter did not think of creating a \\"mythology\\" for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life, because \\"they were just stories we wanted to tell,\\" which involved Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) on his personal quest joined by his partner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Eventually, the writers saw that the most \\"personal\\" episodes were the ones centering on the government conspiracy. Another reason for the development of the mythology, was that the producers were afraid of not creating a thread between the episodes centering on the conspiracy, being that they felt it would be pretentious if they did not do it. According to Carter, the mythology \\"sprung from\\" the pilot episode and its follow up, \\"Deep Throat\\", which set up the idea that aliens had been around for many years. Carter sees the final scene of \\"Deep Throat\\" as the \\"launching moment for the entire mythology\\". The main theme for the show starts with these episodes, being Mulder's quest to find \\"the truth\\" about his sister, Samantha Mulder. Mulder's quest for the truth helped build the mythology, since his investigation took him into cases about the paranormal. After a series of stand-alone episodes featuring UFOs and extraterrestrials early in the first season, the show's mythology developed largely based on the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson, who became pregnant midway through the first season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described it as \\"the best thing that ever happened to the series.\\", also saying \\"This mythology really ended up running through the life of the series, all because Gillian Anderson became pregnant\\".. Although there were initially second thoughts about Scully (Anderson) giving birth to an alien baby, ultimately the writers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy. The writers decided on closing the X-Files at the end of the season to separate Mulder and Scully from one another, and have Scully abducted, who would later reappear in a coma.. In addition to the creation of the storyline concerning Scully's abduction, Anderson's reduced role in the first half of the second season permitted the writers to develop some of the other characters in the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and X (Steven Williams), and resulted in the introduction of the character Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes eventually grew into a character that lasted seven seasons on the show.. = Creation of mythology and early seasons= Spotnitz at the April 2008 New York Comic Con Prior to the season two episode, \\"One Breath\\" the \\"Cigarette Smoking Man\\" mostly \\"lurked around in the shadows\\" and smoked cigarettes. The Smoking Man uttered only four audible words in the entire first season of the show, all of them being in \\"Tooms\\". R.W. Goodwin did not trust William B. Davis to take on the part as arch-nemesis to Fox Mulder. It was later revealed to the producers that Davis was running an acting school, and teaching such actors as Lucy Lawless, who would make an appearance in the ninth season. In the two-part episodes \\"Colony\\" and \\"End Game\\", Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz along with some help from David Duchovny created what would become a recurring character named the Alien Bounty Hunter. According to Carter, Duchovny came to him and said \\"Wouldn't it be great if we had like an alien bounty hunter?\\" Carter was positive towards the idea. The actor, Brian Thompson, auditioned for the role in a casting session, where he was competing with another actor. Spotnitz and Carter did not have much time to cast this character, but they knew this casting would be important since he was going to be a recurring character. Thompson was chosen according to Spotnitz because he had a very \\"distinctive look\\" about him, most notably his face and mouth. After casting him, they told Thompson's agent that he needed a hair cut, because he was originally envisioned as a US Air Force pilot who had been shot down. When Thompson came to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada there had been some \\"misunderstanding\\" between them, and he had not been told of the hair cut. So the hairstyle seen in this and every episode since was a \\"compromise between Thompson and the producers.\\" =Mythology development in seasons 3‚Äì5= Chris Carter admits that David Duchovny was very involved in shaping the show's mythology. His first notable efforts were \\"End Game\\" and \\"Anasazi\\". After writing the episode, Carter met up with a man who watched over the show by the Fox Network. He wanted the show to explain the paranormal phenomena in each episode. Carter responded with: \\"the interesting part about this for me was going to be telling stories where you left people wondering at the end, with the possibility that it could be real, but never ever stating that this is in fact the truth.\\" \\"Anasazi\\" was the first episode of a three-parter where the writers introduced the government conspiracy arc following the Syndicate. \\"Paper Clip\\" introduced the idea of genetic material that was taken through inoculations. In season three the black oil was introduced, which was an alien creature which invaded bodies and made them into living hosts. The Black oil was able to enter through a victim's mouth, eyes or nose; it would leave a victim's body to get back to its original form or get a new host. Later on in the show's mythology, it is discovered that the Black oil is the Colonists' lifeform; the oil was brought to Earth by meteorites to create hosts of the human population living there. The season four two-parters \\"Tunguska\\" and \\"Terma\\" hit the writers when they were trying to conceive a big and fun canvas to tell stories. So they decided to create a story which had connections to the Russian gulags, which led to a \\"natural\\" idea that the Russians were experimenting separately from the Syndicate to create a vaccine for the Black oil. Shiban felt it was natural creating an arms race-like story between the United States and Russia, being that the Cold War had ended a few years earlier. With the season five episodes \\"Patient X\\" and \\"The Red and the Black\\", the mythology became too hard for some viewers to follow. These two episodes marked the introduction of the Alien rebels who were fighting against the Colonists for their plan to colonize the known universe. These Alien rebels were of the same race as the Alien Bounty Hunters. Cassandra (Veronica Cartwright) and Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) would make their first appearances in these two episodes. Two other characters, Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) and Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) were introduced to the series mythology in the season five finale, \\"The End\\". = The X-Files feature film and seasons 6‚Äì7 = From the third season to the sixth season, the mysterious Syndicate was explored in detail. In the two part episode \\"Two Fathers\\"/\\"One Son\\", the Syndicate was destroyed. The plan to eliminate the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology in a new direction was originally conceived in September 1998.Meisler, pp. 156‚Äì157 Director Kim Manners stated \\"I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole story line of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, they all seemed to just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore.\\". The \\"Biogenesis\\"/\\"The Sixth Extinction\\"/\\"Amor Fati\\" trio of episodes started a new mythology for the series, questioning the origin of human life. Series creator Chris Carter claimed to be interested in the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago.Meisler, pp. 290‚Äì291 Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man who was one of the people responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology.. The scientific basis for extraterrestrials pursued the writers to help Mulder and Scully's beliefs come together, which was furthered in the later seasons of the show. Frank Spotnitz claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes \\"Two Fathers\\" and \\"One Son\\". \\"Closure\\" was written to create an end to Mulder's quest for his sister, Samantha, who had been abducted when he was a child. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Spotnitz explained that, \\"I think [series star, David Duchovny] grew tired of playing the man who is missing his sister. [...] I told him, 'This is going to be the last time you're going to have to play [that part].'\\" Paul Rabwin noted that, \\"It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away.\\"Shapiro, p. 139 \\"Requiem\\" was written as a way to potentially end the series. While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, \\"There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time to call it a day.\\". Eventually, it was decided that Mulder would be abducted at the end of the seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year. They eventually replaced Duchovny's Mulder with Robert Patrick's John Doggett. = Season eight and \\"The New X-Files\\" = The season eight premiere, \\"Within\\", started the storyline following the Super Soldiers and the search for Mulder. As Carter always believed the only way to get the audience to keep watching the show was to give them answers. So when they cast Robert Patrick as John Doggett a new lead character, since Duchovny had sued the Fox Network and Carter for more money, while wanting to leave, the court said he must appear in 12 episodes in the eighth season and then leave. When introducing Doggett into the series, they wanted to give him an enemy, this eventually led to the Super Soldiers, who rose up in \\"Within\\" to take on the role as the new government conspirators. The reason for creating a new enemy was to make sure not to just create a \\"new Mulder\\". The original idea for the Super Soldiers was that the United States Defense Department was developing genetically modified human beings, this was the non-alien explanation, while these characters eventually became the new aliens. Dana Scully took Mulder's role as a \\"believer\\" and handed her previous role as a \\"skeptic\\" to Doggett. Carter himself has admitted that the mythology became \\"complex\\" and a bit \\"too difficult to\\" follow, and even more difficult for the writers to \\"add more layers on to it\\". While saying it got \\"more interesting\\" in some ways but at the same time less interesting in some other ways, he said he understood why long-time fans of the show were discontent at seeing a \\"Mulderless\\" season, but at the same time said the new characters introduced new fans to the show who reacted positively to the changes. Annabeth Gish's character Monica Reyes, who would become a main character in season nine, made her first appearance in \\"This Is Not Happening\\". When creating the character for the episode, they wanted to give the character a personality who had much in common with both Mulder and Scully. Her first shot was four in the morning and her first scene in the episode was to run down a hill to discover a former abductee. Reyes, along with Skinner, were elevated to main character status in the ninth season. The original plan for season nine was to exit both Mulder, Scully and baby William out of the storyline in the following season. A proposed Season 10 would follow a storyline where the aliens were not the central focus of the mythology, since many of the writers, most notably Frank Spotnitz, felt that the alien-conspiracy storyline had gone on long enough \\"and played itself out.\\" The story arc would instead focus on what happened to Doggett's son, Luke, and the character of Reyes. =Revamped Mythology (Revival Series)= For the tenth season of the show (which marked the revival of the series after fourteen years), a new mythology was introduced, and the Super-Soldier arc was ignored as was the supposed alien colonization, which didn't appear to happen in December 2012. The new mythology involved a conspiracy of men who were planning to invade and takeover America, something which was put in motion since 2012 (when the colonization was supposed to take place). The Cigarette Smoking Man was reintroduced after his apparent death at the end of the original series, appearing as one of the masterminds behind the plot. The new arc appears to contradict claims in previous seasons, and makes out that aliens are not involved in the invasion plans, rather the conspiracy of men utilizing alien technology to be used in their master plans. For the eleventh season, it was decided to tone down on the alien mythology, and instead focus on a story arc involving Mulder and Scully attempting to track down their son William.  Reception  Jay Anderson, writing for What Culture, described the mythology entries as \\"some of the best of the series, featuring many superb acting performances, well-crafted scripts, and nail-biting endings\\". Anderson added that the mythology \\"really held the show together\\". Andrew Payne of Starpulse named the \\"original\\" mytharc of seasons 1-6 a \\"37-way-tie\\" for the fifth best episode of the series, explaining that it \\"was the thing that made The X-Files the best show on television during its first six seasons\\". However, he commented that it \\"went awry during the inscrutable sixth season finale\\". IGN's Dan Iverson wrote, \\"I loved the X-Files from the moment I started watching it, due in no small part to the mythology that Chris Carter created. Even though we all loved the 'monster of the week' episodes, these less ostentatious gems kept us interested in what could come in the long run. The overall story arc may have eventually fizzled out, but the questioning, open-ended nature of the stories nevertheless kept us at the edge of our seats.\\" For the first five seasons, critics praised the development in the mythology episodes. The first-season episode \\"Deep Throat\\" was cited as beginning to \\"set the stage for the central conflicts\\" of the series.Bush (2008), p. 41 IGN Dan Iverson felt that the episode served to \\"open the door to the possibilities of this series\\"; while Tor.com's Meghan Deans noted that \\"although the pilot introduced the idea of government conspiracy, it's 'Deep Throat' that kicks out the edges of the canvas\\". Nina Sordi of Den of Geek noted that the plotline in the second-season finale \\"Anasazi\\" laid \\"the groundwork for the mythology arc for the rest of the series\\", adding that it \\"brought much more significance to what is to come\\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the third season The X-Files \\"best season and maybe one of the greatest TV seasons of all time\\", noting it was consistent and \\"[swung] from strength to strength\\" between mythology and stand-alone episodes. Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly praised the new additions to the series' mythology during the series' fifth year. As the show increased in popularity, the mythology episodes even started causing media speculation. For instance, the fourth-season episode \\"Gethsemane\\" caused newspapers to run articles on whether or not Mulder had actually died. An article in the Wall Street Journal discussed fan theories behind Mulder's madness while a cartoon ran in The New Yorker a few weeks later surrounding Mulder's \\"death\\".Meisler, p. 271 After the 1998 film, the show's mythology began to receive increasingly critical reviews. Some fans felt there was no coherent plan to the main storyline and that Carter was \\"making it all up as he goes along.\\" The sixth season entries \\"Two Fathers\\" and \\"One Son\\"‚Äîwhich are considered to be the end to the Syndicate arc‚Äîwere well-received for delivering answers and closure. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk named both episodes as \\"highlights of season six.\\" Joyce Millman from Salon magazine said the episodes were some \\"of the most coherent, [...] almost unbearably tense, hours in the series' run\\". Likewise, \\"Closure\\", which concluded the Samantha story-arc, was met with mixed to positive reviews; although many felt that the episode hit the right emotional notes, some felt it did not conclude the way it should have. Many critics considered that the introduction of John Doggett and the search for Mulder in season eight helped to revitalize the series. However, once the series entered into its ninth season, most critics panned the mythology. The A.V. Club called the episodes \\"clumsy\\", noting that they were \\"new serialized storylines about so- called 'super soldiers'\\". The series finale, title \\"The Truth\\", received mixed reviews from critics. The main reason for criticism was that, instead of creating a conclusion, the episode created new questions for the audience. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it one star out of five. The two, despite calling the opening \\"promising\\", derided the episode's ending‚Äîespecially the revelation of alien colonization of December 22, 2012‚Äîwriting, \\"is this really what the series was about?\\" Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that the problem with the episode was that the show decided \\"to define itself in the summing up\\" with the episode, which did not answer very many questions. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, noted that the episode \\"told us nothing of significance\\" regarding the \\"big picture\\" mythology story arc.

It has been the primary home venue for its cricket team in the Victorian District/Premier Cricket competition since that time. The venue is one of the primary finals venue in the premier cricket competition, and hosted the first XI district/premier cricket final almost every year from 1953/54 until the early 21st century; it currently hosts the final of the second XIs. The venue has never hosted a first-class cricket match; in 2003, it was to have hosted its first List A match, a tour match between Australia A and South Africa A, but the match was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to rain. Top level women's cricket has been played on the ground. One women's Test match was played at the ground between Australia and New Zealand in January 1979, and the Rose Bowl series of Women's One Day International matches in 1988‚Äì89, 1990‚Äì91, and on three occasions in 1999‚Äì2000. The venue has one pavilion, the Clive Fairbairn Pavilion, named after MCC player, administrator and life member Clive Fairbairn. Tennis In 1905 the Warehouseman's Cricket Ground hosted the first edition of the Australasian Championships, the tournament which later became the Australian Open; lawn tennis at that time was administered in Victoria by the Melbourne Cricket Club. Rodney Heath defeated fellow Australian Arthur Curtis in four sets to claim the inaugural title. The venue hosted the Australasian Championships under the auspices of the MCC and later the Lawn Tennis Association of Victoria a total of four times: in 1905, 1911, 1914 and 1924 ‚Äì as well as the 1908 and 1912 Davis Cup finals, before Kooyong became the primary venue for lawn tennis in Melbourne. A set of public tennis courts remains available at Albert Reserve to the north of the cricket ground. Other sports The Melbourne Cricket Club lacrosse team has its training and playing base at the Albert Cricket Ground; the club's baseball team also used the venue until 1976. Football has been played on the ground in the past. The original Prahran Football Club, which played senior football in the Victorian Football Association in 1886 and 1887 before amalgamating with , played its home matches at the ground in 1886; and the Melbourne Football Club (which was a part of the MCC) played some games there after 1890. The ground is not used for football today.

It was co-created by actor David Firth and Shelley and It Takes a Worried Man creator Peter Tilbury. The first series was co-written by Firth and Tilbury, and the second one by Firth alone. It starred Robin Bailey, David Hargreaves, veteran Anglo-Jordanian actor Nadim Sawalha (who had also guest starred in a few episodes of Shelley), Diana Rayworth and Christopher Fulford. It was made by Thames Television for the ITV network. Plot The show revolved around librarian Henry Nunn (played by Bailey), who lived with his wife Sybil in Datchet, Berkshire. He is henpecked by his wife, who seems only interested in sitting in front of the TV, and whose face is never seen on screen, only being represented by a waving arm (belonging to Pamela Manson). The frustrated Henry then receives on the day of his 60th birthday an inheritance from his late Uncle Crispin of a neat sum of money, and, even better, ownership of the house where he was born and spent his glorious youth, situated in Stackley, a fictitious Black Country town. So Henry quits his job and makes the move northwards. Unfortunately for him, when he arrives at Stackley he will find himself immediately at odds with his neighbours: Tom (played by Hargreaves), a 'red under the bed' union shop steward and his wife Doreen (played by Rayworth); and Mumtaz (played by Sawalha), the Asian owner of the corner shop and who has a fondness for curry. Even worse, his house is squatted by Alex (played by Fulford), a green-haired punk. The essence of the show was the lack of communication between the Henry and the other characters, and it was serialised, each episode following off from the previous one.

Raised in Adelaide in South Australia in August 1940, the battalion formed part of the 26th Brigade and was initially assigned to the 7th Division, although it was later transferred to the 9th Division in 1941 when it was deployed to the Middle East. While there, it saw action during the siege of Tobruk and the First and Second Battles of El Alamein before being returned to Australia to take part in the fighting in New Guinea following Japan's entry into the war. During the campaign in New Guinea, the battalion took part in the advance on Lae during the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign and the fighting around Finschhafen and Sattelberg, during the Huon Peninsula campaign. Following this it was withdrawn to Australia, where it remained for over a year. In mid-1945, the 2/48th Battalion took part in the landing on Tarakan, which was its final involvement in the war. It was disbanded in October 1945 and is considered to be Australia's most highly decorated unit of the war, with four members receiving the Victoria Cross, the nation's highest decoration for gallantry, while over 90 other decorations were also made to its members. History=Formation= The 2/48th Battalion was raised on 9 August 1940 at the Wayville Showgrounds, in Adelaide, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Victor Windeyer, a former Militia officer who had previously commanded the Sydney University Regiment.Glenn 1987, pp. 1‚Äì2. A unit of the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), the 2/48th Battalion was formed specifically for service overseas and recruited mainly from the state of South Australia.Johnston 2002, p. xii. The battalion's headquarters staff began arriving early in the month, with many of the key personnel having served previously in South Australian Militia units, including the 27th Battalion (South Australian Scottish Regiment). At the end of August, a large draft of recruits arrived from the 2nd Infantry Training Depot, and rudimentary individual training was undertaken in the nearby park lands.Glenn 1987, pp. 2‚Äì4. The colours initially chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 48th Battalion, a unit which had served during the First World War before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were white over dark blue, in a circle shape, although a diamond- shaped border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart; this was later changed, though, following the unit's involvement in the fighting at Tobruk, when it adopted a 'T'-shaped UCP.Long 1952, pp. 321‚Äì323. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies‚Äîdesignated 'A' through to 'D'‚Äîeach consisting of three platoons.Long 1952 p. 52. These companies were supported by a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company with six specialist platoons: signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administrative and mortars.Kuring 2004, p. 494. Forming part of the 26th Brigade along with the 2/23rd and 2/24th Battalions, it was assigned to the 7th Division during its initial training period but was later transferred with the rest of the 26th Brigade to the 9th Division. After pre-embarkation leave, the battalion undertook three weeks of collective training at Woodside, in October.Glenn 1987, p. 5. The following month, the battalion marched through the city of Adelaide prior to its deployment overseas, and shortly afterwards embarked for North Africa. Entraining at Oakbank, after undertaking a route march in full equipment,Glenn 1987, p. 6. the battalion embarked upon the troopship Stratheden on 17 November 1940; the large transport set sail the following day.Macklin 2008, p. 136. =Actions in North Africa= Sailing via Colombo where the troops were given a brief shore leave, the Stratheden entered the Suez Canal in mid-December 1940.Glenn 1987, p. 10. Upon arrival in the Middle East, the battalion briefly occupied a camp at El Kantara, before moving to Dimra, in Palestine.Glenn 1987, p. 11. At Dimra, the battalion joined the rest of the 26th Brigade for the first time,Glenn 1987, p. 14. and undertook further training until March 1941. At this time, it moved to Cyrenica, along with the rest of the 9th Division, to undertake further training in the desert and to relieve the 6th Division which was deploying to Greece. Shortly after this, the Germans landed forces in Africa to reinforce the Italians and as the Axis went on the offensive, the British and Commonwealth forces in Libya were forced to retreat from Benghazi to the strategically important port town of Tobruk. In early April, the 2/48th fell back as part of the general retreat, setting up a blocking position around Tmimi during the withdrawal to prevent a German force cutting the division's route along the coast road.Wilmot 1993, p. 77. After eight days of constant movement through the desert, the battalion reached the port.Wilmot 1993, p. 82. They subsequently took part in the defence of Tobruk, where the battalion saw its first action of the North African Campaign for which it would receive one of its many battle honours. The 2/48th first entered Tobruk's defences on 9 April 1941 with the rest of the 9th Division commanded by Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead. Instructed to hold the fortress for eight weeks by General Archibald Wavell, Commander- in-Chief of British Middle East Command, the 9th Division ended up defending the fortress for over eight months before being gradually withdrawn. The defensive system at Tobruk consisted of several lines: the outer position consisted of scattered perimeter posts and reserve company positions and was dubbed the \\"Red Line\\", while the secondary defence system, which was about behind the \\"Red Line\\", was dubbed the \\"Blue Line\\".Wilmot 1993, pp. 85‚Äì86. During this time the battalion alternated between occupying part of the main defence line, working in the rear areas, and conducting patrols. In mid-April, while the battalion was stationed in the western sector, these patrols resulted in the battalion capturing virtually the entire 1st Battalion of the Italian 62nd Regiment, Trento Division, totalling nearly 800 officers and men.Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 183.Wilmot 1993, pp. 116‚Äì118. Later that month, the 2/48th took part in a daylight raid on a hill opposite their perimeter, behind which the Italians were massing artillery, tanks and infantry. Supported by British tanks from the 7th Royal Tank Regiment, the raid caught the defenders by surprise, resulting in the capture of over 360 more Italians, as well as large quantities of weapons and vehicles for only light casualties.Wilmot 1993, pp. 120‚Äì121. In late May, a 2/48th patrol snuck out from the perimeter overnight, and evading German patrols, pushed south, where they set up an ambush and laid a series of land mines along a bypass track that was being used by German supply lorries, two of which were subsequently destroyed. In July, the battalion moved to the Bardia road sector, opposite the Italians.Wilmot 1993, pp. 222 & 233. By October, the majority of the 9th Division, including the 2/48th Battalion, was withdrawn by sea as the British 70th Division arrived to take over the garrison.Wilmot 1993, pp. 280‚Äì287. Overall, the 2/48th suffered 160 casualties at Tobruk, including 38 men killed and another 18 who died of their wounds.Johnston 2002, p. 248. alt=Soldiers wearing helmets sit in a sandbagged position near a machine gun After Tobruk, the 9th Division was sent to Palestine and Syria in order to train and rest, and to undertake garrison duties as part of the Allied occupation force that had been established their following the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign. Under their new commander, Lieutenant Colonel Heathcote Hammer‚Äîwho had assumed command after Windeyer took over the 20th Brigade‚Äîthe 2/48th proceeded to train in high terrain and temperatures.Johnston 2002, p. 68. In late June 1942, Axis forces commanded by General Erwin Rommel, crossed the Egyptian frontier as part of an offensive aimed at capturing Alexandria. After making a brief stand around Mersa Matruh, the British Eighth Army was forced to withdraw towards the Alamein line.Glenn 1987, p. 101. In response, the 9th Division was transported south from Syria, and hurriedly committed to First Battle of El Alamein. On 1 July, Rommel's forces launched a determined assault on the Alamein line, and on 7 July the 9th Division was ordered to launch a counter- attack. As part of this plan, the 2/48th was ordered to traverse the coastline and capture the Trig 33 ridge north of the \\"Tel el Eisa\\" station, commencing their attack shortly before dawn on 10 July.Glenn 1987, p. 105. After an initial artillery bombardment that disrupted the Italian troops, the main objective of the attack (Trig 33) was captured and 400 Italians were taken prisoner. The 2/48th then advanced south and captured Tel el Eisa station, which was successfully defended against a number of Axis counter- attacks.Johnston 2002, p. 77. On 22 July, the battalion was ordered to capture West Point 24 on the Tel El Eisa ridge which was held by heavily entrenched Axis forces. However, after initial success, the 2/48th came under heavy artillery and mortar fire and was forced to withdraw, having suffered over 100 casualties.Johnston 2002, p. 87. For actions during this attack, Private Stan Gurney was awarded the battalion's first Victoria Cross (VC) after he captured a machine-gun post and bayoneted the gun crew that was firing on his company, and then went on to capture a second post before being killed while taking a third. In total, the 2/48th suffered 215 casualties in the period 7 July to 23 October 1942, with 64 men killed, six dying of their wounds and 125 wounded. In August, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery took over command of the British Eighth Army and he succeeded in preventing the Axis advance during the Battle of Alam el Halfa. Montgomery then began preparing for an Allied offensive against the Axis forces that were now entrenching themselves. The Second Battle of El Alamein started on 23 October and finished on 7 November with Axis forces withdrawing westwards towards Fuka to avoid encirclement. The 2/48th Battalion was engaged around Tel el Eisa, on the right of the Allied line near the coast, during this period, as the 20th and 26th Brigades pushed westwards and then endured numerous counterattacks as the Germans sought to regain control of the strategically important coast road. By the end of the month, the battalion had been heavily depleted. Having started with nearly 700 men in the line, after a week of fighting, the battalion could field only 41 fit men. As a result, the 26th Brigade was rotated out of the line just before the final German counterattack was repulsed, allowing the Allies to launch the final breakout phase of the operation.Coulthard-Clark 1998, pp. 230‚Äì232. For their actions during this offensive two members of the 2/48th were awarded Victoria Crosses. The battalion's second VC was awarded to Sergeant Bill Kibby for actions across a one-week period. Kibby had charged several Axis positions and was subsequently killed attacking an enemy position with grenades on 31 October.Arthur 2005, pp. 248‚Äì249. Private Percy Gratwick earned the battalion's third VC on 25 October in the same area as Kibby. His platoon had been reduced to seven men by enemy fire so Gratwick charged the nearest enemy position of his own volition. He killed the occupants, destroyed the post with grenades and was proceeding to neutralise another position when he too was killed. Overall, the 2/48th suffered a further 344 casualties in the period 23 October to 5 November 1942 with 85 men killed, 13 dying of their wounds and 243 wounded.Johnston 2002, p. 249. These losses resulted in the battalion being withdrawn from the line just as the battle reached its climax in early November. As the Allies went on the advance, the battalion moved back to Tel el Eisa, during which time it was slowly rebuilt as men who had been wounded were returned to unit, or replaced by reinforcements; this process would continue into the new year.Glenn 1987, pp. 171-181. After helping to secure victory at El Alamein the 9th Division moved to Gaza in Palestine on 3 December. Since the previous October, the Australian government had sought to bring the division back to Australia in order to use it against the Japanese in the Pacific, along with the 6th and 7th Divisions which had been withdrawn the year before, and on 15 December the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, had finally agreed to provide the necessary shipping.Johnston 2002, p. 135. Following a divisional parade at Gaza, the 2/48th Battalion embarked upon the troopship Nieuw Amsterdam on 24 January 1943.Johnston 2002, pp. 138‚Äì140. =Fighting in New Guinea= The convoy carrying the battalion put into Fremantle in mid-February, where the small number of Western Australian personnel disembarked to begin their home leave. The rest of the battalion continued on to Port Melbourne, before moving to Adelaide by rail. In late March, after the South Australian personnel had completed their leave, the battalion was re-constituted.Glenn 1987, pp. 184-185. At that time, a series of parades were held in every Australian capital city to welcome home the 9th Division;Johnston 2002, p. 141. the 2/48th marched through Adelaide. After this, the 2/48th were transported to the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, where they established a camp on the Barron River, near Kairi.Glenn 1987, p. 187. In April 1943, the battalion was re-organised and re-trained for jungle operations in the South-West Pacific theatre in order to prepare it for the conditions in New Guinea.Johnston 2002, p. 143. Undertaking training on the Tablelands, the battalion was converted to the tropical establishment. Warfare in the Pacific posed unique problems and differed greatly to that which the 2/48th had experienced in North Africa. In the jungles of New Guinea logistics and transport were significant challenges and in order to meet them, the battalion's size was reduced by over 100 men, to around 800, as its anti- aircraft and Bren carrier platoons were disbanded, while each of the battalion's four rifle companies lost most of their organic motor transport; the mobility issue would be solved by marching on foot as vehicles were relatively useless in dense jungle, while supplies would be brought up using native carriers as well as by air.Coates 1999, p. 49.Palazzo 2001, p. 184. In July 1943, the battalion moved to Cairns where they undertook amphibious training with the American 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment around Trinity Beach as part of their final preparations before being committed to the fighting in New Guinea.Johnston 2002, p. 146.Macklin 2008, pp. 144‚Äì145. Sailing aboard the , after arriving in New Guinea in early August, the 2/48th established a camp around Milne Bay where they undertook further amphibious training,Glenn 1987, pp. 194‚Äì196. before taking part in the landing around Lae on 4 September 1943, as part of the final phase of the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign. This was the first large-scale amphibious landing conducted by the Australian forces since the landings at Gallipoli in 1915, and the battalion, along with the rest of the 26th Brigade, landed on Red Beach, about north-west of Lae.Johnston 2002, pp. 147‚Äì148. They subsequently advanced westwards, and on 14 September captured Malahang airstrip. Following the fall of Lae to the 7th Division‚Äîwhich had advanced from Nadzab as part of the two-pronged assault‚Äîon 16 September, the Allies hurriedly launched a follow up campaign on the Huon Peninsula. Initially, only one brigade was committed to the operation, and so the 2/48th Battalion remained around Lae until the 26th Brigade was transported by sea to Finschhafen in late October in order to reinforce the 20th Brigade, which had landed the month previous in an effort to follow up troops withdrawing from Lae, before coming under heavy Japanese counterattack.Johnston 2002, pp. 159‚Äì160. During this time the battalion took part in repelling an attempted landing at Scarlet Beach, as the Japanese launched a counteroffensive against the Australian lodgement. alt=A soldier raises the Australian flag After the Japanese counteroffensive was defeated in late October 1943, Australian attention turned to Sattleberg, the site of an abandoned Lutheran mission. The newly arrived 26th Brigade was chosen to lead the assault as it was fresher than the division's other brigades.Johnston 2002, pp. 162‚Äì163. The main advance began on 17 November, although the battalion took part in a preliminary attack on Green Ridge the previous day in order to secure the start line for the advance.Johnston 2002, pp. 167‚Äì168. Pushing north-west from Jivevaneng in company with Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion, the 2/48th began the drive towards Sattleberg.Keogh 1965, p. 329. In difficult terrain and against stubborn Japanese defence,Keogh 1965, p. 330. the advance made slow progress, nevertheless by 22 November Steeple Tree Hill was captured and the battalion reached the southern slopes of the Sattelberg feature, about from its summit.Johnston 2002, p. 179. On 24 November, the 2/48th's 'C' Company carried out a surprise attack on the position from the south-east. Crossing Siki Creek, the company stepped off shortly before 17:30 hours and reached the base of a steep cliff, from where they began their assault on the summit.Johnston 2002, p. 180. Held up by machine gun fire and grenades that were lobbed from the Japanese position above, and finding it almost impossible to move up the hill which had a gradient of between 45 and 60 degrees, the attack appeared in danger of failure as light began to fade and ammunition ran low. However, the actions of one of the company's platoon commanders, Sergeant Tom Derrick, reinvigorated the attack. Laying his sections down to provide covering fire, he went forward alone armed with a rifle and a quantity of grenades, attacking the Japanese positions as he went. In the end he accounted for 10 such posts, before the attack was halted from the summit. During the night, the company clung to the edge of the plateau upon which the Sattelberg mission was situated, as fresh supplies were brought up from the rear. The attack was resumed at 08:35 hours the next day, supported by heavy artillery and mortar fire, however, as the 2/48th crested the ridge they found the position unoccupied, with the Japanese having abandoned it the previous night.Keogh 1965, p. 332. For his actions the previous day, Derrick was given the honour of raising the Australian flag over the mission and was later awarded a Victoria Cross‚Äîthe battalion's fourth‚Äîto go with the Distinguished Conduct Medal he had received for actions during the fighting around El Alamein.Johnston 2002, pp. 180‚Äì181. Later, Derrick was sent to an Officer Training Unit, after which he was commissioned and, returned to the battalion as a lieutenant;Johnston 2002, p. 191. this was a departure from usual Army policy and was the result of intensive lobbying on Derrick's behalf.Long 1963, p. 77.Stanley 1997, p.34. Following the capture of Sattelberg, the 2/48th continued the advance north along with the rest of the 26th Brigade, pushing on over difficult terrain to Wareo, where they arrived on 8 December.Keogh 1965, pp. 332‚Äì334. Following this, the Japanese began to fall back to Sio in retreat and the battalion's involvement in combat operations on the peninsula came to an end as troops from the 5th Division arrived to relieve them. In January, the battalion camped around the Dallman River before being withdrawn back to Finschhafen, camping around the Song River.Glenn 1987, p. 225. In February 1944, the 2/48th was withdrawn back to Australia along with the 9th Division. Sailing aboard an American Liberty ship, the battalion landed in Brisbane on 20 February, and made camp at Kalinga before personnel marched out for a long period of home leave.Glenn 1987, p. 226. During its time in New Guinea, the battalion had suffered 125 casualties, of which 36 were killed, three died of wounds, eight died of illness and 77 were wounded. =Landing on Tarakan= The battalion began reforming near Ravenshoe, on the Atherton Tablelands in April 1944. During this time the composition of the units of the 9th Division underwent significant changes as many men were discharged due to medical reasons or transferred to other units and young replacements were brought in;Johnston 2002, p. 186. many of the battalion's original members had been struck down by sickness during the fighting in New Guinea.Glenn 1987, p. 227. A long period of training followed during which the battalion undertook a number of exercises, including amphibious operations with British Royal Marines on the Glenearn and . Finally, following more than a year training in Australia the battalion was committed to its final deployment of the war, moving to Morotai Island in April 1945 in order to take part in the landing on Tarakan as part of Operation Oboe.Long 1963, p. 406. Embarking from Cairns, the battalion was transported in two ships, the Sea Cat and the Van Heutz, the battalion arrived on Morotai later in the month, where the battalion undertook a series of manoeuvres, exercising with armour and at night, to prepare them for the coming campaign. On 22 April, the battalion embarked upon , practicing beach landings for a week before setting sail for their objective.Glenn 1987, pp. 233‚Äì235. alt=Soldiers operating a mortar amidst a jungle scene The entire 26th Brigade group was assigned the task of capturing Tarakan Island and destroying the Japanese garrison and the assault began on 1 May 1945. Embarking on Manoora, the 2/48th was in the first wave of the attack, leading the brigade in at 07:15 hours, landing on Red Beach, on the left flank of the lodgement, from Tarakan town on the western side of the island, with the 2/23rd on their right.Keogh 1965, p. 441.Long 1963, p. 414. The preliminary bombardment had been successful, and as the battalion came ashore they were largely unopposed, allowing the landing craft to get in close to the shore.Long 1963, p. 415. Pushing inland, the 2/48th had secured its primary objectives by 08:38 hours. The right forward company took sporadic fire as it secured the oil tanks, while the battalion's left hand company was able to capture the bridge over the Sibengkok River and the high feature overlooking the landing beach without meeting any resistance. Advancing inland, the Japanese pillboxes that had fired on the right forward company were secured after they were abandoned by the defenders. A company was then sent along the Anzac Highway to secure Collins Highway ridge. By 13:40 hours the western end of the ridge had been secured, however, the battalion began taking fire from the east. Forward momentum was maintained, although the 2/48th suffered a number of casualties, and by the end of the day a by beachhead had been established, and the battalion had companies on Collins Highway ridge, one on the \\"Parks\\" feature and another at \\"Finch\\".Johnston 2002, p. 201. Over the course of the next couple of days, Japanese resistance to the Australian advance increased. After the Australians secured the island's airfield and the low ground along the west coast, throughout May and into June significant engagements took place in the hills surrounding Tarakan town. On 2 May, the 2/48th captured Lyons Ridge, before pressing on towards Tarakan Hill, where they assaulted the \\"Sykes\\" feature supported by Matilda tanks from the 2/9th Armoured Regiment. Here they experienced their heaviest losses of the campaign, losing six killed and 26 wounded during the three assaults up the steep slopes of the feature.Johnston 2002, pp. 209‚Äì210. Their next major engagement came in late May when the 2/48th took part in fighting around Freda Ridge as part of the drive on the main Japanese position around Fukukaku.Johnston 2002, p. 216. A company-level attack was put in and after stiff resistance the ridge was captured. The following morning, as the battalion waited for a Japanese counterattack, Tom Derrick, who had played a key role in capturing the position the previous day, was mortally wounded. He subsequently died on 24 May 1945.Stanley 1997, p. 147. In June, major combat operations on the island ceased and the Australians began the mopping up phase of the campaign as the Australians sought to clear isolated pockets of Japanese troops that had evaded capture.Johnston 2002, p. 218. These operations continued into July.Keogh 1965, p. 443. During this time, the 2/48th was assigned a sector near the Pamusian River on the eastern coast, as well as Tarakan town and the centre of the island. The battalion's involvement in the Borneo campaign resulted in 174 casualties, including 37 killed and nine died of wounds or from accident.Long 1963, p. 451.Glenn 1987, p. 272. =Disbandment= Following the end of hostilities in August, the battalion remained on Tarakan to undertake garrison duties. During this time it undertook patrol operations to bring in the various pockets of Japanese troops who had not learned of the surrender; these were dangerous operations and in an effort to reduce casualties, the patrols went out with several Japanese prisoners to help talk their former comrades into surrendering.Glenn 1987, p. 261. As the demobilisation process began, its numbers dwindled as long-serving men were repatriated back to Australia, while others with only limited service were transferred to other units for further service. Finally, on 25 October 1945,Glenn 1987, p. 263. while still on Tarakan, the battalion was disbanded. The occasion was marked by a small ceremony at Tarakan involving the unit's remaining members. The battalion's equipment was transferred to the newly raised 66th Battalion, along with a draft of volunteers for occupation duties in Japan with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Those that did not volunteer to serve in Japan were transferred to the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion.Morgan 2018, p. 27. During the course of the war a total of 2,838 men served with the 2/48th Battalion, of whom 343 men were killed in action or died on active service, 675 were wounded, and 20 captured.Johnston 2002, p. 247. According to the Australian War Memorial the 2/48th Battalion was \\"Australia's highest decorated unit of the Second World War\\". Four members of the battalion received the Victoria Cross, three of them posthumously. Other decorations awarded to members of the 2/48th included: four Distinguished Service Orders, 12 Military Crosses, 10 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 24 Military Medals and 36 Mentions in Despatches.Johnston 2002, p. 253.

When the Anglo-Spanish War began in 1654, he was made joint commander of an expedition against Spanish possessions in the West Indies, known as the 'Western Design'. Although he captured Jamaica, which remained a British colony for over 300 years, the project was considered a failure. This ended his military career, and he retired to an estate near Wincham, Cheshire. Prior to the 1660 Restoration, he briefly served as Governor of Chester. Although considered politically loyal, he was also a Congregationalist; his religious views made him unacceptable to the new regime, and he was removed from office. In 1662, he published a treatise on fishing, The Experienced Angler, with a preface by Izaak Walton, which went through five editions in his lifetime. He died in 1687. Biography Robert Venables was the son of Robert Venables of Antrobus, Cheshire and Ellen Simcox, daughter of Richard Simcox of Rudheath. The Venables were a cadet branch of a family that could trace their ancestry back to the Norman Conquest, and were classed as members of the minor gentry. His first wife was Elizabeth Rudyard; the exact date of their marriage and her death are unknown, but based on their children, they married sometime in mid 1630s, and she died after 1649. Only two of the five survived into adulthood; Thomas (1640-1659), and Frances (1638-1692). In 1654, he married Elizabeth (1614‚Äì1689), mother of seven, and widow of Thomas Lee of Darnhall, Cheshire. Her eldest surviving son Thomas married Frances Venables, while Thomas Venables married her daughter Elizabeth Lee, despite already being already engaged to a girl in Dublin. Their marriage was not a success; she allegedly 'disliked his politics, disdained his religion, and disapproved of his manners.' When he died, his property at Wincham was inherited by Frances. Wars of the Three Kingdoms Almost nothing is known of his career prior to 1642; when the First English Civil War began in August 1642, he raised a company for the Manchester garrison. In December, he was captured in a skirmish near Westhoughton, Lancashire but quickly released. The Venables family had long-standing connections to the Breretons, one of the most powerful families in Cheshire; for the rest of the war, he served under Sir William Brereton, the local Parliamentarian commander. Despite lacking military experience, Brereton proved an energetic and resolute commander, winning minor victories in March 1643 at Middlewich and Hopton Heath. Establishing his headquarters at Nantwich, he soon attained superiority over Arthur Capell, Royalist commander in Shropshire, Cheshire, and North Wales. From August to September 1643, Venables was based at Cholmondeley, from where he launched a number of attacks on local Royalist positions. His actions were part of a wider objective of putting pressure on Royalist-held Chester, which was essential for funnelling men and material from their supporters in Ireland and North Wales. Their success led to Capell's replacement by Lord Byron in October 1643. Byron assembled an army of over 5,000, many of them veterans from the war in Ireland, and defeated the Parliamentarians at Second Middlewich in December. Brereton appealed to Sir Thomas Fairfax for support. At Nantwich in January 1644, their combined force routed Byron, who lost over 1,500 men and most of his artillery. He retreated into Chester, where he remained. Venables spent much of the next two years as governor of Tarvin, part of the blockade of Chester, which finally surrendered in February 1646. By now, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel; although Brereton recommended him as governor of Chester, he was sent to reduce the remaining Royalist garrisons in North Wales before the war ended in June. Despite victory, the cost of the war, a poor 1646 harvest, and a recurrence of the plague left Parliament unable to pay their soldiers. In summer 1647, the garrison of Nantwich mutinied; Venables restored order, and was rewarded with an appointment as governor of Liverpool in January 1648, a position he held during the Second English Civil War. In 1649, he was promoted colonel, and recruited a regiment of Cheshire veterans to serve in the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. These troops sailed from Chester in time to take part in the Battle of Rathmines on 2 August, a decisive victory over the Irish Confederates. After the storming of Drogheda‚Äîin which his regiment played a key role in preventing the retreating Royalists from raising the drawbridge to the north side of the town, assuring Cromwell's speedy victory and the massacre that followed it‚Äî Cromwell, who headed south towards Wexford, promoted Venables to major general of Ulster and Governor of Derry, and sent him in command of a detachment, to join Sir Charles Coote in Ulster. On his march Venables defeated Colonel Mark Trevor and Hugh, Lord Ards at the battle of Dromore, and captured Newry and Carlingford. cites Caryle, Cromwell, Letters cvi. cxv.; Carte, Ormond, iii. 475) Belfast surrendered to him early in October, and in December he and Sir Charles Coote defeated Hugh, Lord Ards at the Battle of Lisnagarvey , and took Carrickfergus. cites Borlase, App. p. 24; J. T. Gilbert Aphorismical Discovery of Treasonable Faction, iii. 159. On 21 June 1650 Venables assisted Coote to defeat the army of Bishop Heber McMahon at the Battle of Scariffhollis and to help in the failed assault of Charlemont, after which the garrison of the town surrendered with terms on 14 August. He was also involved in the campaign against the Earl of Clanricarde, the commander of the last Irish Confederate field army, who fled to France in December 1650. Over the next two years Venables fought a counter insurgency war against tories in the bogs of north Connaught and south-west Ulster, eventually forcing Colonel Tirlogh O'Neill and Lieutenant- general O'Farrell to capitulate. cites Gilbert Aphorismical Discovery, iii. 320, 336; Ludlow, Memoirs, ed. 1894, i. 318, 522; Borlase, App. p. 28; History of the War of Ireland by an Officer of Sir John Clotworthy's Regiment, 1873, pp. 88, 99, 117, 133. On 9 December 1651 Irish lands to the value of ¬£1,223 were ordered him for his arrears of pay, cites Gilbert Aphorismical Discovery, iii. 273. but that did not cover all his arrears and he was active in trying to get backpay for both himself and him men. In 1653 he was busy drafting regulation to impose the draconian 1652 Act of Settlement, but not so busy as to find time to oppose the imposition regulations that would have seen the reintroduction of enforced Presbyterianism in Ulster, presumably because like many in the New Model Army he was a Congregationalist. The West Indies expedition In May 1654 Venables left Ireland, and on 9 December following he was appointed general of the forces sent by the Protector Oliver Cromwell to attack the Spanish in the West Indies.\\"His commission is printed in Thurloe's State Papers, iii. 115. The instructions of the Protector and his council gave Venables the full latitude of choice as to the point to attack, suggested various places, but declined to tie his hands, ordering him simply \\"to gain an interest in that part of the West Indies in possession of the Spaniards\\". cites G. Penn , Life of Sir W. Penn, ii. 28. He was, however, to consult with Sir William Penn, the admiral commanding the fleet employed in the expedition, and with two commissioners, Edward Winslow and Gregory Butler, on the method of carrying out his instructions. The expedition set sail in December 1654, reached Barbados at the end of January, where additional forces were embarked, and arrived at Hispaniola on 13 April. A landing was effected with about eight thousand men some forty miles west of the capital, and the army marched through the woods to attack it. After suffering two disastrous defeats from the Spaniards on 17 and 25 April, Venables, complaining loudly of the cowardice of his men, decided to give up the attempt, and sailed for Jamaica. That island was reached on 10 May, the chief town occupied with very little fighting, and the governor forced to capitulate on 17 May. The Spaniards retired into the woods and hills, whence they continued their resistance; the expedition was badly equipped with provisions and other necessaries, and sickness decimated the ranks of the army.C.V. Black, History of Jamaica (London: Collins, 1975), pp. 46-57. The Spanish freed their slaves, who became Jamaican Maroons in the mountainous interior, and they fought on the side of the Spanish against the English invaders. There were two separate bands of Maroons, led by Juan de Bolas and Juan de Serras respectively, and they effectively repelled any attempts by the English to subdue them.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-17. Penn with part of the fleet sailed home on 25 June, and Venables himself followed in the Marston Moor on 4 July. Venables had been ill ever since reaching Hispaniola, and by this time was thought to be at the point of death. But, apart from reasons of health, he was anxious to get to England to clear himself from responsibility for the failure at Hispaniola, and to represent to the Protector the needs of the colony at Jamaica. cites Thurloe, vol. iii. passim; Life of Penn, ii. 28‚Äì132; Carte, Original Letters, ii. 46‚Äì52; Report on the Manuscripts of the Duke of Portland, ii. 90‚Äì8. When he arrived at Portsmouth on 9 September 1655, he described himself as \\"in a recovering condition\\", but almost a skeleton, and so weak that he could neither stand nor ride. cites Report on the Manuscripts of the Duke of Portland, ii. 97. On 20 September he appeared before the Council of State, and was immediately committed to the Tower of London. Penn shared the same fate. On 30 October Venables was released from his imprisonment, on condition of surrendering his general's commission and his command in Ireland, cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1655, pp. 327, 343, 402. and obtained no further employment during the protectorate. The historian C.H. Firth, writing in the DNB in 1889, was of the opinion that the main cause of the failure at Hispaniola and the reason for the imprisonment of the two generals was the lack of cordial co-operation on the part of both. The errors committed by Venables himself in the management of his attack were equally fatal, and he never obtained the confidence either of his officers or his soldiers. cites cf. Penn, ii. 32; Thurloe, iii. 646, 754. His army, however, was composed of very inferior and undisciplined troops hastily got together and badly equipped. His wife, who accompanied him, says in her journal: \\"The success was ill, for the work of God was not like to be done by the devil's instruments. A wicked army it was, and sent out without arms or provisions\\". In the opinion of the historian John Morrill, writing in the ODNB in 2004, \\"[Venables] was over-promoted and under-supported in a high- profile fiasco in the Caribbean that cost him his reputation. He had to live out his life as a disgraced man with a sharp-tongued wife who disapproved of all he stood for\\". Later career After the dismissal of the Second Protector Richard Cromwell, Venables began to promote the restoration of the monarchy, though he cautiously avoided taking part in Booth's Insurrection.C.H. Firth dismisses as fiction the story told in the life of Dr. John Barwick, that a royalist lady induced him to undertake the overthrow of Cromwell, and he purposed employing the troops raised for the expedition to the West Indies for that object ( cites Life of Dr. John Barwick, ed. 1724, pp. 165, 184). When George Monck, the English military governor of Scotland, came into England at the head of his troops, he appointed Venables governor of Chester. cites 25 February 1660; Clarke MSS. Initially Edward Hyde, a close advisor to Charles II of England while the latter was in exile, was in favour of the appointment, cites (Life of Dr. John Barwick, pp. 431, 451, 522) but on taking advise from the local Cheshire Royalists, pressed successfully for his dismissal because of the worries expressed over Venables religious Independency. Venables obtained nothing at the Restoration. In 1664 he was informed against as concerned in what was known as the Farnley Wood Plot, but the charge met with no belief. cites Cal. State Papers, Dom. 1663‚Äì4, p. 512. He sheltered William Veitch when he was in hiding in England after the Pentland Rising, and seems to have remained a nonconformist. cites McCrie, Memoirs of Veitch and Brysson, 1825, p. 23; Autobiography of Henry Newcome, ii. 207. He died in July 1687, aged 75. Legacy In 1662, Venables published The Experienced Angler, or Angling improved, being a general discourse of angling, imparting many of the aptest ways and choicest experiments for the taking of most sorts of fish in pond or river, duodecimo. To it is prefixed an epistle by Izaak Walton to his ingenious friend the author. \\"I have read\\", says Walton, \\"and practised by many books of this kind ‚Ä¶ yet I could never find in them that height for judgment and reason which you have manifested in this\\". There were five printed editions during Venables' lifetime, the last in 1683. There was a further edition in 1827 with a life of Venables prefixed in it.
