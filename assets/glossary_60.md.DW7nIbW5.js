The painting, which belongs to the early 19th century, was painted by an unknown artist. The painting itself measures about 114.3 cm in height and 45.7 cm in width. With the decorative elements, the complete painting measures 200.7 cm in height and 62.9 cm in width. This painting represents a combination of two established themes of Korean painting: birds and flowers. Also it consists of ten symbols of longevity‚Äîthe sun, mountains eater, rocks, clouds, pine trees, turtles, cranes, deers and mushrooms. In the central scene, there is a cock and hens perched on a tree and a rock respectively. This represents fortune and future. Currently, the painting is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, United States. Description In the traditional Chinese culture, the rooster had been given a significant place. Ancient Chinese people believed that the rooster was a kind of moral animal with excellent qualities. This aspect also affected the neighboring Asian countries. In the Joseon dynasty of the Korean peninsula, auspicious creatures such as the tiger, dragon, crane and deer were represented in a series of artworks demonstrating the importance and universality of these creatures in the Korean Art and culture. The painting, \\"Golden Cock and Hen\\" was created in the early 19th century AD, during Korean peninsula‚Äôs Joseon dynasty. The painting itself measures 114.3 cm in height and 45.7 cm in width. With the external decorative elements, the complete piece measures 200.7 cm in height and 62.9 cm in width. Due to the lack of documentation, the artist and the specific creation date of the painting cannot be predicated. In 1919, this painting was granted to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York by Rogers Foundation. Between 1984 and 2015 the painting has been displayed seven times in New York, New Orleans, Honolulu, San Francisco, Tulsa and Los Angeles.

His early childhood coincided with Michael's quick rise through the ranks of boyardom, peaking in 1593, when Michael became Prince and Nicolae his heir apparent. As he began a quest to emancipate Wallachia from the Ottoman Empire, Michael used his son as a party to alliances with the Holy Roman Empire and the Principality of Transylvania, proposing him as either a hostage or a matrimonial guarantee. While entering the Long Turkish War on the Christian side, Michael also negotiated a settlement with the Ottomans, again offering Nicolae as a guarantee. With the strengthening of Michael's alliance with the Habsburg Monarchy in 1599, Nicolae participated in Michael's conquest of Transylvania. In December 1599 he was sent back to Wallachia to rule as Prince, while Michael took direct charge of Transylvania and then conquered Moldavia. Some records suggest that Nicolae was considered, or considered himself, a Prince of Moldavia, though that title was more likely held by a cousin, Marcu Cercel. In late 1600, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Moldavia invaded Wallachia and chased out Nicolae, replacing him with Simion MovilƒÉ. Michael was also chased out of Transylvania by his former ally Giorgio Basta and a large faction of the Hungarian nobility. In negotiating his peace with the latter, he sent Nicolae and Stanca as hostages. They were assigned ownership of GilƒÉu, but, following clashes between Basta and the Hungarians, were taken by the latter to a harsher imprisonment in FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Citadel. Basta assassinated Michael in August 1601, but then liberated the family, with the ostensibly pro-Habsburg Nicolae still vying for the Wallachian throne. In 1602, the Wallachian crown went to Radu »òerban of Coiani, who had previously been Nicolae's Paharnic. Mutilated by his rival, Nicolae settled in the Archduchy of Austria, joining the regional court of Ferdinand Habsburg. He later moved to Habsburg Hungary, living mostly in Tyrnau with his own retinue. He litigated over his father's assets, which had been confiscated by the Empire, and set out to redeem his memory, while also involving himself in conspiracies for the recovery of Wallachia. From 1610, he reconciled with Radu »òerban, becoming his Postelnic and assisting with his expedition into Burzenland. He welcomed the older Prince in exile, after he was deposed by the Ottomans in 1611, and two years later married his daughter, Ana. From then until 1620, the two former Princes participated in anti-Ottoman projects that also involved the Duke of Nevers, the Movile»ôti, and Gaspar Graziani. During the Thirty Years' War, which began after Ferdinand took the imperial throne in 1619, Nicolae and Radu »òerban joined a Habsburg coalition against Gabriel Bethlen's Transylvania. They themselves were chased out of Tyrnau by Bethlen's offensive, and both died of gout within seven years of each other, leaving the family in destitution. In the 1640s, Nicolae's son Mihai was asked by Wallachian Prince Matei Basarab to become his crown prince, but this request did not suit Habsburgs policies, and was dropped. Nicolae's widow and his daughter Ilinca were allowed passage, and repatriated both Princes' remains, which were buried together at Comana Monastery. Ilinca went on to marry a high-ranking boyar, Istratie Leurdeanu. Name In a document which uses the courtly language, Church Slavonic, Nicolae describes himself as: (\\"By the Grace of God Io Niecolaie Voivode and Hospodar of the Entire Hungro-Wallachian Country\\").Iorga (1934), pp. 76‚Äì77 Historian Nicolae Iorga highlights the exotic nature of Nicolae's baptismal name, in its temporal context. The last Prince of Wallachia to have been crowned under that name was the 14th-century Nicolae Alexandru, whose memory had faded, and it was only used since by the pretender Nicolaus Bassaraba.Iorga (1934), p. 77 The latter, a scion of the Craiove»ôti, had made his most successful bid for the throne in 1563‚Äì1564.Neagoe, p. 197; Rezachevici (1998), p. 55 Iorga proposes that both Bassaraba and PƒÉtra»ôcu were in fact named in honor of their supposed common ancestor, Neagoe Basarab, both of them with a synophone.Iorga (1934), p. 77 Scholar »òtefan MihƒÉilescu believes that Michael the Brave may have named his son in direct homage to Saint Nicholas, whom he credited as his personal protector.MihƒÉilescu, p. 41 In Moldavia, the Prince was generally known as Neculai or Nicola,Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 although one Moldavian document of 1600 refers to him as Petru VodƒÉ (\\"Peter the Voivode\\").Grigora»ô, p. 9 The derivative PƒÉtra»ôcu appears in Nicolae's signatures in New Latin, which style him as Nicolaus Petrasko WaiwodaIorga (1934), p. 79 or Nicolaus Petrascus Waiwoda.Cernovodeanu, pp. 219, 221 The registers of the Hof-Bibliothek, also kept in Latin, name him as Nicolaus Petrascus or Nicolaas Petrash.Tabvlae codicvm manv scriptorvm praeter graecos et orientales in Bibliotheca palatina vindobonensi asservatorvm, Vol. VI, pp. 79, 416. Vienna: Venum dat Caroli Geroldi Filius, 1873 In Tuscan sources, his name appeared more simply as Petraschi Vaivoda.G√∂llner, p. 77; Theodorescu, p. 206 Some of the Romanian writs issued after his departure refer to him as PƒÉtra»ôco Voevod, or merely as Jupan Necula.Donat, pp. 217, 220, 225 Another early Romanian record, preserved by Nicolae's tombstone, cites him as Petra»ôco Niculae.MihƒÉilescu, p. 50 Biography =Origins and early life= Legend of Michael the Brave miraculously escaping his executioner, as depicted in an 1872 lithograph Various scholarly disputes surround the origins of Nicolae's father Michael the Brave, or Mihai Viteazul, who passed himself off as a son of PƒÉtra»ôcu the Good, from the DrƒÉcule»ôti princely clan, and therefore also as a half-brother of Petru Cercel. Some historians accept that he was Prince PƒÉtra»ôcu's son, or at least a member of his house.Gane, pp. 106‚Äì107, 138‚Äì139; Neagoe, pp. 200‚Äì201; MihƒÉilescu, p. 41; Rezachevici (1976), pp. 1989‚Äì1990; Stoicescu, pp. 64‚Äì65, 100; Theodorescu, pp. 8, 29‚Äì30 Others simply list Michael's paternal roots as disputed.M√¢rza, p. 73; Rezachevici (1976), pp. 1989‚Äì1990; Stoicescu, p. 70 Nicolae's grandmother was Teodora (Tudora), PƒÉtra»ôcu's alleged mistress. A native or resident of Ora»ôul de Floci, she was of Greek ethnicity and reportedly worked as a barmaid.Gane, pp. 138‚Äì139; Iona»ôcu, p. 166. See also Rezachevici (1976), pp. 1989‚Äì1991; Stoicescu, p. 70 In the 16th century, Wallachia was a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, which had an important say in its political life. From beginnings as an itinerant merchant, Michael joined the boyar aristocracy in 1588, when he served as lesser Ban in Mehedin»õi County, then as Stolnic.Gane, pp. 140‚Äì141; Stoicescu, pp. 70‚Äì71 According to contemporary writers such as Germanico Malaspina, Nicolae looked to be aged 12 or 13 in 1599‚Äì1600, meaning that he was born in 1586 or 1587.Gane, p. 144; Iorga (1934), p. 77; MihƒÉilescu, p. 42. See also Rezachevici (1976), pp. 1990, 1991 & (2000), p. 10 MihƒÉilescu has \\"year unknown\\". According to his research, the only reliable date to go by is 1584, the year of Michael's marriage to Lady Stanca; Nicolae was the couple's eldest child.MihƒÉilescu, p. 41 Historian Radu M√¢rza gives Nicolae's birth year as \\"approx. 1584\\",M√¢rza, p. 73 while other documentary evidence pushes the date back to ca. 1575.Rezachevici (1976), pp. 1990, 1991 Stanca, who had been previously married to Postelnic Dumitru of V√¢lcƒÉne»ôti, was a relative of the Buze»ôti boyars.Rezachevici (1976), pp. 1990, 1991; Stoicescu, pp. 35, 38, 40, 70, 172 She was also mother of Michael's daughter, Florica, who may have been born to another woman.Rezachevici (1976), p. 1990 Historians disagree on whether Florica was born ca. 1585M√¢rza, p. 73 or much earlier.Rezachevici (1976), p. 1990 She was promised in marriage to several European monarchs, but eventually wed boyar Preda \\"Floricoiu\\" of Cepturoaia.Iona»ôcu, pp. 233‚Äì234; Neagoe, pp. 196, 201; Stoicescu, pp. 57, 108, 232. See also Gane, pp. 143‚Äì144, 146, 211; Rezachevici (1976), pp. 1990, 1991 Stanca's brother was Dragomir of C√¢r»õocle»ôti, who was briefly Michael's Stolnic; this made her aunt of another boyar, Spatharios Balea, who acted as her caretaker.Iona»ôcu, pp. 60, 125, 167; Stoicescu, pp. 30, 31, 53, 69, 70, 82, 99, 103, 254 Historians have often assumed that Stanca was the sister of Vornic Dragomir Dobromirescu, but later research proved that there was no relation between them.Stoicescu, pp. 170, 171 Genealogist Constantin Gane also describes Stanca as the daughter of Logothete Radu of DrƒÉgoe»ôti and a niece of Dobromirescu,Gane, pp. 138, 140‚Äì141 though other historians reject that hypothesis.Iona»ôcu, pp. 165‚Äì167; Stoicescu, pp. 53, 82 Michael, rising to become Ban of Oltenia, fell afoul of the ruling Prince, Alexander the Wicked. According to legend, he miraculously evaded execution,MihƒÉilescu, p. 41 then left into self-exile. It is probable that Nicolae and Stanca remained behind in Oltenia.MihƒÉilescu, p. 41 Michael eventually took the throne in 1593, with crucial backing from the Ottoman potentate Andronikos Kantakouzenos. The latter is often assumed to have been a brother of Teodora, which would establish a genealogical link between Nicolae and the emerging Cantacuzino family. The interpretation remains controversial.Cazacu, p. 176; Gane, pp. 138‚Äì139; Neagoe, p. 201; Stoicescu, pp. 41, 64‚Äì65 Nicolae followed his family to Bucharest, and probably lived with them in the princely court of Pia»õa cu Flori. An oral tradition records that he owned two pet deer, which he raised on the castle grounds.MihƒÉilescu, pp. 41‚Äì42 Michael grew somewhat estranged from his wife, and kept several official mistresses. One of these was Tudora, wife of the scribe Fiera Leurdeanu,Stoicescu, pp. 203‚Äì204 who gave birth to a daughter. Named Marula, she later became wife of Clucer Socol CornƒÉ»õeanu.Gane, p. 142; Neagoe, pp. 196, 201; Stoicescu, pp. 161‚Äì162, 203‚Äì204, 206 One tradition refers to another Wallachian, the alleged son of Michael and brother of Nicolae, who ended up serving the Ottoman Empire as Hazar Pasha.Maria FrunzƒÉ, \\"√énceputurile publicisticii lui B. P. Hasdeu (Rom√¢nia, 18 noiembrie 1858‚Äî26 ianuarie 1859)\\", in Anuar de LingvisticƒÉ »ôi Istorie LiterarƒÉ, Vol. 20, 1969, p. 159 Nicolae's stay in Bucharest ended in 1594, when Michael rebelled against the Ottoman Empire. Wallachia joined the Holy League and the Holy Roman Empire, opening a new theater in the Long Turkish War. The Ottoman Army responded to the revolt by ransacking Bucharest, during which time one of Nicolae's deer was killed and the other lost.MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 The princely family fled to the fortress town of Gherghi»õa,MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 although rumor soon spread that they had been sent as hostages to the Principality of Transylvania. According to M√¢rza, the new developments had pushed Michael into using his own family as pawns in a \\"complexity of diplomatic games\\".M√¢rza, p. 74 =Becoming Prince= Michael eventually defeated the Ottoman intruders at CƒÉlugƒÉreni in August 1595. Sources differ as to what Nicolae and Stanca were doing during that interval. Some authors believe that they remained in Gherghi»õa until autumn 1596, when they finally moved to the second capital, T√¢rgovi»ôte.MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 In 1599, Michael's biographer Balthasar Walther wrote that the Prince sent \\"his woman, his children and all that he held dear\\" to safety in Hermannstadt.M√¢rza, p. 74 Other reports of the period suggests that Michael began negotiating a truce with the Ottomans, during which he offered to send Nicolae as a hostage to Istanbul.M√¢rza, p. 75 According to this narrative, Nicolae was still in Transylvania. Upon receiving news of Wallachia's rapprochement with the Ottomans, Transylvanian Princess Maria Christina ordered Michael's entire family to be quietly arrested. They remained hostages until January or February 1596.M√¢rza, pp. 74‚Äì75 Marie of Prussia, who, in 1598, was considered as a suitable wife for Nicolae Walter also suggests that Maria Christina's returning husband, Sigismund B√°thory, adhered to Michael's conciliatory lines. In July 1597, both were more openly negotiating with Sultan Mehmed III. The latter promised recognition for Michael, and for Nicolae as his rightful successor.Georgi»õƒÉ, p. 160 Around that time, Michael also negotiated the terms of a new alliance with Transylvania, promising that he would marry Nicolae to a sister of Transylvanian magnate Istv√°n J√≥sika; Florica, meanwhile, was to marry J√≥sika's son.Georgi»õƒÉ, p. 159; Neagoe, p. 201 The project was suppressed when Sigismund B√°thory refused to commit to the Holy League, prompting Michael to seek a matrimonial alliance with the Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns. Michael was especially worried when Mehmed asked for Nicolae to be sent as hostage,Georgi»õƒÉ, p. 163 pushing him back into rebellion. In 1598, he proposed that Florica marry Emperor Rudolf, and also tried to arrange Nicolae's wedding to Marie of Prussia.Neagoe, p. 201. See also Gane, pp. 143‚Äì144 That year, Nicolae was given his first official assignment, which involved greeting Imperial envoys as they arrived in T√¢rgovi»ôte.MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 In late 1597, Michael had also sent for Marcu Cercel, his alleged nephew, who had spent his childhood in Transylvania. According to the chronicler Ciro Spontone, Marcu was virtually adopted by the Prince, and was also being considered a suitor for Marula or Florica.RƒÉdulescu, pp. 55‚Äì56 Some scholars argue that, at some point in 1598 or 1599, Nicolae was dispatched to Transylvania, enrolling at the Jesuit Academy in Clausenburg. MihƒÉilescu believes that the school gave him his proficiency in New Latin.MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 However, M√¢rza cautions, no document shows whether Nicolae actually attended courses, but only that Michael had wanted him to enroll.M√¢rza, p. 75 In any case, this period ended with a sudden worsening of relations between the Holy League and Transylvania, with Andrew B√°thory taking over as the latter country's Prince. The deterioration prompted Michael to begin his conquest of Transylvania. Nicolae was by his father's side during the victory at »òelimbƒÉr (October 1599), and was then present for the fealty ceremonies at Alba Iulia.MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 For several months, Michael oscillated between the Habsburgs, who demanded his total submission, and the Ottomans, from whom he could expect recognition as Transylvanian Prince. In his dealings with either side, he offered to send Nicolae as a hostage.M√¢rza, pp. 74, 76‚Äì77 Meanwhile, Michael's reign in Wallachia was under threat, with a new offensive started by the Ottoman Army, which again tried to penetrate into Wallachia. The expedition notably included a pretender known as Cremonese Basarab, who was probably Nicolaus Bassaraba's son.Rezachevici (1998), p. 58 In early December, Michael ordered Nicolae back to T√¢rgovi»ôte by way of Bran, assigning him a 6,000-strong guard under the command of Pongr√°c Szennyey.MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 According to Gane, Stanca was made a regent, which allowed Michael to spend more time with his Transylvanian mistress, Velica Genga.Gane, pp. 142‚Äì143 Nicolae PƒÉtra»ôcu was the reigning Prince of Wallachia between December 1599 and September 1601.MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 For this reason, Michael's unification of Wallachia and Transylvania is described by various historians as mostly a dynastic union.Iorga (1934), p. 77; Neagoe, p. 196; Rezachevici (2000), pp. 5‚Äì6 According to Constantin Rezachevici, Nicolae was a full lord of his country, but his father was the \\"higher point of reference\\".Rezachevici (2000), pp. 6, 9, 10‚Äì11 As noted by Iorga, Nicolae's \\"full and uncontested\\" rule over Wallachia was meant to free Michael's had in claiming the throne of Transylvania (where he was formally governor on behalf of the Habsburgs).Iorga (1934), p. 77 He was also using the separation of offices as an instrument against Rudolf's demands. In early 1600, when Rudolf demanded Nicolae as a hostage, Michael replied that this would mean statelessness for Wallachia.M√¢rza, p. 77 Nicolae's reign over Wallachia was assisted by a Boyar Council. Andronikos Kantakouzenos, Nicolae's putative uncle, was reportedly his tutor;Cazacu, p. 178 he also managed the country's fiscal affairs, as Vistier, while Miroslav of R√¢fov was Logothete.Iorga (1934), pp. 76‚Äì78; Stoicescu, pp. 41, 72 »òerban of Coiani, who would later play a significant role in Wallachian history, was Nicolae's Paharnic.Iorga (1934), pp. 76‚Äì78; MihƒÉilescu, p. 47; Stoicescu, p. 94 At least one document confirms that Radu Buzescu was the acting Postelnic.Iorga (1934), pp. 76‚Äì78 =In Moldavia= Moldavian battle scene of ca. 1600, depicted as a struggle between Saul and David. Illustration to a manuscript ordered by Anastasie Crimca and kept at Dragomirna Monastery From his campsite in Transylvania, Michael set his sights on Moldavia, which was governed by a hostile Movile»ôti regime, closely allied with the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Initially, Michael pursued matrimonial diplomacy: Nicolae was to marry a daughter of the Moldavian Prince Ieremia MovilƒÉ.Gane, p. 159; Neagoe, p. 201 The latter refused the offer, as he was instead pushing for his brother, Simion MovilƒÉ, to take the Wallachian throne.Grigora»ô, p. 7; Neagoe, p. 201; Rezachevici (2000), pp. 6‚Äì7 Michael began preparing for war, but could only hope to succeed if he created a rift between Poland and the Movile»ôti. Around December 1599, he was considering a matrimonial alliance with the Szlachta, through both Nicolae and Florica.M√¢rza, p. 76 Early the following year, he offered to send Nicolae as a hostage to Krak√≥w. King Sigismund Vasa refused to accept, and informed Michael that he could still expect retaliation.M√¢rza, p. 76. See also Grigora»ô, pp. 7‚Äì8 Michael led his combined Wallachian‚ÄìTransylvanian force into a storming of Moldavia. His son reportedly joined in the effort, traveling with the Wallachian army along the Trotu»ô River on May 5, 1600.Rezachevici (2000), p. 8 Some twenty days later, Ieremia fled Moldavia, leaving the Wallachians in control; Nicolae had regained T√¢rgovi»ôte by that time.Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 Various historians agree that Nicolae was selected by Michael to be the new Moldavian ruler.Cernovodeanu, pp. 70‚Äì72; Grigora»ô, p. 9; Rezachevici (2000), pp. 9‚Äì10 Rezachevici nuances this verdict, arguing that Michael in fact groomed Nicolae and his heirs to rule as a single dynasty over all three countries.Rezachevici (2000), pp. 6, 8 A contemporary testimony by the Polish diplomat Andrzej Tarnowski argues the same, namely that Michael expected Sigismund Vasa to recognize \\"Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania [as belonging] to his son Nicolae, and to his heirs of the male gender.\\"Rezachevici (2000), p. 8 In June, as he rearranged the Moldavian Orthodox Church, placed under Archbishop Dionysus Rallis, Michael received the oath of office from other hierarchs. The group, including Anastasie Crimca, who took over as Bishop of RƒÉdƒÉu»õi, swore his allegiance not just to Michael, but also to Nicolae.Mircea PƒÉcurariu, Istoria Bisericii Ortodoxe Rom√¢ne. Vol. 2 (Sec. XVII »ôi XVIII), pp. 5, 15. Bucharest: Editura Institutului Biblic »ôi de Misiune OrtodoxƒÉ, 1994. ; Rezachevici (2000), p. 9 This also appears in one oath by the newly appointed p√¢rcƒÉlab of Suceava.Grigora»ô, p. 9 An interpretation of Nicolae's role in Moldavia is found in 18th-century variant of Letopise»õul Cantacuzinesc, which claims that Michael ordered Radu Buzescu to arrange Nicolae's departure for Ia»ôi. The same source reports that Michael changed his mind as the expedition was starting, and instead placed Moldavia under a regency.RƒÉdulescu, p. 56; Stoicescu, p. 36. See also Grigora»ô, p. 9 According to historian N. Grigora»ô, the Moldavian move may have been vetoed by Stanca, although some of the Moldavian boyars had proved welcoming.Grigora»ô, p. 9 One contemporary account claims that Michael no longer wanted \\"his little son\\" as ruler of a \\"a borderland, for he was still fearful of Ieremia Voivode\\". As noted by Rezachevici, this may in fact refer to his awareness that the Polish army of Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski was preparing the reconquest of Moldavia.Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 Under this Wallachian ascendancy, Moldavia's throne was most probably being prepared for Marcu Cercel.Grigora»ô, p. 10; MihƒÉilescu, p. 47; RƒÉdulescu, pp. 56‚Äì57; Rezachevici (2000), pp. 5, 10; Stoicescu, p. 37 The regency council which then emerged is generally believed to have comprised Andronikos, Hetman Udrea BƒÉleanu, Spatharios Negrea, and Arma»ô Sava.Stoicescu, pp. 41, 75, 86, 100. See also RƒÉdulescu, p. 56; Rezachevici (2000), p. 10 By June 1600 Nicolae was also styling himself \\"ruler over the whole Country of Transylvania\\".MihƒÉilescu, p. 42 In July, Michael requested from Rudolf that he and Nicolae be recognized as joint rulers of all three countries, and that their dynasty, including female descendants, be left to rule \\"to the end of time\\". On September 12, Rudolf finally issued a writ recognizing Michael and Nicolae as lifetime governors of Transylvania and as Princes of the other two countries.Rezachevici (2000), p. 11 Over those months, however, Michael had lost Transylvania to an insurgency headed by the Imperial warlord Giorgio Basta, and assisted by the Hungarian nobility; Moldavia was also reconquered by the Poles and the Movile»ôti (see Battle of MirƒÉslƒÉu, Moldavian Magnate Wars). He was forced back into Wallachia when the Poles began their march on Bucharest. Shortly before the battle of Bucov, he pledged to send Stanca and his children, including Nicolae, as hostages to Transylvania, hoping to secure a truce with Basta.Gane, p. 144; M√¢rza, pp. 75‚Äì76, 77‚Äì80; MihƒÉilescu, pp. 42‚Äì43 Michael obtained guarantees that his family would not be imprisoned by his enemies, the Transylvanian Saxons, but Basta denied his other requests, including that they would be dispatched to FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Citadel.M√¢rza, p. 78 =As hostage= Despite the pledge, Michael was also very unwilling to send his family abroad, and procrastinated to October 1600. Florica only arrived on December 30, and Teodora, also promised as a hostage, never left Wallachia.M√¢rza, pp. 79‚Äì80 Nicolae finally presented himself at L√©cfalva on October 16, accompanied by Archbishop Dionysus and Vistier Stoica Rio»ôeanu. All three pledged their loyalty to Rudolf and expressed criticism of Michael's policies.M√¢rza, p. 79 On October 17, Nicolae and his mother were honored guests at Corona, on their way to a gilded imprisonment in the castle of GilƒÉu (Gela).M√¢rza, pp. 79‚Äì80; MihƒÉilescu, pp. 42‚Äì43 In their dialogue with Michael, the Hungarians offered GilƒÉu as a permanent family demesne.M√¢rza, pp. 78, 80 After Bucov, Simion MovilƒÉ took over Nicolae's throne, in what was in practice an alternative dynastic union between Wallachia and Moldavia.Neagoe, p. 202 Michael remained an exile, seeking to renew his fealty toward the Habsburgs. He departed for Vienna, where he was to seek additional support from Rudolf and made peace with Basta. This interval presented an opportunity for the Hungarian nobles, who denounced Basta and took control over much of Transylvania. Nicolae and Stanca, now their prisoners, were removed from GilƒÉu and dispatched to the more secluded FƒÉgƒÉra»ô.M√¢rza, pp. 77, 80; MihƒÉilescu, p. 43 Some of Michael's supporters in Transylvania acknowledged in March 1601 that the family was healthy and satisfied, but a Mantuan report of April claimed otherwise.M√¢rza, p. 80 Stanca later complained to her mother-in-law that the entire family had been mistreated, and other records suggest that their mobile possession were arbitrarily confiscated.MihƒÉilescu, pp. 43‚Äì44 Michael tried to have them released into Rudolf's custody, and proposed that Nicolae become his ambassador in Prague.M√¢rza, p. 77 Despite his revival of the Holy League, Michael was having secret dealings with the Ottomans, to whom he sent a number of peace offerings in exchange for recognition as Prince. Again during the early months of 1601, he offered to send his son, \\"who is now kept under lock at FƒÉgƒÉra»ô\\", to Istanbul.M√¢rza, p. 76 The Ottomans demanded Nicolae from the Hungarian nobles, their nominal allies. The request was denied, because Nicolae's captors expected to hold him as a leverage against Michael, and also because of Stanca's passionate opposition to the plan.M√¢rza, p. 76 In August 1601, with Imperial backing, Michael was able to defeat the rebels at GuruslƒÉu. News of this pushed the Wallachian boyars into a successful anti-Movile»ôti rebellion, which technically restored Nicolae on the throne. They sent envoys to Michael's camp, who also reached FƒÉgƒÉra»ô on their way.MihƒÉilescu, p. 43 Michael's killing at C√¢mpia Turzii, in a 1694 illustration of the events Nicolae's fortunes were overturned within a month, following Michael's killing on Basta's orders, at C√¢mpia Turzii. Rumors of the period claimed that the two clashed over Michael's intent to divert his forces toward FƒÉgƒÉra»ô, in order to free Stanca and his children. Others even suggested that Basta framed Michael, first by agreeing to the offensive on FƒÉgƒÉra»ô, and then by withdrawing support and claiming that Michael was off to join the Ottomans.M√¢rza, p. 81 With Michael dead, Basta took control of the offensive into Transylvania, which eventually included the capture of FƒÉgƒÉra»ô. An avviso of October 6 claims that Basta's troops ran into Michael's family not at FƒÉgƒÉra»ô, but at Huszth, which indicates that they had been moved to Partium by the retreating Hungarians, probably through Moldavia.M√¢rza, p. 81 As reported by Gane, Stanca and Nicolae remained harshly critical of Michael in their interviews with Basta and David Ungnad, accepting that he may have been guilty of conspiracy against the Holy League.Gane, pp. 144, 210 Nicolae \\"cried and trembled, informing the German [Ungnad] that, whatever his father's fault, [...] he himself remained blameless and prostrated in front of the Emperor\\".Gane, p. 144 According to Iorga, the young heir, a \\"gentle creature\\", was \\"blessing his patron Basta, though the latter's hands were drenched in a blood that should have been dear to the princelet.\\"Iorga (1902), pp. VI‚ÄìVII Marcu Cercel also pledged his loyalties to the Empire. He followed Basta to FƒÉgƒÉra»ô, hoping to emerge as the Habsburg favorite for the Wallachian throne. A delegation of boyars supported him, while others noted that, at age eighteen, he was hardly competent; they preferred »òerban of Coiani for that position.RƒÉdulescu, p. 57 An avviso from May 1602 claims that Nicolae's candidacy was probably considered by a boyar faction, namely that supporting Wallachia's incorporation within the Empire.M√¢rza, p. 82 By then, Nicolae had been moved to FƒÉgƒÉra»ô, and was faced with Moldavian demands for his extradition. These were ignored by Basta, who instead asked the Hungarian nobles that they return Nicolae's stolen assets.Iorga (1934), p. 78 =In exile= A Cozia Monastery record details the meeting between Stanca and Teodora, who was by then a nun. According to Gane, this would suggest that Nicolae traveled back to Wallachia to meet his paternal grandmother,Gane, pp. 145‚Äì146, 211 while others indicate that he was forced to stay behind in Transylvania until the second half of 1602.M√¢rza, pp. 81‚Äì82; MihƒÉilescu, p. 43 In August, Nicolae addressed the Emperor a letter which reaffirmed his loyalty and asked to be received at the court in Prague, while also issuing a claim to Michael's confiscated assets.M√¢rza, pp. 80‚Äì81 On September 28, Nicolae was at »òcheii Bra»ôovului, where he donated various assets to St. Nicholas Church, in exchange for regular memorial services honoring his late father.M√¢rza, p. 81; MihƒÉilescu, p. 43 The Wallachian assets he bequeathed included the entire village of Mic»ôune»ôti.Donat, p. 229; MihƒÉilescu, p. 43 In December, Nicolae, Stanca and Florica had reached Vienna, and were asking for Rudolf's assistance.Iorga (1934), p. 79; M√¢rza, p. 82 Between 1602 and 1611, the Wallachian throne was held by »òerban of Coiani, who took the regnal name of Radu »òerban. By 1608, Nicolae had returned to Transylvania, hoping to seal an alliance with its Prince, Gabriel B√°thory, against their common Wallachian rival.Iorga (1902), pp. LXXIII‚ÄìLXXV According to Gane, Nicolae sketched an attempt to topple his rival, leading a \\"small army he had improvised\\". Radu »òerban captured him and cut off part of his nose, which technically invalidated Nicolae's candidacy.Gane, p. 211 Despite usurping Nicolae, he was a close follower of Michael's political line.Gane, pp. 201‚Äì209; Stoicescu, p. 94; Theodorescu, pp. 205, 207 Stanca returned to Wallachia with Florica, but died there in late 1603, a victim of the recurring plague.Gane, p. 145; Iona»ôcu, p. 166; MihƒÉilescu, p. 43 Balea of C√¢r»õocle»ôti assisted the family with various matters, including Stanca's funeral.Stoicescu, p. 31 Meanwhile, Nicolae obtained an imperial monthly pension worth 100 Goldgulden. He was also assigned to the retinue of Ferdinand Habsburg, the Archduke of Austria, which required his presence in Graz ca. 1603,M√¢rza, p. 82 and, on May 30, 1606, was made Cup-bearer (Mundschenk) of the Holy Roman Empire.Iorga (1934), pp. 79‚Äì80 Nevertheless, his funding was irregular, and overall viewed as insufficient by Nicolae and his retinue, who were increasingly dependent on pawnbrokers.Iorga (1934), pp. 78‚Äì80; MihƒÉilescu, pp. 43‚Äì46 The former Prince eventually settled in Tyrnau, to the west of Habsburg Hungary (in present-day Slovakia). From Tyrnau, he litigated over his father's remaining assets, which were still in the Empire's custody, and also demanded Kynsburg Castle, in Lower Silesia, which had been promised to Michael. In 1605, the Geheimrat recognized that Nicolae was owed 15,000 thaler from his father's possessions, but failed to enforce this ruling, leaving Nicolae to issue a formal protest to the Hungarian Diet of Pressburg.MihƒÉilescu, pp. 43‚Äì46. See also Iorga (1934), pp. 78‚Äì80 In 1606, the Aulic Council settled his outstanding debt of 20,000 thaler, but he continued to be pressed by his creditors; six years later, he resold to Emperor Rudolf his father's golden necklace.MihƒÉilescu, pp. 44‚Äì45, 46 He had earlier declared this artifact lost.Iorga (1934), p. 79 Meanwhile, the burghers of Tyrnau issued complaints against their guest, accusing his retinue of excessive luxury and resource depletion.MihƒÉilescu, p. 47 Hans von Aachen's allegory of the battle of Bra»ôov (1608), in which Radu »òerban and the Habsburg defeated the Principality of Transylvania and its Ottoman allies In 1610, Radu »òerban recognized Nicolae as a Postelnic. In this interval, Nicolae exchanged deeds over his father's village of Ciulni»õa with Logothete Oancea, receiving instead Glina, though he never took possession of the latter.Donat, pp. 220, 225 In July 1611, he fought alongside the Wallachian Prince as he defeated B√°thory in Burzenland.Iorga (1902), p. CIV Later that year, Radu »òerban was chased out of Bucharest by another Ottoman invasion, and replaced with Radu Mihnea. An 18th-century compilation by Franjo Ksaver Pejaƒçeviƒá suggests that both Princes escaped Wallachia together, heading for Vienna.Damaschin Mioc, \\"»òtiri de istorie a rom√¢nilor √Æn Letopise»õul Brancovicesc\\", in Studii »ôi Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. IX, 1978, pp. 136, 141 Eventually, Radu »òerban also settled at Tyrnau.Gane, p. 211; MihƒÉilescu, pp. 47‚Äì48 From there, he began plotting Radu Mihnea's downfall, profiting from the Ottomans' focus on a parallel war in Persia. The expedition, finally started in 1616, was blocked by the hostile Transylvanian regime of Gabriel Bethlen, who joined with Iskender Pasha and defeated the Wallachian returnees in Moldavia.Iorga (1902), pp. CXXVI‚ÄìCXXXVI; MihƒÉilescu, pp. 47‚Äì48 »òerban's effort was also assisted by Moldavia's Princess Elisabeta, on behalf of the Movile»ôti. This final reconciliation ended badly for the Moldavians, as Elisabeta and her son Alexandru were dethroned and imprisoned by the Ottomans. Nicolae remained close to Gabriel MovilƒÉ, who became Prince of Wallachia in June 1618.Gane, pp. 179‚Äì181, 183; MihƒÉilescu, p. 48 During that episode, Nicolae and Marcu Cercel again found themselves on opposite sides: frustrated in his attempts to obtain a Wallachian or Moldavian crown, Marcu had turned against his Habsburg backers. In his final years, he was one of Bethlen's trusted supporters.Iorga (1902), pp. CXXXI, CXXXIII‚ÄìCXXXIV, CXXXLX, CXL; RƒÉdulescu, pp. 57‚Äì61 =Final years= Nicolae ultimately married Radu »òerban's daughter, known as Ana or Ancu»õa, on July 10, 1618.MihƒÉilescu, pp. 43, 47, 48.

CXXXIII; Neagoe, p. 196; Stoicescu, pp. 94, 206; Theodorescu, p. 205 The wedding was blessed by a new Emperor, Matthias, who presented the couple with a silver chalice.MihƒÉilescu, p. 48 The scandal over Michael's inheritance peaked the same year, when Matthias ordered an Hofkriegsrat investigation into Michael's killing. The news were poorly received by Nicolae, who complained that the inquiry would open the record to \\"calumnies\\" against his father and cement Basta's depiction of the Prince as a \\"traitor\\".MihƒÉilescu, pp. 46‚Äì47 The issue was put on hold by the accession of Archduke Ferdinand to the imperial throne, an event which also sparked the Thirty Years' War. In 1619, Bethlen, joining the anti-Habsburg coalition, attacked Ferdinand's possessions in Hungary. Nicolae, Ana, and Radu »òerban fled Tyrnau ahead of a siege, moving to Modern, then to Eisenstadt.MihƒÉilescu, p. 48 During that interval, both former Princes became involved in the project to assist the Maniot revolt in Ottoman Greece, with the Duke of Nevers asking them to support his \\"Christian Militia\\", which also fought against Bethlen. Although criticized as Orthodox \\"Schismatics\\", they were eventually accepted as allies, alongside the ephemeral Catholic Prince of Moldavia, Gaspar Graziani.G√∂llner, pp. 76‚Äì80; Theodorescu, pp. 205‚Äì207 In November 1619, Nicolae and Graziani assisted George Druget's attack on Bethlen's Transylvania, also transferring exorbitant sums to Sigismund Vasa in exchange for his Lisowczycy (see Battle of Humenn√©).G√∂llner, pp. 80‚Äì81 Nicolae became Druget's favorite for the Wallachian crown, his father-in-law having since retired from the race.Iorga (1902), pp. CXXXLX‚ÄìCXL Eventually, Nicolae and Radu »òerban became aware that Graziani wanted the crown of Wallachia for himself, and were resentful, taking their distance from the Militia.G√∂llner, p. 82 In February 1620, after having moved to Vienna, Nicolae lost his father- in-law to gout,MihƒÉilescu, p. 48 and inherited from him the assets of the Coiani boyars.Gane, p. 211 By then, Nicolae was again emerging as Ferdinand's favorite: the Empire would not assign him more money, but Michael's inheritance was paid up in land, houses, and salt.MihƒÉilescu, p. 48 Following the Habsburg‚ÄìTransylvanian rapprochement, he began writing of his plan to regain Bucharest with Bethlen's help.MihƒÉilescu, p. 49 Nevertheless, he himself was immobilized by gout, turning his attention to less material pursuits, in particular reading. By 1626, attempting to alleviate his symptoms, he sought specialized care in Vienna. In his correspondence with Sebastian Tengnagel, he asked to receive books of grammar and theology from the Hof-Bibliothek, noting that he had \\"no other pleasure left\\".MihƒÉilescu, p. 49 He complained to Ferdinand's court of his insolvency, receiving backing from the Count Esterh√°zy.MihƒÉilescu, p. 49 Nicolae died of gout in 1627, either somewhere \\"in Austria\\"Gane, p. 212 or at Pressburg.Cazacu, p. 179 As noted by »òtefan MihƒÉilescu, his date of death was between June 19 and September 7. According to the same author, he was probably aged 40 or 41.MihƒÉilescu, p. 49 The body was assigned for burial to the Orthodox church of Raab. Ana survived on a 50-Goldgulden pension, also finding employment as a seamstress; Ferdinand refused to let her return home.Gane, p. 212 By 1635, she was able to pay off her debt to the citizens of Tyrnau, but protested that they would not return her collateral.Slavici, p. 386 She also took up her husband's inheritance claim, and, as early as 1627, complained to Ferdinand that Count Esterh√°zy, as Palatine of Hungary, was blocking her litigation. The Emperor intervened and ordered the procedures to be carried out with some expediency.Slavici, pp. 385‚Äì386 Parts of Michael the Brave's estate were also being requested by some of the prominent Hungarian families, including B√°nffy, H√©derv√°ry, and Esterh√°zy.Slavici, p. 386 Legacy Elias Wiedemann's engraving of Michael Vaivoda, which may depict Mihai PƒÉtra»ôcu Nicolae's remains were finally exhumed by Ana in 1640, and taken to Wallachia together with Radu »òerban's (recovered from St. Stephen's Cathedral).Gane, pp. 211‚Äì213; MihƒÉilescu, pp. 48, 49. See also Theodorescu, pp. 206‚Äì207 The reigning Prince Matei Basarab welcomed them in Bucharest, then buried them together in the shared necropolis of Comana Monastery. The epitaph, which probably dates from the late 18th century, commemorates both as heroes of the defense against Islam and \\"the Hungarian heretic\\".Theodorescu, p. 207. See also MihƒÉilescu, p. 50 Unusually, Nicolae and his family were regularly commemorated by a Moldavian church at Golia Monastery.Grigora»ô, p. 10 Their likeness remains preserved at CƒÉluiu Monastery, in Oboga, which Michael furbished in 1593‚Äì1594. His heir is shown alongside his mother on the CƒÉluiu naos, painted by a Master Mina.Rezachevici (1976), pp. 1990, 1991 MihƒÉilescu, who also writes that Prince Nicolae was a Wallachian version of Napoleon II, laments that his fate was otherwise \\"nearly entirely forgotten.\\"MihƒÉilescu, p. 41 The marriage of Nicolae and Ana produced two sons, Gavril and Mihai PƒÉtra»ôcu, and a daughter, Ilinca (Elena). Gavril died in 1622, an infant or young child.Gane, p. 212 Nicolae's daughter stayed with her mother in Austria until 1640. Both returned to settle in Filipe»ôtii de T√¢rg, alongside the Cantacuzinos, before recovering their family estates.Gane, pp. 212‚Äì213, 239 They could resume ownership of B√¢rca and Mirce»ôti-Simileasca, but not of their serfs, who were recognized as manumitted by Prince Matei.Donat, pp. 217, 229‚Äì230 Florica had died shortly after her brother, in or around 1629, while Marula was still alive in 1647.M√¢rza, p. 74 Mihai, who was also recognized as a Cup-bearer, stated a claim to his share of the Coiani inheritance, demanding in particular 4,000 Goldgulden pledged by the Empire to his maternal grandmother, Elena »òerban.Slavici, p. 386 He was still attached to Vienna, with Ferdinand III forcefully keeping him on his entourage and considering him for the throne of Transylvania.Gane, pp. 213, 239; Slavici, pp. 387‚Äì390 In 1643, he was trying to instigate a pro-Habsburg rebellion among the Romanians of Transylvania.Iorga (1902), p. CCIX This prevented Prince Matei, whose sons Matei II and Mateia»ô had both died, from adopting Michael the Great's grandson.Gane, pp. 238‚Äì240; Iona»ôcu, p. 13; Iorga (1902), pp. CXIX, CCLIV; Slavici, pp. 386‚Äì387 In 1654, formally released from Austrian service, Mihai made a final effort to regain Wallachia, counting on assistance from the Cossack rebels. He fell ill with the plague upon reaching Bohdan Khmelnytsky's court in Chyhyryn, and was recorded as dead by 1656.Slavici, pp. 388‚Äì390 One tradition suggests that he was the suitor for Domni»õa Ruxandra, daughter of Moldavian Prince Vasile Lupu and widow of Tymofiy Khmelnytsky.Gane, p. 301 Some scholars also argue that he is the Michael Vaivoda depicted in a 1651 engraving by Elias Wiedemann.Theodorescu, pp. 168‚Äì169 By then, Ilinca had married Postelnic Istratie Leurdeanu. He was Fiera Leurdeanu's grandson, and son of the Logothete Stroe Leurdeanu. After his failure with Mihai PƒÉtra»ôcu, Prince Matei hoped to adopt Istratie, but met opposition from the other boyars, and was ultimately discarded in favor of Diicul Buicescul.Gane, p. 240 Both Istratie and Stroe rose to prominence later in the 1650s, under the rule of Radu »òerban's natural son, Constantin »òerban, and then became noted as enemies of the Cantacuzinos.Gane, pp. 213, 331‚Äì348; Iona»ôcu, pp. 18, 51; Stoicescu, pp. 181, 203‚Äì206 Ilinca was still mentioned in 1656, and died childless some time after; Istratie was executed in December 1658 by a new Prince, Mihnea III.Stoicescu, pp. 206‚Äì207 His father survived him by twenty years. Tried for his role in the unlawful execution of Constantin I Cantacuzino (Nicolae's alleged cousin), he was pardoned and sent to a monastery, ending his life as Silvestru the Monk.Gane, pp. 344‚Äì345; Stoicescu, pp. 204‚Äì205 Arms Like all Wallachian Princes of the period, Nicolae used as his primary symbol the Wallachian bird, which was by then a cross between golden eagle and raven. As noted by heraldist Dan Cernovodeanu, this \\"hybrid\\" was represented with \\"very elegant\\" form under Nicolae's alleged grandfather, PƒÉtra»ôcu the Good.Cernovodeanu, p. 45 A 1616 roll of arms, created by Valentin Franck, puts Nicolae's arms alongside those of his father-in-law, showing them to be nearly identical: they both have oval shields supported by lions affront√©s, and \\"hybrid\\" birds displayed.Cernovodeanu, pp. 46, 218‚Äì219 In Franck's version, Nicolae's arms feature the bird over a cross potent, and holding a ring in its beak, while Radu »òerban's has a closed beak and no cross. Cernovodeanu proposes that this heraldic distinction highlighted the difference of weight in dynastic claims: Nicolae saw himself as descending from the original House of Basarab, whereas his ally was only related to the Craiove»ôti.Cernovodeanu, p. 46 However, all seals used by Nicolae, Radu »òerban and Mihai PƒÉtra»ôcu feature the same display, including lions in supporters and the cross (either behind the bird or in its beak), but without a ring.Cernovodeanu, pp. 46‚Äì47, 220‚Äì223 Michael the Brave and Nicolae are both associated with another seal, first used on July 27, 1600. Its complex field has the Wallachian bird alongside the Moldavian aurochs, two lions affront√©s, and a variant of the nova plantatio theme, with both Princes in supporters. An enduring controversy surrounds the two lions, opposing historians who view them as a variant coat of arms of Transylvania to those who read them as Michael's personal arms; secondary debates range over whether they are shown holding up a sword or rather the trunk of a tree.Cernovodeanu, pp. 69‚Äì73. See also Grigora»ô, p. 9 Among the specialists involved, archivist Aurelian Sacerdo»õeanu proposed that the seal was designed by Nicolae in a bid to cement his claim as Michael's successor on the Moldavian throne.Cernovodeanu, pp. 70‚Äì71.

Helmet of eight plates in the Korean style (Chinese: ') is a helmet produced between 14th and 16th centuries in either Korean peninsula or Mongolia.This eight plated helmets may have come from Mongolian region. But the current theory is that they were originated in North Korean regions. This helmet consists of eight plates made of iron. It is speculated that this helmet style was spread to Korean peninsula from theTibetan regions. Helmets with similar structure can be seen in Tibet, while both versions of the helmet are made of iron and leather. But Korean-style eight plated helmets are distinguished from those of Tibetan style by its relatively smaller size. Usually a Tibetan-style eight plated helmet measures 21‚Äì22 cm in height. But this Korean style helmet measures only 13 cm in height. Currently displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the Korean style helmet measures 24.3 cm in length and 21 cm in width and 1065.9 g in weight.  Description  This kind of helmets called Ba Ban has historically originated in the 8th century AD. It spanned from 8th century to the 16th century AD. Originally it was seen in Tibetan region. The reason why it is called the \\"Helmet of eight plates\\", because it consists of eight plates made of iron and leather. Surprisingly, many well-preserved eight plated helmets in the Tibetan style can be observed at several Tibetan monasteries‚Äô The Tibetan style helmets are similar to Korean helmets in structure. But Tibetan ones are quite larger than that of Korean. Usually, a Tibetan style helmet measures 21‚Äì22 cm in height and the Korean example at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York measures only 13 cm in height. Since, no enough evidence has been found from the research process, it is controversial whether a chin trap with the helmet was used or not.

The focus of the third stanza is the unity of all who participate in the Eucharist, unity with Jesus and among each other. The fourth stanza compares the unity of those gathering with the one bread from many grain kernels. The fifth stanza prays for unity in faith and love, compared to the berries of one grape. The final stanza requests the church to be protected from evil, and the congregation to be sent as witnesses of God's love, to be completed.

F. Mathews. It stars Vinayakan, Chemban Vinod Jose, Pauly Valsan, Bitto Davis, Kainakary Thangaraj, Dileesh Pothan and Arya Salim in the main roles. The film had its premiere on 30 November 2017 and was theatrically released on 4 May 2018. The film revolves around the death and funeral of an older man from the Roman Catholic community in Chellanam, Ernakulam district. Lijo Jose Pellissery won the Best Director Award at the 48th Kerala State Film Awards for Ee.Ma.Yau. The film won the Best Director and Best Actor (Chemban Vinod Jose) awards at the 49th International Film Festival of India. It also won two awards at the International Film Festival of Kerala viz. the NETPAC Award for Best Asian film in Competition and the Golden Crow Pheasant Award for the best director.  Plot  Set in Chellanam, a coastal village with significant fishermen population in Eranakulam, the film revolves around the death of Vavachan mestri. After returning from a long journey, Vavachan gets into a fight with Chowro after Chowro informs and shames Vavachan regarding a premarital relationship between his daughter Nissa and Sivanapan. Somewhere in the beach, in a shack, two people are playing a game of cards, lamenting over how the game will get interesting now. On arriving home, his wife Pennamma asks him to stop going around and to settle. When his son Eeshi returns home, Vavachan drinks and tells him that Vavachan's father had the most splendid funeral in all of Chellanam. Eeshi promises that Vavachan will also have a big grand funeral. After some time, Vavachan falls to the ground and dies. Eeshi's wife Sabeth informs neighbors about the death. Ayappan, the Panchayath ward member and Eeshi's friend arrives at the scene and takes control. Ayyappan asks Paanji and Lasar, two neighbours of Eeshi, to bring Dr. Gervasius to confirm the death. But Gervasius's wife tells them that he is drunk and asleep and they have to go to a head nurse living nearby to confirm the death. Arriving at the scene and seeing the injury in head, nurse tells them that she cannot do anything and only a doctor can confirm. Fr. Zacharia Parapurath, a rude vicar of the parish and a crime novel enthusiast hears about the head injury and informs the police. The next day, another wife of Vavachan arrives with her son and family and claims rights for the body. This leads to a clash between two wives and the families. The family of the second wife alleges that Eeshi and family murdered Vavachan and they want justice. Fr. Zacharia, who is interested in finding mishap surrounding the death, tells Eeshi that he won't allow burial of Vavachan unless there is a proper investigation and autopsy. On hearing this unintelligent requirement from the vicar, a furious Eeshi slaps Fr. Zacharia, and Fr. Zacharia out of vengeance and shame declares that he will not conduct or allow the burial in church cemetery. The gravedigger, who was digging the grave for Vavachan dies suddenly and his burial takes place in the same grave he dug for Vavachan. The two guys earlier shown to be playing cards, are still playing in the morning also and discuss that how the situation has become complicated and that now things will fall in place.Ayyappan goes to police station to seek the help of circle inspector to clear the clouds. Inspector comes to Eeshi's house and tells that there is no crime element in the death and concurs with Dr. Gervasius's opinion. They lament Fr. Zacharia's attitude to matters of humanity. Since there is no positive confirmation from the Vicar about the burial, the morning rain, and all the problems that is going on Eeshi decides to take matters into his own hands. Eeshi digs a grave in his courtyard and forcefully makes everyone move- out from the courtyard, locks his family inside home. Finally asks his father's forgiveness for not fulfilling his wishes and buries him. Everyone who came for the funeral stands in the rain and looks at him with remorse and reverence. In the mid-credits scene, we see the corpse of the dog that would accompany the grave-digger everywhere. And in the far away horizon of the sea we see two boats with lit lanterns and people dressed in cloaks, approaching the beach. It's revealed that the two men playing cards from the beginning of the movie, were in fact Angels who had come over to the beach to carry forward the souls of Vavachan, the gravedigger and the dog to their respective destinations; Hell and Heaven.

Life and career Taki graduated with a degree in art history from Tokyo University. Taki began his professional career as a core figure at the Japanese photography magazine Provoke, which he co-founded and where he worked from 1968 to 1970. He also provided most of the funds for the magazine. However, because of his \\"aloofness\\" and greater focus on writing, he was best known as a critical writer rather than a visual artist. Next to art, he also wrote frequently on philosophy, politics and history. = PROVOKE = The magazine was founded by Koji Taki and poet Takahiko Okada, and photographers Takuma Nakahira and Yutaka Takanashi, as an attempt to fill the gap between politics and art, and as a result of frustration at the post-war world. Published between 1968 and 1969, only about 1000 copies were originally printed, although various reprints are available today. The images in the magazine pioneered a new grainy or blurry style that contrasted with the Japanese aesthetic at the time and the magazine was strongly criticised.

The church forms part of the Diocese of Sydney. It was designed by Reverend Thomas Makinson, first incumbent priest and James Chadley and built from 1836 to 1838 by James Atkinson and William Chisholm (Atkinson also carved the pinnacled reredos himself). It is also known as St. Thomas Anglican Church and St Thomas Church of England. The property is owned by Anglican Church Property Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. St Thomas' Church is located on land granted to the Anglican Church in 1831 by pioneer, William Cox. The church contains a mechanical organ that was built in 1868 by J. W. Walker of London, with a manual compass of 56 notes, a hitch-down Swell pedal, with 159 pipes.  History  Between 1809- early land grants were made in the valley to the notable Cox family and were noted for pastoral use, vineyards and orcharding. The Mulgoa Valley was renowned at one time as one of NSW's richest farming districts. The Cox family were influential in the district and state. They suffered the financial depression of the 1840s but eventually their pastoral interests took them further afield, relocating west of the Blue Mountains. They left behind four buildings - Glenmore, Fernhill, The Cottage and St. Thomas's Church - reflecting the early pioneering phase, their era of prosperity and their social and religious aspirations. The site was originally granted to the Anglican Church in 1831 by William Cox to be used as a church and school.Ingham Planning, 2007, 2 St. Thomas' church was built by James Atkinson & William Chisholm in 1836-8 and designed by the Rev. Thomas Makinson, first incumbent, and James Chadley. Makinson carved the pinnacled reredos himself. The site has a picturesque graveyard of clustered headstones and notable classical sandstone monuments, predominantly of the pastoralist Cox family, on a sloping site bordered with regenerating eucalypts, which complements the church. 1987 Sydney REP 13 (Mulgoa Valley) was gazetted, reflecting increasing conservation interest in this important early farming valley, valued for its scenic value, ongoing agriculture, \\"lifestyle\\" living and heritage values. St. Thomas' Church and cemetery is a key part of this valley and an identified heritage item in the SREP. The Anglican parish at Mulgoa still meet in St. Thomas' Church.  Description  This is a hillside site north of Mulgoa township in a semi-rural area sloping south and east, facing St. Thomas's Road, bordered with regrowth eucalypt seedlings. On the opposite side of St. Thomas' Road is the Mulgoa Pre-School and Day Care centre and Mulgoa Park (comprising oval, hall and tennis courts) between St. Thomas' & Littlefield Roads. To the south-east are Kings Hill Road & Farm Road which have a number of small rural land holdings characterising development in the township's surrounds. The church and hall which are on the northern part of the site have a picturesque graveyard of clustered headstones and notable classical sandstone monuments, predominantly of the pastoralist Cox family (who donated the land and owned (along with other lands such as Winbourne to the south) the two immediately adjacent estates, Fernhill & The Cottage/Cox's Cottage. An existing driveway to the church is at the north-eastern end of the site. The balance of the site includes open grass paddocks, 2 small dams, fences, areas of disturbed, regenerating native vegetation and areas of bushland predominantly along the eastern part of the site and fringing Mulgoa and St. Thomas' Roads, providing a vegetated screen to the majority of the site. South of the church and almost centrally to the land are the ruins of the former rectory, burnt in the 2003 bush fires. The site is a sloping hillside site, bordered with regrowth eucalypt seedlings. The church has a picturesque graveyard of clustered headstones and notable classical sandstone monuments, predominantly of the pastoralist Cox family. The church is a sandstone Gothic revival style building, with Georgian proportions but early Victorian Gothic Revival details and the first open timber hammer beam roof in the colony. = Condition = As at 12 May 2004, the only reasonably intact late 1830s Gothic Revival rural Anglican parish church in NSW. Superb landscape setting and aesthetic value as an ensemble. St. Thomas' Road, , is an original country road with branches leading to many properties and buildings from earliest times; * site of colonial parsonage and drive, - earth ledge and old bricks, remnant garden planting located immediately behind back fence of new rectory of St. Thomas' Church. Distinct impression of road with remains of gate posts and side fences and possibly picket gate (S.6.5.4, Mulgoa, of appendix D, Historical Archaeological Component by Wendy Thorp, 8/1986 in Fox & Associates, Heritage Study of the City of Penrith, Volume 2 - appendices). There are three areas of archaeological interest. The church site is of early colonial interest with the ancestry of the Cox family displayed in the churchyard. It is also of Aboriginal archaeological interest as a camping area overlooking the junction of the 2 streams (see Austral Archaeology report). On the southern portion of the site the archaeological remains of the original rectory are buried and will also require protection. The location of the original rectory building has been established on the ridge south of the church (refer to A121/1 and the 1947 aerial photo where it was still standing). The design of the development will protect this area while allowing for future archaeological investigation of the site as a possible educational tool. As defined in the archaeological report, the area of major archaeological importance is located within the church site in which minimal disturbance is taking place. The area south of the church where the school is proposed is defined as of lesser historic and archaeological significance. However the recommendations of the report will be followed during excavation and investigation of the site.Ingham Planning, 2007, Appx.C, 3 = Modifications and dates = The parsonage () was demolished ; and the current parsonage is .  Heritage listing  As at 12 May 2004, St. Thomas' is the only extant example of a reasonably intact, late 1830s Gothic Revival, rural Anglican parish church in New South Wales. Its cemetery contains some important early monuments, dating from 1839 and the graves of members of prominent local families.Fox and Associates 1987: MV-3 The golden stone church, with attendant cemetery and gravestones, has a considerable aesthetic impact when glimpsed from Mulgoa Road (now St. Thomas' Road). The picturesque graveyard of clustered headstones and notable classical sandstone monuments, predominantly of the Cox family, is on a sloping site alongside, bordered with eucalpyt saplings, and complements the church admirably. It remains one of the most romantic rural church settings in New South Wales, and has significance both for its superb landscape value and its relative intactness.Proudfoot, 1987, modified Read, S., 2004 The hammer beam roof was the first example of a medieval style open timber roof in a NSW Church and the building as a whole is only existing example of a reasonably intact late 1830s Gothic Revival rural Anglican parish Church in the State.

He was also a nephew of Geoffrey of Villehardouin, a crusader leader and chronicler.Chenaye-Desbois, p. 111 Thierry, with the other participants of the Fourth Crusade, which had been diverted from the Holy Land, took part in the Siege of Constantinople in 1203 and the sacking of the same city a year later. In 1204 he led the troops of the Latin Empire that captured the blind ex-emperor of Byzantium, Alexios V Doukas. The captured Alexios was taken to Constantinople by Thierry, where he was tried for treason and the murder of Alexios IV Angelos and executed. At some time after 1204 Thierry was appointed 'Seneschal of Romania' (Romania being the Latin Empire).Choniates, p. 334Hendrickx and Matzukis, pp. 127-131 Thierry was a prominent Latin commander at the Battle of Rusion in 1206, where his army was defeated by the Bulgarians.

Also in 1206, Thierry de Loos was invested by the Latin government with the city and region of Nicomedia as a fief, with the title duke. He occupied the city and fortified its cathedral of the Divine Wisdom. Thierry was captured outside Nicomedia by the Nicaean Emperor Theodore Laskaris, but was soon released following a negotiated truce.

It was designed by Mortimer Lewis (east section) and Oswald H. Lewis (west section) and built during 1853. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 and on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/121  History  =Colonial history= One of the earliest land grants in the Randwick area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received 12 acres bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841 as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen, 1988. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital. =Nugal Hall= The land on which Nugal Hall was built was originally part of a land grant to Alexander McArthur, in 1851 by Governor Fitzroy, of .NSW Planning and Environment Commission. The land granted McArthur extended from Judge Street to Belmore Road, from Alison Road to Mear's Avenue. Milford Street was not in existence until the 1850s. The driveway to Nugal Hall swept back from Avoca Street (then called Frenchman's Road) around the north side (now the back of Nugal Hall) to the coach house and stables (in what is now Milford Street). The east end of Nugal Hall was the original front entrance.National Trust of Australia. Nugal Hall was designed by the Colonial Architect, Mortimer Lewis who came to Australia and worked from 1830 to 1861. This would have been one of his last buildings. Earlier Lewis was responsible for designing Randwick Racecourse, Darlinghurst Courthouse and Bronte House. Ticket of leave men were most probably employed in the building of the house, the stone being quarried on the spot. The southern portion of the house was completed in 1853 to Lewis' design in (mainly) the late Gothic Revival style, for politician and businessman Alexander McArthur. McArthur arrived in Sydney in 1840 from Derry, Ireland, with his brother Sir William McArthur KCMG. He was a businessman, merchant, and shipping magnate, and Member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales during two Parliaments and Magistrate of the Territory until he returned to England in 1863. It is believed construction of the southern portion of Nugal Hall was commenced around 1854 by Judge Thomas Callaghan. Famous residents of Nugal Hall include barrister and Cobargo farmer, Sir John Peden who was born there. His father Magnus J. Peden was Mayor in 1869 and resided there from 1865 to 1872. Sir John Beverley Peden (1871-1946), barrister and professor of law, was born on 26 April 1871, second son and sixth child of Magnus Jackson Peden, merchant and farmer, and mayor of Randwick and of Bega, and his wife Elizabeth Neathway, n√©e Brown. In 1902 John Peden was appointed part-time Challis lecturer in the law of property at Sydney University. He practised law until he succeeded Pitt Cobbett as Challis Professor of law and Dean of the Faculty in 1910. Under Peden the law school grew steadily in reputation and influence. He was President of the Sydney University Law Society, examiner for the Barristers' Admission Board and ex officio chairman of the Solicitors' Admission Board. Although Peden, who took silk in December 1922, would have made a distinguished judge, he always declined offers. An executive-member of the Universal Service League in 1915-16, he favoured conscription for military service overseas. In May 1917 he was nominated to the Legislative Council.Ward, John M., 1988 A painstaking legislator and an authority on parliamentary forms, Sir John Peder showed lively interest in such subjects as living wages, industrial arbitration, matrimonial relations, capital punishment and workers' compensation. He eventually considered that his most important contributions as a legislator had been his defence of free speech that led to the sedition bill being dropped during World War I and his modification of the (ne temere) Marriage Amendment Act of 1924. In 1921-31 Peden served as sole royal commissioner on law reform in New South Wales. In 1930 he was appointed K.C.M.G. The northern section of the house was built between 1880 and 1903, and most likely in the 1880s. The design elements from this phase include the curved bay window with balcony over and conical roof, facing the ocean. While responding to the Gothic Picturesque style of the southern section of the house, and built of similar sandstone, this section incorporated stylistic elements of the Arts & Crafts and Federation eras. These include the circular tower on the eastern end with the candle-snoff roof, the timber balcony detailing, shingled balcony skirt and rounded form of the bay window.Daniell, 2013, 8 The northern section was completed by Dr Fred Tidswell, the owner of the Coogee Bay Hotel, whose family occupied the house from about 1883 until 1903. The architect is thought to have been Oswald H. Lewis, who carried out work for the Callaghan family in Randwick and who practised as an architect with his father, former Colonial Architect, Mortimer Lewis. Cousins Spencer, the first person to show films in the Lyceum Theatre lived there in 1911. Two Mayors of Randwick and two diplomatic consuls were also residents of Nugal Hall. In 1918, Nugal Hall became a Red Cross hospital/convalescent home for Australian military personnel returning from World War I. The house returned to private ownership in 1921. Additions to the house are cited as occurring in the 1920s and 1930s. These include the additions to its western side under a sloping skillion roof. Documentary evidence indicates the additions were built prior to the aerial photograph of 1943. These additions include that made on the western side of the house.Daniell, 2013, 6 The property was eventually purchased in 1952 (1953 say the Randwick Historical Society, 26/9/1981) by Mr J R Pillars, the owner of a successful engineering firm. In 1957, his wife Mrs Nell Pillars founded the Randwick Historical Society in 1957 while living at Nugal Hall and as such it became the Society's first headquarters during her lifetime. Mr. F. J. Campion acquired Nugal Hall in 1978. In 1981 an application for a Permanent Conservation Order over Nugal Hall was made by the owner. When Mr Campion purchased Nugal Hall it was divided into 5 flats and he subsequently returned it to a single dwelling. To offset restoration costs rating and taxation concessions were sought under the Heritage Act.< In 1994 house, balcony, shutters, windows and roof were severely damaged by a heavy hailstorm. Nugal Hall was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.Randwick & District Historical Society, 1981. Further damage to the property was done by heavy rain and more hail in November‚ÄìDecember 2001. The current grounds of Nugal Hall have been subdivided from their original . As a result of the reduction of the curtilage the entry is now from the rear side rather than from the original front entry. The original front entry faces the ocean and is located on the eastern end of the house.Daniell, 2013  Description  =Grounds, setting and views= The house sits well in its grounds and is visually important locally.AHC, 1997 Although its grounds have been subdivided from their original , resulting in the house's entry being now from its original rear side, the house's original front address facing the ocean and wide views remain nonetheless. Nugal Hall has an established garden surrounds the house which includes palms such as a line of Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) along the Milford Street frontage, a Californian desert fan palm (Washingtonia robusta) as well as pollarded plane tree (Platanus x acerifolia), sandstone retaining walls and shrubberiesincluding Hydrangea macrophylla.Read, Stuart. 20 January 2012, updated 22 June 2012. Progressive subdivision of the original Nugal Hall estate has seen its boundaries redefined and original setting compromised. Increasingly dense residential development has been built up to the eastern boundary, obstructing a large component of the original ground floor terrace and garden views to the east. Development to the east also poses a significant obstruction of views to Nugal Hall, most significantly from the eastern approach to the building on Milford Street. Regardless, views to Nugal Hall are still achieved and the building retains expansive district, ocean and iconic views from most east facing internal and external living areas. In the existing situation, Nugal Hall achieves iconic views to Wedding Cake Island and the Coogee land-sea interface, from a ground floor terrace and gardens, ancillary to the east- facing ballroom. On either side of Nugal Hall's original main entrance are a ball room and a dining room. An entrance porch and terrace is accessed by french doors from the ball room. The dining room to the north of the entrance has views across the Coogee basin and Coogee Bay, partially obscured by a tree on a neighbouring property. Earlier views of the southern headland of Coogee Bay have been reduced by construction of the three storey building at 20 Milford Street. The ball room and terrace to the south of the entrance has views across the Coogee basin and Wedding Cake Island. Close up views towards Nugal Hall from the opposite side of Milford Street are largely screened by its elevation above the street, the generous front setback, the heavily planted front garden, and by the adjacent three storey building. \\"Nugal Hall\\" also has some visibility from the surrounding area, (particularly with night time floodlights) for example from St. Brigid's Church in Brook Street, Coogee and from the Carrington Road/Coogee Bay Road corner, but is not prominent from these distant locations. Any earlier landmark status of the building has been considerably diminished by the volume and scale of surrounding development, including the Sacred Heart Church and the residential flat building at 12 Milford Street. =House (16-18 Milford Street)= Very fine impressive example of Picturesque Gothic Revival sandstone, two storey mansion completed in 1853. Has some outstanding decoration and its magnificent upper floor rounded Juliet balcony has views to Coogee Basin and out to sea.Randwick Heritage Study (RHSI), inventory sheet. Despite some 1920s and 1930s decorative additions, the twelve principal rooms retain their original forms. Of special interest is a stairwell/staircase of balanced proportion, above which is an exceptional stained glass skylight. Stonework, joinery, copper turrets and domes in good repair. Elegantly shaped windows, fireplaces and interior columns of marble.Pollen, 1996. Ceiling rose, fireplaces, continental ceramic tileware immaculate. Although not of the very high quality of a few Sydney Gothic Revival houses, Nugal Hall is nevertheless impressive. It is of particular importance in Coogee/Randwick where increasing high rise development has deprived the area of much of its architectural history. On the western side of Nugal Hall is a single storey skillion-roofed addition with brick walls. The western side additions have been cited as dating to the 1920s and 1930s. The physical evidence indicates that the rooms on the southern side of this addition are earlier than the covered northern section of the addition. This addition has no architectural merit and does not contribute to the architectural character of the house.Daniell, 2013, 11 =Carriage or Coach House (14 Milford Street - adjacent to, all included in same Lot & DP)= Other buildings on site include the former (plastered) carriage house located on Milford Street adjacent to the entrance. The coach house building at the front was originally a lodge for horse-drawn vehicles. The interiors have been adapted to a residence.

Heritage listing  As at 30 July 2014, Nugal Hall is of State significance as an example of an impressive two storey mansion constructed of stone in the Gothic Revival style. Designed by the Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis it was constructed in 1853. The land was a grant to Alexander Arthur, in 1851 by Governor Fitzroy, of .

She spent most of the period of 1913‚Äì35 in British Malaya, and for her contributions to colonial healthcare she was posthumously inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame. She served in a medical capacity in both world wars, and was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal in 1935. Early life and career Sarah O'Flynn was born in 1886 in Sixmilebridge, County Clare, to James O'Flynn, a wool miller, and his second wife, Margaret (n√©e O'Halloran). She attended convent schools in Ireland and France and graduated MB ChB from the University of Edinburgh in 1912. She was subsequently appointed an assistant in obstetrics at the Royal Free Hospital in London. During this period, she was also active in the campaign for women's suffrage; she once spent a week on a hunger strike at HM Prison Holloway after attempting to storm parliament with a group of protesters. O'Flynn was given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. Career in Malaya In 1913, after attending a course on tropical diseases at the London School of Tropical Medicine, O'Flynn joined the Colonial Medical Service and was sent to British Malaya. There, she ran the women's and children's ward at Kuala Lumpur Hospital and established a new hospital for women and children in the Kuala Pilah District. While the hospital was under construction, she travelled across the countryside by elephant and bicycle to deliver care; these home visits helped to increase trust in Western medicine among the rural population. O'Flynn returned to Britain in 1916 to join the Royal Army Medical Corps. She served in Malta, Thessaloniki, and Fort Pitt in Kent, and after the war's end in 1919 she accompanied Lady Muriel Paget on a humanitarian mission to Russia. She then returned to Malaya, and married Richard Olaf Winstedt, a colonial administrator, in 1921. She joined the surgical unit at Singapore General Hospital and in 1932 she became the head of the hospital's newly established paediatric ward. She resigned in 1933 due to her husband's appointment as advisor to Johor but continued to volunteer at the Johor Bahru General Hospital. Return to Britain Sarah and Richard Winstedt returned to Britain in 1935, the same year that both received the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In 1937‚Äì8, she served as the assistant director of the Marie Curie Hospital for women with cancer in Hampstead. In World War II she again joined the war effort: she accompanied children who were evacuated to Canada, examined new recruits for the Auxiliary Territorial Service, and served as an industrial medical officer at the Royal Arsenal. After the war, she held positions at an asylum in Dartford and at Middlesex County Council before retiring in 1952. She co-wrote a textbook, Tropical Hygiene for Schools, which was published in 1950‚Äì3. Winstedt died from bronchopneumonia in 1972 in Havant, Hampshire. In 2014, she was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame and credited as \\"one of the [Malayan] colony's leading surgeons\\".

The worm is sessile and lives in sandy substrates where it utilizes suspension feeding in order to acquire nutrients.  Anatomy  The Jasmineira elegans is approximately 20 millimeters long and 1.5 millimeters wide, tapering at the posterior of its abdomen. Its slightly pink body is segmented. 8 segments compose the thorax and a variable number compose the abdomen. Along the first abdominal segment it has an anal groove. At the anterior end of its body the worm possesses a radiole crown composed of approximately a dozen radioles situated around its prostomium. Additionally, along the radiole crown are approximately 6 tentacular cirri.  Distribution and Behavior  The Jasmineira elegans is a macrobenthic suspension feeder native to the Northern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Red Sea. The worm is sessile and lives in sandy substrates, predominantly in coastal waters. Jasmineira elegans uses its fan-like radioles to feed on suspended detritus and to supply itself with oxygen. Early observations of the worm suggest they may be capable of regenerating damaged radioles. Jasmineira elegans is dioecious with the females carrying light-brown eggs inside the first 12 segments of the abdomen.  Environmental Perturbations  Studies on macrobenthic assemblages in coastal regions of the Mediterranean Sea suggest that the Jasmineira elegans is more sensitive to organic pollution than other Polychaetes that occupy the same environment.  Parasites  The Jasmineira mackiei is a parasite that uses Jasmineira elegans and two other Polychaetes in the same genus as hosts.

The Darbar is a symbol of love and peace where people from all different castes and religions come and pay their respects at this Darbar. The two main Darbars in Nakodar are Baba Murad Shah Ji Darbar and Almast Baba Lal Badshah Ji Darbar. Description It is a Sufi paradise located in Jalandhar District in Nakodar and is only 24 km away from Jalandhar City and 16 km from Kala Sanghian 114 km away from Amritsar . This pilgrimage site is a Sufi paradise which is very peaceful. The tomb is built in a structural way and photographs of Baba Murad Shah Ji are displayed at a couple of places which looks beautiful. The dargah of Baba Murad Shah ji after the death of Sai Laddi Shah Ji was offered to the famous Punjabi singer, Mr. Gurdas Maan Ji who has remained as a sewadaar. Various singers perform at this powerful place and also there is a mela (fair) celebrated regularly in Memory of Baba Murad Shah Ji and Sai Ghulam (Laddi) Shah Ji. Gurdas Maan is an ardent follower of Sai Laddi Shah Ji and also a frequent visitor. Sai Ji loved Gurdas Maan very much. Thursdays are the most crowded day to visit this place and about more than a thousand devotees visit this place on Thursday‚Äôs. This is because Thursday's are regarded as special days within Sufism. History Baba Murad Shah Ji became a disciple of Baba Shere Shah Ji. He opted Fakeeri at the age of 24 years and returned to God at the age of 28 years. Baba Shere Shah Ji always used to stay in lonely place and did not want people to come near him so that there would be no disturbance in his prayers.

Allaire, John Haggerty, and Charles Morgan. Originally put into packet service between New York City and Charleston, South Carolina, New York later served ports in along the Gulf of Mexico. New York was destroyed in the Gulf of Mexico by a hurricane on 7 September 1846. New YorkCharleston packet New York started running packet service for the New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company in 1837. As a ship of the line, it traveled between New York City and Charleston, South Carolina on a regular schedule. Shortly later though, a reorganization was triggered by the sinking of the steamship Home, which resulted in a buyout of the other partners‚Äô shares of the New York by Charles Morgan and John Haggerty. With Morgan acting as the managing partner, this was the start of the Charles Morgan Line.Baughman (1968), pp. 1519. New OrleansGalveston packet Morgan dispatched the New York to the Gulf of Mexico, and when it arrived in New Orleans early in 1839, he placed it under the management of the agency, Bogart & Hawthorn.Baughman (1968), p. 3233. New York replaced the Columbia on the New Orleans and Texas Line, a cartel established between Morgan and the owners of the Cuba, another steam packet running between New Orleans and Galveston, Texas. The two companies coordinated freight, rates, and scheduling.Baughman (1968), pp. 2228. This arrangement went on hiatus during the summer as Morgan sent the New York back to New York City for refitting, but returned to the Gulf of Mexico in time for the busy fall season. Starting in January 1840, New York was the only ship of the line between New Orleans and Galveston.Baughman (1968), pp. 3539. In a letter from November 1840, Mary Austin Holley provided some descriptions and characterizations of New York's cabin, such as the \\"luxurious couch\\" that prompted her to \\"think of nothing but Cleopatra.\\" The drapes were \\"blue satin and dimity\\" and the mahogany finishes were \\"polished like the finest pianos.\\" The dining table featured engraved silverware and cutlery with ivory handles, and was illuminated by hand-painted lamps. Morgan sold Columbia to Henry Windle, effectively creating a new competitor on the route. Neptune, owned by Captain Pennoyer, also competed for patronage on the route. New York continued running this route until being pulled back on 25 June 1841 due to diminished demand, but returned to service in the fall. This seasonal service pattern persisted for New York through 1845. In October 1845, agents advertised a $15 passenger ticket for cabin-class. Lost at sea On 5 September 1846, New York cast off from Galveston bound for New Orleans. The same evening, the ship sailed into a hurricane. The captain, John D. Phillips, tried to ride out the storm under anchor. In the early hours of the 7th, strong winds pulled New York off its anchorage and out to sea. A few hours later the ship started leaking before heavy winds took the promenade deck away. Of the 53 people on board, 17 drowned and 36 held onto flotsam until they were rescued by the steamship Galveston. In addition to the loss of life, as much as $40,000 in precious metals and cash went down with the ship. Discovery of the wreck In 1990, an unnamed amateur diver from Louisiana found the wreck of the New York using a fish-finding sonar machine, a LORAN navigational device, and data gathered from a wide network of Gulf shrimpers. A team of divers found a large part of the hull and a few artifacts. These included an 1827 gold coin, two 1843 U.S. fifty-cent pieces, and a mortising machine from an 1836 patent. Archaeological dives sponsored by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) in 1997 and 1998 brought scientific expertise to bear on the site. The teams scanned the ocean floor with a magnetometer and mapped the wreckage. They discovered important engine parts, including the air pump, cam, condenser, and main piston cylinder. A paddlewheel shaft was deposited in the sand about away. There were enough engine parts for experts to identify this wreckage as that of the 1837 steamship New York.

It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick with wooden trim. It is covered by a side gable roof pierced by three gabled dormers finished in wooden shingles. The main facade is five bays wide, with a recessed center entrance fronted by a gabled portico supported by round columns. An ell extends to the rear of the main block. The interior follows a center hall plan, with what was historically the main parlor on the left, and the library and dining room on the right, with service facilities in the ell. The house was built in 1929 for Arthur Spencer Jr., chairman of the board of the Hartford National Bank and Trust Company. It was designed by Ebbets & Frid, and marked the end of Asylum Hill's period as the city's fashionable residential area.

The contract for ¬£2,100 () was awarded to James Godfrey of Liskeard. The tower was left untouched as it was used as a landmark by the Admiralty and Trinity Board. It was reconstructed longer than the previous church as a nave and north aisle, with pentagonal chancel, in three sides of which there were double-light windows. The nave and aisle were divided by an arcade of four arches. The pillars were of Portland stone, with Devonshire marble shafts. The roofs were of Baltic timber, and the seating was Baltic wood and pitch pine. The floor was laid with Godwin tiles. The church accommodated 360 people. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Truro on 20 August 1883. In 1892 a new reredos was installed, designed by the architect Edwin J Munt and built by Harry Hems and Sons, in memory of Mrs. Bishop.

Pura Penataran Agung, also known as Pura Silawana Hyang Sar, is located in the middle part of the mountain; while at the base of the mountain, the Pura Dalem Dasar Lempuyang is built. Pura Penataran Agung Lempuyang is oriented toward the top of Mount Lempuyang. The temple compound is divided into three areas: the outer sanctum of the temple (jaba pisan or nistaning mandala), the middle sanctum (jaba tengah or madya mandala), and the inner main sanctum (jero or utamaning mandala). Entrance to the outer sanctum (jaba pisan) is marked with a white-painted candi bentar split gate. Several bale (Balinese pavilions) are located in the outer sanctum, one of them is the rectangular bale gong (\\"gong pavilion\\") where the gamelans are stored. Another bale in this courtyard is the bale kulkul where the percussive drum to call for prayer is placed. Entrance to the middle sanctum (jaba tengah) is marked with three white-painted paduraksa portals. The entrance to the left is used for entry, while the entrance to the right is used for exit. The central door is usually closed and is only opened during the pura's main festival e.g. the biannual piodalan festival. The central portal is where sacred objects, heirloom, and offerings could pass during festival time. All three flight of stairs which lead to the paduraksa portals is flanked with mythical figures of Naga. Sculptures inspired by the epic of Mahabharata, e.g. of Arjuna, Bima, and Yudhistira dots the landscape of the stair climb. On the uppermost level of these is the statue of Krishna, the worldly form of Vishnu. The uppermost inner sanctum (jero) is the most sacred courtyard of the Balinese temple. The courtyard of Pura Penataran Agung Lempuyang features several meru towers and pelinggih shrines each dedicated to different gods and local deities. Several padmasana shrines in the shape of empty stone thrones, each are dedicated to the highest god of Hindu pantheon e.g. the Sang Hyang Widhi and the gods of the Trimurti. Ritual The piodalan or puja wali festival (pura's anniversary) of Pura Penataran Agung is held once every 6 months every Waraspati (Thursday) or one day after the Galungan festival.

Established in 1845, it is one of the city's oldest cemeteries, and its first private non-sectarian cemetery. Its burials include a number of the city's high-profile civic and business leaders, as well as a substantial indigent population, and artist Frederic Edwin Church. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history Spring Grove Cemetery is located north of downtown Hartford, on the west side of Main Street between Mahl Avenue and Capen Street in the Clay-Arsenal neighborhood. It covers about of basically flat terrain, with only gentle undulations. It is accessed via a wrought iron archway on Main Street, which provides access to its network of circulating roads. Those roads are laid out in a basically rectilinear grid, and are finished in a combination of pavement, gravel, and grass. The oldest monument is that of the Page family, and is dated 1845. Its basic layout is little altered since its founding, and it retains most of its 19th-century features; a memorial chapel built in 1884 was destroyed by fire in 1904. The land on which the cemetery was established was farmland owned by the Page family when Stephen Page buried his wife there in 1845. The Pages then proceeded to sell burial plots (in contrast to typical cemetery practice of selling a right to interment) to others. In 1864 a number of plot owners banded together to purchase the entire cemetery, establishing the non-profit association that now manages the property three years later. In 1884, the association hired landscape designer Thomas Brown McClunnie to lay out the cemetery's northwest quadrant. In contrast to the rural cemetery movement, McClunnie's parklike setting emphasized a simple rectangular layout, rather than winding lanes that conformed to local topography.

He was pardoned by the governor of California in 2017 because DNA testing, not available at his original trial, did not support his conviction.  Early Life  Coley was born in June, 1947 and was in the Navy during the Vietnam war and his service included several deployments to Vietnam aboard USS Enterprise and USS Bainbridge.https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Man-Who- Spent-Nearly-40-Years-Behind-Bars-for-Crime-He-Did-Not-Commit-Speaks- Out-459619243.htmlhttps://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2018/06/09/hawaii- news/hilo-man-a-big-part-of-exonerated-friends-life/  Wicht murder case  On November 11, 1978 24-year-old Rhonda Wicht and her 4-year-old son, Donald Wicht, were found dead in her apartment in Simi Valley, a suburb of Los Angeles, California. Donald Wicht had been suffocated and Rhonda Wicht had been raped, beaten and strangled. The police suspected Coley was the murderer because he had been Rhonda Wicht's boyfriend for two years and the couple had recently broken up. Coley was arrested the same day as the murders and charged with the double murder. The first trial resulted in a hung jury. The second trial in 1980 led to his conviction and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. After Coley lost his final appeal to his conviction, the judge ordered all evidence to be destroyed. During his imprisonment, Coley was incarcerated in the California State Prison, Los Angeles County and the Folsom State Prison.https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2017/11/20/man-wrongly- convicted-1978-killings-simi-valley-recommended-release-prison/882970001/ https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-craig-coley-wrongful- conviction-20180215-story.html  New investigation  Michael Bender, a serving detective with Simi Valley Police Department, started to re- investigate Coley's case in 1989 and discovered there were problems with it. Until their deaths, Coley's father and mother, a retired police officer and teacher respectively, had been trying to free their son. Simi Valley Police Chief Dave Livinstone requested a new investigation by cold case Detective Dan Swanson. Det. Swanson located missing evidence, and had it forensically examined. DNA testing, not available at the original trial, showed there was no trace of Coley's DNA on the evidence, but that there was the DNA of an unknown suspect. Investigators also disproved the testimony of a witness from the original trial who claimed to have seen Coley at the scene of the crime. In a report to the local police, three former and current police officers testified that the detective at the time of Coley's trial had ‚Äúmishandled the investigation or framed Mr. Coley.‚Äù The local prosecutor felt the original detectives decided Coley was guilty too quickly and that they were victims of \\"tunnel vision\\".  Pardon  California governor Jerry Brown pardoned Coley on November 22, 2017, because the evidence showed he was innocent of the murders. In February 2018, the California Victims Compensation Board awarded Coley almost $2 million in compensation for his wrongful imprisonment for almost 40 years. On February 23, 2019, Coley received a $21 million settlement from the city of Simi Valley. City Manager Eric Levitt said of the case that \\"While no amount of money can make up for what happened to Mr Coley, settling this case is the right thing to do for Mr Coley and our community. The monetary cost of going to trial would be astronomical and it would be irresponsible for us to move forward in that direction\\". Of the $21 million that Coley would be awarded, Simi Valley city said they will pay about $4.9 million, with the remainder to be made up by other sources, including insurance. Coley‚Äôs prison term, at nearly 38 years, is the longest in California for someone whose conviction had been overturned. Coley‚Äôs time behind bars is the 14th-longest nationwide for a proven wrongful conviction case. After Coley's release and the subsequent arrest of the suspected Golden State Killer, DNA testing was conducted to see if the Golden State Killer was the real murderer. DNA testing, however, proved inconclusive and the search for the real killer continues.https://www.toacorn.com/articles/exonerated-man- now-works-to-educate-law-enforcement/  References  1947 births Living people People wrongfully convicted of murder People from California Overturned convictions in the United States Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Craig Coley"},{"id":"55893091","text":"Muriel Nissel (n√©e Griffiths; 30 January 1921 ‚Äì 2010) was a British statistician and civil servant.

As measured by annual total revenues in 2016, the company is the largest provider of early childhood education service in China. It owns three preschool-educational brands, namely RYB Parent-Child Garden, RYB Kindergarten, and Zhudou Parenting App-kit Club, and has strategic cooperation with some American preschool education institutes. The firm is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company was registered in the Cayman Islands, and its headquarter is in Beijing.  Background  RYB Education was founded by Cao Chimin (ÊõπËµ§Ê∞ë) and Shi Yanlai (Âè≤ÁáïÊù•) in 1998. Shi Yanlai was a student in Peking University. She and Cao Chimin both obtained master's degree from Australian National University and Tsinghua University. At the beginning, RYB Parent-Child Garden invited Liang Zhiyan (Ê¢ÅÂøóÁÑ±) from Beijing Normal University to establish a teaching and research centre, and they developed some preschool courses. By the end of 1999, their first parent- child courses were started,. followed by courses aiming at various ages. In 2000, RYB Education obtained a licence for the education of 0-6-year-old kids from the education bureau. After three years, RYB Parent-Child Garden started to have direct educational institutes,. In the year 2001, 38 shareholders of RYB Education established Beijing RYB Education Inc, and Shi Yanlai was appointed chairperson of the board of directors. In the same year, franchising started to be allowed. RYB Education started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on . Its documentation for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed the shareholding status: Ascendent Rainbow (Cayman) Limited was the principal shareholder, with 30.1 percent of the shares;. Cao Chimin, was second, with 23.6 percent, and Shi Yanla third, with 13.5 percent.  Problems  During the expanding of the firm from 2010 to 2017, several RYB kindergartens were closed, or disappeared in Zhengzhou in Henan, Weifang in Shandong, Yibin in Sichuan, and Tianjin. There were also problems with disease: by the end of June 2016, several toddlers were infected with HFMD at RYB kindergartens in Wankecheng Branch in Qingdao. = Abuse claims = Some kindergartens under RYB Education has been reported to abuse toddlers. The first reported incident occurred in December 2015 in Tiexi District, Siping City, Jilin Province, China, where the RYB kindergarten was reported to abuse about 30 toddlers with needle stabbing. The kindergarten director claimed that since the kindergarten was monitored over CCTV, the teachers did not have chances to abuse the children. However, this kindergarten was closed by the Bureau of Education of Tiexi District, and 5 teachers were detained by the police. In 2016, four of the teachers were sentenced to two years and ten months' imprisonment for guardianship abuse. The prosecution accused the defendants of stabbing several children with sewing needles on their heads, limbs, buttocks, and legs, deliberately avoiding the CCTV, and threatening the children with punishment. These four defendants claimed they were not guilty, and they all lodged appeals. In December 2016, Intermediate People's Court of Siping, Jilin dismissed the appeals and upheld the original verdicts. In April 2017, a video about the kindergarten circulated on the internet, showing kindergarten teacher hustling and kicking the children in their charge. That month, RYB Education established emergency group to track the incident, and said that it had exposed some problems on management that should be concentrated on and should be dealt by law. In November, 2017, more than ten parents of children at the Beijing school reported that their children in a class at RYB Education Xintiandi Kindergarten in Guanzhuang, Chaoyang District, Beijing were needle-abused and were given white pills of unknown ingredients, and provided a number of photos allegedly showed toddlers' pinholes. The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Chaoyang Branch investigated. After the incident was reported on 23 November by the Beijing News, other media scrambled to report. Dozens of parents who wanted to know about the situation tried to meet with the registrar, asking to watch the kindergarten's surveillance video, but were stopped by the security guard. On 25 November, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau declared that one kindergarten teacher was detained for toddler abuse, and one parent was arrested for making up rumours. On 28 November, the Bureau sent a post on Sina Weibo that stated that nobody had sexually assaulted toddlers. The post also claimed that \\"feeding drugs\\" and \\"sexual assault\\" were rumours made up by the two parents.

The group is the largest still fighting after the end of the South Sudanese Civil War. NAS mainly operates in the Equatoria region of South Sudan. Its goals are the removal of the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, from office and the establishment of federalism. On November 25th 2017, Major Gen. Lawrence Amitayo Legge, the Operations Commander for the SPLM-IO Western Mundri Command announced his resignation of the SPLM-IO army with his officers to join NAS under the leader of Gen. Thomas Cirillo. NAS was not a party to the Revitalized Agreement in South Sudan and thus continues to engage in fighting despite the ceasefire mostly holding in the rest of the country. There was, however, a minor faction of NAS that split from Cirillo's forces and signed the Agreement. On 2 February 2019 NAS soldiers claimed to have repulsed SSPDF from Senema village near border with Democratic Republic of Congo.  Etymology  While written in all caps, NAS is not an acronym, instead it is derived from the Arabic word ŸÜÿßÿ≥ (nas), meaning people.  History  The National Salvation Front was founded on March 6, 2017, by Lt. Gen. Thomas Cirillo Swaka, a member of the Bari ethnic group. Cirillo had been the Deputy Chief of Staff of Logistics for the army of South Sudan, the SPLA, but he resigned on February 11, 2017, in response to what he believed was the \\"tribalization\\" of the army under the leadership of president Salva Kiir. On March 9, 2017, the SSDM-Cobra Faction under Khalid Butrous merged with NAS. On March 1, 2018, NAS joined the South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA), a coalition of rebel groups that opposed the government. On August 5, 2018, Julius Tabule Daniel declared himself the interim chairman of NAS. This lead to a split in the movement, and Tabule's group declared Khalid Butrous as its leader, becoming known as NAS-KB. NAS-KB signed the R-ARCSS peace deal in September 2018, while the main NAS group under Cirillo continued to fight. Another group called the Equatorian Non-Alligned Forces (ENAF) lead by Moses Yanga Yoana allegedly broke away from NAS; it signed a peace deal with the government in February 2019. On September 24, 2018, NAS and members of the SSOA that did not sign the R-ARCSS formed the South Sudan National Democratic Alliance (SSNDA), lead by Cirillo. Between December 2018 and March 2019, major clashes between the SSPDF (the South Sudanese army) and NAS in Yei River State displaced around 15,000 people. On August 30, 2019 the SSNDA merged with several other rebel groups to form the South Sudan Opposition Movements Alliance (SSOMA). The SSOMA entered into negotiations in Rome facilitated by the Community of Sant'Egidio, and it signed a Cessation of Hostilities agreement on January 12, 2020. While this declaration initially reduced the violence, NAS and the SSPDF resumed clashes in the summer of 2020.

In 2012, he founded the online freethought community Atheist Republic, a Canada-based non-profit organisation which now has hundreds of branches called \\"consulates\\" in several countries around the world such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, enabling nonbelievers to interact in societies where irreligion, apostasy and blasphemy are often criminalised and repressed. As an author, he debuted with the book Why There Is No God (2014), and in 2017 he became a co-host of the Secular Jihadists from the Middle East podcast with Ali A. Rizvi, Yasmine Mohammad and Faisal Saeed Al Mutar. In January 2018, the show was renamed Secular Jihadists for a Muslim Enlightenment, with Rizvi and Navabi as co-hosts.  Biography  = Youth = Navabi was born in 1983 and raised as a Shia Muslim in Tehran. He briefly moved to Germany in 1985 and London in 1986, before returning to Tehran in 1988. His family was liberal and not particularly devout but in school he was taught to believe in a literal hell and that committing even the smallest sin would get him there. Navabi reasoned that if the afterlife was supposed to last for eternity then this should be everyone's top priority during their life on Earth. Yet he found that few of those around him, though claiming to believe this, did not act like it was of the utmost importance. To avoid hell at all costs before reaching the \\"age of reason\\" at 15 (age 9 for girls), he considered suicide, since any sin (including suicide) committed before then supposedly did not 'count', even if this would only take him to the lowest part of heaven. At age 12, Navabi attempted suicide by jumping out of his school window, but was unsuccessful. It left him in a wheelchair for 7 months, and he missed one year in school. = Apostasy and emigration = Recovering from his attempt and feeling bad about distressing his family, Navabi became an even more fervent Muslim, never missing a prayer, never even looking at girls lest he become tempted, and diligently studying Islam. However, the more he learned the more doubts he developed as the religion appeared to make no sense to him, demanding an incredibly high toll on Muslims' everyday life and punishing all non-Muslims with eternal torture. Studying other religions provoked his skepticism even further. A milestone event was reading a book on the history of religion in college: \\"I saw how convenient it was to change the concept of God and what he wanted based on the politics of the time. Why do I even accept this as true? I'd never asked myself whether this could all just be made up.\\" In a desperate prayer and in great fear of hell, Navabi reached out to God to reveal himself and prove that he was real; however, he received no answer, lost his faith and eventually concluded God was imaginary. Navabi attended the University of Tehran for about a year, studying molecular biology. When in college, Navabi initially thought that he might be crazy, being the only atheist he knew. However, when he confided in two of his university friends, revealing his newly developed ideas, they became skeptical about religion within weeks. This encouraged him to look for fellow atheists on the Internet. He didn't want to stay in Tehran, and managed to obtain a student visa for the University of British Columbia to study finance. He arrived in Vancouver on 10 October 2004, later becoming a permanent resident and eventually obtaining Canadian citizenship. There, he created Atheist Republic in 2012 to build a global atheist community and a platform for his activism. = Deplatforming incidents = Navabi became a target of several deplatforming attempts in 2019. In February 2019, Cherwell, a student newspaper at the University of Oxford, refused to publish an interview of Navabi in its online edition, on the grounds that it \\"may be considered offensive\\". The interview was published in the newspaper's print edition. The profile editor Freddie Hayward who conducted the interview resigned in protest. In March 2019, Mount Royal University in the Canadian city of Calgary cancelled a scheduled speaking event featuring Navabi, organised by the Atheist Society of Calgary. The university stated that it was unwilling to host the event after the Christchurch mosque shootings, but \\"would absolutely have the speaker come to our campus at another time\\". In August, Alberta Minister of Advanced Education Demetrios Nicolaides (UCP) said Navabi's deplatforming and similar incidents should have been prevented, and that Nicolaides was working on a stronger academic free speech policy.  Atheist Republic  = Foundation = While still living in Iran, Navabi founded the group \\"Iranian Atheists\\" on Orkut around 2003, to connect with other nonbelievers in his country. He was shocked, surprised and delighted there were so many others like him, and those feelings were mutual: \\"It felt like coming home to a family you didn't even know you had.\\" After some time, Navabi decided to try and reach atheists beyond the Islamic Republic of Iran, and created the contrastingly named page \\"Atheist Republic\\" on Facebook in January 2012. It was followed by the Facebook Group in February 2012 and the website www.atheistrepublic.com later in 2012 which as of July 2017 received approximately 5 million views per week. Atheist Republic brings nonbelievers together from around the world, promotes LGBTQ and women's rights and fights against the persecution of atheists. According to Navabi, these liberation values, that AR seeks to spread, are under attack from Islamism, the alt-right and the regressive left. = Growth = Rana held this Atheist Republic paper in the Great Mosque of Mecca. Speaking of the Atheist Republic community on BBC Trending in June 2014, Navabi said: \\"We want people to realise that they're not alone. We want people to realise they don't have to be ashamed of who they are.\\" In 2014, Saudi ex- Muslim Rana Ahmad was having trouble in her family, she sought and found the help of Atheist Republic as well as other similar organisations online. When her family forced her to come along with the hajj, she took a picture of herself holding a piece of paper with \\"Atheist Republic\\" written on it, while standing inside the Great Mosque of Mecca, the holiest site of Islam. She subsequently fled to Germany, aided by Atheist Republic and Faith to Faithless. As of May 2017, Atheist Republic's Facebook page had 1.6 million followers; this number grew to 2.1 followers by February 2019. = Islamist Facebook reporting scandal = In May 2017, admins of the Atheist Republic claimed their Facebook page had been shut down three times after what appeared to be a co-ordinated campaign by religious activists. With over 1.6 million likes at the time, it was alleged to be \\"the most popular atheist community on any social network.\\" Having been restored again, Atheist Republic requested to be exempt from the automatic \\"unpublication\\" system that is activated as soon as the page is flagged often enough, which leaves any page vulnerable to be shut down by sheer numbers of opponents. Atheist Republic was not the only victim; there were coordinated Islamist campaigns using the slogan \\"Report Anti-Islamic Pages\\" targeting similar atheist, secularist and ex-Muslim pages and groups on Facebook such as Ex-Muslims of North America (which had a group with 24,000 members at the time) and 10 other groups. Atheist Republic's CEO Allie Jackson and Ex-Muslims of North America's president Muhammad Syed made joint efforts to get the pages and groups back online, and launched a Change.org petition (which gathered over 8,000 signatures). On 10 May 2017, Atheist Republic and nearly 40 other secular, atheist and ex-Muslim organisations wrote an open letter to the Facebook administrators to request an improvement to its reporting system to protect \\"vulnerable groups\\" against religious fundamentalists' abuse of the reporting function. A Facebook spokesperson responded that they were \\"very sorry\\" for the erroneous removal of pages, and that the company had restored them as soon they were able to investigate. = Malaysian government crackdown attempts = In August 2017, a picture from a gathering of the Atheist Republic Consulate of Kuala Lumpur was posted on Atheist Republic's Facebook page. Deputy Minister of Islamic Affairs Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki ordered an inquiry into whether the people in the photograph had committed apostasy, which is illegal in Malaysia, and ex- Muslims can be fined, jailed or sent for counselling. The next day a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Shahidan Kassim went as far to say that atheists should be \\"hunted down\\" as there was no place for groups like this under the Federal Constitution. Atheist Republic members present at the gathering who received death threats on social media were being investigated about whether they had 'spread atheism to Muslims', which has also been outlawed in the country. Navabi asked: \\"How is this group harming anyone?\\", warning that such actions by the government damaged Malaysia's reputation as a \\"moderate\\" Muslim-majority (60%) country. The uploads sparked violent protests from some Malaysians who called Navabi an 'apostate' and threatened to behead the Atheist Republic's leader. Under the pseudonym of \\"Michael\\" one of the Kuala Lumpur AR Consulate admins told BBC OS that meetings occur about two or three times a year between people who normally only communicate on the Internet: In November 2017 the government and the Internet regulator Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission had demanded that Atheist Republic's page and similar atheist pages on Facebook be taken down. However, Facebook refused to do so because the pages did not violate any of the company's community standards. In February 2019 Navabi expressed his frustration that \\"there were no consequences. Malaysia didn't feel the wrath of the international community, like you would if you said we need to hunt down the Jews or Muslims. As you should obviously: there need to be major consequences for that, and thankfully there are. But why aren't there consequences of saying we need to hunt down the atheists?‚Äù =Conflict with the Universal Hindu Council = In September 2020, many Hindus were angered by Armin Navabi's creation of t-shirts featuring a sexualized version of the Hindu deity Kali. Vinod Bansal of the Universal Hindu Council filed a report against Armin Navabi with the Delhi Police and Mumbai Police for allowing blasphemous content to be featured on Twitter and also tagged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a complaint. Twitter suspended Navabi after listening to those complaints.

It is above all the specially produced glaze which is the distinguishing feature of her undecorated pottery. As a result of both her work and her teaching, she has exerted considerable influence on Danish potters. Biography Born in R√∏dby on 20 November 1918, Gudrum Agnete Tryde Eriksen was the daughter of the parish priest Erik Eriksen (1870‚Äì1947) and Louise Tryde (1876‚Äì1966). From 1936, she attended the School of Arts and Crafts where she specialized in ceramics, graduating in 1939. While still studying, she exhibited at the Charlottenborg autumn exhibition in 1938, inspired by old artefacts she had seen in the National Museum. The demand for ceramics during the Second World War encouraged production in the early 1940s and thereafter. Eriksen first collaborated with √Öse Feilberg and Christian Frederiksen in Hareskov before establishing her own workshop in Kastrup in 1942. That year she also successfully exhibited in Stockholm in the Dansk Kunsthaandv√¶rk (Danish Craftmanship) show organized by Mogens Koch. When the exhibition came to Copenhagen's Danish Design Museum, she sold a piece titled S√∏pindsvinet (The Sea Urchin) to the museum. In 1948, Eriksen went to St Ives in England where she stayed with the potter Bernard Leach who had gained significance by publishing A Potter's Book in 1940. It was based on his familiarity with Chinese and Japanese pottery. She then went to France where she visited the potters Vassil Ivanoff in La Borne, a hamlet in Henrichemont, and Eug√®ne Lion in Saint-Amand-en-Puisaye. After spending a couple of years working with Felix M√∏hl (1906‚Äì85), Eriksen established her own workshop in an old school in Hundested where she became a pioneering Danish potter, soon becoming recognized internationally. From 1948, her distinctive works bore no decoration, relying on a glaze she learnt from the English ceramist, Michael Gill (born 1927) in 1950. She developed the technique herself, producing blue, brown and grey artefacts. The glaze consisted of a combination of borax, quartz, clay and ash. In the early 1970s, Eriksen travelled to central Japan on several occasions, once again meeting Bernard Leach and studying Korean techniques which inspired her later work. Eriksen's work has been widely exhibited, both in Denmark and abroad, with solo exhibitions in Germany, France, England, Sweden and the United States. A large retrospective exhibition was held at the Vejen Art Museum in Jutland in the summer of 2001. She has received many awards, including the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (1969) and Thorvald Bindesb√∏ll Medal (1985), the Prince Eugen Medal (2000) and the C. F. Hansen Medal (2004). Gutte Eriksen died on 8 July 2008. Personal life In 1951, Eriksen married the painter Preben Hansen with whom she had two children, a daughter and a son.

Editorial Structure  = Editorial Process = Established scientists write kid-friendly articles on either core concepts or new discoveries in their fields. To make the scientific research comprehensible for the journal's late elementary and middle school audiences, the articles rely heavily on key words and glossary sections for scientific nomenclature. After the submission passes a preliminary evaluation by an adult FYP editor, school-aged children, then, decide whether the articles should be published. Alongside a science mentor, a student from the 3rd to 10th grade reviews the articles and provides feedback about the papers' clarity and accessibility. Then, the original writers, science mentors, and adult FYM editors collaborate to revise the article based on the children's comments. According to the journal's founders Sabine Kastner and Robert T.

The pura is known for its bare red brick architecture, reminiscent of the architecture of the 13th-century Majapahit Kingdom, hence the name. Pura Maospahit is the only pura in Bali which was built using a concept known as Panca Mandala where the most sacred area is situated at the center instead of at the direction of the mountain. History The history of Pura Maospahit is recorded in the Babad Wongayah Dalem, a stone inscription mentioning the story of Sri Kbo Iwa, an architect of Balinese religious architecture. Sri Kbo Iwa built a shrine structure known as the Candi Raras Maospahit, in 1200 Saka year (or 1278 Gregorian calendar). The Candi Raras Maospahit is mentioned as a \\"pelinggih (shrine) in the form of a large red-brick building with two terracota statues flanking the main entrance\\". Today, the red-brick building Candi Raras Maospahit still exists and become the main shrine of the Pura Maospahit temple complex. During the reign of the kingdom of Badung in Denpasar, I Pasek the architect was instructed to construct another candi to be used for wayang performance. Before the construction commenced, I Pasek went to Majapahit to study the proper proportion of the new shrine. After I Pasek completed the design of the new shrine, he returned to Denpasar and construct the new shrine in 1475 Saka yar (or year 1553) known as the Candi Raras Majapahit. The building stands beside the earlier Candi Raras Maospahit. Temple compound A candi bentar split gate marking the entrance to the middle sanctum, the jaba tengah. Pura Maospahit is the only temple in Bali that was built using the concept of Panca Mandala. Unlike most Balinese Hindu which is arranged with the most sacred inner sanctum (jero) to the direction of the mountain, the Panca Mandala concept places the most sacred jero area at the center of the temple complex. This form of arrangement is similar to the ancient temples of Majapahit or to the kraton palaces of ancient Java. Pura Maospahit is surrounded by five mandalas or courtyard (panca mandala literally means \\"five mandalas\\"). The first mandala is located to the west of the main shrine, access to this mandala is marked by a red-brick kori agung gate facing Jalan Sutomo, known as the Candi Kusuma. A bale kulkul (drum tower) is situated in the first mandala. The second mandala to the south of the main shrine is marked by a kori agung gate known as Candi Renggat, which provides access to the second mandala. The third mandala, known as jaba sisi is located to the west of the shrine and can be accessed through a gate known as Candi Rebah. The third mandala is where the kitchen of the temple compound is located used to prepare offerings to the shrine. The fourth mandala known as jaba tengah or madya mandala can be accessed through a candi bentar split gate via the east side of the third mandala courtyard. The fourth mandala was used to display sacred art which is only shown during festivals in Pura Maospahit. The fourth mandala is where several bale (Balinese pavilion) is located e.g. bale pesucian (purification pavilion), bale tajuk, and bale sumanggen. The fifth mandala known as the jero or the utamaning mandala (\\"main mandala\\") is the center most sacred mandala where the main shrines are located: the red- bricked Candi Raras Maospahit and Candi Raras Majapahit. Each of the shrines are dedicated to Ratu Ayu Mas Maospahit and to Ida Bhatara Lingsir Sakti. Other pelinggih shrines similarly built in red bricks and thatched roof dotted the utamaning mandala, each is dedicated toward a local deity. Temple festival The biannual piodalan/pujawali festival of the temple is held every Purnama Jyestha to honor Ratu Ayu Mas Maospahit, and every Purnama Kalima to honor Ida Bhatara Lingsir Sakti.

It links Vesterbrogade in the north with Math√¶usgade and Otto Krabbes Plads in the south. It is accessed through a gateway in the building at Vesterbrogade 65-78 and is closed to car traffic in the other end. History The Westend complex seen from Vesterbrogade in 1919 Vesterbro was in the 19th century Copenhagen's principal entertainment district. Prostitution was legalized in 1866. On 9 March 1877 the Ministry of Justice issued a Resolution About Police Control With Public Women in Copenhagen, introducing a system where matrons were licensed to operate \\"public houses\\". The police was authorized to refer the public houses to specific streets and Badevej became the principal brothel street in Vesterbro. The street was in 1886 renamed Knudsgade. In 1877, Copenhagen was home to a total of fifty licensed brothels with approximately 300 \\"public women\\". \\"Foreningen imod Lovbeskyttelse for Us√¶delighed\\", a branch of \\"La f√©deration britnniqve, Continentale et g√©n√©rale\\", was founded in 1894. Prostitutes were required to have individual addresses after brothels became illegal in 1901. A group of developers purchased a property further out on Vesterbrogade with the intention of creating a private street where prostitutes could operate from individual apartments. Construction began in 1903 but the plans were stopped by the so-called October Act which illegalized prostitution. The Westend complex became instead popular with actors and theatre people. Architecture The Westend complex was designed by the architect Albert Jensen who has previously worked for Ferdinand Meldahl and designed buildings such as the Magasin du Nord department store on Kongens Nytorv. The building is designed in the Art Deco with inspiration from Parisian architecture. Its most characteristic feature is the elaborate rough iron balconies. Street art The interior of the gateway at Vesterbrogade 76-67 has since 2010 featured changing works of street art as a result of a street art project entitled \\"Wild at Westend\\".

It is located about 36 kilometers from Dalcahue, 28 kilometers from Quemchi and 54 kilometers from Castro. The town of Tena√∫n is accessed from the north, by a road that begins on the route between Dalcahue and Quemchi. This land route, built in 1950, allowed the integration of the town to the rest of the island. The town of Tena√∫n was founded in the 18th century, being one of the oldest in Chilo√©. It was part of the larch trade route and since its inception was an intermediate port between Chacao and Castro. In the 19th century, it experienced an urban boom as a result of logging that favored its development. Thanks to the historical relevance of the forest trade is that many of the houses of the town were built with larch coatings. The urban landscape is composed of the edge-sea, a longitudinal plane parallel to the coastline. The urban order of the town has as axes: the church, the square and the cemetery, in east-west direction. The church of Tena√∫n, built in the mid-nineteenth century, is located at the end of the main street and in front of the square, it is the most imposing construction of the town, it stands out for its three towers and because it protrudes from the axis, which allows its vision from afar, mainly from the sea. The year 1999 was declared a National Historic Monument and the year 2000 a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The elongated square is another of the emblems of the city, made up of two facades that form a recognizable group with their own identity, marking a boundary between the high houses, which face the hill, and the low ones that face the sea. One of the most deeply rooted traditions in this town is the Minga, which consists in the transfer of houses through the sea or land. In the area, this tradition has a social event of great participation that favors interaction and community sense strongly rooted in Chiloe identity. History The word Tena√∫n means \\"three hills\\" in the Mapuche Huilliche language, the language of the ancient Huilliche inhabitants of the sector. It was founded in 1567, the year in which the Spanish conquistadors, led by Mart√≠n Ruiz de Gamboa, settled in Chilo√© after founding Castro. The village emerged as a town of merchants who extracted larch from the Chauques Islands. The town maintains its original characteristics and is recognized as a focus of permanence of the Chilote traditions. By virtue of its cultural value, on November 5, 2004 it was declared a National Monument in the category of a Typical Zone. On September 4, 2015, Tena√∫n was declared an Urban Zone by the Municipality of Dalcahue. Attractions Tena√∫n is characterized by the style of its houses, some of them neo-colonial style with German influence, while others are lined with larch tiles. Several of the latter were taken to Tena√∫n by land and even by sea, through the traditional Chilote system known as the minga of house plowing, to such an extent that the place is known as \\"the town where the houses sail\\". Its church, called Nuestra Se√±ora del Patrocinio, is a National Monument (1999) and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000, along with the other churches of Chilo√©. It was built in 1837 by Franciscan priest Roberto Fern√°ndez, and later was renovated in a neoclassical style, with a main tower and two smaller towers on each side, which could reflect the three hills of Tena√∫n or the mystery of the Holy Trinity. Every summer the Meeting of the Cords of the Accordion is celebrated, an activity of great importance because the place is known for the importance of the artists of the area that participate in this festival, as is the week of Tena√∫n, where for 7 days there are activities for neighbors, tourists and people interested in participating to commemorate a new anniversary of Tena√∫n.

In one of Pliny's letters to his boyhood friend Voconius Romanus (Book 9, Epistle 7), he named them as his favourites. In his letter, Pliny wrote that the Tragedy villa was atop a ridge above the lake, but the Comedy villa was right on the water's edge and that \\"each of them has particular beauties; a diversity which renders them to their master as still more agreeable.\\"Orrery, John Boyle, 5th Earl of (1751). The letters of Pliny the Younger: with observations on each letter, p. 245. Bettenham According to the letter, Pliny had derived the villas' names from their geographical positions and the conventions of Roman theatre. He saw the Tragedy villa as rising from its setting like an actor wearing the tragedian's high platform boots ('), while the Comedy villa down by the lake wore the lowly comedian's slippers ('). Both villas have long since vanished, and their exact locations remain a subject of speculation.Bagot, Richard (1912). The Italian Lakes, pp. 107-108. A. & C. BlackDe la Ruffini√®re du Prey, Pierre (1994). The Villas of Pliny from Antiquity to Posterity, pp. 5-8. University of Chicago Press. Although the Tragedy villa is widely assumed to have been located in Bellagio somewhere on the estate of the present-day Villa Serbelloni, no architectural remains have ever been found.Palaci√°, Pilar and Rurali, Elisabetta (2009). Bellagio Center‚ÄìVilla Serbelloni: A Brief History, pp. 21‚Äì22; 68; 148. Rockefeller Foundation. Retrieved 26 November 2017. It is even less clear where the Comedy villa was situated. The 16th-century historian Paolo Giovio thought that it was at Lenno facing the Tragedy villa but that its remains were now underwater. The Flemish geographer Abraham Ortelius, Giovio's younger contemporary, also wrote that Lenno was the site of the Comedy villa.Gibson, Roy K. and Morello, Ruth (2012). Reading the Letters of Pliny the Younger, p. 200. Cambridge University Press. However in 1876, a Roman mosaic floor and many Roman coins were found in Lierna, another small town on Lake Como. Many there now think that the mosaic floor may have been part of the Comedy villa. In the early 1900s the French geographer √âlis√©e Reclus had described Lierna as the site of a Pliny villa, although he did not specify which one.Reclus, √âlis√©e (1902). L'Italia nella natura, nella storia, negli abitanti, nell'arte e nella vita presente, Vol. 1, p. 282. Italian translation by Attilio Brunialti. Societ√† editrice libraria Goretti, Aurelio (2001). Lierna: un paese tra lago e monti. Comune di Lierna. Extracts retrieved from Lierna.net 25 November 2017 . In 1751 John Boyle, 5th Earl of Orrery, a close friend of Alexander Pope, published an English translation of Pliny's letters. The letter to Voconius Romanus describing the Comedy and Tragedy villas was illustrated with an imagined depiction of the Comedy villa by Samuel Wale. According to the architectural historian Pierre de la Ruffini√®re du Prey, the villa in Wale's drawing bears a noticeable resemblance to Pope's villa on the River Thames. Pliny's own description of the Comedy villa mentioned that its terrace was gently curved like the bay on which it stood. He could fish directly from his bedroom window and likened lying in his bed to lying in a fishing boat on the lake.

Led by Yoanis Okiech, the TFNF originally split from the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in late October 2015 and subsequently started an insurgency against the SPLM government. In course of 2016, however, it also came into conflict with SPLM-IO rebels, leading to inter-rebel fighting which resulted in Okiech's death and the group's destruction in January 2017.  Background  Land formally part of the Shilluk Kingdom before the creation of new states in 2015. The TFNF claimed that the lands east of the Nile would be occupied by Dinka as consequence of President Kiir's decree. The Shilluk are South Sudan's third-largest ethnic group and mostly live in the country's former Upper Nile state. Centuries ago, the Shilluk formed a sophisticated and powerful kingdom, which has survived to the present day even though it lost its independence during the 19th century. Wary of any outside powers, the Shilluk are much more loyal to each other, their monarchy and their lands than to South Sudan, as the \\"fertile floodplains of the Nile River, after all, have done more for them than any government ever has\\". Upon the outbreak of the South Sudanese Civil War, the Shilluk militias mostly sided with the Dinka- dominated government; this changed, however, when President Salva Kiir Mayardit decided to increase the number of South Sudan's states to 28 in mid-2015. This move was widely denounced by Shilluk as attempt to divide their homeland, driving several Shilluk militias into armed rebellion.  Foundation and independent operations  The beginnings of the Tiger Faction New Forces are tied to Yoanis Okiech, one of the leading Shilluk commanders in South Sudan's army, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Okiech initially remained loyal to the government when Shilluk elements in the SPLA, most notably John Uliny's Agwelek forces, rebelled in May 2015. Nevertheless, the government did not trust him and put him under house arrest while his troops remained in Manyo County in northern Upper Nile State, from which they had driven SPLM-IO rebels in early 2015. Okiech consequently expressed sympathy for Uliny's uprising, and when the President finally decreed the creation of new states in October 2015, he and his forces mutinied. At the time, Okiech's superior, Major General Ayok Ogat, had left his soldiers for Juba, an opportunity which Okiech used to launch surprise attacks on SPLA loyalists at Wadakona and Tor Gwang in Manyo County on 29 October 2015. The government claimed that Okiech's followers numbered just 90 men and that their first attacks had failed, whereas the rebels said that their assaults had been a success. The Tiger Faction New Forces controlled much of northern Western Nile State (pictured) in early 2016 On 30 October, Okiech officially announced the formation of the \\"Tiger Faction New Forces\\". The declared intention of the new group was to reverse the division of the Shilluk Kingdom through the creation of new states, which TFNF considered an unconstitutional move by the \\"corrupt clique in Juba\\" with the aim of giving Shilluk lands to Dinka. Although there had been reports that the TFNF subsequently joined Uliny's Agwelek forces, the Tigers in fact remained independent, though began to cooperate closely with the Agwelek forces, and, by extension, the SPLM-IO. Attacking loyalist forces at Wadakona, Gabat, Mananmand Ajot, Nyanowar, and Tor Gwang, the TFNF expanded its area of control. Although the Tigers were not powerful enough to capture the strategically significant town of Renk, they controlled much of northern Western Nile State by early 2016, also thanks to widespread support by local Shilluk civilians. In turn, the SPLA launched numerous counter-attacks against the TFNF between October 2015 and February 2016.  Joining the NDM and destruction  The SPLM-IO attempted to convince the TFNF to officially join them in March 2016, but their offer to appoint Okiech as commander of the \\"Special Brigade One\\" was rebuffed. The TFNF explained their refusal with the readiness of the SPLM-IO to negotiate a peace agreement with the government. In contrast, the Tigers refused to end their insurgency as long as the Shilluk Kingdom was not restored per its 1956 borders. The TFNF instead joined the National Democratic Movement (NDM), a Shilluk rebel group formed by Lam Akol. As the NDM is a rival to the SPLM-IO, hostilities consequently grew between the Tigers and the SPLM-IO-affiliated Agwelek forces, leading to inter-rebel fighting. In January 2017, the SPLM-IO forces in Western Upper Nile launched a major campaign against the local NDM affiliates, leading to fierce clashes between the two sides in the area around Hamra, a small village near Kodok. Although a first attack by the SPLM-IO was reportedly repulsed, troops under Uliny's command later overran Okiech's headquarters in the area. In course of the fighting Gen. Gabriel Gatwech Chan (a.k.a. \\"Tanginye\\"), a senior NDM commander and personal friend of Okiech, was killed alongside his two sons and at least 20 militants. Okiech was wounded and barely escaped alive, while his remaining forces mostly scattered. John Uliny's men continued to pursue him, and eventually cornered Okiech at Thoroji, in northern Upper Nile near the border to Sudan. There, they killed him and 27 of his bodyguards in a shootout on 7 January 2017. The SPLM-IO went on to claim that with this victory, Okiech's forces were completely destroyed. Although elements of the NDM remained active in the Upper Nile region, the deaths of Okiech and Gabriel Tang permanently reduced the NDM's ability to expand in the area. Upper Nile thus remained dominated by the SPLM-IO.

Origin Provisions similar to s. 210 of the UK Companies Act 1948 were first introduced into Canadian law through the 1975 passage of the Canada Business Corporations Act. It incorporated recommendations made in 1962 by the UK Jenkins Committee on Company Law for removing the linkage of the remedy with that of winding-up and for broadening its scope.; 1971 draft s. 19.04 shown at Most provinces later adopted similar provisions. Scope Canadian legislation (both federally and in all provinces) provides for a broad approach to the oppression remedy (). In Peoples Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise, the Supreme Court of Canada noted: In the CBCA, s. 241 states: A \\"complainant\\" is deemed to be a current or former registered security holder, a current or former director or officer, the Director appointed under the CBCA, or \\"any other person who, in the discretion of a court, is a proper person to make an application under this Part.\\" In that regard, it can include a creditor of the corporation (but not every creditor will qualify), as well as a trustee appointed under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act or (in some circumstances), discussing and a monitor appointed under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.Essar Global, par. 36-37 As in the United Kingdom, oppressive conduct is not restricted to that committed by corporations. In the case of corporate directors, the Supreme Court of Canada in 2017 held that they can be held personally liable for such conduct, but only where: #the oppression remedy request is a fair way of dealing with the situation; #any order made under s. 241(3) should go no further than necessary to rectify the oppression; and #any such order may serve only to vindicate the reasonable expectations of security holders, creditors, directors or officers in their capacity as corporate stakeholders; but #director liability cannot be a surrogate for other forms of statutory or common law relief, particularly where such other relief may be more fitting in the circumstances., discussing Jurisprudence In BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that, in assessing a claim of oppression, a court must answer two questions:BCE Inc., par. 68 :* Does the evidence support the reasonable expectation asserted by the claimant? and :* Does the evidence establish that the reasonable expectation was violated by conduct falling within the terms ‚Äúoppression‚Äù, ‚Äúunfair prejudice‚Äù or ‚Äúunfair disregard‚Äù of a relevant interest? Where conflicting interests arise, it falls to the directors of the corporation to resolve them in accordance with their fiduciary duty.BCE Inc., par. 81-84 This is defined as a \\"tripartite fiduciary duty\\", composed of (1) an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains two component duties ‚Äî (2) a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and (3) a procedural duty of \\"fair treatment\\" for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the \\"best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen\\". Following BCE, the Court of Appeal of British Columbia noted that \\"breach of fiduciary duty ... 'may assist in characterizing particular conduct as tending as well to be 'oppressive', 'unfair', or 'prejudicial'\\". More recently, scholarly literature has clarified the connection between the oppression remedy and the fiduciary duty in Canadian law: Under the business judgment rule, deference should be accorded to the business decisions of directors acting in good faith in performing the functions they were elected to perform.BCE Inc., par. 99-100 Extent of application Applications to the Court have been successful where: #there was lack of a valid corporate purpose for the transaction; #the corporation and its controlling shareholders failed to take reasonable steps to simulate an arm's length transaction; #there was lack of good faith on the part of the corporation's directors; #there was discrimination among shareholders which benefited the majority to the exclusion of the minority; #there was a lack of adequate and appropriate disclosure of material information to minority shareholders; and #there was a plan to eliminate a minority shareholder. The types of behaviour that such actions encompass have included the diversion of corporate profits, the personal use of such profits by a controlling shareholder, the exclusion of the applicant from the corporation's operations, and changing the proportionate holdings by different shareholders. The remedy can extend to a wide variety of scenarios: :* It can be potentially used by any stakeholder to deal with any type of unfair conduct by a corporation :* It can cover an affiliate not incorporated under the same Act, discussing :* It has been used to enforce unpaid judgments against the corporation's directors, where the corporation had been subject to asset stripping :* It has also been used in conjunction with other remedies including the threatened winding up of a company by the court in order to resolve shareholder disputes in closely held companies., discussing :* The Crown has employed the oppression remedy in its status as a creditor under the Income Tax Act, in order to set aside dividend payments that rendered a corporation unable to pay its tax liability.R. v. Sands Motor Hotel Ltd, (1984) 36 Sask. R. 45 (Q.B.) :* Where a company has made excessive salary payments to a controlling shareholder, a judgment creditor has been permitted to be a complainant. :* A wrongfully dismissed employee can make a claim in order to thwart a corporation from conducting asset stripping in order to make itself judgment proof.Tavares v. Deskin Inc., [1993] O.J. No. 195 (Gen. Div.) :* Where representations have been made by officers of a parent corporation to an officer of a subsidiary about the terms of a stock option plan, such representations may create a reasonable expectation and give rise to an oppression remedy complaint if they are subsequently breached., discussing Premier Tech lt√©e c. Dollo, 2015 QCCA 1159 (9 July 2015) :* Where a controlling shareholder engaged in asset stripping in breach of his fiduciary duty to the corporation, an order was made for his removal as a director and officer, the mandatory redemption of the shares he controlled and of a shareholder loan due to him, and his removal as a trustee from a trust controlling other shares in the corporation., discussing The court's discretion is not unlimited, as the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador observed in 2003: :* The result of the exercise of the discretion contained in subsection 371(3)of NLCA, equivalent to CBCA, s. 241(3) must be the rectification of the oppressive conduct. If it has some other result the remedy would be one which is not authorized by law. :* Any rectification of a matter complained of can only be made with respect to the person‚Äôs interest as a shareholder, creditor, director or officer. :* Persons who are shareholders, officers and directors of companies may have other personal interests which are intimately connected to a transaction. However, it is only their interests as shareholder, officer or director as such which are protected by section 371 of the Act.NLCA The provisions of that section cannot be used to protect or to advance directly or indirectly their other personal interests. :* The law is clear that when determining whether there has been oppression of a minority shareholder, the court must determine what the reasonable expectations of that person were according to the arrangements which existed between the principals. :* They must be expectations which could be said to have been, or ought to have been, considered as part of the compact of the shareholders. :* The determination of reasonable expectations will also[...] have an important bearing upon the decision as to what is a just remedy in a particular case. :* The remedy must not be unjust to the others involved. Comparison with derivative actions Oppression claims are separate from derivative actions, but the two are not mutually exclusive. However, a derivative action claim can only be instituted by leave of the court, as it is brought by a complainant to sue on behalf of the corporation for a wrong done to the corporation, and any successful claim is binding on all shareholders. This is in contrast to the oppression remedy claim, where a complainant sues on behalf of himself for a wrong he suffers personally as a result of corporate conduct., discussing In 2015, the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed an oppression remedy claim, because the claimant was only seeking recovery of funds for the benefit of the corporation. As a result of the discussion within the judgment, the following general principles can be drawn for determining which remedy is more appropriate: #To claim oppression, a plaintiff must plead that they suffered personal harm distinct from that suffered by the corporation itself. #The focus of the oppression remedy is on the effects of the impugned conduct on the complainant, not on the corporation. #If the relief sought is for the benefit of the corporation, then the action will most likely have to be brought as a derivative action, and leave will be required. #The causes of action overlap where the corporation is small and closely held, and where the impugned conduct directly affects the complainant in a way that differs from the effects on other shareholders. In such cases, a claim may be brought either as a derivative action or a claim for oppression.

Life and work Sarah Read Adamson was born in Schuylkill Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, on 11 March 1829. She attended a Quaker school in Philadelphia as a child. Her uncle, Dr. Hiram Corson, initially opposed her desire to become a doctor, but eventually agreed to tutor her and later allowed her to study in his office before applying to medical school. After being denied entry to many medical colleges, Dolley became one of four women admitted to the Central Medical College, in Rochester, New York, and received her M.D. in 1851. She became the first woman intern in America at Blockley Almshouse in Philadelphia. She interned for a year before marrying one of the professors at Central Medical College, Dr. Lester Dolley, in 1852 and returning to Rochester where they ran a private practice together until his death in 1827. They had two children together, Loilyn and Charles Sumner, although only her son survived to adulthood, as Loilyn died of pneumonia as the age of 4. She continued her education by attending clinics in the Necker- Enfants Malades Hospital () in Paris from 1869 to 1870, as well as clinics in Prague and Vienna in1875. She temporarily worked as a professor of obstetrics from 1873 to 1874 at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and after Dolley returned to private practice in Rochester. She made efforts to help women get hired in hospital positions that they could not previously obtain, knowing how much she had benefitted from the experiences of her internship. In 1886 she was one of a group of women who founded of a clinic for the medical and surgical care of needy women and children, naming it the Provident Dispensary Association, and Dolley became its first president. The same group also founded the Practitioners Society, which in 1906 was re-named the Blackwell Society. The Women's Medical Society of the State of New York was launched by the Blackwell Society, also with Dolley as the president. She helped to organize a chapter of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in 1893. Dolley also made endeavors to help her community, co-founding the Rochester chapter of the American Red Cross. She was politically active in advocating for women's suffrage, and in the 1872 presidential election attempted to register and vote. She created a reputation for herself in her community of being a good doctor, even among her male colleagues, which was unusual of a woman physician in her time.

It is situated abount 11 km east of Singaraja. The village of Jagaraga is known historically as the place where the Dutch colonial government witnesses puputan or Balinese mass-suicide following their military attack on the kingdom of Bali in 1849. Pura Dalem Segara Madhu is known for its intensive wall decoration typical of northern Balinese architecture and for its unique western-influenced relief e.g. motifs of early 20th-century airplanes and automobiles. History The inner courtyard of Pura Dalem Segara Madhu in the early 20th century. The establishment of Pura Dalem Segara Madhu was estimated in the 12th century by Raja Sri Aji Jayaraga. During the Dutch intervention of Bali in 1849, the entire palace and temple complex were destroyed by the Dutch military. The rebuilt of the pura began in 1865, the building that still stands today. The pura was designed as a combination of Pura Prajapati and Pura Dalem, each dedicated to Durga and Shiva. The combination of both temples is possible because the deities are still one family. Northern Balinese style Typical of northern Balinese temple, Pura Dalem Segara Madhu is carved more ornately than its southern counterpart. Pura Dalem Jagaraga is carved with depictions of foliage, flowers, nagas, and human figures; a type of carvings that can be found in other northern Balinese pura e.g. Pura Beji Sangsit. Pura Dalem Segara Madhu is one of a few temples in Bali with carvings that depict the western world. Carvings in the perimeter wall of the temple feature unusual 20th-century figures e.g. carving of an airplane falling into the sea, carving of a ship attacked by a sea monster, and carving of an early 20th-century automobile. The carvings depicting the western world can also be found in other northern Balinese pura e.g. Pura Meduwe Karang and Pura Beji Sangsit, indicating contact with the western world in northern Bali. The Dutch colonial government entered Bali through the north. This entry is followed with several conflicts between the Dutch colonial government and the Balinese kingdom. In the mid-19th-century, the Dutch government conducted a series of campaigns to impose its colonial rule on the kingdom of Bali. The last campaign occurred two times in the early 20th-century which caused the death of 1000 Balinese civilians and the raze of a kingdom. The massacre shocked the West where the disproportion between the offense and harshness of the punitive actions was pointed out. Image of the Netherlands as a benevolent and responsible colonial power was seriously affected as a consequence. The Netherlands, also under criticism for their policies in Java, Sumatra and the eastern island, decided to make amends, and announced the establishment of an \\"Ethical policy\\". As a consequence, the Dutch in Bali turned students and protectors of Balinese culture and endeavored to preserve it in addition to their initial modernization role. Efforts were made at preserving Bali culture and at making it a \\"living museum\\" of classical culture, and in 1914, Bali was opened to tourism. Temple compound Pura Dalem Segara Madhu is a pura dalem, a type of pura dedicated to Shiva, the Hindu God of death and destruction. Pura dalem is associated with death rituals, and so decorated with sculptures of monstrous nature e.g. the statue of Batari Durga and carving of the demon Rangda. Pura Dalem Segara Madhu is divided into three areas: the outer sanctum of the temple (jaba pisan or nistaning mandala), the middle sanctum (jaba tengah or madya mandala), and the inner main sanctum (jero or utamaning mandala). The outer sanctum or jaba pisan is located right beside the main street of the village, basically, it is the street itself. Access to the middle sanctum is provided by a paduraksa gate carved with intricately in northern Balinese style. The paduraksa features monstrous Bhoma head on top of the portal. Beyond the paduraksa gate is the middle sanctum or jaba tengah. The middle sanctum is where several Balinese pavilions (bale) i.e. bale jeroan (\\"food pavilion\\") used to prepare cooking for offering and bale gong (\\"gong pavilion\\") to keep and perform the gamelan orchestra are situated. The innermost sanctum or jero is the most sacred courtyard of the temple. The area contains several shrines dedicated to the deities e.g. bale pegat, bale pelig, gedong dalem, padmasana, gedong Prajapati (the main shrine of Prajapati or Durga), Sapta petala, and bale piasan.

Documents stored and archived in TNA are invaluable to researchers working on post-independence Tamil Nadu or British-era Madras Presidency. In addition to British India records, TNA also houses a substantial collection of Dutch East India Company records from the late- seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and volumes relating to various southern Princely States. History =Record keeping in Madras= In 1672 William Langhorne the Governor of Madras presidency insisted on keeping records on all government transactions and its preservation for future. These records were initially stored in council room at Fort St. George which is the present day Secretariat-Assembly complex. His successor Streynsham Master also continued this tradition of record keeping. Due to increasing volume of records storage of records were scattered across various departments. It was in 1805 Lord William Bentinck, then Governor of Madras presidency ordered the centralization of all Secretariat records which were scattered in the various Departments of the Secretariat and appointed a Record Keeper and supporting staff to index, look after and to issue records promptly on requisition from various departments for reference. Muthiah, the principal native servant in the Political and Military Department, was appointed Record Keeper. In 1823 the records were moved into several rooms on the first floor of the Secretariat. Later on, the office was shifted to the \\"Pillar-godown\\", and in 1888 it moved to the ground floor of the Secretariat building. Due to the increasing number of records in 1909 the government decided to establish an independent record department. =Construction= When a new location was being considered for relocating the records office, one of the suggested location was the government bungalow called Grassmere. There was a debate among the officials if Grassmere should be used to house the Medical and Sanitation Department who were also eyeing the same property for its own office. But the sewage farm next door (now the Mayor Radhakrishnan Stadium) had several officials questioning the wisdom of this move. This debate lasted for two years before it was decided that the building was more suited for the archives. P. Loganatha Mudaliar was given the contract to rebuild Grassmere to make it suitable for its new function as the archives. It cost 2.25 lakh for the reconstruction of Grassmere to make it suitable for the new Archives building. An additional 1.25 lakh was spent on stacks and furniture. This Indo-Saracenic building was built with open spaces for future expansion and constructed to provide maximum protection to the records. The construction was completed and opened for operation in October 1909. The administrative block and six record stacks were constructed in 1909. The seventh stack was added in 1929 and the eighth and ninth were added in 1938. Further additions to the building such as the present Stationery section and Preservation Section were made in 1978 and 1994 respectively. In 1999 a new building for housing the Archival Library was constructed. =Curator of records= The head of Madras Record Office is designated as curator. Upon its completion C M Schmidt, the Registrar of the Secretariat, was put in temporary charge till Prof Henry Dodwell of Presidency College and Teachers‚Äô College was appointed the first Curator in April 1911.

The motif is based on the German musical nomenclature, in which the note B naturalis named H and the B flat named B - the same as in the ominous BACH motif -, however the initials of the composer‚Äôs name appear partially in German and in Italian version, instead of Philipp as Filippo. History The C. F. E. BACH motif appears in an unpublished Fughetta in F major, the composer is C. Ph. E. Bach himself. The composition was found in the Brussels Conservavorium by the Hungarian musicologist, Katalin Koml√≥s in an unpublished manuscript, called Miscellanea Musica (B Bc 5895), which contains various compositional sketches, contrapunctal studies, thoroughbass exercises, modulation and chord progression schemes by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. This material contains a short five-part fughetta, written on the C. F. E. BACH motif, furthermore the BACH motif also appears in the composition in different transpositions. The volume is a handwriting of Michel, the copyist of C. Ph. E. Bach from Hamburg. The origin of the fughetta turns out from a letter of C. Ph. E. Bach to his friend from Greifswald, Johann Heinrich Grave, on April 28, 1784, in which C. Ph. E.

Biography  Waller was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1855. Her mother was Mary Doane Hallet of Cape Cod and her father was David Waller of Vermont. In 1867, Waller's father and only sibling died. This necessitated Waller being taken out of school to earn her own living. For the four years following this tragedy, her mother took the twelve year old Mary traveling around Europe, where she became fluent in German, French and Italian. Upon their return, Waller began teaching at an exclusive Boston finishing school, Mrs. Shaw's school, before leaving to take a teaching position at Brearley School in New York. Following this, Waller then founded her own school in Chicago, Miss Waller's School for Girls.  Writing career  Forced by ill health to give up her school, Waller wrote her first novel in 1902, The Little Citizen. She lived in Bethel, Vermont with her mother at a historic house called Gate of the Hills until 1918. Many of her novels were written in and set in Vermont. Her earliest works were her most successful. A Daughter of the Rich (1903), The Wood-Carver of 'Lympus (1904), and Sanna (1905) ran through more than a dozen editions each. The Wood-Carver of 'Lympus was a bestseller of the day while Through the Gates of the Netherlands received praise from critics: > One of the most delightful of the holiday books of travel is Miss Waller's > Through the Gates of the Netherlands. It is a thoroughly enjoyable record, > half story, half traveler's diary, of some memorable months spent in Holland > and the Netherlands.

The volume > would make an ideal holiday gift. Waller was a social Darwinist in outlook; seeing life as a competition in which the fittest succeed. However, this did not prevent her expressing sympathy with the downtrodden in her writings. Though she continued to write and publish works into her old age, the popularity of Waller's particular brand of fiction declined after World War One with the public and critics alike.

The building was built by Cosman Citroen in the 1920s. The building is one of the example of 20th century buildings designed in a tropical-conscious climate of Indonesia, the style is known as the New Indies Style. History Surabaya was already an official municipality (gemeente) since April 1, 1906, however, there is no official city hall for the new municipality. In 1916, the first sketch of a new City Hall for Surabaya was proposed by Cosman Citroen. The fact that Citroen has just arrived in Surabaya from the Netherlands in 1915 and in such a short time received a prestigious project indicated his good business relationship in the colonial Dutch East Indies. His first proposal for the new City Hall was located at Stadstuin (now Pasar Besar, in front of Tugu Pahlawan). In 1920, a decision was made to move the City Hall into Ketabang, a new district to the east of the Kali Mas which had been purchased by the municipality of Surabaya with government support. One of the reasons for the chosen of this location is because of its relative \\"emptiness\\" as a new district, which allowed a large plan to be implemented. This new plot of land is a large rectangular-shaped land bounded by the Djimertoweg (now Jalan Jimerto) to the north, the Sedapmalamweg (Jalan Sedap Malam) to the east, the Ondomohenweg (now Jalan Walikota Mustajab) to the south, and the Ketabang Besar (the avenue Jaksa Agung Suprapto) to the west. The district of Ketabang is connected with the older districts of Surabaya on the west bank of the river with two bridges. The new design of the City Hall in Ketabang was proposed by Cosman Citroen in 1925 and construction had to commence. The original plan shows four masses of buildings located in the cardinal direction surrounding a central square- shaped courtyard. Because of funding issues, the rear north-side building is the only part of the complex that was realized. Several issues regarding the economic misconduct at the time of crisis (which started in 1921) are several reasons why construction of the City Hall took a long course. During the long period of its construction, the funding for several parts of the new building was donated by several companies. For example, the furniture was donated by the General Dutch East Indies Electricity Company ANIEM. Citroen also designed the furniture. The opening of the new town hall took place in November 1927. Architecture and interior design The building was designed by Cosman Citroen, a Dutch Indies architect who also designed the Headquarter office of the Dutch East Indies Railway Company in Semarang (now Lawang Sewu). Construction of the building was done by Hollandsche Beton Mij. The building is wide and long. On the ground floor are the central business administration, the constituency chamber, department heads and the population registration department. On the upper floor in the middle the boardroom and left and right there is the room for the secretary, waiting rooms, department of municipal affairs and the archive. The building is 19 meters in width and 102 meters in length. From the original plan of 1916/1917, only the rear building was realized. The unfinished side wings and front wing building is now a large park in front of the building that now stands. The overall look of Surabaya City Hall is similar with Cubism, with highly contrasting shadows emphasized by the cubic forms on the facade. Surabaya City Hall was designed with consideration on the tropical climate of Indonesia, a design movement which influenced many buildings in the early 20th-century Netherlands East Indies. This popular new modern movement of architecture is known as the New Indies Style. Among characteristics of New Indies Style apparent in the Surabaya City Hall are the two-layered roofs which allow light and ventilation to flow into the interior through the space between the roofs. The building is surrounded by galleries, a feature which protects the interior of the building from the direct sun and water from the frequent tropical rainfalls typical of the tropics. Generous opening in the windows and walls also allows cross ventilation into the interior of the building. The building is mainly constructed of reinforced concrete, while the roof frame is made of steel. The interior is designed in 20th-century modern style heavily influenced with Dutch interior design movement e.g. the Amsterdam School and De Stijl. Various private individuals as well as companies contributed to the new establishment. Some furniture in the boardroom was donated by ANIEM electrical company. The boards in the mayor's office was donated by Sam Liem Kongsi. J.J. Zeidel donated a marble plaque in the hallway. Other contributors for the building were W.J.

She was captured when the Germans found her in a house from which clandestine radio messages were being sent. The information she gave led to the collapse of the network. She was later executed. Early years Rita Arnould was born in Frankfurt am Main to a Jewish family. She studied philosophy at Frankfurt am Main University, where she became the companion of Isidor Springer. He convinced her to become a Communist activist. In 1933 the couple moved to Brussels after Hitler had seized power since it was now dangerous in Germany to be either a Jew or Communist. Soon after reaching Brussels, she married a M. Arnould, a well-to-do Dutch textile salesman who was over twice her age, and settled into a domestic routine. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940. Rita's husband died soon after, leaving her with no money. She asked Isidor Springer to help. He was now making a good living selling diamonds and had a Belgian wife. Springer established her as his mistress at 101 Rue des Atr√©bates, where she worked as a housekeeper and courier for two agents who called themselves Carlos Alamo and Anna Verlinden. Capture The Germans detected radio transmissions from the house and a group led by Abwehr Captain Harry Piepe raided it in the small hours of the night of 12‚Äì13 December 1941. A man burst from the house but was caught and brought back. Inside the house, they found Rita, a woman agent, and a radio transmitter that was still warm. The woman was trying to burn enciphered messages, which the Germans recovered. The man was a radio operator named Anton Danilov, probably an alias of David Kamy. The Germans found a hidden room holding the material and equipment needed to produce forged documents, including blank passports, forms, inks and rubber stamps. Rita was terrified and told Captain Piepe what she knew. There were two passports with pictures which Rita identified as the head of all the Soviet espionage groups in Europe and his deputy in Belgium. The next day Mikail Makarov, who had been using the alias Carlos Alamo and was also a radio operator, came to the house and was also arrested. Aftermath Rita was 27 years old when she was arrested. Her information led to the discovery of others in the network and the collapse of the Rote Kapelle (Red Orchestra) network. During later interrogations Rita gave information that led to the German discovery of the Soviet agents' cypher. The Germans had omitted to take the books that were lying on the table, and a member of the spy network later removed them. When the Germans realized that the cypher was a book code, they coached Rita to remember the titles. With difficulty, she recalled the title Le Miracle du Professeur Wolmar, an obscure 1910 novel. This turned out to be the key. The book was not located until May 1942, when a copy was found in an antiquarian bookshop in Paris. Using it, about 120 intercepted messages from June 1941 onward were deciphered, including a message with the addresses of key Soviet agents in Berlin. Springer managed to avoid arrest and moved to Lyon in France, where he resumed his clandestine work. The head of the ring, Victor Guryevitch, also escaped. The woman taken with Rita was a Polish Jew named Zofia Pozna≈Ñska (Zosia) who had been trained in cyphering in Moscow before the war. She refused to collaborate and killed herself in St. Gilles Prison in Brussels on 29 September 1942. Makarov was tried before the Kriegsgerichtshof (the army's military court), sentenced to death and executed in 1942 at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. David Kamy was tried by a German military court in Belgium, sentenced to death and executed at Fort Breendonk on 30 April 1943. Arnould was taken to Berlin-Moabit prison. She was tried by the Berlin Kriegsgerichtshof in April 1943, sentenced to death, and executed on 20 August 1943 at Pl√∂tzensee Prison.

She was the founder of the Prisoners' Aid Society of Rhode Island, did much work with the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, and was the first president of the Rhode Island Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). She was also largely instrumental in making prohibition a constitutional enactment in Rhode Island in 1886. Due to her efforts, police matrons were secured for the station houses of large cities. Barney is best remembered as the WCTU's National Superintendent of Prison, Jail, Police, and Almshouse Visitation. Her wide sympathies and ministries earned her the title of \\"The Prisoner's Friend.\\" Early years Susan Hunt Hammond was born November 24, 1834 in Pawtucket, Massachusetts, the daughter of Dr. John Allen and Elisa (Brown) Hammond. Her father, Dr. Hammond, was a prominent physician. She was a contributor to the local press at the age of thirteen. Career It was her desire to become a foreign missionary, but, owing to ill-health and the strong opposition of friends, she reluctantly did not pursue this career. Her first public speaking was done in the interest of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She was one of the founders of the Prisoners' Aid Society of Rhode Island, and was always interested in prison and jail work. She was the first president of the Rhode Island WCTU, a position she held for several years. She went on to become a national evangelist. The enactment of constitutional prohibition in Rhode Island in 1886 was largely due to her executive ability. She had much to do with securing police matrons for the station-houses of large cities, and was an able platform speaker. Barney's sermons received high commendation by pastors, and her services were sought by nearly all denominations. She contributed a chapter on the \\"Care of the Criminal\\" to Woman's Work in America (New York City, 1891). Personal life She married Joseph K. Barney, of Providence, Rhode Island, in 1854, and thereafter resided in that city, with the exception of several years spent on the Pacific Coast. They had two children: Walter Hammond (born 1855) and Charles Alfred (born 1858). Barney died April 29, 1922 at Providence.

Discovered by one of the generals under whom she had fought, she was approved for a pension which was paid over the last decade of her life. Largely forgotten until the turn of the 21st century, when Argentine historians began including the contributions of black Argentines, she is now widely recognized for her contributions to the independence of the nation. The Argentine legislature declared 8 November as the National Day of Afro- Argentines and African Culture in 2013. Early life Mar√≠a Remedios del Valle was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and was listed in her military records as a parda, a term applied to African slaves' descendants. Testimony given in the 1828 Diario de Sesiones, a Congressional record, states that she was \\"sixty or more years old\\", placing her birth around 1768. Career Mar√≠a Remedios del Valle, with her husband and two sons, accompanied the Army of the North, which had been deployed by the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata to liberate Peru and Upper Peru, now Bolivia from Spain. This was the first military expedition to the interior and left Buenos Aires on 20 June 1810 under the command of captain of the Volante Artillery Battalion's 6th Company. Initially, del Valle was among the rabonas, or camp followers, who were recruited from the urban poor and rural peasantry to follow the troops and provide cooking and nursing services, carry arms and munitions, and gather intelligence which could assist the military. The army arrived in December 1810 at Potos√≠. Del Valle's participation in the battles of \\"Huaqui (20 June 1811) and the army's subsequent retreat to Jujuy, the exodus from Jujuy (23 August 1812), the victories at Tucum√°n (24 September 1812) and Salta (20 February 1813), and the defeats at Vilcapugio (1 October 1813) and Ayohuma (14 November 1813)\\" were recorded. Prior to the Battle of Tucum√°n, she sought permission from General Manuel Belgrano to tend the troops who had fallen in the front lines. Belgrano denied permission, on the grounds that women were not suited for duty at the front. Ignoring his order, del Valle proceeded with her plan and was later recognized by Belgrano with the rank of captain in the army. During the Battle of Ayohuma, del Valle wounded when she was shot by the enemy and taken as prisoner by the Spanish forces. During her captivity, she assisted several prisoners in escapes and was sentenced to be publicly flogged for nine consecutive days. She eventually escaped and returned to the army to assist with the battlefield wounded, remaining through the end of the conflict. Little is known of del Valle's history after the war ended in 1818, until around 1826. It is known that her husband and two children were killed in the conflicts, though which specific actions is unclear. On 23 October 1826, she applied for compensation for services rendered by her family during the Argentine War of Independence, but her claim was denied. Poor health and age limited her ability to provide for herself, and del Valle began begging for food at convents in the city. General Juan Jos√© Viamonte discovered her in the streets in a deplorable condition and petitioned the legislature on her behalf to provide her with a pension. With the support of other generals, such as Anzo√°tegui, who was then a captain; General Eustaquio D√≠az V√©lez, who testified she served as a guerrilla fighter, as well as provider of aid to the wounded; and Colonel Hip√≥lito Videla, who confirmed del Valle had been wounded and imprisoned at Ayohuma. An examination of del Valle's body confirmed that she had six scars evidencing she had been wounded by bullets and swords. Tom√°s de Anchorena, a member of the legislature also presented a case in her defense and the legislature agreed grant del Valle a salary for the rank of captain of the infantry. This was later elevated to compensation as a sergeant major of the cavalry. Del Valle was placed in inactive status, with full salary corresponding to her rank in 1830. She continued receiving a pension until her death in 1847, though records show that between 1836 and 1847, payment was made to Remedios Rosas. Death and legacy A note dated 8 November 1847 in the military archives pension records indicates Rosas had died. She first appeared in a history book in Argentina in the early 1930s, when Carlos Ibarguren published her story and in 1944 Buenos Aires named a street in her honor. However, she was largely forgotten until the beginning of the 21st century, when Afro-Argentines, activists and scholars began to include the history of people who had been left out of the historiography of the country because of deliberate discrimination based on gender and race. She is now widely recognized for her contributions and numerous publications have retold her story. Since 2013, 8 November is celebrated in her honor, as the National Day of Afro-Argentines and African Culture.

The Independent called her \\"a pioneering counsellor and one of the leading figures in fighting for equal rights for the disabled and the elderly\\". Early life Wendy Elsa Greengross was born on 29 April 1925, at 10 St Mary's Road, Golders Green, London, the daughter of Morris Philip Greengross, born Moisze Fiszel Gringross (1892‚Äì1970), a manufacturing jeweller, and his wife, Miriam Greengross, n√©e Abrahamson (1899/1900‚Äì1968). Her father was mayor of Holborn from 1960 to 1961, and her brother Sir Alan Greengross (born 1929) was a leading Conservative member of the Greater London Council. Greengross was educated at South Hampstead High School from 1936 until she was evacuated to Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, followed by University College Hospital, where she qualified as a doctor in 1949, and in 1952 won a Fulbright Scholarship to the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. Career Together with her husband, Greengross ran a large general practice in Tottenham, London. Opened in 1955, it was one of the UK's first group practices. She particularly promoted family planning, and they were the country's first GP practice to have a dedicated marriage guidance. Greengross worked as a GP for 35 years. Greengross received counsellor training from the Marriage Guidance Council (now Relate), and would go on to become its Chief Medical Adviser. In the late 1960s, Greengross started teaching pastoral care and counselling at Leo Baeck College. Greengross went into broadcasting in the early 1970s, joining the BBC Radio 4 counselling programme If You Think You've Got Problems, which ran for nearly eight years. She had her own television show on BBC1 in 1973, Let's Talk it Over. From 1972 to 1976, Greengross was an agony aunt for The Sun, but \\"felt the letters passed to her were more about titillation than education\\". Greengross wrote Jewish and Homosexual, published in 1980, by the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain, which \\"led the way towards equality within the British Reform and Liberal movements\\". Greengross published several sex education books, particularly focused on more marginalised groups, such as Sex and the Handicapped Child in 1980. Greengross was a founding member and chair of the organisation Sexual Problems of Disabled People (SPOD), and a founder of the Residential Care Consortium.

It occurs in tributaries of Ozark-draining tributaries of the Missouri, and Mississippi rivers in southern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas. Its preferred habitat is rocky and sandy pools and runs of headwaters, creeks and small rivers.  Taxonomy   Description  The bleeding shiner has an olive brown back with a broad dark stripe along its midline. It has metallic sides and has two black stripes that are separated with a golden stripe. One of these black strips extends to the tip of the snout, while another less obvious black stripe parallels it. The gill opening has a crescent-bar shape and the fish has a silvery white underside. Breeding males have bright red markings on their head, body, and fins, and the rest of their markings appear darker. The bleeding shiner has an average total length of about 4 in (10 cm) and has a maximum total length of 4.75 in (12 cm).  Distribution and habitat  The bleeding shiner occurs in many rivers of the Ozark Plateau, including the St. Francis, Black, Little, Meramec, Osage, Big Piney, and Gasconade Rivers. Bleeding shiners prefer clear, gravel-bottomed streams and rivers. They have (very rarely) been found in streams with beds of mud, however.  Diet  The bleeding shiner feeds upon insects and small invertebrates that can be found upon the water's surface or that are being carried by the current. It is thought that the bleeding shiner searches for food primarily by sight because of its large eyes.  Behaviors  = Reproduction = Spawning usually occurs over gravel nests and pits that have been made by other fish, namely those of other minnows. Anywhere from a few to a hundred gather in these locations while spawning.  Life history  Bleeding shiners rarely live through three summers.  Human interest   Conservation  Trends over the last three generations (10 years) indicates that the population may be slowly declining. This is uncertain, however. It is abundant throughout its range. Bleeding shiners have been known to invade some areas, such as the Clear Creek system.

Lewellen (September 16, 1930 ‚Äì November 25, 2017) was an American politician. He was elected and served on the Little Rock City Board of Directors, the Pulaski County Quorum Court and in the Arkansas State Legislature representing the district in which he resided. He was a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2004, when he was succeeded by his wife, Wilhelmina Lewellen who served until 2010. John Lewellen is the only Arkansas official to have been elected and represented his district on the city, county and state level. John Marshall Lewellen was born September 16, 1930 in Forrest City, Arkansas. He was the 11th of 13 children born to Cornelius and Jesse Lewellen. He attended Dansby Elementary School and professed a hope in Christ at an early age at Taylor Chapel which was named after his grandfather, Taylor Dansby. He graduated from Lincoln High School in Forrest City and served in the U.S. Air Force 1951-1955 during the Korean War. The first of his family to attend college, John attended Arkansas AM&N; (now UAPB) where he met Wilhelmina Epps. They were married on November 25, 1956. Their first daughter, Ivie Rochelle, was born while they pursued and completed their college education. After graduating from AM&N; in 1958 with a bachelor's degree in agriculture, John Lewellen and his family moved to the Altheimer/Hermitage area, where he worked as a high school teacher and principal. The family moved to Little Rock after the birth of their second daughter, Cornelia Ann, where John began his 30-year career in state government as a state probation officer, state rehabilitation counselor and later as a contractor officer for the Arkansas Department of Human Services. Over the past 54 years, John Lewellen was a highly respected member of the Little Rock community and his neighborhood. He gave back to the community by buying and rehabbing apartments and homes, ultimately purchasing a senior citizen apartment building, which he named ConIvie Gardens, after his two daughters. He co-founded the Wright Avenue Neighborhood Association, one of the strongest neighborhood groups in the city. To many, he was \\"Mr. Lew,\\" the \\"go-to guy\\" for advice and guidance, and a mentor to youths, especially young men. Many would spend Saturdays with him doing yard work, washing cars, or repairs at his rental properties, while he taught them the importance of a strong work ethic and being a strong black man. John Lewellen wanted to do even more for the community and decided to run for public office. He was elected to the Little Rock City Board in 1991 and the Pulaski County Quorum Court in 1996. In 1999, he was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives and represented District 34 for six years. During his tenure he co-founded the Democratic Black Caucus, chaired the Children and Youth subcommittee, and worked for growth of minority- and women-owned businesses among other issues. He was the primary and lead sponsor of House Bill 1923 - AN ACT TO CREATE THE MOSAIC TEMPLARS OF AMERICA CENTER FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. This legislation generated more than $5 million for restoring the Mosaic Templars Culture Center, a museum of the Dept. of Arkansas Heritage that houses the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame as well as a collection of African American artifacts. The Mosaic Templars Museum is part of the Arkansas Black Heritage Tour and is Arkansas's only state-funded museum of African American History. John Lewellen received numerous awards for outstanding and dedicated service from organizations, including the Arkansas Municipal League, National Association of Minority Contractors, the Arkansas Police and Bar associations, among others. His term ended in 2004 due to term limits. Having seen Wilhelmina emerge as a leader in her own right after serving as both Basileus of Beta Pi Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, Inc. and as the president of the local chapter of The Links, Inc., John Lewellen encouraged his wife Wilhelmina to run for his soon to be vacated position. Wilhelmina reluctantly agreed though she did not have public office experience. Wilhelmina won with an overwhelming 84 percent of the vote and continued his legacy and created one of her own holding the seat until she was also term limited in 2010. Rep. John Lewellen and Rep. Wilhelmina Lewellen John Lewellen is the only elected official in the State of Arkansas to serve on the City, County and State levels of government. John Lewellen was a life member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the NAACP, Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, and served on a number of boards and committees. He was an outdoorsman who loved fishing, animals, and nature.

Description Lepidium heterophyllum is similar in form to native Lepidium campestre and especially at the early seedling stage, both have been misidentified in Belgium . It is a perennial, which can grow between tall. The hirsute (or hairy) stems, are often branched from the base,Simon Harrap It has grey-green foliage, that has narrowly triangular, variably toothed, stem leaves which cling to the stem with long pointed auricles. The stem leaves can grow up to 50 mm long. The basal leaves are different, they have long stalks and are strap-shape, or oblong-elliptic. They can often have 1-3 pairs of small but broad sided lobes, they quickly fade at blooming time but can re- grow as the plant goes to seed. It blooms between May and August, or between May and September, in the UK, and between May and July in the US. The very small flowers ( long,) are on short stalks at right angles to the stem, the plant can have several crowded, parallel-sided flower spikes. The white spatulate (spoon-shaped) petals, are as long as the oblong sepals. and 6 styles, which have a notch. The flower also has stamens with violet anthers. After it has flowered, it produces a fruit capsule, which is oval and smooth, with a distinctive beak at the top. They are ( long, and inside are ovoid dark brown seeds. Phytochemistry It was found after a phylogenetic analysis of the DNA of many species of 'Lepidium', that Lepidium heterophyllum, Lepidium hirtum, Lepidium campestre, and Lepidium perfoliatum formed a monophyletic group. It has been used in experiments growing in soils high in copper content, to determine if the plant could be used to help clean contaminated soils. Irena Twardowska, Herbert E. Allen and Max M. H√§ggblom (Editors) Taxonomy It was published and described by George Bentham in 'Cat. Pl. Pyr√©n√©es' on page 95 in 1826. It has one known subspecies; Lepidium heterophyllum subsp. rifanum (Emb. & Maire) J.M.Monts. The specific epithet heterophyllum, refers to the Greek for 'different leaves'. It has a few common names including 'Smith's cress' and 'Smith's pepperwort', this is due to the plant once being named Lepidium smithii, by Sir William Hooker, in honour of the botanist, Sir James Edward Smith. This name is now regarded as a synonym. It is also known in the US, as 'purple antherfield pepperwort'Tim Johnson Joseph M. DiTomaso and Evelyn A. Healy The pepperwort name came from plant looking like a 'pepperwort' (Lepidium campestre or other Lepidium species). Distribution and habitat Plant seen in Sierra Madrona, Spain Lepidium heterophyllum is native to temperate areas of western Europe. =Range= It is found in Europe within Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. It is also widely naturalised in other parts of Europe such as Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, Norway and Sweden. As well as Canada, Chile and the United States. It has been recorded as found in British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York (state), Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington (state). The records from Maine and Massachusetts are based on old plant collections, and it is not fully known if the plant has become established as part of the weedy flora of those states. In Belgium, it was first recorded in fallow fields between 1881 and 1884 in Egenhoven, and then in 1886 near Bouillon. Later, it was observed in Stokt (in the province of Limburg, Netherlands), in the 19th century. Recently, in 2004 and 2005, it was recorded on gravelly riverbanks of River Maas (which rises in France and flowing through Belgium and the Netherlands to the North Sea). =Habitat= It is found growing in acidic soils, on hillsides, in shingle, railway ballast and embankments, and, occasionally, in arable fields. It is normally found at altitudes of above sea level. Conservation Populations of Lepidium heterophyllum currently are stable, but it seems to be decreasing in S.E. England.

Dempsey took the name of Sister Mary Joseph and taught for a dozen years before she returned to Rochester to help staff the newly built Saint Marys Hospital in 1890. Sister Mary Joseph was trained by the only experienced nurse in the city and became the hospital's head nurse and surgical assistant to Dr. William J.

She studied English at University College, London, graduating with first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. Daniel Jones, one of her lecturers, \\"encouraged her to study the phonetics of south-east Asian languages\\". Academic career In 1936, Henderson became an adviser on the pronunciation of names in foreign languages at the BBC. In 1937, she was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Phonetics of University College, London. With the outbreak of the Second World War, she joined the civil service: she worked in the Ministry of Economic Warfare as a temporary assistant principal between 1939 and 1941. When Japan entered the war in late 1941, the British government realised that there was an urgent need for language training. She therefore returned to academia and was appointed a lecturer in phonetics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London in 1942. The Department of Phonetics and Linguistics, to which she was assigned, spent the rest of the war teaching Japanese and other Far Eastern languages to military personnel. In 1946, the Department of South- East Asia and the Islands was re-established and expanded. Lecturers appointed to this department were also members of the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics where they were supervised by Henderson. She was promoted to senior lecturer in Phonetics in 1946. She was appointed Reader in Phonetics in 1953. In 1954, she was a visiting professor at Rangoon University, and undertook fieldwork in the Bwe Karen and Chin languages. From 1960 to 1966, she was the acting head of the Department of South-East Asia and the Islands. She was made Professor of Phonetics in 1964; this was made into an established chair two years later. She was head of the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics between 1966 and 1970. She retired in 1982 and was appointed Emeritus Professor by the University of London. Outside of her university positions, Henderson held a number of positions. She was treasurer of the Philological Society from 1965 or 1966 to 1974.

It was designed by William Templeton Johnson and opened in 1932. It hosts a variety of performances for the college and outside groups. History The auditorium was built as a joint project of the Claremont Colleges consortium. It was sponsored by the parents of Mabel Shaw Bridges, a student in Pomona's class of 1908 who died of illness in her junior year, and H.H. Timken, president of the Timken Roller Bearing Company. From its completion until the opening of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in 1964, it was arguably the premier destination of choice for prominent visitors to Southern California. It was also the largest collegiate auditorium on the West Coast, with a capacity nearly twice that of Pomona and equal to that of the city of Claremont. The Los Angeles Philharmonic frequently performed there. The auditorium was renovated from 1975 to 1977 for seismic retrofitting and cosmetic repairs. In 2007, control was transferred from the consortium to Pomona individually. Pomona's 2015 master plan classifies Big Bridges as a \\"building notable for establishing the distinctive context\\" of the college, and describes it as a symbol of the college's regional civic engagement. A 2015 impact report from the college identifies it as eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, although the college has not yet applied for it to be listed. John Neiuber, writing for the Claremont Courier in 2017, expressed surprise it is not listed. Architecture Big Bridges viewed from across Marston Quadrangle Big Bridges is the primary visual anchor point for the east side of Marston Quadrangle, the center of Pomona's campus. It was constructed in a Renaissance Revival style modeled after northern Italy, and incorporates Art Deco elements. It has large porticos on its front and sides with arched columns, and a large formally adorned foyer inside the main entrance. The building's frieze features the names of five eminent composers; it was the target of a famous 1975 prank in which the one for Fr√©d√©ric Chopin was replaced with one honoring Frank Zappa. The auditorium has a capacity of 2,494 people, including a 500-seat cantilevered balcony. There are no supporting columns, allowing all seats to have unobstructed views of the proscenium. The basement has a historical exhibit. =Ceiling= A mural by Italian-American artist John B. Smeraldi covers the parabolic domed ceiling of the auditorium. It depicts a variety of constellations in silver and gold leaf against a pale blue background. Usage An orientation session for the Pomona class of 2020 in Big Bridges Big Bridges hosts a variety of events and performances for the college, including orientation sessions, concerts, and guest speaker lectures.

Willenz also initiated the effort to build the Women in Military Service for America Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 2011. Early life and education Willenz was born in Brooklyn on December 17, 1924, and grew up there. Her father, Benjamin Friedenberg, worked as a civil engineer and her mother, Sara Friedenberg (n√©e Horowitz), was a housewife. After graduating from high school at the age of 16, she went on to study at Brooklyn College, before transferring to the University of Michigan. There, she earned first a bachelor's degree in Chemistry in 1945, and then a master's degree in Philosophy two years later. She subsequently pursued doctoral studies in Philosophy (ABD) at The New School for Social Research in New York. It was during her studies there that she first met Eric Willenz, a fellow student. They married in 1951, and had two daughters (Pam and Nicole). The couple later divorced in 1968.  Career  Following graduation, Willenz worked at a variety of jobs before joining the AVC. She wrote a column for the Stars and Stripes newspaper, taught at Montgomery College in Takoma Park, Maryland, and directed the research program at the United States Department of Labor's Special Project on Employment of Women Veterans. She became the executive director of the AVC in 1965, a position she held until the committee's dissolution in 2003. When she joined the AVC she was the first and only female head of a veteran's organization. After finding that many minority veterans had been discharged \\"less-than-honorably\\" for minor offenses, Willenz began campaigning to raise awareness of the inequities in the system. She developed the first legal aid project for veterans with discharge-related problems. As a result of her advocacy, thousands of Vietnam War veterans eventually had their discharges upgraded to \\"general\\" or \\"honorable\\" status. Willenz was the first woman to head the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Task Force on Military/Veterans Affairs, and the first to chair a Presidential Subcommittee on Disabled Veterans. She was cited for \\"outstanding leadership\\" of the Subcommittee. She organized a conference on the Draft, which encouraged national debate and influenced policy direction. Willenz also advocated for the rights and recognition of women veterans. Her 1983 book, 'Women Veterans: America's Forgotten Heroines, documented the lives of several women who had served in the military and the impact it had on their lives. It also called attention to the inequality between men's and women's benefits, and the government's neglect of women veterans. Largely in response to the book, Congress held its first hearings on women veterans and the Veterans Administration established a Women Veterans Advisory Committee. Willenz also initiated efforts to create a national memorial to women veterans. Her work in the AVC eventually led to the building of the Women in Military Service for America Memorial. For 22 years, Willenz chaired the World Veterans Federation's Committee on Women, which championed women's rights in peacetime as well as wartime. She represented the Federation at the United Nations, calling the attention of various U.N. agencies to the problems of women in armed conflict. She is credited with helping to increase women's influence in the international arena, as evidenced in United Nations Security Council resolutions \\"that now seek to include women in peacemaking and peacekeeping activities as well as post-conflict reconstruction strategies.\\" Death Willenz died on May 3, 2020, in Bethesda, Maryland. She was 95, and had suffered a heart attack after undergoing emergency hip surgery.

Williams) (10 August 1821 ‚Äì 15 April 1874) was an American woman who was the first proponent for Memorial Day, an annual holiday to decorate soldiers‚Äô graves.  Antebellum years  Mary Ann Howard was born in Baldwin County, Georgia. She was the daughter of Major Jack Howard. She married Charles J. Williams in 1847 when he returned from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Mary Ann had presented his regiment with a flag made the ladies of the city when they left in 1846. According to the 1860 census of Columbus, Georgia, they had four children Charles Howard, Caroline, Mary and Lila. Charles pursued his career as a lawyer and Mary Ann supported a number of civic projects. Charles entered politics and represented Muscogee County in the Georgia House in 1859-1860 where he rose to be speaker of the Georgia House prior to the Civil War.  Civil War years  Charles left Columbus to command Fort Pulaski on the Georgia coast but gave up that command in order to lead troops in Virginia. Mary Ann joined the Soldiers Aid Society to support the local soldiers in the war effort. He returned to Columbus in February 1862 in very ill health. He died within a few days and was buried in the City Cemetery, now known as Linwood. Mary Ann continued her activities in the Soldiers‚Äô Aid Society and inaugurated the Soldiers‚Äô Home in Columbus. She was said to have visited her husband's grave frequently and was inspired by her young daughter who wanted to decorate the other soldiers‚Äô graves with flowers as well. Marker on Second Ave in Columbus, GA explaining Mrs. Williams' role as Secretary of the Ladies' Memorial Association in initiating Memorial Day (It wasn't called \\"Confederate\\" Memorial Day until after Logan inaugurated the northern version of the holiday).  Post war years  In early 1866, the Soldiers‚Äô Aid Society was reorganized as the Ladies Memorial Association at the Tyler home on the corner of 4th ave and 14th street. The building is long gone but a monument marks the spot. The officers elected were Mrs. Robert Carter, president; Mrs. Robert. A. Ware, vice president; Mrs. J. M. McAllister, second vice president, Mrs. M. A. Patten, treasurer and Mrs. Williams was elected Secretary of the Association. As secretary, Mrs. Williams was tasked with writing a letter to the ladies of the South to inaugurate an annual holiday to decorate the soldiers‚Äô graves. It is for this letter that she is best remembered. She was also Trustee and Chairman of the Orphan Asylum and Trustee of the Georgia Memorial Association along with Mary Jane Green. She remained active in these organizations until the end of her life.  The letter  The letter Mrs. Williams wrote to her two local newspapers was a request to the ladies of the South to set one day aside each year to decorate the soldiers‚Äô graves. It was long on flowery language and was considered a ‚Äúthrilling appeal.‚Äù She did not sign her own name but closed the letter with ‚ÄúSouthern Women.‚Äù It was picked up by newspapers across the South. In The Genesis of the Memorial Day Holiday in America, Bellware and Gardiner were the first to provide evidence that her letter was published in cities outside of Columbus, Georgia. The External Links below contain pages from fourteen of the newspapers in Georgia,Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Virginia, West Virginia, South Carolina and North Carolina where the letter appeared. The neglected grave of the founder of Memorial Day, Mary Ann Williams (left) and her husband Col. Charles J. Williams (right) in Linwood Cemetery, Columbus, Georgia.  Notice outside the South  News of the impending observance spread to cities in the North. Bellware and Gardiner were able to show that Mrs. Williams‚Äô story had gone nationwide. Mrs. Williams‚Äô plan was documented with brief notices in such papers as the New York Times, Hartford Courant, Philadelphia Daily Age and Boston American Traveler. New York Times, April 12, 1866, announcing preparations for the first Memorial Day. Holiday observed The new holiday was observed throughout the state of Georgia on April 26, 1866 in Atlanta, Augusta, Savannah, Macon, Columbus and numerous other towns. Across the south, it was observed in Montgomery, AL; Memphis, TN, Jackson, MS, Louisville, KY, New Orleans, LA and others. In some locations, most notably Virginia, the tributes were observed on different dates. In Richmond, they decorated on May 31. In Winchester, they decorated on June 6 and in Petersburg, they decorated at Blandford Cemetery on June 9. Due to a typographical error, the holiday was also observed a day early in at least one location. The Memphis Appeal apologized for the error in their April 25, 1866 edition. The ladies of Columbus, MS reportedly observed the holiday on April 25, 1866 and also decorated the graves of Union soldiers, as well. Not all the observances were as noble. In Augusta, Georgia, officials did not allow African-Americans to decorate the graves of Union soldiers which resulted in widespread negative press reports.Memphis Appeal, April 25, 1866, apologizes for publishing the wrong date for first Memorial Day observance The news was so widespread that it would have been difficult to have missed the coverage. One person who took notice was General John A. Logan, the future commander-in- chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). As he was the person responsible for the observance of the first northern Memorial Day on May 30, 1868, it has always been a question of when Logan learned about the southern tradition he was adopting. Bellware and Gardiner were the first to point out Logan knew about the southern holiday from the beginning, giving a speech on July 4, 1866 at Salem, IL that mentioned the southern observances two years before adopting the holiday in the north. Bellows Falls Times, July 20, 1866, A portion of Logan's July 4, 1866 speech discussing the first Memorial Day observances in the South and alluding to the Augusta, Georgia decoration in particular.  Death  Mrs. Williams died on April 15, 1874, less than two weeks before the ninth observance of Memorial Day in Columbus. Her funeral was held on April 16 and was attended by the Columbus Guards. Ten days later, at the end of the Memorial Day wreath laying ceremonies, the battalion of the Columbus and City Light Guards stacked arms. Then, each soldier proceeded to Mrs. Williams‚Äô grave and one-by-one laid a rose on her grave as they passed. Hoaxes and False Claims Over two dozen places claim to have originated the Memorial Day holiday. The University of Mississippi's Center for Civil War Research under the direction of Dr. John R. Neff maintains a web page listing several of the \\"originators.\\" The text on that page states that \\"So widespread was the impulse to honor the war dead that observances occurred spontaneously in several locations...\\" and \\"...these numerous early ceremonies tend to blur the origins of this now national tradition.\\" In reality, it appears that the origin of the holiday was blurred by the impulse to take credit where credit was not due. While many of the places on this list, like Columbus, GA, Columbus, MS, Memphis, TN and Richmond, VA were simply decorating at the request of Mrs. Williams. Several of the stories are clearly fraudulent claims made by people seeking some sort of credit or glory for themselves or their town. The following people and places have been used to take credit from Mrs. Williams by making fraudulent claims for events that never happened or mischaracterizing events that had no impact on the inauguration of the holiday: *Kingston, GA *Lizzie Rutherford of Columbus, GA *Woodlawn Cemetery, Carbondale, IL *Sue Landon Vaughan formerly of Jackson, MS *Henry C.

Early Years  Bertram Hill was born on 27 April 1881 in the Bedminster district of Bristol, England to William Hill, a prominent Bristol businessman who was head of the British clothing firm of Wathen Gardiner & Co. His brother Stanley Frederick Hill was awarded the Military Cross in WWI. Another brother William John Hill joined their father in Wathen Gardner, and his nephew Patrick Seager Hill became managing director in 1965 of the Wathen Gardiner subsidiary Bristol Uniforms. Although Bertram's family was immersed in the Bristol clothing industry, he chose a different career path, and graduating from the Merchant Venturer‚Äôs Technical College in Bristol, immigrated as a young man to the United States, where he worked for a short time on the east coast.  Career  Settling in 1905 in Dallas, Texas , Hill worked for the next several years as a draftsman and consultant for various architectural firms. His first major projects were the Adolphus Hotel and the Dallas City Hall (circa 1914), the basement of which is where Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, was gunned down in 1963 by Jack Ruby. Hill opened his own office in 1921 in Dallas, and designed many private residences from the 1920s through the 1940s in the Swiss Avenue, Gaston Avenue, Lakewood and Highland Park areas. He also worked on commercial properties, apartments, several churches, and the original Dallas and Lakewood Country Club buildings.  Legacy  Hill is especially known for his traditional, grand, Georgian-style homes, many examples of which can be seen in the Swiss Avenue Historic District in East Dallas. However, he also designed a number of more modern-looking residential and commercial properties described as \\"googie\\" or \\"coffee house modern\\". Many Dallas residences designed by Hill survive, quite a few of which are registered with the Dallas Historic Preservation League.

After breaking FPAQ regulations for the sale of her product, choosing to directly export her syrup to New Brunswick, she was threatened with fines and jail time, but refused to stop her actions. Grenier took her case to the Quebec Court of Appeal and finally the Supreme Court of Canada, but was ultimately unsuccessful.  Industry background  A jug of maple syrup from Quebec, Canada. Quebec has approximately 7000 maple syrup producers, and the provincial industry supplies at least 70% of the world's maple syrup, worth over CA$600 million. The Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers (FPAQ) exerts control over virtually all aspects of the maple syrup industry in Quebec, backed by government legislation. FPAQ assigns limits on the amount of syrup producers can produce and sell directly to outside buyers, and uses its power as a collective to sell syrup to wholesalers. Quebec maple syrup producers are obligated to sell the vast majority of their syrup directly to FPAQ, except for the small portions they can sell to visitors out of their own sugar shacks. Any producers selling their syrup in supermarkets have a 12-cents-per-pound commission taken off the top by FPAQ. In 2002, FPAQ established further regulations, assigning strict production quotas to producers and keeping all surplus syrup in its \\"Global Strategic Reserve\\" warehouses. The FPAQ pays producers in gradual installments for their syrup, and as a result producers sometimes wait years to receive full payment.  Biography  Grenier and her husband own a maple syrup farm in Sainte-Clotilde-de-Beauce. After owning and operating her maple syrup farm for several decades, unhappy with FPAQ regulations, in 2002 Grenier began selling her product in bulk directly to a buyer in New Brunswick, breaking the federation's rules on direct sales. She continued to do this for the next 12 years. In an effort to avoid the attention of the authorities, she and her family eventually resorted to loading barrels of maple syrup onto their truck under cover of darkness, driving across the provincial border before dawn. The police and FPAQ security staff visited her farm, but Grenier refused to return to the practice of selling her syrup to the federation. She was hit with a $500,000 fine. The FPAQ finally took her to court, resulting in Grenier being ordered to hand over her product. In 2013, federation employees came to Grenier's farm and seized her barrels of syrup. In 2014, a judge ruled that inspectors could enter Grenier's farm at any time to inspect her products. In January 2016, Grenier and a number of other dissatisfied producers took their case to the Quebec Court of Appeal, arguing that Quebec maple syrup producers should be able to sell their product independently to other provinces. In September, Grenier received support from Quebec MP Maxime Bernier, who called for an end to the federation's total control of the syrup industry. After the Quebec courts declined her appeal, Grenier took her case to the Supreme Court of Canada, starting a crowdfunding campaign to help cover expenses. Grenier's lawyer, Hans Mercier, told press that he was prepared to work on the case for free if necessary. In June 2017, the Supreme Court refused to hear Grenier's appeal. After three years of legal battles, Grenier had spent $150,000 on legal fees and was faced with over $300,000 in remaining fines from the FPAQ. She told press she was considering closing down her maple syrup farm at last.

Formulated by Thomas Kirkwood, the disposable soma theory explains that an organism only has a limited amount of resources or \\"soma\\" that it can allocate to its various cellular processes. Therefore, a greater investment in growth and reproduction would result in reduced investment in DNA repair maintenance, leading to increased cellular damage, shortened telomeres, accumulation of mutations, compromised stem cells, and ultimately, senescence. Although many models, both animal and human, have appeared to support this theory, parts of it are still controversial. Specifically, while the evolutionary trade-off between growth and aging has been well established, the relationship between reproduction and aging is still without scientific consensus, and the cellular mechanisms largely undiscovered.  Background and history  British biologist Thomas Kirkwood first proposed the disposable soma theory of aging in a 1977 Nature review article. The theory was inspired by Leslie Orgel's Error Catastrophe Theory of Aging, which was published fourteen years earlier, in 1963. Orgel believed that the process of aging arose due to mutations acquired during the replication process, and Kirkwood developed the disposable soma theory in order to mediate Orgel's work with evolutionary genetics. Principles The disposable soma theory of aging posits that there is a trade-off in resource allocation between somatic maintenance and reproductive investment. Too low an investment in self-repair would be evolutionarily unsound, as the organism would likely die before reproductive age. However, too high an investment in self-repair would also be evolutionarily unsound due to the fact that one's offspring would likely die before reproductive age. Therefore, there is a compromise and resources are partitioned accordingly. However, this compromise is thought to damage somatic repair systems, which can lead to progressive cellular damage and senescence. Repair costs can be categorized into three groups: (1) the costs of increased durability of nonrenewable parts; (2) the costs of maintenance involving cell renewal, and (3) the costs of intracellular maintenance. In a nutshell, aging and decline is essentially a trade-off for increased reproductive robustness in youth.  Mechanisms  IGF-1 pathway, which represses FOXO, thus preventing gene expression of longevity-inducing proteins. = Growth and somatic maintenance = Much research has been done on the antagonistic effects of increased growth on lifespan. Specifically, the hormone insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), binds to a cell receptor, leading to a phosphorylation cascade. This cascade results in kinases phosphorylating forkhead transcription factor (FOXO), deactivating it. Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to oxidative stress response, such as antioxidants, chaperones, and heat-shock proteins. Additionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the mTOR pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting S6K1, and also inhibits autophagy, a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products. Decline of autophagy causes neurodegeneration, protein aggregation and premature aging. Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters immune responses and stimulates cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors such as p16 and p21. This leads to alteration of the stem-cell niche and results in stem cell exhaustion, another theorized mechanism of aging. = Reproduction and somatic maintenance= While reproduction inhibits lifespan with regard to multicellular organisms, the precise mechanism responsible for this effect remains unclear. Although many models do illustrate an inverse relationship, and the theory makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, the cellular mechanisms have yet to be explored. However, with regards to cellular replication, the progressive shortening of telomeres is a mechanism which limits the amount of generations of a single cell may undergo. Furthermore, in unicellular organisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) in mother cells (but not daughter cells) upon every subsequent division is an identifiable type of DNA damage that is associated with replication. These ERCs accumulate over time and eventually trigger replicative senescence and death of the mother cell. Evidence =Growth and aging= There is a large body of evidence indicating the negative effects of growth on longevity across many species. As a general rule, individuals of a smaller size generally live longer than larger individuals of the same species.  Animal models  In dwarf models of mice, such Snell or Ames mice, mutations have arisen, either rendering them incapable of producing IGF-1 or unable to have adequate receptors for IGF-1 uptake. Furthermore, mice injected with growth hormone have been shown to have progressive weight loss, roughing of the coat, curvature of the spine, enlargement of the organs, kidney lesions and increased cancer risk. This effect is also seen in different breeds of dogs, where smaller breeds of dogs typically live significantly longer compared to their larger counterparts. Selectively bred for their small size, smaller dog breeds like the Chihuahua (average lifespan of 15‚Äì20 years) have the B/B genotype for the IGF-1 haplotype, reducing the amount of IGF-1 produced. Conversely, large dogs like the Great Dane (average lifespan of 6‚Äì8 years) are homozygous for the IGF-1 I allele, which increases the amount of IGF-1 production. Human models Initially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of growth hormone to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various biomarkers implicated in aging, such as decreased muscle mass, bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue. However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased mortality rate. Recent genomic studies have confirmed that the genes involved in growth hormone uptake and signaling are largely conserved across a plethora of species, such as yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, mice and humans. These studies have also shown that individuals with Laron syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in dwarfism due to defects in growth hormone receptors, have increased lifespan. Additionally, these individuals have much lower incidences of age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. Lastly, human centenarians around the world are disproportionately of short stature, and have low levels of IGF-1. =Reproduction and aging= Numerous studies have found that lifespan is inversely correlated with both the total amount of offspring birthed, as well as the age at which females first gives birth, also known as primiparity. Additionally, it has been found that reproduction is a costly mechanism that alters the metabolism of fat. Lipids invested in reproduction would be unable to be allocated to support mechanisms involved in somatic maintenance.  Animal models  The disposable soma theory has been consistent with the majority of animal models. It was found in numerous animal studies that castration or genetic deformities of reproduction organs was correlated with increased lifespan. Moreover, in red squirrels, it was found that females with an early primiparity achieved the highest immediate and lifetime reproductive success. However, it was also found that these same individuals had a decreased median and maximum lifespan. Specifically squirrels who mated earlier had a 22.4% rate of mortality until two years of age compared to a 16.5% rate of mortality in late breeders. In addition, these squirrels had an average maximum lifespan of 1035 days compared to an average maximum lifespan of 1245 days for squirrels that bred later. In another study, researchers selectively bred fruit flies over three years to develop two different strains, an early-reproducing strain and a late-reproducing strain. The late- reproducing line had a significantly longer lifespan than the early- reproducing line. Even more telling was that when the researchers introduced a mutation in the ovarian-associated gene ovoD1, resulting in defective oogenesis, the differences in lifespan between the two lines disappeared. The researchers in this case concluded that \\"aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life\\". Prominent aging researcher Steven Austad also performed a large-scale ecological study on the coast of Georgia in 1993. Austad isolated two opossum populations, one from the predator-infested mainland and one from the predator-absent nearby island of Sapelo. According to the disposable soma theory, a genetically isolated population subject to low environmentally-induced mortality would evolve delayed reproduction and aging. This is because without the pressure of predation, it would be evolutionarily advantageous to allocate more resources to somatic maintenance than reproduction, as early offspring mortality would be low. As predicted, even after controlling for predation, the isolated population had a longer lifespan, delayed primiparity, and reduced aging biomarkers such as tail collagen cross-linking. Human models  In general, only a few studies exist in human models. It was found that castrated men live longer than their fertile counterparts. Further studies found that in British women, primiparity was earliest in women who died early and latest in women who died at the oldest ages. Furthermore, increased number of children birthed was associated with a decreased lifespan. A final study found that female centenarians were more likely to have children in later life compared average, especially past the age of 40. The researchers discovered that 19.2% of female centenarians had their first child after the age of 40, compared to 5.5% of the rest of the female population. = Relationship between cell damage and aging= The naked mole rat has a disproportionately long life of 30 years through efficient cellular repair mechanisms. There are numerous studies that support cellular damage, often due to a lack of somatic maintenance mechanisms, as a primary determinant for aging, and these studies have given rise to the free radical theory of aging and the DNA damage theory of aging. One study found that the cells of short-living rodents in vitro show much greater mutation rates and a general lack of genome surveillance compared to human cells and are far more susceptible to oxidative stress. Other studies have been conducted on the naked mole rat, a rodent species with remarkable longevity (30 years), capable of outliving the brown rat (3 years) by ten- fold. Additionally, almost no incidence of cancer has ever been detected in naked mole rats. Nearly all of the differences found between these two organisms, which are otherwise rather genetically similar, was in somatic maintenance. Naked mole rats were found to have higher levels of superoxide dismutase, a reactive oxygen species clearing antioxidant. In addition, naked mole rats had higher levels of base excision repair, DNA damage response signaling, homologous recombination repair, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and non-homologous end joining. In fact, many of these processes were near or exceeded human levels. Proteins from naked mole rats were also more resistant to oxidation, misfolding, ubiquitination, and had increased translational fidelity. Further studies have been conducted on patients with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a condition that leads to premature aging. Patients with HGPS typically age about seven times faster than average and usually succumb to the disease in their early teens. Patients with HGPS have cellular defects, specifically in the lamin proteins, which regulate the organization of the lamina and nuclear envelope for mitosis. Lastly, as mentioned previously, it has been found that the suppression of autophagy is associated with reduced lifespan, while stimulation is associated with extended lifespan. Activated in times of caloric restriction, autophagy is a process that prevents cellular damage through clearance and recycling of damaged proteins and organelles.  Criticism One of the main weaknesses of the disposable soma theory is that it does not postulate any specific cellular mechanisms to which an organism shifts energy to somatic repair over reproduction. Instead, it only offers an evolutionary perspective on why aging may occur due to reproduction. Therefore, parts of it are rather limited outside of the field of evolutionary biology. =Caloric restriction= self-repair during caloric restriction. Critics have pointed out the supposed inconsistencies of the disposable soma theory due to the observed effects of caloric restriction, which is correlated with increased lifespan. Although it activates autophagy, according to classical disposable soma principles, with less caloric intake, there would less total energy to be distributed towards somatic maintenance, and decreased lifespan would be observed (or at least the positive autophagic effects would be balanced out). However, Kirkwood, alongside his collaborator Darryl P. Shanley, assert that caloric restriction triggers an adaptive mechanism which causes the organism to shift a higher proportion of resources to somatic maintenance, away from reproduction. This theory is supported by multiple studies, which show that caloric restriction typically results in impaired fertility, but leave an otherwise healthy organism. Evolutionarily, an organism would want to delay reproduction to when resources were more plentiful. During a resource-barren period, it would evolutionarily unwise to invest resources in progeny that would be unlikely to survive in famine. Mechanistically, the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) is upregulated during low-nutrient periods. SIRT-1 increases insulin sensitivity, decreases the amount of inflammatory cytokines, stimulates autophagy, and activates FOXO, the aforementioned protein involved in activating stress response genes. SIRT-1 is also found to result in decreased fertility. In additional to differential partitioning of energy allocation during caloric restriction, less caloric intake would result in less metabolic waste in the forms of free radicals like hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, which damage important cellular components, particularly mitochondria. Elevated levels of free radicals in mice has been correlated with neurodegeneration, myocardial injury, severe anemia, and premature death. =The grandmother hypothesis= Another primary criticism of the disposable soma theory is that it fails to account for why women tend to live longer than their male counterparts. Afterall, females invest significantly more resources into reproduction and according to the classical disposable soma principles, this would compromise energy diverted to somatic maintenance. However, this can be reconciled with the grandmother hypothesis. The Grandmother Hypothesis states that menopause comes about into older women in order to restrict the time of reproduction as a protective mechanism. This would allow women to live longer and increase the amount of care they could provide to their grandchildren, increasing their evolutionary fitness. And so, although women do invest a greater proportion of resources into reproduction during their fertile years, their overall reproductive period is significantly shorter than men, who are able of reproduction during and even beyond middle age. Additionally, males invest more resources into growth, and have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 compared to females, which is correlated with decreased lifespan. Other variables such as increased testosterone levels in males are not accounted for. Increased testosterone is often associated with reckless behaviour, which may lead to a high accidental death rate. = Contradicting models = A few contradicting animal models weaken the validity of the disposable soma theory. This includes studies done on the aforementioned naked mole rats. In these studies, it was found that reproductive naked mole rats actually show significantly increased lifespans compared to non-reproductive individuals, which contradicts the principles of disposable soma. However, although these naked mole rats are mammalian, they are highly atypical in terms of aging studies and may not serve as the best model for humans. For example, naked mole rats have a disproportionately high longevity quotient and live in eusocial societies, where breeding is usually designated to a queen. = Sex biases and environment = The disposable soma theory is tested disproportionately on female organisms for the relationship between reproduction and aging, as females carry a greater burden in reproduction. Additionally, for the relationship between growth and aging, studies are disproportionately conducted on males, to minimize the hormonal fluctuations that occur with menstrual cycling. Lastly, genetic and environmental factors, rather than reproductive patterns, may explain the variations in human lifespan. For example, studies have shown that poorer individuals, to whom nutritious food and medical care is less accessible, typically have higher birth rates and earlier primiparity.

History  On 22 August 1956, the Day of the Miner, several test runs were conducted on the originally only long track, but regular use began only on 1 May 1957. Initially, the locomotives were moved to the other end of the train in the dual track Pionerskaja railway station, but at the Komsomolskaja railway station there was a balloon loop. Both stations were equipped with wooden station buildings. That of Komsomolskaja is preserved, but that of Pionerskaja existed only to late 1960s or early 1970s. Now, there is only the small brick building of the station master. In the era of steam locomotives the trains consisted of thrr light wooden carriages with a length of less than seven or eight metres each. These were replaced by metal body carriages, probably in the 1960s, and later by three Polish Pafawag carriages. Around 1990 the five local carriages were replaced by longer Polish carriages, and the platforms had to be extended accordingly. Modern light signals Arman railway station, 2006 During the renovation of the track, the signal system was also modernised. In the 1990s Komsomolskaja railway station was renamed to Arman, and Pionerskaja railway station, which got relocated at that time, got the name Drushba. At the end of the 1990s, Karaganda Children's Railway was threatened by failure due to financial problems, as many former pioneer railways in Kazachstan. In winter 2000 the governmental railways Kazakhstan Temir Zholy informed the management of the children's railway about the pending termination of further payments. When the management of Ispat-Karmet (–ò—Å–ø–∞—Ç-–ö–∞—Ä–º–µ—Ç), the successor of the Karagandaer smelter (–ö–∞—Ä–∞–≥–∞–Ω–¥–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –º–µ—Ç–∞–ª–ª—É—Ä–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ–º–±–∏–Ω–∞—Ç), which had their own locomotives and carriages, heard about the financial problems, they requested to re-animate the children's railway. Surprisingly, the management of the government railways subsequently provided the required funds for repairs and maintenance of the track, infrastructure and rolling stock of the children's railway. Season 2001 ran without problems. To increase the profit, a wedding train was introduced similar to that of the Qostanai Children's Railway (–ö—É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–π –î–ñ–î). Even so, the children's railway was not profitable. THus the management of the government railways ceased their payemnts. In November 2001 most of the personnel of the children's railway was made redundant, and the director was given a position as security guard. The government railways Kazakhstan Temir Zholy sold the children's railway to a subsidiary, which tried to sell it a year later, potentially even for scrap. In summer 2004 the local aksakal requested that the akimat should re-instate the children's railway. After lengthy arguments, the government railways were persuaded, to repair the children's railway once again. On 1 August 2004 it was re-opened for the public. End of December 2004 it was transferred free of charge to the Office of Parks of Culture and Recreation. Since then, the budget of the provincial government allocates a budget for its maintenance. Arman railway station, 2016 In summer 2004 the railway was operated by adults, because it was not possible, to find enough sufficiently qualified youths, after years of stand-still. The provincial government has difficulties to maintain the railway without the support of the government railway. Consequently, the children's railway did not operate in 2006 and the first half of 2007. During this time, the track was damaged by inappropriate construction work, when new pipelines were laid through the park, but in July 2007 both the track and the rolling stock had been repaired, and the service was re-instated by adults, although without the obligation to train youths to become future railway employees.  Rolling stock  Initially the trains were moved by the steam locomotive WP1-805-27, which had previously probably belonged to an industrial railway, according to the unusual number. In or before 1961 the children's railway receive the diesel locomotive TU2-115. The diesel locomotive TU2-037 was acquired in the early 1970s. It had to be overhauled in 1987‚Äì1989, and at that time the children's railway got the diesel locomotive TU2-111 from the Qostanai Children's Railway, which is still being used. In addition there are three wooden carriages and at least three metal carriages of an unknown manufacturer as well as three Polish Pafawag carriages.

He was born as the eldest of five children of Anton Greinz and his wife Maria (nee Kapferer). His younger brothers Hugo (1873‚Äì1946) and Hermann (1879‚Äì1938) were also writers. In 1879 the family moved to Salzburg. his father had been transferred there.Iris Kathan, Christiane Oberthanner: Innsbruck. Ein literarischer Stadtf√ºhrer. Haymon-Verlag, Innsbruck 2009, , S. 224. In 1883 Rudolf Greinz laid on the k.k. State Gymnasium in Salzburg from the Matura. He then studied German language and literature, Classical Philology and art history at the Universities of Graz and Innsbruck. Due to illness, Greinz had to give up his intended scientific career. Thereupon decided for the writing profession. As a freelance writer he settled in Merano.Ferruccio Delle Cave, Bertrand Huber: Meran im Blickfeld deutscher Literatur. Eine Dokumentation von der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts bis zur Gegenwart (= Literarische Zeugnisse aus Tirol, Bd. 6). Verlagsanstalt Athesia, Bozen 1988, , S. 91. In Meran, Rudolf Greinz met Zoe Basevi, a native of a significant Jewish-British family, the daughter of a retired naval officer living there, a grandniece of the English statesman Benjamin Disraeli. They married in 1899.Eduard Widmoser: Greinz, Rudolf. In: Ders: S√ºdtirol A‚ÄìZ, Bd. 2: G‚ÄìKo. S√ºdtirol-Verlag, Innsbruck 1983, S. 114. In 1905 he moved with his family to Innsbruck. There he worked on the magazine Der F√∂hn, together with Richard Wilhelm Polifka, Rudolf Brix and Franz Kranewitter. His contributions, however, increasingly met with criticism and rejection of his fellow writers, which is why he relocated to Munich in 1911. There he worked under the pseudonym \\"Tuifelemaler Kassian Kluibensch√§del‚Äú at the magazine Jugend.Josef Fontana: Geschichte des Landes Tirol, Bd. 3: Die Zeit von 1848 bis 1918. Verlagsanstalt Athesia, Bozen 1987, , S. 390. In 1934 his wife Zoe died. Two years later, Rudolf Greinz moved to Ansitz Rosenegg in Aldrans, a village above Innsbruck. He acquired the \\"Villa Rosenegg\\" in 1926, but initially used it only as a summer resort.Ansitz Rosenegg, abgerufen am 28. November 2016. Numerous travels took him to poetry readings throughout the German-speaking world. In 1939 Greinz submitted his application for admission to the Reichsschrifttumskammer, which was retroactively granted on July 1, 1938.Stra√üennamen Wiens seit 1860 als ‚ÄûPolitische Erinnerungsorte‚Äú (PDF; 4,4 MB), Forschungsprojektendbericht, Wien, Juli 2013, S. 259. Rudolf Greinz died on his 76th birthday. His tomb is located in the cemetery in Ampass.Rudolf Heinrich Greinz im Portal Lexikon Literatur in Tirol.  Writings  The early work of Rudolf Greinz recalls Ludwig Thoma.Josef Nadler: Literaturgeschichte √ñsterreichs. Otto M√ºller, Salzburg 1951, S. 386. Greinz became known above all for his novels, especially for historical novels. Like Rudolf Greinz himself, many of his fictional characters are deeply religious. His relationship to the church , however, had always been ambivalent.Josef Feichtinger, Gerhard Riedmann: Begegnungen. Tiroler Literatur des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts. Texte und Kommentare. Verlagsanstalt Athesia, Bozen 1994, , S. 410. In his writings he held higher clerics before the following of Jesus not befitting lifestyle and the departure of the poor and simple people. Critical to the church is, for example, his 1915 published novel \\"√Ñbtissin Verena\\". Since 1912 his books have been published by Ludwig Staackmann in Leipzig. Alfred Staackmann, the publisher, was connected to Greinz as a friend and literary advisor. Almost every year, Greinz presented a new novel, a collection of short stories and/or a new stage play. In total, Greinz published 132 books in his lifetime, with new editions not counting. A contemporary, much-read literary leader called him \\"smug\\", but not completely incorrect - a \\"commoner, the poetry, peasant stories and popular dramas only from the sleeve\\". His books reached - in total - a million edition. His novel Allerseelen alone was sold more than 100,000 times. Greinz was especially outside of Austria, among his readers in Germany and the United States, as the typical representative of the native-connected, down-to-earth literature in Tyrol.Murray G.

He is known for his works on homogenization and Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory.  Life and career  Berlyand was born in Kharkov on September 20, 1957. His father, Viktor Berlyand, was a mechanical engineer, and his mother, Mayya Genkina, an electronics engineer. Upon his graduation in 1979 from the department of mathematics and mechanics at the National University of Kharkov, he began his doctoral studies at the same university and earned a Ph. D. in 1984. His Ph. D. thesis studied the homogenization of elasticity problems. He worked at the Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics in Moscow. In 1991 he moved to the United States and started working at Pennsylvania State University, where he has served as a full professor since 2003. He has held long-term visiting positions at Princeton University, the California Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences, Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories. His research has drawn support from the National Science Foundation(NSF),One of NSF-DMREF grants NIH/NIGMS,Berlyand's NIH/NSF grants the Applied Mathematics Program of the DOE Office of Sciences,One of the DOE grants BSF (the Bi-National Science Foundation USA-Israel)One of BSF gants and the NATO Science for Peace and Security Section. Berlyand has authored roughly 100 works on homogenization theory and PDE/variational problems in biology and material science. He has organized a number of professional conferences and serves as a co-director of the Center for Mathematics of Living and Mimetic Matter at Penn State University. He has supervised 17 graduate students and ten postdoctoral fellows.Berlyand on the site of the Sports Concussion Research Center at the Penn State UniversityBerlyand's personal page at the site of the Penn State University Research Drawing upon fundamental works in classical homogenization theory, Berlyand advanced the methods of homogenization in many versatile applications. He obtained mathematical results applicable to diverse scientific areas including biology, fluid mechanics, superconductivity, elasticity, and material science. His mathematical modeling explains striking experimental result in the collective swimming of bacteria.L. Berlyand, M. Tournus, A. Kirshtein, I. Aranson. Flexibility of bacterial flagella in external shear results in complex swimming trajectories, Journal of the Royal Society Interface 12 (102) (2014) His homogenization approach to multi-scale problems was transformed into a practical computational tool by introducing a concept of polyharmonic homogenization which led to a new type of multiscale finite elements.H.

Still, the political climate in Russia by this time had changed, and the magazine adopted a centrist, liberal stance, choosing not to conflict with authorities, even if Vasilevsky, its most active contributor, rarely missed an opportunity to fence with his conservative opponents, notably Mikhail Katkov and Prince Meshchersky. Among the authors whose work occasionally appeared in Strekoza, were Nikolai Leskov, Yakov Polonsky, Dmitry Grigorovich and Viktor Bilibin. It was in Strekoza that in 1879 (No. 51 issue) Anton Chekhov debuted with a piece called \\"The Mayor's Archeological Report\\" (–ê—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–∞–ø–æ—Ä—Ç –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ), followed in March 1880 (No.10 issue) by \\"The Don Landowner's Stepan Vladimirovich's Letter to His Learned Neighbor Dr. Friedrich\\" (better known under its shortened title \\"A Letter to a Learned Neighbor\\"). In all, ten Chekhov's stories appeared here in 1880, then two more in 1883-1884. In 1908 Strekoza folded. It was re-launched in 1915 by the publisher Isaak Bogelman, and lasted until 1918.

The website features reviews, interviews, and information about latest releases from bands based in Asia or for non-Asian bands performing in Asia. Unite Asia is based in Hong Kong and was founded in 2015 by Riz Farooqi of King Ly Chee.  History  Unite Asia was founded in 2015 by Riz Farooqi of Hong Kong based band King Ly Chee in order to showcase the many rock and metal bands across Asia. Frustrated with the lack of media coverage for Asian bands, Farooqi decided to launch his own website in order to create a platform to grow the punk, hardcore, and metal communities. The name of the website comes from the 2007 King Ly Chee song of the same name. The song was later re-recorded with seven vocalists from all over Asia and premiered on Unite Asia in 2015, the same year as the website's debut. In 2017, Unite Asia organized the Unite Asia Showcase which was a concert featuring six local Hong Kong bands who were releasing either an EP or album. A free CD featuring songs from each band was given out to the concertgoers.  Overview  The goal of the platform is to not only grow the local music scene in Hong Kong, but to also connect the community across the Asian continent. Similar to other music news websites such as Metal Sucks and Metal Injection, Unite Asia frequently uploads information about new releases, videos, and other news items related to the punk, hardcore, and metal scene. However, Unite Asia focuses entirely on the Asian music scene. The website gives smaller indie bands a platform to reach out to the community as anyone can submit news to the website. Since the underground music scene in Asia is not as developed as its counterparts in North America or Europe, many bands frequently have problems with tour promoters or concert venues. Unite Asia attempts to bring more transparency to the industry by hosting a database of tour promoters within Asia that have been screened and proven to be legitimate.

A family friend convinced her parents to play the last two games of the season with the under-10 boys and they were the only games they won that season. Due to lack of girl's youth teams in football, Tesoriero started playing basketball and netball. She represented the Mount Evelyn Netball Club and later played for the North East Blaze in the Victorian Netball League. In 2005, at the age of 18, Tesoriero started playing senior football at Yarra Valley Cougars. A year later she was selected to represent the Victorian state football team.

Her mother died when she was five years old and her father abandoned her, so she was raised by a guardian. One of the families for whom she worked as a teenager paid for her to attend a teacher training program at Knoxville College. Davis graduated, but she had always wanted to be a nurse, so she enrolled in the nursing program there. She was forced to leave by illness, but she enrolled at the Freedmen‚Äôs Hospital Training School for Nurses in Washington, D.C. in early 1910. After graduation, she worked as a private nurse and then enrolled in the Town and Country Nursing Service Course sponsored by the American Red Cross, the first black nurse to take the course. Other graduates of the course were automatically enrolled in the Army Nurse Corps Reserve, but Davis was not because of her race. However, she was enrolled on 2 July 1918, the first black nurse to be allowed to do so.

The estate property, totalling nearly , also includes Timber Island, just south of the promontory. It is accessed via Granite Point Road, which passes through the Biddeford unit of the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge, which now includes the Timber Point property. The built elements of the estate include its main house, garage, boathouse and bathhouse, and a number of other outbuildings. The main house is a 1-1/2 story Colonial Revival wood frame structure, which presents a broad facade to the southern vista of the promontory, and a projecting gabled entry section to the north. The interior is composed of a series of rooms, which interconnect without hallways. The property was purchased in 1929 by Louise Parsons Ewing, and was at the time a combination of woods and farmland. Her husband Charles was an architect active in New York City and Maine. He designed the main house and other aspects of the estate, and the couple entertained friends and family there, notably including the artist Rockwell Kent and writers Booth Tarkington and Kenneth Roberts.

Lister locomotive 29890 in 2015 The cut peat was transported in wooden slatted wagons to the peat packing shed, and would be loaded onto trains at the sidings next to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway just west of Lenzie station, and then onwards transported (see map). The brick foundations of the peat packing shed are still evident today. Remnants of the peat packing shed foundations in 2017 The following information appears on the East Dunbartonshire Council information board\\"East Dunbartonshire Council information board\\" at the site of the peat packing shed brick foundations: :Little is known of the early human history of the Lenzie Moss area. There is evidence, however, that the peat processing on the site dates from the 13th Century. A charter granted by King Alexander II of Scotland in 1226 to Cambuskenneth Abbey, Stirlingshire, allowed the Canons of the Abbey to remove peat from the Moss. This right was later enjoyed by the freemen of the burgh known as \\"Peat Lords\\". The growth of the use of peat after the Second World War saw large-scale extraction by Lenzie Peat Development Company. A private railway siding, west of Lenzie station, was built to transport the peat in wooden slatted wagons from the peat bog to the storage and despatch shed. From here it was transported onwards via Lenzie station. This activity was responsible for flattening the original dome shape of the raised bog and created the ditches and baulks which characterise much of the surface today. The company ceased operation in the 1960s. In 2009, under East Dunbartonshire Council, Lenzie Moss was established as a Local Nature Reserve. Today, these brick foundations are all that remain of the commercial peat processing plant.

Brazilian Zouk evolved from the partner dance known as the Lambada. As the Lambada music genre went out of fashion, Lambada dancers turned to Caribbean Zouk (from the francophone, Caribbean Islands) as their music of choice. It was this transition that birthed the dance known as Brazilian Zouk. The term \\"Brazilian Zouk\\" was adopted in order to distinguish the dance style from the musical genre \\"Caribbean Zouk\\". Nowadays the term \\"Zouk\\" is commonly used to refer to the \\"Brazilian Zouk\\" dance style. The most characteristic feature of Brazilian Zouk is the follower's upper body movements which are led out of axis by intricate leading and following techniques. Other features include body isolations, tilted turns and more recently counter-balance techniques. Brazilian Zouk is a dance with well defined basic steps and rhythmic patterns. The representation of these steps and rhythmic patterns varies depending on the substyle of Zouk. The overall plasticity of the movements and the range of musical genres it is danced to, make Brazilian Zouk a partner dance that caters to creativity and improvisation. Over time, Zouk dancers have experimented and incorporated other styles of music into Zouk, such as R'n'B, pop, hip hop and contemporary (amongst others). Styles As Brazilian Zouk made a name for itself in the dance community talented and influential dancers began to develop and explore to create more definitive styles, either by sheer development as a Zouk school, or by fusing Zouk with other dance styles such as Bachata, Argentinian Tango, Contact Improvisation or West Coast Swing. The perhaps two most popular branches of Brazilian Zouk now (2019) are Traditional (Rio) and Lamba. Currently several styles of Brazilian Zouk have evolved, and continue evolving since Zouk is now danced over the world. To name a few styles that are present among dance schools outside Brazil: *Traditional Zouk (or Rio-style Zouk) is a style of Brazilian Zouk that can be both linear and circular, and contains a set of elements or basic patterns that are known under a certain name (in Portuguese), like Viradinha or El√°stico. Notable dancers (but not limited to) within this style would be Adilio Porto, Renata Pen√ßanha, Jaime Aroxa. Other representatives are Freddy and Andressa Marinho (based in Finland) and Leo and Becky Neves (based in New Zealand), to mention a few. *Lamba Zouk (or Zouk lambada, or Porto Seguro style) has the closest connection to Lambada. It is characterized by constant, nonstop movement, unlike the Traditional style. Well known dancers of this style would be Ry'el and Jessica (based in New York) and their branch of Brazilian Zouk Lambada called \\"ZenZouk\\". Also noteworthy are Gilson Damasco, Olaya and Papagayo, all now based in Spain, to mention a few. *Mzouk is the only style originated outside of Brazil, but in Mallorca, Spain parallel to the other styles. Mzouk defines its basic steps and movements by nomenclature rather than preset patterns. This means that patterns can be defined as a sequence of specific movements. A representative couple is Daniel and Leticia Est√©vez. *Soulzouk regards itself as a philosophy of dance rather than style with focus on Biomechanics. Its goal is to dance with great comfort, especially in the followers, and with the least expenditure of energy as possible. His creator and one of his representatives is China Soulzouk. *Zouk Flow created by Arknjo 20 years ago at Rio de Janeiro, is a style influenced by urban culture. Uses synergy and natural movements of the body to create steps. *Neozouk is a style of basically circular movements and a philosophy about the energy management of these, developed by DJ, dancer, teacher and producer Mafie Zouker, from Rio de Janeiro and her partner Ruanita Santos, now based in Holland. In addition and to these styles many professional Zouk dancers are constantly creating and naming sub-styles under the influence of contemporary dance, hip-hop dance and others.

It was released in 1993, near the end of the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa. The album was released in South Africa on cassette and CD by One World Entertainment, an imprint of Tusk Music. Mango Groove recorded music videos for three songs from the album: \\"Another Country\\", \\"Nice to See You\\", and \\"Tropical Rain\\". Historical context Another Country was released several months before South Africa's landmark 1994 general election, the first democratic election in the country's history.Viljoen (2002), pp. 330 The album was the band's artistic contribution to South Africa's crossover period from the apartheid regime to a new government.Viljoen (2002), pp. 329‚Äì30 The impression of Lucia Burger‚Äîa critic with Afrikaans newspaper Beeld at the time of the album's release‚Äîwas that it drew the listener \\"away from the hurt and guilt to the dream, the promised South Africa.\\"Quoted in Viljoen (2002), pp. 331 The title song, \\"Another Country\\", in particular expressed an optimism about the country's future. It was written by bandmembers Alan Lazar and John Leyden. While the notes for the band's 2006 compilation album Moments Away say that the song was written as \\"a response to the events surrounding the Boipatong massacre\\", Femina magazine had previously attributed the song to the assassination of anti-apartheid political leader Chris Hani. Stella Viljoen, an associate professor of visual studies at the University of Stellenbosch, described the song as \\"a hopeful, yet reserved, anthem for the new South Africa's resurrection from the ashes of apartheid\\", that was \\"embraced by many in this spirit\\".Viljoen (2002), p. 331 Radio and television stations in South Africa broadcast the song over and over. In a 2017 interview, lead singer Claire Johnston said that \\"Another Country\\" was the only Mango Groove song that was \\"overtly political\\". \\"We changed the hearts and minds of people in a way politicians cannot.\\" Arthur Goldstuck of Billboard described \\"Another Country\\" as \\"one of the most beautiful songs to emerge from [South Africa's] transition to democracy\\". Johnny Clegg and Savuka‚Äîanother influential, multi-ethnic, anti-apartheid band‚Äîalso released an album during South Africa's crossover period: Heat, Dust and Dreams (1993). For their 2016 album Faces to the Sun, Mango Groove re-recorded \\"Another Country\\" with a duet between Claire Johnston and Zolani Mahola. A music video for the re-recording followed the release of the album. The video was filmed at a concert the band performed on National Women's Day in August 2016. Music videos The band recorded music videos for three songs from the album: \\"Another Country\\", \\"Nice to See You\\", and \\"Tropical Rain\\". =\\"Tropical Rain\\"= In \\"Tropical Rain\\", which was taped in colour, the band wear various costumes as they play and dance in a tropical setting. =\\"Nice to See You\\"= The video for \\"Nice to See You\\" is in black and white. A Zulu man presents a phonograph with a twelve-inch single of \\"Nice to See You\\" to his father, and plays it. When the music begins, Johnston strolls through a mid-century town as people dance. She travels by train and car to an African music competition, which Mango Groove wins. As the winning band, Mango plays on a variety show. Shots of Johnston singing into a microphone at a radio station are interspersed with scenes of her radio listeners. The end of the video returns to the original Zulu frame narrative. More people approach as the music from the phonograph fades. The elder Zulu man praises the record, and tells his son to \\"let it play out\\". =\\"Another Country\\"= The video for \\"Another Country\\" opens on a charcoal drawing animation by William Kentridge of a barren landscape dotted with horn loudspeakers of the sort used in public address systems. Wind howls in the air, but stops when Johnston begins to sing. As she does so, she raises an arm in gesture, and a vessel of water emerges. The scene changes to an animated charcoal drawing of a city. Protestors fill the streets. On one building, images materialise of people who have been injured and killed. Later in the video, the protestors surround the towers of loudspeakers, some of which are now covered and bound. Johnston stands as a giant in a sea of protestors. With a swipe of her arm, she destroys one of the towers. The wrapping of one of the towers forms a bowl, and the protestors leave the streets. The bowl fills to overflowing with water, and the water floods the streets of the city. A radio emerges from the water, and the a stream carries away one of the loudspeakers. The scaffolding of another loudspeaker collapses, and the speaker becomes a bucket from which water flows. Johnston gestures again, and a giant bowl of water appears in the sky over a field of protestors. Their presence is replaced with a lush landscape, and the bowl overflows with water. Track listing Production Another Country was recorded over the course of four months at BOP Studios, outside the city of Mafikeng. The recording engineer was Richard Mitchell, who was assisted by Alistair Glyn. The album was produced by bandmember Alan Lazar and bandleader John Leyden; the executive producer was Robert Schr√∂der of Stave Record Productions.

In fact, body hair had been viewed as a boon by Caucasian people, and therefore removal was not an imported practice from European settlers into the United States. American women's new practice of armpit and leg hair removal began in the early 20th century when a confluence of multiple factors facilitated the change. One cultural change was the definition of femininity. In the Victorian era, it was based on moral character. This shifted in the early 1920s when the new feminine idea became based on the body. Women revealed more of their bodies in 1920s clothing; and at the same time they began using bras, makeup, and dieting. Author of The Body Project, J. Brumberg, summarizes, \\"The body itself became the fashion in the 1920s.\\" In this context, hair removal was promoted as a gender norm requirement for women, to be attained through consumption and use of hair removal products.  Underarm hair history  Advertisement for a depilatory powder named X Bazin Developments in three industries enabled a heavy and effective advertising campaign beginning in 1908 to show American people that female underarm hair was offensive. These industries were the male hair removal products industry, which had become recently commercially successful and sought to expand its market; the women's clothing fashion industry, which began producing sheer and sleeveless evening gowns and rising hemlines; and the mass production of women's magazines. = The market for female hair removal products = Men had already been shaving at barber's shops and later at home when a men's disposable \\"safety-razor\\" was introduced for home use in 1903. Quickly successful, Gillette sold 90,000 razor sets the next year. A female market for hair removal products, on the other hand, did not yet exist in the United States; that market had to be created. According to Hansen, a researcher on the topic, \\"The practice of removing hair from the underarms and legs was practically unheard of.\\" She goes on, \\"In fact, hair removal was such a novel concept when it was first introduced that companies had to persuade women of the benefits of hair removal, and demonstrate how to practice it.\\" The first razor marketed specifically to women came to market in 1915 from Gillette. From then to the 1930s, Gillette and dozens of other hair removal companies used the changes in women's clothing fashions as justification for the sudden need to remove underarm hair, and later leg hair. The message was distributed primarily and heavily through the newly-born, popular and influential women's magazines. = Rise of women's magazines = The Delineator, first published in 1873, was the first women's magazine. Five others appeared soon after, comprising what became known as the \\"Big Six\\": Ladies' Home Journal, Woman's Home Companion, Good Housekeeping, McCall's, and Pictorial Review. The publisher of the Ladies Home Journal, Cyrus Curtis, told advertisers that the purpose of the magazine was to give manufacturers a way to market their products to women, not for the benefit of American women. The goal of advertisers was to not only fulfill women's needs; it was to create new ones. The amount of advertising for toiletries and beauty services were second only to advertisements for food. Estimated advertising spends between 1890 and 1914 grew from $190 million to $682 million. Improvements in printing technologies, railroad transportation and postal services made mass circulation of these magazines possible. The population of women increased by two thirds between 1890 and 1920 and the literacy rate jumped to 94% in 1920. Both of these demographic shifts increased the audience for women's magazines. The most popular women's magazine, Ladies' Home Journal, had 25,000 readers by the end of its first year. The reach of these women's magazines meant they were extraordinarily influential. = The Great Underarm Campaign = Advertisements suggesting that women remove hair under the arm, and explaining how and why to do so, were published as early as 1908, and ran more steadily beginning in 1914. The 1915 advertisement on the right ran in Harper's Bazaar for a depilatory powder called X Bazin is stereotypical of ads during this time in that it defines why underarm hair removal is necessary. It also shows an image of a woman in a sleeveless gown with her arm up and the caption \\"Summer Dress and Modern Dancing combine to make necessary the removal of objectionable hair.\\" Advertisers were careful to use wording they felt would be more palatable to their audience, for example \\"smoothing\\" instead of \\"shaving\\" and \\"limbs\\" instead of \\"legs\\". The educational campaign on the benefits of and methods of hair removal persisted into the ads of the early 1920s and even continue today. Underarm hair in these ads was called \\"objectionable\\", \\"unwelcome\\", \\"embarrassing\\", \\"unsightly\\" and \\"unclean\\"; and its removal indicated a person who had \\"charm\\" and \\"the last touch of ‚Äòfeminine loveliness'\\" and was \\"modest\\", \\"dainty and perfectly groomed\\"; the practice was for \\"refined women\\" and \\"women of fashion.\\" Hair removal product manufacturers initially focused their marketing on the upper class. Beginning in 1934, a similar type of advertising showed up in the middle-class Ladies' Home Journal that had been running in upper class Harper's Bazaar for the past 15 years.  Leg hair history  The 1920s extended the hairless ideal of the armpits to the legs as well. Hemlines rose on skirts and dresses from 1910‚Äì1927. Americans wore thick dark-colored stockings at first, which were taken over during this period by flesh-colored stockings to simulate the look of bare legs, without actually being bare. Then ads alluding to leg hair removal began. While ads between 1920-1940 do refer to legs, legs were not the focus in 90% of those ads. The first ad in Harper's Bazaar that focused primarily on the legs appeared in 1929. The ad campaign against leg hair was not as voluminous as the campaign against underarm hair had been. However, writers for beauty magazines and books did reinforce the hairless-leg message. This had not happened in the Underarm Campaign. Leg hair removal gained popularity after one historical event. Hosiery production plummeted suddenly in 1941 by 97% when the US War Production Board curtailed silk and nylon stockings manufacturing. In response, American ladies applied decals or \\"liquid stockings\\" (leg makeup) to simulate the seam of stockings, atop of shaved legs. Between 1942‚Äì1945, the War Production Board imposed further limits on cosmetic manufacturing, including leg makeup, taxing cosmetics as much as 20%. The norm to remove leg hair for women became very strong in the 1940s, more specifically, it moved from fad to custom in a matter of months in the early 1940s. A later survey, in 1964, indicated that 98% of American women aged 15‚Äì44 routinely shaved their legs.  Modern practices  A century after these ad campaigns started, removal of leg and underarm hair by women in the U.S. is tremendously pervasive and lack of its removal is taboo. An estimated 80‚Äì99% of American women today remove hair from their bodies. Celebrity unshaven armpit appearances started to make headlines. For example, this was the case with actress Julia Roberts who sported unshaven underarms at the Notting Hill movie premiere in 1999. Anne Robinson, a presenter British television show The Weakest Link, received a similar reaction after she revealed underarm hair on air in 2008. A woman who does not remove body hair may be perceived as being less sexually attractive, sociable and intelligent than the same woman without body hair; and may incite disgust.

It is considered one of the largest in the Iberian Peninsula. The prosperity of these latifundia in the region is often evidenced by shrines in the courtyard (such as in the Roman Villa of Milreu ). In addition to the extensive living areas, a basilica and a seven-roomed baptistery have been uncovered in Torre de Palma.Sargnon, O. (1957) A la farmevillaromaine de Torre de Palma.

Location The villa of Torre de Palma is located about 5 km northwest of Monforte on the main road to Vaiamonte . From the estate Herdade da Palma a signposted, unpaved road leads to the fenced area. Excavations The remains of the villa were discovered in 1947 and until 1956, excavations were conducted under the direction of the Portuguese archaeologist Manuel Heleno. Among other things, several well-preserved geometric mosaics were found in the portico and the so-called star mosaic, as well as numerous murals. The Archaeological Museum of Monforte displays some of the originals and reproductions of the mosaics. The best preserved mosaics are in the Museu Nacional de Arqueologia in Lisbon. The site The chronology of the various periods of the villa ranges from the 1st to the 5th century. From the 3rd century onward, there was an increase in extent especially in the 4th century . In addition to a large residential complex, a thermal complex was discovered to the east,Reis, Maria Pilar (2004). Las termas y balnea romanos de Lusitania. STVDIA LVSITANA (S√©rie Monogr√°fica do Museo Nacional de Arte Romano, M√©rida), 1. and a building north of the main building may also have been used for residential purposes.

Villa rustica A villa rustica consisted of a pars urbana, a pars rustica and the frumentaria. The pars urbana was where the owner and his family lived. This would be similar to the wealthy-person's in the city and had painted walls. The pars rustica was where the chef and slaves of the villa worked and lived. This was also the living quarters for the farm's animals. There would usually be other rooms here that might be used as store rooms, a hospital and even a prison. The villa fructuaria would be the storage rooms. These would be where the products of the farm were stored ready for transport to buyers. Storage rooms here would have been used for oil, wine, grain, grapes and any other produce of the villa. Other rooms in the villa might include an office, a temple for worship, several bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen. The main building of the villa rustica at Torre de Palma alone took up 10,000 m2 of space. It was created around a quadrangular peristyle. In the centre was an Impluvium with an adjoining column-supported porch and mosaic floors. Adjoining the courtyard are the tablinum and the exedra , which used to be a kind of music and social space in the past. Here the famous mosaics with representations of muses and horses were found.Almeida , Fernando de (1970) O mosaico dos Cavalos (Torre de Palma). In O Arque√≥logo Portugu√™s. Lisboa. 3¬™ s√©rie: 4, p. 263276. The dining room, the triclinium , is decorated with frescoes on the walls and a mosaic of floral motifs on the floor. The North side of the atrium was a hortus. On the West side of the atrium were the private rooms and a small thermal baths more private than the main spa.Alarc√£o, Jorge Manuel N.L. (1986) A arquitectura romana.

Basilica Right next to the entrance of the site are the ruins of the early Christian basilica with a cross-shaped baptistery. The building type with opposite apses is documented in Hispania five times between the 6th and the 7th century. The discovery of nine coins at the eastern end of the nave suggests a much earlier date for the Basilica of Torre de Palma, as the embossed dates are between 335 and 357. Strong remains of foundations under the basilica suggest that another sanctuary was there before believed to have been a Temple to Mars.Maloney , Stephanie J.

Baptistery The initially 26 m long pillared basilica later received an extension on its south side, which contained a seven-roomed baptistery. The associated piscina considered to be the most complex in the Iberian Peninsula. It is clad with marble. The structure in the western part of the villa became cluttered due to a small church built after the Reconquista. The baptismal room now has a modern shelter. Artefacts The site has yielded numerous artifacts among them, coins dated 145 A.D. and 408 A.D.Huffstot, John Stewart (1998) - Votive (?) use of coins in fourth century Lusitania: the builders' deposit in the Torre de Palma bas√≠lica.

Recognizing that many women worked as unpaid labourers either within the family or within family businesses, she became a vocal advocate for their service to be recognized as valuable. A founding member of the Women's Association for Education and Social Action, she served as president of the organization between 1970 and 1975. Participating in numerous international conferences and government commissions, she advocated for improved access to education and civil participation by women. She was a recipient of the Order of Canada and honoured as a knight in the National Order of Quebec. Early life Azilda Lapierre was born on 8 December 1918 in Saint-J√©r√¥me, Quebec, Canada. After completing her secondary education in Catholic schools, she graduated from the Marier-Rivier Normal School in Saint-Hyacinthe and married Jean-Maurice Marchand of Ange-Gardien, with whom she would have nine children. Career Marchand began her career as a teacher, in primary and secondary schools, later participating in adult education. In 1937, she founded the Women's Catholic Agricultural Youth Movement () in conjunction with the movement in Quebec. The organization had been founded in France during the Great Depression as a means to revitalize rural youth, since the First World War had depopulated the countryside and sent many young people to urban areas. The organization recognized the isolation of rural populations and attempted to bring youth back to religion and moral lives by assisting them through the development of educational opportunity and recreational activities. In the 1950s, she joined the Union of Catholic Rural Women () and in 1961, she became the president of the Saint-Hyacinthe branch, serving in that capacity until 1966. That year, she co-founded the Women's Association for Education and Social Action (, AF√âAS), an organization aimed at promoting and improving women's civic participation. At the time, society was not in favour of women working outside the home, and public debate ensued regarding paid labour for women. Marchand denounced the detractors and favoured not only encouraging women to participate in the labour force, but urged that the free labour women did in both the home and family business should be acknowledged. Marchand served as a delegate of the AF√âAS in Rome in 1967 to the Congress of the World Association of Catholic Women's Organizations. She published a brief on the modern workforce in conjunction with AF√âAS in 1969 and presented the findings regarding the invisibility of women's work to the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, led by Florence Bird. The following year, she assumed the presidency of the organization, serving through 1975. In 1972, Marchand was appointed to the Council for Higher Education, participating in numerous studies on college education and teaching. At her urging, in 1974, the report La femme collaboratrice dans une entreprise familiale (Women as collaborators in a family business) was undertaken by AF√âAS, was prepared to evaluate the vulnerability of women and lack of legal protections for them if they should become separated or divorced. Marchand attended the 1975 World Conference on Women in Mexico City as part of the United Nations' International Women's Year events. From 1974 to 1980, she served as part of the Canadian delegation to UNESCO, as a representative for AF√âAS, and between 1975 and 1980, she served on Qu√©bec's Advisory Council on the Status of Women. Marchand was honoured in 1984 with the Governor General's Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case for her contributions to women's rights and social work. In 1985, Marchand was honoured as a knight in the National Order of Quebec and with the Order of Canada for her work with women and in education. She was granted an honorary doctorate in social work from the Universit√© de Sherbrooke in 1987, by Pierre Martel, who in his remarks stated that she had changed the collective consciousness of Qu√©b√©cois on how women should be perceived and how they could behave. AF√âAS created the Prix Azilda Marchand to recognize those with exemplary contributions in social work and women's rights. Death and legacy Marchand died on 9 May 2010 in Ange-Gardien, Quebec, Canada. AF√âAS created the Prix Azilda Marchand to recognize those with exemplary contributions in social work and women's rights.
