This allows the user to retrieve any of the previous versions of the original source code and the changes which are stored. It was originally developed at Bell Labs beginning in late 1972 by Marc Rochkind for an IBM System/370 computer running OS/360. A characteristic feature of SCCS is the sccsid string that is embedded into source code, and automatically updated by SCCS for each revision. This example illustrates its use in the C programming language: static char sccsid[] = \\"@(#)ls.c 8.1 (Berkeley) 6/11/93\\"; This string contains the file name, date, and can also contain a comment. After compilation, the string can be found in binary and object files by looking for the pattern \\"@(#)\\" and can be used to determine which source code files were used during compilation. The \\"what\\" command is available to automate this search for version strings. History In 1972, Marc Rochkind developed SCCS in SNOBOL4 at Bell Labs for an IBM System/370 computer running OS/360 MVT. He rewrote SCCS in the C programming language for use under UNIX, then running on a PDP-11, in 1973. The first publicly released version was SCCS version 4 from February 18, 1977.http://sccs.sourceforge.net/PWB.html AT&T; Announcement for SCCSv4 It was available with the Programmer's Workbench (PWB) edition of the operating system. Release 4 of SCCS was the first version that used a text-based history file format, earlier versions did use binary history file formats. Release 4 was no longer written or maintained by Marc Rochkind. Subsequently, SCCS was included in AT&T;'s commercial System III and System V distributions. It was not licensed with 32V, the ancestor to BSD.SCCS what(1) manpage from 4BSD, 1980, on the website of The Unix Heritage Society . The SCCS command set is now part of the Single UNIX Specification. SCCS was the dominant version control system for Unix until later version control systems, notably the RCS and later CVS, gained more widespread adoption. Today, these early version control systems are generally considered obsolete, particularly in the open-source community, which has largely embraced distributed version control systems. However, the SCCS file format is still used internally by a few newer version control programs, including BitKeeper and TeamWare. The latter is a frontend to SCCS.

The SCCS file format uses a storage technique called interleaved deltas (or the weave). This storage technique is now considered by many version control system developers as foundational to advanced merging and versioning techniques,Estublier, Jacky, David Leblang, Andr√© van der Hoek, Reidar Conradi, Geoffrey Clemm, Walter Tichy, and Darcy Wiborg-Weber. ‚ÄúImpact of software engineering research on the practice of software configuration management.‚Äù ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM) 14 (October 2005): p.398. such as the \\"Precise Codeville\\" (\\"pcdv\\") merge. Apart from correcting Year 2000 problems in 1999, no active development has taken place on the various UNIX vendor-specific SCCS versions. What is SCCS, GNU operating System In 2006, Sun Microsystems (today part of Oracle) released their Solaris version of SCCS as open-source under the CDDL license as part of their efforts to open-source Solaris. Background The Source Code Control System (SCCS) is a system for controlling file and history changes. Software is typically upgraded to a new version by fixing bugs, optimizing algorithms and adding extra functions. Changing software causes problems that require version control to solve. * Source code takes up too much space because it is repeated in every version. * It is hard to acquire information about when and where changes occurred. * Finding the exact version which the client has problems with is difficult. SCCS was built to solve these problems. SCCS from AT&T; had five major versions for the IBM OS and five major versions for UNIXThe evolution of a Source Code Control System. Alan L.Glasser, published in sigmetrics, Nov 1978 when SCCS on UNIX was a version 4 Two specific implementations using SCCS are: PDP 11 under Unix and IBM 370 under the OS.  Composition  SCCS consists of two parts: SCCS commands and SCCS files. All basic operations (e.g., create, delete, edit) can be realized by SCCS commands. SCCS files have a unique format prefix \`s.\`, which is controlled by SCCS commands.  SCCS files  An SCCS file is consists of three parts: * Delta table * Access and tracking flags * Body of the text  Delta table  In SCCS, a delta is a single revision in an SCCS file. Deltas are stored in a delta table, so each SCCS file has its own record of changes.  Control and tracking flags in SCCS files  Every operation of each SCCS file is tracked by flags. Their functions are as below: * Setting permissions for editing of every SCCS file. * Control each release of every SCCS file. * Permitting collaborative editing of every SCCS file. * Mutual-referencing changes of every SCCS file.  Body  SCCS uses three types of control records for keeping track of insertions and deletions applied in different deltas. They are the insertion control record, the deletion control record, and the end control record. Whenever a user changes some part of the text, a control record is inserted surrounding the change. The control records are stored in the body along with the original text records. SCCS basic commands SCCS provides a set of commands in the form of macro invocations that perform or initiate source code management functions with a simple syntax, such as create, get, edit, prt. An Introduction to the Source Code Control System Eric Allman, Project Ingres, University of California at Berkeley Source Code Control System Programming Utilities Guide. It also provides access to the revision history of files under management. These commands are implemented as argument verbs to the driver program sccs.  Create  The sccs command create uses the text of a source file to create a new history file. For example: $ sccs create program.c program.c: 1.1 87 lines The outputs are name, version and lines. The command is a macro that expands to admin to create the new history file followed by get to retrieve the file.  Edit  $ sccs edit program.c 1.1 new delta 1.2 87 lines Edit a specific file. The command is a macro that expands to get -e.  Delget  $ sccs delget program.c comments? main function enhanced 1.2 10 inserted 0 deleted 87 unchanged 1.2 97 lines Check in new version and get the new version from sccs. The command is a macro that expands to delta to check in the new version file followed by get to retrieve the file.  Get  $ sccs get program.c 1.1 87 lines The outputs are version and lines you want to get from specific file.  Prt  $ sccs prt program.c This command produces a report of source code changes. Alternatives= UNIX SCCS versions  Most UNIX versions include a version of SCCS, which, however, is often no longer actively developed.Koike, Hideki, and Hui-Chu Chu. \\"VRCS: Integrating version control and module management using interactive three-dimensional graphics.\\" Visual Languages, 1997.

Other version control systems  Since the 1990s, many new version control systems have been developed and become popular that are designed for managing projects with a large number of files and that offer advanced functionality such as multi-user operation, access control, automatic building, network support, release management and distributed version control. Bitkeeper and TeamWare use the SCCS file format internally and can be considered successors to SCCS. On BSD systems, the SCCSID is replaced by a RCSID starting and ending with ; the corresponding tool is . This system is originally used by RCS and added automatically on checkout, but has since become an integral part of the style guide in the FreeBSD code base, which defines a custom keyword and a macro renamed . The SRC version control system can also use the SCCS file format internally (or RCS's) and aims to provide a better user interface for SCCS while still managing only single-file projects.

Its three songs were originally written for the group's eighth studio album Wind & Wuthering (1976), but were not included in the final track selection. It was the final studio release to feature guitarist Steve Hackett prior to his departure from Genesis. Spot the Pigeon was not released in the United States as the market for EPs never took off there, but a Canadian release was issued by Atlantic Records (the band's overseas distributor) and was imported into the US and easily available at shops that sold imports. Spot the Pigeon reached No. 14 in the UK Singles Chart. It was released on CD in 1988 but has not been reissued since; \\"Pigeons\\" and \\"Inside and Out\\" were included in the Genesis Archive 2: 1976-1992 (2000) and Turn It On Again: The Hits ‚Äì The Tour Edition (2007) sets, and \\"Match of the Day\\" on Genesis 1976‚Äì1982 (2007) and on the label sampler Refugees: A Charisma Records Anthology 1969-1978 (2009). Background The title is a variation on the football-themed spot the ball (the cover resembles a spot the ball competition photo), replacing the word \\"ball\\" with \\"pigeon\\" so that the title links the themes of the first two songs. Drummer-singer Phil Collins expressed his disdain for \\"Match of the Day\\" in 2004, saying, \\"It was also not our finest hour looking back at it now. I wrote the embarrassing lyrics and the track featured an attempt to bring some of the hipper grooves of the day into Genesis, with very suspect results.\\" The lightweight \\"Pigeons\\" is driven by a one-note banjolele line that parodies English musician George Formby. Steve Hackett commented in 2009 that \\"the thing about ‚ÄòPigeons‚Äô was that it was possible for the band to play a whole note for a whole thing: ding-ding-ding-ding. And that was unvarying whilst the keyboard changed and [Banks] tried to do as many different chords as possible.\\" Per bassist-rhythm guitarist Mike Rutherford, the band felt that the omission of both songs from Wind & Wuthering was detrimental, which led to attempts at making songs with shorter lengths on their next album, ...And Then There Were Three.... \\"Inside and Out\\" combines images of folk and progressive pop for what would be the last time in the band's career with Hackett as an active member. Since its 1977 release, Hackett remained adamant that the song exemplified the band‚Äôs multi-layered sound and should have been included on the Wind & Wuthering LP released in December 1976. ‚ÄúI think it is one of the stronger tracks that didn‚Äôt make it onto the album,‚Äù he told Vintage Rock in 2017. ‚ÄúI think it should have been because it has a very beautiful sound to it. Right from the word ‚Äògo,‚Äô it‚Äôs got that Genesis multi-jangle thing where it sounds like one guitar, but it‚Äôs a whole bunch of guitars all playing the same thing.‚Äù The song was performed several times on the Wind & Wuthering tour in 1977. The first section, \\"Inside\\", concerns a man who is wrongfully imprisoned of rape. The second section \\"Out\\", is an instrumental passage that represents the man's freedom. Critical reception AllMusic's retrospective review praised the songwriting on the EP for returning to the sound of early Genesis album Trespass, but concluded their review with: \\"Spot the Pigeon has never been a popular or even very accessible release in the U.S. Of course, there's a reason for this: It simply isn't very exciting.\\" The blog site NarrowtheAngle.com commented in 2011 about \\"Match of the Day,\\" stating \\"It's a ludicrously naff attempt at conveying the passion and commitment of a football match...There have been an abundance of terrible football songs over the years, but this has an earnest quality to it that makes it all the more offensive.

She was named for Lieutenant John Trippe. Trippe was laid down on 12 April 1910 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works; launched on 20 December 1910; sponsored by Mrs. John S. Hyde; and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 23 March 1911, Lieutenant Frank D. Berrien in command. Pre-World War I Upon commissioning, Trippe joined the torpedo boat destroyers and submarines assigned to the east coast as a unit of the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. For the next three years, she conducted routine operations along the east coast. In 1911, she completed trials and participated in exercises off Newport, Boston, and the Virginia Capes. She made her first cruise to southern waters in 1912. She cleared Newport on 3 January and dropped anchor in Guantanamo Bay 11 days later. Following three months of training at Guantanamo Bay and in the Gulf of Mexico, the torpedo boat destroyer returned north in April and entered Boston harbor on the 21st. After repairs, Trippe resumed training operations off the northeastern coast. On 2 January 1913, the warship headed south once more for three months of tactical exercises and gunnery drills out of Guantanamo Bay and in the Gulf of Guacanayabo. She returned to Boston on 14 April and spent the remainder of 1913 in operations off the coast between Boston and Norfolk, Virginia. Trippe began 1914 as she had the previous two years ‚Äî by heading south and conducting battle practice in the Caribbean through the end of March. However, in April, the Tampico incident brought her to the shores of Mexico, when American sailors and Marines went ashore at Veracruz and seized the customs house on the 21st. Trippe arrived off Tampico on the 22d and patrolled the area for a week to prevent arms from being landed. On 1 May, she steamed south to Vera Cruz where she conducted more patrols and supported the battleships and cruisers operating in the vicinity. Near the end of the month, Trippe cleared Mexican waters; and, on the 31st, entered Boston harbor. At the completion of an extensive overhaul, the warship conducted trials and drills in the Boston area from mid-August to late September. On 30 September, Trippe arrived at Newport for a week of operation before heading south. She shifted to Hampton Roads in mid-October and participated in exercises there and at Lynnhaven Bay for a month before returning to Boston. The warship spent December and the first three weeks of 1915 in the Boston area and, on 26 January, arrived in Guantanamo Bay to resume her schedule of winter drills in the Caribbean. Late in March, Trippe pointed her bow northward once more and reached Boston on 6 April. After her normal round of maneuvers off the northeastern coast, the torpedo boat destroyer returned to Boston on 23 October. A little less than two months later ‚Äî on 13 December 1915 ‚Äî Trippe became a unit of the newly organized 2nd Reserve Flotilla. On 5 January 1916, she was designated a \\"Destroyer operating with reduced complement;\\" and, on the 27th, she was placed in ordinary at the Boston Navy Yard. World War I The threat of war, however, made her retirement a brief one. Trippe was placed in full commission once again at Boston on 25 July 1916, Lieutenant, junior grade Roy P. Emrich in command. During the following eight months, Trippe trained along the coast in preparation for the increasingly probable entry of the United States into World War I. The United States declared war on the German Empire on 6 April 1917. Trippe continued to operate off the coast until early May, when she entered Boston and commenced preparations for duty overseas. On 21 May, the destroyer cleared Boston for Britain. After a call at St. John's, Newfoundland, she arrived in Queenstown on the southern coast of Ireland, the location of a major wartime American destroyer base. She paused only long enough to refuel and make voyage repairs before clearing the harbor on 5 June for her first patrol. From Queenstown, she escorted Allied convoys on the last leg of their voyage from America to France and England. Her field of operations, situated as it was in the war zone which had been established around the British Isles by Germany on 5 February 1915, was the prime hunting ground of High Seas Fleet U-boats. When not engaged in escorting convoys, Trippe patrolled the waters around Queenstown in an effort to detect and destroy as many enemy submarines as possible. The warship had only one verified scrape with German U-boats. On 18 September 1917, she and were steaming in company some west of Brest, France, when ‚Äî shortly after 0200 ‚Äî she sighted the distinctive wake of the periscope of a submarine running on a parallel course, but in the opposite direction. Trippe dropped depth charges, but without \\"visible results\\", and continued on to rendezvous with an eastbound convoy. That night, she dueled with another adversary ‚Äî the sea. In a raging storm, waves carried her starboard waist gun platform overboard. Trippe, however, successfully shepherded her convoy into Quiberon Bay, France, made repairs quickly, and resumed her grueling routine. Through the final year of the war, Trippe and her sister ships slowly bested the enemy. Convoys of merchant ships carried troops and supplies to France, where the armies of the Allies grew steadily. By the fall of 1918, they reached a point of overwhelming superiority over those of the Central Powers. On 11 November, the day of the signing of the armistice, Trippe was in port at Queenstown. Just over a month later, she cleared that Irish port, refueled at the Azores and Bermuda, and returned to Boston on 3 January 1919. After six months of operations along the eastern seaboard, the destroyer entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 July for preinactivation overhaul. On 6 November 1919, Trippe was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Inter-war period Trippes inactivity lasted five years. By 1924, Prohibition had spawned a thriving traffic in smuggling alcoholic beverages. The Coast Guard's small fleet, charged with stopping the illegal importation of alcohol, was unequal to the task. Consequently, President Calvin Coolidge proposed to increase that fleet by 20 of the Navy's inactive destroyers, and Congress authorized the necessary funds on 2 April 1924. Coast Guardsmen and Navy yard workers overhauled Trippes hull, stripped her of depth charge gear and torpedo tubes, and removed one of her four guns. On 7 June 1924, Trippe was transferred to the Treasury Department; and, on 24 June, she was placed in commission as Trippe (CG-20), Lieutenant Commander John H. Cornell, USCG, in command. For the next four years, the former Navy destroyer operated along the northeastern coast out of New London, Connecticut, as a cutter of the Coast Guard's \\"rum patrol.\\" Trippe was placed in reduced commission at New London on 5 January 1929. That October, she was moved to Stapleton, New York. From January to March 1930, she was overhauled at the New York Navy Yard. After a month of gunnery exercises off St. Petersburg, Florida, she returned to Stapleton on 23 April to resume operations along the coast. On 18 December, Trippe cleared Stapleton for the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The Coast Guard decommissioned Trippe at Philadelphia on 15 April 1931 and returned her to the Navy on 2 May. She remained in reserve at Philadelphia until 1934 when she was scrapped. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934. She was sold to Michael Flynn, Inc. of Brooklyn, New York on 22 August 1934.

Some members of the group manage to evade capture and continue with terrorist activities. Eight weeks later, believing the threat is past, the President organizes an outdoors activity trip for his teenage daughter, Jess (Monica Keena), who has grown tired of the public life and constant Secret Service supervision. Jess, excited about the trip, is disappointed to learn a Secret Service agent she dislikes, Alex McGregor (Mariel Hemingway), will be accompanying her, despising her over a misunderstanding embrace between her father and Alex. Jess goes so far as to spread rumours about Alex during the trip, leaving an air of animosity between the two of them. Unbeknownst to the hikers, during their trip they are seen by members of the domestic terrorist group who have been hiding out in the same woods to evade capture. The terrorists initially believe they are witnessing a normal group of hikers, but soon notice bodyguards with guns. Eventually, one of the group recognises Jess, and identifies her as the daughter of President Hayes. They quickly form a plan to kidnap Jess in order to negotiate the release of Smith. They ambush the hikers, kill one of the bodyguards, and kidnap Jess. With the help of one of the river guides, Grant Coleman (Savant), Alex searches for Jess and attempts a daring rescue.

After crossing the border, fugitives had to walk a nine km (5.6 mi) long road, the \\"Road To Freedom\\" (Fluchtstrasse), to the village of Andau, where they were received with great hospitality by the inhabitants of Andau and the surrounding villages. On November 21, 1956, the bridge was blasted by Soviet troops.  Today  In 1996, with the 40th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution, the bridge was rebuilt as a symbol of tolerance and helpfulness. Organised as a joint operation by the Austrian and Hungarian armies, it replaced a stub bridge, which had been built by peasants for transportation reasons. At the same time, the Road Of Freedom was used as an open-air exhibition with the title \\"Road Of Woes\\", showing about ninety sculptures and other art works by Hungarian and Austrian artists.  Literature and film  As a symbol of freedom, the bridge not only achieved fame with the book The Bridge at Andau by James Michener (1957), but also became a world-known memorial. The Bridge of Andau is also the topic of , a 2000 Austrian movie dealing with the Hungarian Revolution in a slightly humorous manner, the third part of .

It is located in the centre of Dublin with one entrance on Merrion Square, beside Leinster House, and another on Clare Street. It was founded in 1854 and opened its doors ten years later. The Gallery has an extensive, representative collection of Irish paintings and is also notable for its Italian Baroque and Dutch masters painting. The current director is Sean Rainbird.  History  In 1853 an exhibition, the Great Industrial Exhibition, was held on the lawns of Leinster House in Dublin. Among the most popular exhibits was a substantial display of works of art organised and underwritten by the railway magnate William Dargan. The enthusiasm of the visiting crowds demonstrated a public for art, and it was decided to establish a permanent public art collection as a lasting monument of gratitude to Dargan. The moving spirit behind the proposal was the barrister John Edward Pigot (1822-1871), son of David Richard Pigot, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and he became one of the first Governors of the Gallery.National Gallery of Ireland Act 1854 section 7. The fa√ßade of the National Gallery copies the Natural History building of the National Museum of Ireland which was already planned for the facing flank of Leinster House. The building itself was designed by Francis Fowke, based on early plans by Charles Lanyon, and was completed and opened in 1864. The Gallery was not founded around an existing collection, and when the Gallery opened it had just 112 paintings. In 1866 an annual purchase grant was established and by 1891 space was already limited. In 1897, the Dowager Countess of Milltown indicated her intention of donating the contents of Russborough House to the Gallery. This gift included about 223 paintings, 48 pieces of sculpture, 33 engravings, much silver, furniture and a library, and prompted construction from 1899 to 1903 of what is now called the Milltown Wing, designed by Thomas Newenham Deane. At around this time Henry Vaughan left 31 watercolours by J.M.W. Turner with the requirement that they could only be exhibited in January, this to protect them from the ill-effects of sunlight. Though modern lighting technology has made this stipulation unnecessary, the Gallery continues to restrict viewing of the Vaughan bequest to January and the exhibition is treated as something of an occasion. Another substantial bequest came with the untimely death in the sinking of the of Hugh Lane (1875‚Äì1915), since 1914 director of the Gallery; not only did he leave a large collection of pictures, he also left part of his residual estate and the Lane Fund has continued to contribute to the purchase of artworks to this day. In addition to his involvement in the Gallery, Hugh Lane has also hoped to found a gallery of modern art, something only realised after his death in Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane. George Bernard Shaw also made a substantial bequest, leaving the Gallery a third of royalties of his estate in gratitude for the time he spent there as a youth. The Gallery was again extended in 1962 with a new wing designed by Frank DuBerry of the Office of Public Works. This opened in 1968 and is now named the Beit Wing. In 1978 the Gallery received from the government the paintings given to the nation by Chester Beatty and in 1987 the Sweeney bequest brought fourteen works of art including paintings by Picasso and Jack B. Yeats. The same year the Gallery was once again given some of the contents of Russborough House when Alfred Beit donated 17 masterpieces, including paintings by Vel√°zquez, Murillo, Steen, Vermeer and Raeburn. In the 1990s a lost Caravaggio, The Taking of Christ, known through replicas, was discovered hanging in a Jesuit house of studies in Leeson Street in Dublin by Sergio Benedetti, senior conservator of the gallery. The Jesuits have allowed this painting to be exhibited in the Gallery and the discovery was the cause of national excitement. The painting was on loan to an Italian gallery from February until July 2010 as part of Caravaggio's 400th anniversary. In 1997 Anne Yeats donated sketchbooks by her uncle Jack Yeats and the Gallery now includes a Yeats Museum. Denis Mahon, a well-known art critic, promised the Gallery part of his rich collection and eight painting from his promised bequest are on permanent display, including Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph by Guercino.

Unlike the previous two extensions, this new wing has street frontage and the English architects Benson & Forsyth gave it an imposing Bowers Whitbed, Portland Stone fa√ßade and grand atrium. The design originally involved demolishing an adjoining Georgian terrace house and its ballroom mews; however, the Irish planning appeals authority, An Bord Plean√°la, required that they be retained.  Master Development Plan  View of interior, c.2013 In March 2011, the Office of Public Works (OPW), in association with the Gallery, commenced work on the historic complex at Merrion Square to address a critical need for the repair and renovation of the fabric of the Dargan (1864) and Milltown (1903) wings, together with the provision of much needed additional accommodation. The first phase of the works programme involved the removal and replacement of the Dargan Wing roof. The next two phases of the project involved the replacement of the Milltown Wing roof, followed by an extensive upgrade of the fabric and services of the two buildings whilst reclaiming their original period elegance. Refurbishment of the two wings was completed in June 2017.  Location, access and facilities  The National Gallery of Ireland is located in the heart of Georgian Dublin. There are two entrances, one at Merrion Square and the other at Clare Street. Admission to the gallery is free and many talks, tours and events, as well as the audioguide, are also free of charge. The gallery launched a free smartphone app in 2013. Dublin Bus routes 4, 7 and 7a all pass by the gallery. The Pearse Street DART station is 5 minutes on foot as is the Dawson stop on the green line of the LUAS. The Abbey Street stop of the red line of the LUAS is a 20-minute walk away. There are two dublinbikes stations just outside the gallery, one at Clare Street and the other at Merrion Square West. All galleries and entrances are wheelchair and buggy accessible and there are disabled parking spaces outside the Merrion Square entrance. Tours for the visually and hearing impaired are regularly organised. Visitors with guide dogs are welcome in the gallery. The lecture theatre, AV room and gallery shop are all fitted with a loop system for the hearing impaired.  Highlights  The collection has about 14,000 artworks, including about 2,500 oil paintings, 5,000 drawings, 5,000 prints, and some sculpture, furniture and other works of art.

The origins of the collections can be traced back to the foundation of the institution over one hundred and sixty years ago. Covering the visual arts from the classical to the contemporary these collections continue to be a vital research element of the National Collection. The development of the library and archive has been supported principally through public funding and the private donations of generous benefactors. Open to the public, it has particularly rich holdings relating to the history of western European art from the Middle Ages on, and the collections relating to Irish and Italian art are extensive. The collection amounts to over 100,000 published volumes, in addition to significant archival holdings.

Her stage name was Mademoiselle Lange. Life She was born in Genoa, the daughter of Charles-Antoine Lange (or L'Ange) and Marie-Rose Pitrot, itinerant musicians and actors putting on shows right across Europe. She thus made her stage debut very young in child roles in her parents' companies. In 1776, the family was taken on at the theatre at Li√®ge, and in 1784, they found themselves taken on at the theatre in Ghent. In 1787, Mlle Lange was taken on at the theatre at Tours in Marguerite Brunet's company. On 2 October 1788, she made her official debut at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise in the role of Lindane in L'√âcossaise by Voltaire. She next played Lucinde in L'Oracle by Saint-Foix. In 1791, the production of the anti-religious and anti-monarchical play Charles IX by Marie-Joseph Ch√©nier divided the company of the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais, with Mlle Lange joining the \\"patriots\\" group under Talma, which set itself up at rue de Richelieu (the present home of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise). However, thinking her talents were not being fully recognized there, she quickly moved to the \\"aristocrats\\" faction that had set itself up at the Th√©√¢tre du Faubourg Saint-Germain (renamed the Th√©√¢tre de la Nation, now known as the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on). On 24 February 1793, she played Laure in Le Vieux C√©libataire by Jean-Fran√ßois Collin d'Harleville, becoming a soci√©taire later that year. She had a triumph in the eponymous role in Pam√©la ou la Vertu r√©compens√©e (Pamela or Virtue Rewarded) by Nicolas-Louis Fran√ßois de Neufch√¢teau,The play was based on the epistolary novel Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded (1740) by Samuel Richardson. setting a fashion for straw hats known as \\"√† la Pam√©la\\", but the play's royalist overtones led to this theatre being shut down and the author and actors arrested by the Committee of Public Safety. Mlle Lange was at first imprisoned in the prison de Sainte-P√©lagie until, after a few months in captivity, she managed to arrange her transfer to the pension Belhomme (along with her cook, her valet and her lady's maid). There she was able to maintain a large household thanks to funds from the banker Montz, filling the street outside with those coming to visit her. She also bought a h√¥tel particulier on rue Saint-Georges. In the wake of a denunciation, Fouquier-Tinville opened an enquiry which led to the arrest of Jacques Belhomme and the closure of the pension Belhomme. Mlle Lange returned to prison, but her friends in high places helped her to evade the guillotine. She was freed after 9th Thermidor and rejoined her fellow actors at the Th√©√¢tre Feydeau. She continued to live the high life under the Directory, having a liaison with the rascally arriviste N. Lieuthraud, the self- proclaimed \\"marquis de Beauregard\\", who had made a fortune as supplier to the armies of the republic, but eventually disappeared, pursued by creditors.Biographie des hommes vivants, 1816, s.v. \\"Beauregard (Lieuthraud, dit)\\" vol. i, p. 254. He housed her at the h√¥tel de Salm, one of the houses he had acquired, and maintained her there on an allowance said to be 10,000 livres a day. She was also the mistress of a rich banker from Hamburg, Hopp√©, bearing him a daughter, Anne-√âlisabeth Palmyre, who was recognized by her father in 1795. It is improbable, however, that she had an affair with Paul Barras as is claimed in the libretto of the famous operetta by Charles Lecocq, La Fille de madame Angot, in which Mlle Lange appears in a secondary role. Her final lover was Michel-Jean Simons, a Belgian supplier to the French army, with whom she had a son in December 1797. Simons recognized their son and married Mlle Lange, making her Madame Simons and putting an end to her theatrical career; she reappeared only for a few performances in 1807. Ruined, Simons died in 1810 in his ch√¢teau de Bossey in Switzerland. Widowed, she assumed a solitary life in obscurity and far from her admirers until her death.  Portraits  Girodet, Mlle Lange as Danae (1799) Mlle Lange was at the centre of a famous scandal which provoked Girodet to paint her in the guise of Danae. The actress had not liked a first portrait that she had asked him to withdraw from the Paris Salon of 1799, and so Girodet avenged himself by sending it back to her torn and exhibiting the painting of her as Danae in its place at the Salon. It was painted in only a few days, and openly shows her as a prostitute; nude, she gathers gold pieces in a sheet and is accompanied by a peacock-feathered turkey with a wedding ring on its foot (symbolizing her husband Simons) and a grotesque mask (with the features of her lover Leuthraud, and a gold piece stuck in its eye socket). This painting is now at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Other portraits of her include: * Colson, Mademoiselle Lange as Sylvie in Collet's play \\"L'√éle d√©serte\\", oil on canvas, 1793, Paris, Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1793. * Lefebvre, Mme Simons, n√©e Lange.

She was named for Rear Admiral Henry A. Walke. Walke was laid down on 5 March 1910 at Quincy, Massachusetts, by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company; launched on 3 November 1910; sponsored by Miss Mildred Walke Walter, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Walke; and commissioned on 22 July 1911 at the Boston Navy Yard, Lieutenant Charles R. Train in command. Pre-World War I Upon commissioning, Walke was assigned to the 9th Division, Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. After fitting out at Boston, Massachusetts, she moved to the Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, where she loaded torpedoes for training with the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet. During the fall and winter, the destroyer conducted battle practice and torpedo-firing exercises with the destroyers and submarines of the torpedo fleet. In addition, she operated with the larger units of the Atlantic Fleet itself during training in more comprehensive combat drills. Those exercises covered the entire Atlantic coast from Cape Cod in the north to Cuba in the south. Such operations occupied the destroyer until 1 November 1913, when she was placed in reserve at the New York Navy Yard. Though in reserve for the next 17 months, Walke never went out of commission; during her semi-retirement, the ship retained a commanding officer and at least a partial crew. Though not active with the Fleet, she did get underway periodically to keep her machinery in good working order while always remaining close to New York. During October and November 1914 Walke was employed in experimental deep sea diving trials which culminated in Navy diver Stephen J. Drelishak's dive to a then-record depth of in Long Island Sound. In July 1915, the destroyer returned to fully active service, first to participate in the Independence Day celebration at Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and then to visit Washington, D.C., for the Grand Army of the Republic celebration in late September. By 5 October, she found herself off Newport, with the Fleet conducting maneuvers. On 1 November, Walke entered the Charleston Navy Yard for a major overhaul. Those repairs were completed at the end of February 1916; and, in March, the ship moved south to Key West to prepare for gunnery practice. However, in May, revolutionary disorders broke out in the Dominican Republic; and Walke was dispatched to support the troops and marines landed there to restore order. From 6 May-19 June, she cruised along the coast of Hispaniola, leaving the area periodically for fuel or provisions at Ponce, Puerto Rico, or at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. After a brief visit to Haiti, the republic occupying the western end of Hispaniola, Walke returned to Key West on 19 June. On 21 July, she arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard to begin an eight-month overhaul. World War I The warship completed her overhaul in March 1917 and got underway on the 25th, bound for New York. She arrived at Staten Island the following day. By coincidence, Walke entered the New York Navy Yard on 6 April 1917; the day the United States declared war on Germany. Two weeks and four days later, she emerged from the yard ready to go into action. After patrols off New York, the destroyer voyaged to Charleston, South Carolina, where she arrived on 3 May. Following a 16-day visit to Charleston, she headed north and arrived back in New York on the 20th. Three days later, she put to sea bound for European waters. Because of her limited fuel capacity, the destroyer made the first three days of the voyage under tow by the collier, . Steaming under her own power after 26 May, she arrived in Gironde, France on 5 June. Following brief service there and at Brest, Walke moved to Queenstown on the southeastern coast of Ireland. From that port, she patrolled the western approaches to England and France, hunting for U-boats and escorting convoys into British and French ports until mid- November. On 17 November, the warship headed back to the United States. Again after making the first leg of the transatlantic voyage under tow because of her limited range, Walke arrived in New York on 30 November. From there, she headed south to Charleston, where she entered the yard in mid-December 1917. She completed repairs in March 1918 and returned to New York on the 16th. For the remainder of World War I, Walke patrolled the coastal waters of the United States from New York north to Cape Cod and escorted incoming and departing convoys into and out of New York harbor. Inter-war period Following the end of the war, Walke settled down to a routine of east coast operations and Atlantic Fleet exercises. Early in December 1918, she visited Baltimore, Maryland, and returned to New York on the 20th. In mid-January 1919, she moved south via Charleston to join in winter maneuvers held in the Cuba-Haiti area. Returning north by way of Key West and Miami, Florida, the destroyer reentered New York on 14 April. Between mid-April and mid-July, the warship cruised almost the entire Atlantic coast of the United States‚Äîfrom New York to Key West ‚Äî conducting torpedo practice and various other exercises. On 18 July, Walke arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to begin preparations for inactivation. The ship was decommissioned on 12 December. Walke remained at the Philadelphia Navy Yard until the mid-1930s. She received the alphanumeric hull designation DD-34 on 17 July 1920 but lost her name 13 years later on 1 July 1933 when it was reassigned to DD-416. Known simply as DD-34, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 March 1935 and was scrapped at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 April 1935 under the terms of the London Naval Treaty.

History  Medical Library Association Historical Marker, 1420 Chestnut St. Philadelphia PA Founded on May 2, 1898, by four librarians, including Marcia C. Noyes, and four physicians, the Association of Medical Librarians, as it was known until 1907, was founded ‚Äúto encourage the improvement and increase of public medical libraries.‚Äù MLA is the second oldest special library association in the United States. Two of the eight founding members were Canadians, William Osler and Margaret Ridley Charlton. The MLA Exchange was one of the founders‚Äô earliest and most important projects, helping build medical libraries in the United States and many other countries by exchanging duplicate publications. The organization has subsequently developed a variety of programs to serve the needs of health information specialists. The National Library of Medicine holds a collection of the organization's archival material that ranges from 1898 to 2002.  Membership  MLA's members are more than 400 institutions and 3,000 individuals in the health sciences information field worldwide, though‚Äîas many other countries now have their own national health library organizations‚Äîit now primarily represents health sciences libraries and librarians in the United States. Membership is structured to accommodate varying needs and professional status of a diverse field of practitioners. Categories include Regular Membership, Institutional Membership, International Membership, Affiliate Membership, and Student Membership.  Academy of Health Information Professionals  The Academy of Health Information Professionals (AHIP) is MLA's peer-reviewed professional development and career recognition program. The Academy recognizes the personal investment of time and effort required for exemplary professional performance and for contributions to the association and to the profession. Members of the academy are credentialed as health information professionals by demonstrating their academic preparation, professional experience and professional accomplishments. Credentialing differs from certification in that certification focuses on the attainment of minimum standards and measurable competencies, whereas credentialing recognizes the time and effort that is required for professional development. It also differs from licensure because licensure is a legal requirement for professionals in certain professions, such as medicine. = History of the Academy = MLA established its credentialing program in 1949 and the Academy of Health Information Professionals was established January 1, 1978. The program has been revised subsequently. The most recent action by MLA occurred in April 1995, when the MLA Board of Directors appointed members to the Task Force to Review the Academy of Health Information Professionals. In May 1996, the task force completed its report and recommendations to the MLA Board of Directors, who reviewed the academy in its current form and made recommendations for future goals. = AHIP membership Levels = There are five levels of membership in AHIP ‚Äì Provisional, Member, Senior Member, Distinguished Member, and Emeritus Member. Each level is based on earning points for professional activities and a series of professional competencies, which can be found online.  Governance and structure  MLA is governed by a board of directors. The president, president-elect, immediate past president, seven directors elected by the membership at large, and chairs of the Chapter and Section councils serve as voting members of the board of directors. The president serves as chair of the Board of Directors and does not vote except to make or to break a tie. The executive director serves as a nonvoting member of the Board of Directors.  Chapters  Fourteen geographic groups within the United States are currently affiliated with MLA. These chapters provide a vital link to the programs and services of the association; they are open to bot MLA members and non-members.  Sections  Twenty-three MLA sections represent the varied subfields and areas of specialization of the association's membership. Sections meet at the Annual Meeting and share information during the year through email list communication, informal networking, and newsletters. Sections sponsor contributed and invited paper sessions at the Annual Meeting. Examples of MLA Sections include: Cancer Libraries, Consumer and Public Health Information, Hospital Libraries, Medical Informatics, Nursing and Allied Health Resources, Public Health/Health Administration, Research, and Veterinary Medical Libraries.  Special interest groups  According to the MLA Section Council's Special Interest Group Manual, \\"MLA Special Interest Groups (SIGs) provide a forum for members with unique interests to identify and meet with others with similar interests without having to fulfill the governance requirements of Sections. SIGs are generally created as less formal and more flexible organizational units, with the advantages of fewer reporting and no minimum membership requirements.\\"  Committees, juries, panels and task forces  MLA depends on members with a wide range of skills and expertise to serve on its committees. Committees have varied roles in the association. The word committee includes committees required by the bylaws, committees of the Board of Directors, standing committees, subcommittees, ad hoc committees, juries, panels, and task forces. A description of these various committees is provided below: * Standing committees are continuing committees with ongoing responsibility for furthering the Medical Library Association's interests, programs, and projects. * The Executive and Nominating Committees are mandated by the bylaws. * Juries are constituted for the purpose of recommending recipients of awards, prizes, grants, and scholarships. * Panels are appointed to serve as peer-review and evaluation boards for MLA's publication and credentialing programs. * Ad hoc committees are appointed for a special purpose and are discharged when their tasks are completed. * From time to time, special task forces are appointed for a specific study.  Activities = Advocacy  Advocacy efforts for librarians and the library profession take many forms within MLA: Resources are provided to help hospital librarians communicate with other leaders in their institutions about the true value of librarians and library services, including Advocacy Toolbox: A Practical Guide to Communicating Your Value. The MLA Governmental Relations Committee is charged with developing consistency in the Association's position on information policy issues, and on governmental actions affecting medical libraries. Legislative updates on topics such as funding for library programs and services; health care reform, and copyright issues are provided. The MLA Vital Pathways Task Force reviews existing data and trends in the status of hospital librarians, collects data on the links between libraries and quality and financial outcomes, and develops action plans to influence hospital decision- makers and key leaders in the health care field.  Career development  MLA offers career services for health sciences information professionals, students attending library school programs, and those interested in learning more about a career as a medical librarian. MLA offers programs to improve the knowledge and skills of its members and provide continuing education and credentialing to its members.  Cunningham fellowship  The Cunningham Fellowship is an award for health sciences librarians from countries outside the United States and Canada. The award provides for attendance at the MLA annual meeting and observation and supervised work in one or more medical libraries in the United States or Canada.  Librarians without Borders  MLA believes that key elements in improved health for all peoples are the ability of each nation to strengthen and build health sciences information capacity through qualified health sciences librarians, implementation of supporting technological infrastructure, and access to quality information. MLA supports capacity building programs at the association, section, chapter, and individual member level. MLA believes that building capacity will be most effective and long-lasting when partnerships are created with groups sharing similar goals, particularly partnerships with international agencies where shared goals intersect with available expertise and infrastructure. MLA is an official supporting organization of Healthcare Information For All by 2015, a global initiative that aims to improve the availability and use of reliable healthcare information in low-income countries.  Oral History Project  The MLA Oral History Project is an ongoing collection of audio interviews, focused on the history of health sciences librarianship and the history of the Medical Library Association. The project started in 1977, with additional support provided by the National Library of Medicine in 1980. The project is moderated by the Oral History Committee, and printed, soft-bound volumes of edited transcripts are made available through interlibrary loan (ILL) from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, (NN/LM).  Publications and website  Journal of the Medical Library Association MLA's quarterly, peer- reviewed scholarly journal. Vols. 90- 2002- Bulletin of the Medical Library Association Vols. 1 to 89; 1911 to 2001 Biomedical Digital Libraries (2003-2007) MLA-FOCUS A bimonthly electronic newsletter for MLA members. MLA News A monthly newsletter for members and subscribers that includes news about the profession; articles that impart practical, on-the-job wisdom; and information about MLA products and services. Books Books written by medical librarians on subjects of interest to medical librarians and other health information professionals. BibKits Selective, annotated bibliographies of discrete subject areas in the health sciences literature. DocKits Collections of representative, unedited library documents from a variety of institutions that illustrate the range of approaches to library management. The association's website includes information for patients as well as librarians. The Washington Post recommended this site to patients, stating that it can help patients understand medical terminology and find the best sources of information on the Internet, but that the association's website is difficult to navigate.  Conferences and meetings  Attendees at MLA's annual meeting present and discuss scholarly papers, applied research, and issues in health sciences information management. Professionals with specific interests in related fields such as medical informatics come together to address topics of timely importance. Educational sessions are complemented by an exhibit featuring more than 100 vendors of appropriate products and services. The first MLA annual meeting was in 1898, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The most recent meeting was held in Chicago, Illinois May 3‚Äì8, 2019.

It was hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Maria Sansone (replaced by Valarie Rae Miller in Season 2). Season 5 American Gladiators grand champion Peggy Odita served as head referee. It premiered on September 17, 1994 and ran until May 11, 1996. It was often partnered with its parent show in syndication, although some markets ran it independently. Like AG, the series was produced by Four Point Entertainment, and distributed by Samuel Goldwyn Television. In response to NBC's 2008 revival of American Gladiators, the show was brought back in syndicated reruns for the 2008‚Äì2009 television season. In Gladiators 2000 two teams of two child competitors would team up with two Gladiators (one in Season 2) as coaches and compete by running through a series of events, and answering questions on various subjects along the way. While some props and sets were retained, the rules for each event were drastically altered. A British version of this show was developed, known as Gladiators: Train 2 Win. This show was co-produced by One World Entertainment then a division of MTV Networks. Food Pyramid (Pyramid) The contenders faced a pyramid made of crash mats, containing oversized foods representing each of the five steps in the food pyramid. Each team grabbed one item from each level (two from the grains group, since humans need more portions of it than the others) within 90 seconds, earning points for placing each food in a bin. Teams earned a bonus if they hit a sensor at the top of the pyramid after the food items were cleared from their half of the pyramid. Bones (Snapback, only used in Season 1) The contenders are attached to bungee cords, with each contender having an outline of a human body. A bunch of bones fell to the floor, and each contender had to grab a bone and place it on their outline, scoring 5 points for a successful placement. The Gladiators could help the kids up if the bone was too high for placement, but they couldn't tell them where it went. Assault The Gladiators had 90 seconds to make it through a course that spanned the entire arena floor length, firing off weapons to hit a target located near the Contender, while avoiding high-speed tennis balls fired at them from a cannon. The Gladiator had some protection from the contender's tennis balls, but could still be hit while in a safe zone if the shot was accurate enough. The kids shot the cannon, and after 45 seconds or 15 (out of 30) shots, the teammates switched positions. In between each safe zone, the Gladiator had to climb a rope ladder to a marked rung, walk a balance beam, and jump from circle to circle. The team got 10 points for each hit on the gladiator, The Gladiator earned 5 points for each target hit with the weapons, but if the Gladiator cheated on the obstacles between safe zones (not touching the mark on the rope ladder, not jumping to each circle, etc.), they won no points. Swingshot This event had two formats, but in both the object for the contender was to jump from a platform using a bungee cord, use their momentum to propel themselves from the floor to a cylinder with red, yellow, and blue colored scoring balls, grab one, then spring back to their platform and deposit them in a bin. Season 1: Balls were of mixed colors on 5 tiers. The contenders earned 5 points for blue (carbs), 3 points for red (proteins), 1 point for yellow (fat). All 4 contenders went at once, and they had 60 seconds to compete. Season 2: The game switched to traditional swingshot, using the lower of 2 velcro strips, and no Gladiators. Red balls were 5, Blue 3, Yellow 1, and only 2 kids went at a time. 60 seconds was still the time limit. Wall A 32-foot rock-climbing wall stood in front of the contenders in this event. The object was to make it to the top. Again, two formats were used. Season 1: Each kid had 90 seconds to climb the wall, 2 at a time. The wall was colored into zones, a different zone got the contender more points (Green 0, Blue 5, Pink 10, Purple 15, Red 20). As in AG, 10 points were awarded to the contender who could get to the top first, the second player up got five, for a possible score of 55 or 60 points. If a contender fell, they could start back up, but lost all points earned. Season 2: Similar to season 1, but only 2 climbed the wall instead of all 4, the zones were numbered, and a 5-point bonus could be earned for correctly matching some sort of trivia-of- the-day after achieving each new zone. Bonus Questions After each event, each team was asked a question about a lesson that was taught for that day (and was the basis for the events). A correct answer earned 25 points. A special bonus was used in Season 2, played after Swingshot only, and based on Powerball. The kids used their balls grabbed in Swingshot to answer questions on what was taught for the day. A list of was given, and the kid had to put the ball in the appropriate powerball cylinder (which were labelled with continents, for example) for each item in 30 seconds, tagging off after each item. 5 points were awarded for each correct answer. Eliminator This was the final event of the day, an obstacle course in which both teams took turns relay-style. The Eliminator utilized the same obstacles that the parent series did, with some exceptions. For instance, the race started with a ladder climb instead of the Versaclimber machine tower that was being used on American Gladiators. Once at the top of the ladder, the first runner used the same slide to get to a platform where, instead of the handbike the adult players used, they swung across a pit using rings. Once the pit was crossed, the first runner faced the team's first of a series of trivia questions worth 25 points. In order to choose an answer, the runner had to choose a path to take. In season one, this was a choice of either of the two spinning cylinders that were still in use on the regular series. This changed to choosing a section of a ballpit to traverse,.coinciding with the adoption of that obstacle for the parent series' final season. Instead of the normal next obstacle (scaling a cargo net then ziplining back to the floor), the runner simply jumped off the platform they crossed to and ran to a set of doors, where their partner was waiting and the second question was displayed. One of the two doors was locked, representing the wrong choice. If the first runner picked it, the team did not receive the points but the runner still got to pass through the open door to tag their partner. The third question and second-to-last obstacle awaited the partner, with the question choice represented by hanging ropes from the regular series' plexiglass wall. The partner only needed to choose the right rope to score the 25 points, and was allowed to pass by the wall if they could not scale it after three attempts. Once over the wall, the final obstacle pair of a reverse treadmill and rope swing was next. The partner received two bonafide attempts to scale the treadmill, and was allowed to scale the side if unsuccessful. Once atop the platform, the final question was asked and the partner had to choose the answer by picking one of the paper barriers to swing through on the rope. Once the first team's run was complete, the opponents got a chance to run the Eliminator. Whichever team got a faster time was awarded 50 points on top of whatever points they earned from the questions along the course, for a maximum of 150 total. The team in the lead following the Eliminator won the match and a prize package, with the opponents receiving a prize package of their own. British version A British version called Gladiators: Train 2 Win was broadcast on the CITV block of ITV between September 2, 1995 to March 13, 1998. The first series was presented by Sharron Davies and Daley Thompson, with the second series presented by various Gladiators on rotation, while the third series was presented by Margherita Taylor and Kyran Bracken, and the fourth and final series was presented by Lee Sharpe.

He is the father of the 2009 Heisman Trophy winner and Baltimore Ravens running back Mark Ingram Jr. Both were drafted in the 1st round of their respective draft classes as the 28th pick overall. Early career Ingram played high school football at Flint Northwestern High School in Flint, Michigan. In high school, Ingram played at the quarterback position with Andre Rison at halfback. He then played college football at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. At Michigan State, Ingram was moved to the position of wide receiver, where he remained throughout his collegiate and professional career. Professional career Ingram was drafted by the Giants in the first round (28th overall) in the 1987 NFL Draft. He is probably best known for a third down play in Super Bowl XXV in which he eluded at least five Buffalo Bills defenders to achieve a critical first down for the Giants to sustain a long touchdown drive. He finished the game as the Giants top receiver with five catches for 77 yards. As a Miami Dolphin, in a game against the New York Jets, Ingram caught four touchdown passes from Dan Marino. The most notable was the game-winning touchdown, which was the result of Marino faking out the Jets defense by indicating he was going to spike the ball to stop the clock. Instead, he lobbed a short pass to Ingram, who was open in the end zone. Ingram retired after the 1996 season. Legal problems On September 16, 2008, Ingram was sentenced to seven years in prison and up to five years of probation for money laundering and fraud. He was also ordered in a Long Island federal court to pay $252,000 in restitution. Ingram failed to show up to a federal prison in Ashland, Kentucky to turn himself in on December 5, 2008, and an arrest warrant was issued. On January 2, 2009, Ingram was arrested in a Flint, Michigan hotel room, where he was preparing to watch his son play in the 2009 Sugar Bowl. Alabama lost the game to the Utah Utes by a score of 31‚Äì17.http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/ny- limark035985691jan03,0,2942277.story On March 22, 2010, in a courtroom in Central Islip, New York, Ingram was sentenced to an additional two years in prison for jumping bail to see his son, Mark Ingram Jr. play for Alabama. He was housed at Yazoo City Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) as inmate 22749-050, and was then in the custody of the Residential Reentry Management Detroit. Ingram was released from prison in early 2015. Personal life In 2008, Ingram's son, Mark Ingram Jr., began his college football career as a running back for the Alabama Crimson Tide, coached by Nick Saban, who coached Mark Sr. as an assistant at Michigan State. On December 12, 2009, Mark Jr. won the Heisman Trophy. On January 7, 2010 Alabama won the National BCS Championship, and Mark Jr. received honors as Offensive MVP. On April 28, 2011 Mark Jr. was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the 1st Round (28th overall) of the 2011 NFL Draft, marking the first time a father and son were drafted with the same pick in the NFL Draft.

During the Weimar Republic, it became federal law named Deutsche Gemeindeordnung. The Nazi regime made several revisions to comply with their political and legal philosophy. The German constitution Grundgesetz written in 1949 strongly emphasised the state's authority, and as a result the enactment of the municipal code was transferred back to the states. Each German state has its own municipal code. There may be further laws like a Kommunalwahlgesetz, containing legal norms for local elections, which are also enacted by the states.

Architect: Harrie Thomas Lindberg (1916). Landscape: Percival Gallagher, Olmsted Brothers, 1919-1924 and others Nelson Doubleday (June 16, 1889 - January 11, 1949) was a U.S. book publisher and president of Doubleday Company from 1922-1946\\\\. His father Frank N. Doubleday had founded the business. His son Nelson Doubleday, Jr. followed him into it, taking part in expansion and serving as president from 1978-1986\\\\. Early life and education Nelson Doubleday was born in Brooklyn, New York to Frank Nelson Doubleday (the first Doubleday ancestor came to Boston in the early 1600s from England) (the name Doubleday is English - possibly of Norman origin originally, DuBaldy ) and Neltje Blanchan. His older brother Felix Doty was adopted, and he had a younger sister Dorothy.Moore, Joseph A. (1945, 1971 reprint). Famous Leaders of Industry, p. 34. L. C. Page & Company, Inc. In the city, the children attended a private Friends School run by Quakers. The family moved out to a large estate in Locust Valley on Long Island, called \\"Effendi\\" after their father's nickname given to him by his friend, the British author Rudyard Kipling. The author wrote his Just So Stories after the boy Nelson asked him to publish a book of animal stories.Moore (1945), p. 36. Nelson grew up in the world of book publishing, as his father had founded the Doubleday company. His mother wrote several books about gardening and birds, which were considered notable for their combination of scientific content and lyrical expression. Nelson later studied at Dr. Holbrook's Military School in Ossining, New York.http://findingaids.princeton.edu/names/28629408 He attended two years of New York University before joining his father in business, which he found more interesting. Even as a youth, he had creative solutions to business issues, for instance, suggesting selling dated magazines at a discount and thereby gaining some revenue from them.Moore (1945), Famous Leaders, pp. 39-40 Career Doubleday established his own business in 1910 and used the profits to publish books under his own imprint (now known as xxx). After serving in World War I, he joined his father's firm, Doubleday, Page and Company, as a junior partner. After the firm merged with Doran Company, and upon his father's death in 1934, Nelson Doubleday became chairman of the board of Doubleday, Doran Company, Incorporated. He remained chairman of the firm (later Doubleday and Company) until his death in 1949. With some expansion, he still maintained Doubleday as a family publishing business, with one associated book club.Ingham, John N. (1983). Biographical Dictionary of American Business Leaders, Vol. 1, p. 293. Greenwood Press. Marriage and family He married Ellen McCarter (1899-1978). Her father was an attorney who organized the Public Service Corporation in New Jersey, serving as president for its first 36 years. They had a son Nelson Doubleday, Jr. (1933-2015) and a daughter Neltje (born in 1934), named for Nelson's mother. At age 18, Neltje married John Turner Sargent, Sr., who was already working at Doubleday, and they had two children. Nelson senior died, aged 59, in Oyster Bay, Long Island. Both Sargent and Nelson Doubleday, Jr., worked for Doubleday. Beginning with Sargent in 1963, each served as president. Nelson Jr. served as president from 1978 to 1986 when, following wide changes in the publishing business, he sold the company to the German conglomerate, Bertelsmann. After the Sargents divorced in 1965, Neltje moved to Wyoming with her two children. She remarried, bought a ranch and restored and operated the historic Sheridan Inn, and became an abstract artist. In the 1980s, she created the \\"Neltje Blanchan Literary Prize\\" in honor of her paternal grandmother. In 2001, Neltje founded Jentel, an artist-in-residence program supported by her private family foundation. In 2005, Neltje received the Governor's Art Award as one of Wyoming's \\"preeminent artists.\\" In 2010, she made an estate gift of her ranch, studio, art collection and financial holdings to the University of Wyoming, the largest in its history.

Life Cratinus was victorious 27 known times, eightErich Segal The Death of Comedy (Pg.37) times at the City Dionysia, first probably in the mid-to-late 450s BCE (IG II2 2325. 50), and three times at the Lenaia, first probably in the early 430s (IG II2 2325. 121; just before Pherecrates and Hermippus). He was still competing in 423, when his Pytine took the prize at the City Dionysia; he died shortly thereafter, at a very advanced age, about 97 years (test. 3). Little is known of his personal history. His father's name was Callimedes, and he himself was a taxiarch. The Suda has brought several accusations against Cratinus. First, it accuses Cratinus of excessive cowardice. Secondly, a charge against the moral character. Thirdly, a charge of habitual intemperance. Having examined all these charges, it may be safe to say that all of these charges are unlikely enough to be true, and that there is no evidence that Cratinus really committed such things. Moreover, other writers, including Aristophanes, were silent on these charges, except the third charge, which is sustained by many passages of Aristophanes and other writers. They also refer the \\"Confession of Cratinus\\", which Cratinus himself seems to have treated the subject in a very amusing way, especially in his Pytine. That he was related to the 4th-century comic poet Cratinus Junior is a reasonable hypothesis but cannot be proven. Works Cratinus was regarded as one of the three great masters of Athenian Old Comedy (the others being Aristophanes and Eupolis). Although his poetry is several times described as relatively graceless, harsh, and crudely abusive (test. 17; 19), his plays continued to be read and studied in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. He wrote 21 comedies. 514 fragments (including ten dubia) of his comedies survive, along with 29 titles. His most famous play is the Pytine. Pytine The Pytine (The Wineflask) was Cratinus' most famous play. A grammarian describes the background of the play as follows: In 424 BC, Aristophanes produced The Knights, in which he described Cratinus \\"as a drivelling old man, wandering about with his crown withered, and so utterly neglected by his former admirers that he could not even procure to quench the thirst of which he was perishing\\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;q1=Cratinus;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=901Ar. Eq. 526-536: \\"Next, remembering Cratinus, who formerly having flowed with a full stream of praise used to flow through the level plains, and carrying away from their places, used to bear away the oaks and the plane-trees, and his enemies by the roots. And it was not permitted to sing any thing at a banquet except \\" Oh fig-sandaled Doro,\\" and \\" builders of ingenious songs;\\" so much did he flourish. But now, when you see him in his dotage, you do not pity him, since the pegs fall out, and the tone is no longer there, and the harmony is dissonant. But old as he is, he wanders about like Connas, having, it is true, a withered chaplet, but dying with thirst ; who ought to drink in the Prytaneum on account of his former victories...\\" Soon after that play, Cratinus responded by producing a play called Pytine (The Wineflask) in 423 BC, which defeated the Connus of Ameipsias and The Clouds of Aristophanes, which was produced in the same year.Aristoph. ad Equit. 528: \\"After Cratinus had heard these things (the taunts by Aristophanes), he wrote the Pytine, to show, that he did not blather about these things, which speak ill of Aristophanes, just like the things, which speak ill of Eupolis.\\" Other plays In Grenfell and Hunt's Oxyrhynchus Papyri, iv. (1904), containing a further instalment of their edition of the Behnesa papyri discovered by them in 1896-1897, one of the greatest curiosities is a scrap of paper bearing the argument of a play by Cratinus, the Dionysalexandros (i.e. Dionysus in the part of Paris), aimed against Pericles; and the epitome reveals something of its wit and point. Other plays of Cratinus include *Archilochoi (\\"The Archilochuses\\") (c. 448 BC) *Boukoloi (\\"The Cow-Herds\\") *Bousiris (\\"Busiris\\") *Deliades (\\"Women From Delos\\") *Didaskaliai (\\"The Rehearsals\\") *Drapetides (\\"Female Runaways\\") *Empipramenoi (\\"Men On Fire\\") or Idaioi (\\"The Idaeans\\") *Euneidai (\\"Children of Euneus\\") *Thrattai (\\"Women From Thrace\\") *Kleoboulinai (\\"The Cleobulines\\") *Lakones (\\"The Laconians\\") *Malthakoi (\\"The Soft Ones\\") *Nemesis (\\"Nemesis\\") *Nomoi (\\"The Laws\\") *Odysseis (\\"The Odysseuses\\") *Panoptai (\\"The All-Seers\\") *Ploutoi (\\"The Gods of Wealth\\") *Pylaia (\\"The Meeting At Pylae\\") *Satyroi (\\"Satyrs\\"), won 2nd prize at the Lenaea of 424 BCKnights, Introduction *Seriphioi (\\"Men From Seriphus\\") *Trophonios (\\"Trophonius\\") *Cheimazomenoi (\\"Storm-Tossed Men\\"), won 2nd prize at Lenaea of 425 BCAcharnians, Introduction *Cheirones (\\"The Chirons\\") *Horai (\\"The Hours\\") 462 fragments of Cratinus survive. Style The style of Cratinus has been likened to that of Aeschylus. He appears to have been fond of lofty diction and bold figures, and was most successful in the lyrical parts of his dramas, his choruses being the popular festal songs of his day. According to the statement of a doubtful authority, not borne out by Aristotle, Cratinus increased the number of actors in comedy to three.

History USS Susquehanna was named for a river which rises in Lake Otsego in central New York and flows across Pennsylvania and the northeast corner of Maryland to empty into the Chesapeake Bay. Her keel was laid down on 9 September 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation of Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 23 November 1942; sponsored by Mrs. William Lindstrom and commissioned on 7 June 1943 with Lieutenant Peter H. V. Bamberg, USNR, in command. World War II Susquehanna sailed for San Diego, California, on 25 June to begin her shakedown cruise which ended one month later. She moved up the coast to San Pedro, California, to load and, on 27 July, got underway for Australia. The tanker arrived at Townsville, Queensland, on 18 August and was attached to the Service Force, Seventh Fleet. On 4 September, she was underway for the Milne Bay area of New Guinea to service fleet units there. She returned to Australia to load cargo and aviation gas, from 23 November to 29 November, and delivered it to Milne Bay. Susquehanna operated between Australian and New Guinea ports until December 1944. She made two trips to the Netherlands East Indies and, in addition to supplying gas for large fleet units, serviced PT boats at Buna and other bases. Susquehanna departed New Guinea on 20 December 1944 with a load of cargo and fuel for Leyte, and arrived there on 26 December. She departed the Dulag transport area on 2 January 1945 for Mindoro with gasoline for the United States Army air strips. The convoy that Susquehanna was attached to, composed mostly of minesweepers, was under enemy air attack on 2 January, 3 January, and 4 January. Of four planes that attacked the convoy on 3 January, one was splashed by gunfire from Susquehanna. She sailed from the Philippines on 16 February, returned to the New Guinea operating area, and remained there until returning to Manila on 13 December 1945. She operated in the Philippine Islands until mid-August 1946. Susquehanna was transferred to the United States Army on 15 August 1946 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 23 April 1947. Korean War The tanker was reacquired and reinstated on the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1950. She was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) at that time with hull classification symbol T-AOG-5. For the next nine years, Susquehanna shuttled between ports in Japan and Korea. The tanker finally departed Yokosuka for the United States on 17 February 1959 and arrived at San Francisco, California, on 6 March. Susquehanna moved to the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet on 26 March 1959 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on that date.

The Cardinals and Tigers split the first two games in Detroit, and Detroit took two of the next three in St. Louis. But St. Louis won the next two in Detroit, including an 11‚Äì0 embarrassment in Game 7 to win the Series. The stars for the Cardinals were Joe (\\"Ducky\\") Medwick, who hit .379, a Series-high five RBI and one of St. Louis' two home runs, and the meteoric (\\"Me 'n' Paul\\") Dean brothers, Dizzy and Paul (or \\"Daffy\\") Dean, who won two games apiece with 28 strikeouts and a minuscule 1.43 earned run average. 1934 was the last World Series in which both teams were led by player-managers. The two teams have met twice in the World Series since 1934; in (Tigers won in seven) and (Cardinals won in five). Tiger pitcher Denny McLain, winner of Game 6 in 1968 (coasting home on the Tigers' record-tying ten-run second inning rally on the road), had gone 31‚Äì6 during the season, upstaging \\"Diz\\" with his mere 30‚Äì7 that year, who at 57 went onto the Tiger Stadium field in a big cowboy hat to be photographed with McLain moments after the walk-off hit that had given the latter his thirtieth win of the season. As of 2018, they are the last two 30-game winners in the major leagues. The Cardinals, led by the Dean brothers, used only six other pitchers in amassing a team earned-run average of 2.34 for their 1934 Series victory, Pete Fox played for the losing team, yet became the only player in Series history, , to hit six doubles in a World Series. For his top-of-the-sixth triple in Game 7, Joe Medwick slid hard into Tiger third baseman Marv Owen. They tangled briefly, and when Medwick went back to his position in left field for the bottom of the inning enraged Tiger fans, knowing the game was all but lost (the score was 9‚Äì0 by then), vented their frustrations on him, pelting him with fruit, vegetables, bottles and cushions among other things. It was a feat for him to make the catch of a fly ball instead of the orange thrown close to it. Commissioner Landis ordered Medwick out of the game, ending the ruckus. Newsreel footage shows Medwick slamming his glove against the dugout bench in disgust. It was the only time a Commissioner has ejected a player from any major league game, .(Audio) Dizzy Dean nearly took himself out of the Series on a play in Game 4\\\\. In the fourth inning, he pinch-ran and broke up a double play the hard way; i.e., by taking the errant relay throw to first flush on the noggin. The great Dean lay unconscious on the field. (He was later to protest, \\"Hell, it was only a glancing blow.\\") He was rushed to a hospital for observation, where he was given a clean bill of health. Legend has it that at least one newspaper the next day featured the headline, \\"X-ray of Dean's head shows nothing.\\" Be that as it may, ol' Diz recovered rapidly enough to start Game 5 (a 3‚Äì1 loss to Tiger curveballer Tommy Bridges) the very next day. According to Charles Einstein's The Fireside Book of Baseball, in the midst of the Cardinals' Game 7 rout, player-manager Frankie Frisch, the \\"Fordham Flash\\", called time and walked out to the mound from second base to warn Diz, \\"If you don't stop clowning around, I'll take you out of the game.\\" Dizzy said, \\"No you won't.\\" Frisch thought about this a moment, then retreated to second. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 The series opener in Detroit pitted the Cardinals' 30-game winner, Dizzy Dean, against the Tigers' \\"General\\" Crowder. The subpar Tiger defense behind the General let him down with five errors and three unearned runs. In the top of the second, the Gashouse Gang loaded the bases with a single and two errors; a single by Jack Rothrock then brought home both Ernie Orsatti and Dean to make it 2‚Äì0. In the third inning, St. Louis tacked on another run due to more shoddy Detroit fielding. Medwick singled and was forced out at second by Ripper Collins, but a throwing error by Tiger shortstop Billy Rogell allowed Collins to move to second and then score on another error by Detroit's star first baseman, Hank Greenberg. In the bottom of the third, Charlie Gehringer got the Tigers on the board with a single that drove in Jo-Jo White, but in the St. Louis fifth Medwick tattooed a home run off Crowder for a 4‚Äì1 Cardinal lead. The Gang then exploded for a four-run sixth off Firpo Marberry (who had relieved Crowder) and Chief Hogsett, as Pepper Martin and Medwick each cracked RBI singles and Bill DeLancey lashed a two-run double to left. Though Detroit put up single runs in the sixth and eighth (via a Goose Goslin single that scored Greenberg and a home run by Greenberg), they could get no closer, as Dean struck out Gee Walker to give St. Louis an 8‚Äì3 win and a 1‚Äì0 lead in the series. Game 2 The second game of the Series was much closer than the first, pitting the Cardinals' Bill Hallahan against the Tigers' Schoolboy Rowe. In the top of the second, St. Louis drew first blood on DeLancey's single and Orsatti's triple. They added another run in the third as a Medwick single brought in Martin, but the Tigers came back and edged them 3‚Äì2 in 12 innings. Game 3 The Tigers left 13 men on base as Pepper Martin's double, triple and two runs scored enabled the Cardinals to win, 4-1. Game 4 The Tigers evened the series, winning 10-4, with five runs in the eighth. Hank Greenberg had four hits and three RBI and Billy Rogell had four RBI. This game was the first time that the song, \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\", was played during the World Series, after being played at a high school game earlier that year in Los Angeles. Game 5 Tommy Bridges won after just one day of rest. Charlie Gehringer's home run in the sixth was the game-winning hit. Game 6 Paul Dean won his second game of the series and helped his own cause with a game-winning single in the seventh inning. Game 7 The Cardinals easily won Game 7, 11‚Äì0, behind Dizzy Dean. Ducky Medwick was taken out of the game for own safety after sliding hard into third baseman Marv Owen and being pelted by the crowd with bottles and fruit when he took the field in the sixth inning.

As a monk in Constantinople, Mark was a prolific hymnographer and a devoted Palamite. As a theologian and a scholar, he was instrumental in the preparations for the Council of Ferrara- Florence, and as Metropolitan of Ephesus and delegate for the Patriarch of Alexandria, he was one of the most important voices at the synod. After renouncing the Council as a lost cause, Mark became the leader of the Orthodox opposition to the Union of Florence, thus sealing his reputation as a defender of Eastern Orthodoxy and pillar of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Early life Mark was born Manuel in 1392 in Constantinople to George, sakellarios of Hagia Sophia, an Orthodox deacon, and Maria, the daughter of a devout doctor named Luke. Mark learned how to read and write from his father, who died while Mark and his younger brother John Eugenikos were still children. Maria had Mark continue his education under John Chortasmenos, who later became Metropolitan Ignatius of Selymbria, and a mathematician and philosopher by the name of Gemistus Pletho. Activity at the Council of Florence and aftermath Mark was the only Eastern bishop who refused to sign the agreement with the Roman Catholic Church on a compromise formula, \\"ex filio,\\" for the Filioque clause disagreement during the Council of Ferrara. He held that Rome continued in both heresy and schism. He also rejected the doctrine of Purgatory, in that he objected to the existence of a purgatorial fire that \\"purified\\" the souls of the faithful. The doctrine of \\"purgatorial fire\\" was typical of medieval Roman Catholic theology. In the end, Mark won this aspect of the discussions in the purgatorial debates, since the final formula of union omitted any affirmation of \\"fire\\" in reference to the lot of souls after their death and before the beatific vision. Death He died peacefully at the age of 52 on June 23, 1444, after an excruciating two-week battle with intestinal illness. On his death bed, Mark implored Georgios Scholarios, his former pupil, who later became Patriarch Gennadius of Constantinople, to be careful of involvement with Western Christendom and to defend Orthodoxy. According to his brother John, his last words were \\"Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, into Thy hands I commit my spirit.\\" Mark was buried in the Mangana Monastery in Constantinople. Posthumous miracle and canonization The Eugenikos family celebrated each anniversary of Mark's death with a eulogy consisting of a service (akolouthia) and synaxarion of a short life of Mark. Thanks in large part to Patriarch Gennadius Scholarius, veneration of Mark spread among the Church. In 1734 Patriarch Seraphim of Constantinople presided over the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople and solemnly glorified (canonized) Mark and added six services to the two older ones. There is an account of a posthumous miracle performed by St. Mark of Ephesus. Doctors gave up on trying to save the life of the terminally ill sister of Demetrios Zourbaios, after their efforts had worsened her condition. After losing consciousness for three days she suddenly woke up, to the delight of her brother, who asked her why she woke up drenched in water. She related that a bishop escorted her to a fountain and washed her and told her, \\"Return now; you no longer have any illness.\\" She asked him who he was and he informed her, \\"I am the Metropolitan of Ephesus, Mark Eugenikos.\\" After being miraculously healed, she made an icon of St. Mark and lived devoutly for another 15 years. Legacy The Orthodox Church considers Mark of Ephesus a saint, calling him, together with St. Photius the Great and St. Gregory Palamas, a Pillar of Orthodoxy. St. Nikodimos of the Holy Mountain, in his service to the saint, called him \\"the Atlas of Orthodoxy.\\" His feast day is January 19, the day his relics were moved to the monastery of Lazarus in Galata. Theology  Mark's theological output was extensive and covered a wide range of genres and topics typical of monastic writers. Hymnography Mark composed a wealth of poetic texts honoring God and the saints, many of which were intended for use in a liturgical setting. In addition to canons and services to Jesus Christ, the Mother of God, and the angels, Mark honored his favorite Fathers of the Church: St. Gregory Palamas, St. John Damascene, St. Symeon Metaphrastes, along with a wealth of more ancient saints. Additionally, Mark composed verses celebrating the lives and achievements of his heroes, such as Joseph Bryennios. Hesychasm Mark was a devoted disciple of Gregory Palamas. Throughout his life he composed several treatises in defense of the essence- energies distinction, and he defended the unique contributions of Hesychast theology in the face of charges of innovation. Dogmatic/polemical theology One of Mark's most important theological contributions was his opposition to the Roman Catholic Filioque. At the Council of Florence, the examination of this controversy had both text-critical and exegetical dimensions, as the participants debated the authenticity of sources, the precision of grammatical constructions, and the canon of authoritative patristic texts. Mark had played an early role in the gathering of manuscripts, and his contested readings at the synod have since been vindicated for their precision and accuracy. Echoing centuries of polemic, going back to Photius, the debates surrounding the Filioque admitted resonances of more recent discussions, such as those of John Bekkos and Gregory of Cyprus. In the end, Mark could not concede that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son as well as the Father, even by using the Orthodox phrase of \\"through the Son,\\" since Mark considered this to be an equivocation in light of the obvious theological disagreements between East and West. For Eugenikos, the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the Father, and the phrase \\"through the Son\\" did not express anything like the theology of the Filioque. Anthropology Mark's criticism of the doctrine of Purgatory, the other major topic at Florence, involved him in questions relating to the nature of the human composite. Basing himself on Palamite conceptions of man, Mark articulated a theory of the human person rooted in Christology and Orthodox doctrines of Creation. Mark's discourses at Florence are, in this regard, supplemented by writings which he produced in response to the Platonism of Gemisthus Plethon, who preached a radical identification of the human person with the soul, to the detriment of embodied life. Latin Influences The Palaiologan period in which Mark lived witnessed the translation of the works of Thomas Aquinas into Greek, an event whose repercussions have yet to be fully documented and expounded. In spite of remaining ambiguities, though, it has become increasingly clear that the Hesychasts were not unaware of Latin theology. Some scholars have hypothesized that Mark adopts Thomas Aquinas' hylomorphism in his defense of the Resurrection, and that he experiments with arguments from Thomas Aquinas' Summa contra Gentiles in order to argue for the concomitance of mercy in God's condemnation of unrepentant sinners to hell. \\"Further, Eugenicus‚Äô treatise Peri anastase√¥s (ed. A. SCHMEMANN, ‚ÄúUne ≈ìuvre in√©dite de St Marc d‚Äô√âph√®se: Peri anastase√¥s‚Äù, in: Theolog√≠a 22 (1951): 51-64; text on pp. 53‚Äì60) is merely a defence of the rational possibility of the doctrine of resurrection and a rational refutation of some philosophical objections against it based almost entirely on Thomas Aquinas‚Äô description of the natural unity of the human soul with the body in explicitly hylomorphic and anti-Platonic terms (see Summa contra Gentiles IV,79-81; cf. Vat. gr. 616, ff. 289r-294v).\\"See J.A.

What is more, Mark had a great love for Blessed Augustine of Hippo, spending money at Florence to buy manuscripts of the same. In fact, at Florence he copiously cites Augustinian and Ps.-Augustinian works approvingly as an authority in favor of Orthodoxy.G. Demacopoulos, ‚ÄúAugustine and the Orthodox: The West in the East,‚Äù in Orthodox Readings of Augustine, ed. A. Papanikolaou and E.

He used Bernard to argue for the Palamite position on the beatific vision.See Christiaan Kappes, ‚ÄúA Provisional Definition of Byzantine Theology,‚Äù Nicolaus 40 (2013): 193-194. https://www.academia.edu/4229955/A_Provisional_Definition_of_Byzantine_Theology_in_light_of_Palamite_Theologians_and_their_Sources In effect, Mark of Ephesus' liberal use of Latin authorities paved the way for the fuller synthesis of his pupil Gennadius Scholarius after his master's death.Kappes, ‚ÄúA Provisional Definition of Byzantine Theology,‚Äù 193-196 Even if Mark was initially zealous for the \\"divine work of union\\" (œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∏Œµ·øñŒøŒΩ ·ºîœÅŒ≥ŒøŒΩ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œµ·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑œÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒΩœéœÉŒµœâœÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπ·ø∂ŒΩ)Quae supersunt Actorum Graecorum Concilii Florentini. Concilium Florentinum Documenta et Scriptores Series B, vol. 5, books 1-2, ed. J. Gill (Rome: PIOS, 1953), 1: 49 (aka, Acta Graeca) in his opening speech to Pope Eugene IV, Mark was disgusted at the Latin efforts and plots to prevent him from reading the acts of the Ecumenical Councils aloud, wherein the canons prohibited additions to the Nicene- Constantinopolitan Creed. At the beginning of the Council, in the same opening speech, Mark noted that two issues alone were necessary to overcome the historical divisions between the Latin and Greek Churches; namely, (1.) The issue of the Filioque or Latins' assertion that the Father and the Son are conjointly a cause of the Holy Spirit, and (2.) the issue of unleavened bread, whereby the Latins had historically abandoned the orthodox (vs. Armenian) practice of using leavened bread for the sake of azymes. Because Mark found reasons to reject uniquely Latin authorities, councils, and texts unavailable in Greek or unapproved by jointly canonical synods, he became increasingly exasperated at Latin attempts to introduce a host of new authorities into the debates that often turned out to be spurious. In the end, Mark refused to sign the Council documents following a debate with John Montenero, OP, who claimed that there was a difference in the dignity of persons in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This had the effect of convincing Mark that the Thomists were subordinationists since the Dominican was willing to defend a distinction in the persons according to \\"dignity\\" (dignitas or axi√¥ma).see: J.L. van Dieten, ‚ÄúZur Diskussion des Filioque auf dem Konzil von Florenz,‚Äù Byzantina Symmeikta 16 (2008): 280-282. Unsurprisingly, Mark concentrated on anti-Latin propaganda by recourse to differences that were most obvious to the simple Greek populace. For example, he noted that the Latins had no throne reserved for their hierarch in the sanctuary, the Latin priests shaved their faces \\"like women celebrating Mass,\\" and various other minutiae.A. Chrysoberges, Testimonium ineditum Andreae Archiepiscopi Rhodi de Marco Eugenico, ed. G. Hoffman, Acta Academiae Velebradensis 13 (1937) 19-23 In this, Mark did not ignore various abstractions of metaphysics, yet he was more realistic and practical in his apologetics and an excellent propagandist. Therefore, one must read Mark's post-Florentine and anti-Latin propaganda through the optic of Mark's ends. Even if Mark dissented from Florence for traditional, theological motives he was quick to cite practical differences that emphasized the gulf between Latins and Greeks.

The original label was active between 1954 and 1965, after which it disappeared when its parent company, Oriole, was taken over by CBS Records. Later, between 1973 and 1980, CBS Records revived the Embassy imprint to release budget versions of albums in the UK and Europe by artists who were signed to its parent company, Columbia Records. History 1954‚Äì1965 Embassy Records was the result of a contractual arrangement between Oriole Records and Woolworths, with Embassy's product being sold exclusively through the latter's stores. Between November 1954 and January 1965, Embassy released around 1,200 songs recorded by about 150 different artists and these releases were sold for half the price of a major label release of the era. The label's releases mostly consisted of double A-side singles that were cover versions of then-current or predicted UK Top 20 hits, and it was not unusual for different artists or contrasting pop styles to appear on either side of a record. Embassy can therefore be seen as a UK equivalent of U.S. labels such as Hit and (in its early days) Bell Records. The label's product was recorded at the Embassy Recording Studios in New Bond Street, Mayfair, and manufactured by Oriole, who also licensed the material to many foreign outlets. The tight Embassy recording schedule required four different songs to be recorded in one three-hour session. Included in this standard three-hour session was the initial studio set-up time, before any actual songs were recorded, and a mandatory musicians' coffee break. This meant that on average there was a little over 30 minutes allowed for the recording of an individual song, which, in turn, meant that the artists who did the actual singing had to be first-rate professional singers who could enter a studio and record a song in very few takes. As a result, Embassy artists tended to be very experienced big band or session singers, who would also regularly broadcast live on BBC radio. Sometimes these musicians used their professional name when recording for Embassy, but very often they used pseudonyms. The recording sessions usually took place on a Thursday, so that the cover version discs could be rushed out into the stores by the following Monday to compete with the real thing. As well as releasing covers of current hit singles, Embassy Records also produced EPs of trad jazz, children's songs, light classical music, and songs from musicals. In late 1964, Embassy's parent label, Oriole, was taken over by CBS Records (Columbia Records in America). Following this purchase, the label was discontinued, with the final Embassy release of the 1960s being \\"Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow the Sun)\\" by Paul Rich and the Beatmen (b/w \\"The Special Years\\" by Burt Shane) in January 1965. By this time, the concept of budget cover version releases of current hit songs had been imitated by other labels such as Cannon, Crossbow, Top Six, and Top Pops. CBS subsidiary Hallmark/Pickwick launched the Top of the Pops series of albums a few years after the demise of Embassy, but unlike Embassy's releases, no artists were ever identified on the records. The artists The artist whose name appears on the greatest number of Embassy recordings is Paul Rich, a singer with the Lou Preager Orchestra, who recorded for Embassy between 1957 and 1965. However, the artist who actually recorded the most songs for Embassy was Ray Pilgrim. Between 1960 and 1965 he recorded almost 150 songs for the Embassy label using the pseudonyms Bobby Stevens, the Typhoons, the Jaybirds, and the Starlings. Mike Redway, who had been a singer with the Oscar Rabin Band, recorded for Embassy under the pseudonym Redd Wayne, in addition to appearing on many of the Typhoons, Jaybirds and Starlings recordings for the label between 1962 and 1965. Redway later sang the vocal version of the \\"Casino Royale Theme\\" over the closing credits of the 1967 Casino Royale film. Ken Barrie, who later became the voice of Postman Pat, recorded for Embassy under the name of Les Carle. The girl singers who made the most recordings for the label were Jean Campbell, Joan Baxter, Maureen Evans and Barbara Kay, with all but the latter recording for Embassy under their own names. Maureen Evans went on to have a hit for Oriole with \\"Like I Do\\" and Barbara Kay was one of the members of the Carefrees, who released the novelty record \\"We Love You Beatles\\" in 1964. Barbara Kay, who was yet another singer who had previously been with the Oscar Rabin Band, was usually credited as Kay Barry on Embassy releases. Instrumental recordings would feature whatever session musicians were booked for that day, so the names used for the label, such as Bud Ashton, the Beatmen and the Happy Knights, did not imply any particular participants. Similarly, the group names such as the Typhoons, the Jaybirds, and the Starlings did not imply any consistent membership and were generally made up of any musicians who were available on that particular day. Additionally, backing vocals on many Embassy releases were provided by the Mike Sammes Singers but usually went uncredited. History 1973‚Äì1980 CBS Records revived the Embassy imprint in 1973, with the slogan \\"All the Best from Embassy\\", to release budget albums of out of print, unissued, or foreign material in the UK and Europe, which had originally been released by Columbia Records (or its subsidiaries). Initially, 39 albums were released by the label in October, 1973, including titles by Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Tony Bennett, Sly & the Family Stone, Fleetwood Mac, and Blood, Sweat & Tears, among others. Many other Columbia artists had albums reissued on Embassy during the 1970s, including Johnny Mathis, the Byrds, Andy Williams, Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette, and Spirit. CBS Records once again discontinued the Embassy imprint and ceased issuing albums in the UK and Europe in 1980. However, there are known to be some Mexican Embassy releases from much later on in the 1980s.

It contains the localities Ladeira de Nossa Senhora, Portela, Outeiro Filipe, Outeiros, Cabouco de Tr√°s and S√£o Jo√µes. Geography Agualva is the largest civil parish on the island. The church of this village, Igreja Paroquial, is dedicated to the Our Lady of Guadalupe. The feast dedicated to her is celebrated beginning on the 15th of August each year. There are some mills that have been well preserved, which give Agualva beauty and charm. In this village there are lots of orchards and groves as well as an abundance of water. To the west of the village of Agualva, on the border with Quatro Ribeiras, are the twin volcanic peaks of \\"Pico Alto\\", at 807 meters,and \\"Pico Agudo\\", at 798 meters, some of the tallest mountains on the island. Along Agualva‚Äôs rivers, the Agualva River (Ribeira de Agualva) and its tributary the Filipe River (Ribiera de Filipe), there are 48 mills that formerly ground flour for the island's inhabitants. Agualva is the main civil parish that supplies the municipality of Pra√≠a da Vit√≥ria with water. Agualva‚Äôs well-irrigated and fertile land allows for large production of produce from its orchards of various fruits. Currently, the main economic activity is agro-livestock, followed by the sawing of wood thanks to the village's large forest, metal mechanics and arboriculture. About 200 years ago, Agualva was little more than a large orchard, with just a few houses. Back then, the produce cultivated in its orchards included chestnuts, walnuts, pears, apples, and oranges. Later on, this agricultural focus has changed, with the fields essentially being used only as pastures for dairy cows, including the cattle of Ramo Grande, which is a breed native to the Azores. In the past, cattle goats existed in Agualva in large numbers and would destroy and harm the natural vegetation. Because of this, Captain General Francisco Ant√≥nio de Ara√∫jo e Azevedo forced a reduction of the goat population to a minimum. Agualva, also known as the land of Ramo Grande cattle, possesses some of the best and flattest lands on the island. In 1643, these lands yielded between 500 and 600 ‚Äúmoios‚Äù of wheat as a feudal payment to the king of Portugal. History The exact date when the first inhabitants of Agualva settled in the village is unknown. It is known, however, that the settlement began sometime before the year 1588. On the 29th of February in 1588, the village of Agualva along with its parish was formally established with a documented charter. Agualva parish had previously been in the parish of Vila Nova. On February 3 of 1594, Jo√£o Homem Guadalupe established a hermitage, which would eventually become the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, its name honoring the parish's founder as well as Our Lady of Guadalupe. A letter by P√™ro Anes do Canto to the King of Portugal, dated the 16th of August 1552, makes a reference to Agualva: \\"Sir ‚Äì I have some properties in Terceira, in places they call Aguaalva and Lajes....‚Äù Of note in this mention is the spelling of \\"Aguaalva,\\" which combines the Portuguese words √°gua (water) and alva (clear). The original document is preserved in the Torre do Tombo, the Portuguese national archive in Lisbon. The village was fully operational by the end of the 16th century. This is informed by the documentation of a baptism that occurred on 18 December 1607. The document shows that the parents of the girl being baptized came from the parish of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

The state park encompasses on the southwestern shore of Squantz Pond, offering opportunities for boating, swimming, fishing, and hiking. The park is bordered on the west by Pootatuck State Forest and is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History The state park was established through the purchase of a 138-acre farm in 1926. The pond and state park are named for Chief Squantz, a leader of the Schaghticoke tribe. ;Safety concerns, drownings From 1996, when the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection began keeping records on drownings at Connecticut state parks, through 2011, fifteen people drowned at Squantz Pond State Park. In July 2007, DEP officials made \\"the Rocks\\" off limits to beachgoers. In response to the drownings and pressure from local officials, the state announced plans to reduce the parking capacity of the park from about 500 cars to about 250, and to post signs on nearby Interstate 84 announcing if the park has reached capacity. Officials said the reduced capacity would help DEP prevent swimming outside of authorized areas. On Labor Day 2007, an 18-year-old man from Queens, N.Y., became the third drowning victim of 2007 at about 1 p.m. at East Beach, an area that was not protected by lifeguards because the state DEP believed the drowning danger to be lower than other sections of the park. In June 2008, DEP unveiled several improvements to the park designed to improve the safety of swimmers. The designated beach swimming area was enlarged and clearly marked to make it more attractive to swimmers, trees were removed to improve the sight lines of on-duty lifeguards, and a dock was installed for a patrol boat. The other Squantz Pond victims drowned in the areas known as \\"the Rocks\\" and the unroped section of \\"Squantz Cove\\" that are outside the designated swimming area. These areas also were not protected by lifeguards. Activities and amenities The park offers swimming, fishing, and scuba diving as well as a launch for motorized boating. The park also has canoe and kayak rentals, picnicking facilities, and a nature center. The park's hiking trails grant access to the adjacent Pootatuck State Forest. ;Trails Look Out Point at Squantz Pond State Park From the west side, the main trail starts from the north end of the picnic area; it follows the edges of the lake‚Äôs western shoreline for 2 miles to a peninsula that juts out into the lake and has an unobstructed view of the entire lake. A green trail travels north to Worden Brook and then head southwest, passing the northern end of the yellow trail, and turns to heads eastward to the southern part of the yellow trail which continues east, back to the outgoing green trail. A shortcut can be had to shorten the green trail circular walk by taking the yellow trail south when it first appears. An unmarked trail goes along the west shoreline of Squantz Pond; old reddish-brown markers can still be seen. The trail parallels the shoreline. It is mostly a hemlock laden area with rapidly flowing streams splashing down to the lake and interesting rock formations. A little less than half-way there, an open area and rock on which to stand offer a look back at the beach at Squantz Pond State Park.

Early life and career Born in Chicago, Illinois, he started out playing music at a very early age. Having been schooled by the likes of Oscar Brown Jr., Donny Hathaway, Baby Huey and later on Curtis Mayfield, he honed his writing and singing skills and began his career, first in a band called Lyfe (which also included Chaka Khan). Khan then left and joined Rufus (scoring several pop and R&B; hits with them). Christopher later joined another band called High Voltage with future Rufus members Bobby Watson (bassist) and Tony Maiden, as well as Lalomie Washburn, who later wrote several Rufus songs. Christopher himself would also become associated with Rufus, as he penned the song \\"Once You Get Started,\\" which was later recorded by the band and hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975. He also wrote three songs on Rufus' next album, Rufus featuring Chaka Khan: \\"Dance Wit Me\\" (another big hit), \\"Fool's Paradise,\\" and \\"Have A Good Time.\\" Christopher relocated to Los Angeles, California, where he was signed to his first recording contract with Island Records. He later moved back to Chicago to record and work with Curtis Mayfield on the Curtom/RSO record label. He worked with Herbie Hancock, writing and singing on several of his albums. Christopher also penned the Hancock song, \\"Stars in Your Eyes\\". Following a move to New York City, Christopher signed with EMI Manhattan Records and scored his biggest single, \\"One Step Closer to You\\" (his only Hot 100 hit as an artist, #22 in 1986) and another major R&B; hit two years later with \\"You Are Who You Love.\\" He also produced music for artists such as Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa and The Ritchie Family, as well as mentored and worked with a young Mariah Carey prior to her getting her big break. He was heavily involved in the early hip-hop scene, writing such hits as \\"Girls Love the Way He Spins\\", \\"Sign of the Time\\", \\"We Gonna Rock America\\" and \\"All Night All Right\\". Gavin's sister is dance music vocalist Shawn Christopher. Gavin Christopher died on March 3, 2016 in Chicago of congestive heart failure at the age of 66. He is survived by his daughter Chloe Zae Jackson.

Joyner graduated from Spring Valley High School and played college football at University of Texas at El Paso. Professional career Joyner was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 8th round (208th overall) of the 1986 NFL Draft. He was actually cut in training camp, but the Eagles re-signed him later in the season. Joyner played in the NFL for the Philadelphia Eagles (1986‚Äì1993), Arizona Cardinals (1994‚Äì1996), Green Bay Packers (1997), and the Denver Broncos (1998). Joyner's unique combination of strength and quickness allowed him to excel in all defensive statistical categories and propelled him to three Pro Bowl accolades; being selected in 1991, 1993, and 1994. In one Monday Night Football game in 1991 against the Houston Oilers, Joyner, playing with a 102-degree fever, recorded 8 solo tackles, 2 forced fumbles, 2 fumble recoveries and 2 sacks. He was named NFL Player of the Year by Paul Zimmerman of Sports Illustrated that year and received runner-up honors for Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Year, while a member of the Philadelphia Eagles. As a Green Bay Packer, he appeared in Super Bowl XXXII, and the next year, he won Super Bowl XXXIII as a member of the Broncos in 1998, which turned out to be his last game.

The name \\"Subway Series\\" arose for a World Series played between two New York City teams. The series was punctuated by the Dodgers' Mickey Owen's dropped third strike of a sharply breaking curveball (a suspected spitball) pitched by Hugh Casey in the ninth inning of Game 4. The play led to a Yankees rally and brought them one win away from another championship. The Yankees were back after a one-year hiatus, having won 13 of their last 14 Series games and 28 of their last 31. This was the first Subway Series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Yankees (though the Yankees had already faced the crosstown New York Giants five times). These two teams would meet a total of seven times from 1941 to 1956 ‚Äî the Dodgers' only victory coming in 1955 ‚Äî with an additional four matchups after the Dodgers left for Los Angeles, most recently in 1981. Summary ‚Ä†: postponed from October 3 due to rain Matchups=Game 1 Joe Gordon's home run in the second inning off of Curt Davis put the Yankees up 1‚Äì0. In the fourth inning, Charlie Keller walked with two outs and scored on Bill Dickey's to extend the lead to 2‚Äì0. The Dodgers cut it to 2‚Äì1 in the fifth inning when Pee Wee Reese singled with two outs off of Red Ruffing and scored on Mickey Owen's triple. In the sixth inning, after a one-out walk and single, Gordon's RBI single made it 3‚Äì1 Yankees. After a single and error, pinch-hitter Lew Riggs' single scored Cookie Lavagetto in the seventh inning as the Dodgers pulled to within 3-2. Then they threatened in the ninth inning with hits by Joe Medwick and Pee Wee Reese, before Ruffing was able to get Herman Franks to ground into a game-ending 4-6-3 double play. Game 2 The Yankees struck first in Game 2 on Spud Chandler's RBI single in the second with runners on second and third, but Joe Gordon was thrown out at home trying to score to end the inning. Next inning, Charlie Keller's RBI single with two on made it 2‚Äì0 Yankees. In the fifth, the Dodgers loaded the bases off of Chandler with no outs on a double and two walks when Pee Wee Reese's sacrifice fly and Mickey Owen's RBI single tied the game. Next inning, an error and single put two on with no outs off of Chandler, then Dolph Camilli's single off relief pitcher Johnny Murphy in the sixth put the Dodgers up 3‚Äì2. Wyatt gave up a pinch single to George Selkirk leading off the ninth, but nailed down a complete- game victory. Game 3 With the veteran Freddie Fitzsimmons dueling young southpaw Marius Russo, there was no score into the top of the seventh. With two outs, Russo lined a drive off Fitzsimmons' knee that broke his kneecap. The ball caromed into Pee Wee Reese's glove for the third out, but Fitzsimmons was forced from the game. Hugh Casey, who came out to pitch in the eighth for Brooklyn, promptly gave up four straight one-out singles, the last two of which to Joe DiMaggio and Charlie Keller scoring a run each. The Dodgers made it a one-run game in the bottom half when Dixie Walker hit a leadoff double and scored on Pee Wee Reese's single, but Russo pitched a perfect ninth for a complete game as the Yankees won 2‚Äì1. Game 4 In Game 4, the Yankees struck first in the top of the first on Charlie Keller's RBI single with two on off of Kirby Higbe. In the fourth, they loaded the bases with no outs on a double, walk and single and two outs later, Johnny Sturm's two-run single made it 3‚Äì0 Yankees and knock Higbe out of the game. In the bottom half, Atley Donald walked two with two outs before both runners scored on Jimmy Wasdell's double. Next inning, Pete Reiser's two-run home run put the Dodgers up 4‚Äì3, but with two out, two strikes and no runners on base in the ninth, the Yankees rallied off of Hugh Casey. First Tommy Henrich swung and missed, which would have ended the game, but Dodger catcher Mickey Owen failed to catch the ball and Henrich reached first base. Owen recollected the incident: Joe DiMaggio followed with a single and Charlie Keller hit a double to drive in Henrich and DiMaggio and take the lead. Bill Dickey would follow up with a walk and, along with Keller, score on a Joe Gordon double to make the final score 7‚Äì4. Johnny Murphy pitched two shutout innings to close the game as the Yankees were one win away from the championship. Meyer Berger of The New York Times covered the events in \\"Casey in the Box\\", a poem derived from the 1888 classic \\"Casey at the Bat\\".\\"Casey in the Box by Meyer Berger\\". Baseball Almanac (baseball- almanac.com). Retrieved 2013-11-09. Game 5 In the fifth inning, Whit Wyatt and Joe DiMaggio almost came to blows on the mound as DiMaggio returned to the dugout after flying out. Tiny Bonham pitched a complete game 4-hitter, allowing only one hit and one walk after the third inning. In the second, with runners on first and third, a wild pitch by Wyatt and RBI single by Joe Gordon made it 2‚Äì0 Yankees. Pete Reiser's sacrifice fly in the third with two on cut it to 2‚Äì1, but the Yankees got that run back in the fifth on Tommy Henrich's home run. The Dodgers hit only .182 as a team, contributing to their 5-game loss. Composite box 1941 World Series (4‚Äì1): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.) Aftermath In 1947 the Yankees and Dodgers would meet in the World Series for the second time and again play a dramatic Game 4 which was decided on a lead change with two outs in the ninth inning. That time the Dodgers would be on the winning side to tie the series but would once again end up losing it. Ironically, in the 1947 game the Dodgers‚Äô winning pitcher was none other than Hugh Casey ‚Äì the Game 4 loser in 1941 ‚Äì even though he pitched to only one batter.https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/BRO/BRO194710030.shtml NotesReferencesExternal links *Baseball's 25 Greatest Moments ranked #23 by The Sporting News in 1999 World Series World Series New York Yankees postseason Brooklyn Dodgers postseason World Series October 1941 sports events Sports competitions in New York City ","title":"1941 World Series"},{"id":"1332173","text":"Valley View may refer to: Places * Valley View, Ooty, India * Valley View, South Australia, Australia United States * Valley View, Kentucky * Valley View, Ohio * Valley View, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania * Valley View, York County, Pennsylvania * Valley View, Texas * Valley View (Carterville, Georgia), listed on the NRHP in Georgia * Valley View (Romney, West Virginia), a 19th-century Greek Revival residence and farm * Valley View Site, Medary, Wisconsin, listed on the NRHP in Wisconsin Schools * Valley View Middle School (disambiguation) * Valley View High School (disambiguation) * Valley View Public School (disambiguation) * Valley View School (Salida, Colorado), in the National Register of Historic Places listings in Chaffee County, Colorado * Valley View Local School District Other uses * Valley View Center, a mall in Dallas, Texas, US * Valley View Farm, Harriman, Tennessee, US listed on the NRHP in Tennessee * Valley View Mall (Roanoke, Virginia), US See also * Valley View Ferry, Kentucky, US * Valleyview (disambiguation) ","title":"Valley View"},{"id":"1332174","text":"Vernon Township may refer to: Illinois * Vernon Township, Lake County, Illinois Indiana * Vernon Township, Hancock County, Indiana * Vernon Township, Jackson County, Indiana * Vernon Township, Jennings County, Indiana * Vernon Township, Washington County, Indiana Iowa * Vernon Township, Dubuque County, Iowa, in Dubuque County, Iowa * Vernon Township, Humboldt County, Iowa * Vernon Township, Palo Alto County, Iowa * Vernon Township, Van Buren County, Iowa * Vernon Township, Wright County, Iowa Kansas * Vernon Township, Cowley County, Kansas Michigan * Vernon Township, Isabella County, Michigan * Vernon Township, Shiawassee County, Michigan Minnesota * Vernon Township, Dodge County, Minnesota Missouri * Vernon Township, Clark County, Missouri New Jersey * Vernon Township, New Jersey North Dakota * Vernon Township, Kidder County, North Dakota, in Kidder County, North Dakota * Vernon Township, Walsh County, North Dakota Ohio * Vernon Township, Clinton County, Ohio * Vernon Township, Crawford County, Ohio * Vernon Township, Scioto County, Ohio * Vernon Township, Trumbull County, Ohio Oklahoma * Vernon Township, Kay County, Oklahoma Pennsylvania * Vernon Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania South Dakota * Vernon Township, Beadle County, South Dakota, in Beadle County, South Dakota * Vernon Township, Grant County, South Dakota, in Grant County, South Dakota See also *Vernon (disambiguation) Township name disambiguation pages ","title":"Vernon Township"},{"id":"1332177","text":"West Salem is the name of several places in the United States: * West Salem, Illinois * West Salem, Ohio * West Salem, Salem, Oregon, the Polk County portion of Salem * West Salem, Wisconsin * West Salem Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania See also * Salem (disambiguation) * New Salem (disambiguation) ","title":"West Salem"},{"id":"1332178","text":"West Springfield may refer to: * West Springfield, Massachusetts, United States * West Springfield, Virginia, United States * West Springfield, a fictional location in The Simpsons episode \\"Half-Decent Proposal\\" ","title":"West Springfield"},{"id":"1332179","text":"A winter garden is a garden where winter-hardy plants are grown for winter decoration or to be harvested for food between winter and early spring.

SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Chief Bender allowed the Cubs just three hits and one unearned run. Frank Baker had three hits and two RBI for the A's. Game 2 Game 2 Jack Coombs pitched erratically, allowing eight hits and walking nine, but still picked up the win. The Cubs left 14 men on base, a Series record at that time. The A's combed Mordecai Brown for 13 hits, including four doubles in a six-run seventh that put the game away. Game 3 The Athletics rapped out 16 hits, winning easily 12-5. Jack Coombs gave up 5 runs but won his second game of the series. Game 4 The Cubs were trailing 3‚Äì2 in the bottom of the ninth, three outs away from being swept by the A's, but tied it on Frank Chance's triple and won it in the tenth on Jimmy Sheckard's single. Game 5 Jack Coombs became the third pitcher in World Series history to win 3 games without a loss. Babe Adams did it the year before, but in seven games, and Christy Mathewson accomplished the feat in the 1905 Series. This was the A's first World Series title.

Philadelphia third baseman Frank \\"Home Run\\" Baker earned his nickname during this Series. His home run in Game 2 off Rube Marquard was the margin of victory for the Athletics, and his blast in Game 3 off Christy Mathewson tied that game in the ninth inning, and the Athletics eventually won in the 11th. The Giants never recovered. Ironically, Mathewson (or his ghostwriter) had criticized Marquard in his newspaper column after Game 2 for giving up the gopher ball, only to fall victim himself the very next day. Baker was swinging a hot bat in general, going 9 for 24 to lead all batters in the Series with a .375 average. According to his obituary in The New York Times (July 28, 1971), Giants catcher Chief Meyers threw out 12 runners, creating a record for the most assists by a catcher during the World Series. The six consecutive days of rain between Games 3 and 4 caused the longest delay between World Series games until the earthquake-interrupted 1989 Series (which incidentally featured the same two franchises, albeit on the West Coast, and which also resulted in an A's victory over the Giants). With the sixth and final game being played on October 26, this was also the latest- ending World Series by calendar date until the 1981 Series. Summary John McGraw and Christy Mathewson during the 1911 World Series Matchups=Game 1 With a perfect top of the first, Christy Mathewson set the record with 28 straight shutout innings in World Series play, a record that would be broken by Boston Red Sox's Babe Ruth with 29‚Öî innings in the 1918 World Series. Mathewson's postseason record for consecutive scoreless innings against one team would not be broken until 2013 when the Detroit Tigers' Justin Verlander shut out the Athletics (now playing in Oakland) for 30 consecutive innings in the 2012 and 2013 ALDS. Game 2 With the score tied at 1 and with Eddie Collins on second, Frank Baker blasted a two-run home run off Rube Marquard to deep right field for the go ahead score and the Athletics held on to win game 2, 3‚Äì1. Game 3 Frank Baker in 1913 With the Giants up 1‚Äì0 going into the ninth with Mathewson on the mound, it appeared the series was going to be 2‚Äì1 New York. But with one out, Baker stepped up to the plate and blasted his second home run in as many games to tie it at 1. Thus, the nickname \\"Home Run\\" Baker was born. Two innings later with the score still tied at 1, Baker singled and scored on an error to make it 3‚Äì1. The Giants rallied for one run in the bottom half but the game ended with a runner being thrown out on a stolen base attempt. Game 4 Chief Meyers and Chief Bender during the 1911 World Series After six days of rain, the series resumed. Chief Bender, after giving up two runs in the first, shut out the Giants the rest of the way on his way to a 4‚Äì2 win and 3‚Äì1 series lead. Game 5 On the verge of elimination, the Giants fought back. They tied it at 3 with two runs in the bottom of the ninth, and then won it with a run in the tenth when Larry Doyle scored on a sacrifice fly. Home plate umpire Bill Klem later said Doyle had failed to touch home plate after sliding in. Since none of the Athletics noticed this and Philadelphia failed to appeal, Klem had to let the winning run stand. Game 6 Bender threw a 4-hitter to clinch the series, the Athletics second consecutive World Series title. The A's pitching staff held the Giants to a .175 team batting average, lowest ever for a 6-game series.

This series, featuring close games and controversial decisions, was regarded as one of the most exciting World Series of its era. Nearly all of the games were close. Four games in this Series were decided by one run. A fifth ended in a tie. A sixth was decided by two runs. Game 7 was the only one with a margin greater than three runs. Two games, including the decisive Game 8, went to extra innings. In Games 1 and 3, the losing team had the tying and winning runs on base when the game ended. The series showcased star pitching from Giant Christy Mathewson and Red Sox fireballer Smoky Joe Wood. Wood won two of his three starts and pitched in relief in the final game. In the deciding game, Boston rallied for two runs in the tenth inning thanks to two costly Giants fielding misplays. This was one of only four World Series to go to eight games, and the only best-of-seven Series to do so. While the 1912 Series was extended to eight games due to a tie game being called on account of darkness, the , , and 1921 World Series were all best-of-nine affairs that happened to run eight games. Summary Managers John McGraw and Jake Stahl during the 1912 World Series Matchups=Game 1 Polo Grounds crowd at Game 1 In batting practice before Game 1, Tris Speaker drove a ball not only over the right field grandstand but completely out of the Polo Grounds. The Series opened with the Red Sox as 10‚Äì8 betting favorites. Giants manager John McGraw surprised everyone by starting rookie Jeff Tesreau rather than the great Christy Mathewson against Boston ace Smoky Joe Wood. He preferred to save Mathewson for Game 2 and the hostile crowd at Fenway Park. New York struck first. Josh Devore walked with one out in the third, and advanced to third base on a single by Larry Doyle lost in the sun by Duffy Lewis. After Fred Snodgrass struck out, Red Murray's single scored Devore and Doyle for a 2‚Äì0 Giants lead. Tesreau and his spitball held the Red Sox hitless for the first five innings, but Boston then cut the lead to 2‚Äì1 in the sixth on a triple by Tris Speaker that fell to the ground untouched when neither Snodgrass nor Devore called for the ball (in an Alphonse-Gaston act), and an RBI groundout by Lewis. The Red Sox scored three runs in the very next inning, on an RBI double by Harry Hooper and a two-run single by Steve Yerkes, after Giants second baseman Doyle had muffed Wood's potential inning-ending double play grounder and had to settle for the one out at second. In the bottom of the ninth, the Giants scored a run and had the tying run on third and the winning run on second, but Wood, a spectacular 34‚Äì5 in the regular season, struck out the last two batters for the 4‚Äì3 Boston win in a complete game with 11 strikeouts. Oddly, McGraw let relief pitcher Doc Crandall bat for himself for what turned out to be the last out rather than using backup catcher Art Wilson to pinch-hit. After the game Wood said, \\"I threw so hard I thought my arm would fly right off my body.\\" Game 2 Christy Mathewson in 1910 Christy Mathewson later said of the moment when he took the mound at Fenway Park, \\"This was the only place in the world that I wanted to be. I could think of nothing greater than pitching this game for the glory of the New York Giants.\\" An error by Giants shortstop Art Fletcher led to three first-inning unearned Boston runs off Mathewson. Single tallies in the second and fourth by the Giants cut the lead to 3‚Äì2. Another error by Fletcher, who failed to tag Harry Hooper on a stolen base attempt, led to a fourth Boston run in the fifth when Yerkes followed the error with an RBI triple. In the top of the eighth Boston returned the favor, allowing New York to strike back for three runs. Left field at brand-new Fenway Park was unique for a incline in front of the wall (later to be called \\"The Green Monster\\"). Red Sox left fielder Duffy Lewis was so proficient at negotiating this incline that it was first named \\"Duffy's Cliff\\" in his honor, but this time Lewis tripped on the hill and failed to catch Fred Snodgrass' fly ball, putting him on first base. He scored on Murray's double, and two batters later third baseman Buck Herzog hit a two-run double to give New York a 5‚Äì4 lead. The Giants' lead was brief. Lewis doubled in the bottom of the eighth, and then Fletcher's terrible day continued with his third error allowing Larry Gardner to reach base and Lewis to score. This tied the game at 5. In the ninth, Boston reliever Charley Hall, who had replaced Ray Collins in the eighth, got the first two outs but proceeded to walk Snodgrass, Larry Doyle and Beals Becker consecutively. But with the bases loaded, Red Murray grounded into a forceout and the Red Sox escaped. Boston went quietly in the bottom of the ninth, setting up extra innings. Fred Merkle led off the New York tenth with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly to give the Giants a 6‚Äì5 lead. Mathewson, who pitched the entire game for New York, came back to the mound in the bottom of the tenth with a chance to slam the door on Boston and even the Series at one game apiece, but Tris Speaker, who had hit .383 in the regular season, slammed an extra-base hit to center field. Giant third baseman Buck Herzog deliberately collided with Speaker to prevent an inside-the-park home run, but Speaker got up and came home anyway. Becker threw the ball in to cutoff man Tillie Shafer, who threw to the plate but catcher Art Wilson dropped the ball‚Äîfor New York's fifth error of the game‚Äîand Speaker, who was credited with a triple on the play, scored to tie it at 6. McGraw claimed, and reporters in the press box agreed, that Speaker had missed first base, but base umpire Cy Rigler ruled that he hadn't on appeal. Lewis followed with a double to put the winning run in scoring position, but Mathewson retired Gardner and Stahl to escape the inning with a tie. New York had one last chance in the top of the 11th. Snodgrass led off the inning by being hit by a pitch, but was then thrown out attempting to steal second. After Doyle struck out, Becker drew a walk but was also thrown out on an attempted steal of second, ending the inning. After the Red Sox went down in order in the bottom of the eleventh, the game was called on account of darkness tied at 6, Boston retaining a 1‚Äì0 lead in the Series. Baseball's National Commission ruled that the players would still get a share of the gross receipts from only the first four games despite the Game 2 tie, a decision which caused much discontent among the players. Game 3 Smoky Joe Wood and Rube Marquard during the 1912 World Series In the top of the second, Red Murray doubled to center. He advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt by Merkle and scored on a sacrifice fly by Herzog, giving the Giants a 1‚Äì0 lead. Three innings later, Herzog doubled and scored on a single by Fletcher, stretching New York's lead to 2‚Äì0. It stayed that way until the bottom of the ninth. Rube Marquard, who pitched a complete game for the Giants, got Speaker to pop up to start the inning. Lewis followed with a grounder to first baseman Merkle, who flipped to Marquard covering first, but Marquard couldn't find the bag and Lewis reached with an infield single. Gardner followed with an RBI double, narrowing the Giant lead to 2‚Äì1. First baseman / playing manager Jake Stahl grounded to Marquard, who threw out Gardner at third base for the second out as Stahl took first. Manager Stahl then took himself out of the game for pinch-runner Olaf Henriksen. The next Boston hitter, Heinie Wagner, reached on an error by Merkle, with Henriksen, representing the tying run, advancing to third. Wagner, the potential winning run, then stole second to get into scoring position but the next batter, Hick Cady, lined out to right field to end the game. Although Josh Devore missed the ball with his glove, he managed to catch it with his bare left hand, allowing the Giants to hang on for a 2‚Äì1 victory and even the series at a game apiece. Game 4 The Red Sox won 3‚Äì1 on Wood's complete game, eight- strikeout effort. Boston took a 1‚Äì0 lead when Gardner tripled in the second and scored on a wild pitch by Tesreau, who had lost the nail on the middle finger of his right (pitching) hand when a Harry Hooper grounder ripped it off in the first. Boston made it 2‚Äì0 on an RBI single by Cady in the fourth. In the seventh, Herzog singled and scored on Fletcher's double to cut the lead to 2‚Äì1, but in the top of the ninth, Wood helped his own cause with an RBI single. The Giants went down in order in the bottom of the ninth to give Boston a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Game 5 The Red Sox scored two quick runs in the bottom of the third against Mathewson when Hooper led off with a triple, Yerkes also tripled, and Speaker reached on an error by Giants second baseman Doyle allowing Yerkes to score. Mathewson then proceeded to retire the next 17 Red Sox batters in a row, but that was all Boston pitcher Hugh Bedient needed. Merkle doubled and came around to score in the seventh inning to make the score 2‚Äì1, but Mathewson struck out to end the rally. Bedient retired the last seven Giant hitters in order for a three-hit complete game. Boston now led the Series 3‚Äì1, and was one victory away from a championship. Game 6 Buck O'Brien in 1912 Boston pitcher Buck O'Brien, who had pitched well in Game 3 but lost to Marquard, started again in Game 6 and was shelled for five runs in the bottom of the first inning. After left fielder Devore led off the inning with a groundout, Doyle singled and Snodgrass struck out, five Giants hitters in a row hit safely, with Buck Herzog scoring on a steal of home. The inning didn't end until O'Brien picked Fletcher off first base. Marquard took over from there, throwing a complete game for his second victory of the series, and the Giants won 5‚Äì2. New York stayed alive, but Boston still led the series 3‚Äì2. Buck O'Brien started this game over Red Sox ace Wood at the insistence of Red Sox owner Jimmy McAleer, over the protests of Boston manager Stahl. Disgruntled Red Sox players believed their own front office was trying to extend the series and gather more box office receipts by starting a weaker pitcher. O'Brien, meanwhile, was not told he was pitching until the morning of the 14th, too late to prevent him from going out drinking and starting Game 6 with a hangover. Game 7 Smoky Joe Wood in 1915 Wood, who had pitched and won Games 1 and 4 for the Red Sox, started Game 7 with a chance to win Boston's second championship. But in a replay of Game 6, the Giants blew the game open in the first inning. Seven of the first nine Giants batters reached base, and six of them scored. Wood faced ten batters, threw them only 13 pitches and retired only one of them, with the first out coming on a sacrifice and the third when Giant starter Tesreau was caught stealing second. New York cruised from there, winning the only truly lopsided game of the series 11‚Äì4. This game featured two \\"bounce\\" home runs, one from Gardner of the Red Sox and another from Doyle of the Giants. This type of play, where a ball lands in fair territory and goes over the wall on a bounce, was changed by rule to a ground rule double in 1931. Game 7 also featured an extremely rare unassisted double play by an outfielder. Tris Speaker, who was known for playing very shallow in center field, caught a liner by Fletcher with one out in the top of the ninth inning and ran in, stepping on second to double off Wilson. The game was delayed because of a demonstration by the Royal Rooters, the primary Red Sox fan organization of the day, because their normal seats on Duffy's Cliff had been double-sold to other fans. The Royal Rooters were lined up along the left field foul line since they had indeed paid their way in. They were not satisfied, however. Their leader, Michael \\"Nuf Ced\\" McGreevy, led a further demonstration after the game in front of the Red Sox offices and called for a boycott of Game 8. Wood's awful start, the fact that he'd continued to pitch with a full windup instead of going into the stretch position with Giants on base, and the sloppy play of the Red Sox led to ugly rumors. Boston fans and respected sportswriter Tim Murnane each believed that the Boston players, angry that they didn't get a cut from the gate receipts for Game 2 and further alienated by O'Brien's Game 6 start, bet on the Giants to make their losses good. Whatever went down, the Series was tied at 3, setting up a decisive Game 8 for the championship. Game 8 Tris Speaker in 1912 The location of this game was determined by a coin flip, which the Red Sox won. Because this game was scheduled at the last minute as a makeup of the Game 2 tie, and due as well to the game-fixing rumors and the Royal Rooters' boycott, the riveting finale of the 1912 World Series was played to a half-capacity crowd at Fenway. Mathewson started for the Giants, and Bedient for the Red Sox. In the Giants' third inning, Devore led off with a single, advanced on groundouts by Doyle and Snodgrass, and scored on Murray's RBI double. New York held on to the 1‚Äì0 lead until the bottom of the seventh inning, when Stahl singled with one out and Heinie Wagner drew a walk. Henriksen pinch-hit for pitcher Bedient and doubled to left to tie the game at one, but Hooper flied out to center to end the rally. Smoky Joe Wood, who had taken a pounding the day before for Boston, replaced Bedient in relief. Wood and Mathewson, still pitching for the Giants, matched zeroes in the eighth and ninth innings, and the game went to extra innings tied 1‚Äì1. In the top of the tenth, Murray doubled with one out and scored on an RBI single from Merkle. Wood struck out Herzog and got the Giant catcher, Chief Meyers, to ground out to end the inning, but the game went to the bottom of the tenth with the Giants leading 2‚Äì1 and three outs away from a World Series victory. Clyde Engle, pinch-hitting for Wood, led off with an easy fly ball to Fred Snodgrass in center field. Snodgrass dropped the ball, and Engle reached second base. The next day's New York Times described the play as follows: \\"And now the ball settles. It is full and fair in the pouch of the padded glove of Snodgrass. But he is too eager to toss it to Murray and it dribbles to the ground.\\" Hooper flied out to deep center‚ÄîSnodgrass making a fine running catch right after his error‚Äîbut Engle advanced to third. Yerkes was then inexplicably walked by control expert Mathewson, putting the winning run on base. Tris Speaker, who hit an even .300 in the 1912 World Series, lifted a foul pop on the first base side, but first baseman Merkle, pitcher Mathewson, and catcher Meyers allowed the ball to fall untouched in foul territory. Snodgrass later claimed that the Red Sox bench jockeys had disrupted the players' timing. Strangely, Mathewson called for catcher Meyers to take it even though Merkle was closer. Meyers couldn't reach it and it fell to the ground. Speaker then shouted, \\"Well, you just called for the wrong man and it's gonna cost you the ball game!\\" Given new life, he singled home Engle to tie it at 2, Yerkes advancing to third. Mathewson walked Lewis intentionally, loading the bases and setting up a force at every base, but the next hitter, Larry Gardner, flied to Devore in right field deep enough for Yerkes to tag up and score, and the Red Sox won the 1912 World Series. Legacy Boston Brave in 1916 Fred Snodgrass‚Äôs error went down in history as \\"the $30,000 muff\\", a reference to the difference in the winning and losing shares, $29,514.34. After the series Snodgrass tried to explain, saying \\"I didn't seem to be able to hold the ball. It just dropped out of the glove, and that was all there was to it.\\" Christy Mathewson later wrote that \\"As I look back upon the 1912 series, when we lost to the Boston Red Sox, I see it was the same. Pitchers, outfielders, the whole team collapsed under the strain.\\" He had been ill-served by his team's defense. Five New York errors led to all six runs' being unearned in the Game 2 tie, an error scored the second run in Boston's 2‚Äì1 Game 5 victory and Snodgrass's $30,000 muff, along with the failure to catch Speaker's foul pop, resulted in the loss in Game 8. Mathewson started three games, completed all three and compiled a 0.94 earned-run average for the Series, but was charged with two losses and a no-decision for his efforts. The 1912 World Series was the second of three consecutive Fall Classic appearances for the Giants, all of which they lost, and Mathewson retired in 1916 with the 1905 championship the only one of his brilliant career, in which he pitched three complete-game shutouts for 27 scoreless innings, Series records that may never be equaled. After the Series was over, McAleer issued a statement apologizing to the Royal Rooters for selling their Game 7 seats out from under them. The Red Sox victory in 1912 marked the beginning of the most successful run in franchise history. Between 1912 and 1918, they played in four World Series and won all of them. But after star pitcher/outfielder Babe Ruth was sold to the Yankees following the 1919 season, Boston had to wait 28 years for its next pennant and 86 years for its next World Series victory. The 1912 World Series was the first to be decided in the last inning of the final game. It was also the first Series where a team within one inning of losing came back to win. The next time a team that close to elimination recovered to win was the 1985 World Series, when the Kansas City Royals rallied in the bottom of the ninth to beat the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 6, then won Game 7 and the championship. Other World Series that have ended with a Game 7 (or in this case Game 8, due to the tie) going to extra innings include the Series of , , , and . Other World Series won by the home team in its last at-bat in a Game 7 include the Series of 1924, , 1991, 1997, and . It was at Game 4 of this Series that the World Series drew its 1,000,000th fan. The total attendance for this Series of 252,037 shattered the previous mark of 179,851 set the previous year, though the fact that this World Series went eight games, compared to six in 1911, was the difference. The total attendance record for this Series would stand as a record until 1921, when 269,977 attended the 1921 World Series, the first with Babe Ruth as an everyday player. Like this World Series, the 1921 World Series also went eight games, though unlike this World Series, which was a best-of-seven, the 1921 World Series was a best-of-nine. The 1912 World Series was discussed at length in the 1966 book The Glory of Their Times, which featured interviews with Harry Hooper, Rube Marquard, Chief Meyers, Fred Snodgrass, and Smoky Joe Wood. The 1913 Spalding's Official Baseball Guide said of the 1912 World Series, \\"No individual, whether player, manager, owner, critic or spectator, who went through the world's series of 1912 ever will forget it. There never was another like it. Years may elapse before there shall be a similar series and it may be that the next to come will be equally sensational, perhaps more so.\\" Composite line score 1912 World Series (4‚Äì3‚Äì1): Boston Red Sox (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)

In 1997, Chmura chose not to meet with United States President Bill Clinton at the White House following the Packers Super Bowl XXXI win. While many claimed that this was because Chmura was a staunch Republican, the meeting fell on the same day as the annual Mike Utley golf tournament. The tournament is something that Chmura had played in every year since 1992 to honor former Detroit Lion player Mike Utley who had been paralyzed on the field. =Release= Chmura suffered a career-ending herniation of his C5 and C6 discs in his cervical spine.

The A's pitching gave the edge to a closer-than-it-looked Series in 1913. Christy Mathewson lost his Series swan song in the final game to an old college rival and eventual fellow Baseball Hall of Fame member, Eddie Plank. The Giants thus became the first National League team since the Chicago Cubs (‚Äì) to win three consecutive pennants. They were also the second club (following the Detroit Tigers ‚Äì) to lose three consecutive World Series; and remain the last to do so. The Series itself was a face-off between two teams that later became crosstown rivals in Oakland and San Francisco. The Oakland A's won again in a four-game sweep in the 1989 World Series, famous for the earthquake that struck before Game 3, which is the last World Series victory for the A's. Summary right Matchups=Game 1 In the opener, Home Run Baker drove in three runs with three hits for the A's, including a home run. Eddie Collins went 3-for-3 and scored three runs. Despite giving up four runs and 11 hits, Chief Bender held on for a 6‚Äì4 win. The Giants struck first in the bottom of the third when Fred Merkle hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Larry Doyle's single, but in the fourth, Eddie Collins hit a leadoff triple and scored on Baker's single. After a fielder's choice and double, Wally Schang's triple scored two more runs. Baker's two-run home run after a walk in the fifth made it 5‚Äì1 Philadelphia. The Giants cut the lead to 5‚Äì4 in the bottom of the inning when after two singles and a groundout, an error Doyle's ground ball, Art Fletcher's RBI single, and George Burns's groundout scored a run each. The A's got an insurance run in the eighth off of Doc Crandall on Stuffy McInnis's RBI double. Game 2 Mathewson and Plank matched craft and guile. In the bottom of the ninth inning of a scoreless game, the Giants put on a stirring baseball version of the \\"goal-line stand\\". With none out, the A's had Amos Strunk on third and Jack Barry on second. The next batter, Jack Lapp, grounded to first, where Hooks Wiltse, a pitcher, was filling in. Wiltse made a good stop and threw home to nab Strunk. With Barry on third now and Lapp on first, Plank grounded to Wiltse and Hooks fired home again, getting a sliding Barry. Mathewson retired the next hitter, and the game went into extra innings. In the top of the tenth the Giants broke the ice with three runs, with Mathewson singling in the winning run after a leadoff single and sacrifice bunt and then completing the extra-inning shutout by retiring the A's in their half of the tenth. After Mathewson's single, an error and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before Art Fletcher drove in two insurance runs with a single. Game 3 Brush Stadium before Game 3 of the World Series Game 4 at Shibe: Doc Crandall at the plate, Chief Bender on the hill Eddie Collins had three hits and three RBI, and Bullet Joe Bush threw a five-hitter to put the A's ahead in the series. Jeff Tesreau allowed three straight one-out singles in the first, the last of which to Home Run Baker scoring a run. After a double steal and strike out, and error on Amos Strunk's ground ball scored two more runs. The A's made it 5‚Äì0 next inning on Eddie Collins's two-run single. The Giants got on the board in the fifth when Red Murray drew a leadoff walk, stole second, moved to third on an error and scored on Larry McLean's single. The A's added to their lead in the seventh when Collins's triple and Home Run Baker's single scored a run each. The Giants scored their last run of the game in the bottom of the inning when Tillie Shafer hit a leadoff double and scored on Red Murray's single.. Wally Schang's home run in the eighth off of Doc Crandall closed the scoring at 8‚Äì2 A's. Game 4 The home team won for the first time in the series, although the visiting Giants made it close in the late innings. Wally Schang had four RBI for the A's, they now had a 3‚Äì1 series lead. Just like in Game 1, Bender struggled but went the distance for his second win of the series. The A's struck first in the bottom of the second when Stuffy McInnis hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Jack Barry's double. In the fourth, Wally Schang's single scored two and an error on Chief Bender's ground ball scored another. Next inning, after a two-out walk and double off of Rube Marquard, Wally Schang's two-run double made it 6‚Äì0 A's. The Giants were kept off the scoreboard until Fred Merkle's three-run home run in the seventh. They cut Philadelphia's lead to 6‚Äì5 next inning when George Burns's double and Tillie Shafer's triple scored a run each, but could not score again. Game 5 Plank led the Athletics to victory, allowing the Giants only two hits, but his own error in the fifth inning cost him a shutout. The A's scored a run in the first on Home Run Baker's sacrifice fly with runners on first and third, then scored two more in the third on Baker's single and Stuffy McInnis's sacrifice fly. The Giants avoided a shutout in the fifth on Larry McLean's RBI single. This was the A's third series title in four years. They had also won in 1910 and 1911.

The 65th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff between American League (AL) champion Detroit Tigers and the National League (NL) champion (and defending World Series champion) St. Louis Cardinals. The Tigers won in seven games for their first championship since 1945, and the third in their history. The Tigers came back from a three-games- to-one deficit to win three consecutive games, largely on the arm of Mickey Lolich, who was named World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP); , he remains the last pitcher to earn three complete-game victories in a single World Series. In his third appearance in the Series, Lolich had to pitch after only two days' rest in the deciding Game 7, because regular-season 31-game winner Denny McLain was moved up to Game 6 ‚Äì also on two days' rest. In Game 5, the Tigers' hopes for the title would have been in jeopardy had Bill Freehan not tagged out Lou Brock in a home plate collision, on a perfect throw from left fielder Willie Horton, when Brock elected not to slide and went in standing up. The 1968 season was tagged \\"The Year of the Pitcher\\", and the Series featured dominant performances from Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson, MVP of the 1964 and 1967 World Series. Gibson came into the World Series with a regular- season earned run average (ERA) of just 1.12, a modern era record, and he pitched complete games in Games 1, 4, and 7. He was the winning pitcher in Games 1 and 4. In Game 1, he threw a shutout, striking out a Series record 17 batters, besting Sandy Koufax's 1963 record by two; it still stands as the World Series record today. In Game 4, a solo home run by Jim Northrup was the only offense the Tigers were able to muster, as Gibson struck out ten batters. In Game 7, Gibson was defeated by series MVP Lolich, allowing three runs on four straight hits in the seventh inning, although the key play was a Northrup triple that was seemingly misplayed by center fielder Curt Flood and could have been the third out with no runs scoring. The World Series saw the Cardinals lose a Game 7 for the first time in their history. This was the sixth World Series of the 1960s to go to a full seven games, the most of any decade. The Tigers were the third team to come back from a three-games-to-one deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series, the first two being the 1925 Pirates and the 1958 Yankees; since then, the 1979 Pirates, the 1985 Royals, and the 2016 Cubs have also accomplished this feat. Detroit manager Mayo Smith received some notoriety for moving outfielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop for the 1968 World Series, which has been called one of the gutsiest coaching moves in sports history by multiple sources. Stanley, who replaced the superior fielding but much weaker hitting Ray Oyler, would make two errors in the Series, neither of which led to a run. This was also the final World Series played prior to MLB's 1969 expansion, which coincided with the introduction of divisional play and the League Championship Series. All seven games of NBC's TV coverage were preserved on black-and-white kinescopes by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and circulate among collectors. Games 1 and 5 have been commercially released; these broadcasts, and that of Game 7, were frequently shown on CSN (Classic Sports Network) and ESPN Classic in the 1990s and 2000s. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Bob Gibson The Tigers roared into Game 1 by setting a then-team record with 103 victories on the season and were appearing in their first World Series in 23 years. The Tigers led the American League with 185 home runs. Their team batting average was .235, fourth best in the league; the team stole only 26 bases on the year.1968 Detroit Tigers Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics The Cardinals, on the other hand, stole 110 bases, led the NL with 48 triples, and had a team batting average of .249, but hit only 73 home runs.1968 St. Louis Cardinals Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics Pitching was about even as both teams set their rotations for Game 1 with solid starters and adequate relievers. Fans overflowed Busch Stadium for Game 1 to watch the highly anticipated match-up of the Major League's top two pitchers--the Cardinals' Bob Gibson (22‚Äì9, 1.12 ERA) and the Tigers' Denny McLain (31‚Äì6, 1.96 ERA). Gibson was looking to become the first National League pitcher to win six World Series games while McLain was pitching in his first World Series game. The Cardinals had far more World Series experience than the Tigers with most of the Cardinal lineup (including all nine Game 1 starters) having played in a prior World Series. Both pitchers were highly competitive, fast workers, sporting overpowering fastballs coupled with excellent control. Gibson's performance in Game 1 was phenomenal. The menacing right-handed pitcher shut out the Tigers on just five hits, and he struck out a World Series-record 17 Detroit Tigers batters. The Cardinals broke through with three in the fourth off McLain. After McLain walked Roger Maris and Tim McCarver, Cardinal third baseman Mike Shannon singled in Maris and went to second base when Tiger left fielder Willie Horton misplayed the ball. McCarver pulled in at third. Cardinal second baseman Juli√°n Javier followed this by singling in both baserunners to make the score 3‚Äì0. Outfielder Lou Brock added a home run in the seventh inning to complete the scoring. Gibson finished the game in the ninth inning with his 15th, 16th, and 17th strikeouts to pass Sandy Koufax's previous record of 15, set in the 1963 World Series. Game 2 Norm Cash The Tigers' starting pitcher Mickey Lolich earned a complete-game victory and the Tigers tied the Series. Tiger outfielder Willie Horton hit a home run in the second inning; Lolich also helped his own cause with a homer in the third inning off the Cardinals' starter, Nelson Briles, scoring the eventual game-winning run. This was the only home run that Lolich hit during his entire professional career. The Tigers broke the game open in the sixth inning when first baseman Norm Cash led off with another homer, and second baseman Dick McAuliffe later provided a two-run single. Cardinal first baseman Orlando Cepeda gave St. Louis a run with an RBI single in the sixth, but that was all they scored. Al Kaline scored in the seventh inning when Jim Northrup hit into a double play, and the Tigers scored their final two runs in the ninth inning with bases- loaded walks to Don Wert and Lolich. Game 3 Tim McCarver In the first of three games at Detroit's Tiger Stadium, Al Kaline started the scoring with a two-run homer in the third inning, but the Cardinals came back in the fifth inning on an RBI double by center fielder Curt Flood off starter Earl Wilson. After Wilson put another batter on base, catcher Tim McCarver launched a three-run home run for the eventual game-winning runs off relief pitcher Pat Dobson. The Tigers cut the deficit to just one run on a home run by Dick McAuliffe. But Orlando Cepeda put the game out of reach in the seventh inning by smacking a three-run home run. The Cardinals' reliever Joe Hoerner entered the game in the sixth in relief of Ray Washburn (who got the win) and earned a save. Hoerner also collected a single batting in the eighth and became the first major leaguer to get a hit in the World Series after going hitless for the entire season. Game 4 Lou Brock Tiger manager Mayo Smith, needing another left-handed bat in the lineup, made a major change by inserting veteran Eddie Mathews at third base. Mathews, recovering from a spinal operation that nearly ended his career, had one hit in the last game of his major league career. After a 35-minute rain delay, hard-hitting Hall-of-Famer Hank Greenberg threw out the first pitch. McLain had trouble warming up amidst the rainfall, and was throwing with less velocity from the outset. A 31-game winner during the regular season, he struggled for the second time in this World Series, as this one-sided pitching match-up with Bob Gibson showed. Lou Brock led the game off with a home run, and Mike Shannon added an RBI single later in the first inning. Two more Cardinals runs were knocked in during the third inning on Tim McCarver's triple and Mike Shannon's double. McLain's troubles continued, and after a walk to Juli√°n Javier, the umpires stopped the game due to rain with two out in the third inning. McLain did not return when play resumed after a one-hour and 15-minute rain delay. Bob Gibson did return after the delay, and helped his own cause by hitting a home run off Joe Sparma in the fourth inning. Next, Lou Brock knocked a triple and scored on a ground- out by Roger Maris. The Cardinals' final runs came in the eighth inning when Gibson walked with the bases loaded, forcing in one run, and then Lou Brock drove in three more runs with a double. Brock was just a single short of hitting for the cycle in this game. The Tigers' only run came in the fourth inning when Jim Northrup hit a home run. Other than that, Gibson was a nearly perfect pitcher, tossing his second complete game in this World Series while striking out ten batters. The Cards now had a commanding 3‚Äì1 series lead. Game 5 Bill Freehan With the World Series on the line, the Tigers used their winner of Game 2, Mickey Lolich, as their starting pitcher. Lolich's first inning in this game was not too promising, as he allowed an RBI single by Curt Flood and a two-run home run to Orlando Cepeda. However, Lolich soon settled down, striking out eight Cardinal batters and allowing no more runs. Tigers' first baseman Norm Cash began the team comeback with a sacrifice fly in the fourth inning, plating Mickey Stanley who had tripled. This was followed by a Willie Horton triple and Jim Northrup's RBI single, making it a 3‚Äì2 game. In the fifth inning, the Cardinals had a chance to go up by two runs after Lou Brock hit a one-out double. Cardinal second baseman Juli√°n Javier followed with a base hit to left. Outfielder Willie Horton fielded the ball off the ground and then fired the ball towards home plate. Instead of sliding into home plate, Brock tried to bowl over Tiger catcher Bill Freehan. However, Freehan caught and held onto the ball while blocking the corner of the plate with his foot, and Brock was called out. This was the last time that the Cardinals threatened to score in the game. The Cardinals' starting pitcher Nelson Briles was taken out of the game in the seventh inning with one runner on base, and was replaced by closer reliever Joe Hoerner. The Tigers began a game-winning rally off Hoerner, with Al Kaline hitting a two-run single to give the Tigers a 4‚Äì3 lead. Norm Cash then knocked in an insurance run with a single. Jose Feliciano's unconventional pre-game singing of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" aroused considerable controversy, with the Tigers and NBC receiving thousands of angry letters and telephone calls about the performance.Zang, Dave. \\"Feliciano ignited a star-spangled controversy.\\" Article in The Sporting News on October 25, 1993. Lolich also blamed Feliciano's unusually long rendition for causing him to get cold after his warm-ups and thus give up three early runs.Chass, Murray. \\"When the Pitchers Needed Less Rest In the Postseason.\\" Article in The New York Times on October 22, 2006. Game 6 Willie Horton Now needing two wins in St. Louis to win the World Series, Tiger manager Mayo Smith chose Denny McLain again as his starting pitcher, even though he had only two days' rest and had not been very successful in his two prior Series starts. Cardinals' manager Red Schoendienst stayed with his normal three-starter rotation, selecting Ray Washburn, who had won Game 3. The choice of McLain paid off for the Tigers, as he pitched a complete game in a 13‚Äì1 rout of the Cardinals. The Tigers went up 2‚Äì0 in the second inning on RBI hits by Willie Horton and Bill Freehan. In the third, the Tigers sent 14 batters to the plate and scored 10 runs off of three Cardinals pitchers. Jim Northrup's grand slam highlighted the inning. Al Kaline added a home run in the fifth inning. The Cardinals' lone run came off an RBI single by Juli√°n Javier with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, but that was all they could do against McLain. Game 7 Mickey Lolich In a fitting end to this Series, the two teams' hottest pitchers, Mickey Lolich and Bob Gibson, squared off in what was almost a classic duel, until an infamous hit over the head of Curt Flood. Like McLain in Game 6, Lolich was starting on only two days' rest. Lolich and Gibson matched scoreless starts for six innings, but in the top of the seventh, Gibson surrendered two-out hits to Norm Cash and Willie Horton. Jim Northrup then hit a hard smash to deep center; Curt Flood, who won numerous Gold Glove awards in his career, misjudged it and briefly started in on the ball before turning around to go back. The ball one-hopped the warning track, two runs scored, Northrup wound up with a triple, and Lolich had all the runs he needed. Flood has been criticized by some who believe he would have caught the ball had his first steps been back instead of in. Jim Northrup said the hit was \\"40 feet over [Flood's] head. He never had a chance to catch it.\\"Mott, Geoff (October 14, 2006) \\"10 Questions with Jim Northrup,\\" Saginaw News However, his teammate Denny McLain claimed in his 1975 book that \\"Flood blew it.\\" Orlando Cepeda, in his 1998 autobiography Baby Bull, asserts that Flood would have caught the ball, had he not misjudged it. In the October 29, 1968, issue of The Sporting News, both Flood and manager Red Schoendienst indicated they would have expected the normally sure-handed outfielder to catch such a ball. By starting in, Flood had to both reverse direction and then regain his acceleration. He then slipped on the wet grass before recovering his speed, and by that time the ball was well beyond him. Bill Freehan then doubled in Northrup, and in the top of the ninth, Don Wert added an RBI single. The Cardinals got a run in the ninth on a Mike Shannon homer, but that was all as Lolich pitched his third complete game. The final out of the series was recorded when Bill Freehan caught a pop foul off the bat of Tim McCarver. Gibson struck out eight in the losing cause, giving him a record 35 strikeouts by one pitcher in a World Series, but Lolich was named World Series MVP. This is the last World Series game to date to feature complete games from both starting pitchers. Cardinals shortstop Dal Maxvill went hitless in 22 World Series at-bats, a record.

It is best remembered for the heroics of Sandy Koufax, who was named the series MVP. Koufax did not pitch in Game 1, as it fell on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, but pitched in Game 2 and then tossed shutouts in Games 5 and 7 (with only two days of rest in between) to win the championship. The Twins had won their first pennant since 1933 when the team was known as the Washington Senators. The Dodgers, prevailing in seven games, captured their second title in three years, and their third since moving to Los Angeles in 1958. Background Both teams improved from sixth-place finishes in 1964; the Twins won the A.L. pennant with relative ease while the Dodgers were locked in a season-long five-way battle in the N.L. among themselves, the Giants, Pirates, Reds, and Braves. After the Giants won their 14th-consecutive game to take a -game lead on September 16, the Dodgers went on a 13-game winning streak over the final two weeks of the season to clinch the pennant on the next to last day of the season over the second place rival Giants. During the 1965 season, the Dodgers relied heavily on the arms of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, and would rely on them even more in the World Series, as the Dodgers only used seven pitchers. The Dodgers' strong core of pitchers, which also included Claude Osteen and Ron Perranoski, kept them in the pennant race and into the Series. Koufax, surviving on a steady diet of Cortisone and pain killers for his arthritic left elbow,Interview with Sandy Koufax announcing his retirement from Major League Baseball, pitched five times in 15 days down the stretch, winning four (three shutouts), including 13 strikeouts in the pennant winner against Milwaukee. Dodger hitting however remained strictly popgun, especially after Tommy Davis went down in late April for the season with a broken ankle. Manager Walter Alston promptly called up 12-year minor league veteran Lou Johnson from Spokane. Johnson led the Dodgers, along with ROY Jim Lefebvre, in home runs with just 12. The Twins, managed by Sam Mele, had a more balanced attack, equally strong in pitching and hitting, although their defense committed 173 errors including 39 by shortstop Zoilo Versalles. Offensively Mele again had balance with good hitting, power and speed up and down his lineup that included the AL's leading hitter (Tony Oliva, at .321), and 20-plus home runs from five different players, including top-level slugger Harmon Killebrew, normally good for 40+ per year, though limited to 25 in 1965 due to missing nearly two months of the season with an injury. Pitching was spearheaded by 21-game winner Mudcat Grant, Jim \\"Kitty\\" Kaat, and Camilo Pascual. This was only the second World Series where both teams were located west of the Mississippi River. The first occurred in 1944, when the St. Louis Browns faced their Sportsman's Park tenants, the St. Louis Cardinals. This was the first of 11 consecutive World Series that did not have the New York Yankees playing in it; it was the longest such streak until , when the Toronto Blue Jays claimed the second of their back-to-back World Series championships by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies. It was also the first series in which both teams had had losing records the previous year. This has since been repeated two other times, both times also involving the Twins‚Äîin 1987 and 1991. This World Series was the first in which all games were played in cities that did not have National League or American League teams in 1903, the year of the first modern World Series. Also, it is the earliest World Series whose telecasts are known to survive in their entirety; the CBC has complete kinescopes of all seven games in its archives. Summary The Twins won the first two games of the series against Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax, but once Claude Osteen shut out the Twins in Game 3, things turned around. Willie Davis of The Dodgers tied a World Series record stealing 3 bases in one Game, game 5, the record was set by Honus Wagner in 1909. The Dodgers proceeded to win the three middle games at Dodger Stadium and Koufax would pitch two shutouts including a three-hitter with ten strikeouts to clinch. Ron Fairly hit two home runs for the Dodgers, both in losing efforts. Matchups=Game 1 Zoilo Versalles Game 1 was set to be a pitching duel between Dodgers' Don Drysdale and the Twins' Mudcat Grant (21‚Äì7, 3.30 ERA on the year). Drysdale was starting because the game fell on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the year in the Jewish calendar. Dodger ace Sandy Koufax, who is Jewish, stated he would not pitch that day. In the Twins' third inning any thought of a pitchers' duel was put to rest. Going into that inning, it was 1‚Äì1. Coming out, it was 7‚Äì1. It started with a Frank Quilici double to left field, followed by an error by Jim Lefebvre, allowing the pitcher Grant to reach. Then, shortstop Zoilo Versalles stepped to the plate. He had hit 19 home runs in the regular season and would later win the AL MVP Award for that year. He crushed a pitch from Drysdale for a three-run home run to make the score, 4‚Äì1. However, the Twins' scoring wasn't over. With still no one out, left fielder Sandy Valdespino began things again with a double. After a few outs and baserunners, and a single by Harmon Killebrew, the Twins had two runners again. With three straight singles (Earl Battey, Don Mincher, and Quilici), scoring three unearned runs, the Twins had jumped out to a six-run lead and would never look back, winning the game 8‚Äì2. Frank Quilici set a World Series record with his two hits in the third inning. Mudcat Grant was the first black World Series game-winner for an American League team, and just the seventh pitcher to homer in a World Series game. The Dodgers had scored their runs on a Ron Fairly homer and a Maury Wills bunt single that scored Lefebvre. Grant received the win while Drysdale took the loss. In the postgame news conference, a reporter jokingly said to Dodger manager Walter Alston, \\"I bet you wish Drysdale was Jewish too.\\" Game 2 Jim Kaat In Game 2, the Twins this time got to Dodger ace Sandy Koufax. Minnesota's pitcher, this time Jim Kaat, again shut down the Dodgers' weak offense. A heavy rain storm soaked Metropolitan Stadium overnight, and the two teams slogged their way through the first five innings. In the top of the fifth, Ron Fairly singled, then left-fielder Bob Allison made a diving, sliding catch of a fly ball off the bat of Jim Lefebvre, preventing a run. Aided by an error, the Twins broke the scoreless tie in the sixth, Versalles hit a missile shot and when Jim Gilliam bobbled the ball at third base, the ball ricocheted off Gilliam and into left field. Versalles reached on the two-base error, then scored on a Tony Oliva double. Killebrew followed with a single, plating Oliva. That is all the runs the Twins would need, though Kaat added insurance in the eighth with a two-run base hit of his own. The Twins went up 2‚Äì0 in the Series. Game 3 Claude Osteen In Game 3, pressure was on Claude Osteen to have a good start so Los Angeles would not go down 0‚Äì3. He faced Camilo Pascual, who had a quality (though somewhat injury plagued) year (9‚Äì3, 3.35 ERA). Dodger Stadium was filled to capacity and fans were treated to an appearance from Casey Stengel, a member of the 1916 Dodgers World Series team. Stengel, sans his cane despite a broken hip, hobbled on to the field and threw out the first pitch. In the first inning, Versalles led off with a double. But with two men on, Versalles was caught stealing home on the front end of an attempted double steal. In the fourth, Johnny Roseboro put the Dodgers on the board with a two-run single. The play cost the Dodgers dearly, Jim Lefebvre bruising his heel crossing the plate with the second of the two runs. The Dodgers, already short on hitting (Lefebvre was batting .400 at the time), went with Dick Tracewski (.118 for the Series) at second base the rest of the way. The Twins received a scare of their own in the seventh inning. Catcher Earl Battey, chasing a popup, collided full speed with the railing used to cover sub-field level \\"dugout seats\\" next to the Twins dugout. Battey crumpled in a heap holding his neck and was replaced by Jerry Zimmerman. Los Angeles continued to score runs on a Willie Davis single and a Lou Johnson double in the fifth, then a Wills double in the sixth. Osteen, who as a pitcher for the Senators had had a perfect 5‚Äì0 record against the Twins, completed the game by getting Zimmerman to ground into a double play. He allowed only five hits, succeeding where the Dodger aces hadn't in Games 1 and 2. Game 4 Wes Parker In a rematch of Game 1 pitchers Drysdale and Grant, the Dodgers ace prevailed, allowing only two runs on five hits. He had eleven strikeouts, fanning Jimmie Hall and Don Mincher three times each. Grant gave up three runs in the first five innings, then was removed in the sixth, when the Dodgers got three more. The Twins opened the game with aggression when Sandy Valdespino tried to stretch a single into a double. Lou Johnson, not known as a great fielder, gunned down Valdespino at second. The Dodgers scored twice without getting the ball out of the infield. Maury Wills collided at first base with Twins second baseman Frank Quilici on an infield single as pitcher Grant was slow to cover the bag. The play cartwheeled Wills backwards, but the Dodger dusted himself off and promptly stole second. Wills went to third on another infield single, this time by the speedy Willie Davis, as Grant was again slow to cover. Wills scored when Ron Fairly beat out a potential double-play grounder. In the bottom of the second, Dodger speed made up for what seemed a lack of power. Parker bunted a single, then stole second and took third when Grant's throw went wild. Parker scored when Roseboro's grounder to second got through Quilici. The Dodgers then showed power with Parker and Johnson home runs. The Twins had scored their two runs on home runs from Killebrew and Oliva. Back in form, Drysdale evened the series as L.A. won, 7‚Äì2. Game 5 Maury Wills In Game 5, the Minnesota pitcher who had done so well in Game 2, Jim Kaat, did not do as well this time, as the Dodgers won their third straight. Koufax give up only four hits and one walk, striking out ten. Kaat gave up two runs quickly in the first inning, then again in the third. Dave Boswell came in to attempt to stop the bleeding and Jim Perry did the same. Koufax basically put the game out of reach in the seventh, when he helped himself out with an RBI single to score Fairly. The Dodger's win put them up 3‚Äì2 in the series. In the first inning, Dodger speed forced the Twins into fielding mishaps. Wills doubled and Gilliam singled in the run. Willie Davis bunted and third-baseman Killebrew's hurried throw to first went high, enabling the streaking Davis to make it all the way to third and plating Gilliam. The Dodgers collected 14 hits and four stolen bases, while Koufax steadily kept the Twins in check for the shutout. Game 6 Mudcat Grant In Game 6, Osteen did not fare as well as he had in his last start. In the fourth inning, Battey reached on an error by Dick Tracewski, followed by a Bob Allison two-run home run. Grant, for the Twins, was on his game once again. He also helped himself, as had Koufax for L.A. the game before, but in this case with a towering three-run home run, after Quilici was intentionally walked to get to Grant. A Fairly home run, his second of the series, put the Dodgers on the board to make the score 5‚Äì1, but that's all they would get as Grant pitched a complete game. Twins manager Sam Mele chose to leave veteran pitchers Pascual and Perry and youngster Jim Merritt in the bullpen, instead going with Grant on two days' rest. Twins catcher Earl Battey brought the nearly 50,000 Metropolitan Stadium fans to their feet by leading off the second inning with a triple past a diving Willie Davis in center. Battey showed no outward ill-effects of his collision with the railing in Game 3, diving headfirst into third base on the play. Osteen promptly struck out Allison and Quilici, however, to quell the threat. Battey continued his fine play in the fourth by hustling to first when Tracewski booted his groundball, and Allison followed with a home run. Grant pitched solidly and the Twins tied the series at 3‚Äì3. Game 7 Sandy Koufax Dodger manager Walt Alston was torn between starting Drysdale on normal rest or Koufax with only two days' rest. He decided on the left-handed Koufax, figuring if needed he would use the right-handed Drysdale in relief, then go back to his left-handed relief ace Ron Perranoski. Koufax told announcer Vin Scully in a post-game interview that he and Drysdale had come to the ballpark not knowing which would be on the mound. According to Koufax, the manager announced the decision purely in strategic terms regarding lefty vs. righty, saying he worded his announcement without even using the pitchers' names, saying only that he thought he'd \\"like to start the left-hander.\\" The Twins went with Kaat, also starting on two days' rest. Both managers had relief pitchers warming up as their starters began the game. Koufax had trouble throwing his curveball for strikes but escaped a couple of early jams, including one in the third inning when Zoilo Versailles stole second base with one out, but was called back after batter Joe Nossek was ruled out for interference. Koufax effectively gave up on his curveball and pitched the late innings almost exclusively with fastballs, still baffling the hard-hitting Twins. In the fourth inning, Dodger left fielder Lou Johnson told Koufax that he would get him the only run he would need. Johnson promptly hit one off the left-field foul pole to give the Dodgers a 1‚Äì0 lead. Ron Fairly followed with a double and scored on a Wes Parker single. The two runs came on three consecutive pitches. Knowing Kaat was on short rest, manager Mele pulled him quickly. Al Worthington, Johnny Klippstein, Jim Merritt, and Jim Perry combined to shut out the Dodgers for the rest of the game. The Twins threatened again in the fifth inning when they had runners on first and second with only one out. Versailles hit a hard grounder down the third base line that appeared to be going for a double. This could have ended Koufax's day as Drysdale was warming up in the bullpen. But third baseman Jim Gilliam (who was often replaced late in games for defensive reasons) made a diving, backhanded stop and stepped on third for a force. Koufax bore down and got the third out. He ended up tossing a three-hit shutout, striking out ten in one of the greatest Game 7 pitching performances ever. \\"Sweet Lou\\" Johnson hit two home runs, including the game-winner in the clinching Game 7. No relief pitchers were used by the winning team in any game of this series; the winning starting pitcher went the distance in all seven games. This had not happened since 1940, and has never been repeated since. The Twins' loss in Game 7 remains the only World Series game the Twins have lost at home, having later won all their home games in 1987 and 1991. Through 2017, the Twins have never won a road World Series Game (not including when the franchise was the original Washington Senators). The National League won its third consecutive World Series (Dodgers in 1963, St. Louis Cardinals in 1964). The Senior Circuit would not claim back-to-back titles again until 1975 and 1976, when the Cincinnati Reds did so. Although the Dodgers had played the maximum seven games in four best-of-seven World Series when they were located in Brooklyn (in 1947, 1952, 1955, and 1956), 1965 marked the first time they had done so when located in Los Angeles. It did not happen again until 2017. The Brooklyn Dodgers had also played seven games in the 1920 World Series when it was a best-of-nine series, losing to Cleveland five games to two. Composite box 1965 World Series (4‚Äì3): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over Minnesota Twins (A.L.) Aftermath The Dodgers would return to the World Series the following year, only to be swept in four straight games by the Baltimore Orioles. The Dodgers scored twice in Game 1, but those would be only runs they would score in the entire series. Sandy Koufax retired after the series at age 30, due to chronic arthritis and bursitis in his pitching elbow. Meanwhile, the Twins would have to wait 22 more years before returning to the World Series in 1987, when they would finally win their first championship since 1924 (known then as the Washington Senators), and their first since moving to Minnesota, by beating the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. That series was the first series in which the home team won all games, a feat Sandy Koufax prevented in Game 7 of this series. Since the 1987 Series, that feat has been successfully accomplished twice more in 1991 (also involving the Twins, this time defeating the Atlanta Braves) and 2001 (In which the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees).

two-time defending champion New York Yankees against the Chicago Cubs, with the Yankees sweeping the Series in four games for their seventh championship overall and record third straight (they would win four in a row from to , and five in a row later from to ). Dizzy Dean, who had helped carry the Cubs to the National League pennant despite a sore arm, ran out of gas in the Series as the Yanks crushed the Cubs again, as they had in . Yankee starting pitcher Red Ruffing won two games, although he allowed 17 hits in 18 innings pitched. After Game 2 of the Series, the Bronx Bombers would not return to Wrigley Field for nearly 65 years until a three-game interleague series with the Cubs beginning June 6, 2003. This was the first World Series played at Wrigley Field following the bleacher reconstruction of 1937, which had significantly shortened the left-center field power alley. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Game 1 of the Series matched the Yankees' Red Ruffing, who had won 21 games during the season, against the Cubs' 22-game winner Bill Lee. In the top of the second inning, Lou Gehrig walked and moved to third on a single by Bill Dickey. George Selkirk then reached on an error by Cub second baseman Billy Herman scoring Gehrig, and Joe Gordon drove Dickey in with a single for a 2‚Äì0 Bomber lead. In the bottom of the third, the Cubs cut the lead in half when Ripper Collins singled to lead off and moved to second on a groundout by Lee. Stan Hack's single to right scored Collins, Hack taking second on the throw home. But when he attempted to score on an infield single by Herman, he was gunned down at home. The top of the sixth saw New York extend its lead to 3‚Äì1 when Tommy Henrich belted a double to right and scored on a Dickey single. The Cubs could muster nothing further off Ruffing, who scattered nine hits over the course of the game, and the Yankees held on for the win and a 1‚Äì0 lead in the Series. Game 2 Game 2 pitted the Yankees' Lefty Gomez against former St. Louis Cardinals ace Dizzy Dean, who had been traded to Chicago in April and won seven of his eight regular-season wins for his new team on finesse after having lost his fastball by changing his pitching motion to avoid putting weight on the toe he had fractured during the 1937 All-Star Game (on a low line drive back to the mound by Earl Averill). Game 2 of the 1938 Series thus became known as \\"Ol' Diz's Last Stand\\". The Cubs gave Dean a 1‚Äì0 lead in the bottom of the first inning when Hack singled, advanced to third on a single by Frank Demaree and scored on Joe Marty's fly ball. But the Bronx Bombers took the lead in the next half- inning when a Gordon double scored both Joe DiMaggio and Gehrig. In the bottom of the third, the Cubs went back out in front by a run when Hack and Herman hit back-to-back singles, were sacrificed to third and second by Demaree, and scored on Marty's double. Dean pitched effectively for the next four innings, giving up only a single to Gehrig in the fourth. But in the top of the eighth, the Yankees stormed back on a two-run homer by Frankie Crosetti that scored pinch-hitter Myril Hoag for a 4‚Äì3 Bomber lead, and DiMaggio added a two-run dinger of his own in the top of the ninth that scored Henrich. Johnny Murphy, in relief of Gomez, held Chicago at bay for the final two innings for a 6‚Äì3 Yankee win as the Series moved east to New York with a 2‚Äì0 Series advantage for the Yankees. Game 3 For Game 3 at Yankee Stadium, the Cubs threw Clay Bryant against the Bombers' Monte Pearson. Both pitchers matched zeroes for the first four innings. In the top of the fifth, the Cubs drew first blood when Hack doubled, moved to third on Gordon's error on Phil Cavarretta and scored on Marty's forceout of Cavarretta at second. In the bottom half of the inning, however, Gordon atoned for his mistake by walloping a solo home run off Bryant to tie the game. Pearson followed with a single to right, advanced to second on a Crosetti walk and scored on a Red Rolfe single to give the Yankees a 2‚Äì1 lead. In the bottom of the sixth, New York tacked on two more runs with a two-run single by Gordon. In the top of the eighth, the Cubs cut the lead in half when Marty hit a home run to notch his fifth RBI of the Series, but Dickey answered for the Yankees with a shot of his own in the bottom half. The Bombers held on for a 5‚Äì2 win and a 3‚Äì0 Series stranglehold. Game 4 Game 4 was a rematch of the Game 1 starters, Ruffing vs. Lee. Like the closely contested series opener, it stayed close until New York pulled away with four runs in the bottom of the eighth. In the bottom of the second, the Yankees struck for three runs. Hoag reached on Hack's throwing error from the hot corner, and advanced to third on a Gordon single. Ruffing helped his own cause by singling in Hoag, and Crosetti's triple to left scored Gordon and Ruffing. The Cubs broke the shutout with a Billy Jurges fielder's choice scoring Demaree, but in the sixth the Bombers got the run back with Henrich's solo homer off veteran Cub reliever Charlie Root. In the top of the eighth, the Cubs cut the New York lead to one with a Ken O'Dea home run scoring Cavarretta ahead of him. But in the bottom half, the Yankees broke the game open with a four-run outburst off four Cub pitchers‚ÄîVance Page, Larry French, Tex Carleton and Dean. Crosetti drove in two with a double off Dean, giving him four RBI for the game and six for the Series. As in Game 1, Ruffing went the distance, allowing two earned runs and eight hits with six strikeouts. This was the last World Series game ever played by Yankee first baseman Lou Gehrig. He had one hit in four at-bats. Defensively he had five putouts and two assists. Composite line score 1938 World Series (4‚Äì0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.)

The Yankees won the Series in five games for their tenth championship in 21 seasons. It was Yankees manager Joe McCarthy's final Series win. This series was also the first to have an accompanying World Series highlight film (initially, the films were created as gifts to troops fighting in World War II, to give them a brief recap of baseball action back home), a tradition that still persists. This World Series was scheduled for a 3‚Äì4 format because of wartime travel restrictions. The 3‚Äì4 format meant there was only one trip between ballparks, but if the Series had ended in a four-game sweep, there would have been three games played in one park and only one in the other. Because of World War II, both teams' rosters were depleted. Johnny Beazley, Jimmy Brown, Creepy Crespi, Terry Moore and Enos Slaughter were no longer on the Cardinals' roster. Joe DiMaggio, Phil Rizzuto, Red Ruffing and Buddy Hassett were missing from the Yankees, and Red Rolfe had retired to coach at Dartmouth College. Cardinals pitchers Howie Pollet, Max Lanier and Mort Cooper ranked 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 in the National League in ERA in 1943 at 1.75, 1.90 and 2.30, respectively. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 In Game 1, the Cardinals went up 1‚Äì0 in the second against Spud Chandler on Marty Marion's RBI double with two on. In the fourth inning, with runners on first and third and no outs off Max Lanier, Charlie Keller's double-play tied the game, then Joe Gordon's home run put the Yankees up 2‚Äì1. The Cardinals tied the game in the fifth inning when Ray Sanders hit a leadoff single, moved to second on an error and scored on Lanier's single. In the sixth inning, after two leadoff singles, a one-out wild pitch by Lanier put the Yankees up 3‚Äì2, then Bill Dickey added an insurance run with an RBI single. Chandler pitched a complete game to give the Yankees a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 The Cardinals' only victory came the same day as the death of Mort and Walker Cooper's father, Robert. Marty Marion's leadoff home run in the third off Tiny Bonham put the Cardinals up 1‚Äì0. In the fourth, Stan Musial hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Whitey Kurowski's RBI single. Ray Sanders's two-run home run then made it 4‚Äì0 Cardinals. In the bottom of the inning, Charlie Keller's sacrifice fly with two on off Mort Cooper put the Yankees on the board. In the ninth, Billy Johnson hit a leadoff double, then scored on Cooper's triple. After a line- out, Nick Etten's RBI groundout cut the Cardinals' lead to one, but Cooper got Joe Gordon to pop out in foul territory to end the game and tie the series 1‚Äì1. Game 3 The Cardinals loaded the bases in the fourth on a single, double and intentional walk off Hank Borowy before Danny Litwhiler drove in two with a single to left, but Borowy allowed no other runs in eight innings. In the sixth, Borowy hit a leadoff double off Al Brazle, moved to third on a sacrifice fly, and scored on an error on Billy Johnson's groundball. In the eighth, the Yankees loaded the bases on a single, fielder's choice and intentional walk before Johnson cleared them with a triple, putting the Yankees up 4‚Äì2. They added to their lead on RBI singles by Joe Gordon off Howie Krist and Nick Etten off Harry Brecheen. Johnny Murphy pitched a perfect ninth as the Yankees went up 2‚Äì1 in the series. Game 4 In Game 4, the Yankees struck first when Joe Gordon doubled with two outs in the fourth off Max Lanier and scored on Bill Dickey's single. In the seventh, Marius Russo got two outs, then allowed the Cardinals to load the bases on an error, double and intentional walk before another error on Frank Demaree's groundball tied the game. In the eighth, Russo hit a leadoff double off Harry Brecheen, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Frankie Crosetti's sacrifice fly. Russo pitched a complete game to leave the Yankees one win away from the championship. Game 5 Murry Dickson, who helped close the door for the Cardinals by allowing no hits while on the mound, was on a ten-day pass from the United States Army. Spud Chandler won his second complete game of the series, shutting out the Cardinals despite giving up 10 hits and two walks. Bill Dickey provided the game's only runs on a home run in the sixth after a two-out walk off Mort Cooper.

The 1942 Cardinals set a franchise record for victories with 106. Every Cardinal‚Äîexcept for Harry Gumbert‚Äîwas a product of the team's farm system, which had been put in place by Branch Rickey. The Yankees won Game 1 despite a Cardinals rally, but the Cardinals swept the rest. The loss was the Yankees' first since the 1926 World Series, also to the Cardinals. They had won eight Series in the interim (a record for most consecutive series won between losses) and had won 32 out of 36 World Series games in that period, including five sweeps (1927 vs. the Pirates, 1928 vs. the Cardinals, 1932 and 1938 vs. the Cubs and 1939 vs. the Reds). SummaryMatchups=Game 1 In Game 1, Red Ruffing had a no-hitter until Terry Moore singled for St. Louis with two out in the eighth inning. The Yankees scored the game's first run in the fourth on Buddy Hassett's two-out double with two on off of Mort Cooper. Next inning with runners on second and third, Joe DiMaggio's fielder's choice made it 2‚Äì0 Yankees. In the eighth with two on, Hassett's single scored a run, then an error on Red Ruffing's fly ball scored two more. Red Rolfe singled to lead off the ninth off of Max Lanier and scored on an error on Roy Cullenbine's bunt attempt. Charlie Keller walked and an error on a pickoff attempt allowed Cullenbine to score. In the bottom of the ninth, with two on and two outs, Marty Marion put the Cardinals on the board with a two-run triple, then scored on Ken O'Dea's single. After Jimmy Brown walked, Spud Chandler relieved Ruffing and allowed an RBI single to Terry Moore. Another single loaded the bases, bringing Stan Musial to the plate as the potential winning run, only to have Musial ground out to end the game as the Yankees took a 1‚Äì0 series lead with a 7‚Äì4 win. Game 2 In Game 2, Walker Cooper's two-run double in the first, the Cardinals' first hit of the game, put them up 2‚Äì0 off of Tiny Bonham. In the seventh, innings Johnny Hopp singled and scored on Whitey Kurowski's triple to make it 3‚Äì0 Cardinals. Johnny Beazley pitched seven shutout innings, but in the eighth allowed a two-out single to Roy Cullenbine, who stole second and scored on Joe DiMaggio's single. A two-run home run by Charlie Keller then tied the score, but the Cardinals regained the lead in the bottom half when Enos Slaughter doubled with two outs and scored on Stan Musial's single. Slaughter threw out Tuck Stainback going from first to third on a single with no outs in the ninth. Beazley then retired the next two hitters to end the game as the Cardinals tied the series with a 4‚Äì3 win heading to New York. Game 3 Ernie White pitched a six-hit shutout against New York, walking none. The last time the Yankees were shutout in a World Series game was by Jesse Haines in 1926. The Cardinals scored the game's first run in the third off of Spud Chandler on Jimmy Brown's groundout with runners on second and third, then added an insurance run in the ninth off of Marv Breuer on Enos Slaughter's RBI single with two on, the run unearned due to catcher Walker Cooper's error on Terry Moore's bunt attempt, to take a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Game 4 In Game 4, the Yankees struck first in the bottom of the first when Red Rolfe doubled off of Mort Cooper and scored on Roy Cullenbine's single. In the top of the fourth, the Cardinals loaded the bases with no outs on two singles and walk before Whitey Kurowski's two-run single put them up 2‚Äì1. A walk loaded the bases before Cooper's two-run single made it 4‚Äì1 Cardinals. Atley Donald relieved starter Hank Borowy and allowed a one- out RBI single to Terry Moore and two-out RBI double to Stan Musial. In the bottom of the sixth, after a leadoff single and walk, Cullunbine's RBI single made it 6‚Äì2 Cardinals and one out later, Charlie Keller's three-run home run cut their lead to one. Harry Gumbert relieved Cooper and Joe Gordon reached first third baseman Kurowski's throwing error, then scored on Jerry Priddy's double to tie the game, but the Cardinals took the lead for good in the seventh. After two leadoff walks, an RBI single by Walker Cooper put them up 7‚Äì6, and Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly off of Tiny Bonham later that inning. The Cardinals added another run in the ninth Johnny Hopp hit a leadoff single, moved to third on two groundouts and scored on a single by Max Lanier, who pitched three shutout innings to close the game and earn the win, leaving the Cardinals one win away from the championship. Game 5 In Game 5, Phil Rizzuto's leadoff home run in the bottom of the first off of Johnny Beazley put the Yankees up 1‚Äì0, but the Cardinals tied the score in the fourth on Enos Slaughter's leadoff home run off of Red Ruffing. The Yankees retook the lead in the bottom half when Red Rolfe hit a leadoff single, moved to third on an error and groundout and scored on Joe DiMaggio's single, but the Cardinals again tied the game in the sixth on two leadoff singles and a sacrifice fly by Walker Cooper. In the top of the ninth, Whitey Kurowski's two-run home run put the Cardinals up 4‚Äì2. Though the Yankees put two on in the bottom of the ninth on a single and error with no outs, Beazley picked off Joe Gordon at second and retired the next two batters to end the game and give the Cardinals the championship.

Starting pitchers Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, and Johnny Podres, and ace reliever Ron Perranoski combined to give up only four runs in four games. The dominance of the Dodgers pitchers was so complete that at no point in any of the four games did the Yankees have the lead. New York was held to a .171 team batting average, the lowest ever for the Yankees in the post-season. This was the first time that the Yankees were swept in a World Series in four straight (the 1922 World Series had one tie). Of the Los Angeles Dodgers' four World Series championships since the opening of Dodger Stadium, this was the only one won at Dodger Stadium. Also, of the six championships from the Dodgers franchise, it remains the only one won at home. This series was also the first meeting between teams from New York City and Los Angeles for a major professional sports championship. Seven more such meetings have followed with three more times each in the World Series and the NBA Finals, and the 2014 Stanley Cup Final. Background=Yankees Despite injuries that limited Mickey Mantle to just 65 games, the Yankees went 104‚Äì57 to win their fourth straight American League pennant‚Äîthis one by games. Catcher Elston Howard (.287 BA, 28 HRs, 85 RBI) won the MVP Award, while Joe Pepitone, Roger Maris, and Tom Tresh also topped the 20 home run mark. Their pitching was anchored by Whitey Ford (24 wins, 2.74 ERA) and Jim Bouton (21 wins, 2.53 ERA). Dodgers The Dodgers' road to the World Series was much more challenging. After blowing a four-game lead with seven to play in 1962, the Dodgers again built a lead in 1963. On August 21, the Dodgers beat the Cardinals 2‚Äì1 in 16 innings to take a game lead. When they went to St. Louis for a three-game series on September 16, their lead was one game over the Cardinals, who had won 19 of 20 games. Sports fans around the country were saying how the Dodgers were going to blow it again. But the Dodgers swept the three games from the Cardinals to move four games ahead with nine to play; a 4‚Äì1 win over the Mets clinched the pennant in the season's 158th game. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax Sandy Koufax started it off with a record 15-strikeout performance in Game 1 to outduel the Yankees' ace left-hander Whitey Ford. The 15 strikeouts bested fellow Dodgers pitcher Carl Erskine's mark in 1953 by one, and would be surpassed by Bob Gibson in 1968. Koufax also tied a World Series record when he fanned the first five Yankees he faced. Clete Boyer was the only Yankees regular not to strike out. Mickey Mantle, Tom Tresh and Tony Kubek each struck out twice, and Bobby Richardson struck out three times‚Äîhis only three-strikeout game in 1448 regular season or World Series games. Koufax also struck out three pinch- hitters, including Harry Bright to end the game. Ford set the Dodgers down in order in the first inning, but got into trouble in the second inning. With one out, right fielder Frank Howard doubled into left center field. A single by first baseman Bill Skowron plated Howard to give the Dodgers a 1‚Äì0 lead. Second baseman Dick Tracewski's single preceded a three-run home run by catcher John Roseboro to give the Dodgers a 4‚Äì0 lead. The Dodgers upped the lead to 5-0 when Skowron singled home Willie Davis with two outs in the third inning against Ford, who went just five innings. The Yankees scored twice in the eighth inning when Tony Kubek singled with one out and Tom Tresh homered with two outs to cut the lead to 5‚Äì2. https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA196310020.shtml Game 2 Willie Davis Willie Davis doubled in two runs in the first inning, former Yankee Bill Skowron homered in the fourth, and Tommy Davis had two triples, including an RBI triple in the eighth to lead the Dodger offense. Yankee starter Al Downing, who would take the loss, went only five innings and charged with three runs. Ralph Terry, in relief, allowed Davis's RBI triple. Dodger manager Walt Alston went with #3 starter Johnny Podres over #2 starter Don Drysdale because he was left-handed and Yankee Stadium was favorable to left-handed pitchers. Podres delivered a six-hitter through innings; ace reliever Ron Perranoski, also a left-hander, got the last two outs and the save, and the Dodgers headed home with 2‚Äì0 Series lead. Game 3 Don Drysdale Don Drysdale pitched a masterful three-hitter at Dodger Stadium in his complete-game win. Manager Walter Alston called Drysdale's performance \\"one of the greatest pitched games I ever saw.\\" Jim Bouton, making his first World Series start, dueled Drysdale throughout, permitting only four hits in seven innings for a losing cause. The lone run of the game came in the bottom of the first on a Jim Gilliam walk, a wild pitch and a single by Tommy Davis. Gilliam almost scored again in the eighth off Hal Reniff, but was caught in an attempt to steal third. The final out came on Joe Pepitone's drive that backed Dodger right fielder Ron Fairly up against the bullpen gate to make the catch of a ball that would have been a home run in Yankee Stadium. Tony Kubek had two of the Yankees' three hits, but none of the hits were extra-base hits. Game 4 Frank Howard Aces were on the mound again in a game 1 rematch between Whitey Ford and Sandy Koufax. This time, it was a pitcher's duel. The Dodgers scored first in the bottom of the fifth on a monumental Frank Howard home run into the upper deck at Dodger Stadium. The Yankees tied it on a Mickey Mantle home run in the top of the seventh. But in the bottom of the inning, Gilliam hit a high hopper to Yankee third baseman Clete Boyer; Boyer leaped to make the grab, and fired an accurate throw to first base. But first baseman Joe Pepitone lost Boyer's peg in the white-shirted crowd background; the ball struck Pepitone in the arm and rolled down the right field line, allowing Gilliam to scamper all the way to third base. He then scored a moment later on Willie Davis' sacrifice fly. Sandy Koufax went on to hold the Yankees for the final two innings for a 2‚Äì1 victory and the Dodgers' third world championship. To date, this is the only time the Dodgers have won the deciding game of a World Series at home. The World Series Most Valuable Player Award went to Sandy Koufax, who started two of the four games and had two complete game victories. When the award was given to Koufax at a luncheon in New York City, he was presented with a new car‚Äîwhile the luncheon was taking place, a New York City police officer put a parking violation ticket on the car's windshield.New York cop seeks revenge Composite line score Dodger Stadium 1963 World Series (4‚Äì0): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over New York Yankees (A.L.) The Yankees' four runs in the series was, at the time, the second-lowest total in a World Series, as the Philadelphia Athletics had scored only three runs in . The Los Angeles Dodgers would set a new low in , two runs. In popular culture * In the 1986 novel Replay by Ken Grimwood, the protagonist bets his life savings on a Dodgers sweep, knowing they will win. His winnings total more than $12 million, at the apparent odds of 100‚Äì1, with Grimwood referring to it as \\"one of the great upsets in baseball history\\". * This is the World Series that Jack Nicholson's character R.P. McMurphy lobbies unsuccessfully to watch on television (and subsequently \\"announces\\" by imagining the action) in Milo≈° Forman's 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He imagines quite a different scene than what occurred, however, as he describes Richardson, Tresh, and Mantle knocking Koufax out of the box. In reality, the Yankees never led at any time in the Series, and only once in the entire Series (and that only for a half-inning) were the Yankees and Dodgers tied at a score other than 0‚Äì0. A brief clip of Ernie Harwell's NBC Radio broadcast of Game 2 can be heard in the film. * On March 21, 1964, The Joey Bishop Show had lead character Joey Barnes host members of the 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers on his variety show. Don Drysdale sang \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco,\\" Joey had fun with 6'7\\" Frank Howard, and all the Dodgers sang a parody of \\"High Hopes\\" in which they celebrated their victory over the Yankees. The lyrics to this parody were written by Sammy Cahn, who also wrote the original lyrics. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0616258/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nwCYqkoDeM Broadcasting * This was longtime Yankees announcer Mel Allen's 22nd and final World Series broadcast. Allen was suffering from an attack of severe laryngitis at the time of the Series, and while doing play-by-play for NBC television during Game 4 his voice gave out completely in the bottom of the eighth inning, requiring Vin Scully to take over for the remainder of the game. (The following year‚ÄîAllen's last with the Yankees‚Äîhe would be passed over for the Series assignment in favor of boothmate Phil Rizzuto.) * Game 4 was the highest-rated sports broadcast of 1963, per Nielsen ratings. Of all televised World Series games, its 39.5 rating (percentage of all U.S. television-equipped households that watched the game) has only been surpassed by Game 7 in (39.6) and Game 6 in (40.0).

The Yankees won their 4th consecutive title, tying the mark they set in 1936‚Äì1939 under manager Joe McCarthy, and Casey Stengel became the second manager in Major League history with 4 consecutive World Series championships. This was the Yankees' 15th World Series championship win, and the 3rd time they defeated the Dodgers in 6 years. In Game 7, the Yankees' second baseman Billy Martin made a great catch, preserving the Yankees' two-run lead. Also, the home run hit by Mickey Mantle during the 8th inning of Game 6 was significant because it was the first of his record 18 career World Series home runs. SummaryMatchups In 1952 the Dodgers, led by manager Chuck Dressen, paced the NL in runs scored (775), home runs (153) and stolen bases (90). Duke Snider, Jackie Robinson and George Shuba batted over .300, while Roy Campanella (97) and Gil Hodges (102) paced the team in RBIs. The Dodgers had no dominant pitchers with Carl Erskine (206) the lone pitcher with over 200 innings and rookie Joe Black leading the team with 15 wins. Manager Dressen used 14 starting pitchers on the year, but as a unit, the pitchers combined to finish second in the NL in team ERA. Defensively, the Dodgers led the NL with a .982 fielding percentage, and Campanella gunned down 29 of 52 (56%) would-be base stealers. The Yankees, led by the effusive Casey Stengel, recovered from the retirement of Joe DiMaggio, and the loss of Bobby Brown, Jerry Coleman and Tom Morgan to the service. The Yankees matched the Dodgers in hitting as they finished first or second in the AL in runs scored, home runs, batting average, and slugging percentage. Mickey Mantle had a breakout season leading the Yankees in batting (.311), and slugging (.530). Yogi Berra led the Yanks in runs (97), HRs (30) and RBIs (98). The Yankees had a pitching staff that led the AL in ERA (3.14). Allie Reynolds led the team with 20 wins and led the league with 2.08 ERA. Casey Stengel rotated his pitchers all year with seven having at least 12 starts, but none working more than 35 games. Defensive standout Phil Rizzuto led AL shortstops with 458 assists and made only 19 errors. Game 1 Joe Black Joe Black pitched a complete game and became the first African-American pitcher to win a World Series game. Jackie Robinson's lead off home run in the second off of Allie Reynolds put the Dodgers up 1‚Äì0, but Gil McDougald tied the game with a lead off home run of his own in the third. Duke Snider's two- run home run in the sixth put the Dodgers back in front 3‚Äì1. The Yankees cut the lead to 3‚Äì2 on a Gene Woodling triple and Hank Bauer sacrifice fly in the top of the eighth, but Pee Wee Reese gave the Dodgers that run back with a two-out home run in the eighth off of Ray Scarborough as Brooklyn won 4‚Äì2 to take a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 Vic Raschi Vic Raschi's complete-game three-hitter and nine strikeouts dominated this game. He was behind 1‚Äì0 after a Roy Campanella RBI single in the third, but the Yankees in the fourth tied it when Mickey Mantle doubled, took third on a groundout and scored on a Yogi Berra sacrifice fly off of Carl Erskine. Next inning, Gil McDougald drew a leadoff walk, stole second and scored on Billy Martin's single to put the Yankees up 2‚Äì1. A five-run Yankee sixth broke it open. Two singles and a walk loaded the bases before Billy Loes relieved Erskine and allowed an RBI groundout to Joe Collins, RBI single to McDougald, and three-run home run to Martin to put the Yankees up 7‚Äì1. The series was tied 1‚Äì1 shifting to the Bronx. Game 3 Preacher Roe In Game 3, the Yankees struck first in the second on Eddie Lopat's RBI single with two on off of Preacher Roe, but the Dodgers tied the game off of Lopat in the third on Jackie Robinson's sacrifice fly with two on. In the fifth, Billy Cox singled, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Pee Wee Reese's RBI single. In the eighth, after two leadoff singles, Andy Pafko's sacrifice fly made it 3‚Äì1 Dodgers. Yogi Berra's home run in the bottom of the inning cut the lead to 3‚Äì2, but in the ninth, Reese and Robinson singled, then (after Lopat was relieved by Tom Gorman) did a double steal. A passed ball allowed both to score to make it 5‚Äì2 Dodgers. Johnny Mize's home run in the bottom of the inning made it 5‚Äì3 Dodgers, but Roe retired the next two men to end the game and give the Dodgers a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Game 4 Allie Reynolds In Game 4, the score was 1‚Äì0 in the eighth, a Johnny Mize home run in the fourth off of Joe Black being the difference, when Dodgers reliever Johnny Rutherford came into the game. The first batter he faced was Mickey Mantle, who tripled to deep left-center, then kept coming home when the throw to third got away, scoring a key insurance run for the Yankees. Both sides got just four hits in the contest. Allie Reynolds pitched a complete game shutout as the Yankees 2‚Äì0 win tied the series at two games apiece. Game 5 Carl Erskine The Dodgers struck first in the second off of Ewell Blackwell on Andy Pafko's RBI single with two on. In the fourth, with runners on second and third, Pee Wee Reese's sacrifice fly made it 2‚Äì0 Dodgers, then Duke Snider's two-run home run extended their lead to 4‚Äì0. Carl Erskine pitched four shutout innings before the Yankees torched him in the fifth. After a walk and single, Irv Noren's RBI single and Gil McDougald's forceout scored a run each. After a single and pop out, Johnny Mize's three- run home run put the Yankees ahead 5‚Äì4. In the seventh, Billy Cox singled, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Snider's RBI single, tying the game off of Johnny Sain. The game went into extra innings and in the top of the 11th, Billy Cox got his third hit of the game, moved up on a Pee Wee Reese hit and scored on Duke Snider's double off reliever Johnny Sain for what turned out to be the winning run. Erskine pitched all 11 innings for Brooklyn, retiring the last 19 batters he faced, closing it out by retiring future Hall of Famers Mickey Mantle, Johnny Mize and Yogi Berra 1-2-3. The Dodgers were one win away from a championship as the series returned to Brooklyn. Game 6 Billy Martin's game-saving catch in Game 7. In Game 6, with a 3‚Äì2 Series lead and the final two at Ebbets Field, the Dodgers looked to chase away the demons of 1951.Comments made by Mel Allen or Red Barber during NBC's original game broadcast. Billy Loes (13‚Äì8) faced Vic Raschi (16‚Äì6). Dodger Manager Chuck Dressen made a curious lineup change with George Shuba batting fifth, replacing Andy Pafko. Dressen placed Roy Campanella in the sixth spot and left Gil Hodges to bat seventh. In the Dodger half of the first inning, with Duke Snider on second and Jackie Robinson on first, Shuba grounded out to Billy Martin to end the inning. In the Yankee fourth, Yogi Berra reached second base when Pee Wee Reese uncorked a wild throw on a double-play attempt, but the Yankees could not capitalize. In the fifth inning, the Dodgers turned a remarkable double play. Yankee Irv Noren led off with a single, followed by a Vic Raschi bunt. Gil Hodges picked up the bunt, turned and fired to Reese at second, who in lightning succession fired to Robinson covering first just in time to retire Raschi. In the Dodger sixth, Snider sent Raschi's first pitch over the of screen in back of right field and onto Bedford Avenue for 1‚Äì0 lead. In the top of the seventh, Yogi Berra matched Snider's home run with one of his own, again onto Bedford Avenue. Gene Woodling followed with a single and Dodger pitcher Billy Loes balked him to second. Raschi then made up for his bunt-turned-double-play by getting a hit, literally off Loes. The ball ricocheted off Loes and into right field bringing Woodling home for a 2‚Äì1 lead. In another curious move Dressen allowed pitcher Billy Loes to hit for himself in the seventh. Loes singled and promptly stole second. But Raschi struck out Billy Cox to end the inning. Mantle led off the Yankee eighth inning with the first of his 18 World Series home runs. Mantle's shot set a record for home runs by one team and for both teams in a single Series at 13. Snider continued the home run fest by launching another one in the bottom of the eighth. Jackie Robinson then sent left fielder Gene Woodling to the wall for an out and Shuba doubled to send Raschi to the showers. Allie Reynolds relieved and quickly ended the Dodger eighth. Reynolds, known as \\"The Chief\\", again made quick work of the Dodgers in the ninth including striking out Rocky Nelson, who had pinch-hit for Hodges, preserving the 3‚Äì2 win. Game 7 Mickey Mantle Game 7 pitted Joe Black (15‚Äì4) vs Eddie Lopat (10‚Äì5). Black, who came out of the Negro Leagues and was not even on the Dodgers spring training roster, had already pitched a complete game win in Game 1 of the Series, pitched seven innings in a 2‚Äì0 loss in Game 4 and would be starting his third game in seven days. At that time there were no days off between games as both teams played in New York. For the Yankees, Billy Martin continued his solid play. Martin sat on the bench for most of the season's first two months and took over second base duties when Casey Stengel moved Gil McDougald from second to third base to replace military-bound Bobby Brown. Phil Rizzuto led off the Yankee fourth with a double and Johnny Mize singled him home for a 1‚Äì0 lead. In the Dodger fourth, a single by Duke Snider followed by two consecutive sacrifice attempts by Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella, intended to move runners over, loaded the bases instead. Allie Reynolds replaced Lopat and retired Gil Hodges with a fly to left that scored Snider. Reynolds struck out George Shuba, then induced Carl Furillo to ground out, leaving Robinson at third and the game tied 1‚Äì1. In the fifth inning, Gene Woodling homered for the Yankees, and the Dodgers' Billy Cox doubled followed by a Pee Wee Reese single tied the game at 2‚Äì2. Mickey Mantle demonstrated his penchant for coming up big in World Series play with a home run in the sixth inning and RBI single in the seventh (off of Preacher Roe) to give the Bronx Bombers a 4‚Äì2 lead. The Brooklyn boys loaded the bases again in the seventh, when Vic Raschi walked Furillo, Cox singled and Reese walked. Stengel called on Bob Kuzava, who retired Snider, setting the stage for Billy Martin. With two out and the runners moving, Jackie Robinson popped-up to the right of the mound. Kuzava hesitated, looking to his fielders. Martin charged hard from his position deep at second and caught the ball off his shoetops, to end the inning and save as many as 3 runs. Kuzava then quickly put the Dodgers down in the eighth and ninth to give the Yankees their fourth consecutive World Championship. The Yankees batted .216 and the Dodgers only .215 in this tightly contested series. Composite box 1952 World Series (4‚Äì3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.)

In the Series, the Yankees showed some power of their own, including Gil McDougald's grand slam home run in Game 5, at the Polo Grounds. The Yankees won the Series in six games, for their third straight title and 14th overall. This would be the last World Series for Joe DiMaggio, who retired afterward, and the first for rookies Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle. This was the last Subway Series the Giants played in. Both teams would meet again eleven years later after the Giants relocated to San Francisco. They have not played a World Series against each other since. This was the first World Series announced by Bob Sheppard, who was in his first year as Yankee Stadium's public address announcer. It was also the first World Series to be televised exclusively by one network (NBC) as well as the first to be televised nationwide, as coaxial cable had recently linked both coasts. Background This World Series also matched up two of baseball's most colorful managers, Casey Stengel of the Yankees and Leo Durocher of the Giants. This was the 13th appearance by the Giants in Series play, their ninth loss, and their first appearance since the 1937 World Series. \\"The Commerce Comet arrives on the final voyage of the Yankee Clipper.\\" (On the Yankees' side, the 1951 World Series was the first for Mickey Mantle and the final for Joe DiMaggio.) Mantle's bad luck with injuries in the Major Leagues began here. In the fifth inning of Game 2 at Yankee Stadium, Mays flied to deep right center. DiMaggio and Mantle converged on the ball, DiMaggio called Mantle off, and Mantle stutter-stepped, catching a cleat in a drain cover, and fell to the ground in a heap with a wrenched knee as DiMaggio made the catch. Mantle was done for this Series, but would come back to play many more. New York City became the first city to host an NBA Finals and a World Series in the same calendar year. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Monte Irvin Monte Irvin's daring baserunning got the Giants off to a fast start in this New York ‚Äì New York series. He singled in the first inning, sped to third on Whitey Lockman's RBI single, then stole home off Yankee starter Allie Reynolds. The Yankees cut the Giants' lead to 2‚Äì1 in the second when Gil McDougald doubled with one out off Dave Koslo and scored on Jerry Coleman's single. The scored remained that way until the sixth when Alvin Dark's three- run home run gave the Giants a commanding 5‚Äì1 lead. Koslo pitched a complete game to give the Giants a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 Eddie Lopat The first three batters Larry Jansen faced were Mickey Mantle, Phil Rizzuto and Gil McDougald, all of whom singled for a quick 1-0 Yankee lead. It could have been worse, but the next batter Joe DiMaggio bounced into a 6-4-3 double play and Yogi Berra struck out. The next inning, Joe Collins's home run extended the Yankees' lead to 2‚Äì0. Monte Irvin scored in the seventh, tagging and coming home on pinch-hitter Bill Rigney's bases-loaded sacrifice fly, as the Giants got within 2‚Äì1. But winning pitcher Eddie Lopat, who pitched a complete game, helped himself to an insurance run with an RBI single in the eighth after Bobby Brown hit a leadoff single and moved to second on a groundout off George Spencer. The Yankees' 3‚Äì1 win tied the series shifting to the Polo Grounds. Game 3 Whitey Lockman The Giants struck first in Game 1 when Bobby Thomson hit a leadoff double and scored on Willie Mays's single in the second, then a five-run fifth inning was the undoing of Yankee starter Vic Raschi. Eddie Stanky walked with one out, moved to third on an error, and scored on Al Dark's single. After a Hank Thompson single, another error on Monte Irvin's fielder's choice allowed another run to score and put two on, then a Whitey Lockman three-run home run gave Giants starter Jim Hearn a comfortable 6‚Äì0 lead. The Yankees scored a run in the eighth on a bases-loaded walk to Joe Collins, then in the ninth on Gene Woodling's home run off Sheldon Jones, who retired the next two batters to end the game and give the Giants a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Game 4 Allie Reynolds The Giants struck first in Game 4 when Al Dark doubled with one out in the first off Allie Reynolds and scored on Monte Irvin's single, but the Yankees tied the game in the second on Joe Collins's RBI single with two on off Sal Maglie. After a single and walk, Reynolds's RBI single in the fourth put the Yankees up 2‚Äì1. Joe DiMaggio's first home run of the Series followed a Yogi Berra single in the fifth extended their lead to 4‚Äì1. In the seventh, reliever Sheldon Jones allowed a single and walk, then an error on a pickoff attempt allowed one run to score before Gil McDougald's RBI single made it 6‚Äì1 Yankees. Reynolds allowed a one-out RBI single to Bobby Thomson in the ninth before getting Willie Mays to hit into the game-ending double play as the Yankees tied the series with a 6‚Äì2 win. Game 5 Gil McDougald The Giants struck first in Game 5 when Al Dark singled with one out in the first and scored on Monte Irvin's single aided by left fielder Gene Woodling's error, but starter Eddie Lopat kept them scoreless for the rest of the game while the Yankees hammered Larry Jansen, Monty Kennedy and George Spencer. After two one-out walks in the third, Joe DiMaggio's RBI single tied the game, then after an intentional walk loaded the bases, Gil McDougald's grand slam off Jansen put the Yankees up 5‚Äì1. Next inning, Phil Rizzuto's home run off Kennedy after a walk extended their lead to 7‚Äì1. In the sixth, Rizzuto singled off Spencer before Yogi Berra's single and Johnny Mize's double scored a run each, making it 9‚Äì1 Yankees. In the seventh, a bases-loaded walk to Rizzuto forced in a run, then Al Corwin threw a wild pitch that let another run score before DiMaggio's two-run double capped the game's scoring at 13‚Äì1 Yankees, who were a win away from the World Series championship as the series returned to Yankee Stadium. Game 6 Hank Bauer The Yankees struck first in Game 6 on Gil McDougald's bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the first off Dave Koslo. The Giants tied the game in the fifth off Vic Raschi when Willie Mays hit a leadoff single, moved two bases on a wild pitch and sacrifice fly, and scored on Eddie Stanky's sacrifice fly. Playing right field in place of Mickey Mantle, Hank Bauer benefited from a tricky Yankee Stadium wind‚Äîas well as the umpire's generous call of a ball on Dave Koslo's two-strike pitch‚Äîto belt a bases-loaded triple in the sixth inning that would be the difference. Bauer also ensured that the lead held up. Trailing 4‚Äì1 in the ninth, the Giants loaded the bases with no outs on three singles off Johnny Sain. Enter reliever Bob Kuzava, acquired in June from the Washington Senators. After two sacrifice flies and the score now 4‚Äì3, pinch hitter Sal Yvars hit a sinking liner to right. The stadium crowd gasped as Bauer momentarily lost the ball in the crowd's white shirts and the shadows. But he located it again and charged forward. Bauer, who played in nine World Series and always came through when it mattered most, slid on his knees to catch the ball inches off the ground to end the game and the 1951 World Series. Game 6 was the last baseball game ever played by Joe DiMaggio. Composite line score 1951 World Series (4‚Äì2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)

Australia = Australian Capital Territory  Family and Community Day was celebrated on the first Tuesday of November from 2007‚Äì2009, coinciding with the Melbourne Cup. This public holiday was declared in 2007. Andrew Barr, then ACT Minister for Industrial Relations, stated the purpose of the new public holiday was: \\"...to enable workers to take a break from their hectic work and to spend some quality time with their family and friends. ... Australians do work the longest hours of any country in the western world. We do deserve a break.\\" In the years 2010‚Äì2016, the date was moved to the first Monday of the September/October school holidays. Where the first Monday of the school holidays falls on the ACT Labour Day public holiday (first Monday in October), the holiday is moved to the second Monday of the ACT school holidays. In 2018, Family and Community Day will no longer be a public holiday in the ACT. Replacing it is Reconciliation Day, held on the first Monday on or after May 27.  Canada  Nearly two-thirds of Canadians reside in a province that observes a statutory holiday on the third Monday of February. The holiday is called Family Day in five provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan), Louis Riel Day in Manitoba, and Islander Day in Prince Edward Island. There is no federally established Family Day. This holiday was first observed in Alberta in 1990, followed by Saskatchewan in 2007 and Ontario in 2008. On May 28, 2012, the BC government announced that Family Day would be observed on the second Monday in February each year, starting February 11, 2013. https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/post- secondary_education_training_and_labour/news/news_release.2017.04.0568.html The week of its observance was changed from the second Monday of February to the third Monday starting in 2019. In April 2017, the NB government announced the family statutory holiday to begin in February 2018. In February 2018, the BC government announced that Family Day would move to the third Monday in February from 2019 onward, aligning the holiday with other Canadian provinces. As a new holiday, there are no traditional activities that are associated with the day. Canadians use the long weekend for whatever purpose they like. In at least British Columbia, the decision to add this public holiday is due to the lack of any public holiday between lengthy gap between the New Year's day and Good Friday public holidays. Otherwise, Canadian provinces have a public holiday at least every other month. Family Day is unrelated to National Family Week, a campaign put on each October by the Canadian Association of Family Resource Programs.  South Africa  After 1995, Easter Monday was renamed Family Day.  United States  Family Day is a state holiday in Nevada, celebrated on the day after Thanksgiving, i.e. the Friday following the fourth Thursday in November. American Family Day is a state holiday in Arizona and has been celebrated on the first Sunday in August since 1978.  Uruguay  In Uruguay, the public holiday on December 25 is officially known as Family Day () rather than Christmas, for the sake of secularism.  Vanuatu  Family Day in Vanuatu is celebrated annually on December 26, traditionally Boxing Day, as a day on which school and work are suspended in order to spend the day giving thanks for and enjoying time with one's family, often by engaging in civic and religious events and a festive meal.  Vietnam  Vietnamese Family Day () occurs on the 28th of June each year, having been established in 2001.

It shares themes with a number of movies from the mid-1990s, most notably Natural Born Killers by Oliver Stone and Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs by Quentin Tarantino. The play version of the novel is used by the IEB (Independent Education Board) In South Africa as one of their Postmodern set-work plays for Dramatic Arts.  Plot summary  The book takes place in different parts of Los Angeles, California. The date is never actually specified, but various clues suggest it is set in the near future. Mostly the story takes place in the centre of Hollywood. The book depicts the differences between different social groups in America, from rich people with guards like Bruce Delamitri to poorer people Wayne and Scout. The protagonist, Bruce Delamitiri, is an artist who works in the motion picture industry. Many people in the US think that, by making these movies, Bruce makes killing cool. Numerous characters throughout the book imply that he encourages everyone who's watching these movies to kill for fun. Bruce, on the other hand, defends himself by telling everyone that he doesn‚Äôt think he encourages anyone to do anything. He says that there has always been violence but humans are not like robots; seeing something on the screen does not necessarily make us want to do it ourselves (p. 13 \\"people get up from the movie theatre or the TV and do what they just saw\\"). He also claims that he is just showing existing violence. Unfortunately for Bruce, Wayne and Scout (a pair of psychopaths known in the media as the \\"Mall Murderers\\") have formulated a plan to hold him hostage and have him publicly announce that his movies are responsible for their crimes so they can avoid the death penalty (Wayne has a lengthy speech giving examples of how in America it is possible to be guilty and innocent at the same time.) As the novel progresses, Bruce and a critically injured Brooke Daniels are joined inside his house by his wife and daughter and a TV camera crew. The siege reaches its climax as Wayne holds a ratings monitor and announces on live TV that he will spare the hostages if everyone stops watching the siege in the next few minutes - however, this does not happen and he begins firing as the LAPD begin a frantic attempt to subdue him. Many of the characters die in the ensuing violence and the epilogue of the story reveals grim details as to how all the survivors have found a way of escaping responsibility for the tragedy using varying routes from lawsuits and finding religion to making documentaries which explicitly blame everyone else. The book ends with the line \\"No one has taken responsibility\\" ‚Äî echoing an earlier rant by Bruce that we have created a blame free society in which any problem or shortcoming can be blamed on others rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.  Characters  * Bruce Delamitri - the main protagonist, an egocentric filmmaker who has become controversial for the celluloid violence he produces. * Wayne - A cruel and immoral killer. * Scout - Wayne's lover and confidant. * Brooke Daniels - A vaguely abnormal model and aspiring actress. * Velvet Delamitri - Bruce's estranged daughter. * Farrah Delamitri - Bruce's estranged wife. * Karl Brezner - Bruce's agent.

It is best remembered for its dramatic conclusion; with runners on second and third and two out in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 7, Hall-of-Famer Willie McCovey hit an exceptionally hard line drive that was caught by second baseman Bobby Richardson to preserve a one-run victory for the Yankees. The Giants had won their first NL pennant since 1954 and first since moving from New York in 1958. They advanced by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-game playoff. The Giants had a higher cumulative batting average (.226-.199) and lower earned-run average (2.66-2.95), had more hits (51-44), runs (21-20), hit more home runs (5-3), triples (2-1) and doubles (10-6), yet lost the Series. They would not return to the Fall Classic for another 27 years. The Yankees took the Series in seven games for the 20th championship in team history. The Yankees had won their first World Series in 1923; of the 40 Series played between 1923 and 1962, the Yankees won half. After a long dominance of the World Series picture, the Yankees would not win another World Series for another 15 years despite appearances in 1963, 1964, and 1976. This World Series, which was closely matched in every game, is also remembered for its then-record length of 13 days, caused by postponements due to rain in both cities. Summary NOTE: the series was originally scheduled to begin October 3, but was moved back one day due to the three-game playoff between the Giants and Dodgers to determine the National League pennant. ‚Ä†: postponed from October 9 due to rain ‚Ä†‚Ä†: postponed from October 11 due to rain Matchups=Game 1 Clete Boyer Roger Maris' two-run double in the first inning off Billy O'Dell set up Yankee starter Whitey Ford with a lead, but Willie Mays scored for the Giants on Jose Pagan's single in the second, ending Ford's record World Series consecutive scoreless inning streak at . Chuck Hiller's double and Felipe Alou's single in the third tied the game, but the Yankees broke the tie in the seventh on Clete Boyer's home run. Next inning, Dale Long followed a single and hit-by-pitch with an RBI single to make it 4‚Äì2 Yankees and knock O'Dell out of the game. Boyer's sacrifice fly off Don Larsen extended their lead to 5‚Äì2. The Yankees got a final run in the ninth on Elston Howard's RBI single off Stu Miller, the run charged to Larsen. Ford's complete-game victory was the first of six in the series, four for the Yankees and two for the Giants. Game 2 Willie McCovey The Giants scored two runs in Game 2, in the first when Chuck Hiller hit a leadoff double off Ralph Terry and scored on two ground outs, then in the seventh when Willie McCovey smashed a tremendous home run over the right-field fence to boost 24-game winner Jack Sanford to a 2‚Äì0 shutout of the Yankees, who managed only three hits. Game 3 Bill Stafford The Yankees ended a scoreless tie in the seventh with three runs. After two leadoff singles, Roger Maris drove a base hit off starter Billy Pierce for two runs, then after moving to third on a sacrifice fly, he scored the eventual winning run on Clete Boyer's groundout off Don Larsen when the Giants were unable to turn an inning-ending double play. Giants catcher Ed Bailey's two-run home run in the top of the ninth off Bill Stafford left them a run short. Game 4 Chuck Hiller For the second time in as many games, a Giants catcher stroked a two-run home run, when Tom Haller hit one off Whitey Ford in the second inning. After the Yankees tied the score at 2‚Äì2 in the sixth on back-to-back walks off reliever Bobby Bolin followed by back-to-back RBI singles by Bill Skowron and Clete Boyer, second baseman Chuck Hiller hit the first National League grand slam in World Series history in the seventh off Marshall Bridges with two of the runs charged to reliever Jim Coates. The Giants scored another run in the ninth off Bridges when Matty Alou hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Chuck Hiller's single. The Yankees got that run back on three straight two-out singles off Billy O'Dell, the last an RBI single by Tom Tresh, but Mickey Mantle hit into a forceout to end the game as the Giants won 7‚Äì3. This game marked the only World Series appearance for Juan Marichal, who started for the Giants. Marichal smashed the thumb on his pitching hand while attempting to bunt in the top of the fifth, and was placed on the disabled list for the remainder of the series. Don Larsen was the winning pitcher in relief, six years to the day after (and in the same stadium of) his perfect game in the 1956 World Series. Game 5 Tom Tresh Games 5 and 6 were postponed by rain. Game 5 at New York was pushed back one day, but Game 6 in San Francisco was pushed back four days due to torrential rain on the West Coast. Three of the longest World Series in terms of total days, due to various postponements, involved the Giants: the 1911 and the 1989 were the other two. In Game 5, hot- hitting Jos√© Pag√°n hit a leadoff single in the third off Ralph Terry, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, then scored on Chuck Hiller's RBI single. After a wild pitch from Jack Sanford tied the game in the fourth, Pagan's home run in the fifth put the Giants back in front 2‚Äì1, but another wild pitch in the sixth by Sanford tied the game again. In the eighth, Bobby Richardson and Tony Kubek hit back-to-back singles before Tom Tresh hit the game-winning three-run home run. The Giants scored a run in the ninth when Willie McCovey hit a leadoff single and scored on Tom Haller's one-out double, but Terry retired the next two hitters to end the game. With the series returning to San Francisco the Yankees had the edge, three games to two, only to have the sixth game delayed four days by rain. Game 6 Orlando Cepeda In a battle of left-handed starting pitchers, Billy Pierce outdueled Whitey Ford with a complete-game three-hitter as the Giants evened the series at three wins apiece with a 5‚Äì2 victory. They struck first in the fourth when after a single and walk, an error on an attempted pickoff by Ford allowed a run to score, then Orlando Cepeda's double and Jim Davenport's single scored a run each. They added to their lead next inning on RBI singles by Felipe Alou and Cepeda. The Yankees' only runs came on a Maris home run in the fifth inning and an RBI single by Tony Kubek in the eighth inning after a one-out double. Game 7 Ralph Terry The only run of this classic game came in the fifth inning when Tony Kubek grounded into a double play, Bill Skowron scoring from third. Ralph Terry, pitching the seventh game instead of Jim Bouton because of the rain delays, had given up Bill Mazeroski's Series-winning walk-off home run two years earlier in Pittsburgh, but in his third start stifled the Giants' power hitters. In the bottom of the ninth, pinch-hitter Matty Alou, batting for reliever Billy O'Dell, led off the inning with a bunt hit after first having a foul ball dropped, but Terry struck out the next two batters, Felipe Alou and Hiller. Mays hit a double into the right-field corner, but Maris played the carom well, then hit cutoff man Richardson with a throw that was quickly relayed home. Alou, aware of Maris' strong arm, stopped at third. Facing Willie McCovey with two outs, Terry elected to pitch to him rather than walk the bases loaded, which would have brought up slugger Orlando Cepeda. Terry's inside fastball on the second pitch handcuffed McCovey, who nonetheless adjusted his bat in mid-swing to extend his arms and hit what he later claimed was the hardest ball he had ever struck. The line drive appeared at first to be going over the head of a well-positioned Richardson, but was in fact sinking from topspin and Richardson made the catch without leaping to end the game. Terry was named the World Series MVP. The Yankees won their 20th World Series; they would not win another until 1977. The Giants would not win another National League pennant until 1989, when they would lose the World Series to the Oakland A's in a series interrupted by a major earthquake. The Giants would win the World Series in 2010, their first in San Francisco. Composite box 1962 World Series (4‚Äì3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over San Francisco Giants (N.L.) QuotesAftermath For the Peanuts comic strip of December 22, 1962, cartoonist and Giants fan Charles M. Schulz depicted Charlie Brown sitting glumly with Linus, lamenting in the last panel, \\"Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?\\" The January 28, 1963, strip featured a nearly identical scene, except in the last panel Charlie Brown moaned, \\"Or why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball even two feet higher?\\" During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, Giants radio flagship KNBR rebroadcast Game 7, electronically re-editing NBC Radio announcer George Kell's description to make it sound as if McCovey's ninth-inning liner had gotten past Richardson, with Alou and Mays scoring to win the game and Series for San Francisco. 48 years later, following additional World Series losses in and , the Giants would finally bring the first Series championship to San Francisco in .

This World Series was surrounded by Cold War political puns pitting the \\"Reds\\" against the \\"Yanks.\\" But the louder buzz concerned the \\"M&M;\\" boys, Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle, who spent the summer chasing the ghost of Babe Ruth and his 60‚Äìhome run season of 1927. Mantle finished with 54 while Maris set the record of 61 on the last day of the season. With all the attention surrounding the home run race, the World Series seemed almost anticlimatic. The Yankees were under the leadership of first- year manager Ralph Houk, who had succeeded Casey Stengel. The Yankees won the American League pennant, finishing eight games better than the Detroit Tigers. The Bronx Bombers also set a Major League record for most home runs in a season with 240. Along with Maris and Mantle, four other Yankees, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, Bill Skowron, and Johnny Blanchard, hit more than 20 home runs. The pitching staff was led by Cy Young Award-winner Whitey Ford (25‚Äì4, 3.21). The underdog Reds, skippered by Fred Hutchinson, finished four games ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League and boasted four 20-plus home run hitters of their own: NL MVP Frank Robinson, Gordy Coleman, Gene Freese and Wally Post. The second-base, shortstop, and catcher positions were platooned, while center fielder Vada Pinson led the league in hits with 208 and finished second in batting with a .343 average. Joey Jay (21‚Äì10, 3.53) led the staff, along with dependable Jim O'Toole and Bob Purkey. The American League added two teams, the Los Angeles Angels and the Washington Senators, through expansion and also increased teams' respective schedules by eight games to 162. The National League was a year away from its own expansion as the Reds and the other NL teams maintained the 154-game schedule. The Most Valuable Player Award for the series went to lefty Whitey Ford, who won two games while throwing 14 shutout innings. Ford left the sixth inning of Game 4 due to an injured ankle. He set the record for consecutive scoreless innings during World Series play with 32, when, during the third inning he passed the previous record holder, Babe Ruth, who had pitched consecutive scoreless innings for the Boston Red Sox in and . Ford would extend that record to in the 1962 World Series. The 1961 five-game series was the shortest since , when the New York Giants swept the Cleveland Indians in four games. These two teams would meet again 15 years later in the 1976 World Series, which the Reds would win in a four-game sweep. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Bill Skowron At Yankee Stadium, Whitey Ford established himself as the premier post-season pitcher by tossing his third straight World Series shutout. A fourth-inning shot into the lower right-field stands by Elston Howard was all Ford would need. Moose Skowron added a sixth-inning shot into the lower left-field to make it 2‚Äì0. The two-hour, 11-minute game featured only two hits by the Reds, a first-inning single to left by Eddie Kasko and a fifth-inning single by Wally Post. The only other Reds baserunner was Frank Robinson, who walked in the seventh. Otherwise, Ford was dominant, adding six strikeouts. Jim O'Toole pitched well for the Reds, allowing just six hits in seven innings. Ford was also aided by two excellent defensive plays by third baseman Clete Boyer. In the second inning, Boyer backhanded a Gene Freese ground ball close to the bag, wheeled, and threw out his third-base counterpart from his knees. In the eighth, Boyer dove to his left onto his stomach after a Dick Gernert ground ball; coming up with the ball, Boyer threw Gernert out, also from his knees. Game 2 Home plate collision involving Elston Howard Joey Jay The Reds came charging back on superb pitching by Joey Jay to win Game 2 and even the series. Reds first baseman Gordy Coleman and Yankees' left-fielder Yogi Berra traded two-run homers in the fourth. Coleman hit his homer into the right- center field bleachers after Frank Robinson reached on an error by Yankees' third-baseman Clete Boyer. After Roger Maris led off the bottom half of the inning with a walk, Berra tied the score with a drive into the lower right- field stands. From there, Jay would give up only two more hits, a Berra single in the sixth and a Tony Kubek single to center in the eighth. The Reds continued to score with single runs in the fifth and sixth and two in the eighth. The Reds went ahead for good with two outs in the fifth when Elio Chac√≥n sprinted home from third on an Elston Howard passed ball that didn't get much further than away. Yankee starter Ralph Terry would give up one more run in the sixth on a Wally Post double and a run- scoring single by eighth- place hitter Johnny Edwards, before being lifted in the seventh for pinch- hitter H√©ctor L√≥pez. Luis Arroyo took over in the eighth and walked Robinson, gave up an infield single to Coleman on a roller between third and the mound and then threw wild to first, with Robinson scoring; Coleman was thrown out trying for third. The next batter, Wally Post, reached safely when Berra misplayed his fly for a three-base error. With Post on third, Gene Freese was intentionally walked for the second time in the game and Edwards followed with his second hit, a bloop double to left, scoring Post. Jay would seal the victory for the Reds by retiring six of the remaining seven batters, allowing only a walk to Clete Boyer in the ninth. The series shifted to Cincinnati with the pressure on New York. After falling to a perceived inferior team (the Pittsburgh Pirates) in the 1960 World Series, a loss that cost long-time manager Casey Stengel his job, fans and media were wondering if it could happen again as the Yankees limped into Cincinnati with the series tied, having scored a total of just four runs and 10 hits in the first two games as several of the Yankee hitters struggled including the \\"M&M; Boys.\\" Game 3 Roger Maris Cincinnati hosted its first World Series in 21 years at Crosley Field. 99-year-old Dummy Hoy, a former Red and the oldest living former Major League player at the time, threw out the first pitch. Game 3 pitted New York's 23-year-old right-hander Bill Stafford against Reds' veteran knuckleballer Bob Purkey. Stafford pitched well for innings. Purkey also had outstanding control and kept the Yankee hitters off balance, but New York would triumph on a Maris home run in the ninth. While the Yankees' offense still was stagnant, it was just good enough. Cincinnati struck first with a run in the bottom of the third when Elio Chac√≥n beat out a bunt and took second when Stafford threw wildly to first. Eddie Kasko fouled out to Bill Skowron and Vada Pinson grounded out to send Chac√≥n to third before Frank Robinson hit a double off the left-field wall to make it 1‚Äì0. In the seventh, the Yankees got a big break to tie the game. Tony Kubek led off with a single to center, then took second on a Johnny Edwards passed ball. After Mickey Mantle struck out, Yogi Berra blooped a ball into short right field that neither second baseman Chac√≥n nor right fielder Robinson called before the two collided, allowing the ball to drop as Kubek scored. The Reds regained the lead in their half of the inning when Edwards doubled into the right-field corner and eventually scored on a Kasko single to left. Bud Daley came in to relieve Stafford and retired Pinson on a flyout to right to end the inning. The Reds' lead would be short-lived, as the Yankees tied the score in the eighth. With two outs, Johnny Blanchard (pinch-hitting for Daley), smacked a Purkey knuckler into the right-field bleachers. The Reds went quietly in the bottom of the inning, the score tied at 2‚Äì2. In the ninth, Maris recorded what would be one of only two hits in the Series, but this one went into the right field bleachers for a go-ahead home run. With ace reliever Luis Arroyo on the mound for the Yankees in the ninth, the Reds had one last shot. After Gene Freese struck out, Leo C√°rdenas, batting for Johnny Edwards, doubled off the left-center field scoreboard. Dick Gernert, pinch-hitting for Purkey, grounded out to short, Cardenas holding. The third pinch-hitter in the inning, Gus Bell, ended the Reds' comeback attempt by grounding back to the mound, Arroyo to Skowron, to end the thriller and give the Yankees a two games to one Series lead. Game 4 Whitey Ford Whitey Ford started Game 4 for the Yankees in an attempt to continue his post-season shutout streak, but more importantly to give the Bombers a 3‚Äì1 lead in the Series. He accomplished both. Ford retired the first nine batters of the game; when Elio Chac√≥n grounded out to Bobby Richardson at second base for the final out in the third, Ford broke Babe Ruth's record of consecutive scoreless innings. Ford remained in the game until the end of the fifth, when an apparent ankle injury forced him to leave, his new record at 32 consecutive shutout innings. Jim Coates entered the game in the sixth and pitched four shutout innings. The Yankees scored the game's first run in the fourth. Roger Maris led off with a walk and went to third on a single to left-center by Mickey Mantle. Elston Howard grounded into a double play, Maris scoring. The Yankees added another run in the fifth on a walk to Ford, a Bobby Richardson single to right-center and a run-scoring single by in Tony Kubek. In the sixth, O'Toole was relieved by Jim Brosnan who got into a jam. With one out, Howard doubled to right-center. After Yogi Berra was intentionally walked, Skowron loaded the bases by beating out a slow roller to third. Clete Boyer then doubled to left to plate two runs. The Yankees put on the safety squeeze, only to have Ford bunt right to Reds first baseman Gordy Coleman who tagged first base. Boyer had moved to third and Skowron had come halfway home before stopping. Coleman then raced across the diamond and tagged Skowron, who was trapped between third and home, for an unassisted double play. The Yankees would add three more runs in the seventh to put the game away. New York's seven-run output equaled what the Bronx Bombers were able to put up combined in their first three games as solid Reds starting pitching, combined with a wounded Mantle, kept the New York offense sputtering. That would change in Game 5\\\\. Game 5 Johnny Blanchard Future Hall-of-Famers Yogi Berra and Mickey Mantle sat out Game 5, Berra with a stiff shoulder, Mantle still suffering from a hip abscess. But substitutes H√©ctor L√≥pez and Johnny Blanchard more than made up for the absence of the two stars. Lopez drove in five runs with a triple and a home run, and Blanchard had three hits, including a double and a homer. In the first four games, the Yankees scored a total of nine runs off Cincinnati's starting pitchers. In Game 5, New York scored five in the first inning. Reds starter Joey Jay, with 14 regular-season complete games, would uncharacteristically get just two outs before being relieved. After Bobby Richardson singled to start the game, Jay retired Tony Kubek and Roger Maris on fly balls. But the flood gates opened when Blanchard hit a two-run homer into the right-field bleachers. Elston Howard was awarded a ground-rule double when his blast went through an opening in the left-center field scoreboard. Bill Skowron followed with a long single off the left-field fence, scoring Howard. Jim Maloney entered the game and was greeted with a Lopez triple that scored Skowron. Clete Boyer continued the assault doubling off the scoreboard, scoring Lopez. The ninth batter of the inning, Yankee pitcher Ralph Terry mercifully struck out to end the inning but not until five Yankees had touched home plate. New York added to its lead in the second on a Kubek single and a Maris double just inside the left-field line. The Reds cut the lead in half in the bottom of the third and chased Terry in the process. Don Blasingame led off with a single to center, Eddie Kasko singled to left and Vada Pinson hit a fly moving Blasingame to third. Frank Robinson then took Terry deep with a three-run shot over the right-center field fence. Bud Daley replaced Terry and shut the door on the Reds. The Yankee offense added to its lead with five runs in the fourth, the big blows were a two-run single by Skowron and a three-run home run to dead center by Lopez. The Reds got a little closer after scoring two runs in the bottom of the fifth (on a two-run Wally Post home run) to cut it to 11‚Äì5. Then Yankees finished the rout by added two more runs in the sixth on sacrifices by Lopez (on a squeeze play) and Daley (on a fly ball). This was the final World Series game ever played at Crosley Field, and the last postseason game in Cincinnati until the team moved to Riverfront Stadium in 1970 Houk became only the third skipper in history to win the World Series in his first season.

Each of the three games played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum drew record crowds, Game 5's attendance of 92,706 continues to be a World Series record to this day, and one which cannot feasibly be broken in any modern ballpark. It was the first pennant for the White Sox in 40 years (since the 1919 Black Sox Scandal). They would have to wait until their world championship season of to win another pennant. The Dodgers won their first pennant since moving from Brooklyn in 1958 by defeating the Milwaukee Braves, 2‚Äì0, in a best-of-three- games pennant playoff. It was the Dodgers' second World Series victory in five years, their first in Los Angeles, and marked the first championship for a West Coast team. It was the first World Series in which no pitcher for either side pitched a complete game. As Vin Scully remarked in his narration for the official World Series film, \\"What a change of scenery!\\" This was the only Fall Classic played during the period from 1949 through 1964 in which no games were played in New York City, breaking the streak of the city that documentary filmmaker Ken Burns later called the era's \\"Capital of Baseball\\". Route to the World Series=Dodgers After finishing seventh in 1958, the Dodgers rebounded in 1959. The National League pennant race was a season-long three- way battle between the Dodgers, the two-time defending N.L. champion Milwaukee Braves and the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers never led by more than two games (and that was at the end of a tie-breaker) and never trailed by more than five. On September 20, the Dodgers completed a three-game sweep in San Francisco so that, with five games to play, they had a game lead on the Braves and a one-game lead over the Giants. Going into the final day, the Dodgers and Braves were tied for first and the Giants were games back; the Giants needed to sweep a doubleheader from the Cardinals and have the Dodgers and Braves both lose to force a three-way tie. But the Dodgers won in Chicago 7‚Äì1 and the Braves won at home against the Phillies 5‚Äì2; this made the fact that the Giants lost both games of their doubleheader irrelevant. In Game 1 of the best-of-three playoff in Milwaukee, the Dodgers took a 3‚Äì2 lead in the top of the sixth inning. Dodger reliever Larry Sherry then retired 12 of the last 13 Braves hitters to secure the win. Games 2 and 3 (if necessary) were scheduled for Los Angeles. In Game 2, the Dodgers trailed 5-2 in the ninth inning, but rallied to tie the game with five singles and a sacrifice fly. In the top of the 11th, the Braves loaded the bases with two out, but Stan Williams got pinch hitter Joe Adcock to ground out to end the threat. In the bottom of the 12th, Gil Hodges drew a walk with two out and nobody on. Joe Pignatano singled Hodges to second. Carl Furillo hit a ground ball to shortstop F√©lix Mantilla; Mantilla's throw to first base was in the dirt and skipped past Frank Torre, allowing Hodges to score all the way from second with the pennant-clinching run. White Sox Manager Al Lopez Managed by Al L√≥pez, the White Sox were built on pitching, speed and defense. Nicknamed the \\"Go-go Sox\\", they were last in the A.L. in home runs but led the league in stolen bases, fielding percentage, and lowest team ERA. They battled the Cleveland Indians for the American League pennant, and after a close race, the White Sox built a game lead in early September. The Indians could get no closer than games, and when the White Sox beat Cleveland 4‚Äì2 on September 22, they clinched the pennant with three games to play. The White Sox were only the second team besides the Yankees to win the A.L. pennant between 1949 and 1964 inclusive; the other was the 1954 Indians, also managed by Al L√≥pez. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Ted Kluszewski Historic Comiskey Park hosted a crowd of 48,103 that included Hollywood's Joan Crawford and Orson Welles and 1956 presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson II in the first championship game in 40 years for the White Sox as well as the first postseason game in Chicago in 14 years. On the pitching mound, Early Wynn of the White Sox faced Roger Craig of the Dodgers. After scoring twice in the first inning on back-to-back RBI singles by Ted Kluszewski and Sherm Lollar after a walk and single, the Sox pounded across seven runs in the third. Nellie Fox doubled with one out and scored on Jim Landis's single before Kluszewski's two-run home run knocked Craig out of the game. Lollar reached second on an error off of Chuck Churn and scored on Billy Goodman's single. Then RBI doubles by Al Smith and Early Wynn and fielder's choice by Jim Rivera aided by two more errors made it 9‚Äì0 White Sox. Ted Kluszewski's second home run of the game off of Churn next inning capped the game's scoring as the Sox routed the Dodgers 11‚Äì0. This would be the last World Series game the White Sox ever won at Comiskey Park, and their last home postseason win until 2005. Game 2 Charlie Neal Game 2 featured Bob Shaw of the White Sox face Johnny Podres of the Dodgers. Once again, the Sox jumped out to a quick 2‚Äì0 lead in the first inning on Ted Kluszewski's RBI groundout with runners on first and third followed by Sherm Lollar's RBI single. In the fifth, Charlie Neal homered for the first Dodger run of the series. Chuck Essegian's two-out home run tied the game tied 2‚Äì2 in the seventh, then after a walk, Neal hit his second home run of the day to put the Dodgers ahead for the first time, 4‚Äì2. During a Sox uprising in the eighth against Larry Sherry, Al Smith doubled to left with two men on, cutting the lead to 4‚Äì3. However, Sherm Lollar was thrown out by a mile at the plate trying to score due to Wally Moon faking a catch that fooled Lollar. Sherry pitched a perfect ninth to notch a save and give the Dodgers the win. Game 3 Larry Sherry In contrast to the crowd of 36,528 for the tie-breaker playoff game at the Los Angeles Coliseum, 92,394 showed up for the first World Series game ever played on the West Coast. Dick Donovan faced off against the host team's Don Drysdale in Game 3\\\\. Six scoreless innings were thrown by the two, with Donovan giving up only one hit. However, Donovan would load the bases in the seventh inning on two walks and a single before being replaced by Gerry Staley. A single by Carl Furillo scored two runs. Drysdale allowed two singles and Larry Sherry hit a batter to load the bases with no outs in the eighth, but gave up just a run on Al Smith's double play. The Dodgers got that run back in the bottom half when Maury Wills hit a leadoff single off of Gerry Staley and scored on Charlie Neal's double. Sherry shut down the Sox in the ninth as the Dodgers won, 3‚Äì1 despite being outhit 12‚Äì5. The White Sox stranded 11 runners and were 0‚Äìfor‚Äì7 with them in scoring position. Game 4 Gil Hodges Early Wynn and Roger Craig faced off against each other once again before a crowd of 92,650. Wynn was knocked out by a four-run Dodger third inning. Wally Moon singled with two outs and scored on Norm Larker's single. Larker, who moved to second on an error, scored on Gil Hodges's single. Hodges moved to third on a Don Demeter single and scored on a passed ball, then John Roseboro's RBI single capped the inning's scoring. The Sox tied the game in the seventh on Ted Kluszewski's RBI single with two on followed by Sherm Lollar socking a three- run home run, but Gil Hodges blasted one over the fence in the next inning off of Gerry Staley to give the Dodgers a 5‚Äì4 lead, then Larry Sherry pitched a scoreless ninth to put the Dodgers a win away from the World Series championship. Game 5 Nellie Fox A record-breaking crowd of 92,706 turned out, a majority hoping to celebrate a Los Angeles championship. For the first time in World Series history, however, three pitchers combined for a shutout, as Bob Shaw, Billy Pierce and Dick Donovan quieted the Dodgers and their fans 1‚Äì0 in Game 5, sending the series back to Chicago. The game's only run scored in the fourth off starter Sandy Koufax, coming when Nellie Fox scored as Lollar grounded into a double play. To date, this remains the largest crowd in World Series history. Game 6 Wally Moon The victory in Game 5 gave the Sox hope, heading back home to a \\"real ballpark,\\" as opposed to L.A.'s converted football stadium. But the change in scenery was no help. Early Wynn started with only two days rest, and after surrendering two runs in the third inning on Duke Snider's home run after a walk, the Dodgers broke open the game with six more in the fourth. Norm Larker hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Maury Wills's single. Wills scored on Johnny Podres's double to knock Wynn out of the game. Dick Donovan walked Jim Gilliam before allowing a two-run double to Charlie Neal and two-run home run to Wally Moon to make it 8‚Äì0 Dodgers. Starter Podres was also knocked out in the fourth by Chicago's last gasp, another towering three-run home run by the hottest Sox hitter, Ted Kluszewski, after a walk and hit-by-pitch. In the ninth inning, Chuck Essegian set a World Series record with his second pinch- hit home run of the Series off of Ray Moore, and the Dodgers captured their first championship as a Los Angeles team. Relief pitcher Larry Sherry (who earned the win in relief, finished with a 2‚Äì0 record on two saves and allowed one run in 12 innings) was voted Most Valuable Player of the Series. Composite line score 1959 World Series (4‚Äì2): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over Chicago White Sox (A.L.) Records and unique characteristics World Series action at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum The Dodgers found an unlikely hero when Chuck Essegian, who hit only one home run in 1959 and had only six in his career to that point, set a World Series record with two pinch-hit home runs. Due to the best-of-three N.L. playoff, Game 1 was deferred from Wednesday, September 30, to Thursday, October 1. The normal travel days were retained between Games 2 and 3, and Games 5 and 6, resulting in the rare event of a Series with no Saturday game scheduled. Games 3, 4 and 5 were: *The first World Series games ever played on the West Coast; *The first and only played in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; *The only games in World Series history to exceed 90,000 in attendance: Game 5 drew 92,706 fans (a major league record unlikely to be broken under current arrangements, as no current MLB stadium has a capacity of even 60,000 ‚Äì Dodger Stadium currently has the largest capacity in MLB with 56,000) This was the first World Series to draw more than 400,000 fans. Larry Sherry of the Dodgers was the fifth consecutive pitcher to win the World Series Most Valuable Player Award (in only the fifth year it was awarded), following Johnny Podres (Brooklyn, 1955), Don Larsen (New York, 1956), Lew Burdette (Milwaukee, 1957), and Bob Turley (New York, 1958). Sherry, who had been born with club feet, finished all four games the Dodgers won, winning two and saving two. His brother Norm was the Dodgers' backup catcher. Although he was not voted MVP, Dodger second baseman Charlie Neal batted .370 for the Series, and his two-homer performance in Game 2 came after Chicago's pitching had held L.A. scoreless for 13 consecutive innings. Ted Kluszewski played for the losing \\"Pale Hose\\" but still managed to drive in a World Series record-tying ten runs, joining Yogi Berra, who drove in ten in the 1956 World Series. \\"Big Klu\\" did so in just six games, and his 10 RBIs in the 1959 World Series remain a record for a 6-game World Series, as Berra's 10 RBIs in 1956 came in a 7-game World Series. (However, Bobby Richardson would break the record for RBIs in a World Series, regardless of length, the next year with 12 against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960 World Series.) The Dodgers became the second National League team to win a World Series after relocating (the 1957 Milwaukee Braves being the first). The Dodgers became the first team to go from 7th place in one season to World Champion the next. The 1959 World Series was the last one for Comiskey Park, and the only one for Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The White Sox would move into Guaranteed Rate Field, originally \\"New Comiskey\\", in 1991; the Dodgers would move into Dodger Stadium in 1962. This was the most recent World Series to host the final World Series games of both its host venues, a \\"distinction\\" it lost to the 2003 World Series after the original Yankee Stadium closed following the 2008 Major League Baseball season and the Florida Marlins moved out of Sun Life Stadium after the 2011 season.

The New York Yankees defeated the defending champion Milwaukee Braves in seven games for their 18th title, and their seventh in 10 years. With that victory, the Yankees became only the second team in Major League Baseball history to come back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit to win a best-of-seven World Series; the first was the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1925. (The 1903 Boston Red Sox came back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit in a best-of-nine affair.) These teams would meet again in the fall classic 38 years later‚Äîby that time, the Braves had moved to Atlanta. As of 2019, this is the most recent World Series featuring the two previous Series winning teams. Background This was the first year New Yorkers had only one local team to root for; both the Giants and the Dodgers were now playing their home games more than away (in San Francisco and Los Angeles respectively). Both returnees to the Series had no problems repeating as league champions during the regular season. Milwaukee coasted to an eight-game lead over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League and the Yanks bested the Chicago White Sox by ten games in the American. With no pennant race in either league, managers Casey Stengel of the Yankees and Fred Haney of the Braves could rest their aces in preparation for an exciting repeat of the 1957 World Series. The 1958 World Series was also the first World Series filmed in color. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Bill Bruton Casey Stengel called on 14-game winner Whitey Ford (14‚Äì7, 2.01) to start Game 1. Although teammate Bob Turley had a better regular season record at 21‚Äì7, the experienced, perennial winning southpaw Ford had five post-season victories under his belt. Fred Haney countered with a lefty of his own, 22-game winner Warren Spahn. Bill Skowron started the scoring with a home run in the top of the fourth inning, but the Braves came storming back with two of their own in the bottom of the frame. Hank Aaron walked and quickly took second on a Yogi Berra passed ball. When Joe Adcock grounded out to third, Aaron held second but advanced to third on Wes Covington's groundout. Then came three straight singles, Del Crandall to left scoring Aaron, Andy Pafko to center, and Warren Spahn to left-center scoring Crandall, to put the Braves up by one. In the top of the fifth, Spahn retired Tony Kubek on a flyout to left but walked the opposing pitcher, Ford. Leadoff hitter Hank Bauer then deposited a Spahn fastball into the left-field bleachers to give the Yankees a 3‚Äì2 lead. Milwaukee would tie the game in the eighth on an Eddie Mathews walk, Aaron double and sac-fly by Wes Covington on a deep fly-out to Mickey Mantle in left-center. With no runs in the ninth, extra-innings were played, the Yankees going down 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 with Spahn still on the hill for the Braves. Ryne Duren, who came into the game to pitch the eighth inning, took his turn at-bat in the 10th and grounded out to the pitcher. Aaron started the bottom of the 10th by striking out and was barely thrown out at first base by Yogi Berra on a dropped third strike. Adcock followed with a clean single to center but Covington made the second out on a fly-out to left. Crandall then singled up the middle, sending Adcock to second base. Bill Bruton, who came into the game pinch-hitting for Pafko in the ninth, lined a single into right-center, scoring Adcock with the game-winning run. Game 2 Lew Burdette Lew Burdette (20‚Äì10, 2.91), who won three games in the 1957 World Series, took the mound for the Braves while the Yankees went with righty Bob Turley (21‚Äì7, 2.91), who won 20 games for the only time in his career during the regular season. Burdette started shakily, giving up a leadoff single to Hank Bauer. Eddie Mathews fielded a grounder by Gil McDougald but threw wide to the first, putting runners on second and third. Mickey Mantle was intentionally walked, loading the bases for cleanup hitter Elston Howard. Howard's groundout forced Mantle at second while Bauer came in from third with the game's first run. Burdette got the next batter, Yogi Berra, to ground into an inning ending 4‚Äì6‚Äì3 double-play; Red Schoendienst, to Johnny Logan, to Frank Torre. A shakier Bob Turley would last only a third of an inning. The Braves lit up the scoreboard with seven first inning runs, sparked by a leadoff Bill Bruton home run; he had hit just three in the season. Schoendienst doubled to right, Hank Aaron walked and dependable Wes Covington singled home a run to right-center. Mid-season pickup Duke Maas relieved Turley to get Frank Torre to fly to right for the second out. Del Crandall walked, loading the bases, with Johnny Logan keeping up the onslaught with a two-run single. With the score already 4‚Äì1, pitcher Burdette helped his own cause with a three-run homer that left-fielder Howard thought he had a bead on, only to crash into the fence. Burdette was just the sixth pitcher (to date) with a World Series home run. Norm Siebern was summoned to take over for Howard and Johnny Kucks came in to pitch to try to stop the bleeding. The tenth batter of the inning, Bruton, lined to short but the damage was done as the Braves were staked to a 7‚Äì1 lead. Milwaukee added to its lead in the second inning on another Covington single, this time scoring Eddie Mathews. Things would quiet down a little; Mickey Mantle's shot over the center-field fence in the fourth was the only other scoring until the seventh, when the Braves would score twice more and then thrice more in the eighth. The Yankees found some life in the top of the ninth, scoring three runs off a tiring Burdette. Hank Bauer led off with a home run, followed by a Gil McDougald single to left and then Mantle's second homer of the game, into the left- center field bleachers made it 13‚Äì5. Burdette showed some tenacity by retiring Berra, Bill Skowron, and Bobby Richardson, in order, for the win and a 2‚Äì0 series lead. Game 3 Hank Bauer Arriving at the Bronx for Games 3 through 5, the Yankees found themselves at home in hopes of their first win in this Series. Milwaukee was shut down on a finely pitched game by Don Larsen with a little help from reliever Ryne Duren. The Yankees needed this win to stay within striking distance of the seemingly run-away Braves. Hank Bauer drove in all the Yankees' runs, going 3‚Äìfor‚Äì4 with four runs batted in and scoring once. Bauer singled in Norm Siebern and Gil McDougald in the fifth, to extend his Series hitting streak to 17 games, and then in the seventh hit a two-run homer into the left-field stands. Larsen went seven innings on a six-hitter, striking out eight with three walks. Duren closed the game for his first save, pitching two scoreless innings with three walks and a strikeout. Bob Rush pitched well for the Braves, but his loss helped the Yanks get back into the Series. Game 4 Warren Spahn Warren Spahn was at his much-needed best, winning Game 4 3‚Äì0 on a two-hit shutout over Yankee ace Whitey Ford. New York left-fielder Norm Siebern (playing for the injured Elston Howard), had trouble fielding with the afternoon sun blazing, losing fly balls in the sixth and eighth innings, accounting for two Milwaukee runs. It was a much-heralded pitching duel until the top of the sixth when Red Schoendienst led off tripling into deep left-center, the ball slicing between \\"The Mick\\" in center and Siebern in left. Tony Kubek, who had 28 errors during the season, let a Johnny Logan grounder slip through his legs for an error, letting in the game's first run. In the seventh, Spahn blooped a single to score Andy Pafko, who had just doubled to right. In the eighth, Logan was credited with a ground-rule double when Siebern lost a fly-ball in the sun. Eddie Mathews followed with another double, scoring Logan with the game's final run. Up three games to one, the Milwaukee Braves were on the cusp of back-to-back championships, but the indomitable New Yorkers would show that they had some fight left in them. Game 5 Yogi Berra, Hank Bauer, and Mickey Mantle Game 2 starters, loser Bob Turley and winner Lew Burdette, returned with quite different results. Good-luck charm Elston Howard also returned to take his rightful spot in left-field for ineffective Norm Siebern. The game did not start out very promising for the Yankees as the first six batters were retired without much fanfare. The Braves didn't fare much better as a walk and a single by Schoendienst in the third was all they could muster. Second baseman Gil McDougald would open up the scoring in the bottom of the third with a home run into the screen next to the left-field foul pole. Turley kept cruising retiring the side in order in the fourth and fifth until his Yankee teammates opened the floodgates with a six-run sixth. Burdette could only get one out in the inning giving up five earned runs before being relieved by Juan Pizarro. Hank Bauer would lead off with a single to left. After Jerry Lumpe struck out bunting a third strike foul, Mickey Mantle singled to left-center advancing Bauer to third. Yogi Berra doubled into the right-field corner scoring Bauer, Mantle stopping at third. Howard was intentionally passed loading the bases but Moose Skowron kept the rally going with a short single to right scoring just Mantle. Pizzaro relieved Burdette, who was responsible for all baserunners, and was greeted with a two-run scoring double into the Milwaukee bullpen by Gil McDougald. With runners on second and third, Tony Kubek struck out but had to be thrown out by Del Crandall at first. Turley stayed in the game to hit and delivered a single to left scoring the sixth run, Skowron, and the seventh, McDougald. Hank Bauer was the third strikeout victim in the inning but six runs had crossed the plate. The Braves would put runners on in the seventh, eighth, and ninth innings but fail to score, giving the Yanks a 7‚Äì0 victory. Milwaukee still led 3‚Äì2 in the Series. Game 6 Gil McDougald This is where the series began to turn in earnest. Milwaukee needed a split of two games at home to repeat as champions, but manager Fred Haney acted liked his team had its back to the wall. Rather than start Spahn on three days' rest per his normal routine, the 37-year-old warhorse returned one day early. That also meant that Burdette would do the same if the series went to a seventh game. In the process, Haney bypassed veteran Bob Rush, who had an impressive 4-2 record and 1.81 earned run average in the final two months of the regular season and was effective again in Game 3 albeit in a loss. By now, it was obvious that the manager had little faith in any pitcher other than Spahn and Burdette on the staff. In the top of the first, Spahn recorded two quick outs. Hank Bauer, who would be the Series' top hitter with a .323 batting average, four homers and eight RBIs, stepped to the plate and slammed his fourth homer into the left-field bleachers for an early 1‚Äì0 lead. The Braves answered with a run in the bottom of the inning on a Red Schoendienst single, a sacrifice bunt by Johnny Logan, and a run-scoring single to left by Hank Aaron. Spahn settled in and retired the Yankees without a hit in the second. Also pitching on two days' rest, Ford quickly withered in the bottom of the second. After striking out Del Crandall, Wes Covington singled to center on a trap by center fielder Mickey Mantle. Andy Pafko singled to right, advancing Covington to third. Spahn singled to right-center. scoring Covington for a 2‚Äì1 lead. An exhausted Ford walked Schoendienst, loading the bases, and Casey Stengel had seen enough, motioning to the bullpen for reliever Art Ditmar. Ditmar faced one batter, Logan, who flied out to Elston Howard, who in turn threw home with a perfect throw to Yogi Berra, doubling up Pafko trying to score on a sac-fly. The RBI single by Spahn would be the last run scored against Ford in the World Series for 33‚Öî innings. Milwaukee held on to the lead until the top of the sixth inning when the Yankees tied the score on a defensive replacement miscue. Bill Bruton had entered the game to play center for Pafko. After Mantle singled just over the reach of shortstop Logan's glove, Howard followed with single to center. Bruton fumbled the ball, allowing Mantle to reach third on the error. Berra hit a sacrifice fly to center, Mantle scoring after the catch, to tie the game at two. Spahn was still on the mound for the Braves going into the 10th, despite throwing 290 innings in the regular season and another 28 in the post-season to that point. Gil McDougald, who was having a fine series himself, led off by hitting a Spahn fastball over the left-field fence. Bauer almost went back-to-back but Bruton made the catch in deep center. Mantle grounded to second for the second out but Howard and Berra followed with singles, setting up runners on first and third. Haney called on Don McMahon to replace Spahn. Moose Skowron struck a single to right, scoring Howard for a two-run lead. Pitcher Ryne Duren stayed in the game to hit but struck out to end the inning. The Braves made some noise in the bottom of the 10th, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Yankee lead. Logan, on first after a walk and with two outs, went to second on defensive indifference (not a stolen base). The ever-dependable Aaron singled to left, scoring Logan, and the Braves were within one run of tying the game. Joe Adcock then singled, sending Aaron to third. Bob Turley came in to relieve Duren and Felix Mantilla pinch-ran for Adcock. With two on and two outs, Frank Torre, pinch-hitting for Del Crandall, lined out to McDougald at the very edge of the outfield grass to end the game and Milwaukee's chance to win the Series here. Game 7 Bob Turley For the fourth straight year, the World Series went the distance. Yankee manager Casey Stengel again chose Don Larsen to start Game 7. Larsen had only lasted 2‚Öì innings starting Game 7 in the 1957 World Series and once again lasted 2‚Öì innings in 1958. Braves right-hander Lew Burdette, who pitched a complete game win in Game 2 but gave up six runs in a Game 5 loss, started for the third time in the series. The Yankees failed to score in the first while the Braves tallied a single run on some lack of control by Larsen. Red Schoendienst led off with a single to left, Bill Bruton walked and Frank Torre sacrificed up both runners, Jerry Lumpe to Gil McDougald, who was covering first base. Hank Aaron walked loading the bases; things looking pretty good for the Braves thus far. Wes Covington grounded out to first but Schoendienst scored on the play. Eddie Mathews took an intentional pass but Del Crandall struck out ending the threat. The Yankees struck back. Cleanup hitter Yogi Berra led off with a walk. Slow-footed but hustling Elston Howard laid down a sacrifice and, incredibly, was called safe on a poorly tossed throw by Torre to pitcher Burdette. Jerry Lumpe grounded again to Torre, who again threw too high to Burdette for another error, loading the bases. The left-handed hitting Torre got the start in place of veteran right-hander Joe Adcock, who may have been more sure-handed in the field. The next batter, Bill Skowron, forced Lumpe at second, scoring Berra and moving Howard to third. Tony Kubek lifted a sacrifice fly to left, scoring Howard giving the Yankees a 2‚Äì1 lead, which would hold up until the sixth. Two singles in the bottom of the third brought Stengel out to replace Larsen with a short-rested Bob Turley. The stocky right-hander escaped a bases-loaded situation and pitched superb ball the rest of the way. As in Game 6, the score was tied at two after six innings, when Del Crandall homered into the left-field stands with two outs, giving Braves fans a reason to cheer and promise of another title. But that hope would fade as the Yankees came to bat in the top of the eighth inning. With tiring Lew Burdette looking for another complete-game victory, they started an improbable two-out rally. After a McDougald fly out and Mickey Mantle looking at a called strike three, Berra doubled off the wall in the right-field corner. Howard followed with a run-scoring bouncer to center field. Andy Carey singled off Eddie Mathews' glove before Bill Skowron then delivered the crushing blow, a three-run homer to left-center field, to cap a storybook comeback. Milwaukee threatened in the ninth but fell short, giving the Yankees their 18th World Championship. Hank Bauer (a nine-Series veteran) led with most runs scored (six), most hits (ten), most home runs (four) and most runs batted in (eight). He also paced the victors with a .323 average. Despite less-than-stellar stats in his first four Classics (7‚Äìfor‚Äì57 with a .123 avg.), he combined for 18 hits, six home runs, 14 RBI and a .290 average against the Braves in 1957 and 1958. Even so, Turley became the first relief pitcher to be named World Series MVP, going 2‚Äì1 with a save.

This series was a best-of-nine series, like the first World Series in 1903 and the World Series of 1919 and 1921. The only World Series triple play, the first World Series grand slam and the first World Series home run by a pitcher all occurred in Game 5 of this Series. The Indians won the series in memory of their former shortstop Ray Chapman, who had been killed earlier in the season when struck in the head by a pitched ball. The triple play was unassisted and turned by Cleveland's Bill Wambsganss in Game 5\\\\. Wambsganss, playing second base, caught a line drive off the bat of Clarence Mitchell, stepped on second base to put out Pete Kilduff, and tagged Otto Miller coming from first base. It was the second of 15 (as of 2016) unassisted triple plays in major-league baseball history, and it remains the only one in postseason play. Mitchell made history again in the eighth inning by hitting into a double play, accounting for five outs in two straight at-bats. The fifth game also saw the first grand slam in World Series history (hit by Cleveland's Elmer Smith) and the first Series home run by a pitcher (Cleveland's Jim Bagby, Sr.). And in that same game, Brooklyn outhit Cleveland but lost 8‚Äì1. Cleveland had won the American League pennant in a close race with the Chicago White Sox and the New York Yankees. The Sox's participation in the Black Sox Scandal the previous year had caught up to them late in the season, and their star players were suspended with three games left in the season, when they were in a virtual tie with the Indians. The Yankees, with their recently acquired star Babe Ruth, were almost ready to start their eventual World Series dynasty. For Cleveland, it would prove to be one of their few successes in a long history of largely either poor or not- quite-good enough clubs. It is notable that all seven games of the 1920 World Series were won by the team who scored first. In fact, Game 4 was the only game in which the losing team scored a run before the winning team had scored all of its runs. The lead never changed hands in any game. This would be the last World Series until to feature two franchises that had not previously won a championship. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Game 1 at Ebbets Field Game 1 took a mere 1 hour, 41 minutes. Steve O'Neill supplied RBI doubles in the second and fourth innings in support of Stan Coveleski, who won it for the visiting Indians with a five-hitter. Game 2 A first-inning run on a Jimmy Johnston single and Zack Wheat double would be all Dodger pitcher Burleigh Grimes would require in a complete-game shutout. Game 3 Brooklyn scored twice in the first on hits by Zack Wheat and Hi Myers that chased Cleveland starter Ray Caldwell from the game. The only run winning pitcher Sherry Smith gave up in a three-hitter came when Tris Speaker came all the way around on a double that was misplayed in left field. Game 4 Brooklyn starter Leon Cadore didn't make it past the first inning. His relievers didn't fare much better, Al Mamaux being removed in the third and Rube Marquard greeted by a George Burns two-run double. Stan Coveleski cruised with a five-hitter for his second win of the Series. Game 5 The Cleveland Times ran the following article on Monday, October 11, 1920, recounting Game 5 and Wambsganss' triple play: Bill Wambsganss (upper left) completing his unassisted triple play in Game 5, about to tag a stunned Otto Miller after touching second to double up Pete Kilduff (right foreground, touching third). Wamby Makes Unassisted Triple Play *CLEVELAND, Sunday Oct 10, 1920 ‚Äì Bill Wambsganss' unassisted triple play highlighted the most unusual game in World Series history today and helped the Cleveland Indians to a wild 8‚Äì1 victory over the Brooklyn Robins. Elmer Smith hit a grand slam and Jim Bagby also homered as the Indians took the lead in games three to two. The triple play and grand slam had never happened before in World Series history and Bagby became the first pitcher to homer in a World Series. \\"I've been in baseball 40 years\\", Robins manager Wilbert Robinson said, \\"and I never saw one like this.\\" The first Indian to face Burleigh Grimes was Charlie Johnson, who singled. He stopped at second on Wambsganss' single. Then Grimes fell fielding Tris Speaker's bunt, loading the bases. Then Smith hit a 1‚Äì2 pitch over the right field screen for a 4‚Äì0 lead. In the home fourth, Doc Johnston singled to center and moved up on a passed ball. After Grimes put Steve O'Neill on, Bagby homered into the center field stands. Pete Kilduff began the top of the fifth with a single to left center. When Otto Miller singled to center, Speaker's quick throw to third drove Kilduff back to second. That brought up reliever Clarence Mitchell, who went six for sixteen as a pinch-hitter this season and sometimes fills in at first base and in the outfield. A left-handed hitter, he drove the ball toward right center. Second baseman Wambsganss moved slightly to his right, tipped onto his toes, sprung a little bit and grabbed the ball with his gloved hand. Never hesitating, he continued to second base, easily doubling Kilduff. Then when Wamby turned to throw to first base he saw Miller frozen directly in front of him. Reaching out, Wamby tagged Miller easily. The crowd was silent momentarily, then, realizing what had happened, broke into thunderous applause. In the Brooklyn eighth, Ernie Krueger singled to center. But Mitchell grounded to first baseman Johnson, who started a double play. Thus, Mitchell accounted for five outs in two at-bats. Game 6 Even faster than Game 1, this one was done in just 94 minutes. Duster Mails twirled a three-hit shutout, and the lone run came in the sixth on a Tris Speaker two- out single, followed by a George Burns double. Game 7 The Dodgers didn't score in the last two games. Their pitcher, Burleigh Grimes, committed an error on a Cleveland double steal that resulted in the game's first run. Stan Coveleski needed no more, but got one in the fifth from a Tris Speaker run- scoring triple and another in the seventh on Charlie Jamieson's RBI double. Spitball pitcher Coveleski won for the third time and the Indians celebrated before their home fans.

This was the first World Series appearance by the Yankees, who have gone on to play in the Series a record 40 times. The 1921 Series was a closely contested matchup that ended on a double play featuring a baserunning miscue. It was the last World Series to use best-of-nine, which had been used starting 1919 (and was also used in 1903).  Background  The Series was the last of the experimental best-five-of-nine series, which the Giants won five games to three. All eight games were played at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan, New York, each team alternating as the nominal \\"home team\\" since the Yankees had subleased the stadium from the Giants for the 1913 through 1922 seasons, so that it was the home park for both teams during the regular season in those ten years. This marked the first time in World Series history that the series occurred at a single site. It happened again the following year in the same place with the same two teams, and in 1944 at St. Louis' Sportsman's Park between the Cardinals and the Browns. For New Yorkers, this was the first subway Series in World Series history. It was also the first World Series to be broadcast on radio, with Grantland Rice covering the games live through Pittsburgh's KDKA. It was rebroadcast on WBZ in Massachusetts. Announcer Tommy Cowan also recreated the games over Westinghouse-owned WJZ in Newark as he listened to phoned-in reports from the stadium. Because of an infected arm and a bad knee (which he wrenched in Game 5), Babe Ruth did not start the final three games,Associated Press. \\"Babe Ruth Is Just Spectator at World Series\\". The Santa Barbara Morning Press. October 11, 1921. Retrieved June 18, 2018. appearing only as a pinch-hitter in the final inning of Game 8\\\\. Following the Series, Ruth and Bob Meusel did some postseason barnstorming, against the rules for Series participants at that time. Both were suspended for a number of games at the start of the 1922 season. Ruth filed a personal appeal with Commissioner Landis, who upheld their suspensions but agreed to rescind the rule effective the end of that season. Then New York Governor Nathan L. Miller, described as \\"a big baseball fan\\" by The New York Times, made plans to attend games as a guest of the National Commission (the Commissioner of Baseball). The Series drew fans to New York City from across the continent, from as far west as California and Mexico to as far south as Cuba. Hotels were booked up, and both the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads made plans to add cars and run their trains in sections if necessary to handle the extra traffic expected. Harry L. Davis, then the Governor of Ohio, was expected to attend the games as were several other VIPs of the time. This was the fourth World Series for Giants' assistant coach \\"Eee-yah!\\" Hughie Jennings, who had managed young Ty Cobb and the pennant-winning but Series-losing 1907, 1908 & 1909 Detroit Tigers and had been brought in as an assistant coach for the Giants by John McGraw the previous October after Jennings had resigned from the Tigers. The two were teammates on the old Baltimore Orioles in earlier seasons. Several players on both teams didn't start the 1921 season with either the Giants or the Yankees, and several others moved to other teams during the regular season earlier that year. For the Giants, Johnny Rawlings, Irish Meusel, Casey Stengel and Red Causey started the season as Philadelphia Phillies, who finished last in the National League that year. Outfielder Bill Cunningham had played for the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, nor did Cozy Dolan or Red Shea start the season with the Giants, while the Yankees acquired outfielder Elmer Miller and pitcher Tom Rogers during the season. Nonparticipants from either team in the Series included Curt Walker, Lee King, Johnny Monroe, Rube Benton, Goldie Rapp, Ping Bodie, Tom Sheehan and Tom Connolly. Summary right Matchups The Polo Grounds during Game 1 of the series. Game 1 Mays pitched a complete game 5-hit shutout, Frankie Frisch getting 4 of those hits off of Mays in a losing cause for the Giants. This was the first World Series game victory for the Yankees. Game 2 Pitching Ruth carefully, the Giants walked the Babe three times; but after the third walk he stole second and then third base, much to the delight of Yankee fans. But when he slid into third, he scraped his elbow severely and the site became infected. Hoyt held the Giants to two hits, the Yankees jumping to a 2-0 lead in the series. Game 3 After getting outscored 6‚Äì0 in the first two games of this series and falling behind 4‚Äì0 in the top of the third, the Giants tied it with four runs of their own in the bottom half. Later on, an 8 run 7th inning highlighted by Ross Youngs' bases loaded triple turned the tide as the Giants got their first win of this series. Ruth was taken out in the eighth after again scraping his elbow sliding into a base. The Yankees announced after the game that the elbow would have to be lanced and that he would not return for the rest of the Series. Game 4 Ruth suited up, but stayed on the bench during batting practice. When the game began, however, to everyone's surprise, he popped out of the dugout and jogged to his outfield position. The crowd roared. He kept touching his bandaged arm throughout the game. Despite the injury, he got two hits including a ninth-inning homer, his first World Series home run as well as the first World Series home run in Yankees franchise history. But the Giants won the game and tied the series at 2‚Äì2. Game 5 Ruth's arm was still bandaged, but he played again. In the fourth, with the score tied 1‚Äì1, he shocked everyone by bunting and beating it out. His teammate Meusel then doubled, scoring Ruth all the way from first base for the go-ahead run in a 3‚Äì1 Yankee win. Game 6 The Giants battled back from 3‚Äì0 and 5‚Äì3 deficits to take Game 6. Game 7 Phil Douglas scattered eight hits and held the Yankees to one run, the Giants winning 2-1 on Frank Snyder's RBI double in the seventh inning. Game 8 Facing elimination, Yankee manager Miller Huggins sent Ruth out to pinch-hit in the bottom of the ninth. The Babe, nursing both elbow and knee injuries, had sat out this game and missed all of Games 6 and 7. The bases were empty and the Yankees still trailed by the lone run of the game scored by the Giants in the top of the first. A HR would tie the game, and a hit or a walk would give the Yankees a chance. But Ruth grounded out, and shortly afterwards Frank Baker hit into a double play after a walk by Aaron Ward who was thrown out at third base for the final out of the Series, giving the Giants their first world championship since Christy Mathewson's record three complete shutouts in 1905.

By now, the term \\"World Series\\" was being used frequently, as opposed to \\"World's Series\\". As with the 1921 World Series, every game was played at the Polo Grounds because it housed both teams, with the home team alternating; it was also the Yankees' final season at the Polo Grounds, as they would move into the then-under construction Yankee Stadium for the 1923 season, which ended in them winning the rematch. The Giants pitched around Babe Ruth and scored just enough runs to win each of the games outside the controversial Game 2 tie. That game was called on account of darkness, but many thought there was sufficient light to have played some more innings (the sun was still in the sky), and there were some suspicions that one or both teams might have \\"allowed\\" the tie to happen to increase the overall gate receipts. Commissioner Landis was among those who was dissatisfied with the result. One story is that Landis asked Umpire Hildebrand, \\"Why the Sam Hill did you call the game?\\" The umpire answered, \\"There was a temporary haze on the field.\\" The game decision was in the hands of the umpires, but the Commissioner's Office controlled the gate receipts. Landis ordered the money, more than $120,000, turned over to World War I charities, thus nullifying any impropriety. The tied game would turn out to be the third (and final) tied game in the history of the World Series. The other two tied games occurred in and . No ties are possible under later rules, which allow for suspension of a tied game and resumption of it at a later date, as with Game 5 of the 2008 World Series. This would prove to be Giants' manager John McGraw's third and final World Series win. Summary A program from the 1922 World Series. Matchups=Game 1 Dugan scores the first run. The game and Series remained scoreless until the sixth inning. Whitey Witt tripled off of Art Nehf, then was cut down at home trying to score on a fielder's choice, but a Babe Ruth hit got the run home. The Yankees added another run next inning on Aaron Ward's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. A three-run Giant rally in the eighth knocked out Yankee starter Bullet Joe Bush, who allowed four straight leadoff singles, the last of which to Irish Meusel scoring two. and the winning run coming off reliever Waite Hoyt on a Ross Youngs sacrifice fly. Game 2 This was the controversial tie (see above). Pitchers Bob Shawkey and Jesse Barnes went all 10 innings. The Giants scored all three runs in the first on Irish Meusel's three-run home run after two singles. The Yankees scored a run in the first on Wally Pipp's RBI single after Joe Dugan reached second on an error and another run in the fourth on Aaron Ward's home run. The Yankees had tied the game in the eighth on doubles by Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel, but that is the way the game ended. Game 3 Knuckleballer Jack Scott kept the Yankees off the board. In the bottom of the third with runners on second and third, Frankie Frisch's sacrifice fly and Irish Meusel's RBI single scored a run each for the Giants, who added an insurance run in the seventh on Frankie Frisch's RBI single. The game took just 1 hour, 48 minutes. Game 4 This contest moved along even faster than Game 3. It was over in a snappy 1:41, with Giants pitcher Hugh McQuillan going the distance for a 4-3 win. The Yankees scored two runs in the first on back-to-back singles by Wally Pipp and Bob Meusel, but in the fifth after a leadoff single and double, Dave Bancroft's two-run single tied the game. After a single and groundout, Irish Meusel's groundout and Ross Youngs's RBI single scored a run each. Aaron Ward's home run in the seventh cut the Giants' lead to one, but the Yankees did not score after that. Game 5 Art Nehf's five-hit pitching combined with a three-run eighth inning won the Series for the Giants. The Yankees scored a run in the first when Joe Dugan singled with one out, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Wally Pipp's RBI single, but in the bottom of the second with runners on second and third, Bill Cunningham's two-run single gave the Giants the lead. The Yankees tied the game in the fifth on Bullet Joe Bush's RBI single after a walk and single, then took the lead on Everett Scott's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. The decisive rally began with a Heinie Groh single and Frankie Frisch double. After an intentional walk to Ross Youngs, a two-run single by High Pockets Kelly put the Giants on top. The next batter, Lee King, inserted in the outfield that inning for defensive purposes, delivered an RBI single to make it 5-3, and that's how it ended. This is the last World Series the Giants won at home. Their championships of 1933 and 1954 (for New York) and 2010, 2012 and 2014 (for San Francisco) all came as the visiting team.

This would be the first of the Yankees' 27 World Series championships (as of 2019). The series was not played in a 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 format: as with the previous two Series (where both clubs had shared the Polo Grounds) the home field alternated each game, though this time it involved switching ballparks, as the first Yankee Stadium had opened this season.  Background  The Yankees opened their new stadium in April on a home run by Babe Ruth, setting the tone for the season and this Series, in which Ruth hit three home runs along with drawing eight walks. In Game 2, second baseman, Aaron Ward hit a home run. The Giants' one bright spot was \\"Old Casey\\" Stengel, who hit game- winning homers in each of the two Giants' victories. In typically eccentric Stengel fashion, one of them was inside-the-park at the cavernous Yankee Stadium, and his shoe came loose during his run around the bases. Stengel was traded after the season, leading him to quip later in life, \\"It's a good thing I didn't hit three homers in three games, or McGraw would have traded me to the Three-I League!\\". A quarter century later, Stengel would take on the role of Yankees manager, and would guide the Bronx Bombers through one of their most successful eras. In Game 6, The Yankees overcame the 4‚Äì1 deficit by staging a five-run rally in the eighth inning to clinch the series. The three consecutive matchups between the Yankees and Giants (1921‚Äì1923) marked the only time (as of 2020, that three straight World Series featured the same two clubs. Thanks to the large seating capacity of the new Yankee Stadium, coupled with expansion of the Polo Grounds the same year, the 1923 Series was the first to eclipse 300,000 in total attendance (301,430), averaging over 50,000 per game (50,238), with gate receipts over $1 million ($1,063,815.00). This was the third time that a team had inaugurated a new stadium with a World Series win, and would be the last until the St. Louis Cardinals victory in their new ballpark in , and the New York Yankees again won the World Series in in their new Yankee Stadium. Babe Ruth had a great series, his first great one as a Yankee, batting .368 and hitting three home runs in the series. Neither Lou Gehrig, Bill Terry nor Hack Wilson played in the Series. These future Hall of Famers were each in their first season and had played no more than thirteen games in the regular season. Gehrig had been called up from Hartford to play for the Yankees that year. In that time, however, a team had to have the permission of both the commissioner and the opposing team's manager to make a roster change so late in the season eligible for postseason play. The Yankees gained the permission of Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis who then told them to get John McGraw's permission. McGraw and the Yankees had a long history of disdain after both teams had shared a stadium and the Giants had won both the 1921 and 1922 World Series from New York. Therefore, he declined permission and Gehrig would not be allowed to participate in the series which otherwise would have been his first World Series. As noted baseball historian John Thorn said, \\"As if the Yankees needed any more reason to hate John McGraw.\\"John Thorn interview, Yankeeography, Lou Gehrig, 2004. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Fans entering Yankee Stadium before Game 1 of the World Series. A ninth-inning inside-the-park homer by Casey Stengel beat the Yankees on their home field. Babe Ruth scored in the first inning on a Bob Meusel double. Yankee center fielder Whitey Witt's two-run single in the next inning made it 3-0. The Giants fought back with a four-run third, knocking out Yankee starter Waite Hoyt from the game. It was tied at 4-4 in the ninth until Casey came to bat, legging out a long drive to the left-center gap. Game 2 Yankee Stadium was visible from the Polo Grounds in 1923, seen here above the outfield bleachers. After trading home runs by Aaron Ward and Irish Meusel, a pair of Babe Ruth blasts in the fourth and fifth innings turned out to be the difference. Game 3 A scoreless pitching duel lasted until the seventh inning, when Casey Stengel struck again, this time with a homer that left the park. It gave Art Nehf the win over Sad Sam Jones, despite the Giants getting just four hits. Game 4 A six-run second inning chased Giant starter Jack Scott, the first four Yankee batters of that inning reaching safely. Bob Meusel added a two-run triple. A ninth-inning leadoff inside-the- park homer by Ross Youngs gave the home team a flicker of hope, but Herb Pennock mopped up in relief. Game 5 It was over in a hurry. Bob Meusel's two-run triple and a Wally Pipp sacrifice fly made it 3-0. Then the Yankees got four more in the second, Joe Dugan's three-run inside-the-park homer the big blow. Bullet Joe Bush surrendered just three hits to the Giants, who now faced elimination. Game 6 Right off the bat, the Yankees struck with a Babe Ruth two-out homer in the first. But then the Giants and their Polo Grounds crowd came to life. Three singles in the first tied the score. Center fielder Bill Cunningham knocked in a go-ahead run in the fourth, followed by catcher Frank Snyder's homer in the fifth. Down 4-1, the Yankees took advantage of two singles followed by 3 consecutive walks. Ruth struck out with the score 4-3, and Bob Meusel hit a clutch two-out single scoring two runs, and a third scoring on an error, making it 6-4 Yankees. Sad Sam Jones would get the 6 out save to win the Yankees their first championship. Composite line score 1923 World Series (4‚Äì2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)

A best-of-seven playoff, the series was played between the American League (AL) pennant winner Washington Senators and the National League (NL) pennant winner New York Giants. The Senators defeated the Giants in seven games to win their first championship in club history. The Giants became the first team to play in four consecutive World Series, winning in 1921‚Äì1922 and losing in 1923‚Äì1924. Their long-time manager, John McGraw, made his ninth and final World Series appearance in 1924. The contest concluded with the second World Series-deciding game which ran to extra innings (the first had occurred in 1912). Later, the Senators would reorganize as the Minnesota Twins, again winning the World Series in 1987 and in 1991. Walter Johnson, after pitching his first 20-victory season (23) since 1919, was making his first World Series appearance, at the age of 36, while nearing the end of his career with the Senators. He lost his two starts, but the Senators battled back to force a Game 7, giving Johnson a chance to redeem himself when he came on in relief in that game. Johnson held on to get the win and give Washington its first championship. The seventh game is widely considered to be one of the most dramatic games in Series history. Johnson struck out 12 Giants batters in Game 1 in a losing cause. Although that total matched Ed Walsh's number in the 1906 World Series, it came in 12 innings. Johnson only struck out nine in the first nine innings. In Game 7, with the Senators behind 3‚Äì1 in the eighth, Bucky Harris hit a routine ground ball to third which hit a pebble and took a bad hop over Giants third baseman Freddie Lindstrom. Two runners scored on the play, tying the score at three. Walter Johnson then came in to pitch the ninth, and held the Giants scoreless into extra innings. With the score still 3‚Äì3, Washington came up in the 12th. With one out, and runners on first and second, Earl McNeely hit another grounder at Lindstrom, and again the ball took a bad hop, scoring Muddy Ruel with the Series-winning run. This was the first World Series to use the 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 home game pattern, which would be adapted as the standard format beginning the following year. This was the Senators' only World Series championship victory during the franchise's time in Washington. As the Minnesota Twins, the team won the World Series in 1987 and . This would be the last World Series win for a Washington based team until the Washington Nationals, who were originally the Montreal Expos, won the World Series in , 95 years after the Senators' only triumph. Summary Likely Giants pitcher Art Nehf sliding in safely at home during game one of the 1924 World Series. Matchups=Game 1 The Senators tied it at 2‚Äì2 with a run in the bottom of the ninth. The Giants scored two in the top of the 12th off the Big Train; Washington fought back for a run in the bottom of the inning, but left the tying run on third. Game 2 Washington fought back early in the game, scoring 3 runs in 5 innings. But the Giants would quickly fight back in the final three frames to tie the game as it went to the bottom of the ninth. With Joe Judge representing the potential winning run and 1 out, Roger Peckinpaugh hit a double to win the game and tie the series. Game 3 Washington threatened in the ninth. Ossie Bluege, the only man reliever Claude Jonnard faced, drew a bases-loaded walk to make it 6-4. Mule Watson then came in to nail down the last two outs. Rosy Ryan's fourth-inning home run is to date the only World Series home run by a relief pitcher. Game 4 Goose Goslin had a big game for the Senators, with three singles and a home run to go 4-for-4 and drive in four runs. Game 5 Johnson again pitched a complete game but the Giants recorded 13 hits off him, taking a 3-2 lead in the Series. Bentley broke a 1-1 tie in the fifth with a two-run home run, the second homer by a New York pitcher in the Series after Rosy Ryan's in Game 3. Game 6 Both Washington runs scored on a single in the fifth inning by manager Bucky Harris. Tom Zachary won his second game of the series, deadlocking the series at three games each. Game 7 The unheralded Curly Ogden was given the Game 7 start for Washington ‚Äì it was his only World Series appearance. He struck out a batter and walked one, and then was pulled for George Mogridge. It was later revealed that manager Bucky Harris started righthander Ogden so that the Giants would be locked into their \\"righthanded\\" lineup, before he switched to the lefthander Mogridge. With the Senators trailing 3‚Äì1 in the eighth inning with bases loaded and two outs, Bucky Harris hit a \\"bad hop\\" ground ball to third which Fred Lindstrom failed to catch (no error was charged). As a result, two runs scored for a 3‚Äì3 tie. In the ninth inning, Walter Johnson would step up as pitcher and pitch four scoreless innings. In the bottom of the 12th inning, Giants catcher Hank Gowdy stepped on his own discarded mask while trying to catch a Muddy Ruel foul pop-up, and dropped the ball for an error. Given a second chance in the at-bat, Ruel doubled. Johnson reached first on another error, and with Ruel on second and Johnson on first, Earl McNeely hit a \\"bad hop\\" ground ball to Lindstrom that was almost identical to Harris' eighth inning hit. Lindstrom again failed to catch the ball as it bounced over him into left field, and Ruel scored the series-winning run. The game holds the record as the longest Game 7 (by innings) in postseason history. In 2014, on the Series' 90th anniversary, the Library of Congress acquired a newsreel of highlight footage from Game 7, including McNeely's Series-winning base hit. CNN subsequently released this footage on its website. The next time a Washington team won the World Series would come 95 years later in , when the Washington Nationals did so against the Houston Astros.

","title":"1924 World Series"},{"id":"1332316","text":"The 1925 World Series was the championship series of the 1925 Major League Baseball season. A best-of-seven playoff, it was played between the National League (NL) pennant winner Pittsburgh Pirates and the Washington Senators. The Pirates defeated the Senators four games to three to win the series. In a reversal of fortune on all counts from the previous 1924 World Series, when Washington's Walter Johnson had come back from two losses to win the seventh and deciding game, Johnson dominated in Games 1 and 4, but lost Game 7\\\\. The Senators built up a 3‚Äì1 Series lead. After Pittsburgh won the next two games, Johnson again took the mound for Game 7, and carried a 6‚Äì4 lead into the bottom of the seventh inning. But errors by shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh in both the seventh and eighth innings led to four unearned runs, and the Pirates become the first team in a best-of-seven Series to overcome a 3‚Äì1 Series deficit to win the championship. Peckinpaugh, the Senators' regular shortstop and the 1925 American League Most Valuable Player, had a tough Series in the field, committing a record eight errors. Playing conditions were of no help. The 1925 Series was postponed twice due to poor weather, and Game 7 was played in what soon became a steady downpour, described as \\"probably the worst conditions ever for a World Series game.\\" Senators outfielder Goose Goslin reported that the fog prevented him from clearly seeing the infield during the last three innings of the game, and claimed that the Series-winning hit was actually a foul ball. In the next day's The New York Times, James Harrison wrote \\"In a grave of mud was buried Walter Johnson's ambition to join the select panel of pitchers who have won three victories in one World Series. With mud shackling his ankles and water running down his neck, the grand old man of baseball succumbed to weariness, a sore leg, wretched support and the most miserable weather conditions that ever confronted a pitcher.\\" Twice in Game 7 the visiting Senators held leads of at least three runs over the Pirates but failed to hold them. In fact, after the top of the first inning, Washington led 4‚Äì0. Nevertheless, Pittsburgh eventually won the game, scoring three runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to turn a 6‚Äì7 deficit into a 9‚Äì7 lead. To date, the four-run deficit is the largest ever overcome in the seventh game of the World Series. A memorable play occurred during the eighth inning of Game 3\\\\. The Senators' Sam Rice ran after an Earl Smith line drive hit into right center field. Rice made a diving \\"catch\\" into the temporary stands, but did not emerge with the ball for approximately 15 seconds. The Pirates contested the play, saying a fan probably stuffed the ball into Rice's glove. The call stood and Rice parried questions about the incident for the rest of his life‚Äînever explicitly saying whether he had or had not really made the catch. His typical answer (including to Commissioner Landis, who said it was a good answer) was always \\"The umpire said I caught it.\\" Rice left a sealed letter at the Hall of Fame to be opened after his death. In it, he had written: \\"At no time did I lose possession of the ball.\\" Writer Lamont Buchanan wrote, \\"In 1925, the Senators hopped the Big Train once too often... earning Bucky [Harris] the criticism of many fans and American League head [Ban] Johnson who dispatched an irate wire to the Senators manager.\\" In his telegram, Ban Johnson accused the manager of failing to relieve Walter Johnson \\"for sentimental reasons.\\" Despite the second-guessing, Harris always said, 'If I had it to do over again, I'd still pitch Johnson.'\\" This was Walter Johnson's second and final World Series appearance. By the time the original Washington Senators next reached the Fall Classic in 1933 ‚Äì their last before they became the Minnesota Twins, and the city's last until the Nationals ‚Äì Johnson had retired. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Wednesday, October 7, 1925, at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania This game remains to date the last road World Series game the Washington Senators/Minnesota Twins franchise has won. They have lost their last 14 since. Walter Johnson pitched a complete game and allowed only five hits and struck out ten. The Senators got on the board in the second on Joe Harris's home run off of Lee Meadows. In the fifth, they loaded the bases on three singles with no outs, but after Meadows struck out the next two batters, a two-run single by Sam Rice made it 3‚Äì0 Senators. Pie Traynor's leadoff home run in the bottom half gave the Pirates their only run in the game. The Senators added another run in the ninth off of Johnny Morrison when Goose Goslin hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Ossie Bluege's single. Game 2 Thursday, October 8, 1925, at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania In Game 2, Joe Judge's second inning home run off of Vic Aldridge gave the Senators a 1‚Äì0 lead, but the Pirates tied the game in the fourth on Glenn Wright's home run in the fourth off of Stan Coveleski. In the eighth, Kiki Cuyler's two-run home run in the eighth following a Roger Peckinpaugh error that let Eddie Moore reached first put the Pirates up 3‚Äì1. In the ninth, the Senators loaded the bases with no outs on two walks and a single, but scored only once on Bobby Veach's sacrifice fly as Aldridge retired the next two batters and the Pirates tied the series heading to Washington. Game 3 Saturday, October 10, 1925, at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. In Game 3, the Pirates struck first in the second when Pie Traynor hit a leadoff triple off of Alex Ferguson and scored on Glenn Wright's sacrifice fly, but the Senators tied the game in the third off of Ray Kremer when Sam Rice hit a leadoff single and scored on Joe Judge's double. The Pirates regained the lead in the fourth when Kiki Cuyler hit a leadoff single and scored on Clyde Barnhart's double. They added to their lead in the sixth on Kremer's RBI single with two on, but Goose Goslin's home run in the bottom half cut their lead back to one. Next inning, the Senators loaded the bases on a walk and two singles with one out before Judge's sacrifice fly tied the game, then an RBI single by Joe Harris put them up 4‚Äì3. A key play occurred in the eighth inning when Earl Smith's line drive into right-center field was caught by Sam Rice who fell into the temporary stands (see overview above). Firpo Marberry pitched two shutout innings to close the game. Game 4 Sunday, October 11, 1925, at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. This was Johnson's only post-season shutout. A three-run home run by Goose Goslin followed by a solo home run by Joe Harris off of Emil Yde, who pitched just 2 1/3 innings, in the third inning put the Senators up 3‚Äì1 in the series. Yde became the first pitcher in the history of the World Series to surrender back-to-back home runs. Game 5 Monday, October 12, 1925, at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. The Pirates loaded the bases in the first, but failed to score. In the bottom half, Sam Rice hit a leadoff single and scored on Goose Goslin's double. In the third, after two walks, Clyde Barnhart's RBI single tied the game, then Pie Traynor's sacrifice fly put the Pirates up 2‚Äì1. Joe Harris's home run in the fourth tied the game. After a walk and single, back-to-back RBI singles by Kiki Cuyler and Clyde Barnhart in the seventh put the Pirates up 4‚Äì2 and knock Stan Coveleski out of the game. The Senators cut the lead to 4‚Äì3 in the bottom half when Nemo Leibold hit a leadoff double and scored on Sam Rice's single, but the Pirates got the run back in the eighth when Glenn Wright hit a leadoff double off of Tom Zachary and scored on Stuffy McInnis's single. They added another run in the ninth on Wright's RBI single off of Firpo Marberry with the run charged to Zachary. Vic Aldridge retired the Senators in order in the bottom half as the Pirates' 6‚Äì3 win forced a Game 6 in Pittsburgh. Game 6 Tuesday, October 13, 1925, at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania The Senators struck first on Goose Goslin's home run in the first, then added another run in the second on Roger Peckinpaugh's RBI double, but Pirates' Ray Kremer would shut them out afterward. In the third, with runners on second and third, Clyde Barnhart's groundout and Pie Traynor's single scored a run each to tie the game. Eddie Moore's fifth inning home run put the Pirates up 3‚Äì2. Their lead held, forcing a Game 7. Game 7 Thursday, October 15, 1925, at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania The Senators loaded the bases in the first on a single and two walks with one out. A walk to Joe Judge and RBI single by Ossie Bluege put them up 2‚Äì0 and knock starter Vic Aldridge out of the game. Johnny Morrison came in relief, but a catcher interference call and error allowed two more runs to score. In the third, a leadoff single by Morrison, then RBI hits by Eddie Moore, Max Carey and Clyde Barnhart cut the Senators' lead to 4‚Äì3. In the fourth, Joe Harris's two-run double extended Washington's lead to 6‚Äì3. Back-to-back doubles by Carey and Kiki Cuyler in the fifth cut the lead to 6‚Äì4, then in the seventh, Moore reached first on an error before Carey's RBI double and Traynor's RBI triple tied the game. Roger Peckinpaugh's home run in the eighth off of Ray Kremer put the Senators back atop 7‚Äì6, but in the bottom half, back-to-back two-out doubles by Earl Smith and Carson Bigbee tied the game. A walk and fielder's choice loaded the bases before Cuyler's two-run double put the Pirates atop 9‚Äì7. Red Oldham retired the Senators in order in the ninth to end the series. The Pirates hit Walter Johnson hard for 15 hits in a 9‚Äì7 comeback win in rainy, wet and muddy conditions. The Pirates were the first team to come back from a 3‚Äì1 deficit in a seven-game series.

The Cardinals defeated the Yankees four games to three in the best-of-seven series, which took place from October 2 to 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium and Sportsman's Park. This was the first World Series appearance (and first National League pennant win) for the Cardinals, and would be the first of 11 World Series championships in Cardinals history. The Yankees were playing in their fourth World Series in six years after winning their first American League pennant in 1921 and their first world championship in 1923. They would play in another 36 World Series (and win 26 of those) through the end of the 2019 season. In Game 1, Herb Pennock pitched the Yankees to a 2‚Äì1 win over the Cards. In Game 2, pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander evened the Series for St. Louis with a 6‚Äì2 victory. Knuckleballer Jesse Haines' shutout in Game 3 gave St. Louis a 2‚Äì1 Series lead. In the Yankees' 10‚Äì5 Game 4 win, Babe Ruth hit three home runs, a World Series record equaled only four times since.Ruth in 1928, Reggie Jackson in 1977, Albert Pujols in 2011 and Pablo Sandoval in 2012. According to newspaper reports, Ruth had promised a sickly boy named Johnny Sylvester to hit a home run for him in Game 4\\\\. After Ruth's three-homer game, the boy's condition miraculously improved. The newspapers' account of the story is disputed by contemporary baseball historians, but it remains one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history. Pennock again won for the Yankees in Game 5, 3‚Äì2. Cards' player-manager Rogers Hornsby chose Alexander to start Game 6, and used him in relief to close out Game 7\\\\. Behind Alexander, the Cardinals won the final two games of the series, and thus the world championship. In Game 7, the Yankees, trailing 3‚Äì2 in the bottom of the ninth inning and down to their last out, Ruth walked, bringing up Bob Meusel. Ruth, successful in half of his stolen base attempts in his career, took off for second base on the first pitch. Meusel swung and missed, and catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to second baseman Hornsby who tagged Ruth out, ending Game 7 and thereby crowning his Cardinals World Series champions for the first time. The 1926 World Series is the only Series to date which ended with a baserunner being caught stealing.  Season summary  Yankees manager Miller Huggins on a 1909 baseball card The Cardinals won the 1926 National League pennant with 89 wins and 65 losses, two games ahead of the runner-up Cincinnati Reds, after finishing only fourth in 1925 at 77‚Äì76. Before 1926 was half over, they traded outfielder Heinie Mueller to the New York Giants for outfielder Billy Southworth. They also claimed future Hall of Fame pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander on waivers from the Chicago Cubs. Their starting rotation was led by Flint Rhem with 20 wins and a 3.21 earned run average (ERA), far surpassing his eight wins and 4.92 ERA of 1925. Offensively, the Cardinals were led by Jim Bottomley, Rogers Hornsby (who had batted over .400 in 1925) and catcher Bob O'Farrell, 1926 National League MVP-to-be. The 1926 NL pennant race was heated. During the second and third weeks of September, both the Cardinals and the Reds had multi-game winning streaks and traded first and second place almost every day. On September 17, the Cards took a one-game lead over the Reds and extended their lead when the Reds lost several games in a row. They lost the last game of the season to the Reds on September 26, but still finished two games ahead of them in first place in the final standings. The Yankees had the best record in the AL at 91‚Äì63, finishing three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians and greatly improving on their 69-win, seventh-place 1925 season. Lou Gehrig played his first full season as the Yankees' starting first baseman, and the team traded for rookie shortstop Tony Lazzeri in the offseason, eventually playing him at second base. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Ruth led the offense, while Pennock and Urban Shocker led the starting rotation with 42 wins between them. In early September 1926, thousands of Cleveland fans, confident that their Indians would win the pennant even when they trailed the Yankees by six games, made World Series ticket reservations. By September 23, the Indians were only two games behind New York, but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind. On September 11, Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis met with representatives from four of the top teams in each of the two major leagues. The group gave home field to the AL for World Series Games 1‚Äì2 (scheduled for October 2 and 3) and 6‚Äì7, while the NL would host Games 3‚Äì5. Each game was to start at 1:30 p.m. local time. Some bookmakers made the Yankees a 15-to-1 Series favorite, while others, like New York's top betting commissioners, thought the teams were evenly matched. One New York Times writer found \\"little justification for installing either team as the favorite\\". Regardless of the odds, players from both teams were confident of victory. Hornsby said, \\"We're going to come through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That's what it takes to win. ... We're going to beat the Yankees. Any of my ball players will tell you that, and we expect to do it.\\" Yankee skipper Miller Huggins retorted, Series summaryMatchups=Game 1 Yankee outfielder Bob Meusel in 1921 Yankee Stadium was filled with 61,658 fans on October 2 for Game 1. Those without tickets gathered at City Hall to watch the game's progress as charted on two large scoreboards. Before the start of the game, New York Supreme Court judge Robert F. Wagner, then a candidate for the United States Senate, threw out the ceremonial first pitch and took his position in the VIP box next to New York City mayor Jimmy Walker. Commissioner Landis and former heavyweight champion of the world Jack Dempsey were also in attendance. Southpaw Bill Sherdel started for the Cardinals, having posted a 16‚Äì12 record with 235 innings pitched in the regular season. The Yankees started Pennock, the team's only 20-game winner that season. The future Hall of Fame pitcher, nicknamed \\"The Knight of Kennett Square\\" for his hometown, had a 3.62 ERA in 266 innings during the regular season, and had finished third in the American League Most Valuable Player Award balloting behind winner George Burns and runner-up Johnny Mostil. Taylor Douthit led off Game 1 with a double to left, advanced to third on Southworth's slow grounder to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, stayed there on Hornsby's comebacker right to Pennock but came home on \\"Sunny Jim\\" Bottomley's bloop single for the first run of the Series. In the bottom half, Sherdel walked Earle Combs, Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel, to load the bases. Gehrig scored Combs with a fielder's choice grounder for his first World Series run batted in (RBI), reaching first ahead of the relay. The Cardinals and Yankees were tied 1‚Äì1 after the first inning. In the bottom of the third, Ruth singled and Meusel bunted him over, but Ruth split his pants sliding into second, prompting radio announcer Graham McNamee to exclaim, \\"Babe is the color of a red brick house!\\" Doc Woods, the team's trainer, ran out and sewed up Ruth's pants, much to the amusement of the crowd. The score was still tied at one apiece in the bottom of the sixth, just as rain began to fall. Ruth lined a single past third baseman Les Bell. Meusel again sacrificed Ruth to second. Gehrig followed with a single, scoring Ruth and giving the Yankees the lead. Lazzeri lined a shot to left but Gehrig, on a headfirst dive, was tagged out at third by Bell. Lazzeri advanced to second on the throw. Bell bobbled Dugan's grounder for an error to put runners at first and third, but Hank Severeid forced Dugan at second to end the inning. The Yankees maintained their one-run advantage through the end of the eighth inning. In the top of the ninth, Bottomley singled off Pennock but could not advance, giving the Yankees a 2‚Äì1 win in Game 1. Gehrig was their offensive star with both of his team's RBI. Pennock went the distance, striking out four and yielding but three hits, two in the first and one in the ninth. Hard-luck loser Sherdel gave up only two runs and six hits while striking out one. Game 2 Yankees pitcher Urban Shocker The second game was played the next day, October 3, at Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 63,600. Urban Shocker was the starting pitcher for the Yankees. With 19 wins and 11 losses, Shocker had the second-best pitching record on the team, behind the Game 1 starter, southpaw Herb Pennock. Shocker had a 3.38 ERA in 258 innings, along with 59 strikeouts in the 1926 season. The Cardinals' Game 2 starter was 39-year-old Grover Cleveland \\"Old Pete\\" Alexander, a veteran player in his 16th major league season. That season, he posted numbers considerably lower than the pitching season statistics from his prime in the late 1910s with the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs. Alexander had compiled a 12‚Äì10 record in 200 innings, while posting a 3.05 ERA and 48 strikeouts, compared to the nearly 250 strikeouts he had in 1915 with the Phillies. The Cardinals were first to bat in the game. After giving up a double to Rogers Hornsby, Shocker got a groundout from Jim Bottomley to end the run-scoring threat. In the Yankees' half of the inning, Mark Koenig grounded into a double play, and Babe Ruth followed by striking out. The Cardinals threatened again in the second inning, after back-to-back singles by catcher Bob O'Farrell and shortstop Tommy Thevenow. However, Alexander came to the plate and popped up to Koenig to end the inning. The Yankees scored first in the bottom of the second inning. Bob Meusel hit a single into center field, and Lou Gehrig followed by hitting a grounder to Alexander, which advanced Meusel to second base. Tony Lazzeri then hit a single to left field that scored Meusel from second. Joe Dugan followed with a single of his own, moving Lazzeri to third base. On the following play, Yankees catcher Hank Severeid struck out, and Lazzeri then attempted to steal home plate. Alexander made an error on his throw to catcher Bob O'Farrell, and Lazzeri was able to slide into home plate for the second Yankees run of the inning. O'Farrell then threw the ball to Thevenow, but the tag was late and Dugan was called safe at second base. The inning ended when Alexander struck out Shocker. In the third inning, Taylor Douthit hit an infield single to shortstop Koenig, and Billy Southworth followed with a single to left field, advancing Douthit to second base. Hornsby laid down a sacrifice bunt to Shocker, moving each runner up a base. Bottomley hit a single into left field, scoring both Douthit and Southworth. The next two batters, Les Bell and Chick Hafey, hit into outs to conclude the inning. In the top of the seventh inning. Bob O'Farrell lined a double, and Tommy Thevenow followed with a single into left field. Pitcher Alexander popped up to Lazzeri, and Douthit followed with a fly ball to left field. Southworth then hit a three-run home run, giving the Cardinals a 5‚Äì2 advantage over the Yankees. Hornsby then grounded out to Koenig to end the inning. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Dugan all grounded out in the bottom of the seventh inning. In the top of the eighth, Bottomley hit a single into right field. Yankees manager Miller Huggins came out of the dugout and took Shocker out of the game, calling in Bob Shawkey from the bullpen to replace him. Shawkey struck out the first two batters he faced, and Bottomley was tagged out after attempting to steal second base. The Yankees could not produce any runs in their half of the inning. In the ninth inning, Sad Sam Jones, a 22-year veteran in the American League, replaced Dutch Ruether, who had replaced pitcher Shawkey. Jones gave up an inside-the-park home run to Thevenow. Thevenow had only two other home runs in his career, both of which were inside-the-park and during the 1926 regular season. Jones then walked Douthit and Hornsby and gave up a single to Southworth. With the bases loaded and two outs in the top of the ninth inning, Bottomley hit a fly ball to center fielder Earle Combs. The Yankees did not score in the bottom of the ninth inning, and lost the game to the Cardinals by a 6‚Äì2 score. Alexander pitched a complete game, allowed hits in only two of the nine innings and did not allow a Yankee hit after the third inning. He also had a series-high 10 strikeouts, allowing four hits, one earned run and one walk. Meanwhile, the Yankees' starter Shocker allowed ten hits and five earned runs, including a home run, in seven innings of work. Shawkey had a perfect inning with two strikeouts, while Jones gave up two hits and allowed two walks in the ninth inning. Game 3 Yankees pitcher Dutch Ruether in 1925 After Game 2 ended on October 3, the Yankees and Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that the workday end by three the next afternoon so that the city could welcome the Cardinals at Union Station. The Cardinals players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000Adjusted for inflation, $4,000 in 1926 has the buying power of $48,547.57 in 2008. and paid for by the city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, a new pair of shoes, and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100. As the Cardinals were receiving special treatment from the people of St. Louis, fans were lining up outside Sportsman's Park with the hope of being able to purchase tickets to Game 3 for a price of $3.30. Sportsman's Park was filled with 37,708 people on October 5 for Game 3\\\\. On the mound for the Cardinals was right-handed knuckleball pitcher Jesse Haines, a future Hall of Famer with a 13‚Äì4 record and 3.25 ERA in 183 innings in 1926. Starting for the Yankees was southpaw pitcher Dutch Ruether, who had a 14‚Äì9 record with a 4.60 ERA in 1926. The game was rain delayed for 30 minutes during the top half of the fourth inning. Once the game resumed, the Cardinals came to bat and scored the first runs of the game. Les Bell, a .325 hitter with 17 home runs that season, led the Cardinals with a single to center field. Chick Hafey dropped a sacrifice bunt straight to Ruether, who then threw it to second baseman Tony Lazzeri. Bell beat Lazzeri's tag at second base and was called safe by the umpire. Bob O'Farrell was walked, and Tommy Thevenow hit a grounder to Lazzeri, who tossed it to Mark Koenig for the force out at second base. Koenig tagged O'Farrell out, but made an error in his throw to first baseman Lou Gehrig, which resulted in a run. Then, Haines hit a Ruether pitch for a two-run home run. The Cardinals were leading the Yankees 3‚Äì0 by the end of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home following a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4‚Äì0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig. Game 4 Future Hall of Famer Waite Hoyt started Game 4 for the Yankees at Sportsman's Park on October 6. Hoyt had a 16‚Äì12 record with a 3.85 ERA in 218 innings for the 1926 season. This was Hoyt's fourth World Series with the Yankees, and he entered the 1926 Series with over 35 innings of pitching experience in the championship series. He was opposed by Flint Rhem, the Cardinals' 20-game winner who had led the team with both a .741 winning percentage and 258 innings pitched. Babe Ruth in 1921 In the first inning, after striking out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem gave up a home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came into the bottom of the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1‚Äì1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run- scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning. The Cardinals responded by scoring three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning. With one out and no runners on the bases, Hafey hit a single. O'Farrell followed and hit a ground ball towards Koenig that he bobbled, enabling O'Farrell and Hafey to reach first and second base, respectively. Tommy Thevenow followed with a double to right field that got by Meusel, scoring Hafey and moving O'Farrell to third base. Cardinals' manager Rogers Hornsby then put in left-handed infielder Specs Toporczer to pinch hit for Rhem, who was done pitching for the game. Toporczer hit a fly ball to Earle Combs in center field, upon which O'Farrell promptly tagged up to score another Cardinal run. With the game tied at three apiece and a runner at second base, Douthit hit a double in the outfield, which scored Thevenow. Southworth followed with a single to left fielder Ruth, and Douthit immediately tried to score. Ruth threw from left field to catcher Hank Severeid, who tagged Douthit out at home plate. To start the top of the fifth inning, Art Reinhart was put in as pitcher. Reinhart walked Combs and followed by giving up a run-scoring double to Koenig. He then walked Ruth and Meusel in succession to load the bases for Gehrig. Reinhart walked Gehrig, allowing Koenig to score and keeping the bases loaded with no outs. Hi Bell replaced Reinhart as pitcher, but he was not able to suppress the Yankees' offense. Lazzeri hit a sacrifice fly to right field, which scored Ruth and moved Meusel up to third base. Dugan then hit a weak groundball; he was thrown out at first by catcher O'Farrell, but Meusel scored and Gehrig went to second base. Bell then balked, moving Gehrig to third base. Severeid was walked, and pitcher Hoyt ended the inning by hitting into a force play at second base. The Yankees expanded on their three- run lead in the next inning. After the entire Yankees lineup batted in the fifth inning, Combs was back at the plate to start the sixth. Combs hit an infield single past shortstop Thevenow. Koenig followed by striking out. Ruth, with two home runs already in the game, came up to the plate. The count on Ruth went up to three balls and two strikes before he hit a long home run. Ruth's three home runs was a feat equaled only thrice since. As one of the game announcers (either McNamee or Carlin)Smelser writes that radio transcripts did not indicate who‚Äîeither Graham McNamee or Phillips Carlin‚Äîannounced Ruth's third home run. described the situation: It was measured at over and had cleared the wall in center field, crashing through the window of an auto dealer across the street from the stadium. Locals claimed it was the longest home run ever hit in St. Louis. Meusel then hit a single in right field, but was tagged out as he tried to head for second base. Gehrig followed with a double to the opposite side, but could not score when Lazzeri popped up to Thevenow to end the inning. In the seventh inning, the Yankees faced a new pitcher, this time southpaw Bill Hallahan, who served as both a starter and reliever for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10‚Äì4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat in the bottom of the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10‚Äì5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits. With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game 5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel. =Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester= The 1926 World Series produced one of the most famous anecdotes in baseball history, involving Babe Ruth and Johnny Sylvester. Sylvester was an 11-year- old boy from Essex Fells, New Jersey who was supposedly hospitalized after falling off a horse. Sylvester asked his father to get him a baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. Prior to the start of the World Series, the boy's parents sent urgent telegrams to the Yankees in St. Louis, asking for an autographed ball. Soon, the family received an airmail package with two balls, one autographed by the entire St. Louis Cardinals team and the other with signatures from a number of Yankees players and a personal message from Ruth saying, \\"I'll knock a homer for you on Wednesday\\". After Ruth hit three home runs in Game 4 on October 6, newspapers reported that Sylvester's condition had miraculously improved. After the World Series had ended, Ruth made a highly publicized visit to Sylvester's home, in which the boy said to Ruth, \\"I'm sorry the Yanks lost the series\\". In the spring of 1927, Sylvester's uncle visited Ruth and thanked him for saving the boy's life. Ruth asked how the boy was doing and asked the uncle to give the boy his regards. After the man left, Ruth, who was seated next to a group of baseball writers, said, \\"Now who the hell is Johnny Sylvester?\\" There have been many alternate versions of this event. One version, which was later portrayed in The Babe Ruth Story, claims that Ruth went to Sylvester's hospital bed and promised him in person that he would hit a home run for him. On October 9, Ruth followed up on Sylvester and told him he would \\"try to knock you another homer, maybe two today\\". Differing newspaper reports from October 1926 claimed that Sylvester suffered from blood poisoning, a spinal infection, a sinus condition, or had a condition requiring a spinal fusion. Contemporary analyses dispute whether Sylvester was ever hospitalized, dying, or if Ruth's three home runs had actually saved the boy's life, as claimed by the newspapers. Game 5 New York Yankees pitcher Herb Pennock on a 1922 baseball card Game 5, played at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis on October 7, featured a rematch between Game 1 starters Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel. Pennock had pitched a complete game three-hitter in the 2‚Äì1 Yankees victory, while Sherdel had pitched seven innings, giving up two runs and six hits. Through the first three innings of the fifth game, both pitchers held the opposing team to no runs and a limited number of hits. In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Cardinals cracked through Pennock's tough pitching. Jim Bottomley began by hitting a one-out double past left fielder Babe Ruth. Les Bell followed with a single to right field, scoring Bottomley. Chick Hafey then hit a fly ball caught in foul territory by Ruth, and Bell was called out while attempting to steal second base. In the top of the sixth inning, Pennock hit a line drive double into left field past Hafey. Cardinals' catcher Bob O'Farrell threw to Tommy Thevenow in hopes of picking off Pennock, who was standing a considerable distance away from second base. Thevenow made an error with his tag on Pennock, and Pennock was safe at second base. Earle Combs, the Yankees leadoff hitter, followed by drawing a walk. With runners at first and second base, Koenig hit a single to left fielder Hafey. Pennock scored on the play, and Combs moved to second base. Ruth then struck out, and Bob Meusel followed by hitting a sacrifice fly to right fielder Billy Southworth, on which Combs promptly advanced to third base. Lou Gehrig drew a walk to load the bases for Tony Lazzeri, who ended the inning by hitting a fly ball to center fielder Wattie Holm. The Cardinals came back to take the lead in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score the run and give the Cardinals a 2‚Äì1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, advancing Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2‚Äì2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings. The Yankees immediately took advantage of Sherdel in the top of the tenth inning. Koenig led things off by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at first base, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. Gehrig was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the Yankees a one-run lead. Mike Gazella, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was hit by a pitch from Sherdel. With the bases loaded again, Severeid popped up to second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, but they could not score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3‚Äì2. Both Pennock and Sherdel pitched ten-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine hits and two earned runs, while walking five and striking out two. Pennock finished the game giving up just seven hits and two runs, while striking out four batters. Game 6 The teams moved back to Yankee Stadium for Game 6\\\\. Over 48,000 fans came into Yankee Stadium on October 9 to see if the Yankees could win their second World Series in franchise history. The game's pitching matchup was between Grover Cleveland Alexander and Bob Shawkey, both of whom had made appearances in previous games in the series. Shawkey had come in as relief in Games 2 and 3, while Alexander had pitched a complete game against the Yankees in the Cardinals' Game 2 victory. In the 1926 season, Shawkey had made most of his pitching appearances in relief, and had been an occasional starter on the Yankees rotation. He started 10 of his 29 total pitching appearances and posted an 8‚Äì7 record with a 3.62 earned run average. The game was lopsided from the start. In the top of the first inning, Shawkey gave up three runs on three hits, with the runs coming from a Jim Bottomley double and Les Bell single. Alexander encountered a minor setback in the fourth inning. To open up the bottom of the inning, Bob Meusel launched a triple into left field and scored on the following ground out by Lou Gehrig. Alexander shut down the Yankees for the rest of the inning, and the Cardinals held on to a 3‚Äì1 lead. In the top of the fifth inning, the Cardinals expanded their two-run lead. Tommy Thevenow hit a single to left fielder Babe Ruth. Alexander laid down a sacrifice bunt and was tagged out by first baseman Gehrig, but was successful in advancing Thevenow to second base. Wattie Holm, substituting for Taylor Douthit as center fielder, followed by hitting a single into center field, scoring Thevenow on the play. Billy Southworth and Rogers Hornsby followed with groundouts in the infield to end the inning. The Cardinals scored again in the top of the seventh inning. Thevenow again led the inning by hitting a single into left field. Alexander bunted right in front of the plate. Yankees catcher Hank Severeid made the throw to second baseman Tony Lazzeri, but Lazzeri made an error on the play, and both runners were safe at their respective bases. Holm followed by hitting a weak grounder that led to a force out of Thevenow at third base. With runners at first and second base, Southworth lined a double right by Ruth, scoring Alexander and sending Holm to third base. Urban Shocker, the starter in Game 2, then came in to relieve Shawkey as pitcher. Shocker gave up a single to Hornsby into center field, allowing Holm and Southworth to score. Bottomley then hit a grounder to shortstop Mark Koenig, who stepped on second base to get Hornsby out on the force play. Bell followed with a two-run home run, extending the Cardinals' lead to 9‚Äì1. Chick Hafey lined a double into left field, but Bob O'Farrell ended the inning by striking out. In the bottom of the seventh inning, the Yankees scored one run on an Earle Combs single to cut the Cardinals' lead to seven runs. In the eighth inning, Myles Thomas came in to relieve Shocker, who had given up three hits and two unearned runs in less than an inning of work. Meanwhile, Alexander shut down the Yankees offense for the rest of the game. In the top of the ninth inning, the Cardinals increased their lead back to eight runs after Hornsby had an RBI groundout, scoring Southworth. Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave up only two runs on eight hits, while striking out six batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up 13 hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run. Game 7 The deciding Game 7 was played on October 10, 1926, at Yankee Stadium in front of a crowd of 38,093 people. The game featured two future Hall of Famers, who were both winners in their respective pitching appearances earlier in the series. Jesse Haines took to the mound for the Cardinals; he had pitched in relief in Game 1 and threw a complete game shutout against the Yankees in Game 3\\\\. Waite Hoyt had pitched a complete game 10‚Äì5 Yankees victory in Game 4. Cardinals pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1915 The Yankees scored the first run of the game in the third inning on a Babe Ruth home run into the right field bleachers. In the following half inning, the Cardinals came back to take a 3‚Äì1 lead over the Yankees. Jim Bottomley lined a one-out single into left field to start the Cardinals' fourth inning rally. Les Bell just barely made it to first base after shortstop Mark Koenig accidentally kicked the ball while trying to field it. With runners at first and second base, Chick Hafey hit a bloop single into left field, which loaded up the bases for catcher Bob O'Farrell. This time, left fielder Bob Meusel made an error by dropping O'Farrell's fly ball, so Bottomley scored to tie the game, and the bases remained loaded. Tommy Thevenow followed with a two-run single to right fielder Ruth. Hoyt struck out the next batter, and Wattie Holm hit into a force play at second base. All three runs in the inning were charged as unearned on Hoyt, due to the two Yankee errors. In the sixth inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid followed with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game 1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3‚Äì2 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game. Rogers Hornsby had to determine who he would put in to replace Haines as pitcher. Although Grover Cleveland Alexander had pitched a complete game the day before and may have spent the night drinking (Alexander later denied this, saying that Hornsby specifically told him to limit his celebrating since he might be needed the next day), Hornsby decided to trust him after Alexander said he \\"had it in easy in there\\" in Game 6 and would be ready whenever Hornsby needed him. According to the popular legend, Alexander told Hornsby his strategy: After getting a strike on Lazzeri, Alexander would then throw an inside fastball. Hornsby warned him that that pitch was Lazzeri's favorite. Alexander responded that if Lazzeri swung at it, he would hit it foul, and Alexander would then throw an outside curve to strike him out. Hornsby then supposedly said, \\"Who am I to tell you how to pitch?\\" The first two pitches thrown by Alexander to batter Tony Lazzeri went for a strike and a ball, respectively. On the third pitch, Lazzeri hit a fly ball down the left-field line. The ball initially appeared to be going into the stands for a grand slam, but at the last minute, it curved several feet into the stands in foul territory. Alexander then threw a curveball that Lazzeri swung at and missed for strike three, ending the inning and the Yankees' threat. Alexander retired the Yankees in order in the eighth inning. The Cardinals did nothing offensively in the top of the ninth inning, so it was up to Alexander to preserve the Cardinals' game in the bottom of the ninth. Alexander got the first two batters of the inning, Combs and Dugan, to ground out to third baseman Bell. With two outs and no runners on base, Alexander faced Ruth. Ruth had hit a solo home run and walked three times in the game. Manager Hornsby walked to the mound to talk with Alexander. Alexander told Hornsby that he would rather face Ruth than intentionally walk him. Alexander's first pitch to Ruth fell in for a solid strike in the middle of the plate. Alexander's next pitch fell outside of the strike zone for ball one. Ruth then fouled the next pitch, making the count one ball and two strikes. Alexander's next two pitches fell too low for balls two and three, making it a full count. The following full count pitch was noted by New York Herald Tribune sportswriter W. O. McGeehan: \\"The count went to three and two, Ruth was swaying eagerly. The soupbone creaked again. The ball seemed a fraction of an inch from being a strike. Ruth paused a moment. Even he was uncertain. Then he trotted down to first.\\" With two outs and Ruth at first base, left fielder Bob Meusel came up to the plate, with Lou Gehrig waiting in the batting circle after him. Meusel was a .315 hitter that year and had batted in 81 runs in just over 100 regular-season games. Meusel also had success in Game 6 against Alexander, with a double and triple. Just as Meusel was about to take his first pitch, Ruth made the bold move of trying to steal second base. Ruth was known as a good but overly aggressive baserunner, with about a 50% success rate at stealing bases in his career, and his attempt surprised many people throughout the stadium. Meusel swung and missed, and Cardinals catcher Bob O'Farrell immediately threw the ball to second baseman Hornsby. Hornsby reached for the ball, and laid the tag immediately on Ruth. As the game announcer described it, \\"Ruth is walked again for the fourth time today. One strike on Bob Meusel. Going down to second! The game is over! Babe tried to steal second and is put out catcher to second!\\" As Hornsby recalled later, Ruth \\"didn't say a word. He didn't even look around or up at me. He just picked himself up and walked away\\". Ruth's failed attempt to steal second base ended the 1926 World Series; it is the only time a World Series has ended with a runner being caught stealing. Ruth explained later that he attempted to steal second base because he thought no one would expect it. He hoped that by getting to second base, he could have an easier chance at scoring if Meusel hit a single into the outfield. Aftermath The Cardinals went back home to St. Louis to a rapturous fan reception, having won their first undisputed world championship. Each member of the championship team collected $5,584.51, while the Yankees' players were given $3,417.75 each. To date, the Cardinals' 11 world championships are the most won by any National League team, and rank second only to the Yankees' 27. The Cardinals' and Yankees' last wins were within two years of each other (having occurred in 2011 and 2009, respectively). The two teams would meet again in 1928 (which the Yankees swept in four games); 1942 (which the Cardinals won in five games); 1943 (which the Yankees won in five games); and 1964 (which the Cardinals won in seven games). As for the Yankees, Game 7 of the 1926 series marked the last postseason loss for the team in a decade. The Bronx Bombers would go on to sweep their next three World Series, 1927, 1928, and 1932. Their next World Series loss would be Game 1 of the 1936 World Series which the Yankees would eventually win 4 games to 2.

This was the first sweep of a National League team by an American League team. That year, the Yankees led the American League in runs scored, hits, triples, home runs, base on balls, batting average, slugging average and on-base percentage. It featured legends Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig at their peaks. The team won a then-league record 110 games, finished with a 19-game lead over second place, and are considered by many to be the greatest team in the history of baseball. The 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates, with MVP Paul Waner, led the National League in runs, hits, batting average and on- base percentage. The teams=The New York Yankees Ruth and Gehrig at a 1927 exhibition game The 1927 New York Yankees had perhaps the most feared line-up in the history of baseball. Nicknamed \\"Murderers Row,\\" their batting order boasted the all-time great Babe Ruth at the top of his considerable powers, hitting .356 with a then-record 60 home runs and 164 RBI that year. He was complemented by future Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig at first base, who hit .373 with 47 home runs and a league-leading 175 RBI, Tony Lazzeri at second base who drove in 102 runs with a .309 average, and center fielder Earle Combs, who hit .356 and scored 137 runs as the team's leadoff hitter. Left fielder Bob Meusel also drove in over 100 runs, with a .337 average. The team's pitching staff was led by another Hall of Famer, Waite Hoyt, who had his best season with a 22‚Äì7 record and a league-leading 2.63 ERA to add to his league-leading wins total. Three more pitchers won 18 or more games, rookie Wilcy Moore (19‚Äì7, 2.28), Herb Pennock (19‚Äì8, 3.00) and Urban Shocker (18‚Äì6, 2.84). Moore would have won the ERA title under current rules, but in those days qualification was based on the number of complete games pitched, and he made only 12 starts all year: 13 of his wins and a league-leading 13 saves (figured retroactively) came during his 38 relief appearances. Rounding out the staff were veteran Dutch Ruether (13‚Äì6, 3.38), George Pipgras (10‚Äì3, 4.11) and swingman Myles Thomas (7‚Äì4, 4.87). Not surprisingly, the Yankees ran away with the pennant under the leadership of manager Miller Huggins. They finished with a record of 110‚Äì44, 19 games in front of the second-place Philadelphia Athletics. They were overwhelming favorites to win the World Series. The Pittsburgh Pirates The 1927 Pittsburgh Pirates were by no means a weak team, but they certainly suffer in comparison with their American League rivals. The Pirates went 94‚Äì60 for manager Donie Bush during the regular season, finishing games ahead of the defending World Champions St. Louis Cardinals. The Pirates also had their share of future Hall of Famers, but they were not quite of the caliber of those of the Yankees. The team's best hitter was right fielder Paul \\"Big Poison\\" Waner, who hit a league-leading .380 and drove in 131 runs, also a league-leading total. His brother, rookie center fielder Lloyd \\"Little Poison\\" Waner hit .355 and scored a league-leading 133 runs, in spite of his almost complete lack of power (he collected just 25 extra-base hits in over 650 plate appearances). Third baseman Pie Traynor hit .342 and drove in over 100 runs, joining shortstop Glenn Wright who also topped the century mark. However, Wright and Paul Waner also led the team in home runs with 9 each, underscoring the huge difference in power with their rivals: the Pirates hit 54 home runs as a team, fewer than Babe Ruth by himself, and barely a third as many as the Yankees' 158. Other solid hitters for the Pirates included first baseman Joe Harris, who hit .326 with 73 RBI, second baseman George Grantham (.305) and left fielder Clyde Barnhart (.319). In fact, catcher Johnny Gooch, who hit .258, was the only regular besides Wright to hit below .300, and back-up outfielder Kiki Cuyler added his own .309 average in 285 at-bats to the parade, as the Pirates batted .305 as a team‚Äîpitchers included. The Pirates' pitching was not as dominant. Two veterans of the 1925 World Championship team, Lee Meadows and Ray Kremer both posted 19 wins, with Kremer leading the league with a 2.47 ERA. Carmen Hill had pitched part of six seasons in the majors before 1927, never winning more than three games. In 1927, he put everything together, winning a team-leading 22 games against 11 losses, with a 3.24 ERA at age 31. Vic Aldridge went 15‚Äì10 as the fourth starter, but his 4.25 ERA was well over the league average. In the bullpen, Johnny Miljus put together a good season, posting a 1.90 ERA in 76 innings, with an 8‚Äì3 record. Series SummaryMatchups=Game 1 The 1927 World Series opened under sunny skies and balmy weather at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, October 5. The crowd of 41,467 saw Yankee right-hander Waite Hoyt (22‚Äì6, 2.64 ERA) and Pirate ace Ray Kremer (19‚Äì8, 2.47 ERA) oppose each other in Game 1\\\\. The Governor of Pennsylvania, John S. Fisher was at Forbes Field, as well as New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis was seated near the Yankees' dugout. National League President John A. Heydler was in another field box. Adding to the festivities was a brass band in red coats that paraded around the field before the game. The photographers took pictures of Pirates' Manager Donie Bush and the Yankees' Miller Huggins shaking hands. The Babe was photographed with Huggins, Bush, Mayor Walker, Lou Gehrig, and the Waners. When the game started, Earle Combs hit the first ball Kremer threw and drove it deep to left field, where Clyde Barnhart caught it. After Mark Koenig struck out swinging, Babe Ruth came up. He swung at the first ball and singled to right field for the first hit of the series. Then on a count of three and two, Gehrig hit a short fly to right field. Paul Waner tried to make a shoestring catch, but the ball got through him for a triple and Ruth scored. In the bottom of the first, the Pirates tied the game at one. Lloyd Waner was hit by a pitch, moved to third on his brother's double, and tagged up on Glenn Wright's sacrifice fly. With one out in the third, second baseman George Grantham kicked Koenig's grounder behind first base for an error. Ruth again hit Kremer's first pitch and smashed a single to right, sending Koenig to third. Gehrig walked. With the bases loaded, Kremer walked Bob Meusel, forcing home Koenig. Tony Lazzeri then grounded to Wright, who got the ball to second in time to force Meusel, but Grantham could not get rid of it in time to complete a double play. Ruth scored. With Gehrig on third and Lazzeri on first, a double steal was attempted. Catcher Earl Smith made a bluff throw to second and then threw to Pie Traynor at third, catching Gehrig halfway between the bases, but Smith let Traynor's return throw to the plate get past him for an error. Gehrig scored. The Yankees led 4‚Äì1. The Pirates picked up one run in the bottom of the third on Kremer's double and Paul Waner's single, making the score 4‚Äì2. After Hoyt developed a blister on a finger of his pitching hand in the fourth, Huggins watched him carefully. Koenig doubled to center in the fifth and went to third when Ruth grounded out to Grantham. Gehrig's sacrifice fly to Paul Waner scored Koenig. The Pirates came back with one run in the bottom of the inning on Lloyd Waner's double and Barnhart's single to left. After Lazzeri doubled in the sixth, Pirates Manager Donie Bush lifted Kremer and brought in right-hander Johnny Miljus, who retired the side. Pittsburgh came up in the eighth trailing 5‚Äì3. Wright lined a single over Lazzeri's head. Then Traynor lined a single to center. Wright stopped at second. Huggins decided that Hoyt had had enough and called for Wilcy Moore. Grantham grounded to Gehrig who threw to Koenig in time to force Traynor at second. On the play, Koenig was bowled over and had the air knocked out of him. Wright went to third on the play and scored on Joe Harris's single to center, making the score 5‚Äì4. On a daring run and long slide, Grantham beat Combs's throw to third. Smith then grounded to Gehrig, who stepped on first to end the inning. Moore retired the Pirates in order in the ninth. The Yankees won Game 1 of the World Series, 5‚Äì4. Game 2 41,634 were in attendance for Game 2\\\\. The Pirates opened the scoring in the bottom of the first. Lloyd Waner tripled down the left field foul line, and Clyde Barnhart drove Ruth up against the concrete wall in right on his sacrifice fly scoring Waner. The Pirates led 1‚Äì0. In the top of the third, Combs singled between Harris and Grantham and raced to third on Koenig's line single over second, scoring on Lloyd Waner's fumble sending Koenig around to third. Ruth's high sacrifice fly to Lloyd Waner scored Koenig. Gehrig doubled to the exit gate in right-center. Wright then made an acrobatic diving stop of Meusel's drive headed for left field but couldn't regain his balance in time to throw Meusel out, Gehrig reaching third base and scoring on Lazzeri's sacrifice fly to Paul Waner. The Yankees led 3‚Äì1. Pipgras pitched beautifully, with a blazing fastball and a sharp-breaking curve, scattering six hits over seven innings. In the top of the eighth, Meusel singled over second. On a hit-and-run play, Lazzeri singled to right, Meusel racing to third. When Aldridge's wild pitch almost knocked Dugan down, Meusel scored and Lazzeri went to second. Dugan attempted a sacrifice bunt, but catcher Johnny Gooch pounced on the ball and threw to third base to get Lazzeri sliding in. Aldridge then walked Benny Bengough and Pipgras, and southpaw Mike Cvengros relieved him. He hit Combs forcing in Dugan, and gave up a single to Koenig scoring Bengough. The Yankees led 6‚Äì1, and held on to win 6‚Äì2. Game 3 The Series moved to New York for Game 3 without a travel day off. Starter Herb Pennock retired leadoff hitter Lloyd Waner on an easy roller to Koenig. Rhyne and Paul Waner both flied to Meusel in left. With the Yankees up in the first, on a count of two and two, leadoff hitter Combs slapped a single over second. Koenig got an infield hit on a ground ball that bounced off starter Lee Meadows' glove and was kicked around by Rhyne, Combs reaching second. After Ruth popped to Wright behind second, Gehrig got hold of a fastball and drove it to the warning track in left-center for a triple scoring both Combs and Koenig, but was thrown out at the plate trying for an inside-the-park home run. The Yankees led 2‚Äì0. Pennock was in total control. He retired the Pirates in order without a hit over the first seven innings. Lazzeri opened the home half of the seventh with a single into short center, only the fifth hit of the game, all by the Yanks. Dugan bunted him to second and beat the throw to first. Huggins sent up Cedric Durst to bat for Grabowski. His grounder moved Lazzeri to third and Dugan to second. Rhyne fielded Pennock's slow grounder but threw to the plate too late to get Lazzeri, Dugan taking third and Pennock reaching first. Koenig's deep double to right wall scored Pennock and put Combs on third. Lefthander Mike Cvengros relieved Meadows, but Ruth crushed a home run high into the right-field bleachers, the crowd cheering wildly as he trotted around the bases behind Combs and Koenig. The inning finally ended when Cvengros struck out Gehrig and Meusel. The Yankees led 8‚Äì0, and held on for an 8‚Äì1 win. Pennock finished with a three-hitter, walking none. Game 4 Looking to become the manager of the first American League club to sweep a World Series in four straight games, Huggins sent Wilcy Moore to the mound against the Pirates' Carmen Hill for Game 4\\\\. Lloyd Waner led off the game with a drive off Moore's glove and beat it out for a hit. Koenig threw out Barnhart, sending Little Poison to second. Wright singled to right, scoring Waner. The Yanks tied the game at one in the bottom of the first when the first three hitters, Combs, Koenig and Ruth, all singled to right. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Combs singled to short center. Koenig struck out swinging but Ruth hit his second home run of the Series, to deep center. The Yankees led 3‚Äì1. In the top of the seventh inning, Smith would have grounded out third to first base, but Moore dropped Gehrig's toss for an error. Pitcher Emil Yde ran for Smith, and Fred Brickell batted for Hill. Lazzeri, in his haste to make a double play on Brickell's grounder, bobbled the ball and both runners reached, Yde taking second and Brickell making it to first. Lloyd Waner's sacrifice bunt moved them up. Barnhart's single over second scored Yde and sent Brickell to third. Paul Waner's sacrifice fly to center scored Brickell, tying the score at three apiece. There was a new battery for the Pirates in the bottom of the seventh, Johnny Miljus and catcher Johnny Gooch. The score remained tied through the seventh, the eighth and the top of the ninth, bringing the Yanks up in their half of the ninth with a chance to win the game and the series. Miljus opened with a walk to Combs. Koenig beat out a bunt down the third base line for a single, bringing Ruth up. Miljus' wild pitch sent Combs to third and Koenig to second, and manager Bush ordered Miljus to walk Ruth, loading the bases for Gehrig, who struck out swinging as did Meusel looking. Lazzeri fouled deep into the left field bleachers for strike one, but on the next pitch Miljus uncorked another wild pitch. Combs raced home with the winning run, and the Series was over with the Yankees winning 4‚Äì3. To date, this is the only World Series to end with a runner scoring on a wild pitch.

The label was set up and operated by Saul Galpern, who had previously worked with artists such as Simply Red, The Fall, Julian Cope, The Triffids, The Slits and Au Pairs. The label filed for voluntary liquidation in December 2001, before it was re-established by Galpern in 2016. History The label's first success was with Suede, whose debut album, Suede (1993), debuted at the top of the UK Albums Chart, and was the fastest-selling debut album since Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Welcome to the Pleasuredome almost ten years earlier.Bella, Todd. \\"Interview with Brett Anderson\\".

This was the first time a team had swept consecutive Series. Babe Ruth hit .625 (10 for 16) as the Yankees outscored their opponents by a combined score of 27‚Äì10. As he had done against the Cards in the Series, Ruth hit three home runs over the right field pavilion in Sportsman's Park in Game 4, the only player to do it in two different World Series through the 2016 season. Unlike 1926, however, it occurred in the final game of a Series won by the Yanks and finished off their two consecutive World Series sweeps. Lou Gehrig also had a good Series, hitting .545 (6 for 11) with four home runs. He drove in as many runs by himself (9) as the entire Cardinal team combined. Bill McKechnie became the second manager to lead two different teams to the World Series, and like Pat Moran before him, won one and lost one.  Background  Before the series started, Walter Johnson, a retired Major League pitcher at the time, reportedly predicted that the Cardinals would \\"make short work of the New York Yankees,\\" and that the Yankees \\"(hadn't) looked good for a while.\\" Both Cardinals and Yankees fans were looking forward to a rematch of the 1926 World Series, which the Cardinals won. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 In a fashion similar to 1926, Bill Sherdel took the mound in Game 1 for the Cardinals. Ruth doubled with 2 outs in the first inning. Gehrig followed with an RBI double. Ruth lashed another double in the fourth and scored ahead of Bob Meusel's home run, one of only four hits off Sherdel in his seven innings. Consecutive singles by Mark Koenig, Ruth and Gehrig-for his second RBI-against Cards reliever Syl Johnson gave the Yankees the 4th run and a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 The Cardinals produced 30 percent (3) of their runs in the Series in the second inning of game 2. George Harper walked, Jimmie Wilson doubled, Rabbit Maranville singled, and Grover Cleveland Alexander reached on second baseman Tony Lazzeri's errant throw. It tied the game at 3‚Äì3. After that, George Pipgras allowed only two more Cardinal hits, walking 3 other St. Louis batters. Miller Huggins had helped him straighten out a delivery problem. Pipgras consistently struck out the Cardinals with his curveballs, and they didn't score again. New York went ahead 4‚Äì3 in the bottom of the second inning off Alexander, who did not do well after that. Ruth led off with a single. Gehrig, having homered earlier (in the first inning to give the Yankees a 3‚Äì0 lead), drew a walk, and Meusel drove in a run with a double. A hit batsman and another run-scoring hit gave the Yankees a 4-run lead, and that was how it ended. Game 3 The Redbirds, as the Cardinals were affectionately called by fans, led only 3 times the entire series and held an advantage in this game for 3 innings, the longest span in the series. They put up a 2‚Äì0 score in the 1st inning on singles by Andy High and Frankie Frisch, followed by a line drive that center fielder Cedric Durst couldn't catch, giving Jim Bottomley a 2-run double. The only other St. Louis run came in the 5th inning, when Taylor Douthit was hit by a pitch and scored to make it a 3‚Äì3 game on High's double. Where the Cardinals had to scrape together runs, the Yankees did not. Gehrig homered into the right-field pavilion. In the fourth inning, Ruth laced a single and Gehrig followed with a hard line drive that skipped over the head of charging fielder Douthit. The ball rolled to the fence, and Gehrig went around the bases for a two-run inside-the-park homer. Ruth took to the bases again in the sixth inning when his grounder forced out Koenig. Gehrig then drew a walk. 3rd baseman High fielded Meusel's bouncer and tried to start a double play. His throw got Gehrig at second, but Frisch's relay went wild and rolled to the fence. As Bottomley scampered after the ball, Ruth rounded third base and headed for home. The throw beat him, and umpire Bill McGowan called him out, but the impact from Ruth's hit in the collision jarred the ball loose from catcher Jimmie Wilson, and McGowan changed the call. Later in the inning, Meusel scored on a double steal. The Yankees scored another run that inning to make it 6‚Äì3. Another run in the seventh was their last of the game, making it 7-3. Game 4 After Game 3, Cardinals manager Bill McKechnie was still hopeful, despite losing 3 games in a row. \\"It[sic] they can win three games, so can we. Nothing is impossible. And this thing isn‚Äôt over until the fourth game is won,\\" he was quoted as saying. The Cards led 2‚Äì1 in the top of the seventh. 21-game-winning southpaw Will Sherdel had an 0‚Äì2 count on Babe Ruth, who turned to say something to catcher Earl Smith. Seizing what he thought was a great opportunity to end the at-bat, Sherdel \\"quick-pitched,\\" or threw without a windup, for what he thought was strike three on the Babe. \\"Quick pitches\\" were legal in the National League, but not in the American League or the World Series. So NL plate umpire Cy Pfirman called \\"no pitch,\\" causing a vociferous argument with the Cardinals. Ruth then took two balls to even the count at 2‚Äì2 before homering to tie the game at two apiece. Gehrig's ensuing back-to-back home run, his fourth of the Series, gave the Yanks a lead they never relinquished. They scored twice more in the seventh, and Ruth finished the inning off with his third homer of the game in the two-run Yankee eighth.This was Ruth's second three home run game in the World Series, following Game 4 of the 1926 World Series and he was, , the only player to hit three home runs in two World Series games. St. Louis scored a lone run in the bottom of the ninth to make it 7‚Äì3, but that was their last, as future Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch hit a left field foul fly caught on the run by none other than the Babe Ruth up against the stands, as angry Cardinal fans swatted him with newspapers and programs. But Ruth merely kept running right into the dugout, holding the ball in the air and giving the Yankees their second straight World Series sweep. In 1930, Ruth called this game the biggest thrill of his career. Composite line score 1928 World Series (4‚Äì0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)

The Athletics defeated the Cubs in five games to win the Series. This Series featured the Athletics \\"Mack Attack\\" (so called in honor of longtime A's owner-manager Connie Mack), in which they overcame an eight-run deficit by scoring 10 runs in the home half of the seventh in Game 4 (before two strikeouts by Pat Malone ended it) to gain a 10‚Äì8 victory which ensured the Series didn't even out at two games won apiece. The Athletics were further exalted in the middle of the \\"Mack Attack\\" when Cub's center fielder Hack Wilson lost Mule Haas's fly ball in the sun for a fluke three-run inside-the- park home run, bringing the A's to within a run at 8‚Äì7. It was the last occurrence of an inside-the-park home run in a World Series game until Game 1 of the 2015 World Series.  Background  Because seven of the eight regulars in the Cubs' lineup hit right-handed (except for first baseman Charlie Grimm), Mack started only right-handed pitchers and kept all his left-handed pitchers in the bullpen even though two of his best starters, 300-game-winner-to-be Lefty Grove and Rube Walberg, were left-handed. Accordingly, Game 1 will be remembered mostly for the surprise start of aging A's pitcher Howard Ehmke, whose record 13 strikeouts in a complete game 3‚Äì1 win beat \\"Big\\" Ed Walsh's Series record by one, and stood until Carl Erskine broke it by one in . Ehmke went on to start Game 5 but failed to get out of the fourth inning, the bullpen and a ninth-inning A's come-from-behind walk-off rally bailing him out. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 This was the first World Series game ever played at Wrigley Field. The 35-year-old Ehmke's first-game appearance was no sentimental move by Mack even though he was considered \\"over the hill\\", having won only seven games for the slugging A's, pitched only two complete games and worked a scant 55 innings in the regular season. Mack chose Ehmke over Grove or George Earnshaw because he thought Ehmke's pitching technique would surprise the hard-hitting Cubs, and that his sidearm delivery would make it hard for them to pick up the ball against the white-shirted \\"bleacher bums\\" of Wrigley Field. He proved his shrewd manager right, striking out 13 Cubs for a Series record that would stand until . Mack had rested Howard's arm by sending him to scout the Cubs for the last few weeks of the season, with both the A's and Cubs far ahead in their respective standings. Attending Game 1 was 9-year-old John Paul Stevens, who would grow up to become a Supreme Court Justice. A lifelong Cub fan, Stevens later said, \\"And that was my first game, a tragic game for a young boy to go and see in person!\\" (sidebar: Diehard Cubs Fan) Game 2 Jimmie Foxx became the first player to homer in his first two World Series games. Simmons also homered and had four RBI's. The A's now had a 2-0 lead in the series. Game 3 President Herbert Hoover attends a game at Shibe Park Game 3 was a pitcher's duel. It also featured many tense moments. Guy Bush won this game for the Cubs only victory, holding the A's to one run despite allowing nine hits and two walks. Game 4 Sticking to his right-handed-pitchers-only policy, Mack again made a risky move in Game 4 by starting 46-year-old Jack Quinn. Unlike Ehmke, however, Quinn was no challenge to the Cubs hitters, who hit 7 runs off him before Mack pulled him in the sixth inning, setting the stage for the \\"Mack Attack\\" in the bottom of the seventh. After Wilson's miscue on Haas's hit, an unknown fan wrote new lyrics to \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\", beginning with \\"The sun shone bright into poor Hack Wilson's eyes...\\" and ending \\"For we'll sing one song for the game and fighting Cubs, for the record whiffing Cubs far away.\\"Chicago Tribune, October 13, 1929. Sec. 2, p. 2. After seeing his seemingly safe 8‚Äì0 lead disintegrate to a 10‚Äì8 loss after the A's record seventh and a scoreless last two innings, Cub manager Joe McCarthy was anything but jovial. When a boy came by after the game asking for a baseball, \\"Marse Joe\\" muttered, \\"Come back tomorrow and stand behind Wilson, and you'll be able to pick up all the balls you want!\\"Baseball's Greatest Managers, 1961 That eight-run deficit overcome by the A's on that Columbus Day in Philadelphia is still the largest in playoff history through the 2016 season, and Mule Haas's 7th inning inside-the-park home run was the last in a World Series game for 86 years. Art Nehf's relief pitching appearance in this game was his last in the Major Leagues. Game 5 Mack gave Ehmke his second start of the Series, but without the advantage of surprise and without the white shirts in Wrigley's bleachers he was ineffective, touched for two runs and taken out in the fourth inning. The A's rallied for their only three runs in the bottom of the ninth to come from behind for the second time in the series and win it at home, 3‚Äì2. Haas suddenly tied the game up with a two-run homer; and after a double by Al Simmons and an intentional walk to Jimmie Foxx, Bing Miller's double scored Simmons to give the A's their first World Series Championship in 16 years.

Although most World Series have been of the best-of-seven format, the 1919 World Series was a best-of-nine series (along with , , and ). Baseball decided to try the best- of-nine format partly to increase popularity of the sport and partly to generate more revenue. The events of the series are often associated with the Black Sox Scandal, when several members of the Chicago franchise conspired with gamblers, allegedly led by Arnold Rothstein, to throw the World Series games. The 1919 World Series was the last World Series to take place without a Commissioner of Baseball in place. In 1920, the various franchise owners installed Kenesaw Mountain Landis as the first \\"Commissioner of Baseball.\\" The Baseball Writers' Association of the America has since distanced themselves from Landis, as they removed his name from the league's MVP trophy. In August 1921, despite being acquitted from criminal charges, eight players from the White Sox were banned from organized baseball for fixing the series (or having knowledge about the fix). The Teams=The Chicago White Sox In 1917, the Sox won the World Series and, managed by William \\"Kid\\" Gleason, the 1919 Chicago White Sox had the best record in the American League. Team owner Charlie Comiskey had succeeded in building one of the most powerful teams in baseball. Most of the same players had defeated the New York Giants in the 1917 World Series, four games to two. They had fallen to sixth place in the American League in 1918, largely as a result of losing their best player, Shoeless Joe Jackson, and a few of his teammates as well, to World War I service. Comiskey fired manager Pants Rowland after the season, replacing him with Kid Gleason, who had played over 20 years in the majors but had never managed before. The 88‚Äì52 White Sox won the American League pennant again in 1919, by games over the Cleveland Indians (world champions the following year). Joe Jackson Jackson was the unquestioned star of the team. The left fielder hit .351 that season, fourth in the league and in the AL's top five in slugging percentage, RBI, total bases and base hits. He was not the only star in a lineup with hardly a weak spot, as former A's superstar leadoff hitter Eddie Collins, one of the greatest second basemen of all time,James, Bill. The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract (2001). was still going strong in his early thirties, hitting .319 with a .400 on-base percentage. Right fielder Nemo Leibold hit .302 with 81 runs scored. First baseman Chick Gandil hit .290, third baseman Buck Weaver .296, and center fielder Oscar \\"Hap\\" Felsch hit .275 and tied Jackson for the team lead in home runs with only 7 (as the dead-ball era was coming to a close). Even typical \\"good field, no hit\\" catcher Ray Schalk hit .282 that year, and shortstop Swede Risberg was not an automatic out with the .256 average and 38 RBI. Manager Gleason's bench contained two impressive hitters, outfielder Shano Collins and infielder Fred McMullin, both veterans of the 1917 world championship. The 1919 pennant- winning pitching staff was led by a pair of aces and a very promising rookie. Knuckleballer Eddie Cicotte had become one of the AL's best pitchers after turning 30 and discovering the \\"shine ball;\\" he had won 28 games for the 1917 champions, and after an off-year in 1918 had come back with a hefty 29‚Äì7, leading the league in wins and second in earned run average to Washington's veteran \\"Big Train\\" Walter Johnson. Next came Claude \\"Lefty\\" Williams, at 23‚Äì11 and 2.64. Twenty-six-year-old rookie Dickie Kerr started only 17 games, but turned in a solid 13‚Äì7 and 2.88. Fourth in the rotation was Urban \\"Red\\" Faber, who had beaten the Giants three times in the 1917 World Series but had an off-year in 1919 at 11‚Äì9 and 3.83 in 20 starts. He was ill and unable to pitch in the Series, limiting Gleason to three top-of-the-line starters for what could be nine games. However, all was not well in the White Sox camp. Tension between many of the players and owner Comiskey was quite high, given his penny-pinching ways memorialized in two urban legends: (1) that he told Gleason to shut down Cicotte in the last days of the regular season to prevent him from winning 30 games, a milestone which would have earned him a sizeable $10,000 bonus; (2) that many derided the White Sox as the Black Sox because Comiskey wouldn't pay to have their uniforms laundered regularly, and they became blacker and blacker due to accumulated sweat, grime, and dirt. The Cincinnati Reds In contrast to the White Sox, the 1919 Cincinnati Reds were upstarts. They had finished no higher than third since 1900, and then only twice, before winning the NL pennant handily in 1919. Under new manager Pat Moran, best known as the leader of another bunch of unlikely newcomers to the World Series, the 1915 Philadelphia Phillies, the Reds finished nine games in front of the runner-up New York Giants at 96‚Äì44 and at least 20 games ahead of the other six, with the second highest NL won-lost percentage since 1910 at .686. Edd Roush Their greatest star was center fielder Edd Roush, who led the league in hitting at .321 and, like the White Sox's Jackson, was in the top five of their respective leagues in most important hitting categories. Third baseman Heinie Groh was the other great hitter on the team at .310 with a .392 on-base percentage and 79 runs scored. Slick-fielding first baseman Jake Daubert, a two-time National League batting champion with Brooklyn earlier in the decade, also scored 79 runs and hit .276, while catcher Ivey Wingo hit .273. The rest of the team was unheralded, including second baseman Morrie Rath, a .264 hitter with no power but a good on-base percentage, and shortstop Larry Kopf, a .270 singles hitter. The corner outfielders were decidedly weaker hitters, with former Phillies star left fielder Sherry Magee's .215 in 56 games and right fielder Earle \\"Greasy\\" Neale's .242 with little power. This would prompt Moran to start rookie Pat Duncan in left field in the World Series. The Reds' pitching was universally solid, however. The team's big three included Hod Eller (20‚Äì9, 2.39), Dutch Ruether (19‚Äì6, 1.82) and Slim Sallee (21‚Äì7, 2.06), all among the league leaders in various categories. They were backed by three other pitchers who were almost as successful: Jimmy Ring at only 10‚Äì9 but 2.26, Ray Fisher at 14‚Äì5 and 2.17 with five shutouts, and Cuban Dolf Luque at 10‚Äì3 and 2.63, former and future Giant who would win the last game of the 1933 World Series in long relief for New York. It was a deep and talented staff, a definite advantage in a Series whose format had just been changed from best of seven to best of nine. The Fix The conspirators got an unexpected assist when flu-stricken Faber was left off the World Series roster. Indeed, years later catcher Schalk said that had Faber been healthy, there never would have been a fix (since he almost certainly would have gotten starts that went to Cicotte and/or Williams). Despite their many wins on the field, the White Sox were an unhappy team. Many observers believe that it was Comiskey's stinginess that is largely to blame for the Black Sox scandal despite the fact that the 1919 White Sox payroll was third highest in the American League behind only Boston and New York. Stories of the \\"Black Sox\\" scandal have usually included Comiskey in its gallery of subsidiary villains, focusing in particular on his intentions regarding a clause in Cicotte's contract that would have paid Cicotte an additional $10,000 bonus for winning 30 games. According to Eliot Asinof's account of the events, Eight Men Out, Cicotte was \\"rested\\" for the season's final two weeks after reaching his 29th win presumably to deny him the bonus, but the truth may be more complex. Cicotte won his 29th game on September 19, had an ineffective start on September 24 and was pulled after a few innings in a tuneup on the season's final day, September 28 (three days before the Series opener). In addition, Cicotte reportedly agreed to the fix the same day he won his 29th game before he could have known of any efforts to deny him a chance to win his 30th. The story was probably true with regard to the 1917 season, however, when Cicotte won 28 games and hurled the White Sox to the world championship. Although rumors were swirling among the gamblers (according to Tom Meany in his chapter on the 1919 Reds in \\"Baseball's Greatest Teams,\\" \\"Cincinnati money was pouring in\\" even though the White Sox were regarded as the overwhelming favorite) and some of the press, most fans and observers were taking the Series at face value. On October 2, the day of Game 2, the Philadelphia Bulletin published a poem which would quickly prove to be ironic: :Still, it really doesn't matter, :After all, who wins the flag. :Good clean sport is what we're after, :And we aim to make our brag :To each near or distant nation :Whereon shines the sporting sun :That of all our games gymnastic :Base ball is the cleanest one! Summary right Matchups=Game 1 Eddie Cicotte The first game began at 3 pm at Cincinnati's Redland Field, with 30,511 fans in the stands and ticket scalpers outside the park raking in at least $50 per ticket. Chicago failed to score in the top of the first. In the bottom of the inning, Cicotte (who was paid his $10,000 the night before the series began) took the mound and hit the leadoff hitter, Morrie Rath, in the back with his second pitch, a prearranged signal to Arnold Rothstein that the fix was on. Even so, the game remained close for a while, due in part to some excellent defense from the conspirators, seeking to deflect suspicion from themselves. In the fourth, however, Cicotte \\"went haywire\\" (again according to Meany, op. cit.), allowing a number of hits in succession climaxed by a two-out triple to the opposing pitcher, as the Reds scored five times to break a 1‚Äì1 tie. Cicotte was relieved at that point, but the damage was done and the Reds went on to add three more runs in later innings and win 9‚Äì1. Sportswriters thought that a bad throw by Cicotte to Risberg in the fourth inning, which prevented a possible double play, was suspicious. By that evening, there already were signs that things were going wrong. Only Cicotte, who had shrewdly demanded his $10,000 in advance, had been paid. \\"Sleepy\\" Bill Burns and Maharg met with Abe Attell, the former world boxing champ and Rothstein's intermediary, but he withheld the next installment ($20,000) nonetheless to bet on the next game. The next morning Gandil met Attell and again demanded money, but again to no avail. Game 2 Although they had not received their money, the players were still willing to go through with the fix. \\"Lefty\\" Williams, the starting pitcher in Game 2, was not going to be as obvious as Cicotte. After a shaky start, he pitched well until the fourth inning, when he walked three and gave up as many runs. After that he became virtually unhittable again, giving up only one more run; but lack of clutch-hitting, with Gandil a particularly guilty party, led to a 4‚Äì2 White Sox loss. Attell was still in no mood to pay up afterwards, but Burns managed to get hold of $10,000 and gave it to Gandil, who distributed it among the conspirators. The teams headed northwest to Comiskey Park in Chicago for Game 3 the next day, with no days off for travel in this Series. Game 3 Rookie pitcher Dickie Kerr, the Game 3 starter for the Sox, was not in on the fix. The original plan was for the conspirators, who disliked Kerr, to lose this game; but by now dissent among the players meant that the plan was in disarray. Burns still had faith and gathered the last of his resources to bet on Cincinnati. It was a decision that would leave him broke, as Chicago scored early‚ÄîGandil himself driving in two runs‚Äîand Kerr was masterful, holding the Reds to three hits in a 3‚Äì0 complete game shutout. Game 4 Cicotte, the Game 4 White Sox starter, was determined not to look as bad as he had in Game 1. For the first four innings, he and Reds pitcher Jimmy Ring matched zeroes. With one out in the fifth, Cicotte fielded a slow roller by Pat Duncan but threw wildly to first for a two-base error. The next man up, Larry Kopf, singled to left; Cicotte cut off the throw from Jackson and fumbled the ball, allowing Duncan to score. The home crowd was stunned by the veteran pitcher's obvious mistake. When he then gave up a double to Greasy Neale scoring Kopf to make it 2‚Äì0, that was enough of a lead for Ring, who threw a three-hit shutout of his own matching Kerr's in Game 3. The Reds led the Series 3‚Äì1. After the game \\"Sport\\" Sullivan came through with $20,000 for the players, which Gandil split equally among Risberg, Felsch, and Williams, who was due to start Game 5 the next day. Game 5 Game 5 was postponed by rain for a day. Both starters, Williams and Cincinnati's Hod Eller, pitched excellently at first, with neither allowing a runner past first until the top of the sixth, when Eller himself hit a blooper that fell between Felsch and Jackson. Felsch's throw was off- line, sending Eller all the way to third. Leadoff hitter Morrie Rath hit a single over the drawn-in infield, scoring Eller. Heinie Groh walked before Edd Roush's double‚Äîthe result of more doubtful defense from Felsch‚Äîbrought home two more runs, with Roush scoring shortly thereafter. Eller pitched well enough (he struck out nine batters, including a then-World Series record six in a row, since tied by Moe Drabowsky in the 1966 World Series opener) for the four runs to stand up, and the Reds were only one game away from their first world championship. Game 6 The Series reverted to Cincinnati for Game 6. Dickie Kerr, starting for the White Sox, was less dominant than in Game 3. Aided and abetted by three errors, the Reds jumped out to a 4‚Äì0 lead before Chicago fought back, tying the game at 4 in the sixth, which remained the score into extra innings. In the top of the tenth, Gandil drove in Weaver to make it 5‚Äì4, and Kerr closed it out to record his ‚Äî and Chicago's ‚Äî second win. Game 7 Despite the rumors already circulating about Cicotte's erratic performances in Games 1 and 4, White Sox manager Kid Gleason showed faith in his ace for Game 7. This time, the knuckleballer did not let him down. Chicago scored early and, for once, it was Cincinnati that committed errors. The Reds threatened only briefly in the sixth before losing 4‚Äì1, and suddenly the Series was relatively close again. This marked the only time in World Series history that the winner of Game 7 did not ultimately go on to win the series. This did not go unnoticed by Sullivan and Rothstein, who were suddenly worried. Before the Series started, the Sox had been strong favorites and few doubted they could win two games in a row‚Äîpresuming that they were trying to win. Rothstein had been too smart to bet on individual games, but had $270,000 riding on Cincinnati to win the Series. The night before Game 8, Williams‚Äîthe scheduled starter‚Äîwas supposedly visited by an associate of Sullivan's known as Harry F who left no doubt that if he failed to blow the game in the first inning, he and his wife would be in serious danger. Game 8 Whatever Williams had been told made its impression. In the first, throwing nothing but mediocre fastballs, he gave up four straight one-out hits for three runs before Gleason relieved him with \\"Big\\" Bill James, who allowed one of Williams' baserunners to score. James continued ineffective and, although the Sox rallied in the eighth, the Reds came away with a 10‚Äì5 victory for a five-games-to-three Series win. Jackson hit the only homer of the Series in the third inning after the Reds had built a 5‚Äì0 lead. Immediately after the Series ended, rumors were rife from coast to coast that the games had been thrown. Journalist Hugh Fullerton of the Chicago Herald and Examiner, disgusted by the display of ineptitude with which the White Sox had \\"thrown\\" the series, wrote that no World Series should ever be played again. Composite line score 1919 World Series (5‚Äì3): Cincinnati Reds (N.L.) over Chicago White Sox (A.L.) Notable performances Jackson led all players with his .375 average. Some believed that most of his offensive potency came in games that were not fixed and/or when the game seemed out of reach. He hit the Series' lone home run in the eighth and final game, a solo shot in the third inning, by which time the Reds were already ahead 5‚Äì0. His five hits with runners in scoring position came in: Game 6, sixth inning with Kerr pitching; Game 7, first and third innings; Game 8, two in the four-run eighth.

The Athletics defeated the Cardinals in six games, 4‚Äì2. Philly's pitching ace Lefty Grove, and George Earnshaw, No. 2 man in Mr. Mack's rotation, won two games apiece. Earnshaw also pitched seven scoreless innings as Game 5 starter, but ended up with a no-decision as Grove relieved him in the eighth and took the win on Jimmie Foxx's two-run homer in the top of the ninth for the game's only scoring. The Cardinals led the National League in runs scored and averaged six runs per game in the regular season, but could manage only two runs per game in this World Series. This was the Athletics' fifth World Series championship win (following , , and ), and their last in Philadelphia before moving to Kansas City in 1955 and then Oakland in 1968‚Äîwhere they have since won four more World Series titles (, , , and ). Their win this year tied them with the Boston Red Sox for most World Series wins as of that point (five) until , when the New York Yankees surged ahead of both in World Series wins and have gone on to amass 27 World Series championships as of 2020. The city of Philadelphia would have to wait 50 years until its next World Series championship, when the Phillies defeated the Kansas City Royals and thus became the last of the \\"Original Sixteen\\" MLB franchises to accomplish the feat. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 The A's managed only five hits off of Grimes in Game 1, but all were for extra bases and each produced a run in five different innings. Al Simmons and Mickey Cochrane hit solo home runs for the A's, helping Lefty Grove to a 5‚Äì2 win. The A's struck first in the bottom of the second when Jimmie Foxx tripled and scored on Bing Miller's sacrifice fly. The Cardinals loaded the bases in the third on three straight leadoff singles, then Taylor Douthit's lineout and Sparky Adams's sacrifice fly scored a run each. Simmons's home run in the fourth tied the game. In the sixth, Max Bishop walked with one out and scored on Foxx's double. Next inning, Mule Haas tripled with one out and scored on Joe Boley's groundout. Cochrane's eighth inning home run gave the A's their last run of the game. Game 2 George Earnshaw allowed six hits and walked one, putting the A's ahead 2‚Äì0. The Athletics scored six runs in the first four innings to put the game out of reach. Mickey Cochrane's two-out home run in the first gave the A's their first run. After Al Simmons singled, Jimmie Foxx's RBI double made it 2‚Äì0 A's. George Watkins's home run in the second gave the Cardinals their only run of the game. In the third, Cochrane reached on an error and scored on Simmons's double. After an intentional walk, Bing Miller's RBI single made it 4‚Äì1 A's. Philadelphia added two more runs next inning on Jimmy Dykes's double. Game 3 After the A's loaded the bases in the top of the first, Hallahan settled down and pitched a shutout. Philadelphia left a total of 11 men on base. The Cardinals scored the game's first run on Taylor Douthit's home run in the fourth, then next inning hit three consecutive one-out singles, the last of which by Charlie Gelbert scoring a run. In the seventh, Bill Shores allowed three consecutive leadoff singles, the last of which by Jimmie Wilson scoring two runs. Next inning, the Cardinals added another run off of Jack Quinn on back-to-back one-out doubles by Jim Bottomley and Chick Hafey. Game 4 An error by Jimmy Dykes in the fourth inning allowed the Cardinals to score two runs. Haines did not allow a hit after the third inning. The A's got on the board in the first on Al Simmons's RBI single, but the Cardinals tied the game in the third when Charlie Gelbert tripled and scored on Jesse Haines's single. In the fourth, Chick Hafey hit a two-out ground rule double and scored on Dykes's error on Ray Blades's ground ball. Blades then scored on Gelbert's RBI single. Game 5 George Earnshaw dueled Burleigh Grimes 0‚Äì0 through seven innings before Lefty Grove took over for Earnshaw in the eighth. In the top of the ninth, Grimes walked Mickey Cochrane and then coughed up a home run ball to Jimmie Foxx. It must have been a patented Foxx blast, for Grimes said later, \\"he hit it so hard I couldn't feel sorry for myself.\\" Game 6 Earnshaw earned his second win on just one day of rest, pitching a five-hitter; it would be 88 years before another pitcher would start consecutive games in the postseason. Just like in Game 1, the A's seven hits came in five different innings, leading to two runs in the first and fourth innings, and single runs in the third, fifth, and sixth innings. As in Game 1, all the A's hits were extra- base hits, including home runs by Al Simmons and Jimmy Dykes. Although the A's hit only .197 (35‚Äìfor‚Äì178) in the six game set, 18 of their hits went for extra bases, outscoring the Cardinals, 21‚Äì12. St. Louis only managed a .200 batting average in the series. The A's struck first in the first on RBI doubles by Mickey Cochrane and Bing Miller, both after walks. Simmon's home run in the third off of Syl Johnson made it 3‚Äì0 A's, then Dykes's home run after a walk in the fourth increased their lead to 5‚Äì0. The A's added to their lead next inning when Jimmie Foxx hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a bunt groundout and scored on Mule Haas's sacrifice fly. the A's scored their last run of the game in the sixth off of Jim Lindsey on Cochrane's sacrifice fly. The Cardinals scored their only run of the game on Chick Hafey's RBI double in the ninth. Composite line score 1930 World Series (4‚Äì2): Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)

Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or renewable resources, as well as those that, while recycled or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality. Natural building tends to rely on human labor, more than technology. As Michael G. Smith observes, it depends on \\"local ecology, geology and climate; on the character of the particular building site, and on the needs and personalities of the builders and users.\\"Smith, Michael G. \\"The Case for Natural Building,\\" in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek (2002), 6. The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the environmental impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort or health. To be more sustainable, natural building uses primarily abundantly available, renewable, reused or recycled materials. The use of rapidly renewable materials is increasingly a focus. In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the ecological footprint is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment and water reuse. Porch of a modern timber framed home Materials The materials common to many types of natural building are clay and sand. When mixed with water and, usually, straw or another fiber, the mixture may form cob or adobe (clay blocks). Other materials commonly used in natural building are: earth (as rammed earth or earth bag), wood (cordwood or timber frame/post-and-beam), straw, rice-hulls, bamboo and stone. A wide variety of reused or recycled non-toxic materials are common in natural building, including urbanite (salvaged chunks of used concrete), vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass. Other materials are avoided by practitioners of this building approach, due to their major negative environmental or health impacts. These include unsustainably harvested wood, toxic wood-preservatives, portland cement-based mixes and derived products such as Autoclaved aerated concrete, paints and other coatings that off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs), steel, waste materials such as rubber tires in regions where they are recycled, and some plastics; particularly polyvinyl chloride (PVC or \\"vinyl\\") and those containing harmful plasticizers or hormone-mimicking formulations. Techniques Many traditional techniques and materials are now experiencing a resurgence of popularity. This differs around the world based on climate appropriate building design and the availability of local materials. Adobe One of the oldest building methods, adobe is simply clay and sand mixed with water. Often, chopped straw or other fibers are added for strength. The mixture is then allowed to dry in the desired shape. Usually adobe is shaped into bricks that can be stacked to form walls. Various claims are made about the optimal proportions of clay and sand (or larger aggregate). Some say that the best adobe soil contains 15% - 30% clay to bind the material together. Others say equal proportions of clay and sand are best to prevent cracking or fragmenting of the bricks. The blocks can either be poured into molds and dried, or pressed into blocks. Adobe colored with clay and polished with natural oil makes an attractive and resilient floor. To protect the walls and reduce maintenance, adobe buildings usually have large overhanging eaves and sizeable foundations. Adobe can be plastered over with cob or lime-based mixes for both appearance and protection. Adobe has good thermal mass, meaning that it is slow to transmit heat or cold. It is not a good insulator, however, so insulation can be added (preferably on the outside), or a double wall built with airspace or insulation in between. The traditional thick, un-insulated adobe has proven to perform best in regions without harsh winters or where daily sun is predictably available during those cold periods. Cob A small cob building with a living roof The term cob is used to describe a monolithic building system based on a mixture of clay, sand, straw and earth. The construction uses no forms, bricks or wooden framework; it is built from the ground up. Various forms of \\"mud\\" building have been used in many parts of the world for centuries, under a variety of names, and date from at least 10,000 years ago. Cob building began use in England prior to the 13th century, and fell out of favor after World War I, although it is seeing a resurgence today. Cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available, though it is typically very labor-intensive. Cob's other great advantage is versatility; It can easily be shaped into any form. While cob building was falling out of favor in England by the late 19th century, thousands of cob structures have endured to the present (20,000 in Devon, England alone).Smith, Michael G. \\"Cob Building, Ancient and Modern,\\" in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek, (2002), 132-133. It is estimated that from one third to one half of the world's population lives in earthen dwellings today. Although typically associated with \\"low-rise\\" structures, in Yemen and other Middle-Eastern countries it has, for centuries, been used in \\"apartment\\" buildings of eight stories and more. Cob-like mixes are also used as plaster or filler in several methods of natural building, such as adobe, earth bags, timber frames, cordwood, and straw bales. Earth is thus a primary ingredient of natural building. Recently, a Cob Code was voted into the US International Residential Code (cobcode.org) Cordwood A section of a cordwood home Cordwood construction is a term used for a natural building method in which \\"cordwood\\" or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with masonry or cob mixtures to build a wall. The cordwood, thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a timber frame structure. Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods (e.g., rammed earth, cob or light clay) to produce attractive combinations. Cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high thermal mass, which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature. Earthbag Earth is the most typical fill material used in bag-wall construction techniques. This building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber (burlap) bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer, other than clay, to form footings, foundations, walls and even vaulted or domed roofs. In recent years, building with earth bags has become one of the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building. It facilitates self-contained, often free-form rammed-earth structures. Its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material (earth) in a potentially inexpensive building technique that is flexible, and easy to learn and use. However, because earth is a poor insulator, in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored, substituting pumice, rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth (see also Rice-hull bagwall construction).  Hempcrete  Hempcrete or Hemplime is a composite building material, a mixture of the chopped woody stem of the hemp plant known as hemp hurds (shives) and a lime based binder to create a material that can be cast into moulds. This forms a non-load-bearing 'breathable' insulating material that can be used to form walls, floor slabs, ceilings and roof insulationWilliam Stanwix and Alex Sparrow. The Hempcrete Book, Green Books, 2014, . (p. 23, 1st Edition).. It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre. Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the brittleness of concrete and consequently does not need expansion joints. The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass. Like other plant products, hemp absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere as it grows, retaining the carbon and releasing the oxygen. Theoretically 165 kg of carbon can be absorbed and locked up by 1 m3 of hempcrete wall during manufacture. Furthermore the carbonation of the lime during curing adds to this effect as lime turns to limestone. The typical compressive strength is around 1 MPa, around 1/20 that of residential grade concrete. It is a low density material and resistant to crack under movement thus making it highly suitable for use in earthquake-prone areas. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete's density is 15% that of traditional concrete. Rammed earth Rammed earth is a wall system made of compacted earth, or another material that is compacted.Pis√© terminology It is extremely strong and durable. Quality rammed earth walls are dense, solid, and stone-like with great environmental benefits and superior low maintenance characteristics. As an option depending on climate rigid insulation can be placed inside the wall. Similarly, depending on seismic concerns bamboo or other tensile natural materials can be used to reinforce the wall. Rammed earth has been used for around 10,000 years in all types of buildings from low rise to high-rise and from small huts to palaces. Rammed earth walls are formed in place by pounding damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel,sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10 inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms and pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years. Stone Stone has been used as a building material for thousands of years. It has long been recognized as a material of great durability. The pyramids in Giza, burial chambers in the UK and temples in Malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing. The earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone, or dry stacking. These are freestanding structures such as field walls, bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that they fit closely together without slipping. Structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases. They do not require any special tools, only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones. Traditional stone masonry evolved from dry stone stacking. Stone blocks are laid in rows of even (courses) or uneven (un-coursed) height, and fixed in place with lime mortar pasted between the stones. Traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is expensive to quarry, cut and transport, and the building process is labor and skill-intensive. Stone is a highly durable, low maintenance building material with high thermal mass. It is versatile, available in many shapes, sizes, colors and textures, and can be used for floors, walls, arches and roofs. Stone blends well with the natural landscape, and can easily be recycled for other building purposes. Straw bale Straw bale construction in Santa Cruz, CA Although grasses and straw have been in use in a range of ways in building since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular bales seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of Nebraska, where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality sods) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or foundation, with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered using either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders. Bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials, with bales between (simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate), referred to as \\"infill\\", or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof, referred to as \\"load-bearing\\" or \\"Nebraska-style\\", or a combination of framing and load- bearing may be employed, referred to a \\"hybrid\\" straw bale. Typically, bales created on farms with mobile machinery have been used (\\"field-bales\\"), but recently higher-density \\"recompressed\\" bales (or \\"straw-blocks\\") are increasing the loads that may be supported; where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall, the high density bales bear up to 4,000 lb./lin.ft. Timber frame The completed frame of a modern timber frame home The basic elements of timber frame building--joined timbers, clay walls and thatch roofs were in place in Europe and Asia by the 9th century. It remained the common mode of house construction in northern cultures until the 19th century. Craftsmanship was, and is, an important value in timber frame building. The oldest timber frame structures (for example, the timber framed stave churches of Scandinavia) show both craftsmanship and a strong grasp of the technical aspects of structural design, as do such structures in Japan. Timber framing typically uses a \\"bent.\\" A bent is a structural support, like a truss, consisting of two posts, a tie beam and two rafters. These are connected into a framework through joinery. To practice the craft, one must understand the basic structural aspects of the bent. This, along with a knowledge of joinery, are the basis of timber frame building. Timber framing is now a modern method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house building as well as public buildings. In conjunction with a number of natural insulations and timber cladding or modern lime renders, it is possible to quickly construct a high performance, sustainable building, using completely natural products. The benefits are many--the building performs better over its lifespan, waste is reduced (much can be re-cycled, composted or used as fuel). Timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.

The Cardinals beat the Athletics in seven games, a rematch and reversal of fortunes of the previous World Series. The same two teams faced off during the 1930 World Series and the Athletics were victorious. The only day-to-day player in the Cardinals' lineup who was different in 1931 was the \\"Wild Horse of the Osage\\", Pepper Martin‚Äîa 27-year- old rookie who had spent seven seasons in the minor leagues. He led his team for the Series in runs scored, hits, doubles, runs batted in and stolen bases, and also made a running catch to stifle a ninth-inning rally by the A's in the final game. The spitball pitch had been banned by Major League Baseball in 1920, but those still using it at that time were \\"grandfathered\\", or permitted to keep throwing it for the balance of their big-league careers. One of those who \\"wet his pill\\" still active in 1931 was Burleigh Grimes, with two Series starts, two wins and seven innings of no-hit pitching in Game 3\\\\. \\"Wild\\" Bill Hallahan started and won the other two for the Cards, and saved Game 7\\\\. The Athletics had captured their third straight American League pennant, winning 107 games (and 313 for 1929‚Äì31). But this would prove to be the final World Series for longtime A's manager Connie Mack. As he did after the Boston \\"Miracle Braves\\" swept his heavily favored A's in the Series, Mack would break up this great team by selling off his best players, this time out of perceived economic necessity rather than pique and competition from the short-lived Federal League. It would be the A's last World Series appearance in Philadelphia and it would be 41 years‚Äîand two cities‚Äîlater before the A's would return to the Fall Classic, after their successive moves to Kansas City in 1955 and Oakland in 1968. This would also be the city of Philadelphia's last appearance in the Series until 1950. It was also the last World Series until the 2017 edition in which both teams who had won at least 100 games in the regular season went the maximum seven games. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 The A's scored four runs in the third, enabling Lefty Grove to win Game 1 despite giving up 12 hits, three by Pepper Martin. The Cardinals struck first in the first inning on three consecutive one-out singles, the last of which to Jim Bottomley scoring a run. After a strikeout, Martin's double scored another run. In the top of the third with runners on first and second, Mule Haas's double scored Philadelphia's first run. Two consecutive walks by Paul Derringer loaded the bases and tied the game, then Jimmie Foxx's single scored two more runs. In the top of the seventh, Al Simmons's two-run home run put Philadelphia up 6‚Äì2, the game's final. Game 2 Pepper Martin's two hits and two stolen bases, scoring both Cardinal runs, supported Hallahan's three-hit shutout. The Cardinals scored the game's first run in the second when Pepper Martin doubled off of George Earnshaw, stole third and scored on Jimmy Wilson's sacrifice fly, and the game's second run in the seventh when Martin hit a leadoff single, stole second, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Charlie Gelbert's fielder's choice. Game 3 Grimes pitched a two-hitter and contributed a two-run single in the fourth. He had a shutout until Al Simmons hit a two-run homer with two outs in the ninth. St. Louis struck first in the second when with runners on first and third via a walk and single, Jimmie Wilson's single and Charlie Gelbert's lineout scored a run each. They added to their lead in the fourth off of Lefty Grove on Burleigh Grimes's two-run single with runners on second and third, and added another run in the ninth off of Roy Mahaffey on Jim Bottomley's double. Game 4 George Earnshaw pitched a brilliant two-hit shutout, walking one and striking out eight. Simmons RBI double in the first inning after a walk and two groundouts was all Earnshaw needed. Philadelphia added to their lead in the sixth off of Syl Johnson on Jimmie Foxx's home run and Jimmy Dykes's single after a Bing Miller double. Martin had both Cardinal hits. Game 5 Martin was a thorn in the A's side in the series, getting three hits and four RBI to lead St. Louis to a 5-1 victory. Through five games, Martin leads all regulars with a .667 (12-18) average. St. Louis struck first in the first on Pepper Martin's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third. Martin's home run after a double in the sixth made it 3‚Äì0 Cardinals. The A's scored their only run in the seventh on Bing Miller's groundout after two one-out singles. The Cardinals added to their lead in the eighth when George Watkins walked off of Rube Walberg, stole second and scored on Martin's single and in the ninth off of Eddie Rommel on Charlie Gelbert's single with two on. Game 6 The Athletics broke a scoreless tie with four runs in the fifth, Grove winning his second game of the series with a five-hitter, tying the series. After an error and walk off of Paul Derringer, Dib Williams's RBI single scored the game's first run. Two two-out walks loaded the bases and scored another run. Mickey Cochrane's RBI single scored a run, then a walk to Al Simmons scored another. St. Louis scored their only run in the sixth when Jake Flowers doubled and scored on Frankie Frisch's single. The A's added to their lead in the seventh off of Jim Lindsey. Max Bishop hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a bunt groundout, and scored on Al Simmons's single. After a single and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, a walk to Jimmy Dykes scored a run and an error scored two more. Game 7 The Cardinals struck first in the first when with runners on second and third via two single and a bunt groundout, a wild pitch by George Earnshaw to Pepper Martin scored a run and a strike three wild pitch to Ernie Orsatti scored another. A two-run home run by George Watkins in the third gave the Cardinals a 4-0 lead, but the Athletics scored two in the ninth on Doc Cramer's bases loaded two-run single, Hallahan getting the last out, saving the victory for Grimes. Despite going 0‚Äìfor‚Äì6 in Games 6 and 7, Pepper Martin was the leading hitter of the series with a .500 (12‚Äìfor‚Äì24) batting average.

He is currently the senior defensive analyst at the University of Arizona in Tucson, his alma mater. He previously served as a defensive assistant for the Tennessee Titans and Los Angeles Rams. Cecil also spent two seasons (1999‚Äì2000) as a television analyst for University of Arizona football games. As a player, he was a Pro Bowl safety. Early years Born in Red Bluff, California, Cecil grew up in Hanford and La Mesa; he graduated from Helix High School in La Mesa, where he was a standout player on a defense which set a school record for fewest points allowed per game and won a state title.La Jolla Star Chamber Chuck Cecil bio, LJStarChamber.com (accessed online February 12, 2009) and as a senior, Cecil was considered too small to be a collegiate star and thus was not offered a scholarship out of high school. Playing career=College Cecil attended the University of Arizona, where he walked-on for the Wildcats. He proved the recruiters wrong by eventually earning consensus All-America and Pacific-10 Conference Defensive Player of the Year honors after his nine- interception senior season in 1987. He held the Pac-10 record for career interceptions, with 21 (Lamont Thompson later broke the mark with 24), and set the Wildcats' school single-game record (and tied the Pac-10 record) with four interceptions against Stanford in 1987. In the 1986 rivalry game against fourth-ranked Arizona State Cecil returned an interception 105 yards for a Wildcats victory in Tucson. This play has been voted the greatest play in Wildcat football history. Despite the loss, ASU won the Pac-10 title and the Rose Bowl. Cecil was inducted into the Wildcats' Sports Hall of Fame in 1993 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009. Professional Selected by the Green Bay Packers in the fourth round of the 1988 NFL Draft (89th overall), Cecil was known for his thunderous tackling and aggressive style during his time as a safety for the Packers (1988‚Äì1992), Cardinals (1993), and Oilers (1995). He earned a trip to the Pro Bowl and garnered All- Madden status in 1992 when he recorded four interceptions and 102 tackles on the season. In 95 career games he totaled 400 tackles and 16 interceptions. During his years with the Packers, he earned the nickname \\"Scud\\" Cecil due to his hit-or-miss approach to tackling opponents. He often left his feet and led with his helmet, and much like the infamous missiles launched during the Gulf War ‚Äì would occasionally miss completely or arrive late. Cecil is regarded as among the most vicious hitters in National Football League history. He was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1993 (October 11 issue) with the question: \\"Is Chuck Cecil Too Vicious for the NFL?\\" Many photos taken of Cecil during games showed him with a bloodied nose. During much of his career, Cecil was forced to wear a \\"Gazoo Helmet\\"; a helmet so named because it resembled the head of The Great Gazoo, a recurring character in The Flintstones animated series. The \\"Gazoo helmet\\" is actually a thick padding that fits on a helmet's shell to reduce the risk of receiving a concussion and reducing the risk of injury to opponents due to helmet-first hits, for which Cecil was fined numerous times. Despite the additional protection, recurring concussions forced him into retirement. Coaching career In 2001, Cecil accepted a coaching position for the Tennessee Titans under Jeff Fisher, for whom he had played in his final season (when the team was the Houston Oilers). Cecil served as a defensive quality control assistant for three seasons. He was promoted in 2004, to work with the safeties and nickel backs. His responsibilities expanded in 2007 to cover all of the defensive backs. On February 12, 2009, Cecil was named the Titans' defensive coordinator, replacing the departed Jim Schwartz, who had taken the position of Head Coach for the Detroit Lions.Titans name Cecil Defensive Coordinator , Titans press release, February 12, 2009 (accessed online February 13, 2009) On October 3, 2010, during a game against the Denver Broncos, Cecil gave NFL officials the middle-finger gesture in an attempt to protest a neutral zone infraction call against one of his players. Live close-up video of Cecil was being aired at the time, and the gesture was broadcast without editing. For his inappropriate action, he was fined $40,000 by the league. On January 20, 2011, it was announced that Cecil would not be retained as the Titans' defensive coordinator. He was informed of this decision on January 18. The Titans ranked 26th in total yards allowed and 29th against the pass in the 2010 season. On February 16, 2011, ESPN.com reported that Cecil will interview with the Pittsburgh Steelers to be their next secondary coach. He would fill the void left by Ray Horton when he departed to become the defensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals.http://insider.espn.go.com/nfl/features/rumors/_/date/20110216#8104 On February 13, 2012, he was hired as the St. Louis Rams defensive secondary coach.https://www.stltoday.com/sports/football/professional/no-nonsense-cecil- to-coach-rams-secondary/article_c76cbbf8-3b63-5943-bfdd-60b30dec8aa8.html Personal life Cecil is married to author, columnist and television producer, Carrie Gerlach Cecil.

By far its most noteworthy moment was Babe Ruth's \\"called shot\\" home run, in his 10th and last World Series. It was punctuated by fiery arguments between the two teams, heating up the atmosphere before the World Series even began. A record 13 future Hall of Famers played in this Series, with three other future Hall of Famers also participating: umpire Bill Klem; Yankee's manager Joe McCarthy; and Cubs manager Rogers Hornsby. It was also the first in which both teams wore uniforms with numbers on the backs of the shirts. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 The Cubs opened the scoring with two runs in the top of the first inning with three singles, two by Woody English and Riggs Stephenson scoring a run each, but in the bottom of the third inning Earle Combs drew a leadoff walk off Guy Bush, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on Babe Ruth's single before a two-run home run by Lou Gehrig put the Yankees up 3‚Äì2. In the sixth inning, they loaded the bases on three walks with one out before a two-run single by Bill Dickey and RBI fielder's choice by Ben Chapman knocked Bush out of the game. Burleigh Grimes in relief allowed two- out two-run single to Combs. The Cubs scored two in the seventh on Stephenson's two-run single, but in the bottom half, after a walk and single, Tony Lazzeri's RBI single, Chapman's sacrifice fly, and Grimes's wild pitch put the Yankees up 11‚Äì4. In the eighth, Gabby Hartnett hit a leadoff double and scored on Mark Koenig's triple. Billy Herman's groundout scored the Cubs' last run. The Yankees got one more run in the bottom half off Bob Smith when Combs doubled and scored on Joe Sewell's single. Yankee starter Red Ruffing pitched a complete game, striking out 10 Cubs but walking six and giving up six runs, only three of which were earned. Game 2 In Game 2, Chicago scored first in the top of the first on Riggs Stephenson's sacrifice fly with runners on first and third off Lefty Gomez, but in the bottom half, after two leadoff walks, RBI singles by Lou Gehrig and Bill Dickey off Lon Warneke put the Yankees up 2‚Äì1. The Cubs tied the game in the third when Stephenson doubled with two outs and scored on Frank Demaree's single, but in the bottom half, Ben Chapman's two-run bases-loaded single put the Yankees ahead 4‚Äì2. They added another run in the fifth when Lou Gehrig hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Bill Dickey's single. Both pitchers pitched a complete game. This was the last World Series game Babe Ruth ever played in Yankee Stadium, with a single in his last Fall Classic home at-bat. Game 3 Ruth is congratulated by Gehrig after hitting his \\"called shot.\\" Gabby Hartnett, the Cubs catcher, watches. Roughly 50,000 Cubs fans showed up for Game 3, a very large crowd for the time made possible by the construction of temporary bleachers fronting Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. In a prelude of things to come, Ruth and Gehrig put on an impressive batting display in batting practice. Ruth launched nine balls into the outfield stands, while Gehrig hit seven. As reported in the first edition of A Day at the Park, by William Hartel, p. 82, Ruth said while batting: \\"I'd play for half my salary if I could bat in this dump all the time!\\" Cub starter Charlie Root struggled in the opening frame. The first two Yankees reached base on a walk and error, and Babe Ruth followed with a home run into the right-center-field bleachers to put the Yanks up 3‚Äì0. The existing newsreel footage showed Gehrig giving Ruth a friendly swat on the buttocks as Ruth crossed the plate. The Yankees got two, two-out singles that inning, but failed to score. In the bottom half, Billy Herman drew a leadoff walk off George Pipgras and scored on Kiki Cuyler's double. Gehrig hit a home run in the top of the third to put the Yankees up 4‚Äì1. In the bottom half, Cuyler homered with one out, then after a single and forceout, Grimm's RBI double cut the Yankees lead to 4‚Äì3. Next inning, Billy Jurges doubled to left after Ruth's futile dive for the ball and scored on an error to tie the game. In the top of the fifth, back-to-back home runs by Ruth and Gehrig put the Yankees up 6‚Äì4 and knock Grimm out of the game. The Yankees got another run in the ninth aided by two errors on Champman's double off Jakie May. Though Gabby Hartnett hit a leadoff home run in the bottom half and Billy Jurges singled off Pipgras, Herb Pennock retired the next three batters to end the game and leave the Yankees one win away from the championship. Game 4 The Yankees loaded the bases in the top of the first on two singles and a hit-by-pitch, but scored just once on Lou Gehrig's sacrifice fly. A walk loaded the bases, but Lon Warneke in relief of Guy Bush retired the next two batters to end the inning. In the bottom half, after two singles, Frank Demaree's three-run home run off Johnny Allen put the Cubs atop 3‚Äì1. After an error and single, Billy Jurges's RBI single knocked Allen out of the game. Wilcy Moore relieved him and put the fire out, giving up only one additional run in innings. Tony Lazzeri's two-out two-run home run in the third cut the Cubs' lead to 4‚Äì3. The Yankees took the lead in the sixth on a two-run single by Gehrig off Jakie May, but in the bottom half, two errors allowed the Cubs to tie the game. In the seventh, after loading the bases, three straight hits by Earle Combs, Joe Sewell and the Babe, the last-ever World Series hits for Sewell and Ruth, put the Yankees up for good, 9‚Äì5. A hit-by-pitch reloaded the bases, but Bud Tinning retired two to end the inning. The Yankees blew the game open in the ninth off Burleigh Grimes, starting with a leadoff home run by Earle Combs, then after two outs, Gehrig walked before Lazzeri's second home run of the game made it 12‚Äì5 Yankees. They scored one more run when Bill Dickey singled and scored on Ben Chapman's double. In the bottom half, Herb Pennock allowed a leadoff single to Billy Herman who stole second and third on defensive indifferences and scored on Woody English's groundout before Pennock retired the next two hitters to end the series. The Yankees had won their fourth World Series, and their 12th consecutive Series game. It was the last Series for Yankee mainstays Ruth, Combs and Pennock. The Cubs extended their World Series victory drought to 24 years with their humiliating loss, their fourth consecutive in the Fall Classic after 1910, 1918 and 1929 (to the A's, Red Sox and A's again respectively). The Cubs' drought would end up lasting 108 years, having been finally ended when the Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians in seven games to win the 2016 World Series. Composite line score 1932 World Series (4‚Äì0): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.) The arguments Bench jockeying, called \\"trash talk\\" nowadays, was standard procedure in baseball then as now. No verbal punches were ever pulled, but the jockeying was supposedly taken to new heights (or depths) in this Series stemming from Yankee disrespect for the way the Cubs treated their former teammate, shortstop Mark Koenig, after his acquisition from the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A Mission Reds of the Pacific Coast League on April 25, 1932. Despite Koenig's regular-season contributions (hitting .353 and fielding well), his stingy Cub teammates voted him only half a player's postseason share before the start of the Series because he had only played in 33 games and was unable to play in the Series due to injury. When some of Koenig's Yankee friends got wind of this, they dissed the Cubs as \\"cheapskates\\" in the press, \\"tight\\" with their Series money. Ruth infuriated the Cubs the most when he called them cheapskates. Adding spice to the verbal stew was that Yankee manager Joe McCarthy had been fired by the Cubs a year or two after leading them to the 1929 NL pennant. When the Series started in New York, the Cubs retaliated by calling the Babe \\"fat\\" and \\"washed up\\" along with every obscenity they could think of. Guy Bush, Cub starter in Game 1, led the verbal attack on Ruth, calling him \\"nigger\\" (a common bench-jockey slam against the Babe for his broad nose and thick lips despite his German origin), and banter like this went on for most of the Series. The \\"called shot\\" Babe Ruth's called shot refers to the home run he hit in the fifth inning of Game 3\\\\. Existing film shows Ruth made a pointing gesture during this at-bat, but what this signified is ambiguous. Though neither fully confirmed nor refuted, the story goes that Ruth pointed to the center field bleachers, supposedly predicting he would hit a home run there. On the next pitch, he hit what was estimated as a nearly 500' \\"Ruthian\\" homer to deep center past the flagpole and into the temporary seating in the streets. A few reporters later wrote that Ruth had \\"called his shot\\" (like a pool shark), and thus the legend was born. Ruth, ever aware of his larger-than-life public image, was quick to confirm the story once he got wind of it. Conflicting testimony and inconclusive film footage have placed that moment high up in the realm of baseball legend.

A best-of-seven playoff, it was played between the National League (NL) pennant winner New York Giants and the American League (AL) pennant winner Washington Senators. The Giants defeated the Senators in five games for their first championship since and their fourth overall. Key to the Giants' World Series triumph was the pitching of aces \\"King\\" Carl Hubbell and \\"Prince\\" Hal Schumacher. This would be the last World Series played in Washington, D.C., until . The Giants next won the World Series in , their final title in New York City as the franchise moved to San Francisco after the season. Background New York Giants majority owner John McGraw retired as manager in 1932 after 30 years at the helm, naming his prot√©g√©, young star first baseman Bill Terry, recently the last .400 hitter in the National League, as his player-manager successor. Somewhat similarly, former superstar hurler Walter Johnson also retired in 1932 as Washington Senators manager in favor of young star shortstop Joe Cronin as their new player-manager. (McGraw watched the Series from the stands, and died four months later.) The Senators were the surprise team of 1933, breaking a seven-year monopoly on the AL title jointly held by the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Athletics from 1926 to 1932. But this could also be called a joint 13-year monopoly by all three, since the Senators had also won in 1924 and 1925 and the Yankees won from 1921 to 1923. 43-year-old future Hall of Famer Sam Rice, in his last year with the Senators, had only one at bat during the series, picking up a pinch hit single in the second game. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Mel Ott Mel Ott had four hits and three RBI in Game 1, hitting a two-run home run in the first and RBI single in the third with two on, all off of Lefty Stewart. Travis Jackson scored the Giants' last run on a groundout off of Jack Russell. Carl Hubbell struck out ten, allowed two unearned runs (on groundouts by Joe Cronin in the fourth with two on and Joe Kuhel with the bases loaded in the ninth) and pitched a five-hitter. Game 2 Hal Schumacher The Giants overcame a 1‚Äì0 deficit (as a result of Goose Goslin's third inning home run) with a six-run sixth inning. They loaded the bases with no outs on a single, double and intentional walk off of General Crowder before Lefty O'Doul hit a pinch-hit single that scored two runs. RBI singles by Travis Jackson, Gus Mancuso, Hal Schumacher and Jo-Jo Moore each scored a run. Hal Schumacher pitched a five- hitter for a 6‚Äì1 victory, giving New York a 2‚Äì0 lead. Game 3 Earl Whitehill The Senators scored two runs in the first inning on Joe Cronin's RBI groundout with runners on second and third followed by Fred Schulte's RBI double. Next inning, Ossie Bluege hit a leadoff double and scored on Buddy Myer's double. They got one more run in the seventh when Luke Sewell singled, stole second, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Myer's double. Earl Whitehill held New York to five hits in the shutout. To date, this is the last World Series game in which a Washington team won at home. Game 4 Carl Hubbell Carl Hubbell went all eleven innings in the 2‚Äì1 win. He induced Cliff Bolton to ground out into a bases-loaded, game ending double play. Bill Terry's home run off of Monte Weaver put the Giants up 1‚Äì0 in the fourth, but the Senators tied the score in the seventh when Joe Kuhel reached on an error, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Luke Sewell's single. Travis Jackson singled to lead off the 11th, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored the game winning run on Blondy Ryan's single. Game 5 Dolf Luque In the second, Hal Schumacher's two-run single with runners on second and third put the Giants up 2‚Äì0 off of General Crowder. Kiddo Davis hit a leadoff double in the sixth and scored on Gus Mancuso's double to extend the lead to 3‚Äì0. Fred Schulte hit a game-tying three run homer in the sixth after two, two-out singles. for the Senators. Mel Ott's second home run of the series in the tenth off of Jack Russell won the Series for New York. Dolf Luque earned the win with 4 shutout innings of relief for Schumacher. Composite line score 1933 World Series (4‚Äì1): New York Giants (N.L.) beat Washington Senators (A.L.) Aftermath Until winning the National League pennant in 2019, Washington, D.C., had not hosted another World Series game since 1933. In 2012, the Washington Nationals, formerly the Montreal Expos, brought postseason play back to Washington for the first time in 79 years but lost the National League Division Series (NLDS) after being one strike away from eliminating the St. Louis Cardinals after their early 6‚Äì0 lead had evaporated. In 2019, the Nationals won their first postseason series since their move‚Äîthe Wild Card Game, NLDS, and NLCS‚Äîas their October stints in 2014, 2016, and 2017 had all ended in NLDS losses. (While in Montreal, the franchise made only one postseason appearance, winning the 1981 NLDS that was created due to that season's players' strike, then losing the 1981 NLCS.) The 2019 Nationals went on to win the World Series, which ended a 95-year championship drought for the city, dating back to the Senators' win in . This first Washington Senators franchise became the Minnesota Twins during the 1960‚Äì61 offseason, and would not reach the World Series again until as the Twins‚Äîsince then, they have won two World Series, in and . The second Washington Senators, inaugurated in 1961 to replace the first edition on its way to Minnesota, became the Texas Rangers in 1972, who were also defeated four games to one in their first World Series ever by the now San Francisco Giants in 2010, with both Series 77 years apart starting in the Giants' home park and the Giants losing only Game 3 on the road in each. The Rangers were then defeated again in by the St. Louis Cardinals, when they had two chances to win in Game 6 when they came within one strike of winning.

They had lost in , , , and . The Tigers won despite losing the services of first baseman Hank Greenberg. In Game 2, Greenberg collided with Cubs catcher Gabby Hartnett and broke his wrist, sidelining him for the rest of the Series. The Cubs had won 21 consecutive games in September (still a record ), eventually taking the National League pennant by four games over the defending World Series champions, the St. Louis Cardinals. In Game 6, Tommy Bridges pitched a complete game victory to win the Series for Detroit. With the score tied 3‚Äì3 in the top of the ninth inning, Bridges gave up a leadoff triple to Stan Hack, but retired the next three batters without the runner on third scoring. In the bottom of the ninth, Goose Goslin drove in the winning run with two outs. After the game, manager Mickey Cochrane said the following of Bridges' gutsy performance: \\"A hundred and fifty pounds of courage. If there ever is a payoff on courage this little 150-pound pitcher is the greatest World Series hero.\\" In addition to Bridges, the Tigers had a hitting hero. Right fielder Pete Fox accumulated ten hits and an average of .385 for the Series. Fox hit safely in all six games. Detroit owner Frank Navin, then 64 years old, had been running the organization for 30 years and had seen four of his teams win American League pennants, only to lose four World Series. Six weeks after the Tigers finally won the World Series in October 1935, Navin suffered a heart attack while riding a horse and died. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 A pitching duel between Lon Warneke and Schoolboy Rowe, both of whom went the distance, was decided by its leadoff batter, Augie Galan, doubling, and scoring on an error by Rowe that allowed Billy Herman to reach and eventually score on a Gabby Hartnett single. Frank Demaree added a homer in the ninth for the visiting Cubs. Game 2 In the bottom of the first, Jo-Jo White hit a leadoff single and scored on a double by Mickey Cochrane, who scored on Charlie Gehringer's single before Hank Greenberg's two-run home run knocked Cubs' starter Charlie Root out of the game. In the fourth, Roy Henshaw got two outs before letting the Tigers load the bases on a single, hit-by-pitch and walk. A wild pitch scored a run, then after a walk reloaded the bases, Gehringer's two-run single made it 7‚Äì0 Tigers. The Cubs got on the board in the fifth when Phil Cavarretta reached first on an error, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Billy Jurges's single. The Cubs got two more runs in the seventh on Billy Herman's single with runners on second and third, but the Tigers added a run in the bottom half on Pete Fox's RBI single off of Fabian Kowalik. Tommy Bridges pitched a complete game as the Tigers' 8‚Äì3 tied the series heading to Chicago. Game 3 In Game 3, Frank Demaree's leadoff home run in the second off of Elden Auker put Chicago on the board. A one-out single and subsequent error put runners on first and third before Bill Lee's ground out made it 2‚Äì0 Cubs. They added a run in the fifth when Billy Jurges drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Augie Galan's single. The Tigers got on the board in the sixth when Goose Goslin singled off of Lee and scored on Pete Fox's triple. In the eighth, after a walk and double, Goslin's two-run single tied the game and knocked Lee out. Reliever Lon Warneke allowed two singles, the second of which to Billy Rogell scoring a run, then Fox stole home to make it 5‚Äì3 Tigers. Detroit brought back Game 1 starter Schoolboy Rowe in relief. He allowed three straight one-out singles in the ninth, the last of which to Ken O'Dea, before Augie Galan's sacrifice fly sent the game into extra innings, but Rowe nailed down the victory after Jo-Jo White's RBI single scored the winning run off of Larry French in the 11th. This game remarkably featured four ejections, two from each team. The Tigers lost Woody English and coach Del Baker. The Cubs lost Tuck Stainback and manager Charlie Grimm. Neither English nor Stainback were in the game. Game 4 Alvin \\"General\\" Crowder did it all for Detroit, pitching a complete-game five-hitter, allowing only one run on Gabby Hartnett's home run in the second, singling in the third and scoring his team's first run on Charlie Gehringer's RBI double, and getting Flea Clifton home as the go-ahead run with a groundout in the sixth off of Tex Carleton aided by two errors. Chicago threatened against Crowder with a pair of one-out hits in the ninth, but Stan Hack grounded into a game-ending 6-4-3 double play. Game 5 Staving off elimination, the Cubs got a two-run home run from Chuck Klein after a leadoff triple in the second. They added another run in the seventh on Billy Herman's RBI double off of Schoolboy Rowe. They replaced Lon Warneke after six innings with right-hander Bill Lee, who gave up Detroit's only run in the ninth on three consecutive singles (the last of which to Pete Fox before settling down to retire the final three batters. This was the first of three World Series games that the Cubs have won in Wrigley Field. The others were Game 6 in 1945, and Game 5 in 2016. Game 6 In Game 6, Pete Fox's RBI double off of Larry French put the Tigers on the board. Billy Herman's RBI single tied the game in the third off of Tommy Bridges, who put the Tigers back in front in the fourth with an RBI groundout with two on, but Herman's two-run home run in the fifth put the Cubs ahead 3‚Äì2. The Tigers tied the game in the sixth when Billy Rogell doubled with two outs and scored on Marv Owen's single. In the ninth, Mickey Cochrane singled and moved to second on a groundout before Goose Goslin's walk-off single won it in front of Detroit's home fans, pitcher Tommy Bridges getting his second win of the Series. Stan Hack tripled to lead off the top of the 9th for the Cubs, but was left stranded at third. Composite line score 1935 World Series (4‚Äì2): Detroit Tigers (A.L.) over Chicago Cubs (N.L.) Detroit: \\"City of Champions\\" When the Detroit Tigers won the 1935 World Series, the city of Detroit was mired in the Great Depression, which had hit the city and its industries particularly hard. However, with the success of the Tigers and other Detroit teams and athletes in 1935/36, Detroit's luck appeared to be changing, as the City was dubbed the \\"City of Champions.\\" The Lions continued Detroit's winning ways by capturing the 1935 NFL Championship Game, followed by the Detroit Red Wings winning the 1935‚Äì36 Stanley Cup championship. With the Stanley Cup win, the city had seen three major league championships in less than a year. Detroit's \\"champions\\" included Detroit's \\"Brown Bomber\\", Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxing champion; native Detroiter Gar Wood who was the champion of unlimited powerboat racing and the first man to go 100 miles per hour on water; and Eddie \\"the Midnight Express\\" Tolan, a black Detroiter who won gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter races at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

The Yankees played their first World Series without Babe Ruth and their first with Joe DiMaggio, Ruth having been released by the Yankees after the 1934 season. He retired in 1935 as a member of the Boston Braves. Summary ‚Ä†: postponed from October 1 due to rain Matchups=Game 1 Carl Hubbell won Game 1, allowing only one run on George Selkirk's home run and seven hits. After Dick Bartell's fifth inning home run off Red Ruffing tied the game, An RBI single by Gus Mancuso scoring Mel Ott, who doubled to lead off, in the sixth inning put the Giants up 2‚Äì1. They padded their lead in the eighth inning. Two singles and a walk loaded the bases before a walk to Burgess Whitehead and sacrifice fly by Travis Jackson scored a run each. Hubbell's two-run single capped the game's scoring. He pitched a perfect ninth as the Giants took a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 The Yankees won Game 2 at the Polo Grounds by an 18‚Äì4 count, setting Series records () for the biggest margin of victory in a World Series game (14 runs) and the most runs scored in one game with 18. They loaded the bases with no outs in the first off Hal Schumacher on two singles and a walk before sacrifice flies by Lou Gehrig and Bill Dickey put them up 2‚Äì0. Two walks and a wild pitch by Lefty Gomez in the second inning allowed the Giants to cut the lead to 2‚Äì1, but the Yankees blew the game open in the third inning. A single, walk and error loaded the bases with no outs. Al Smith relieved Schumacher and allowed a two-run single to Gehrig and RBI single to Dickey. A one-out walk reloaded the bases before Tony Lazzeri's grand slam off Dick Coffman made it 9‚Äì1 Yankees. The Giants scored their last three runs in the fourth inning on a bases loaded walk to Dick Bartell followed by a two-run single by Bill Terry. The Yankees added a run in the sixth on Joe DiMaggio's sacrifice fly with two on off Frank Gabler, then loaded the bases in the seventh on a walk and two singles before Lazzeri's flyout and Gomez's groundout scored a run each. In the ninth, Jake Powell drew a leadoff walk off Harry Gumbert, stole second, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Gomez's single. After another single, back-to-back RBI singles by Red Rolfe and DiMaggio made it 15‚Äì4 Yankees. One out later, Dickey's three- run home run capped the scoring. DiMaggio made a tremendous play in Game 2\\\\. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning, Hank Leiber drove the ball deep into dead center, and Joe caught the ball running up the steps of the clubhouse. This remarkable catch was at least further than Willie Mays' far more celebrated catch of Vic Wertz's drive to deep straightaway center in Game 1 of the 1954 World Series. After DiMaggio's game-ending grab, President Roosevelt, who was in attendance, saluted Joe for his great catch as he rode off in the presidential limousine. All three ninth-inning outs were made by DiMaggio. Yankee second baseman Tony Lazzeri became only the second player ever to hit a grand slam home run in the World Series. Elmer Smith of the Cleveland Indians had been the sole achiever of that feat in World Series play, doing so in Game 5 of the 1920 World Series. Game 3 Hard luck- loser Freddie Fitzsimmons allowed only two hits over seven innings, one of them a tremendous home run by Gehrig in the second inning, but after the Giants tied the game in the fifth inning on Jimmy Ripple's home run off Bump Hadley, Frankie Crosetti's single with the count 0‚Äì2 and two outs scored Jake Powell with the decisive run in the eighth inning. Pat Malone pitched a scoreless ninth for the save. Game 4 The Yankees struck first in the second when Jake Powell reached on an error and scored on George Selkirk's single off Carl Hubbell. Next inning, Frank Crosetti hit a leadoff double and scored on Red Rolfe's single, then Lou Gehrig's two-run home run gave the Yankees a 4‚Äì0 lead. Jimmy Ripple's RBI single in the fourth off Monte Pearson put the Giants on the board. Bill Terry's groundout with runners on first and third in the eighth cut the Yankees' lead to two, but they got that run back in the bottom half when Gehrig hit a leadoff double off Frank Gabler and scored on Powell's single. Pearson won his first World Series game (he won three more, in 1937, 1938, and 1939). Game 5 The Giants struck first with back-to-back leadoff doubles by Jo-Jo Moore and Dick Bartell off Red Ruffing. RBI singles by Jimmy Ripple and Burgess Whitehead made it 3‚Äì0 Giants. George Selkirk's home run off Hal Schumacher in the second put the Yankees on the board. Next inning, with runners on second and third, an error on Frank Corsetti's groundball allowed another run to score. A similar situation in the sixth on Burgess Whitehead's groundball allowed the Giants to pad their lead to 4‚Äì2, but in the bottom half, three consecutive two-out singles allowed the Yankees to tied the game. Bill Terry's sacrifice fly in the top of the tenth inning off Pat Malone, scoring Jo-Jo Moore, who doubled to leadoff and moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, helped the Giants win Game 5 5‚Äì4. Game 6 The Giants loaded the bases in the first off Lefty Gomez on a single and two walks before Mel Ott drove in two with a double, but Jake Powell's home-run after a two-out triple off Freddie Fitzsimmons tied the game in the second. Next inning, Lou Gehrig's sacrifice fly after two one-out singles put the Yankees up 3‚Äì2. They extended their lead to 5‚Äì2 in the fourth on four singles, two of which by Gomez and Red Rolfe scoring a run each. Ott's home run in the fifth cut the lead to 5‚Äì3, then in the seventh, Dick Bartell hit a leadoff double and scored on Bill Terry's single to make it a one-run game. Tony Lazzeri's RBI single in the eighth off Slick Castleman made it 6‚Äì4 Yankees, but the Giants again cut the lead to one on Jo-Jo Moore's home run in the bottom half off Johnny Murphy. The Yankees, though, blew it open in the ninth. After two leadoff singles off Dick Coffman, an error on Bill Dickey's fielder's choice allowed one run to score. A walk loaded the bases before Powell drove it two with a single. Harry Gumbert relieved Coffman and after a walk loaded the bases, Murphy's single, Crosetti's walk, Rolfe's groundout, and Joe DiMaggio's single scored a run each to make it 13‚Äì5 Yankees. Murphy retired the Giants in order in the bottom of the ninth to give the Yankees the championship. Composite line score 1936 World Series (4‚Äì2): New York Yankees (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.) Aftermath The Yankees' fifth championship tied the record at that time, which was shared by the Boston Red Sox and the Philadelphia Athletics, who also had five World Series titles. The Yankees also tied the American League record at that time for the most World Series appearances with eight, also shared with the Athletics. They broke both records the following year. The Giants appeared in their 11th World Series, extending the record they already held at that time, and their seventh World Series defeat also extended the record they already owned. DiMaggio would go on to be the only person to play on four World Championship teams in his first four years in the big leagues, the 1936‚Äì39 Yankees. The Yankee left fielder Jake Powell started the year with the Washington Senators before coming over in the middle of the year in a trade for Ben Chapman. In this Series, the unheralded Powell would lead all hitters in hits (10), batting average (.455), runs (8) and walks (4), add a home run with five runs batted in, and grab the Yankees' only stolen base.

The Yankees won in five games, for their second championship in a row and their sixth in 15 years (1923, 1927‚Äì28, 1932, 1936). This was the Yankees' third Series win over the Giants (1923, 1936), finally giving them an overall edge in Series wins over the Giants with three Fall Classic wins to the Giants' two (after they lost the and 1922 Series to the Giants). Currently (), the St. Louis Cardinals are the only \\"Classic Eight\\" National League (1900‚Äì1961) team to hold a Series edge over the Bronx Bombers, with three wins to the Yankees' two. The 1937 victory by the Yankees also broke a three-way tie among themselves, the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox for the most World Series wins all-time (five each). By the time the Athletics and Red Sox won their sixth World Series (in 1972 and 2004, respectively), the Yankees had far outpaced them in world championships with 20 in 1972 and 26 in 2004. The 1937 Series was the first in which a team (in this case, the Yankees) did not commit a single error, handling 179 total chances (132 putouts, 47 assists) perfectly. Game 4 ended with the final World Series innings ever pitched by Hall of Famer Carl Hubbell who, during the ninth inning, gave up Hall of Famer Lou Gehrig's final Series home run. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 The Series opener was a battle of aces, as the Giants sent their \\"Mealticket\\", screwballer Carl Hubbell, who had won 22 games during the season, to the mound against the Bombers' Lefty Gomez, who had won 21. Hubbell and Gomez matched zeroes until the top of the fifth inning, when Jimmy Ripple singled, moved to third on another single by Johnny McCarthy, and scored the only Giant run of the game when Gus Mancuso hit into a double play. Hubbell kept the Yankees at bay in the bottom half of the inning, but the wheels came off for him in the sixth. A walk and two singles loaded the bases with one out before Joe DiMaggio's two- run single put the Yankees up 2‚Äì1. An intentional walk reloaded the bases before Bill Dickey's RBI single increased the lead to 3-1, then George Selkirk's two-run single following a force out at home chased King Carl. An error on Tony Lazzeri's ground ball made it 6‚Äì1 Yankees, then Giant pitcher Dick Coffman issued two walks, including one to Red Rolfe that forced in a run before DiMaggio flew out to end the inning. Tony Lazzeri added a home run in the eighth inning off Al Smith, while Gomez stymied the Giants, holding them to one run and six hits in a complete game, 8‚Äì1 victory for a 1‚Äì0 Yankee lead in the Series. Game 2 For Game 2, the Yankees started veteran Red Ruffing against Giant rookie Cliff Melton. Ruffing would give Melton a rude welcome to postseason play with both his arm and his bat. The Giants touched Ruffing for a run in the first, as Dick Bartell doubled and Mel Ott drove him in with a single with one out. This did not faze Ruffing, who whiffed the next three batters to end the inning. As in Game 1, this would be the only Giant run of the day. Melton was able to neutralize the potent Bombers for the next four innings, giving up only two hits and striking out two. In the fifth, however, the Yankees chased the youngster from the game when they took a 2‚Äì1 lead on a leadoff double by Myril Hoag, then RBI singles by George Selkirk and Ruffing. Just as in Game 1, the pinstripers opened up the game in the sixth, when Selkirk and Ruffing came through again, this time with two-run doubles after two leadoff singles off of Harry Gumbert. In the seventh, the Yankees tacked on two more runs off of Dick Coffman with leadoff single and walk, followed by a Bill Dickey single that scored Joe DiMaggio and a fly ball by Myril Hoag that plated Lou Gehrig. Ruffing held the fort the rest of the way, scattering seven hits with one run and eight strikeouts. For the second straight game the Yankees won 8‚Äì1, for a 2‚Äì0 Series lead as the teams moved a few miles south to the Polo Grounds. Game 3 The Yankees struck first in Game 3 on Tony Lazzeri's RBI single with two on in the second off of Hal Schumacher. Next inning, Lou Gehrig hit a one out single, and scored on a triple by Bill Dickey, who then scored on a single by George Selkirk. Gehrig added a sacrifice fly next inning with runners on first and third. The Yankees got one more run in the fifth when Selkirk reached second on an error and scored on Myril Hoag's single. The Giants scored their only run in the seventh when Jimmy Ripple singled with one out and scored on Johnny McCarthy's double. Monte Pearson needed last-out help from Johnny Murphy after loading the bases in the bottom of the ninth, inducing Harry Danning, the tying run at the plate, to fly out to centerfield. The Yankees now had a 3‚Äì0 lead in the series. Game 4 This is the second time in World Series history that a team that has lost the first three games has won a World Series game. This was Carl Hubbell's last World Series appearance. Hubbell allowed only six hits and walked one. Everyone in the NY Giants lineup except Hubbell hit safely. The Yankees scored the game's first run in the first when Red Rolfe hit a leadoff triple and scored on Joe DiMaggio's sacrifice fly, but in the bottom of the second, three consecutive leadoff singles tied the game. Carl Hubbell's fielder's choice and Jo-Jo Moore's single scored a run each. Ivy Andrews relieved Bump Hadley and allowed an RBI single to Dick Bartell. A two-out walk loaded the bases before Hank Leiber's two-run single capped the inning's scoring. The Yankees scored a run in the third without a hit aided by three errors. The Giants added a run in the seventh on Harry Danning's RBI double with two on. Lou Gehrig homered in the ninth for the Yankees, who could get nothing else as the Giants' 7‚Äì3 win forced a Game 5. Game 5 Myril Hoag's home run leading off the second inning and a Joe DiMaggio blast in the third gave Lefty Gomez a 2‚Äì0 lead. Mel Ott's two-run home run in the bottom of the third tied it. The Yankees got the game-winning (and Series-winning) runs they needed in the fifth on a Tony Lazzeri triple, an RBI single by Gomez and an RBI double by Lou Gehrig.

The Yankees swept the Series in four games for the second straight year, winning their record fourth consecutive title (they would later win five straight from 1949 to 1953). Yankee manager Joe McCarthy won his fifth title, tying the record held by Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack. In the 10th inning of the final game, a famous play at the plate typified the Series. \\"King Kong\\" Charlie Keller scored when he and the ball both collided with catcher \\"Schnoz\\" Ernie Lombardi, and then Joe DiMaggio also scored while Lombardi, rolling on the ground, tried in vain to retrieve the ball. Lombardi had been smacked in the groin, but the puritanical press reported it as Lombardi \\"napping\\" at the plate. The Yankees matched the Reds in hits with 27, but out-homered them 7‚Äì0 and out-scored them 20‚Äì8. Keller led the Yanks with seven hits, three home runs, six RBI, eight runs scored, a .438 average and a 1.188 slugging percentage. Both teams played sterling defense for most of the series until the ninth inning of Game 4. Up until then the Reds matched the Yankees with committing just one error for the series. But Cincinnati committed a total of three errors in the ninth and 10th innings of Game 4 which led to five unearned runs, sealing the New York sweep. Keller broke the record for most homers by a rookie in a World Series game with two in Game 3\\\\. Also in Game 3, Junior Thompson gave up five hits in innings worked. Four of the five were home runs, tying the record for long balls allowed during a Series game set by the Cubs' Charlie Root in 1932. Despite the loss, the Reds were an organization on the rise, having improved from eighth and last in the National League in 1937 (56‚Äì98, .364) to fourth in '38 (82‚Äì68, .547) and first as NL champions in '39. Ironically, despite being dominated by the Bronx Bombers in the 1939 Series, the Reds would return in 1940 to win the World Series while the Yankees finished behind Detroit and Cleveland in the AL pennant race, snapping their consecutive World Series streak at four. At a cumulative time of seven hours and five minutes, the 1939 World Series is one of the shortest World Series in real time, and was shorter than the third game of the 2018 World Series that lasted 7 hours, 20 minutes and was 18 innings long. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 In the opener, starters Red Ruffing and Paul Derringer pitched complete games. The Reds struck first in the fourth inning when Ival Goodman walked with two outs and scored on Frank McCormick's single, but the Yankees tied the game in the fifth inning Joe Gordon singled and scored on Babe Dahlgren's double. In the bottom of the ninth inning with one out and the score tied 1‚Äì1, Charlie Keller tripled. The Reds walked Joe DiMaggio, but Bill Dickey ended it with a walk-off single to center. Game 2 Lasting just 87 minutes, both pitchers threw complete games, Monte Pearson winning it with a two-hitter. In the bottom of the third inning Babe Dahlgren hit a leadoff double and scored on two groundouts. Red Rolfe then singled and scored on Charlie Keller's double. After another single, Bill Dickey's RBI single made it 3‚Äì0 Yankees. They added another run in the fourth inning on Dalgren's home run and took a 2‚Äì0 series lead heading to Cincinnati. Game 3 In Game 3, Charlie Keller's two-run home run the first off of Gene \\"Junior\\" Thompson put the Yankees up 2‚Äì0. In the bottom half, three consecutive two-out singles, the last an RBI one by Ernie Lombardi, cut the lead to 2‚Äì1. Yankees' starter Lefty Gomez left after that inning. In the second, Bump Hadley allowed four singles, the last two of which to Billy Werber and Ival Goodman scoring a run each, but in the third, Joe DiMaggio's two-run home run after a two-out walk to Keller put the Yankees back in front 4‚Äì3. They added to their lead in the fifth on Keller's two-run home run and Bill Dickey's home run to knock Thompson out of the game. Their 7‚Äì3 win left them one win away from the championship. Game 4 Neither side scored until the seventh. Home runs by Charlie Keller and Bill Dickey off of starter Paul Derringer put the Yankees on the board, but the Reds struck back in their half of the inning. With runners on second and third via an error and double off of reliever Steve Sundra, Wally Berger's RBI groundout put the Reds on the board, then after a walk, back-to-back RBI singles by Willard Hershberger and Billy Werber put the Reds up 3‚Äì2. They added another run next inning when Ival Goodman hit a leadoff double off of Johnny Murphy and scored on Ernie Lombardi's single, but in the ninth after two leadoff singles off of Bucky Walters, Dickey's fielder's choice aided by an error scored a run, then one out later, Joe Gordon's RBI single tied the game. Next inning, with two on via a walk and error, Joe DiMaggio drove them both in with a single and another error allowed DiMaggio himself to score to put the Yankees up 7‚Äì4. In the bottom half, Murphy allowed two leadoff singles, but retired the next three batters to end the game and series.

It marked the third time in World Series history in which both teams had the same home field (the others being the and Series, both played at the Polo Grounds in New York City). It would be 76 years before another World Series had all of its games played in a single ballpark (the upcoming Series, which will use Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas as a neutral site due to health concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic).https://www.foxsports.com/articles/mlb/column- remembering-the-last-series-to-be-played-in-one-park 1944 saw perhaps the nadir of 20th-century baseball, as the long-moribund St. Louis Browns won their only American League pennant. The pool of talent was depleted by the draft to the point that in 1945 (but not 1944), as the military scraped deeper and deeper into the ranks of the possibly eligible, the Browns actually used a one-armed player, Pete Gray. Some of the players were 4-Fs, rejected by the military for physical defects or limitations that precluded duty.Silver 2007 Others divided their time between factory work in defense industries and baseball, some being able to play ball only on weekends. Some players avoided the draft by chance, despite being physically able to serve. Stan Musial of the Cardinals was one. Musial, enlisting in early 1945, missed one season. He rejoined the Cardinals in 1946. As both teams called Sportsman's Park home, the traditional 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 home field assignment was used (instead of the wartime 3‚Äì4). The Junior World Series of that same year, partly hosted in Baltimore's converted football stadium, easily outdrew the \\"real\\" Series and attracted attention to Baltimore as a potential major league city. Ten years later, the Browns transferred there and became the Orioles. Another all-Missouri World Series was played 41 years later, with the Kansas City Royals defeating the Cardinals in seven games. The Series was also known as the \\"Trolley Series,\\" \\"Streetcar Series,\\" or the \\"St. Louis Showdown.\\" Coincidentally, this World Series was played the same year Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released the musical film Meet Me in St. Louis. It remains one of two World Series played that featured two teams from the same city other than New York; the other was the 1906 World Series between the two Chicago teams. The 1989 World Series featured two teams from the San Francisco metropolitan area, but not the same city. This is the only World Series to date in which neither team was credited with a stolen base. Background Many of the game's best players were called away for World War II, and the result was a seriously depleted pool of talent.For a discussion and evaluation of how much difference this depletion of talent made, see Silver 2007. The top team in the American League was the St. Louis Browns, who collectively batted .252 en route to their only pennant in 52 seasons. They only had one .300 hitter in outfielder Mike Kreevich (who barely made it at .301), one man with 20 home runs, shortstop Vern Stephens (who hit exactly 20), and one player over the 85 runs batted in mark, Stephens, who knocked in 109 to lead the league. On the mound, the Browns boasted Nels Potter and Jack Kramer, who combined for 36 victories. The team squeaked into first place by winning 11 out of their final 12 games, including the last 4 in a row over the defending champion New York Yankees. The last victory, combined with Detroit's loss to Washington, enabled St. Louis to finish one game ahead of the Tigers in the American League. Their 89‚Äì65 record would be the worst for an AL champion until the Minnesota Twins won the pennant in 1987 with a record of 85‚Äì77. On the other side of Sportsman's Park, the other Major League team from St. Louis was doing business as usual. In making off with their third straight National League pennant (leading by games over Pittsburgh), manager Billy Southworth's Cardinals had won 105 games and ran their three- year victory total to 316. The Cardinals were the first National League franchise with three consecutive 100 win seasons. The 1944 club featured league MVP Marty Marion and future Hall of Famer Stan Musial. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 George McQuinn hit the Browns' only home run of the series to put his team ahead in the fourth inning, while Denny Galehouse outpitched World Series veteran Mort Cooper to hold on for the win. Game 2 Blix Donnelly came in as a relief pitcher in the eighth inning, and tallied no runs, two hits and seven strikeouts for the win. Ken O'Dea's pinch- hit single in the 11th scored the winning run. Game 3 Jack Kramer struck out ten batters on the way to a 6‚Äì2 Browns triumph, the last World Series game the team would win until the 1966 World Series, as the Baltimore Orioles. Game 4 Browns starter Sig Jakucki had been away from baseball for five years, but returned to win 13 games in 1944. He lasted only three innings giving up four runs. Stan Musial hit a two-run homer in the first, and the Browns never recovered. Harry Brecheen went the distance for the win despite giving up nine hits and four walks. Game 5 Mort Cooper recovered from his opening game loss to beat Galehouse with a seven-hit, 2‚Äì0 shutout. In the Cardinals' 1942‚Äì1944 stranglehold on the National League championship, Cooper had won 65 games and thrown 23 shutouts. Game 6 For Game 6, it was Max Lanier and Ted Wilks (who both had 17 wins and shared a 2.65 ERA) that wrote the final chapter to the Browns' \\"Cinderella season\\" with a 3‚Äì1 victory that wrapped up the Cardinals' second Series title in three years. Ted Wilks was brilliant in relief, retiring all 11 Browns he faced, clinching the Cardinals' fifth World Series title.

The Yankees won the Series in seven games for their first title since , and their 11th World Series championship in team history. Yankees manager Bucky Harris won the Series for the first time since managing the Washington Senators to their only title in . In 1947, Jackie Robinson, a Brooklyn Dodger, desegregated major league baseball. For the first time in World Series history, a racially integrated team played. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 There was an announced crowd of 73,365 in Yankee Stadium for Game 1. Brooklyn struck first in the first inning on Dixie Walker's RBI single off Spec Shea to score Pete Reiser from second base, but starter Ralph Branca was knocked out in a five-run fifth. A single, walk and hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before Johnny Lindell's two-run double put the Yankees up 2‚Äì1. After a walk re-loaded the bases, another walk forced in a run, then after a groundout, Tommy Henrich's RBI single to left off Hank Behrman capped the inning's scoring. The Dodgers chipped away at the Yankees lead, getting a run in the sixth on Carl Furillo's RBI single off Joe Page and another in the seventh on Page's wild pitch with Pee Wee Reese at second, but Page held the Dodgers scoreless afterward as the Yankees took a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 The Yankees struck first in Game 2 on Johnny Lindell's double-play ground ball after two leadoff singles in the first off Vic Lombardi, scoring Snuffy Stirnweiss, but the Dodgers tied the game in the third on Jackie Robinson's RBI single. The Yankees regained the lead in the bottom half of the inning on Lindell's RBI triple with a runner at third, but the Dodgers again tied the game in the fourth on Dixie Walker's home run. In the bottom half of the fourth, after a leadoff triple, Phil Rizzuto's RBI double put the Yankees back in front 3‚Äì2. In the next inning, Tommy Henrich's lead-off home run extended their lead to 4‚Äì2. After a ground-rule double knocked Lombardi out of the game, George McQuinn's RBI single off Hal Gregg made it 5‚Äì2 Yankees. The Yankees added another run in the sixth on Lindell's sacrifice fly before breaking it open in the seventh. After a leadoff single and wild pitch by Hank Behrman, Billy Johnson's RBI single made it 7‚Äì2 Yankees. After a pop out and intentional walk, Reynolds's RBI single made it 8‚Äì2 Yankees. Rex Barney relieved Behrman and allowed an RBI single to Snuffy Stirnweiss and threw a wild pitch that turned the Yanks' advantage to 10‚Äì2. The Dodgers scored one more run in the ninth on Spider Jorgensen's groundout off Allie Reynolds, who scattered nine hits in a complete-game win. Game 3 The series shifted to Ebbets Field and the stadium shook in the second inning as the Dodgers rang up six runs. After a one-out walk, Bruce Edwards's double and Pee Wee Reese's single scored a run each. One out later, after a single and passed ball, Eddie Stanky's two-run double was the end for Yankee starter Bobo Newsom, but the runs kept coming with a Carl Furillo two-run double after a single off Vic Raschi. The rest of the day, the Yankees pecked away. Back-to-back RBI singles by Johnny Lindell and Joe DiMaggio off Joe Hatten made it 6‚Äì2 Dodgers in the third. After the Dodgers scored a run in the bottom half of the third on Spider Jorgensen's RBI single after a hit-by-pitch and wild pitch by Karl Drews, Sherm Lollar hit an RBI double in the fourth after a walk and Snuffy Stirnweiss added an RBI single. After two walks in the bottom half of the fourth off Spud Chandler, the Dodgers got those runs back on back-to-back RBI singles by Dixie Walker and Gene Hermanski, but Joe DiMaggio hit a two-run home run in the fifth after a walk. Tommy Henrich's RBI double in the next inning and Yogi Berra's home run in the seventh off Ralph Branca made it 9‚Äì8 Dodgers. In a panic, Dodger fans let out a sigh of relief as reliever Hugh Casey set down Billy Johnson, Phil Rizzuto and Berra in order in the ninth. Upon the completion of the series, game 3 set a peculiar record. The number of Yankee runs put up, eight, is the largest number of runs accumulated in a World Series game, by a team which lost the game, yet went on to win the series. This record is shared in common only with game 2 of 1956. Game 4 The Yankees entered Game 4 aiming to take a three games to one lead in the best-of-seven series, and came one out away from doing this. They scored a run in the first on a bases-loaded walk off Harry Taylor and another in the fourth on Johnny Lindell's double after a leadoff triple off Hal Gregg. Bill Bevens, the Yankee starter, pitched innings without allowing a base hit, but allowed a run in the fifth on Pee Wee Reese's fielder's choice after two walks and a sacrifice bunt. No pitcher had ever thrown a no-hitter in a major league World Series game (although the so-called \\"Negro World Series\\" had produced complete-game no-hit pitching performances prior to 1947). Going into the bottom of the ninth inning, Bevens and the Yankees led 2‚Äì1. Bevens got Bruce Edwards to fly out, and then walked Carl Furillo. Spider Jorgensen fouled out for the 2nd out. Al Gionfriddo pinch-ran for Furillo. Pete Reiser pinch-hit for pitcher Hugh Casey; during the at-bat, Gionfriddo stole second base. The Yankees then intentionally walked Reiser. Eddie Miksis pinch-ran for Reiser, and the Dodgers sent Cookie Lavagetto to pinch-hit for Eddie Stanky. Lavagetto lined a 1‚Äì0 fastball to right field; the ball ricocheted off the wall with a peculiar bounce and hit Yankee right fielder Tommy Henrich in the shoulder, as Gionfriddo and Miksis raced around to score. The play ended the no-hitter and won the game for the Dodgers. The hit was the last of Lavagetto's career. Additionally, neither Lavagetto nor Bevens nor Gionfriddo would play in the majors again following this Series. The Dodgers, with this hit, avoided a three-games-to-one deficit, avoided becoming the victim of a no-hitter, and tied the Series at two games each. The rapid and dramatic reversal of fortunes may have provided a momentum swing. As was the case in their only previous World Series encounter six years earlier, the Yankees and Dodgers again played a dramatic Game 4 which was decided on a lead change with two outs in the ninth inning. In both instances the Yankees entered the game with a 2‚Äì1 series lead and Hugh Casey ended up being the pitcher of record for the Dodgers (losing in 1941,https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/BRO/BRO194110050.shtml winning in 1947https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BRO/BRO194710030.shtml). Game 5 Nine walks in fewer than five innings proved the undoing of Rex Barney in this start for Brooklyn. A pair of walks and RBI single by opposing pitcher Spec Shea in the fourth put the Yankees up 1‚Äì0. Joe DiMaggio homered to left in the fifth. That was all the runs the visiting Yanks would get at Ebbets Field, but this was all Shea needed. A hit by Jackie Robinson in the sixth scored Al Gionfriddo to pull the Dodgers within 2‚Äì1. Then in the ninth, after a Bruce Edwards leadoff single and sacrifice bunt by Carl Furillo, the tying run died on base. Shea got Spider Jorgensen on a fly to right, and with Brooklyn's fans on their feet, pinch-hitter Cookie Lavagetto struck out. Game 6 The Dodgers won Game 6 to force a seventh and deciding game. Three straight singles loaded the bases in the first with no outs, then Dixie Walker's double play and Allie Reynolds's passed ball scored a run each. In the third, three straight doubles by Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson and Walker made it 4‚Äì0 Dodgers. In the bottom of the inning, after a double and wild pitch by Vic Lombardi, an error on Snuffy Stirnweiss's ground ball allowed a run to score. After a single, Johnny Lindell's RBI single cut the Dodgers' lead to 4‚Äì2. After another single knocked Lombardie out of the game, RBI singles by Billy Johnson and Bobby Brown off Ralph Branca tied the game. Yogi Berra's RBI single next inning put the Yankees up 5‚Äì4. In the sixth, after a leadoff single and double off Joe Page, Cookie Lavagetto's sacrifice fly tied the game, then Bobby Bragan's RBI single put the Dodgers up 6‚Äì5. After a single knocked Page out of the game, Reese's two-run single off Bobo Newsom made it 8‚Äì5 Dodgers. A catch made by Al Gionfriddo, replayed countless times, may be the most remembered play of this game, and one of the most remembered plays of the Series. Al Gionfriddo's Game 6 catch. In the last of the sixth, the Dodgers sent Al Gionfriddo to left field as a defensive replacement for Eddie Miksis. Joe Hatten came in to pitch. With two on and two outs, Joe DiMaggio came to bat for the Yankees, representing the potential tying run. DiMaggio drove the ball deep, and Gionfriddo quickly pedalled back to snare it just in front of the bullpen-alley fence, near the marker posted to the center field side of the bullpen alley (the sign on the left field side of the alley was posted as 402). Radio announcer Red Barber provided the play-by-play, which has often accompanied re-played film footage: Many announcers since that time have used variations of the call, especially Chris Berman of ESPN. These announcers have tended to describe the ball itself as going \\"back-back-back\\". In Barber's call, it was the outfielder who was going \\"back-back-back\\". Films of the play showed DiMaggio, heading for second, kick the dirt in disgust after he realized Gionfriddo had caught the ball. This was a surprise to many who witnessed it, since DiMaggio was known to never show his emotions while playing. Red Barber declared it, \\"probably the only time ever that DiMaggio was publicly and visibly upset.\\" Three of the 1947 Series' prominent figures, Gionfriddo, Lavagetto and Bevens, finished their playing careers in this Series. Gionfriddo did not play in Game 7, and his catch of DiMaggio's drive was his only put-out in this game. So Gionfriddo's famous catch was his final put-out in his major league career. The Yankees loaded the bases in the bottom of the ninth off Joe Hatten and Hugh Casey, but scored only once on a groundout. Game 7 The scoring began in the second inning, when the Dodgers strung together four consecutive hits: three off of Yankee starter Spec Shea, and a fourth off of reliever Bill Bevens, to put the Dodgers ahead, 2‚Äì0, in the top half of the inning. Gene Hermanski tripled, Bruce Edwards drove Hermanski in with a single, and Carl Furillo followed with another single, prompting a pitching change. Spider Jorgensen greeted reliever Bevens with a double, scoring Edwards for the second run. In the bottom half of the second inning, the Yankees cut the lead to 2‚Äì1. After Dodger starter Hal Gregg issued two walks, Phil Rizzuto delivered an RBI single, scoring George McQuinn. In the bottom of the fourth, the Yankees took the lead with a two-out rally. With two runners on, pinch-hitter Bobby Brown doubled off of Gregg, scoring Billy Johnson to tie the game. Hank Behrman replaced Gregg. After a walk loaded the bases, Tommy Henrich stroked an RBI single, scoring Rizzuto and putting the Yankees up 3‚Äì2. With this lead, Yankee pitcher Joe Page entered the game to begin the top of the fifth inning, and would close the game out. Over the next five innings, Page retired 13 consecutive Dodger batters. During this time, the Yankees added two runs. Rizzuto lead off the bottom of the sixth with a bunt single, and stole second base; Allie Clark drove him home with a single off of Joe Hatten, making the score 4‚Äì2. In the bottom of the seventh, Aaron Robinson hit a sacrifice fly off of Hugh Casey, to score Billy Johnson, who had just tripled. In all, Page pitched five innings of one-hit, shutout relief. With one out in the top of the ninth, he allowed his first and only baserunner of the outing, when Eddie Miksis singled. Page quickly recovered, inducing Edwards to ground into a double play that ended the game. Composite line score 1947 World Series (4‚Äì3): New York Yankees (A.L.) over Brooklyn Dodgers (N.L.) Records and important events For the first time, a World Series produced total receipts over $2 million: Gate receipts were $1,781,348.92, radio rights $175,000.00 and television rights $65,000. Yogi Berra pinch-hit for Sherm Lollar in the seventh inning of Game 3 and hit the first pinch-hit home run in World Series history. Ralph Branca served the pitch. This was the first World Series to be televised, although the games were only seen in a small number of Eastern markets with stations connected via coaxial cable: New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Schenectady, New York; Washington, DC; and environs surrounding these cities. The October 18, 1947 edition of Billboard reported that a total of over 3.9 million people viewed the seven games, primarily on TV sets located in bars (Billboard estimated 5,400 tavern TV sets in NYC alone, with 4,870 in use). The October 13, 1947, edition of Time magazine reported that President Truman, who had just made the first Oval Office TV appearance on October 5, 1947, and received the first TV for the White House, watched parts of the Series but \\"skipped the last innings\\". At the direction of Commissioner Happy Chandler, the Series, for the first time, used six umpires to make calls. Series from 1918 through 1946 used four umpires in the infield, with two alternates available for security. However, no alternate had ever been needed, and Chandler believed that enlisting these umpires to make calls along the outfield lines would put these men and their skills to better use. However, not until 1964 would the additional two umpires rotate into the infield during the course of the Series. As of 2018, this is the only World Series the Yankees have won with Game 7 being in their home stadium. With the death of Red Schoendienst in 2018, this is the earliest World Series from which a player is still alive (Bobby Brown).

History  Two of the band members, vocalist Azahel and drummer Adonijah, were former members of a controversial death metal and thrash metal band, Possession that was active from 1992 to 1998. Frost Like Ashes was formed on the vision of guitarist, Sebat (formerly of World Funeral and Coven), who would recruit Azahel (vocals) and Syntyche (bass) in 2001 and begin what has become a hybrid of black metal and death metal. Adonijah (drums), completed the group and they were a part of a sampler for Tarantula Promotions, titled Arachnid Terror Sampler, which featured bands such as Soul Embraced, Tortured Conscience, Frosthardr, and Kekal in 2002, and released their first EP on SoTD Records in 2003. In January 2003, Qoheleth joined the band as their first full-time dedicated keyboardist. Up to this point Adonijah would compose and record the keyboard parts. In 2004, The band parted ways with Syntyche and acquired the skills of new bassist, Ruach. In 2005, after some delays, Frost Like Ashes' first full-length album, Tophet, was finally released. On March 13, 2008, Blabbermouth.net reported that the band signed a record deal with Sullen records, an imprint of Open Grave Records, for the release of the band's EP, titled Born to Pieces.Frost Like Ashes signs with Sullen Records March 13, 2008 . Blabbermouth.net The EP sold out shortly after its release, and a limited edition 7-inch vinyl was printed of Born to Pieces later. Fire, of the Polish black metal band Elgibbor, played bass for Frost Like Ashes at their Cornerstone Festival concert on July 3, 2008 to mark his full-time permanent membership in the band. They were working on a concept album based on a book vocalist Azahel. The album, tentatively titled Gods of the Great Whore, was put on-hold on January 2, 2009 until the book was written. They have written new material for another album, tentatively entitled Who Walks in the Darkness, and is to be based on a R. A. Salvatore novel, Homeland. In 2010, the band announced that they were going on hiatus. They have said they will make new music, but they don't see it happening right now. In 2017, Sebat formed a label, Nosral Recordings, and signed several bands. The label is re- releasing all of Frost Like Ashes' music and re-released Live in Omaha DVD. On February 24, 2019, it was announced the project would return to record a new album, with the lineup of Sebat on Guitars, Azahel on Vocals, Fire on Bass, Qoheleth on Keyboards, and new Drummer Grond, replacing the longtime member Adonijah. The band is currently signed with Rottweiler Records. On May 29, 2020, it was announced that Grond would no longer be continuing with the project and he would be replaced by the \\"Blastronaut\\". Names The band members use aliases in their albums and press to keep their identities secret, much like normal black metal, but the band's aliases have meanings behind them. Azahel is an alternative spelling of Asahel, a figure in the Bible, Fire is the translation of Bassist Jarek Pozarycki's name, Qoheleth means wisdom, Adonijah was the name of one of David's sons, and Sebat is Guitarist Michael Larson's \\"name\\". Though the band uses aliases, many of their names have become public knowledge.

The Braves had won the National League pennant for the first time since the \\"Miracle Braves\\" team of , while the Indians had spoiled a chance for the only all-Boston World Series by winning a one-game playoff against the Boston Red Sox for the American League flag. Though superstar pitcher Bob Feller failed to win either of his two starts, the Indians won the Series in six games to capture their second championship and their first since (as well as their last to the present date). It was the first World Series to be televised beyond the previous year's limited New York-Schenectady-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington network and was announced by famed sportcasters Red Barber, Tom Hussey (in Boston) and Van Patrick (in Cleveland). This was the second appearance in the Fall Classic for both teams, with the Indians' lone previous appearance coming in a 1920 win against the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Braves' lone previous appearance coming in a 1914 win against the Philadelphia Athletics. Consequently, this was the first, and to date only, World Series in which both participating teams had previously played in, but not yet lost, a previous World Series. Currently, this phenomenon can only be repeated if the Miami Marlins, the Washington Nationals or the Arizona Diamondbacks play against either the Toronto Blue Jays or the Los Angeles Angels in a future World Series. Television coverage of the World Series increased this year, but due to the medium still being in its infancy coverage was strictly regional. Games played in Boston could only be seen in the Northeast, while when the series shifted to Cleveland those games were the first to be aired in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Detroit and Toledo. This was the only World Series from to not to feature a New York team, and also the last World Series until not won by a New York team (which the Braves won over the Yankees, after they had relocated to Milwaukee). The teams would meet again in the 1995 World Series won by the Braves‚Äîby then relocated to Atlanta. This was the first World Series and the last until 2016 where the series score was even. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Johnny Sain Braves pitcher Johnny Sain and Indians pitcher Bob Feller were engaged in a scoreless pitchers' duel when the Braves came to bat in the bottom of the eighth inning. Feller walked Braves catcher Bill Salkeld to open the inning. Braves manager, Billy Southworth then replaced the slow-footed Salkeld with Phil Masi, who entered the game as a pinch runner. Mike McCormick followed with a sacrifice bunt, advancing Masi to second base. Feller issued an intentional walk to Eddie Stanky, who was replaced by Sibby Sisti. Feller then tried to pick off Masi at second base. Indians' shortstop Lou Boudreau appeared to tag Masi out, but umpire Bill Stewart called him safe. Tommy Holmes proceeded to hit a single that allowed Masi to score the only run of the game, giving the Braves a 1‚Äì0 victory. The umpire's controversial ruling touched off heated debates among the media and fans, especially after Associated Press photographs of the play were published. Although Feller allowed only two hits, he took the loss in what would be the closest he came to winning a World Series game. Upon his death in 1990, Masi's will revealed that he really was out on the pick-off play. Game 2 Bob Lemon The second game also made television history when a live broadcast of the Indians‚ÄìBraves matchup was shown aboard the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Marylander passenger train travelling between Washington, D.C. and New York City, using a receiver operated by Bendix Corporation technicians. An Associated Press reporter observing the demonstration said, \\"Technically, it was surprisingly good.\\" The Braves scored a run in the first off Bob Lemon on Bob Elliott's RBI single with two on, but Lemon held them scoreless for the rest of the game. After three shutout innings, Lou Boudreau hit a leadoff double in the fourth off Warren Spahn, then scored on Joe Gordon's single with Gordon advancing to second on the throw to home. One out later, Larry Doby's RBI single put the Indians up 2‚Äì1. Next inning, Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Boudreau's single. The Indians scored one more run in the ninth off Nels Potter when Jim Hegan reached on an error, moved to third on two groundouts and scored on Bob Kennedy's single. The series was tied 1‚Äì1 heading to Cleveland. Game 3 Gene Bearden For the third straight game, no home runs were hit by either team. This would not happen again in a World Series until . The game's two runs came on Larry Doby's groundout in the third after a double and walk and Jim Hegan's RBI single after a single and walk in the fourth, both off Vern Bickford. Gene Bearden pitched a complete shutout, allowing five hits while striking out four, as the Indians took a 2‚Äì1 series lead. Game 4 Larry Doby Steve Gromek of the Indians and Johnny Sain of the Braves pitched complete games each. The Indians struck first when Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff single in the first and scored on Lou Boudreau's double, then added to their lead on Larry Doby's home run in the third. Marv Rickert's leadoff home run in the seventh cut the Indians' lead to 2‚Äì1, but they held on to take a 3‚Äì1 series lead. Game 5 Warren Spahn Satchel Paige appeared for the Indians, becoming the first black pitcher to take the mound in World Series history. The previous day's single-game attendance record was broken with 86,288 fans. After two leadoff singles, Bob Elliott's three-run home run in the first off Indians starter Bob Feller made it 3‚Äì0 Braves. Dale Mitchell's leadoff home run in the bottom half off Nels Potter put the Indians on the board. Elliott's second home run of the game in the third made it 4‚Äì1 Braves, but in the fourth after a leadoff single and walk, Walt Judnich's RBI single made it 4‚Äì2 Braves, then one out later, Jim Hegan's three-run home run put the Indians in front 5‚Äì4 and knock Potter out of the game. Bill Salkeld's home run in the sixth tied the game. Next inning, Tommy Holmes hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Earl Torgeson's RBI single. Ed Klieman relieved Feller and allowed a walk, two-runs single to Marv Rickert, and another walk. Russ Christopher then allowed RBI singles to Mike McCormick and Eddie Stanky. Warren Spahn's sacrifice fly off Paige capped the game's scoring at 11‚Äì5. Spahn pitched 5 2/3 shutout innings of relief for the win, forcing a Game 6 in Boston. Game 6 Lou Boudreau The Indians struck first in Game 6 when Dale Mitchell hit a leadoff double in the third off Bill Voiselle and scored on Lou Boudreau's RBI double, but the Braves tied the game on Mike McCormick's RBI single with two on off Bob Lemon in the fourth. A walk loaded the bases, but Voiselle grounded out to end the inning. Joe Gordon's leadoff home in the sixth put the Indians back in front 2‚Äì1. After a one-out walk and single, Jim Hegan's RBI groundout extended their lead to 3‚Äì1. Three straight singles in the eighth by Ken Keltner, Thurman Tucker and Eddie Robinson made it 4‚Äì1 Indians. In the bottom of the inning, the Braves loaded the bases off Lemon on a single, double and walk. Clint Conatser's sacrifice fly and Phil Masi's RBI double off Gene Bearden made it 4‚Äì3 Indians, but Bearden pitched a scoreless ninth for the save to give the Indians the championship, currently their last.

This victory would start a record run of five straight World Series championships by the Yankees, and was also the first of 14 AL pennants in 16 years (1949‚Äì1964 except for 1954 and 1959) for the Yankees. Both teams finished the regular season with exactly the same records and winning their respective leagues by one game. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Tommy Henrich Don Newcombe of the Dodgers threw a complete game, five-hitter allowing only one run in a 1‚Äì0 losing effort. He struck out 11 Yankees during that game to tie the record for most strikeouts during a World Series game by a losing pitcher. Tommy Henrich led off the bottom of the ninth by tagging Newcombe for the first walk-off home run in World Series history. Game 2 Preacher Roe Preacher Roe pitched a six-hit shutout, getting the only run he needed early when Jackie Robinson doubled and Gil Hodges singled. Yankee Stadium came alive in the ninth with Joe DiMaggio's leadoff hit, but Roe retired the next three Yankees for the win, the second straight 1‚Äì0 result of the Series. Upon the completion of game 2, 1949 became the first World Series to contain multiple 1‚Äì0 games, a distinction only matched in 1966. Game 3 Joe Page In Game 3, the Yankees struck first in the third on Phil Rizzuto's sacrifice fly with two on off Ralph Branca, but Pee Wee Reese tied the game in the fourth on a home run off Tommy Byrne. In the ninth, two walks and a single loaded the bases with two outs, when Johnny Mize delivered a two-run pinch-hit single to right. Brooklyn starter Ralph Branca was then replaced by Jack Banta, who gave up an RBI single to Jerry Coleman that made it 4‚Äì1 Yankees. It seemed safe until Luis Olmo and Roy Campanella homered in the bottom of the ninth, but Joe Page hung on for the win after 5‚Öî innings in relief. Game 4 Bobby Brown Cliff Mapes broke a scoreless tie in the fourth inning with a two-run double off Don Newcombe. Yankee pitcher Eddie Lopat aided his own cause with an RBI double, and the advantage ballooned to 6‚Äì0 after a bases-loaded Bobby Brown triple scored three more in the fifth off Joe Hatten. Lopat pitched five scoreless innings before allowing two lead-off singles in the sixth. After a double play moved Pee Wee Reese to third, Jackie Robinson's RBI single put the Dodgers on the board. After a Gil Hodges single, RBI singles by Luis Olmo, Roy Campanella, and Gene Hermanski chased Lopat and cheered Ebbets Field's fans, bringing the Dodgers back to within 6‚Äì4. After that, though, Allie Reynolds held the home team hitless. Game 5 Vic Raschi A shaky start by Rex Barney. proved costly for Brooklyn. In the first, the Yankees loaded the bases on two walks and an error before Joe DiMaggio's sacrifice fly and Bobby Brown's RBI single put them up 2‚Äì0. In the third, the Yankees again loaded the bases on two walks and a single before a Jerry Coleman two-run single knocked Barney out of the game. Vic Raschi's RBI single off Jack Banta made it 5‚Äì0 Yankees. The Dodgers got on the board in the bottom half off Raschi when Roy Campanella doubled and scored on Pee Wee Reese's single, but the Yankees got that run back with a Joe DiMaggio home run in the fourth. Next inning, Gene Woodling hit a leadoff double and scored on two groundouts. In the sixth, after a walk and single off Carl Erskine, Yogi Berra's sacrifice fly made it 8‚Äì1 Yankees, then after a pop out, a Bobby Brown RBI triple aided by an error that allowed Brown himself to score extended their lead to 10‚Äì1. The Dodgers got a run in the bottom half on Gene Hermanski's RBI single after a double and walk. Next inning, after a one-out single and walk, Jackie Robinson's sacrifice fly made it 10‚Äì3 Yankees, then after another walk, Gil Hodges's three-run home run cut their lead to 10‚Äì6. However, Joe Page held the Dodgers scoreless for the rest of the game to give the Yankees the title.

The Yankees won in 6 games for their 5th consecutive title‚Äîa mark which has not been equalled‚Äîand their 16th overall. It was also the last of seven consecutive World Series wins by teams from the American League, the longest such streak for the AL in series history. Billy Martin recorded his 12th hit of the Series scoring Hank Bauer in Game 6\\\\. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Joe Collins Before a full house (69,734 in attendance), the Yankees scored four runs in the first inning. Brooklyn starter Carl Erskine did not last past the first. After a one-out walk, an RBI triple by Hank Bauer put the Yankees up 1‚Äì0. After a strikeout, two more walks loaded the bases before Billy Martin cleared them with a triple of his own and the Dodgers pinch-hit for Erskine in the top of the second. They did not score off Allie Reynolds until the fifth on a Jim Gilliam home run. Yogi Berra matched it in the bottom of the fifth with a home run of his own, and the Yankee lead looked safe until a leadoff home run by Gil Hodges and two-run home run by pinch-hitter George Shuba chased Reynolds in the sixth. Brooklyn tied it an inning later against Johnny Sain with consecutive leadoff singles by Roy Campanella, Hodges and Carl Furillo. A home run by unsung first baseman Joe Collins proved the game-winner off Clem Labine, with winning pitcher Johnny Sain providing two more runs himself in the eighth off Ben Wade with a two-run double. Sain then scored on a Joe Collins single, and pitched a scoreless ninth to give the Yankees a 9‚Äì5 win and 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 Eddie Lopat He looked shaky in the first, walking three, hitting a batter, and allowing a sacrifice fly to Yogi Berra for the game's first run, but Brooklyn's Preacher Roe settled down after that and engaged Eddie Lopat in a complete-game pitching duel. Billy Cox's two-run double after back-to-back two-out singles in the fourth inning put the Dodgers up 2‚Äì1. Billy Martin's leadoff home run off Roe in the seventh inning tied the score. The game-winning blast came from Mickey Mantle, a two-run shot to left field in the bottom of the eighth. Brooklyn got two runners aboard in the ninth, but Lopat was able to retire Duke Snider on a game-ending grounder to second base. Game 3 Carl Erskine Although the Yankees won the Series, Brooklyn had at least one shining moment, as pitcher Carl Erskine set a new Series record by striking out 14 Yankees in Game 3\\\\. That broke Howard Ehmke's record by one. Ersk's record would stand until Sandy Koufax got 15 in . In that same game, Yogi Berra was hit twice by Erskine, making him the first American League player in World Series history to be a hit-batsman twice during the same game. The Yankees struck first in the fifth on an RBI single by Gil McDougald with runners on second and third, but the Dodgers tied it in the bottom half on Billy Cox's fielder's choice with Jackie Robinson at third. Robinson's RBI single next inning put the Dodgers up 2‚Äì1, but again the game became tied at 2‚Äì2 in the eighth on an RBI single by the Yankees' Gene Woodling. The decisive blow came in the bottom of the inning when Vic Raschi surrendered a Roy Campanella home run, which proved to be the game-winner. Game 4 Duke Snider The home team won for the fourth consecutive time. Whitey Ford lasted just one inning as the Yankees' starter, allowing a leadoff ground-rule double to Jim Gilliam, who scored on Jackie Robinson's single. After a forceout, wild pitch and intentional walk, Duke Snider's two-run double made it 3‚Äì0 Dodgers. Gilliam's double in the fourth off Tom Gorman made it 4‚Äì0, but Brooklyn's lead was cut in half in the fifth when Billy Loes gave up a two-run home run to Gil McDougald. Snider's leadoff home run in the sixth off Johnny Sain made it 5‚Äì2 Dodgers, then after a double and single, Gilliam's sacrifice fly extended that lead to 6‚Äì2. Next inning, after a two-out walk, Snider's RBI double off Art Schallock made it 7‚Äì2 Dodgers. In the ninth, two singles and walk loaded the bases with no outs for the Yankees. Clem Labine relieved Loes and got two-outs before Mickey Mantle's RBI single cut the Dodgers' lead to 7‚Äì3, but Billy Martin was thrown out trying to score from second base to end the game, tying the series 2‚Äì2. Game 5 Mickey Mantle Yankees manager Casey Stengel gave the ball to Jim McDonald for Game 5 and, while he gave up a dozen hits, he got them a win. Brooklyn starter Johnny Podres was jolted by a Gene Woodling home run to begin the game. After the Dodgers tied the game in the second on two singles followed by shortstop Phil Rizzuto's throwing error on Carl Furillo's ground ball, Podres was chased in a five-run third. Rizzuto drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on two groundouts, and scored on when first baseman Gil Hodges misplayed Joe Collins's groundball. A hit-by-pitch and walk loaded the bases, and the first man Podres's replacement Russ Meyer faced was Mickey Mantle, who greeted him with a grand slam. Duke Snider's RBI single after a hit-by-pitch and single made it 6‚Äì2 Yankees in the fifth, but in the seventh, Billy Martin's two-run home run off Russ Meyer extended their lead to 8‚Äì2. Rizzuto singled with two outs and scored on McDonald's double. The Yankees added another run in the eighth when Collins hit a leadoff double off Ben Wade, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Yogi Berra's sacrifice fly, but in the bottom of the inning McDonald allowed two singles, then an RBI single to Furillo before a three-run Billy Cox home run cut their lead to 10‚Äì6. He was relieved by Bob Kuzava, who struck out Dick Williams to end the inning. Each team got a run in the ninth on a home run, Gil McDougald for the Yankees off Joe Black and Jim Gilliam for the Dodgers off Kuzava. Allie Reynolds was brought in to retire Jackie Robinson for the final out. Game 6 Billy Martin In Game 6, after a walk, strikeout and single, Yogi Berra's ground-rule double put the Yankees up 1‚Äì0 in the first off Carl Erskine. After an intentional walk loaded the bases, an error on Billy Martin's ground ball made it 2‚Äì0 Yankees. Next inning, Gene Woodling's sacrifice fly after two leadoff singles made it 3‚Äì0 Yankees. Starter Whitey Ford pitched five shutout innings, but in the sixth, allowed a one-out double to Jackie Robinson, who stole third and scored on Roy Campanella's groundout. Down 3‚Äì1 in the ninth, Brooklyn rallied back on a Duke Snider walk followed by a Carl Furillo home run off Allie Reynolds. However, Yankee second baseman Billy Martin‚Äîwho made a game-saving catch in Game 7 of the 1952 World Series‚Äîagain ruined the Dodgers' dreams of a championship. In the bottom of the ninth, with a runner on second base, Martin drilled a Clem Labine sinker up the middle for a Series-winning RBI single. Aftermath Dropping their seventh Series without a victory, the Dodgers terminated manager Chuck Dressen's contract; Dressen was demanding two more years. Walter Alston took his place and managed the Dodgers for the next 23 seasons (1954‚Äì1976), leading them to four World Series championships in , , , and before being replaced by Tommy Lasorda, who would manage the team for 20 years himself (1976‚Äì1996).

Red Barber, Vin Scully's senior on the Dodgers' broadcast crew, was originally selected to work with Allen on NBC, but was removed from the Series due to a salary dispute with Gillette, which sponsored the broadcasts. Scully, at the age of 25, became the youngest man to broadcast a World Series game (a record that stands to this day).

The Giants swept the Series in four games to win their first championship since , defeating the heavily favored Indians, who had won an AL-record 111 games in the 154-game regular season (a record since broken by the 1998 New York Yankees with 114 and again by the 2001 Seattle Mariners with 116, tying the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the most wins in a season). \\"The Catch\\" occurred during Game 1 of this series, when Giants center fielder Willie Mays snared a long drive by Vic Wertz near the outfield wall with his back to the infield. Utility player Dusty Rhodes' had clutch hits in three of the four games, including a pinch- hit walk-off that won Game 1, barely clearing the right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Giants manager Leo Durocher, who had managed teams to three National League championships, won his only World Series title as a manager. The Giants, who moved west to San Francisco in 1958, did not win another World Series until 2010. This was the first time that the Indians had been swept in a World Series and the first time that the Giants had swept an opponent in four games (their 1922 sweep included a controversial tie game). Game 2 was the last World Series and playoff game at the Polo Grounds, and Game 4 was the last World Series and playoff game at Cleveland Stadium. The Indians' next World Series was in , a year after Jacobs Field opened. The NFL game between the Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions, scheduled for October 3 at Cleveland Stadium, was postponed to December 19. Background The Indians, by winning the American League pennant, kept the Yankees from having a chance to win their sixth straight series. The last time the Yankees had been absent from the World Series was 1948, when the Indians defeated the Boston Braves to win the championship. This was also the only World Series from 1949 to 1958 in which the Yankees did not participate. The Indians easily won the 1954 pennant on the strength of the American League's top pitching staff, leading the AL in team ERA at 2.72 and complete games with 77. Pitchers Early Wynn (23‚Äì11, 2.73 ERA) and Bob Lemon (23‚Äì7, 2.72 ERA) were in top form, with solid contributions from Mike Garcia (19‚Äì8, 2.64) and Art Houtterman (15‚Äì7, 3.35). Bob Feller, at age 35, could only make 19 starts, and finished at 13‚Äì3. Cleveland also had potent hitting, leading the AL in home runs (156) and finishing second in runs scored (746), although the team managed just 30 stolen bases in 63 attempts. Bobby √Åvila led the offense with 112 runs and a .341 batting average, while Larry Doby (.272, 32 HRs, 126 RBIs) and Al Rosen (.300, 24 HRs, 102 RBIs) provided the power. Catcher Jim Hegan made only four errors in 134 games and threw out 44% of would-be base stealers. The Giants entered the World Series with a top-flight pitching staff as well, with Johnny Antonelli (21‚Äì7, 2.30 ERA), Rub√©n G√≥mez (17‚Äì9, 2.88) and 37-year-old Sal \\"The Barber\\" Maglie (14‚Äì6, 3.26). The Giants relied more heavily on relief pitching with Hoyt Wilhelm (12‚Äì7, 2.10, 7 saves) and Marv Grissom (10‚Äì7, 2.35, 19 saves) rounding out a staff that led the NL in team ERA at 3.09 and shutouts with 17. Manager Leo Durocher used a solid, consistent lineup with all of his starters, except for the catching position, playing in at least 135 games. Willie Mays (.345, 41 HRs, 110 RBIs) led an offense that also featured Don Mueller (.342), Alvin Dark (.293, 98 runs), Hank Thompson (26 HRs, 86 RBIs) and pinch-hitter extraordinaire Dusty Rhodes (.341). SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Willie Mays Cleveland got on the board right away against Sal Maglie. Leadoff man Al Smith was hit by a pitch, Bobby √Åvila singled and Vic Wertz brought home both with a triple to right. Don Liddle and Marv Grissom held them scoreless for the rest of the game. Bob Lemon gave two back in the third on singles by Whitey Lockman and Alvin Dark, an RBI groundout by Don Mueller, a walk to Willie Mays and a Hank Thompson RBI single. Mays saved the day in the eighth after leadoff singles by Larry Doby and Al Rosen led to starting pitcher Maglie being lifted for Liddle. Wertz's drive to deep center field would have scored both if not for Mays' memorable catch. Wertz opened the 10th inning with another hard-hit ball in Mays‚Äô direction, which again would have required a great defensive play by the Giants' centerfielder but landed for a double.Mutual Broadcasting System radio broadcast, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbXGRQ31uX4&t;=1845s (Wertz thus ended his afternoon having gone 4-for-5 with three extra-base hits and batting in the Indians‚Äô two runs.) However, this potential 10th-inning rally was to no avail, as the Indians batted only 1-for-16 with runners in scoring position in the game, and went hitless (0-for-13) in such situations after Wertz‚Äôs two-run triple in the first inning.https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/NY1/NY1195409290.shtml Lemon went all the way for Cleveland, losing it in the 10th when Dusty Rhodes, pinch-hitting for Monte Irvin with two Giants on base, hit a walk-off home run. Game 2 Dusty Rhodes of the New York Giants rounds first base after hitting a home run during the seventh inning of the second game of the 1954 World Series. Once again, the visitors started quickly but could not hold their lead. Al Smith's leadoff home run off Johnny Antonelli put Cleveland up 1‚Äì0. Early Wynn preserved that lead, pitching four perfect innings, but in the fifth inning, Willie Mays walked and Hank Thompson singled, and Dusty Rhodes, again pinch- hitting for Monte Irvin, delivered an RBI single. Antonelli gave himself the go-ahead run by scoring Thompson on a groundout. New York had just four hits, but Rhodes padded the Giants' lead with a home run leading off the seventh. Their other hit came in the sixth on an Alvin Dark leadoff single. Antonelli walked six but struck out nine, pitching a complete game to give the Giants a 2‚Äì0 series lead. This would be the last postseason game at the Polo Grounds. Game 3 A huge crowd of 71,555 hoped to see Cleveland get its first win, but things did not go well for the home team. The Indians trailed 1‚Äì0 quickly when Whitey Lockman singled, took second on a groundout and scored on a hit by Willie Mays. The run was scored as unearned because of an error by shortstop George Strickland. With the bases loaded in the third, pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes hit a two-run single. An error by pitcher Mike Garcia on Davey Williams' bunt attempt gave the Giants another run to make it 4‚Äì0. The Giants added to their lead on RBI singles by Wes Westrum off of Art Houtteman in the fifth and by Mays off of Ray Narleski in the sixth. Ruben Gomez gave up just four hits and two runs (a Vic Wertz home run in the seventh and an error by shortstop Alvin Dark on a grounder by Al Smith), with knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm mopping up for the save. Game 4 Hank Thompson Cleveland's slim comeback chances took a beating as the Indians fell hopelessly behind, 7‚Äì0. The scoring started on a pair of Cleveland errors in the second inning. An RBI double by Mays in the third scored another run. The Giants' four-run fifth inning broke the game wide open. Starter Bob Lemon loaded the bases and was pulled for Hal Newhouser, who faced just two batters, giving up a walk to Thompson and two-run single to Irvin. The Giants added another run in the inning on Wes Westrum's sacrifice fly against Ray Narleski. A brief glimmer of hope for the home team came in the bottom of the fifth with a couple of Giants errors and a Hank Majeski three-run pinch-hit home run, but except for a meaningless RBI single by Rudy Regalado in the seventh off starter Don Liddle, the Indians got nothing more as Hoyt Wilhelm and Game 2 starter Johnny Antonelli came on in relief and the Giants completed a four-game sweep. It was the most unexpected sweep in World Series history with the Indians having a better regular reason record by 14 games. The only other similar discrepancy in a World Series sweep was the 1990 Cincinnati Reds who swept an Oakland A's team whose regular season record bested theirs by 12 games.

Centers then played for the Washington Redskins (1999‚Äì2000), Buffalo Bills (2001‚Äì2002), and finally was a member of the New England Patriots for their second Super Bowl win, in 2003. One of the most prolific pass catching running backs in NFL history, Centers topped 100 receptions in 1995 and had 99 receptions in 1996. He owns the NFL record for most passes caught by a running back during a career. He was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1995, 1996, and 2001. Early life Centers was born in Tyler, Texas and grew up in Longview. He began playing little league football for the Bramlette Bears as a running back and quarterback during his elementary school years and went on to play in middle school for the Forest Park Eagles and high school for the Longview Lobos until his junior year. He played on both sides of the ball as a defensive back and runnningback and wide receiver. Centers did not play football at all his junior year of high school. After his family moved to nearby Tatum, where his mother was an administrator in education, Centers decided to play football again after being urged to do so by his elder brother. After a solid season in Tatum, he earned a scholarship to nearby Stephen F. Austin State University. He was also recruited by Baylor, Texas Tech, and several junior colleges. His brother, Donnie, played for the University of Arkansas and coach Lou Holtz as a wide receiver. College career After being recruited as a running back, wide receiver, and a defensive back, Centers began his college football career with the Division I-AA Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks as a wide receiver. As a freshman, he broke his pinky finger on his left hand and was then assigned to play scout team running back and special teams. In his sophomore season against Nevada, an injury to the team's starting running back allowed Centers a chance to play. In the win, Centers rushed nine times for 96 yards and finished the season with 100-plus rushing yards in each of the remaining six games. He also led the Lumberjacks in receptions, rushing yards and yards from scrimmage during his junior and senior years. Centers was a two-time all- Southland Conference pick and set a school record for rushing yards in his senior season. In 1989, with Centers as their starting running back, the Lumberjacks advanced to the 1989 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game where they lost by a field goal to the Georgia Southern Eagles. Professional career=Phoenix/Arizona Cardinals After graduating from Stephen F. Austin State University, Centers was drafted by the Phoenix Cardinals in the fifth round of the 1990 NFL Draft. He saw limited playing time in his first two seasons, as head coach Joe Bugel had doubts on his ability to carry the ball and thought of him as a third-down running back. According to his coaches, Centers particularly needed work on his pass protection skills and he spent an entire off-season mastering the capability. His playing time started to increase and by 1992, Centers rushed for 139 yards and caught 50 passes for 417 yards. On October 4, 1992, Centers scored the winning touchdown against the Washington Redskins with less than a minute remaining to break an 11-game Cardinals losing streak. The game-winning touchdown was the first of Centers' NFL career. The role of the fullback as a ball carrier was starting to diminish as the NFL game evolved during the 1990s. Yet, Centers's offensive numbers only increased as the years went by, especially his receptions and his leadership ability. He caught 66 passes in his fourth NFL season. In 1994, Bugel was fired and replaced by Buddy Ryan. Ryan allowed Centers more opportunity to run with the ball, carrying the ball a career-high 115 times while catching 77 receptions. In 1995, Centers had one of the greatest seasons ever of any modern day fullback, recording 101 receptions for 962 yards. He became the first runningback to record 100 receptions. He held the record for most receptions by a running back with 101 until this record was broken by Matt Forte in 2014 with 102. He also rushed for 254 yards, scored four touchdowns, and was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time. Unfortunately, his team was not successful despite his contributions; they finished the 1995 season with a 4-12 record and Ryan was fired at the end of the year and replaced by Vince Tobin. In 1996, Centers recorded 99 receptions for 766 yards and seven touchdowns, while also gaining a career-high 425 yards on 116 carries, and he scored two touchdowns on the ground. He was selected to the Pro Bowl for the second year in a row, but once again his team had a disappointing season, finishing with a 7-9 record. Centers became a free agent after the season. Both the Washington Redskins and the New York Giants were interested in his services, but ultimately he signed a three-year, $7.5 million contract to stay with the Cardinals after switching agents, becoming the fifth highest paid running back in the league. After previously leading the team in receptions the last four seasons, the Cardinals started to try Centers in different offensive formations at wide receiver. Centers continued to be a major contributor to the Cardinals, recording 123 receptions and 386 rushing yards over the next two seasons. In his final year with Arizona (1998), the team recorded a 9-7 record and made the playoffs as a wild card. The Cardinals made it all the way to the divisional playoffs before being eliminated in a 41-21 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Centers finished his Cardinals career as the team's all-time leading pass catcher. Washington Redskins Citing durability and salary cap concerns, the Cardinals released Centers on June 19, 1999. At the time of his release, Centers was considered \\"the heart and soul\\" of the Cardinals offense. He signed with the Washington Redskins and quickly became a team leader, recording 69 receptions in his first season with the team. During a crucial game against the 49ers, Centers caught a 33-yard touchdown pass in overtime, which made the Redskins the NFC Eastern division champs for the first time since 1991 and gave the team a playoff berth. The Redskins finished the regular season with a 10-6 record but were eliminated in the divisional playoffs by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 14-13. The following year, he caught 81 passes for 600 yards, rushed for 103 yards, and used his blocking to help running back Stephen Davis achieve star numbers, 1,318 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. He passed Keith Byars for most receptions by a running back. However, the Redskins recorded only an 8-8 record that year and did not make the playoffs. Buffalo Bills In 2001, Centers signed with the Buffalo Bills and made it to his third Pro Bowl appearance, catching 80 passes, this time for a total of 620 yards, with 160 yards rushing and four touchdowns. In the fourth quarter of a 23-20 loss against the Seattle Seahawks, he surpassed Ronnie Harmon's record for most receiving yards by an NFL running back with a two-yard reception. He also surpassed Hall of Famers Charlie Joiner and Michael Irvin to reach the top ten in all-time receptions by a player. New England Patriots After spending another year with Buffalo, Centers joined the Patriots in 2003. By this time, 35-year-old Centers' role as a receiver (along with ball carrier) had diminished. He was released after the sixth game of the season due to a knee injury, before re-signing with the Patriots in December. He recorded 19 receptions for 106 yards and rushed for 82 yards. Still, his blocking contributions as part of the Patriots offense allowed him to earn a Super Bowl ring; New England finished the season with a 14-2 record and went on to defeat the Carolina Panthers 32-29 in Super Bowl XXXVIII. Centers retired from professional football before the beginning of the 2004 season. NFL statistics In his 14 NFL seasons, Centers rushed for 2,188 yards, caught 827 passes for 6,797 yards, returned five punts for 30 yards, returned 33 kickoffs for 617 yards and scored 42 touchdowns (14 rushing/28 receiving). Centers's 827 receptions are currently the most by any running back and were the most by any non-wide receiver in NFL history, until tight end Tony Gonzalez surpassed this mark in 2008. He caught passes in 128 consecutive games, at one point the third longest streak in the NFL. When Centers retired, he was 7th in passes caught in league history. Because NFL fullbacks are now almost exclusively used as blockers, Centers is widely recognized as one of the greatest pass receiving fullbacks ever.

It would be the only Series the Dodgers won while based in Brooklyn, as the team relocated to Los Angeles after the . This was the fifth time in nine years that the Yankees and the Dodgers met in the World Series, with the Yankees having won in , , , and ; the Yankees would also win in the rematch. This Series also marked the end of a long period of invulnerability for the Yankees in the World Series. It was the Yankees' first loss in a World Series since and only their second since . While the Yankees were 15‚Äì2 in Series appearances during that time, they would lose again in , , , and , for a record of 4‚Äì5 in World Series over the next decade. Background This was the sixth World Series contested between the Yankees and Dodgers; the Yankees had won each of the five prior matchups (1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, and 1953). New York manager Casey Stengel had played for the Dodgers from 1912 through 1917. Brooklyn Dodgers The NL champion Dodgers finished the regular season with a record of 98‚Äì55, games ahead of the Milwaukee Braves. Offensive team leaders were Duke Snider (.309 batting average, 42 home runs, 136 RBIs, .628 slugging percentage, and 1.046 OPS) and Roy Campanella (.318 batting average, 32 home runs, 107 RBIs, .583 slugging percentage, and .978 OPS). Pitcher Don Newcombe led the team in wins, with a 20‚Äì5 record, and innings pitched. Campanella was voted the National League MVP, narrowly edging Snider. New York Yankees The AL champion Yankees finished the regular season with a record of 96‚Äì58, three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians. Offensive team leaders were Mickey Mantle (.306 batting average, 37 home runs, 99 RBIs, .611 slugging percentage, and 1.042 OPS), Yogi Berra (.272 batting average, 27 home runs, 108 RBIs, .470 slugging percentage, and .819 OPS), and Bill Skowron (.319 batting average). Pitcher Whitey Ford led the team in wins, with an 18‚Äì7 record, and innings pitched. Berra was voted the American League MVP, while Mantle finished fifth. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Jackie Robinson In Game 1, Carl Furillo's leadoff home run in the second off Whitey Ford put the Dodgers up 1‚Äì0. Jackie Robinson then tripled with one out and scored on Don Zimmer's single, but in the bottom of the inning, after a walk, rookie Elston Howard, in his first World Series at bat, homered to tie the game off Don Newcombe. Duke Snider's leadoff home run next inning put the Dodgers back in front 3‚Äì2 (which would eventually help establish a new HR record for a seven-game series at 17), but in the bottom half, the Yankees again tied the score on Irv Noren's RBI groundout with runners on second and third. Joe Collins's leadoff home run next inning put the Yankees ahead 4‚Äì3. His two-run home run in the sixth extended their lead to 6‚Äì3. In the seventh, after a single and error by third baseman Gil McDougald put runners on second and third with one out, Zimmer's sacrifice fly scored a run, then Robinson stole home to cut the Yankees' lead to 6‚Äì5, but Ford pitched eight innings for the win while Bob Grim earned the save with a scoreless ninth to give the Yankees a 1‚Äì0 series lead. Game 2 Tommy Byrne In Game 2, Pee Wee Reese lead off the top of the fourth with a triple and scored on Duke Snider's single off Tommy Byrne, but in the bottom of the inning, after a two-out single and walk, back-to-back RBI singles by Elston Howard and Billy Martin tied the game. After a hit-by-pitch loaded the bases, Byrne's two-run single put the Yankees up 4‚Äì1 and knock starter Billy Loes out of the game. The Dodgers got a run in the fifth on Jim Gilliam's RBI single with Jackie Robinson at third, but could not score again off Byrne, who pitched a complete game to give the Yankees a 2‚Äì0 series lead heading to Brooklyn. Game 3 Roy Campanella In Game 3, Roy Campanella's two-run home run after a walk off Bob Turley in the first put the Dodgers up 2‚Äì0, but in the second, Mickey Mantle, who only played in 3 games in this series,https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1955_WS.shtml hit his only home run of the series. Bill Skowron then doubled and scored on Phil Rizzuto's two-out single to tie the game. In the bottom of the inning, two singles and a hit-by-pitch loaded the bases before walks to Jim Gilliam off Turley and Pee Wee Reese off Tom Morgan put the Dodgers up 4‚Äì2. In the fourth with two on, Campanella's RBI single and Carl Furillo's sacrifice fly extended the Dodgers' lead to 6‚Äì2. In the top of the seventh, Rizzuto walked with two outs and scored on Andy Carey's triple, but in the bottom half, Jackie Robinson doubled with one out off Tom Sturdivant and scored on Sandy Amoros's single. After a forceout and walk, Reese's RBI single extended the Dodgers' lead to 8‚Äì3. Johnny Podres pitched a complete game as the Dodgers cut the Yankees' series lead to 2‚Äì1. This was the last World Series game to be played in the month of September. Game 4 Clem Labine Gil McDougald's one-out home run in the first off Carl Erskine put the Yankees up 1‚Äì0. In the second, Joe Collins drew a leadoff walk, moved two bases on two groundouts, and scored on Phil Rizzuto's single. In the third, Sandy Amoros drew a leadoff walk off Don Larsen and scored on Jim Gilliam's RBI double. In the top of the fourth, after a leadoff walk and single, Don Bessent relieved Erksine and allowed an RBI single to Billy Martin, but in the bottom of the inning, Roy Campanella hit a leadoff home run and after a single, Gil Hodges's two-run home run put the Dodgers up 4‚Äì3. Duke Snider's three-run home run next inning off Johnny Kucks extended their lead to 7‚Äì3. In the top of the sixth, Elston Howard hit a leadoff single off Clem Labine and scored on Billy Martin's double. One out later, Eddie Robinson's RBI single cut the Dodgers' lead to 7‚Äì5, but the Dodgers added a run in the seventh on three consecutive leadoff singles by Campanella, Carl Furillo and Gil Hodges off Rip Coleman. Labine earned the win with innings to close as the Dodgers tied the series with an 8‚Äì5 win. Game 5 Duke Snider Sunday, October 2, 1955, at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, New York In Game 5, Sandy Amoros's two-run homer in the second off Bob Grim put the Dodgers up 2‚Äì0. Next inning, Duke Snider's lead off home run made it 3‚Äì0. The Yankees got on the board in the fourth on Billy Martin's RBI single with two off rookie Roger Craig, but Snider's second home run of the game in the fifth gave the Dodgers that run back. Home runs by Bob Cerv in the seventh off Craig and Yogi Berra in the eighth off Clem Labine cut the Dodgers' lead to 4‚Äì3, but Brooklyn added an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth off Bob Turley when Carl Furillo hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Jackie Robinson's single. Laine pitched innings in relief for Craig, who won his first World series start, for the save as the Dodgers were one win away from the championship. Snider became the only player from either league with four home runs in two different Series. Game 6 Whitey Ford In Game 6, the Yankees scored all five of their runs in the first off Karl Spooner. After two walks, back-to-back RBI singles by Yogi Berra and Hank Bauer put them up 2‚Äì0 before Bill Skowron capped the scoring with a three-run home run. Whitey Ford pitched a complete game, allowing one run (on Carl Furillo's RBI single in the fourth) and four hits as the Yankees forced a Game 7 with a 5‚Äì1 win. Game 7 Johnny Podres The Dodgers scored the game's only runs on a fourth inning RBI single and sixth inning bases-loaded sacrifice fly, both by Gil Hodges. The RBIs by Hodges were set up by a double by Roy Campanella in the fourth and a lead-off single by Pee Wee Reese in the sixth ‚Äî the only time a Dodgers lead-off hitter reached base in any inning. While Campanella scored on Hodges' two-out single, Reese had advanced to third on two bunts. While being shut out by Johnny Podres, the Yankees, meanwhile, scattered eight hits over the six innings in which they were not retired in order. They only mustered one hit with runners in scoring position, though, which ironically was a basehit awarded to Gil McDougald in the third inning, when Phil Rizzuto was hit by a groundball while running the bases. Instead of batting in Rizzuto for a 1‚Äì0 Yankees lead, McDougald was thus ruled out to end the inning. Psychologically this may have marked a turning point for the Dodgers, who had never beaten the Yankees in a World Series. Pitcher Carl Erskine saw this play as \\"an omen\\", as such unfortunate miscues had usually been \\"the things that happened to us.\\"Cohen, Aaron; Oliver, Charles. Dodgers: Ghosts of Flatbush HBO, July 11, 2007. Retrieved October 6, 2020. The Yankees would have three more scoring opportunities against Podres: In the fourth inning, a lead-off double by Yogi Berra was wasted. Then, in the sixth inning, with runners on first and second and one out, left fielder Sandy Amor√≥s made a dramatic game-saving catch of a deep fly ball down the left field line off the bat of Yogi Berra to start a double play. Amor√≥s then threw to Pee Wee Reese and Reese relayed to Gil Hodges, who tagged Yankee Gil McDougald before McDougald could get back to first. This possibly stymied the Yankees' best chance of the day. The Yankees would threaten Podres one last time, when McDougald couldn't bring a runner in from third with only one out, hitting a short flyball to rightfield, one inning before Elston Howard grounded out to Reese for the final out; the two shared the dubious record for playing in the most losing World Series (six each). This would be the only time in Jackie Robinson's career when he did not play in his team's World Series game. Don Hoak replaced Robinson in the line-up, and played third base. For the first time in Series history, an MVP was selected‚ÄîJohnny Podres, winning pitcher of Games 3 and 7. He was 2‚Äì0, both wins being complete games including the series-clinching Game 7 shutout, and had a 1.00 ERA.

After finishing just one game behind the N.L. Champion Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956, the Braves came back in 1957 to win their first pennant since moving from Boston in 1953. The Braves won the Series in seven games, behind Lew Burdette's three complete game victories. The Braves would be the only team besides the Yankees, Dodgers, or Giants to win a World Series title in the 1950s. The Yankees had home field advantage in the series. Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 were played at Yankee Stadium, while Milwaukee County Stadium hosted Games 3, 4, and 5. This was the first time since 1946 that the Series included scheduled off days after Games 2 and 5. Of the previous ten World Series, the Yankees had participated in eight of them and won seven. This was also the first World Series since 1948 that a team from New York did not win. This is the first of four Yankees-Braves matchups, and the only Series that was won by the Braves; they lost in , and , with the last two instances occurring with the Braves based in Atlanta. Hank Aaron led all regulars with a .393 average and 11 hits, including a triple, three home runs and seven RBI. As of April 2015, four original television broadcasts from this Series (Games 1, 3, 5 and 6) had been released on DVD. Summary Milwaukee's County Stadium Note: It was the Braves' first championship since the \\"Miracle Braves\\" of 1914. Matchups=Game 1 Whitey Ford In the third inning, the Yankees replaced first baseman Bill Skowron, who was complaining of back pain, with Elston Howard. In the fifth inning the Braves had a runner in scoring position after an error by Howard. The Braves did not manage to capitalize on this opportunity, as second baseman Red Schoendienst grounded out. By the end of the fifth inning, the Braves had left four men on base, with the score still scoreless. The Yankees broke through that inning with a leadoff single by Jerry Coleman, followed by two ground outs which moved the runner to third base, and then a triple by slugger Hank Bauer making the score 1‚Äì0. After three consecutive batters reached first base in the Yankees' half of the sixth inning, and a run scored on Andy Carey's single, Milwaukee manager Fred Haney pulled starter Warren Spahn and replaced him with Ernie Johnson. The Yankees scored once more in the sixth inning when Coleman executed a squeeze play, allowing Yogi Berra to score from third base. The Braves managed to score only once, when Wes Covington scored in the seventh on a single by Schoendienst. Whitey Ford pitched a complete game for the Yankees. Game 2 Johnny Logan Hank Aaron led off the second inning with a triple, then made it safe at home on Joe Adcock's single. The Yankees responded with one of their own in the bottom half of the second. Again in the third inning, the Yankees and Braves each scored one run, leaving the score 2‚Äì2 heading to the fourth inning. Both managers were worried about their starting pitchers, and after three straight singles from Adcock, Andy Pafko, and Wes Covington and with two runs in, Yankees manager Casey Stengel replaced Bobby Shantz with reliever Art Ditmar. Ditmar had finished the regular season with an 8‚Äì3 record, a 3.25 ERA and six saves. Ditmar was able to prevent the Braves from scoring any more runs, but the score was 4‚Äì2 in favor of the Braves. After that, Braves starter Lew Burdette's pitching improved significantly. He only gave up four hits for the rest of the game, two of them coming in the ninth inning. After a ground out, Tony Kubek singled to right to start things off. Stengel decided to pinch hit lefty Joe Collins, who was 30‚Äìfor‚Äì149 (.201) that year and was playing what turned out to be his final year, for the right-handed Coleman, who was a better 42‚Äìfor‚Äì157 (.263) and also playing in his final season, to face right- handed pitcher Burdette. Collins popped to Johnny Logan at shortstop for the second out. Then, Stengel again opted to pinch hit for the pitcher, Bob Grim. Howard came up in his spot and singled to advance Kubek to second. Bobby Richardson pinch ran for Howard. Burdette recorded the final out as he got Bauer, the next batter, to ground to short, where Logan forced out Richardson. The Braves' win in Game 2 was the first World Series game won by a non-New York City team since 1948. In every World Series between 1948 and 1957, either both teams were from New York City or a New York City team won in a sweep (1950 and 1954). Game 3 Tony Kubek New York's Tony Kubek began the scoring with a one-out solo homer in the first inning. After that, things quickly fell apart for Bob Buhl, who had pitched quite well in the regular season (18‚Äì7, 2.74 ERA). He walked Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra, then made an error attempting to pick Mantle off at second base. After a sacrifice fly by Gil McDougald and a single by first baseman Harry Simpson, manager Fred Haney pulled Buhl and brought in rookie Juan Pizarro. Pizarro got the final out in the first inning, and followed that with a solid second inning. In the third inning, however, the Yankees began to capitalize on their lead. After allowing hits from Mantle, Berra and Jerry Lumpe, and a walk to Elston Howard, who was pinch-hitting for Harry Simpson, Pizarro was removed from the game. Gene Conley was called in to finish the inning. He did get the last two outs, but gave up a two-run home run to Mantle in the fourth inning. By the bottom of the fifth inning, the score was 7‚Äì1 in favor of the Yankees. Logan led off with a single, and Eddie Mathews flied to left. Hank Aaron hit one of his three postseason homers to make the game 7‚Äì3. After a Covington walk, Joe Adcock and Bob Hazle each made outs to end the fifth. Yankees relief pitcher Don Larsen had his comfortable lead cut down to just four runs. In the seventh inning the Yankees secured their lead with a five-run inning against reliever Bob Trowbridge. The five runs started with a two-run bases-loaded single by Bauer and a three-run home run by Kubek. The score was 12‚Äì3 heading in to the bottom of the seventh. There was only one more hit the rest of the game, a single by Aaron in the ninth. Del Crandall made the last out and the series was on to Game 4 with the Yankees up 2‚Äì1. Left fielder Kubek was only the second rookie in history to hit two home runs in a World Series game. This was the first World Series game played in the state of Wisconsin. Game 4 Eddie Mathews After a game with two homers and four RBIs, Tony Kubek led off the first inning for the Yankees. Kubek bunted, which ultimately led to a run after Mickey Mantle reached on a fielder's choice, Yogi Berra walked, and Gil McDougald singled. The second inning started with a single by Hank Aaron and then a stolen base by Wes Covington, but they could not convert. The fourth inning began with a walk to Johnny Logan. Eddie Mathews doubled to right field, which sent Logan to third. Aaron then hit a three-run home run which completely cleared the stadium. The next batter, Covington, grounded out. This was followed by a shot off the bat of Frank Torre, a part-time first baseman who was giving Joe Adcock a day off. The Braves were then up 4‚Äì1 against Yankees starter Tom Sturdivant. The next four innings for the Yankees were plagued by double plays. Warren Spahn was getting ground out after ground out and the Yankees looked helpless until the ninth. With two outs and a three-run deficit in the top of the ninth, New York found new life in two back-to-back singles. Spahn gave up one to Berra, followed by one to McDougald. With two runners on, Howard hit a three-run homer to tie the game. Left-handed Tommy Byrne had replaced right-handed Johnny Kucks in the eighth inning for New York. This prompted Haney to pinch hit Adcock for Torre. Adcock grounded to shortstop and Milwaukee went 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 that inning. The game thus went on to extra innings. Milwaukee starter Spahn came out for the tenth. Kubek got his second hit in the top of the tenth, followed by a triple by Hank Bauer to score a run. After Mantle flied to right, the Braves got ready for the bottom of the tenth down one. Spahn was due up first for the Braves, and Haney opted to pinch hit with Nippy Jones, who had played in just 30 games that year. In what turned out to be his final appearance, Jones was part of a pivotal play in the inning. A wild Tommy Byrne pitch bounced near Jones, but umpire Donatelli initially called a ball. After an argument hinging on a spot of shoe polish on the baseball, Jones convinced umpire Augie Donatelli that he was hit on the shoe. The inning continued with Felix Mantilla running for Jones. Red Schoendienst hit a sacrifice bunt to advance Mantilla, who scored the tying run on a double by Logan. Mathews followed with a towering two-run home run to win it for the Braves, 7‚Äì5, and tied the series at two games apiece. Game 5 Joe Adcock With the opposing teams' top pitchers, Whitey Ford and Lew Burdette, facing each other, Game 5 was expected to be a low-scoring affair. However, the game started out with the Yankees looking to score in the first inning. After a leadoff single by Hank Bauer and a sacrifice bunt by Tony Kubek, Gil McDougald hit a line drive that turned into the second out of the inning. Yogi Berra then grounded out. After that, Burdette only allowed multiple Yankee baserunners in the fourth inning. At the start of the sixth inning, the game was still scoreless. In the bottom of the sixth with two outs and nobody on, Eddie Mathews, Hank Aaron, and Joe Adcock singled, scoring Mathews and giving the Braves a 1‚Äì0 lead that held up for the rest of the game. The Yankees' best scoring chance came in the eighth inning after a hit by Jerry Coleman to right field. Mickey Mantle came in to pinch-run for Coleman, but was caught stealing at second base by catcher Del Crandall. Ford was then taken out and Yankee reliever Bob Turley came in, striking out two batters while giving up no hits in the inning. Yogi Berra made the last Yankee out in the 1‚Äì0 complete-game by Burdette, and the Milwaukee Braves took the series lead three games to two. Game 6 Hank Aaron Bob Buhl started for the Braves but did not last very long. In the first two innings, no one scored, although there were some opportunities, including the Yankees' first inning when Enos Slaughter reached third and Yogi Berra got to second on Buhl's wild pitch. Buhl struck out Gil McDougald to end the inning. In the bottom of the third, the Yankees scored two runs to take the lead on a Berra two-run homer, scoring Slaughter. After that Ernie Johnson replaced Buhl. Johnson then held the Yankees scoreless until the seventh inning. The Braves cut the lead in their half in the fifth on Frank Torre's home run, his second of the series. The Braves then tied it in the top of the seventh with a homer by Hank Aaron, his third. The game was now tied and Braves' pitcher Johnson was holding the Yankees to just one hit in 3‚Öì innings. Leading off the seventh, pitcher Bob Turley was out on a bunt attempt with two strikes. Then, right fielder Hank Bauer hit a home run off the left-field foul pole to give the Yankees a one-run lead. In the Braves' ninth, after an Eddie Mathews walk, Turley got lefty Wes Covington to ground into a 1‚Äì6‚Äì3 double play to end the game and force a deciding Game 7\\\\. Game 7 Lew Burdette Lew Burdette was called in to start game 7 for the Braves on two days' rest when the expected starter, Warren Spahn, was struck with the Asian flu. After two scoreless innings, the Braves broke through in the third, started by a Bob Hazle single and an error by Tony Kubek at third base; one of three Yankee errors in the game. The inning continued with a hard-hit Eddie Mathews double, which prompted Casey Stengel to take out starter Don Larsen and bring in lefty Bobby Shantz. Shantz then gave up an RBI single to Hank Aaron and a single by Wes Covington advancing Aaron to third. Frank Torre grounded into a fielders' choice which scored Aaron. Felix Mantilla then flied to Hank Bauer in right to end the inning, ending the Braves' scoring at four runs. The Yankees' best chance came in the sixth, when they had runners on first and second with two outs after a Mickey Mantle single and an error by Mathews at third. Gil McDougald then grounded out forcing Mantle at third to end the inning and the threat. In the ninth, after Milwaukee made it 5‚Äì0 on a Del Crandall homer, the Yankees attempted to mount a rally. With two outs and McDougald on first base, Jerry Coleman singled to right. Then, Tommy Byrne singled to load the bases for Bill Skowron. With the tying run on deck, Burdette retired Skowron on a ground out to third with Mathews making the final out. In the game, the Yankees were limited to seven hits and one walk. Burdette was named the Series MVP after pitching three complete games and two shutouts. He was the first pitcher since Christy Mathewson to pitch two shutouts in a World Series. Despite the Yankees having made 17 more appearances in the World Series since this one, this game to date is the most recent time that the team has hosted a World Series Game 7.

The Series was played against the backdrop of World War I, which dominated the American newspapers that year and next. The strong Chicago White Sox club had finished the 1917 season with a 100‚Äì54 record: their only one- hundred-win season in franchise history as of 2019. The Sox's next World Series winner in 2005 would finish the regular season with a 99‚Äì63 record. The Sox won Game 1 of the Series in Chicago 2‚Äì1 behind a complete game by Eddie Cicotte. Happy Felsch hit a home run in the fourth inning that provided the winning margin. The Sox beat the Giants in Game 2 7‚Äì2 behind another complete game effort by Red Faber to take a 2‚Äì0 lead in the Series. Back in New York for Game 3, Cicotte again threw a complete game, but the Sox could not muster a single run against Giants' starter Rube Benton and lost 2‚Äì0. In Game 4 the Sox were shut out again 5‚Äì0 by Ferdie Schupp. Faber threw another complete game, but the Series was even at 2‚Äì2 going back to Chicago. Reb Russell started Game 5 in Chicago, but only faced three batters before giving way to Cicotte. Going into the bottom of the seventh inning, Chicago was down 5‚Äì2, but they rallied to score three in the seventh and three in the eighth to win 8‚Äì5. Faber pitched the final two innings for the win. In Game 6 the Sox took an early 3‚Äì0 lead and on the strength of another complete game victory from Faber (his third of the Series) won 4‚Äì2 and clinched the World Championship. Eddie Collins was the hitting hero, batting .409 over the six game series while Cicotte and Faber combined to pitch 50 out of a total 52 World Series innings to lead the staff. Heinie Zimmerman The decisive game underscored the Giants' post-season frustrations, featuring a famous rundown in which Giants' third baseman Heinie Zimmerman futilely chased the speedy Eddie Collins toward home plate with what would be the Series-winning run. Catcher Bill Rariden had run up the third base line to start a rundown, expecting pitcher Rube Benton or first baseman Walter Holke to cover the plate. However, neither of them budged, forcing Zimmerman to chase Collins while pawing helplessly in the air with the ball in an attempt to tag him. Two years before the issue of baseball betting reached its peak, Zimmerman found himself having to publicly deny purposely allowing the run to score, i.e. to deny that he had \\"thrown\\" the game. In truth, McGraw blamed Benton and Holke for failing to cover the plate. A quote often attributed to Zim, but actually invented by writer Ring Lardner some years later, was that when asked about the incident Zim replied, \\"Who the hell was I supposed to throw to, Klem (umpire Bill Klem, who was working the plate)?\\" Conventional wisdom has it that Collins was much faster than Zimmerman, but existing photos of the play show that Zimmerman was only a step or two behind Collins, who actually slid across the plate while Zim jumped over him to avoid trampling him. Zimmerman would eventually be banned for life due to various accusations of corruption. The great athlete Jim Thorpe, better known for football in general, made his only World Series \\"appearance\\" during Game 5, where he was listed in the lineup card as starting in right field; but for his turn at bat in the top of the first inning he was replaced by a left- handed hitting Dave Robertson. The White Sox, who were essentially dismantled following the 1920 season by baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis due to the Black Sox Scandal in the 1919 World Series, did not make it to another World Series until , and did not win another World Series until . SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Fred McMullin drove in Chicago's first run, and Happy Felsch's homer made it 2‚Äì0. Giants pitcher Slim Sallee knocked in his side's only run with a single after a Lew McCarty triple. Game 2 Game 3 at the Polo Grounds, taken from left end of upper deck. Note rope to guide umpire on home run calls. Shoeless Joe Jackson's two-run single capped a five- run fourth inning for the White Sox, who knocked out Giants starter Ferdie Schupp in the second inning. Game 3 The home team won for the third straight time as the series moved to New York. The only runs of a snappy 1 hour, 55 minute game came on a Dave Robertson triple, Walter Holke double and a single by George Burns. Game 4 The first of a pair of homers by Giants center fielder Benny Kauff was an inside-the-park one that sailed over Sox center fielder Happy Felsch's head. The other came in the eighth off Chicago reliever Dave Danforth. Game 5 Even though Red Faber would start Games 4 and 6, he was brought in from the bullpen to close Game 5. Taking no chances, the Sox yanked starter Reb Russell after just three batters, all of whom reached base. A three-error third inning behind Eddie Cicotte put the Giants up 4‚Äì1. But after a game-tying rally in the seventh, the Sox won it in the eighth as Happy Felsch greeted reliever Pol Perritt with an RBI single. It was the fifth straight win by the home team in this Series. Game 6 A pair of errors proved costly to the Giants in a three-run fourth when Chick Gandil and Ray Schalk followed with RBI hits. New York's hopes rose with a Buck Herzog triple in the next inning that made it 3‚Äì2. But with the workhorse Faber holding the Giants at bay the rest of the way, the Sox got an insurance run in the ninth on hits by Buck Weaver and Nemo Leibold, and the Series was theirs. It would be their last championship until 2005. Composite box 1917 World Series (4‚Äì2): Chicago White Sox (A.L.) over New York Giants (N.L.)

Lannin, Ban Johnson, Joseph John Lannin and Hannah Furlong, his wife, at the 1916 World Series Robins manager Wilbert Robinson with Red Sox manager Bill Carrigan A scorebook from the 1916 World Series, depicting Red Sox owner Joseph Lannin, Red Sox manager Bill Carrigan, Dodgers owner Charles Ebbets, and Manager Wilbert Robinson In the 1916 World Series, the Boston Red Sox beat the Brooklyn Robins four games to one. It was the first World Series meeting between the teams. Casey Stengel shone on offense for the Robins in the 1916 Series, but the Red Sox pitching corps ultimately proved too much for the denizens of Flatbush. The Sox's Babe Ruth pitched 13 shutout innings in Game 2, starting a consecutive scoreless innings streak that would reach 29 in . As with the Series, the Red Sox played their home games at the larger Braves Field, and it paid off as they drew a then- record 43,620 people for the final game. Brooklyn fielded some strong teams under their manager and namesake Wilbert Robinson in the late 1910s. The Robins, also interchangeably called the Dodgers, would win the pennant again in 1920, but the American League teams were generally stronger during that interval. It would be 39 years before the Dodgers would win their first World Series title in . The two franchises met again in the postseason for the first time in 102 years in the 2018 World Series, 60 years after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles. The record for most innings played in a World Series game, set by Game 2 in 1916, at 14, was broken by Game 3 in 2018, at 18. Just like their first matchup in the World Series, the Red Sox would eventually go on to defeat the Dodgers in five games to win their ninth World Series championship. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Until the ninth, Boston starter Ernie Shore was in control. Holding a comfortable 6‚Äì1 lead, a walk, hit batter, error and bases-loaded walk to Fred Merkle finally forced the Red Sox to call on Carl Mays from the bullpen to preserve a 6‚Äì5 win. Game 2 The Robins scored in the top of the first on an inside-the-park home run by Hy Myers, and the Red Sox tied it in the bottom of the third, Ruth himself knocking in the run with a ground ball. The game remained 1‚Äì1 until the bottom of the 14th, when the Red Sox won it on a pinch-hit single by Del Gainer. The 14-inning game set a World Series record for longest game by innings. That mark was equaled in Game 3 of the 2005 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros, and then again in Game 1 of the 2015 World Series between the Kansas City Royals and New York Mets, before being broken in Game 3 of the 2018 World Series between the Red Sox and Dodgers. Game 3 A seventh-inning home run by Larry Gardner chased Brooklyn starter Jack Coombs and brought Boston to within one run. Jeff Pfeffer came through with 2‚Öî innings of hitless relief to save the victory for Coombs. Game 4 Brooklyn's first three batters reached safely off Dutch Leonard in a two-run first inning, but that's all the Dodgers would get. Larry Gardner's second home run in two days was an inside-the-park one to left-center that scored two teammates ahead of him, giving Leonard all he would need for the win. Game 5 The final game was over in a snappy 1 hour, 43 minutes. Ernie Shore threw a three-hitter. Boston scratched out a run on a walk, sacrifice bunt, ground- out and passed ball. The Red Sox added more in the third, thanks to an error and a Chick Shorten RBI single, and the fifth when Harry Hooper singled and scored on a Hal Janvrin double. Casey Stengel led off the Dodger ninth with a hit, but Shore allowed no more. For the second straight series, Red Sox pitching dominated, this time holding the Robins to a team .200 batting average, contributing to an easy 5-game victory.

In their only World Series before , the Phillies won Game 1 before being swept the rest of the way. It was 65 years before the Phillies won their next Series game. The Red Sox pitching was so strong in the 1915 series that the young Babe Ruth was not used on the mound and only made a single pinch-hitting appearance. Series arrangements Arrangements for the Series were made on October 2, 1915, in a meeting of the team owners, league presidents and the National Commission at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in midtown Manhattan, New York City. Red Sox owner Joseph Lannin lost the coin toss for home field advantage, and Phillies owner William F. Baker chose to have the first two games of the Series in Philadelphia. The league presidents selected the umpires, and it was announced that J. G. Taylor Spink would be one of the official scorers. One controversy surrounded the allocation of tickets to the Red Sox' Royal Rooters fan club. Each visiting team was allocated 200 tickets, but the Red Sox requested an additional 400 on behalf of their supporters. The Phillies' Baker Bowl sat only 20,000, and their above-cited owner, William Baker, refused to allocate additional tickets for visiting fans. The matter was resolved by National Commission chairman Garry Herrmann, who gave the Red Sox tickets from the Commission's own Series allocation. Series summary right The Phillies won Game 1 3‚Äì1, although The New York Times reporter Hugh Fullerton wrote of the future 300+ game-winning Hall of Famer, \\"[Grover Cleveland] Alexander pitched a bad game of ball. He had little or nothing\\" in his review of the game, headed \\"Nothing but luck saved the Phillies.\\" The Times also reported that a crowd of 10,000 gathered in Manhattan's Times Square to view a real-time mechanical recreation of the game on a giant scoreboard sponsored by the newspaper. The Phillies were not to win another postseason game until 1977, nor another World Series game until 1980. The Red Sox swept Games 2‚Äì5, all by one run, and by identical scores of 2‚Äì1 in Games 2‚Äì4. In Game 2, Woodrow Wilson became the first U.S. President to attend a World Series game. This was the second straight year that a Boston team beat a Philadelphia team in the World Series after the Braves had swept the Athletics the year before. Unlike the 1913 Series, where the home team won only one of the five games, home field was often very much an advantage in the 1915 October classic. Fenway Park, paradoxically the Braves' home field in their 1914 Series sweep of the A's while Braves Field was still being built, had been the home of the Red Sox for four seasons and was fully functional in 1915; yet the Red Sox played their 1915 Series \\"home\\" games in the brand-new Braves Field to take advantage of its larger seating capacity. Beyond the added revenue, the long ball was affected by this arrangement, as follows: *In the top of the third inning of Game 3 at Boston, with two out, one run in and two runners in scoring position, Phillies' slugger \\"Cactus\\" Gavvy Cravath hit a line drive to deep left field which was caught for a harmless inning-ending out in the spacious Braves Field outfield. In Fenway or Philadelphia's Baker Bowl, it might have been a home run or at least an extra-base hit which might have turned the Series around. *The Phillies had packed some extra outfield seats into their already-small bandbox of a ball-field, shortening the distance from home to the outfield wall even more. This proved crucial in the decisive Game 5, in which Boston's Harry Hooper twice homered over the moved- in center field fence and Duffy Lewis followed suit. In Braves Field, those would have been extra-base hits at best. Both of Hooper's hits, including the eventual game-winner in the top of the ninth, actually bounced over the fence and were home runs by the rules of that era although they would have been only ground-rule doubles by present-day rules. Summary Philadelphia team photo taken on October 4, 1915. Matchups=Game 1 Game 1 starting pitchers Ernie Shore (left) and Grover Cleveland Alexander (right). Alexander scattered eight hits, winning 3‚Äì1, in giving the Phillies their only win of the series. Game 2 Rube Foster pitched a 3-hitter, allowing no walks, and retiring the last 10 Phillies he faced, and helped his own cause with the game-winning RBI single in the top of the ninth. Game 3 Dutch Leonard and Grover Cleveland Alexander engaged in a classic pitcher's duel, Leonard retiring the last 20 Phillies to face him, winning 2‚Äì1 on an RBI single by Duffy Lewis in the bottom of the 9th. Game 4 Ernie Shore held the Phillies scoreless until the eighth inning, winning 2‚Äì1, giving the Red Sox a 3‚Äì1 series lead. Game 5 The Red Sox won on three home runs by two of their outfielders, two cheapies by Harry Hooper (see above) and one by Duffy Lewis. Fred Luderus homered for the Phillies only home run of the series in the bottom of the fourth inning. Those were the only round-trippers in the entire Series, the first four games being pitchers' duels. The Phillies were held to a weak .182 team batting average in the 5-game set.

In the 1914 World Series, the Boston Braves beat the Philadelphia Athletics in a four-game series. The \\"Miracle Braves\\" were in last place on July 4, then won the National League pennant by 10¬Ω games. The Braves' relatively unknown starting trio of pitchers, with a combined career record of 285‚Äì245, outperformed the Athletics vaunted rotation (929‚Äì654) in all four games. Hank Gowdy hit .545 (6 of 11) with five extra-base hits and also drew five walks for Boston in the series and was the difference maker in Games 1 and 3. Adding to their supposed disadvantages, the Braves arguably lacked a notable home-field advantage. They had abandoned their 43-year-old home field South End Grounds in August 1914, choosing to rent from the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park while awaiting construction of Braves Field (1915). Thus their home games in this Series were also at Fenway. This was the first four-game sweep in World Series history. The Cubs had defeated the Tigers four games to none in , but Game 1 had ended in a tie before the Cubs won the next four in a row. At least one publication, To Every Thing A Season by Bruce Kuklick, has suggested other factors that might have contributed to the sweep, noting that some of the A's may have been irritated at the penny-pinching ways of their manager/owner Connie Mack and thus did not play hard, and also noting the heavy wagering against Philadelphia placed by entertainer George M. Cohan through bookmaker Sport Sullivan, who was also implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Chief Bender and Eddie Plank jumped to the rival Federal League for the 1915 season. Mack unloaded most of his other high-priced stars soon after and, within two years, the A's achieved the worst winning percentage in modern history (even worse than the 1962 New York Mets or the 2003 Detroit Tigers).  Background  Because an AL team had won the last four World Series (the A's had represented the AL in three out of those four), the A's were heavily favored. That the Braves had been in last place in July before coming back to win the pennant contributed to the perception that the AL was simply superior to the NL. The A's roster boasted 5 future hall-of-famers and many agreed they were the better team on paper. A story told about Connie Mack during the 1914 season reflects this attitude among the A's that the Braves would be pushovers. That year, Mack gave star pitcher Chief Bender the week off and told him to scout the Braves personally. Instead, Bender took a vacation. When asked to defend his actions, he replied: \\"Why should I check out a bunch of bush league hitters?\\" Summary Fenway Park on October 12, 1914, for the third game of the 1914 World Series. Matchups Dick Rudolph Game 1 26-game winner Dick Rudolph scattered five hits while striking out eight as the Braves won the opener in convincing fashion against the Athletics ace, Chief Bender. Catcher Hank Gowdy had a single, double and triple as well as a walk in leading Boston's offensive attack. He was also on the back end of a double steal in the eighth inning, with Butch Schmidt's steal of home the Braves' final run. According to Tom Meany's 1950 book \\"Baseball's Greatest Teams\\", with one chapter on each of the then 16 major league teams' one most outstanding season in the author's opinion, the chapter on the Boston Braves was naturally on their one world championship year, 1914. Meany recalled that manager Stallings and the Braves showed utter contempt for Connie Mack's heavily favored A's by spurning the Shibe Park visiting clubhouse for the one in the National League Phillies' deserted home park, Baker Bowl (the NL site of the next World Series, which again featured Boston defeating Philadelphia, but this time Red Sox 4, Phillies 1). Meany may also have been the source for the sensational sidelight that Stallings' motive for this may have been the rumor that the A's may have sabotaged the Shibe Park visiting clubhouse (with war clouds gathering in Europe as World War I was just beginning). Game 2 Bill James, Boston's other 26-game winner, hooked up against Philadelphia's Eddie Plank in a classic pitcher's duel. James allowed only three base runners in the first eight innings, picking off two of them in holding Philadelphia scoreless. Plank matched him until the ninth, when Amos Strunk lost Charlie Deal's fly ball in the sun for a double. Deal then stole third, and scored on a two-out single by Les Mann. James walked two batters in the ninth, but got Eddie Murphy to ground into a game- ending double play to give Boston a 2‚Äì0 advantage in the series coming back home to Fenway. Hank Gowdy Game 3 Lefty Tyler of the Braves went up against Bullet Joe Bush in a 12-inning thriller. Frank \\"Home Run\\" Baker's two- out single in the tenth plated two runs to give the Athletics a 4‚Äì2 lead and a seeming victory to get them back in the series. But Hank Gowdy led off the bottom of the tenth with a home run, and the Braves then tied the game on Joe Connolly's sacrifice fly later in the inning. Game 2 winner Bill James, coming on in relief for Boston in the 11th, earned the win after Gowdy led off the bottom of the 12th with a double and pinch-runner Les Mann scored when Bush threw wildly to third on Herbie Moran's bunt, giving the Braves a commanding 3‚Äì0 series lead. Game 4 Johnny Evers' two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the fifth broke a 1‚Äì1 tie and the collective backs of the heavily favored Athletics as the \\"Miracle Braves\\" completed their improbable sweep. Game 1 winner Dick Rudolph allowed only one base-runner after Evers' tie- breaking hit and struck out seven in notching his second win of the series. The powerful A's were held to a .172 team batting average and no home runs in the series. Composite line score 1914 World Series (4‚Äì0): Boston Braves (N.L.) over Philadelphia Athletics (A.L.)

The Pirates won the Series in seven games to capture their first championship of the modern Major League Baseball era and the second championship in the club's history. This Series is best remembered for the amazing play by the two best players at the time, Honus Wagner of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers. Sites: games 1, 2 in Pittsburgh; games 3, 4 in Detroit; game 5 in Pittsburgh; games 6, 7 in Detroit. The Pirates had won the pennant in 1909 behind the brilliant play of Honus Wagner, who led the league with a .339 batting average and 100 RBI. Detroit returned for their third consecutive Fall Classic determined to erase the memories of their previous efforts. The Tigers were also backed up by the heavy bat of Ty Cobb (who had just won his third consecutive American League batting title) and a formidable pitching staff. They might have finally won the Series in their third try, had it not been for Pirates rookie Babe Adams. Manager Fred Clarke started him, on a hunch, in Game 1. Adams won that game and two more, setting a World Series record for rookies. The Tigers thus became the first AL team to win three consecutive pennants and the first team to lose three straight World Series (the New York Giants would lose three straight Series from 1911‚Äì13).

There is a long-standing legend that Cobb, standing on first base, called the German-ancestored Honus Wagner \\"Krauthead\\", told him he was going to steal second, and was not only thrown out but that Wagner tagged him in the mouth, ball in hand, drawing blood from Cobb's lip. However, an examination of the play-by-play does not indicate that such a play occurred. In the one \\"caught stealing\\" charged to Cobb, during the first inning of Game 4, he was actually safe at second due to a throwing error by first baseman Bill Abstein. This story is largely attributed to the creative press at the time, and Wagner and Cobb were actually on good terms. For the first time, four umpires were used at the same time, with the standard plate umpire and base umpire along with two outfield umpires. On June 14, 2009, the series' 100th anniversary was celebrated, when the Tigers and Pirates played each other in Pittsburgh. Both teams wore throwback uniforms similar to those worn in 1909. The stadium's public address and sound systems were also turned off, simulating the game conditions in 1909. The Pirates won the game, 6‚Äì3. Summary Bennett Park on October 11, 1909, for the third game of the 1909 World Series. Matchups=Game 1 Rookie Babe Adams, who had compiled a 12‚Äì3 record during the regular season, unexpectedly drew the start for Game 1. He responded with a six-hit, 4‚Äì1 victory sparked by Clarke's game-tying home run in the bottom of the fourth inning. Game 2 The Tigers began their 7‚Äì2 comeback win (after a two-run Pirate bottom of the first) with three runs in the top of the third, tying the Series at one game apiece. Ty Cobb stole home to start the rally. Game 3 Honus Wagner had three hits, three RBI and three stolen bases as the Pirates regained the lead in the Series, two games to one. Game 4 The win-swapping continued with Detroit taking Game 4. Tiger ace George Mullin threw a five-hit shutout while striking out 10 Pirates, again evening the Series at two games apiece. Game 5 Babe Adams threw another six-hitter, for an 8‚Äì4 triumph and a 3‚Äì2 Series lead for his Pirates. Game 6 Mullin, after being roughed up for three first-inning runs, surrendered only one more and wound up with the win, knotting the Series at three games apiece. Game 7 With the Series coming down to a climactic seventh game (the first to go the distance), Pittsburgh's Fred Clarke went with two-game winner Babe Adams as his pitcher, while Detroit Manager Hugh Jennings decided on Bill Donovan, a complete-game winner in Game 2. Donovan got off to a miserable start. He hit the first Pirate batter and went on to walk six in the first two innings. He was pulled after three with Adams confidently holding a 2‚Äì0 lead. Pittsburgh never looked back, as Babe nailed his third six-hitter and third win of the Series for an 8‚Äì0 championship victory. Honus Wagner continued to prove his Cooperstown worthiness by hitting .333, with seven RBI and six stolen bases. On the other side, Ty Cobb did not fare as well. Appearing in what would be his last Series (although he would remain active through 1928), Cobb batted only .231 although he did lead the Tigers, losers of their third Series in three years, with six RBI. No two professional sports teams from Detroit and Pittsburgh would meet in a postseason game again until Game 1 of the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals between the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins. It was the first time that one team won the odd-numbered games; the other, the even; it did not happen again until .

In this first-ever rematch of this young event, the Cubs won in five games for their second straight World Series title. (Sites: game 1 in Detroit; games 2, 3 in Chicago; games 4, 5 in Detroit.) The 1908 World Series was significant for being the last World Series championship the Cubs would win until the World Series (108 years later). Before the 2016 series, the team would go on to appear in seven World Series; in , , , , , , and , losing each time. The Cubs had been one of baseball's most dominant teams in the early 1900s. This was the year of the infamous \\"Merkle's Boner\\" play that allowed the Chicago Cubs to reach the World Series after beating the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants) in a one-game \\"playoff\\", actually the makeup game for the tie that the Merkle play had caused. The Series was anti-climactic after tight pennant races in both leagues. Ty Cobb had a much better World Series than in the previous year, as did the rest of his team. The final two games, held in Detroit, were shutouts. This was also the most poorly attended World Series in history, with the final game drawing a record-low 6,210 fans. Attendance in Chicago was harmed by a ticket-scalping scheme that fans accused the club's owner of participating in, and the World Series was boycotted to some degree. For the first time, four umpires were used in the series, in alternating two-man teams. SummaryMatchups=Game 1 Saturday, October 10, 1908, at Bennett Park in Detroit, Michigan The Tigers struck first in Game 1 when Matty McIntyre singled to lead off the bottom of the first off of Ed Reulbach, stole second and scored on Ty Cobb's two-out single, but the Cubs responded in the third off of Ed Killian when after a leadoff double and single, Frank Schulte's RBI single tied the game. After a bunt groundout, Harry Steinfeldt's RBI single put Chicago up 2‚Äì1. After a walk, Ed Summers relived Killian and allowed an RBI groundout to Joe Tinker and Johnny Kling reached on an error that allowed another run to score. The Cubs added another run in the seventh on Steinfedlt's sacrifice fly. In the bottom of the inning, with runners on second and third, Boss Schmidt's groundout, Red Downs's ground-rule double, and Summers's single scored a run each. Next inning, Claude Rossman's two-run single off of Mordecai Brown put the Tigers up 6‚Äì5. In the top of the ninth, three straight one-out singles loaded the bases before Solly Hofman's single scored two and Joe Tinker's bunt single scored another. After a double steal, Johnny King's two-run single put the Cubs up 10‚Äì6. Brown pitched a scoreless bottom of the ninth despite allowing a single and walk as the Cubs went up 1‚Äì0 in the series. Game 2 Sunday, October 11, 1908, at West Side Grounds in Chicago A scoreless tie in the bottom of the eighth came to an end when Joe Tinker's two-run homer launched a six-run Cub outburst. After a ground-rule double and groundout, RBI singles by Jimmy Sheckard and Johnny Evers and an RBI triple by Frank Schulte (the last two hits coming off after stolen bases) scored a run each. A wild pitch to Frank Chance scored the Cubs' last run. The Tigers avoided a shutout in the ninth when Davy Jones drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Ty Cobb's single. Orval Overall's complete-game win took just 90 minutes. Game 3 Monday, October 12, 1908, at West Side Grounds in Chicago, Illinois It was in this game that Ty Cobb enjoyed the finest World Series outing he ever had. The 21-year-old Georgian rapped three singles and a double in five at-bats, and stole two bases. In the top of the ninth, he singled and promptly stole second and third, but then the hyped-up boy wonder pressed his luck and was thrown out trying to steal home. This was the only Tiger win in their back-to-back first two World Series losses to the Cubs. Detroit struck first in the top of the first when Charley O'Leary hit a one-out single, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Ty Cobb's single. The Cubs responded in the fourth on Frank Chance's RBI single. After stealing second, an error on Harry Steinfeldt's ground ball and Solly Hofman's triple scored a run each. In the top of the sixth, after a single and walk, singles by Sam Crawford, Ty Cobb, and Claude Rossman scored a run each. After a double play, Ira Thomas's RBI double made it 6‚Äì3 Tigers. They added two more runs in the eighth on Bill Coughlin's bases loaded sacrifice fly followed by George Mullin's RBI single. Game 4 Tuesday, October 13, 1908, at Bennett Park in Detroit, Michigan This one was over in 95 minutes. RBI singles by Harry Steinfeldt and Solly Hofman in the third inning after two walks gave Mordecai Brown all the support he'd need. Brown allowed only four hits and walked none. The Cubs added another run in the ninth when Frank Chance reached on an error with two on. Game 5 Wednesday, October 14, 1908, at Bennett Park in Detroit, Michigan The attendance during this last game of the 1908 World Series (6,210) was the smallest crowd in Series history. Overall allowed only three hits, walking four and striking out 10 for his second win of the series. In 18.1 innings, he allowed only seven hits and two runs for an ERA of 0.98. The Cubs scored the game's first run in the first on three straight one-out singles, the last of which to Frank Chance scoring a run, then added another run in the fifth on Johnny Evers's double after two walks. Boss Schmidt, who made the last out of the 1907 Series with a popup to short, also made the last out of this Series with a feeble catcher-to-first groundout. This was also the first World Series game in which neither team committed an error. The Cubs would not win another World Series title until finally reclaiming the crown in 2016.

Games 1 (a tie), 2, 3 were played in Chicago; games 4 and 5 were played in Detroit. The Cubs came back strong from their shocking loss in the 1906 World Series. The Tigers' young star Ty Cobb came into the Series with the first of his many league batting championships. With pitching dominance over the Tigers and Cobb, the Cubs allowed only three runs in the four games they won, while stealing 18 bases off the rattled Tigers.

Matchups = Game 1  Tuesday, October 8, 1907, at West Side Grounds in Chicago, Illinois The Tigers scored three runs, largely due to three Cub errors, in the eighth inning and held a 3‚Äì1 lead going into the bottom of the ninth inning. The Cubs loaded the bases on a single, walk and infield error with one out. Detroit conceded a run on a ground ball for the second out, and Cub player- manager Frank Chance then pinch-hit Del Howard for Joe Tinker. Wild Bill Donovan (25‚Äì4 in the regular season) struck him out, but the ball got away from catcher Boss Schmidt, allowing Harry Steinfeldt to score the tying run. Donovan got the next hitter, but the damage had been done. The teams then played three scoreless extra innings before the game was called on account of darkness and declared a tie, a World Series first. This was the closest the Tigers would come to winning a game in this, their first Series. The Cubs committed five errors and struck out 12 times in the game, but nine stolen base attempts (seven successful) and five bunts (two for hits) set an aggressive offensive tone that would pressure the Tigers for the rest of the series.  Game 2  Wednesday, October 9, 1907, at West Side Grounds in Chicago, Illinois George Mullin, who both won and lost 20 games for Detroit in the regular season, and who had walked over 100 batters in each of his last five seasons, issued a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the second, matching the Tiger run in the top of the inning and tying the score at 1‚Äì1. Chicago scored two more in the fourth on a single, sacrifice bunt, RBI single, stolen base and double to take a 3‚Äì1 lead. Jack Pfiester, while allowing ten hits, benefited from two double plays and three caught-stealings by battery-mate Johnny Kling and was the winning pitcher for the Cubs. Joe Tinker scored a run and drove in another in Game 2 after being pinch-hit for in the ninth inning of Game 1. Hughie Jennings recorded the first ejection in World Series history when he argued a caught stealing call by Hank O'Day against Germany Schaefer.  Game 3  Thursday, October 10, 1907, at West Side Grounds in Chicago, Illinois Cub pitcher Ed Reulbach scattered six hits as Chicago jumped on Tiger starter Ed Siever for four runs on seven hits in only four innings en route to their second win. Johnny Evers had three hits, including two doubles, as the Cubs took a 2‚Äì0 lead in the Series.  Game 4  Friday, October 11, 1907, at Bennett Park in Detroit, Michigan In their first World Series home game, the Tigers took a 1‚Äì0 lead on a triple by their 20-year-old batting champion Ty Cobb and an RBI single by Claude Rossman in the bottom of the fourth, shortly before a rain delay in the top of the fifth. Soon after play resumed in the same inning, two Cubs reached base on an error and a walk. After Joe Tinker sacrificed, pitcher Orval Overall drove both runners home on a single to right. The Cubs scored three more in the seventh without the ball leaving the infield, on four bunts (two for hits) and two ground balls. Regular-season 23-game winner Overall was masterful after the rain delay, allowing only one hit in Detroit's final five innings, giving his Cubs a commanding 3‚Äì0 lead in the Series.  Game 5  Saturday, October 12, 1907, at Bennett Park in Detroit, Michigan Chicago wrapped up the series with a 2‚Äì0 victory on \\"Three- fingered\\" Mordecai Brown's seven-hit shutout. The Cubs scored a run in the top of the first on a walk, stolen base and RBI single by Harry Steinfeldt and scored again in the second on an error, a single, a double-steal and a groundout to drive in the last run of the Series. Detroit had runners on second and third with one out in the last of the fourth, but left them there and never seriously threatened after that. This Series would be the closest to a four-game sweep until the first true Series sweep in , when George Stallings' \\"miracle\\" Boston Braves surged from last place in mid-July to win the NL pennant and upset Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics in the Series.

Frank Chance slides in safely past the tag of Jiggs Donahue. The 1906 World Series featured a crosstown matchup between the Chicago Cubs, who had posted the highest regular-season win total (116) and winning percentage (.763) in the major leagues since the advent of the 154-game season; and the Chicago White Sox. The White Sox, known as the \\"Hitless Wonders\\" after finishing with the worst team batting average (.230) in the American League, beat the Cubs in six games for one of the greatest upsets in Series history. This was the first World Series played by two teams from the same metropolitan area. (The home teams alternated, starting with the NL team being home in game 1.) The teams split the first four games; then the Hitless Wonders (a name coined by sportswriter Charles Dryden) exploded for 26 hits in the last two games. True to their nickname, the White Sox hit only .198 as a team in winning the series, but it beat the .196 average produced by the Cubs. In Game 3, Ed Walsh struck out 12 Cubs, breaking the previous record of 11 set by Bill Dinneen in . The 1906 Series was the first to be played between two teams from the same city. To date, it remains the only World Series played between the two Chicago teams (in fact, it would be another 102 years before both Chicago teams would qualify for the playoffs during the same season, as this was next accomplished in 2008), and one of only two Series (the other being the 1944 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns) played outside New York City that featured two teams from the same city (although the 1989 World Series was played between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics, which are roughly apart). This is also the most recent World Series where both teams were making their first appearance in the Fall Classic, and since the Washington Nationals made it into the World Series in 2019 as the last National League team (leaving the Seattle Mariners as the only current MLB team without an appearance in the Fall Classic) there is currently no such makeup possible‚Äîat least until new franchises are accepted into MLB.  Summary  Matchups = Game 1  After game 1, Fans rush the field and police protect Nick Altrock Tuesday, October 9, 1906, at West Side Grounds in Chicago, Illinois Cub starter Mordecai \\"Three- Fingered\\" Brown was chosen for his dominance against White Sox starter Nick Altrock. Both were perfect through three innings. The Cubs put a runner on second in the bottom of the fourth inning, but couldn't score. In the top of the fifth, George Rohe tripled to lead off, then scored on an error at home when Patsy Dougherty reached on a fielder's choice. The Sox scored a second run in the top of the sixth. Altrock walked, and was sacrificed to second base by Ed Hahn. Fielder Jones then singled to center but Altrock was thrown out at the plate, Jones taking second on the throw home. He took third on Cub catcher Johnny Kling's passed ball, and Frank Isbell drove him home with a single. The Cubs struck back in their half of the sixth. Kling walked and Brown singled with nobody out. After Solly Hofman sacrificed the runners to second and third, Altrock's wild pitch scored Kling and sent Brown to third, giving him little margin for error with only one out, but he got Jimmy Sheckard to pop out and Frank Schulte to ground out to end the threat. He pitched beautifully for the rest of the game, allowing only one more Cub to reach second, retaining the 2‚Äì1 lead for a Game 1 Sox win.  Game 2  Wednesday, October 10, 1906, at South Side Park (III) in Chicago, Illinois Ed Reulbach was called on for the Cubs to face White Sox hurler Doc White. After matching 1‚Äì2‚Äì3 first innings, things started to fall apart for White. After cleanup-hitting first baseman Frank Chance led off the top of the second with a strikeout, third baseman Harry Steinfeldt singled to left field and shortstop Joe Tinker beat out a bunt. Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers then reached on a two-base error by White Sox second baseman Frank Isbell, scoring Steinfeldt for an unearned run and moving Tinker and Evers to second and third. Catcher Johnny Kling was then intentionally walked to load the bases and bring up the pitcher, still with only one out. Reulbach squeeze-bunted Tinker home for a second unearned run, moving Evers to third and Kling to second with two out. Solly Hofman followed with an infield single to shortstop Lee Tannehill, scoring Evers for a third unearned run, but when Kling tried to score from second, he was thrown out at home plate, ending the rally. The Cubs added a fourth unearned run in the third, ending Doc White's day on the mound. The Sox scored in the bottom of the fifth inning with an unearned run, thanks to a wild pitch and an error. The Cubs scored three more runs, all earned, in the sixth and eighth to win Game 2 7‚Äì1 and tie the Series at one game apiece. Reulbach pitched the first one-hitter in World Series history.  Game 3  Jack Pfiester pitching in Game 3 Thursday, October 11, 1906, at West Side Grounds in Chicago, Illinois After allowing two first-inning hits, Sox starter \\"Big Ed\\" Walsh didn't give up another and struck out 12, giving the Sox a 2‚Äì1 edge in the series. After Fred Schulte's first inning two-out double, Walsh retired the next 25 of 27 Cub batters to face him. Third baseman George Rohe cracked a two-out, bases- loaded triple to left in the top of the sixth off Jack Pfiester for the only runs of the game.  Game 4  Friday, October 12, 1906, at South Side Park (III) in Chicago, Illinois \\"Three-Fingered\\" Mordecai Brown pitched 5‚Öî innings of no-hit ball for the Cubs before settling for a two-hitter to even the series once more at two games apiece. Nick Altrock was the hard-luck loser, with the only run of the game coming on Johnny Evers' two-out single in the top of the seventh scoring Frank Chance. The Sox put the tying run on second base in the top of the ninth thanks to a two-out walk and a passed ball, but Frank Isbell grounded out to end the threat. The game took just 96 minutes.  Game 5  Game 5 at West Side Park. Saturday, October 13, 1906, at West Side Grounds in Chicago, Illinois Game 5 was a wild affair with a total of 18 hits, ten walks, six errors, two hit batsmen, three wild pitches and a steal of home. The Cubs allowed a first inning run to the Sox, then scored three of their own to take an early lead. The Sox tied the game in the third on George Davis' theft of home on the front end of a double steal and then took the lead for good with a four-run rally in the fourth and held on for the victory to take a 3‚Äì2 lead in the series. A 12-hit attack led by Frank Isbell's four doubles were enough to overcome six errors committed by the porous Sox defense. \\"Big\\" Ed Walsh earned his second win of the series, although he needed three innings of relief help from Doc White.  Game 6  South Side Park during Game 6. Sunday, October 14, 1906, at South Side Park (III) in Chicago, Illinois Mordecai Brown, pitching on only one day of rest, didn't make it out of the second inning as the Hitless Wonders White Sox stunned the 116‚Äì36 Cubs in the Series finale. The Sox battered Brown for seven runs on eight hits while getting a solid pitching performance from Doc White. Although the Cubs scored a run and loaded the bases in the ninth, White got Frank Schulte to ground out for the final out of the series and the White Sox won the World Series over the powerful Cubs, who would compensate by winning the next two World Series from young Ty Cobb, Hugh Jennings and the Detroit Tigers even though they fell far short of 116 wins in 1907 or 1908, for the last Cub World Series wins in over a hundred years. This game is notable for being the only time the Chicago White Sox have ever clinched a postseason series at home. It remained the only time a Chicago-based team had ever clinched a series at home until the Cubs won the 2015 NLDS on their homefield.

College career From Lake Oswego, Oregon, a suburb south of Portland, Lomax was a standout college player at Portland State University, going from fifth- string freshman quarterback in 1977 on a partial scholarship to emergency starter to NCAA legend in the run and shoot offense of head coach Mouse Davis. By the end of his college career in 1980, he held 90 NCAA records, including seven touchdown passes in the first quarter against Delaware State, which ended in a 105‚Äì0 shutout for the Division I-AA Vikings. Two weeks earlier, independent Portland State crushed Division II Cal Poly Pomona 93‚Äì7. In his final collegiate game, Lomax threw for 474 yards with five touchdown passes as PSU waxed Weber State 75‚Äì0 to finish at 8‚Äì3; he ended his college career with more than passing and over a hundred touchdown passes. Lomax also had a game at Division II Northern Colorado in 1979 where he was 44/77 for 499 yards passing. As of 2012, that game ranks fourth all-time at Portland State for yards thrown in a game. He graduated with a degree in communications in 1981. Statistics *1977: 102/181 for 1,670 yards with 18 TD vs 5 INT. *1978: 241/436 for 3,506 yards with 26 TD vs 22 INT. *1979: 299/516 for 3,950 yards with 26 TD vs 16 INT. *1980: 296/473 for 4,094 yards with 37 TD vs 12 INT. Professional career Lomax was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the second round of the 1981 NFL Draft, the 33rd overall pick. Despite his college heroics, he had an up-and-down nine-year career for some very mediocre Cardinals teams, displaying brilliance in his two Pro Bowl years (1984 and 1987), but also occasionally playing poorly enough to be benched. In Lomax' first season in 1981, he played in 14 games while starting seven of them (with 15-year veteran Jim Hart starting the other nine), going 4-3 while throwing four touchdowns and ten interceptions while passing for 1,575 yards on a 50.4 completion percentage. In the strike-shortened nine game season of 1982, Lomax started every game, passing for 1,367 yards for five touchdowns and six interceptions while having a 53.2 completion percentage. Lomax started the playoff game that the Cardinals had against the Green Bay Packers, throwing 32-of-51 for 385 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, but the Cardinals lost 41‚Äì16. It was his only playoff appearance. Lomax started thirteen games the following year while Hart started the other three. He went 7-5-1 while throwing for 2,636 yards with 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for a 59.0% completion percentage, but the team failed to return to the postseason, finishing 8-7-1 after starting the season 1-5. During 1984, Lomax started every game, and he had his best season yet, throwing for 4,614 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions on a 61.6% completion percentage, all career highs. His passing yards rank 20th all-time for a season. He was named to the Pro Bowl that year. Although the Cardinals finished 9-7, the head-to- head record with the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys (for which the Cardinals went a combined 2-2 against, along with losing the season finale against the Washington Redskins) meant that St. Louis lost out on a playoff spot. Lomax started in each game again in 1985, but the team went 5-11, as he threw for 18 touchdowns and 12 interceptions on 3,214 yards and a 56.3% completion percentage. For 1986, Lomax started 14 games while Cliff Stoudt started the other two, with the former going 4-9-1 over the latter's 0-2 record. He threw for 2,583 yards while having 13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions on a 57.0% completion percentage. The following season was both Lomax's penultimate year as a Cardinal and the final one for the team in St. Louis.

He was named to the Pro Bowl that year. In his final year in 1988, the Cardinals' first in Arizona, Lomax started 14 games (while Cliff Stoudt started two others) and went 7-7, throwing for 20 touchdowns and 11 interceptions for 3,395 yards and a 57.6 completion percentage. Lomax was forced to retire before the 1990 season (after missing all of 1989) due to a severely arthritic hip. In 1991, he underwent hip replacement surgery. Lomax finished with a career record of 47-52-2, 136 touchdowns, and over 22,000 yards passing, with those categories (along with completions and attempts) being second most as a Cardinal, after Hart. After football Lomax was the head coach for Fort Vancouver High School in Vancouver, Washington for two seasons before resigning in January 2020.

Plymouths keel was laid down as Kenosha at the New York Navy Yard in 1867; completed in 1868; and commissioned on 20 January 1869 with Captain William H. McComb in command. Service history Kenosha got underway eastward across the Atlantic on 25 February 1869. While on the European Station she was renamed Plymouth on 15 May 1869. Word of the change reached her at Ville Franche, on 26 June. She then cruised off the Levant and North Africa under her new name, returning to Marseilles on 19 November. From southern France, she continued on to Portsmouth, England, whence she accompanied the British turreted battleship , carrying the remains of George Peabody, American merchant, financier and philanthropist, to the United States for burial. Arriving at Portland, Maine, on 25 January 1870, she remained there on ceremonial duty until sailing for Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for refit at the navy yard. Plymouth departed New York on 12 July 1870 and steamed to the Mediterranean Sea where Rear Admiral Charles Boggs selected her as flagship of the European Station, 21 September. During Plymouths service in the European Station, two sailors and one marine were awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing others from drowning: Quarter Gunner George Holt and Landsman Paul Tobin at the Port of Hamburg, Germany, on 3 July 1871 and Corporal James A. Stewart at Ville Franche, France, on 1 February 1872. The ship sailed for the coast of Africa on 17 February 1872, thence headed home via the West Indies and remained on the Atlantic coast until returning to European waters 1 November 1872. This deployment lasted until the screw sloop sailed for home 6 June 1873. She arrived at New York City on 18 June, thence proceeded to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she decommissioned on 28 June. Recommissioned 10 October 1874, the sloop operated along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea. Under the command of Captain Edward Barrett, Plymouth was sent by the Government to attend the closing of the International Expo. Barrett was also the first to test the Eads jetties in the spring of 1877.

On the occasion of Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Captain Barrett was called to Washington, where he organized a brigade of naval sailors and marines for the protection of the city and public establishments and held the command of the first aid force until all danger had passed. Plymouth was employed sailing up the Potomac River, with Lieutenant Benjamin Tilley. Plymouth decommissioned again 17 May 1879, and remained in ordinary at Portsmouth until scrapped in 1884.

Church work He refused preferment on several occasions, but his energy and success made him well known, and in 1879 he was consecrated a bishop, by Archibald Campbell Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 25 July at St Paul's Cathedral; he became the first modern suffragan bishop in London, under the title of Bishop of Bedford, his province being the East End. There he became the inspiring influence of a revival of church work. He founded the East London Church Fund, and enlisted a large band of enthusiastic helpers, his popularity among all classes being immense. He was particularly fond of children, and was commonly called the children's bishop. When he came to East London in 1879 \\"he found great need of women's help for the poor in the huge parishes of his diocese\\". He then planned to establish a Deaconess Community and applied to the (West) London Diocesan Deaconess Institution. LDDI sent its Sister Louisa in autumn 1880 and the East London Diocesan Deaconess Institution was founded at Sutton Place, Hackney. Deaconess Sisters worked in various East London parishes and eventually the Institution became the All Saints Deaconess Home at Meynell Crescent (1894/5-1924).

Commissioned by Feargus O‚ÄôConnor, this engraving was distributed with 25.000 copies of the chartist newspaper the Northern Star in November 1839. When Stephens less than a month later denounced the movement in reaction to the Newport Rising, chartists responded by publicly burning his portrait Joseph Rayner Stephens (8 March 1805‚Äì18 February 1879) was a Methodist minister who offended the Wesleyan Conference by his support for separating the Church of England from the State. Resigning from the Wesleyan Connection, he became free to campaign for factory reform, and against the New Poor Law. He became associated with 'physical force' Chartism (although he later denied he had ever been a Chartist) and spent eighteen months in jail for his presence at an unlawful assembly and his use there of seditious language. Born in Edinburgh in 1805, he moved to Manchester when his minister father was posted there in 1819. During his religious career, he worked in a variety of places (including Stockholm and Newcastle-upon-Tyne\\"some years ago stationed in this town as a Wesleyan Methodist preacher\\") before arriving in Ashton-under-Lyne in 1832. He was the brother of the philologist George Stephens.; three of his other brothers (John, Edward and Samuel) emigrated to Southern Australia and played their parts in the early years of that colony.  Leaves Wesleyan Methodism  Stephens gave a number of talks in favour of disestablishment and became secretary of the Ashton branch of a society arguing for disestablishment. His district conference attempted to discipline him for engaging in controversial political activity, and for taking a view on Church Establishment contrary to that of Wesleyans and of John Wesley. Stephens was willing to accept a temporary suspension on most points, but not on deviation from the views of Wesley, in whose writings he found views matching his own. The national conference nonetheless asserted that true Wesleyans were in favour of the existence of an Established Church and lengthened his suspension: Stephens resigned and set up his own \\"Stephenite\\" churches in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge. Political agitation Joseph Rayner Stephens blue plaque, Stalybridge Town Hall He became active in the movement for factory reform and in the anti-Poor Law movement. In both sermons and speeches he denounced the practices of millowners and the intentions of the new Poor Law as un-Christian and hence doomed to end in social upheaval and bloodshed. Like Richard Oastler he held Tory views on most issues; like Oastler he advised his followers that it was legal to arm themselves and that governmenment would pay more attention to their views if they did. He and Oastler (who saw the younger man as his natural successor) became associated with the Chartists, who also saw the new Poor Law, the rapacity and inhumanity of employers and the poverty of workers as issues requiring urgent attention, but sought to remedy them by fundamental political change. Whereas Oastler openly opposed the constitutional aspirations of the Chartists, and did not become involved in Chartism, Stephens addressed Chartist meetingseg seconding a resolution at the monster Kersal Moor meeting in September 1838 and was elected a delegate to the National Conference. However, as he later told his congregation, he was never a Radical, let alone a 'five-point man' : \\"I would rather walk to London on my bare knees, on sharp flint stones to attend an Anti-poor Law meeting, than be carried to London in a coach and six, pillowed with down to present that petition - the \\"national petition\\" to the House of Commons\\" Nor did his advice to followers to arm themselves indicate any support for 'physical force' Chartism or the overthrow of the existing order by violence or by general strike: \\"My friends, never put your trust in, and never follow after, men who pretend to be able to manufacture a revolution. A revolution, a rolling away of the whole from evil to good, from wrong to right, from injustice and oppression to righteousness and equal rule, never yet was manufactured, and never will be manufactured. God, who teaches you what your rights are, what the blessings He has endowed you withal, will, in his own good time, if that time should come - God will teach your hands to war, and your fingers to fight\\" Imprisonment In December 1838, Stephens was arrested, charged with having participated in a tumultuous assembly at Leigh on 13 November 1838 and having incited the meeting to violence against inhabitants of the neighbourhood. A Lancashire grand jury returned a true bill both for the Leigh meeting and for sermons preached in Ashton-under-Lyne: however Stephens was eventually tried at Chester in connection with a meeting at Hyde (then in Cheshire) on 14 November 1838.  the prosecution witnesses for the Leigh meeting had Stephens saying he would establish a republic by force: Stephens was not a Republican Stephens was charged with attending \\"an unlawful meeting , seditiously and tumultuously met together by torch-light, and with fire-arms disturbing the public peace\\" and two counts of speaking at the meeting. Witnesses said attendance at the meeting had been about 5,000 mostly from outside Hyde, firearms had been discharged, banners with slogans such as \\"Tyrants, believe, and tremble\\" and \\"BLOOD\\" had been displayed and the meeting had not broken up until midnight. It had been successfully argued (to secure the conviction of Orator Hunt in the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre) that to be unlawful a meeting need only be one such that taking all the circumstances into consideration cannot but endanger the public peace, and raise fears and jealousies among the king's subjects. Stephens was convicted and sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. He served his sentence in Chester Castle, under far from onerous conditions, and was released eight days early, to allow him to attend his father's funeral. Later life Stephens Memorial, Stamford Park, Stalybridge Heavy sureties had to be given for his good behaviour for the next five years, and he did not resume public speaking until participating in a campaign for better enforcement of the Ten Hours' Act (i.e. against the relay system) in 1849., explicitly holding non-compliance and non-enforcement to be responsible for social unrest and the more extreme forms that manifested itself in: \\"It is the practice of injustice towards the poor which estranges them from the institutions of their country, and leads them into many wild and unreasoning projects to obtain deliverance from the intolerable yoke that has been fastened upon them\\" He supported opposition to the 'Compromise Act' of 1850 and took part in abortive campaigns for legislation for a true ten-hour day enforced by stoppage of machinery. In 1857, he looked back on his agitational heyday > History would do justice to the memory of the benevolent and heroic men who > had first devoted themselves to this great work (factory reform). Nothing > gave him so much satisfaction in the retrospect, as the humble part he had > been permitted to take in this good cause.

In 1868 he lectured against disestablishment of the Irish Church.

Biography Richard March Hoe was born in New York City, the son of Robert Hoe (1784‚Äì1833), an English-born American mechanic from Leicestershire. His brothers were Peter Smith Hoe and Robert Hoe II. His father, with brothers-in-law Peter and Matthew Smith, established a steam-powered manufactory of printing presses in New York City. At the age of fifteen, Richard joined their enterprise. Several years later in 1833, he became a senior member of his father's firm R. Hoe & Company. After his father's death that year, Hoe became head of the company. He was joined later by his younger brother Robert Hoe II (1815-1884). Richard Hoe married and had a family, eventually living in a manor house on 53 acres in the Bronx. Hoe died on June 7, 1886, in Florence, Italy. Inventions Early on, Hoe added the production of steel saws to his business and introduced improvements to their manufacture. In 1837, he visited England and obtained a patent for a better process of grinding saws. In connection with his factory, Hoe established an apprentice's school where free instruction was given. He is most well known for his invention in 1843 of a rotary printing press: type was placed on a revolving cylinder, a design that could print much faster than the old flatbed printing press. It received in 1847, and was placed in commercial use the same year. Arunah Shepherdson Abell, publisher of The Sun in Baltimore, was among the first to buy it and put it into use. In its early days, it was variously called the \\"Hoe lightning press,\\" and \\"Hoe's Cylindrical-Bed Press.\\" Hoe's 6-cylinder press, from N. Orr's History of the Processes of Manufacture (1864) alt= In 1870 Hoe developed a rotary press that printed both sides of a page in a single operation, what he called the \\"Hoe web perfecting press.\\" Hoe's press used a continuous roll of paper five miles long, which was put through the machine at the rate of a minute. As the roll emerged, it passed over a knife which cut pages apart; they were next run through an apparatus which folded the pages for the mail or for carriers. These completely printed and folded newspapers were delivered as quickly as the eye could follow them. It produced 18,000 papers an hour and was used the first time by the New York Tribune. Hoe was a Freemason. He died while traveling in 1886 in Florence, Italy. His nephew, Robert Hoe (1839‚Äì1909), wrote a notable Short History of the Printing Press (1902). He also made further improvements in printing. Although Hoe was known for his rotary printing press, he also had much practice before, since he took on his fathers work after he retired, he perfected many cylinder presses, and he continued to improve, eventually creating his prize invention, the hoe lightning press. Brightside estate Hoe lived with his wife, Mary, and children on a estate, called Brightside, in the Morrisania/Hunts Point section of the Bronx. Richard's brother, Peter Smith Hoe, also had a house (Sunnyslope) on the same estate. This building still stands at the corner of Faile Street and Lafayette Avenue and houses the Bright Temple African Methodist Episcopal Church. His family sold the estate in 1904 to developers speculating on the subway extension into the Bronx. Several streets in the area are named after historical figures in the printing industry. Aldus Street was named after Aldo Manuzio. Guttenberg Street (with two t's) was named after Johannes Gutenberg; it was renamed East 165th Street in 1911. Hoe Avenue runs north from what is now Bruckner Boulevard. Printer's Park sign (missing the apostrophe) Printer's Park is located at the former site of his mansion, at the corner on Aldus Street and Hoe Avenue in the Bronx.

Gottlieb Hufeland (29 October 1760 ‚Äì 25 February 1817) was a German economist and jurist. Biography Born in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), Royal Prussia, Crown of Poland, Hufeland was educated at the gymnasium of his native town, and completed his university studies at Leipzig and G√∂ttingen. He graduated at Jena, and in 1788 was there appointed to an extraordinary professorship. Five years later he was made ordinary professor. His lectures on natural law, in which he developed with great acuteness and skill the formal principles of the Kantian theory of legislation, attracted a large audience, and contributed to raise to its height the fame of the University of Jena, then unusually rich in able teachers. In 1803, after the departure of many of his colleagues from Jena, Hufeland accepted a call to W√ºrzburg, from which, after but a brief tenure of a professorial chair, he proceeded to Landshut. From 1806 to 1812 he acted as burgomaster in his native town of Danzig. Returning to Landshut, he lived there until 1816, when he was invited to the University of Halle. In political economy Hufeland's chief work is the Neue Grundlegung der Staatswirthschaftskunst (2 vols, 1807 and 1813), the second volume of which has the special title, Lehre vom Gelde und Geldumlaufe. The principles of this work are for the most part those of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, which were then beginning to be accepted and developed in Germany; but both in his treatment of fundamental notions, such as economic good and value, and in details, such as the theory of money, Hufeland's treatment has a certain originality. Two points in particular seem deserving of notice. Hufeland was the first among German economists to point out the profit of the entrepreneur as a distinct species of revenue with laws peculiar to itself. He also tends towards, though he does not explicitly state the view that rent is a general term applicable to all payments resulting from differences of degree among productive forces of the same order. Thus the superior gain of a specially gifted workman or specially skilled employer is in time assimilated to the payment for a natural agency of more than the minimum efficiency. Hufeland died in 1817 in Halle an der Saale. Works Hufeland's works on the theory of legislation: *Versuch √ºber den Grundsatz Naturrechts (1785) *Lehrbuch des Naturrechts (1790) *Institutionen des gesammten positiven Rechts (1798) *Lehrbuch der Geschichte und Encyclopadie alter in Deutschland geltenden positiven Rechte (1790) They are distinguished by precision of statement and clearness of deduction. They form on the whole the best commentary upon Kant's Rechtslehre, the principles of which they carry out in detail, and apply to the discussion of positive laws.

Early life He was the youngest of two surviving sons in a family of eighteen children. His father, a Quaker, was a relatively prosperous manufacturer of high-quality stone printing tables for textiles in Edgworth. Career Penwortham Hall, Penwortham built by John Horrocks in 1801 David Hunt in his 1992 History of Preston reports that many details of his early life are confused. The Lancashire cotton industry was then in its infancy, but Horrocks was greatly impressed with its future possibilities, and he managed to obtain a few spinning-frames which he erected in a corner of his father's offices. For a time he combined cotton-spinning on a very small scale with stone-working, but finally devoted himself entirely to cotton-spinning, working the frames with his own hands, and travelling through the Lancashire manufacturing districts to sell the yarn. His goods obtained a reputation for quality, and his customers increased so rapidly that about 1791 he moved to Preston, where he began to manufacture cotton shirtings and long-cloths in addition to spinning the cotton yarn. He took full advantage of the machinery invented for manufacturing textiles. By rigidly maintaining the quality of his goods and rapidly developed his business. He was aided by a local banker, who became a partner. Within a year of his arrival in Preston he built his first large mill. Shortly after he obtained a monopoly of the manufacture of cottons and muslins for the Indian market from the British East India Company. Demand for Horrocks's goods continued to increase, and to cope with the additional work he took first an elder brother and in 1801 a Mr Whitehead and a Mr Miller into partnership, the title of the firm being altered to Horrockses, Miller, & Co. In 1794, Horrocks was chosen as a burgess and served as Town Bailiff in 1794‚Äì5. He was elected as a council member in 1796 and became an Alderman in 1799. In 1802, he entered parliament as Tory member for Preston, having stood unsuccessfully in 1796. He died of brain fever reportedly resulting from over- work. During his 13 years in Preston he amassed a personal fortune of at least ¬£150,000, and set the foundations for the Horrocks/Miller mill owning dynasty that dominated Preston into the mid nineteenth century. In 1801 Horrocks built \\"The Lodge\\" (later called Penwortham Hall) in Penwortham as a residence for himself. The property, which is a Grade II listed building, is today used as a series of private dwellings. He died in 1804 and was buried at St Mary's Church, Penwortham.

It is a regional industrial and commercial center but economically it is much better known for its production of ornamental plants and cut flowers. The city was founded early in the colonial period, originally under the jurisdiction of Huejotzingo, but eventually separated to become an independent municipality. The municipality has a number of notable cultural events, the most important of which is the El Huey Atlixcayotl, a modern adaptation of an old indigenous celebration. This event brings anywhere from 800 to 1,500 participants from all over the state of Puebla to create music, dance, and other cultural and artistic performances. The city The city of Atlixco is in the west of the state of Puebla at an elevation of 1,881 meters above sea level, twenty five km from the state capital of Puebla. The main economic activities of the city are agriculture and basic commerce. It lies at the foot of the Cerro de San Miguel mountain, which is the main geographical and cultural landmark, marked by a small hermitage at the top dedicated to the Archangel Michael. According to local lore, a demon was entrapped in the well there, after causing problems in the community. There are also lookout points that provide panoramic views of the city. San Agustin Church The city centers on a main square which is Moorish in style, surrounded by restaurants and other places selling local specialties and ice cream. Notable location on or near the square include the Casa de la Audencia, with its portal supported by Tuscan columns, the Portal Hidalgo, the old Marqu√©s de Santa Martha House, the Botica Poblana farmacy, founded in 1877 (the farmacy was taken down about 2005 so it no longer exists), the Rascon Building from the late 19th century, CADAC (an arts and trades school) and the Isaac Ochotorena House from the 18th century. Another important area of the city is Colonia Cabrera, noted for its abundance greenhouse production of flowers and ornamental plants. The most important churches in the city date from the 18th century, noted for their intricate ‚Äúfolk Baroque‚Äù facades created from stucco by indigenous craftsmen. The La Merced Temple is all that remains of a Mercedarian monastery. Most of the church, including a decorative side door is from the 17th century, but the fa√ßade is from the 18th century. The main portal is decorated with paired columns, spiraling vines in high relief and ornamental sculptures in niches on both the upper and lower levels. The doorway itself is a lobed Moorish arch. The center of this decoration is a niche with an image of the Virgin of Mercy, who shelters Mercedarian founder Pedro Nolasco and other saints with her cloak. The interior was redone in the 19th century, but maintains a large colonial era portrait of Our Lady of Mercy by Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Mag√≥n as well as an 18th-century inlaid wood pulpit. This church has a collection of paintings from the colonial period. This collection is under the care of the Adopt a Work of Art campaign working to restore many of the canvases to their original state. The Third Order Chapel is at the foot of the hill where the former Franciscan monastery is located and also has portal work of stucco. The west facade has a classic altarpiece design in folk Baroque with cherubs and angels throughout. It contains pairs Solomonic columns with vines and fruits with two tiers of ornamental niches with saints and apostles. Above the arched doorway is a cornucopia and above this is a choir window covered by a shell arch. On either side of the window there are columns and geometric relief patterns as well as Moorish medallions. Inside there is a notable 18th-century gold leaf altarpiece called the Retablo de Reyes. Although the parish church called Natividad itself has a plain facade, it has an ornate addition called the Santuario del Sant√≠simo (Most Holy Sanctuary), built in the late 1700s on the north side with a polychrome stucco facade and painted cupola. The former main portal has decorative spiral columns, which are topped by ‚Äúwoven‚Äù columns and bands of filigree and foliated relief around a choir window shaped like a shell. Above the facade, there is an escutcheon with a relief of the Holy Sacrament and a two-headed Habsburg eagle. On the sides of this are rampant lions and angels in while on an ocher background. The interior was redone in Neo Classical in the 19th century, with one Baroque altarpiece surviving, attributed to Luis Ju√°rez. Other important churches include the San Agustin Church, built between 1589 and 1698,also with Baroque stucco work, the La Soledad Chapel and the chapels of Santa Clara and El Carmen. The San Felix Papa Church has a fa√ßade which is identical to a large sized painting possibly from the 18th century, which is found in the sacristy of the Natividad Parish Church on the main plaza. It contains works from the 17th century, including a collection of apostles dressed as popes. There were a number of monasteries in the community during the colonial period, all now either destroyed or no longer active. The most notable of these if the former Franciscan monastery built on a hill in fortress fashion, walking distance from the main square. The atrium offers panoramic views of the city and the church is popular for weddings. Inside there is a Baroque main altar. In the 16th century, the Augustinians built a monastery under Melchor de Vargas, not for evangelization but rather to represent their order and provide services to the local criollo population. The church has two facades, with the main one on the north side. The portal of the side has Baroque decoration in stucco, as does the bell tower. Another was a convent called Las Clarisas founded in 1617. The San Juan de Dios Municipal Hospital was founded is one of the few colonial-era hospitals still running. The building is marked by an original statue of Saint Adrian fighting a lion. It is also noted for a significant painting collection, which is open to the public. Next to the hospital is a church dedicated to the Archangel Raphael. The municipal palace is facing the main square and distinguished by a facade decorated in Talavera tile . Originally the city library, its inner walls contains a series of murals related to the history and culture of the municipality and the country, including its founding, history of education in Mexico, and heroes of wars of Independence and Reforma . The municipal market is one block from the main square, which also has stalls specializing in local foods. Tianguis day in the city is Saturday, when streets fill with stalls selling fruits, vegetables, flowers, bread and many other staples. It is one of the largest and oldest tianguis in the state. There is one museum called Museo Obrero, located inside the Centro Vacacional IMSS Metepec, along with a cultural center located in a former textile factory. The municipality The city of Atlixco is the local government for a number of other nearby communities, which form a municipality that covers an area of 229.22km2. The municipal government consists of a president, a syndic, and twelve representatives for the various communities. Outside the seat, the main communities are San Pedro Benito Ju√°rez, Santo Domingo Atoyatempan, San Jer√≥nimo Coyula, La Trinidad Tepango, Axocapan, San Miguel Ayala, San Jer√≥nimo Caleras, San Diego Acapulco, Santa Lucia Cosamaloapan and Metepec. It borders the municipalities of Tianguismanalco, Santa Isabel Cholula (municipality), Ocoyucan, Atzitzihuac√°n, Huaquechula, Tepeojuma, San Diego la Meza Tochimiltzingo (municipality), Puebla and Tochimilco . The main economic activities for the municipality are agriculture and livestock. The Centro Vacacional Metepec is seven km northwest of the city, in a former textile factory. Today it is one of the state's most important water parks. Geography and environment  Atlixco Valley with Popocatepetl in the background The territory of the municipality is divided between the Valley of Puebla and the Atlixco Valley, both of which extend from the Sierra Nevada. The altitude varies from a low of 1,700 meters above sea level in the south to 2,500 in the northwest at the foot of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, with an overall average altitude of 1840. The center of the territory is a valley floor that extends from north to south, with isolated mountains such as Zoapiltepec and Texistle in the southeast. Other isolated peaks include the Pochote, Tecuitlacuelo, Loma La Calera and El Charro. The municipality is located in the basin of the Nexapa River, a tributary of the Atoyac. Various streams run through the territory, which have their source at the Iztaccihuatl Volcano; however, most depending on snow melt from the volcano. The Nexcapa is one of the few that run year-round and splits the Atlixco Valley in half. Other larger ones include the Cuescomante, which passes by the seat, the Molino and the Palomas. The highest elevations at the foot of the volcanos are marked by a large number of ravines. The San Pedro Atlixco Waterfall is in this area, surrounded by pines and cedars. This area has fishing, boating, camping and more. The municipality is in the transition zone between the more temperate climates of the north of the state and the hotter climates of the south. The northwest and isolated peaks have a temperate and semi humid climate as it has the highest altitude. The center and south have a warm and semi-humid climate. Most of the valley floor area is dedicated to irrigated farming, with rainy season farming dominant in the higher elevations. The latter has contributed to extensive deforestation, cutting down pines and cedars. The only remaining wild vegetation is in small areas in the north and northeast, where these trees still exist. In small areas in the southeast, there is pastureland and scrub brush. Culture The most important annual event in the municipality is called El Huey Atlixcayotl, a Nahuatl phrase which roughly translates to ‚Äúthe great Atlixco tradition.‚Äù This event, started in 1965, is a reinvention of an old indigenous celebration that tradition says in the pre Hispanic period honored the god Quetzalcoatl, giving thanks for the harvest. On the last Saturday of September, the event begins with the selection of the festival queen, called the Xochicihuatl (lit. flower woman) and a dance called Las Canastas, when women dance with baskets of fireworks on their heads. The main events are on the following day, Sunday, when a parade of between 800 and 1,500 participants from Puebla's eleven regions leaves the town square to climb Cerro de San Miguel, which has a stage area with stands. The rest of the day is filled with performances by charros, bands, mojigangas, voladores and more. These activities are in honor of the Archangel Michael, who has a small church on the mountain. In 1996 the event was named as part of the Cultural Heritage of Puebla. Large flower \\"carpet\\" laid for Day of the Dead The Festival de la Ilusi√≥n (Illusion Festival) was started in the 1990s by two teenagers to reinforce the tradition of Three Kings‚Äô Day in Mexico, January 6. At that time, many fathers and other family members went to the United States to work, leading to foreign influences such as Santa Claus. To give January 6 precedence, the teens took a collection from local businesses to buy thousands of balloons and envelopes so that children could have a mass launch, sending their requests for toys. The fourth of January is still dedicated to this launch, but two days have been added. On January 5, a 5 km parade with floats in honor of the Three Kings is held, and on January 6 the local convention center hosts musical groups, clowns and other forms of entertainment for the city. The Festival de la Iluminaci√≥n (Lights Festival) or Villa Iluminada (Lighted Village) begins on November 20 with large lighted figures that adorn the city's streets. This event was begun in 2010, with the lights placed along a corridor of a km and half. The event draws over 500,000 visitors to the city during the 46 days it is set up from the end of November to the beginning of January. In addition to the lights the event also features amusement rides, and an exhibition of sky lanterns. Some of the annual events are related to Atlixco's economy. The Festival de la Flor (Flower Festival) celebrates the municipality's main economic activity of growing flowers. Starting in the second week of March, giant ‚Äúcarpets‚Äù are created by arranging flowers on the street. During the last two weeks of the month, large flower sculptures are created to attract visitors, along with musical events and other attractions. The Feria de la Nochebuena (Poinsettia Fair) begins on November 25 and runs through the Christmas season to promote the plants of this type grown in the municipality. The Feria de la Noche Buena began in 2001 and is timed for the start of the Christmas season. The Feria de la Cecina (Cecina Fair) promotes the local version of this meat, in August with artistic and cultural events. The last two weeks of October are dedicated to the regional fair. La Noche de las Estrellas (Night of the Stars) occurs on the last Saturday of February, when about 5,000 people come together on the Cerro de San Miguel mountain to observe the night sky, through the telescopes of the observatory there. The event promotes the organizations courses and workshops as well as a program to provide telescopes to families. For Holy Week, the streets of the Nexatengo community are adorned with flowers, pine branches and sawdust carpets for a procession of Jesus in which 8,000 people participate in an eight km procession. The Desfile de Calaveras (Skull Parade) takes place on November 2, Day of the Dead. It is during traditional festivals that local food specialties and dress most often appear. Traditional dishes include cecina, a local variety of consome called ‚Äúatlixquense,‚Äù chiles en nogada, barbacoa, mole poblano, mole de panza, mole de olla, mole verde, pozole blanco, tostadas, enchiladas, pambazos, tortas, cemitas, molotes and tlacoyos. The most traditional dress is now seen only on certain occasions and dances. For women, this is the style of the China Poblana, or alternatively a long full flowered skirt with white blouse and rebozo. For men this consists of a shirt and pants made of undyed cotton, huaraches and a hat made of palm fronds. Economy The city of Atlixco is a regional commercial, manufacturing and industrial center with textile mills, distilleries and bottling plants. Traditional handcrafts also are made here and in the rest of the municipality including ceramic utensils, embroidered shirts and blouses and candles. However, the municipality is best known for its cultivation of ornamental plants, flowers and fruit trees. Flowers include roses, geraniums, chrysanthemums, and Cornish mallow (Lavatera cretica) . All of its potted plant production is sold in Mexico, with eighty percent of the cut flowers sent abroad, mostly to the United States. The municipality ranks first in the production of roses and gladiolas and is one of the largest producers of poinsettias, helping to make the state of Puebla fourth in Mexico in its production. Fifty two producers on twenty five hectares typically produce 1.5 million poinsettials per year. Sales from poinsettias alone reach at least 68 million pesos for the municipality and support 800 families. Most of the plants are shipped to other Mexican states such as Veracruz, Oaxaca, Chiapas, Yucat√°n and Campeche. The main flowers grown and sold for Day of the Dead include chrysanthemums, gladiolas and baby's breath. In addition, other crops such as wheat, corn, beans and fruits, much of which are processed locally and distributed from the city. History Section of Juan Manuel Martinez Caltenco's mural work in the municipal building depicting the municipality's history The name ‚ÄúAtlixco‚Äù comes from a Nahuatl phrase which can be interpreted as either ‚Äúwater in the valley‚Äù or ‚Äúwater on the ground.‚Äù Its main economic activity has earned the city the suffix of ‚Äúde las flores‚Äù (of the flowers) . The city of Atlixco received its coat of arms from King Phillip II in 1579, which now represents the entire municipality. In the pre Hispanic period, it was part of Cuauhquecoll√°n, today Huaquechula. The first known inhabitants of this area were the Teochichimecas around 1100CE, before becoming a Xicalanca settlement. This area was eventually conquered by Tenochtitlan. Its location made it a battleground among several indigenous peoples, with the populations of Calpan, Huejotzingo and Cholula claiming possession. After the Conquest it was named Acapetlahuacan (place of reeds) until its current name. During the colonial period, the area was an important producer of grain, especially wheat, giving rise to the first wheat mill in the state. The city proper was founded in 1579 as Villas de Carri√≥n by Pedro de Castillo, Crist√≥bal Ruiz de Cabrera and Alonso D√≠az de Carri√≥n. Originally it and the surrounding area was under the jurisdiction of Huejotzingo, but in 1632, it became a local independent seat of government. In 1706 the area became under the direct control of the Spanish Crown, with Philip V granting Jos√© Sarmiento de Valladares the title of Duque y Se√±or de Atlixco. In 1840 the Marquesa Calder√≥n de la Barca visited the community and noted that it was filled with beautiful churches, monasteries and other buildings. The town was given the official status of city by Nicol√°s Bravo in 1843. In 1847, the municipal government took over administration of the San Juan de Dios Hospital. In 1862, troops led by General Tom√°s O¬¥Horan defeated French sympathizers under Leonardo M√°rquez, impeding the advance of French troops. This was an important precursor to the Battle of Puebla . Since then the area's economy has changed to the production of flowers and ornamental plants along with some commerce and industry. There have also been efforts to make the area attractive for tourists, with various festivals and other events established since the late 20th century. In 2008, the municipality set a world record for the largest chile en nogada, measuring 2.6 meters by 90 cm.

Construction Plymouths keel was laid down in 1931, by the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft in Kiel, Germany, as Alva. She was originally built as a yacht for William Kissam Vanderbilt II and was named Alva, after his mother, Alva Vanderbilt Belmont. She was given to the United States Navy on 4 November 1941, by her owner and was placed in reduced commission at Jacksonville, Florida, on 29 December 1941, with Commander F. W. Schmidt in command. Service history=Inshore Patrol Squadron, 1942-1943 She departed Jacksonville on 31 December for the Navy Yard, Washington, DC, arriving there on 4 January 1942. She sailed on 21 January and the next day entered the Norfolk Navy Yard. On 23 January, she was placed in commission in ordinary for conversion to a patrol gunboat. She was placed in full commission 20 April and assigned to Inshore Patrol Squadron, 5th Naval District, based at Norfolk, Virginia. On 8 May she departed Norfolk, forming part of the escort for a convoy en route to Key West, Florida. She was on continuous escort duty between New York, Norfolk, and Key West until 27 August 1942, when she steamed from New York as convoy escort for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, returning as escort for another convoy 12 September. She made two more convoy escort voyages to Guantanamo Bay and back to New York between 17 September and 24 October 1942. She then resumed escort duty between New York and Key West. During one period of this duty, 24 December 1942 to 13 June 1943, Plymouth completed eight convoy escort voyages from New York to Key West and back. On 2 March 1943, Plymouth collided with the submarine chaser USS SC-1024 off of Cape Hatteras, which resulted in the sinking of the submarine chaser. Sinking, 5 August 1943 On her last voyage, Plymouth departed New Jersey on 4 August 1943 as part of the escort for a convoy bound for Key West. At 21.37 hours the following evening she made underwater sound contact about 90 miles east of Elizabeth City, North Carolina. As she swung left, to bear on the target, a violent underwater explosion occurred just abaft the bridge. The force of the explosion rolled Plymouth to starboard. She then took on a heavy list to port with her entire port side forward of amidships in flames. She sank within two minutes. Lieutenant Ormsby M. Mitchel, Jr., USNR, in command of Plymouth, was thrown violently against a bulkhead and sustained serious injuries, which later required amputation of his left leg. Despite his own condition, he directed abandon ship operations, remaining at his post until the ship went down. Rescued from a raft by USCGC Calypso, Lieutenant Mitchel was awarded the Navy Cross for extraordinary heroism. Soundman 3/Class Franklin A. McGinty was also awarded the Navy Cross and Purple Heart posthumously. Ensign Rubin Keltch, of New York City, was also awarded the Navy Cross posthumously for his service aboard the Plymouth. Ensign Keltch unhesitatingly risked his life to assist several survivors to safety. After making sure they were safe he went back into the engine room to save several men, but although the men came out he never did. Rescue operations were hampered by heavy seas and sharks. Only 85 of the crew survived to be taken to Norfolk on 6 August. A Board of Investigation concluded that Plymouth had been sunk by a torpedo fired from an enemy submarine. The submarine was .

The album was remastered and re- released on October 5, 2004 in a digipak, packaged together with the remastered Fear Is the Mindkiller EP. Overview Guitarist Dino Cazares has stated that this album is a concept album, concerning man's creation of a machine that could be either technological or governmental. It was also confirmed by bassist Christian Olde Wolbers in an interview. The particular concept would later play a more prominent role in some of Fear Factory's later albums. The sound of the record is different from the later albums, as it was influenced by many different extreme sub-genres of metal, such as death metal, thrash metal and grindcore, hence making the band an \\"anomaly\\" among others since it did not fit into any genre category at that time. The sound was also heavily influenced by Napalm Death and Godflesh. Many feel this album is ground breaking as this is the first album to mix death growls with clean vocals. The album has been described as death metal with elements of grindcore by The Moshville Times. Author Colin Larkin of The Encyclopedia of Popular Music wrote \\"Soul of a New Machine established Fear Factory as a genuine death metal force, with a good collection of songs delivered with originality and ferocity.\\" The record featured a different conceptual style from Fear Factory's later works. \\"Martyr\\" is about how Burton C. Bell was \\"bored with his lifestyle\\"; \\"Leechmaster\\" and \\"Manipulation\\" are about relationship troubles; \\"Scapegoat\\" was based on how Cazares was once wrongfully accused by the law; \\"Crisis\\" is an anti-war song; \\"Crash Test\\" concerns animal testing and \\"Suffer Age\\" is based on serial killer John Wayne Gacy. The other songs contain different themes. Samples from the movies Full Metal Jacket, Blade Runner, and Apocalypse Now are heard sporadically throughout the album. Then- bassist Andrew Shives only played live with the group; the bass tracks on the album were performed by Dino Cazares (though Shives was credited as the band's bassist on the album). In 1993 Fear Factory released a 7\\" single under their Spanish name Factorio De Miedo called Sangre De Ninos. This is the only material that was ever recorded in a studio with Andrew Shives on bass. He was forced to leave the band due to some internal disputes and was replaced by Christian Olde Wolbers in December 1993. Professional wrestler Jerry Lynn used the song \\"Scapegoat\\" as his theme music during his time in Extreme Championship Wrestling. \\"Big God/Raped Souls\\" was used in The Crow: City of Angels. Reception AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier gave the album three stars out of five, remarking that \\"Fear Factory were quite ahead of their time in 1992\\". The critic also noted the diversity of the genres featured in the recording, saying that \\"Soul of a New Machine was so groundbreaking because it [fused] together some of the best aspects of numerous metal subgenres\\", which \\"[resulted] in a unique sound\\". Rock Hard rated the album highly, saying that the sound of the album was strange, indescribable yet required listening. Rock Hard also complimented the blending of various sub-genres, with particular note to Burton Bell for managing such an eclectic set of vocals. *Kerrang!

Life and works  Hottinger studied at Geneva, Groningen and Leiden. After visiting France and England he was appointed professor of church history in his native town of Z√ºrich in 1642. The chair of Hebrew at the Carolinum in Z√ºrich was added in 1643, and in 1653 he was appointed professor ordinarius of logic, rhetoric and theology. He gained such a reputation as an Oriental scholar that the Elector of the Palatinate in 1655 appointed him professor of Oriental languages and biblical criticism at the University of Heidelberg. While in Heidelberg he also worked to reestablish the Collegium Sapientiae, a Reformed theological seminary. In 1661 he returned to Z√ºrich, where in 1662 he was appointed principal of the University of Z√ºrich. In 1667 he accepted an invitation to succeed Johann Hoornbeck (1617‚Äì1666) as professor in the University of Leiden. Before he could take up this position he drowned with three of his children after the upsetting of a boat while crossing the river Limmat. His chief works are Historia ecclesiastica Nov. Test. (1651‚Äì1667); Thesaurus philologicus seu clavis scripturae (1649; 3rd ed. 1698); Etymologicon orientale, sive lexicon harmonicum heptaglotton (1661). He also wrote a Hebrew and an Aramaic grammar.

He collected Fechtb√ºcher and undertook to compile all knowledge of the art of fencing in a compendium surpassing all earlier books. For this, he engaged the painter J√∂rg Breu the Younger, as well as two experienced fencers, whom he charged with perfecting the techniques before they were painted. The project was very costly, taking a full four years, and according to Mair, consumed most of his family's income and property. Three versions of his compilation, and one later, less extensive manuscript, have been preserved. Not only did Mair spend huge sums on his collections and on his projects, he also had a very expensive lifestyle, frequently hosting receptions for the more important burghers of Augsburg. His own income was not sufficient for this, and during many years, he misappropriated funds from the city treasury, with the supervision of which he had been entrusted since 1541. His embezzlements were discovered in 1579, and Mair was hanged as a thief at the age of 62.

It is part of the 5th Canadian Division's 37 Canadian Brigade Group. Predecessor units trace their origins to 1795, and since 1949 Royal Newfoundland Regiment has been a unit of the Canadian Army. During the First World War the battalion-sized regiment was the only North American unit to fight in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. Later in the war the regiment was virtually wiped out at Beaumont Hamel on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, but was rebuilt and continued to serve throughout France and Belgium until the armistice, serving as part of the British Army of the Rhine in 1919. Since 1916, July 1 has been marked as Memorial Day in Newfoundland and Labrador. Lineage The government of Canada does not recognize an unbroken lineage of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment to earlier units as there were gaps in existence. However, it recognizes that the regiment commemorates the history and heritage of previous units. In this respect Canada has awarded three battle honours to the regiment to commemorate the services rendered during the War of 1812 by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry and it recognizes battle honours earned by an early iteration of the regiment during the First World War.

Bold type indicates honours authorized to be emblazoned on regimental colours Predecessor units= Militia units  Though the Royal Newfoundland Regiment traces its existence to 1795 and the establishment of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Foot, its origins are based in the existence of numerous local militia units raised in the colony in the eighteenth century. Prominent Newfoundland militias include Michael Gill's militia in the 1704 defence of Bonavista, the St. Mary's Militia that captured an American privateer during the American Revolution, and the 150 Newfoundland militiamen who served with the Royal Highland Emigrants during the Battle of Quebec.  Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Foot  As conflict between Revolutionary France and Britain increased in the 1790s, Britain found its overseas colonies threatened from French actions. Facing war on land and lacking the suitable land forces to defend its overseas colonies, in 1795 the British Government ordered Thomas Skinner of the Royal Engineers to raise a regiment for local defence purposes. Skinner was the engineering officer responsible for the construction of defensive positions atop Signal Hill in the aftermath of the French and Indian Wars. By the following year, strength for the regiment had reached 35 officers and 615 men, organized into 10 line infantry companies, one light infantry company, and one grenadier company. In September 1796, the French Navy was reported to be sailing for St. John's to invade the city; in response, the entirety of the Regiment of Foot erected tents atop Signal Hill and around Fort Amherst to give the appearance of a much larger force defending the city. The ruse was successful, causing the naval force to abandon any attempts to land at St. John's; instead, the navy sailed south for Bay Bulls and burned all of the houses before departing the area. In 1797 the Grenadier Company escorted Governor Waldergrave aboard , which had recently been the site of an unsuccessful mutiny attempt. Reenactors dressed in 1795 Grenadier uniform at Signal HillConditions in Newfoundland were harsh during this time period, even for the garrison soldiers. Winter food often spoiled, and a fire at Fort William in 1798 destroyed much of the regiment's bedding and medical supplies, making life that much harder for the soldiers. As a result, the desertion rate was high. Matters for the regiment further worsened in April 1800 when 50 soldiers loyal to the United Irish Movement attempt to desert en masse from Signal Hill. The alarm was sounded during their attempt, and 16 mutineers were captured. The newly appointed commanding officer, Brigadier John Skerrett (formerly of the West India Regiment) ordered the five ringleaders hung and the remaining deserters sent by prison ship to Halifax. Questioning the loyalty of his mostly-Irish soldiers, Brigadier Skerrett ordered the regiment's line companies (the bulk of the unit) to Halifax, receiving the 66th Regiment of Foot in its place. The regiment remained in Halifax for a further two years until peace with Revolutionary France came with the Treaty of Amiens. Having no further need for local defence units in North America, Britain disbanded the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Foot in March 1802.  Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry  Garrison duty = Peace for Britain was short-lived, and in 1803 the country once again found itself at war with Napoleonic France. Brigadier Skerrett was tasked with recruiting an infantry unit consisting of ten companies in Newfoundland for the purposes of local defence. Titled the Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry, the unit consisted of many veterans of the previous Newfoundland Regiment. By 1806 the regiment numbered nearly 700 men and was given the title Royal by King George III. 'Local defence' included all of British North America, and in 1807 the regiment was deployed to Fort Anne in Nova Scotia. The regiment was again transferred in 1808, this time to the Citadel in Quebec City where it remained until the outbreak of war in 1812. =War of 1812= The regiment, called at the time the Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry, was significantly involved in the War of 1812. In May 1812, weeks before outbreak of the war with the United States, Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, commander of his Majesty's Forces in Upper Canada, deployed the regiment into smaller companies or detachments, combined with other units or regiments in defensive positions all over the province. Some were employed as marines on board naval vessels on the Great Lakes as part of the Provincial Marine. These marines were involved in a number of notable naval actions during the war, including the Battle of Lake Erie and the capture of USS Tigress and USS Scorpion. Battles in which elements of the regiment took part included: Skirmish at Canard River July 16, 1812, Battle of Detroit Aug 16 1812, Battle of the River Raisin or Frenchtown, Michigan January 22, 1813, the British raid on Ogdensburg, New York February 22, 1813, the Battle of York (Toronto) April 27, 1813 and operations in northwest Ohio, including the siege of Fort Meigs in the spring of 1813 and the Battle of Fort George (Niagara-on- the-Lake) May 25‚Äì27, 1813. The regiment was also involved in the British Raid on Sacket's Harbour, New York on May 29, 1813 and provided soldiers who served as marines in the Battle of Lake Erie on September 10, 1813. The regiment's service continued at the Battle of the Thames or Moraviantown on October 5, 1813 and in northern Michigan at the Battle of Michilimackinac or Mackinac Island August 4, 1814 and as part of the capture of American naval vessels Tigress September 3, 1814 and Scorpion on Upper Lake Huron on September 6, 1814. It was largely distributed throughout the zone as attached sub-units and not as a formed battalion and was disbanded in 1816. A monument depicting a toy soldier of the 1813 Royal Newfoundland Regiment standing over a fallen American toy soldier was unveiled in Toronto in November 2008. The War of 1812 Monument in Ottawa, which is situated across from the National War Memorial, also features a soldier of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment ‚Äì one of seven bronze figures which stands on top of that monument. In 2012, on the occasion of the bicentennial of the War of 1812, the Government of Canada, responding to recommendations made by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment Advisory Council and similar recommendations made by an advisory committee to the Minister of Canadian Heritage for the War of 1812, awarded the Royal Newfoundland Regiment three battle honours. These were for the victory at Detroit in 1812, for the regiment's role at the battle of Maumee in 1813 and a general \\"theatre honour\\" (\\"Defence of Canada 1812‚Äì1815\\"), for the regiment's broader service in successful engagements throughout the War of 1812. Colours emblazoned with these battle honours were presented to the regiment's 2nd battalion in the presence of their Colonel-in-Chief, the Princess Royal, in June 2016.http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2016-06-30/article-4574904/Princess- Anne-presents-new%2C-consecrated-flags-to-Newfoundland-Regiments-2nd- Battalion/1 The ceremonies coincided with events marking the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Beaumont-Hamel.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland- labrador/memorial-day-crowds-newfoundland-regiment-stjohns-1.3661735 The Royal Newfoundland Regiment of Fencible Infantry was disbanded in 1816 following the conclusion of hostilities with both America and Napoleonic France. Newfoundland did not see another military unit in the island until 1824 with the establishment of the Royal Newfoundland Veteran Companies. Although similar in name, this unit consisted of Chelsea Pensioners from the United Kingdom and was not recruited locally. The Newfoundland Companies therefore have no relationship with the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. Royal Newfoundland Regiment in the First World War=Outbreak of war Dr. alt=A soldier in uniform sitting on a camel posed in front of the Great Sphinx of Giza During the First World War Newfoundland was a largely rural Dominion of the British Empire with a population of 240,000 people, and not yet part of Canada. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led the Government of Newfoundland to recruit a force for service with the British Army. Even though the island had not possessed any formal army organization since 1870, enough men soon volunteered that a whole battalion was formed, and later maintained throughout the war. The first recruits in the regiment were nicknamed the \\"Blue Puttees\\" due to the unusual colour of the puttees, chosen to give the Newfoundland Regiment a unique look and due to the unavailability of woolen khakis on the island. The blue puttees were quickly abandoned when the first five hundred reached England in October 1914. The headquarters for recruiting and training was also supplied by the CLB, as was the nucleus of the command structure. In fact, the first man to enlist was also a member of the CLB. Bermudian-born Sir Joseph Outerbridge, who had been the Commanding Officer of the Church Lads' Brigade from 1890 to 1894, was the Vice President of the Patriotic Association of Newfoundland, which raised and maintained the Newfoundland Regiment, two of his sons serving in the regiment on the Western Front. The regiment trained at various locations in the United Kingdom and increased from an initial contingent of 500 men to full battalion strength of 1,000 men, before being deployed. After a period of acclimatization in Egypt, the regiment was deployed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula with the 29th Division in support of the Gallipoli Campaign.  1st Battalion Gallipoli= On 20 September 1915 the regiment landed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula, where the British VIII Corps, IX Corps and the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) had been attempting to seize control of the Dardanelles Strait from Turkey since the first landings on 25 April. At Gallipoli the 1st Newfoundland Regiment faced snipers, artillery fire and severe cold, as well as the trench warfare hazards of cholera, dysentery, typhus, gangrene and trench foot. Over the next three months thirty soldiers of the regiment were killed or mortally wounded in action and ten died of disease; 150 were treated for frostbite and exposure. Despite the terrible conditions, the Newfoundlanders stood up well. When the decision was made to evacuate all British Empire forces from the area, the regiment was chosen to be a part of the rearguard, finally withdrawing from Gallipoli with the last of the British Dardanelles Army troops on 9 January 1916. With the close of the Gallipoli Campaign the regiment spent a short period recuperating before being transferred to the Western Front in March 1916. =Battle of the Somme= Restored photo of Regiment members in St. John's Road, a support trench, 200 metres behind the British forward line at Beaumont Hamel, 1916 In France, the regiment regained battalion strength in preparation for the Battle of the Somme. The regiment, still in the 29th Division, went into the line in April 1916 at Beaumont-Hamel. Beaumont-Hamel was situated near the northern end of the 45-kilometre front being assaulted by the joint French and British force. The attack, originally scheduled for June 29, 1916, was postponed by two days to July 1, 1916, partly on account of inclement weather, and partly to allow more time for the artillery preparation. The 29th Division, with its three infantry brigades, faced defences manned by experienced troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment of the 26th (Wurttemberg) Reserve Division. The 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment had been involved in the invasion of France in August 1914 and had been manning the Beaumont-Hamel section of the line for nearly 20 months prior to the battle. The German troops had been spending a great deal of their time not only training but fortifying their position, including the construction of numerous deep dugouts and at least two tunnels.Sheldon p. 66 [Contemporary map of the dugouts and tunnels associated directly with Y Ravine in June 1916] Newfoundland soldiers waiting in St. John's Road support trench The infantry assault by the 29th Division on 1 July 1916 was preceded ten minutes earlier by a mine explosion under the fortified Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. The explosion of the Hawthorn Mine underneath the German lines destroyed a major enemy strong point but also served to alert the German forces to the imminent attack. Following the explosion, troops of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment moved from their dugouts into the firing line, even preventing the British from taking control of the crater as they had planned. When the assault finally began, the troops from the 86th and 87th Brigade of the 29th Division were quickly stopped. With the exception of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers on the right flank, the initial assault foundered in No Man's Land at and short of the German barbed wire. At divisional headquarters, Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle and his staff were trying to unravel the numerous and confusing messages coming back from observation posts, contact aircraft and the two leading brigades. There were indications that some troops had broken into and gone beyond the German first line. In an effort to exploit the perceived break in the German line he ordered the 88th Brigade, which was in reserve, to send forward two battalions to support attack. At 8:45 a.m. the Newfoundland Regiment and 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment received orders to move forward. The Newfoundland Regiment was situated at St. John's Road, a support trench behind the British forward line and out of sight of the enemy. Movement forward through the communication trenches was not possible because they were congested with dead and wounded men and under shell fire. Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Lovell Hadow, the battalion commander, decided to move immediately into attack formation and advance across the surface, which involved first navigating through the British barbed wire defences. As they breasted the skyline behind the British first line, they were effectively the only troops moving on the battlefield and clearly visible to the German defenders. Subjected to the full force of the 119th (Reserve) Infantry Regiment, most of the Newfoundland Regiment who had started forward were dead, dying or wounded within 15 to 20 minutes of leaving St. John's Road trench. Most reached no further than the Danger Tree, a skeleton of a tree that lay in No Man's Land that was being utilized as a landmark. So far as can be ascertained, 22 officers and 758 other ranks were directly involved in the advance. Of these, all the officers and slightly under 658 other ranks became casualties. Of the 780 men who went forward only about 110 survived unscathed, of whom only 68 were available for roll call the following day. For all intents and purposes the Newfoundland Regiment had been wiped out, the unit as a whole having suffered a casualty rate of approximately 90 percent. The only unit to suffer greater casualties during the attack was the 10th (Service) Battalion, Prince of Wales's Own (West Yorkshire Regiment), attacking west of Fricourt village. =After Beaumont- Hamel= Royal Newfoundland Regiment crossing the Rhine into Germany, 1918 Although significantly under strength, the Newfoundland Regiment continued to see service and after taking on reinforcements was back in the front line on 14 July near Auchonvillers. On 17 July the 88th Brigade was transferred to a quieter portion of the Western Front. In the weeks and months following the attack, the surviving officers wrote letters of condolence to families and relatives in Newfoundland. A period of recovery coupled with additional reinforcements eventually helped the regiment return to full strength. Six weeks later they were beating off a German gas attack in Flanders. Subsequently, they distinguished themselves in a number of battles: back on the Somme at Gueudecourt in October 1916; and on 23 April 1917, at Monchy-le- Preux during the Battle of Arras, where they lost 485 men in a day but checked a German attack. In Flanders during the Third Battle of Ypres the battalion attacked on 16 August at the Battle of Langemarck and on 9 October 1917 the battalion formed the left flank of 29th Division's attack as part of the Battle of Poelcappelle. In November 1917 at Masni√®res-Marcoing during the Battle of Cambrai the regiment stood its ground although outflanked and in April 1918 stemmed a German advance at Bailleul. Following a period out of the line, providing the guard force for General Headquarters at Montreuil, they joined the 28th Brigade of the 9th (Scottish) Division and were in action again at Ledegem and beyond in the advances of the Hundred Days Offensive during which Thomas Ricketts became the youngest soldier of the war to win the Victoria Cross.  Other battalions  In addition to the 1st Battalion detailed above, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment raised a further two battalions during the war: the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion, and the 3rd Battalion. The 2nd Battalion served as the primary overseas training and holding unit for both new recruits prior to deployment with the 1st Battalion and as the holding battalion for soldiers returned to Britain for medical reasons. The 2nd Battalion spent the majority of the war in Scotland, most famously at Ayr. The 3rd Battalion was the title given to the recruiting and training unit based in St. John's, and was the administrative home of new recruits before embarking overseas, as well as being the formation responsible for home defence. Thus, soldiers recruited in Newfoundland and Labrador were be posted first to the 3rd Battalion, then the 2nd, and finally with the 1st. In addition to its three battalions, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment played a part in the administration of the Newfoundland Forestry Corps. Formed in 1917, the corps was a uniformed pioneer unit stationed in Scotland tasked with supporting the British war effort by providing much needed timber for the war effort. Volunteers were clothed in khaki uniform and wore the distinctive Caribou cap badge of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. In addition, some wounded officers and enlisted ranks from the 1st Battalion whose wounds prohibited them from combat service were posted to the Forestry Corps in command positions. First World War honours Governor Davidson strongly felt that the Newfoundland Regiment deserved special recognition for its actions during the battles of Ypres and Cambrai. His request to the British Government to add the prefix Royal to the regiment's name was granted and George V bestowed the regiment with the prefix in December 1917. This was the only time during the First World War that this honour was given and only the third time in the history of the British Army that it has been given during a time of war.  Second World War  When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany on September 3, 1939, Newfoundland too found itself at war. The presence of the German Navy in Atlantic waters threatened the security of the colony, and in September 1939 it was decided to raise the Newfoundland Militia, a local defence militia unit for the defence of the island. The Newfoundland Militia was tasked with guarding strategic positions on the island, including the dry docks, water supply, and oil reserves in St. John's and the Newfoundland Broadcasting Company's radio station in Mount Pearl. Later, these guard duties were expanded to include the maintenance of a coastal defence battery on Bell Island to protect the Wabana Iron Ore Mines, and mines and docks throughout the rest of the island. Following the Battle of France, Canada assumed responsibility for the defence of Newfoundland with the establishment of W Force.Kavanagh, Robert L. \\"W Force: The Canadian Army and the Defence of Newfoundland in the Second World War.\\" MA Thesis. Memorial University of Newfoundland. April, 1995. http://research.library.mun.ca/5557/1/Kavanagh_RobertL.pdf The Newfoundland Militia was immediately placed under command of W Force. The efforts of the Canadian Army to expand and train the militia to professional standards resulted in the Newfoundland Militia being re-designated the Newfoundland Regiment on March 2, 1943. The regiment stayed in a home-defence role, but in addition to these duties was also tasked with training excess recruits for the two regiments of the Royal Artillery that were recruited in Newfoundland for overseas service: the 166th (Newfoundland) Field Artillery Regiment and 59th (Newfoundland) Heavy Artillery Regiment. By the end of the Second World War, 1,668 Newfoundlanders had enlisted for service; 820 had deployed overseas with the Royal Artillery while a further 447 trained gunners were in Newfoundland awaiting transport to Europe on VE Day. 17 members of the regiment were killed on December 12, 1942, during the Knights of Columbus Hostel fire in St. John's. Later history In 1949, after a pair of referenda, Newfoundland joined Canada as the latter's 10th province. One of the Terms of Union, Term 44, specified the re-creation of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, which became the primary militia unit for the province. The regiment is ranked last in the Canadian Forces order of precedence due to Newfoundland's entry into Canada in 1949, long after other Canadian regiments were recognized in the order of precedence. The Freedom of the City was exercised by the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador on July 1, 1963.Freedom of the city On March 1, 1961, owing to low numbers in both units the Royal Newfoundland Regiment amalgamated with the 166th (Newfoundland) Field Artillery Regiment, RCA inheriting the guns of that unit. Since 1992, soldiers and sub-units of the regiment have served to augment Regular Force units in Cyprus, Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan on peacekeeping and combat missions. On 30 August 2010, Corporal Brian Pinksen died of his wounds eight days after being injured by an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan, making him the regiment's first combat fatality since the First World War. Band The Royal Newfoundland Regiment Band is presently the only military band active in Newfoundland and Labrador. Being part of the primary reserve, the band is an composed of volunteer members, many of whom have studied and trained at the Logistics Training Centre Music Division at CFB Borden. The first mention of a bugle and drum band in the regiment during the First World War was made in The Fighting Newfoundlander. Its members were drawn from the regular ranks of infantry on an ad hoc basis. Many of that band's instruments were destroyed frm artillery fire on the beaches of Gallipoli in September 1915.http://regiment.mi.mun.ca/band.htm In 2018, an antique drum from the regiment dating back to that era was brought to the regimental museum for preservation.https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5021496 The basis for the modern band was founded in 1956 as the Loyal Orange Band from Topsail. Under the direction of Edgar Adams, the band was asked to serve as the band of the regiment, amalgamating in 1962 with the 166th Heavy Field Regiment Band and the band relocated from Buckmaster's Circle to its present headquarters at CFS St. John's.http://www.rnfldr.ca/regiment.aspx?item=191 It performs at numerous military and civilian functions such as dinners, public visits and military parades. Among these events was the Trooping of the Colour for Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1966 and the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1978. Other notable events have included the Presentation of Colours in 1983, Pope John Paul II's visit in 1984, the state visit by Baudouin of Belgium and the royal visit of Prince Charles in 2009.https://www.gov.nl.ca/RoyalVisit/photos/welcoming_ceremonies.htmhttps://www.heritage.nf.ca/first- world-war/ Alliances * ‚Äì The Royal Scots Borderers * ‚Äì The Royal New South Wales Regiment  Select members of the regiment  * Captain Andrew Bulger * Colonel James Forbes-Robertson, VC, DSO*, MC, DL * Colonel Cluny MacPherson, CMG, FRCS * Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Nangle * Sergeant Thomas Ricketts, VC * Private Francis Lind See also * The Canadian Crown and the Canadian Forces * National War Memorial (Newfoundland) * Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial * List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage Order of precedenceNotes=Bibliography  External links * The Royal Newfoundland Regiment Museum * The Royal Newfoundland Regiment * Royal Newfoundland Regiment Advisory Council * The Newfoundland Regiment and the Great War * Great War Living History Committee ‚Äì R Nfld R Interpretation * Defending the Inland Shores: Newfoundland in the War of 1812 ‚Äì Gordon K.

During an attempted ascent that would have made her the first American woman to summit Everest, she plunged over the edge of the Great Couloir to her death, as the result of an unsecured climbing harness. According to Everest expedition leader Lou Whittaker, Hoey was probably the world's best female high-altitude mountaineer at the time of her death. She had scaled Washington's Mount Rainier over 100 times and led expeditions on Alaska's Denali. Everest fall and aftermath Expedition teammate Jim Wickwire said that he and Hoey were perched on a 45-degree rock slope at about , carrying gear to establish Camp 6, with the expectation of heading for the summit in the next day or two. Wickwire said that Hoey leaned back to let him go ahead, and a buckle on her harness opened, releasing her from the fixed rope and sending her plunging down into a crevasse. Hoey's body was never recovered. Whittaker said, \\"I can't think of a more beautiful resting place; she fell into the prettiest place that ever was.\\" Whittaker cited Hoey's death as a contributing factor to the expedition's failure to summit Everest, saying: \\"If Marty had been with us, we would have made it.\\" The 16 remaining team members, all men, would make a third and final attempt, and ultimately be turned back, shy of the summit, by fierce weather. Background Hoey worked for Dick Bass, as safety patrol chief at the Snowbird ski resort. She befriended him and accompanied him on his successful ascent of Mount McKinley, and he was a member of her climbing group when she perished on Mount Everest, in 1982. When Bass eventually summitted Everest in 1985, he dedicated his ascent to her. In context Marty was one of ten fatalities on Everest in the 1982 climbing season, but the only American.Everest - Fatilities Some other fatalities that season were noted British climbers Peter Boardman and Joe Tasker.

The camera nameplates show the name \\"KIEV\\", with older cameras using \\"–ö–ò–ï–í\\" (in Russian language) or \\"–ö–ò–á–í\\" (in Ukrainian language)http://www.ussrphoto.com/Wiki/default.asp?WikiCatID=20&ParentID;=1&ContentID;=560&Item;=Kiev+3+%2F+III+Ukrainian+Logo in Cyrillic. At the end of November 2009 Gevorg Vartanyan of Arax, a Ukrainian distributor of reworked medium format Kiev cameras and lenses, wrote to tell customers that the Arsenal factory was closing after 245 years of operation. The email said that management had been turned over to the Special Construction Department (SKTB), all work had stopped and the workers laid off, and that the factory warehouse was empty. He thought that Arax had enough cameras and parts to remain in business for at least another 4‚Äì5 years. The amount of stock remaining with other distributors around the world is unknown.  Kiev medium format cameras  The Kiev brand is probably best known for two 6√ó6 medium format cameras:  Kiev 88  Original Kiev88 with 90mm Vega-12B An almost direct clone of the original Hasselblad 1600 F sometimes jokingly referred to as a Hasselbladski. Originally called \\"Salyut\\", it added a self- timer mechanism below the film advance knob to the original Hasselblad design. However, this add-on was abandoned and is seen only on very early or prototype cameras. The Salyut went into mass production around 1957. An automatic aperture mechanism was later added and the camera's designation was changed to \\"Salyut C\\". After \\"Salyut C\\" the camera model evolved into \\"Kiev 80\\". With the further addition of a hot shoe for electronic flashes, the camera's name became \\"Kiev 88\\". It was sometimes exported to the West as the \\"Zenith 80\\". The Kiev 88 used a screw type lens mount similar to the original Hasselblad mount, however there are mixed reports on compatibility between the two. Most film backs are not compatible between Kievs and Hasselblads due to different gear mechanisms. However, Kiev 88 viewfinders are compatible with the Hasselblad 1600F and 1000F, and even current Hasselblad V-system models. The Kiev 88 lens mount was modified to accept most Pentacon Six mount lenses around 1999 and designated the Kiev 88CM. Many of these cameras have found their way around the world, especially to the United States. They are considered inexpensive alternatives in the medium film format camera market (see below).  Kiev 60  Kiev 60 TTL The Kiev 60 is similar to an enlarged 35 mm SLR, based loosely on the Pentacon Six and using the same breech-lock lens mount. This camera was originally called the Kiev 6C with a shutter release button activated by the left hand, and accepting both 220 and 120 film. The current Kiev 60 has a more conventional right-handed shutter release, but does not take 220 film. The Kiev 60 has a simpler frame- advancement mechanism than the Pentacon Six but it is often poorly adjusted at the factory resulting in incorrect frame spacing. This problem can be fixed. There is both a waist level finder and metered prism finder available. It has no removable film back, thus making the Kiev 60 design simpler and less prone to light leaks, which is sometimes a problem with the Kiev 88 design.  Attractions of Kiev cameras, and problems  The low price of the Kiev medium format cameras has attracted many amateur photographers wishing to enter the medium format camera market on a budget. Some have reported that the prices of a Kiev camera setup with other Russian or Ukrainian components (e.g. lenses) can be 1/10 to 1/15 the price of a similar Hasselblad setup. This being true for comparison with other similar cameras in the 1990s and still for today regarding specifically Hasselblad, the prices of 6x4.5, 6x6 and 6x7 SLR cameras and lenses from more reliable producers like Mamiya, Bronica and Pentax came down to prices comparable or even cheaper as for Kievs beginning by the mid 2000s. Historically, the Arsenal plant is reported to have generally poor quality control and some buyers have reported receiving cameras with small cosmetic or functional defects. Many of the less favorable reviews come from people comparing the camera directly to the more expensive Hasselblad models. The quality control seems to have fluctuated throughout different years of production though, and thus varies from camera to camera. For this reason a number of third party distributors have appeared offering Kiev cameras in safer, quality controlled forms. However some have taken advantage of the Arsenal plant's variable quality to add value through varying levels of third-party rebuilding, modification, and testing of the Arsenal- supplied cameras. The cameras however, still have a number of quirks that no simple servicing will remove. The most notable quirk is that the shutter speed on some of the original Kiev 88 cameras should only be changed after cocking the shutter (spring-loading the shutter mechanism and advancing the film). Changing the shutter speed on an un-cocked camera will damage the timing mechanism. This is not a problem with the Kiev 60 and Kiev 88CM variants. There are also mixed reports that the shutter speed dial should be turned only clock-wise, never anti-clock-wise. This is certainly known to be an issue with cameras modified by Hartblei to add a mirror lock-up (MLU) feature. Other cameras may or may not have this problem.  Common modifications  Kiev 60 modified for the 6√ó4.5 frame and MLU with Arsat 30mm Fisheye lens The vendors that sell Kiev cameras outside of the former Soviet Union often make their own modifications to the cheap and basic cameras coming from the factory. Mirror lock-up is a feature that can be added to the Salyut-C, Kiev-88 and Kiev-60. This removes the small amount of motion blur that can be caused by the mirror hitting the top of the mirror box just before the shutter opens. (Other sources of motion-blur still remain however). It is most useful when the subject is greatly magnified e.g. using a long or telephoto lens, or doing macro photography. The Kiev 60 is sometimes modified to shoot with a 6x4.5 frame size, often called \\"Kiev 645\\" or similar, yielding more pictures per roll of film in a \\"print-friendly\\" rectangular format versus the original camera's square 6x6 format. But since the film feeds sideways, the 6x4.5 variant produces photos in the portrait aspect, as opposed to the landscape aspect seen in most other cameras. The Kiev 88 can shoot the 6x4.5 frame size by simply using a different film back. The 6x4.5 film back is interchangeable with others for 6x6 and other frame sizes, while the Kiev 60 modification is permanent.  Lenses  One of the reasons for the lasting demand for these cameras is the price of the lenses that can be used on them. Despite the cheap price, the Kiev lenses are high quality optic wise, with many of the lenses being based on Zeiss designs. Among the best is the Arsat MC 1:3.5/30 mm fisheye lens, previously known as the \\"Zodiak 8\\" in a single-coated version. This lens is reputedly quite good and generally available for under US$250, which is stunning since one would have to spend many thousands of dollars to get a non-Ukrainian equivalent lens of this type. Medium format lenses produced by Arsenal for Kiev cameras: * 1:3.5/30 mm Arsat fisheye lens (formerly called Zodiak 8) * 1:3.5/45 mm Arsat (formerly called Mir-26) * 1:4.5/55 mm Arsat shift lens * 1:3.5/65 mm Mir-38 * 1:3.5/65 mm Mir-3 (discontinued ‚Äì was much larger than the later Mir-38) * 1:2.8/80 mm Arsat (formerly called Volna) * 1:2.8/90 mm Vega-12 * 1:2.8/120 mm Vega-28 * 1:2.8/150 mm Kaleinar-3 * 1:4.5/80‚Äì200 mm ARSAT-M Zoom * 1:3.5/250 mm Arsat (formerly called Jupiter-36) * 1:5.6/250 mm Arsat (formerly called Telear-5) * 1:4.5/300 mm Tair-33 (discontinued) * 1:8.0/600 mm Arsat (formerly called ZM-3) The 1:5.6 and 1:8.0/500 mm Rubinar Catadioptric (mirror) lenses are sometimes adapted to fit on Kiev medium format cameras. Shift and Tilt-Shift lenses based on the 45 mm and 65 mm optics are also available. These lenses allow photographers to take advantage of the Scheimpflug principle for achieving greater apparent depth of field without adjusting the aperture, and gain other controls similar to those found on view cameras.  Kiev 35 mm cameras  Kiev 4A rangefinder camera Kiev 4 with Jupiter-8M lens and original camera case Kiev also produced several 35 mm film rangefinder cameras which were clones of the pre-war Contax II and Contax III cameras, and a range of 35mm SLR cameras. After the war had ended, the Soviet Union demanded new sets of Contax tools from the original toolmaker in Dresden and then ordered a fair number of trial cameras to be made with Zeiss trademarks and coated lenses from these 1946 in postwar East Germany. With this successful, everything together with German instructors were transferred to Kyiv. Missing specialists were in a few cases recruited in West Germany. Any still available parts went in the same direction. In fact, removing the front of some very early Kiev II cameras, one could see that the metal was originally stamped with the Contax name, then pressed out and re-stamped as Kiev. Kiev 19 body Kiev rangefinders retained the same lens mount as the prewar Contax rangefinders and the lenses can be interchanged. The cameras went through a few minor modifications to become the Kiev III and eventually Kiev 4. There was also a Kiev 5 with a modernized upper part with integrated meter. Attractive, though poorly made and unreliable, its production was soon terminated. The other models were kept in continually downgraded production until the 1980s. The number of Kievs vastly exceeded that of the pre-war Dresden and post-war Jena and Stuttgart Contaxes. 35 mm rangefinder lenses, all pre-war Zeiss designs except the newer 1.8/53 made by Arsenal and other Soviet lens manufacturers: * 1:6.0/28 mm Orion-15 * 1:2.8/35 mm Jupiter-12 * 1:1.5/50 mm Jupiter-3 * 1:2.0/50 mm Jupiter-8 * 1:1.8/53 mm Helios-103 * 1:2.0/85 mm Jupiter-9 * 1:4.0/135 mm Jupiter-11 Kiev also made a range of 35 mm SLR cameras: * The Kiev 10, which was among the first 35mm SLRs with automatic exposure. * The Kiev 15, a successor to the Kiev 10. * The Kiev 17, desirable due to its Nikon mount. Full manual without meter. * The Kiev 19, which is partly restyled successor to the 17. Stop-down TTL-metering with red light-balance LEDs in Viewfinder. Top speed reduced from 1/1000 to 1/500. * The Kiev 20, which adds aperture coupling and a self-timer to the 19 design. 1/1000 top speed. * The Kiev 19m, which uses a molded polycarbonate body in later versions, rather than the metal used in earlier models. Despite its model number, it succeeds the Kiev 20. Same top speed as the plain 19, though. The unique Kiev 10 and 15 both used their own unique lens mount; only a handful of lenses were available in that format. Both the Kiev 10 and the Kiev 15 use an unusual fan shaped shutter. They are collector's items that were not exported. The Kiev 35A is an aperture priority point-and-shoot 35 mm camera, identical to the Minox 35 EL and probably made from transferred tooling, albeit under very different conditions as in 1946. The Kiev 17 and later 19/20-Line, available since around 1980, constituted some of the most westernized 35 mm SLRs available in the days of the Soviet Union. To satisfy the large internal demand, there was no discernible export at the time they would have found a ready market in the West. Instead, the Zenit with an external selenium meter was sold in large numbers. It was Soviet policy to export domestic surplus rather than the more desirable items of their manufacture.

In minutes, eighty-five percent of the buildings in Tangshan collapsed or were unusable, all services failed, and most of the highway and railway bridges collapsed or were seriously damaged.. At least 242,000 people died (some have said three times that), making this the third (or possibly second) deadliest earthquake in recorded history.See the #Death toll section for the various fatality figures. Tangshan was the most notable of several disasters in 1976, which in Chinese tradition might signal that the government had lost political legitimacy.; . Yeoh called the Tangshan earthquake \\"[p]robably one of the deadliest wraths of nature in modern times\\". Nonetheless, the government's response showed that it was prepared and competent to quickly provide relief..  The earthquakes  The Tangshan earthquake was complex, with multiple events. There were two main shocks. The first struck at 3:42:56 in the morning (local time), approximately 12 km under the southern part of Tangshan.. The was initially estimated at around 8.1, subsequently recalculated to be 7.6 on the standard scale. However, that scale measures only the total energy released by an earthquake, and earthquakes vary in how much of that energy is converted to seismic shaking. The Tangshan quake, being relatively shallow, converted much of its energy to surface shaking, and on the (surface magnitude) scale it also measured 7.6. (7.8 on the Chinese surface magnitude scale..) This \\"occurred on a near vertical right-lateral strike-slip fault, striking N40¬∞E\\",. See figure 12 (p. 218) for an illustration. See also , . the block on the southeast side sliding about three meters to the southwest.. This resulted from tectonic compression on a nearly west‚Äìeast axis.; . Surface rupturing occurred in five en echelon segments extending eight kilometers through the center of Tangshan., and see figure 4.17. The second main shock, with a magnitude 7.0 , or 7.4 , struck that afternoon at 18:45 near Luanhsien (Luanxian), about 70 km to the east- northeast (\\"B\\" on the intensity map in the next section), just south of the northeastern end of the Tangshan fault.. This occurred in a zone of north- northwest striking conjugate faults that cut across the north end of the Tangshan fault. The left-lateral motion here, along with the right-lateral motion on the Tangshan fault, suggests that as the crustal blocks to the west and east are compressed together the block between these two earthquakes is being squeezed out to the south. A long sequence of aftershocks followed, with twelve of magnitude 6 or greater.. The first of these struck just three and a half hours after the initial shock, at 7:17, at the southern end of Tangshan fault, near Ninghe (\\"C\\" on the map in the section below),, and see Table 4, p. 12. with a magnitude of 6.2 . Another significant aftershock () occurred in November near Ninghe. Most aftershocks occurred between these end points, in a zone 140 km long and about 50 km wide., and see figure 15 in . Many buildings were further damaged by the aftershocks.. Damage The damage done by an earthquake depends primarily on two factors. First, the intensity of shaking, which depends mainly on the magnitude of the earthquake rupture, the distance from the epicenter, and the nature of the local soil and topography, with soft soils (e.g., sediments and fill) more likely to amplify the intensity and duration of the shaking.. See also , which plots damage as a function of epicentral distance and a measure of building strength. Second, the design and construction of the structures being shaken, with houses built of adobe or stone, wooden houses without a well-built frame, and unreinforced masonry construction being especially vulnerable.. The seismic risk had been greatly underestimated and almost all buildings and structures were designed and built without seismic considerations. As a result, Tangshan was \\"mainly a city of unreinforced brick buildings\\", sitting right on top of a major earthquake. The power (magnitude) of the Tangshan earthquake is indicated by the extent of where it was felt: up to away, across most of northeastern China, and even in Mongolia and Korea.; [6]. In and around Beijing, from the epicenter, the shaking reached an intensity of VI on the Chinese intensity scale (similar to the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale), with nearly 10% of all buildings damaged, [74]. and at least 50 people died. The economic loss totaled to 10 billion yuan..  Intensity XI and X zone  Tangshan earthquake site The rupture occurred under the southern part of the city, and propagated northeastward on a fault that runs through the middle of the city. The maximum intensity was \\"XI\\" (eleven) on the 12-degree Chinese scale. Nearly every building and structure in the city collapsed, wholly or partially, infrastructure was severely damaged, and essential services such as electric power, water supply, and communications were entirely knocked out. This area of maximum damage ‚Äì the meizoseismal area ‚Äì was approximately long and from 3.5 to 5.5 km wide, centered roughly along the railway., and see figure 2, p. 182\\\\. An isoseismal map can be found in the front matter of Volume 4. The area of intensity X shaking ‚Äì where only new, one-story brick buildings were merely \\"damaged or slightly damaged\\", the rest being severely damaged or worse ‚Äì was 36 km long and 15 km across.. In this \\"high intensity\\" zone (intensity X and XI, within the red contour on the map) 20 highway bridges and five railway bridges cross the Douhe River in Tangshan; only six survived with only minor damage.  Intensity IX and VIII zone  Shaking of intensity IX (or greater) occurred in a zone roughly long and (about 1800 km2, inner orange contour on the map), and also around the aftershocks at Luanxian and Ninghe. In this zone most buildings classified as Class III (well-built buildings of wood, masonry, or reinforced concrete.) survived,, Table 1. but many Class II buildings (typically old wood-frame buildings lacking a well-built frame, and quite common outside of the cities) were destroyed, while a majority of Class I buildings (built of adobe or stone) were destroyed. Further out (to the outer orange contour), and around the city of Tianjin and a few isolated patches, intensity VIII shaking mostly affected Class I buildings (more than half destroyed), bridges, and tall brick chimneys. Railway track was also subject to bending or displacement, depending on soil conditions.  Intensity VII zone  The zone of intensity VII shaking ‚Äì inside the dark brown contour ‚Äì marks the extent of moderate damage, where many Class I structures (of weak design or construction) were damaged but only \\"few\\"‚Äîbetween 10% and 30%‚Äîwere destroyed, and only a \\"few\\" Class two buildings damaged. This ellipsoid zone extended about 75 km north and south of Tangshan and 120 km east and west, from about 25 km short of Beijing to short of Qinhuangdao City (which had anomalously higher shaking), and from the Sea of Bohai in the south and southwest to just north of Zunhua. The north‚Äìsouth shortening of this zone is attributed to buttressing by the bedrock of the Yanshin mountains. Significant damage occurred beyond this in the VI zone, but (like in Beijing) affected less than 10% of the buildings, or occurred in small localized areas..  Coal mines  Mining coal is Tangshan's principal industry, and when the quake struck around 10,000 miners were underground. For the most part the mine roadways (tunnels) were not seriously damaged, but with the loss of electrical power there was no illumination (aside from headlamps), no ventilation, and no working lifts.. It is reported that most miners escaped within hours, but that some did not reach the surface until two weeks later.; . Most of the damage to the vertical shafts occurred within the first 50 meters, where they pass through the water-bearing alluvium. In many cases the concrete liner built to keep out the water cracked (particularly where not built properly), allowing a much greater inflow of water. Coupled with damage to the underground drainage system and lack of power to drive the pumps, many of the various mines flooded.. Some electrical power to the mines was restored in three days, and some coal production resumed within ten days.. However, de- watering, overhauling of flooded electrical equipment, and rebuilding of surface buildings and structures continued for a year and a half; the pre- earthquake level of production was not reached until the end of 1977.  Railways  The Beijing‚ÄìShanhaiguan Railway (built in 1887) is a double-track Class I trunk line that runs from Beijing southeast to Tianjin and Tanggu, then turns northeast to cross the Yongdingxin River and its estuary to run to Ninghe and then Tangshan. From Tangshan it continues northeast and then east to Chengli, and then to Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan. This is the principal connection of Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan to the seaports, and to Northeast China. The Tongxian to Tuozitou (within modern-day Luan County) Railway (built in 1976) is a single-track Class I trunk line that runs east from the eastern outskirts of Beijing to where it meets the Beijing to Shanhaiguan line northeast of Tangshan (near the epicenter of the M 7.1 quake)., and see figures 1 and 4, pp. 40 and 41. All of this was built \\"with no consideration for earthquake resistant design\\",. although some \\"earthquake resistance measures\\" for large and medium bridges were applied following the 1975 Haicheng earthquake. These vital arteries (and other railways and branch lines) were seriously damaged by the earthquakes, mainly in the areas of intensity IX or greater shaking.. (This includes a large area around Tangshan quake, and areas around Ninghe and Luanhsien following the M 6.9 and M 7.4 aftershocks.) At the time of the main quake there were 28 freight trains and seven passenger trains traveling on the Beijing‚ÄìShanhaiguan line in the affected area; seven freight trains and two passenger trains derailed due to derangement of the rails,. mostly south of Tangshan. where the line was built on loose alluvium, diluvium, and occasional stretches of loose sand. In many of these cases ‚Äì and also similar cases northeast of Tangshan, and on the Tongxian‚ÄìTuozitou line east of Fengrun ‚Äì the railway embankment slumped due to weak soils. In other cases the embankment held, but transverse compression of the rails caused them to buckle. has pictures. Railway operations were further impaired by the loss of communications (including signalling) and water supply (for the steam locomotives), in both cases due mainly to collapse of buildings and loss of electrical power.. However, the most serious damage, taking the most manpower and longest time to repair, was that involving bridges.. Most difficult was where soft or liquefied soil allowed the bank to slide into the river, shifting the abutments. A more frequent problem was where an approach embankment subsided, typically leaving the rails suspended from the abutment. There were numerous cases where concrete piers and abutments were damaged due to inadequate design and construction; bridges that were strengthened following the Haicheng earthquake survived with only slight damage.. Strengthening is primarily a matter of \\"joining beam ends\\" securely so they do not pull apart, crush together, or slip off of a support. It was observed that at intensity VII and above damage to the roadbed was correlated mainly with loose soil and a high water table. Conversely, bridges and rails in Tangshan City, built on dense soil with a deep water table, were largely undamaged even though subject to intensity XI shaking.. Over forty-two thousand people were mobilized to quickly effect emergency repair of the railways.. The Tongxian- Tuozitou line was opened for traffic on 3 August, single track of the Beijing- Shanhaiguan line opened on 7 August, and both tracks on 10 August, albeit at restricted speeds over temporary bridges and at other places where repairs were not yet complete. Death toll A Tangshan earthquake memorial in Tianjin Estimates of the number of deaths due to the Tangshan earthquake have varied widely, and generally lack a clear authoritative basis. Early reports One of the earliest reports outside of China came on 28 July 1976 from the International Tsunami Information Center, reporting that a \\"violent\\" earthquake, initially estimated at about magnitude 8.1, had struck \\"in the vicinity of Peking\\" (Beijing). Center Director Dr. George Pararas-Carayannis was reported as saying that \\"if the quake hit in a populated area reports of considerable damage could be expected.\\"UPI: as carried by The Daily Texan, 28 July 1976, page 3. News reports the next day located the quake \\"about 100 miles southeast of Peking and 63 miles northeast of Tientsen\\" (Tianjin); i.e., \\"almost precisely in Tangshan\\".UPI: in The Daily Freeman (Kingston), 29 July 1976, p. 32. The Chinese Communist party's Central Committee also broadcast a statement that the quake \\"caused great losses to people's life and property\\". One of the first reports from Tangshan said \\"nearly every building in the city ... was flattened.\\"UPI: in The Berkshire Eagle, 30 July 1976, p. 1. There were several reports of 50 people killed in Beijing, a hundred miles from the epicenter. According to author Stephen Spignesi, a \\"couple of days\\" after the quake Dr. Pararas-Carayannis gave United Press International (UPI) an estimate of to deaths, based on a similar sized earthquake in Shaanxi province in 1556 that caused 830,000 deaths. quotes from a geocities.com webpage of \\"Dr. George\\" that is no longer available. Spignesi quotes Pararas-Carayannis as saying that, in the 1556 earthquake, \\"in some counties the average death toll was 60 percent of the total population\\", and that it was reasonable to expect a similar proportion of deaths at Tangshan since the magnitudes were similar (assuming that the intensity of ground-shaking was also similar), and \\"since construction standards for this rural area had not changed significantly\\" . However, that premise is false: the large death toll in Shaanxi has been attributed to the yaodong style of construction peculiar to that region, where rooms, and entire buildings, are carved out of a thick layer of soft sediments (loess) that blankets the region, leaving walls of weak material similar to adobe to support the roof . Pararas-Carayannis' current web page. says only that \\"it was fairly accurately estimated that there were at least people dead,\\" without mentioning by whom or on what basis this estimate was made. In August the Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan announced that, according to their agents in China, the death toll was over , with about 900,000 injured. They also reported that \\"almost all buildings in Tangshan were leveled\\", and 80 percent of homes and buildings in Tianjin \\"suffered damage to some extent\\".UPI: Pacific Stars and Stripes, 7 August 1976, p. 11. The following January (1977) the Nationalists released a document they said had been presented at an emergency conference on relief work the previous August by the Hopeh Provincial Committee of the party and the Hopeh Revolutionary Committee.UPI: reported in The Redlands (California) Daily Facts, 5 January 1977, p. 5. According to this document: \\"in such seriously stricken areas as Tangshan municipality, and Fengnan and Feng-yun, there were persons dead. Some 79,000 persons were seriously injured, and some 700,000 persons suffered various degrees of injuries.\\" Though these figures have been widely cited, it does not appear there has ever been inquiry into how they were derived, of whether they were an initial estimate (made in the first few days following the quake), or had a more solid basis. In following June it was reported. that the Chinese authorities had briefed seismologist Cinna Lomnitz about Tangshan. It was noted that though no figures were provided, they did not deny any published estimates. Official figures Section 4C of the Tangshan Earthquake Memorial Wall A 1988 book by several members of the Chinese State Seismological Bureau states that people died in the quake,. which reflects the official figure reported by the state-run Xinhua News Agency.. A webpage of the Chinese Earthquake Administration dated 2009. also attributes \\" deaths and 164,851 serious injuries\\" to the Tangshan quake based on an early 1982 study. There are various reports that the \\"official death toll was later given by the Chinese government as \\",E.g.: , footnote. without specifying a source. As of 2017, the Tangshan Earthquake Memorial Wall contained the names of 246,465 victims, who were registered by relatives. Political aspects The remarkably low death toll of the Haicheng earthquake the previous year ‚Äì initially said to be fewer than 300,. much later estimated at a still very modest 2,041. ‚Äì had been credited to measures taken in response to an accurate and timely prediction. This was touted as demonstrating the validity of the Chinese methods of earthquake prediction (including inspiration from \\"Mao Zedong Thought\\", quoting the , state: See also , attributing achievement of rapid progress to \\"the victory of our great proletarian cultural revolution.) and \\"the superiority of our country's socialist system!\\"From a Xinhua News Agency press release published in all major Chinese newspapers 13 March 1975, quoted in . See also , quoted in . With China in the midst of the Cultural Revolution, has a concise description of the Cultural Revolution. \\"belief in earthquake prediction was made an element of ideological orthodoxy that distinguished the true party liners from right wing deviationists\\", and it was everyone's duty to criticize those who doubted the feasibility of earthquake prediction.; . However, the complete lack of warning. and hundred-fold greater death toll at Tangshan stood in stark contrast to Haicheng; it was a palpable failure of earthquake prediction that undermined the claims of superiority made for Chinese methods and the socialist system.. As a backdrop to this, and of deep concern to the Chinese Communist Party,. was a collectively recognized but unvoiced awareness. that in traditional Chinese belief, natural disasters are considered disruptions in the natural order of \\"heaven\\" (Tian) and may signify the loss of legitimacy (the \\"mandate of heaven\\") of the current government.; . This view was underlined by a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in southwestern China just three weeks later. See 1976 Songpan‚ÄìPingwu earthquake. On the other hand, an ongoing mass education campaign before the quake showed that the government was aware and concerned, and the prompt and massive response following the quake demonstrated the government's competence to alleviate suffering and restore normal production, drawing on resources from across the nation.. This was contrasted with the hardships faced by disaster victims (especially the poor) under previous regimes, where assistance was lacking..  Geology  Tectonic elements surrounding the North China Craton on which Tangshan lies. Tangshan lies at the northern edge of the Beijing- Tianjin-Tangshan Plain, an alluvial plain that stretches from Beijing to the Sea of Bohai.. This plain ‚Äì the northeastern corner of the great North China Plain ‚Äì is where sediments eroded from the Yanshan mountains to the north have filled in the ancient Sea of Bohai, with Tangshan near where the shore was about 4,000 years ago., and see figure 4.14. To the south these sediments have formed a layer of weak soils as much as three kilometers thick. At Tangshan and northward these sediments are thinner where the underlying strata crops out to form isolated hills.; . This underlying strata is a thick (typically 10 km) layer of mainly sedimentary strata such as limestone and sandstone, with large deposits of coal.. Tangshan is located particularly over a northeast oriented syncline, a fold in the sedimentary strata that has brought massive deposits of coal close enough to the surface to be mined. In this area the overlying alluvium varies in thickness from several meters to around . Underlying all this is the ancient bedrock of different kinds of metamorphic rock (such as schist, gneiss, quartz, granulite, etc.) that form the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. This craton was formed approximately two billion years agoSome say 1.8 Ga, others 2.5. See and for details. by the collision of two major crustal blocks that left a belt of uplifted mountains ‚Äì the Central (China) Orogenic Belt (COB) ‚Äì that crosses China approximately southwest to northeast, passing just west and north of Beijing.. Just north of Zunhua another orogenic belt, the east‚Äìwest trending Yanshan mountain fault- fold belt (also known as the Yanshan seismic belt) marks the northern edge of the North China Craton (and of the alluvial plain). It is also the location of over half of the destructive earthquakes in Hebei province,. as under the plain several fault zones (oriented parallel to the Central Orogenic Belt) terminate against the Yanshan mountains. Many of these faults are ancient, but have been reactivated by the force transmitted from the collision of the Indian Plate against the Eurasian Plate, making the Eastern Block unusually active seismically, accounting for six of the ten deadliest earthquakes in recorded history.. The Tangshan fault that ruptured 28 July runs right under the center of Tangshan City. One of three faults in the Changdong fault zone, it runs approximately east-northeast (ENE) about 36 km to where it terminates against the north‚Äìsouth trending fault where, just to the south, the secondary M 7.1 quake occurred (\\"B\\" on the map).See figure 16 in , and figure 13 in . The secondary quake occurred on a north oriented section of a fault in a zone that, coming from the southeast, turns north, and then gets complicated. The southern end of the Tangshan fault (it bends slightly at Tangshan) is near Ninghe, which was also the site of a M 6.2 earthquake several hours after the main shock, and an M 6.9 quake (\\"C\\") the following November. The Tangshan fault is considered shallow, but corresponds with a deeper and younger fault with somewhat differing characteristics..  Question of prediction  Whether the Tangshan earthquake was predicted has had considerable political as well as seismological significance. The 1975 Haicheng earthquake (about 400 km [250 miles] northeast of Tangshan) was widely hailed as the first (and, by mainstream seismologists, the only) successful prediction of a major earthquake, demonstrating both that earthquakes could be predicted, and that the Chinese were successfully doing so.; . The surprisingly light death toll ‚Äì initial reports were of \\"very few people killed\\",. but later determined to be a modest 2,041‚Äîfor this magnitude 7.5 quake, attributed to the precautionary measures taken following a definite short-term prediction, was proclaimed as a demonstration of the superiority of China's socialist system,. and incidentally a validation of the Chinese methodologies. However, it was later determined that the most important factor in anticipating the Haicheng earthquake was the extended series of significant foreshocks (\\"powerful messages from nature\\".), and the low casualty rate was due largely to the time of day, hitting in the early evening when most people were neither at work nor asleep.. Tangshan was not so fortunate.. Seventeen months later the 242,419 fatalities of the similarly-sized Tangshan earthquake was therefore a considerable shock politically as well as seismically. While some of this greater mortality might be attributed to the exposure of a larger population, or the time of day (Haicheng was struck in the early evening, Tangshan while most people were asleep), the principal factor appeared to be the failure to take any precautionary measures: Tangshan was entirely unprepared.. At the time, the Chinese methods of earthquake prediction mainly consisted of watching for various precursors, including foreshocks,. and were celebrated for their success at Haicheng and elsewhere. mention \\"the Lungling and Yenyuen earthquakes, both accurately predicted\\". See also (p. 6) and regarding the Sungpan‚ÄîPingwu (or Songpan) earthquake. Many seismologists consider the Tangshan earthquakes to have not been predicted,; ; . even \\"famously unpredicted\\",. and that it was not predictable due to a lack of precursory anomalous phenomena. Furthermore, an investigation 30 years later found that there was no official short-term prediction of an imminent earthquake at Haicheng, and that, though there were many unofficial predictions of an imminent quake, none of those had a scientific basis.. The warnings that were made and precautions taken happened largely at the local level, based on general middle-term predictions, enhanced public awareness due to an educational campaign,See also . and a series of foreshocks. It is significant that at Tangshan there were no perceptible foreshocks.. On the other hand, it is reported. that several people at the State Seismological Bureau (SSB) wanted to warn of an impending earthquake somewhere in the region between Beijing and the Bohai Sea, and that this was discussed at several meetings. One of these was a week-long national conference on earthquake predictions and preparation that convened in Tangshan on 14 July (two weeks before the earthquake) where Wang Chengmin is said to have warned there could be a magnitude 5+ earthquake in the Tangshan‚ÄîLuanxian area between 22 July and 5 August.. However, in addition to the distractions of the Cultural Revolution, there was a possible disagreement within the SSB on whether the next large earthquake would be in eastern China (i.e., Beijing area) or western China, and that in May it had been concluded that no major earthquakes would occur in the Beijing‚ÄìTangshan area.. As it turned out, western China was hit by the magnitude 7.2 Songpan-Pingwu earthquake only three weeks after Tangshan,. showing that those arguing for the imminence of an earthquake in Western China were not entirely wrong. At another meeting, on 26 July, there was a purported suggestion to not issue any warning, to avoid alarming the population.. The next morning, at an emergency meeting he requested with the Bureau's leadership, Wang was reportedly told by Deputy Chief Cha Zhiyuan that \\"We are currently very busy. We will discuss it again next week.\\". However, Cha has disputed this, claiming that Wang said there would be no major earthquakes. Another account says Wang was directed to submit more information, then send a small group to observe the earthquake. The dilemma: an \\"abundance of caution\\" leads to many false alarms. Some of the bureaucratic reticence to issue warnings and order precautionary measures likely resulted from too many predictions. These were often based on doubtful theories notorious for false alarms. that earthquakes can be predicted on the basis of droughts,. daily temperatures,. variations in geomagnetism, or isolated anomalous phenomena. They were often too broad (magnitude \\"of at least 4.0 in the area of Beijing, Tianjin, Huailai, Tangshan, Bohai, and Zhangjiakou\\", \\"in a few years\\".) to warrant large-scale societal and economic disruption. Such disruptions could be serious: a false alarm in October, 1976, issued by the Shaanxi provincial government, is estimated to have disrupted the lives of 65% of the population of that province for half a year.. It has also been estimated that \\"in the fall of 1976 about 400 million of the then total population of 930 million of China spent some nights in temporary earthquake shelters.\\", citing a Chinese source. This illustrates the classic dilemma of earthquake prediction: increasing the sensitivity to the possibility of an earthquake (i.e., reducing the failure to predict) increases the number false alarms, which often has a significant cost.. Comparison Comparison of the Tangshan death toll ‚Äì officially 242,419. The initial estimates of 600,000 to 750,000 deaths were based on a faulty comparison with the Shaanxi earthquake. .‚Äîwith other earthquake disasters is problematical because of uncertainty in the statistics. For example, the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake (estimated magnitude of ~8) is generally said to have been the deadliest earthquake disaster in history, with 830,000 deaths, based on Chinese historical records.. However, a Chinese language source. argues for only 530,000 deaths from the earthquake itself, with the larger number being the total reduction of population due to deaths from all causes (including exposure, disease, and famine) as well as people leaving the region due to economic collapse. Another Chinese source. states (without citing any sources) that the 1556 earthquake killed only about 100,000 directly, with another 700,000 dying of disease. Depending on what basis is used, the Tangshan disaster can thus be considered as approximately one-third, one-half, or twice as deadly as the Shaanxi disaster. The other five deadliest earthquake disasters known in history,See U.S. Geological Survey, Significant Earthquakes. with magnitudes ranging from 7.0 to 9.1, have had death tolls just under that of Tangshan's: * 1138 Aleppo earthquake (Syria) magnitude unknown, ~230,000 deaths. * 2004 Sumatra earthquake (Indonesia) M 9.1, 227,898 deaths, mostly due to tsunamis. * 2010 Haiti earthquake M 7.0, 100,000‚Äì316,000 deaths.

Other notably deadly earthquakes in the past century include: * 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake (Japan) M 7.9, 142,800 deaths, mostly due to fire. * 1948 Ashgabat earthquake (Turkmenistan) M 7.3, 110,000 deaths. Although unprepared, compared to other earthquake disasters Tangshan did not experience significant common secondary disasters arising from fire, tsunami, landsliding, or flooding due to blocking of rivers or breaching of dikes. A dam holding back a large reservoir just above Tangshan was seriously damaged but did not fail;. similarly for another dam that imperiled Tianjin and some outlying districts of Beijing.. The immediate and massive response by the government resulted in the rescue of thousands of people in the first two days (after which mortality increases rapidly),. while prompt attention to the problems of clean water, food, and public health avoided the mortality due to epidemic disease and starvation that often follows such disasters.; . Cultural references Chinese director Feng Xiaogang's 2010 drama film Aftershock gives an account of the earthquake and its effects. Footage of the incident appeared in the film Days of Fury (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price.

It runs through the Central Coast, Hunter and New England regions. The line was the original main line between Sydney and Brisbane, however this required a change of gauge at Wallangarra. As of 1988, the line closed progressively north of Armidale with services gradually withdrawn till 2004, with the main route between Sydney and Brisbane now the North Coast line. Description of route The line starts as a branch off the Main Suburban line at Strathfield in Sydney. The line heads north as a quadruple track electrified line to Rhodes, crossing the John Whitton Bridge over the Parramatta River as a double track line. At West Ryde the line again expands out to four tracks through to Epping. The line is then largely double track through the northern suburbs of Sydney, crossing the Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge, before passing through the Central Coast. At Fassifern, a former branch line to Toronto divided off in an eastwards direction until closed in 1990. The line continues north to Broadmeadow in the inner western suburbs of Newcastle. North of Broadmeadow is the junction with the Newcastle branch line, where electrification of the main line ends. However, electrification continues along the branch line to Newcastle Interchange terminus at Wickham, with the branch line beyond Wickham to the former Newcastle station having been closed and lifted from December 2014. Pacific National 92 class locomotives hauling a coal train over the Hunter River at Singleton Wallangarra station The line then swings westwards as four tracks; two main line and two coal roads traverse the outer suburbs of Newcastle to Maitland. The two coal roads run to the Newcastle coal lines, which serve a number of collieries along the route. Maitland is the junction of the North Coast line which continues to Brisbane and the Main North line. The line becomes double track immediately west of Maitland and heads through the Upper Hunter Valley townships of Branxton, Singleton and Muswellbrook where the double track ends. Muswellbrook is the junction point for the former cross country line to Sandy Hollow and Gulgong. The Main North continues northwards through the Ardglen Tunnel to Werris Creek, where the Mungindi Line branches off to Moree, and a former cross country branch continues to Binnaway and ultimately Dubbo. Sunnyside rail bridge over Tenterfield Creek has fallen into disrepair, 2015 The line continues north, but sees limited traffic beyond Werris Creek. The line reaches the major New England towns of Tamworth and Armidale, the latter being the northernmost extent of service on the line. Until the mid-2000s freight traffic continued to the disused station at Dumaresq which is home to a now-also-disused agricultural fertilizer depot. There is now wire across the corridor at several points between Armidale and Dumaresq, after which the line is closed. A block is placed across the tracks a short distance from Dumaresq, at the 590 kilometre mark. North of Glen Innes the line, and particularly its bridges, have fallen into disrepair. In December 1991 the line was severed when the Roads & Traffic Authority built a deviation of the New England Highway over the line at Bluff Rock south of Tenterfield.\\"Line cut at Bluff Rock\\" Railway Digest March 1992 page 90 At Wallangarra, the line met Queensland Railways' Southern railway line. History Abandoned section of the Main North line north of Armidale with a post marking the distance from Sydney Central station Wallangarra rail ticket 1989 The Main North line, formerly known as the Great Northern Railway (GNR), was the original mainline between Sydney and Brisbane. The first section of the Main North line was built in 1857 from the port of Newcastle to East Maitland as the Hunter River Railway Company's line.Centenary of the Newcastle-Maitland Railway Wylie, RF Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, March 1957 pp33-45 \\"The Great Northern Railway Newcastle to Maitland 150 Years On\\", Walters, Chris Australian Railway History March 2007 pp83-113 The line was then extended to Victoria Street, Maitland in 1858. It was extended to Singleton in 1863, Muswellbrook in 1869, Scone in 1871 and Murrurundi in 1872. The GNR was then extended beyond Scone to Werris Creek and West Tamworth in 1878, Armidale in 1883, and reached the Queensland border at Wallangarra in 1888. The North Coast line to Brisbane, via the North Coast was opened in stages between 1905 and 1930, but a ferry carried trains across the Clarence River until the Grafton Bridge was completed in 1932. The Newcastle rail network remained independent of the main network radiating from Sydney until 1889, when the line between Sydney and Newcastle was completed with the opening of the Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge. Thus Newcastle was connected by rail with Wallangarra before it was connected with Sydney, such was the difficulty and expense of reaching and bridging the Hawkesbury River. The Sydney to Newcastle section, Homebush to Waratah, had difficult topography to overcome, including crossing the Hawkesbury River, traversing the Mullet Creek bank and constructing the Woy Woy Tunnel. From the south, the line was opened between Homebush and Hornsby in 1886, then extended to Hawkesbury River in 1887. From the north, the line opened between Waratah and Gosford in 1887. Progress in the construction of the last section between Hawkesbury River and Gosford occurred when the Woy Woy Tunnel opened in 1887, then Mullet Creek to Gosford in 1888 and finally Hawkesbury River to Mullet Creek in 1889 when the original Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge was built.Opening of the Hawkesbury Bridge, The Sydney Morning Herald, Thursday 2 May 1889, p.7 (accessed 30 June 2011) In 1892, the line was duplicated from Strathfield to Hornsby, and electrified in 1926 as part of the Bradfield electrification scheme.

A daily North Western train operates from Sydney to Werris Creek before dividing, one operating along the Main North line to Armidale, the other section operating along the North-West line to Moree. Central Coast & Newcastle Line intercity passenger services operate between Sydney and Newcastle. The Hunter Line operates between Newcastle, Maitland and Scone, with a branch to Dungog on the North Coast line. Sydney Trains operates suburban passenger services in the section between Strathfield and Berowra. The section between Strathfield and Maitland forms part of the interstate line between Sydney and Brisbane and sees intermodal freight traffic carried between the two cities. The section of line in the Hunter Valley sees intensive coal train working, with the section between Broadmeadow and Maitland one of the busiest freight lines in Australia. Developments Cowan station The line was hampered by the rugged terrain and a change of gauge at Wallangarra for traffic to Queensland. The line was superseded as the principal route to Brisbane by the completion of the North Coast Line in 1930. Despite being bypassed, the line remained busy for many years afterwards, with the line instead becoming the major freight link to the wheat and wool regions of northern and north-west New South Wales. In 1988, the newly elected Greiner State Government commissioned a report into the State Rail Authority by Booz Allen Hamilton. As a result, the line between Tenterfield and Wallangarra was closed. The last train to operate north of Tenterfield was an Australian Railway Historical Society charter on 15 January 1988 hauled by diesel locomotive 4487.\\"To the Border or Bust\\" Railway Digest March 1988 page 99 The last train to operate north of Glen Innes was hauled by steam locomotive 3001 on 22 October 1989 after which the line was formally suspended from operations.\\"Gone: \\"Irish Lyn\\" and Trains ‚Äì But at Least the Lizards are Safe\\" Railway Digest December 1989 page 399\\"Glen Innes\\" Railway Digest December 1989 page 412 Following the Northern Tablelands Express being truncated in February 1990, the line north of Tamworth saw little use until the Xplorer service was introduced to Armidale in October 1993. The line to Glen Innes was still open in July 1992 when diesel locomotive 4499 operated a crew training service.Railway Digest October 1992 page 404 There have been attempts to revive freight or tourist traffic to as far as Glen Innes, although these plans have not yet succeeded. A section of the line between Waratah and Maitland is quadruple track, with one pair being used exclusively for coal trains within the Hunter Valley coal trains and the other pair being used by passenger trains and general freight. The coal tracks from Port Waratah join the line on the eastern side of the other tracks at Scholey Street Junction and pass underneath the other tracks at Hanbury Dive just west of Maud Street, continuing to Maitland on the western side of the other tracks. In November 1989 a fourth track was added between Eastwood and West Ryde.\\"Eastwood ‚Äì West Ryde Up Suburban line opens\\" Railway Digest January 1990 page 9 In the mid-1990s a loop was constructed at Cowan. The Sandgate Flyover was constructed in 2006 to allow the two passenger/freight tracks to rise and pass over the coal tracks that branch off to Kooragang Island in order to eliminate a capacity restriction caused by the long coal trains crossing the other tracks at grade. Because of the location of the overpass relative to the branch to Kooragang Island, a short section of the line has 6 parallel tracks. The bridge carrying Sandgate Road over the lines had to modified to allow for the additional lines. Sandgate station is flanked by a pair of coal tracks on each side.

The AZ series uses an aluminium engine block with cast iron cylinder liners and aluminium DOHC cylinder heads. The engine series features many advanced technologies including slant-squish combustion chambers, offset cylinder and crank centers, and the VVT-i continuously variable intake valve timing system. The aluminium engine measures long, wide, and tall. The cylinder block is an open-deck, midi-skirt die-cast aluminium type with cast-in iron liners and a die-cast aluminium lower crankcase and a stamped oil pan. The forged steel crankshaft is fully balanced with eight counterweights and supported by five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the lower crankcase. The dual overhead camshafts are driven by a single-stage roller chain of pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5¬∞. The camshafts act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance adjusting shim is employed. Valve diameters are for intake and for exhaust, with lift for both intake and exhaust. The four- vane VVT-i device is fitted on the intake camshaft, altering timing by 50¬∞. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight. Fuel is injected sequentially via an ultra-fine-atomization injector with twelve small injection holes, each in diameter. As in the smaller NZ engine, the new AZ adopts a plastic, built-up, and vibration-welded intake manifold integrating a large volume plenum chamber ( volume including a resonator). Exhaust manifolds are of tubular construction with integrated catalytic converters. The AZ is the replacement for the S engine. Its successor is the AR engine.

The MZ series has an aluminium engine block and aluminium alloy DOHC cylinder heads. The cylinders are lined with cast iron, and is of a closed deck design (no open space between the bores). The engine is a 60 degree V6 design. It uses multi-port fuel injection (MFI), four valves per cylinder, a one-piece cast camshaft and a cast aluminium intake manifold. The MZ family is a lightweight V6 engine of an all-aluminium design, using lighter weight parts than the heavier duty VZ block engines in an effort to lower production costs, decrease engine weight, and decrease reciprocating weight without sacrificing reliability. Toyota sought to enhance the drivability pattern of the engine (over the 3VZ) at exactly 3000 rpm, since that was the typical engine speed for motors cruising on the highway. The result was less cylinder distortion coupled with the decreased weight of rotating assemblies, smoother operation at that engine speed, and increased engine efficiency. This engine has been phased out in most markets, replaced by variants of the new GR series. 1MZ-FE Toyota 1MZ-FE engine The 1MZ-FE is a dual overhead cam (DOHC) V6 engine. Bore and stroke is . Output is at 5200‚Äì5400 rpm with of torque at 4400 rpm. Horsepower ratings dropped after the Society of Automotive Engineers implemented a new power measurement system for vehicle engines, Toyota engines rated on 87 octane dropped the most, compared to the same engines used by Lexus rated on 91 octane. It has bucket tappets and was designed for good fuel economy without an overall performance trade-off. These engines are prone to oil gelling. Another name for the issue was \\"engine sludge\\". There was a class action lawsuit due to this problem.https://web.archive.org/web/20070118062627/http://oilgelsettlement.com/summary_notice.pdf It is very important to the life of these engines that oil changes are done on a regular basis.

The 3MZ uses a new flat- type knock sensor, which is a departure from the typical resonator type knock sensor used on the previous MZs. Previous MZs had poor knock control, or perhaps oversensitivity when detecting knock, and power loss up to may be realized due to erratic ignition timing when using an octane lower than 91. The new flat-type knock sensor is a completely different design and detects more frequencies than the traditional resonator type. This provides the ECU with more accurate data. A bolt goes through the center of the knock sensor, which then mates the sensor to the block on each bank.

Nevertheless, some anarchists have provided religious interpretations and approaches to anarchism, including the idea that glorification of the state is a form of sinful idolatry.Christoyannopoulos, Alexandre (March 2010). \\"A Christian Anarchist Critique of Violence: From Turning the Other Cheek to a Rejection of the State\\". Political Studies Association.Christoyannopoulos, Alexandre (2010). Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel.

William Godwin, \\"the author of the Enquiry Concerning Political Justice (1793), the first systematic text of libertarian politics, was a Calvinist minister who began by rejecting Christianity, and passed through deism to atheism and then what was later called agnosticism.\\" The pioneering German individualist anarchist Max Stirner, \\"began as a left-Hegelian, post- Feuerbachian atheist, rejecting the ‚Äòspirit‚Äô (Geist) of religion as well as of politics including the spook of ‚Äòhumanity‚Äô\\". Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, \\"the first person to call himself an anarchist, who was well known for saying, ‚ÄòProperty is theft‚Äô, also said, ‚ÄòGod is evil‚Äô and ‚ÄòGod is the eternal X‚Äô\\". Published posthumously in French in 1882, Mikhail Bakunin's God and the State was one of the first anarchist treatises on religion. Bakunin had become an atheist whilst in Italy in the 1860s. For a brief period he was involved with freemasonry, which had influenced him in this. When he established the International Revolutionary Association he did so with former supporters of Mazzini, who broke with him over his deism. It was in this period that Bakunin wrote: \\"God exists, therefore man is a slave. Man is free, therefore there is no God. Escape this dilemma who can!\\" which appeared in his unpublished Catechism of a freemasonMikhail, Bakunin E. H. Carr Bakunin expounds his philosophy of religion's place in history and its relationship to the modern political state. It was later published in English by Mother Earth Publications in 1916. Anarcho-communism's main theorist Peter Kropotkin, \\"was a child of the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution, and assumed that religion would be replaced by science and that the Church as well as the State would be abolished; he was particularly concerned with the development of a secular system of ethics which replaced supernatural theology with natural biology\\". Errico Malatesta and Carlo Cafiero, \\"the main founders of the Italian anarchist movement, both came from freethinking families (and Cafiero was involved with the National Secular Society when he visited London during the 1870s)\\". In the French anarchist movement Elise√© Reclus was a son of a Calvinist minister, and began by rejecting religion before moving on to anarchism. Sebastien Faure, \\"the most active speaker and writer in the French movement for half a century\\" wrote an essay titled Twelve Proofs of God's Inexistence. German insurrectionary anarchist Johann Most wrote an article called \\"The God Pestilence\\". In the United States, \\"freethought was a basically anti-christian, anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to Liberty were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of Freethought and, for a time, The Truth Seeker. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal Lucifer, the Light-Bearer\\". \\"Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as Lucifer, the Light-Bearer, Freethought and The Truth Seeker appeared in Liberty...The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself\\". Late 19th century/early 20th Century anarchists such as Voltairine de Cleyre were often associated with the freethinkers movement, advocating atheism. In Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles. \\"Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, in another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church...Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist Andr√© Lorulot, will have its impacts in Estudios (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics.\\". This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine √âtica and Iniciales \\"there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin¬¥s theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul.\\". Spanish anarchists in the early 20th century were responsible for burning several churches, though many of the church burnings were actually carried out by members of the Radical Party while anarchists were blamed. The implicit and/or explicit support by church leaders for the National Faction during the Spanish Civil War greatly contributed to anti-religious sentiment. In Anarchism: What It Really Stands For, Emma Goldman wrote: Chinese anarchists led the opposition to Christianity in the early 20th century, but the most prominent of them, Li Shizeng, made it clear that he opposed not only Christianity but all religion as such. When he became president of the Anti-Christian Movement of 1922 he told the Beijing Atheists' League: \\"Religion is intrinsically old and corrupt: history has passed it by\\" and asked \\"Why are we of the twentieth century... even debating this nonsense from primitive ages?\\"  Religious anarchism and anarchist themes in religions  Religious anarchists view organised religion mostly as authoritarian and hierarchical that has strayed from its humble origins as Peter Marshall explains:  Buddhism  Many Westerners who call themselves Buddhists regard the Buddhist tradition, in contrast to most other world faiths, as nontheistic, humanistic and experientially-based. Most Buddhist schools, they point out, see the Buddha as the embodied proof that transcendence and ultimate happiness is possible for all, without exception. The Indian revolutionary and self-declared atheist Har Dayal, much influenced by Marx and Bakunin, who sought to expel British rule from the subcontinent, was a striking instance of someone who in the early 20th century tried to synthesize anarchist and Buddhist ideas. Having moved to the United States, in 1912 he went so far as to establish in Oakland the Bakunin Institute of California, which he described as \\"the first monastery of anarchism\\".Anarchist Portraits by Paul Avrich, Princeton University Press, 1988, p30Ghadar Movement: Ideology, Organisation and Strategy by Karish K. Puri, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, 1983  Christianity  The Masses, 1917 political cartoon by socialist cartoonist Art Young According to some, Christianity began primarily as a pacifist and anarchist movement. Jesus is said, in this view, to have come to empower individuals and free people from an oppressive religious standard in the Mosaic law; he taught that the only rightful authority was God, not Man, evolving the law into the Golden Rule (see also liberal Christianity). According to Christian anarchists, there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable, the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. Christian anarchists believe that freedom from government or Church is justified spiritually and will only be guided by the grace of God if Man shows compassion to others and turns the other cheek when confronted with violence. As per Christian communism, anarchism is not necessarily opposed by the Catholic Church. Indeed, Distributism in Catholic social teaching such as Pope Leo XIII's encyclical Rerum novarum and Pope Pius XI's Quadragesimo anno Allitt, Patrick (2000). Catholic Converts: British and American Intellectuals Turn to Rome. Cornell University Press. p. 206. resembles a Mutualist society based on Cooperatives, while Pope John Paul II's Catechism of the Catholic Church states \\"She (the Church) has...refused to accept, in the practice of \\"capitalism,\\" individualism and the absolute primacy of the law of the marketplace over human labor. Regulating the economy solely by centralized planning perverts the basis of social bonds; regulating it solely by the law of the marketplace fails social justice\\". Notable Catholic anarchists include Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin who founded the Catholic Worker Movement. The Quaker church, or the Religious Society of Friends, is organized along anarchist lines. All decisions are made locally in a community of equals where every members voice has equal weight. While there are no formal linkages between Quakerism and anarchism and Quakers as a whole hold a wide variety of political opinions, the long tradition of Quaker involvement in social-justice work and similar outlooks on how power should be structured and decisions should be reached has led to significant crossover in membership and influence between Christian anarchists and Quakers. The Quaker influence was particularly pronounced in the anti-nuclear movement of the 1980s and in the North American anti-globalization movement, both of which included many thousands of anarchists and self-consciously adopted secular, consensus-based aspects of Quaker decision making.  Gnosticism  Gnosis, as originated by Jesus, is direct revelation of moral and ethical perfection received by each individual from God. This ‚Äògnosis‚Äô is necessary for self governance; self governance is the foundation of anarchist society. Jesus embodied and taught that affirmed alignment with God allows for individual gnosis which naturally co-creates collective harmony, eliminating external governing structures. The discovery of the ancient gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi coupled with the writings of the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, especially with regard to his concept of the Black Iron Prison, has led to the development of anarcho-gnosticism.The Radical Tradition: Philosophy, Metapolitics & the Conservative Revolution, edited by Troy Southgate, Primordial Traditions, 2011, pages 123-125 http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Publications/TheRadicalTradition.aspx Some ancient forms of Gnosticism had many things in common with modern ideas of anarchism: their members lived on communes with little to no private property and they practiced ceremonies led by people chosen each time by lots rather than hierarchical authority. Gnostic groups also practiced equity among the sexes and some members were vegetarians. Central to all gnostic philosophy was an individual attainment of affirmed alignment with God as taught by Jesus to the first gnostic sects, a personal experience rather than one based on dogma. They often had decentralized church structure and, given that early gnostics believed all people are precious children of God, they placed a strong emphasis on equality. Some modern gnostics view themselves in opposition to spiritual entities called \\"archons,\\" a word which means \\"ruler\\"; the word \\"anarchy\\" is derived, and so in many ways the goal of gnosticism is a form of Christian anarchy. Other modern gnostics believe they are ruled by the Demiurge ‚Äî an Archon overlord.  Islam  The Bedouin nomads of the Khawarij were Islam's first sect. They challenged the new centralization of power in the Islamic state as an impediment to their tribe's freedom. At least one sect of Khawarij, the Najdat, believed that if no suitable imam was present in the community, then the position could be dispensed with. A strand of Mu øtazili thought paralleled that of the Najdat: if rulers inevitably became tyrants, then the only acceptable course of action was to depose them. The Nukkari subsect of Ibadi Islam reportedly adopted a similar belief.  Judaism  While many Jewish anarchists were irreligious or sometimes vehemently anti-religious, there were also a few religious anarchists and pro- anarchist thinkers, who combined contemporary radical ideas with traditional Judaism. Some secular anarchists, such as Abba Gordin and Erich Fromm, also noticed remarkable similarity between anarchism and many Kabbalistic ideas, especially in their Hasidic interpretation. Some Jewish mystical groups were based on anti-authoritarian principles, somewhat similar to the Christian Quakers and Dukhobors. Martin Buber, a deeply religious philosopher, had frequently referred to the Hasidic tradition. The Orthodox Kabbalist rabbi Yehuda Ashlag believed in a religious version of libertarian communism, based on principles of Kabbalah, which he called \\"altruist communism\\". Ashlag supported the Kibbutz movement and preached to establish a network of self- ruled internationalist communes, who would eventually annul the brute-force regime completely, for \\"every man did that which was right in his own eyes.\\", because there is nothing more humiliating and degrading for a person than being under the brute-force government. A British Orthodox rabbi, Yankev-Meyer Zalkind, was an anarcho-communist and very active anti-militarist. Rabbi Zalkind was a close friend of Rudolf Rocker, a prolific Yiddish writer and a prominent Torah scholar. He argued, that the ethics of the Talmud, if properly understood, is closely related to anarchism. One contemporary movement in Judaism with anarchist tendencies is Jewish Renewal. The movement is trans- denominational, including Orthodox, non-Orthodox, Judeo-Buddhists and Judeo- Pagans, and focusing on feminism, environmentalism and pacifism.  Contemporary Paganism  Neopaganism, with its focus on the sanctity of nature and equality, along with its often decentralized nature, has led to a number of Neopagan inspired anarchists. One of the most prominent is Starhawk, who writes extensively about both Neopaganism and activism. Gods & Radicals Press is a not-for-profit anti-capitalist Pagan publisher. Since 2015, it has been publishing writing on the intersection of anarchist, Marxist, anti- colonialist, druidic, feminist, occult, environmentalist, and esoteric thought. The Gods & Radicals Press website declares, \\"We know the power of mead and molotov, the beauty of ancient forest and shattered window, the sacred celebration of spiral dance and protest march.\\" In addition to paper and e-books, the Press maintains an online journal.  Taoism  Many early Taoists such as the influential Laozi and Zhuangzi were critical of authority and advised rulers that the less controlling they were, the more stable and effective their rule would be. There is debate among contemporary anarchists about whether or not this counts as an anarchist view. It is known, however, that some less influential Taoists such as Pao Ching-yen explicitly advocated anarchy. 20th and 21st century anarchists such as Liu Shifu and Ursula K. le Guin have also identified as Taoists.  Dysnomianism  One religion known as Dysnomianism seeks to fuse anarchism with religion and occult practices as its primary text The Chronicles of Anarchy (released on The Pirate Bay) presents a broad overview of the connections between anarchism and various traditional spiritual philosophies from around the world, especially those with a magickal and occult leaning. This book attempts to blend all the most anarchist aspects of world spirituality into one coherent practical anarchist spirituality which sees Dysnomia, the Greek goddess of lawlessness as its central deity. An abridged form of the Chronicles can also be found and is known as \\"Liber Anarkhos\\" which assumes some knowledge of anarchism and magick on the part of the reader, but provides some of the most relevant rituals for practical use. Often utilizing psychedelic drugs and anarchist tactics of direct action, those who follow this path are known as Dysnomians. As explained in the Chronicles, by utilizing the principles of neuroplasticity Dysnomians seek to free their brains/minds of all hierarchical and legalistic conditioning to arrive at a state known as anarkhos.

The family introduced many changes for Toyota, including various EFI, ECU, and engine improvements from generation to generation. The VZ was Toyota's response to the Nissan VG engine. The low angle DOHC cylinder heads excel in low-mid torque and power, making the VZ well-suited for various uses in cars, trucks, and SUVs. The blocks are all strongly made using cast iron with large interconnected main bearing cradles and two bolt main bearing caps. Forged steel crankshafts, and cast iron main bearing support girdles became standard with the 3VZ-FE. Piston and ring construction are typical parts, with rods varying between large and very large for stock V6 production engines. 1VZ- FE The 1VZ-FE is a version. Bore and stroke is . Output is at 6000 rpm and at 4600 rpm. Applications: Japan * 1988-1991 Toyota Camry Prominent * 1988-1991 Toyota Vista 2VZ-FE The 2VZ-FE is a version.

At introduction output was specified as then later bumped to at 4800 rpm with of torque at 3400 rpm. Despite sharing an engine family designation the 3VZ-E and 3VZ-FE have few parts in common. Applications: * 1988-1995 Toyota 4Runner * 1988-1995 Toyota Pickup * 1992-1994 Toyota T100 3VZ-FE The basic design is a revised 3VZ-E iron-block engine, mated with aluminum DOHC 24 valve heads. It has a forged steel crankshaft and cast connecting rods. The upper intake plenum is of the split-chamber design with Toyota's ACIS variable-intake system feeding three sets of runners for both heads. Because the VZ was originally for pickup truck and SUV use, the 3VZ-FE happens to be a physically tall motor. To make the engine fit in FWD engine bays, Toyota tilted the motor towards the firewall. This \\"tilt\\" is so severe (~15 degrees) that reaching the rear bank of cylinders is nearly impossible without first removing the intake plenum. Parts-wise, the 3VZ-FE shares very little with the rest of the VZ engine family. The main bearings are shared with the 3VZ-E, but little else. Cams can also be interchanged between the 5VZ-FE and 3VZ-FE heads. The 3VZ-FE was used on the Camry platform from 1992 to May 1997 depending on the market: North America saw the engine only in 1992 and 1993, while Australia and New Zealand had it from 1992 to 1996. The engine was available in some parts of Asia in the Toyota Windom until May 1997. Following 1994, the 1MZ-FE engines replaced the 3VZ-FE in most applications. However the 3VZ-FE continued to be used in Australia until 1996, especially in the Camry. The power spread of the 3VZ-FE is wide, having close to maximum torque between 2500‚Äì4600 rpm, with power trailing off by 6000 rpm. The stock redline is 6600 rpm, and the ECU's fuel/ignition cut-off is 7200 rpm. The 1992‚Äì1993 engine is rated at at 5800 rpm and at 4600 rpm. Compression ratio is 9.6:1. The 3VZ-FE is fairly common in most parts of the world, having a long lifespan in popular models. Applications: * 1993-1996 Toyota Scepter, Japan * 1992-1993 Toyota Camry, USA * 1992-1996 Toyota Camry, Australia, Europe * 1992-1996 Toyota Windom * 1992-1993 Lexus ES300, USA * 1993 Toyota Hilux 4VZ-FE The 4VZ-FE is a version. Bore is and stroke is slightly shorter than that of the 2VZ-FE at . Output is at 6000 rpm. Compression ratio of this engine was raised from 9.0:1 to 9.6:1. In production from 1992 until 1996, it was built to replace the 2VZ-FE as Toyota's V6. Engine was only sold with Japanese market vehicles. Applications: Japan * 1992-1996 Toyota Camry Prominent * 1993-1996 Toyota Windom VCV11 5VZ-FE 5VZ-FE Engine The 5VZ-FE is a engine which replaced the 3VZ-E.

It has a cast iron engine block, and aluminum DOHC cylinder heads. The 5VZ-FE uses sequential multi-port fuel injection, has four valves per cylinder with shim-over-bucket tappets and features large cast connecting rods, one- piece cast camshafts, a cast crank (unlike the 3VZ-FE, which was forged) and a cast aluminum intake manifold. This engine also features an oil cooler integrated in the radiator and a wasted spark ignition system with three coils. Camshafts are belt-driven. The 5VZ-FE is a non-interference engine.

Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), was a U.S. Supreme Court case involving discrimination against the intellectually disabled. In 1980, Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (CLC) submitted a permit application seeking approval to build a group home for the intellectually disabled. The city of Cleburne, Texas refused to grant CLC a permit on the basis of a municipal zoning ordinance. CLC then sued the City of Cleburne on the theory that the denial of the permit violated the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection rights of CLC and their potential residents. Applying rational basis review, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the ordinance as applied to CLC. The Court declined to rule that the intellectually disabled were a quasi-suspect or suspect class.  Background  In July 1980, Jan Hannah purchased a building at 201 Featherston Street in the city of Cleburne with the intent of leasing it to CLC so that they could operate it as a group home for the intellectually disabled. The home was intended to house a total of thirteen mentally disabled men and women. CLC staff would supervise the residents at all times. The house itself had four bedrooms and two baths, with another half bath to be added. The city of Cleburne informed CLC that a special use permit would be required for a group home such as this, and so CLC submitted the permit application. The city's zoning regulations required that a special use permit, renewable annually, was required for the construction of \\"[hospitals] for the insane or feeble-minded, or alcoholics or drug addicts, or penal or correctional institutions\\" (436). The city had classified the group home as a \\"hospital for the feebly minded\\" (437). The Planning and Zoning Commission denied the request, and CLC's Hannah, Bobbie Northrop, and David Southern moved their request to the City Council.https://www.ancorfoundation.org/sites/default/files/pdf/200509links.pdf The city of Cleburne held a public hearing on the meeting, after which they denied the special use permit to CLC on a vote of 3 to 1.  Case history  After their special use permit was denied CLC filed suit in Federal District Court against the city, alleging that the zoning ordinance was invalid on its face and as applied because it discriminated against the intellectually disabled in violation of the equal protection rights of CLC and its potential residents. The Federal District Court found that if the potential residents of CLC's group home had not been intellectually disabled the permit would have been granted. However, they upheld the city's ordinance and actions as constitutional. The District Court held that the intellectually disabled were neither a suspect nor a quasi-suspect class and therefore the rational basis test should be applied. The court held that the ordinance was rationally related to the city's legitimate interest in \\"the legal responsibility of CLC and its residents, . . . the safety and fears of residents in the adjoining neighborhood,\\" and the number of people to be housed in the home. The Federal Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court. The Court of Appeals held that an intellectual disability was a quasi- suspect class and therefore intermediate scrutiny should be applied to the ordinance. Applying the heightened scrutiny standard to the ordinance, the court held it was unconstitutional on its face and as applied. The city appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.  Supreme Court opinion  Justice White's majority opinion invalidated the ordinance as applied to CLC, holding that the denial of the permit was based on irrational prejudice against the intellectually disabled and hence was invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unlike most cases where the Court uses rational basis review, the Court did not accept the City's claimed interest. Some commentators have referred to this investigation into the actual reasons for passing the law as \\"rational basis with bite\\".See Pettinga, Gayle Lynn (1987). \\"Rational Basis with Bite: Intermediate Scrutiny by Any Other Name\\". Indiana Law Journal 62: 779. ISSN 0019-6665.; Wadhwani, Neelum J. (2006). \\"Rational Reviews, Irrational Results\\". Texas Law Review 84: 801, 809‚Äì811. ISSN 0040-4411. The Court declined to grant the intellectually disabled status as a suspect or quasi- suspect class because they are a \\"large and diversified group\\" amply protected by state and federal legislatures. Therefore, any legislation that distinguishes between the intellectually disabled and others must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest in order to withstand equal protection review. This is also known as rational basis review and is the lowest level of review under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Marshall, dissenting in part and concurring in the result of invalidating the statute, argued that due to the history of discrimination against the intellectually disabled, the Court should employ a higher standard of scrutiny (see Equal Protection scrutiny) when examining laws that regulated those with mental disabilities.  Significance  Although the Supreme Court declined to classify those with mental disabilities as a suspect or quasi- suspect class, the decision is one of the few instances in which the Supreme Court has held government legislation to be unconstitutional when it applied a rational basis level of review.

The broadest definition of the Nature Coast includes the eight counties that abut the Gulf of Mexico along the Big Bend Coast defined by geologists: from west to east, Wakulla, Jefferson, Taylor, Dixie, Levy, Citrus, Hernando, and Pasco counties. (Note that the Big Bend Coast differs from the Big Bend region of Florida.) Many businesses and organizations incorporate \\"Nature Coast\\" in their names, but most of them do not explicitly define the region, or define a smaller region. For instance, the Nature Coast State Trail, which is officially designated as part of Florida‚Äôs Statewide System of Greenways and Trails, is located in Dixie, Gilchrist and Levy counties. The Nature Coaster website covers only Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties. This region of Florida is culturally partially southern, with the Deep South culture extending to Levy County. The lower southern end (Pasco, Hernando, and Citrus County) are often considered part of the Tampa Bay Area. The name \\"Nature Coast\\" was devised in 1991 as part of a marketing campaign to attract vacationers to the eight county area. The name eventually began to be used locally, and describes the area formally known as the \\"Big Bend\\" of Florida. St. Petersburg Times article, St. Petersburg Times - Feb 23, 1994 Activities common in this area include hunting, fishing, boating, bird watching and nature hiking. Snorkeling spots are found in the rivers along the Nature Coast. Diving and manatee tours are available, predominantly in areas such as Crystal River, Homosassa and Homosassa Springs. The Nature Coast is home to wildlife including deer, wild pigs, roseate spoonbills, alligators, raccoons, opossums, snakes, great blue herons, egrets, turtles and at least 19 endangered species.

Three basic versions have been produced, the 1UZ-FE, 2UZ-FE, and 3UZ-FE. Production spanned 24 years, from 1989 to mid 2013, ending with the final production of the 3UZ-FE-powered Toyota Crown Majesta I-FOUR. Toyota's UZ engine family was replaced by the UR engine family. 1UZ-FE The all- alloy 1UZ-FE debuted in 1989 in the first generation Lexus LS 400/Toyota Celsior and the engine was progressively released across a number of other models in the Toyota/Lexus range. The engine is oversquare by design, with a bore and stroke size of . It has proved to be a strong, reliable and smooth powerplant with features such as 6-bolt main bearings and belt-driven quad- camshafts. The water pump is also driven by the cam belt. The connecting rods and crankshaft are constructed of steel. The pistons are hypereutectic. 1UZ-FE (rear view) The FV2400-2TC derivative is one of the few road-going engines that is FAA approved for use in an airplane. Its resemblance to a race engine platform (6 bolt cross mains and over square configuration) was confirmed in 2007 by David Currier (in an interview with v-eight.com), vice president of TRD USA, stating that the 1UZ platform was based on CART/IRL engine design. It was planned to be used on GT500 vehicles, however its subsequent use in the Daytona Prototype use had not been planned. In its standard, original trim with 10.0:1 compression, power output is , torque of . The engine was slightly revised in 1995 with lighter connecting rods and pistons and an increased compression ratio to 10.4:1 resulting in peak power of at 5,400 rpm and torque of at 4,400 rpm. In 1997, Toyota's VVT-i variable valve timing technology was introduced along with a further compression ratio increase to 10.5:1, bumping power and torque to at 5,900 rpm and at 4,100 rpm. For the GS400, output was rated at at 6,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm. The 1UZ-FE was voted to the Ward's 10 Best Engines list for 1998 through 2000.

The old town lies from the sea clustered around the Castle of Saint Bernard, which is set on a hill. Between the old town and the sea lies the pine-covered hill of Costebelle, which overlooks the peninsula of Giens. Hy√®res is the oldest resort on the French Riviera. History=Hellenic Olbia The Hellenic city of OlbiaFor other Greek cities bearing this name, see Olbia. was refounded on the Phoenician settlement that dated to the fourth century BC; Olbia is mentioned by the geographer Strabo (IV.1.5) as a city of the Massiliotes that was fortified \\"against the tribe of the Salyes and against those Ligures who live in the Alps\\". Greek and Roman antiquities have been found in the area. The first reference to the town dates from 964. Middle Ages Originally a possession of the Viscount of Marseilles, it was later transferred to Charles of Anjou. Louis IX King of France (often known as \\"St Louis\\") landed at Hy√®res in 1254 when returning from the crusades. A commandry of the Knights Templar was based at the town in the 12th century, outside the town walls. The remaining remnant is the tower Saint-Blaise.Hy√®res, Pinterrest, accessed 7 August 2013 20th century After defecting from Soviet intelligence in 1937, Walter Krivitsky hid in Hy√®res (one of the farthest points in France from his operational base in Paris). World War II As part of Operation Dragoon on 15 August 1944, the First Special Service Force came ashore off the coast of Hy√®res to take the islands of Port-Cros and Levant. The small German garrisons offered little resistance and the whole eastern part of Port-Cros was secured by 06:30. All fighting was over on Levant by the evening, but, on Port-Cros, the Germans withdrew into old thick-walled forts. It was only when naval guns were brought to bear that they realised that further resistance was useless. An intense naval barrage on 18 August 1944 heralded the next phase of the operation‚Äîthe assault on the largest of the Hy√®res islands, Porquerolles. French forces‚Äînaval units and colonial formations, including Senegalese infantry‚Äîbecame involved on 22 August and subsequently occupied the island. A US-Canadian Special Forces landing at the eastern end of Porquerolles took large numbers of prisoners, the Germans preferring not to surrender to the Senegalese. Geography Its position facing the Mediterranean to the south makes it popular with tourists in the winter and makes it ideal for the cultivation of palm trees. About 100,000 trees are exported from the area each year. As a result, the town is frequently referred to as Hy√®res-les-Palmiers (palmiers meaning palm trees). Place Massillon, Hy√®res. The three islands of the √éles d'Hy√®res (namely, Porquerolles, Port-Cros, and the √éle du Levant) are just offshore. Porquerolles and Port-Cros form the Port-Cros National Park.

Winters are relatively mild and summers are hot, with maximum temperatures often surpassing . It is also one of the driest cities in France, with barely 57 rainy days per year and almost rainless summers. British and Americans in Hy√®res, 18th to early 20th centuries Lord Albemarle, the British ambassador, stayed in Hy√®res during the winter 1767-1768, and Prince Augustus, sixth son of George III, stayed there in the winter of 1788 for health reasons. The English agronomist Arthur Young visited Hy√®res on the advice of Lady Craven on 10 September 1789. He mentioned the many British living there in his book Travels in France. The London-born and Eton-educated Anglo-Grison Charles de Salis died in Hy√®res in July 1781, aged 45, and was buried in the Convent des Cordeliers. In 1791, Charlotte Turner Smith published her novel Celestina, which is set in Hy√®res. During the period of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars, the British left the area, but they returned after 1815. Joseph Conrad, who lived for a while in Hy√®res, wrote his novel, The Rover, which is set in Hy√®res, during those years. William FitzRoy, 6th Duke of Grafton spent the winter and spring each year at Hy√®res because he and his wife suffered from ill health. Edwin Lee M.D. published in 1857 a book on the virtues of the climate of Hy√®res for the recovery of pulmonary consumptionNotices sur Hy√®res et Cannes. Edwin Lee, M.D. 1857 and in November 1880 Adolphe Smith first published The Garden of Hy√®res, which is still in print, (see Hachette edition of 2012). In 1883, Robert Louis Stevenson came to Hy√®res and for about two years lived first at the Grand Hotel (the building still stands in the Avenue des Iles d'Or), and then in a chalet called Solitude in the present rue Victor-Basch. He wrote then: \\"That spot our garden and our view are sub-celestial. I sing daily with Bunian, that great bard. I dwell next door to Heaven!\\" In later years, he wrote from his retreat in Valima: \\"Happy (said I); I was only happy once; that was at Hy√®res\\". In 1884, Elisabeth Douglas, daughter of Alfred, Lord Douglas, had a small \\"cottage\\", as she called it, built on the Costebelle hill by the architect Thomas Donaldson, who used to spend his winters in Hy√®res during those years. The British presence culminated in the winter of 1892 (21 March - 25 April) when Queen Victoria came for a stay of three weeksLondon Illustrated News 19 March 1892 at the Albion Hotel. At that time, the British influence was so strong that shop signs were in both French and English. There was an English butcher, a chemist, two banks, and two golf courses. There were also two English churches (plus one at the Grand H√¥tel in Costebelle), whose buildings still exist: All Saint's Church at Costebelle and Saint Paul's English Church, Avenue Beauregard. Some signs of this English presence have vanished, like the small dell in the cemetery where there were once some hundred graves. Some of these, such as those of Lord Arthur Somerset or Richard John Meade, bore testimony to the aristocratic nature of the community. Other vestiges remain, like the fountain near the new public library in a square shaded by a plane tree. The inscription reads: \\"In loving memory of Marianne Stewart who died on 18 August 1900. She laboured many years in the cause of mercy to animals. Her last wish was that a drinking fountain should be set up for them in Hy√®res\\". Many wounded British soldiers were sent to the town to convalesce during World War I. The American novelist Edith Wharton wintered in Hy√®res annually from 1919 until her death in 1937. The garden of her villa, Castel Sainte-Claire, is open to the public. The villa previously belonged to Olivier Voutier, a French naval officer, whose grave is in the garden. It was Voutier who discovered the Venus de Milo in 1820 on the Aegean island of Milos. Transportation The railway station Gare d'Hy√®res offers connections with Toulon, Marseille, Paris, and several regional destinations. The airport, which is known officially as the Toulon-Hy√®res International Airport, is to the southeast of the town centre, on a sandy plain close to the seashore. The area was first used by private aircraft at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1920, after the marsh had been drained, French naval aircraft used the field, and, in 1925, it became an official base of the French Fleet Air Arm (A√©ronavale). It has been a commercial airport since 1966, but the navy maintains a significant facility for helicopters and fixed wing aircraft within the perimeter. There are currently (2009) scheduled flights to and from Stockholm, Bristol, Ajaccio, Paris, London, Brest, Brussels, and Rotterdam.  Personalities  Hy√®res was the birthplace of Jean Baptiste Massillon (1663‚Äì1742), churchman and preacher as well as Marius Gueit (1808‚Äì 1862), blind composer, organist and cellist. The author Jean-Marie- Edmond Sabran (1908‚Äì1994), who wrote under the pseudonyms Paul Berna (children's fiction), Bernard Deleuse and Paul Gerradwas (adult fiction), and Joel Audrenn (crime novels), was born in Hy√®res as well as Fran√ßois Coupry (born 1947), winner of the 1970 edition of the Prix des Deux Magots. The French historian Jules Michelet frequently spent the winter at Hy√®res. He died from a heart attack at Hy√®res on 9 February 1874. He was interred at Hy√®res. Following his widow's request, a Paris court granted permission for his body to be exhumed on 13 May 1876. Twin towns Hy√®res is twinned with Rottweil, Germany and with Koekelberg, Belgium. Culture Hy√®res is home to the Hy√®res International Fashion and Photography Festival, a huge fashion and art photography event that has taken place annually at the end of April since 1985. This festival was among the first to recognize the talents of Viktor & Rolf. The city also plays host to the annual MIDI French Riviera Festival in July, a music festival now into its sixth episode. 2010's MIDI saw around 15 acts play at the Villa Noailles complex and brought the new 'MIDI Night' event to Almanarre Beach in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Suvorov's Museum, Saint Petersburg Count Mikhail Fedotovich Kamensky (; 19 May 1738 ‚Äì 12 August 1809) was a Russian Field Marshal prominent in the Catherinian wars and the Napoleonic campaigns. Mikhail Kamensky served as a volunteer in the French army in 1758-1759. He then took part in the Seven Years' War. In 1783, Kamensky was appointed Governor General of Ryazan and Tambov guberniyas. During the war with Turkey, in 1788, he defeated the Turks at the Moldavian settlement of Gangur. When prince Potemkin fell ill and entrusted his command of the army to Mikhail Kakhovsky, Kamensky refused to subordinate himself, referring to his seniority. For this, he was discharged from military service. In 1797, Emperor Paul I granted Kamensky the title of count and made him retire. In 1806, Kamensky was appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian army in Prussia, which had been fighting the French armies of Napoleon. After six days of being in command, on the eve of the battle of Pu≈Çtusk, he transferred the command to Feodor Buxhoeveden under pretence of illness and left for his estate near Oryol.

The original canopied wall was pulled down after 1884 and a more massive wall partly of masonry and wrought iron was built with a new gate and a drinking fountain. In the courtyard there was an ablutions fountain (\\"≈°adrvan\\") with a stone basin and twelve pipes. The water for the fountain was brought from a spring that is still known as ≈†adrvan. Above the stone basin was a decorative wrought iron trellis, and in the 19th century a wooden baldaquin and dome and painted attic in the so-called Turkish baroque style was added which was demolished in 1955.and Herzegovina Commission to Preserve National Monuments : Ferhad Pasha mosque (Ferhadija) in Banja Luka, Decision of 7 May 2003, no: 08.2-6-533/03-8 One of three small adjacent mausoleums - Ferhad Pasha Turbe - contained the tombs of Ferhat-pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá, the others were for his granddaughter Safi-kaduna, and his ensign. A clock tower (\\"Sahat-Kula\\") was added later. Like most buildings of this type in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the mosque was on a modest scale: 18 meters (59 ft) wide, 14 meters (46 ft) long and 18 meters (59 ft) high at the top of the main dome. The minaret was 43 m (141 ft) high. According to legend, when the mosque was completed in 1579, Ferhat-Pasha had the masons locked inside this minaret, sentencing them to death so they could never make anything so beautiful, but one night they made wings and flew away.In Communion: Mosque to be rebuilt in Bosnian Serb territory ( Website of the Orthodox Peace Fellowship, News Reports Spring 2001); retrieved 26 January 2011 Ferhadija was listed as a Bosnia and Herzegovina cultural heritage site in 1950. It was subsequently protected by UNESCO until its destruction in 1993. Today the site, with the mosque's remains, is listed as a national monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Destruction Dome of rebuilt Ferhadija Mosque The mosque was one of 16 destroyed in the city of Banja Luka during the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995. The Republika Srpska authorities ordered the demolition of the entire Ferhadija and Arnaudija mosque complexes, which stood approximately apart. Both mosques were destroyed in the same night within 15 minutes of each other. (It has been noted that the almost simultaneous destruction of the Ferhadija and Arnaudija mosques required large quantities of explosives and extensive coordination. Many believe that this would not have been possible without the involvement of Banja Luka and Republika Srpska authorities.) The Serb militia blew up the Ferhadija Mosque on the night of 6‚Äì7 May 1993. May 6 is the date of the Serbian Orthodox holiday of ƒêurƒëevdan (Saint George's day). The minaret survived the first explosion, but was then razed to the ground.Transition Online Most of the debris was taken to the city dump; some stone, and ornamental details, were crushed by the Serbs for use as landfill. The leveled site was turned into a parking lot. Several weeks after the destruction of Ferhadija the nearby Sahat Kula, one of the oldest Ottoman clock towers in Europe, was also destroyed. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia a Serb leader from Banja Luka, Radoslav Brƒëanin, was convicted for his part in organizing the destruction of Muslim property including mosques, and also in the ethnic cleansing of non-Serbs. He was sentenced to a single prison term of 32 years. The Brƒëanin case proved that the destruction of the mosques was orchestrated as part of the ethnic cleansing2 campaign.UN.org: Brdjanin trial In addition, the Bosnian side in the Bosnian genocide case at the International Court of Justice has cited the destruction of Ferhadija Mosque as one of the elements of ethnic cleansing and genocide employed by the RS authorities during the Bosnian War. Reconstruction Ferhadija under reconstruction in 2014 In 2001, a building permit was granted to the Islamska Zajednica Banjaluke (Islamic Community of Banja Luka) to reconstruct the mosque. On May 7, Serb nationalists attacked about 300 Bosniaks attending the ceremony to mark the laying of the cornerstone. The New York Times reported that about 1,000 Orthodox Christian Serbs participated in the attack and that they threw rocks and burned vehicles, a bakery, Muslim prayer rugs, and the flag on the Islamic center, where they hoisted the Bosnian Serb flag; drove a pig onto the site of the mosque as an insult to Muslims; and trapped 250 people in the Islamic center including the head of the UN in Bosnia, the ambassadors from Great Britain, Sweden and Pakistan, and other international and local officials. Bosnian Serb police eventually released them. More than 30 Bosniaks were injured and at least eight were taken to the Banja Luka hospital. One died later from head injuries.Bosnian Serb Crowd Beats Muslims at Mosque Rebuilding, New York Times, May 8, 2001Perica Vucinic, Republic 0%, World Press Review Vol. 48,10 (October 2001) The disrupted ceremony took place on the 8th anniversary of the mosque's destruction, a date subsequently chosen as Bosnia and Herzegovina's official Day of the Mosques. A few days later, in secret and under heavy security, the ceremony was performed successfully. But because of the earlier attack, reconstruction was not undertaken. Although most of the mosques destroyed in Banja Luka in the Bosnian War have been reconstructed since 2001, Ferhadija is still a contentious issue. Work was delayed by the complexities involved in rebuilding it authentically. The Sarajevo School of Architecture's Design and Research Center had prepared preliminary studies, and the cost of reconstruction was estimated at about 12 million KM (around $8 million). A local magistrate ruled that the authorities of Banja Luka, which is Bosnian Serb-controlled, must pay $42 million to its Islamic community for the 16 local mosques (including Ferhadija Mosque) that were destroyed during the 1992-1995 Bosnian War.Bosnian Serbs Told To Pay $42Mln For Burnt Mosques , Dalje.com, February 20, 2009 However, this ruling was subsequently overturned by the highest court in Sarajevo when the Serb Republic objected to paying for the damage caused by individual people. The site, with its original architectural remains, is listed as a National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By Ruling of the Institute for the Protection of the Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina the building was placed under state protection and entered in the register of cultural monuments. The Regional Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina to 2002 listed the Ferhad-pa≈°a mosque in Banja Luka as a Category I building under serial no. 38. In June 2007 repairs were completed on the foundations that survived the destruction, and reconstruction of the masonry and the rest of the building was completed over the next nine years, with the mosque reopening in on 7 May 2016. Notes and references Notes: 1The ICTY Trial Chamber is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt both that the expulsions and forcible removals were systematic throughout the Autonomous Region of Krajina (ARK), in which and from where tens of thousands of Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were permanently displaced, and that this mass forcible displacement was intended to ensure the ethnic cleansing of the region. These people were left with no option but to escape. Those who were not expelled and did not manage to escape were subjected to intolerable living conditions imposed by the Serb authorities, which made it impossible for them to continue living there and forced them to seek permission to leave. Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were subjected to movement restrictions, as well as to perilous living conditions; they were required to pledge their loyalty to the Serb authorities and in at least one case, to wear white armbands. They were dismissed from their jobs and stripped of their health insurance. Campaigns of intimidation specifically targeting Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats were undertaken. 2This process of ethnic cleansing was sometimes camouflaged as a process of resettlement of populations. In Banja Luka, the Agency for Population Movement and the Exchange of Material Wealth for the ARK (\\"Agency\\"), which was established on 12 June 1992 pursuant to a decision of the ARK Crisis Staff, aided in the implementation of both the exchange of flats and the resettlement of populations. The Agency was popularly known variously as \\"Perka's Agency\\" or as \\"Brƒëanin's Agency\\". The ICTY Trial Chamber is of the view that although this Agency was set up for the exchange of flats and the resettlement of populations, this was nothing else but an integral part of the ethnic cleansing plan.

Released as a Virtual Boy launch game, it requires the player to pilot a space fighter and defeat the army of a malevolent artificial intelligence called \\"KAOS\\". The game takes inspiration from the 1993 title Star Fox, and it is one of the few third-party titles for the Virtual Boy. Unlike most of the console's games, Red Alarm features three-dimensional (3D) polygonal graphics. However, hardware constraints limited the visuals to bare wire-frame models, similar to those of the 1980 arcade game Battlezone. Reviewers characterized Red Alarms graphics as confusing, but certain publications praised it as one of the most enjoyable Virtual Boy titles. Gameplay and plot The player engages enemies. Shield and speed meters appear in the bottom corners of the screen. Red Alarm uses a red-and-black color scheme standard to the Virtual Boy. Red Alarm is a shoot 'em up that takes place in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. As a Virtual Boy game, it features a red-and-black color palette and stereoscopic 3D visuals, the depth of which may be adjusted by the player. The game is set during the 21st century, in the aftermath of a 70-year world war that led to the establishment of a utopian society without weapons. An artificially intelligent defense system called \\"KAOS\\", which had been used to end the war, becomes sentient and builds an army to wipe out humanity. Assuming control of a \\"Tech-Wing\\" space fighter, the player seeks to destroy KAOS's forces and finally its mainframe. The game is broken up into six levels, each of which culminates in a boss fight. The player uses the Tech-Wing's laser cannons to attack, and its guided missiles to destroy armored enemies. Shields on the craft offer limited protection from enemy fire; evasion is critical. The Tech- Wing may be maneuvered in any direction, and certain levels contain branching corridors and dead ends that force players to retrace their paths. Four camera angles‚Äîthree third-person viewpoints and the first-person \\"cockpit view\\"‚Äîare available. When a level is completed, the player may watch a replay of their performance from multiple perspectives. Development and release Red Alarm was published by Nintendo and developed by T&E; Soft, one of the few third- party companies approached to develop for the Virtual Boy. According to the console's creator, Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo tried to \\"maintain as much control as possible\\" over Virtual Boy game development so that low-quality releases by outside companies could be avoided. Although T&E; Soft was known for golf video games, the design of Red Alarm was inspired by that of Star Fox, a rail shooter for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This decision was considered by Patrick Kolan of IGN to be \\"a departure for the team\\". Unlike many Virtual Boy games, Red Alarm features an engine that displays 3D graphics: the game world is rendered in wire-frame polygonal visuals similar to those of the 1980 arcade game Battlezone. Because of the console's limited technology, solid 3D graphics were not viable. Red Alarm debuted in North America at the 1995 Winter Consumer Electronics Show, and it was confirmed as a launch game for the Virtual Boy at that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. Later that year, Red Alarm and several other titles were released alongside the console, which debuted on July 21 in Japan and August 14 in the United States. Reception Writing for Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin, Isabella Nagano called Red Alarms stereoscopic visuals \\"amazing\\", and Sawada Noda recommended the game to all owners of the Virtual Boy. In a more negative review, the publication's Mizu Pin characterized the wire-frame graphics as confusing and frustrating, a criticism echoed by the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly. A GamePro writer under the pseudonym \\"Slo Mo\\" found the visuals confusing as well, but felt that players could adjust to them. Slo Mo and Electronic Gaming Monthlys Danyon Carpenter and Al Manuel praised the title's control scheme, and the latter magazine's Andrew Baran summarized Red Alarm as \\"a nifty show-off game\\". The reviewer for Next Generation saw significant promise in Red Alarm, and believed that its elements should add up to \\"a fantastic game\\"; but the writer panned the final product as a wasted opportunity. Similarly, Danny Wallace of Total! wrote, \\"On the one hand, it's a pretty impressive 3D spacey shoot-em-up, with a real grip on the Virtual world and all those fancy techniques, and on the other it's an often visually confusing, headache-inducing attempt at being something it's quite obviously not.\\" However, Dave Halverson of DieHard GameFan called Red Alarm \\"a great shooter\\" with excellent graphics. Co-reviewer Nicholas Barres hailed it as a \\"masterpiece\\", and he considered it to be \\"the one and only reason to buy a Virtual Boy\\". A retrospective feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm as one of the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of the most entertaining titles on the console. In 2008, Kolan called it \\"a really competent shooter\\" with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as \\"pretty good fun to play\\", although inferior to Star Fox. Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game \\"kind of sucked\\".

Origins  The founding statement of END was the European Nuclear Disarmament Appeal issued in April 1980 and circulated by the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation (http://www.russfound.org).. The text of the END Appeal is included in E.P.Thompson and Dan Smith (Eds): Protest and Survive. A Penguin Special 1980, p 223-226. It was provoked by NATO's decision in December 1979 to respond to a Soviet upgrading of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe with its own nuclear modernisation ‚Äì cruise and Pershing II missiles to be deployed in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. The appeal began: > We are entering the most dangerous decade in human history. A third world > war is not merely possible but increasingly likely . . . In Europe, the main > geographical stage for the East-West confrontation, new generations of ever > more deadly nuclear weapons are appearing. The document was notable for two things in particular. First, it resolutely refused to take sides in the Cold War: We do not wish to apportion guilt between the military leaders of East and West. Guilt lies squarely upon both parties. Both parties have adopted menacing postures and committed aggressive actions in different parts of the world. . . Secondly, it argued not just for disarmament (a nuclear-free Europe \\"from Poland to Portugal‚Äù) but also for the destruction of the bloc system that had divided Europe since 1945 ‚Äì a goal it envisaged being achieved by a novel strategy of ‚Äúd√©tente from below‚Äù: > The remedy lies in our own hands . . . We must commence to act as if a > united, neutral and pacific Europe already exists. We must learn to be > loyal, not to ‚ÄòEast‚Äô or ‚ÄòWest‚Äô, but to each other, and we must disregard the > prohibitions and limitations imposed by any national state . . . We must > resist any attempt by the statesmen of East and west to manipulate this > movement to their own advantage. . . The main authors of the appeal were British ‚Äì E. P. Thompson, Mary Kaldor, Dan Smith and Ken Coates ‚Äì and it was launched at a press conference in the House of Commons. But their intention was to create a Europe-wide movement, and by summer 1980 it had been endorsed by an impressive list of supporters, mainly in western Europe but with a smattering from the Soviet bloc, among them former Hungarian prime minister Andras Hegedus and Russian dissident Roy Medvedev. Several other East European intellectuals signed later.  The END Conventions  With movements for nuclear disarmament emerging throughout western Europe and gaining support from social democratic and Euro-communist parties, the Russell Foundation, centred on Ken Coates, consulted about organising a massive conference to bring together everyone involved. The first European Nuclear Disarmament Convention subsequently took place in Brussels, Belgium, in 1982. According to historian Lawrence Wittner (1993) END was \\"the very heart and soul of the massive antinuclear campaign\\" (p. 234).Wittner, Lawrence S. 1993. The struggle against the bomb. Stanford, Calif., Stanford University Press. Most participants considered the convention a success, and Coates's ad hoc conference organising committee became a semi-permanent END Liaison Committee, with members from the main west European peace movement organisations and most west European social-democratic and Euro-communist parties, which organised further END Conventions in Berlin (1983), Perugia, Italy (1984), Amsterdam (1985), √âvry, France (1986), Coventry, UK (1987), Lund, Sweden (1988), Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain (1989), Helsinki, Finland/Tallinn, Estonia (1990) and finally Moscow (1991). During these conventions, especially in Perugia and Amsterdam, there was an intensive cooperation with the Dutch Interchurch Peace Council (IKV) and their secretary-general Mient Jan Faber and Wim Bartels. Bartels was also the president of the International Peace Coordination Centre (IPCC), a cooperation of 'like-minded' movements, which linked their commitment of the struggle against nuclear weapons and the support of independent, dissident peace-initiatives in Eastern-Europe. Despite this intensive cooperation there also existed some kind of rivalry between the END network and the IPCC. Since most peace movements were present in both, it seemed both networks were doing very similar work.  END in the UK  Thompson, Kaldor and others in the END group in the UK disagreed with Coates's interest in winning the support of political parties and trade union leaders, and in 1983 there was a parting of the ways: Coates and his Nottingham-based Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation concentrated on the Convention process, leaving Thompson and Kaldor as dominant figures in the UK END group. From then on, the UK END group was very much a separate entity from the conventions, although it took part in them and was represented on the Liaison Committee. Nationally, END only became a membership organisation in 1985, when the nuclear disarmament movement was ebbing, when it recruited only 500 members. However, when the nuclear disarmament first grew in 1980 and 1981, in some localities local nuclear disarmament groups were founded as 'END groups': Hull END, for example, had hundreds of members throughout the first half of the 1980s. Nationally END played a major role in the British peace movement of the 1980s. END supporters, most notably Thompson and Kaldor, were the most prominent intellectuals of the movement, constantly in demand for public meetings and for opinion pieces in newspapers and magazines (The Guardian, the New Statesman and Tribune were always particularly keen). END also provided the main peace movement organisation, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, with much of its leadership: (Bruce Kent, Joan Ruddock, Dan Smith and Meg Beresford were all END supporters). END's insistence on criticising Soviet militarism made it highly controversial in CND, where communists and pro- Soviet Labour leftists were a vocal though small minority ‚Äì but it meant that it was taken much more seriously by the Labour Party, which had adopted a non- nuclear defence policy in 1980. More than 60 Labour MPs signed the END Appeal in 1980, and END supporters, among them Kaldor and Smith, served on Labour advisory committees on defence. END also had significant support among Liberals opposed to nuclear arms (although not among their allies in the Social Democratic Party) as well as among members of the nascent Green party. Even a few daring dissident members of the Conservative and Communist parties lent their support. END also organised regular speaking tours and conferences on various disarmament-related themes.  END Publications  The END Bulletin and ENDPapers series were published by the Russell Foundation, beginning in 1980. Subsequently, British END published a series of pamphlets through Merlin Press and a bi-monthly magazine, European Nuclear Disarmament Journal, which was edited by Mary Kaldor. It was published from 1983 to 1988.  D√©tente from below  What END was probably best known for, however, was its work with dissidents in the Soviet Union and its east-central European satellite states. Although the END Appeal had won some support from dissidents in the Soviet bloc at its launch, most were hesitant about the western peace movements, which they felt were parroting Soviet slogans and had no sympathy for people living under communist dictatorship. V√°clav Havel expressed this view forcefully in his essay ‚ÄúAn Anatomy of a Reticence‚Äù (1985). Nevertheless, thanks largely to the persistence of END and like-minded activists from other countries, who kept up a constant stream of correspondence with dissidents in the Soviet bloc and visited them whenever they could, by the mid-1980s a fruitful dialogue had been established. END had working groups for each Soviet bloc country. The Czechoslovakia group exchanged views with and visited Havel and his colleagues in Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia; the Hungary group did the same with Gy√∂rgy Konr√°d, Miklos Haraszti and a small group of young peace activists in Hungary; the Poland group the same with Adam Michnik, Jacek Kuron and many younger activists; the East Germany group the same with B√§rbel Bohley and others who were later to be the core of Neues Forum.  The end of END  Both the END Conventions and the UK END group went into decline in the late 1980s after the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty removed the weapons that had given the European peace movement its raison d‚Äôetre ‚Äì though the conventions continued until 1991 (in Moscow) and END in the UK turned itself in 1989 into European Dialogue, a pressure group for encouraging the development of democracy and civil society, which is still going.

The term international subscriber dialling was used in the United Kingdom and Australia until the terminology was changed to international direct dialling. Since the late 20th century, most international calls are dialed directly. Calls are initiated by dialing the international call prefix for the originating country, followed by the country calling code for the destination country, and finally the national telephone number of the destination. When phone numbers are published for international use, the international call prefix is omitted, and the number should start with a plus sign (+) followed by the country calling code. The plus sign indicates that the country code follows and that an access code may have to be dialed in the originating country. The first transatlantic direct dial telephone call was made by Sally Reed in Dedham, Massachusetts to her penpal, Ann Morsley, in Dedham, Essex, in 1957. It was witnessed by Reed's teacher, Grace Hine, Dedham's former chief telephone operator, Margaret Dooley, and several representatives of New England Telephone and Telegraph Company. Examples A fictitious number in Sydney, Australia is (02) 3456 7890. It is published in the form +61 2 3456 7890 for international use. In the countries participating in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), such as the United States, Canada, and some Caribbean nations, this number is dialed as 011 61 2 3456 7890, with 011 being the international call prefix used in the NANP and 61 being the country calling code of Australia. From most of the rest of the world, the international access code is 00, so the call is dialed as 00 61 2 3456 7890, as recommended by the regulations of the ITU. However, for Australians wish to dial international numbers, the international access code calling from Australia is 0011, as opposed to 011 or 00.

The FNS is the federal agency responsible for administering the nation‚Äôs domestic nutrition assistance programs. The service helps to address the issue of hunger in the United States. FNS administers the programs through its headquarters in Alexandria, VA; regional offices in San Francisco, Denver, Dallas, Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, and Robbinsville (NJ); and field offices throughout the US. While its staff number among the USDA's fewest, its budget is by far the largest. The Food and Nutrition Service is funded under the umbrella of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the annual Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. In 2019, $27 billion was allocated for discretionary funding for USDA, which is spread out over many services including WIC, food safety, and other services. Of the expected people to be served in 2019, the estimate for SNAP recipients is 40.8 million, 30 million to have received school lunches, 15 million to have received school breakfast, 6.6 million participating in WIC, and 690,000 elderly people receiving Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP). The FNS uses grants to distribute funds to companies that compete to provide services for the agency. For noncompetitive awards, grants may also be awarded using a technical evaluation. During a Request for Application Funding Announcement (RFA), the FNS releases a Request for Applications (RFA) outlining program goals, requirements, and timetables. Solicitors may submit their applications for consideration. Applications are reviewed for completeness, risk assessment, eligibility, and cost analysis. Potential candidates then undergo a negotiation process. Selected recipients then are awarded the grant, which is further subjected to post-award monitoring and auditing to ensure the grant requirements are being fulfilled. Any conflicts in the process are handled by the Grants Management Office. At the closeout of the grant, a final review is conducted to ensure all aspects of the negotiations have been met. Partnership programs exist within the FNS that encourage entities that are either non- profit, faith-based, government, or corporate that want to contribute to ending hunger. Through volunteering time, by donations and grants to supporting programs, encourage local purchase/selling of produce and products, or by providing food to those in needs through a financial reimbursement program, the FNS encourages all communities to participate. A Partnership Agreement Formhttps://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/partnership_agreement_form.pdf is necessary to provide recognition between the FNS and the providing entity. An \\"Ask the Expert\\" page is available to answer common questions and provide direction on where to find information. Everything from information about where to find food recalls, FNS program support, import/exporting plants, farmer support, conservation, civil rights, and many other topics are cataloged and available for searching. For information not found, questions can be submitted for a program expert to reply to you via email. The FNS, like all related government programs, actively encourage the reporting of fraud at any level to reduce improper use of federal funds. In addition to reporting fraud to the USDA Office of Inspector General directly, every state has contact points to report unlawful fraud. The Civil Rights Division is charged with ensuring lawful and timely delivery of services for all their employees and customers. History FNS was established on August 8, 1969 as an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Several FNS programs, however, pre-date the creation of the agency and trace their roots back to Depression-era programs. In 2018, 11.1% of the US population were deemed as being 'food insecure'. This is a 0.07% decrease from 2017. Food insecurity is deemed as a household not having enough resources or insufficient funds to provide for everyone in their family. This equates to 37.2 million people affected by food insecurity. Non-white ethnicity groups are most impacted, while groups such as poverty stricken (with an income-to-poverty ratio under 1.00) and single women with children lead with higher percentages of households affected. States with an affected food security average of 15% or more that were polled within 2016-2018 are New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia, and North Carolina. Services FNS products and services are provided to one in five Americans; its main products and services include: * commodities supplied as: prepared meals that are served at congregate feeding sites; food packages that may be used for home consumption; and disaster relief assistance * food assistance through electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards; nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free meals and snacks; vouchers; and, fresh, locally grown produce * nutrition education and promotion materials and presentations delivered by expert staff and senior managers; and * food safety and security efforts, technical assistance and informational materials Core Nutrition Messages is a consumer facing nutrition education advocacy program within the FNS that is designed to follow the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). It ties in the dietary needs of whole grains, low fat milk, fruits, and vegetables while providing advice and guidance on best practices. It is designed to guide users of the programs towards healthy food choices by suggesting portion sizes and food types. Available communications include motivational messages and guidance such as \\"Milk matters.\\" and \\"They take their lead from you ...\\", along with videos and even kids games. One of the many FNS outreach programs, National School Lunch Program, has a focus on National School Lunch Week that runs mid October. Culminating many activities geared towards children, there are marketing materials for parents, teachers, and School Nutrition Professionals on how to support children's food choices. The Choose My Plate website provides educational materials catered to many different audience levels for support on identifying healthy foods, recipes, eating on a budget, and cultivating a plan for eating healthy and balanced foods based on USDA recommendations. The FNS has a Twitter presence under \\"USDA FNS\\" as @USDANutrition at Twitterhttps://twitter.com/USDANutrition garnering nearly 90k followers with over 17k tweets as of October 2019.

The Office of Community Food Systems (OCFS) purpose is to support the many programs that run underneath it with a focus on using locally grown foods to support local economies. Most of these programs are geared towards children, although the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) includes day care for both children and seniors over 60 years old. The USDA Farm to School Grant Program is funded through the use of grants by the USDA, with 2019 seeing nearly $10 million awarded supporting 3.2 million students in over 5,400 schools across 42 states. The program also seeks to encourage young children to pursue careers related to the creation and distribution of food supplies.

History Entrance, photographed in May 2006 Set up in 1987 by Jim Cronin with assistance from both Jeremy Keeling and later operated by both Cronin and his wife Alison along with a team of care staff led by Keeling, Monkey World was originally intended to provide a home for abused chimpanzees used as props by Spanish beach photographers, but is now home to many different species of primates. Monkey World's first resident was a female Bornean Orangutan named Amy, who had been hand-reared by Keeling. Amy was later paired with a male orangutan named Banghi, who was given to Monkey World on loan from Chester Zoo. In 1997, Amy and Banghi had a son together named Gordon before Banghi passed away in 1998. On 13 July 1987, Monkey World's first chimpanzees Paddy (d. 2016), Busta, Jimmy, Micky, Sammy, Taffy (d. 1989), Beth, Cindy and Zoe arrived at the park. In April 1998, Monkey World rescued a young female chimpanzee named Trudy, who had been filmed being beaten by Mary Chipperfield. Chipperfield was later charged with 12 counts of animal cruelty. On Saturday 17 March 2007 Jim Cronin died in a New York hospital aged 55 years from liver cancer. His widow Alison Cronin and the staff at Monkey World have continued to run the centre.Monkey World Ape Rescue Centre ‚Äì MONKEY BUSINESS STAR DIES Monkey World works with foreign governments to stop the illegal smuggling of wild primates.

In September 2018, Monkey World rescued a female chimpanzee named Toprish, who had been stolen from the wild for the illegal pet trade before being left at a zoo in Turkey. In October that same year, Monkey World rescued another female chimpanzee named Naree, whom Alison Cronin first encountered with Jim in 2003. In February 2020, Monkey World rescued a 37-year-old chimpanzee named Kalu, who had been kept as a pet on a stud farm in South Africa until her owner's death.https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/18296642.meet-kalu-chimpanzee- latest-arrival-monkey-world/ Overview Monkey World features the largest group of chimpanzees outside of Africa which are housed in four different social groups. Many of its animals are rescued from the black market pet trade, laboratories and from abuse as tourist photographer props. The park also features three groups of orangutans, including two different species (Bornean and Sumatran). It is host to Europe's only orangutan cr√®che which raises all orphaned or abandoned orangutans in Europe. Whilst open to housing gorillas, the park has not yet come across any which require rescue or rehabilitation at the park. Additionally, the park houses five different species of gibbon (agile gibbon, lar gibbon, M√ºller's gibbon, siamang and golden-cheeked gibbon) and 14 species of monkey/prosimian (capuchins, common marmosets, Geoffrey's marmosets, cotton-top tamarins, patas monkeys, red- bellied guenons, ring-tailed lemurs, white-faced saki, slow loris, spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys, stump-tailed macaques and woolly monkeys). Dao Tien Rescue Centre In 2008, Monkey World along with the Pingtung Rescue Centre, Cat Tien National Park and the Forestry Protection Department worked together to create the Dao Tien Rescue centre in South Vietnam to save gibbons and other primates from the pet trade, smuggling, theme parks and restaurants. Since opening, Dao Tien has confiscated and/or rescued over 50 endangered primates including golden-cheeked gibbons, pygmy slow loris, black-shanked douc, grey-shanked douc, southern white-cheeked gibbon, northern buffed- cheeked gibbon, white-faced saki and silvered langur. 27 of these primates have been rehabilitated and released into native habitats. After release they are tracked using radio collars. Dao Tien is run by the charity Endangered Asian Species Trust (EAST), who rescue and rehabilitate endangered Vietnamese primates.

He played with some of the most influential English blues rock and jazz fusion bands of the 1960s and 1970s. Early years Dick Heckstall-Smith was born in the Royal Free Hospital, in Ludlow, Shropshire, England, and was raised in Knighton, Radnorshire, learning to play piano, clarinet and alto saxophone in childhood. He attended a York boarding school but refused a second term there, instead enrolling in Gordonstoun, where his father had accepted a job as headmaster of the local grammar school. Heckstall-Smith completed his education at Dartington Hall School, before reading agriculture ‚Äì and co-leading the university jazz band ‚Äì at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, from 1953. Aged 15, he had taken up the soprano sax while at Dartington, captivated by the sound of Sidney Bechet. Then Lester Young and tenor saxophonist bebop jazzman Wardell Gray proved to be major influences for him.Stephanie Thorburn, \\"Soul Survivor: The Seminal Dick Heckstall-Smith Dies, Aged 70\\", 2004. Grahambond.net Musical career Dick Heckstall-Smith with Colosseum at the Joint Meeting Festival in D√ºsseldorf/Germany, May 1970 Heckstall-Smith was an active member of the London jazz scene from the late 1950s (including a six-month stint from December 1957 with the band led by clarinettist Sandy Brown).\\"Dick Heckstall- Smith\\" (obituary), The Daily Telegraph, 21 December 2004. He joined Blues Incorporated, Alexis Korner's groundbreaking blues group, in 1962, recording the album R&B; from the Marquee. The following year, he was a founding member of that band's breakaway unit, The Graham Bond Organisation. (The lineup also included two future members of the blues-rock supergroup Cream: bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker.) In 1967, Heckstall-Smith became a member of guitarist-vocalist John Mayall's blues rock band, Bluesbreakers. That jazz- skewed edition of the band also included drummer Jon Hiseman, bassist Tony Reeves, and future Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor. They released the album Bare Wires in 1968. From 1968 to 1971, Heckstall-Smith, Hiseman, and Reeves were members of the pioneering UK jazz-rock band Colosseum. The band afforded Heckstall-Smith an opportunity to showcase his writing and instrumental virtuosity, playing two saxophones simultaneously. When Colosseum broke up in October 1971, Heckstall-Smith recorded solo albums and fronted and played in several other fusion units, including Manchild, Sweet Pain, Big Chief, Tough Tenors, The Famous Bluesblasters, Mainsqueeze, and DHSS. Collaborating musicians common to many of these outfits included Victor Brox, Keith Tillman and harp player John O'Leary, a founder member of Savoy Brown. In the 1980s in his Electric Dream ensemble Heckstall-Smith also worked with the South African percussionist Julian Bahula. From 1983-86 Dick was a member of 3 Space with John James (guitar) Dave Moore (keys), Dave was a fellow member of Mainsqueeze, and Chris Billings (bass) also Paul Harris (keys) for one tour. Apart from Tenor and Soprano, Dick also played Baritone sax in 3 Space. Heckstall-Smith participated in a 1990s reunion of the original Colosseum lineup and played in the hard-working Hamburg Blues Band. In 2001 he recorded the all-star project Blues and Beyond, which reunited him with Mayall, Bruce, Taylor, ex-Mayall and Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green. Heckstall-Smith published his witty memoirs, The Safest Place in the World, in 1984; an expanded version, retitled Blowing the Blues, was published in 2004.

It is the capital of the Tundama Province. Duitama is located northeast of Bogot√°, the capital city of Colombia and northeast of Tunja, the capital Boyac√°. Official website Duitama Duitama has existed since pre-Columbian times, when the Muisca inhabited the hills surrounding a former lake in the valley. The original name of Duitama was \\"Tundama\\", named after cacique Tundama. The elevation of the city is about above sea level and the average temperature is 16 ¬∞C. Duitama is known as \\"The Pearl of Boyac√°\\".  Etymology  The name of Duitama means \\"to me the tribute\\" in muyskkubun (Muisca language).http://www.duitama-boyaca.gov.co/?idcategoria=1987 Nombre de Duitama In its beginnings, Duitama corresponded to a Muisca village ruled by the cacique Tundama, a word that changed for Duitama, absolute and powerful lord that he had as bosses tributaries to the Onzaga, Soat√°, Chitagoto, Susac√≥n or Cabita, Icabuco, Lupachoque, S√°tiva, Tutaz√° and Cerinza caciques. The natives lived in boh√≠os, looking for the heights of the plain of the Indians, Tigua, today hills of La Milagrosa, Cargua, La Tolosa, San Jos√© (La Alacranera) and Tocogua.  Geography  Duitama, situated on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is bounded to the north by the department of Santander; Charal√° and Encino, to the south by the Boyac√° municipalities of Tibasosa and Paipa, to the east with the municipalities of Santa Rosa de Viterbo and Floresta.  Climate  History  Duitama in the times before the Spanish conquest was called Tundama.  Conquest of Duitama  Before the Spanish conquest, the Muisca were organized in a loose Muisca Confederation.Muisca Confederation The confederation was composed of four main political and religious leaders, from south to north; the zipa based in Bacat√°, the zaque of Hunza, the iraca of Sugamuxi and the Tundama of Duitama, then called Tundama. Additionally, more independent caciques governed other villages. The Tundama ruled over the villages of Onzaga, Soat√°, Chitagoto, Susac√≥n, Icabuco, Lupachoque, S√°tiva, Tutaz√° and Cerinza. The Tundama lived on the hill currently called La Tolosa. In 1536, Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada set foot from the Caribbean coastal city of Santa Marta towards the inner highlands of then unexplored Colombia with an army of 800 men. After conquering the southern areas of the Muisca, accessed from the shores of the Magdalena River he and a reduced number of troops marched towards the northern Muisca territories. He first submitted Hunza, the seat of the zaque and in September 1537 he arrived in Sugamuxi, sacred City of the Sun where his soldiers accidentally burned the Sun Temple. Biography Cacique Tundama - Pueblos Originarios Iraca rulers - Pueblos Originarios The cacique Tundama heard about the invading foreigners and tried to win time while hiding his treasures from the Spanish. One of his men proposed to surrender to the soldiers armed with superior weapons, and Tundama cut off his ears and left hand. At the end of 1539, another Spanish conquistador who proved himself in the Kingdom of Quito and Peru, Baltasar Maldonado, entered the Tundama territories and after several battles Tundama surrendered to the Spanish rule. Tundama was killed by a hammer of Maldonado in late December 1539. = Tundama in Muisca history  Colonial period  During the colonial period of the newly established state New Kingdom of Granada, Duitama was converted to catholicism by friars of Santo Domingo, arriving in 1556. They held their positions until 1775. Modern Duitama was not founded until 1819, before Sim√≥n Bol√≠var liberated the later state of Gran Colombia from the Spanish rule.  Modern age  Duitama was an agricultural community that grew after the installation of the train station in 1923 and the connection with the Colombian capital via highway. From 1950 onwards the city hosted more industry.  International events  In 1995, Duitama was the second city in Latin America to host the UCI Road World Championships. The first city to host that event was San Crist√≥bal, Venezuela in 1977.  Tourism  In Duitama the touristic village Pueblito Boyacense is a popular destination.

In computer science a T-tree is a type of binary tree data structure that is used by main-memory databases, such as Datablitz, EXtremeDB, MySQL Cluster, Oracle TimesTen and MobileLite. A T-tree is a balanced index tree data structure optimized for cases where both the index and the actual data are fully kept in memory, just as a B-tree is an index structure optimized for storage on block oriented secondary storage devices like hard disks. T-trees seek to gain the performance benefits of in-memory tree structures such as AVL trees while avoiding the large storage space overhead which is common to them. T-trees do not keep copies of the indexed data fields within the index tree nodes themselves. Instead, they take advantage of the fact that the actual data is always in main memory together with the index so that they just contain pointers to the actual data fields. The 'T' in T-tree refers to the shape of the node data structures in the original paper which first described this type of index. Node structures A T-tree node usually consists of pointers to the parent node, the left and right child node, an ordered array of data pointers and some extra control data. Nodes with two subtrees are called internal nodes, nodes without subtrees are called leaf nodes and nodes with only one subtree are named half-leaf nodes. A node is called the bounding node for a value if the value is between the node's current minimum and maximum value, inclusively. Bound values. For each internal node, leaf or half leaf nodes exist that contain the predecessor of its smallest data value (called the greatest lower bound) and one that contains the successor of its largest data value (called the least upper bound). Leaf and half-leaf nodes can contain any number of data elements from one to the maximum size of the data array. Internal nodes keep their occupancy between predefined minimum and maximum numbers of elements Algorithms=Search * Search starts at the root node * If the current node is the bounding node for the search value then search its data array. Search fails if the value is not found in the data array. * If the search value is less than the minimum value of the current node then continue search in its left subtree. Search fails if there is no left subtree. * If the search value is greater than the maximum value of the current node then continue search in its right subtree. Search fails if there is no right subtree. Insertion * Search for a bounding node for the new value. If such a node exists then ** check whether there is still space in its data array, if so then insert the new value and finish ** if no space is available then remove the minimum value from the node's data array and insert the new value. Now proceed to the node holding the greatest lower bound for the node that the new value was inserted to. If the removed minimum value still fits in there then add it as the new maximum value of the node, else create a new right subnode for this node. * If no bounding node was found then insert the value into the last node searched if it still fits into it. In this case the new value will either become the new minimum or maximum value. If the value doesn't fit anymore then create a new left or right subtree. If a new node was added then the tree might need to be rebalanced, as described below. Deletion * Search for bounding node of the value to be deleted. If no bounding node is found then finish. * If the bounding node does not contain the value then finish. * delete the value from the node's data array Now we have to distinguish by node type: * Internal node: If the node's data array now has less than the minimum number of elements then move the greatest lower bound value of this node to its data value. Proceed with one of the following two steps for the half leaf or leaf node the value was removed from. * Leaf node: If this was the only element in the data array then delete the node. Rebalance the tree if needed. * Half leaf node: If the node's data array can be merged with its leaf's data array without overflow then do so and remove the leaf node. Rebalance the tree if needed.  Rotation and balancing  A T-tree is implemented on top of an underlying self-balancing binary search tree. Specifically, Lehman and Carey's article describes a T-tree balanced like an AVL tree: it becomes out of balance when a node's child trees differ in height by at least two levels. This can happen after an insertion or deletion of a node. After an insertion or deletion, the tree is scanned from the leaf to the root. If an imbalance is found, one tree rotation or pair of rotations is performed, which is guaranteed to balance the whole tree. When the rotation results in an internal node having fewer than the minimum number of items, items from the node's new child(ren) are moved into the internal node.  Performance and Storage  Although T-trees were once widely used for main-memory databases because of performance benefits, recent trends for very large main-memory databases put more emphasis on provisioning cost. With modern NOSQL database systems often storing trillions of records, the memory cost to store even a single index that includes actual values can exceed tens or even hundreds of terabytes.

The original was a slapstick comedy aimed primarily at children. The second series straddles a variety of genres, including swashbuckling adventures with elements of fantasy, mystery, and science fiction, while retaining slapstick humor offset by dashes of satire and political and cultural commentary. Publication history The first Mendy and the Golem series followed the exploits of Mendy Klein, who found a Golem in their father's synagogue. The Klein siblings and their Golem (named Sholem) get into all sorts of scrapes, and walk out of them with a moral based on Jewish texts. In the second series, the Kleins have created a modern-day Golem with the assistance of the venerable Reb Zushe, an aging Rabbinical scholar.

Etymology The term hypostyle comes from the ancient Greek ·ΩëœÄœåœÉœÑœÖŒªŒøœÇ hyp√≥st»≥los meaning \\"under columns\\" (where ·ΩëœÄœå hyp√≥ means below or underneath and œÉœÑ·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ st≈∑los means column).\\"Hypostyle\\", Random House Dictionary (unabridged) 2011. Technical options The roof may be constructed with bridging lintels of stone, wood or other rigid material such as cast iron, steel or reinforced concrete. There may be a ceiling. The columns may be all the same height or, as in the case of the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak, the columns flanking the central space may be of greater height rather than those of the side aisles, allowing openings in the wall above the smaller columns, through which light is admitted over the aisle roof, through clerestory windows. Applications The architectural form has many applications, occurring in the cella of ancient Greek temples and in many Asian buildings, particularly of wood construction.

It can also refer to the seller raising the asking price or asking for more money at the last minute, after previously verbally agreeing to a lower one. In either case, the original buyer is left in a bad situation, and either has to offer a higher price or lose the purchase. The term gazumping is most commonly used in the UK, Ireland and Australia, although similar practices can be found in some other jurisdictions.  England and Wales  With buoyant property prices in the British residential property market of the late 1980s and early 1990s, gazumping became commonplace in England and Wales because a buyer's offer is not legally binding even after acceptance of the offer by the vendor. This is because, by s.2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 and in order to prevent dishonesty, a contract for the sale of land must be in writing, a requirement of English law that dates back to the Statute of Frauds of 1677. This requirement was originally intended to promote good faith and certainty in land transactions. When the owner accepts the offer on a property, the buyer will usually not yet have commissioned a building survey nor will the buyer have yet had the opportunity to perform recommended legal checks. The offer to purchase is made \\"subject to contract\\" and thus, until written contracts are exchanged either party can pull out at any time. It can take as long as 10‚Äì12 weeks for formalities to be completed, and if the seller is tempted by a higher offer during this period it leaves the buyer disappointed and out-of-pocket. Asking price has no impact on whether a property has been \\"gazumped\\". Any offer over a previous offer that is subsequently accepted is known as gazumping. When property prices are in decline the practice of gazumping becomes rare. The term 'gazundering' has been coined for the opposite practice whereby the buyer waits until everybody is poised to exchange contracts before lowering the offer on the property, threatening the collapse of a whole chain of house sales waiting for the deal to go through. 'Gazanging' describes a similar situation, where a seller pulls out of a sale entirely, expecting to get a better asking price or offer once the market improves. The term may be derived from the Yiddish word 'gezumph'' meaning to overcharge or cheat. Scotland Scots law and practice makes the problem of gazumping a rarity in Scotland. In the Scottish system of conveyancing buyers either obtain a survey prior to making a bid to the seller's solicitor or make an offer \\"subject to survey\\". Sellers normally set a closing date for written offers, then provide written acceptance of the chosen bid. The agreement becomes binding when a seller's solicitor delivers a signed written acceptance of a buyer's offer. Should the seller attempt to accept a higher bid after the contracts have been legally finalised by a written offer and acceptance, their solicitor will refuse to act for them as this, according to the Law Society of Scotland code of practice, would be professional misconduct. As in England, all contracts for the sale of land must be evidenced in writing signed by or on behalf of each party. In Scotland the parties' solicitors sign on their behalf, unlike in England, where buyer and seller both sign a contract which has been produced in duplicate form, with the duplicates then being exchanged to effect a binding contract. It is often wrongly claimed that gazumping is a rarity in Scotland because it is said that an oral agreement on a property deal is legally binding; while the law on contract differs from the law in England, the rarity is due to the different system of conveyancing. In Scotland however, an estate agent, acting on behalf of the seller, can initiate instances of another form of gazumping. Once a closing date for written offers has been reached and an estate agent has given an oral acceptance of the chosen bid, the estate agent can then attempt to induce a bidding war between the successful buyer and a rival, who may be fictional, in an attempt to increase the offer made by each party. In such circumstance there is little recourse for a successful buyer who, despite having been informed orally that their offer has been accepted, is then informed orally that their offer has been rejected in favour of a higher bid. Such situations only occur at an early stage of the conveyancing process, prior to any written acceptance of an offer being given by the seller's solicitor. Often they result from the legal requirement on the part of estate agents to advise a seller of any higher offer received prior to written confirmation of an orally accepted offer being given, including those received after a closing date. In Scotland, gazundering is possible where the buyer has insufficient assets to be worth suing, but is not common. United States The term gazumping is not used in the United States. Every state has different laws and traditions, but buyers typically make a written offer that, when accepted (signed) by the seller, is in most localities binding on the seller. This is known as a \\"purchase and sale\\" contract, which may have conditions. U.S. residential purchase contracts typically contain an inspection clause, a short period during which the buyer can inspect the property and back out of the contract with the full return of the earnest money, if the property does not pass the buyer's inspections. The seller, however, cannot, except in some states, back out during the inspection period. New Jersey is one state where the seller has a \\"legal review\\" period, during which they can back out of an accepted contract. Gazundering In a falling or depressed market the term \\"gazundering\\" refers to the practice whereby a prospective buyer (especially of property) makes an oral offer (a promise to purchase) on the property at an agreed price but subsequently threatens to withdraw the offer unless the seller agrees to a lower price.

He was also the military commander of the Greater Poland Uprising. Youth and Service in the Russian Military (1867-1914) Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki was born in Garb√≥w in the Radom Governorate of Congress Poland, the part of Poland that was then a part of the Russian Empire. His family traced its roots to medieval Polish nobility of evangelical reformed denomination. His basic education, Dowbor received in the Nikolayevskiy Cadet Corps (Saint Petersburg). In 1884 he joined the Russian military and graduated from the 2nd Konstantinovskoye Military School (Saint Petersburg) in 1888. After serving in the Fanagorisky Grenadiers regiment, he studied at the General Staff Academy and graduated in 1902. He served in Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War as a staff officer with the First Siberian Corps. On September 11, 1906, he was appointed a senior staff adjutant of the Irkutsk Military District and on March 2, 1908, a staff officer of the Xth Corps. On November 9, 1910 he became chief of staff of the 10th Infantry Division and on April 21, 1912 he was appointed to the same position with the 7th Infantry Division. World War I (1914-1917) At the beginning of World War I, Dowbor- Mu≈õnicki was put in command of the 14th Siberian Infantry Regiment. On September 3, 1915, Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki, by then a general, was assigned to the staff of the Russian 1st Army. On February 25, 1916 he was put in charge of the 123rd Infantry Division and on November 7, 1916 of the 38th Infantry Division. He was temporarily put in charge of the staff of the Russian 1st Army on January 17, 1917, 5 weeks before the February Revolution that overthrew Tsar Nicholas II. 1917 Revolution In the immediate aftermath of the February Revolution, Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki continued his military career and was appointed commander of the XXXVIIIth Corps on April 28, 1917 and made Lieutenant General on May 5, 1917. In the meantime, however, the Russian Provisional Government's obvious weakness, its half-hearted declaration of the right of nations to self-determination and Germany's promises of autonomy in occupied Poland stirred up long suppressed nationalist feelings among ethnic Poles living within the Russian Empire. Roughly 700,000 of them were serving in the Russian military by 1917 and they began forming a Polish army to fight for a \\"united and free Poland\\" with the assent of the Provisional Government. In August, the newly formed Main Polish Military Executive Committee appointed Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki Commissar of the Petrograd Military District and on August 23 (Old Style) he was appointed commander of the newly formed Polish 1st Corps in Russia. The reorganization process was complicated by the October Revolution of 1917, which brought Bolsheviks to power, but Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki was able to take advantage of the new government's weakness and general anarchy to form 3 divisions in Belarus by January 1918. Against the Bolsheviks (1918) Monument to Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki's men in Warsaw On , Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki refused an order by the Soviet government to disband the Corps, which quickly led to clashes with the newly formed Red Army and Red Latvian riflemen under Jukums VƒÅcietis. After sporadic fighting in late January, on January 31 Dowbor- Mu≈õnicki's Corps had to retreat to Bobruisk and Slutsk, where he was surrounded by German forces. After the temporary breakdown of the Brest- Litovsk peace negotiations on February 10, Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki joined the German offensive against the Bolsheviks on February 18 and took Minsk. After the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty, which gave all of Poland and Belarus to Germany, Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki's corps remained in Belarus for 3 months, regrouping and performing police duties under German occupation authorities. In May 1918, Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki was forced to sign an agreement with Germany that led to the disarmament and effective dissolution of the Corps by July 1918, at which point he moved to Poland. The agreement was criticized by some pro- independence Polish politicians, but it preserved the core of the Polish military, which proved decisive later that year. Against the Germans Part of monument of Polish insurgents of Greater Poland Uprising in Pozna≈Ñ After the armistice that ended World War I in November 1918, Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki helped organize a new Polish army around the disbanded 1st Corps and its officers. On January 6, 1919 he was nominated by the Supreme People's Council, the temporary ruling body of the province of Greater Poland, as the new commanding officer of all the Polish forces in the area. Two days later he arrived to Pozna≈Ñ and on January 16 he officially assumed his post, replacing Major Stanis≈Çaw Taczak during the Greater Poland Uprising against Germany in the disputed region. During his service as the commander in chief of the Uprising, Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki was responsible for almost complete reorganization of what was started as a para-military partisan force. He introduced conscription and mobilized eleven classes of recruits and reformed the partisans into divisions. During his command, the Greater Polish Army grew from merely 20,000 to over 100,000 soldiers, well-armed and well-equipped. After the Battle of ≈Åawica in which the Poles managed to capture the airfield, the Greater Polish Army was the fourth force in the world in number of aeroplanes available. Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki focused also on political matters and strived for political neutrality of the forces under his command, which made him demobilize some of the leftist and rightist officers. He also disbanded the leftist soldiers' councils. To some extent Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki was conflicted with the Polish General Staff. Due to difficult diplomatic situation of Poland during the early stages of the Paris Peace Conference, the forces of the Greater Poland Uprising were separated from the Polish Army and were thought of as a separate entity. Because of that, he opposed drafting Poles from Greater Poland into the Polish Army and sending them to the fronts of the Polish-Ukrainian War and the Polish-Bolshevik War. Instead, he envisioned an offensive towards north which would spread the Uprising to the lands of Pomerania. However, after the area was peacefully transferred to Poland, his plans were made obsolete. Despite the conflict, on March 19, 1919 he was promoted to the rank of Genera≈Ç broni, the highest rank of the Polish forces at that time. Finally, after the end of hostilities, on October 19, 1919 the Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki's forces were merged with J√≥zef Haller's Blue Army and the Polish Army while at the same time the lands of Greater Poland were officially incorporated into Poland. Retirement J√≥zef Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki remained the commander of the so-called Greater Poland Front until the outbreak of the Polish-Bolshevik War, after which he resigned his post and applied to J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski for a new assignment. After General Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki declined to take the post of the commanding officer of the Ukrainian Front from General Wac≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz, the post was offered to Dowbor-Mu≈õnicki, who refused. Having no further assignments, in March 1920 he resigned all his posts in the army and settled in Lusowo and then in Batorowo near Pozna≈Ñ. Opposing Pi≈Çsudski's Coup d'√âtat of 1926, he did not rejoin the army during the internal struggle. Instead, he focused on writing his memoirs, Moje wspomnienia (My Memoirs). He suffered a heart attack on October 26, 1937 and was buried at the local cemetery. Dowbor- Mu≈õnicki had two sons, Giedymin and Olgierd, and two daughters, Janina and Agnieszka. Olgierd committed suicide before World War II, Giedymin emigrated to France in the 1930s, while both daughters died during World War II. Agnieszka, who was an active member of the Polish resistance, was arrested by the German occupiers, tortured in the Pawiak prison in Warsaw and then executed in the Palmiry mass murder site, while Janina Lewandowska was the only woman murdered by the Soviet NKVD during the Katyn massacre.

Emerging during the early 1890s, Rothenstein continued to make art right up until his death in the mid-1940s. Though he covered many subjects ‚Äì ranging from landscapes in France to representations of Jewish synagogues in London ‚Äì he is perhaps best known for his work as a war artist in both world wars, his portraits, and his popular memoirs, written in the 1930s. More than two hundred of Rothenstein's portraits of famous people can be found in the National Portrait Gallery collection. The Tate Gallery also holds a large collection of his paintings, prints and drawings. Rothenstein served as Principal at the Royal College of Art from 1920 to 1935. He was knighted in 1931 for his services to art. In March 2015 'From Bradford to Benares: the Art of Sir William Rothenstein', the first major exhibition of Rothenstein's work for over forty years, opened at Bradford's Cartwright Hall Gallery, touring to the Ben Uri in London later that year. Personal life Sir William Rothenstein, photo by George Charles Beresford, 1902 William Rothenstein was born into a German-Jewish family in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire where he was educated at Bradford Grammar School. His father, Moritz, emigrated from Germany in 1859 to work in Bradford's burgeoning textile industry. Soon afterwards he married Bertha Dux and they had six children, of which William was the fifth. William's two brothers, Charles and Albert, were also heavily involved in the arts. Charles (1866‚Äì1927), who followed his father into the wool trade, was an important collector ‚Äì and left his entire collection to Manchester Art Gallery in 1925. Albert (1881‚Äì1953) was a painter, illustrator and costume designer. Both brothers changed their surname to Rutherston during the First World War. He married Alice Knewstub in 1899 with whom he had four children: John, Betty, Rachel and Michael. John Rothenstein later gained fame as an art historian and art administrator (he was Director of the Tate Gallery from 1938 to 1964 and was knighted in 1952).Edward Chaney, \\"The Vasari of British Art: Sir John Rothenstein... and the Importance of Wyndham Lewis\\", Apollo, vol. CXXXII, no. 345 (November 1990), pp. 322‚Äì26 Michael Rothenstein was a talented printmaker.Nicholas Usherwood, 'Rothenstein, (William) Michael Francis (1908‚Äì1993)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 January 2014 Education Rothenstein left Bradford Grammar School at the age of sixteen to study at the Slade School of Art, London (1888‚Äì93), where he was taught by Alphonse Legros, and the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris (1889‚Äì1893), where he met and was encouraged by James McNeill Whistler, Edgar Degas and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. While in Paris he also befriended the Anglo-Australian artist Charles Conder, with whom he shared a studio in Montmartre. Career=Artist Rothenstein's portrait drawing of Auguste Rodin Rothenstein's drawing of Aubrey Beardsley In 1893 Rothenstein returned to Britain to work on \\"Oxford Characters\\" a series of lithographic portraits, eventually published in 1896 Other portrait collections by the artist include English Portraits (1898), Twelve Portraits (1929) and Contemporaries (1937). In Oxford he met and became a close friend of the caricaturist and parodist Max Beerbohm, who later immortalised him in the short story Enoch Soames (1919). During the 1890s Rothenstein exhibited with the New English Art Club and contributed drawings to The Yellow Book and The Savoy. In 1898-9 he co-founded the Carfax Gallery (or Carfax & Co) in St. James' Piccadilly with John Fothergill (later innkeeper of the Spread Eagle in Thame). During its early years the gallery was closely associated with such artists as Charles Conder, Philip Wilson Steer, Charles Ricketts and Augustus John. It also exhibited the work of Auguste Rodin, whose growing reputation in England owed much to Rothenstein's friendship. Rothenstein's role as artistic manager of the gallery was abandoned in 1901, whereupon the firm came under the management of his close friend Robert Ross. Ross left in 1908, leaving the gallery in the hands of longtime financial manager Arthur Clifton. Under Clifton the gallery was the home for all three exhibitions of the Camden Town Group, led by Rothenstein's friend and close contemporary Walter Sickert. In 1900 Rothenstein won a silver medal for his painting The Doll's House at the Exposition Universelle.The Doll's House Tate Etc.. This painting continues to be one of his best-known and critically acclaimed works, and was the subject of a recent in-depth study published by the Tate Gallery.Samuel Shaw (ed.), In Focus: The Doll‚Äôs House 1899‚Äì1900 by William Rothenstein, Tate Research Publication, 2016, accessed 13 May 2016 The style and subject of Rothenstein's paintings varies, though certain themes reappear, in particular an interest in 'weighty' or 'essential' subjects tackled in a restrained manner. Good examples include Parting at Morning (1891), Mother and Child (1903) and Jews Mourning at a Synagogue (1907) ‚Äì all of which are owned by the Tate Gallery. Between 1902 and 1912 Rothenstein lived in Hampstead, London, where his social circle included such names as H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad and the artist Augustus John. Amongst the young artists to visit Rothenstein in Hampstead were Wyndham Lewis, Mark Gertler and Paul Nash. During this period Rothenstein worked on a series of important paintings in the predominantly Jewish East End of London, some of which were included in the influential 1906 exhibition of Jewish Art and Antiquaries at the Whitechapel Gallery. Another feature of this period are the celebrated interiors he painted, the most famous of which is The Browning Readers (1900), now owned by Cartwright Hall gallery, Bradford. Most of Rothenstein's interiors feature members of his family, especially his wife Alice. Reminiscent of Dutch painting (particularly Vermeer and Rembrandt), they are similar in style to contemporary works by William Orpen, who became Rothenstein's brother-in-law in 1901, marrying Alice's sister Grace.The Browning Readers (1900).

Rothenstein maintained a lifelong fascination for Indian sculpture and painting, and in 1910 set out on a seminal tour of the subcontinent's major artistic and religious sites. This began with a visit to the ancient Buddhist caves of Ajanta, where he observed Lady Christiana Herringham and Nandalal Bose making watercolour copies of the ancient frescoes. He subsequently contributed a chapter on their importance to the published edition. The trip ended with a stay in Calcutta, where he witnessed the attempts of Abanindranath Tagore to revive the techniques and aesthetics of traditional Indian painting.Rupert Richard Arrowsmith, \\"An Indian Renascence and the rise of global modernism: William Rothenstein in India, 1910‚Äì11\\", The Burlington Magazine, vol.152 no.1285 (April 2010), pp.228‚Äì235. He was a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. Royal College of Art Rothenstein was principal of the Royal College of Art from 1920 to 1935, where he encouraged figures including Edward Burra, Evelyn Dunbar, U Ba Nyan and Henry Moore. Moore was later to write that Rothenstein \\"gave me the feeling that there was no barrier, no limit to what a young provincial student could get to be and do\\".Alan Wilkinson, ed. \\"Henry Moore: Writings and Conversation\\" University of California Press, 2002. p.47 Rothenstein was a master of lobbying and advocacy for his students, notably when Edward Bawden and Eric Ravilious were commissioned to paint a mural in the dining room of Morley College thanks to his efforts. After being appointed, he introduced greater informality and was permitted to appoint practising artists, including Paul Nash and Edward Johnston as visiting lecturers. In due course, those students who built successful careers were invited back to the college to lecture. Writer Rothenstein wrote several critical books and pamphlets, including Goya (1900; the first English monograph on the artist), A Plea for a Wider Use of Artists & Craftsmen (1916) and Whither Painting (1932). During the 1930s he published three volumes of memoirs: Men and Memories, Vol I and II and Since Fifty. Men and Memories Volume I includes anecdotes about Oscar Wilde and many other friends of Rothenstein's, including Max Beerbohm, James Whistler, Paul Verlaine, Edgar Degas, and John Singer Sargent.Oscar Wilde Selected Letters, ed. Hart-Davis, R. Oxford, 1979, p105 Recognition Rothenstein was knighted in the New Year Honours in 1931.

A founding member of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage in 1907, he resigned from his job at The Daily News in 1909 when it supported the force-feeding of suffragettes on hunger strike. Early life The son of a Methodist preacher, he was born in Yorkshire and educated in Scotland, at the High School of Dundee. Career in journalism Brailsford abandoned an academic career to become a journalist, rising to prominence in the 1890s as a foreign correspondent for The Manchester Guardian, specialising in the Balkans, France and Egypt. In 1899 he moved to London, working for the Morning Leader and then The Daily News. He led a British relief mission to Macedonia in 1903, publishing a book, Macedonia: Its Races and Their Future, on his return. In 1905 he was convicted of conspiring to obtain a British passport in the name of one person for another person to travel to Russia.Brailsford's appeal is reported in the Law Reports of the Court of Kings Bench as R v Brailsford [1905] 2 KB 730 The Men's League for Women's Suffrage was formed in 1907 in London by Brailsford, Charles Corbett, Henry Nevinson, Laurence Housman, C. E. M. Joad, Hugh Franklin, Henry Harben, Gerald Gould, Charles Mansell-Moullin, Israel Zangwill and 32 others. Brailsford joined the Independent Labour Party in 1907 and resigned from the Daily News in 1909 when it supported force- feeding of suffragette prisoners. He co-authored with Dr Jessie Murray, a psychologist and suffragette, a report The Treatment of Women's Deputations by the Metropolitan Police,Elizabeth R. Valentine, \\"'A brilliant and many-sided personality': Jessie Margaret Murray, founder of the Medico-Psychological Clinic\\", Journal of the history of the behavioral sciences, 45:2 145‚Äì161, 2009, . over the violence of the Metropolitan Police during the Black Friday demonstration (18 November 1910).Murray, J. & Brailsford, H.N., The Treatment of Women's deputations by the Metropolitan Police, London: The Women's Press, 1911. Over the next decade he wrote several books, among them Adventures in Prose (1911), Shelley, Godwin and their Circle (1913), War of Steel and Gold (1914), Origins of the Great War (1914), Belgium and the Scrap of Paper (1915) and A League of Nations (1917). In 1913‚Äì14 Brailsford was a member of the international commission sent by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to investigate the conduct of the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13. He co-authored its report. He was a prominent member of the Union of Democratic Control during the First World War and stood unsuccessfully as a Labour Party candidate in the 1918 general election. He subsequently toured central Europe and his graphic accounts of life in the defeated countries appeared in his books Across the Blockade (1919) and After the Peace (1920). Brailsford went to Soviet Russia in 1920 and again to the USSR in 1926, publishing two books on the subject. He was editor of the New Leader, the ILP newspaper, from 1922 to 1926. He left the ILP in 1932 and through the 1930s was a regular contributor to Reynold's News and the New Statesman. Brailsford was an outspoken critic of Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany.Keith Hodgson, Fighting Fascism: the British Left and the Rise of Fascism, 1919‚Äì39 Manchester University Press, 2011. , (pp. 59‚Äì60). His books in the 1930s include the anti-colonialist classic Rebel India (1931) and the anti-militarist Property or Peace? (1934). In the late 1930s, he was one of the few writers associated with the Left Book Club, the New Statesman and Tribune who was consistently critical of the Soviet show trials.Frederick Charles Barghoorn, The Soviet Cultural Offensive: the role of cultural diplomacy in Soviet foreign policy. Princeton University Press, 1960 (p. 37). Following the Soviet invasion of Finland, Brailsford published a hostile essay about Stalin in Reynold's News : > Stalin ... has compelled us to pass the judgement we had hitherto refused to > register. His Russia is a totalitarian state, like another, as brutal > towards the rights of others, as careless of its plighted word. If this man > ever understood the international creed of socialism, he long ago forgot it. > In this land the absolute power has wrought its customary effects of > corruption.F. M. Leventhal, The Last Dissenter: H.N. Brailsford and His > World, by F. M. Leventhal. Oxford University Press, 1985. (p. 269). During the Second World War, Brailsford penned a weekly column in the left- wing Reynold's News. He also continued to write books, the most important being Subject India (1943) and Our Settlement with Germany (1944). After his retirement from journalism in 1946, he wrote a history of the Levellers, which was unfinished at the time of his death. Paul Foot described Brailsford as \\"perhaps the best socialist writer in Britain at the time\\".Paul Foot, \\"New Statesman, Decline and Fall\\", Socialist Review October 1996. Personal life He married a former student, the women's activist Jane Esdon Malloch in 1898 at his insistence. She denied him children and regarded the marriage as demeaning. They separated but she refused him a divorce.F. M. Leventhal, ‚ÄòBrailsford , Jane Esdon (1874‚Äì1937)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 10 Nov 2017 In 1928 he met the artist Clare Leighton and they lived together for several years. His wife died in 1937 after years of drinking, and whereas this removed any legal obstacle to the couple being married, Brailsford, consumed by guilt, suffered an emotional breakdown, effectively destroying his relationship with Leighton who left for the US in 1939. In 1944 he married Evamaria Perlmann, a refugee from Germany, 40 years his junior.

The graduated staff is leaning on the pile of sand. In surveying and construction, the laser level is a control tool consisting of a rotating laser beam projector that can be affixed to a tripod. The tool is leveled according to the accuracy of the device and projects a fixed red or green beam in a plane about the horizontal and/or vertical axis. Development The concept of a laser level has been around since at least the early 1970s, the original spinning-mirror design laser plane and line level was patented by the late 1980s, and the compact lens-based laser line level (as produced by many tool manufacturers today) was patented in the late 1990s. Rotary laser level A rotary laser level is a more advanced laser level in that it spins the beam of light fast enough to give the effect of a complete 360 degree horizontal or vertical plane, thus illuminating not just a fixed line, but a horizontal plane. The laser beam projector employs a rotating head with a mirror for sweeping the laser beam about a vertical axis. If the mirror is not self- leveling, it is provided with visually readable level vials and manually adjustable screws for orienting the projector. A staff carried by the operator is equipped with a movable sensor, which can detect the laser beam and gives a signal when the sensor is in line with the beam (usually an audible beep). The position of the sensor on the graduated staff, also known as a grade rod, or story pole, allows comparison of elevations between different points on the terrain. Most laser levels are used in the construction industry.  Tower- mounted laser level  A tower-mounted laser level is used in combination with a sensor on a wheel tractor-scraper in the process of land laser leveling to bring land (for example, an agricultural field) to near-flatness with a slight grade for drainage.

Varotsos, K. Alexopoulos and K. Nomicos, authors of the 1981 papers describing it ‚Äì measures low frequency electric signals, termed \\"seismic electric signals\\" (SES), by which Varotsos and several colleagues claimed to have successfully predicted earthquakes in Greece. (preface to a special edition about VAN) Both the method itself and the manner by which successful predictions were claimed have been severely criticized. Supporters of VAN have responded to the criticism but the critics have not retracted their views. (proceedings of a conference that reviewed VAN)twenty articles in a special issue of Geophysical Research Letters (table of contents) Since 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call \\"natural time\\", applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from noise and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \\"SES activity\\"), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a critical phenomenon.; ... After 2006, VAN say that all alarms related to SES activity have been made public by posting at arxiv.org. One such report was posted on Feb. 1, 2008, two weeks before the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983-2011. This earthquake occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9. VAN's report was also described in an article in the newspaper Ethnos on Feb. 10, 2008.. However, Gerassimos Papadopolous complained that the VAN reports were confusing and ambiguous, and that \\"none of the claims for successful VAN predictions is justified\\", but this complaint was answered on the same issue  Description of the VAN method  Prediction of earthquakes with this method is based on the detection, recording and evaluation of seismic electric signals or SES. These electrical signals have a fundamental frequency component of 1 Hz or less and an amplitude the logarithm of which scales with the magnitude of the earthquake.; ; . According to VAN proponents, SES are emitted by rocks under stresses caused by plate-tectonic forces. There are three types of reported electric signal: *Electric signals that occur shortly before a major earthquake. Signals of this type were recorded 6.5 hours before the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan, for example.. *Electric signals that occur some time before a major earthquake. *A gradual variation in the Earth's electric field some time before an earthquake. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain SES: *Stress-related phenomena: Seismic electric signals are perhaps attributed to the piezoelectric behaviour of some minerals, especially quartz, or to effects related to the behavior of crystallographic defects under stress or strain. Series of SES, termed SES activities (which are recorded before major earthquakes), may appear a few weeks to a few months before an earthquake when the mechanical stress reaches a critical value.. The generation of electric signals by minerals under high stress leading to fracture has been confirmed with laboratory experiments. *Thermoelectric phenomena: Alternately, Chinese researchers proposed a mechanism which relies on the thermoelectric effect in magnetite.. *Groundwater phenomena: Three mechanisms have been proposed relying on the presence of groundwater in generating SES. The electrokinetic effect is associated with the motion of groundwater during a change in pore pressure.. The seismic dynamo effect is associated with the motion of ions in groundwater relative to the geomagnetic field as a seismic wave creates displacement. Circular polarization would be characteristic of the seismic dynamo effect, and this has been observed both for artificial and natural seismic events.. A radon ionization effect, caused by radon release and then subsequent ionization of material in groundwater, may also be active. The main isotope of radon is radioactive with a half-life of 3.9 days, and the nuclear decay of radon is known to have an ionizing effect on air. Many publications have reported increased radon concentration in the vicinity of some active tectonic faults a few weeks prior to strong seismic events.. However, a strong correlation between radon anomalies and seismic events has not been demonstrated.. While the electrokinetic effect may be consistent with signal detection tens or hundreds of kilometers away, the other mechanisms require a second mechanism to account for propagation: *Signal transmission along faults: In one model, seismic electric signals propagate with relatively low attenuation along tectonic faults, due to the increased electrical conductivity caused either by the intrusion of ground water into the fault zone(s) or by the ionic characteristics of the minerals.. *Rock circuit: In the defect model, the presence of charge carriers and holes can be modeled as making an extensive circuit.. Seismic electric signals are detected at stations which consist of pairs of electrodes (oriented NS and EW) inserted into the ground, with amplifiers and filters. The signals are then transmitted to the VAN scientists in Athens where they are recorded and evaluated. Currently the VAN team operates 9 stations, while in the past (until 1989) they could afford up to 17. The VAN team claimed that they were able to predict earthquakes of magnitude larger than 5, with an uncertainty of 0.7 units of magnitude, within a radius of 100 km, and in time window ranging from several hours to a few weeks. Several papers confirmed this success rate, leading to statistically significant conclusion. For example, there were eight M ‚â• 5.5 earthquakes in Greece from January 1, 1984 through September 10, 1995, and the VAN network forecast six of these. The VAN method has also been used in Japan, but in early attempts success comparable to that achieved in Greece was \\"difficult\\" to attain. A preliminary investigation of seismic electric signals in France led to encouraging results.  Earthquake prediction using \\"natural time\\" analysis  Since 2001 the VAN team has attempted to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of the forthcoming earthquake. To that end, they introduced the concept of natural time, a time series analysis technique which puts weight on a process based on the ordering of events.; . Two terms characterize each event, the \\"natural time\\" , and the energy . is defined as , where k is an integer (the -th event) and is the total number of events in the time sequence of data. A related term, , is the ratio , which describes the fractional energy released. They introduce a critical term , the \\"variance in natural time\\", which puts extra weight on the energy term : :\\\\kappa=\\\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\\\chi_k)^2 - \\\\bigl(\\\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\\\chi_k\\\\bigr)^2 :where \\\\textstyle\\\\chi_k=k/N and \\\\textstyle\\\\ p_k=\\\\frac{Q_k}{\\\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n} Their current method deems SES valid when = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a Venn diagram with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When the distribution of for the rectangular regions has its maximum at = 0.070, a critical seismic event is imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so, and a report is issued., Chapter 7.  Results  The VAN team claim that out of seven mainshocks with magnitude Mw>=6.0 from 2001 through 2010 in the region of latitude N 36¬∞ to N 41¬∞ and longitude E 19¬∞ to E 27¬∞, all but one could be classified with relevant SES activity identified and reported in advance through natural time analysis. Additionally, they assert that the occurrence time of four of these mainshocks with magnitude Mw>=6.4 were identified to within \\"a narrow range, a few days to around one week or so.\\" These reports are inserted in papers housed in arXiv, and new reports are made and uploaded there. For example, a report preceding the strongest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983-2011, which occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude (Mw) 6.9, was publicized in arXiv almost two weeks before, on February 1, 2008. A description of the updated VAN method was collected in a book published by Springer in 2011, titled \\"Natural Time Analysis: The New View of Time.\\" Natural time analysis also claims that the physical connection of SES activities with earthquakes is as follows: Taking the view that the earthquake occurrence is a phase-change (critical phenomenon), where the new phase is the mainshock occurrence, the above- mentioned variance term Œ∫ is the corresponding order parameter. The Œ∫ value calculated for a window comprising a number of seismic events comparable to the average number of earthquakes occurring within a few months, fluctuates when the window is sliding through a seismic catalogue. The VAN team claims that these Œ∫ fluctuations exhibit a minimum a few months before a mainshock occurrence and in addition this minimum occurs simultaneously with the initiation of the corresponding SES activity, and that this is the first time in the literature that such a simultaneous appearance of two precursory phenomena in independent datasets of different geophysical observables (electrical measurements, seismicity) has been observed. Furthermore, the VAN team claims that their natural time analysis of the seismic catalogue of Japan during the period from January 1, 1984 until the occurrence of the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake on March 11, 2011, revealed that such clear minima of the Œ∫ fluctuations appeared before all major earthquakes with magnitude 7.6 or larger. The deepest of these minima was said to occur on January 5, 2011, i.e., almost two months before the Tohoku earthquake occurrence. Finally, by dividing the Japanese region into small areas, the VAN team states that some small areas show minimum of the Œ∫ fluctuations almost simultaneously with the large area covering the whole Japan and such small areas clustered within a few hundred kilometers from the actual epicenter of the impending major earthquake.  Criticisms of VAN  Historically, the usefulness of the VAN method for prediction of earthquakes had been a matter of debate. Both positive and negative criticism on an older conception of the VAN method is summarized in the 1996 book \\"A Critical Review of VAN\\", edited by Sir James Lighthill.. A critical review of the statistical methodology was published by Y. Y. Kagan of UCLA in 1997.. Note that these criticisms predate the time series analysis methods introduced by the VAN group in 2001. The main points of the criticism were:  Predictive success  Critics say that the VAN method is hindered by a lack of statistical testing of the validity of the hypothesis because the researchers keep changing the parameters (the moving the goalposts) technique).; ; . VAN has claimed to have observed at a recording station in Athens a perfect record of a one-to-one correlation between SESs and earthquake of magnitude ‚â• 2.9 which occurred 7 hours later in all of Greece.. However, Max Wyss said that the list of earthquake used for the correlation was false. Although VAN stated in their article that the list of earthquakes was that of the Bulletin of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA), Wyss found that 37% of the earthquakes actually listed in the bulletin, including the largest one, were not in the list used by VAN for issuing their claim. In addition, 40% of the earthquake which VAN claimed had occurred were not in the NOA bulletin.. Examining the probability of chance correlation of another set of 22 claims of successful predictions by VAN of M > 4.0 from January 1, 1987 through November 30, 1989 . it was found that 74% were false, 9% correlated by chance, and for 14% the correlation was uncertain. No single event correlated at a probability greater than 85%, whereas the level required in statistics for accepting a hypothesis test as positive would more commonly be 95%.. In response to Wyss' analysis of the NOA findings, VAN said that the criticisms were based on misunderstandings. VAN said that the calculations suggested by Wyss would lead to a paradox, i.e., to probability values larger than unity, when applied to an ideal earthquake prediction method. Other independent evaluations said that VAN obtained statistically significant results. Mainstream seismologists remain unconvinced by any of VAN's rebuttals. In 2011 the ICEF concluded that the optimistic prediction capability claimed by VAN could not be validated.. Most seismologists consider VAN to have been \\"resoundingly debunked\\". Uyeda and others in 2011, however, supported the use of the technique. In 2018, the statistical significance of the method was revisited by the VAN group employing modern techniques, such as event coincidence analysis (ECA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC), which they interpreted to show that SES exhibit precursory information far beyond chance.  Proposed SES propagation mechanism  An analysis of the propagation properties of SES in the Earth‚Äôs crust showed that it is impossible that signals with the amplitude reported by VAN could have been generated by small earthquakes and transmitted over the several hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station.; . In effect, if the mechanism is based on piezoelectricity or electrical charging of crystal deformations with the signal traveling along faults, then none of the earthquakes which VAN claimed were preceded by SES generated an SES themselves. VAN answered that such an analysis of the SES propagation properties is based on a simplified model of horizontally layered Earth and that this differs greatly from the real situation since Earth's crust contains inhomogeneities. When the latter are taken into account, for example by considering that the faults are electrically appreciably more conductive than the surrounding medium, VAN believes that electric signals transmitted at distances of the order of one hundred kilometers between the epicenter and the receiving station have amplitudes comparable to those reported by VAN.  Electromagnetic compatibility issues  VAN‚Äôs publications are further weakened by failure to address the problem of eliminating the many and strong sources of change in the magneto-electric field measured by them, such as telluric currents from weather, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) from man-made signals. One critical paper (Pham et al 1998) clearly correlates an SES used by the VAN group with digital radio transmissions made from a military base.. In a subsequent paper, VAN said that such noise coming from digital radio transmitters of the military database has been clearly distinguished from true SES by following the criteria developed by VAN. Further work in Greece by Pham et al in 2002 has tracked SES-like \\"anomalous transient electric signals\\" back to specific human sources, and found that such signals are not excluded by the criteria used by VAN to identify SES.. In 2003, modern methods of statistical physics, i.e., detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), multifractal DFA and wavelet transform revealed that SES are clearly distinguished from those produced by human sources, since the former signals exhibit very strong long range correlations, while the latter signals do not. A work published in 2020 examined the statistical significance of the minima of the fluctuations of the order parameter Œ∫1 of seismicity by event coincidence analysis as a possible precursor to strong earthquakes in both regional and global level. The results show that these minima are indeed statistically significant earthquake precursors. In particular, in the regional studies the time lag was found to be fully compatible with the finding that these mimima are simultaneous with the initiation of SES activities, thus the distinction of the latter precursory signals from those produced by human sources is evident.  Public policy  Finally, one requirement for any earthquake prediction method is that, in order for any prediction to be useful, it must predict a forthcoming earthquake within a reasonable time-frame, epicenter and magnitude. If the prediction is too vague, no feasible decision (such as to evacuate the population of a certain area for a given period of time) can be made. In practice, the VAN group issued a series of telegrams in the 1980s. During the same time frame, the technique also missed major earthquakes, in the sense that \\"for earthquakes with Mb‚â•5.0, the ratio of the predicted to the total number of earthquakes is 6/12 (50%) and the success rate of the prediction is also 6/12 (50%) with the probability gain of a factor of 4. With a confidence level of 99.8%, the possibility of this success rate being explained by a random model of earthquake occurrence taking into account the regional factor which includes high seismicity in the prediction area, can be rejected\\". This study concludes that \\"the statistical examination of the SES predictions proved high rates of success prediction and predicted events with high probability gain. This suggests a physical connection between SES and subsequent earthquakes, at least for an event of magnitude of Ms‚â•5\\". Predictions from the early VAN method led to public criticism and the cost associated with false alarms generated ill will., p. 318. Major opponents of VAN were the Greek seismologists Vassilis Papazachos and G. Stavrakakis. The debate between Papazachos and the VAN team has repeatedly caused public attention in their home country Greece and has been extensively discussed in the Greek media.

High school Dellucci graduated from Catholic High in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1991. He earned the team's Most Valuable Player honors in both baseball and football, and All-State honors for baseball. He was also awarded the Catholic High Man of the Year award as a senior in 1991. During the winter of 2001, he was inducted into the Catholic High School Hall of Fame as a Grizzly Great. College Dellucci played four seasons at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), where he was an All- Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection in both 1994 and 1995 and earned All- American status in 1995, setting 10 school records and winning the SEC batting title in hitting. He was named Athlete of the Year at Ole Miss in 1995. Dellucci was elected into the Ole Miss \\"M Club\\" Athletic Hall of Fame in 2010 and was named as one of the 50 Greatest Athletes in Ole Miss history. Career In spite of playing well and racking up solid statistics as a college player, Dellucci was viewed by MLB Central Scouting as a utility outfielder when compared to the thick talent pool of other players in the '95 draft. As a result, he did not rate a high pick, and he went in the 10th round and was eventually selected by the Baltimore Orioles in that year's First-Year Player Draft. In 1997, Dellucci recorded his first Major League hit off of Tom Gordon, which hit off of the Green Monster in Fenway Park. He hit his first major league home run on June 25 in a road game against Cal Eldred of the Brewers. While playing in the Arizona Fall league for the Phoenix Desert Dogs he was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 1998 MLB Expansion Draft. He played for Arizona from the team's inaugural season in 1998 to 2003. He played on the World Series-winning squad in 2001. However, in 1998, as a rookie, and as he found his rhythm in major league baseball, he led the National League in triples. While hitting .394 in June, 1999 he was diagnosed with a degenerative bone in his left wrist called Keinboks disease. In honor of Dellucci, the each Diamondback player and coach displayed his number on the side of their caps. Initially the injury was diagnosed to be career ending but he after a successful reconstructive surgery and extensive rehabilitation, he returned to make the team out of spring training in 2000. During the 2001 season, Dellucci hit 10 home runs in 217 at bats with 6 of the home runs coming as a utility player and pinch hitter. Just before the trade deadline in the 2003 season, Dellucci was traded to the New York Yankees, along with pitcher Bret Prinz and catcher John Sprowl, in exchange for outfielder Ra√∫l Mondes√≠. He finished the 2003 season as a member of the American League Champion Yankees and appeared in the World Series against the Florida Marlins. In 2004, Dellucci signed with the Texas Rangers as a free agent. In 331 at bats, Dellucci hit 17 home runs along with 61 RBI. During the Rangers playoff run, Dellucci hit a game winning double to beat the Oakland A's and keep the Rangers in playoff hopes alive. It has been described as one of the most memorable plays in Texas Rangers history. In 2005, Dellucci had one of his best years as a professional. He recorded a season high in total at bats (435), along with homers (29) and RBIs (65). He is tied for second in Ranger history with 4 lead off home runs. In spring training of , Dellucci was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for pitcher Robinson Tejeda and Minor League outfielder Jake Blalock. Until the trade of Bobby Abreau, Dellucci was used mostly as a pinch hitter/reserve outfielder but still hit .292 with 13 home runs in 264 at bats. Dellucci signed with the Cleveland Indians on December 6, 2006. On June 19, 2007, while running to first base, Dellucci severely tore his left hamstring tendon off the bone just under his left knee. He missed time early in Spring training 2009 due to a surgically repaired thumb after smashing it in the tailgate of his trailer. Dellucci started the 2009 season on the disabled list with a strained left calf. While hitting .275 in 40 at bats, he was designated for assignment by the Indians on May 29, 2009, and after clearing waivers, was released on June 1. On June 10, 2009, Dellucci agreed to terms on a minor league contract with the Blue Jays. He did well (.317 BA) at their AAA affiliate, the Las Vegas 51's of the Pacific Coast League. This led to the Blue Jays purchasing Dellucci's contract, on July 3. After a brief stint with the big league club in Toronto, he was designated for assignment, on July 24, 2009 due to poor play. Electing not to accept his designation he was released on July 31, 2009 by the Las Vegas 51s, the Triple-A affiliate of the Blue Jays. Dellucci did not return to playing, and chose to retire. Career After Baseball Dellucci is a color commentator for Sports South, ESPN3, Atlantic Sun TV and CST. He is also on the National Wildlife Federation's Vanishing Paradise advisory board. In 2011, Dellucci was inducted into the Louisiana American Italian Hall of Fame. Charity Dellucci has worked with several charities such as Easter Seals, Special Olympics, Children with AIDS foundation and Make a Wish foundation. He is also on the Board of Directors for the Miracle League of Baton Rouge. In 2005 after hurricanes Katrina and Rita he formed his own charity called Catch22forblue in which he raised and personally distributed money for individuals, groups and schools which were affected by the tragedy along from Southeast Texas to Gulfport, Mississippi.

Early life Born in Elmwood Park, Illinois,Gruver, 2002 pg. 20 Nitschke was the youngest of three sons to Robert and Anna Nitschke. His father was killed in a car accident in 1940,Gruver, 2002 pg. 21 and his mother died of a blood clot when Ray was 13. Older brothers Robert Jr. (age 21) and Richard (age 17) decided they would raise Ray on their own.Gruver, 2002 pg. 25 Proviso High School Nitschke entered Proviso High School in Maywood shortly before his mother's death. The loss of both parents enraged Nitschke, and the lack of a parental disciplinarian to quell his rage caused him to engage in fights with other kids in the neighborhood. During his freshman year at Proviso, he played fullback on one of the school's three football teams. He was a poor student and his grades eventually caught up with him as he was declared academically ineligible to play sports his sophomore year. He would lament this embarrassment for the rest of his life.Gruver, 2002 pg. 29 He succeeded in raising his grades sufficiently enough in his sophomore year to allow him to play sports his junior year, when he had grown significantly (to six feet tall). He starred on the varsity football team, playing quarterback on offense and safety on defense for coach Andy Puplis. He played varsity basketball and was a pitcher and left fielder for the varsity baseball team. His baseball skills brought him an offer from the professional St. Louis Browns with a $3,000 signing bonus.Gruver, 2002 pg. 37 Nitschke was also offered scholarships from college football programs around the country. Puplis advised him to accept a football scholarship. Due to his desire to play at a Big Ten university, with a chance to play in the Rose Bowl, he accepted a football scholarship to the University of Illinois in 1954. University of Illinois While at Illinois, Nitschke smoked, drank heavily, and fought at the drop of a hat. Never a good student in high school, his grades suffered at college. In his sophomore year in 1955, due to a depletion of players in the offensive backfield, Illini head coach Ray Eliot moved Nitschke from quarterback to fullback,Gruver, 2002 pg. 44 shattering his childhood dream of quarterbacking a team to a victory in the Rose Bowl. At this time, college football had reverted to primarily single-platoon football, meaning those players that were on offense had to switch to defense, and vice versa, when ball possession changed. On defense, Nitschke played linebacker. He proved to be a very skilled player and tackler as a linebacker, so much so that, by his senior year, Paul Brown considered him the best linebacker in college football.Gruver, 2002 pg. 62 In his junior year in 1956 against Ohio State, Nitschke lost his four front teeth on the opening kick-off. Nitschke never wore a face mask and one of the Buckeye's player's helmets hit him in the mouth knocking out two teeth initially; the other two were hanging by the roots. He played the rest of the game.http://www.jsonline.com/sports/packers/40250287.html NFL career Growing up in the outskirts of Chicago, Nitschke had idolized the Bears and he hoped to be chosen by them in the 1958 NFL Draft, held on December 2, 1957. However, he was chosen by the Green Bay Packers late in the third round (36th overall) of what is considered the greatest draft in the franchise's history.Gruver, 2002 pg. 54 It included three other significant Packers of the 1960s, linebacker Dan Currie of Michigan State (3rd overall), fullback Jim Taylor of LSU (15th overall) and right guard Jerry Kramer of Idaho (39th overall). Their rookie season in 1958 under first-year head coach Ray \\"Scooter\\" McLean was dismal, with just one win and one tie for the worst record in the 12-team league. Nitschke wore number 33 in 1958 and 66 the rest of his career with the Packers. A month after the 1958 season ended, Vince Lombardi was hired as head coach. Nitschke became a full-time starter in 1962, the anchor of a disciplined defense that helped win five NFL titles and the first two Super Bowls in the 1960s. He was the MVP of the 1962 NFL Championship Game, accepting the prize of a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette. In the game, Nitschke recovered two fumbles and deflected a pass that was intercepted. The Packers won and finished the season with a In Super Bowl I, Nitschke contributed six tackles and a sack. In Super Bowl II, Nitschke led Green Bay's defense with nine tackles. At the end of the 1972 season, the Packers traveled to New Orleans to play the Saints on December 17 at Tulane Stadium, which turned out to be Nitschke's last regular season game. He recorded the only pass reception of his career, a 34-yard gain after a blocked Packer field goal attempt, and they won to finish , their best regular season record Green Bay had clinched the NFC Central division title the week before at Minnesota for their first playoff berth in In the divisional round of the playoffs on Christmas Eve, Green Bay lost Nitschke returned for a 16th training camp in 1973, then retired in Nitschke was known for his strength and toughness, exhibited prior to his third season in 1960. On the Packers' practice field on September 1, a steel coaching tower was blown over by a strong gust of wind, on top (It was errantly first reported as Lombardi ran over to see what had happened, but when told it had fallen on Nitschke, said, \\"He'll be fine. Get back to work!\\" According to Nitschke's biography, a spike was driven into his helmet, but did not injure him. The helmet (with the hole) is currently on display in the Packer Hall of Fame in Green Bay. Although Nitschke was known for his hard hitting, he was an athletic all-around linebacker who also intercepted 25 passes over his career. Personal life Nitschke was married on June 26, 1961 to Jackie Forchette.Gruver, 2002 pg. 103-105 Jackie was unable to have children, so they adopted three: John in 1963, Richard in 1966, and Amy in 1972. Ray and Jackie had a winter home in Naples, Florida. Lombardi gave partial credit to Nitschke's success to Nitschke's wife, whose calming influence helped him focus on his career. Nitschke remained popular in Green Bay after retiring, even having his phone number and home address published in the Green Bay phone book. In the late 1980s, Nitschke owned an automobile dealership in Green Bay. He performed several of his own TV commercials in which he brought out his dog, \\"Butkus\\", named in honor of his Chicago Bears nemesis, Dick Butkus (who like Nitschke, grew up in the Chicago area and played for the Illinois Fighting Illini). He appeared in the comic film Head, starring The Monkees, as a footballer who repeatedly tackles Peter Tork in a mock war movie sequence. His character is listed in the credits as \\"Private One\\" because his jersey is emblazoned with the number \\"1\\". Nitschke also appeared in the 1974 football comedy The Longest Yard as Guard Bogdanski. Nitschke died of a heart attack in Venice, Florida at the age of 61 in 1998. He had been driving to the home of a family friend, according to his daughter, Amy Klaas, who was with him when he was stricken. He was pronounced dead at Venice Hospital. Honors Nitschke's number was retired by the Packers in 1983 His No. 66 was retired in 1983, the fourth of six numbers retired by the Packers.http://www.packers.com/team/players/nitschke_ray/ The only other Lombardi-era player to have his number retired is quarterback Bart Starr, whose #15 was retired in 1973. Also, the team has named one of its two outdoor practice fields \\"Ray Nitschke Field\\". In 1969, he was awarded as the NFL's all-time top Linebacker by the NFL in honor of the NFL's 50th Anniversary. Thus he is the only linebacker to have made both the NFL's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978. Every year, the Pro Football Hall of Fame has a luncheon the day before its induction ceremony, attended by most of the living members and honoring the new inductees. Nitschke always spoke at this luncheon, telling the new inductees what a great honor they were receiving, and that they were now members of the greatest team of them all. Following his death, the Hall named the luncheon after him. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1981. Upon the election of former teammate Henry Jordan to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on the eve of Super Bowl XXIX in Miami Gardens, Florida, Nitschke flew down to Florida to participate in the game's coin-toss ceremonies, joining three other 75th Anniversary Team representatives--Otto Graham (1950s), Mean Joe Greene (1970s) and Gale Sayers (1960s), all three of whom had been announced as representatives of their respective decades in the ceremony months prior to the PFHOF election‚Äîas well as three of Jordan's fellow Class of 1995 newcomers, all of whom represented the 1980s: Kellen Winslow, Lee Roy Selmon, and then-U.S. Congressman Steve Largent, who ended the pregame ceremonies by flipping the coin. In 1999, he was ranked number 18 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, making him the highest-ranked player coached by Vince Lombardi, second among Packers behind Don Hutson, and third among linebackers behind Lawrence Taylor and Dick Butkus.

It is contiguous with the adjacent Cafeteria New Beach and Cafeteria Old Beach. Golden Beach is the largest public beach in Tuen Mun with a total area of 78,500 m¬≤ and a length of 545 metres. The water quality is usually classified as Grade 2 (Fair). Tropical trees, like coconut, and flowers of various species are planted on both sides of a 480-metre long promenade running parallel to the beach. Refreshment kiosks, a hotel, and a shopping centre are located adjacent to the beach. Golden Beach is unique amongst the beaches of Hong Kong in that it has a volleyball court. The Hong Kong beach volleyball team occasionally practises on Golden Beach. History Golden Beach was one of the first artificial beaches constructed in Hong Kong, following the private beach at Tai Pak in Discovery Bay. It was built in 1994 using about 74,000 square metres of sand. It opened to the public in 1995, originally under the management of the Regional Council. In 2000, management of the beach was transferred to the newly formed Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD). Features Dolphin Square, near the beach * Changing rooms and showers * Dolphin Square * Restaurant * Seaside promenade * Toilets * Tuck shop Patronage Golden Beach is the busiest of the six gazetted beaches in Tuen Mun District. In 2016, according to the LCSD, it had an average attendance of 1,941 on weekdays, 4,438 on weekends and holidays, and 670,350 during the bathing season. This makes it one of the most well-attended beaches in Hong Kong, behind only Repulse Bay, Shek O, and Clear Water Bay Second beaches. Environmental issues=Marine refuse Like many other beaches in Hong Kong, Golden Beach suffers from a worsening problem with marine refuse. On occasion, vast amounts of garbage suddenly wash up on the beach. The rubbish often bears Simplified Chinese characters, leading citizens to suspect that it originates from Mainland Chinese ships. On 1 August 2017, more than 18 lorry- loads worth of rubbish washed up on the beach in one 24-hour period. Sand loss A submerged lifeguard tower is visible at right, illustrating the sand loss problem. The beach suffers from serious loss of sand, and has shrunk significantly over the past two decades. The bases of several lookout towers, which were once set well back from the water line, are now exposed to the sea. In April 1999, the beach was replenished with about 7,900 square metres of sand. The Civil Engineering and Development Department (CEDD) and Halcrow Group analysed aerial imagery taken from 2001 to 2008 and found that Golden Beach eroded by up to two metres per year, affecting its recreational value. The study found that the high rate of sand loss is driven by the fact that Golden Beach is situated oblique to the prevailing wave direction. This has caused sand to migrate north, in an anti-clockwise direction, such that the southern end of the beach has completely eroded. The LCSD had to close part of the beach in 2008 as the problem worsened. After Typhoon Hagupit hit Hong Kong, the LCSD hired the CEDD to conduct remedial works at Golden Beach, at a cost of HK$7.2 million. This included replenishment of sand, construction of gabion walls, and construction of groynes. These improvements were made from 2009 to 2011. Still, Golden Beach is smaller than its original size and length. Water quality The Environmental Protection Department conducts water quality testing at Golden Beach at least three times per month, year- round. The department uses a four-point grading system to reflect water quality, where Grade 1 (Good) reflects the best quality. During the 1990s, the water quality at Golden Beach consistently ranked as Grade 3 (Poor). Various sewerage infrastructure improvements have helped boost the quality to an average of Grade 2 (Fair) since the turn of the millennium. During the 2016 swimming season, the water quality ranked Grade 2 (Fair) for about 85 per cent of tests, and Grade 1 (Good) about 15 per cent of the time. Transport Golden Beach is served by numerous bus routes. ; Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) * 52X (Tuen Mun Central Bus Terminus ‚Üî Mongkok) * 53 (Yuen Long ‚Üî Tsuen Wan) * 61M (Tuen Mun Central Bus Terminus ‚Üî Kwai Fong) ; Citybus * 962/N962 (Lung Mun Oasis ‚Üî Causeway Bay) * 962B (Chi Lok Fa Yuen ‚Üî Admiralty) * 962S (Chi Lok Fa Yuen ‚Üî Causeway Bay) ; MTR Bus * K51 (Fu Tai ‚Üî Tai Lam) * K53 (Tuen Mun Station ‚Ü∫ So Kwun Wat).

Description Iceland Moss It is often of a pale chestnut color, but varies considerably, being sometimes almost entirely greyish-white; and grows to a height of from 3 to 4 in., the branches being channelled or rolled into tubes, which end in flattened lobes with fringed edges. Range It grows abundantly in the mountainous regions of northern countries, and it is specially characteristic of the lava slopes and plains of the west and north of Iceland. It is found on the mountains of north Wales, northern England, Scotland and south-west Ireland. In North America its range extends through Arctic regions, from Alaska to Newfoundland, and south in the Rocky Mountains to Colorado, and to the Appalachian Mountains of New England. Composition Chemical structure of lichenin. In commerce it is a light-grey harsh cartilaginous body, almost colorless, and tastes slightly bitter. It contains about 70% of lichenin or lichen-starch, a body isomeric with common starch, but without structure. It also yields a peculiar modification of chlorophyll (called thallochlor), fumaric acid, lichenostearic acid, and cetraric acid (which gives it the bitter taste). It forms a nutritious and easily digested amylaceous food, being used in place of starch in some preparations of cocoa. It also contains lichesterinic acid and protolichesterinic acids.1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Uses It is not, however, in great demand, and even in Iceland it is only occasionally used to make folk medicines,Cetraria islandica at Plants for the Future and in a few traditional dishes. In earlier times, it was much more widely used in breads, porridges, soups etc.Iceland Recipe Cetraric acid or cetrarin, a white micro-crystalline powder with a bitter taste, is readily soluble in alcohol, and slightly soluble in water and ether. It has been recommended for medicinal use by alternative medicine sites, in doses of 2 to 4 grains (0.1 to 0.25 grams), as a bitter tonic and aperient. It is traditionally used to relieve chest ailments,Iceland Moss irritation of the oral and pharyngeal mucous membranes and to suppress dry cough.

In the history of science, some of these supposed open problems were \\"solved\\" by means of showing that they were not well- defined. In mathematics, many open problems are concerned with the question of whether a certain definition is or is not consistent.

It is bounded by the A38 (Stokes Croft), the B4051 (Ashley Road), the A4032 (Newfoundland Road) and the A4044 (Newfoundland Street), although the traditional southern boundary before the M32 used to be the River Frome. In the early 18th century it was laid out as one of Bristol's first suburbs. History In the 1870s the Brooks Dye Works opened on the edge of St Pauls and became a major local employer, leading to the construction of terraced houses. Together with migration to Bristol, both from overseas and within Britain, this led to St Pauls becoming a densely populated suburb by the Victorian era. The area was bomb damaged during World War II. Rebuilding and investment was focused on new housing estates such as Hartcliffe and Southmead rather than St Pauls, and this contributed to a decline in the quality of the area. During the large- scale immigration of the 1950s, many people moved from Jamaica and Ireland, and settled in St Pauls. In 1963 St Paul's became the focus of attention when members of the British African-Caribbean community organised the Bristol Bus Boycott to protest against the racist employment policy of the Bristol Omnibus Company which operated a colour bar, refusing employment to non-white workers as bus crews. This policy was overturned in August of that year after sixty days of protest and the action helped establish the Race Relations Act 1968. A riot followed a police raid on the Black and White Caf√© in St Pauls on 2 April 1980. The St Pauls riot started when the police entered the caf√©, knowing that the premises was being used for drug dealing. A customer had his trousers ripped and demanded compensation, which the police refused. A crowd outside then refused to allow the police to leave, and when back-up was called a riot started.Bristol Riots with the St Pauls riot at the bottom of the page The riots were quickly blamed on race, but both white and black youths from both Irish and Jamaican backgrounds and some English fought against the police and the problems are thought to have been linked instead to poverty and perceived social injustices, predominantly the Sus law and anti-Irish feelings from IRA activity on the mainland. In 1990 a St Pauls black politician Kuomba Balogun, Chairman of the Bristol West Labour Party, was reported in the Bristol Evening Post of 2 February, as saying: \\"We make a public plea to the IRA to consider ways of strongly giving some assistance to the armed wing of the ANC in the same light as Colonel Gaddaffi sought to assist in the liberation of the people of Ireland.\\" An Early Day Motion was presented in Parliament calling on him to be expelled from the Labour Party. This area of the city has also suffered its share of gun violence, reaching a high point in the early 2000s (decade) when rival Jamaican Yardie and drug gangs such as the British Aggi Crew fought turf wars over territory. The drugs war between the rival feuding factions was extinguished following en masse arrests of both the Yardies and the home-grown Aggi Crew, with many of the foreign drug dealers being deported back to Jamaica. The Black and White Caf√© was closed in March 2005, and has been demolished to make way for houses after a compulsory purchase order. Now the area is experiencing a positive urban renewal with the St Pauls Unlimited scheme. Community St Pauls has a large African-Caribbean population. The relative poverty of the area has created a strong community spirit shown in the St Pauls Carnival, similar to the Notting Hill Carnival in London. It has been run annually since 1967 except for a hiatus in 2015‚Äì17, and by 2006 attracted an average of 40,000 people each year. This is a vibrant parade with local primary schools and community groups joining in. Parks The main parks are St Agnes Park and St Paul's Park, together with Portland and Brunswick squares. Other green spaces include Grosvenor Road Triangle and Dalrymple Road Park. A footbridge over the A4032 allows access to nearby Riverside Park, alongside the Frome. Architecture St Paul's Church, Bristol Many of the buildings in St Pauls are Georgian period, with Portland Square and St Paul's Church as particularly fine examples of Georgian architecture in the area. Both were designed by Daniel Hague although the original St Pauls Church was to be designed by James Allen in a Greek style. Work was started on the church in 1789 and completed in 1794.St Paul's Church Edward William Godwin, a famous Victorian architect, lived at Portland Square. In 2005 the church was converted into its present form as the home of 'Circomedia',Circomedia a circus school.  Redevelopment plans  In May 2007 proposals were announced to build about net of homes, offices and businesses, in the St Pauls area. The development, if approved, may include a , 40-storey, tower next to the M32 motorway as a new entrance to the city. The tower would be a similar shape to the Swiss Re \\"gherkin\\" tower in London. Politics St Pauls is part of the Ashley ward of Bristol City Council, along with St Agnes, St Andrews, Montpelier and St Werburghs. Ashley ward is represented by three elected councillors on Bristol City Council. Currently, these are Mike Davies and Carole Johnson of the Labour Party, and Jude English of the Green Party.

A city of over 63,000 inhabitants, it serves as the economic and administrative center of the Tubas Governorate. Its urban area consists of 2,271 dunams (227 hectares). It is governed by a municipal council of 15 members and most of its working inhabitants are employed in agriculture or public services. Khalid Samir Abdel Razzek is the current mayor of Tubas. Tubas has been identified as the ancient town of Thebez (), a Canaanite town famous for revolting against King Abimelech. During the late 19th century, during Ottoman rule in Palestine, Arab clans living in the Jordan Valley came to live in Tubas, and it became a major town in the District of Nablus, particularly known for its timber and cheese-making. It came under the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922, was annexed by Jordan after their capture of the town in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and then occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War. The Palestinian National Authority has had control of Tubas since the city was transferred to its jurisdiction in 1995. History=Ancient era The city's name Tubas derives from the Canaanite word Tuba Syoys or \\"illuminating star\\". Edward Robinson thought Tubas to be identical with the Canaanite/Israelite town of \\"Thebez\\" mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the Book of Judges.Robinson and Smith, 1856, p. 305Rix, 1907, pp. 157-159Skinner, 1895, p. The International Critical Commentary on the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments C. Scribner's Sons, p.268. It is the namesake of the titular woman of Thebez. Archaeological remains such as cemeteries and olive presses indicate that Tubas was inhabited during the Roman era of rule in Palestine.Tubas City Profile Applied Research Institute - Jerusalem. February 2006. Jerome mentioned Thebez being 13 Roman miles east of Neapolis (Nablus). Besides the Biblical story, nothing has been known about Thebez before or after the revolt.Bromiley, 1995, p. 825 Ottoman era In 1596 it appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as \\"Tubas\\", in the nahiya of Jabal Sami in the liwa of Nablus. It had a population of 41 households and 16 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, occasional revenues, goats, beehives, and a press for olives or grapes; a total of 11,704 ak√ßeH√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 125. In the late 19th century during Ottoman rule in Palestine, groups of Arabs belonging to the Daraghmeh clan‚Äîmostly shepherds and farmers who lived in the Jordan Valley‚Äîmigrated northward to the site because of its fertile ground, proximity to several springs, and its high elevation compared to the Jordan Valley and Wadi al-Far'a plain; Mount Gerizim was visible from the area. The Daraghmeh clan had lived in the Jordan Valley since the 15th century and in addition to Tubas, they founded or inhabited the nearby hamlets of Kardala, al-Farisiya, Khirbet al-Malih, Kishda, Yarza, and Ras al-Far'a. Soon after being established in Tubas, Arabs from Najd, Syria, Transjordan, Hebron and nearby Nablus came to settle in the area. During this period, Tubas became the site of clashes between the 'Abd al-Hadi and Tuqan clans of Nablus and suffered incursions by Bedouins from areas east of the city.Finn, 1867/1877, pp. 92‚Äì93 The Jarrar clan did not inhabit, but administrated Tubas, as it was located within the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Mashariq al-Jarrar.Doumani, 1995, p. The Hinterland of Nablus: Local Trade Networks Tubas was one of the largest villages in the District of Nablus. Most of the inhabitants resided in mud- built houses or tents in order to work on their distant lands in the Jordan Valley and to graze their sheep and goat flocks.Doumani, 1995, Notes According to traveler Herbert Rix, compared to other towns of its size in Samaria, Tubas was \\"well-to-do\\" and had abundant amounts of timber which was harvested for firewood. Tubas, unlike the villages in the rest of the district, depended on livestock and not olives for income. Livestock products included cheese, clarified butter, woolen rugs, tents, ropes, and cloth bags.Doumani, 1995, The Hinterland of Nablus In 1882 a boys' school was established in the town. In 1877 Lieutenant Kitchener, of the Palestine Exploration Fund survey team, reported uncovering an Arabic inscription buried in the wall of the village mosque recording its building and dedication. He also wrote that the villagers had paid a bribe of ¬£100 in gold to the Pasha of Nablus to avoid their young men being conscripted into the Turkish army fighting in Crimea. He noted that they would probably have to repeat the payment.Kitchener, 1878, p. 62 The Palestine Exploration Fund noted that the Samaritans believed that the tomb of Asher, known locally as Nabi Tota (\\"the good prophet\\"), was located in Tubas. The tomb served as a shrine in local Muslim tradition.Conder, 1881, p. 201 British Mandate era In 1917, the British captured Palestine from the Ottomans. After rule under a military government, it was reorganized in 1922-23 Tubas was incorporated into the British Mandate of Palestine.

The city represents roughly a third (33.4%) of the Tubas Governorate's total population. The city's modern-era founders, the Daraghmeh clan, constitute 70% of Tubas' inhabitants. The clan has several smaller branches, including the Mslamany, Abd al-Razeq and Abu Khazaran families.Ras al-Far'a Village Profile, ARIJ The Sawafta family make up 25%, the Husheh make up 3% and the Fuquha represent the remaining 2%. The inhabitants of Tubas are predominantly Muslims, but there is a community of approximately 60 Palestinian Christians, all belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church.Locations: Tubas Salt of the Earth. The Christian community worships at the Holy Trinity Church in the city and are serviced by a priest from nearby Zababdeh.Irving, 2012, p. 236. According to the 2017 census by the PCBS, the population of Tubas was 60,186, http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Downloads/book2364.pdf page 34 forming 1.3% of the total population of Palestine. Economy The economical situation Tubas during the 1993-99 period was prosperous, however since the start of the Second Intifada in 2000-01, Tubas' income level has decreased by roughly 40%. Prior to the Intifada, the average household income was 2,500 NIS; it has since receded to about 1,500 NIS. A major factor that has resulted from the conflict was the confiscation of agricultural land located within the city's or its governorate's jurisdiction by Israeli settlements or military authorities. According to the PCBS, in 1999, approximately 52% of the citizens were within the working age (15-64). Of the city's labor force, 48% are females. The unemployment rate increased dramatically from 20% in 1999 to 70% after the year 2000. Prior to the Intifada, 35% of the total labor force worked in Israel.Toubas (2005) Health Work Committees. Currently, agriculture constitutes 60% of Tubas' economic activity, public services comprise 17%, trade is 10%, Israeli labor is 8%, construction and industry make-up the remaining 5%. In the city, there are 240 shops and stores, 70 service institutions and one big ready mix concrete factory 30 small ones. The main economic sector in Tubas is agriculture. There is a total of 150,000 dunams of arable land, of which 124,450 dunams are covered by forests and 10,604 dunams cultivated. Although the land is fertile, there is a lack of water for irrigation. The only spring used is in nearby Ein Far'a. Field crops account for 49% of the cultivable land, while fruit orchards account for 40% and vegetables make-up 11%. Israeli trenches around the neighboring villages of Ras al-Ahmar and Khirbet al-'Atuf prevent access to nearly 40% of Tubas' arable lands. Many Tubas residents keep livestock, mostly sheep; in 2005, there was a total 6,670 sheep. Other livestock owned include 96 heads of cattle, 880 goats and 126,500 poultry. In addition, 123 beehives were kept. In 2006 the Golden Sheep Dairy factory was founded in Tubas with help from UCODEP, an independent Italian company. The factory specializes in the production of Italian cheese and primarily targets cosmopolitan consumers in Ramallah, Bethlehem and Jerusalem as well as international workers and diplomats living in the West Bank.Irving, 2012, p. 55. Government Tubas serves as the muhfaza (\\"capital\\" or \\"seat\\") of the Tubas Governorate. Since 1995, Tubas has been located in Area A, giving the PNA full control over its security, administration and civilian affairs. Tubas has been governed by a municipal council since 1953, when it was granted permission to do so by Jordanian authorities who controlled the West Bank at the time. The council is made up of 15 members including the mayor, and is headquartered in the municipal hall in the center of the town. The municipality has over 60 employees. Responsibilities of the municipality include civil administration, urban planning and development, social development services, distribution of social services, the issuing of building permits and infrastructural maintenance: water, electricity and solid waste collection. Auqab Daraghmeh was succeeded by Jamal Abdel Fattah Mahmoud Abu Mohsin, an independent candidate, elected in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections. During the elections, women won two seats, and though Tubas is normally a Fatah stronghold, all seats were won by independent political lists.Local elections (round one) - the winners according to local authority, gender and No. of votes obtained Higher Commission for Local Elections, pp. 11‚Äì13. 2004-12-23. Education In 2004‚Äì05, Tubas had twelve schools; four for males, three for females and five co-educational. There were 4,924 students and 191 teachers. In addition, six kindergartens are located in the city, and have a total of 620 pupils. In 1997, the literacy rate was 86%; females comprised 78.3% of the illiterate population. Of the literate population, 25.7% completed elementary education, 23.3% completed preparatory education and 22.1% completed secondary or higher education. Many students throughout the Jordan Valley receive their education in Tubas. The Al-Quds Open University based in Jerusalem, has a campus in Tubas known as Al-Quds Open University-Tubas Educational Region. In 2006, 1,789 students were enrolled in the university, it had 90 professors and 24 other employees.Toubas Educational Region Al-Quds Open University. Local infrastructure Tubas contains six mosques. The main mosques are the Abd ar- Rahan Mosque, the al-Tawled Mosque, Umar ibn al-Khattab Mosque, and Shaheed Mosque. The Holy Trinity Orthodox Church is also located in Tubas, in the northern part of the city. The church was built in 1976 to serve the small Orthodox Christian community. It consists of a prayer room, a fellowship hall, an office, and a library for children.al-Mashni, Osama. Holy Trinity Orthodox Church in Tubas, Palestine The Sawafta family has an old palace in Tubas as well. Since Tubas is the capital and largest city in the Tubas Governorate, it acts as the main provider of services to the towns and villages of the governorate. All Palestinian National Authority offices that serve the governorate are located in the city. There are 21 government institutions in Tubas, including a post office, the Palestinian Ministry of Labor office, the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture office, the Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs office, the fire department and a police station. Transportation Buses and taxis are the primary means of transportation in Tubas. The total length of paved roads is , whereas there are of deteriorating paved roads and of road that are entirely unpaved. Tubas is located on Highway 588 connected to the main Ramallah-Nablus road (Highway 60) by a network of northeastern offshoots of the road, that pass through the villages of Azmut, al-Badhan and Ras al-Far'a. It is connected to Jenin from a northern road which passes through 'Aqqaba, Zababdeh and finally to Jenin. Travel to Jordan is through Highway 57 which is connected with Highway 588 just to the south of Tubas.Satellite view of Tubas Health care The city contains five health centers run by various organizations including the Palestinian Red Crescent. There are no hospitals in Tubas, nor in the Tubas Governorate; Residents must travel to Nablus for hospital treatment, but there are two ambulances in Tubas for emergency transportation. There are four clinics in the city: Two are run by non-governmental organizations, one by the Palestinian National Authority and one is privately owned. The clinics lack modern equipment and specialists, however. In addition, ten pharmacies exist in Tubas. Utilities Approximately 60% of the residents have a telephone connection, and roughly 90% are connected to the water. The Tubas Municipality administers all water resources in and around the city. In addition to the water network, there is one spring (Far'a) in the immediate area which is the main provider of water for use in households. The city also has a water reservoir with a capacity of . This is primarily used to provide water to the urban areas of the city during Summer, and is only available once on a weekly basis. From 1963 to 1997 local municipal-owned electric generators provided Tubas with all of its electricity needs. In 1997, the city connected with the Tubas Area Electricity Network which is provided by the Israeli Electric Cooperation. In that period, 99% of households in the city were connected with electricity. Solid waste management in Tubas is operated by the municipality and Joint Services Council. It is collected 3-4 times daily from the residential area, which is sent to a shared dumping site from the city. The main disposal method used is burning. Tubas is not connected to the sewage network, therefore all households dispose of their waste water in cesspits, a major source of pollution in groundwater.

He is a sarcastic, drug-addicted, foul- mouthed, troubled, bitter, but brilliant gonzo journalist with a deep-seated hatred of authority, political corruption, and dogs. Spider is almost always drawn wearing a set of stereoscopic sunglasses with one lens red and the other green, and he is most often compared to the real-life figure Hunter S. Thompson.Walter, Damien (2016). \\"Jerusalem is something of a homage to Hunter S Thompson, but also a portrait of his creator Warren Ellis.\\"(2014). \\"Warren Ellis: Questions\\", GoodReads.com. Ellis: \\"Spider was inspired by Thompson (though there are several other people in him).\\"H&I; Staff (2017). \\"Did you know Hunter S. Thompson is immortalized in comic form?\\", HandiTV.com. Spider Jerusalem is, \\"loosely based on Thompson.\\" IGN named him 45th of the 'Top 100 Comic Book Heroes'. Background Spider is a renegade gonzo journalist forced to return to the City after having exhausted a substantial advance from a publisher without completing the books required by contract. After five years of effective retirement as a long-haired hermit in a compound in the mountains, he returns to The City to complete the books, takes up work for an urban newspaper to support his writing, and finds himself battling political corruption at the highest level. One of Spider's most apparent character traits is his heavy drug use, which he makes no attempt to conceal. In addition to being a chain smoker and heavy drinker, Spider uses an extensive variety of drugs ranging from mild stimulants, intellect enhancers, and mood- altering drugs to cocaine, heroin and rare, exotic, futuristic drugs. As is common in his society, Spider is resistant or immune to many forms of drug addiction, as well as lung cancer. Spider is well known for his foul language, especially when combining the word \\"fuck\\" with other words to make new and amusing insults. Spider is easily angered, his displays of temper ranging from mild verbal outbursts to violent physical assault. However, despite his temper and contempt for the City as a whole, Spider is often seen to treat innocents (particularly children) with kindness and care. Spider's past is not well known, though characters like Mitchell Royce and Spider himself have referred to past memorable incidents such as the enfant terrible (a French child assassin from the Anglo/Franco war) and the Prague telephone incident (in which Spider caused six politicians to commit suicide using just a phone). There are also hints at his childhood, which seems to have been extremely turbulent‚Äîsomewhere between a victim of urban blight and a child soldier‚Äîand his early ambitions‚Äî\\"I wanted to be a sniper when I grew up. Didn't everyone?\\"‚Äîas well as his parents' growing madness. He claims to have worked as a prostitute at some point in the past, and as a stripper at 8 years old. He grew up on the City's docks with drunken parents as an only child. His father drove a city bus and his mother was a housewife who cooked lizards for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. He returned to the docks as an adult to see that everyone was gone and the docks were abandoned and vowed to never forget his childhood there. Philosophy Spider is a firm believer in the truth and delivering it to his readers in the most direct and blunt manner possible, often capitalising it as \\"The Truth\\" in his writing for emphasis. This is most notable in one story, when Spider's editor recounts the tale of how Spider submitted an article on the election of the Richard Nixon-analogue \\"The Beast\\", which consisted of the word \\"fuck\\" repeated eight thousand times (see Transmetropolitan #1). His approach to journalism has been encapsulated by Spider as \\"The truth...no matter what,\\" and his appraisal of others rises if they feel the same way. The primary focus of conflict within Spider's psyche, over the course of the series, is a combination of concern for his delivery of 'The Truth' and misanthropy towards his public. Spider hates and struggles against authority figures who oppress others, but he is also bitter toward the uninvolved public who give the authority its power. Likewise, he struggles to convince the public to listen to The Truth, but is disgusted by those who blindly accept what he reports. In addition, Spider's talents earn him unwanted fame and adoration, which clouds his ability to \\"get at The Truth\\", often resulting in him experiencing writer's block and depression. His editor, Mitchell Royce, opines that Spider needs to be hated in order to function as a writer and journalist. Despite his absolute disdain for those around him, Spider is quite loyal to those few who he considers friends and is equally quick to hurt those who would betray him. Indeed, much of Spider's motivation in the second half of the series was dedicated to bringing the President to justice for ordering the murder of Vita Severn, whom Spider had befriended. Although he opposed The Beast, Spider is not loyal to any political party or organization, and his initial support of The Smiler was tinged with contempt at his cynical attitude and false altruism. He is also an avowed, often virulent atheist who opposes all organized religion, which he sees as little more than unworthy authority figures that exploit their members. Weapons He proudly claims to be \\"always armed\\", and is shown with several firearms, at least one of which, called \\"The Upper Hand\\", can blow up a vehicle. He has also possessed a rocket launcher, which he used to blow up a bar at the base of his mountain home. He was accidentally given a bandolier of grenades at a party, which he took as a sign that \\"There is a God\\". Spider's weapon of choice for most of the series is a \\"bowel disruptor,\\" which causes instant and painful loss of bowel control, with settings that allow him to vary the level of pain and discomfort, ranging from simple loose, watery diarrhea to complete rectal prolapse. Most of the time the victim has a bowel movement so dramatic and agonizing that it induces unconsciousness. At least three times it is revealed through dialogue that the gun can be set to 'Fatal Intestinal Maelstrom'. Spider prefers this weapon because, despite being illegal, it is (usually) non-lethal and its effects are untraceable. His assistants, Channon and Yelena, have also been armed with bowel disruptors during The Cure arc. On a few occasions, he has been known to carry lethal firearms, though according to Spider, he only carries such weapons in emergency cases. He has, in at least one case, used a handgun to kill two would-be assassins (a third was beaten to death). In issue #38, he is revealed to be a competent gunfighter, having learned his skills in \\"places you never want to go.\\" It is also revealed in issue #38 that he has killed sixteen people, all but one in self-defence; he never specifies how or why (although it could be inferred that he means Vita Severn, as Spider feels responsible for her death). Regardless of whether or not he is armed, Spider is shown to be a surprisingly capable, though not invincible, fighter. He frequently lashes out violently at those who threaten or aggravate him, and his ferocity often allows him to defeat opponents who are well-trained or much more imposing physically. He is also not averse to brutalizing people in order to get crucial information (as is shown in his Year Five assault on Fred Christ). Like Channon, he had also gained experience in firearms while in school, though unlike Channon, he and his classmates had had to make their own arms‚Äîto prevent the teachers having an unfair advantage. He often uses improvised weapons to gain the upper hand‚Äîfor example, putting his cigarette out in the eye of a guard or beating Fred Christ with a broken chair leg, which he dubbed \\"The Chair Leg of Truth\\". Appearance Initially, Spider is shown with a huge amount of muddy brown, shaggy hair and a long unkempt beard, claiming he has hair in places that his once and future editor/friend Mitchell Royce doesn't even know he owns. On his return to the City, nearly all his hair is removed by a malfunctioning cleaning unit in his first apartment's bathroom. For the rest of the series, he is portrayed as virtually hairless, the exception being his eyebrows and a small amount of pubic hair. Spider is a small, slight figure with a long nose and slightly crooked teeth. His body is covered with black tattoos, combining geometric tribal designs and other more Western images (his right buttock is marked \\"kiss here\\"), including a small spider on his upper forehead. He is also said to have a tattoo on his penis, though this is never shown. Although he prefers not to wear clothes much of the time, when in public his primary mode of dress is typically a \\"black linen suit, urban weight, generous cut\\" (jacket and pants, no shirt under the jacket) with a pair of heavy black leather boots, although during the winter he is sometimes seen wearing a black jumper under his jacket; also, on the rare occasions when modesty is required of him he will wear knee-length boxer shorts. He also wears a pair of 'live-shades', sunglasses with built-in still- photography capabilities; the right lens is green and rectangular, whilst the left one is red and circular (the AI that created them was on drugs at the time). The first pair he owns have gold rims around the lenses, while the ones he obtains during the second part of the Dirge arc have no rims. This appearance, and the comic's futuristic setting, has made Spider Jerusalem a cult (albeit fictional) character among rivet heads, in a similar manner to Tank Girl. Influences Spider Jerusalem is reminiscent of previous \\"muck- raking\\" or \\"Gonzo\\" journalists such as H. L. Mencken and Hunter S. Thompson. Hunter S. Thompson is perhaps the most obvious inspiration for the character of Spider Jerusalem, and the fictional reporter's fondness for weaponry and spectacular consumption of drugs both indicate a resemblance toward the American gonzo journalist. (In Transmetropolitan #13, page 5, a book by Thompson is clearly visible amongst the objects strewn across the table in Spider's apartment. A book entitled \\"FEAR AND LOATHING\\" is also visible in Issue #1, Page 1, Panel 3, in the lower left-hand corner of the panel.) Visually, Spider Jerusalem is based on Darick Robertson's friend Andre Ricciardi. Planetary One of Ellis's other titles, Planetary, features a character in its seventh issue named Jack Carter, who is a thinly-veiled pastiche of John Constantine, being essentially identical in appearance, role, abilities and diction. The issue is essentially a retrospective commentary on the genre of grim, British-penned comics of the anti-Thatcherite 1980s milieu, of which the Carter character is positioned as the apotheosis. Having faked his own death, Carter reappears in a dramatically altered form with a shaved head and long black coat which he later opens to reveal a bare chest featuring identical tattoos to Spider Jerusalem. Lacking only the spider tattoo on the head and the trademark shades, this former Constantine-cipher has become the spitting image of Jerusalem and departs with the words: \\"The Eighties are long over. Time to Move on. Time to be someone else.\\" Reception Wizard magazine ranked Spider Jerusalem as the 38th-greatest comic book character of all time. Spider Jerusalem was also ranked as the 12th-greatest comic book character of all time by Empire magazine quoting that \\"Spider is a true one-off, a character so fearless and vibrant and nonchalantly cool that Patrick Stewart is his biggest fan. And if that's not a recommendation, we don't know what is.\\" IGN also ranked Spider Jerusalem as the 45th-greatest comic book hero of all time stating that Spider Jerusalem isn't quite a role model for the kids but over the course of the series' long life, readers came to know the true Spider Jerusalem and revel in his ultimate victory.

He chose the former, and wrote Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating.

Violence decreases as rules are established (e.g., the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding) for dealing with international conflicts. # The world can be roughly divided into two groups: the Functioning Core, characterized by economic interdependence, and the Non- Integrated Gap, characterized by unstable leadership and absence from international trade. The Core can be sub-divided into Old Core (North America, Europe, Japan, Australia) and New Core (China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Russia). The Disconnected Gap includes the Middle East, South Asia (except India), most of Africa, Southeast Asia, and northwest South America. # Integration of the Gap countries into the global economy will provide opportunities for individuals living in the Gap to improve their lives, thereby presenting a desirable alternative to violence and terrorism. The US military is the only force capable of providing the military support to facilitate this integration by serving as the last-ditch rule-enforcer. Barnett argues that it has been doing so for over 20 years by \\"exporting\\" security (US spends about half of the world's total in military spending). # To be successful the US military must stop thinking of war in the context of war but war in the context of \\"everything else\\", i.e. demographics, energy, investment, security, politics, trade, immigration, etc. # In recognition of its dual role, the US military should organize itself according to two functions, the \\"Leviathan\\" and the \\"System Administrator.\\" #* Leviathan's purpose is the use of overwhelming force in order to end violence quickly. It will take out governments, defend Core countries, and generally do the deterrence work that the US military has been doing since the end of WWII. The Leviathan force is primarily staffed by young aggressive personnel and is overwhelmingly American. #* The SysAdmin's purpose is to wage peace: peacekeeping, nation building, strengthening weak governments, etc. The SysAdmin force is primarily staffed by older, more experienced personnel, though not entirely (he would put the Marines in SysAdmin as the \\" Mini-me Leviathan\\"). The sys Admin force would work best as a Core-wide phenomenon. # By exporting security, the US and the rest of the Core benefit from increased trade, increased international investment, and other benefits.

Origins  J√≥zef Niemojewski, leader of the uprising The outbreak of Ko≈õciuszko Uprising in central Poland in March 1794 served as the spark for the formation of Polish military units in the Prussian partition, as Poles in Wielkopolska hoped to liberate their region.Marek Rezler, \\"Powstanie Wielkopolskie\\", Rebis, Poznan, 2008, pg. 12-15 Initially, Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, who had initiated the fight against Russians in central Poland did not want to support the Greater Poland Uprising in the hope of avoiding a two front war (at the time, Kingdom of Prussia was nominally in an alliance with Poland against Russia).Marek Rezler, \\"Powstanie Wielkopolskie\\", Rebis, Poznan, 2008, pg. 12 \\"Insurrectionist units were formed, however, initially these did not have the support of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, who wished to avoid a war on two fronts\\" As a result, the planned insurrection in Wielkopolska almost ended before it could start. However, the situation changed in June 1794 when the Prussians declared their support for Tsarist Russia and offered them military support in suppressing Ko≈õciuszko (after his victory at the Battle of Rac≈Çawice). As a result, the Supreme National Council issued a proclamation To the Citizens of Greater Poland calling them to arms.  Rebellion  The initial center of the uprising was the Kujawy region. The command was given to J√≥zef Niemojewski, although many of the units in the field operated independently. Initial clashes took place on the 20th of August.Jerzy Topolski, \\"An outline history of Poland\\", Interpress, 1986, pg. 144, On the 22nd of August the insurrectionists took Gniezno. Soon after, general Pawe≈Ç Sk√≥rzewski took Konin and other towns in the area. As a result, the King of Prussia, Frederick William II was forced to withdraw some of his forces from central Poland which were besieging Warsaw. A Polish corps under Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski captured Bydgoszcz on October 2, and entered Pomerania almost unopposed.Hugh Chisholm, \\"The Encyclop√¶dia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 15\\", The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Company, 1911, pg. 915, DƒÖbrowski planned to winter in Bydgoszcz and then move through Toru≈Ñ, but because of Ko≈õciuszko's defeat at the Battle of Maciejowice he decided instead to evacuate Wielkopolska and make his way into central Poland. Although thanks to the mobility of his forces he evaded being encircled by a much less mobile Prussian army, the Prussians recaptured most of the gains made by the insurrectionists in the previous few months. left DƒÖbrowski unsuccessfully tried to convince Ko≈õciuszko's successor, Tomasz Wawrzecki to move the insurrection from central Poland to the Prussian partition. On November 17, 1794, the last Polish units in central Poland capitulated to the Russians at Radoszyce.William Fiddian Reddaway, \\"The Cambridge history of Poland: from Augustus II to Pilsudski (1697-1935), Volume 1\\", CUP Archive, 1950, pg. 172, In Wielkopolska sporadic guerrilla fighting continued until mid-December. The uprising almost got a second life when a hero of the fighting in Warsaw and one of Ko≈õciuszko's colonels, the shoemaker Jan Kili≈Ñski (who had been born in Trzemeszno), arrived in Wielkopolska to try to reorganize the Polish forces. However, he was soon captured by the Prussians and handed over to the Russians.

The original formulation was that the magnitudes of the black-white differences on tests of cognitive ability positively correlate with the tests' g-loading.Jensen, A. R. (1985). The nature of the black‚Äìwhite difference on various psychometric tests: Spearman's hypothesis. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 8(02), 193‚Äì219. The subsequent formulation was that the magnitude of the black-white difference on tests of cognitive ability is entirely or mainly a function of the extent to which a test measures general mental ability, or g.Hunt, E., & Carlson, J. (2007). Considerations relating to the study of group differences in intelligence. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 2(2), 194‚Äì213.  Description  The hypothesis, first formalized by Arthur Jensen in the 1980s based on Charles Spearman's earlier comments on the topic, stated that the magnitude of the differences is directly related to the magnitude of the g-loadings of a test. Jensen devised the method of correlated vectors (MCV) to study this hypothesis and published his research in his paper, \\"The nature of the black‚Äìwhite difference on various psychometric tests: Spearman's hypothesis\\", a paper which elicited 29 comments from experts in the field. Some subsequent research has confirmed Jensen's original findings and has extended the hypothesis to other ethnic and racial groups.te Nijenhuis, J. (2012). Jan te Nijenhuis. The Flynn effect, group differences, and g loadings. Personality and Individual Differences. In 2002, Jensen stated that he had now tested Spearman's hypothesis‚Äîthe original formulation‚Äîon twenty-five large independent samples, and it had been confirmed on every one. Based on all these studies, he asserted, \\"the overall probability that Spearman's hypothesis is false is less than one in a billion.\\"Miele, Frank (2002). Intelligence, Race and Genetics. Conversations with Arthur R. Jensen. Westview Press. Paperback edition first published in 2004 by Westview Press. (pbk). Page 138. Jensen went on to argue that the finding of a positive correlation between group differences and g-loadings strongly supported the hypothesis that the group differences were largely in general mental ability‚Äîthe later formulation of Spearman's hypothesis.Dolan, C. V., Roorda, W., & Wicherts, J. M. (2004). Two failures of Spearman's hypothesis: The GATB in Holland and the JAT in South Africa. Intelligence, 32(2), 155‚Äì173. The validity of this inference has been much debated. Jensen and others provided alternative tests for the hypothesis that the group differences were largely in general mental ability. These include a method devised by Robert Gordon which involves creating a group difference factor and then determining the congruence coefficient between the general intelligence factor and the group difference factor.Jensen, A. R. (1987). Further evidence for Spearman's hypothesis concerning black‚Äìwhite differences on psychometric tests. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 10(03), 512‚Äì519. Later studies showed that Spearman's hypothesis is not confined to black-white differences, nor is it merely an American phenomenon. A positive correlation between score gap size and g loading has been observed in comparisons of European populations with Roma communities, Central Asian populations, Native Americans, and Jews (from both United States and Israel). Spearman's hypothesis has also been observed in academic achievement tests, which indicates that it is not a unique characteristic of intelligence tests. Others have used Jensen's method of correlated vectors to test whether other group differences are related to a test's g-loading, such as differences between test-training groups and non-training groups, between Protestants and Catholics in Europe, between cohorts, and so on.te Nijenhuis, J., van Vianen, A. E., & van der Flier, H. (2007). Score gains on g-loaded tests: No g. Intelligence, 35(3), 283‚Äì300.Steppan, M. (2010). Protestantism and intelligence: Max Weber and the Rindermann-paradox. The International Journal of Educational and Psychological Assessment, 5, 134‚Äì154.  Related hypotheses =Group differences Closely related to Spearman's hypothesis is the hypothesis that the magnitude of certain group differences correlates with within-group heritability estimates. Arthur Jensen and J. Phillippe Rushton, for example, reported in 2010 that the found psychometric meta-analytic correlation between g-loadings and heritability estimates was 1.Rushton, J. P., & Jensen, A. R. (2010). \\"The rise and fall of the Flynn Effect as a reason to expect a narrowing of the Black‚ÄìWhite IQ gap\\". Intelligence, 38(2), 213‚Äì219. Their argument was supported by several US studies supporting this correlation, with the most cited adoption projects that sought to estimate the heritability of IQ were those of Texas, Colorado and Minnesota that were started in the 1970s. The international data, though, has challenged this finding: a study from Japan published in 2014 did find a correlation between g-loading and heritability, but only a third of that found by Jensen & Rushton;Jan te Nijenhuis, Kenya Kura, Yoon-Mi Hur (2014) The correlation between g loadings and heritability in Japan: A meta-analysis. Intelligence 46:275-282, doi:10.1016/j.intell.2014.07.008. one from 2015 covering Korea that found no clear link between heritability and g-loadings of IQ subtests; and one from 2016 by Voronin, Te Nijenhuis, and Malykh found negative correlations between g-loadings and heritability in two samples of Russian twins. Jensen effect In 1998, Rushton proposed the term Jensen effect to refer to the positive and statistically significant correlation between the vector of many biological variables and that of the g-loadings of different subtests.  Implications  Jensen argued that Spearman's hypothesis explains why the black-white gap varies across different IQ tests. He also argued that were Spearman's hypothesis proven correct it would establish that the main source of the difference between whites and blacks on IQ tests is the same as the main source of the differences between individuals within each racial group, namely g. If so, he argued, to understand the nature of the black-white gap, one would have to understand the nature of g.Jensen, A.R. (1998). The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability. Westport, CT: Praeger. , p. 371-383. Hereditarians, including Jensen, have also argued that Spearman's hypothesis (both formulations) supports their hereditarian position with regards to racial and ethnic differences. There are two arguments based on the two formulations of Spearman's hypothesis. The first is that a correlation between group differences and g-loadings is what one would expect if differences were predominantly genetically conditioned but not if differences were culturally conditioned.Gottfredson, L. S. (2005). What if the hereditarian hypothesis is true?. Psych. Pub. Pol. and L., 11, 311‚Äì605. The second is that g differences are deeply biologically and genetically rooted within populations and, as such, it's reasonable to postulate that they could be so rooted between populations.Gottfredson, L. S. (2007). Shattering logic to explain the Flynn effect. Cato Unbound. As for this latter point, Rushton and Jensen argued that a test's g-loading also correlated with scholastic and workplace performance, heritability estimates determined from twin studies, inbreeding depression scores calculated in children of cousin-marriages, brain evoked potentials, brain pH levels, brain glucose metabolism, as well as nerve conduction velocity, reaction time, and other physiological factors. This, they argue, supports the view that g is biological and heritable. Therefore, a confirmation of Spearman's hypothesis and the similar relationship for heritability would support, they argued, the theory that the average racial IQ differences were partially genetic.  Criticism  Spearman's hypothesis and the arguments that invoke it have received multiple criticisms, including criticisms of Jensen's method of correlated vectors, of the inference that the first formulation of Spearman's hypothesis supports the second, and of genetic and biological arguments made on the basis of Spearman's hypothesis. First, Jensen's MCV has been criticized with regards to the original formulation of Spearman's hypothesis. Peter Sch√∂nemann and others argue that MCV produces tautological results. However, according to Dolan and Lubke (2001), Sch√∂nemann's analysis is incorrect; using simulations, they show that the correlations are not positive by mathematical necessity.Dolan, C.V. and Lubke, G.H. (2001). Viewing Spearman's hypothesis from the perspective of multigroup PCA: A comment on Sch√∂nemann's criticism. Intelligence 29, 231‚Äì245. Ashton and Lee (2005) argue that MCV can produce spurious results.Ashton, M. C., & Lee, K. (2005). Problems with the method of correlated vectors. Intelligence, 33(4), 431‚Äì444. However, according to te Nijenhuis et al. (2007), one can use psychometric meta-analysis to negate this problem. Second, Jensen's MCV has been criticized with regards to the claim that it supports the later formulation of Spearman's hypothesis. Dolan et al. (2004) argue that MCV lacks specificity: that is, that instances not including g differences could create a positive correlation between the magnitude of the group differences and the g-loadings. Dolan et al. (2004) note that they are specifically criticizing MCV as a way of proving that group differences largely or totally represent g differences; they don't argue against Spearman's hypothesis as originally formulated and they do not argue that the larger body of evidence does not support Spearman's hypothesis as later formulated. Hunt and Carlson summarize criticism: However, Rushton and Jensen (2010) argued that this criticism misses the point because there was no absolute claim that g had been proven‚Äîonly that the results were what would have been expected if a g difference did in fact exist. Moreover, te Nijenhuis et al. (2007) note that the method proposed by Dolan et al. (2004) is not without limitations: Third, arguments based on Spearman's hypothesis have been criticized. Some have argued that culturally caused differences could produce a correlation between g-loadings and group differences. Flynn (2010) has criticized the basic assumption that confirmation of Spearman's hypothesis would support a partially genetic explanation for IQ differences. He argues that environmental causes for average group IQ differences would cause the differences to be greater for more complex tasks.Flynn, J. R. (2010). The spectacles through which I see the race and IQ debate. Intelligence, 38(4), 363‚Äì366. Several recent studies of Spearman's hypothesis have been carried out using items instead of (sub)tests. These studies find similar positive correlations as the ones using tests. This approach was first used by Rushton. This method variant has been criticized by Jelte Wicherts repeatedly because the item metrics from classical test theory are confounded by the ability level of the sample and this results in nonlinearities.

Shortly after announcing that he would be on medical leave for the 2007 season, he died of brain cancer. Hoeppner was a 1969 graduate of Franklin College, where he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta international fraternity. He owned a 57‚Äì39 overall record as a collegiate head coach. He is a member of the Indiana Football Hall of Fame. Family Terry and Jane Hoeppner had three children: Drew Hoeppner, Amy Fox and Allison Hoeppner. Allison Hoeppner was killed in an automobile accident on September 24, 2016. Professional career Hoeppner played for the Detroit Wheels and the Charlotte Hornets of the World Football League for one season each. He was also invited to training camps for the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals and Green Bay Packers, but never made either active roster. High school coach Terry was a head coach of Eastbrook High School in Marion, Indiana (1970‚Äì1972), Pinson Valley High School in Pinson, Alabama (1973‚Äì1976), Mullins High School in Mullins, South Carolina (1976‚Äì1978) and East Noble High School in Kendallville, Indiana (1979). College assistant coach Hoeppner's first job as an assistant coach was at his alma mater, Franklin College, where he served as defensive coordinator. He spent six years there before moving to Miami University as a linebacker coach in 1986. After 12 years, Hoeppner worked his way up to assistant head coach and defensive coordinator. He was also able to retain his positions after head coach Tim Rose was replaced prior to the 1990 season by the late Randy Walker. Hoeppner was instrumental in the development of several NFL players, including JoJuan Armour, Dustin Cohen, and Sheldon White. College head coach=Miami University After spending 13 years as an assistant at Miami, Hoeppner became the RedHawks' 31st head coach in 1999. He succeeded Walker, who was named head coach at Northwestern. Hoeppner's first game at Miami was against Walker and the Wildcats, which resulted in a 28‚Äì3 Miami victory. Despite the win, his first year was considered by some to be a disappointment. The RedHawks were coming off a 10‚Äì1 season, and returned several starters including record-breaking running back Travis Prentice, but were only able to post a 7‚Äì4 record. The dropoff was attributed in part to Hoeppner's installation of an open passing attack, rather than the running game Walker had used in the past. The change ended up paying dividends later, as Miami earned a 48‚Äì25 overall record under Hoeppner and finished among the top three in the Mid-American Conference East in each of his six years at the helm. While at Miami, Hoeppner recruited and signed Ben Roethlisberger by promising to play him at quarterback, whereas other programs were recruiting Roethlisberger as a wide receiver or a tight end. Roethlisberger went on to achieve great success in the NFL as quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Hoeppner's best season was 2003 when Miami, quarterbacked by Roethlisberger, went 13‚Äì1 and finished #10 in the final AP Poll.. Indiana During his first year as head coach at Indiana University, Hoeppner tried to resurrect life into the program through his campaign entitled \\"Coach Hoeppner wants you.\\" Hoeppner and the Hoosiers began the season 4‚Äì1 before losing their last six games. After the season, Hoeppner was diagnosed with a brain tumor CSTV Hoosiers page The following year, the Hoosiers once again started strong, but eventually fell one game short of Hoeppner's goal of reaching a college bowl berth. His oft quoted mantra was \\"Play 13.\\" In 2007, the inspired Hoosiers succeeded in Hoeppner's goal and became eligible to participate in the Insight Bowl. In September 2006, Hoeppner required additional brain surgery, causing him to miss two weeks of the regular season. He returned to the team to coach against Wisconsin. Death On March 18, 2007, it was revealed that he would sit out the 2007 spring practices due to health reasons. IU announced in June 2007 that Hoeppner would be on a medical leave of absence for the entire 2007 season and that assistant coach Bill Lynch would serve as head coach.

Schocken Books Prussian forces after the Partitions of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1772‚Äì1795). The uprising was organized by General Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski to help advancing French forces under Napoleon in liberating Poland from Prussian occupation. The Wielkopolska Uprising was a decisive factor that allowed the formation of the Duchy of Warsaw (1806) and the inclusion of Wielkopolska in the Duchy of Warsaw. It was one of the three most successful uprisings in the history of Poland, in addition to the Greater Poland uprising of 1918‚Äì1919 and Sejny Uprising in 1919. Historical background While the Kingdom of Prussia already possessed large Polish population in Upper Silesia, it gained additional Polish citizens during the partitions of Poland. From the beginnings of Prussian rule Poles were subject to a series of measures aimed against them and their culture; Polish language was abolished as official language and German introduced.Andrzej Chwalba ‚Äì Historia Polski 1795‚Äì1918 Wydawnictwo Literackie 2000 Krak√≥w pages 175‚Äì184, 307‚Äì312 Prussian ruler Frederick the Great who hatedWielki Fryderyk: Adolf Nowaczy≈Ñski Zak≈Çad Narodowy im.

Lands of Polish nobility were confiscated and given to German nobles. German colonists were settled The War of the Fourth Coalition between Napoleonic France and the Kingdom of Prussia gave hope to the Polish inhabitants of Greater Poland of recovering their independence and ending oppressive Prussian rule. Napoleon, counting on the benefits of gaining control over lands on the other side of Prussia, sent a group of emissaries to South Prussia to collect information about the situation in the province and the sympathies of the Polish citizens. On 20 September 1806 the emperor issued orders to form a new division from Polish deserters from the Prussian army. There were so many that two days later, Napoleon decided to form a second division. The open conflict between France and Prussia ensured that Prussia could only maintain a small number of troops in Greater Poland. Moreover, a large portion of those soldiers were Polish nationals. This caused a great deal of trouble for Prussian commanders; for instance, between 1 November and 20 December, 3000 Polish troops (1/7th) deserted from the Toru≈Ñ Corps. The low morale of Germans contributed to the French victory at the battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt. Mission of General DƒÖbrowski In order to organize a diversion on the back of Prussians, Napoleon chose General Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski, who was staying in Italy. DƒÖbrowski was chosen for this mission because he had a great respect in Greater Poland from his military leadership during the uprising of 1794. Napoleon sent a message to DƒÖbrowski on 5 October 1806, and on 22 October the General met with the Emperor at Dessau. During this audience, Napoleon ordered DƒÖbrowski to go to Pozna≈Ñ and organize regular Polish troops. After four days of preparation, DƒÖbrowski proposed to the French Emperor his plan of forming a Polish army of 40,000 soldiers. To realize this plan, DƒÖbrowski asked to have Polish officers from other Napoleonic units sent to him, and on his special request, J√≥zef Wybicki was designated to become the future head of the civilian authorities. This group heard from Napoleon, who was already in Berlin, that \\"[Poles] have to deserve independence\\" and, when asked whether he would create a Polish State, Napoleon answered: \\"I will see whether the Poles are worthy of being a nation\\". Uprising DƒÖbrowski sent emissaries before him to Pozna≈Ñ, to evaluate the situation. After they returned to the General with the news that the whole \\"region is full of patriotic spirit and joy about the success of the French Army\\", DƒÖbrowski and Wybicki entered the city on 3 November 1806 leading the first units of the French army. Their arrival became a large Polish patriotic demonstration. On this same day, DƒÖbrowski called Poles to stand with arms on Napoleon's side and fight against Prussian occupation. DƒÖbrowski and Wybicki created Voivodship Commissions (Komisja wojew√≥dzka) whose tasks were to take administrative control and keep the area quiet, preventing fights about social and economical issues. DƒÖbrowski's and Wybicki's proclamation was enthusiastically adopted by the bourgeoisie but with reserve by the szlachta. Therefore, in the newly created Pozna≈Ñ Department, Polish units were formed mostly in large urban areas like Pozna≈Ñ, and in the countryside, mobilisation was very slow. In the Kalisz Department, a special Proclamation for this area was announced on 9 November. Large centers of uprising fighters formed in Kalisz and Konin. On 10 November, Polish fighters engaged in battles against Prussian troops near Ostrzesz√≥w and Kƒôpno; then, on 13 November the uprising spread to the area around Sieradz. Poles had the most difficult fighting in the Bydgoszcz Department. As Commander of the newly created Polish units in this region, General Amilkar Kosi≈Ñski had to fight against the largest Prussian troops in Greater Poland on one side and with an uncooperative French intendent on the other one, using troops with very little training or experience. Meanwhile, DƒÖbrowski was already creating a regular army, mobilising one man from each ten cottages, and on 3 December appointed the pospolite ruszenie as auxiliaries to the regular troops. These regular Army units, alongside some irregular uprising troops, cleaned Greater Poland of some pockets of remaining Prussian units. An uprising spread in other regions, and in November, fighters took control over the Jasna G√≥ra fortress. Mainly due to the action of Wybicki at the beginning of January 1807, the regular Polish army, organised like other Napoleon's armies, had 23,000 soldiers (20,000 of them were from the Pozna≈Ñ and Kalisz Departments). The French Emperor stayed in Pozna≈Ñ between 27 November and 12 December 1806. Pomeranian Campaign On 1 January 1807, DƒÖbrowski was near ≈Åowicz, where he received from the hands of Wincenty Krasi≈Ñski a bulawa of hetman Stefan Czarniecki. The great merits of DƒÖbrowski and his popularity among soldiers weren't given much consideration, in the appointment of the Chief of the War Office in the Ruling Commission (szef Dyrekcji Wojny w Komisji RzƒÖdzƒÖcej). J√≥zef Poniatowski, who was unfavourable to DƒÖbrowski, was appointed instead. Napoleon chose him because he wanted to guarantee the cooperation of the Polish aristocracy. A large difference between DƒÖbrowski and Poniatowski was exemplified during the writing of the Polish Army Code. Poniatowski wanted to keep corporal punishment, but DƒÖbrowski loudly opposed against it. To avoid this conflict, Napoleon decided that Polish Army would adopt the French code. On 3 January, French marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier gave the order to existing units of planned divisions of Pozna≈Ñ and Kalisz Departments to form one brigade from each Department. The Commander of the Pozna≈Ñ Brigade was General Wincenty Axamitowski and the Kalisz Brigade was commanded by General Stanis≈Çaw Fiszer. Both brigades of infantry formed a division commanded by general DƒÖbrowski. Brigades were strengthened by 300 Polish cavalry units, in addition to the unit from the Warsaw Department, that were both transformed in a unique regiment of cavalry commanded by the son of Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski ‚Äì Lt. Col. Jan Micha≈Ç DƒÖbrowski. All the units of the new division, that started their march on 7 January, had to meet in Bydgoszcz. Meanwhile, the units commanded by Amilkar Kosi≈Ñski, which had been fighting against regular Prussian troops since December, won the battle of Koronowo and marched to ≈öwiecie, forcing the enemy to leave the town and securing this place of concentration for the newly created division. Before the beginning of the new campaign, the main Polish troops were strengthened and reorganized into three divisions: Pozna≈Ñ Division commanded by J. H. DƒÖbrowski, Kalisz Division commanded by J√≥zef ZajƒÖczek and Warsaw Division commanded by J√≥zef Poniatowski. Kalisz Division was sent to the siege of GrudziƒÖdz and the Warsaw Division moved northwards with the whole French Army in the direction of Danzig. At this time, 6000 soldiers of the Pozna≈Ñ Division stayed near Bydgoszcz and later advanced on Gniezno and Dirschau. Both towns were captured, but the Poles were forced to retreat by Prussian troops. Later on, Poniatowski ordered a part of the pospolite ruszenie that weakened the Pozna≈Ñ Division to disband, which were returned as reinforcements in February 1807. After that, only the troops of Gen. Kosi≈Ñski were fighting in this area. After a reorganization, Pozna≈Ñ Division was composed of 6 battalions of infantry, 3 squadrons of cavalry and 2,000 pospolite ruszenie commanded by Gen. Micha≈Ç Sokolnicki. On 15 February, cavalry again captured Dirschau, but was once again forced to retreat. 8 days later, on 23 February, the whole division attacked the town which was defended by a strong Prussian garrison. After 7 hours of battle, Poles captured Dirschau, but Gen. DƒÖbrowski was wounded, forcing him to leave his division for a while, and his son was badly injured as well. Therefore, J. M. DƒÖbrowski was promoted to the rank of Brigade General and moved to the Invalide Corps. After the battle, Gen. Kosi≈Ñski became the new division commander. Earlier, in January 1807, DƒÖbrowski had formed from the Pozna≈Ñ troops, a Division group commanded by Col. Garczy≈Ñski. This unit captured Schneidem√ºhl, Deutsch Krone and Wielu≈Ñ. February 1807, Garczy≈Ñski's group was subordinated to Gen. Kosi≈Ñski and later, with some troops of pospolite ruszenie, was sent to fight near Neustettin. At this time, the troops of Sokolnicki captured Stolp in Pommern and, later on, took part in the siege of Danzig, which surrendered in May. Also in May, Pozna≈Ñ Division, renamed as 3rd Polish Division, returned under the command of Gen. J. H. DƒÖbrowski. After the capture of Danzig, Polish troops fought also in Masuria, including the battle of Friedland. Aftermath The Pomeranian Campaign was ended by the capitulation of K√∂nigsberg on 15 June 1807, the later treaties of Tilsit and the recognition of the Duchy of Warsaw by the Kingdom of Prussia. However, there was a more immediate effect. By the time of the uprising, the Prussian army, previously thought invincible, had been fought to almost the point of total liquidation. Napoleon had destroyed the majority of the Prussian army only months after the declaration of war, and the only significant force loyal to the Prussian regime left was garrisoning Prussian Poland. These troops were expected to reinforce the Russians and continue fighting the French. With this Polish uprising supported by French military operations, this was no longer possible for the simple reason that outside a handful of Prussian units who managed to escape and join the Russians, the Prussian army had been completely and systematically wiped out. Russia would face France alone.

It is a naturally occurring mold byproduct of Fusarium spp. fungus which is toxic to humans and animals. The clinical condition it causes is alimentary toxic aleukia and a host of symptoms related to organs as diverse as the skin, airway, and stomach. Ingestion may come from consumption of moldy whole grains. T-2 can be absorbed through human skin. Although no significant systemic effects are expected after dermal contact in normal agricultural or residential environments, local skin effects can not be excluded. Hence, skin contact with T-2 should be limited. History Alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA), a disease which is caused by trichothecenes like T-2 mycotoxin, killed many thousands of USSR citizens in the Orenburg District in the 1940s. It was reported that the mortality rate was 10% of the entire population in that area. During the 1970s it was proposed that the consumption of contaminated food was the cause of this mass poisoning. Because of World War II, harvesting of grains was delayed and food was scarce in Russia. This resulted in the consumption of grain that was contaminated with Fusarium molds, which produce T-2 mycotoxin.Pitt, J. L., An introduction to mycotoxins. In Mycotoxin prevention and control in foodgrains, 1989. Although it is still controversial, it is suspected that T-2 mycotoxin has been used as a chemical warfare agent from the 1970s till the 1990s. Based on the descriptions of eyewitnesses and victims, T-2 mycotoxin was mostly delivered by low-flying aircraft that released a yellow oily liquid. Hence, this phenomenon is also named \\"yellow rain\\". In 1982, the US Secretary of State Alexander Haig and his successor George P. Shultz accused the Soviet Union of using T-2 mycotoxin as a chemical weapon in Laos (1975‚Äì81), Kampuchea (1979‚Äì81), and Afghanistan (1979‚Äì81), where it allegedly caused thousands of casualties.Shultz, G. P. Chemical warfare in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan: an update; The United States Secretary Of State: Washington, D.C., 1982. Although several US chemical weapons experts have identified \\"yellow rain\\" samples from Laos as trichothecenes, other experts believe that this exposure was due to naturally occurring T-2 mycotoxin in contaminated foods. A second alternative theory was developed by Harvard biologist Matthew Meselson, who proposed that the \\"yellow rain\\" found in Southeast Asia originates from the excrement of jungle bees.Yellow Rain Falls. The New York Times 3 September 1987. The first indication for this theory came from finding high levels of pollen in the collected samples, giving the substance its yellow color. It was also found that jungle bees in this area fly collectively in great numbers, at altitudes too high to be easily seen, producing showers of feces that could have been mistaken for sprays from aircraft. T-2 mycotoxin is also thought to be a cause of Gulf War Syndrome. US troops suffered from mycotoxicosis-like symptoms after an Iraqi missile detonated in a US military camp in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm in the Persian Gulf War, in 1991. It has been shown that Iraq researched trichothecene mycotoxins, among other substances, and thus was capable of its possession and employment in chemical warfare. Nevertheless, much of the key information from these incidents remains classified, leaving these matters still unresolved.  Chemical properties  This compound has a tetracyclic sesquiterpenoid 12,13-epoxytrichothene ring system, which relates it to the trichothecenes. These compounds are generally very stable and are not degraded during storage/milling and cooking/processing of food. They do not degrade at high temperatures either. This compound has an epoxide ring, and several acetyl and hydroxyl groups on its side chains. These features are mainly responsible for the biological activity of the compound and make it highly toxic. T-2 mycotoxin is able to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis in vivo and in vitroMarin, S.; Ramos, A. J.; Cano-Sancho, G.; Sanchis, V., Mycotoxins: Occurrence, toxicology, and exposure assessment. Food and Chemical Toxicology 2013, 60 (0), 218-237 and can induce apoptosis.Torp, M.; Langseth, W., Production of T-2 toxin by a Fusarium resembling Fusarium poae. Mycopathologia 1999, 147 (2), 89-96. However, in vivo the compound rapidly metabolizes to HT-2 mycotoxin (a major metabolite).Wu, Q. H.; Wang, X.; Yang, W.; Nussler, A. K.; Xiong, L. Y.; Kuca, K.; Dohnal, V.; Zhang, X. J.; Yuan, Z. H., Oxidative stress-mediated cytotoxicity and metabolism of T-2 toxin and deoxynivalenol in animals and humans: an update. Archives of toxicology 2014, 88 (7), 1309-26. Mechanism of action The toxicity of T-2 toxin is due to its 12,13-epoxy ring.Li, Y.; Wang, Z.; Beier, R. C.; Shen, J.; De Smet, D.; De Saeger, S.; Zhang, S., T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin: review of toxicity, metabolism, and analytical methods. Journal of agricultural and food chemistry 2011, 59 (8), 3441-53. Epoxides are in general toxic compounds; these react with nucleophiles and then undergo further enzymatic reactions. The reactivity of epoxides can lead to reactions with endogenous compounds and cellular constituents like DNA bases and proteins.John A. Timbrell, Principles of Biochemical Toxicologie. CRC Press: 2009; Vol. 8. These reactions could be the reason for the noticed actions and effects of T-2 mycotoxin. The toxic compound influences the metabolism of membrane phospholipids, leads to an increase of liver lipid peroxidases and has an inhibiting effect on DNA and RNA synthesis. In addition it can bind to an integral part of the 60s ribosomal subunit, peptidyltransferase, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. These effects are thought to be the explanation for T-2 toxin inducing apoptosis (cell death) in different tissues as the immune system, the gastrointestinal tissue and also fetal tissue. With regard to apoptosis there has been noticed that the level of the pro-apoptotic factor Bas (Bcl-2-associated X protein) was increased and the level of Bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic factor, was decreased in human chrondocytes (cartilage cells). When exposed to T-2 mycotoxin. Furthermore, the level of Fas, an apoptosis- related cell-surface antigen and p53, a protein regulating the cell cycle, were increased. Simplified biosynthesis of the T-2 Mycotoxin in F. sporotrichioides Synthesis T-2 mycotoxin is produced naturally by Fusarium fungi of which the most important species are: F. sporotrichioides, F. langsethiae, F. acuminatum and F. poae. These fungi are found in grains such as barley, wheat and oats. The production of this compound for research and commercial purposes is generally accomplished by cultivating some strain of T-2 mycotoxin producing fungi on agar plates. On these agar plates the fungi appear powdery and can yield substantial amounts of T-2 mycotoxin. For the isolation of the compound high pressure liquid chromatography is commonly used (HPLC).T-2 toxin from fusarium sp., powder, ‚â•98% (HPLC). http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/t4887?lang=en&region;=NL (accessed 25 march). In the Fusarium species, biosynthesis of the T-2 mycotoxin often starts with trichodiene, and many of the species share a common route of oxidizations and cyclizations. As an example, from the F. sporotrichioides species, the important oxidation steps that occur start from trichodiene and goes to isotrichodiol. From there, the eleventh carbon atom is oxidized to form isotrichotriol. The ninth carbon is then oxidized, and trichotriol is formed, which then cyclizes to make isotrichodermol. After that, the fifteenth carbon is oxidized to form didecalonectrin, which leads to the fourth carbon being oxidized, and diacetoxyscirpenol is formed. The second to last step is the oxidation of the eighth carbon to make neosolaniol, which then undergoes slight modification to create the T-2 toxin. Toxicity= ADME Properties  Absorption & Exposure = Humans and animals are generally exposed to T-2 mycotoxins through food. Certain grains can contain the toxin which makes it a threat to human health and an economic burden.Wan, Q.; Wu, G.; He, Q.; Tang, H.; Wang, Y., The toxicity of acute exposure to T-2 toxin evaluated by the metabonomics technique. Molecular BioSystems 2015, 11 (3), 882-91. Unlike most biological toxins T-2 mycotoxin can be absorbed through intact skin. The compound can be delivered via food, water, droplets, aerosols and smoke from various dispersal systems. This makes it a potential biological weapon, however large amounts of the compound are required for a lethal dose. T-2 mycotoxin has an of approximately 1 milligram per kilogram of body weight. The EFSA estimates that the mean exposure of T-2 in the EU lies between 12 and 43 ng/kg bw/day.Escriv√°, L.; Font, G.; Manyes, L., In vivo toxicity studies of fusarium mycotoxins in the last decade: A review. Food and Chemical Toxicology 2015, 78 (0), 185-206. This range is below the TDI of 100 ng/ kg body weight for the sum of HT-2 and T-2 toxins which is used by the EFSA. = Distribution = T-2 mycotoxin is distributed uniformly throughout the body without preference to a specific organ or site. In rodents, plasma concentration levels peak around roughly thirty minutes after exposure, and in one study, the half-life of the T-2 toxin was seen to be less than twenty minutes. In a different study involving pigs, the distribution after four hours of IV injection was seen to be 15-24% in the GI tract and 4.7-5.2% in various other tissues. = Metabolism = Once absorbed and distributed to various tissues, the T-2 mycotoxin goes through various metabolic reactions before it gets excreted. In vivo studies showed that the most occurring reactions are ester hydrolysis and hydroxylation of the isovaleryl group. Deepoxidation and glucuronide conjugation do also occur. Ht-2 is the main metabolite. For the hydroxylation, the cytochrome p450 enzyme complex is suggested to be involved. T-2 triol and T-2 tetraol are most likely to be formed via acetylcholine esterases. Some of the metabolic reactions of the mycotoxin are performed by the microflora in the gut. The formed metabolites in these reactions are species- and pH-dependent. The ester cleavages are however performed by the mammal itself and not by the microflora. In red blood cells T-2 mycotoxin is metabolized to neosolaniol, and, in white blood cells, to HT-2 via hydrolysis catalyzed by carboxylesterases. = Excretion = Following absorption, distribution, and metabolism, T-2 mycotoxin is excreted fairly quickly, where 80-90% of it is excreted within 48 hours. The main methods of excretion seem to be from the urine and feces, where excretion through bile contributes heavily to the feces route of excretion. There is also very little of the parent T-2 mycotoxin in the excretions, meaning most of the initial compound is metabolized beforehand.  Toxic effects  T-2 is highly toxic when inhaled. Acute toxic symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, skin irritation, itching, rash, blisters, bleeding and dyspnea.Kalantari H, M. M., REVIEW ON T-2 TOXIN. Jundishapur Journal of Natural Pharmaceutical Products 2010, 5 (1), 26-38. If the individual is exposed to T-2 over a longer period alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA) develops. At first the patient experiences a burning sensation in the mouth, throat and stomach. After a few days the person will suffer from an acute gastroenteritis that will last for 3 to 9 days. Within 9 weeks the bone marrow will slowly degenerate. Also the skin starts bleeding and the total number of leukocytes decreases. Problems with the nervous system can occur. In the end the following symptoms might occur: a high fever, petechial haemorrhage, necrosis of muscles and skin, bacterial infections of the necrotic tissue, enlarged lymph nodes. There is the possibility of asphyxiation because of laryngeal oedema and stenosis of the glottis. The lack of oxygen is then the cause of death. Otherwise the patient will die of bronchial pneumonia and lung bleeding.R.L. Semple, A. S. F., P.A. Hicks and J.V. Lozare, Mycotoxin prevention and control in foodgrains. UNDP/FAO Regional Network Inter-Country Cooperation on Preharvest Technology and Quality Control of Foodgrains (REGNET) and the ASEAN Grain Postharvest Programme: Thailand, 1989.  Effects on animals  T-2 mycotoxin is also toxic to animals. The compound is known for having lethal and sub-lethal effects on farm animals. It is often found in contaminated cereal grains that are fed to these animals.Cortinovis, C.; Pizzo, F.; Spicer, L. J.; Caloni, F., Fusarium mycotoxins: effects on reproductive function in domestic animals--a review. Theriogenology 2013, 80 (6), 557-64. Most of the toxic effects are shared between humans and animals. After exposing zebra fish embryos to a concentration of 20 ¬µmol/L or higher malformation and mortality rates increased. The malformations included tail deformities, cardiovascular defects and changes in behavior in early stages of life. This is the result of an increase in the amount of epoxides, which causes cell apoptosis.Yuan, G.; Wang, Y.; Yuan, X.; Zhang, T.; Zhao, J.; Huang, L.; Peng, S., T-2 toxin induces developmental toxicity and apoptosis in zebrafish embryos. Journal of environmental sciences 2014, 26 (4), 917-25. Other studies have shown that T-2-toxin causes lipid peroxidation in rats after feeding it to them. As the effect of T-2 toxin, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were observed in several mammalian species. However, in spite of the general harmful effects caused by the toxin, in a study carried out in different chicken derived hepatic cell culture models, no alterations were found in the redox status of the cells Mackei, M.; Orb√°n, K.; Moln√°r, A.; P√°l, L.; Dublecz, K.; Husv√©th, F.; Neogr√°dy, Z.; M√°tis, G. Cellular Effects of T-2 Toxin on Primary Hepatic Cell Culture Models of Chickens. Toxins 2020, 12, 46. https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins12010046. The compound also seems to reduce the fertility of ewes and heifers. Research has shown that a high dose of T-2 delays the ovulation due to a delayed follicle maturation. This possibly retards the following luteinisation, which makes it impossible for female animals to conceive. T-2 also has an effect on the fertility of bulls. In 1998 it was discovered that moldy hay influenced the quality of semen of bulls. Analysis of the moldy hay showed that T-2 was present. The compound decreased sperm motility and testosterone levels and increased the frequency of morphological abnormalities in the sperm cells. The liver is another target for the mycotoxin. It is one of the first organs where the compound passes through after ingestion. Here it causes a reduced expression of CYP1A proteins in rabbits, pigs and rats. CYP3A activity decreases in pigs too. These enzymes help metabolize drugs that pass through the liver. Decrease in the activity could lead to an increase of unmetabolized drugs in the plasma. This can have a dangerous effect on an animal's health.Goossens, J.; De Bock, L.; Osselaere, A.; Verbrugghe, E.; Devreese, M.; Boussery, K.; Van Bocxlaer, J.; De Backer, P.; Croubels, S., The mycotoxin T-2 inhibits hepatic cytochrome P4503A activity in pigs. Food and Chemical Toxicology 2013, 57, 54-6. All of the mentioned effects happen when T-2 is ingested in high doses. Animals are able to metabolize the compound with enzymes from the CYP3A family, just like humans.  Treatments  At the moment, there is no specific therapy for T-2 mycotoxin poisonings. Exposure of the mycotoxin is typically followed by standardized treatment for toxic compounds in order to reduce the effect of the toxin. This includes using activated charcoal, which has a high binding capacity of 0.48 mg of T-2 mycotoxin to 1 mg of charcoal. For dermal contact, soap and water is used to reduce the dermal effects. As a kind of prophylaxis, antioxidants are believed to have properties that may provide benefits.  Application  There are currently no applications, aside from war, for T-2 mycotoxins; however, there are some plausible therapeutic uses. Due to their abilities, research shows possible uses for the mycotoxin as growth promoters, antibiotics, antivirals, as an antileukemic, and as an antimalarial.

World War I Following commissioning, Ammen was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She operated with the Torpedo Flotilla along the east coast. Upon the outbreak of World War I in Europe in 1914, Ammen began neutrality patrols and escort duty along the east coast. After the United States entered the conflict in April 1917, Ammen sailed for the Bahamas on a reconnaissance mission. When she returned to the United States, the destroyer entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 6 May to be fitted out for overseas service. Ammen was assigned to Division 9, Destroyer Force, and sailed on 18 June for St. Nazaire, France. After the arrival of the convoy at St. Nazaire on 2 July, Ammen proceeded to Queenstown, Ireland, and was attached to American naval forces based there. The ship carried out convoy escort duty between Ireland and France, patrolled off the Irish coast for enemy submarines, and went to the aid of vessels in distress. Ammen returned to the United States in January 1919. She made a cruise to the Gulf of Mexico before going out of commission at Philadelphia on 11 December 1919. The vessel was designated DD-35 on 17 July 1920. Inter-war period Ammen remained at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania until 28 April 1924, when she was transferred to the Coast Guard, in whose hands she was redesignated CG-8. Ammen was one of 20 destroyers that formed the Coast Guard Offshore Patrol Force, established to help suppress bootlegging. On 22 May 1931, Ammen was returned to the Navy, but she performed no further active service. Her name was dropped on 1 July 1933, and thereafter she was referred to as DD-35.

It is home to the Sentinelese, an indigenous people in voluntary isolation who have rejected, often violently, any contact with the outside world. They are among the last tribal people to remain virtually untouched by modern civilisation. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Act of 1956 prohibits travel to the island and any approach closer than five nautical miles (9.26 km) in order to prevent the resident tribespeople from contracting diseases to which they have no immunity. The area is patrolled by the Indian Navy. Nominally, the island belongs to the South Andaman administrative district, part of the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In practice, Indian authorities recognise the islanders' desire to be left alone and restrict their role to remote monitoring; they do not prosecute them for killing people.Bonnett, Alastair: Off The Map, page 82. Carreg Aurum Press, 2014 The island is a protected area of India. In 2018, the Government of India excluded 29 islands ‚Äì including North Sentinel ‚Äì from the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) regime, until 31 December 2022, in a major effort to boost tourism. In November 2018, however, the government's home ministry stated that the relaxation of the prohibition was intended only to allow researchers and anthropologists, with pre-approved clearance, to visit the Sentinel islands. The Sentinelese have repeatedly attacked approaching vessels. This resulted in the deaths of two fishermen in 2006 and a US missionary, John Allen Chau, in 2018. Geography North Sentinel lies west of the town of Wandoor in South Andaman Island, west of Port Blair, and north of its counterpart South Sentinel Island. It has an area of about and a roughly square outline. North Sentinel is surrounded by coral reefs, and lacks natural harbours. The entire island, other than the shore, is forested. There is a narrow, white-sand beach encircling the island, behind which the ground rises , and then gradually to between and near the centre. Reefs extend around the island to between from the shore. A forested islet, Constance Island, also \\"Constance Islet\\", is located about off the southeast coastline, at the edge of the reef. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake tilted the tectonic plate under the island, lifting it by . Large tracts of the surrounding coral reefs were exposed and became permanently dry land or shallow lagoons, extending all the island's boundaries‚Äîby as much as on the west and south sides‚Äîand uniting Constance Islet with the main island. History The Onge, one of the other indigenous peoples of the Andamans, were aware of North Sentinel Island's existence; their traditional name for the island is Chia daaKwokweyeh. They also have strong cultural similarities with what little has been remotely observed amongst the Sentinelese. However, Onges brought to North Sentinel Island by the British during the 19th century could not understand the Sentinelese language, so a significant period of separation is likely. British visits British surveyor John Ritchie observed \\"a multitude of lights\\" from an East India Company hydrographic survey vessel, the Diligent, as it passed by the island in 1771. Homfray, an administrator, travelled to the island in March 1867. Towards the end of the same year's summer monsoon season, Nineveh, an Indian merchant ship, was wrecked on a reef near the island. The 106 surviving passengers and crewmen landed on the beach in the ship's boat and fended off attacks by the Sentinelese. They were eventually found by a Royal Navy rescue party. = Portman's expeditions = An expedition led by Maurice Vidal Portman, a government administrator who hoped to research the natives and their customs, landed on North Sentinel Island in January 1880. The group found a network of pathways and several small, abandoned villages. After several days, six Sentinelese, an elderly couple and four children, were kidnapped and taken to Port Blair. The colonial officer in charge of the operation wrote that the entire group, > \\"sickened rapidly, and the old man and his wife died, so the four children > were sent back to their home with quantities of presents\\". A second landing was made by Portman on 27 August 1883 after the eruption of Krakatoa was mistaken for gunfire and interpreted as the distress signal of a ship. A search party landed on the island and left gifts before returning to Port Blair. Portman visited the island several more times between January 1885 and January 1887. After Indian independence Landsat map Indian exploratory parties under orders to establish friendly relations with the Sentinelese made brief landings on the island every few years beginning in 1967. In 1975 Leopold III of Belgium, on a tour of the Andamans, was taken by local dignitaries for an overnight cruise to the waters off North Sentinel Island. The cargo ship MV Rusley ran aground on coastal reefs in mid-1977, and the MV Primrose did so in August 1981. The Sentinelese are known to have scavenged both wrecks for iron. Settlers from Port Blair also visited the sites to recover the cargo. In 1991, salvage operators were authorised to dismantle the ships. After the Primrose grounded on the North Sentinel Island reef on 2 August 1981, crewmen several days later noticed that some men carrying spears and arrows were building boats on the beach. The captain of Primrose radioed for an urgent drop of firearms so his crew could defend themselves. They did not receive any because a large storm stopped other ships from reaching them, but the heavy seas also prevented the islanders from approaching the ship. A week later, the crewmen were rescued by a helicopter under contract to the Indian Oil And Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). The first peaceful contact with the Sentinelese was made by Triloknath Pandit, a director of the Anthropological Survey of India, and his colleagues on 4 January 1991. Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997. The Sentinelese survived the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and its after-effects, including the tsunami and the uplifting of the island. Three days after the earthquake, an Indian government helicopter observed several islanders, who shot arrows and threw spears and stones at the helicopter. Although the tsunami disturbed the tribal fishing grounds, the Sentinelese appear to have adapted. In January 2006, two fishermen fishing illegally in prohibited waters were killed by the Sentinelese when their boat drifted too close to the island. There were no prosecutions. In November 2018, John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old US missionary trained and sent by Missouri-based All Nations, was killed during an illegal trip to the restricted island, planning to preach Christianity to the Sentinelese. Seven individuals were taken into custody by Indian police on suspicion of helping Chau's illegal access to the island. Entering a radius of around the island is illegal under Indian law. Fishermen told police that they had seen the tribespeople dragging Chau's body around but the authorities had not been able to independently verify his death as of 25 November 2018. The case is being treated as a murder but there has been no suggestion that the tribesmen would be charged. Chau's journal indicated he was aware of the risks he faced, having been shot at by an islander with a bow and arrow on a previous attempted visit, and of the illegality of his visits to the island. In a final note to his family sent via the fishermen, Chau wrote > \\"You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to > declare Jesus to these people. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I > get killed ...\\" The family is not insisting on the return of the body to the US. Demographics North Sentinel Island is inhabited by the Sentinelese. Their population was estimated to be between 50 and 400 people in a 2012 report. India's 2011 census indicates 15 residentscensus, archive.org; accessed 2 April 2017. in 10 households, but that too was merely an estimate, described as a \\"wild guess\\" by the Times of India. They reject any contact with other people, and are among the last people to remain virtually untouched by modern civilisation. The population faces the potential threats of infectious diseases to which they have no immunity, as well as violence from intruders. The Indian government has declared the entire island and its surrounding waters extending 5 nautical miles (9.26 km) from the island to be an exclusion zone. Political status The Andaman and Nicobar (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956 provides protection to the Sentinelese and other native tribes in the region. The Andaman and Nicobar Administration stated in 2005 that they have no intention to interfere with the lifestyle or habitat of the Sentinelese and are not interested in pursuing any further contact with them or governing the island. Although North Sentinel Island is not legally an autonomous administrative division of India, scholars have referred to it and its people as effectively autonomous, or independent.Ed.

Through marriage to Vladimir II Monomakh Gytha became a Grand Princess consort of Kievan Rus'.Zajac, 'Marriage,' p. 722. Life According to the thirteenth-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, after the death of their father Harold Godwinson (d. 1066), Gytha and two of her brothers (probably Magnus, son of Harold Godwinson and one of Godwin and Edmund) escaped to the court of their first cousin once-removed, King Sweyn Estridsson of Denmark.Mason, House of Godwine, p. 199. The two brothers were treated by Sweyn with hospitality, Magnus entering into high-level service with Boles≈Çaw II the Generous while their sister was married to Waldemar, King of Ruthenia, i.e. Vladimir II Monomakh, one of the most famous rulers of Kievan Rus.Saxo Grammaticus, Gesta Danorum, vol. 2, 798‚Äì 801; Mason, House of Godwine, p. 200. This took place in 1069/1070 when Boles≈Çaw restored Grand Prince Iziaslav I of Kiev and Gertruda (Boles≈Çaw's aunt) to power after they had been deposed. Gytha's role in Vladimir‚Äôs rule isn't documented. Vladimir explained in a book of 'Instructions' (Pouchenie) for his sons, written in the twelfth-century: ‚ÄúLove your wives, but grant them no power over you.‚ÄùZajac, ‚ÄòThe social-political roles of the princess,‚Äô p. 125, citing The Povƒïst‚Äô Vremennykh Lƒït: An Interlinear Collation and Paradosis, ed., D.

Gytha was the mother of Mstislav the Great, the last ruler of united Kievan Rus. In the Norse sagas, Mstislav is called Harald, after his grandfather. The patericon of St. Pantaleon Cloister in Cologne says that \\"Gytha the Queen\\" (Gida regina) died as a nun on 10 March.Necrologium Sanctis Pantalaeonis Coloniensis, p. 18 (VI ides of March). A year later Vladimir Monomakh married another woman. Children With Vladimir, Gytha had several children, including:Mason, House of Godwine, p. 200. #Mstislav the Great (1076‚Äì1132) #Izyaslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Kursk (‚Ä† 6 September 1096) #Svyatoslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Smolensk and Pereyaslav (‚Ä† 16 March 1114) #Yaropolk II of Kiev (‚Ä† 18 February 1139) #Viacheslav I of Kiev (‚Ä† 2 February 1154) Legacy Through her son Mstislav the Great she was an ancestor of both Philippa of Hainault and King Edward III of England, hence of all subsequent English and British monarchs. According to Russian politician and historian Vladimir Medinsky, Gytha was a significant influence on Monomakh's public relations: \\"Knyaz's English wife wasn't wasted\\". As a source, Medinsky quotes M. P. Akekseev's comparative analysis between Monomakh writings' and Alfred the Great's, and other anonymous then contemporary Anglo-Saxon texts.

Biography Hermelin was born into an aristocratic family in Svanshals, √ñdesh√∂g Municipality, √ñsterg√∂tland County and had a traditional education, at the end of which he spent a couple of years at the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Uppsala, which he left without taking a degree. Already at this stage he seems to have developed a taste for alcohol, which later became an addiction, with drastic lifelong consequences. After an unsuccessful attempt at farming on a family estate, he began a wandering life abroad. In 1883 he went to the United States and eked out a living as a teacher, a carpenter, and a soldier, before returning to Europe in 1885. In 1886, he traveled to England and joined the British army as a soldier in the Middlesex Regiment (under the name of Thomas Edward Hallan). He went with his regiment to India in the following year. However, his army career in India proved a failure. He was much troubled by disease, and by then his drinking had developed into full-blown alcoholism, possibly in combination with the use of narcotic drugs. Nevertheless, he spent time on language studies, obviously in preparation for one of the language examinations that formed part of the British administrative system in India. He states that he learnt Hindustani (i.e., Urdu) and also started to learn Persian. There is, however, no record showing that he had passed any examination in these subjects. In later years he occasionally referred to his Indian \\"Monshi,\\" and it is also likely that he had his first encounters with Sufism at that time. In April 1893 he was finally discharged from the army \\"with ignominy,\\" i.e., for disciplinary reasons. After that he became an even more intrepid traveler, going to England and America (including Jamaica) and then back to Sweden, where he again tried his hand at farming. His aristocratic family found his alcoholism and disorderly life unacceptable and had him declared officially unfit to manage his life, and in 1897 he was placed under the care of a guardian. Regardless of this injunction, he went abroad again and lived in Australia and, possibly, America, earning a living through sundry occupations. He turned up in London in the autumn of 1907 and returned to Sweden in early 1908. In the autumn of the same year he was taken into a lunatic asylum in Stockholm, and in February 1909 he was moved to the asylum of St. Lars in Lund, where he spent the rest of his life. He never married. Writing works There is no concrete evidence of any literary production from his years of travel, but he turned to reading and writing when he was confined to the asylum in Lund. He began as a conservative and patriotic writer of verses, commentaries, and translations in local daily newspapers; but through his reading of, among others, the English socialist Robert Blatchford, he gradually adopted a more liberal and even radical attitude. Soon he was attracted by mysticism, first of all by Emanuel Swedenborg, whose works he started to translate. Then he turned to the Christian quietism and mysticism of Jakob B√∂hme, who remained one of his main inspirations. In this context he resumed his Persian studies and also started to learn Hebrew. Against all odds, with repeated lapses into alcoholism and deep depressions, he began a new career as an author and translator. His first publication (Uppsala, 1913) was a Swedish translation of an English work by Alexander Whyte on Jakob B√∂hme. In 1918 two volumes of translations from works by B√∂hme appeared in print, and the same year saw his first publication of a Swedish translation from Persian, the Bustan of Sa'di, possibly first encountered by him when he was preparing for his Persian examination in India some thirty years earlier. It was the first in a long series of Persian translations of classical Persian literature by his hand. In the period 1918-43 he published no less than 23 volumes, altogether more than 8000 pages, of such translations. After the Golestan came an anthology of robaiyyat and mathnawiyyat, then Shabestari's Golshan-e raz, the Robaiyyyat of Khayyam, an abridged version of Sana'i's Hadiqat-al-haqiqa and the Anwar-e sohayli of Wa'ez Kashefi. However, the greatest achievement of Hermelin was his translation of works by Farid al-din 'Attar and Jalal-al-Din Rumi. Both Farid al-din 'Attar's Pand-nama and his Manteq al-tayr appeared in print in 1929, his Tazkerat al-awlia in four volumes in 1931-43, and the Masnawi of Jalal al- Din Rumi in six volumes in 1933-39. In between he also published translations of excerpts from the Shah-nama and the full texts of the Kalila o Demna and Nizami's Eskandar-nama. Thanks to Hermelin's prodigious output, there were already in the 1940s more translations of classical Persian literature available in Swedish than in most other European languages. The impact of these translations was, however, fairly limited. As a patient in a lunatic asylum, he remained a marginal figure, and most of his translations were printed privately, paid for by the family. Furthermore, he had an old- fashioned, and at times even odd and idiosyncratic, style in Swedish. He made liberal use of capitals for emphasis and excelled in some quasi-etymological erroneous conjectures (such as substituting 'Omr (\\"life\\") for 'Omar Khayyam). On the whole however, his translations are reliable and exact, only occasionally misinterpreting phraseology not easily found in the standard works of reference available to him (Salemann-Zhukovski's Grammar and Francis Joseph Steingass's Dictionary, etc.). At times his style acquires a strong and original, even prophetic, ring that made it especially attractive to poets and writers, such as Vilhelm Ekelund, Hjalmar Gullberg and Gunnar Ekel√∂f. Similarly, the very personal kind of mysticism that he developed through the years has had more impact as a literary model than as an exegesis of Sufism. His work strikes a grandiose but solitary chord in Swedish writing and Persian scholarship of the 20th century. In 1943 Eric Hermelin received the Imperial Order of the Lion and the Sun from Masud Ansari, the representative of the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, in Stockholm.

It is capital of the district Freudenstadt. The closest population centres are Offenburg to the west (approx. 36 km away) and T√ºbingen to the east (approx. 47 km away). The city lies on a high plateau at the east edge of the north Black Forest, and is well known for its fresh air. Its city centre is famous as the largest market place in Germany. After Horb, it is the second largest city of the Freudenstadt district. The city has an administration partnership with the communities Bad Rippoldsau-Schapbach and Seewald. Freudenstadt is a climatic health resort of international renown. In the 19th and 20th centuries, visitors of note included George V of the United Kingdom, the Queen of Sweden, John D. Rockefeller, and even the American writer Mark Twain. With its many hotels and guest houses, and its high-class cuisine, Freudenstadt remains a popular vacation spot for Germans from every part of the country. Among the many Germans of note who considered Freudenstadt a second home was the justice inspector Friedrich Kellner whose WWII diary is the subject of a Canadian documentary.  History  Since 1535 a monastery church existed in Kniebis. The building of Freudenstadt was ordered by duke Frederick of W√ºrttemberg in 1599. The designer was architect Heinrich Schickhardt. In 1799 the monastery in Kniebis was burned down by the French. Because of the W√ºrttemberg foundation Freudenstadt was almost entirely Protestant for a long time. The young church belonged to the dean's office respectively church district Herrenberg within the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg. Third Reich and World War II In World War II, on the nearly 1,000 meter high Kniebis, not far from the Alexanderschanze, a Command Center of the Armed Forces was built to defend the Western Front: the F√ºhrer's headquarter Tannenberg. Heavy Anti-aircraft warfare positions with the associated supply and accommodation buildings were built in the area as part of the LVZ West (Western Air Defense Zone), especially on the Schliffkopf and the Hornisgrinde. In the Freudenstadt hospital many wounded were treated. Hitler's one-week visit to Tannenberg and Freudenstadt in 1940 (after the French campaign) at the inauguration of the headquarter was propaganda, which was reported in news reels. Thus, Freudenstadt including the nearby region in France has become a symbol of the Nazi regime and the French defeat, which in 1945 was to play an important role. On 16 April 1945, three weeks before the war ended, the city was unexpectedly attacked by the troops of the 1st French army under General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. There was a large-scale destruction caused by bombing and shelling. Freudenstadt fell, with interruptions, for about 16 hours under artillery fire. No residents dared to go to meet the French troops to surrender the city, conversely the French troops expected considerable military resistance. Since the water main line was destroyed by US air strikes and the main fire trucks had been destroyed by shelling, the fire could spread very well.Hans Rommel: Vor zehn Jahren 16./17. April 1945 ‚Äì Wie es zur Zerst√∂rung von Freudenstadt gekommen ist. In: Freudenst√§dter Heimatbl√§tter. Beiheft 1 Freudenstadt: Oskar Kaupert 1955 56 A handover took place only when the French troops had advanced to the town hall.Der deutsche S√ºdwesten zur Stunde Null. Zusammenbruch und Neuanfang im Jahr 1945 in Dokumenten und Bildern. (paper back) Generallandesarchiv Karlsruhe (author). Publisher: Karlsruhe, Harschdruck, (1 January 1975) There were several dozen civilian casualties; about 600 buildings, 95 percent of the entire city, were destroyed directly or indirectly in the night from 16 to 17 April and 1,400 families afterwards were homeless. During the invasion of the French troops, and in the next three days there were many violent attacks by Moroccan units. According to doctor Renate Lutz alone in her treatment have been more than 600 raped women. On remonstrances civilians got the answer, according to reports from witnesses, it was war, Freudenstadt must burn three days. Many of the remaining buildings were then claimed by the French occupation troops. Many families lived in makeshift roofed cellars. Overall, the average living space per inhabitant was reduced to less than eight square meters. The need was great, and the cleanup of the debris was initially slow. Main sights Market place and city church Market place (Freudenstadt) The market place, flanked by arcaded houses, is the largest market place in Germany. The Rathaus (Town Hall), at the market place, houses the museum of local history. On the south side of the market place is the Evangelical Lutheran Church, with its green tower roofs. It was built between 1601 and 1608, and is considered the most significant building of Freudenstadt. It was built in the Gothic/Renaissance style. The Friedrichsturm (Frederick's Tower) is a 25m high tower which is built 799m above sea level on the Kienberg. It was built of red sandstone from the northern Black Forest in 1899 for the 300 year anniversary of Freudenstadt. On days with a clear sky it offers a view over the whole Murg valley,a view over Dornstetten and Schopfloch. Cultural and social life The following social institutions are present: The children's and youth workshop EIGEN-SINN aims to promote personal, social and academic skills of children and adolescents in social group work. The Erlacher H√∂he is committed to ensure that people will have respect and value in social need and to reduce social exclusion. The Diakonisches Werk works for the poor, marginalized and disadvantaged. In children's center Freudenstadt (KiJuz) open child and youth work is offered for primary school children and adolescents. The Catholic young community (KJG) Freudenstadt is involved in child and youth work. Regional daily newspapers are the Schwarzw√§lder Bote and the Neckar Chronik of the S√ºdwest Presse. Economics The value added comes in 2006 from the service sector (54,2%), the manufacturing industry (45,0%) and from agriculture (0,8%). 2007 were in the urban area 2,832 guest beds available. The number of overnight stays was 339,292. The manufacturing sector is located mainly in the industrial areas. Particularly significant are the Gebr√ºder Schmid (photovoltaic, printed circuit boards, flat panel displays), the Robert B√ºrkle (equipment for surface finishing), the company Georg Oest mineral (mineral oil, gas stations, mechanical engineering). Roads Due to the central location in the Black Forest, four federal roads lead through Freudenstadt. At the market place the B 28 (Kehl-Ulm) meets the B 462 (Rastatt-Rottweil). Here ends also the B 500 (Baden-Baden-Freudenstadt). Since 1985, the B 294 from Bretten to Gundelfingen bypasses Freudenstadt in a north‚Äìsouth direction.Stra√üenbaubericht 1985 (PDF; 4,5 MB) Bus and train Freudenstadt is the starting point of three railway lines. In 1879 construction of the Eutingen im G√§u‚ÄìFreudenstadt railway connected the city to the railway network. It runs from Stuttgart over Herrenberg and Eutingen im G√§u to Freudenstadt. Because continuation into the Kinzig valley was already planned (and as part of the Kinzig Valley Railway was carried out in 1886), the main station was built southeast of the city, relatively far from the center. In 1901 the W√ºrttemberg part of the Murg Valley Railway to Klosterreichenbach was built. The 60-meter higher Stadtbahnhof north of the center is a Standardized railway station. In 1928, a direct connection to Rastatt (Baden) was established . Eutingen and Stuttgart are connected with the G√§ubahn. There is a rail service every hour with consolidations in school transport. Since 2006, coming from Karlsruhe, S41 goes every two hours about Freudenstadt up to Eutingen where is connection to the Regional Express (RE) Stuttgart-Singen. The connection to Offenburg is via the Kinzig Valley Railway. The trains of the Ortenau-S-Bahn (OSB), connect Freudenstadt hourly over Alpirsbach, Schiltach and Hausach to Offenburg. The central bus station (ZOB) with more than 40 bus lines is a main transport hub in the Black Forest. City buses run to destinations in the urban core. Public transport to towns in neighboring districts, such as to Oberndorf, Wolfach, Altensteig or Dornhahn. On the nights of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays an overnight bus service completes the night rail service. Administration Freudenstadt is home of the Amtsgericht, which belongs to the court Rottweil and the superior court Stuttgart. It is the seat of the district office of the homonymous district and home to the majority of its administrative authorities. There is also a notary and a tax office. It is the seat of the church district Freudenstadt of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg. Education The schools sponsored by the city are on the one hand the Kepler-Gymnasium and the Kepler secondary school. Southeast towards the central station is the Falken- Realschule, not far away from the Hartranft Elementary School. The Theodor- Gerhard-primary school with integrated Werkrealschule as a second primary school of the main town is located opposite to the Kepler schools. Among the schools sponsored by the district are the Eduard-Spranger-School, a business school with an economic high school, the Heinrich-Schickhardt school as industrial and technical school with a technical high school and Luise B√ºchner School as domestic school with a nutritional scientific school. The Christopher's School, a special school, is found north the building yard.

It is one of the oldest cities in the state, in east-central India. Ambikapur is also the divisional headquarters of Surguja Division which consists of the five districts of Surguja, Koriya, Balrampur, Surajpur and Jashpur. Ambikapur was the capital of the Princely state of Surguja before Indian Independence. The name of the city is derived from the Hindu goddess Ambika (Mahamaya) Devi, who is the central figure of worship in the area. Ambikapur is the 8th biggest city in Chhattisgarh. As of Swachh Survekshan 2019, Ambikapur was the second Cleanest cities of India. As of Swachh Survekshan 2020, Ambikapur is the cleanest city of Chhattisgarh as well as the cleanest city in India amongst all the cities with a population of 1 to 10 lakhs.  Geography  Ambikapur is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc ‚Äì Ambikapur It has an average elevation of 623 metres (2078 feet). The district is spread over a forest-rich area of 22,237 km¬≤. Most of the district's terrain is forested and hilly. Natural resources include bauxite, forest products and paddy crops. Climate Land  The land is classified into six categories. About 41.67% is under agriculture, while about 5.70% remains fallow. A further 11.44% of the land could be brought under cultivation by improvements in farming techniques and reclamation of marginal areas . A further 1.27% is barren and uncultivated while 33.09% is forest cover and 6.83% is covered by buildings, roads and other infrastructure. This distribution of cultivated land reflects the patterns and intensity of early agricultural practices and the extent of the population, combined with physical factors. Areas with a high concentration of cultivated land are generally those with longer histories of settlement and agricultural use. In the Ambikapur block 74.51% of the total geographical area is cultivated. Demographics 2011 census, Ambikapur municipal corporation had a population of 264,575 and the urban agglomeration had a population of 343,173. The municipality had a sex ratio of 920 females per 1,000 males and 11.3% of the population was under six years old. Effective literacy was 88.20%; male literacy was 92.73% and female literacy was 83.29%. Ambikapur is inhabited by people from across India. Moderate weather makes it an attractive place for settlement. Unlike the capital, the district population comprises aboriginal populations including the Pandos and Korwas, who still live in rural areas. Ambikapur is home to a large number of Tibetan migrants who took refuge in India after the Chinese annexation of Tibet in 1959.  Government and politics  The city is part of the Sarguja Lok Sabha constituency represented by Member of Parliament Renuka Singh from the BJP, and in the state assembly through the Ambikapur Assembly constituency, represented by MLA T.S. Deo from the Indian National Congress.  Civic administration  The city is governed by the Municipal Corporation of Ambikapur or Nagar Nigam Ambikapur. The municipal corporation has two parts, elected body and administrative body. The elected body is headed by the Mayor Ajay Tirkey from the Indian National Congress. The administrative body is headed by the Municipal commissioner Mr. Luvkush Singrol. The city is divided into 48 wards and each ward is represented by a councillor directly elected by the people from the ward. The mayor of the city is elected indirectly from amongst the councillors. Ambikapur segregates 90% of its waste  Civic utilities  Electricity is supplied by the state's Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution Company Limited. Drinking water was initially sourced from the Banki Dam, but after pipeline expansion and construction of an automatic filter plant in Katkalo under the AMRUT scheme, in 2020 will also be sourced from the Ghughutta Dam in Nawagarh. The city has a total of 16 tanks for this purpose. Ambikapur generates 45 metric ton solid waste everyday, 90% of which is segregated through a decentralised waste management model. It has no landfills and has been declared a zero-waste city since it converted its 15-acre landfill into a park in 2016. Transport Ambikapur Railway Station Front Rail Ambikapur is connected to the Anuppur railway junction, a bordering town in Madhya Pradesh, by a broad gauge railway. Trains reach Ambikapur from Katni, Satna, Jabalpur, Durg, Bhopal and the state capital Raipur. More destinations, such as New Delhi, can be reached from Anuppur railway junction.

While the main fighting was concentrated in the Greater Poland region, fights also occurred in other part of the Prussian Partition of Poland, and protests were held in Polish inhabited regions of Silesia. Background=1772‚Äì1807 While the Kingdom of Prussia already possessed a large Polish population in Upper Silesia, it gained additional Polish citizens during the partitions of Poland. From the beginnings of Prussian rule, Poles were subject to a series of measures aimed against them and their culture; the Polish language was replaced by German as the official language,Andrzej Chwalba - Historia Polski 1795-1918 Wydawnictwo Literackie 2000 Krak√≥w pages 175-184, 307-312 and most administration was made German as well; the Prussian ruler Frederick the Great despised Poles and hoped to replace them with Germans. Poles were portrayed as 'backward Slavs' by Prussian officials who wanted to spread German language and culture. The land of Polish nobility was confiscated and given to German nobles. Frederick the Great settled around 300,000 colonists in the Eastern provinces of Prussia and aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility by increasing the German population and trying to reduce Polish owned land. \\"In fact from Hitler to Hans we find frequent references and Jews as Indians. This, too, was a long standing trope. It can be traced back to Frederick the Great, who likened the 'slovenly Polish trash' in newly' reconquered West Prussia to Iroquois\\".

Anna Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and Wojciech Roszkowski The Poles were freed from Prussians with the arrival of Napoleon, and started a successful uprising against the Prussian forces in 1806. 1815‚Äì1831 The Prussian hold on Polish areas was somewhat weakened after 1807 where parts of its partition were restored to Duchy of Warsaw. The power status of Prussia was dependent on hindering any form of Polish statehood, due to crucial position of Greater Poland, Silesia and Pomeranian-all areas inhabited either by Polish majority or substantial Polish population; it didn't support Polish attempts at restoration of Poland during Congress of Vienna, where Prussia tried to gain Duchy of Warsaw or at least its western provinces. In 1815 the Prussian king made several guarantees in his speech to Poles in the newly formed Grand Duchy of Posen (created out of territories of Duchy of Warsaw) in regards to rights of Polish language and cultural institutions. In order to ensure loyalty of the newly re-conquered territories the Prussians engaged in several propaganda gestures hoping they would be enough to gain land-owners and aristocracy support.Jerzy Zdrada - Historia Polski 1795-1918 Warsaw, Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN 2007; pages 268, 273-291, 359-370 The base support of Prussian rule was from influx of German colonists, officials and tradesmen, whose immigration started in 1772 due to Partitions of Poland and while it was halted in 1806, it soon was reinstated after 1815 as planned systemic action of Prussian government. The Prussians knew exactly that Polish aspirations were involved with independence, however they were considering at the time two different methods to subdue Polish resistance. One advocated ruthless Germanization of the Polish provinces, the other pursued by Chancellor Hardenberg wanted to gain support of Polish higher classes, while turning them away from Russian Tsar Alexander I. Initially the position of the Chancellor prevailed. At the same time Prussians and Russians through secret police worked together against Polish movements that would seek independence either from Russia or Prussia, and Prussian representative in Warsaw helped to create political climate that would abolish constitutional freedoms in Congress Poland. The situation in Polish areas of Prussia was calmed down after series of proclamations and assuring the Polish right to their education, religion and traditions. In the end, the Polish rights were defined very narrowly, and Prussia started to abolish the Polish language in administration, schooling, and courts. In 1819 the gradual elimination of Polish language in schools began, with German being introduced in its place. This procedure was briefly stopped in 1822 but restarted in 1824. In 1825 August Jacob, a politician hostile to Poles, gained power over newly created Provincial Educational Collegium in Poznan. Across the Polish territories Polish teachers were being removed from work, German educational programs were being introduced, and primary schooling was being replaced by German one that aimed at creation of loyal Prussian citizens. Already in 1816 the Polish gymnasium in Bydgoszcz was turned into a German school and Polish language removed from classes. In 1825 the Teacher‚Äôs Seminary in Bydgoszcz was Germanized as well While in 1824 a Provincial Parliament was invoked in Greater Poland, the representation was based on wealth census, meaning that the end result gave most of the power to German minority in the area. Even when Poles managed to issue calls asking for enforcing of the guarantees formulated in treaties of Congress of Vienna and proclamations of Prussian King in 1815 they were rejected by Prussia. Thus neither the attempt to create Polish University in Pozna≈Ñ or Polish Society of Friends of Agriculture, Industry and Education were accepted by authorities. Nevertheless, Poles continued to ask for Polish representation in administration of the area, representing the separate character of the Duchy, keeping the Polish character of schools. From 1825 the increase of anti-Polish policies became more visible and intense. Prussian political circles demanded end to tolerance of Polishness. Among the Poles two groups emerged, one still hoping for respect of separate status of the Duchy and insisting on working with Prussian authorities hoping that in time they would grant some freedoms. The other faction still hoped for independence of Poland. As consequence many Polish activists were imprisoned. A joint operation of Russian and Prussian secret police managed to discover Polish organizations working in Breslau and Berlin, whose members were arrested and detained in Prussian jails. 1830‚Äì1848 Intensification of anti-Polish policies started from 1830 onwards. As the November Uprising in Russian-held Congress Poland began, Prussians closely worked with Russia in regards to stopping any Polish independence drive. A state of emergency was introduced in the Duchy, police surveillance started on a large scale and 80,000 soldiers were moved into the area. The Prussian Foreign Minister openly declared that Prussia would oppose independence of Poland as it would mean territories taken in the Partitions of Poland could be claimed by it. Russians soldiers fighting Poles received food supplies, equipment, and intelligence from Prussia. While Prussian generals even wanted to march into Congress Poland, the threat of French intervention stopped those plans. The administrator of the region became Eduard Heinrich Flotwell, a self-declared enemy of Poles, who openly called for Germanization and superiority of German culture over Polish people. Supported by Karl Grolman, a Prussian general, a program was presented that envisioned removing Poles from all offices, courts, judiciary system, and local administration, controlling the clergy, and making peasants loyal through enforced military service. Schools were to be Germanized as well. Those plans were supported by such prominent public figures such as Clauswitz, Gneisenau, Theodor von Schon, and Wilhelm von Humbold. By 1830 the right to use Polish in courts and institutions was no longer respected. While the Poles constituted the majority of population in the area, they held only 4 out of 21 official posts of higher level. From 1832 they could no longer hold higher posts at the local administrative level(Landrat). At the same time the Prussian government and Prussian King pursued Germanization of administration and judicial system, while local officials enforced Germanization of educational system and tried to eradicate the economic position of Polish nobility. In Bydgoszcz the mayors were all Germans. In Pozna≈Ñ, out of 700 officials, only 30 were Poles. Flotwell also initiated programs of German colonization and tried to reduce Polish landownership in favor of Germans. In the time period of 1832-1842 the number of Polish holdings was reduced from 1020 to 950 and the German ones increased from 280 to 400. Jewish minority in the Province was exploited by Prussians to gain support for its policies, by granting Jews rights and abolishing old limitations the Prussians hoped they could integrate Jewish population into German society, and gain a counterweight to Polish presence. As a result, many Jewish saw in Prussia a free, liberal state and were opposed to Polish independence movement. When Frederick William IV's ascended to the throne in 1840, certain concessions were again granted., the German colonization was halted, some schools were able to teach Polish language again, and promises were made to create departments of Polish language in universities in Breslau and Berlin, there were also vague promises about creation of University in Pozna≈Ñ. This was all that Poles were granted. In reality only the methods changed, while the overall goal of Germanization remained the same, only this time with lighter methods, and by concessions Prussians hoped to assure identification of Poles with Prussian state and eventual change of their identity. The concession also were connected to freezing of relations between Prussia and Russian Empire, with Prussian politicians hoping that Poles could be used to fight Russia on Prussia‚Äôs behalf. At this time the majority of Poles were not yet engaged in political activity. At most only the landowners, the intelligentsia and the upper urban classes possessed a developed national consciousness. The peasantry and the working class had yet to experience their own \\"Polish national awakening\\". Through military service and school education, and in the case of \\"regulated\\" peasants also in the wake of the benefits wrought by the final emancipation decree introduced in 1823, some segments of these social groups had begun to identify with the Prussian state. However, as German colonization grew in strength and policies against Polish religion and traditions were introduced the local population begun to feel hostility towards Prussia and German presence. Economic factors also began to influence Polish-German relations. Colonization policies in particular created a fear of German competition among Poles. The greatest difference remained the religious segregation. The local Germans displayed rather politically apathy and refrained from creating an organized form of social life. Prior to 1848, the provincial diet remained the only forum of German political activity. In general relations of the local Germans with the Polish population were good. In the end of the 1840s about 60 percent of the population of the Duchy were Polish, 34 percent German and 6 percent Jewish. Out of the administrative districts Poles had majority in 18 while Germans in 6, out which 4 were in the western part and 2 in the northern part. A first attempt to change the situation in the Duchy was made in the Greater Poland Uprising of 1846 after which 254 Polish activists were imprisoned upon charges of conspiracy. The trial ended on 2 December 1847, when 134 of the defendants were acquitted and returned to the Duchy. 8 defendants, including Ludwik Mieros≈Çawski, were sentenced to death, the rest to prison in the Berlin-Moabit prison. The death sentences were not carried out as Revolution in Prussia started . and the Prussian king amnestied political prisoners as part of concessions to revolutionaries Start of the Uprising Ludwik Mieros≈Çawski On 19 March 1848, after the Revolution in Berlin succeeded throughout the Spring of Nations, King Frederick William IV of Prussia amnestied the Polish prisoners, who joined the Berlin Home Guard in the evening of 20 March 1848 by founding a ‚ÄúPolish Legion‚Äù in the courtyard of the Berliner Schloss, and were armed with weapons from the Royal Prussian Arsenal. Ludwik Mieros≈Çawski waved the Black-Red-Gold flag of the German Revolution and the prisoners were celebrated by the public.Edward S. Cayley, The European Revolution of 1848 Speeches during the demonstration were made about a joint fight against the Russian Empire for a free and united Germany and an independent Poland. Karol Libelt noted from Berlin that he was under the impression that the whole people wanted a free and independent Poland to serve as a German shield against Russia and that the Polish question would soon be resolved. The Polish Legion left Berlin and arrived in Pozna≈Ñ on 28 March 1848, where Mieros≈Çawski took over military command.Adalbert Lipski, \\"Beitr√§ge zur Beurtheilung der Ereignisse im Grossherzogthum Posen im Jahre 1848\\" (German), p. 56 Volunteers from Berlin tried to join this legion and support the Polish struggle for liberty as it was expected, the Legion would fight against the Russian rule in Congress Poland, but these volunteers were rejected. Polish emigrants to France, like Adam Czartoryski, who returned to join that legion were allowed to use Prussian railways for free and often received with cheers, e.g. by the revolutionary committees in Cologne French politicians granted money for those trips hoping to remove Polish influence from France, for fear of revolutionary actions. Additionally the French incited Poles to start uprising, as they wanted to secure a diversionary element in case the Holy Alliance would turn its forces against France. The uprising in Pozna≈Ñ had started on 20 March 1848.Norman Davies. God's Playground: A History of Poland: Volume II (Columbia University Press: New York, 1982) pp. 341-342. Inspired by the events in Berlin, a demonstration in Pozna≈Ñ was organized and the authorities agreed to creation of delegation that would bring proposals of Polish side to Berlin and to the Prussian King. A Polish National Committee was created in Pozna≈Ñ. The Polish historian Jerzy Zdrada wrote that the delegates postulated independence of Polish territories but arriving in Berlin decided to remove that part of demands and replaced it with ‚Äúnational reorganization‚Äù, removal of Prussian military and turning the administration to Poles. Zdrada notes that those demands were to the liking of the Berlin Revolutionary Committee which wanted Poles as a force to fight Russia. According to the English historian Norman Davies, the political demands of the committee were for effective autonomy, not for independence. The organized militia was intended for use not against Prussia but against the threat of Russian intervention.Norman Davies, God's playground The Committee represented various political orientations and social classes, in order to achieve a coalition character. Its overall character was liberal-democratic, and among land-owners and intellectualists it included a Polish peasant Jan Palacz. On 21 March a joint demonstration of Germans and Poles took place, Germans often wore both the Black-Red-Gold cockade and the Polish Red-White as a revolutionary symbol.Thomas Urban, Von Krakau bis Danzig, Munich 2000, On March 21, the National Committee released a proclamation calling for a common struggle seeking understanding with the Germans, and a day later recognized the rights of Jews . According to Zdrada on the same day the Prussian general Friedrich August Peter von Colomb ordered Prussian soldiers take the Bazar a hotel which was the center of Polish activities. This was avoided as it would result in Polish-Prussian confrontation-something that the liberals in Berlin didn‚Äôt yet desire. On 22 March the German-controlled Pozna≈Ñ city council voted to support the postulates of the National Committee in Berlin. While Poles avoiding confrontation with the question of independence and demanded national reorganization the Germans called for separation of the Duchy from Prussia. Polish Committee restricted its membership to Poles and demands from Germans and Jews to be represented in the Polish Committee were not accepted and Jedrzej Moraczewski, a member of the Polish Committee, ordered on 28 March: ‚ÄúOne should make every effort not to alarm the Germans in order to avoid a strong reaction from their side. On the other hand it is necessary to maintain supremacy over them. From cooperation to confrontation The atmosphere among the Germans and a portion of the Jewish population began to change diametrically and a German National Committee was founded on 23 March, a second one on 27 March, now largely influenced by German public officials loyal to the Prussian King. Encroachments against Jews caused a further support of the German Committee by the Jewish population and the breakdown of Prussian authority allowed long-simmering resentments to explode, as the German Committee urged in a complaint addressed to the Polish Committee: \\"There have been many cases in which armed groups of your people have threatened and violated the property and personal security of your German- speaking neighbors. Keep in mind that through such acts of infamous violence you stain the honor of your nation and you undermine the sympathy for your cause among the nations of Germany and Europe.‚Äù In a few days the Polish movement embraced the whole Greater Poland region. Polish peasants and urban citizens turned against Prussian officials. Polish nobility and peasantry took up arms, preparing for confrontation with Prussian Army, Prussian symbols were torn down, and in couple of places fighting erupted with German colonists In West Prussia, Toru≈Ñ, Che≈Çmno, Bory Tucholskie the Polish population took inspiration from events in Greater Poland and openly turned against Prussian officials, led by Natalis Sulerzyski and Seweryn El≈ºanowski. In Che≈Çmno a Temporary National Committee of Polish Prussia was formed. By the end of march though local Germans turned harshly against Poles and together with Prussian military pacified the area, while Polish leaders were imprisoned. The reason for initial support of Poles by Prussians and Germans was the fear of Russian intervention which would stop creation of strong unified Germany. Germans saw in Poles an opportunity to create a diversion stopping Russians from intervention in Germany itself. The hostility to Russia manifested by Poles was the base of German sympathy towards Polish aspiration during the initial phase of the Uprising. Wilhelm von Willisen encouraged Mieros≈Çawski to fight a war against Russia. The Prussian foreign minister Arnim used the Polish issue as weapon against Russia. Leading German politicians and thinkers supported using Poles as protection against Russia, such as Karl August Varnhagen, Robert Blum, Heinrich von Gagern, Georg Gervinius, Johann Wirth, Constantin Frantz. As the threat of war with Russia grew distant, the German elites and society became hostile to Polish aspirations. Nationalist and even chauvinist voices could be heard in Germany demanding incorporation of the whole Greater Poland into German Confederation. Overnight Poles turned for Germans from an ally against Russia into the enemy that would threaten German control over Greater Poland and Pomerania. Polish successes created distrust in local Germans' and they felt threatened and the news of national reorganization of the province was the turning-point. The assumption of power by a Polish administration and the creation of a military corps out of local Polish population create a German fear for their position in a Polish-ruled Duchy. Thus German National Committee was founded on 23 March, and a second one on 27 March, now largely influenced by German public officials loyal to the Prussian King. The new German committee that emerged in Pozna≈Ñ subsequently engaged in consistent opposition to Polish movement. German separate national committees were established and petitions demanding the division of the Duchy and the incorporation of cities and counties into German Confederation addressed to Berlin. With the army protecting them, Germans started to paralyze development of Polish self-rule. German officials, colonists and tradesmen seized the opportunity and begun counteraction, demanding incorporation of the Polish territories into unified German state, accused Poles of repressions. Their claims were methodically used by German propaganda to win support of European countries such as Great Britain and France. Additionally German liberals turned against Poles, demanding ‚Äúprotection of German area‚Äù. Soon Germans craftsmen, traders and colonists in communities began to form committees and paramilitary units to defend their interests and to prevent local Poles from organizing, often joined by local JewsJonathan Sperber, The European Revolutions 1848-51 and started to besiege the Prussian King with petitions to exclude their areas from the planned political reorganization. By late April about 8,000 German civilians of the Noteƒá(Netze) district north of Pozna≈Ñ were organized in paramilitary units and another 6,000 around the towns of Miƒôdzyrzecz (Meseritz) and Nowy Tomy≈õl (Neutomischel). On 23 March the Prussian King granted an audience to Polish delegation and verbally declared his agreement to their proposals for autonomy; at the same time in confidential conversation with Prussian military commanders he ordered them to prepare an invasion of Polish territories to crush the Polish movement. On 24 March the Prussian King issued a declaration that promised the short-dated reorganization of the province and the creation of a commission of both nationalities, whose aim would be the consideration of interests of both nations. The Poles understood those measures as restoration of autonomy. Local Polish committees were formed, Prussian state treasuries requisitioned, and symbols of Prussian state dismantled. In many places the local landrats were removed from power. As John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, a British diplomat in Berlin, reported on 6 April 1848, \\"great excesses had been committed by armed bands of Poles, headed by some of the Nobles and Refugees, who have pillaged and set fire to country seats and farm houses and rendered themselves guilty of other depredations which the Government will endeavour to repress by moveable columns of Troops\\".British Envoys to Germany, 1816-1866 Volume III, Cambridge Press 2006 In the beginning of April the local Pozna≈Ñ Parliament voted 26 to 17 votes against joining German Confederation on 3 April 1848. The German minority in Greater Poland through German National Committee declared that it rejects any notion of Polish-German brotherhood and Germans will not resign from controlling the area, even if Polish state is re-established. On 4 April Prussian military declared a stage of siege in Pozna≈Ñ. Berlin authorities tried to delay the course of events by proposing the division of the province in two parts. Additionally they tried to convince Poles that creation of Polish military formations will hinder the talks about autonomy. Poles on their side, have begun to create armed units on 22 March based on decision of Polish National Committee, which in the meantime changed its name to Polish Central Committee. On 28 March Ludwik Mieros≈Çawski took command of military supply and organization, in which he was supported by Polish officers from emigration. Fearing intervention by Russian Empire in Prussia taken by liberal revolt, Poles were preparing for a joint defense with Prussian forces against possible Russian attack. Prince Adam Czartoryski came to Berlin for political talks, and general Ignacy PrƒÖdzy≈Ñski prepared plans for possible war with Russia. Karl Wilhelm von Willisen On 5 April the new \\"Royal Civil Commissioner for the Province Posen\\", Karl Wilhelm von Willisen, a figure claiming to be sympathetic to the Polish cause, arrived at Pozna≈Ñ and his early actions disappointed the Germans greatly. Willisen soon came in conflict with the military commander of Pozna≈Ñ, general Friedrich August Peter von Colomb, who opposed any kind of Polish independence efforts. Willisen declared that Poles will be granted autonomy but they have to reduce their forces, which on beginning of April counted 7,000 people. A compromise was reached on 11 April in Jaros≈Çawiec, when Willisen permitted Poles to have four military camps counting 720 people each (In the end the number of people in the camps was around 4,000). Willisen himself left Pozna≈Ñ on 20 April, blamed for treason and having \\"betrayed the German cause\\" and as a contemporary eyewitness wrote \\"Willisen was exposed to personal insults or even danger from the infuriated German and Jewish mobs of Posen‚Äù .Valerian Krasinski, Panslavism and Germanism London 1848 Not longafter he was relieved of his duties and replaced by Ernst von Pfuel, who arrived in Pozna≈Ñ early May. On 14 April the Prussian king declared that ten northern and western counties out of the 24 counties of the province would not take part in the planned political reorganization; on 26 April this was spread to parts of six additional counties, including the City of Pozna≈Ñ itself, leaving to Poles only nine counties. To all involved parties it was obviously a temporary solution and unacceptable to Poles as out of the administrative districts Poles had majority in 18 while Germans in 6, out which four were in the western part and 2 in the northern part. The demobilized Polish militia was harassed by German forces and several Poles were either murdered or wounded. Military confrontation The Polish National Committee had decided to unarm its forces, but this determination was ignored by Mieros≈Çawski who expected a Russian intervention in which they would assist Prussian forces in defense as an ally. As such they were unprepared to fight the Prussians. As the Prussian troops lashed unrestricted terror against the Polish population, the Prussian attack started on 29 April as camps in KsiƒÖ≈º, Pleszew, Wrze≈õnia and Mi≈Ços≈Çaw were assaulted. In KsiƒÖ≈º, Prussian troops destroyed the town after murdering 600 prisoners and wounded Wielka Historia Polski Volume 4 Zg√≥rniak Marian, Buszko J√≥zef. ≈öwiat KsiƒÖ≈ºki 2006 page 224 Among the victims of the massacre was Florian DƒÖbrowski Kronika powsta≈Ñ polskich 1794-1944 Marian B. Michalik, Eugeniusz Duraczy≈Ñski page 185. Kronika 1994 Additionally population of Grodzisk led by Jewish doctor Marcus Mosse defended the town against encroaching 600 Prussian troops. Polish committees in Wielkopolska were being attacked as well, Demobilized Poles returning to their homes were being harassed as were Catholic priests, while Germans pacified villages. This provoked an outrage in Polish peasants who rose up against Prussian forces in rural uprising and guerrilla warfare, and joined the regular Polish forces under Mieros≈Çawski. Mieros≈Çawski believed that to save morale and honor of Poles it is necessary to resist military, while the Committee members were opposed to fighting, and as such the Committee disbanded itself on 30 April, in its last proclamation stressing the Prussian treachery and violence. After Duchy of Warsaw was abolished in 1815, Prussia engaged in German colonization of Polish territories it acquired in Congress of Vienna, continuing previous efforts started with the Partitions Niemieccy katolicy w pozna≈Ñskiem a polityka narodowo≈õciowa rzƒÖdu pruskiego 1871-1914 Witold Matwiejczyk Wydawn.

The Prussian forces divided themselves into two columns‚Äîone moving from ≈öroda, the other from Wrze≈õnia. Initially Mieros≈Çawski engaged in talks with Blumen, but when he received news that Poles from Now Miasto under the command of J√≥zef Garczy≈Ñski are coming to help him with 1000 soldiers and that additional reinforcements of 1200 soldiers are moving from Pleszew under the command of Feliks Bia≈Çosk√≥rski, he broke down the negotiations. As consequence the battle started. In the first phase of the battle, Polish forces were driven out of Mi≈Ços≈Çaw and took positions along two sides of the main road. In pursuit of retreating Poles Blumen ordered a cavalry assault. The Prussian pursuit was stopped however by the arrival of Garczy≈Ñski, and when Bia≈Çosk√≥rki soldiers arrived the Poles counterattacked. The second phase was dominated by Polish counterattack along the line of the main road and attack on cavalry unit before it was able to attack Polish positions. Afterwards Poles re-entered the town and Prussians were forced to retreat. However, the Poles were exhausted and were not able to pursue the retreating Prussians, causing the victory to not be exploited to its full potential. Polish losses counted 200 soldiers while the Prussians 225. Further fighting and end of the Uprising On 2 May the Polish kosynierzy defeated Prussian column near Wrze≈õnia at the village of , but their victory just as well was connected to heavy losses. Prussians managed to defeat Polish forces in Mosina, Rogalin, Stƒôszew, K√≥rnik, Buk, Oborniki. Mieros≈Çawski tendered his resignation as the commander of the Polish forces on 6 May and the new Supreme commander, Augustyn Brzezanski, capitulated on 9 May. The act of capitulation was signed in Bardo near Wrze≈õnia. Aftermath and consequences The Grand Duchy of Posen was subsequently replaced with the Province of Posen and the Prussian government rejected any ideas of autonomy. As a Prussian Province it was completely incorporated into the German Confederation, however when the Frankfurt Parliament finalized the German Constitution on 28 March 1849 Pozna≈Ñ wasn't mentioned. In the elections to the Prussian diet in May 1849 Polish delegates achieved 16 out of the 30 seats of the Province, but the elections to the German Constitutional Parliament were largely boycotted by Polish parties in protest against the incorporation. Others called ‚ÄúNow we will go against Prussians not with scythes but with votes‚Äù. 1,500 Poles were imprisoned in Pozna≈Ñ Citadel, mostly peasants who took part in the fighting, their heads shaved bald and branded by Prussian authorities by chemical substance which scarred them with permanent wounds on hands, ears and faces.Pozna≈Ñskie fortyfikacje: praca zbiorowa Tadeusz A.

Mieros≈Çawski's report on the Baden campaign (1849)Norman Davies, Friedrich Griese, Bronis≈Çaw Geremek, Im Herzen Europas, Geschichte Polens The Uprising showed to Poles that there was no possibility to negotiate with Germans regarding Polish statehood. The so-called ‚ÄúPolen-Debatte‚Äù in Frankfurt Parliament in July 1848 concerned the issue of Poland and showed the attitude of German politicians regarding this. They opposed Poland and any concessions to Poles in Pozna≈Ñ. Those who in the past have claimed to be friendly towards Poles, rejected all of their former declarations and called them mistakes and the idea of restored Poland ‚Äúinsanity‚Äù. At the same time the demands of German representatives were not only directed against Poland, they also wanted a war with Denmark, opposed autonomy for Italians in South Tyrol, called Alsace- Lorraine German, and talked about German interests in Baltic provinces of Russia. While the Uprising was focused in Wielkopolska, it also reached out to other Polish inhabited areas, in Pomerania Natalis Sulerzeski organized Polish armed forces and together with Ignacy ≈Åyskowski arranged a meeting in Wƒôbrzyn of Polish delegates was organized who created Tymczasowy Komitety Prus Polskich. It was to start talks on reorganization of Western Prussia provinces on 5 April in Che≈Çmno, but it never came to that, as Prussians arrested most of its members and put them in prison in GrudziƒÖdz. Seweryn El≈ºanowski in response organized a military formation counting several hundred people which took part in combat near Bory Tucholskie after which it moved into Wielkopolska. The Polish national movement in Pomerania decided after those events to pursue its goals by legal means, and remained in this position till First World War The events of the failed Uprising inspired Polish movement. A crucial point was that unlike in Galicia or Congress Poland the peasantry took active and decisive part on behalf of Polish resistance. The Polish peasants had seen in German colonization a primary threat to their national and social interests. The post-uprising repression‚Äôs spawned defensive reactions within the Polish society. Some of the Polish activists, mostly members of the landed gentry and the intelligentsia, abandoned armed insurrection and began to propagate a doctrine of organic work by strengthening the economic potential and educational level in Polish territories. Others favored an armed struggle for independence and formed the Poznan Committee (Kormitet Poznanski), which represented the democratically oriented landowners and intelligentsia, or the socialist Society of Plebeians (Zwiazek Plebejuszy). Both organizations worked for an uprising that would encompass all three parts of the partitioned Poland. In Pomerania during elections three Polish representatives were elected to the Prussian Parliament. They were led by Ignacy ≈Åyskowski, a landlord and journalist, who printed a Polish newspaper Szk√≥≈Çka Narodowa in Che≈Çmno. The 1848 was a turning point for Polish national movement in Pomerania, which gained support of city inhabitants and Polish peasants, and especially strong support among Polish clergy, who were subjected to hostile policies by German bishopric in Pelplin. The Polish activists from Pomerania soon came in contact with Masurs and Gustaw Gizewiusz, who encouraged Masurs to defend their local traditions and language. Unfortunately he died soon after being elected to Berlin Parliament. In Silesia the movement from Wielkopolska reached out to J√≥zef Lompa and Emanuel Smo≈Çka who organized the Polish national movement in Upper and Lower Silesia. A Polish pastor J√≥zef Szafranek was elected to parliament in Berlin. The Poles in western partition decided to focus their energy on increasing economic and political position of Poles before deciding for military confrontation. For 70 years Poles would work on developing their organization, increasing wealth and development of Polish lands. The first organization to do so was Polish League created in Summer 1848. Made by liberal politicians it was led by Count August Cieszkowski-writer and philosopher. Its aims were the increasing of national self-awareness among Polish population, rising its life standards and defense of Catholic faith and Polish-owned land. By Autumn 1848 it counted already 40,000 members. Its main directorate was led by count Gustaw Potworowski. The organization supported agricultural reforms by Polish rural dwellers, and spread information connected to improving agriculture as well as strengthening civic unity. While it was completely legal and didn‚Äôt violate any laws, the Prussian government disbanded it in 1850. In practice its members continued to work and soon numerous successor organizations were founded leading way to Polish resistance in Prussian Partition of Poland based on economic and legal opposition.

Although not nearly as famous as fellow Belgian cartoonists such as Herg√© or Andr√© Franquin, Macherot's work, both as artist and writer, remains highly regarded among critics and collectors. Biography=The Tintin years Raymond Macherot was born in Verviers, Belgium in 1924. He wanted to become a journalist or a painter but, for financial reasons, he became an illustrator and comics artist.De Weyer, Geert (2005). \\"Raymond Macherot\\". In Belgi√´ gestript, pp. 137‚Äì138. Tielt: Lannoo. Following the end of World War II, Macherot began his career producing a few cartoons in the style of Virgil Partch for the satirical weekly Pan, under the pseudonym \\"Zara\\". In 1953, he joined the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin, where he wrote a scenario for Fred Funcken's Le chevalier blanc and made numerous illustrations and magazine covers. In 1954, Macherot created the series Chlorophylle, featuring anthropomorphic animals. Macherot sets his first adventures in the countryside, where Chlorophylle, a dormouse, and his best friend Minimum, try to defeat animal villains often much bigger than themselves, typically led by the megalomaniac rat, Anthracite. With Les croquillards (1957), Macherot placed his characters to the island of Croquefredouille, a fictitious country populated entirely with \\"civilized\\" animals, complete with technology, police, government, and so on. The action surrounds the introduction (by Anthracite, of course) of carnivorous animals to the island (the 'croquillards' of the title). The story is darkly comic, with many characters ending up as gourmet meals for the predators. Strangely, Macherot's publisher, Le Lombard, refused to release the Croquefredouille stories in book form until 1980. Alternatively, in 1959, Macherot created Colonel Clifton, a series about a retired MI5 detective. He did three books worth of material, all the while continuing Chlorophylle, before calling it quits and moving to Spirou magazine, run by competitor-publisher Dupuis. Le Lombard retained the rights to Macherot's abandoned series. Chlorophylle was taken up with mild success by successive teams of authors, notably Dupa & Greg, as well as Walli and Bob de Groot. As for Clifton, Turk & De Groot turned the series into a relative hit. The Spirou years Macherot began his stint at Spirou with a new series, Chaminou, featuring a cat secret agent to the King, living in the country Zoolande. However, Chaminou's first story, Chaminou et le Khrompire (1964), was unpopular and Macherot abandoned Chaminou. Closer to Chlorophylle, Sibylline, featured a female mouse and her fianc√© Taboum. Many books have been published in this series, which enjoyed some success. From 1972 to 1976, Paul Deli√®ge wrote the scenarios for Sibylline. Macherot ended the series upon his retirement in 1990. Other series created by Macherot for Spirou include Pantoufle (with Ren√© Goscinny), Mirliton (with Raoul Cauvin), and as scenarist on Mulligan with Yvan Delporte and Isabelle, with Delporte and Andr√© Franquin. In the 1990s, Chaminou was revived, first by the team of Yann Lepennetier and Denis Bodart, and later by Olivier Saive, who completely redrew and augmented Chaminou et le Khrompire under Macherot's supervision, splitting it in two volumes. As for Sibylline, the series has been revived in 2006 by Andr√© Taymans for new adventures, also under Macherot's supervision. Raymond Macherot died in the night of 25 and 26 September 2008 in his sleep.Le Figaro announces the death of Macherot Themes Although superficially gentle and innocent looking, many of Macherot's strips are darker, and certainly more violent and ambiguous than they may seem. The main theme in his work is the struggle for survival. In Macherot's world, animals live in a society of their own, and species must learn to coexist together peacefully. Macherot's typical way to achieve this is to make vegetarianism mandatory to all. As a result, his villains are often natural predators who choose to ignore the law of the land. Additionally, Macherot's intrigues often veer into the political, particularly during the so-called \\"Croquefredouille cycle\\" as well as in Chaminou et le Khrompire, and the subject of war is alluded to in many of his stories. Bibliography Not all of Macherot's stories have been published in book form. When they have been, they have not necessarily been published in chronological order. This is particularly true with Chlorophylle. This list shows the original magazine publication order. The years indicate the initial publication date for each book.

Geography  Mittweida is situated on the Zschopau River, 18 km north of Chemnitz, and 54 km west of Dresden. Embedded within the steep hills and valleys of the river and two smaller creeks, the town is green and picturesque. Mittweida has a station on the Riesa‚ÄìChemnitz railway. A branch line, closed in 1997, served the industries in nearby Dreiwerden and Ringethal. Major roads are the state roads S200, S201, and S247, connecting the town with various federal roads and the motorway A4 which passes south- east of Mittweida.  History  The town was first mentioned in 1209. In 1286 it was known as civitas and oppidum. Weaving of wool and linen were major occupations of the inhabitants in the Middle Ages, and after a spinning mill was founded in 1816, the town grew into one of the major textile-producing centers in Saxony of the 20th century. Mittweida was already a sizeable town in the mid-16th century, and despite having more inhabitants than Rochlitz, it had remained part of Amt and Amtshauptmannschaft Rochlitz for many years. In 1924 it became a separate urban district. During World War II, a subcamp of Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp was located in Mittweida.Christine O'Keefe. Concentration Camps In 1946 the town was reintegrated into Landkreis Rochlitz and was transferred to Kreis Hainichen in 1952. Landkreis Mittweida was formed from the districts Rochlitz and Hainichen in 1994, it was integrated into Landkreis Mittelsachsen in 2008.  Buildings and culture  Of interest are the Gothic church from the 15/16th century, the old town, the historic and technical museums and the nearby Kriebstein castle.

The alpha isoform of this protein, TRIM5Œ±, is a retrovirus restriction factor, which mediates species-specific, early block to retrovirus infection. TRIM5Œ± is composed of 493 amino acids that is found in the cells of most primates. TRIM5Œ± is an intrinsic immune factor important in the innate immune defense against retroviruses, along with the APOBEC family of proteins, tetherin and TRIM22.  Structure  TRIM5Œ± belongs to the TRIM protein family (TRIM stands for TRIpartite Motif); this family was first identified by Reddy in 1992 as proteins that contain a RING finger zinc binding domain, a B-box zinc binding domain, followed by a coiled-coil region. TRIM5Œ± bears the C-terminal PRY-SPRY or B30.2 domain in addition to the other domains. Function When a retrovirus enters a host cell's cytoplasm, it undergoes capsid uncoating and reverse transcription. TRIM5 is present in the cytoplasm and recognizes motifs within the capsid proteins that interferes with the uncoating process, therefore preventing successful reverse transcription and transport to the nucleus of the viral genome. The exact mechanism of action has not been shown conclusively, but capsid protein from restricted viruses is removed by proteasome-dependent degradation. The involvement of other cellular proteins in the inhibition mediated by TRIM5Œ± is suspected but as yet not demonstrated. However, Cyclophilin A is important for the inhibition of HIV-1 by TRIM5Œ± in Old World monkey species. The \\"specificity\\" of restriction, that is, whether a given retrovirus can be targeted by TRIM5Œ±, is entirely determined by the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal domain of the protein, called the B30.2/PRY-SPRY domain. Amino acid 332, which occurs within this domain, seems to play a critical role in determining the specificity of retrovirus restriction. TRIM5Œ± may have played a critical role in the human immune defense system about 4 million years ago, when the retrovirus PtERV1 was infecting the ancestors of modern chimpanzees. While no trace of PtERV1 has yet been found in the human genome, about 130 traces of PtERV1 DNA have been found in the genome of modern chimpanzees. After recreating part of the PtERV1 retrovirus, it was reported that TRIM5Œ± prevents the virus from entering human cells in vitro. While this cellular defense mechanism may have been very useful 4 million years ago when facing a PtERV1 epidemic, it has the side effect of leaving cells more susceptible to attack by the HIV-1 retrovirus. Recently, doubt has been cast over these conclusions. By using a PtERV1 capsid, which produces higher titer virus-like particles, Perez-Caballero et al. reported that PtERV1 is not restricted by either human or chimpanzee TRIM5Œ±.  Clinical significance  Old World monkeys cannot be infected with HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS in humans; they can be infected, however, with SIV, a related virus. TRIM5Œ± was isolated as a rhesus macaque protein responsible for blocking infection by HIV-1. The human version of TRIM5Œ± does not block HIV-1, but can inhibit strains of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) as well as equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). Prior to the discovery of TRIM5Œ± as an antiviral protein, the inhibition phenotype had been described and coined Ref1 (in human cells) and Lv1 (in monkey cells). This terminology is now largely abandoned. A related protein, named TRIMCyp (or TRIM5-CypA), was isolated in the owl monkey, a species of New World monkey, and shown to potently inhibit infection by HIV-1. A similar protein has arisen independently in Old World monkeys and has been identified in several species of macaque. It was recently described that interferon-Œ±-mediated stimulation of the immunoproteasome enables human TRIM5Œ± for effective capsid-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 DNA synthesis and infection.

Written by Jerome Bixby and directed by Murray Golden, it was first broadcast on February 14, 1969. In the episode, the crew of the Enterprise encounters an immortal human. Its repeat broadcast, on September 2, 1969, was the last official telecast of the series to air on NBC. Star Trek would immediately appear in syndication on the following Monday, September 8, a full three years after its debut. Plot The crew of the Federation starship Enterprise is struck with deadly Rigellian fever, for which the only treatment is the mineral ryetalyn. Captain Kirk, first officer Spock and medical officer Dr. McCoy beam down to the planet Holberg 917-G in search of the substance and are attacked by an airborne robot, which is called off by its master, Flint. Flint demands they leave immediately, but Kirk orders the Enterprise to fire phasers on their coordinates if they are attacked. Acknowledging a stalemate, Flint agrees to let them remain long enough to obtain the ryetalyn. Flint offers the help of his sentry robot M4 to gather the mineral and escorts them to his home, which has an impressive art collection. Spock notices that the brushwork of the paintings is identical to Leonardo da Vinci's, but his tricorder indicates that they are made with contemporary materials. The party is introduced to Flint's young ward, Rayna Kapec, whose late parents, according to Flint, were employees of his. On Flint's suggestion, Kirk plays billiards with Rayna, and they dance to a waltz played on the piano by Spock. The sheet music, apparently in the hand of Johannes Brahms, is written with contemporary ink. M4 returns with a container of ryetalyn, but it is contaminated with irilium, and therefore useless. Flint apologizes and accompanies M4 on a search for more ryetalyn. When Kirk kisses Rayna, M4 reacts as if he were attacking her. Spock destroys it with his phaser. The Enterprise reports that no information can be found on Flint or Rayna. A tricorder scan reveals that Flint is over 6,000 years old. Rayna comes to say goodbye to Kirk, who has fallen in love with her and begs her to accompany him. McCoy tells them that after being processed in Flint‚Äôs laboratory, the ryetalyn vanished. Spock follows tricorder readings to a laboratory chamber containing not only the ryetalyn, but a number of android bodies, all labeled \\"Rayna\\". Flint reveals the truth. He was born in 3834 BC, and after falling in battle discovered he could not die. Flint has lived \\"lifetimes\\" as da Vinci, Brahms, and many others. He built Rayna to be his immortal mate and manipulated Kirk into teaching her how to love. Paranoid about the possibility that the Enterprise crew would reveal him and his location, Flint causes the Enterprise to disappear from orbit and reappear as a tabletop miniature in his laboratory, with the crewmembers in suspended animation. He proposes to keep them that way for up to 2000 years. Rayna happens into the room and vehemently objects, so he restores the starship to its previous state. When Captain Kirk professes his love for Rayna and pleads with her to leave with him, a fight breaks out between him and Flint for the possession of Rayna. Rayna stops them, claiming her right to choose her own future, and then, overwhelmed by indecision for fear of hurting either Kirk or Flint, dies. Back on the Enterprise, McCoy reports that readings from the earlier tricorder scan show that Flint has been aging normally since he left Earth‚Äôs environment, and will soon die. Kirk falls asleep on his desk after commenting ruefully on Rayna's fate, and Spock places a suggestion to \\"forget\\" into his mind. Production and reception Rayna's last name, \\"Kapec\\", is an anagram of Capek, after Karel ƒåapek, who introduced the term \\"robot\\". Reception In a 2010 review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club criticized the Rigellian fever scenario as contrived and noted that Flint being numerous famous men from history was both completely irrelevant and contradictory to his claim that he had kept a low profile to avoid his immortality being discovered. He said that though the final scene is a highlight, it is undermined by Kirk's obsessive love for Rayna being so out- of-character as to be unbelievable. He gave the episode a C, summing it up as \\"forgettable\\". In 2017, Den of Geek ranked \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\" as the 15th \\"best worst\\" Star Trek: The Original Series episode, echoing Handlen's criticism that Kirk falling so intensely in love with Rayna over the course of just four hours was highly out-of-character. Analysis According to fantasy and science fiction scholar Ace G. Pilkington, Requiem for Methuselah is a Star Trek adaptation of the film Forbidden Planet (1956).Pilkington (2015), p. 43‚Äì44 Actress Anne Francis reported that Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, had talked to her about lifting some ideas from Forbidden Planet. Actor Leslie Nielsen noted the similarities between Forbidden Planet and Star Trek, suggesting that the film served as a pilot for the television series. Ruth Morse, a Shakespearean scholar, has written on the influence of The Tempest on Forbidden Planet and Requiem for Methuselah.Morse (2000), pp. 164‚Äì171 Flint, the powerful recluse, seems to be based on Prospero and Methuselah. Rayna appears to be Flint's daughter and is based on Miranda, Prospero's daughter. The twist here is that \\"Rayna-Miranda\\" (as Morse calls her) is an android, not Flint's daughter. Flint hopes that the female android will fall in love with him. Flint offers her knowledge and intellectual stimulation but Rayna falls for the \\"irresistible\\" Kirk. The female android faces new and (to her) unfamiliar emotions, having to choose between two men. The pressure causes her to short-circuit into self-destruction, her version of death. 40th anniversary remastering This episode was remastered in 2006 and aired June 21, 2008 as part of the remastered Original Series. It was preceded a week earlier by the remastered \\"The Way to Eden\\" and followed a week later by the remastered \\"The Savage Curtain\\". Changes made specific to this episode include: * Flint's home is now a large palatial home, complete with observation tower. Originally, Flint's home was represented by a reuse of the matte painting of Rigel VII from \\"The Cage\\". * Planet Holberg 917-G is now more realistic, with two moons orbiting behind it. * The effect of the Enterprise being miniaturized from space is remastered. In other media In several non-canonical Star Trek novels, the crew meet up again with the character Flint. The Cry of the Onlies by Judy Klass is a follow-on from both \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\" and \\"Miri\\". He is also encountered in Greg Cox's The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh as Dr. Evergreen, a 1980s scientist who discovers a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, in Immortal Coil by Jeffrey Lang, and in Federation by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens as Zefram Cochrane's benefactor Micah Brack. The author of the Star Trek screenplay, Jerome Bixby, would write a film script at the end of his life which has many plot elements of this previous story, including an ageless man who is 14,000 years old, and has been a student of the Buddha, while he himself was the basis for the story of Jesus. This film, The Man from Earth, was released in 2007. In the crossover comic Star Trek/Legion of Super- Heroes, the crew of the Enterprise joins forces with the Legion of Super- Heroes to investigate an alternative timeline where Earth has become a galaxy- conquering empire, learning that the villain is immortal Vandal Savage, who turns out to be an alternative version of Flint, Flint being a Vandal Savage who turned his back on violence and conquest. The character of Rayna appears briefly twice without speaking as a hallucination in Episode 4 of Star Trek Continues, \\"The White Iris\\", this time played by Gabriela Fresquez, Spock's removal of Kirk's memory having been loosened by a brain injury and an experimental drug. Since Star Trek Continues follows directly from the end of the original Star Trek series, presumably \\"The White Iris\\" occurs only a few weeks after the events of \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\".

Their headquarters are in Long Beach, California, United States. It was incorporated and registered at the Californian Secretary of State's office as a political organization in June 1999, and aims \\"to fight against communists to protect the interests of Cambodian people.\\" The CFF claim to have 500 members in the United States and up to 20,000 supporters in the Kingdom of Cambodia. History and Attacks The military branch of the CFF emerged in November 1998, in the wake of political violence that saw many influential Cambodian leaders flee and the Cambodian People's Party assume power. With the objective of overthrowing the government, the group is led by a Cambodian-American, a former member of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party, includes Cambodian-Americans based in Thailand and the United States and former soldiers from the separatist Khmer Rouge, Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, and various conservative political factions. In the wake of the violence, more than 200 people, including Richard Kiri Kim, were arrested by the Cambodian police. On 19 September 2000, a grenade was thrown by two men on a motorcycle at a phone booth. Four people were killed and nine injured in the attack. Although they did not claim the incident, the government saw the CFF as suspects. In 24 November of 2000 two attacks were registered eight people were killed and at least fourteen wounded when as many as seventy anti-government rebels stormed state offices and battled security forces in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The rebels threw grenades and used AK-47's in an exchange of fire with soldiers and police outside the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet buildings, and ten men launched an assault on a military barracks approximately 15 kilometers (nine miles) west of the capital. There were no reports of casualties or damage. Police believed that the attacks were perpetrated by the anti-government group, the Cambodian Freedom Fighters. After the attacks Cambodian courts have jailed several dozen people for their roles in the attacks in trials that have been widely criticized as unfair. During the arrests of CFF suspects after the November 2000 raids, Cambodian human rights groups and opposition political parties accused the Government of arbitrarily arresting and jailing several legitimate party figures on charges of being CFF members. In December 2000, Human Rights Watch reported that, within two weeks after the November attacks, over 200 people had been arrested all over Cambodia, most without a warrant (6 Dec 2000). \\"Many of those arrested or detained are affiliated with the royalist Funcinpec Party of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP),\\" Human Rights Watch reported (6 Dec 2000). In its 2002 annual report on human rights practices in Cambodia, Human Rights Watch stated that another 50 CFF suspects had been arrested in September 2001 in the provinces and Phnom Penh, and that \\"human rights groups expressed concern that the government's response to the CFF's November 2000 attack in Phnom Penh could be used as a pretext to intimidate opposition party members, particularly as the commune election campaign began to get underway\\".On June 22, 2001, the Cambodian Criminal Court handed down their verdict on the Cambodian Freedom Fighters‚Äô attack of November 24, 2000. An Mao, Nou Saron, and three Cambodian-Americans (Richard Kiri Kim, Thong Samien, and Chhun Yasith) were sentenced to life in prison on charges of conspiring to commit terrorism. Chhun Yasith and Thong Samien were tried in absentia. A year later the 1 November of 2001 a series of bombings that included four improvised explosive devices which detonated near the governor's office, other near a deputy governor's home and other more near in the provincial prison in Pursat, Pursat province, Cambodia. No one was injured and there was only minor damage as a result of the explosion. Authorities suspect the involvement of CFF. Twenty-four other men and one woman were found guilty of various charges and given prison terms ranging from three to 20 years. Among them were two prominent former Khmer Rouge commanders, Seng Narin and Tumlap Mil, who each received 15 years in prison. Politics The Cambodian Freedom Fighters have chosen not to participate in the election process in Cambodia because they state Prime Minister Hun Sen belonged to the ultra-left Khmer Rouge and he has rigged the election process in Cambodia. They have chosen to remove Hun Sen's government militarily because they believe he and his regime are guilty of corruption in the election process in collaboration with the Communist Vietnamese that placed Hun Sen in power in 1989. In 2008, Chhun Yasith, founder of the Cambodian Freedom Fighters, was tried and convicted in the U.S., in relation to masterminding the 2000 coup attempt. CFF's exact strength is unknown, but totals probably never has exceeded 500 armed fighters. CFF operates in Northeastern Cambodia near the Thai border.

This region includes Toronto, Southern Ontario's major industrial cities (Windsor, London, Hamilton, St. Thomas, Oshawa, St. Catharines), and the surrounding countryside. While the genre may also feature other areas of Ontario, Canada, and the world as narrative locales, this region provides the core settings. Overview The term was first used in Graeme Gibson's Eleven Canadian Novelists (1972) to recognize an existing tendency to apply aspects of the Gothic novel to writing based in and around Southern Ontario.The Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature. 1997.

(Document ID: 1275281041) Southern Ontario Gothic is generally characterized by a stern realism set against the dour small-town Protestant morality stereotypical of the region, and often has underlying themes of moral hypocrisy. Actions and people that act against humanity, logic, and morality all are portrayed unfavourably, and one or more characters may be suffering from some form of mental illness. In a review of Alice Munro's Dear Life for Quill & Quire, literary critic James Grainger writes that \\"Violence, illness, and reputations ruined by a single indiscretion are accepted in Munro‚Äôs secretive, repressed communities as a kind of levelling mechanism, rough justice for those who dare to strive for something finer.\\"\\"Dear Life by Alice Munro\\". Quill & Quire, November 2012. The Gothic novel has traditionally examined the role of evil in the human soul, and has incorporated dark or horrific imagery to create the desired setting.Andrews, Jennifer. 2001. 'Native Canadian gothic refigured: Reading Eden Robinson's Monkey Beach'. Essays on Canadian Writing,(73), 1-24. Retrieved June 16, 2009, from CBCA Reference database. (Document ID: 76040741). Some (but not all) writers of Southern Ontario Gothic use supernatural or magic realist elements; a few deviate from realism entirely, in the manner of the fantastical gothic novel. Virtually all dwell to a certain extent upon the grotesque. Often, these elements are combined to highlight themes present in the wider canon of Canadian literature. An overarching sense of displacement either socially, physically or psychologically often sets the stage for supernatural elements, transgressive behavior or inner turmoil.Bode, R., Clement, L. D., & Bode, R. (2015). L.M. montgomery's rainbow valleys: The Ontario years, 1911-1961. Montr√©al, CA: McGill-Queen's University Press. Accompanying displacement is a nightmarish feeling of spiritual imprisonment in a Southern Ontario setting that is characterized by an eroding societal value system and an atmosphere that stifles and fears individual means of expression.Andrews, J. (2001). Native canadian gothic refigured: Reading eden robinson's monkey beach. Essays on Canadian Writing, (73), 1-24. Many sources of terror and horror are created when a character tries to break free of the strictures of established norms within these communities.Belyea, Andrew D. Redefining the Real: Gothic Realism in Alice Munro's \\"Friend of My Youth\\", ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 1998. This lends itself to a motif of 'Canadian' survival that is applied to scenarios dependent on enduring abstract horrors which originate from within a character who is often living in a small village, town or city of the region.Berndt, Katrin. \\"‚ÄúThe Ordinary Terrors of Survival: Alice Munro and the Canadian Gothic‚Äù.\\" Contemporary Literary Criticism, edited by Lawrence J.

In a review of Cynthia Sugars' book Canadian Gothic: Literature, History and the Spectre of Self-Invention Amy Ransom claims that Southern Ontario Gothic seeks to tell the stories of generations of settlers in a way that uses elements of the taboo, the surreal and the fantastical to form a new common identity in a postcolonial world.Ransom, Amy J. \\"Sugars, Cynthia.

He was born in Tours, Indre-et-Loire and studied in Paris where he befriended fellow student Jean-Paul Sartre at the Lyc√©e Henri IV. He became a member of the French Communist Party, and much of his writing reflects his political beliefs, although he resigned from the party upon hearing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in 1939. He died in the Battle of Dunkirk, fighting against the German army in World War II. His works include the novels Antoine Bloye (1933), Le Cheval de Troie [The Trojan Horse] and La Conspiration [The Conspiracy] (1938), as well as the essays \\"Les Chiens de garde\\" [\\"The Watchdogs\\"] (1932) and \\"Aden Arabie\\" (1931), which introduced him to a new audience when it was republished in 1960 with a foreword by Sartre. In particular, the opening sentence \\"I was twenty, I won't let anyone say those are the best years of your life\\" (J‚Äôavais vingt ans.

Life Nizan was born to a middle- class family, his father having worked in rail prior to the First World War. Nizan's father's course through the bureaucracy of French industry would later form the basis of Antoine Bloye, and serve as a significant point of development for Nizan's understanding of social alienation. He interrupted his studies at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure of the University of Paris in 1926 to leave for Aden where he worked as tutor to the son of French-born businessman- millionaire Antonin Besse.http://www.paul-nizan.fr/paul-nizan-biographie/ He drew upon his six-month experience in Aden to write his first novella, Aden Arabie, published in 1931. Nizan then entered into a number of miscellaneous jobs around the Communist Party of France (PCF), writing for its journal prominently and even, at one point, running a party bookshop in Paris. Nizan later took up a professorship teaching literature, during which time he took on a reputation among students as an affable and relaxed professor, sometimes even offering his students cigarettes during class. As a teacher, he was reticent about his own perspective on Marxist theory, instead encouraging his students to arrive independently at their own conclusions. Through this period, up to the onset of World War II, Nizan penned all of his major works, including \\"The Watchdogs\\", an expos√© on materialist philosophy, and the novels Antoine Bloye and The Conspiracy. In 1939, however, news of the non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union forced Nizan to abandon the French Communist Party. Given his active participation in the anti-fascist movement, as well as his commitment to the republican cause of the Spanish Civil War, Nizan could not accept the party's rapid shift against the popular front. Soon thereafter, Nizan enlisted to fight in the French army with the onset of World War II, and was killed in the Battle of Dunkirk while part of the French rearguard protecting the British evacuation. Politics Nizan's politics took a number of sporadic turns throughout the course of his life, with Sartre noting that Nizan in his youth had vacillated between fascist and communist sympathies, attracted to both extremes of the political spectrum. Nizan also approached the priesthood as a young man but soon turned away from that decision. Eventually, Nizan settled on membership in the Communist Party of France, under whose auspices Nizan's public life as an author began. Within the party, Nizan wrote extensively for official communist publications and had his works sold in party bookstores, although his most celebrated work today is his fiction. In his various novels, Nizan explores modern alienation, as well as the situation of the radical petit-bourgeois milieu caught between contending class forces. While Nizan was a loyal adherent to the policies of the Communist Party, his writings anticipate elements of postwar radical existentialism, leaving the contemporary reader with an ambiguous image of Nizan's political standing.

The term was originated by the psychologist C. Lloyd Morgan in 1922 in his Gifford Lectures at St. Andrews, which would later be published as the 1923 book Emergent Evolution.Bowler, Peter J. (2001). Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain. University of Chicago Press. pp. 140-142, pp. 376-384. The hypothesis was widely criticized for providing no mechanism to how entirely new properties emerge, and for its historical roots in teleology.McLaughlin, Brian P. (1992). The Rise and Fall of British Emergentism. In A. Beckerman, H. Flohr, and J. Kim, eds., Emergence or Reduction? Essays on the Prospects of Nonreductive Physicalism. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. pp. 49‚Äì93. Baylis, Charles A. (1929). The Philosophic Functions of Emergence. The Philosophical Review. Vol. 38, No. 4. pp. 372-384. Historical context The term emergent was first used to describe the concept by George Lewes in volume two of his 1875 book Problems of Life and Mind (p. 412). Henri Bergson covered similar themes in his popular 1907 book Creative Evolution on the √âlan vital. Emergence was further developed by Samuel Alexander in his Gifford Lectures at Glasgow during 1916‚Äì18 and published as Space, Time, and Deity (1920). The related term emergent evolution was coined by C. Lloyd Morgan in his own Gifford lectures of 1921‚Äì22 at St. Andrews and published as Emergent Evolution (1923). In an appendix to a lecture in his book, Morgan acknowledged the contributions of Roy Wood Sellars's Evolutionary Naturalism (1922).  Origins = Response to Darwin's Origin of Species  Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace's presentation of natural selection, coupled to the idea of evolution in Western thought, had gained acceptance due to the wealth of observational data provided and the seeming replacement of divine law with natural law in the affairs of men. However, the mechanism of natural selection described at the time only explained how organisms adapted to variation. The cause of genetic variation was unknown at the time. St. George Jackson Mivart's On the Genesis of Species (1872) and Edward Cope's Origin of the Fittest (1887) raised the need to address the origin of variation between members of a species. William Bateson in 1884 distinguished between the origin of novel variations and the action of natural selection (Materials for the Study of Variation Treated with Especial Regard to Discontinuity in the Origin of Species).  Wallace's further thoughts  Wallace throughout his life continued to support and extend the scope of Darwin's theory of evolution via the mechanism of natural selection. One of his works, Darwinism, was often cited in support of Darwin's theory. He also worked to elaborate and extend Darwin and his ideas on natural selection. However, Wallace also realized that the scope and claim of the theory was limited. Darwin himself had limited it. In examining this aspect, excluded ab initio by Darwin, Wallace came to the conclusion that Life itself cannot be understood except by means of a theory that includes \\"an organising and directive Life-Principle.\\" These necessarily involve a \\"Creative Power\\", a \\"directive Mind\\" and finally \\"an ultimate Purpose\\" (the development of Man). It supports the view of John Hunter that \\"life is the cause, not the consequence\\" of the organisation of matter. Thus, life precedes matter and when it infuses matter, forms living matter (protoplasm). Wallace then refers to the operation of another power called \\"mind\\" that utilizes the power of life and is connected with a higher realm than life or matter: Proceeding from Hunter's view that Life is the directive power above and behind living matter, Wallace argues that logically, Mind is the cause of consciousness, which exists in different degrees and kinds in living matter.  Emergent evolution = Early roots  The issue of how change in nature 'emerged' can be found in classical Greek thought - order coming out of chaos and whether by chance or necessity. Aristotle spoke of wholes that were greater than the sum of their parts because of emergent properties. The second-century anatomist and physiologist Galen also distinguished between the resultant and emergent qualities of wholes. (Reid, p. 72) Hegel spoke of the revolutionary progression of life from non-living to conscious and then to the spiritual and Kant perceived that simple parts of an organism interact to produce a progressively complex series of emergences of functional forms, a distinction that carried over to John Stuart Mill (1843), who stated that even chemical compounds have novel features that cannot be predicted from their elements. [Reid, p. 72] The idea of an emergent quality that was something new in nature was further taken up by George Henry Lewes (1874‚Äì1875), who again noted, as with Galen earlier, that these evolutionary \\"emergent\\" qualities are distinguishable from adaptive, additive \\"resultants.\\" Henry Drummond in The Descent of Man (1894) stated that emergence can be seen in the fact that the laws of nature are different for the organic or vital compared to the inertial inorganic realm. As Reid points out, Drummond also realized that greater complexity brought greater adaptability. (Reid. p. 73) Samuel Alexander took up the idea that emergences had properties that overruled the demands of the lower levels of organization. And more recently, this theme is taken up by John Holland (1998):  C. Lloyd Morgan and emergent evolution  Another major scientist to question natural selection as the motive force of evolution was C. Lloyd Morgan, a zoologist and student of T.H. Huxley, who had a strong influence on Samuel Alexander. His Emergent Evolution (1923) established the central idea that an emergence might have the appearance of saltation but was best regarded as \\"a qualitative change of direction or critical turning point.\\"(quoted in Reid, p. 73-74) Morgan, due to his work in animal psychology, had earlier (1894) questioned the continuity view of mental evolution, and held that there were various discontinuities in cross-species mental abilities. To offset any attempt to read anthropomorphism into his view, he created the famous, but often misunderstood methodological canon: However, Morgan realizing that this was being misused to advocate reductionism (rather than as a general methodological caution), introduced a qualification into the second edition of his An Introduction to Comparative Psychology (1903): As Reid observes, Morgan also fought against the behaviorist school and clarified even more his emergent views on evolution: His Animal Conduct (1930) explicitly distinguishes between three \\"grades\\" or \\"levels of mentality\\" which he labeled: 'percipient, perceptive, and reflective.' (p. 42)  Alexander and the emergence of mind  Morgan's idea of a polaric relationship between lower and higher, was taken up by Samuel Alexander, who argued that the mental process is not reducible to the neural processes on which it depends at the physical-material level. Instead, they are two poles of a unity of function. Further, the neural process that expressed mental process itself possesses a quality (mind) that the other neural processes don‚Äôt. At the same time, the mental process, because it is functionally identical to this particular neural process, is also a vital one. And mental process is also \\"something new, \\"a fresh creation\\", which precludes a psycho-physiological parallelism. Reductionism is also contrary to empirical fact. At the same time Alexander stated that his view was not one of animism or vitalism, where the mind is an independent entity action on the brain, or conversely, acted upon by the brain. Mental activity is an emergent, a new \\"thing\\" not reducible to its initial neural parts. For Alexander, the world unfolds in space-time, which has the inherent quality of motion. This motion through space-time results in new ‚Äúcomplexities of motion‚Äù in the form of a new quality or emergent. The emergent retains the qualities of the prior ‚Äúcomplexities of motion‚Äù but also has something new that was not there before. This something new comes with its own laws of behavior. Time is the quality that creates motion through Space, and matter is simply motion expressed in forms in Space, or as Alexander says a little later, ‚Äúcomplexes of motion.‚Äù Matter arises out of the basic ground of Space-Time continuity and has an element of ‚Äúbody‚Äù (lower order) and an element of ‚Äúmind‚Äù (higher order), or ‚Äúthe conception that a secondary quality is the mind of its primary substrate.‚Äù Mind is an emergent from life and life itself is an emergent from matter. Each level contains and is interconnected with the level and qualities below it, and to the extent that it contains lower levels, these aspects are subject to the laws of that level. All mental functions are living, but not all living functions are mental; all living functions are physico-chemical, but not all physico-chemical processes are living - just as we could say that all people living in Ohio are Americans, but not all Americans live in Ohio. Thus, there are levels of existence, or natural jurisdictions, within a given higher level such that the higher level contains elements of each of the previous levels of existence. The physical level contains the pure dimensionality of Space-Time in addition to the emergent of physico-chemical processes; the next emergent level, life, also contains Space-Time as well as the physico-chemical in addition to the quality of life; the level of mind contains all of the previous three levels, plus consciousness. As a result of this nesting and inter-action of emergents, like fluid Russian dolls, higher emergents cannot be reduced to lower ones, and different laws and methods of inquiry are required for each level. For Alexander, the \\"directing agency\\" or entelechy is found \\"in the principle or plan\\". While an emergent is a higher complexity, it also results in a new simplicity as it brings a higher order into what was previously less ordered (a new simplex out of a complex). This new simplicity does not carry any of the qualities or aspects of that emergent level prior to it, but as noted, does still carry within it such lower levels so can be understood to that extent through the science of such levels, yet not itself be understood except by a science that is able to reveal the new laws and principles applicable to it. The concept or idea of mind, the highest emergent known to us, being at our level, extends all the way down to pure dimensionality or Space-Time. In other words, time is the ‚Äúmind‚Äù of motion, materialising is the ‚Äúmind‚Äù of matter, living the ‚Äúmind‚Äù of life. Motion through pure time (or life astronomical, mind ideational) emerges as matter ‚Äúmaterialising‚Äù (geological time, life geological, mind existential), and this emerges as life ‚Äúliving‚Äù (biological time, life biological, mind experiential), which in turn give us mind ‚Äúminding‚Äù (historical time, life historical, mind cognitional). But there is also an extension possible upwards of mind to what we call Deity. Alexander goes back to the Greek idea of knowledge being ‚Äúout there‚Äù in the object being contemplated. In that sense, there is not mental object (concept) ‚Äúdistinct‚Äù (that is, different in state of being) from the physical object, but only an apparent split between the two, which can then be brought together by proper compresence or participation of the consciousness in the object itself. Because of the interconnectedness of the universe by virtue of Space-Time, and because the mind apprehends space, time and motion through a unity of sense and mind experience, there is a form of knowing that is intuitive (participative) - sense and reason are outgrowths from it. In a sense, the universe is a participative one and open to participation by mind as well so that mind can intuitively know an object, contrary to what Kant asserted. Participation (togetherness) is something that is ‚Äúenjoyed‚Äù (experienced) not contemplated, though in the higher level of consciousness, it would be contemplated. Robert G. B. Reid Emergent evolution was revived by Robert G. B. Reid (March 20, 1939 - May 28, 2016), a biology professor at the University of Victoria (in British Columbia, Canada). In his book Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis (1985), he stated that the modern evolutionary synthesis with its emphasis on natural selection is an incomplete picture of evolution, and emergent evolution can explain the origin of genetic variation.Williams, Mary B. (1986). Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid. The Quarterly Review of Biology. Vol. 61, No. 2, p. 266.Cornell, John F. (1987). Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid. Journal of the History of Biology. Vol. 20, No. 3. pp. 424-425. Biologist Ernst Mayr heavily criticized the book claiming it was a misinformed attack on natural selection. Mayr commented that Reid was working from an \\"obsolete conceptual framework\\", provided no solid evidence and that he was arguing for a teleological process of evolution.Mayr, Ernst. (1986). Evolutionary Theory: The Unfinished Synthesis by Robert G. B. Reid. Isis. Vol. 77, No. 2, pp. 358-359. Reid later published the book Biological Emergences (2007) with a theory on how emergent novelties are generated in evolution.Rose, Christopher S. (2008). Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment by Robert G. B. Reid. Integrative and Comparative Biology. Vol. 48, No. 6. pp. 871-873.\\"Biological Emergences\\". MIT Press. According to Massimo Pigliucci \\"Biological Emergences by Robert Reid is an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate on the status of evolutionary theory, but it is hard to separate the good stuff from the more dubious claims.\\" Pigliucci noted a dubious claim in the book is that natural selection has no role in evolution.Pigliucci, Massimo. (2009). \\"Down with Natural Selection?\\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine. 52: 134-140. It was positively reviewed by biologist Alexander Badyaev who commented that \\"the book succeeds in drawing attention to an under appreciated aspect of the evolutionary process\\".Badyaev, Alexander V. (2008). Evolution Despite Natural Selection? Emergence Theory and the Ever Elusive Link Between Adaptation and Adaptability. Acta Biotheoretica 56: 249-255. Others have criticized Reid's unorthodox views on emergence and evolution. Biologist Samuel Scheiner stated that Reid's \\"presentation is both a caricature of evolutionary theory and severely out of date.\\"Scheiner, Samuel M. (2004). The Metamorphosis of Evo- Devo.

History and production In 1994, Marillion released their seventh studio album Brave. A concept album inspired by a news story singer/lyricist Steve Hogarth had heard about an amnesiac girl found wandering the Severn Bridge, the album follows a fictional account of the girl's life and the events that led her there. After the release of the album, Marillion expressed a desire to create a video out of the album's concept in a manner comparable to Pink Floyd's The Wall. The band's then-label EMI reluctantly agreed to this, despite the relatively poor sales of the album. Cult film director Richard Stanley, intrigued by the concept, agreed to sign on as the project's director. The music videos for Braves three singles - \\"The Great Escape\\", \\"Hollow Man\\" and \\"Alone Again in the Lap of Luxury\\" - were taken from this film. The run time of the film is 57 minutes; both the original VHS release and the 2004 re-issue on DVD additionally include a 30 minutes \\"making-of\\" documentary. Plot The film tells the story in pictures accompanied by the entire Brave record minus \\"Paper Lies\\" and the final song \\"Made Again\\". On the recording, it is left ambiguous as to whether the main character commits suicide in the end. In the film, she does. Thus, \\"Made Again\\", which concludes the story on the record as a happy ending of sorts, is not included. On the back of the cover of the videocassette, the description reads as follows: :Brave.. The Movie is a fifty-minute concept film directed by cult movie director Richard Stanley. It is Stanley's stark vision of a young life in the 90's inspired by Marillion's album of the same name, which centres around a teenage girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her consequent search for her past. Although this story bears similarities to actual recorded incidents in the history of the Severn Bridge we wish to stress that this is a work of fiction.

She was named for Daniel Patterson. Patterson was laid down on 29 March 1910 by William Cramp & Sons, Philadelphia; launched on 29 April 1911; sponsored by Miss Georgeanne Pollock Patterson; and commissioned on 11 October 1911, Lieutenant Commander John M. Luby in command. Pre-World War I Patterson departed Philadelphia on 23 October 1911, calling at Newport, Rhode Island, and New York City, before arriving at Boston on 2 November, her homeport for operations off the New England Coast, the Virginia Capes, and south to Charleston, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; and Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. She arrived off Vera Cruz from Pensacola on 20 May 1914 and headed home four days later. World War I As America entered World War I, Patterson patrolled along the New England Coast in the approaches to Newport and Boston to safeguard inbound trans-Atlantic convoys. One patrol mission took her as far north as St. Johns, Newfoundland. The first United States help to the hard-pressed allies was the assignment of US destroyers to the British Fleet to help combat enemy submarines that threatened to cut the sea lifelines to the British Isles. Patterson was the flagship of the second division of destroyers to cross the Atlantic on this mission. But the destroyers could not make it across the North Atlantic without refueling. Newly commissioned fleet oiler , whose executive officer and chief engineer was Lieutenant Chester W. Nimitz, stationed herself in mid-Atlantic, between Boston and Queenstown, Ireland. Patterson led Division 5 out of Boston Harbor on 21 May 1917 and made rendezvous with Maumee the morning of 28 May. She was the first destroyer to maneuver alongside Maumee to receive fuel oil enabling her to complete the Atlantic crossing. The division arrived Queenstown, Ireland, on 1 June 1917. There Patterson and her sister destroyers received British signal books and depth charges. Patterson began patrol and escort in the approaches to Queenstown on 5 June. On 12 June, she dropped depth charges to help drive away a German U-boat attacking SS Indian. A collision with His Majesty's tug Dreadful at the entrance to Berehaven Harbour, Ireland, the night of 1 January 1918, damaged Patterson's bow but she resumed regular escort and patrol on 5 February. Two days later she rescued 12 survivors of steamship Mexico City, torpedoed by a German submarine. Patterson, patrolling in the Irish Sea on 17 May, dropped depth charges that drove away German . She continued patrol out of Queenstown until 4 June, then departed for the United States. On 16 June, one day out of Bermuda, she rescued survivors of the Norwegian bark Kringsjaa, sunk by German . She landed the survivors at the Cape May Naval Station and continued on to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, arriving on 18 June for overhaul. She departed Norfolk, Virginia on 17 August for Tompkinsville, New York. There she joined the escort of battleship bound for Norfolk. On 22 August, she got underway from that base as flagship of the ‚ÄúPatterson Group‚Äù, a special hunting squadron that included 11 submarine chasers. The Patterson Group hunted U-boats north from the Virginia Capes to New York. When cargoman Felix Taussig mistook submarine chaser for an enemy submarine and opened fire on 27 August, Patterson helped rescue the survivors and carried seven of the injured into New York Harbor for transfer to US Navy hospital ship . She dropped depth charges to drive away a German U-boat on 3 September, continuing hunter-killer patrols along the eastern seaboard until the special hunting group disbanded on 23 November. Inter-war period Patterson entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 1 January 1919, remaining there until she was transferred to the US Coast Guard on 28 April 1924. She was stationed at Stapleton, New York and part of the Rum Patrol. Returned to the Navy on 18 October 1930, she remained inactive until her name was cancelled on 1 July 1933 to permit its assignment to . Her hulk was sold for scrapping on 2 May 1934 in accordance with the London Naval Treaty. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 June.

It is referred to by the common name pampas grass, and is native to southern South America, including the Pampas region after which it is named. Etymology Cortaderia is derived from the Argentine Spanish name ‚Äòcortadera‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòcutter‚Äô, in reference to its razor sharp leaf margins.Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). pp 122, 348 Selloana is named for Friedrich Sellow (1789-1831), a German botanist and naturalist from Potsdam who worked as a plant collector in Brazil. He studied the flora of South America, especially that of Brazil. The specific epithet selloana was given by Josef August and Julius Hermann Schultes in 1827. 180px Cultivars Big tuft of pampas grass in Jindai Botanical Garden (Tokyo, Japan), height and diameter , more than 40 years old as of 2007 Several cultivars are available, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:-. *Aureolineata *Evita *Monstrosa *Patagonia *Pumila *Silver Feather Notcort *Sunningdale Silver ‚Äîgrows to a height of and has particularly dense flowering plumes Negative impact Cortaderia has become invasive throughout North America. It has also been banned in Hawaii and New Zealand because of its ability to outgrow and displace native plants. In Europe, it was first introduced in the United Kingdom, later spreading to other countries in the continent like Ireland, Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy. Pampas grass is fast-growing and can form large masses along the roads, cliffs, riverbanks, and open areas that have been disturbed by human activities or natural disturbances. Pampas grass can displace native plants and create their habitats, which deplete biodiversity. The blade-like leaves may cause physical harm to the birds who feed off of it. The plant also competes with other native plants by monopolizing resources like shade, sunlight, and ground nutrients. Because of the large surface area, the leaves pose a significant fire hazard if placed near flammable substances. Control methods Pampas grass can be controlled through pesticide treatment. To accomplish this, the grass is cut down near the base. Next, a 2% glyphosate chemical solution is combined with a silicone-based surfactant and applied to enhance the penetration potential. This method works best in the fall because there is overall better control compared to other seasons. Another control method is to cut and bag inflorescences to prevent seeds from spreading or pulling seedlings. Soil disturbance that creates bare ground can promote invasion, so it is essential to minimize disturbance or provide competition to seedlings. In order to control disturbance, applying mulch to exposed bare ground to smother seeds and prevent germination can be done. Also, planting or seeding desirable, non-invasive plants can provide competition to reduce germination and seedling establishment. Culture Author Li Hengrui (), whose work Kite Capriccio () describes life as a child in 1950s Fengtai County, Anhui mentions the use of the long stem of the Puwei (, Chinese for Cortaderia selloana) in the construction of kites.Putonghua Shuiping Ceshi Gangyao. 2004. Beijing. pp.350-351. Several media outlets reported that it was planted by some couples who practise swinging in the United Kingdom as a way to indicate to other swingers that they enjoy that lifestyle, based on a post on Twitter. The reports caused a plunge in already declining sales, but the odd association has been dismissed by enthusiasts and gardening experts as \\"silly\\".

As tires are used, the tread is worn off, limiting its effectiveness in providing traction. A worn tire can often be retreaded. The word tread is often used casually to refer to the pattern of grooves molded into the rubber, but those grooves are correctly called the tread pattern, or simply the pattern. The grooves are not the tread, they are in the tread. This distinction is especially significant in the case of racing slicks, which have much tread but no grooves.  Tires  Common tire tread pattern.  Street tires  The grooves in the rubber are designed to allow water to be expelled from beneath the tire and prevent hydroplaning. The proportion of rubber to air space on the road surface directly affects its traction. Design of tire tread has an effect upon noise generated, especially at freeway speeds.C.Michael Hogan, Analysis of highway noise, Journal of Water, Air, & Soil Pollution, Volume 2, Number 3, Biomedical and Life Sciences and Earth and Environmental Science Issue, Pages 387-392, September, 1973, Springer Verlag, Netherlands Generally there is a tradeoff of tread friction capability; deeper patterns often enhance safety, but simpler designs are less costly to produce and actually may afford some roadway noise mitigation. Tires intended for dry weather use will be designed with minimal pattern to increase the contact patch. Tires with a smooth tread (i.e., having no tread pattern) are known as slicks and are generally used for racing only, since they are quite dangerous if the road surface is wet. Street tires will also include wear limit indicators in the form of small raised bridges within the grooves. When the tread is worn down enough that the limit indicators make contact with the road, the tire is deemed to be at the end of its service life. Brake pads use similar indicators in the form of notches on their surface that disappear when they are used.  Snow tires  Snow tires or Winter tires are tires designed for use in colder weather, snow and ice. To improve traction, they are made of different rubber and have a different tread pattern from regular street tires.  Off-road tires  Studded mountain bike tires for icy conditions. Off-road tires used in mud or dirt feature individual knob patterns to allow the tire to bite into the surface and lever the sides of the tread to get a better grip. Given the smaller contact patch, these tires tend to wear quickly when used on asphalt (depending on type of rubber).  Mountain bike and motorcycle tires  Mountain bike and some motorcycle tires feature tread similar to off-road tires used on cars and trucks but may sometimes include an unbroken tread that runs along its center. This feature provides better traction and lower noise on asphalt at high speed and on high tire pressure, but retains the ability to provide grip on a soft or loose surface- lower tire pressure or soft ground will cause the side lugs to come into contact with the surface. Road bike tires may have shallow grooves for aesthetic purposes, but such grooves are unnecessary in narrow applications.http://www.sheldonbrown.com/brandt/slicks.html  Continuous tracks  The tread of a construction machine's tracks. Continuous tracks such as those used on military tanks or construction machines (i.e. caterpillar tracks) have metal track segments which may be rubber-coated. They usually do not feature tread patterns, because these would offer little additional grip given the weight of the tracked vehicle. Traction is usually provided by grousers instead.

Mother Moran had three adult children‚ÄîTerry, Frances, and Eileen‚Äîwhose troubles she dealt with using what promotional materials called \\"warm-hearted understanding and a common-sense philosophy.\\"\\"A Synopsis of the Story to Date\\" from \\"Today's Children\\" Family Album (1935, Pillsbury advertising premium). The creation of the series was a direct result of Phillips' resignation from her pioneering WGN series Painted Dreams when the station refused to allow her to take the program to a network. As a result of the station's decision, she created Children for NBC-owned WMAQ as a thinly disguised version of the earlier series. Mother Moran was based on Mother Moynahan the mother-in-law of WGN station manager Harry Gilman, and Lucy Gilman's grandmother. The series ended on December 31, 1937, replaced in the new year by another Phillips creation, Woman in White. In 1937 a novel was published in book form by Pillsbury Flour Mills Company based on the radio program and given the same name (\\"Today's Children\\"). The copyright was held by the National Broadcasting Company. No author was cited in the book. The book was illustrated with line drawings depicting the action, as well as photographs of the leading characters in the show - identified by their character names only. Characters A 1935 Pillsbury advertising premium describes the characters as follows. *Mary \\"Mother\\" Moran: \\"The widowed mother of Terry, Frances and Eileen -- a typical American family of today. So big is her heart that its loving kindness has taken in all the others--the people she calls her \\"family of Today's Children.\\" Her quiet old-fashioned philosophy has brought peace and understanding to all the members of her family in times of trouble, for hers is a philosophy as sound and as enduring as the eternal hills‚Äîlove of family, love of home, and love of fellow man.\\" *Frances Moran: \\"The elder daughter, Frances, is twenty-five, tall and very blond. An ambitious, talented and successful commercial artist, she is typical of the modern business girl. Ordinarily practical and level-headed, she has occasionally let the dictates of her heart lead her into difficulties, but has a way of regaining her balance.\\" *Eileen Moran: \\"The youngest of Mother Moran's children, she is perhaps her mother's secret favorite. Petite, dark and unsophisticated Eileen, at twenty has secured a foothold on the ladder of artistic success through her beautiful singing voice. Yet today she is not quite so sure that her first ambition--to have a career--is more worthwhile than love, family and a home.\\" *Terry Moran: \\"Mother Moran's 'first born,' Terry is thirty-three, tall, and like his sister Eileen, dark. He has had his ups and downs, but is now well established as an executive of an advertising agency. A devoted father and husband, his deep affection for little Lucy and Bobbie, and for his wife, Dorothy, is generally concealed by his undemonstrative manner.\\" *Dot: \\"In Dorothy, we find the typical young mother of today, meeting the new and yet old problems of wifehood and motherhood with present-day intelligence and spirit. She has been obliged to live in close contact with her husband's family because of economic necessity, but has met the situation with rare sympathy and understanding.\\" *Lucy: \\"'Do you know what?' characterizes little Lucy, the self-appointed bearer of news between the various households of 'Today's Children.' This pert but intelligent youngster, who recently celebrated her tenth birthday, has been a constant source of joy, and amusement, and affection, to the entire family.\\" *Dick Crane: \\"Richard Crane, Bob's brother, is twenty-two, dark and impulsive. He is typical of the farm boy who has tasted both college and the city and so feels that he can never reconcile himself to future on the farm, even though business connections have help him there until very recently. He is eager and ambitious to rise in the world.\\" *Bob Crane: \\"The idealism that characterizes Robert Crane may have come from his childhood spent on a farm. His fine family background, together with his early contact with Mother Nature, have given him high ideals and a broad understanding and tolerance. At thirty, he is a successful young attorney, becoming more and more involved in reform politics.\\" *Kay: \\"A dark, striking brunette of twenty-eight, Mrs. Robert Crane (Katherine Norton) is at times wholheartedly generous toward others, and again utterly selfish in her desire for happiness. She was a successful young business woman before her marriage, but felt she had realized her fondest dream when she became a wife and home-maker.\\" 1943-1950 series Six years following the end of the original series, Phillips created a new serial bearing the Today's Children title which began on December 13, 1943 over NBC, related to the original series only by its general dramatic themes and the setting of Chicago's Hester Street. The new serial followed the family of Mama and Papa Schultz, played Virginia Payne and Murray Forbes. Originally, the series was one of three Phillips-created serials which made up the General Mills Hour, with characters and plots crossing over between Children, The Guiding Light, and Woman In White. Although Phillips was integral in plotting the revived series, the dialogue was written by Virginia Cooke. The second version of Today's Children ended on June 2, 1950.

He grew up in East Sussex, and is particularly known for his watercolours of the South Downs and other English landscapes, which examine English landscape and vernacular art with an off-kilter, modernist sensibility and clarity. He served as a war artist, and died when the aircraft he was in was lost off Iceland. Life May, woodcut of the Long Man of Wilmington by Eric Ravilious, 1925. Ravilious was born on 22 July 1903 in Churchfield Road, Acton, London, the son of Frank Ravilious and his wife Emma (n√©e Ford). While he was still a small child the family moved to Eastbourne in Sussex, where his parents ran an antique shop.Constable, 1982, p. 14. Ravilious was educated at Eastbourne Grammar School. In 1919 he won a scholarship to Eastbourne School of Art and in 1922 another to study at the Design School at the Royal College of Art. There he became close friends with Edward Bawden (his 1930 painting of Bawden at work is in the collection of the college) and, from 1924, studied under Paul Nash. Nash, an enthusiast for wood-engraving, encouraged him in the technique, and was impressed enough by his work to propose him for membership of the Society of Wood Engravers in 1925, and helped him to get commissions.Constable, 1982, p. 17. In 1925 Ravilious received a travelling scholarship to Italy and visited Florence, Siena, and the hill towns of Tuscany.Constable, 1982, p. 16. Following this he began teaching part-time at the Eastbourne School of Art, and from 1930 taught (also part-time) at the Royal College of Art.Constable, 1982, p. 11. In the same year he married Eileen Lucy \\"Tirzah\\" Garwood, also an artist and engraver, whom he met at Eastbourne College of Art. They had three children: John Ravilious (1935-2014); the photographer James Ravilious (1939-1999); and Anne Ullmann (1941- ), editor of books on her parents and their work.James Russell, ‚ÄòGarwood, Eileen Lucy [Tirzah] (1908‚Äì1951)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2016 accessed 12 Oct 2016 In 1928 Ravilious, Bawden and Charles Mahoney painted a series of murals at Morley College in south London on which they worked for a whole year. Their work was described by J. M. Richards as \\"sharp in detail, clean in colour, with an odd humour in their marionette-like figures\\" and \\"a striking departure from the conventions of mural painting at that time\\", but was destroyed by bombing in 1941. Between 1930 and 1932 Ravilious and Garwood lived in Hammersmith, west London, where there is a blue plaque on the wall of their house at the corner of Upper Mall and Weltje Road. The building looks out onto The Boat Race course, and the couple held bathing and boat-race parties. When Ravilious and Bawden graduated from the RCA they began exploring the Essex countryside in search of rural subjects to paint. Bawden rented Brick House in Great Bardfield as a base and when he married Charlotte Epton, his father bought it for him as a wedding present. Ravilious and Garwood lodged in Brick House with the Bawdens until 1934 when they purchased Bank House at Castle Hedingham, which is now also marked by a blue plaque. There were eventually several other Great Bardfield Artists. In 1933 Ravilious and his wife painted murals at the Midland Hotel in Morecambe.Constable, 1982, p. 22. In November 1933, Ravilious held his first solo exhibition at the Zwemmer Gallery in London, titled \\"An Exhibition of Water-Colour Drawings\\". Twenty of the 37 works displayed were sold. A 1933 painting of Ravilious and Edward Bawden, by Michael Rothenstein, was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in 2012. Printmaking and illustration Caravans, watercolour, 1936 Ravilious engraved more than 400 illustrations and drew over 40 lithographic designs for books and publications during his lifetime.Edward Bawden, Design. Antique Collector's Club, Woodbridge, England. . His first commission, in 1926, was to illustrate a novel for Jonathan Cape. He went on to produce work both for large companies such as the Lanston Corporation and smaller, less commercial publishers, such as the Golden Cockerel Press (for whom he illustrated an edition of Twelfth Night), the Curwen Press and the Cresset Press. His woodcut of two Victorian gentlemen playing cricket has appeared on the front cover of every edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack since 1938. His style of wood-engraving was greatly influenced by that of Thomas Bewick, whom both he and Bawden admired. Ravilious in turn influenced other wood engravers, such as Gwenda Morgan who also depicted scenes in the South Downs and was commissioned by the Golden Cockerel Press. In the mid-1930s Ravilious took up lithography, making a print of Newhaven Harbour for the \\"Contemporary Lithographs\\" scheme, and a set of full-page lithographs, mostly of shop interiors, for a book called High Street, with text by J. M. Richards.Constable, 1982, p. 29. Following a trip in a submarine in the war he produced Submarine Dream, a set of 11 lithographs.Submarine Dream, Goldmark Press Design Alphabet mug by Eric Ravilious, transfer printing on Wedgwood creamware, 1937. In February 1936, Ravilious held his second exhibition at the Zwemmer Gallery and again it was a success, with 28 out of the 36 paintings shown being sold. This exhibition also led to a commission from Wedgwood for ceramic designs. His work for them included a commemorative mug to mark the abortive coronation of Edward VIII; the design was revised for the coronation of George VI. Other popular Ravilious designs included the Alphabet mug of 1937, and the china sets, Afternoon Tea (1938), Travel (1938), and Garden Implements (1939), plus the Boat Race Day cup in 1938. Production of Ravilious' designs continued into the 1950s, with the coronation mug design being posthumously reworked for the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953. He also undertook glass designs for Stuart Crystal in 1934, graphic advertisements for London Transport and furniture work for Dunbar Hay in 1936. Ravilious and Bawden were both active in the campaign by the Artists' International Association to support the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War. Throughout 1938 and 1939, Ravilious spent time working in Wales, the south of France and at Aldeburgh to prepare works for his third one-man show, which was held at the Arthur Tooth & Sons Gallery in 1939. Watercolour Apart from a brief experimentation with oils in 1930 ‚Äì inspired by the works of Johan Zoffany ‚Äì Ravilious painted almost entirely in watercolour.Constable, 1982, p. 21. He was especially inspired by the landscape of the South Downs around Beddingham. He frequently returned to Furlongs, the cottage of Peggy Angus. He said that his time there \\"altered my whole outlook and way of painting, I think because the colour of the landscape was so lovely and the design so beautifully obvious ... that I simply had to abandon my tinted drawings\\". Some of his works, such as Tea at Furlongs, were painted there.  Murals  Ravilious was commissioned to paint murals on the walls of the tea room on Victoria Pier at Colwyn Bay in 1934. After the pier's partial collapse, these were thought unrecoverable, but, as of March 2018, one had been recovered in pieces and it was hoped that a second could also be saved, along with parts of another by Mary Adshead, from the pier's auditorium. Conwy Council's conservation officer, Huw Davies, said: War artist HMS Glorious in the Arctic, 1940 (Art IWM ART LD 283) Morning on the Tarmac, 1941 (Art. IWM ART LD 1712) Prior to the outbreak of WWII Ravilious aligned himself with anti-fascist causes, including lending his work to the 1937 exhibition Artists Against Fascism. He considered joining the military as a rifleman but was deterred by friends; he joined a Royal Observer Corps post in Hedingham at the outbreak of war. He was then accepted as a full-time salaried artist by the War Artists' Advisory Committee in December 1939. He was given the rank of Honorary Captain in the Royal MarinesThe London Gazette Publication date: 8 March 1940 Issue: 34807 Page: 1394 and assigned to the Admiralty. In February 1940, he reported to the Royal Naval barracks at Chatham Dockyard. While based there he painted ships at the dockside, barrage balloons at Sheerness and other coastal defences. Dangerous Work at Low Tide, 1940 depicts bomb disposal experts approaching a German magnetic mine on Whitstable Sands. Two members of the team Ravilious painted were later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. On 24 May 1940 Ravilious sailed to Norway aboard HMS Highlander which was escorting HMS Glorious and the force being sent to recapture Narvik. Highlander returned to Scapa Flow before departing for Norway a second time on 31 May 1940. From the deck of Highlander, Ravilious painted scenes of both HMS Ark Royal and HMS Glorious in action. HMS Glorious in the Arctic depicts Hawker Hurricanes and Gloster Gladiators landing on the deck of Glorious as part of the evacuation of forces from Norway on 7/8 June. The following evening Glorious was sunk, with great loss of life. On returning from Norway, Ravilious was posted to Portsmouth from where he painted submarine interiors at Gosport and coastal defences at Newhaven. After Ravilious's third child was born in April 1941, the family moved out of Bank House to Ironbridge Farm near Shalford, Essex. The rent on this property was paid partly in cash and partly in paintings, which are among the few private works Ravilious completed during the war. In October 1941 Ravilious transferred to Scotland, having spent six months based at Dover. In Scotland, Ravilious first stayed with John Nash and his wife at their cottage on the Firth of Forth and painted convoy subjects from the signal station on the Isle of May. At the Royal Naval Air Station in Dundee, Ravilious drew, and sometimes flew in, the Supermarine Walrus seaplanes based there. In early 1942, Ravilious was posted to York but shortly afterwards was allowed to return home to Shalford when his wife was taken ill. There he worked on his York paintings and requested a posting to a nearby RAF base while Garwood recovered. He spent a short time at RAF Debden before moving to RAF Sawbridgeworth in Hertfordshire. At Sawbridgeworth he began flying regularly in the de Havilland Tiger Moths based at the flying school there and would sketch other planes in flight from the rear cockpit of the plane. Death On 28 August 1942 Ravilious flew to Reykjav√≠k in Iceland and then travelled on to RAF Kaldadarnes. The day he arrived there, 1 September, a Lockheed Hudson aircraft had failed to return from a patrol. The next morning three aircraft were despatched at dawn to search for the missing plane and Ravilious opted to join one of the crews. The aircraft he was on also failed to return and after four days of further searching, the RAF declared Ravilious and the four-man crew lost in action. His body was never recovered and he is commemorated on the Chatham Naval Memorial.Casualty Details: Ravilious, Eric William, Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The log book belonging to the pilot of the fatal flight, in the possession of the pilot's daughter, with a hand-written note \\"failed to return\\", and an RAF official stamp \\"death presumed\\", was shown on the BBC Television programme Antiques Roadshow in March 2020. In 1946 Ravilious's widow married Anglo-Irish radio producer Henry Swanzy.

Australia Station G was an Omega transmitter that used an umbrella antenna carried by a tall grounded lattice steel guyed mast. Unlike many of the other Omega Transmitters, Woodside was not a \\"hot tower,\\" that is, one which is insulated from a ground connection by large ceramic insulators that support the entire weight of the structure. Rather, the tower was electrically insulated from the topmost guys which served as the radiators, similar to the metal radials of an umbrella without cloth covering. The mast simply supported the downward sloping guy wires which are the active elements. The guy wires were also used to hold the tower itself in place.

Pioneered by Victor Gollancz, it offered a monthly book choice, for sale to members only, as well as a newsletter that acquired the status of a major political magazine. It also held an annual rally. Membership peaked at 57,000, but after the Soviet-Nazi non-aggression pact of 1939, it disowned its large Communist element, and subsequent years of paper-rationing, during and after the war, led to further decline. It ceased publishing in 1948. The concept and series was revived in 2015,Kit Caless, \\"Inside the UK's Most Radical Indie Publishers, Part Four: Pluto Press\\", Huck Magazine, June 6, 2018. following at least one earlier effort to relaunch the series in the early 2000s. Early success and organisation Two books in editions from the Left Book Club: In Search of the Millennium, by Julius Braunthal (1945), and On the Top of the World by L. Brontman (1938) The Left Book Club, founded in May 1936, was a key left-wing institution of the late 1930s and the 1940s in the United Kingdom. It was set up by Stafford Cripps, Victor Gollancz and John Strachey to revitalise and educate the British Left.... The club's aim was to \\"help in the struggle for world peace and against fascism\\". Aiming to break even with 2,500 members, it had 40,000 within the first year and by 1939 it was up to 57,000. The LBC was one of the first book clubs in the UK and, as such, played an important role in the evolution of the country's book trade.Edwards, Ruth Dudley (1987) Victor Gollancz: A Biography, P. 231, Victor Gollancz Ltd Historian Michael Newman says: > Between 1936 and 1939, the LBC provided hope for thousands of people who > were seeking a solution to the burning moral issues of the era. Despite its > pro-Communist line, the Club's socialist propaganda and education probably > ultimately strengthened the Labour Party and contributed to its victory in > the postwar election.Michael Newman, \\"Left Book Club\\" in Fred M. Leventhal, > ed., Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia (Garland, 1995) p. 448. The club supplied a book chosen every month by Gollancz and his panel (Harold Laski and John Strachey) to its members, many of whom took part in one of the 1,500 Left Discussion Groups scattered around the country. The books and pamphlets with their distinctive covers‚Äîorange for paperback (1936‚Äì1938) and red for hardback (1938‚Äì1948) editions‚Äîbore the legend \\"NOT FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC\\" and sold for 2s 6d to members. Many titles were available for sale only in the LBC edition, with monthly 'choices' received by all members; there were also reprints of current socialist and 'progressive' classics for members to buy. The volumes covered history, science, reporting and fiction and a range of other subjects, but always from a left-leaning perspective. In response, Christina Foyle founded the Right Book Club, to counter what she regarded as the pernicious influence of the Left Book Club. It offered a variety of titles with Conservative and classical Liberal themes.Right Book Club - Book Series List, publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 10 November 2019. 1936‚Äì1939: Popular Front Until the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939, the club's output included many authors who were members of the Communist Party of Great Britain or close to it, and many of its books offered a positive portrayal of the Soviet Union and its international policies. World Revolution: 1917‚Äì1936 by C. L. R. James was a Trotskyist critique of the LBC's coverage of the Soviet Union during this period.Nielsen, Aldon Lynn. C.L.R. James: A Critical Introduction. University Press of Mississippi, 1997 (p. 88). At the same time, Gollancz, as a member of the Labour Party, was concerned to keep the club at a formal distance from campaigns of which the Labour Party disapproved.Edwards (1987) pps. 229 & 241 Gollancz was a notoriously interventionist editor. He published Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier but insisted on prefacing its account of working-class life in the north of England with an introduction disowning the book's criticisms of middle-class socialists who, Orwell said, had little understanding of working class life. Later Gollancz republished the book leaving out the second part of which he disapproved. 1940‚Äì1948: War and its aftermath By early 1940, however, Gollancz had broken with the CP, a process documented in the articles collected in Betrayal of the Left in early 1941. Thereafter the club's selection of authors and titles reveals an eclectic mix. Despite its large membership and popular success the Book Club was always a huge financial drain on the publisher, and the advent of paper rationing at the onset of the war meant that the club was restricted to just one monthly title. To replace the book club's additional choices and augment the LBC selections, Gollancz launched the \\"Victory Books\\" series, a series of shorter monographs available to the general public. These included two of the biggest selling publications of the entire War period: Guilty Men (July 1940) by \\"Cato\\" (Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard) and Your M.P. (1944) by \\"Gracchus\\" (Tom Wintringham). In addition to books, the LBC also produced a monthly newsletter. This began as a simple club newssheet Left Book News, but gradually developed (as Left News) into a key periodical about international, political and social affairs, with lengthy editorials from Gollancz. The LBC held its first annual LBC rally in February 1937, and the tradition continued until the late 1940s.Edwards (1987) ps.238 Authors and titles, 1936‚Äì1948=1936‚Äì1939   (a defence of the first two Moscow Trials)  (praising the 1936 Soviet Constitution)    (defending the Popular Front and criticizing Trotsky)  1940‚Äì1948          Influence Alongside the Fabian Society and Transport House, the LBC's popularising of socialist ideas was a major influence behind the Labour victory in the general election of 1945. Many members of the club acted as missionaries for the ideas espoused by the club, such as full employment, socialised medicine, town planning and social equality. No less than eight Gollancz authors were part of the new Labour government (Lord Addison, Attlee, Bevan, Cripps, Philip Noel-Baker, Shinwell, Strachey and Wilkinson), and a further six were MPs (Maurice Edelman, Michael Foot, Elwyn Jones, J. P. W. Mallalieu, Stephen Swingler and Konni Zilliacus). This led Victor Gollancz's biographer to write, \\"for an individual without official position, Victor's [Gollancz's] colossal influence on a vital election remains unmatched in twentieth-century political history.\\"Edwards (1987) pp. 396 & 399 However, Gollancz was not rewarded with a position in the House of Lords by Clement Attlee who was worried he would become a thorn in his side there. The Left Book Club was accused of being under Soviet influence both financially and ideologically. One expression of this was its failure to publish Trotskyist writings critical of the USSR. Another example was Gollancz's refusal to publish George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia: he would not even read the manuscript. The success of the Left Book Club led to imitation by other parts of the UK's political spectrum. A \\"Right Book Club\\" was launched as a conservative response to the LBC in 1937 by Edgar Samuel, who worked for the bookselling firm Foyle's. Other political book clubs included the Liberal Book Club and the pacifist Peace Book Club. Historian A. J. P. Taylor points out the membership consisted largely of schoolteachers. Labour Party leaders were annoyed that the club was diverting high-minded middle-class Britons into reading communist tracts instead of joining the Labour Party.A. J. P. Taylor, English History: 1914‚Äì1945 (1965) p. 397. Taylor notes the crankiness in the choices of books made by Strachey, Laski, and Gollancz.

Taylor denies it was a subversive organisation, saying that \\"members of the Left Book Club worked off their rebelliousness by plodding through yet another orange-covered volume.\\"A. J. P. Taylor, Politicians, socialism and historians (1980) p. 189  Relaunch  Logo of the relaunched LBC (2015) In 2015 the Left Book Club was relaunched as a non- profit organisation with the aim of encouraging left-wing debate and discussion among its followers. Its first publication was Kevin Ovenden's Syriza: Inside the Labyrinth. Initially publishing four books a year in conjunction with Pluto Press, in October 2018 it stepped up its publishing programme to publish a book every month, working with a range of different publishers. The club remains not for profit and is funded by subscriptions and voluntary contributions. Books are selected by an editorial panel and are chosen to represent the best critical writing on left politics, economics, society and culture, written for a broad audience. Subscribers can choose from classic or contemporary writing. Each book is published in a unique LBC edition which is paid for through monthly subscriptions, and members organise their own reading groups to discuss the books. MP for Islington North Jeremy Corbyn offered wholehearted support to the project. \\"The relaunch of the Left Book Club is a terrific and timely idea, and will give intellectual ballast to the wave of political change sweeping Britain and beyond, encouraging informed and compassionate debate. I have a large collection of Left Book Club publications collected by my late parents and me. The works will open minds and inspire. I support the new LBC wholeheartedly.\\"The Left Book Club - News, leftbookclub.com (archive copy as at 31 Aug 2016). Retrieved 25 December 2018. ReferencesBibliography *Edwards, Ruth Dudley.

He is best known for inventing and giving his name to the derringer pistol. Early life Deringer was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, on October 26, 1786, to colonial gunsmith Henry Deringer Senior (1756-1833) and Catherine McQuety (1759‚Äì1829). The family moved to Philadelphia where his father continued work on the Kentucky rifle, both an ornate sporting model and a basic version for the U.S. Army. He sent his son to Richmond to apprentice with another gunsmith there. Henry Deringer moved back to Pennsylvania after serving his apprenticeship and set up shop in 1806 in Philadelphia, on Tamarind Street. He married Elizabeth Hollobush at the First Reformed Church in Philadelphia on April 5, 1810. According to McElroy's directory in 1841 Deringer had a house/gun shop at 370 North Front Street, Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania, PA. Work Deringer's early efforts were for military contracts, producing military pistols, muskets and rifles. Among those he produced was the Model 1814 Common Rifle and the Model 1817 Common Rifle. He produced trade rifles, designated for the Native American tribes, to fulfill the U.S. treaty obligations. His specialties became fine sporting rifles and dueling pistols. He stopped pursuing the government contracts by the mid-1840s. In 1825 he designed the first of the large caliber, short barreled pistols that would lead to considerable wealth and fame for himself. Using the basic flintlock action in common usage at the time, the pistols were muzzle loading single shots, or in some cases, double barreled in an over-under manner. Later models used the percussion cap action, although both actions were manufactured and sold for some time. For arms of his own design, he adopted the newer percussion cap technology, putting his pistol on the modern cutting edge. He was innovating; the percussion cap was perfected about 1820, and Deringer was marketing them by the 1830s, and possibly the mid-1820s. Name and trademark Deringer never claimed a patent for his pistols and the public bought them as fast as he produced them. Further development and copying of his design resulted in the derringer (note the double-r) pistol that was generically manufactured widely by other companies. There was widespread copying of his designs, included outright counterfeiting with his proofmarks being copied. One company even hired a tailor called \\"John\\" Deringer so that it could put the Deringer name on its firearms. Some of Deringer's workmen also left the company to set up their own duplicates, whilst others copied his pistols as closely as possible with some even putting on its Deringer name and trademark. Deringer fought these infringements for most of his business life. The Deringer v. Plate ruling, in which the California Supreme Court ruled in the company's favor, became a landmark in trademark law. Death Deringer died in 1868 at the age of 81 and was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Founded in 1660, Hopkins School is the third-oldest independent secondary school in the United States, following only the Collegiate School and Roxbury Latin School. Hopkins was established \\"for the breeding up of hopeful youths\\" with funds from Edward Hopkins' estate to fulfill John Davenport's wishes to bring a grammar school to New Haven. First situated on the town's green, it relocated to its current campus on a hill overlooking New Haven in 1926.History on Hopkins School's website by Thom Peters. Retrieved March 30, 2006. Hopkins has been coeducational since merging with Day Prospect Hill School in 1972. Hopkins is divided into three separate schools. The Junior school consists of the 7th and 8th grades. The high school is divided into the Middle (9th and 10th grade) and Upper (11th and 12th grade) schools. Most new students enter Hopkins in either the 7th or 9th grade.

In April 2010, Forbes Magazine named Hopkins the nineteenth best college preparatory school in the United States of America, and, as it was the only school from Connecticut on the list, the best college preparatory school in Connecticut.https://archive.is/20130124053419/http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/29/best- prep-schools-2010-opinions-hopkins-school.html History=Founding John Davenport, a founder of the New Haven Colony, was an early proponent of education in the colony.Chronicles of Hopkins Grammar School: 1660-1935\\\\. Thomas B Davis. Quinnipiack Press, New Haven, CT. 1938 Grammar schools of the time generally prepared young men for college, but the Puritan colony was too far from England for its citizens to attend the existing English schools. Parents of the time were generally more concerned with spending their money on essentials such as food, and viewed formal education as an extravagance most could not afford. Davenport enlisted the help of a friend, Edward Hopkins, governor of the Connecticut Colony, to found a traditional grammar school that would teach Latin, Greek, and Hebrew grammar. The school's first home was a building on the New Haven Green. The original Hopkins School coat of arms was designed by Edward Hopkins to be a personal symbol, though it was not an official piece of heraldry. Hopkins died in 1657 and bequeathed money to found a school dedicated to \\"the breeding up of hopeful youths for the public service of the country in future times.\\" Colonial officials wanted Hopkins's bequest to remain in Connecticut and appointed three men, Davenport and two others, as executors of Hopkins's will. They created the Hopkins Fund, from which Hopkins Grammar School was established in 1660.Hopkins Academy in Hadley, Massachusetts was founded in 1664 using these same funds. \\"The Charity Of Edward Hopkins: The Hazards Of Charitable Trusts In Colonial America (PDF).\\" John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. Retrieved: October 26, 2015. The exact date of Hopkins School's founding is a matter of definition. The historical record of the executors' report implies the trust was created on May 4, 1660, but since the Julian calendar was in use then, the date corresponds to May 14 on modern calendars. The papers which created the fund were presented and accepted on May 30, and many use this date as the official date of the school's founding. Finally, on June 4 (June 14 on modern calendars) Davenport transferred control of the bequest to the colony, on the condition that the colony accept responsibility for the support of the school. The Fallow Years \\"The Fallow Years\\" is a term coined by Thomas B. Davis in his history, Chronicles of Hopkins Grammar School, to describe the period from 1696 to 1853. During this time the school had difficulty finding qualified schoolmasters, and the Hopkins Fund often fell short in paying them. This forced the school to take up collections to meet its payroll. Consequently, there was great turnover in schoolmasters, some staying for no more than a year. Also contributing to the problem was the establishment of the Collegiate School in New Haven in 1701, which drew many local academics away from Hopkins, and which later became Yale University. Public opinion of Hopkins and academia in general weakened the school. During this time parents wanted children who could read and write English and understand basic arithmetic, but Hopkins continued to focus on subjects that parents deemed irrelevant, such as Latin. Parents were also displeased with schoolmasters who paid little attention to struggling students, instead focusing only on the scholars. On January 12, 1713, the committee which managed the Hopkins Fund began releasing ¬£12-¬£15 annually to run elementary English schools in East Haven and West Haven. New Haven stopped donating money to the Fund in 1719, which made hiring schoolmasters nearly impossible. Though the trustees of the Hopkins Fund constituted an independent body, the town was known to control them with financial pressures. Richard Mansfield served as schoolmaster from 1742 to 1747, and was the last headmaster until 1839 to serve for more than three years. Although Hopkins School was still somewhat unpopular with the locals, the school moved to a new larger brick building on the Green, due to the growth of New Haven. Hopkins School was somewhat rare among American schools in that it remained open during the American Revolutionary War. Former schoolmaster John Hotchkiss was killed by the British in July 1779 during their invasion of New Haven, and former schoolmaster Noah Williston was captured. Although the school remained open, records seem to indicate that it was frequently closed between September 1780 and October 1781, \\"for vacation\\". Shortly after the Revolution, Hopkins hired Jared Mansfield for two terms (1786‚Äì1790 and 1790‚Äì1795) to the unique position \\"Master of the Grammar School\\" to try to stabilize the school for the future. Between Mansfield's two terms, Abraham Bishop held a six-month term as headmaster during which he proposed radical reform, including making Hopkins coeducational, most of which never came to fruition. After the end of Mansfield's second term, the school returned to the pattern of short tenures for schoolmasters. Hopkins moved buildings again in 1803 to an even larger facility near the Green that took up nearly an entire block. Teachers were offered two-year contracts to teach at Hopkins, but rarely kept them. Hopkins boys grew \\"unruly and malicious\\", some roaming New Haven streets at night. In 1838 the school moved once again, as the trustees believed that moving the school away from the town center would allow its students to focus more on their studies. Throughout August and September that year, they rushed through the necessary transactions to buy the new plot of land, currently the site of the Yale Law School. Following this move the trustees released an announcement to New Haven's three newspapers summarizing their hope that this new location would provide sufficient space for the boys to learn and be separate enough that they could do so in peace. Henry Murphy. Baldwin ended up being built roughly between \\"The School\\" and \\"Masters House\\" on this plan. Hawley Olmstead became headmaster in 1839 and ended the line of short-termed schoolmasters as he held the position for ten years. Although Olmstead thought much like Hopkins' early masters, namely that the school existed to prepare boys for college, he also modernized the curriculum in several ways. Most notably, English was finally added to the curriculum, and he began keeping accurate school rolls which solidified his final legacy, increasing the size of Hopkins' student body. By the time Olmstead resigned due to poor health on July 28, 1849, school attendance had risen to 63 students. As soon as Olmstead left, the school began to deteriorate once again, with attendance dropping to 45 students in 1850 and to 20 by 1853. The recently founded debate society disbanded, with seven young members forming the secret society known as \\"The Club\\". Though this club grew no larger and tried to remain quiet, parents grew so annoyed with this supposedly \\"rough-housing\\" club that it was forced to disband in 1851. After the debate society and \\"The Club\\" were gone, many students sought out new ways to express their literary interests, including founding the school newspaper, The Critic. Olmstead was seen by the trustees as a major failure and a cause of the school's rapid decline, and was quickly replaced by James Whiton, who had just recently graduated from Yale. He further revised the curriculum by adding more English classes, and school attendance saw a rapid increase once again. Whiton taught for ten years and under his leadership, enrollment climbed to more than 100 students, thus marking the end of \\"the fallow years.\\" Modern day Headmaster George Lovell convinced the Board of Trustees to buy land on the western edge of New Haven for a new campus atop a hill in 1925.Barbara Riley Presents the 2004 Hopkins Medal to John C. Malone '59 on Hopkins School website on November 21, 2004, by Barbara Riley. Retrieved March 30, 2006. Graduate Henry Murphy laid out plans for the new campus in 1922, and designed the original Baldwin Hall building in 1925.\\"From Hopkins' Baldwin Hall to China's Memorial Hall\\" for Views on the Hill Spring/Summer '06 by Thom Peters. The school opened at the new premises, the present campus, in 1926. Baldwin Hall was initially the only building, but the campus expanded greatly over the next century. Hopkins had begun to refer to itself without \\"Grammar School\\" in the casual name by 1935, but \\"Grammar School\\" was not officially dropped until several years after Hopkins' merger with Day Prospect Hill School in 1972. Day Prospect Hill School was itself the product of a merger between two local women's schools -- the Day School (founded in 1907) and the Prospect Hill School (founded in 1930). The combined institution became the Day Prospect Hill School (DPH), a united women's education school. Trustee president Vince Calarco and headmaster Tim Rodd led Hopkins to buy a further of land at its current location to establish playing fields in 1992. In recent years alumnus John C. Malone, a wealthy telecommunications entrepreneur, has donated more than $25 million for new construction, the financial aid program, and forming the endowment.John C. Malone '59 for the Hopkins School website on November 22, 2004. Retrieved March 30, 2006. On March 24, 2020, it was announced that Hopkins School and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford agreed to settle a sexual abuse lawsuit involving a Catholic priest who was regularly allowed to teach at the school and who was accused of sexually abusing boys while teaching at the school between at least 1990 and 1991.https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Archdiocese-New-Haven-private- school-settle-sex-15154929.php Both Hopkins and the Archdiocese of Hartford were accused of covering up the sex abuse and shielding the priest from potential prosecution. The combined settlement totaled $7.48 million. The accused priest, Glenn Goncalo, committed suicide in 1991 as arrangements were being made for him to turn himself over to the police. It was also reported that reports of sexual abuse at Hopkins dated as far back as 1970. Admission Admission to Hopkins School occurs in bulk in two years: seventh and ninth grade. Approximately half of the students in each graduating class are accepted in seventh, and the rest in ninth. However, there are a minority of students that have been accepted in the eighth, tenth, and eleventh grades. There are approximately 140 students in each high school class, and 70 in each junior school class. Students applying to Hopkins are required to take either the Secondary School Admissions Test (SSAT) or the Independent School Entrance Examination (ISEE). Students who score in the 75th percentile or higher in each category of the tests are considered competitive for admissions, though most accepted students score above that mark. In addition, each student is required to conduct a personal interview with a member of the school's admissions committee. Students who are in need of financial aid must, in essence, apply twice: once for admissions, and once for aid. After they are accepted, students will either be given financial aid or not. If the school is unable to provide the necessary amount of financial aid, they will put the student on the waiting list in case a spot opens up. This is very unlikely, especially for students in need of large amounts of assistance, usually amounting in one student in this situation being accepted every few years. Facilities A map of the campus as of 2006, with Forest Road horizontally along the bottom of the map Baldwin Hall is the original building of the present campus. It has four floors, including the basement. It houses a computer lab, the language lab, and the Calarco Library. The library is a two floor, space with group study rooms, an art gallery, and a faculty reading room. Hopkins House houses the Admission Office, Business Office, College Counselling Office, and the Technology Department. This building was named for Edward Hopkins, Hopkins' first benefactor. It was finished in 1927 with the original intention of having it become a dormitory for boarding students. The program was abandoned in the 1930s due to insufficient enrollment. The Kneisel Squash Center was originally built as an all-purpose gym in 1935 and named the Reigeluth Gym in honor of a trustee. It was designed by the architect Douglas Orr. It now houses six squash courts. Lovell Hall houses the main school auditorium (Townshend Auditorium), drama and video production classrooms, two multipurpose classrooms, the Razor 's office, and teachers' offices. This building is named after longtime headmaster George Lovell, who led the school in the first half of the 20th century. It was constructed in 1960 with funds raised during the school's tercentenary. The Walter Camp Athletic Center is named after alumnus Walter Camp, who is credited with inventing American football and later was Yale's football coach. The Athletic Center was opened in 1986 and has two floors of gyms (three basketball courts on the first floor, and weight-lifting rooms on the second), a pool, a trainers' office, and coaches' office. The first floor is largely made up of three standard- sized basketball courts and the Bud Erich Pool. The second floor includes smaller weight rooms and training areas, including the wrestling room. Malone Science Center is at the center of campus and houses the science classrooms and labs. Donated by John C. Malone, it is named for Malone's father, Daniel Malone. It was opened for students in 1999 and has three floors of classrooms and labs. Heath Commons is a two-story building that houses the school dining hall and a student lounge. Heath Commons was designed by the S/L/A/M collaborative.S/L/A/M Homepage authored by the S/L/A/M Collaborative. Retrieved March 19, 2006. It was completed in 2003 and won a Connecticut Design Award in 2005.2005 Connecticut Design Award candidates for AIACT, 2005. Retrieved March 19, 2006. Heath also houses the kitchens, a cafe, the Weissman meeting room, and advisers' offices. Thompson Hall was opened on 30 November 2009 on the former site of one of the upper playing fields. The three-story building has two floors of classrooms, as well as large studio art studios, pottery, photography, wood shop, and choral and orchestral spaces. New fields opened in 2007 on the land purchased under Rodd's tenure which replaced those that Thompson Hall now stands on. An artificial turf field was installed in 2015 and named \\"Parr Field\\" in honor of the long-serving football coach, Tom Parr, who retired that year. In September 2019, under Kai Bynum, Hopkins opened a new softball field and track. Dr. Bynum said that the new playing areas are \\"valuable for community wellness\\", for Hopkins had lacked a track since its founding. Academics The 1911 school body. Headmaster Charles H. Weller is first on the left in the third row and George Lovell is 7th from the left in the top row (he would go on to be headmaster from 1916-1953). Applicants to Hopkins undergo a series of standardized tests, and upon matriculation, testing is done to place students at the appropriate level of instruction in mathematics and languages. Hopkins' academics are broken into departments including English, mathematics, science, history, arts, modern language, classics, and computer science. Each of the three class levels -- Lower, Middle, and Upper -- has a different level of choice in classes.Hopkins Course Guide, published annually by Hopkins School. The Arts Department is made up of student organizations and academic classes in studio and performance art. A number of student groups feature performing arts: a cappella groups such as the Harmonaires, Triple Trio, and Spirens; theater groups such as the Hopkins Drama Association; and a variety of choral and instrumental performance groups. The Keator Gallery in Baldwin Hall holds shows of student and teacher art, as well as local artists. The English department is the only department in which Hopkins requires a student have at least one class in every semester. Upper-class students have two required semester classes: a college-prep writing course and a Shakespeare-centered course. The history department core is the Atlantic Communities series that focus on Europe, the Americas, and West Africa between 1450 and modern times. In addition, elective courses go into detail on subjects such as political science, regional studies, philosophy and ethics. Advanced Placement courses are offered in United States History, European History, and Human Geography. The language department is divided into two subdepartments: the Classics, which teaches Ancient Greek and Latin; and Modern Languages, which teaches all other languages (French, Spanish, Chinese, and Italian are currently offered). The mathematics department offers study from pre-algebra to Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, Differential Equations and Chaos Theory. The science department has three main tracks -- Biology, Chemistry, and Physics -- along which students can take entry-level courses and then more advanced AP and Honors courses. There are numerous one-off courses in subjects such as Introduction to Psychology, Human Reproduction, or Environmental Studies. The computer science department offers basic computing courses in HTML and Java. School ends every Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. on other days. This extra time on Wednesdays are generally used to schedule \\"away\\" sports meets, to allow for travel time. Hopkins adopted a modified block scheduling system in 2005, giving each class 55 minutes rather than 40 minutes. Each student has two weekly class schedules (\\"maroon week\\" and \\"grey week\\", named for the school's colors) which alternate throughout the school year. Graduation requirements Hopkins' one-room Latin grammar school history is still reflected in its graduation requirements. Every student is required to take an English course every semester, and Junior Schoolers are required to take Latin along with whichever other language they may take, if any. In addition to classical education, Hopkins requires three years of math courses and three years of a language, the completion of Atlantic Communities I, Atlantic Communities II, and either Atlantic Communities III (for a total of two and a half years of credit), AP US History, or AP European History (for a total of three years of credit), two years of science coursework, and one and a half credits in the Arts Department. However, this only makes up a fraction of a student's total graduation credit requirement, while the rest is fulfilled by elective and advanced courses in any of the various departments.  Standardized testing and matriculation  The average SAT scores for a Hopkins Student is 1470, and the average ACT score is 32. This can be compared to the National averages, which are 1050 and 20. Hopkins is also known for having the highest number of National Merit Scholarship Semi-Finalists out of all private and public Connecticut high schools for multiple years. In addition, many students from Hopkins attend Ivy League and other highly competitive schools. Almost 10% of each graduating class attends the nearby Ivy League School, Yale University. The school's Ivy/MIT/Stanford matriculation is approximately 25%. Extracurricular activities Hopkins Dining Hall, 1928 Junior school students select from their own separate lists of activities during advisor meetings, and their activities' sessions are separate from the general school. The main school activities program begins with the Activities Fair, usually held in early September, where every activity puts on a display and signs up members for that school year. These various clubs and organizations then meet each Wednesday during the last period of the day, which is set aside as an activities period as opposed to an academic one. In addition to traditional school organizations such as the student newspaper and yearbook, Hopkins focuses strongly on community service especially within the New Haven community itself. The student government runs school-wide events such as a fundraiser for the Connecticut Food Bank, but the bulk of Hopkins' community service happens through clubs. Hopkins' umbrella community service organization is called Maroon Key. The diversity clubs (including a racial equality club, a Gay-Straight Alliance, and a gender equality group) as well as specific service clubs such as Habitat for Humanity organize a variety of fundraisers and events throughout the year. While not a graduation requirement, community service is an essential aspect of Hopkins life. Hopkins hosts Pathfinder, a program that includes both academic enrichment for middle school students and teacher training for high school and college students. Pathfinder operates an after-school program during the school year and an intensive six-week academic summer program. Hopkins School opens all parts of the campus not being used by regular summer school programs to Pathfinder.Hopkins Breakthrough information on the Hopkins website, written by Michael Van Leesten in September 2010.

Student council 2004‚Äì05 student council president (right) handing over his office to the 2005‚Äì06 president (left)The student council is the student government of Hopkins. It is modeled after the United States government. Each middle and upper school class elects four representatives and a class president at the end of the previous year. 8th- graders elect two of their 9th-grade representatives and their president at the end of 8th grade, then the final two representatives once the generally large group of students has joined Hopkins in the 9th grade. In the 2004‚Äì05 school year, the junior class added their own section to the student council. Each class also elects representatives from individual advisor groups to comprise the class council, which deals with class activities and fundraisers. The highest position in the student council is student council president, a student elected at the end of their junior year to run the council during their senior year. The president organizes school-wide fundraisers, delivers a speech at most assemblies, and holds some ceremonial graduation duties. During each commencement ceremony, the president of the senior class is selected to give the salutatorian speech, while the valedictorian is a student who has received cum laude distinction and is voted by the class from among the other cum laude recipients. Athletics football team Hopkins' athletics function under a trimester system, with students taking an athletic for each of the fall, winter, and spring seasons. Students may choose to participate in a team sport if they make the team, an intramural sport, or an independent sport where the student participates in a school-approved athletic activity such as martial arts lessons. Seniors may also take one season off and not take any athletic for that season. Sports offered at Hopkins vary depending on the season and include cross country, soccer, water polo, crew, football, field hockey, volleyball, basketball, fencing, track (both outdoor and indoor), swimming/diving, wrestling, squash, golf, lacrosse, tennis, baseball, and softball. Hopkins is a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic CouncilHomepage of NEPSAC. Retrieved March 19, 2006. and the Fairchester Athletic Association. Hopkins competes with many other private and boarding schools throughout New England and the northeast.  Theatre  Hopkins has one building dedicated to theatre and connected studies called Lovell Hall. In Lovell, there is the Townshend auditorium where all Hopkins Drama Productions take place. Each year, a minimum of five productions occur, with there often being upwards of seven or eight in total. The theatre staff consists of only two directors. Everything else is run by students. Besides the regular theatre productions, students also have the option to audition for the Improv Group, Peaches.  Computer Science  Hopkins has established a computer science department to provide students with the technical resources to keep up with the advancing world. At the same time, students have become interested in this sector outside the classroom. Hop Codes, the Hopkins student run programming organization convenes weekly \\"to create an environment in which students can experience computer science and coding even if they aren't taking a computer science course or can't fit it in their schedules.\\" Notable alumni  Due to the age of the school, it is unclear as to what year some of its alumni graduated.

In the engagement, the four Japanese destroyers defeated an Allied force that outnumbered and outgunned them, sinking the Dutch destroyer and escorting two transports to safety. The battle demonstrated the Japanese Navy's considerable superiority over the Allies in night fighting which lasted until the Battle of Cape St. George. Background A battalion of the 48th Infantry Division of the Imperial Japanese Army landed on Bali on 18 February 1942. Dutch Admiral Karel Doorman's naval forces were scattered around Indonesia, but the invasion of Bali could not be ignored ‚Äì it would give the Japanese an airbase within range of the ABDA naval base at Surabaya ‚Äì so he sent in all available ships. The short notice gave no time to concentrate his ships; accordingly, several Allied forces were to attack the Japanese. Battle The first Allied vessels to engage were the submarines and . Both attacked the Japanese convoy on 18 February, but did no damage and were driven off by depth charges from Japanese destroyers. Later that day, 20 planes of the United States Army Air Forces attacked the convoy but succeeded only in damaging the transport Sagami Maru. The Japanese were aware that their invasion convoy was likely to be attacked again, so they retreated north as soon as possible. The cruiser and the destroyers , and were well away and took no part in the action. The last ships to leave were the two modes of transport, each escorted by two destroyers. Sasago Maru was escorted by and ; the heavily damaged Sagami Maru was escorted by and . The first Allied group‚Äîconsisting of the cruisers and and the destroyers , , and ‚Äîsighted the Japanese in Badung Strait at about 22:00 and opened fire at 22:25 on 19 February. No damage was done in this exchange of fire, and the two Dutch cruisers continued through the strait to the northeast, to give the destroyers a free hand to engage with torpedoes. Then Piet Hein, Pope and John D. Ford came into range. At 22:40, a Long Lance torpedo from Asashio hit Piet Hein, sinking the Dutch destroyer immediately. Asashio and Oshio then exchanged gunfire with Pope and John D. Ford, forcing the two American destroyers to retire to the southeast instead of following the cruisers to the northeast. In the darkness, Asashio and Oshio mistook each other for enemy ships and fired on each other for several minutes, without any damage. About three hours later, the second group of ABDA ships‚Äîthe cruiser and the destroyers , , , and ‚Äîreached Badung Strait. At 01:36, Stewart, Pillsbury and Parrott launched torpedoes but did no damage. Then Oshio and Asashio sortied again and there was another exchange of gunfire. Tromp was hit by eleven shells from Asashio, severely damaging her and hit both Japanese destroyers, killing four men on Asashio and seven on Oshio. Tromp later had to return to Australia for repairs. Arashio and Michishio had been ordered by Admiral Kubo to turn back, and at about 02:20 they joined the battle. Michishio was hit by shells from Pillsbury, John D. Edwards and Tromp, killing 13 of her crew and wounding 83. She lost speed and had to be towed after the battle. During these exchanges, Stewart was also damaged topside and one shell hit opened seams below the waterline aft and flooded the steering engine room. Both groups of ships turned away, and the engagement was over. Aftermath HNLMS Tromp in Sydney after undergoing repairs for damage sustained during the battle The third ABDA group‚Äîseven torpedo boats‚Äîarrived in Badung Strait at about 06:00 but did not encounter any Japanese ships. The battle was a significant victory for the Japanese. Lieutenant Commander Gor≈ç Yoshii of Asashio and Commander Kiyoshi Kikkawa of Oshio had shown great bravery and skill. They had driven off a much larger Allied force, sunk the destroyer Piet Hein, damaged the destroyer Stewart and severely damaged the cruiser Tromp. Meanwhile, the Japanese had sustained little damage themselves, and had protected their transport ships. Bali's garrison of 600 Indonesian militia offered no resistance to the Japanese, and its airfield was captured intact. The Japanese continued their conquest of the Dutch East Indies with the capture of Timor from 20‚Äì23 February. The ABDA forces engaged at Badung Strait were decisively defeated in the Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March 1942, in which the Dutch cruisers Java and De Ruyter were sunk and Admiral Doorman was killed. Tromp evaded this fate, for she was withdrawn to Australia to repair damage suffered at Badung Strait. The US destroyer Stewart was sufficiently damaged that she had to be placed in dry-dock for repairs in Soerabaia, where she was scuttled to avoid capture by the rapidly advancing Japanese. She was raised, repaired and put into Japanese service a year later as the patrol vessel P-102.

In 1958, as owner of the Dodgers, he brought major league baseball to the West Coast, moving the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles despite the Dodgers being the second most profitable team in baseball from 1946‚Äì1956, and coordinating the move of the New York Giants to San Francisco at a time when there were no teams west of Kansas City, Missouri. For this, he was long vilified by Brooklyn Dodgers fans. However, Pro-O'Malley parties describe him as a visionary for the same business action, and many authorities cite him as one of the most influential sportsmen of the 20th century. Other observers say that he was not a visionary, but instead a man who was in the right place at the right time, and regard him as the most powerful and influential owner in baseball after moving the team.Stout, p. 334. O'Malley was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for his contributions to and influence on the game of baseball in 2008. O'Malley's father, Edwin Joseph O'Malley, was politically connected. Walter, a University of Pennsylvania salutatorian, went on to obtain a Juris Doctor, and he used the combination of his family connections, his personal contacts, and both his educational and vocational skills to rise to prominence. First, he became an entrepreneur involved in public works contracting, and then he became an executive with the Dodgers. He progressed from being a team lawyer to being both the Dodgers' owner and president, and he eventually made the business decision to relocate the Dodgers franchise. Although he moved the franchise, O'Malley is known as a businessman whose major philosophy was stability through loyalty to and from his employees. O'Malley ceded the team presidency to his son, Peter, in 1970 but retained the titles of owner and chairman of the Dodgers until his death in 1979. During the 1975 season, the Dodgers' inability to negotiate a contract with Andy Messersmith led to the Seitz decision, which limited the baseball reserve clause and paved the way for modern free agency. He bequeathed the team to his children Peter O'Malley and Therese O'Malley Seidler upon his death in 1979.  Early years  Edwin O'Malley circa 1905 Walter O'Malley was the only child of Edwin Joseph O'Malley (1881‚Äì1953), who worked as a cotton goods salesman in the Bronx in 1903. Edwin O'Malley later became the Commissioner of Public Markets for New York City. Walter's mother was Alma Feltner (1882‚Äì1940). O'Malley grew up as a Bronx-born New York Giants fan. He frequently attended Giants games at the Polo Grounds with his uncle Clarence. O'Malley was a Boy Scout who rose to the rank of Star Scout. O'Malley's photo from the 1922 Culver yearbook O'Malley attended Jamaica High School in Queens from 1918 to 1920 and then the Culver Academy (the eventual high school alma mater of future New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner) in Indiana. He managed both the baseball and tennis teams, served on the executive staff of the student newspaper, was a member of the Hospital Visitation Committee as well as the debate team, Bible Discipline Committee and the YMCA. At Culver, his baseball career was ended with a baseball that hit him on the nose. Later, he attended the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and graduated in 1926 as the senior class Salutatorian.Klitzman, Zach, \\"Ruth, Koufax, Aaron ... O'Malley: Long-time Dodgers owner becomes first Penn alum to get Cooperstown invite\\", The Daily Pennsylvanian, January 17, 2008\\"A Pioneer Owner (and Spoon Man) in the Hall of Fame\\", University of Pennsylvania Alumni Profiles, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Sept/October 2008 At Penn, he was initiated into Theta Delta Chi, and he also served as president of the Phi Deuteron Charge. Upon his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Applied Science his father gave him a cabin cruiser that slept eight.Golenbock, p. 85. He was also Junior and Senior class president. O'Malley originally enrolled at Columbia University in New York City for law school, but after his family lost their money in the Wall Street Crash of 1929, he switched from Columbia Law School to night school at Fordham University. Edwin O'Malley's dry goods business was failing and Walter had to help run the business.Shapiro, p. 23. Personal On September 5, 1931, he married Katherine Elizabeth \\"Kay\\" Hanson (1907‚Äì79), whom he had dated since high school, at Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan.1931 New York City Marriage Index They had two children: Therese O'Malley Seidler (born in 1933) and Peter O'Malley (born in 1937). Kay had been diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 1927 before the engagement and had to have her larynx removed. She was unable to speak above a whisper the rest of her life. Edwin O'Malley encouraged Walter to break off his engagement, and after Walter refused his parents did not attend the wedding.Shapiro, p. 22. O'Malley was a smoker, who golfed occasionally, but more commonly gardened for recreation.Shapiro, p. 20. In 1944, he remodelled his parents' summer house in Amityville, New York and relocated his family there from Brooklyn. The house was next door to the house Kay had grown up and her parents lived next door. As a family man, he attended church regularly, attended Peter's football games at LaSalle Academy, chaperoned his daughter's dances. On summer weekends he took the family sailing on his boat, which was named Dodger.Shapiro, p. 21. Pre-baseball career After he completed his law degree in 1930 at Fordham Law, he worked as an assistant engineer for the New York City Subway. After earning his law degree he needed to obtain a clerkship, but it was during the depression and no one could afford to hire him. He allowed a struggling lawyer to use space in his office and paid for his own clerkship.Shapiro, p. 24. After working for the Subway, he worked for Thomas F. Riley, who owned the Riley Drilling Company, and they formed the partnership of Riley and O'Malley. With the help of Edwin O'Malley's political connections, Walter's company received contracts from the New York Telephone Company and the New York City Board of Education to perform geological surveys. Subsequently, Walter started the Walter F. O'Malley Engineering Company and published the Subcontractors Register with his uncle, Joseph O'Malley (1893‚Äì1985). Walter eventually concentrated on the field of law, starting with work on wills and deeds. By 1933, he was senior partner in a 20-man Midtown Manhattan law firm. He developed the business habits of smoking cigars and of answering questions only after taking two puffs. During the Great Depression, O'Malley represented bankrupt companies and enriched himself, while building his thriving law practice. He invested wisely in firms such as the Long Island Rail Road, Brooklyn Borough Gas Company, the New York Subways Advertising Company, a building materials firm, a beer firm and some hotels. His success begot both influence and attention. The Brooklyn Democratic Machine powers such as judge Henry Ughetta and Brooklyn Trust Company president George Vincent McLaughlin were among those who noticed the rising O'Malley. Dodgers The extent of O'Malley's role in helping Branch Rickey sign Jackie Robinson (pictured) is a matter of some dispute. McLaughlin had been New York City Police Commissioner in 1926, knew O'Malley's father, and had attended Philadelphia Athletics games with O'Malley when O'Malley was still at the University of Pennsylvania. McLaughlin hired O'Malley to administer mortgage foreclosures against failing businesses for the Trust Company. O'Malley earned McLaughlin's confidence by acting in numerous capacities including bodyguard, valet, chauffeur, adopted son, confidant and right-hand man. The trust company owned the estate of Charles Ebbets, who had died in 1925 and owned half of the Brooklyn Dodgers.Shapiro, p. 25. It was 1933 when Walter again met George V. McLaughlin, president of the Brooklyn Trust Company. O'Malley was chosen to protect the company's financial interests in the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1933. O'Malley also served as designated driver for the hard drinking McLaughlin.Marzano, pp. 86‚Äì87. It was through McLaughlin that Walter was brought into the financial arrangements for Ebbets Field in 1940. In 1942, when Larry MacPhail resigned as general manager to serve in the United States Army as a Lieutenant colonel, O'Malley was appointed the attorney for the Dodgers, and he obtained a minority ownership interest on November 1, 1944. He purchased 25% as did Branch Rickey and John L. Smith (president of Pfizer Chemical),Stout, p. 120. while the heirs of Stephen McKeever retained the final quarter.Golenbock, p. 84. In 1943, he replaced Wendell Willkie as chief legal counsel. Branch Rickey, who had built the St. Louis Cardinals into champions, replaced MacPhail, and O'Malley began to accumulate stock in the Dodgers. Rickey was a conservative teetotaler, while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became more involved in affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance.Golenbock, p. 203. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he made fun of Rickey at every chance.Golenbock, p. 105. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press.Marzano, pp. 123‚Äì124. It got to the point where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered.Golenbock, p. 249. As team lawyer, O'Malley had a role in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he had a role in assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise. Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing. Control When co-owner Smith died in July 1950, O'Malley convinced his widow to turn over control of the shares to the Brooklyn Trust Company, which O'Malley controlled as chief legal counsel. Rickey's contract as general manager was set to expire on October 28, 1950. Rickey's Dodgers stock was held on margin and he had fully levered life insurance policy. O'Malley lowballed Rickey with an offer of $346,000 (the purchase price). Rickey demanded $1 million ($ today).Golenbock, p. 250. O'Malley eventually pursued a complicated buyout of Rickey, who had received an outside offer from William Zeckendorf of $1 million for his interests. There were varying accounts about the sincerity of the offer because Zeckendorf and Pittsburgh Pirates owner John Galbreath were fraternity brothers, but there is a lot of evidence that he had a sincere interest in acquiring the team.Stout, p. 164-7. The outside offer triggered a clause in the partnership agreement whereby the asking price of a third party had to be matched if a current owner wanted to retain control and the third party would be compensated $50,000. The canceled $50,000 check would later include Rickey's signature showing that Zeckendorf turned over the $50,000 to Rickey.Golenbock, p. 251. O'Malley replaced Rickey with Buzzie Bavasi. O'Malley became the president and chief stockholder (owner) on October 26, 1950. O'Malley assumed the title of president from Rickey, who was a trailblazer in baseball both for instituting the farm system and for breaking the racial barrier with Jackie Robinson. According to pitcher Clem Labine and noted author Roger Kahn, the first thing O'Malley did when he took over was assign Bavasi to enamor himself to Dick Young of the Daily News so that O'Malley would not have to worry about ever getting bad press from the Daily News.Golenback, p. 302. After the ownership transfer, O'Malley's rivalry with Rickey became very public. O'Malley forbade the speaking of Rickey's name in Dodgers offices with transgressors being subjected to a fine. He abolished Rickey's title of General Manager so that no front office person could perpetuate Rickey's role. In addition, when Rickey assumed the title with the Pittsburgh Pirates, O'Malley arranged for the Dodgers to omit the Pirates from their spring training schedule. Nonetheless, after the transfer, the Dodgers remained successful under O'Malley: they won the National League pennants in 1952, 1953, 1955‚Äîthe year of their first World Series championship‚Äîand 1956. Under O'Malley, the Dodgers were the most overtly political post World War II franchise.Prince, p. 23. In 1951, Brooklyn native and United States Congressman Emanuel Celler's Judiciary Committee investigated whether the reserve clause was in violation of federal anti-trust laws. Celler represented half of Brooklyn in Congress and O'Malley used the local press such as the Brooklyn Eagle to pressure Celler into backing off of the issue.Prince, p. 62-63. During the 1951 season, the Dodgers engaged former West Point varsity baseball player and U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur to lure war veterans.Prince, p. 30. O'Malley attempted to entice him to take the post of Commissioner of Baseball.Prince, p. 31. After the 1956 season, O'Malley sold Ebbets Field to Marvin Kratter and agreed to lease the stadium for three years.Sullivan, p. 77. Robinson had been a Rickey protege, and O'Malley did not have the same respect for Robinson that Rickey did.Golenbock, p. 270. O'Malley referred to him as \\"Rickey's prima donna\\".Stout, p. 160. Robinson did not like O'Malley's choice for manager, Walter Alston. Robinson liked to argue with umpires, and Alston rarely did so. Robinson derided Alston in the press.Golenbock, p. 373. In 1955, Alston played Don Hoak at third base during the exhibition season. Robinson voiced his complaints to the press.Golenbock, p. 385. Robinson did not get along with Bavasi either, and the three seasons under Alston were uncomfortable for Robinson. Robinson announced his retirement in Look magazine after the 1956 season.Golenbock, p. 424. Ebbets Field (1913) The signing of Robinson brought the team international fame, making O'Malley an international baseball ambassador to celebrities such as Iraq's King Faisal II. In 1954, Dodgers scout Al Campanis signed Sandy Koufax in large part for two reasons, according to a memo to O'Malley that said \\"No. 1, he's a Brooklyn boy. No. 2, he's Jewish.\\" Bavasi noted that \\"there were many people of the Jewish faith in Brooklyn.\\" During the 1955 season, Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella had a medical billing controversy regarding neurosurgery services by Manhattan doctor Dr. Samuel Shenkman. Shenkman billed $9,500, an amount which Campanella forwarded to the Dodgers and the Dodgers refused to pay. O'Malley felt the doctor was overcharging: \\"It appears that [Dr. Shenkman] thought he was operating on Roy's bankroll...\\" The Dodgers had convinced Campanella to have the surgery after enduring a slump in 1954 following MVP seasons in 1951 and 1953. The surgery was intended to restore complete use of his hand.Prince, p. 64-65 Despite having won the National League pennants in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953, they lost to the New York Yankees in the World Series each time, which frustrated O'Malley and all Dodgers fans. In 1955, the team won the World Series for the first time in their history. However, attendance declined from a peak of 1.7 million in 1946 and 1947 to just over one million per year in the mid-1950s. With the advent of the affordable automobile and post-war prosperity, Brooklyn's formerly heterogeneous, middle-class fan base for the Dodgers began to splinter. pp. xv‚Äìxvi. A large white flight took place, and Ebbets Field's shabby condition and lack of parking spaces led to the loss of fans who relocated to Long Island. O'Malley tried to raise money and get the political backing to build a new ballpark elsewhere in Brooklyn. The one person whose backing he needed was Robert Moses, a powerful figure who influenced development in New York through the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. O'Malley envisioned a domed stadium near the Long Island Rail Road station on Brooklyn's west end, and even invited R. Buckminster Fuller to design the structure; Fuller, in conjunction with graduate students from Princeton University, constructed a model of the \\"Dodgers' Dome\\".\\"The Dodgers' Dome\\" from \\"Events and Discoveries\\", Sports Illustrated, October 31, 1955, pp13-14 Moses did not like O'Malley and derided O'Malley's pro-Brooklyn and pro-Irish sentiments in the press.Prince, p. 63 O'Malley wanted to build a new Brooklyn Dodgers stadium at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenue, but Moses wanted the Dodgers to move to Queens and play in Flushing Meadows Park (the location where the New York Mets play today). Although O'Malley lined up bipartisan political support including New York Governor W. Averell Harriman, Moses blocked the sale of the land necessary for the planned new Brooklyn stadium. O'Malley bought the Chicago Cubs minor league baseball team, the Los Angeles Angels, as well as their stadium, Wrigley Field, from Philip Wrigley in 1956 at the winter baseball meetings, and during spring training, Los Angeles Mayor Norris Poulson traveled to the Dodgers' training camp at Vero Beach, Florida in an attempt to lure the franchise.Sullivan, p. 95. O'Malley met with Moses at Moses' home after purchasing the Angels to discuss final offers from New York to no avail.Sullivan, p. 128. O'Malley noticed the great success of the Milwaukee Braves after their move from Boston in 1953. They had a 43,000-seat stadium, parking for 10,000 cars and an arrangement for no city or real estate taxes.Golenbock, p. 432. He also felt the limitations of the small landlocked Ebbets Field, which held less than 32,111 fans and accommodated only 700 parking spaces. Attendance between 1950 and 1957 was between 1,020,000 in 1954 and 1,280,000 in 1951. Ultimately, O'Malley decided to leave Brooklyn for Los Angeles in 1957. Robert Moses authority Robert Caro and other contemporaneous sports historians felt that Moses was more to blame for the Dodgers' leaving.Prince, p. 108.Prince, p. 145. The 1956 season had marked the end of the Jackie Robinson era in which the Dodgers won six pennants, lost two pennant series and finished as low as third only once in ten years, and the new era would begin in a new home. During the 1957 season, he negotiated a deal for the Dodgers to be viewed on an early pay TV network by the Skiatron Corporation subject to the approval of other teams and owners. The rest of baseball was not ready for the risks of such a venture and it did not pan out at the time.Sullivan, p. 36. Move to Los Angeles O'Malley is considered by baseball experts to be \\"perhaps the most influential owner of baseball's early expansion era.\\" Following the 1957 Major League Baseball season, he moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles, and New York's Dodgers fans felt betrayed. O'Malley was also influential in getting the rival New York Giants to move west to become the San Francisco Giants, thus preserving the two teams' longstanding rivalry. He needed another team to go with him, for had he moved out west alone, the St. Louis Cardinals‚Äî away‚Äî would have been the closest National League team. The joint move made West Coast road trips more economical for visiting teams. O'Malley invited San Francisco Mayor George Christopher to New York to meet with Giants owner Horace Stoneham. Stoneham was considering moving the Giants to Minnesota, but he was convinced to join O'Malley on the West Coast at the end of the 1957 campaign. Since the meetings occurred during the 1957 season and against the wishes of Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick, there was media gamesmanship. On April 15, 1958, the Dodgers and Giants ushered in West Coast baseball at Seals Stadium. When O'Malley moved the Dodgers from Brooklyn the story transcended the world of sport and he found himself on the cover of Time. The cover art for the issue was created by sports cartoonist Willard Mullin, long noted for his caricature of the \\"Brooklyn Bum\\" that personified the team. The dual moves broke the hearts of New York's National League fans but ultimately were successful for both franchises ‚Äì and for Major League Baseball as a whole. In fact, the move was an immediate success as well since the Dodgers set a major league single- game attendance record in their first home appearance with 78,672 fans. During the first year after the move, the Dodgers made $500,000 more profit than any other Major League Baseball team and paid off all of their debts.Marzano, p. 203. This did not assuage many Dodgers fans in New York; many years later, newspaper writers Pete Hamill and Jack Newfield each challenged the other to choose the three worst people of the 20th century. Independently, they produced identical lists: \\"Hitler, Stalin, O'Malley.\\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-writer-pete-hamill-dead- at-85-20200805-4wowyopsrnazznqbbj5ze25ibi-story.html In the years following the move of the New York clubs, Major League Baseball added two completely new teams in California, as well as two in Texas, two in Canada, two in Florida, one each in the Twin Cities, Denver, and Phoenix, and two teams at separate times in Seattle. In addition, the Athletics, who had already moved to Kansas City, moved to Oakland; Kansas City would get a new team the year after the A's moved to Oakland. The National League returned to New York with the introduction of the New York Mets four years after the Dodgers and Giants had departed for California. When he made the decision to relocate in October 1957 to Los Angeles, O'Malley did not have an established location for where the Dodgers would play in 1958. O'Malley worked out a deal with Los Angeles County and the state of California to rent the Los Angeles Coliseum for $200,000 per year for 1958 and 1959, plus 10% of the ticket revenue, and all concession profits for the first nine games of each season following an opening series with the San Francisco Giants. The Dodgers temporarily took up residence while they awaited the completion of 56,000-seat capacity Dodger Stadium, built for $23 million. The Dodgers were soon drawing more than two million fans a year. They remained successful on the field as well, winning the World Series in 1959, 1963, and 1965. The Los Angeles Angels also played in Dodger Stadium from 1962 to 1965. Controversy regarding land deal with city of Los Angeles Dodger Stadium (May 2007) The dealings with the city of Los Angeles after the Vero Beach meeting raised questions. The initial offer of and tax exemptions was determined to be illegal and improper. The minor league San Diego Padres owners led an opposition effort to stop the transfer of in Chavez Ravine via a referendum. O'Malley engaged in an extensive marketing and media campaign that helped the referendum pass, but there were extensive subsequent taxpayer lawsuits. The plaintiffs initially prevailed in some of these suits. Finally, during the middle of the 1959 season, the Los Angeles City Council was able to approve the final parcel for the stadium. One legendary negotiation with the city over concession revenue is that in O'Malley's move to the Coliseum he agreed to accept concession revenues from only half the team's games‚Äîthe home half.Golenbock, p. 442. The land was eventually transferred by the Los Angeles city government to O'Malley by an agreement which required O'Malley and the Dodgers to design, build, privately finance and maintain a 50,000-seat stadium; develop a youth recreation center on the land. O'Malley was to pay $500,000 initially, plus annual payments of $60,000 for 20 years; and pay $345,000 in property taxes starting in 1962, putting the land on the tax rolls. Also, the Dodgers would transfer team-owned Wrigley Field, then appraised at $2.2 million, to the city. The city exchanged \\"300 acres, more or less, in the Chavez Ravine area\\", while L.A. County Supervisors unanimously agreed to provide $2.74 million for access roads. In addition, the Dodgers also had to pay $450,000 for territorial rights to the Pacific Coast League, whose Los Angeles Angels and Hollywood Stars suspended play. Other controversies and management philosophy In the 1960s, O'Malley attempted to buy out the contract of Shigeo Nagashima of the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants from Matsutaro Shoriki. In 1960, O'Malley refused to pay right fielder Carl Furillo for the 1960 season after he was released early due to injury. This forced Furillo to sue the team. Because of this, O'Malley allegedly blacklisted Furillo from any job in baseball.Prince. p. 64. His son, Peter O'Malley, described his management style as follows: \\"As president, the way he ran the business, he believed in stability and very little turnover. It was the strength of the organization. The management team worked as well as the team on the field.\\" This is evidenced in many ways, including the long tenure of both Walter Alston and Tommy Lasorda as Dodgers managers and Vin Scully, the broadcast voice of the Dodgers. Alston was repeatedly rehired to consecutive one-year contracts from 1954‚Äì1976 until he retired. Then Lasorda, who had been a long-time employee in as a coach and minor league baseball manager, took over as manager for another 20 years. Scully was the voice of the Dodgers for 67 seasons until his retirement in 2016, the infield of first baseman Steve Garvey, second baseman Davey Lopes, shortstop Bill Russell and third baseman Ron Cey was the longest-running intact infield in major league history. Furthermore, O'Malley is said to have kept Bowie Kuhn in office as the Commissioner of Baseball until O'Malley's death. O'Malley rewarded loyal employee Bavasi by allowing the San Diego Padres franchise to establish an expansion team with Bavasi as President in Southern California. Alston said O'Malley convinced him that when he signed his first one-year contract it could be a lifetime job by pointing out that \\"signing one-year contracts can mean a lifetime job, if you keep signing enough of them.\\" Although O'Malley had good stories of loyalty with some employees, there were several stories of O'Malley's frugality.Golenbock, p. 437-8. Although O'Malley was loyal to his employees, he did not take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media.Golenbock, p. 370. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.Golenback, p. 366-7. O'Malley believed that employees should accept whatever salaries they were offered. In 1966, this led to the contract holdouts of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, who employed the same lawyer. The duo of pitching aces decided to strike together until they were both satisfied. They had earned $70,000 and $75,000 respectively during the 1965 season, during which the Dodgers won the World Series, and O'Malley offered $105,000 and $95,000 for the 1966 season. At the time, Willie Mays was Major League Baseball's highest paid player at $125,000 per year and multi-year contracts were very unusual. They demanded three-year $167,000 per year contracts and after holding out until less than two weeks before Opening Day, they received one-year $130,000 and $115,000 contracts respectively. O'Malley liked clubhouse turmoil only slightly less than free agent disloyalty. When he traded Maury Wills to the Pittsburgh Pirates following consecutive National League pennants, it was attributed to Wills having quit during the middle of the Dodgers' post-season tour of Japan. Retirement from presidency On March 17, 1970, Walter turned over the presidency of the team to his son Peter, remaining as Chairman until his death in 1979. Peter O'Malley held the position until 1998 when the team was sold to Rupert Murdoch. The team remained successful on the field under Peter and won the World Series in both 1981 and 1988. They remained successful at the box office as well: by the end of the 1980s, they had not only became the first franchise to draw three million fans, but also they had done it more times than all other franchises combined. During the 1970s, O'Malley was credited for stagemanaging Lasorda's career. Lasorda become known for his die-hard Dodgers clich√©s, such as describing the color of his blood by saying \\"Cut me, I bleed Dodger blue.\\" It was even said that the reciprocal loyalty and respect between Lasorda and O'Malley was so high that O'Malley gave Lasorda a tombstone as a gift that had an inscription that read \\"TOMMY LASORDA, A DODGER\\". The McKeevers held their 25% interest in the Dodgers until 1975 when Dearie McKeever died. They sold out to O'Malley making him the sole owner of the Dodgers.Marzano, p. 93. Also during 1975, the Dodgers franchise was embroiled in the Andy Messersmith controversy that led to the Seitz decision, which struck down baseball's reserve clause and opened up the sport to modern free agency. Messersmith and the Dodgers were unable to come to contract terms in part because of a then unheard of no-trade clause demand, and Messersmith pitched the entire season without a contract under the reserve clause, which stated that team has the right to extend the prior years contract one year if a player does not agree to terms. Teams had previously had the right to continue such re-signings year after year. This gave owners the right to issue \\"take it or leave it\\" offers to the players. Although the Dodgers and Messersmith nearly hammered out a deal monetarily, they could not come to terms on the no-trade clause. Supposedly Major League Baseball instructed the Dodgers not to surrender such a clause for the good of the game. The Seitz decision limited the re-signings to one year, and since Messersmith performed quite well in 1975, winning a Gold Glove Award and leading the National League in complete games and shutouts, while finishing second in earned run average, he was a valuable talent. He earned offers from six different teams. Messersmith became the first free agent, except for Catfish Hunter who had been declared a 1974 free agent by breach of contract. O'Malley felt the price wars would be the downfall of baseball because the fans only have so much money. The scenario led to an eighteen-day lockout during spring training in 1976 over the prospect of dozens of players playing becoming free agents and the inability to redesign the reserve clause. Death and legacy O'Malley was diagnosed with cancer, and he sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He died of congestive heart failure on August 9, 1979 at the Methodist Hospital in Rochester, and was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. His wife Kay had died a few weeks earlier. At one time, Brooklyn Dodgers fans hated O'Malley so much for moving their beloved team that he was routinely mentioned along with Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin as the most villainous 20th-century men; one version of a joke went, \\"If a Brooklyn man finds himself in a room with Hitler, Stalin, and O'Malley, but has only two bullets, what does he do? Shoot O'Malley twice.\\" Some still consider him among the worst three men of the 20th century. Much of the animosity was not just for moving the team, but robbing Brooklyn of the sense of a cohesive cultural and social identity that a major sports franchise provides. Despite the long-standing animosity of Brooklyn fans and their supporters in baseball, O'Malley was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008 after having been elected by the Veterans Committee with the minimum number of votes necessary for induction. His legacy is that of changing the mindset of a league that for a long time had had the St. Louis Cardinals as its southernmost and westernmost team (American League Kansas City Athletics had moved west 3 years earlier from Philadelphia). Tommy Lasorda said upon hearing of his election to the Hall, \\"He's a pioneer. He made a tremendous change in the game, opening up the West Coast to Major League Baseball.\\" When asked how he wanted to be remembered, O'Malley said, \\"for planting a tree.\\" The tree provided the branches to open up the West Coast to baseball, but O'Malley's son remembers his father's 28 years on Major League Baseball's executive council as service that \\"was instrumental in the early stages of the game's international growth.\\" His contributions to baseball were widely recognized even before his Hall of Fame election: he was ranked 8th and 11th respectively by ABC Sports and The Sporting News in their lists of the most influential sports figures of the 20th century. On July 7, 2009, Walter O'Malley was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame along with two other Dodger icons: slugger Steve Garvey and announcer Vin Scully. \\"Over the years, we have learned more of his decade-long quest to build a new stadium in Brooklyn and about how those efforts were thwarted by city officials. Perhaps this induction will inspire fans who themselves started new lives outside the borough to reconsider their thoughts about Walter O'Malley\\", said John Mooney, curator of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. \\"He privately built one of baseball's more beautiful ballparks, Dodger Stadium, and set attendance records annually. While New York is the home of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, it seeks to honor inductees whose impact was and is national.\\" O'Malley's detractors say that he was not a visionary for taking baseball west. They say the game was naturally heading toward geographical expansion and O'Malley just an opportunist. Rather than truly being a leader these detractors say his leadership was a manifestation of making the most money.Stout, p. 334-5. Popular culture O'Malley was mentioned several times in Danny Kaye's 1962 song tribute The D-O-D-G-E-R-S Song (Oh, Really? No, O'Malley!), which spins a tale of a fantasy game between the Dodgers and the Giants. At one point, the umpire's call goes against the home team: :Down in the dugout, Alston glowers :Up in the booth, Vin Scully frowns; :Out in the stands, O'Malley grins... :Attendance 50,000! :So ....what does O'Malley do? CHARGE!! Just before the St. Louis Cardinals began a series of games against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, in 1963, the Los Angeles Times published a large cartoon, drawn by artist Pete Bentovoja, modeled on the movies about the German submarine captain. The captain is Cards' manager Johnny Keane; his \\"lieutenant\\" is Stan Musial. They wear Cardinal uniforms with naval officers' caps bearing the \\"St.L\\" emblem. While Keane and Musial are speaking, other crew members load bats, like torpedoes, into torpedo tubes; the bats have players' faces (and names and batting averages) drawn on them. Keane looks through the periscope and sees a battleship with a large head of O'Malley, wearing a naval officers cap bearing the \\"LA\\" emblem and puffing a cigar. Keane: \\"Achtung Shtan [Stan]! I zought ve sunk sem last year?\\" Musial: \\"Yavohl, Mein Kommander, Ve vill blast zem vit bigger und better torpedoes zis zeazon!\\" (The Cards made a terrific drive for the pennant but finished the season six games back of the Dodgers.) O'Malley was featured prominently in the HBO documentary film Brooklyn Dodgers: Ghosts of Flatbush, which chronicled his executive management of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. The documentary focuses on the post World War II glory years of the franchise and presents a compelling case that O'Malley truly wanted to keep the Dodgers in Brooklyn in a stadium near a railroad station, but he was unable to get the proper support from Moses.

It was incorporated in 1939 by three Schweizer brothers (Paul, William, and Ernest), who built their first glider in 1930. Previously the oldest privately owned aircraft company in the United States, Schweizer was acquired by Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation of Stratford, Connecticut in 2004, and became a diversified aerospace company. Schweizer Aircraft ceased operations in 2012. it was sold to Schweizer R.S.G. in 2018 and production lines were opened again. The company produces three models in 2020. History Schweizer SGS 2-33A training glider The company grew out of the Mercury Glider Club which produced the first two Schweizer gliders in the Schweizers' barn. The company was originally called the Schweizer Metal Aircraft Company. Attorney Bob McDowell indicated to the Schweizers that they should move their manufacturing operation out of their father's barn and relocate to the Elmira, New York area. The Schweizers received the suggestion positively as they needed more space to produce gliders, but they had no money with which to make the move.Schweizer, Paul A: Wings Like Eagles, The Story of Soaring in the United States, p. 69. Smithsonian Institution Press, 1988. . McDowell convinced Elmira Industries Inc, the local business development corporation, to provide space for the Schweizers on the second floor of the Elmira Knitting Mill Building in return for stock in the company. This resulted in the Schweizer Metal Aircraft Company becoming the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation, with a sale of shares to Elmira Industries, local businessmen and soaring pilots. Helicopters Schweizer S269C Schweizer primarily produced light, piston- engined helicopters for use in utility and flight-training roles. The Schweizer 300CBi, originally designed and manufactured by Hughes aircraft as the Hughes 269 for the United States Army, is one of the most widely used training helicopters in the world. In 1986, Schweizer acquired all rights to the helicopter from McDonnell Douglas, who had purchased Hughes Helicopters in 1984. After Schweizer acquired the FAA Type Certificate, the helicopter was known for a short time as the Schweizer-Hughes 300C and then simply, the Schweizer 300C. The basic design remained unchanged over the years. Between Hughes and Schweizer, nearly 3,000 copies of the Model 269/300 have been built and flown over the last 50 years. Schweizer continued to develop the Model 300 by adding a turbine and redesigning the body to create the Schweizer 330, and then further developments led to the development of the Schweizer 333. An improved version in the series, the Sikorsky S-434, was released in 2008. In 2011 and 2012 Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation laid off all the workers and closed the plant. Sailplanes Schweizer SGS 1-26B Schweizer is known for its popular line of gliders (sailplanes), the earliest of which (the model SGP 1-1) was produced in 1930. Although very few of the early gliders were built, later models gained popularity, such as the SGS 2-8 and 2-12, which were adopted by the U.S. Army Air Corps for training as the TG-2 and TG-3, respectively. Schweizer SGS 1-23D sailplane. The 1-23 was first flown in 1948 The Schweizer SGS 1-23 was a world class competition and record setting glider between its first flight in 1948 and the end of its production in 1967.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, pages 28-30. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 In the 1950s and '60s the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation designed and manufactured the very popular SGS 1-26 and SGS 2-33 gliders. They are easy to fly, with simple construction, and are quite rugged and forgiving. A powered light aircraft, the Schweizer SA 1-30 was tested, but did not go into production. The 2-33 was adopted by the United States Air Force Academy as the TG-4, for use in introductory airmanship training. The Academy used over a dozen such gliders until 2002 when they were replaced by more modern sailplanes. The Royal Canadian Air Cadets continue to operate a fleet of over seventy 2-33As. Other popular Schweizer gliders include the single-seat SGS 1-26 and the two or three-seat 2-32, both of which can be found in many soaring clubs and in private ownership across the U.S. Ag Cat Schweizer Ag Cat Schweizer produced the Grumman G-164 Ag Cat, a single-engine biplane agricultural aircraft originally developed by Grumman in the 1950s. Under the contract with Grumman the airplane was built almost continuously between 1957 and 1981.Wood, Derek: Jane's World Aircraft recognition Handbook, page 460. Jane's Publishing, 1983. During this period of time Schweizer built 2,455 of the airplanes. In 1981 Schweizer bought the rights to the design and continued production under the name Schweizer Ag Cat. In 1995 Schweizer sold the rights to the Ag Cat to Ag- Cat Corp. of Malden, Texas. In February 2001 the design was sold to Allied Ag- Cat Productions Inc. of Walnut Ridge, Arkansas. Allied Ag-Cat is not producing new aircraft although a related company operates a large fleet of Ag-Cats. The basic airframe incorporates many safety innovations, including a pressurized cockpit to keep pesticides out, air conditioning and a fuselage structure that is designed to progressively collapse in the event of a collision. Teal amphibian In 1972 Schweizer hired David Thurston and production of his Thurston Teal was part of the agreement to work at Schweizer. The company produced three Schweizer TSC-1A1 Teals and nine TSC-1A2 Teal IIs before production was moved to Teal Aircraft in 1976.Wood, Derek: Jane's World Aircraft Recognition Handbook, page 455. Jane's Publishing Company, 1985. Reconnaissance aircraft The development of the Schweizer SGM 2-37 two- place motor glider for the United States Air Force Academy in 1982 led to a new area of expertise for the company. In the mid-1960s Lockheed had used the Schweizer SGS 2-32 sailplane as the basis for its YO-3 quiet reconnaissance aircraft. Schweizer decided to develop the SGM 2-37 into a similar concept aircraft as the YO-3. The result was the SA 2-37A and B, known as the RG-8A in military use.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 131. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 The RG-8A was later developed by the company into the twin piston-engined and twin-boom SA 2-38 Condor with the US military designation of RU-38A Twin Condor. This design was further refined into the turboprop-powered RU-38B Twin Condor. The RU-38 was still in production in 2008. It is believed the US Drug Enforcement Administration purchased aircraft designated Shadowhawk from Schweizer. The aircraft had a poor operational history.Why secretly funded DEA surveillance planes aren't flying They may be designated SA 38B. Other projects In partnership with Northrop Grumman (formerly Ryan Aeronautical), Schweizer developed the MQ-8 Fire Scout helicopter UAV. Schweizer participated in development of Sikorsky's X-2 Demonstrator, a prototype aircraft using co- axial rotor blades with a pusher propeller for extra forward thrust. United Technology Corporation (UTC), then parent company of Sikorsky, shut down Schweizer in December 2012. Products Helicopter products offered by the company in February 2009 included the 300C, 300CBi, and 333.

M. W. Silver. The entrance to My≈çan-ji temple in Kyoto. My≈çan-ji, a subsidiary of T≈çfuku-ji, was the head temple of the Fuke sect, founded by the komus≈ç Kyochiku Zenji. or Fuke Zen was a distinct and ephemeral derivative school of Japanese Zen Buddhism which originated as an offshoot of the Rinzai school during the nation's feudal era, lasting from the 13th century until the late 19th century. The sect, or sub- sect, traced its philosophical roots to the eccentric Zen master Puhua, as well as similarities and correspondences with the early Linji House and previous Ch√°n traditions‚Äîparticularly Huineng's \\"Sudden Enlightenment\\" (Southern Ch√°n)‚Äîin Tang Dynasty China. Fuke monks or priests (komus≈ç) were noted for playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute as a form of meditation known as suizen (\\"blowing meditation\\"), an innovation from the earlier zazen (\\"sitting meditation\\") of other Zen sects. Fuke Zen was characterized in the public imagination of Japan by its monks' playing of the shakuhachi flute while wearing a large woven basket hat that covered their entire head as they went on pilgrimage. The theoretical basis of Fuke-sh≈´ was to emphasise the concept of the incommunicable aspect of enlightenment, an ideal traced to various Buddhist sects and relayed in paradoxical Zen writings such as the Lankavatara Sutra, the Diamond Sutra and Bodhidharma's \\"Bloodstream sermon\\". Thus Fuke monks rarely chanted sutras or other Buddhist texts, but rather relied upon scores of sacred shakuhachi music called honkyoku to express and transmit awakening. The sect technically continues to exist (albeit in a less organized form) through the lineage of the contemporary Kyochiku Zenji Hosan Kai (KZHK) group in Kyoto‚Äîwhich organizes annual meetings for hundreds of shakuhachi players, Rinzai clerics, and Fuke Zen enthusiasts‚Äîand the related My≈çan Society, as well as other small groups throughout Japan. KZHK and the My≈çan Society operate from their base temples of T≈çfuku-ji and My≈çan-ji, the latter being the former headquarters of the Fuke sect. Many Rinzai monks still practice as komus≈ç during certain celebrations in former Fuke-sh≈´ temples that have, since the 19th century, reverted to traditional Rinzai Zen. Notable temples include Kokutai-ji and Ichigatsu-ji. At least several particular individuals in modern times have been known to pursue temporary itinerant lifestyles as komus≈ç, for spiritual or learning purposes. H√µzan Murata, a famous shakuhachi player, maker, and dai-shihan (grandmaster), lived as a komus≈ç for 8 months in 1974. Perhaps the most well known contemporary komus≈ç are Kok≈´ Nishimura‚Äîwho famously carried on the tradition of dubbing shakuhachi kyotaku (\\"empty bell\\"), in reference to the legend of Puhua (Fuke)‚Äîand Watazumi Doso, known for his innovations with and revitalization of the shakuhachi repertoire, and the popularization of the hotchiku. The Founder Puhua Fuke-sh≈´, according to some accounts, is derived from the teachings of the Chinese Zen teacher Linji Yixuan (c. 800‚Äì866), known in Japan as Rinzai Gigen. However, the Fuke school counted as its founder one of Linji's contemporaries P«îhu√† (ÊôÆÂåñ), whose name is read as Fuke in Japanese. Puhua was reputedly a multi-talented monk, known for being inventive and at the same time quite strict. The notion of Puhua as founder is also supported by several references in the Record of Linji, as well as the Kyotaku Denki. (Although the latter was later confirmed as a fabrication used to further the komus≈çs' benefits under the Tokugawa shogunate.) One story of Puhua particularly demonstrates his unique style of nonverbal Ch√°n:Ferguson, page 100. > When Panshan Baoji was near death, he said to the monks, \\"Is there anyone > among you who can draw my likeness?\\" Many of the monks made drawings for > Panshan, but none were to his liking. The monk Puhua stepped forward and > said, \\"I can draw it.\\" Panshan said, \\"Why don't you show it to me?\\" Puhua > then turned a somersault and went out. Panshan said, \\"Someday, that fellow > will teach others in a crazy manner!\\" Having said these words, Panshan > passed away. Many stories about Puhua that appear in the Record of Linji add to his reputation of having a rough and uncompromising manner of expressing the dharma. For example:Schloegl, pp. 66‚Äì67 > 44.a. One day the master (Linji Yixuan) and Puhua went to a vegetarian > banquet given them by a believer. During it, the master asked Puhua: \\"'A > hair swallows the vast ocean, a mustard seed contains Mt. Sumeru' ‚Äì does > this happen by means of supernatural powers, or is the whole body > (substance, essence) like this?\\" Puhua kicked over the table. The master > said: \\"Rough fellow.\\" Puhua retorted: \\"What place is this here to speak of > rough and refined ?\\" b. The next day, they went again to a vegetarian > banquet. During it, the master asked: \\"Today's fare, how does it compare > with yesterday's?\\" Puhua (as before) kicked over the table. The master said: > \\"Understand it you do ‚Äì but still, you are a rough fellow.\\" Puhua replied: > \\"Blind fellow, does one preach of any roughness or finesse in the Buddha- > Dharma?\\" The master stuck out his tongue. There is some controversy as to the degree and nature of his musical talents, but his followers would often reflect on a certain story for inspiration: the story describes Puhua going through his hometown, ringing a bell to summon others to enlightenment. The same, for many Fuke practitioners, applied to the shakuhachi, and its mastery was seen as a path to enlightenment. Death of Puhua The death of Puhua is recounted in the Record of Linji. In addition to giving a special importance to Puhua's ringing bell, it is particularly striking as a story of Buddhist resurrection that equals the famous resurrection story of Bodhidharma, the Indian master who brought the Ekayana school from India to China, which became the Chan sect of Buddhism. The story:Schloegl, page76. > 65\\\\. One day at the street market Fuke was begging all and sundry to give > him a robe. Everybody offered him one, but he did not want any of them. The > master Linji made the superior buy a coffin, and when Fuke returned, said to > him: \\"There, I had this robe made for you.\\" Fuke shouldered the coffin, and > went back to the street market, calling loudly: \\"Rinzai had this robe made > for me!

Tomorrow, I shall go to the South Gate to enter transformation.\\" And > so for three days. Nobody believed it any longer.

The news spread at once, and the people of the market rushed there. On > opening the coffin, they found that the body had vanished, but from high up > in the sky they heard the ring of his hand bell. Fuke lineage in Japan Fuke Zen was brought to Japan by Shinchi Kakushin (ÂøÉÂú∞Ë¶∫ÂøÉ)(1207‚Äì1298), also known as Muhon Kakushin (ÁÑ°Êú¨Ë¶∫ÂøÉ) and posthumously as Hotto Kokushi (Ê≥ïÁáàÂúãÂ∏´). Kakushin had travelled to China for six years and studied with the famous Chinese Chan master Wumen (ÁÑ°ÈñÄ) of the Linji lineage. Kakushin became a disciple of Ch√¥san, a 17th generation teacher of the Fuke sect of China.Fuke Shakuhachi Official Site Although it no longer exists as a religious organization, during the feudal period, Fuke Zen's following was quite extensive. Its members could be easily recognized by their practice of playing the shakuhachi flute, which was considered a form of meditation, termed suizen (ÂêπÁ¶™). These musician-monks were known at first as komos≈ç (Ëñ¶ÂÉß; literally \\"straw-mat monks\\") and, by the mid-17th century, as komus≈ç (ËôöÁÑ°ÂÉß; literally \\"emptiness monk\\"). Fuke Zen in general stressed pilgrimage, and its adherents were mostly lay-practitioners rather than clergymen. During the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867), many r≈çnin became incorporated into the sect, and due to the temperaments of these former samurai, the sect gained the reputation of harbouring troublemakers. Members of the Fuke sect were also given permission by the Bakufu government of the time to travel freely throughout the country, a significant dispensation considering the severe travel restrictions of the time. In reality, some of the Fuke monks were spies for the Bakufu government, a practice which helped seal the sect's demise when the government itself fell. Development and demise Fuke, which had initially been a loose affiliation of monks and lay pilgrims, solidified as a sect around 1700. However, the sect died out in 1871 following the Meiji Restoration. The new government promulgated a grand council proclamation banning the practice of Fuke Zen and playing the shakuhachi for religious reasons. This is because, as described above, in practice many of the Fuke were spies and informers for the government. Practice of the shakuhachi was banned entirely for four years by the Meiji government, after which it was decreed that secular playing was permitted. From that time onward the playing of original Fuke pieces, honkyoku, made a very slow recovery. The recovery is continuing to this day.

It was produced by Rodger Bain, who had made a name for himself as the producer of Black Sabbath's first three albums. It is the only album to feature drummer John Hinch. Background According to the band, the album was entirely played live, in studio (i.e. all musicians playing simultaneously as in a concert, vs. the more popular method of each musician's parts being recorded separately and then mixing them).Post on the official Judas Priest Facebook page. 2 December 2011. Retrieved 14 December 2011. According to the band there were technical problems in the studio, resulting in poor sound quality and a hiss through the album. Guitarist Glenn Tipton had just joined when recording of Rocka Rolla began and did not contribute any songwriting except on the title track and \\"Run of the Mill\\". He did come up with the songs \\"Tyrant\\", \\"Epitaph\\", and \\"Ripper\\", but Bain considered them not commercial enough and rejected them. Bain also rejected the concert staple \\"Whiskey Woman\\" which later, with contributions from Tipton, morphed into \\"Victim of Changes\\". These songs were eventually all included on their next album, Sad Wings of Destiny. In addition, \\"Winter\\", \\"Deep Freeze\\" and \\"Winter Retreat\\" form a suite, but are listed as separate tracks and divided as such on the CD release. \\"Dying to Meet You\\" contains a clear break before an unlisted song (often known as \\"Hero Hero\\") begins. It may be possible that the record company insisted on there being ten tracks on the album and would not allow for one more. Alternatively, this unlisted song may simply be the second half of \\"Dying to Meet You\\", as this is how the lyrics were printed on their 1978 Best of... compilation. Several of the songs on the album feature contributions from the band's previous frontman Al Atkins and had been regular parts of their live performances in Manchester, where the band had achieved a cult following during the previous few years. The track \\"Caviar and Meths\\" was originally a 14-minute effort penned by Atkins, Downing, and Hill but due to time constraints, only the intro was recorded for the album. A longer version of the song appears on Atkins's 1998 album Victim of Changes. Though not the full-length version, it is notably longer at seven minutes. That album also contains covers of \\"Winter\\" and \\"Never Satisfied\\". At this point of the band's career, they had not yet developed their signature look of leather and studs. They had appeared on a British television programme called The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1975, performing \\"Rocka Rolla\\" and \\"Dreamer Deceiver\\", and their wardrobe was very \\"hippified\\" as journalist Malcolm Dome put it. This footage was included on the Electric Eye DVD. In addition, the album is more blues/hard rock oriented than their later releases, and also has some slight progressive rock influences that would continue through to Stained Class, but to a lesser extent, and would be abandoned in later releases. This makes the album's style virtually unrecognizable when compared with later Priest albums, although \\"Rocka Rolla\\" does feature dual guitars and \\"Run of the Mill\\" is the first song that was explicitly designed for Halford's, rather than Atkins', vocal range. Drummer John Hinch would be dismissed in 1975 before the next record was recorded. Tipton would later refer to him as being \\"musically inadequate\\" for the band's future plans. Rob Halford made a brief explanation before performing \\"Never Satisfied\\" during the Epitaph Tour, as there were \\"a few blank stares\\" from the audience while performing the song.Hartmann, Graham \\"Gruhamed\\". JUDAS PRIEST‚ÄôS ROB HALFORD AND IAN HILL TALK ‚ÄòCHOSEN FEW,‚Äô UPCOMING ALBUM + MORE . 24 October 2011. Retrieved 14 December 2011. The album was reissued several times over the years and in 1984 it was reissued with a different cover. The original \\"bottle cap\\" album cover art was initially intended by designer John Pasche for use with an unspecified Rolling Stones album. The band had filed a lawsuit with the Coca-Cola company. The re-issue cover art (by artist Melvyn Grant, and originally used as the cover for the novel The Steel Tsar) was also used for the US cover of Ballistix for the TurboGrafx-16 and Commodore Amiga. Most of the songs from Rocka Rolla have not been performed by Judas Priest live since the mid-late 1970s, although Halford's solo band performed \\"Never Satisfied\\" during live shows in 2003, and the same song was part of the setlist of the Epitaph World Tour. The tour for Rocka Rolla was Judas Priest's first international tour with dates in Germany, Holland, Norway and Denmark including one show at Hotel Klubben in T√∏nsberg, one hour from Oslo, Norway which scored them a somewhat negative review in the local press. Reception The album was released to very little reception selling \\"only a few thousand copies\\". Because it flopped, the band found themselves in dire financial straits. In particular, they talked of nights in which they were starving and didn't know when they were going to get their next meal. They tried to enter into an agreement with Gull Records to pay them 50 pounds a week, but Gull, which was also suffering economic woes, refused. In a retrospective review, AllMusic gave Rocka Rolla a rating of 2.5 out of five stars, and said that while it was a \\"sketchy and underfocused debut\\", the album \\"definitely hints at Judas Priest's potential and originality\\".  Track listing  The original UK LP has a longer version of \\"Rocka Rolla\\" than the version used for the US LP release, and most CD releases. It has an extra verse and chorus at the beginning of the song. The very rare first printing of the UK LP has the words \\"Thanks for the words Al!\\" printed last in the credits in the blue circle on the back cover. This, presumably a reference to original singer Al Atkins, has been removed on other versions of the Gull vinyl. On some versions of the CD release, \\"Rocka Rolla\\" is timed at 4:00 and \\"Winter\\" at 0:45, becoming a mashup but remaining on separate tracks. Some releases, e.g. Hero, Hero also combine \\"Winter\\", \\"Deep Freeze\\" and \\"Winter Retreat\\" into one track. The iTunes version combines those three plus \\"Cheater\\" into one track. The version of \\"Diamonds & Rust\\" that appears on the re-release is actually from the Sad Wings of Destiny sessions and not the version that appears on Sin After Sin. It was probably included to provide interest in Rocka Rolla, an album that would have been unknown to many of the band's fans due to the band not playing songs from it live after the 1970s. Rocka Rolla features Judas Priest's longest track, \\"Run of the Mill\\", prior to \\"Cathedral Spires\\" from Jugulator in 1997. It is also the longest track co-written by Halford, Downing and Tipton prior to \\"Lochness\\" from Angel of Retribution in 2005. Personnel ;Judas Priest *Ian Hill ‚Äì bass *K. K.

Before becoming first abbot of the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center, Katagiri had worked at the Zenshuji Soto Zen Mission in Los Angeles and had also been of great service to Shunryu Suzuki at the San Francisco Zen Center, particularly from 1969 until Suzuki's death in 1971. Katagiri was important in helping bring Zen Buddhism from Japan to the United States during its formative years‚Äîespecially to the American Midwest. He is also the credited author of several books compiled from his talks. Biography Hanging at the San Francisco Zen Center is this calligraphy piece by Katagiri Roshi which means \\"Deep Appreciation\\". Zen studies Dainin Katagiri was born in Osaka, Japan on January 19, 1928. He was ordained a monk by and named a Dharma heir of Daicho Hayashi at Taizo-in in Fukui, and went on to study under Eko Hashimoto at Eiheiji for three years. After Eiheiji Katagiri enrolled at Komazawa University‚Äîthe renowned S≈çt≈ç institution in Tokyo, Japan‚Äîmajoring in Buddhist studies. In 1963 Katagiri was sent by the Soto Headquarters Office in Japan to Los Angeles, California to serve as a priest at the Zenshuji Soto Zen Mission. In 1965 he was sent to the Sokoji Soto Zen Mission in San Francisco, California to assist Shunryu Suzuki and later helped out the San Francisco Zen Center (SFZC), which had shared the same building as Sokoji until 1969; Katagiri was of great help to Shunryu Suzuki, especially from 1969 onward. [Great help at the SFZC from the day he came around April 1964.- DC] During his years in San Francisco, Katagiri sometimes toyed with the idea of opening up his own Zen community nearby. So, not long before Suzuki's death, he did open a zendo in his home in Monterey, California. USA In 1972 Katagiri relocated to Minneapolis, near Bde Maka Ska (formerly Lake Calhoun). There he became abbot of a small group without a leader, which became known as the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center (Ganshoji). There he also founded Hokyoji Zen Practice Community (Catching the Moon Zen Mountain Center), a country retreat temple in southeast Minnesota. A factor in deciding to go to Minnesota had been the fact that few, if any, Buddhist teachers were located there. Katagiri understood that the majority of teachers at this time were either in New York or California, with much of the country in-between left in need of teachers. During the 1970s and 1980s Katagiri sent over many of his Western students to train at Zuio-ji in Japan, where Narasaki Ikko roshi was abbot.Leighton, 28 In 1984, in the wake of the Zentatsu Richard Baker controversy resulting in Baker's resignation as abbot of San Francisco Zen Center, Katagiri came at the request of SFZC and served as abbot there on an interim basis until 1985 (returning to Minnesota afterward). He remained there for the remainder of his life, succumbing finally to cancer on March 1, 1990; he left behind thirteen Dharma heirs. Personal life Katagiri was married to Tomoe Katagiri, and the couple had two sons together (Yasuhiko and Ejyo). They married in 1960. Acclaim Soto priest and former student of Katagiri-Roshi, Zuiko Redding, has stated, \\"My basic memory of Katagiri is of how he paid total attention to what was in front of him. He took care of each thing as if it were the most important thing in the world, whether it was throwing away some trash or talking to another person. He really listened and tried to give the best answer he knew how to give. He also encouraged each of us to stand up in our own space, following our own wisdom rather than depending on him for answers or affirmation. I would sometimes tell him exactly what I thought about some idea he had, only to turn and see him smiling broadly at me, glad that I wasn‚Äôt buying into his agenda.\\" Criticism Following his death, it was rumored that Katagiri roshi had engaged in sexual relationships with some female students. These rumors have gained a higher profile since one of Katagiri's students, author Natalie Goldberg, wrote about her reaction to these claims.

She was a fighter pilot and an assassin with a trademark thigh-grip, working for the renegade agent Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean). Onatopp has appeared in a number of James Bond video games as a playable multiplayer character. In the film Xenia, born in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, is a former officer and fighter pilot in the Soviet Air Force. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, she joins the crime syndicate Janus, led by renegade MI6 agent Alec Trevelyan. Early in the movie, Bond (Pierce Brosnan) gets into a car chase with her, meets her at a casino, and places her under surveillance. A beautiful, seductive woman who derives sexual satisfaction from killing, she is a classic and quite literal femme fatale. In one memorable scene, she lures a Canadian admiral, Chuck Farrell (Billy J. Mitchell), onto a yacht moored off Monte Carlo and, engaging in violent sexual intercourse, suffocates him to death by squeezing her thighs around his rib cage; she moans in pleasure as he cries in pain, and reaches orgasm as he dies. Meanwhile, fellow operative General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov (Gottfried John) steals his NATO ID, granting them access to a Eurocopter Tiger aboard a French warship anchored off Monte Carlo. Onatopp then hijacks the prototype Eurocopter Tiger by killing the two pilots. Later, she and turncoat Russian General Arkady Ourumov use the hijacked Tiger in an attack on the Severnaya satellite control center in central Siberia, where they steal the controller for the GoldenEye electromagnetic pulse (EMP) satellite weapon. During the attack, she fires an AKS-74U carbine around the control room, murdering all the military personnel and civilian technicians present, again getting sexually aroused in the process. She then appears as Bond's link to the Janus group. In a meeting arranged by Bond's dealings with Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), a Russian arms dealer and former KGB agent, Onatopp arrives to meet Bond as he swims lengths in the Turkish Baths of his hotel ‚Äì The St. Petersburg Grand. Initially sneaking around the pool, Bond discovers her presence and hurls her into the steam room. Onatopp attempts to seduce Bond, forcefully kissing him and coercing the agent to set down his weapon, before biting his lip, causing him to hurl her at the wall. Following a period of violent foreplay where Onatopp crushes Bond between her thighs, Bond finally draws his weapon on her and demands to be taken to Janus. In her final encounter with Bond in Cuba, she ambushes him and Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco) by rappeling from a helicopter and begins torturing him between her legs. However, he is able to connect the rope she rappelled down to her safety harness, grabs her AK-74 rifle, and shoots down the helicopter with it. The result pulls her off him and sends her flying, screaming, into the crotch of a tree, with her safety harness crushing her to death. Bond quips, \\"She always did enjoy a good squeeze\\". In video games Her first appearance in a video game was in the 1997 video game adaptation of GoldenEye, GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64. She is with Trevelyan on the train stage of the game. If the player quickly shoots her after eliminating Ourumov, she will yell to Trevelyan that she is wounded and to wait up for her; this buys the player more time to escape from the train. She later reappears in the jungle stage. Similar to the film, she is killed in the jungles of Cuba in a firefight with Bond. Killing Onatopp is the only way for the player to dual-wield two different guns in the game without a complex series of button presses; she uses an RC-P90 and a grenade launcher at the same time. In the James Bond game Nightfire, Onatopp also appears as a multiplayer character. She can be unlocked by a cheat on the cheats menu as Janus, the organization she works for in the movie. She appeared in the spinoff Bond game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent where she works for Dr. Julius No and is Agent GoldenEye's alluring opponent. She is commander of Dr. No's army, which has taken over the Hoover Dam. She is killed after being thrown off of the Hoover Dam while fighting Goldeneye. In the game, her likeness was based on Famke Janssen but was voiced by actress Jenya Lano. She appears in the GoldenEye remake as a former Russian general who served under Ouromov during the Russian invasion of Georgia. Her plot arc is significantly changed for the remake. She appears in the Nightclub level (where Bond first meets her) disguised as a waitress, and assassinates Valentin Zukovsky after he gives vital information about Janus to Bond - the man is framed for the murder of Zukovsky. She betrays and assassinates General Ouromov in the train level in which she appears. During her final confrontation with Bond, she is lowered down to him from a helicopter and proceeds to engage in hand-to-hand combat with him; she is defeated when Bond launches a missile at her helicopter while she is strangling him, the helicopter crashing into a nearby gorge and dragging her down with it. She is voiced by and modeled after Kate Magowan. Reception Xenia Onatopp has appeared in several lists of the top ten Bond Girls, including by Entertainment Weekly. Yahoo!

It is located 7.8 miles (12.5 km) south-east of Charing Cross, north of Woodside and Addiscombe, east of Selhurst and Thornton Heath, south of Crystal Palace/Upper Norwood and Anerley, and west of Elmers End and Penge. Together with Norwood New Town, it forms the electoral ward of South Norwood in the local authority of Croydon. The ward as a whole had a resident population in 2001 of just over 14,000. The south-eastern side of the district is dominated by the country park which opened in 1989. At the northern end of the town is South Norwood Lake, which was created after the reservoir for the unsuccessful Croydon Canal went out of use.London Canals: Croydon: Norwood It is used by the Croydon Sailing Club and local anglers who fish for carp, bream and perch. There are two secondary schools in the area along with a public leisure centre. South Norwood has a high street which forms part of Selhurst Road, and which includes a number of banks, cafes, shops and other amenities. It is a commuter district, with many residents travelling to either the financial and insurance districts of Croydon or the City of London for employment via the large railway station. South Norwood and surrounding areas are covered by the London SE25 postcode. It is also the southernmost location of the London post town. History The area was originally covered by the Great North Wood, which was a natural oak forest that covered four miles (6 km) of south London. Apart from South Norwood, the wood covered Upper Norwood, West Norwood (known as Lower Norwood until 1885) and the Woodside and Gipsy Hill areas.'Norwood: Introduction', Survey of London: volume 26: Lambeth: Southern area (1956), pp. 167‚Äì173 British History Online References to rents being paid for a coppice called Cholmerden in the area date to the 1400s. By the 1670s the site had been developed into the grounds of Goat House. Handley's Brickworks' seven chimneys once dominated the landscape of the area. It has been demolished and the site changed into grassland and a lake, called Brickfields Meadow. The Jolly Sailor pub The Croydon Canal was constructed in the early 19th century, running from New Cross to the site of West Croydon station. As it passed through South Norwood, pubs sprang up near its course. The Jolly Sailor still stands at the intersection of South Norwood Hill and High Street. The Ship, a few yards to the east, was beside the loading point for bricks from a nearby brick field across what is now the High Street. The passageway through which bricks passed to the canal is still there. The Goat House pub (which has since been demolished) was said to have been named after an island in the canal on which goats were kept. Jolly-sailor station opened in 1839 by the London and Croydon Railway. It was listed as Jolly-sailor near Beulah Spa on fare lists and timetables and renamed 'Norwood' in 1846. The station was immediately adjacent to a level crossing over Portland Road, making it slightly further north than the site currently occupied by Norwood Junction station. As part of the construction works for the atmospheric-propulsion system, the world's first railway flyover was constructed south of Tennison Road, to carry the new atmospheric-propulsion line over the conventional steam line below. In 1847, the atmospheric propulsion experiment was abandoned. In 1848 South Norwood remained a small hamlet, however the following 10-20 years rapid development occurred with the construction of roads and the Selhurst Park estate. The area gained its own parish church, Holy Innocents, in 1895. Much of the growth of the area was the result of William Ford Stanley, who constructed a factory in the area in 1867 and established a technical school here in 1902 (now the Stanley Halls). Further development occurred throughout the 20th century with the building of terraced houses and public housing developments. Large numbers of immigrants from the Caribbean settled here and the area retains a large black population. In 1966, a dog called Pickles discovered the FIFA World Cup Jules Rimet Trophy under a bush in Beulah Hill, which had been stolen from an exhibition of rare stamps at Westminster Central Hall. South Norwood today Caprine-themed bench on Goat House Bridge The area is centred on the junction where the High Street meets South Norwood Hill/Portland Road; the bulk of the shops and amenities are located along the High Street and Selhurst Road/Penge Road, with further shops, restaurants etc. lining Portland Road for some distance. South Norwood is now unofficially divided into the less deprived area in the north west side of the railway, which was the location of a private estate, and the generally more deprived area in the north east.Croydon Decennial Health Atlas 2004 NHS Croydon In the south east of the borough, where workers for a former brick factory lived, the entrance to the estate was between a pair of pillars, though they have long since been demolished. However the capitals were preserved and now sit on the two brick pillars at the Selhurst Road entrance to South Norwood Recreation Ground. In 2006, South Norwood Lakes in the north of the ward was the scene of a fatal stabbing. Governance South Norwood was part of the county of Surrey and the County Borough of Croydon until 1965 when, following the enactment of the London Government Act 1963, it became part of Greater London. The town is now part of the wards of South Norwood and Woodside in the local authority of Croydon, which has the responsibility for providing services such as education, refuse collection, and tourism. South Norwood Ward is part of the ethnically diverse Croydon North parliamentary constituency, which had one of the largest electorates in England at the 2010 general election, whereas Woodside Ward falls within the boundaries of the Croydon Central constituency. The sitting Member of Parliament (MP) for Croydon North is Steve Reed, a member of the Labour Party, following the death of Malcolm Wicks. The sitting Member of Parliament for Croydon Central is Sarah Jones, also a member of the Labour Party. Policing services are provided by the Metropolitan Police via the Croydon Police Station branch in Park Lane, Croydon. The London Fire Brigade provide services for the area and Greater London as a whole; the nearest fire station is at Woodside which has only one pumping appliance. Geography South Norwood is bordered by Anerley to the north, Selhurst to the south, Woodside due east and Thornton Heath to the west. The northernmost point of South Norwood is at Beaulieu Heights (alternatively spelt Beulah Heights, Beaulah Heights and Beulieu Heights) which contains Beulah Heights Park, overlapping with Upper Norwood and New Town. The northern part of the district is situated on the lower parts of the hill that forms Upper Norwood. South Norwood lies on the southern slopes of the Norwood Ridge which forms the southern edge of the London Basin. This line of hills runs from north-east to south-west for about three miles (5 km) and rises to approximately above sea level at its highest point. It is formed by a ridge of grey silty deposits known as London Clay, capped in places with the gravel of the Claygate Beds.http://www.croydononline.org/history/topics/geology2.aspSheet 270 South London, 1:50,000 Geology Series, British Geological Survey, Keyworth, 1998, Because of this gravel working was an important local industry and at one time the road along Beulah Hill was called Gravel Pit Road. South Norwood Hill is the most southerly spur of this ridge and the London Clay extends at its foot to the southern edge of the South Norwood Country Park. Here a brook marks the junction with the sands and gravels of the Blackheath Beds that rise to Shirley, Addington Hills and Croham Hurst. Streams join Chaffinch Brook and the Beck to form the River Pool, which eventually flows into the River Ravensbourne. Education South Norwood Library There are many primary schools in the South Norwood area including Priory Special School, Heavers Farm Primary School, South Norwood Primary School, Cypress Junior School and Cypress Infant School, St. Chad's Roman Catholic Primary School, St. Mark's Primary School and Oasis Academy Ryelands. The former Stanley Technical High School (the legacy of local inventor and engineer William Stanley) has been replaced and turned into an academy as part of the Harris Federation. After deliberations with local residents it was originally going to be called Harris at Stanley, but the federation changed it to Harris Academy South Norwood, which came with some controversy. Many local residents are upset that the name Stanley was removed from the school, as Stanley, who had the original school built in 1907, is a famous and well regarded figure in South Norwood. Harris City Academy Crystal Palace is a city academy in the north west of South Norwood, but to avoid confusion with the other school it uses the Crystal Palace name. South Norwood is also the home of Spurgeon's College, a world- famous Baptist theological college, since 1923; Spurgeon's is located on South Norwood Hill and currently has some 1,000 students. It is one of only four further education establishments in the borough. South Norwood Library is located on Selhurst Road. The building is arranged over five levels split across the front and rear of the building. The front part of the building has the ground floor entrance level, which houses the reception, and the second floor which houses the children's library. The rear of the building has the basement, first and third floors. The levels are offset so that the floors in the front and rear of the building appear like mezzanine levels to each other. Sports and leisure South Norwood F.C. were an amateur football club who were active in the 1870s and played their home matches at Portland Road. Selhurst Park, home ground of Crystal Palace FC is located in South Norwood. The ground was also home to Charlton Athletic as part of a ground sharing agreement between 1985 and 1991. It was also used by Wimbledon when they left Plough Lane until 2003. South Norwood Country Park South Norwood contains a leisure centre which is owned and maintained by Better on behalf of Sport Croydon.South Norwood Pools and Leisure Centre Croydon Council South Norwood Leisure Centre is situated on Portland Road and reopened in late 2007 after refurbishment. It had been closed in early 2006 and was due for demolition, so that it could be redesigned from scratch like the leisure centre in Thornton Heath, at a cost of around ¬£10 million. In May 2006 the Conservatives gained control of Croydon and decided that doing this would cost too much money, so they decided to refurbish the centre instead, although this decision came with controversy. It now includes a 25m swimming pool and a gym. South Norwood is also the home to South Norwood Country Park, a former sewage works which closed in 1966, and of a fireworks factory; it was the converted into a nature reserve. Other parks in the local area are South Norwood Recreation Ground, Heavers Meadow, Brickfields Meadow, Beaulieu Heights, South Norwood Lake and Grounds, Woodside Green and Ashburton Park.  Croydon Sports Arena  Croydon Sports Arena was first opened in 1953 and is a multiple use sports arena in South Norwood. The arena is located on the edge of South Norwood Country Park. Facilities include an eight lane 400m running track, with a centre field and training area for throwing events. The stadium is floodlit. During the winter the inner field becomes a football pitch, home to Croydon F.C.. In the summer the stadium is mostly used for athletic events. It is used by athletics clubs Striders of Croydon and Croydon Harriers. The stands in the sports arena can hold up to 388 people. From 2018, the arena is being managed by Greenwich Leisure Limited. South Norwood Tourist Board South Norwood Tourist Board has spent the last few years trying to promote South Norwood, from organising \\"PicklesFest\\" with Dave Corbett, owner of Pickles; challenging the Lake District for their title; and more recently proclaiming ourselves the People‚Äôs Republic of South Norwood. All these stories have been given media attention across the world, including the BBC, Wall Street Journal, Adam Smith Institute, New York Post and The Independent to name a few. On 26 July 2014, South Norwood Tourist Board, in partnership with Crystal Palace Transition Town invited Captain Sensible to unveil 'The Sensible Seat' a bench within the Sensible Garden; a derelict piece of land in South Norwood, which had been turned into a garden through hard work of the local community.  Culture, music and arts  Stanley Halls  Stanley Halls  Stanley Halls are a 250 seat and 60 seat theatre venues home to a theatre school, offices of resident theatre makers, productions from local theatre clubs, a coffee shop, and other community activities. The Halls are a grade II listed building.  Screen25  Screen25 (formerly Stanley's Film Club) is a non-profit community cinema based at the Harris Academy South Norwood, with a weekly programme of independent and cultural film, as well as family screenings and special events. Transport=Roads Two A roads, the A215 and the A213 are in the South Norwood area. The A213 is High Street, Penge Road and Selhurst Road. The A215 is Portland Road and South Norwood Hill. Arena. This tram is entering South Norwood Country Park. Rail Norwood Junction railway station is situated in the centre of South Norwood just off High Street. It has 7 platforms but only 6 are in use at the present time. Southern and London Overground trains run to London Bridge and Dalston Junction. Fast trains generally take 10 minutes to reach central London and slow trains 20 minutes. Also London Victoria station trains take 20 minutes. East Croydon and West Croydon stations and urban and rural stations thereafter including regular train service to Clapham Junction, Wandsworth Common, Balham and Streaham. Selhurst station is nearby, from which one can catch direct trains to Kensington Olympia and Shepherd's Bush via a train service to Milton Keynes. The Thameslink Programme (formerly known as Thameslink 2000), is a ¬£3.5 billion major project to expand the Thameslink network from 51 to 172 stations spreading northwards to Bedford, Peterborough, Cambridge and King's Lynn and southwards to Guildford, Eastbourne, Horsham, Hove to Littlehampton, East Grinstead, Ashford and Dartford. The project includes the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaduct) and additional rolling stock. The new Thameslink timetable for Norwood Junction started 20 May 2018: \\"Norwood Junction gain[ed] an all-day-long Thameslink service to Bedford via Blackfriars and St Pancras, with two trains per hour to Epsom via Sutton\\" and timetables will continue being expanded and adjusted into 2019. Transport for London began work on the southern extension of the East London line in 2005 as part of the London Overground. On completion in May 2010, services run between West Croydon and Dalston Junction via London Docklands.Full service begins on newly extended East London Line BBC News, 23 May 2010 Trains make an unpublicised stop at Selhurst from Victoria through the night to enable engineers at Selhurst to get to Gatwick and vice versa. This means that it is possible to board the train during the night all through the early hours of morning to South Norwood. However, the trains state East Croydon on the board. Trains run out of Victoria after 1.00 am on the hour until the train service starts up again officially. Trams Trams do not run through the town centre of South Norwood, with the nearest stops on the Tramlink network being Harrington Road, Arena and Woodside. In the mid-2000s there were proposals for an extension to Crystal Palace, which would have resulted in the construction of an additional stop on Penge Road.

The novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and was shortlisted for other awards. The title of the book refers to the Domesday Book of 1086; Kivrin Engle, the main character, says that her recording is \\"a record of life in the Middle Ages, which is what William the Conqueror's survey turned out to be.\\" The novel is the first in a series about the Oxford time-traveling historians, which includes To Say Nothing of the Dog (1998) and Blackout/All Clear (2010).  Plot introduction  Willis' mythos is a near future (first introduced in her story \\"Fire Watch\\" (1982)) in which historians conduct field work by traveling into the past as observers. The research is conducted at the University of Oxford, in mid-21st century England. In the book's fictional universe, history resists time travel that would cause the past to be altered, by preventing visits to certain places or times. Typically the machine used for time travel will refuse to function, rendering the trip impossible. In other cases, \\"slippage\\", a shift in the exact time target, occurs. The time- traveler arrives at the nearest place-and-time suitable for preventing a paradox; variance can be anything from 5 minutes to 5 years. Some periods theoretically accessible can also be deemed too dangerous for the historians by the authorities controlling time travel.  Plot summary  Kivrin Engle, a young historian specializing in medieval history, asks her reluctant instructor, Professor James Dunworthy, and the authorities running the project to send her to Oxford in 1320. This period had previously been thought too dangerous, because it stretched the time travel net 300 years earlier than it had ever been used before. Shortly after sending Kivrin to the 14th century, Badri Chaudhuri, the technician who set the time travel coordinates for the trip, collapses, an early victim of a deadly new influenza epidemic that disrupts the university and leads to the city being quarantined. Kivrin also falls ill as soon as she arrives in the past. She awakens, after several days of fever and delirium, at a nearby manor, whose residents have nursed her. Being moved by her rescuers causes her to lose track of the \\"drop point,\\" the location where she arrives and must return at a prearranged time in order to get home. The narrative switches between Kivrin in the 14th century and 2054/2055 Oxford during the influenza epidemic. Kivrin discovers many inconsistencies in what she \\"knows\\" about the time: the Middle English she learned is different from the local dialect, her maps are useless, her clothing is too fine, and she is far too clean. Kivrin fakes amnesia, afraid the background story she originally concocted would have inconsistencies, as she tries to find the drop point. Meanwhile, she becomes semi-integrated into society, bonding with the children Agnes and Rosemund. In the other timeline, Dunworthy tries to determine if Kivrin is safe as Oxford collapses into panic. He befriends his friend Mary's grand-nephew, Colin, and they become allies. In future Oxford, fears grow that the virus causing the epidemic has been transmitted from the past via the time travel net. This causes acting head of Balliol College Professor Gilchrist to order the net closed, effectively stranding Kivrin in the past. Kivrin and Dunworthy realize that she has arrived in England in 1348 during the Black Death pandemic, more than 20 years later than intended. Because there's no slippage (the time shift between a traveler's intended and actual date of arrival, ensuring they can't change history), it's believed that Badri, delirious with illness, input the incorrect coordinates. It turns out that Badri contracted the influenza virus from human remains at the archaeological dig, when he had been helping there, starting the epidemic at future Oxford. The Black Death cuts a swathe through the Middle Ages, just as disease overwhelms the medical staff of the 21st century. Of those able to help Dunworthy, many die, including his friend Mary Ahrens, a doctor treating the infected who herself succumbs. Dunworthy himself is stricken by the disease but survives. Meanwhile, in the 14th century, two weeks after Kivrin's arrival, a monk infected with the plague comes to the village. Within days, many residents of the village fall ill. Kivrin‚Äôs arranged retrieval date passes with neither side able to make it. At last, Dunworthy arranges for Badri to send him back in time to rescue Kivrin. In the Middle Ages, Kivrin can only watch while all the people she has come to know die from the Black Death. Dunworthy and Colin then find her. The three return to 21st century England shortly after New Year's Day, Colin excited by the concept of time travel, saying he will go to the Crusades when he is old enough.

Her namesake was Nathaniel Fanning. Fanning was launched on 11 January 1912 by Newport News Shipbuilding Company, Newport News, Virginia; sponsored by Mrs. Kenneth McAlpine; and commissioned on 21 June 1912, Lieutenant W. N. Jeffers in command. She was classified DD-37 on 17 July 1920. Pre-World War I In the years that preceded World War I, Fanning took part in the training schedule of the Atlantic Fleet, sailing to the Caribbean for winter maneuvers, and exercising off the coast of New England in the summers. Based at Norfolk, Virginia during the major portion of each year, she joined in gunnery practice in this area. As war raged in Europe, Fanning intensified her preparations for any eventuality. When two German auxiliary cruisers visited Norfolk in September 1916, Fanning acted as part of their escort while they sailed in United States territorial waters. On 8 October, Fanning put out of Newport, Rhode Island, to search for the crews of ships sunk not far from Nantucket Light Ship by the German submarine . The destroyer recovered six survivors and landed them at Newport, Rhode Island the next day. The presence of U-58 led to the speculation that a secret German submarine base might exist in the Long Island Sound‚ÄîBlock Island Sound area; Fanning searched from 12 October to 14 October for evidence of such a base but found nothing, and returned to her regular operating schedule. During the latter half of October 1916, Fanning and the fuel ship conducted experiments to develop methods of oiling at sea, a technique which has since given the United States Navy unbounded mobility and sea-keeping qualities. Torpedo and gunnery practices, and fleet maneuvers during the next eight months sharpened Fannings war-readiness, so that she was able to sail for distant service when called on in June 1917. World War I Based on Queenstown, Ireland, Fanning and her sister destroyers patrolled the eastern Atlantic, escorting convoys and rescuing survivors of sunken merchantmen. At 1615 on 17 November 1917, Coxswain Daniel David Loomis sighted the periscope of U-58, and the Officer of the Deck Lieutenant Walter Owen Henry ordered the destroyer to attack. Fannings first depth charge pattern scored, and as destroyer joined the action, the submarine broke surface, her crew pouring out on deck, hands raised in surrender. The depth charge had hit near the submarines diving planes, forcing the submarine to surface, and also knocked out the main generator aboard Fanning. Fanning maneuvered to pick up the prisoners as the damaged submarine sank, the first of two U-boats to fall victim to US Navy destroyers in World War I. Coxswain Daniel David Loomis and Lieutenant Walter Owen Henry both received the Navy Cross for this action. Fanning continued escort and patrol duty for the duration of the war. Though she made numerous submarine contacts, all of her attacks were inconclusive. On many occasions, she went to the aid of torpedoed ships, rescuing survivors and carrying them into port. On 8 October 1918, she picked up a total of 103 survivors, 25 from a merchantman and 78 from the . Fanning passed in review before President Woodrow Wilson on board the transport in Brest Harbor on 13 December, then remained at Brest until March of the following year. After a quick voyage to Plymouth, England, Fanning departed Brest for the States, by way of Lisbon, Portugal, and Ponta Delgada, Azores, in company with several other destroyers, and escorting a large group of submarine chasers. Fanning was placed out of commission at Philadelphia on 24 November 1919. Inter-war period On 7 June 1924, Fanning was transferred to the Coast Guard with whom she served until 24 November 1930. She was sold for scrap on 2 May 1934. Notable crew Robert Carney served aboard Fanning as gunnery and torpedo officer, and contributed to the sinking of German submarine U-58. On 29 July 1943, he was promoted to Rear Admiral and became Chief of Staff to Admiral William Halsey, Jr., commander, South Pacific Force, which included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. Carney later wrote that \\"Admiral Halsey unfailingly gave credit to his subordinates for successes achieved, and took all blame for failures on his own shoulders.\\" During World War I, Fanning was commanded by Lieutenant Arthur S. Carpender, later Vice Admiral in charge of the entire Atlantic Destroyer fleet during World War II. From 1925 to 1926, Fanning was commanded by Lieutenant Commander James Pine, later Vice Admiral and Superintendent of the United States Coast Guard Academy.

Early life Layton was a native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the West Chester State Teachers College (Now West Chester University) majoring in meteorology with a minor in music. He began playing the organ when he was twelve years old. While serving in the United States Navy during World War II, he learned to play the Hammond organ. After the war, he began a career as a professional organist writing scores for soap operas on CBS. Four noted CBS soap operas were \\"The Secret Storm,\\" \\"Love is a Many Splendored Thing,\\" \\"Love of Life,\\" and \\"Where the Heart Is.\\" During that time, he recorded nearly 27 albums of organ music. He was also noted for traveling the world as a spokesperson and artist for the Hammond Organ company. New York Yankees Layton joined the New York Yankees franchise in 1967 when CBS purchased the Yankees from Dan Topping. Because of pressure from the success of the New York Mets, their new Shea Stadium facility and the popularity of their organist, Jane Jarvis, Topping had installed an organ in Yankee Stadium at the beginning of the 1965 season. Lowrey organ demonstrator Toby Wright was the first Yankee organist and did the 1965 and 1966 seasons. Team president Mike Burke brought Layton in to play organ music at the stadium in 1967. At the time, he had never been to the stadium and knew nothing about baseball. He went on to play the organ for the Yankees for over three decades, taking a break from 1971 to 1977 to pursue other musical commitments. (Wright had returned as organist during that time.) When he retired on September 28, 2003, he played a final performance of \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\", while fans chanted \\"Eddie! Eddie!\\". Current New York Yankees organists Ed Alstrom and Paul Cartier were recruited by Layton to take his place at Yankee Stadium. Other Work In addition to playing for the Yankees, Layton was the organist for the New York Knicks and the New York Rangers from 1967 to 1985. He also played for several seasons of New York Islanders games in the 1990s and served one stint as organist for the indoor New York Cosmos soccer team at Madison Square Garden. Layton also performed concerts in more than 200 cities for the Hammond Organ Company and released 27 albums. In addition, Layton played the organ at Radio City Music Hall for thirty years of Pace University commencements held there. The student union at Pace University's New York City campus was named in his honor. Hobbies Layton loved sailing and owned his own tugboat. He also owned a huge collection of model trains he maintained at his Forest Hills, New York home. Eddie loved demonstrating organs to the public, and giving organ lessons. In 2009, Soapluvva established a YouTube tribute channel to both Eddie Layton and Charles Paul, who were colleagues of each other at the CBS Broadcast Center in Manhattan. Death On December 26, 2004, Layton died of natural causes at his home in Forest Hills, New York at age 79, according to various reports following a brief illness. He was buried at Mount Hebron Cemetery in Queens, New York City, with his feet pointed away from Shea Stadium. Controversy Layton claimed credit as the first to come up with the idea of playing charge calls at a baseball game in 1971. However, Michael Silverbush claims to have made the innovation eight years prior. Ken Burns' 1994 documentary Baseball contained some videographic evidence buttressing Silverbush's claim. During the sequence on the new New York Mets fans in the film's 8th installment, Silverbush can briefly be seen playing a trumpet at the Shea Stadium in 1969.

Metabolic acidosis has three main root causes: increased acid production, loss of bicarbonate, and a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete excess acids. Metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia, which is defined as arterial blood pH that is lower than 7.35. Acidemia and acidosis are not mutually exclusive ‚Äì pH and hydrogen ion concentrations also depend on the coexistence of other acid-base disorders; therefore, pH levels in people with metabolic acidosis can range from low, normal, to high. Acute metabolic acidosis, lasting from minutes to several days, often occurs during serious illnesses or hospitalizations, and is generally caused when the body produces an excess amount of organic acids (ketoacids or lactic acid). A state of chronic metabolic acidosis, lasting several weeks to years, can be the result of impaired kidney function (Chronic Kidney Disease) and/or bicarbonate wasting. The adverse effects of acute versus chronic metabolic acidosis also differ, with acute metabolic acidosis impacting the cardiovascular system in hospital settings, and chronic metabolic acidosis affecting muscles, bones, kidney and cardiovascular health. Signs and symptoms= Acute metabolic acidosis  Symptoms are not specific, and diagnosis can be difficult unless patients present with clear indications for arterial blood gas sampling. Symptoms may include palpitations, headache, altered mental status such as severe anxiety due to hypoxia, decreased visual acuity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, altered appetite and weight gain, muscle weakness, bone pain, and joint pain. People with acute metabolic acidosis may exhibit deep, rapid breathing called Kussmaul respirations which is classically associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Rapid deep breaths increase the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled, thus lowering the serum carbon dioxide levels, resulting in some degree of compensation. Overcompensation via respiratory alkalosis to form an alkalemia does not occur. Extreme acidemia can also lead to neurological and cardiac complications: *Neurological: lethargy, stupor, coma, seizures * Cardiac: Abnormal heart rhythms (e.g., ventricular tachycardia) and decreased response to epinephrine, both leading to low blood pressure Physical examination can occasionally reveal signs of the disease, but is often otherwise normal. Cranial nerve abnormalities are reported in ethylene glycol poisoning, and retinal edema can be a sign of methanol intoxication.  Chronic metabolic acidosis  Chronic metabolic acidosis has non-specific clinical symptoms but can be readily diagnosed by testing serum bicarbonate levels in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel. Patients with CKD Stages G3-G5 should be routinely screened for metabolic acidosis. Diagnostic approach and causes The level of bicarbonate in the blood (HCO3-) determines the severity of acidosis. Bicarbonate measurements are part of routine metabolic panels. Metabolic Acidosis is defined as a reduced serum pH, and an abnormal serum bicarbonate concentration of <22 mEq/L, below the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L. However, if a patient has other coexisting acid-base disorders, the pH level may be low, normal or high in the setting of metabolic acidosis. In the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis can be clinically diagnosed by measuring serum bicarbonate levels in the blood, which is generally a standard component of blood panels. Imperatively, when weighing a metabolic acidosis diagnosis, the change in serum bicarbonate levels over time should be considered; if baseline bicarbonate results are unknown, a single set of values may be misinterpreted.  Causes  Generally, metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid (e.g., lactic acidosis, see below section), there is a loss of bicarbonate from the blood, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. Chronic metabolic acidosis is most often caused by a decreased capacity of the kidneys to excrete excess acids through ammoniagenesis. The typical Western diet generates 20-30 mEq of acid daily, and individuals with normal kidney function increase the production of ammonia to get rid of this dietary acid. As kidney function declines, the tubules lose the ability to excrete excess acid, and this results in buffering of acid using serum bicarbonate, as well as bone and muscle stores. There are many causes of acute metabolic acidosis, and thus it is helpful to group them by the presence or absence of a normal anion gap. Increased anion gap Causes of increased anion gap include: * Lactic acidosis * Ketoacidosis (e.g., Alcoholic, diabetic, or starvation) * Chronic kidney failure * Transient 5-oxoprolinemia due to long-term ingestion of high-doses of acetaminophen (often seen with sepsis, liver failure, kidney failure, or malnutrition) * Intoxication: **Salicylates, methanol, ethylene glycol **Organic acids, paraldehyde, ethanol, formaldehyde **Carbon monoxide, cyanide, ibuprofen, metformin * Propylene glycol (metabolized to L and D-lactate and is often found in infusions for certain intravenous medications used in the intensive care unit) * Massive rhabdomyolysis *Isoniazid, iron, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, valproic acid, verapamil *Topiramate *Sulfates Normal anion gap Causes of normal anion gap include * Inorganic acid addition ** Infusion/ingestion of HCl, * Gastrointestinal base loss **Diarrhea ** Small bowel fistula/drainage ** Surgical diversion of urine into gut loops * Renal base loss/acid retention: ** Proximal renal tubular acidosis ** Distal renal tubular acidosis *Hyperalimentation *Addison disease *Acetazolamide *Spironolactone * Saline infusion To distinguish between the main types of metabolic acidosis, a clinical tool called the anion gap is considered very useful. It is calculated by subtracting the sum of the chloride and bicarbonate levels from the sum of the sodium and potassium levels. As sodium is the main extracellular cation, and chloride and bicarbonate are the main anions, the result should reflect the remaining anions. Normally, this concentration is about 8‚Äì16 mmol/L (12¬±4). An elevated anion gap (i.e. > 16 mmol/L) can indicate particular types of metabolic acidosis, such as types caused by certain poisons, lactate acidosis, and ketoacidosis. It is important to note that the anion gap can be spuriously normal in sampling errors of the sodium level, e.g. in extreme hypertriglyceridemia. The anion gap can also be increased due to relatively low levels of cations other than sodium and potassium (e.g. calcium or magnesium). As a differential diagnosis is made, other tests may be necessary, including toxicological screening and imaging of the kidneys, along with testing of electrolytes (including chloride), glucose, kidney function, and a full blood count. Urinalysis can reveal acidity (salicylate poisoning) or alkalinity (renal tubular acidosis type I). In addition, it can show ketones in ketoacidosis. It is also important to differentiate between acidosis-induced hyperventilation and asthma; otherwise, treatment could lead to inappropriate bronchodilation. Pathophysiology=Compensatory mechanisms Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low concentration of bicarbonate (), which can happen with increased generation of acids (such as ketoacids or lactic acid), excess loss of by the kidneys or gastrointestinal tract, or an inability to generate sufficient . Thus demonstrating the importance of maintaining balance between acids and bases in the body for maintaining optimal functioning of organs, tissues and cells. The body regulates the acidity of the blood by four buffering mechanisms. * Bicarbonate buffering system * Intracellular buffering by absorption of hydrogen atoms by various molecules, including proteins, phosphates and carbonate in bone. * Respiratory compensation. Hyperventilation will cause more carbon dioxide to be removed from the body and thereby decrease pH. * Kidney compensation Buffer The decreased bicarbonate that distinguishes metabolic acidosis is therefore due to two separate processes: the buffer (from water and carbon dioxide) and additional renal generation. The buffer reactions are: :H+ + HCO3- <=> H2CO3 <=> CO2 + H2O The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation mathematically describes the relationship between blood pH and the components of the bicarbonate buffering system: \\\\text{pH}=\\\\text{pK}_a+\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{Log}}\\\\frac{\\\\left[\\\\text{HCO}_3^-\\\\right]}{\\\\left[\\\\text{CO}_2\\\\right]} :Using Henry's law, we can say that [] = 0.03 √ó Pa : (Pa is the pressure of in arterial blood) :Adding the other normal values, we get \\\\text{pH}=6.1+\\\\mathop{\\\\mathrm{Log}}\\\\left[\\\\frac{24}{0.03\\\\times 40}\\\\right] : = 6.1 + 1.3 : = 7.4  Consequences = Acute Metabolic Acidosis  Acute Metabolic Acidosis most often occurs during hospitalizations, and acute critical illnesses. It is often associated with poor prognosis, with a mortality rate as high as 57% if the pH remains untreated at 7.20. At lower pH levels, acute metabolic acidosis can lead to impaired circulation and end organ function.  Chronic Metabolic Acidosis  Chronic metabolic acidosis commonly occurs in people with Chronic Kidney Disease with an eGFR of less than 45 ml/min/1.73m2, most often with mild to moderate severity; however, metabolic acidosis can manifest earlier on in the course of Chronic Kidney Disease. Multiple animal and human studies have shown that metabolic acidosis in Chronic Kidney Disease, given its chronic nature, has a profound adverse impact on cellular function, overall contributing to high morbidities in patients. The most adverse consequences of chronic metabolic acidosis in people with Chronic Kidney Disease and in particular, for those who have end- stage renal disease (ESRD), are detrimental changes to the bones and muscles. Acid buffering leads to loss of bone density, resulting in an increased risk of bone fractures, renal osteodystrophy, and bone disease; as well, increased protein catabolism leads to muscle wasting. Furthermore, metabolic acidosis in Chronic Kidney Disease is also associated with a reduction in eGFR; it is both a complication of Chronic Kidney Disease, as well as an underlying cause of Chronic Kidney Disease progression. Treatment Treatment of metabolic acidosis depends on the underlying cause, and should target reversing the main process. When considering course of treatment, it is important to distinguish between acute versus chronic forms.  Acute Metabolic Acidosis  Bicarbonate therapy is generally administered In patients with severe acute acidemia (pH < 7.11), or with less severe acidemia (pH 7.1-7.2) who have severe acute kidney injury. Bicarbonate therapy is not recommended for people with less severe acidosis (pH ‚â• 7.1), unless severe acute kidney injury is present. In the BICAR-ICU trial, bicarbonate therapy for maintaining a pH >7.3 had no overall effect on the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and the presence of at least one organ failure at day 7. However, amongst the sub- group of patients with severe acute kidney injury, bicarbonate therapy significantly decreased the primary composite outcome, and 28-day mortality, along with the need for dialysis.  Chronic Metabolic Acidosis  For people with Chronic Kidney Disease, treating metabolic acidosis slows the progression of chronic kidney disease. Dietary interventions for treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis include base-inducing fruits and vegetables that assist with reducing the urine net acid excretion, and increase TCO2. Recent research has also suggested that dietary protein restriction, through ketoanalogue-supplemented vegetarian very low protein diets are also a nutritionally safe option for correction of metabolic acidosis in people with Chronic Kidney Disease. Currently, the most commonly used treatment for chronic metabolic acidosis is oral bicarbonate. The NKF/KDOQI guidelines recommend starting treatment when serum bicarbonate levels are <22 mEq/L, in order to maintain levels ‚â• 22 mEq/L. Studies investigating the effects of oral alkali therapy demonstrated improvements in serum bicarbonate levels, resulting in a slower decline in kidney function, and reduction in proteinuria ‚Äì leading to a reduction in the risk of progressing to kidney failure. However, side effects of oral alkali therapy include gastrointestinal intolerance, worsening edema, and worsening hypertension. Furthermore, large doses of oral alkali are required to treat chronic metabolic acidosis, and the pill burden can limit adherence. Veverimer (TRC 101) is a promising investigational drug designed to treat metabolic acidosis by binding with the acid in the gastrointestinal tract and removing it from the body through excretion in the feces, in turn decreasing the amount of acid in the body, and increasing the level of bicarbonate in the blood. Results from a Phase 3, double-blind placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial in people with CKD and metabolic acidosis demonstrated that Veverimer effectively and safely corrected metabolic acidosis in the short-term, and a blinded, placebo- controlled, 40-week extension of the trial assessing long-term safety, demonstrated sustained improvements in physical function and a combined endpoint of death, dialysis, or 50% decline in eGFR.

It is over long, running southwest to northeast between Craven Arms and Much Wenlock, and is roughly 1,083 feet above sea level. The deciduous woodland which runs along it covers much of the steep slopes of the escarpment and in parts it is very well preserved. The Edge at Eaton under Heywood Jack Mytton Way, near Rushbury, Wenlock Edge, Shropshire It was featured on the 2005 TV programme Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of the Midlands. Wenlock Edge contains many interesting features such as Flounder's Folly, Wilderhope Manor and Shipton Hall and waymarked walks such as the Shropshire Way and bridleways such as the Jack Mytton Way. It is a popular area for hillwalking, cycling, mountain biking and horseriding and is also frequented by tourists and sightseers. Robert Hart created a model forest garden from a small orchard on his farm called Highwood Hill in Wenlock Edge. Geology The \\"world famous Wenlock Limestone outcrops\\" are amongst \\"Britain‚Äôs most important geological sites\\". The limestone quarries in the North \\"demonstrate the best examples of reef development during the Silurian Period in Britain.\\" Many species of brachiopods, trilobites and ostracod (microscopic crustaceans) were first found at Wenlock and most of the known Wenlock group Silurian fauna comes from here. Richard Corfield also gave Wenlock edge as an example of the most spectacular reef building the world has ever known. The reef was formed in shallow subtropical seas about 425 million years ago when the area was south of the equator at about the same latitude as the Seychelles is today. A walk by a BBC journalist in 2008 found abundant fossilised crinoids (sea lilies) and brachiopods. The Wenlock Epoch of the Silurian Period is named for the rocks of Wenlock Edge.  Legends Ippikin Local legend tells of a local robber and bandit named Ippikin, who buried his ill-gotten gains in the vicinity of the edge. Tales tell that should anyone stand on the escarpment and say \\"Ippikin, Ippikin, keep away with your long chin\\" that they will be pushed over the edge by the ghost of the erstwhile villain. Major's Leap In the English Civil War a Major Thomas Smallman of nearby Wilderhope Manor was a Royalist officer who was forced to flee from Cromwell's approaching troops after escaping from his manor. As he was carrying important dispatches, he was cornered on the Wenlock Edge. Rather than surrender, he galloped his horse off the edge falling some 200 feet. His horse was killed but the Major was saved by falling into an apple tree. He made his way on foot to Shrewsbury where he delivered the despatches. The area where he made the jump is known as Major's Leap and is said to be haunted by the Major and his horse.

Carbon dioxide is produced continuously as the body's cells respire, and this CO2 will accumulate rapidly if the lungs do not adequately expel it through alveolar ventilation. Alveolar hypoventilation thus leads to an increased PaCO2 (a condition called hypercapnia). The increase in PaCO2 in turn decreases the HCO3‚àí/PaCO2 ratio and decreases pH.  Types  Respiratory acidosis can be acute or chronic. * In acute respiratory acidosis, the PaCO2 is elevated above the upper limit of the reference range (over 6.3 kPa or 45 mm Hg) with an accompanying acidemia (pH <7.36). * In chronic respiratory acidosis, the PaCO2 is elevated above the upper limit of the reference range, with a normal blood pH (7.35 to 7.45) or near-normal pH secondary to renal compensation and an elevated serum bicarbonate (HCO3‚àí >30 mEq/L).  Causes =Acute Acute respiratory acidosis occurs when an abrupt failure of ventilation occurs. This failure in ventilation may be caused by depression of the central respiratory center by cerebral disease or drugs, inability to ventilate adequately due to neuromuscular disease (e.g., myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, muscular dystrophy), or airway obstruction related to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Chronic Chronic respiratory acidosis may be secondary to many disorders, including COPD. Hypoventilation in COPD involves multiple mechanisms, including decreased responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercapnia, increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch leading to increased dead space ventilation, and decreased diaphragm function secondary to fatigue and hyperinflation. Chronic respiratory acidosis also may be secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome (i.e., Pickwickian syndrome), neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and severe restrictive ventilatory defects as observed in interstitial lung disease and thoracic deformities. Lung diseases that primarily cause abnormality in alveolar gas exchange usually do not cause hypoventilation but tend to cause stimulation of ventilation and hypocapnia secondary to hypoxia. Hypercapnia only occurs if severe disease or respiratory muscle fatigue occurs.  Physiological response =Mechanism Metabolism rapidly generates a large quantity of volatile acid (H2CO3) and nonvolatile acid. The metabolism of fats and carbohydrates leads to the formation of a large amount of CO2. The CO2 combines with H2O to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). The lungs normally excrete the volatile fraction through ventilation, and acid accumulation does not occur. A significant alteration in ventilation that affects elimination of CO2 can cause a respiratory acid-base disorder. The PaCO2 is maintained within a range of 35‚Äì45 mm Hg in normal states. Alveolar ventilation is under the control of the respiratory center, which is located in the pons and the medulla. Ventilation is influenced and regulated by chemoreceptors for PaCO2, PaO2, and pH located in the brainstem, and in the aortic and carotid bodies as well as by neural impulses from lung stretch receptors and impulses from the cerebral cortex. Failure of ventilation quickly increases the PaCO2. In acute respiratory acidosis, compensation occurs in 2 steps. * The initial response is cellular buffering (plasma protein buffers) that occurs over minutes to hours. Cellular buffering elevates plasma bicarbonate (HCO3‚àí) only slightly, approximately 1 mEq/L for each 10-mm Hg increase in PaCO2. * The second step is renal compensation that occurs over 3‚Äì5 days. With renal compensation, renal excretion of carbonic acid is increased and bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. For instance, PEPCK is upregulated in renal proximal tubule brush border cells, in order to secrete more NH3 and thus to produce more HCO3‚àí. Estimated changes In renal compensation, plasma bicarbonate rises 3.5 mEq/L for each increase of 10 mm Hg in PaCO2. The expected change in serum bicarbonate concentration in respiratory acidosis can be estimated as follows: * Acute respiratory acidosis: HCO3‚àí increases 1 mEq/L for each 10 mm Hg rise in PaCO2. * Chronic respiratory acidosis: HCO3‚àí rises 3.5 mEq/L for each 10 mm Hg rise in PaCO2. The expected change in pH with respiratory acidosis can be estimated with the following equations: * Acute respiratory acidosis: Change in pH = 0.08 X ((40 ‚àí PaCO2)/10) * Chronic respiratory acidosis: Change in pH = 0.03 X ((40 ‚àí PaCO2)/10) Respiratory acidosis does not have a great effect on electrolyte levels. Some small effects occur on calcium and potassium levels. Acidosis decreases binding of calcium to albumin and tends to increase serum ionized calcium levels. In addition, acidemia causes an extracellular shift of potassium, but respiratory acidosis rarely causes clinically significant hyperkalemia. Diagnosis Diagnoses can be done by doing an ABGA.

At , it is the largest lake in Connecticut. The lake is bordered by five towns: Brookfield, Danbury, New Fairfield, New Milford, and Sherman. Some of the most expensive real estate in Connecticut is located on the shores of the lake, in the towns of Brookfield, New Fairfield, New Milford, and Sherman. Creation=Concept On July 15, 1926, Connecticut Light and Power Company's board of directors approved a plan to create the first large-scale operation of pumped storage facilities in the US. By creating the lake and pumping it full of water from the Housatonic River, then letting the water pour down the penstock and into a turbine, the utility could produce electricity. Candlewood Lake was formed behind a hydroelectric dam south of the Rocky River's junction with the Housatonic River in New Milford. Similar to a giant battery, its main purpose is to store water during periods of low electrical demand for power generation when demand is high. Excess electricity from the valley's hydro-system is used to pump water up a hillside into the lake from the nearby Housatonic River during spring, and overnight hours in summer. The water is then allowed to flow back down into the river when extra electricity is needed in the grid, often during the region's mid-to-late summer heat waves. Power is generated by turbines that are spun by the water flowing into the river while pumping is done by reversing the impellers. Construction Within a few weeks of the decision to move ahead, 50 surveyors began to scout the valley, and lawyers were hired to process the deeds transferring land held by some families since before the American Revolution into the hands of CL&P.; The utility had the power of eminent domain and so the farmers sold their land - $2,356 for , $3,000 for , $100 for . Inhabitants were relocated, but many of the buildings were left standing and some farming equipment was left behind. The roads were not torn up before the valley was flooded. A small cemetery in the area where the lake was built was relocated. Starting in late July 1926, nearly 1,400 men labored to create Connecticut's largest body of water. About 500 men from Maine and Canada hand-felled of woodland, burning the lumber in massive bonfires. Several dams were built. The largest, at the north end of the valley, measured wide and high upon completion. On February 25, 1928, the first pumping operation began pouring water into the valley from the Housatonic. Engineers had planned on the Rocky River and its tributaries filling the valley one-fourth of the way, with the generating plant pumping the remaining three-fourths of the water out of the Housatonic. The valley filled quickly; on September 29, 1928, the water reached an elevation of above sea level, and Candlewood Lake was considered completed. CL&P; owned and operated the lake and hydroelectric power facilities until it was sold for $9 million in June 2006 due to deregulation of the electric power industry by the State in the late 1990s. The lake and generation plant are currently owned by FirstLight Power Resources. Recreation Candlewood Lake is a popular tourist destination, and the area is home to many second homes of New York City residents. The lake is used for recreation year-round, although tourists primarily come during the summer months for swimming, fishing, boating, and golfing. Along its approximately shoreline are tourist resorts and recreational facilities, including golf courses, beaches, and marinas. There is a daytime speed limit for boats and a nighttime speed limit from 1/2 hour after sunset to 1/2 hour before sunrise. A speed limit is in effect within of shore, dock, moored vessels, and other places that the power company has marked as hazardous. The lake is around deep in most places, with some deeper areas that are . Scuba divers can investigate buildings from the era before the lake was created, follow underwater roads, and discover artifacts. Some of the notable underwater finds are Model Ts, plane wreckage from small craft that have hit the lake since then, and covered bridges. Candlewood Lake is home to \\"Chicken Rock\\", a large rock from which people jump into the water. There is also a rope swing that allows people to swing out over the water. The 25-foot high rock, which projects into the lake from the shore on the Sherman side of the New Fairfield-Sherman border, is the site of frequent accidents. Candlewood Lake is home to many private beaches, such as Lynn Deming Park, Millstone Ridge, Candlewood Lake Club, and Sail Harbour Club.https://www.scalzoproperty.com/index.php/properties/sail-harbour/ Northern end of Candlewood Lake with Candlewood Mountain in Springtime Environmental problems Logo of the Candlewood Lake Authority \\"Preserve Candlewood\\" vanity plate The lake has an ongoing problem with the growth of eelgrass and Eurasian milfoil in shallower areas. Because of the silt kicked up by boats and the problem with water weeds and algae, the visibility in the lake is from 5 to . The level of the lake usually is lowered by over the winter in an attempt to freeze weeds. Attempts have been made to trim them with mechanical cutters on barges; this has had limited success. Various chemical and biological methods have been considered, tested and/or employed to fight the weeds. In December 2006, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, working with members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency treated Candlewood Lake for its eelgrass and algae issues with an organic phosphate. Grass-eating weevils were tested in 2008 and 2010, and grass-eating carp were introduced in 2015. In October 2016, zebra mussels were found on the Rocky River power station for the first time, reinforcing fears that the harmful invasive species will eventually make its way into the lake itself.  History  A small village by the name of Jerusalem was submerged in the rising waters. Even before the lake's filling was completed, it became apparent it would draw summer vacationers from as far away as New York City. Land prices on what would become the shoreline had already jumped to $1,000 an acre; summer developments sprang up almost immediately. Although it was almost called Lake Danbury, the new body of water ultimately got its name from New Milford's Candlewood Mountain - which was named after the Candlewood tree, whose sapling branches were sometimes used as candles by early settlers.

The story was first published in Collier's (US) in October 1903 and in The Strand Magazine (UK) in November 1903. Plot Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are visited by \\"the unhappy John Hector McFarlane\\", a young lawyer from Blackheath who has been accused of murdering one of his clients, builder Jonas Oldacre. McFarlane explains to Holmes that Oldacre had come to his office only a day earlier and asked him to draw up his will in legal language. McFarlane saw, to his surprise, that Oldacre was making him the sole beneficiary and even heir to a considerable bequest, and McFarlane cannot imagine why he would do so. That business took McFarlane to Oldacre's house in Lower Norwood, where some documents had to be examined for legal purposes. They had been kept in the safe, where the murder allegedly took place. McFarlane left quite late and stayed at a local inn. He claims to have read about the murder in the newspaper the next morning on the train. The paper said quite clearly that the police were looking for him. The evidence against the young McFarlane is quite damning. His stick has been found in Oldacre's room, and a fire was extinguished just outside in which a pile of dry timber burnt to ashes, complete with the smell of burnt flesh. It seems more than likely that McFarlane did the crime, especially as it is known that he was there around that time. Inspector Lestrade gloats in the apparent knowledge that he, unlike Holmes, is on the right track. Holmes begins his own investigation into the matter by going to Blackheath, which puzzles Lestrade, who had expected him to go first to Norwood. McFarlane's mother, Holmes finds out, was once engaged to Oldacre years earlier but later wanted nothing to do with the man once she found out how cruel he was: he had let a cat loose in a bird sanctuary. Nonetheless, Holmes tells Lestrade that he can see no other explanation for what happened to Oldacre than the official one, propounded by Lestrade. Upon examining the handwritten notes given to McFarlane by Oldacre to be rendered into legally acceptable language, Holmes reckons they were written in a very haphazard fashion, as if the writer failed to care about what he was writing. The alternation between legible handwriting and incomprehensible squiggles suggests to Holmes that the \\"will\\" was written hurriedly on a train, with the legible writing representing stops at stations. Also, Oldacre's financial dealings are found to have been a bit odd. Several cheques for substantial amounts, for unknown reasons, have recently been made out to a Mr. Cornelius. The discovery by Holmes of Oldacre's trouser buttons in the fire ashes does nothing to help exonerate McFarlane, but Holmes has powers of observation that suggest to him convincingly that Oldacre's housekeeper is withholding information. Oldacre appearing Lestrade's gloating reaches a peak when a bloody thumbprint is found at Oldacre's house that matches McFarlane's thumb exactly. However, Holmes becomes quite sure that something very devious is afoot, as he had examined that part of the house only a day earlier, and the thumbprint was quite surely not there then. Because McFarlane has been in gaol since his arrest at 221B Baker Street, Holmes deduces that someone is attempting a deception. Holmes sets up a small fire in one room of the house with a little straw and tells three of his constables to shout \\"Fire!\\" Lestrade and Watson are quite astonished at what happens next: Oldacre emerges alive from a hidden chamber at the end of a hallway, where Holmes has deduced it must be, and runs to escape the fire. Oldacre is immediately seized. It is revealed that McFarlane being accused of his murder had been part of a revenge campaign against the woman who rejected Oldacre years previously, the young mother of McFarlane. Oldacre tries to pass off his actions as a practical joke but is taken into custody, along with the housekeeper as an accomplice. Holmes lightly chaffs his rival for neglecting Blackheath, where he acquired the key information. As for Mr. Cornelius, the recipient of so much of Oldacre's munificence, Holmes deduces that it had likely been an alias used by Oldacre, who has been leading a double life with the eventual goal of shedding his Oldacre identity so that he would be able to start a new life. The bank account of \\"Mr. Cornelius\\" will be seized by Oldacre's creditors. Oldacre swears revenge against Holmes, who serenely dismisses the threats. Holmes remarks to Lestrade that Oldacre's plot was nearly perfect, but he went one step too far by planting the thumbprint after Holmes had already examined the room where it was found, after overhearing through the wall that Holmes was casting doubt on McFarlane's guilt. Background Doyle lived in South Norwood from 1891 to 1894, but the Norwood where Oldacre lives is Lower Norwood, also known as West Norwood. The only connection between the story and South Norwood is that South Norwood's railway station, Norwood Junction, is used by Oldacre. McFarlane spends the night in The Anerley Arms, a pub that existed, as of 2011, which has a derelict upper floor (no more overnight guests) and a change of management. This is one of the few Holmes stories in which a fingerprint provides a good clue to the nature of the problem. The wax thumbprint reproduction idea was devised by, and bought from, Bertram Fletcher Robinson (1870‚Äì1907), who also helped plot The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901). At the start of the story, Watson mentions two unrecorded cases that Holmes investigated around the same time as this story: * \\"The case of the papers of Ex-President Murillo\\", which Doyle later wrote as \\"The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\\". * \\"The shocking affair of the Dutch steamship Friesland\\", which loosely inspired a 1944 episode of the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock HolmesDickerson (2019), p. 146. The episode was titled \\"The Steamship Friesland\\" and aired on 27 November 1944. and the 1945 film Pursuit to Algiers, both starring Basil Rathbone as Holmes. * A reference to Professor Moriarty prefaces the story. \\"'From the point of view of the criminal expert', said Mr Sherlock Holmes, 'London has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented Moriarty'\\". Moriarty is mentioned in two other 1903 stories: 'The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter' and 'The Adventure of the Empty House'. Publication history \\"The Adventure of the Norwood Builder\\" was first published in the US in Collier's on 31 October 1903, and in the UK in The Strand Magazine in November 1903.Smith (2014), p. 118. The story was published with seven illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's, and with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand.Cawthorne (2011), p. 112. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.Cawthorne (2011), p. 110. Adaptations=Film and television The story was adapted as a short silent film released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson, with Cyril Raymond as John McFarlane and Teddy Arundell as Inspector Hopkins. The Granada Sherlock Holmes television series with Jeremy Brett was faithful to the original story with exceptions. In the adaptation, Oldacre kills and burns a tramp, but in the book, he refuses to admit what flesh was burned. Next, Mrs. McFarlane is a recent widow instead of her husband being alive but away. Then, Watson instead of Holmes traces payments to Cornelius. Finally, Holmes, instead of Lestrade, warns McFarlane that his words may be used against him. In the first episode of season two of Elementary, Holmes mentions the Norwood Builder as a case he and Lestrade worked on in London. Radio A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode was adapted by Edith Meiser and aired on 13 April 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 28. Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 17 November 1940.Dickerson (2019), p. 96. Felix Felton adapted the story for the BBC Home Service. Carleton Hobbs played Holmes and Norman Shelley played Watson, with Felton as Inspector Lestrade and John Turnbull as Jonas Oldacre. The adaptation aired on 7 October 1954. The story was adapted as an episode titled \\"The Tale of the Norwood Builder\\" in a series of radio adaptations starring John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson. The episode aired on the BBC Light Programme on 23 November 1954 and NBC radio on 20 February 1955.Dickerson (2019), pp. 285‚Äì286. \\"The Norwood Builder\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules, as part of his complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Peter Sallis as Jonas Oldacre, Donald Gee as Inspector Lestrade, and David Holt as John McFarlane. In it, because of his change of attitude towards fame (acquired while traveling in Tibet during his \\"death\\"), Holmes, at the beginning, informs Watson that \\"there must be no more stories\\" but that Watson should continue to keep notes on their cases to stockpile them for possible future publication. Also, after his capture, Oldacre reveals that he also believed Holmes to be dead. The story was adapted as a 2007 episode of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson, with Rick May as Lestrade.

The population at the 2011 census was 17,872. Historically in Lancashire, it is on the River Irwell in the West Pennine Moors, northwest of Bury, and of Manchester. Its name is believed to derive from Old English ramm and botm, meaning \\"valley of the ram\\". Its Victorian architecture, Pennine landscape and industrial heritage, including the East Lancashire Railway, contribute to heritage tourism in the town. History=Toponymy The name either means \\"ram's valley\\" from the Old English ramm, a ram and botm, a valley but could mean a wild-garlic-valley, with the first element representing the Old English hramsa meaning \\"wild garlic\\". A record from 1324 recording the name as 'Ramesbothum' is inconclusive.Roome, A: Dictionary of Place-Names Bloomsbury (1988) The town was alternatively recorded as Ramysbothom in 1540.Nicolaisen, Gelling & Richards, The Names of Towns and Cities in Britain, p. 157. Early history Evidence of prehistoric human activity has been discovered in the hills surrounding the town. Early records show that in Norman times Ramsbottom was part of the Forest of Rossendale. There are a number of Bronze Age burial sites around the town, the most notable of which is Whitelow Cairn, one mile (1.6 km) southeast of the town centre and three miles (4.8 km) north of Bury. The cairn was excavated by Bury Archaeological Group between 1960-62, under the leadership of Norman Tyson. Finds include one main and seven secondary cremations, four in urns, dating to the mid Bronze Age. Artefacts found during the excavation are housed in Bury Museum. The early Anglo-Saxons who gave Ramsbottom its name progressively felled the woodland during the Middle Ages. Ramsbottom became an area of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland and swamp with a small community of families until the late 18th century. Industrial Revolution Ramsbottom developed during the 19th century as a manufacturing and mill town on the road from Bury to Haslingden by the River Irwell, its suburbs stretched south to Hazelhurst and north to Stubbins. Mills were built for spinning, weaving and printing. Square Mill was in its day innovative in combining many such processes under one roof. With a readily available source of water power, Sir Robert Peel purchased land in Ramsbottom in the late 18th century to commence a major manufacturing career. It is this exchange that effectively founded Ramsbottom as a homogeneous settlement; the factory system, and Industrial Revolution facilitated a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, contributing to it becoming an important and populous mill town. The Grant Arms Hotel in Market Place was the home of William and Daniel Grant, 19th century industrialists closely associated with the rise of the town and reputed to be the inspiration for the Cheeryble brothers in Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens. The Grants' employees were paid in tokens that had to be redeemed at a public house owned by the company. The landlord converted the tokens into cash, but only after deducting threepence per person, which had to be spent on beer, a variation on the truck system. The Grant Arms Hotel closed in 2018 and is currently being developed as offices. A network of roads and railways routed through Ramsbottom allowed for a series of diverse industries, including calico-printing, cotton spinning, machine-making, rope-making and iron and brass founding. Imports of foreign goods during the mid-20th century precipitated the decline of these sectors. Governance From the Middle Ages Ramsbottom was an area in the township of Lower Tottington, in the parish of Bury, and Salford hundred in Lancashire. It was part of the Bury Poor Law Union formed in February 1837, overseen by a Board of 25 Guardians including three from Tottington Lower End using the old workhouses at Bury, Radcliffe, Pilkington and Heywood until a new workhouse at Jericho opened in 1857. In 1864 the Ramsbottom Local Board of Health was formed for the Ramsbottom area in Tottington Lower End township. In 1883 parts of Elton, Tottington Higher End and Walmersley with Shuttleworth townships were added to the area of the Local Board. In 1894 the area of the Local Board became Ramsbottom Urban District. Parts of Bury Borough and Walmersley with Shuttleworth civil parish were added to the urban district in 1933. The urban district was dissolved in 1974 and the Central, East, South and West wards were included in Bury Metropolitan Borough and the remainder in the Rossendale District of Lancashire. Ramsbottom is part of the Bury North constituency which was created in 1983 from parts of the former seats of the former Rossendale and Bury and Radcliffe constituencies. The area was Conservative from 1983 to 1997 when it was gained by Labour who lost in 2010 back to the Conservatives. The seat was regained by Labour in the 2017 general election. In addition, the 2018 local council elections saw Labour gain the Ramsbottom ward. Geography Ramsbottom lies amongst the South Pennines The Ramsbottom parish formed in 1844 was a mile and a quarter in length and about three-quarters of a mile in width in the Lower Tottington township in the valley of the River Irwell that extends from Bury to Rossendale. It is bounded to the south by Holcombe Brook and Summerseat; to the north by Edenfield, Irwell Vale, Stubbins and the hamlets of Chatterton and Strongstry; to the west by Holcombe and to the east by Shuttleworth and Turn Village. The area is characterised by its position on the south side of the West Pennine Moors. The high ground rises sharply on either side of the town with Holcombe Moor, Harcles Hill and Bull Hill to the west and Top O' Th' Hoof, Harden Moor, Scout Moor and Whittle Hill to the east. Transport=Rail LMS 'Jinty' 0-6-0T No. 47324 at Ramsbottom railway station The railway arrived in Ramsbottom in 1846 when the Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway Company built the railway from Bury to a junction with the Manchester and Bolton Railway and extended the line northwards to Rawtenstall and opened a railway station in the town centre. The line between Bury and Rawtenstall remained open to passengers until 1972 and for goods until 1980. This line is used by the East Lancashire Railway, a modern heritage railway which opened in 1987. Road The district straddles the A676, A56 and B6214 roads with its centre north of Bury, south of Rawtenstall and north east of Bolton. The M66 motorway runs to the east of the town, linking it north to the M65 motorway and south to the M62 motorway and the Manchester Outer Ring Road. Landmarks The Peel Monument looking south towards Bury The skyline is dominated by the Peel Monument which stands on Holcombe Moor, a memorial to Sir Robert Peel, the 19th-century British Prime Minister and creator of the modern British police force. The tower stands tall on Holcombe Moor.Bury Council reference to Peel Tower, Holcombe Moor There are views over West Yorkshire, North Lancashire, Greater Manchester, North Wales and the Lancashire Plain. From the top of the tower it is possible to see Blackpool Tower on a clear day. Edward Allington's sculpture \\"Tilted Vase\\" in the centre of Ramsbottom Ramsbottom is on the path of the Irwell Sculpture Trail. The \\"Tilted Vase\\" by Edward Allington, a sculpture both classical in shape to reflect the surrounding buildings but apparently bolted together to reflect the old industries, is located in Market Place. This piece of work, weighing around two tons and locally known as \\"the Urn\\" or \\"Urnie\\", was funded with ¬£250,000 of National Lottery money. Nuttall Park is a large park with facilities for bowls, tennis, football and public events. The park hosts regular fun fairs and family events, and is a popular attraction with locals and tourists alike. Education In 1841, cotton mill owners, the Ashtons built a day school in Crow Lane which was used as a Sunday school and for church services. * Edenfield CE Primary, Stubbins Community Primary, St Joseph's RC Primary, St Andrew's CE Primary, Hazelhurst County Primary, Emmanuel Holcombe CE Primary, Holcombe Brook Community Primary, Summerseat Methodist Primary, Peel Brow Primary * Rossendale School founded in 1989 is a specialist residential and day school for children aged eight to 16 with behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.Rossendale School, ISBI. * Woodhey High School * Darul Uloom Islamic College Religion St Andrew's Church, the oldest church in Ramsbottom, was built by the Grant family in 1834 as a Scottish Presbyterian Church. In the 1860s a member of the Grant family deprived the congregation of its church and in 1869 offered the building to the Bishop of Manchester as an Anglican church. It became a mission church for St Paul's until 1875 when it was consecrated as the Parish Church of St Andrew. In 1993 the church was refurbished and re-ordered and dedicated in 1994. The Ashton brothers donated farm land as site for St Paul's Church which cost ¬£3,400. It was consecrated in 1850. The Anglican Churches in Ramsbottom are part of the Ramsbottom & Edenfield Team Ministry comprising Christ Church Baptist Methodist Church, Dundee United Reformed Church, Greenmount United Reformed Church, Ramsbottom Pentecostal Church, Ramsbottom Evangelical Church, St Andrew's CE Church, St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, St Paul's CE Church and Darul Uloom Islamic College.

The team has included professional players such as Seymour Nurse (West Indies), Chris Harris (New Zealand), Brad Hodge (Australia and Lancashire CCC), Ian Harvey (Australia and currently Derbyshire CCC), Ian Chappell (Australia) and Michael Clarke (Australia Captain) Its ground, close to Ramsbottom railway station, has a reputation as being one of the best and most picturesque in the North West of England. Ramsbottom United F.C. play in the Northern Premier League Division One North (level 8 in the Football League System). They were crowned champions of the North West Counties League at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season. The club's home games are played at its floodlit pitch, the Riverside Ground which has a capacity of 2,000, adjacent to the cricket ground. Culture and community Hundreds of people climb Holcombe Hill on Good Friday.Easter Traditions A smaller gathering keeps alive the tradition of egg rolling before the start of the climb. Large gatherings on the hill are visible from miles away, and occasionally attract unorthodox religious preachers. In recent years the celebrations have become more secular, with the public house at the bottom of Holcombe Hill attracting as many as 3,000 visitors leading to complaints from residents and restrictions being imposed by the council.Bury Council Ye Olde Gamecock Show, an exhibition of game fowl is held in the town on New Year's Day. The show was held at The Old Dun Horse from 1843 until it closed in 2010 and has since been hosted by the Ramsbottom branch of the Royal British Legion. This competitive show replaced the annual cockfight that took place in the town square after the New Year Holcome Hunt. The exhibition, organised by the Holcombe Old English Game Fowl Club, is said to be the oldest gamecock show in the world. The Summerseat Players, a registered charity run entirely not-for-profit, puts on five performances in each season, and performances by local schools and dance groups, and the company's youth theatre groups. The amateur dramatic group was formed in 1968, and performed at St Winifred's Church Hall in Summerseat. In 1990, with donations and loans from members and enthusiasts, the company purchased the Theatre Royal on Smithy Street in Ramsbottom.Summerseat Players Ramsbottom hosts an annual rhythm & blues festival. The now defunct pub the Corner Pin, was where the band Elbow played their first gig. The Ramsbottom Recorded Music Society was formed in 1967 to promote an interest and appreciation of music and meets bi-weekly on Thursday evenings at Christ Church Neighbourhood Centre. Ramsbottom has three supermarkets: Aldi, which opened in 2009, Tesco Metro, which opened in 2007 (previously Kwik Save, which originally opened in 1988), and Morrisons (previously Co-Op, which originally opened in 2001), which also opened in 2009. The Black Pudding Throwing World Championships are held annually at the Royal Oak (now the Oaks) pub on Bridge Street. Participants have to toss black puddings in an attempt to dislodge a stack of Yorkshire puddings on plinths on two levels (one for children, the other for adults). The winner is the one who dislodges most Yorkshire puddings in three attempts. Media The area is covered by the Bury Times, Lancashire Telegraph and Rossendale Free Press newspapers. News and sport in the area are covered by BBC Radio Lancashire and BBC Radio Manchester and by Rossendale Radio, a community radio station until it ceased broadcasts in March 2012. For free to air television the area is within the BBC North West and ITV Granada regions. In 2015 the first podcast for Ramsbottom (This is Rammy) launched which went on to win the award for UK Best Places and Travel in the very first UK Podcasters Awards that took place in The Midland Hotel, Manchester. This is an annual awards ceremony voted for by the listeners and community behind each podcast.

Location NAS Jacksonville is located in Duval County, Florida, within the city limits of Jacksonville. The base sits on a piece of land between the St. John's River and Ortega River historically called Black Point. The airbase is part of the overall Jacksonville Naval Complex, a collection of Navy Bases in the Jacksonville Metropolitan Area that include Naval Station Mayport, the former Naval Air Station Cecil Field (now Cecil Airport), Naval Outlying Landing Field Whitehouse, and the Pinecastle Range Complex. It also neighbors a small ghost town called Yukon. History During World War I, the area now occupied by NAS Jacksonville, often referred to colloquially as \\"NAS Jax\\", was named Camp Joseph E. Johnston, and was commissioned on October 15, 1917. The United States Army trained quartermasters and the center included more than 600 buildings; by 1918 Camp Johnston was the largest of all Quartermaster mobilization and training camps.Annual Report of the Quartermaster General for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1918, page 169 (Government Printing Office, 1918). The second largest rifle range in the U.S. was constructed there, but the camp was decommissioned on May 16, 1919. The Florida National Guard began using the site in 1928 and it was renamed Camp J. Clifford R. Foster. In 1939 a group of 10 ex service men traveled to Washington at their own expense to talk the Navy, who was looking for a new base, to come and look at the old National Guard base, they did and liked what they saw. Most of their names are lost to history. Only two are known: Charles Bennett and Ira Lane.  Jacksonville Naval Complex Commissioning  On October 15, 1940, Naval Air Station Jacksonville was officially commissioned, and became the first part of the Jacksonville Navy complex. On the same date, Captain Charles P. Mason, USN, raised his command pennant as the station's first commanding officer. Prior to the commissioning, on September 7, Commander Jimmy Grant became the first pilot to land on the still unfinished runway in his N3N-3 biplane. More than 10,000 pilots and 11,000 airmen followed their lead to earn their \\"wings of gold\\" at the air station during World War II. Increased training and construction characterized NAS Jacksonville's response to America's entry into World War II. Three runways over long were operating, as were seaplane runways in the St. Johns River and seaplane ramps leading from the water. Overhaul and Repair (O&R;) facilities were built to rework the station's planes, a facility that in ensuing years would be renamed Naval Air Rework Facility Jacksonville (NARF Jax). More than 700 buildings sprung to life on the base before V-J Day (Victory over Japan), including an hospital and a prisoner-of-war compound which housed more than 1,500 German prisoners of war. Archbishop (later Cardinal) Francis J. Spellman dedicated the Catholic Chapel (St. Edward's) at its Birmingham Avenue location on January 17, 1943. The chapel and other buildings constructed during the war years, intended for a life of only 20 years, are still in use. FAA Airport Diagram During the late 1940s, the jet age was dawning and in 1948 the Navy's first jet carrier air groups and squadrons came to NAS Jacksonville. By April 1949, NAS Jacksonville was the East Coast's aircraft capital, with more naval aircraft stationed here than at any other naval base from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean ‚Äì 60 percent of the Fleet's air striking force in the Atlantic area from pole to pole. Fleet Air Wing Eleven made its move to the base, bringing with it Patrol Squadron THREE (VP-3) from NAS Coco Solo, Panama and Patrol Squadron FIVE (VP-5) from NAS San Juan, Puerto Rico. The now famous U.S. Naval Flight Demonstration Squadron, the Blue Angels, who had called NAS Jacksonville home but later moved to NAS Corpus Christi in the late 1940s, performed a last air show at the station on April 29, 1950, before forming the nucleus of an operational fighter squadron, VF-191 (Satan's Kittens), which was assigned to combat in Korea. The \\"Blues\\" would not return to the station for more than two years. In the early 1950s, Naval Air Technical Training Center (NATTC) Jacksonville was also reactivated and included nine different schools. Aerial view of NAS Jacksonville in the mid-1940s In the mid-1950s, an air traffic control center for joint use by the Navy, Air Force, and Civil Aeronautics Administration was approved and completed at a cost of $325,000. Major changes also occurred as parking ramps were added shore-based aircraft hangars and a -long taxiway was built. With the station's continuing growth, the Navy was having a tremendous impact on the economic growth in the Jacksonville and Duval County area. The station had over 11,000 military personnel assigned, along with 5,000 civilians and an annual payroll of more than $35 million. In March 1959, Marine Attack Squadron ONE FOUR TWO (VMA-142) of the Marine Corps Reserve relocated to NAS Jacksonville from the closing MCAS Miami, along with the associated Marine Air Reserve Training Detachment (MARTD). VMA-142 would remain at NAS Jax until its relocation to nearby NAS Cecil Field in 1978. On July 1, 1957, The United States Air Force Air Defense Command established a Phase III Mobile Radar station at NAS Jacksonville with the 679th Aircraft Warning and Control Squadron operating AN/FPS-3, AN/FPS-8, and AN/MPS-14 radars as part of the integrated ADC radar network. It was designated as ADC site M-114. In 1962 AN/FPS-66 radar and a pair of AN/FPS-6 heightfinder radars were added. During 1962 M-114 joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, and the squadron was re-designated as the 679th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 October 1962. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-114. In addition to the site at NAS Jacksonville, the 679th operated several \\"Gap Filler\\" remote sites to extend its radar coverage at Bunnell, FL and Blythe Island, GA. In 1963 M-114 became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It performed routine general radar surveillance until 30 September 1981 when the site was inactivated.A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946‚Äì1980, by Lloyd H. Cornett and Mildred W.

Prepared for United States Air Force Headquarters Air Combat Command.  Growth and Consolidation  In 1970, a major reorganization of the Naval Reserve resulted in three separate Naval Air Reserve flying squadrons, identical to their active duty Regular Navy counterparts, being activated at NAS Jacksonville. These squadrons consisted of Attack Squadron TWO ZERO THREE (VA-203), Patrol Squadron SIXTY- TWO (VP-62) and Fleet Logistics Support Squadron FIFTY-EIGHT (VR-58). VA-203 would later relocate to NAS Cecil Field in 1977, with the remaining reserve squadrons joined by Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron SEVENTY-FIVE (HS-75) in 1985 following its relocation from NAS Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. In 1973, with the assignment of Helicopter Antisubmarine Wing One, the station's primary mission became antisubmarine warfare. Accompanying the wing were five helicopter squadrons which are still based here today. With the new wings and squadrons, opportunities grew for both sea duty and shore duty assignment to NAS Jacksonville. The station's popularity grew and it became one of the most requested duty station for sailors and officers in Naval Aviation throughout the Navy. A piece of history and Navy and Marine Corps tradition was lost in 1986 when the last unit of Marines left NAS Jacksonville. Marine Barracks Jacksonville had been one of the first groups to arrive at the base in 1940, but left due to mission realignments and a reduction in Marines authorized for Marine Corps Security Force duties at U.S. Naval installations. Force reductions continued in the 1990s and early 2000s with the elimination of P-3 squadrons (VP-24, VP-49, VP-56) and H-60 squadrons (HS-1, HS-9, HS-75). With the BRAC-directed closure of NAS Brunswick, Maine by mid-2011, Patrol Squadron EIGHT (VP-8), Patrol Squadron TEN (VP-10), Patrol Squadron TWENTY-SIX (VP-26), Special Projects Patrol Squadron ONE (VPU-1) and Fleet Logistics Support Squadron SIXTY-TWO (VR-62) began relocating to NAS Jacksonville in 2007 with their P-3 and C-130T aircraft, with all of these squadrons in place at NAS Jacksonville by late 2010. Current operations The installation is one of the central hubs for naval activity in the U.S. South, with over 50,000 civilian employees, contractors and active-duty personnel employed. NAS Jacksonville is also home to Patrol Squadron THIRTY (VP-30), the Navy's largest aviation squadron and the only P-3 Orion and P-8 Poseidon Fleet Replacement Squadron that prepares and trains U.S. and NATO/Allied pilots, air crew and maintenance personnel for further operational assignments in the P-8A, P-3C Orion and EP-3E Aries in the U.S. Navy, and P-3B, P-3C and similar variants in various NATO and Allied navies and air forces. VP-30 is the first squadron to operate the U.S. Navy's new P-8 Poseidon aircraft, and commenced training flight crews and maintainers in this replacement for the P-3C in 2012, with all U.S. Navy patrol squadrons eventually slated to transition to this new platform. In addition, NAS Jacksonville is home to Naval Hospital Jacksonville, under Navy Medicine, which supports all medical programming across naval installations in Florida, including providing the command structure for five Base Health Clinics (BHCs) from Jacksonville to Key West.Naval Air Reserve Training Unit hangar 113 in 1958 Finally, support facilities at NAS Jacksonville include its being an Aviation Maintenance training facility for several aviation ratings (facilitated by the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit Jacksonville), an additional outlying field (OLF Whitehouse) for pilot training, a maintenance depot employing more than 150 different trade skills capable of performing maintenance as basic as changing a tire to intricate micro-electronics or total engine disassembly, a Fleet Industrial Supply Center, a Navy Family Service Center, a DeCA commissary, Navy Exchange, and recreational facilities for both single sailors and families of the Active, Reserve and Retired military communities. NAS Jacksonville houses a facility to train pilots for the Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton. In addition to that NAS Jacksonville has trained foreign aircrews including that of Royal Australian Navy's New Squadron 725.  Fleet Readiness Center Southeast  Fleet Readiness Center Southeast is the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) maintenance, repair and operations depot for NAS Jacksonville. The depot was originally founded as Naval Air Rework Facility (NARF) Jacksonville. With the growth of NAS Jacksonville into a major military aviation hub, the facility underwent a major change to keep up with the growth, thus being renamed to Naval Aviation Depot (NADEP) Jacksonville. Around the 2010s, NAVAIR underwent a major reorganization, converting all of its naval air depots into Fleet Readiness Centers, now directed under the Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers (COMFRC); thus, NADEP Jacksonville was renamed Fleet Readiness Center Southeast, and became the depot for all of the Southeastern United States. Staffed at over 5,000 DoN Civilian Employees, Contractors, and Military personnel, Fleet Readiness Center Southeast is the largest employer in Northeast Florida/Southern Georgia region.

Primary component has 58% of the mass of the Sun, 69% of the Sun's radius, and a very low projected rotation velocity of 1 km/s at the stellar equator. The star is known to be a low activity flare star, which means it undergoes random increases in luminosity because of magnetic activity at the surface. The spectrum shows emission lines of calcium in the H and K bands. The emission of X-rays has been detected from the corona of this star. These may be caused by magnetic loops interacting with the gas of the star's outer atmosphere. No large-scale star spot activity has been detected. The space velocity components of this star are U = +12, V = ‚Äì11 and W = ‚Äì12 km/s. The orbit of this star through the Milky Way galaxy has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an orbital inclination of 0.005. Planetary system A substellar companion was discovered in 1994 by Caltech astronomers Kulkarni, Tadashi Nakajima, Keith Matthews, and Rebecca Oppenheimer, and Johns Hopkins scientists Sam Durrance and David Golimowski. It was confirmed in 1995 as Gliese 229B, one of the first two instances of clear evidence for a brown dwarf, along with Teide 1. Although too small to sustain hydrogen-burning nuclear fusion as in a main sequence star, with a mass of 21 to 52.4 times that of Jupiter (0.02 to 0.05 solar masses), it is still too massive to be a planet. As a brown dwarf, its core temperature is high enough to initiate the fusion of deuterium with a proton to form helium-3, but it is thought that it used up all its deuterium fuel long ago. This object now has a surface temperature of 950 K. In March 2014, a super-Neptune mass planet candidate was announced in a much closer-in orbit around GJ 229. Given the proximity to the Sun, the orbit of GJ 229Ab might be fully characterized by the Gaia space- astrometry mission or via direct imaging. In 2020, a super-Earth mass planet was discovered around GJ 229. It orbits the star closer in than GJ 229Ab, and is located in the star's habitable zone. Note: Minimum mass of GJ 229B as measured by radial velocity measurements is 1.62 Mj. However, observations of GJ 229B suggest, that the system is viewed with a relative face-on orientation with an inclination of . If that is true and the planetary system is coplanar, then the real masses of all plantes would be at least ~4.5 times more massive than the minimal mass derived from radial velocity measurements (2.6 up to 57 times of minimal mass, depending on exact value of inclination).

Venezuela claims the territory as part of Guayana Esequiba. The region is located in the northwest of the country. It covers an area of 20,339 km¬≤. It borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the region of Pomeroon-Supenaam to the east, the region of Cuyuni- Mazaruni to the south and Venezuela to the west. History Prior to the 1980 administrative reform in Guyana, the Barima-Waini Region was known as the 'North West district'.UK Directorate of Overseas Surveys 1:500,000 map of Guyana NW sheet, 1966. Mabaruma became the administrative centre when it was decided that the former centre, Morawhanna, was too susceptible to flooding. Etymology The region is named after two rivers that flow through the region; the Barima River and the Waini River. Geography Barima-Waini is a heavily forested region. The Atlantic coastal strip of Region One features a number of beaches, including, from west to east, Almond Beach, Luri Beach, Shell Beach, Turtle Beach, Foxes Beach, Iron-punt Beach, Pawpaw Beach and Father's Beach. Marine turtles nest on some of these beaches. There are also a number of Amerindian communities in this area, including Santa Rosa Mission. Economy The main economic activities in the Barima-Waini region are forestry and gold mining. The northern and northeastern sections include thousands of acres of rich alluvial soil, of which its main crops include coffee, ground provisions (such as cassava, eddoes and yams), cabbage, beans, corn, peanuts, and citrus fruits. (This is the area which supplies the famous Pomeroon casareep). The Matthews Ridge-Port Kaituma manganese industry was discontinued in 1968 when falling world prices made it uneconomical to continue. Mining has resumed as of 2011. Major Settlements, Services and Facilities Major settlements include Mabaruma (the regional capital), Port Kaituma, Matthew's Ridge, Morawhanna, Towakaima, Koriabo, Hosororo, Arakaka and Moruca. The region has two secondary schools, North West Secondary School in Mabaruma, established in 1965, and Santa Rosa Secondary School, established in 1992. Population The Government of Guyana has administered three official censuses since the 1980 administrative reforms, in 1980, 1991 and 2002. In 2002, the population of Barima-Waini was recorded at 24,275 people.

The neighborhood roughly corresponds to the area between 7th and Broad Streets and between Chestnut and South Streets, bordering on the Independence Mall tourist area directly northeast, Market East to the northwest, Old City and Society Hill to the East, Bella Vista directly south, Hawthorne to the southwest, and mid-town Philadelphia and Rittenhouse Square to the west. In addition to being a desirable residential community, it is considered a hip, trendy neighborhood that offers a diverse array of shops, restaurants, and coffee houses. Washington Square West contains many gay-friendly establishments and hosts annual events celebrating LGBT culture in Philadelphia including OutFest. The area takes its name from Washington Square, a historic urban park in the northeastern corner of the neighborhood. Philadelphia's Antique Row lies in the area, as does the nation's oldest hospital, Pennsylvania Hospital, and Philadelphia's oldest Jewish burial ground, Mikveh Israel Cemetery. Educational and medical facilities associated with Thomas Jefferson University, a leading regional medical university and health care center, are located within the neighborhood. The one-time headquarters of the former Curtis Publishing Company and the University of the Arts lie at the edges of the neighborhood. Washington West's real estate is mixed commercial, residential and service industries, characterized by two, three, and four-story rowhouses interspersed with condominiums, mid-rise apartments, hospitals and offices with ground- floor retail. The neighborhood follows William Penn's original grid layout for the city, with many one-lane and pedestrian side streets added later as the population became more dense. In addition to the block sized Washington Square Park to the East, the neighborhood contains the smaller Kahn Park, named after the Philadelphia architect Louis Kahn who resided in the neighborhood. History A prototypical side street in Washington Square. The name \\"Washington Square West\\" came into official use in the late 1950s and early 1960s as part of Edmund Bacon's comprehensive plan for Center City.Lowe, Jeanne R., Cities in a Race With Time: Progress and Poverty in America's Renewing Cities, (5th page of photographic plates in center), Random House NY, 1967. In this plan, the south-east quadrant of center city was split into Washington Square East (more commonly known as Society Hill) and Washington Square West. Both neighborhoods were scheduled for urban renewal by Philadelphia's City Planning Commission and Redevelopment Authority. After a period of decline in the early 20th century, city officials hoped that redevelopment would clean up the neighborhood and clear blighted areas. After large-scale renewal of Washington Square East/Society Hill in the early 1960s, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority turned to Washington Square West. In the late 1960s, the Redevelopment Authority bought and demolished buildings and, by the mid-1970s, owned one-fifth of the neighborhood.Kromer, John, Neighborhood Recovery: Reinvestment Policy for the New Hometown, p24, Rutgers University Press NJ, 2000. By this time, however, federal money available for urban renewal had declined and the city was no longer able to fund the renewal of Washington Square West. Buildings razed by the city in the 1960s and 1970s were left as empty lots and the neighborhood was left in a state of decline. Through the late 1970s and 1980 began a slow recovery without the aid of the large-scale redevelopment that had occurred in Society Hill. The 1990s saw a shift in the neighborhood as Mayor Ed Rendell encouraged investment in Center City and gentrification began to take hold. By the end of the 1990s and early 2000s, the neighborhood had transformed into an economically vital community. The Washington Square West Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The area encompasses 450 contributing buildings. Located in the district and separately listed are the Clinton Street Historic District, Roberts-Quay House, and Portico Row. Note: This includes The Gayborhood A decorated street sign on the edge of Philadelphia's Gayborhood on April 30, 2007 The area approximately located around Chestnut, Pine, Juniper and 11th Streets within Washington Square West is known as The Gayborhood. It is so-named because of its large concentration of LGBT-friendly small businesses, services, restaurants, and gay bars. It was also a red light district and center of Philadelphia's gay bathhouse culture in the 1970s and 1980s. The area is the location for Philadelphia's annual OutFest: National Coming Out Day celebration. On 18 April 2007, the city of Philadelphia officially recognized the area by adding 36 gay pride rainbow flag symbols to street signs bordering the Gayborhood area. 32 additional signs were added in June 2010. On 25 June 2015, rainbows, indicating LGBT pride, were painted onto crosswalks on the corner of 13th and Locust Streets.http://www.phillymag.com/g-philly/2015/06/25/first-look-philadelphias- rainbow-crosswalks/#gallery-2-7 Its success as a city neighborhood has led to several attempts at large scale private development in the Gayborhood in the 2000s. In 2002, developer Tony Goldman attempted to change 13th Street and its surroundings into the \\"Blocks Below Broad\\" or \\"B3\\", with the launch of several new retail establishments. The attempt failed but was repeated in 2006 by a merchants association organized by James McManaman. While the organization has attempted to re-brand the neighborhood \\"Midtown Village\\" and launched new retail establishments along 13th Street, long-time residents, professionals, and proprietors refer to the area as the Gayborhood or Center City.Creed, Ryan, \\"\\"; Philadelphia Citypaper, 27 September 2007 Notable residents View of Antique Row from Kahn Park at 11th and Pine Street on August 14, 2007 * Louis Kahn (1901‚Äì1974), architect * Christopher Morley (1890‚Äì1957), author * M.

Zhajiang sauce is normally made by simmering stir-fried ground pork or beef with salty fermented soybean paste. Zhajiang also means \\"fried sauce\\" in Chinese. Although the sauce itself is made by stir-frying, this homonym does not carry over into the Classical Chinese term. The topping of the noodles usually are sliced fresh or/and pickled vegetables, including cucumber, radish, edamame, depending on regions. Chopped omelette or in lieu of extra firm tofu can also be alongside. Low-fat dieters often use minced skinless chicken for the meat portion.  History =Origin Zhajiangmian originates from Shandong province and is an iconic Northern Chinese dish. It is unknown how the dish came to be and only a few folktales are available. Spread of vegetarian Zhajiangmian to Beijing During the Guangxu era of the Qing dynasty, after the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China and conquered Beijing, the Empress Dowager Cixi, Emperor Guangxu and their retinues were forced to retreat from Beijing to Xi'an. On their way, the Imperial Eunuch, Li Lianying detected a pleasant aroma, and found that the smell came from a zhajiangmian restaurant. He then reported about the restaurant to Cixi and Guangxu. Due to collective fatigue and hunger after their long trip, Cixi and Guangxu decided to have a meal in the restaurant. Li Lianying ordered a bowl of vegetarian zhajiangmian. Finding it tasty, they ordered another one. After dinner, Cixi asked everyone how they found the taste of the dish. They all replied \\"This is definitely a good noodle. Good, good!\\" Shortly after, as Emperor Guangxu was about to leave and continue their trip, Cixi demanded that Li Lianying bring the chef who made the zhajiangmian to Beijing and the palace, so they could eat zhajiangmian often once they came back. This is the story of how the vegetarian zhajiangmian made its way to Beijing. Analysis of the subjective factors such as Beijing city development in Qing and Ming dynasties, food supply, climate, people' s living conditions comes to a conclusion that Bean Paste Noodles and Old Beijing Noodles with Fried Bean Sauce occurred at the same time.The symbolic sign\\"Old Beijing Noodles with Fried Bean Sauce\\"is hidden but rich in profound cultural connotation. Types=Shandong In Shandong cuisine, the sauce is made with tianmianjiang and this version of zhajiangmian is commonly viewed as the standard within China. Beijing In Beijing cuisine, yellow soybean paste is used to make the sauce. Tianjin In Tianjin cuisine, bean paste is used to make the sauce. Guangdong In Cantonese cuisine, hoisin sauce is used to make the sauce. Sichuan In Sichuan cuisine, doubanjiang is used to make the sauce. Northeast China In Liaoning and Jilin, the sauce is traditionally fried with doenjang due to the influence of Korean-Chinese people in these areas. Hong Kong In Hong Kong cuisine, ketchup is used to make the sauce. Buddhist A vegetarian version of zhajiang sauce may be made by substituting ground beef or pork with finely diced extra firm smoked tofu (ÁÜèË±ÜËÖê‰πæ), edamame (ÊØõË±Ü), eggplant, or extra firm tofu (Á¥†Èõû). The vegetarian versions generally call for soybean paste of any sort instead of soy sauce, since the tofu chunks are larger and need more structure. Islamic A halal version is often made with ground beef or lamb. South Korea In South Korea, zhajiangmian has evolved into jajangmyeon when workers from Shandong were sent by the Chinese military to Korea.Chinese, Korean and Japanese Versions of One Noodle Bowl and Where to Find Them, Westword Japan In Japan, zhajiangmian evolved into jajamen („Åò„ÇÉ„Åò„ÇÉÈ∫∫) when it was brought from Northeast China.

Japanese warrior in armor Body armor, also known as body armour, personal armor/armour, or a suit/coat of armour, is protective clothing designed to absorb or deflect physical attacks. Historically used to protect military personnel, today it is also used by various types of police (riot police in particular), private security guards or bodyguards, and occasionally ordinary civilians. Today there are two main types: regular non- plated body armor for moderate to substantial protection, and hard-plate reinforced body armor for maximum protection, such as used by combat soldiers. History Mycenaean armor, c. 1400 BC Bronze lamellae, Vietnam, 300 BC ‚Äì 100 BC Many factors have affected the development of personal armor throughout human history. Significant factors in the development of armor include the economic and technological necessities of armor production. For instance full plate armor first appeared in Medieval Europe when water-powered trip hammers made the formation of plates faster and cheaper. At times the development of armor has run parallel to the development of increasingly effective weaponry on the battlefield, with armorers seeking to create better protection without sacrificing mobility. Ancient The first record of body armor in history was found on the Stele of Vultures in ancient Sumer in today's south Iraq. The oldest known Western armor is the Dendra panoply, dating from the Mycenaean Era around 1400 BC. Mail, also referred to as chainmail, is made of interlocking iron rings, which may be riveted or welded shut. It is believed to have been invented by Celtic people in Europe about 500 BC. Most cultures who used mail used the Celtic word or a variant, suggesting the Celts as the originators.Simon James, The World of the Celts (London: Thames and Hudson, 1993) p. 75-9, 114 The Romans widely adopted mail as the lorica hamata, although they also made use of lorica segmentata and lorica squamata. While no non-metallic armor is known to have survived, it was likely to have been commonplace due to its lower cost. The use of iron plate armor on the Korean peninsula was developed during the Gaya Confederacy of 42 CE - 562 CE. The iron was mined and refined in the area surrounding Gimhae (Gyeongsangnam Provence, South Korea). Using both vertical and triangular plate design, the plate armor sets consisted of 27 or more individual 1-2mm thick curved plates, which were secured together by nail or hinge. The recovered sets include accessories such as iron arm guards, neck guards, leg guards, and horse armor/bits. The use of these armor types disappeared from use on the Korean Peninsula after the fall of the Gaya Confederacy to the Silla Dynasty, during the three kingdoms era Three Kingdoms of Korea in 562 CE.Korean Archaeological Society Eastern armor has a long history, beginning in Ancient China. In East Asian history laminated armor such as lamellar, and styles similar to the coat of plates, and brigandine were commonly used. Later cuirasses and plates were also used. In pre-Qin dynasty times, leather armor was made out of rhinoceros. Chinese influence in Japan would result in the Japanese adopting Chinese styles, their samurai armor being a result of this influence. Middle Ages Turkish plated mail In European history, well-known armor types include the mail hauberk of the early medieval age, and the full steel plate harness worn by later Medieval and Renaissance knights, and a few key components (breast and back plates) by heavy cavalry in several European countries until the first year of World War I (1914‚Äì15). =Plate= Gradually, small additional plates or discs of iron were added to the mail to protect vulnerable areas. By the late 13th century, the knees were capped, and two circular discs, called besagews were fitted to protect the underarms. A variety of methods for improving the protection provided by mail were used as armorers seemingly experimented. Hardened leather and splinted construction were used for arm and leg pieces. The coat of plates was developed, an armor made of large plates sewn inside a textile or leather coat. Early plate in Italy, and elsewhere in the 13th to 15th centuries were made of iron. Iron armor could be carburized or case hardened to give a surface of harder steel. Plate armor became cheaper than mail by the 15th century as it required much less labor and labor had become much more expensive after the Black Death, though it did require larger furnaces to produce larger blooms. Mail continued to be used to protect those joints which could not be adequately protected by plate, such as the armpit, crook of the elbow and groin. Another advantage of plate was that a lance rest could be fitted to the breast plate. Maratha helmet with curved back, side view The small skull cap evolved into a bigger true helmet, the bascinet, as it was lengthened downward to protect the back of the neck and the sides of the head. Additionally, several new forms of fully enclosed helmets were introduced in the late 14th century to replace the great helm, such as the sallet and barbute and later the armet and close helm. Probably the most recognized style of armor in the world became the plate armor associated with the knights of the European Late Middle Ages, but continuing to the early 17th-century Age of Enlightenment in all European countries. By about 1400 the full harness of plate armor had been developed in armories of Lombardy Heavy cavalry dominated the battlefield for centuries in part because of their armor. In the early 15th century, small \\"hand cannon\\" first began to be used, in the Hussite Wars, in combination with Wagenburg tactics, allowing infantry to defeat armored knights on the battlefield. At the same time crossbows were made more powerful to pierce armor, and the development of the Swiss Pike square formation also created substantial problems for heavy cavalry. Rather than dooming the use of body armor, the threat of small firearms intensified the use and further refinement of plate armor. There was a 150-year period in which better and more metallurgically advanced steel armor was being used, precisely because of the danger posed by the gun. Hence, guns and cavalry in plate armor were \\"threat and remedy\\" together on the battlefield for almost 400 years. By the 15th century Italian armor plates were almost always made of steel. In Southern Germany armorers began to harden their steel armor only in the late 15th century. They would continue to harden their steel for the next century because they quenched and tempered their product which allowed for the fire-gilding to be combined with tempering. The quality of the metal used in armor deteriorated as armies became bigger and armor was made thicker, necessitating breeding of larger cavalry horses. If during the 14th and 15th centuries armor seldom weighed more than 15 kg, then by the late 16th century it weighed 25 kg. The increasing weight and thickness of late 16th-century armor therefore gave substantial resistance. In the early years of pistol and arquebuses, firearms were relatively low in velocity. The full suits of armor, or breast plates actually stopped bullets fired from a modest distance. The front breast plates were, in fact, commonly shot as a test. The impact point would often be encircled with engraving to point it out. This was called the \\"proof\\". Armor often also bore an insignia of the maker, especially if it was of good quality. Crossbow bolts, if still used, would seldom penetrate good plate, nor would any bullet unless fired from close range. Renaissance/Early Modern suits of armor appropriate for heavy cavalry In effect, rather than making plate armor obsolete, the use of firearms stimulated the development of plate armor into its later stages. For most of that period, it allowed horsemen to fight while being the targets of defending arquebusiers without being easily killed. Full suits of armor were actually worn by generals and princely commanders right up to the 1710s. =Horse armor= The horse was afforded protection from lances and infantry weapons by steel plate barding. This gave the horse protection and enhanced the visual impression of a mounted knight. Late in the era, elaborate barding was used in parade armor. Gunpowder era French cuirassier of the 19th century (Drawing by √âdouard Detaille, 1885) As gunpowder weapons improved, it became cheaper and more effective to have groups of unarmored men with early guns than to have expensive knights, which caused armor to be largely discarded. Cavalry units continued to use armor. Examples include the German Reiter, Polish heavy hussars and the back and breast worn by heavy cavalry units during the Napoleonic wars. Late modern use World War I personal armour, including steel cap, steel plate vest, steel gauntlet/dagger and French splinter goggles Metal armor remained in limited use long after its general obsolescence. Soldiers in the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) bought iron and steel vests from peddlers (both sides had considered but rejected it for standard issue). The effectiveness of the vests varied widely‚Äîsome successfully deflected bullets and saved lives but others were poorly made and resulted in tragedy for the soldiers. In any case the vests were abandoned by many soldiers due to their weight on long marches as well as the stigma they got for being cowards from their fellow troops. At the start of World War I in 1914, thousands of the French Cuirassiers rode out to engage the German Cavalry who likewise used helmets and armor. By that period, the shiny armor plate was covered in dark paint and a canvas wrap covered their elaborate Napoleonic-style helmets. Their armor was meant to protect only against sabers and lances. The cavalry had to beware of high velocity rifles and machine guns like the foot soldiers, who at least had a trench to protect them.  Modern non-metallic armor  Soldiers use metal or ceramic plates in their bullet resistant vests, providing additional protection from pistol and rifle bullets. Metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from knives and bayonets. Chain mail armored gloves continue to be used by butchers and abattoir workers to prevent cuts and wounds while cutting up carcasses.  Fibers  DuPont Kevlar is well known as a component of some bullet resistant vests and bullet resistant face masks. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a key component, as do their replacements. Civilian applications include Kevlar reinforced clothing for motorcycle riders to protect against abrasion injuries. Kevlar in non-woven long strand form is used inside an outer protective cover to form chaps that loggers use while operating a chainsaw. If the moving chain contacts and tears through the outer cover, the long fibers of Kevlar tangle, clog, and stop the chain from moving as they get drawn into the workings of the drive mechanism of the saw. Kevlar is used also in emergency services protection gear if it involves high heat, e.g., tackling a fire, and Kevlar such as vests for police officers, security, and SWAT. The latest Kevlar material that DuPont has developed is Kevlar XP. In comparison with \\"normal\\" Kevlar, Kevlar XP is more light-weight and more comfortable to wear, as its quilt stitch is not required for the ballistic package. On the other hand, Twaron is similar to Kevlar. They both belong to the aramid family of synthetic fibers. The only difference is that Twaron was first developed by Akzo in the 1970s. Twaron was first commercially produced in 1986. Now, Twaron is being manufactured by Teijin Aramid. Like Kevlar, Twaron is a strong, synthetic fiber. It is also heat resistant and has many applications. It can be used in the production of several materials that include the military, construction, automotive, aerospace, and even sports market sectors. Among the examples of Twaron-made materials are body armor, helmets, ballistic vests, speaker woofers, drumheads, tires, turbo hoses, wire ropes, and cables. Another fiber used to manufacture a bullet-resistant vest is Dyneema ultra- high-molecular-weight polyethylene. Originated in the Netherlands, Dyneema has an extremely high strength-to-weight ratio (a 1-mm-diameter rope of Dyneema can bear up to a 240-kg load), is light enough (low density) that it can float on water, and has high energy absorption characteristics. Since the introduction of the Dyneema Force Multiplier Technology in 2013, many body armor manufacturers have switched to Dyneema for their high-end armor solutions. Protected areas=Shield An American police officer in October 2002 wears a helmet while equipped with a riot shield. A shield is held in the hand or arm. Its purpose is to intercept attacks, either by stopping projectiles such as arrows or by glancing a blow to the side of the shield-user, and it can also be used offensively as a bludgeoning weapon. Shields vary greatly in size, ranging from large shields that protect the user's entire body to small shields that are mostly for use in hand-to-hand combat. Shields also vary a great deal in thickness; whereas some shields were made of thick wooden planking, to protect soldiers from spears and crossbow bolts, other shields were thinner and designed mainly for glancing blows away (such as a sword blow). In prehistory, shields were made of wood, animal hide, or wicker. In antiquity and in the Middle Ages, shields were used by foot soldiers and mounted soldiers. Even after the invention of gunpowder and firearms, shields continued to be used. In the 18th century, Scottish clans continued to use small shields, and in the 19th century, some non- industrialized peoples continued to use shields. In the 20th and 21st centuries, shields are used by military and police units that specialize in anti-terrorist action, hostage rescue, and siege-breaching. Head A combat helmet is among the oldest forms of personal protective equipment, and is known to have been worn in ancient India around 1700 BC and the Assyrians around 900 BC, followed by the ancient Greeks and Romans, throughout the Middle Ages, and up to the modern era. Their materials and construction became more advanced as weapons became more and more powerful. Initially constructed from leather and brass, and then bronze and iron during the Bronze and Iron Ages, they soon came to be made entirely from forged steel in many societies after about AD 950. At that time, they were purely military equipment, protecting the head from cutting blows with swords, flying arrows, and low- velocity musketry. Some late medieval helmets, like the great bascinet, rested on the shoulders and prevented the wearer from turning his head, greatly restricting mobility. During the 18th and 19th centuries, helmets were not widely used in warfare; instead, many armies used unarmored hats that offered no protection against blade or bullet. The arrival of World War I, with its trench warfare and wide use of artillery, led to mass adoption of metal helmets once again, this time with a shape that offered mobility, a low profile, and compatibility with gas masks. Today's militaries often use high- quality helmets made of ballistic materials such as Kevlar and Twaron, which have excellent bullet and fragmentation stopping power. Some helmets also have good non-ballistic protective qualities, though many do not. The two most popular ballistic helmet models are the PASGT and the MICH. The Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) type helmet has a slightly smaller coverage at the sides which allows tactical headsets and other communication equipment. The MICH model has standard pad suspension and four-point chinstrap. The Personal Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT) helmet has been in use since 1983 and has slowly been replaced by the MICH helmet. A ballistic face mask is designed to protect the wearer from ballistic threats. Ballistic face masks are usually made of kevlar or other bullet-resistant materials and the inside of the mask may be padded for shock absorption, depending on the design. Due to weight restrictions, protection levels range only up to NIJ Level IIIA. Torso United States Navy sailors in 2007 wearing Lightweight Helmets and Modular Tactical Vests equipped with neck and groin armor A ballistic vest helps absorb the impact from firearm-fired projectiles and shrapnel from explosions, and is worn on the torso. Soft vests are made from many layers of woven or laminated fibers and can be capable of protecting the wearer from small caliber handgun and shotgun projectiles, and small fragments from explosives such as hand grenades. Metal or ceramic plates can be used with a soft vest, providing additional protection from rifle rounds, and metallic components or tightly-woven fiber layers can give soft armor resistance to stab and slash attacks from a knife or bayonet. Soft vests are commonly worn by police forces, private citizens and private security guards or bodyguards, whereas hard-plate reinforced vests are mainly worn by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams. A modern equivalent may combine a ballistic vest with other items of protective clothing, such as a combat helmet. Vests intended for police and military use may also include ballistic shoulder and side protection armor components, and explosive ordnance disposal technicians wear heavy armor and helmets with face visors and spine protection. Limbs Medieval armor often offered protection for all of the limbs, including metal boots for the lower legs, gauntlets for the hands and wrists, and greaves for the legs. Today, protection of limbs from bombs is provided by a bombsuit. Most modern soldiers sacrifice limb protection for mobility, since armor thick enough to stop bullets would greatly inhibit movement of the arms and legs. Performance standards Due to the various different types of projectiles, it is often inaccurate to refer to a particular product as \\"bulletproof\\" because this implies that it will protect against any and all projectiles. Instead, the term bullet resistant is generally preferred. Standards are regional. Around the world ammunition varies and as a result the armor testing must reflect the threats found locally. According to statistics from the US National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \\"a law enforcement officer‚Äôs job is extremely dangerous, with one officer being killed every 53 hours in the line of duty [in the United States]. Even more astounding is that this number is on the rise. In 2011, 173 officers were killed, with 68 of them being killed due to a gun-related incident.\\" While many standards exist, a few standards are widely used as models. The US National Institute of Justice ballistic and stab documents are examples of broadly-accepted standards. Since the time that NIJ started testing, the lives of more than 3,000 officers were saved. In addition to the NIJ, the United Kingdom's Home Office Scientific Development Branch (HOSDB‚Äîformerly the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB)) standards are also used by a number of other countries and organizations. These \\"model\\" standards are usually adapted by other countries by following the same basic test methodologies, while changing the specific ammunition tested. NIJ Standard-0101.06 has specific performance standards for bullet resistant vests used by law enforcement. This rates vests on the following scale against penetration and also blunt trauma protection (deformation): In the beginning of 2018, NIJ is expected to introduce the new NIJ Standard-0101.07. This new standard will completely replace the NIJ Standard-0101.06. The current system of using Roman numerals (II, IIIA, III, and IV) to indicate the level of threat will disappear and be replaced by a naming convention similar to the standard developed by UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch. HG (Hand Gun) is for soft armor and RF (Rifle) is for hard armor. Another important change is that the test-round velocity for conditioned armor will be the same as that for new armor during testing. For example, for NIJ Standard-0101.06 Level IIIA the .44 Magnum round is currently shot at 408 m/s for conditioned armor and at 436 m/s for new armor. For the NIJ Standard-0101.07, the velocity for both conditioned and new armor will be the same. In January 2012, the NIJ introduced BA 9000, body armor quality management system requirements as a quality standard not unlike ISO 9001 (and much of the standards were based on ISO 9001). In addition to the NIJ and HOSDB standards, other important standards include: the German Police's Technische Richtlinie (TR) Ballistische Schutzwesten, Draft ISO prEN ISO 14876, and Underwriters Laboratories (UL Standard 752). Textile armor is tested for both penetration resistance by bullets and for the impact energy transmitted to the wearer. The \\"backface signature\\" or transmitted impact energy is measured by shooting armor mounted in front of a backing material, typically oil-based modelling clay. The clay is used at a controlled temperature and verified for impact flow before testing. After the armor is impacted with the test bullet the vest is removed from the clay and the depth of the indentation in the clay is measured. The backface signature allowed by different test standards can be difficult to compare. Both the clay materials and the bullets used for the test are not common. In general the British, German and other European standards allow 20‚Äì25 mm of backface signature, while the US-NIJ standards allow for 44 mm, which can potentially cause internal injury. The allowable backface signature for this has been controversial from its introduction in the first NIJ test standard and the debate as to the relative importance of penetration- resistance vs. backface signature continues in the medical and testing communities. In general a vest's textile material temporarily degrades when wet. Neutral water at room temp does not affect para-aramid or UHMWPE but acidic, basic and some other solutions can permanently reduce para-aramid fiber tensile strength.Kevlar, Twaron, Dyneema, Spectra technical data (As a result of this, the major test standards call for wet testing of textile armor.NIJ, HOSDB, US-Army and ISO ballistic test methods) Mechanisms for this wet loss of performance are not known. Vests that will be tested after ISO- type water immersion tend to have heat-sealed enclosures and those that are tested under NIJ-type water spray methods tend to have water-resistant enclosures. From 2003 to 2005, a large study of the environmental degradation of Zylon armor was undertaken by the US-NIJ. This concluded that water, long- term use, and temperature exposure significantly affect tensile strength and the ballistic performance of PBO or Zylon fiber. This NIJ study on vests returned from the field demonstrated that environmental effects on Zylon resulted in ballistic failures under standard test conditions.\\"Third Status Report to the Attorney General on Safety Initiative Testing and Activities\\" Ballistic testing V50 and V0 Measuring the ballistic performance of armor is based on determining the kinetic energy of a bullet at impact. Because the energy of a bullet is a key factor in its penetrating capacity, velocity is used as the primary independent variable in ballistic testing. For most users the key measurement is the velocity at which no bullets will penetrate the armor. Measuring this zero penetration velocity (V0) must take into account variability in armor performance and test variability. Ballistic testing has a number of sources of variability: the armor, test backing materials, bullet, casing, powder, primer and the gun barrel, to name a few. Variability reduces the predictive power of a determination of V0. If for example, the V0 of an armor design is measured to be with a 9 mm FMJ bullet based on 30 shots, the test is only an estimate of the real V0 of this armor. The problem is variability. If the V0 is tested again with a second group of 30 shots on the same vest design, the result will not be identical. Only a single low velocity penetrating shot is required to reduce the V0 value. The more shots made the lower the V0 will go. In terms of statistics, the zero penetration velocity is the tail end of the distribution curve. If the variability is known and the standard deviation can be calculated, one can rigorously set the V0 at a confidence interval. Test Standards now define how many shots must be used to estimate a V0 for the armor certification. This procedure defines a confidence interval of an estimate of V0. (See \\"NIJ and HOSDB test methods\\".) V0 is difficult to measure, so a second concept has been developed in ballistic testing called V50. This is the velocity at which 50 percent of the shots go through and 50 percent are stopped by the armor. US military standardsARMY MIL-STD-662F V50 BALLISTIC TEST FOR ARMOR define a commonly used procedure for this test. The goal is to get three shots that penetrate and a second group of three shots that are stopped by the armor all within a specified velocity range. It is possible, and desirable to have a penetration velocity lower than a stop velocity. These three stops and three penetrations can then be used to calculate a V50 velocity.Army MIL-STD-662F V50 BALLISTIC TEST FOR ARMOR In practice this measurement of V50 often requires 1‚Äì2 vest panels and 10‚Äì20 shots. A very useful concept in armor testing is the offset velocity between the V0 and V50. If this offset has been measured for an armor design, then V50 data can be used to measure and estimate changes in V0. For vest manufacturing, field evaluation and life testing both V0 and V50 are used. However, as a result of the simplicity of making V50 measurements, this method is more important for control of armor after certification. = Cunniff analysis = Using dimensionless analysis, Cuniff. arrived at a relation connecting the V50 and the system parameters for textile-based body armors. Under the assumption that the energy of impact is dissipated in breaking the yarn, it was shown that : V_{50} = (U^* )^{1/3} f\\\\left(\\\\frac{A_d}{A_p}\\\\right). Here, :U^* = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma\\\\epsilon}{2\\\\rho}\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{E}{\\\\rho} :\\\\sigma,\\\\epsilon,\\\\rho,E are the failure stress, failure strain, density and elastic modulus of the yarn :A_d is the mass per unit area of the armor :A_p is the mass per unit area of the projectile Military testing After the Vietnam War, military planners developed a concept of \\"Casualty Reduction\\". The large body of casualty data made clear that in a combat situation, fragments, not bullets, were the greatest threat to soldiers. After WWII vests were being developed and fragment testing was in its early stages.Design Information for Construction of Light Personnel Armor. Authors: Willard R. Beye 1950 MIDWEST RESEARCH INST KANSAS CITY MO Artillery shells, mortar shells, aerial bombs, grenades, and antipersonnel mines are all fragmentation devices. They all contain a steel casing that is designed to burst into small steel fragments or shrapnel, when their explosive core detonates. After considerable effort measuring fragment size distribution from various NATO and Soviet Bloc munitions, a fragment test was developed. Fragment simulators were designed and the most common shape is a Right Circular Cylinder or RCC simulator. This shape has a length equal to its diameter. These RCC Fragment Simulation Projectiles (FSPs) are tested as a group. The test series most often includes 2 grain (0.13 g), 4 grain (0.263 g), 16 grain (1.0 g), and 64 grain (4.2 g) mass RCC FSP testing. The 2-4-16-64 series is based on the measured fragment size distributions. The second part of \\"Casualty Reduction\\" strategy is a study of velocity distributions of fragments from munitions.Johnson, W., Collins, C., and Kindred, F., A Mathematical Model for Predicting Residual Velocities of Fragments After Perforating Helmets, Ballistic Research Laboratories Technical Note no. 1705, October 1968 Warhead explosives have blast speeds of to . As a result, they are capable of ejecting fragments at very high speeds of over 1000 m/s (3330 ft/s), implying very high energy (where the energy of a fragment is mass √ó velocity2, neglecting rotational energy). The military engineering data showed that like the fragment size the fragment velocities had characteristic distributions. It is possible to segment the fragment output from a warhead into velocity groups. For example, 95% of all fragments from a bomb blast under have a velocity of or less. This established a set of goals for military ballistic vest design. The random nature of fragmentation required the military vest specification to trade off mass vs. ballistic-benefit. Hard vehicle armor is capable of stopping all fragments, but military personnel can only carry a limited amount of gear and equipment, so the weight of the vest is a limiting factor in vest fragment protection. The 2-4-16-64 grain series at limited velocity can be stopped by an all-textile vest of approximately 5.4 kg/m2 (1.1 lb/ft2). In contrast to the design of vest for deformable lead bullets, fragments do not change shape; they are steel and can not be deformed by textile materials. The FSP (the smallest fragment projectile commonly used in testing) is about the size of a grain of rice; such small fast moving fragments can potentially slip through the vest, moving between yarns. As a result, fabrics optimized for fragment protection are tightly woven, although these fabrics are not as effective at stopping lead bullets. By the 2010s, the development of body armor had been stymied in regards to weight, in that designers had trouble increasing the protective capability of body armor while still maintaining or decreasing its weight.https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/19oct_body_armor_page_1.html See also  * Bulletproof vest * International Medieval Combat Federation * Liquid Armor * Osprey body armour NotesReferences * External links * Museum Syndicate: Armor * Body Armor News Website ","title":"Body armor"},{"id":"1334117","text":"Phurba in the Walters Art Museum Phurba in the Asian collection of the American Museum of Natural History The kƒ´la or phurba (Sanskrit Devanagari: ‡§ï‡•Ä‡§≤; IAST: kƒ´la; , alternate transliterations and English orthographies: phurpa, phurbu, purbha, or phurpu) is a three-sided peg, stake, knife, or nail-like ritual implement traditionally associated with Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, B√∂n, and Indian Vedic traditions. The kƒ´la is associated with the practice of the yidam (Sanskrit ishtadevata, Tibetan yidam) or meditational deity Vajrakƒ´la (‡§µ‡§ú‡•ç‡§∞‡§ï‡•Ä‡§≤) or Vajrakƒ´laya (Tibetan Dorje Phurba). Etymology Most of what is known of the Indian kƒ´la lore has come by way of Tibetan culture. Scholars such as F. A. Bischoff, Charles Hartman and Martin Boord have shown that the Tibetan literature widely asserts that the Sanskrit for their term phurba is kƒ´laya (with or without the long i). However, as Boord describes it, > \\"all dictionaries and Sanskrit works agree the word to be kƒ´la (or kƒ´laka). > I suppose this [discrepancy] to result from an indiscriminate use by > Tibetans of the dative singular kƒ´laya. This form would have been familiar > to them in the simple salutation namo vajrakƒ´laya (homage to Vajrakƒ´la) from > which it could easily be assumed by those unfamiliar with the technicalities > of Sanskrit that the name of the deity is Vajrakƒ´laya instead of Vajrakƒ´la. > The term (vajra)kƒ´laya is frequently found in Sanskrit texts (as well as in > virtually every kƒ´lamantra) legitimately used as the denominative verb 'to > spike,' 'transfix,' 'nail down,' etc.\\"Boord, Martin (1993) Cult of the Deity > Vajrakila Institute of Buddhist Studies ; p. 5 Mayer (1996) contests Boord's assertion, pointing out that eminent Sanskritists such as Sakya Pandita employed Vajrakƒ´laya.A Scripture of the Ancient Tantra Collection: The Phur-pa bcu-gnyis by Robert Mayer Kindsdale Publications, 1996. pg 165 Further, he argues: > it is possible, on the other hand, that the name Vajrakƒ´laya as favoured by > the Tibetans could in fact have been the form that was actually used in the > original Indic sources, and that there is no need to hypothesize a correct > form \\"Vajrakƒ´la\\". \\"Vajrakƒ´laya\\" could have come from the second person > singular active, causative imperative, of the verb Kƒ´l.

Hence the form kƒ´laya could mean \\"you cause to bind/transfix!\\", > or \\"bind/transfix!\\".

Regarding the suggestion of Boord et al., the Sanskrit dative of kƒ´la is kƒ´lƒÅya, not kƒ´laya. Mayer's suggestion would require compounding a noun (vajra) and a nominal verb (kƒ´layati) which is not a licit formation in Sanskrit. \\"Vajra·πÉ kƒ´laya\\" is a possible expression, but that is not the form under discussion. It seems possible that the Tibetan kƒ´laya is borrowed not from Sanskrit but from a Prakrit word kƒ´laya (Skt. kƒ´laka). Fabrication and components The fabrication of kƒ´la is quite diverse. Having pommel, handle, and blade, kƒ´la are often segmented into suites of triunesTriunes that are metonymic of the ananda-chakra (Tib. gankyil; the trishula; triratna; the heavenly, earthly and hellish realms; three eyes, third eye; trimurti; trikaya; the directionality of left, middle, right and forward, stationary, backwards; past, present, future; polarities and their synthesis; upperworld or akash, middleworld or dharti and underworld or patal, etc. on both the horizontal and vertical axes, though there are notable exceptions. This compositional arrangement highlights the numerological importance and spiritual energy of the integers three (3) and nine (9). Kƒ´la may be constituted and constructed of different materials and material components, such as wood, metal, clay, bone, gems, horn or crystal. Like the majority of traditional Tibetan metal instruments, the kƒ´la is often made from brass and iron (terrestrial and/or meteoric iron. 'Thokcha' () means \\"sky-iron\\" in Tibetan and denote tektites and meteorites which are often high in iron content. Meteoric iron was highly prized throughout the Himalaya where it was included in sophisticated polymetallic alloys such as Panchaloha for ritual implements. The pommel of the kƒ´la often bears three faces of Vajrakƒ´la, one joyful, one peaceful, one wrathful, but may bear the umbrella of the ashtamangala or mushroom cap, Yidam (like Hayagriva) , snow lion, or stupa, among other possibilities. The handle is often of a vajra, weaving or knotwork design. The handle generally has a triune form as is common to the pommel and blade. The blade is usually composed of three triangular facets or faces, meeting at the tip. These represent, respectively, the blade's power to transform the negative energies known as the \\"three poisons\\" or \\"root poisons\\" (Sanskrit: mula klesha) of attachment/craving/desire, delusion/ignorance/misconception, and aversion/fear/hate. Ritual usage Cantwell and Mayer (2008) have studied a number of texts recovered from the cache of the Dunhuang manuscripts that discuss the phurba and its ritual usage.Cantwell, Cathy & Mayer, Robert (2008) Early Tibetan Documents on Phur pa from Dunhuang. Wien: Verlag der √ñsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (Accompanying disc entitled \\"Images of Dunhunag manuscripts from the Stein Collection in London\\" contains 60 JPEG-images) The kƒ´la is one of many iconographic representations of divine \\"symbolic attributes\\" (Tibetan: phyag mtshan) of VajrayanaEmbodied Nirmanakaya buddhas and sambhogakaya deities are attributed with kƒ´la. and Hindu deities. When consecrated and bound for usage,A working kƒ´la has the face(s), pommel and hilt bound (depending on the nature of the kƒ´la) with fabric [often green according to M√ºller-Ebelling, et al. (2002)] and in this binding rite Vajrakilaya is installed in the tool as a Nirmanakaya manifestation, by association the tool accesses all three realms of the Trikaya. the kƒ´la are a nirmanakaya manifestation of Vajrakƒ´laya. Chandra, et al. (1902: p. 37) in their Dictionary entry 'korkor' () \\"coiled\\" (English) relates that the text titled the 'Vaid≈´ry Ngonpo' () has the passage: ‡Ωê‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºã‡Ωï‡Ω¥‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ωñ‡ºã‡Ω£‡ºã‡ΩÄ‡Ωº‡Ω¢‡ºã‡ΩÄ‡Ωº‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ωñ‡æ±‡Ωò \\"a string was wound round the (exorcist's) dagger [phurba].\\"Das, Sarat Chandra (1902) Tibetan-English Dictionary with Sanskrit Synonyms. Calcutta: Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, p. 37 One of the principal methods of working with the and to actualize its essence-quality is to pierce the earth with it; sheath it; or as is common with Himalayan shamanic traditions, to penetrate it vertically, point down into a basket, bowl or cache of rice (or other soft grain if the kƒ´la is wooden).Herein resides the rationale why the centrality of the kƒ´la has often been overlooked by the observer and the scholar, as the kƒ´la may not be a tool ostensibly engaged in a particular rite but is actualized on the principal altar away from all the 'action'. The terms employed for the deity and the tool are interchangeable in Western scholarship. In the Himalayan shamanic tradition, the kƒ´la may be considered as axis mundi. M√ºller-Ebelling, et al. (2002) affirm that for the majority of Nepalese shaman, the kƒ´la is cognate with the world tree, either in their visualisations or in initiatory rites or other rituals. The kƒ´la is used as a ritual implement to signify stability on a prayer ground during ceremonies, and only those initiated in its use, or otherwise empowered, may wield it. The energy of the kƒ´la is fierce, wrathful, piercing, affixing, transfixing. The kƒ´la affixes the elemental process of 'Space' (Sanskrit: ƒÄkƒÅ≈õa) to the Earth, thereby establishing an energetic continuum. The kƒ´la, particularly those that are wooden are for shamanic healing, harmonizing and energy work and often have two nƒÅgasThese naga are often considered to be Nagaraja and Nagarani: the divine NƒÅga couple who rule the underworld or underwater world. (Sanskrit for snake, serpent and/or dragon, also refers to a class of supernatural entities or deities) entwined on the blade, reminiscent of the Staff of Asclepius and the Caduceus of Hermes. Kƒ´la often also bear the ashtamangala, swastika, sauwastika and/or other Himalayan, Tantric or Hindu iconography or motifs. As a tool of exorcism, the kƒ´la may be employed to hold demons or thoughtforms in place (once they have been expelled from their human hosts, for example) in order that their mindstream may be re-directed and their inherent obscurations transmuted. More esoterically, the kƒ´la may serve to bind and pin down negative energies or obscurations from the mindstream of an entity, person or thoughtform, including the thoughtform generated by a group, project and so on, to administer purification. The kƒ´la as an iconographical implement is also directly related to Vajrakilaya, a wrathful deity of Tibetan Buddhism who is often seen with his consort Diptacakra (Tib. 'khor lo rgyas 'debs ma). He is embodied in the kƒ´la as a means of destroying (in the sense of finalising and then freeing) violence, hatred, and aggression by tying them to the blade of the kƒ´la and then transmuting them with its tip. The pommel may be employed in blessings. It is therefore that the kƒ´la is not a physical weapon, but a spiritual implement, and should be regarded as such. The kƒ´la often bears the epithet Diamantine Dagger of Emptiness (see shunyata). As M√ºller-Ebeling, et al. (2002: p. 55) states: > The magic of the Magical Dagger comes from the effect that the material > object has on the realm of the spirit. The art of tantric magicians or lamas > lies in their visionary ability to comprehend the spiritual energy of the > material object and to willfully focus it in a determined direction. . .

As Beer (1999: p. 277-278) states, transfixing kƒ´la, charnel ground, scorpion and Padmasambhava: > The sting of the scorpion's whip-like tail transfixes and poisons its prey, > and in this respect it is identified with the wrathful activity of the > ritual dagger or kƒ´la.

Cultural context To work with the spirits and deities of the earth, land and place, people of India, the Himalayas and the Mongolian Steppe pegged, nailed and/or pinned down the land. The nailing of the kƒ´la is comparable to the idea of breaking the earth (turning the sod) in other traditions and the rite of laying the foundation stone. It is an ancient shamanic idea that has common currency throughout the region; it is prevalent in the B√∂n tradition and is also evident in the Vajrayana tradition. According to shamanic folklore current throughout the region, \\"...the mountains were giant pegs that kept the Earth in place and prevented it from moving.\\" (Kerrigan, et al., 1998: p27) Mountains such as Amnye Machen, according to folklore were held to have been brought from other lands just for this purpose. Stupa (compare cairn) are a development of this tradition and akin to kƒ´la. (Kerrigan, et al., 1998: p27) states that: > \\"Prayer flags and stone pillars throughout the country also pierce the land. > Even the pegs of the nomads‚Äô yak wool tents are thought of as sanctifying > the ground that lies beneath...\\". Traditions such as that of the kƒ´la may be considered a human cultural universal in light of foundation stone rites and other comparable rites documented in the disciplines of anthropology and ethnography; e.g., turning of the soil as a placation and votive offering to spirits of place and to preparation of the land as a rite to ensure fertility and bountiful yield. Traditional lineage usage: anthology of case studies In the Kathmandu Valley, the kƒ´la is still in usage by shamans, magicians, tantrikas and lamas of different ethnic backgrounds. The kƒ´la is used particularly intensively by the Tamang, Gurung and Newari Tibeto-Burmese tribes. The kƒ´la is also employed by the Tibetans native to Nepal (the Bhotyas), the Sherpas, and the Tibetans living in Dharamasala. M√ºller-Ebelling, et al. (2002: p. 29) chart the difference of the traditions between the jhankrisJhankris may be understood as individuals who have a 'calling' to work with the kƒ´la and are mostly of non- hereditary lineages of kƒ´la workers. and the gubajus:Gubajus may be understood as the priests, astrologers and healers amongst the Newari people of the Kathmandu Valley. Their purba traditions are of hereditary lineages which may be considered castes. > The phurbas of the gubajus are different from those of the jhankris. As a > rule, they have only one head on which there is a double vajra as shown > here. Gubajus focus on the head as a mirror image of themselves in order to > meditatively connect with the power of the phurba. The three or more heads > of the upper area of the phurba indicate the collection of energies that the > jhankris use. A \\"Bhairab kƒ´la\\" is an important healing tool of the tantric Newari gubajus. As M√ºller-Ebelling, et al. (2002: p. 55) state: > Tantric priests (guruju) use Bhairab phurbas for the curing of disease and > especially for curing children's diseases. For these cases the point of the > phurba blade is dipped into a glass or a bowl of water, turned and stirred. > The sick child is then given the magically charged water as medicine to > drink. M√ºller-Ebelling, et al. (2002: p. ?) interviewed Mohan Rai, a shaman from the border area of Nepal and Bhutan and belongs to the Mongolian people of the Rai and/or Kirati. Mohan Rai is the founder of the Shamanistic Studies and Research Centre, Baniya Goun, Naikap, Kathmandu, Nepal)(accessed: Monday, February 26, 2007) In interview Rai says: > 'Without the phurba inside himself, the shaman has no consciousness'...'The > shaman himself is the phurba; he assumes its form in order to fly into other > worlds and realities.' Therefore, the kƒ´la is identified with consciousness and the root of sentience, the buddha-nature. M√ºller-Ebelling et al. (2002) affirm that some Kukri may be considered kƒ´la, as ultimately, everything that approximates a vertical form. The kƒ´la then is a phallic polysemy and cognate with lingam ~ the generative instrument of Shiva that is metonymic of the primordial energy of the Universe. The kƒ´la as lingam, actualizes the yoni essence-quality of whatever it penetrates. The wrathful heruka Vajrakilaya is a Tibetan buddhist yidam or meditational deity who embodies the energetic 'activity' (Wylie: phrin las) of all the buddhas, manifesting in a powerful and wrathful yet compassionate form in order to subjugate the delusion and negativity that can arise as obstacles to the practice of Dharma. Vajrakƒ´la (Vajrakƒ´laya) Vajrakila. Lama Temple, Beijing Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche on the practice of Vajrakilaya states that: > \\"Vajrakilaya, or kƒ´la, means something sharp, and something that pierces ‚Äì a > dagger. A dagger that is so sharp it can pierce anything, while at the same > time nothing can pierce it. That is the quality. This sharp and piercing > energy is what is used to practice and out of the many infinite, endless > Vajrayana methods this happens to be one of most important methods.\\" As deity Vajrakilaya Vajrakilaya is a significant Vajrayana deity who transmutes and transcends obstacles and obscurations. Vajrakila is the divine 'thoughtform' () that governs the kƒ´la. Padmasambhava achieved realisation through practicing 'Yangdag Heruka' (Tibetan: yang dag he ru ka) but only after combining it with the practice of Vajrakilaya to clean and clear obstacles and obscurations. Vajrakilaya is also understood as the embodiment of activities of the Buddha mind. Sometimes, Vajrakilaya is perceived as the wrathful vajrayana form of Vajrapani, according to Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Many great masters both in India and Tibet, but especially in Tibet, have practiced Vajrakilaya (especially in the Nyingma lineage, and among the Kagyu and also within the Sakyapas). The Sakyapa's main deity, besides Hevajra is Vajrakumara or Vajrakilaya. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche and a significant number of lamas within the Kagyu and Nyingma engaged Vajrakilaya sadhana. Iconography Vajrakilaya (also known as Vajrakumara) is the deity of the magic thundernail, the kƒ´la, a tool of the sharp adamantine point of dharmakaya, a wisdom forced through the power of one-pointed concentration. This 'one-pointed' (Sanskrit: eka graha) focus is a concerted mindfulness on the unity and interdependence of all dharmas. This one-pointed focus is understood as 'applying oneself fully' (Tibetan: sgrim pa). The three pointed blade represents delusion, attachment and aversion transformation. Vajrakilaya is a tantric deity whose practice is particularly embraced by the Nyingmapa school of Tibetan buddhism. The wrathful manifestation of this deity is seen as assisting practitioners in clearing the obstructions to realisation. A common manifestation of Vajrakilla has three heads, six arms, and four legs. Vajrakilaya's three right hands except for the right front one held vajras with five and nine prongs. The right front one makes a mudra as granting boons with open palm. Vajrakilaya's three left hands hold a flaming triple wishfulfilling jewel or triratna, a trident and the kilaya. Vajrakilaya's back is covered by the freshly flayed skin of the elephant representing 'ignorance' (Sanskrit: avidya; Wylie: marigpa), with the legs tied in front. A human skin is tied diagonally across his chest with the hands lying flat on Vajrakilaya's stomach and solar plexus representing the flailed ego that has released its powerful grip obscuring the 'qualities' of the Sadhaka.Three vajra: Body (Head), Voice (Throat), Mind (Heart), Qualities (solar plexus), Activities (secret place). Qualities are represented iconographically by the 'vortex' (Sanrkit: chakra; Wylie: Khorlo) of the Manipura (Sanskrit: Ma·πáip≈´ra). A rope ripples over his body with severed heads hanging by their hair representing the Akshamala or 'garland of bija' (Sanskrit: Varnamala). A knee length loin cloth winds around his belly belted with a tiger skin complete with tail, claws and head. This deity wears manifold nƒÅga adornments and jewellery: naga earrings, naga bracelets, naga anklets and a naga cord over his chest, sometimes referred to as a naga gurdle and a naga hairpiece or hair ornament. Vajrakilaya's faces are round and small compared to the tall body. Despite the large fangs and bulging eyes and his wrathful appearance, Vajrakilaya is perceived as having a benevolent demeanor. History of Vajrakilaya practice in India and Tibet Although at one point the Indic origin of kƒ´la practice was widely questioned, Boord claims that \\"the existence of a Kƒ´la cult among the Buddhists in eighth century India...must now surely be accepted as established\\"Boord, Martin (1993) Cult of the Deity Vajrakila Institute of Buddhist Studies ; p. 107 and further claims that it has been \\"conclusively demonstrated that all the basic doctrines and rituals of Vajrakƒ´la had their origin in India.\\"Boord, Martin (1993) Cult of the Deity Vajrakila Institute of Buddhist Studies ; p. 223 Robert Mayer, one of the leading scholars of the kƒ´la literature, shares the same view, writing that prior research had been plagued by \\"elementary misunderstandings\\" based on a lack of familiarity with crucial Indic primary sources.A Scripture of the Ancient Tantra Collection: The Phur-pa bcu-gnyis by Robert Mayer Kindsdale Publications, 1996. pg 103 Mayer says of Boord's work, \\"our understandings of the deity are quite similar\\" insofar as both do not doubt that \\"the phur-pa and the deity are Indic.\\" Tibetan tradition, which Boord credits as generally credible, holds that the entire corpus of Indian kƒ´la lore was systematized by Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, and the Nepali ≈öƒ´lama√±ju, while on retreat together at Yang-le-shod (present-day Pharping, Nepal). According to Boord, \\"it was precisely during this retreat that the many strands of kila lore were finally woven together into a coherent masterpiece of tantric Buddhism and thus it helps to illuminate the process by which tantric methods were being related to soteriology at this time. Beautifully codified in terms of both theory and practice, this divine scheme of meditation and magic was subsequently transmitted to Tibet and became established there as one of the major modes of religious engagement. So much so, in fact, that many previous writers on Tibet have actually assumed the kila cult to be of Tibetan origin.\\"A Bolt of Lightning From The Blue by Martin J. Boord. Edition Khordong, 2002. pg xiii Renowned Tibetologist and Buddhologist Herbert Guenther concurred in a review of Boord's work, concluding that his \\"careful research of all available texts relevant to the study of this figure\\" was \\"much needed and long overdue\\" in correcting longstanding \\"misrepresentation of historical facts.\\"Review of the Cult of the Deity Vajrakila by Herbert Guenther. Journal of the American Oriental Society 117.3 (1997) pgs 620-621 Beer (1999: p. 246) conveys the entwined relationship of Vajrakilaya with Samye, the propagation of Secret Mantra in Tibet, and the importance of the sadhana to both Padmasambhava's enlightenment, and his twenty-five 'heart disciples', who are of the mindstreams of the principal terton (according to Nyingma tradition): > In the biography of Padmasambhava it is recorded that he travelled to the > northern land of Kashakamala, where the cult of the kƒ´la prevailed.

For instance, there are treasure teachings from Jigme Lingpa, Ratna Lingpa and Nyang-rel Nyima Ozer.

Vajrakilaya Puja was received by Kh√∂n Nagendra Rakshita and his younger sibling Vajra Ratna from Padmasambhava.

It was proposed in 2003 by Wojciech Zurek and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout. The development of the theory is due to the integration of a number of Zurek's research topics pursued over the course of twenty-five years including: pointer states, einselection and decoherence. A study in 2010 is claimed to provide preliminary supporting evidence of quantum Darwinism with scars of a quantum dot \\"becoming a family of mother-daughter states\\" indicating they could \\"stabilize into multiple pointer states.\\" However, the claimed evidence is also subject to the circularity criticism by Kastner (see Implications below). Basically, the de facto phenomenon of decoherence that underlies the claims of Quantum Darwinism may not really arise in a unitary-only dynamics. Thus, even if there is decoherence, this does not show that macroscopic pointer states naturally emerge without some form of collapse.  Implications  Along with Zurek's related theory of envariance (invariance due to quantum entanglement), quantum Darwinism seeks to explain how the classical world emerges from the quantum world and proposes to answer the quantum measurement problem, the main interpretational challenge for quantum theory. The measurement problem arises because the quantum state vector, the source of all knowledge concerning quantum systems, evolves according to the Schr√∂dinger equation into a linear superposition of different states, predicting paradoxical situations such as ‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger's cat‚Äù; situations never experienced in our classical world. Quantum theory has traditionally treated this problem as being resolved by a non-unitary transformation of the state vector at the time of measurement into a definite state. It provides an extremely accurate means of predicting the value of the definite state that will be measured in the form of a probability for each possible measurement value. The physical nature of the transition from the quantum superposition of states to the definite classical state measured is not explained by the traditional theory but is usually assumed as an axiom and was at the basis of the debate between Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein concerning the completeness of quantum theory. Quantum Darwinism seeks to explain the transition of quantum systems from the vast potentiality of superposed states to the greatly reduced set of pointer states as a selection process, einselection, imposed on the quantum system through its continuous interactions with the environment. All quantum interactions, including measurements, but much more typically interactions with the environment such as with the sea of photons in which all quantum systems are immersed, lead to decoherence or the manifestation of the quantum system in a particular basis dictated by the nature of the interaction in which the quantum system is involved. In the case of interactions with its environment Zurek and his collaborators have shown that a preferred basis into which a quantum system will decohere is the pointer basis underlying predictable classical states. It is in this sense that the pointer states of classical reality are selected from quantum reality and exist in the macroscopic realm in a state able to undergo further evolution. However, the 'einselection' program depends on assuming a particular division of the universal quantum state into 'system' + 'environment', with the different degrees of freedom of the environment posited as having mutually random phases. This phase randomness does not arise from within the quantum state of the universe on its own, and Kastner has pointed out that this limits the explanatory power of the Quantum Darwinism program. Zurek replies to Kastner's criticism in Zurek As a quantum system‚Äôs interactions with its environment results in the recording of many redundant copies of information regarding its pointer states, this information is available to numerous observers able to achieve consensual agreement concerning their information of the quantum state. This aspect of einselection, called by Zurek ‚ÄòEnvironment as a Witness‚Äô, results in the potential for objective knowledge.  Darwinian significance  Perhaps of equal significance to the light this theory shines on quantum explanations is its identification of a Darwinian process operating as the selective mechanism establishing our classical reality. As numerous researchers have made clear any system employing a Darwinian process will evolve. As argued by the thesis of Universal Darwinism, Darwinian processes are not confined to biology but are all following the simple Darwinian algorithm: # Reproduction/Heredity; the ability to make copies and thereby produce descendants. # Selection; A process that preferentially selects one trait over another trait, leading to one trait being more numerous after sufficient generations. # Variation; differences in heritable traits that affect \\"Fitness‚Äù or the ability to survive and reproduce leading to differential survival. Quantum Darwinism appears to conform to this algorithm and thus is aptly named: # Numerous copies are made of pointer states # Pointer states evolve in a continuous, predictable manner, that is descendants inherit many of their traits from ancestor states. # Successive interactions between pointer states and their environment reveal them to evolve and those states to survive which conform to the predictions of classical physics within the macroscopic world. # The analogy to the Variation principle of \\"simple Darwinism\\" does not exist since the Pointer states do not mutate and the selection by the environment is among the pointer states preferred by the environment (e.g. location states). From this view quantum Darwinism provides a Darwinian explanation at the basis of our reality, explaining the unfolding or evolution of our classical macroscopic world. NotesReferences * S.

Most notably, the posadnik (equivalent to a stadtholder, burgomeister, or podest√† in the medieval west) was the mayor of Novgorod and Pskov. The term comes from the Old Church Slavic \\"posaditi,\\" meaning to put or place; they were so-called because the prince in Kiev originally placed them in the city to rule on his behalf. Beginning in the 12th century, they were elected locally. Novgorod Despite legends of posadniks such as Gostomysl that were set in the 9th century, the term posadnik first appeared in the Primary Chronicle under the year 997. The earliest Novgorodian posadniks include Dobrynya (an uncle of Vladimir the Great), his son Konstantin Dobrynich and Ostromir, who is famous for patronizing the Ostromir Gospels, among the first books published in Russia (it is now housed in the National Library of Russia in St. Petersburg). Also mention in a document from year 1189 referenced in SDHK 44456. In the Novgorod Republic, the city posadnik was elected from among the boyars by the veche (public assembly). The elections were held annually. Novgorod boyars differed from boyars in other Rus' lands in that the category was not caste- like and that every rich merchant could reasonably hope to reach the rank of boyar. Valentin Yanin, the Soviet \\"dean\\" of medieval Novgorodian history, has found that most posadniks held the office consecutively for sometimes a decade or more and then often passed the office on to their sons or another close relative, indicating that the office was held within boyar clans and that the elections were not really \\"free and fair.\\"Valentin Lavrent'evich Yanin, Novgorodskie Posadniki (Moscow: Moscow State University, 1962; reprinted Moscow: Iazyki Russkoi kultury, 2003). Yanin's theory challenged historians' understanding of the Novgorod Republic, showing it to be a boyar republic with little or no democratic elements. It also showed the land-owning boyarstvo to be more powerful than the merchant and artisan classes, which until that time were thought to play a significant role in the political life of the city. It also called into question the true nature of the veche, which up until that time had been considered democratic by most scholars. Yanin's interpretation of the Novgorod government as an hereditary oligarchy is not universally accepted, however. Originally there was one posadnik, but gradually over time the office multiplied until, by the end of the Republic, there were something like 24 posadniks. There were also posadniks for each of the city's boroughs (called ends - \\"kontsy\\", singular \\"konets\\" in Russian). The multiplication of the office dates to the 1350s, when Posadnik Ontsifor Lukinich implemented a series of reforms.Yanin, Novgorodskie Posadniki, 262-287. Retired posadniks took the title \\"old posadnik\\", or —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã–π –ø–æ—Å–∞–¥–Ω–∏–∫) and the current, serving posadnik was known as the \\"stepennyi\\" posadnik (—Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ—Å–∞–¥–Ω–∏–∫). In accordance with the reform of 1416-1417, the number of posadniks was increased threefold and stepennyi posadniks were to be elected for a six-month period. In this manner, the various boyar clans could share power and one or another of them would neither monopolize power or be left out if they lost an election. It, however, diluted power in the boyarstvo. Some scholars have argued that the Archbishop of Novgorod became the head of the Republic and stood above the fray of partisan politics that raged among the boyardom, but the archbishops seem to have shared power with the boyardom and the collective leadership tried to rule by consensus. Michael C. Paul, \\"Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest,\\" Kritika 8, No. 2 (Spr. 2007): 231-270. The dilution of boyar power may, however, have weakened Novgorod in the 15th century, thus explaining the series of defeats it suffered at Moscow's hands and the eventual fall of independent Novgorod. The posadnikdom (mayoralty) was abolished along with the veche when Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow took the city in 1478. In fact, upon being asked by Archbishop Feofil (1470-1480) on behalf of the Novgorodians what type of government he wanted, Ivan (speaking through Prince Patrikeev) told them \\"there will be no veche bell in our patrimony of Novgorod; there will be no posadnik, and we will conduct our own government.\\"Moskovskii Letopisnii svod, Vol. 25 in Polnoe Sobranie Russkikh Letopisei(Moscow ANSSSR, 1949, p. 146 (emphasis added). See also Paul, \\"Secular Power and the Archbishops of Novgorod Before the Muscovite Conquest,\\" 267.

Early life and World War II  Born in the village of Apiranthos, Naxos, Glezos moved to Athens in 1935 together with his family, where he finished high school. During his high school years in Athens, he also worked as a pharmacy employee. He was admitted to the Higher School of Economic and Commercial Studies (known today as the Athens University of Economics and Business) in 1940. In 1939, still a high school student, Glezos participated in the creation of an anti-fascist youth group against the Italian occupation of the Dodecanese and the dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas. At the onset of World War II, he volunteered to join the Greek army in the Albanian front against Italy but was rejected because he was underage. Instead, he worked as a volunteer for the Hellenic Ministry of Economics. During the Axis occupation of Greece, he worked for the Hellenic Red Cross and the municipality of Athens, while actively involved in the resistance. The swastika on the Acropolis, May 1941According to popular tradition, on 27 April 1941 Konstantinos Koukidis was ordered to lower the Greek flag, and raise the Nazi swastika flag. Koukidis allegedly lowered the flag and jumped from the Acropolis holding it, rather than raise the Nazi flag. On 30 May 1941 Glezos and Apostolos Santas climbed on the Acropolis and tore down the swastika, which had been there since 27 April 1941, when the Nazi forces had entered Athens. It inspired not only the Greeks, but all subjected people, to resist the occupation, and established them both as two international anti-Nazi heroes. Hours later, the Nazi regime sentenced the perpetrators to death, but they were not identified until much later. Glezos was arrested by the German occupation forces on 24 March 1942, imprisoned, and tortured. As a result of his treatment, he was affected by tuberculosis. Glezos was arrested again on 21 April 1943 by the Italian occupation forces and spent three months in jail. In 1944, he was imprisoned by Greek collaborators and beaten for trying to escape.  Career and political activism = Post-war period  Soviet postage stamp. The end of World War II was not the end of Glezos' plight. On 3 March 1948, in the midst of the Greek Civil War, he was put to trial for his political convictions and sentenced to death multiple times by the national government. His death penalties were reduced to a life sentence in 1950. Even though he was still imprisoned, Manolis Glezos was elected member of the Hellenic Parliament in 1951, under the flag of the United Democratic Left, also known as EDA (). Upon his election, he went on a hunger strike demanding the release of his fellow EDA MPs that were imprisoned or exiled in the Greek islands. He ended his hunger strike upon the release of 7 MPs from their exile. He was released from prison on 16 July 1954. On 5 December 1958, he was arrested again and convicted of espionage, which was the common pretext for the persecution of the supporters of the left during the Cold War. The Soviet Union reacted circulating a postage stamp with Glezos, while the Greek government responded with a postage stamp depicting Imre Nagy. His release on 15 December 1962 was a result of the public outcry in Greece and abroad, including winning the Lenin Peace Prize. During his second term of post-war political imprisonment, Glezos was reelected MP with EDA in 1961. At the coup d'√©tat of 21 April 1967, Glezos was arrested at 2 am, together with the rest of the political leaders. During the Regime of the Colonels, the military dictatorship led by George Papadopoulos, he was imprisoned and exiled until his release in 1971. Manolis Glezos' sentences, from the Second World War to the Greek Civil War and the Regime of the Colonels total 11 years and 4 months of imprisonment, and 4 years and 6 months of exile.  Since 1974  After the restoration of democracy in Greece in 1974, Glezos participated in the reviving of EDA. In the elections of October 1981 and June 1985, he was elected Member of the Greek Parliament, on a Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) ticket. In 1984 he was elected Member of the European Parliament, again on a PASOK ticket. He was the President of EDA from 1985 until 1989. In the meantime, in 1986, he withdrew from the Parliament, in order to try to implement a grassroots democracy experiment. He did so in the community of Aperathu, where he was elected as the President of the Community Council in 1986 elections. He then essentially abolished the privileges of the council, introducing a \\"constitution\\" and establishing a local assembly that had total control over the community administration. This model worked for several years, but in the long term the interest of the rest of his community wore off and the assembly was abandoned. Glezos remained the President until 1989. In the 2000 Greek legislative election he led the list of Synaspismos (in English Coalition) party of the radical left. In 2002, he formed the political group Active Citizens (which is part of Coalition of the Radical Left, an alliance with Synaspismos and other minor parties of the Greek left) and he ran as a candidate prefect for Attica. In March 2010, Glezos was participating in a protest demonstration in Athens, when he was hit in the face by a police tear gas canister. He was carried away injured. In February 2012, Glezos was arrested by riot police while protesting in Athens. He was sprayed with tear gas by one of the police officers in that area. In the June 2012 parliamentary election, Glezos was elected as MP of the Coalition of Radical Left (SYRIZA) party. Glezos was a SYRIZA candidate for the European Parliament in the elections of 25 May 2014. He was elected to the European Parliament with over 430,000 votes, more than any other candidate in Greece. At age 91, he was also the oldest person elected to the European Parliament in the 2014 election.\\"Meet the new faces ready to sweep into the European parliament\\", The Guardian, 26 May 2014.\\"ŒïœÖœÅœâŒµŒ∫ŒªŒøŒ≥Œ≠œÇ: Œ†œÅœéœÑŒøœÇ œÉŒµ œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœçœÇ Œø ŒìŒªŒ≠Œ∂ŒøœÇ\\", Eleftherotypia, 1 June 2014. In 2015, Glezos took a firm stance in favour of the \\"No\\" vote in the Greek bailout referendum. As an MEP he also participated in a support protest in Brussels, along with thousands of Belgians RT video: \\"Thousands of Belgians support Greek OHI (No)\\" (03/07/2015) in favour of Greeks voting negatively in the referendum, a few days before the latter takes place. Solidarity protest in Brussels (03/07/2015). See video He resigned from his position in the European Parliament in July 2015, being succeeded by Nikolaos Chountis. The same year, he left SYRIZA before the September 2015 Greek election, where he was an MP candidate with the newly-formed Popular Unity party. In 2018, Manolis Glezos publicly voiced his opposition to the Prespa Agreement between Athens and Skopje on the resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute -despite the agreement being promoted by the SYRIZA government party which he formerly supported. In an article for the Greek daily paper Kathimerini, he insisted that the people of the neighbouring country should \\"define themselves in accordance with their history, language, traditions... taking out of their mind the word Macedonia\\". Greek City Times, Resistance icon Glezos to Skopje: \\"Take out of your mind the word Macedonia\\".  Non- political career  Apart from his political work, Glezos invented a system to prevent floods, combat erosion and preserve underground water, that works by the constructions of a series of very small dams that redirect water to aquifers. For his contributions to democracy, to geological sciences, and to linguistics he was pronounced honorary Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Patras (Department of Geology) in 1996, of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Department of Civil Engineering) in 2001, of the National Technical University of Athens (School of Mining & Metallurgical Engineering) in 2003, and of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (School of Philosophy) in 2008. Death On 30 March 2020, Glezos died of heart failure, at the age of 97. Alexis Tsipras said, \\"He will remain for all eternity the symbol of a fighter who knew how to sacrifice himself for people.\\"  Publications  Glezos wrote articles in Greek newspapers since 1942 and was the editor of the newspapers Rizospastis and I Avgi in the 1950s. He was awarded the International Award of Journalism in 1958, the Golden Medal Joliot-Curie of the World Peace Council in 1959, and the Lenin Peace Prize in 1963.

Thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, mounted on a textile backing somewhat in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. So treated, thangkas can last a long time, but because of their delicate nature, they have to be kept in dry places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Most thangkas are relatively small, comparable in size to a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these were designed to be displayed, typically for very brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. Most thangkas were intended for personal meditation or instruction of monastic students. They often have elaborate compositions including many very small figures. A central deity is often surrounded by other identified figures in a symmetrical composition. Narrative scenes are less common, but do appear. Thangka serve as important teaching tools depicting the life of the Buddha, various influential lamas and other deities and bodhisattvas. One subject is The Wheel of Life (Bhavachakra), which is a visual representation of the Abhidharma teachings (Art of Enlightenment). The term may sometimes be used of works in other media than painting, including reliefs in metal and woodblock prints. Today printed reproductions at poster size of painted thangka are commonly used for devotional as well as decorative purposes. Many tangkas were produced in sets, though they have often subsequently become separated. Thangka perform several different functions. Images of deities can be used as teaching tools when depicting the life (or lives) of the Buddha, describing historical events concerning important Lamas, or retelling myths associated with other deities. Devotional images act as the centerpiece during a ritual or ceremony and are often used as mediums through which one can offer prayers or make requests. Overall, and perhaps most importantly, religious art is used as a meditation tool to help bring one further down the path to enlightenment. The Buddhist Vajrayana practitioner uses a thanka image of their yidam, or meditation deity, as a guide, by visualizing \\"themselves as being that deity, thereby internalizing the Buddha qualities\\"Lipton, Ragnubs tangkas hang on or beside altars, and may be hung in the bedrooms or offices of monks and other devotees. History Tibetan Buddhist painting developed from widespread traditions of early Buddhist paintings which now only survive in a few sites such as the Ajanta Caves in India and the Mogao Caves on the Silk Road, which has very extensive wall-paintings and was the repository for what are now the earliest surviving Tibetan paintings on cloth. The thanka form developed alongside the tradition of Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings, which are or were mostly in monasteries. The early history of the form is more easily traced through these murals, which survive in greater numbers than the portable paintings which certainly once existed.Kossak and Singer, 11-12 Most thanka were commissioned by individuals, who were believed to acquire merit by doing so. They might then be given to a monastery or another individual, or retained for use by the commissioner. Some thangka have inscriptions on their back recording that they were the personal meditation image (thugs dam) of a notable monk.For example Kossak and Singer, #20 Most artists were probably monks, although lay artists seem to have existed, as they did for metalwork sculpture. The commissioner would provide the materials, which were often valuable, and by tradition the compensation to the artist was regarded as a \\"gift\\" rather than a fee.Rhie, in Rhie and Thurman, 41-42 The word \\"thangka\\" means \\"thing that one unrolls\\" in Classical Tibetan.B√©guin, Gilles, in Rhie and Thurman, 386 Thangka are very rarely signed, but some artists are known, more because they were important monastic leaders than famous as artists. Painting was a valued accomplishment in a monk.Kossak and Singer, 16 The earliest survivals of Tibetan paintings on cloth are in some pieces from the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang on the Silk Road, in Gansu province, China. The \\"Library Cave\\" there was a repository of old or worn out manuscripts, paintings, prints, textiles and other items which was sealed off in the 11th century, after several centuries of deposits. Many of the paintings have Tibetan inscriptions or are in a style that can be recognized as Tibetan, as opposed to the dominant Han Chinese style and some pieces reflecting Indian styles.B√©guin, Gilles, in Rhie and Thurman, 385; Rhie, in Rhie and Thurman, 41‚Äì42, 122 Though they are hard to date, it is thought that these pieces mainly come from a period c. 781‚Äì848 during Tang Dynasty rule.Rhie and Thurman, 122; Kossak and Singer, 3‚Äì5 Surviving tangkas on cloth certainly from Tibet itself start in the 11th century, after the revival of Buddhism; there are some 20 surviving from this and the 12th century.Kossak and Singer, 15 Such early examples typically have compositions that are already complex, but less so than in later examples. As later the typical compositions shows a central figure flanked by smaller other figures, often in framed compartments, or surrounded by flaming halos or seated on small clouds. Behind these figures a landscape background including much sky is often indicated, though little of it may be visible. The central figure may be a deity, and arhat, or an important monk, and the same groups make up the background figures. Several of the figures may be different \\"aspects\\" or reincarnations of each other according to Buddhist theology. In the example at left the flanking bodhisattvas are in a style, one of several found in such figures in this period, that appears derived from central Indian art.Rhie and Thurman, 47-49 Over the following centuries Tibetan painting, both on walls and thangka, continued to develop in its distinctive style, balancing between the two major influences of Indo-Nepalese and Han Chinese painting, despite Buddhism being on the general decline in these regions. Styles could vary considerably between the different regions of Tibet as well as the wider region where tangkas were painted. Within Tibet the regions nearer Nepal and the rest of China were often more influenced by regional styles. Bhutanese tangkas were mainly influenced by Central Tibet. The different monastic orders also developed somewhat different stylistic characters. Tibetan painting incorporated many elements from Han Chinese painting, especially from the 14th century onwards, reaching a peak in the 18th century. One aspect of this was allowing more space and emphasis to the landscape background. In general the style of figures in thangka remains derived from the Indo-Nepalese tradition.Rhie and Thurman, 52-65McKay, Alex. The History of Tibet. Routledge. 2003. p. 596-597. According to Giuseppe Tucci, by the time of the Qing dynasty, \\"a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity.\\" Since the Yuan dynasty, Tibet was administered as a part of China, but when the Qing dynasty came to power court interest in Tibetan Buddhism increased, and many refined and elegant works were produced by Imperial artists and sent to Tibet, influencing local styles. As well as the court style, there was influence from the regions of China near Tibet.Rhie and Thurman,64-65 Tangkas were painted in all the areas where Tibetan Buddhism flourished, which apart from those mentioned already included Mongolia, Ladakh, Sikkim, and parts of Himalayan India in Arunachal Pradesh, Dharamshala, and Lahaul and Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh. It is also practiced in parts of Russia (Kalmykia, Buryatia, and Tuva) and Northeast China. Other traditions of Buddhist scroll paintings are not usually covered by the term thangka, although they may have many similarities, and descend from the same origins. An example is Japanese painting, where a number of very early examples survive from the Nara (710-794) and Heian periods (794 to 1185). Most of these are National Treasures of Japan. Raig≈ç-zu developed as one popular genre, showing the Amida Buddha accompanied by bodhisattvas welcoming the souls of the faithful to his Western Paradise. These were, and still are, carried into the house of a person who was near death. Types Based on technique and material, tangkas can be grouped by types. Generally, they are divided into two broad categories: those that are painted (Tib.) bris-tan--and those made of silk, either by appliqu√© or embroidery. Tangkas are further divided into these more specific categories: * Painted in colours (Tib.) tson-tang‚Äîthe most common type * Appliqu√© (Tib.) go-tang * Black Background‚Äîmeaning gold line on a black background (Tib.) nagtang * Blockprints‚Äîpaper or cloth outlined renderings, by woodcut/woodblock printing * Embroidery (Tib.) tsem-thang * Gold Background‚Äîan auspicious treatment, used judiciously for peaceful, long-life deities and fully enlightened buddhas * Red Background‚Äîliterally gold line, but referring to gold line on a vermillion (Tib.) mar-tang Whereas typical tangkas are fairly small, with painted area between about 20 to 50 centimetres high, there are also giant festival tangkas, usually appliqu√©, and designed to be unrolled against a wall in a monastery for particular religious occasions. These are likely to be wider than they are tall, and may be sixty or more feet across and perhaps twenty or more high. In Bhutan at least these are called thongdrels. There are also larger than average thankas that were designed for altars or display in temples. Somewhat related are Tibetan tsakli, cards which look like miniature tangkas perhaps up to 15 centimetres high, and often square, usually containing a single figure. These were mostly produced in sets and were usually used in earlier stages of training monks, or as initiation cards or offerings, or to use when constructing temporary mandalas. Another related form is the painted wooden top cover for a manuscript book, giving a long narrow strip, typically some 6 cm by 55 cm, often painted with a row of seated figures in compartments. The techniques for both these forms are essentially the same as for thangka, and presumably the same artists worked on them. Because tangkas can be quite expensive, people nowadays use posters of tangkas as an alternative to the real tangkas for religious purposes. Sources on Asian art often describe all-textile tangkas as \\"tapestry\\", but tangkas that meet the normal definition of tapestry with the image created only by weaving a single piece of fabric with different colours of thread are extremely rare, though a few tapestry examples in the Chinese kesi technique are known, mostly from the medieval period. There is a large example in the Hermitage Museum, although in this and other pieces the different colours are woven separately and then sewn together in a type of patchwork.Rhie and Thurman, 126-127 Most thangka described as tapestry are some combination of embroidery, appliqu√© and other techniques. Process Tangkas are painted on cotton or silk. The most common is a loosely woven cotton produced in widths from 40 to 58 cm (16 - 23 inches). While some variations do exist, tangkas wider than 45 cm (17 or 18 inches) frequently have seams in the support. The paint consists of pigments in a water-soluble medium of animal glue. Both mineral and organic pigments are used. In Western terminology, this is a distemper technique; although it is often described as a form of gouache, this is incorrect, and the paint was applied as a warm liquid, mixed shortly before application.Kossak and Singer, 196-199 In Nepal, 24 carat gold is also plated over some parts of Thangkas painting which makes the art a little more expensive. Most old thangka have inscriptions on the back, usually the mantra of the deity depicted, but sometimes also information as to later owners, though rarely information about the original commissioner or artist. Sometimes x-rays allow pious inscriptions placed under the paint on the front of the image to be seen. Inscriptions may be made in the shape of a stupa, or sometimes other shapes.Kossak and Singer, 205 The composition of a thangka, as with the majority of Buddhist art, is highly geometric. Arms, legs, eyes, nostrils, ears, and various ritual implements are all laid out on a systematic grid of angles and intersecting lines. A skilled thangka artist will generally select from a variety of predesigned items to include in the composition, ranging from alms bowls and animals, to the shape, size, and angle of a figure's eyes, nose, and lips. The process seems very methodical, but often requires deep understanding of the symbolism involved to capture the spirit of it. Thangka often overflow with symbolism and allusion. Because the art is explicitly religious, all symbols and allusions must be in accordance with strict guidelines laid out in Buddhist scripture. The artist must be properly trained and have sufficient religious understanding, knowledge, and background to create an accurate and appropriate thangka: \\"Tibetan art exemplifies the nirmanakaya, the physical body of Buddha, and also the qualities of the Buddha, perhaps in the form of a deity. Art objects, therefore, must follow rules specified in the Buddhist scriptures regarding proportions, shape, color, stance, hand positions, and attributes in order to personify correctly the Buddha or Deities.\\"Lipton and Ragnubs, Treasures of Tibetan Art Nepal The earliest surviving thangka paintings from Nepal date to about the 14th century AD, but this is probably well after Buddhists and Hindus began to make illustrations of the deities and natural scenes. Historically, Tibetan and Chinese influence in Nepalese paintings is quite evident in Paubhas (Tangkas), and Nepalese styles have been a significant influence on Tibetan art. Paubhas are of two types, the Palas which are illustrative paintings of the deities and the Mandala, which are mystic diagrams paintings of complex test prescribed patterns of circles and square each having specific significance. It was through Nepal that Mahayana Buddhism was introduced into Tibet during reign of Angshuvarma in the seventh century AD. There was therefore a great demand for religious icons and Buddhist manuscripts for newly built monasteries throughout Tibet. A number of Buddhist manuscripts, including Prajnaparamita, were copied in Kathmandu Valley for these monasteries. Astasahas rika Prajnaparamita for example, was copied in Patan in the year 999 AD., during the reign of Narendra Dev and Udaya Deva, for the Sa-Shakya monastery in Tibet. For the Nor monastery in Tibet, two copies were made in Nepal, one of Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita in 1069 AD and the other of Kavyadarsha in 1111 AD. The influence of Nepalese art extended to China in regular order in the thirteenth century. Nepalese artisans were dispatched to the courts of Chinese emperors at their request to perform their workmanship and impart expert knowledge, with the Nepalese innovator and architect Balbahu, known by his popular name Araniko becoming the chief Imperial artist of Kubilai Khan. After the introduction of paper, palm leaf became less popular, however, it continued to be used until the eighteenth century. Paper manuscripts imitated the oblong shape but were wider than the palm leaves. From the fifteenth century onwards, brighter colours gradually began to appear in Nepalese thangka. Because of the growing importance of the tantric cult, various aspects of Shiva and Shakti were painted in conventional poses. Mahakala, Manjushri, Lokeshwara and other deities were equally popular and so were also frequently represented in thangka paintings of later dates. As Tantrism embodies the ideas of esoteric power, magic forces, and a great variety of symbols, strong emphasis is laid on the female element and sexuality in the paintings of that period. Religious paintings worshipped as icons are known as Paubha in Newari and thangka in Tibetan. The origin of Paubha or thangka paintings may be attributed to the Nepalese artists responsible for creating a number of special metal works and wall- paintings as well as illuminated manuscripts in Tibet. Realizing the great demand for religious icons in Tibet, these artists, along with monks and traders, took with them from Nepal not only metal sculptures but also a number of Buddhist manuscripts. One of the earliest specimens of Nepalese Thangka painting dates from the thirteenth /fourteenth century and shows Amitabha surrounded by bodhisattva. Another Nepalese thangka with three dates in the inscription (the last one corresponding to 1369 A.D.), is one of the earliest known thangka with inscriptions. The \\"Mandala of Vishnu \\" dated 1420 A.D., is another fine example of the painting of this period. Early Nepalese Tangkas are simple in design and composition. The main deity, a large figure, occupies the central position while surrounded by smaller figures of lesser divinities. During the reign of Tibetan Dharma King Trisong Duetsen the Tibetan masters refined their already well-developed arts through research and studies of different country's tradition. Thanka painting's lining and measurement, costumes, implementations and ornaments are mostly based on Indian styles. The drawing of figures is based on Nepalese style and the background sceneries are based on Chinese style. Thus, the thangka paintings became a unique and distinctive art. Although the practice of thanka painting was originally done as a way of gaining merit it has nowadays evolved into a commercial business and the noble intentions it once carried has been diluted. Tibetans do not sell Tangkas on a large scale as the selling of religious artifacts such as tangkas and idols is frowned upon in the Tibetan community and thus non Tibetan groups have been able to monopolize on its (thangka's) popularity among Buddhist and art enthusiasts from the west. Thangka have developed in the northern Himalayan regions among the Lamas. Besides Lamas, Gurung and Tamang communities are also producing Tankas, which provide substantial employment opportunities for many people in the hills. Newari Thankas or paubha have been produced in Kathmandu valley from the 13th century. Gallery File:Buddha Amitayus attended by bodhisattvas 11th century.

Joseph Hergenr√∂ther (15 September 1824 - 3 October 1890) was a German Church historian and canonist, and the first Cardinal-Prefect of the Vatican Archive.Catholic Encyclopedia Biography Born in W√ºrzburg, he was the second son of Johann Jacob Hergenr√∂ther, professor of medicine in the University of W√ºrzburg. In 1842 Hergenr√∂ther completed with notable success his gymnasium course in his native town, and entered the University of W√ºrzburg to take up a two-year course of philosophical studies, to which he added certain branches of theology. His historical tendencies exhibited themselves at this early age in a dramatic poem entitled Papst Gregor VII (W√ºrzburg, 1841). Bishop von Stahl took an interest in him, and in 1844 sent him to the Collegium Germanicum at Rome, whither he had already sent Heinrich Joseph Dominicus Denzinger and Franz Hettinger. Among his scholarly teachers were Giovanni Perrone and Carlo Passaglia in doctrinal theology, Tomei in moral theology, Antonio Ballerini in church history, Francis Xavier Patrizi in Scriptural exegesis, and Marzio in canon law. The political troubles of 1848 prevented the completion of his theological studies at Rome; he was ordained to the priesthood 28 March of that year, and returned to W√ºrzburg, where he pursued his ecclesiastical preparation for another year. In 1849 he was appointed chaplain at Zellingen, and for some time devoted himself to the duties of his office. In 1849 he stood successfully for the degree of doctor of theology before the University of Munich, and offered as his dissertation a treatise on the Trinitarian teaching of St. Gregory Nazianzen (Die Lehre von der g√∂ttlichen Dreieinigkeit nach d. heil. Gregor von Nazianz, Ratisbon, 1850). The qualities of the young doctor induced the theological faculty of Munich to offer him a place as instructor (privatdozent) in theology, which he accepted. Following ancient usage, he justified the confidence of the university by a printed thesis (Habilitationschrift) on the later Protestant theories of the origins of the Catholic Church (De catholic√¶ ecclesi√¶ primordiis recentiorum Protestantium systemata expenduntur, Ratisbon, 1851). Henceforth he devoted himself without reserve to his professorial duties. In 1852 he was called to W√ºrzburg, as professor extraordinary of canon law and church history; after three years (1855) he was promoted to the full possession of that chair. To his other duties he added the teaching of patrology. In those years W√ºrzburg rejoiced in the possession of such theologians as Hettinger, Denzinger, H√§hnlein, and Hergenr√∂ther. Hergenr√∂ther was often honoured by election to the office of dean of his faculty, and occasionally to the University Senate; the latter office he never held after 1871, because of his opposition to Ignaz von D√∂llinger. For a similar reason he was never chosen to be rector of the university. Until 1869 Hergenr√∂ther was occupied as teacher and writer, chiefly with early Christian and Byzantine ecclesiastical history. The discovery (1851) of the Greek Christian text known as the Philosopho√∫mena led him to examine its disputed authorship in a series of studies in the T√ºbinger Theol. Quartalschrift (1852) and in the supplementary volume (1856) to the first edition of the Kirchenlexikon of Heinrich Joseph Wetzer and Benedict Welte. He again defended the authorship of Hippolytus in the ≈ísterreichische Vierteljahrschrift f. kath. Theol. (1863). Hergenr√∂ther was especially interested in the career of Photius and in the origins of the Greek Schism, and kept up continuous research in the principal libraries for manuscripts of the works of Photius, in order to exhibit the original materials in as perfect a text as could be established. This led to the publication (Ratisbon, 1857) of the work, Photii Constantinopolitani Liber de Spiritus Sancti mystagogia. He contributed essays on the same work and on the Amphilochia of Photius to the T√ºb. Theol. Quartalschrift (1858). In 1860 appeared at Paris the Migne edition of \\"Photius\\".Patrologia Graeca, CI-CIV. It offered many textual emendations that were owing to Hergenr√∂ther, particularly in the \\"Amphilochia\\"; it was against his will that his earlier edition of the \\"Liber de Sp. Sancti mystagogia\\" was reprinted by Migne. When Aloys Pichler's work on the history of the separation of the Eastern and Western Churches appeared (Munich, 1864), Hergenr√∂ther was prepared to criticize it in the most thorough manner, which he did in a series of studies in a W√ºrzburg theological periodical, the \\"Chilianeum\\" (1864‚Äì65), and in the \\"Archiv. f. kath. Kirchenrecht\\" (1864‚Äì65). The results of his twelve years of research in the history of the Greek Schism appeared finally in the classical work, Photius Patriarch von Constantinopel, sein Leben, seine Schriften, und das griechische Schisma (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1867‚Äì69). An additional volume bears the title: Monumenta Gr√¶ca ad Photium ejusque historiam pertinentia (Ratisbon). In this monumental work it is difficult to say whether the palm belongs to the author's extensive knowledge of all the manuscript material, to his profound erudition, or to his calm objective attitude. Karl Krumbacher, the historian of Byzantine literature, says that the work cannot be surpassed. In these volumes Hergenr√∂ther laid here in minute detail the origins of the Byzantine Church, its development since the fourth century, and after the death of Photius until the completion of the schism in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. While professor of canon law at W√ºrzburg, Hergenr√∂ther published several important historico-canonical essays on such subjects as early ecclesiastical reordinations (Ester, Vierteljahrsch. f. kath. Theol., 1862), the canonical relations of the various rites in the Catholic Church (Archiv f. kath. Kirchenrecht, 1862), the politico-ecclesiastical relations of Spain and the Holy See (ibid., 1863‚Äì66), and the canon law of the Greeks to the end of the ninth century (ibid., 1870). His interest in the ecclesiastical vicissitudes of his own day was manifested by valuable essays on the States of the Church after the French Revolution (Hist.-polit. Bl√§tter, 1859), spirit of the age (Zeitgeist) and papal sovereignty (Der Katholik, 1861), and the Franco-Sardinian Treaty (Frankfort, 1865). Among his historico-apologetic essays are his treatises on the errors condemned by the Holy See in the Encyclical (Syllabus) of 8 December 1864 (in the Chilianeum, 1865), the veneration of the Blessed Virgin in the first ten centuries of the Christian Era (M√ºnster, 1870). He was a regular contributor of similar but briefer articles to the W√ºrzburg periodicals, \\"Die katholische Wochenschrift\\" and the \\"Chilianeum\\". Hergenr√∂ther was constantly engaged in attempting to develop a genuine Catholic sentiment and truly Christian life among the faithful. He preached frequently, and was always a welcome speaker at the general assemblies of the German Catholic associations (Vereine; 1863‚Äì77). For the Fulda meeting of the Prussian bishops (1870) he prepared an exhaustive historical study on the spoliation of the Papal States, in which he developed at length the arguments for the temporal power of the papacy. At Munich he gained the reputation of being one of the most learned theologians on the Ultramontane side of the Infallibility question, which had begun to be discussed; and in 1868 he was sent to Rome to arrange the proceedings of the Vatican Council. Together with some other Catholics, Hergenr√∂ther deplored the attitude that certain Catholic theologians assumed from about 1860, in particular that of the celebrated historian D√∂llinger. The latter's work Kirche und Kirchen, Papsttum und Kirchenstaat (1861) was criticized by Hergenr√∂ther in \\"Der Katholik\\". At the Munich meeting of Catholic savants (1863), Hergenr√∂ther was one of the eight who sent in a written protest against the opening discourse of D√∂llinger on the past and present of Catholic theology. Among the other signers were Heinrich Moufang von Sch√§zler, Paul Leopold Haffner, Franz Hettinger, and Matthias Joseph Scheeben. Hergenr√∂ther was soon called on to answer the pamphlet of Dr. Friedrich Bernhard Ferdinand Michelis, Kirche oder Partei? Ein offenes u. freies Wort an den deutschen Episkopat (Church or Faction? A Frank Address to the German Episcopate), in which this writer attacked violently the \\"Mainz\\" and the \\"Roman\\" theologians. Hergenr√∂ther's answer appeared in the \\"Chilianeum\\" (1865) under the title of Kirche u. nicht Partei. Eine Antwort auf die j√ºngste Brosch√ºre des Herrn Dr. Fr. Michelis (Church and not Faction: an Answer to the latest Brochure of Dr. Michelis). In the same review (1863) Hergenr√∂ther had written a critical account of the latest efforts of Western Catholics for ecclesiastical reunion with the Oriental Churches. The opening of the Vatican Council (1870) brought to a head the domestic conflict in Germany. Hergenr√∂ther was the foremost defender of the council and its decrees; as early as 1868 he had been appointed, with Hettinger, consultor for the preparation of the council's work and had taken up his residence at Rome. His knowledge of ecclesiastical history, canon law, and Catholic dogma made him a valuable co-labourer in the many careful and detailed preliminary meetings of the council commission. In the meantime he prepared, with Hettinger, and published in the \\"Chilianeum\\" (1869) a memorial of the theological faculty of W√ºrzburg in reply to five questions, submitted by the Bavarian Government, concerning the approaching council. He also published (Der Katholik, 1871) another outlined memorial concerning the Vatican Council, in reply to eleven questions submitted by the Bavarian Minister of Worship to the theological and law faculties of W√ºrzburg. This memorial, though projected, was never formally called for by the Government. The opposition to the Vatican Council reached its acme in the work Der Papst und das Concil, by \\"Janus\\" (D√∂llinger). In the same year (1869) Hergenr√∂ther prepared his \\"Anti-Janus\\", an historico-theological critique (Freiburg, 1870). He also published a number of small brochures in favour of the council and against D√∂llinger, e. g. \\"Die Irrth√ºmer logischer Censor\\" (Freiburg, 1870), and a critique of Dr. D√∂llinger's declaration of 28 March 1871 (Freiburg, 1871). His pen was also active in the \\"Historisch-politische Bl√§tter\\", where he published (1870) a series of articles on the \\"Allgemeine Zeitung\\" and its letters from the council, on papal infallibility before the Vatican Council, and on ancient Gallicans and modern Appellants. In 1871 he published the solid study \\"Das unfehlbare Lehrant des Papstes\\" [The Infallible Magisterium (teaching office) of the pope, Passau, 1871]. These grave and exhausting labours were crowned and partially summarized by a new work, Katholische Kirche u. christlicher Staat in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung u. in Beziehung auf die Gegenwart (The Catholic Church and the Christian State, in their historical development and their relations to the present), together with an \\"Anti-Janus vindicatus\\" (Freiburg, 1872, 2nd annotated ed., Freiburg, 1876). The former is a thesaurus of information concerning politico- ecclesiastical conflicts of the past, and is marked throughout by an uncompromising tone. It was translated into Italian (Pavia, 1877) and into English (London, 1876; Baltimore, 1889). He published his Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirchengeschichte (Manual of General Church History) in the \\"theological Library\\" of Herder (Freiburg, 1876). A second annotated edition appeared in 1879; in 1880 a third volume was added, containing the notes and documentary evidence. This work was then and remains yet unsurpassed for abundance of information, accuracy of narrative, and manifold sources of historical proof. A third edition appeared (1884‚Äì86), in which the notes are no longer printed apart, but accompany the text. The writer of this article is the editor of a fourth edition (3 vols., Freiburg, 1902-1909). When it was proposed to bring out a new edition of the \\"Kirchenlexikon\\" of Wetzer and Welte, Hergenr√∂ther was naturally suggested as the savant most capable of executing this gigantic task. He accepted it, but was compelled to abandon it when scarcely begun; his elevation to the dignity of cardinal with the obligation of a Roman residence, left him no freedom for the enterprise. The first volume contains many articles from his pen, some of them quite lengthy. He was unable to do as much for the other volumes‚Äìin all there are eighty- seven articles signed by him. Other minor literary tasks consumed his spare hours in the last period of his life at W√ºrzburg. The various subjects were Pius IX (W√ºrzburg, 1876); Athanasius the Great (Cologne, 1876); Cardinal Maury in \\"Katholische Studien\\" (W√ºrzburg, 1878); a short history of the popes (W√ºrzburg, 1878); the vow of poverty among the Oriental monks in \\"Archiv f. kath. Kirchenrecht\\" (1877); the canonical significance of nomination (ibid., 1878). Hergenr√∂ther's works in the departments of church history and canon law, and his firm attitude on the great ecclesiastical questions of the day, won for him the confidence of all the bishops and Catholic scholars of Germany. In 1877 Pius IX had recognized his services to the Vatican Council and the ecclesiastical sciences by making him a domestic prelate. When Leo XIII determined to open the Vatican Archives to the scholars of the world, he found in him the savant to whom he might safely entrust the practical execution of this generous act. Hergenr√∂ther was made Cardinal-Deacon of San Nicol√≤ in Carcere, 12 May 1879, to the great joy of all German, and particularly Bavarian, Catholics. At a later date he was transferred to Santa Maria in Via Lata. He was also appointed Cardinal-Prefect of the Apostolic Archives, a new office, which he was the first to fill, and in which he was charged with the establishment of research work in the Vatican Archives and the systematizing, on scientific lines, of scholarly work amid these rich treasures. That he executed the views of Leo XIII in a satisfactory and even generous manner, is acknowledged by the numerous historical workers who have laboured in the archives since 1879. Hergenr√∂ther was also a member of several Roman congregations (Index, Studies, and Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs), and protector of several religious institutes. He undertook, moreover, to edit the official correspondence (Regesta) of Leo X, a rather thankless task, and one of great difficulty, because of the exceedingly bad handwriting of that day. He was efficiently aided by his younger brother, Franz Hergenr√∂ther, who had accompanied him to Rome. Before his death the cardinal published eight parts or fasciculi of this extensive work, \\"Leonis X Pont. Maximi Regesta\\", Vol. I (Freiburg, 1884‚Äì85). A small part of the second volume was brought out (Freiburg, 1891) by his brother and fellow-editor, since which time the publication has ceased by reason of the latter's return to W√ºrzburg as canon capitular of the cathedral. Cardinal Hergenr√∂ther undertook another work of the most exacting nature, the continuation of Karl Joseph von Hefele's \\"History of the Councils\\", two volumes of which he published before his death (vol. VIII, Freiburg, 1887; vol. IX, 1890). The latter volume contains the preliminary history of the Council of Trent and is also a history of the Lutheran Reformation. He suffered much in the last years of his life, as the result of an apoplectic attack which crippled him grievously though it did not affect the brightness and vigour of his intellect. He was able to keep up his literary labours to the day of his death. During the summer vacation of 1890 he took up his residence in the Cistercian Abbey of Mehrerau (on the Bodensee) the hospitality of which he had more than once enjoyed. In this secluded spot he met with another apoplectic stroke, and died. He was laid to rest in the church of the abbey. In 1897 a suitable monument was erected to his memory by his friends, and dedicated (25 March). He was a stanch supporter of the infallibility dogma. In 1870 he wrote Anti-Janus, an answer to The Pope and the Council, by Janus (Ignaz von D√∂llinger and Johann Friedrich), which made a great sensation at the time. In 1877 he was made prelate of the papal household; he became cardinal deacon in 1879, and was afterwards made curator of the Vatican archives. He died in Mehrerau AbbeyHans Dieter Betz, Don S. Browning, Bernd Janowski, Religion past & present: encyclopedia of theology and religion, Brill, 1999. near Bregenz in 1890. His portrait was apparently painted by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862-1947) during the two years he spent studying in Italy 1882-1884, and was probably signed Ad. Muller. Its present whereabouts is unknown.

Plot The action takes place in 1905 at the factory of the landowners Bardiny and Skrobotov. Skrobotov is dissatisfied with the liberal policy of his partner Bardiny and complains that the workers are given too much voice ‚Äì \\"They don't dare squeak at me!\\" says Skrobotov, sincerely believing that the working class should not be allowed entertainment, education, or voting rights. The factory has a social democratic worker's organization, and its activists demand the removal of a cruel manager, Dichkov. Skrobotov categorically refuses, believing that even if Dichkov deserves removal in this case, doing so in response to worker demands would be a fatal step. Discussions between the workers lead nowhere, the situation spirals out of control, Skrobotov summons the militia, and blood is shed. One of the enraged workers mortally wounds Skrobotov, who before he dies identifies the worker as a communist. A murder investigation ensues, the militia arresting masses of workers. But the workers do not break, and display iron calm, coolness and courage. A worker, Akimov, comes to Bardiny and confesses to the murder. But other workers come, and stand behind Akimov. Skrobotov's widow Cleopatra advises Akimov to flee into exile, to which Akimov responds: Productions and adaptions Enemies was produced at the Moscow Art Theater beginning October 10, 1935, directed by Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko and Mikhail Nikolayevich Kedrov.

Plans for any highway failed due to grass- roots efforts against the highway.  History  The Illinois interstate highway plan in the mid-1950s included a freeway from Peoria toward Chicago in the I-180 corridor. This was not approved by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), but the state made provisions for the highway in Peoria (\\"ghost ramps\\" from IL 6 at the IL 29 interchange, and an I-180 stub at its IL 29 interchange). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Illinois adopted a supplemental freeway plan with the goal of providing any state resident a trip of 30 minutes or less to reach a \\"convenient highway\\" reaching any city of 25,000 or more. The I-180 to Peoria extension was part of this plan, but very few of these freeways were actually built. In the 1970s, Illinois proposed a similar route incorporating the future I-155 and I-180 as Interstate 53; the number was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), but the route was declined by the FHWA.I-180 Illinois at Kurumi.com. Retrieved 30 July 2015. In the mid-1990s, the state revived the proposal, calling it the \\"Heart of Illinois Freeway.\\" A few alternatives were selected, among them the IL 6 to I-180 connection. In late 2000, the state decided to proceed with the 6/180 connection, but ran into opposition from farmers and withdrawn support from area Congressman Ray LaHood (R-Peoria), who favored four-laning IL 29. A Peoria city council vote to encourage the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) to continue study on the freeway failed, highlighting the proposal's loss of momentum. In February 2002, IDOT stated there was no traffic need for the freeway, only political and economic reasons for advocating it; and that they only studied the issue because Peoria asked for it.  Current routes to Peoria from Chicago  There are five existing major routes from Chicago to Peoria; the four shortest require Peoria-to-Chicago traffic to divert from major interstates, and the fifth all-interstate option adds approximately to a trip.  Interstate 180 / Illinois Route 29 / Illinois Route 6  This option utilizes Interstate 55, Interstate 80, and Interstate 180 to approach Peoria from the north. I-180 ends at Illinois Route 29, and the corridor south of this point is considered a prime candidate for conversion to a four-lane expressway. The highway would then connect to an extended Illinois Route 6 freeway in Chillicothe. This was the original route planned for in the late 1970s. The highway would have run through a handful of small towns on the Illinois River. However, environmental impacts (state and federal) raised concerns about an Interstate route along this section of the Illinois River valley. If this route is ever built, it could become part of the proposed Chicago‚ÄìKansas City Expressway, connecting to the planned Fulton County section of Illinois Route 336, and the Interstate 72/U.S 36 corridor across Missouri.  Illinois Route 116  This option utilizes Interstate 55 to Illinois Route 116, and entering Peoria from the northeast. Illinois 116 would have been upgraded to a four-lane freeway through Benson, Roanoke, and Metamora west of Interstate 39, and eastward through to Interstate 55. This alignment would have displaced hundreds of acres of prime farmland. Illinois 116 is already a four-lane divided highway west of Metamora, but a bypass around all three cities would have been required.  U.S. Route 24  Similar to the Illinois 116 option, U.S. Route 24 is already a four-lane divided highway from Peoria to Washington. It would have required a bypass around Eureka, however, and displaced acres of prime farmland. Both US 24 and Illinois 116 already carry an elevated amount of traffic between Peoria and Chicago. Both roads are two-lane, roads, and high-speed head-on crashes are a growing danger in the area.  Interstate 39  Interstate 39 could have formed a leg from Interstate 80 to either Illinois 116 and US 24. At this point, however, the number of miles saved does not justify the project.  Interstate 74  The current all-Interstate method of traveling from Chicago to Peoria is by taking Interstate 55 to Interstate 74.  Failure  Strong opposition from not only local organizations but IDOT itself cancelled the project, despite the fact that the project had gone through the initial investigation, and an alignment had been determined. As a result, the Peoria- to-Chicago Highway remains deferred until the cost of any of the above alternatives can justify the need for a direct connection. In a joint resolution between the Illinois House and Senate in late May 2010,, 96th Illinois General Assembly. an expressway project connecting Chicago-to-Kansas City will be named Illinois Route 110. The path, in total, follows parts of the existing Illinois Route 336, Interstate 88, Interstate 172, Interstate 72, Interstate 74, U.S. Route 136, U.S. Route 67, and connect the cities of Quincy, Macomb, Galesburg, a number of communities of the Chicago metropolitan area, including Chicago itself on Interstate 290. Hence, in 2010, Peoria has been by-passed by Illinois Route 110.  See also  * Cannon Ball Route  Future  Illinois Route 110 project from Chicago to Kansas City.

Early years Goldsborough was born in Washington, D.C.. His father was Brice Goldsborough, who died in a plane crash as Frances Wilson Grayson's navigator on an attempted crossing of the Atlantic Ocean from Newfoundland. Frank's stepmother was named Gertrude. By the time he was 18 the family was living in New York where he attended Flushing High School in Queens. Transcontinental speed record Goldsborough held the junior transcontinental air speed record until his death. In April and May 1930 he wrote a series of exclusive first-person accounts for The New York Times about his exploits in the National Air Tour and his breaking of the transcontinental air speed record. Death Goldsborough's plane crashed in Vermont on July 15, 1930 only a day short of his 20th birthday. His passenger, Don Mockler, walked away from the crash, dazed but alive, and went for help. Goldsborough was trapped in the wreckage with a head injury for 18 hours before he was rescued, alive but not conscious. All his teeth had been knocked out. He was carried away by rescuers on a makeshift stretcher made from a parachute to the home of Harry C. Jenkins. Goldsborough died on July 16, 1930, at Putnam Memorial Hospital in Bennington on his 20th birthday, without regaining consciousness. Funeral He was buried on July 19, 1930 at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx. Charles Lindbergh sent flowers. His body was moved by his stepmother and reburied on 30 July 1930 to Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, Westchester County, New York. His stepmother, Gertrude Jacobi Goldsborough, and her mother Anna Marie Hoehn Jacobi are buried there as well.

He was the editor of The British Medical Journal.Holmes, T. (1898). Ernest Hart, M.R.C.S., D.C.L., Editor Of The British Medical Journal, Formerly Chairman Of The Parliamentary Bills Committee Of The British Medical Association. The British Medical Journal 1 (1933): 175-186. Biography Hart was born in London, the son of a Jewish dentist. He was educated at the City of London school, and became a student at St Georges hospital. In 1856 he became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, making a specialty of diseases of the eye. He was appointed ophthalmic surgeon at St Mary's hospital at the age of 28, and occupied various other posts, introducing into ophthalmic practice some modifications since widely adopted. His name, too, is associated with a method of treating popliteal aneurism, which he was the first to use in Great Britain. His real life-work, however, was as a medical journalist, beginning with the Lancet in 1857. He was appointed editor of the British Medical Journal on 11 August 1866. During this time the British Medical Journal's harsh criticism of Isaac Baker Brown lead to the complete destruction of Brown's career. As editor Hart can be held accountable in part for this (as can the editor before him, William Orlando Markham). His campaigning editorials could be vicious. They were usually sententious and often self- congratulatory. On 22 November 1866 Hart was appointed as a poorlaw inspector as his colleague William Orlando Markham rejected the position. He took a leading part in the exposures which led to the inquiry into the state of London work-house infirmaries, and to the reform of the treatment of sick poor throughout England, and the Infant Life Protection Act of 1872, aimed at the evils of baby-farming, was largely due to his efforts. The record of his public work covers nearly the whole field of sanitary legislation during the last thirty years of his life. He had a hand in the amendments of the Public Health and of the Medical Acts, always promoting the medical profession above others in the public health field; in the measures relating to notification of infectious disease, to vaccination, to the registration of plumbers; in the improvement of factory legislation; in the remedy of legitimate grievances of Army and Navy medical officers; in the removal of abuses and deficiencies in crowded barrack schools; in denouncing the sanitary shortcomings of the Indian government, particularly in regard to the prevention of cholera. His work on behalf of the British Medical Association is shown by the increase from 2,000 to 19,000 in the number of members, and the growth of the British Medical Journal from 20 to 64 pages, during his editorship. From 1872 to 1897 he was chairman of the Associations Parliamentary Bill Committee. Beginning his collections by contacting Tadamasa Hayashi in 1882, Hart became a prominent collector of Japanese Art and later joined the Japan Society, frequently giving lectures on subjects such as Lacquerware.Britain and Japan: Biographical Portraits, Vol. VIII, BRILL, 2013, Hugh Cortazzi, Noburu Koyama, pp. 257 - 262See , Notes on the history of lacquer : a paper read before the Japan Society of London, Ernest Hart, Japan Society, 1893 In 1891 he travelled to Japan with his second wife, Alice Hart.Britain and Japan: Biographical Portraits, Vol. VIII, BRILL, 2013, Hugh Cortazzi, Noburu Koyama, p 261 Hart was also editor and proprietor of The Sanitary Record for a period, and chairman of the National Health Society. Vaccination In 1880, Hart authored the book The Truth About Vaccination. It refuted the arguments made by anti-vaccinators. Each anti-vaccination allegation was disproved with medical and statistical evidence. Hart demonstrated from a vast body of evidence the advantages of how a vaccinated person can resist an attack of smallpox, compared to those un-vaccinated.Anonymous. (1880). Notes On Books.

He married his second wife, in 1872, Alice Marion Rowland, the sister of social reformer Henrietta Barnett. Rowland had herself studied medicine in London and Paris, and was no less interested than her husband in philanthropic reform. She was most active in her encouragement of Irish cottage industries, and was the founder of the Donegal Industrial Fund.

Its mission was to develop a numeric processor. The founders were David Yen, Wei Yen, Ross Towle, Arun Kumar, and Bob Rau (the chief architect). History The company was originally named ‚ÄùAxiom Systems\\". However another company in San Diego called \\"Axiom\\" was founded earlier. Axiom Systems called its architecture \\"SPARC\\". It sold the rights to the name (but not the architecture) to Sun Microsystems and used the money to hire NameLab to come up with a new company name. They came up with \\"Cydrome\\" from \\"cyber\\" (computer) \\"drome\\" (racecourse). Cydrome moved from an office in San Jose to a business park in Milpitas on President's Day 1985. This site was used to host meetings of the Bay Area ACM chapter's Special Interest Group in Large Scale Systems (SIGBIG), in contrast to then SIGSMALL for microcomputers which are now called \\"PCs\\" and its present-day national SIGHPC. Late in its history, Cydrome received an investment from Prime Computers and OEMed the Cydra-5 through Prime. The system sold by Cydrome had white skins. The skins for the Prime OEM system was black. In the Summer of 1988 Prime was set to acquire Cydrome. At the last minute the board of Prime decided not to go through with the deal. That sealed the fate of Cydrome. The company closed after roughly 4 years of operation in 1988. Many of the ideas in Cydrome were carried on in the Itanium architecture. Product In order to improve performance in a new instruction set architecture, the Cydrome processors were based on a very long instruction word (VLIW) containing instructions from parallel operations. Software pipelining in a custom Fortran compilerJames C. Dehnert and Ross A Towle, \\"Compiling for the Cydra 5\\", The Journal of Supercomputing, 7 (1/2), 1993, pp. 181-227. generated code that would run efficiently. The numeric processorGary R. Besk, David W. L. Yen and Thomas L. Anderson, \\"The Cydra 5 Minisupercomputer: Architecture and Implementation\\", The Journal of Supercomputing, 7 (1/2), 1993. used a 256 bit- wide instruction word with seven \\"fields\\". In most cases the compiler would find instructions that could run in parallel and place them together in a single word. It also had a special mode where each of the operations could be executed sequentially. It implemented register rotation to aid in software pipelining of loops. There was an instruction cache only, since it was felt that a data cache would be inefficient on sparse array operations. The numeric processor also incorporated memory management and consequently employed virtual memory concepts. The memory subsystem implemented a 64 way interleaved 4-port memory. To ensure that there would be no \\"hot spots\\" within the memory system, the addresses to the memory were hashed to spread the accesses evenly across the 64 way memory system. It was implemented in ECL running at 25 MHz. Major functional modules were implemented using AMCC ECL ASICs. The project grew beyond its original definition to include a front-end general purpose processor ensemble based on the multiple 68020 processors running Unix System V. The numeric processor ran a small kernel that would allow it to receive job submissions from the Unix system. The initial machine was dubbed the Cydra-5 and nine systems (three prototypes plus six production units) were built. In 1987 the machine saw its first public appearance at the first Supercomputer Conference held in Santa Clara, CA. A sample Cydra-5 is in storage at the Computer History Museum.

The National Conference of State Legislatures. www.ncsl.org. Retrieved June 29, 2013. Legislatures are usually unicameral, consisting of only one chamber, or bicameral, consisting of two, but there are rare examples of tricameral and tetracameral legislatures.  Bicameralism  In a bicameral legislature, the two bodies are often referred to as an upper and a lower house, where the latter is often regarded as more particularly the representatives of the people. The lower house is almost always the originator of legislation, and the upper house is the body that offers the \\"second look\\" and decides whether to veto or approve the bills. In the United Kingdom legislation can be originated in either house, but the lower house can ultimately prevail if the two houses repeatedly disagree. In most countries the lower house also has sole or predominant control over matters to do with finance and taxation. A parliament's lower house is usually composed of at least 100 members, in countries with populations of over 3 million. The number of seats rarely exceeds 400, even in very large countries. Among the countries with large lower houses are France, where the National Assembly has 577 members, and Japan, where the House of Representatives has 475 members. The upper house of a parliament customarily has anywhere from 20 to 200 seats, but almost always significantly fewer than the lower house. In the United Kingdom however, the lower house (the House of Commons) has 650 members, but the upper house (the House of Lords) currently has slightly more members than the lower house, and at one time (before the exclusion of most of the hereditary peers) had considerably more. Merging of chambers Until 1953, the Rigsdag in Denmark was divided into two houses, the \\"Folketing\\" and \\"Landsting\\", but has since become a unicameral legislature. The same goes with Sweden, and its \\"Riksdag\\" until 1971. The Norwegian parliament (Storting) was officially divided in two chambers 1814‚Äì2009, but functioned as a single chamber in practice, a situation called Qualified unicameralism. Floor and committee The floor is the name for the full assembly, and a committee is a small deliberative assembly that is usually subordinate to the floor. In the United Kingdom, either chamber may opt to take some business such as detailed consideration of a Bill on the Floor of the House instead of in Committee.UK Parliament Glossary, http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/floor-of-the-house/, accessed 1 July 2015  Security  The building that houses the Chambers of a Parliament is usually equipped with an internal policeUnder the responsibility of the Usher of the black rod, in Westminster-style Parliaments. and in some, the public force is not allowed access without authorisation.In Italy the judge could raise conflict of powers against the House asking the Constitutional Court - in accordance with decision no. 120/2014 - for access to the Palace to perform his duties: ReferencesSee also *Delegated legislation *Inter-Parliamentary Union *Witenagemot Legislatures Elections ","title":"Legislative chamber"},{"id":"1334304","text":"Thomas Gordon Hake (10 March 1809 ‚Äì 11 January 1895) was an English physician and poet. Life Hake was born at Leeds on 10 March 1809, and was descended from an old Devonshire family who had 'lived on the soil for many years without being distinguished in any branch of science, literature, or art.' His father, whose usual residence was Sidmouth, possessed considerable musical acquirements. His mother, fourteen years older than the father, was of the Huntly branch of the Gordon family, being eldest daughter of Captain William Augustus Gordon, and aunt of General Charles Gordon. His father died when Hake was three years old and his mother, left with a moderate competence, continued to live in Devonshire, and obtained for her son an admission to Christ's Hospital, where, first at the preparatory school at Hertford and afterwards in London, he received most of his education. Having determined upon a medical career, Hake studied at Lewes under Thomas Hodson, 'the highest authority in his profession within the bounds of Sussex,' afterwards at St. George's Hospital, and at the university of Edinburgh and university of Glasgow, at which latter he graduated. After travelling for some time in Italy he settled at Brighton, where he was for five years physician to the dispensary, then proceeded to Paris for a year's study, and on his return in 1839 published Piromides, a tragedy on the mysteries of Isis, and the 'nebulous but impressive romance,' as Mr. W. M. Rossetti calls it, Vates, or the Philosophy of Madness, first issued in four incomplete numbers, with illustrations by Charles Landseer (1840, 4to), and afterwards republished in Ainsworth's Magazine as 'Yaldarno, or the Ordeal of Art-Worship.' Towards 1844, 'it seethed in my brother's head,' says Mr. Rossetti, and it ultimately led to a friendship between Dante Rossetti and the author eventful for both. Hake next settled at Bury St. Edmunds, where he became intimate with George Borrow and J. W. Donaldson, of both of whom he has given interesting particulars in his autobiography. Between 1839 and 1853, he contributed numerous papers, chiefly of a scientific complexion, to the medical journals. About the latter date he gave up practice at Bury, travelled in America, and on his return established himself at Roehampton, and, while tilling the post of physician to the West London Hospital, became physician to the Countess of Ripon, who was related to his mother's family. The beauty of Lady Ripon‚Äôs woods at Nocton revived the spirit of poetry within him. He wrote his ‚ÄòLily of the Valley‚Äô and his ‚ÄòOld Souls,‚Äô which, with other poems, were threaded together as 'The World‚Äôs Epitaph,' privately printed in 1866 in an edition of one hundred copies. One of these came into the hands of Rossetti, who admired it as enthusiastically is ‚ÄòValdarno,' and the two poets met in October 1869. In Rossetti‚Äôs darkest days, when in 1872 his life was nearly terminated by laudanum, Hake rendered the greatest service. ‚ÄòHe was the earthly providence of the Rossetti family,' says Mr. W. M. Rossetti. He took Dante Rossetti to his house during the wont of the crisis, afterwards accompanied him to Scotland, and consented to his own son George acting for a long time as Rossetti's companion and secretary, a position which the derangement of the patient's mental and physical health eventually rendered untenable. After 1872, Hake spent a considerable time in Italy and Germany, and, returning to England, settled near St. John's Wood, principally occupied in the composition and publication of poetry for the few, difficult rather than obscure in thought and diction, but uninviting to those who cannot appreciate mystical symbolism. In 1871 he published ‚ÄòMadeline and other Poems,‚Äô reproducing much of ‚ÄòThe World's Epitaph.' In 1872 appeared ‚ÄòParables and Tales,‚Äò comprising ‚ÄòOld Souls.' In 1876 he published ‚ÄòNew Symbols;' in 1879 ‚Äòlegends of the Morrow;‚Äô in 1680 ‚ÄòMaiden Ecstasy;‚Äô in 1863 ‚ÄòThe Serpent Play,‚Äô and in 1890 ‚ÄòThe New Day,‚Äô a collection of sonnets in the Shakespearean form. Hake's autobiography, ‚ÄòMemoirs of Eighty Years,‚Äô was published in 1892. During the last four years of his life he was confined to his couch by a fracture of the hip, but his faculties and spirits remained unimpaired. He died on 11 January 1895. Works In 1839, he published a prose epic Vales, republished in Ainsworth's Magazine as Valdarno, which attracted the attention of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Rossetti, against his habit, reviewed Hake's poems in The Academy http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1744999] and the Fortnightly Review. Hake became a member of the circle round Rossetti. Hake's first poetry collection, The World's Epitaph, was published in 1866, in a print run of 100. In 1871, Hake published Madeline; in 1872, Parables and Tales; in 1879, Legends of the Morrow; in 1880 \\"Maiden Ecstasy\\" (poems); in 1883, The Serpent Play; in 1890, New Day Sonnets; and, in 1892, his Memoirs of Eighty Years. Family In the 1830s, Hake married Lucy Bush. They had several sons, including Alfred Egmont Hake, an author and philosopher who wrote a biography of General Charles Gordon.

He devised Tissot's indicatrix, or distortion circle, which when plotted on a map will appear as an ellipse whose elongation depends on the amount of distortion by the map at that point. The angle and extent of the elongation represents the amount of angular distortion of the map. The size of the ellipse indicates the amount that the area is distorted. Biography Born in Nancy, Meurthe, France, Tissot was trained as an engineer in the French Army, from which he graduated as capitaine du g√©nie. In the early 1860s he became an instructor in geodesy at the well-reputed Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. Around the same time, he indulged a research program meant to determine the best way of cartographic projection for a particular region and presented his findings to the French Acad√©mie des Sciences.M. d'Avezac, \\"Coup d‚Äô≈ìil historique sur la projection des cartes de g√©ographie,\\" Bulletin de la soci√©t√© de g√©ographie (January‚ÄìJune 1863), pp. 438‚Äì462. In the eighteenth century, the German cartographer Johann H. Lambert had enunciated a mathematical theory of map projections and of the attendant characteristics of distortions that any given projection involved. Carl Friedrich Gauss had also studied the subject before Tissot's contributions later in the nineteenth century.Frank Canters, Small-Scale Map Projection Design (London: Taylor &, Francis 2002), p. 5. Tissot's research in the mid-1850s on methods for finding good projections for particular regions led him to develop a projection that he saw as optimal. While not quite equal-area or conformal, his projection resulted in \\"negligible distortion for a very small region.\\" Subsequently, his optimal projection was adopted by the geographic service of the French Army.John Snyder, Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), p. 143 While his first concepts regarding cartographic distortions developed in mid-century, it was only with the publication of M√©moire sur la repr√©sentation des surfaces et les projections des cartes g√©ographiques in 1881 that the Tissot's Indicatrix became popular.Nicolas Auguste Tissot, M√©moire sur la repr√©sentation des surfaces et les projections des cartes g√©ographiques (Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1881). In the book, Tissot argued for his method, reportedly demonstrating that \\"whatever the system of transformation, there is at each point on the spherical surface at least one pair of orthogonal directions which will also be orthogonal on the projection.\\"Robinson et al., Elements of Cartography 5th Edition (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1984), p. 81. Tissot employed a graphical device he called the ellipse indicatrice or distortion circle. When plotted on a map it reveals the amount of distortion by the map at the particular point where the ellipse is plotted. He suggested that the angle and extent of the elongation of the distortion circle represented the amount of angular distortion of the map, while the size of the ellipse corresponded to the amount of distortion in area.Borden D. Dent, Cartography: Thematic Map Design 2nd Edition (New York: Wm. C. Brown, 1990), pp. 53‚Äì55; Robinson et al., Elements, pp. 81‚Äì86; \\"Tissot‚Äôs Theory of the Projection of Maps,\\" Science, 2 November 1888, p. 207. In a nineteenth-century cartographic context, in which professionals looked for ways to apply mathematical principles to the science of mapping and the map projection, Tissot's theory was favorably received, at least in continental Europe.Arthur H. Robinson, \\"The Use of Deformational Data in Evaluating World Map Projections,\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers 41, 1 (March 1951), pp. 59‚Äì60. Even in the more restrained Anglo- American academic world, a columnist of Science, a publication sponsored by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, hailed Tissot's method and encouraged his readers to study his work in the hope that such a study \\"will lead to the adoption of better projections than those which are at present in use.\\"\\"Tissot‚Äôs Theory‚Ä¶,\\" p. 207. The legacy of Tissot‚Äôs method is still vivid today, as suggested by the authors of Map Projections for Europe, who argue that since Tissot‚Äôs famous analysis regarding distortion, the only major scientific development in the metric interpretation of deformation has been Eduard Imhof's Verzerrungsgitter, or deformation grid.A. Annoni et al. (eds.), Map Projections for Europe (European Communities, 2003), p. 78. Tissot died in Paris.

It was established 1935, by Frank Jessop in Leicester, United Kingdom. The company controls Jessops Europe Limited, which in turn control JR Prop Limited (formally Jessops Retail Limited). In the end of the 2000s, the business struggled with insolvency, and entered administration in January 2013. The company was rescued by entrepreneur Peter Jones CBE, who bought the assets, and formed Jessops (Group) Limited, and related companies. History Frank Jessop founded Jessop of Leicester in 1935, as a specialist photographic retailer. The company expanded to major towns and cities. Alan Jessop, Frank's son, sold the firm in a management buy out in July 1996. This was to Bridgepoint Capital. Bridgepoint Capital attempted to float Jessops on the London Stock Exchange in September 2000, but abandoned plans the following month. This was because it was told the firm would list with a market value of ¬£90 million to ¬£100 million. The two hundredth store, Durham, opened in July 2001, which has since closed down. Jessops once again abandoned plans to float, in April 2002. ABN Amro paid ¬£116 million for the company, in September 2002. The sale was completed the next month. ABN Amro applied to float on the London Stock Exchange in October 2004, which successfully occurred the next month. In May 2004, the main warehouse relocated to Weedon Bec, Northamptonshire, as the warehouse in Leicester was considered too small. This resulted in most of the staff being made redundant. In August 2020, Jessops, which had one shop in the city centre of Nottingham, announced that the location had been completely shut down, after the sign was stripped, and replaced in black pigment. The coronavirus pandemic was cited as (one) reason for the closure, by the company. Financial problems (2007‚Äì2013) The company suffered financial difficulties by June 2007, requiring the strategic review, and eventually leading to a re financing with its bankers, HSBC, in September 2009. This led to the group's trade being transferred to a new holding company, Snap Equity Limited, whilst Jessops plc was placed in liquidation and the group's final salary pension scheme transferred to the Pension Protection Fund. Snap Equity was formed as a private company, 48% owned by HSBC, 33% by pension trustees, and 20% by an employee trust. On 21 June 2007, Jessops announced the closure of 81 of its then 315 stores, as \\"part of a strategic review, which aimed to save the Leicester firm ¬£15m\\". HSBC acquired the company circa September 2009, in a \\"debt for equity\\" deal. The Financial Times commented that the company was hurt by the quality of mobile phone cameras, reducing demand for traditional cameras. On 9 January 2013, Jessops went into administration, with an application made to the High Court. On 11 January, it was announced that all 187 stores would close, with the loss of 1,370 jobs. Shoppers who put anywhere up to ¬£500 on a gift card, found them useless, and the company ceased to accept customer returns, although manufacturers' warranties on products not branded by Jessops, were not affected. On 31 January 2013, however, the brand of Jessops, and various assets, were acquired by entrepreneur, Peter Jones, one of the investors from the television programme, Dragons' Den. Various new companies were incorporated including Jessops (Group) Limited, Jessops Europe Limited and Jessops Retail Limited. Jones also incorporated Jessops Online Limited, at the same time. On 3 February, the supermarket retailer, Morrisons, agreed to purchase seven of Jessops larger store sites, from the administrators, for an undisclosed price, to be converted to the convenience store format by Morrisons, M Local. Reopening On 28 March 2013, six stores reopened, and Jones aimed to open a new store every day on average during April 2013. One of the six opened on the 28 March, the store in Oxford Street in London, received considerable media interest, and was attended by several celebrities, including the actor James Corden. Another store in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Aberdeen and High Wycombe were the other five. St Albans opened on the 29 March. Several other stores reopened throughout April. All the new stores contained a mini labs, offering same day processing of photographic film. The company had reoopened twenty eight stores across the United Kingdom, by September 2013. Jessops signed a landmark deal with Sainsbury's in July 2014, to start opening Jessops branches in its larger stores, the first of which opened in October 2014. There were fifty two stores of Jessops, by April 2016. ReSolve were appointed as administrators for JR Prop Limited, in December 2019. This company holds property leases and employs retail staff, the main trading company, Jessops Europe Limited, was not affected.

From 1817 to 1820 he was with French forces in the Levant. Then, until 1824, he was stationed first in Senegal and then the Pacific. As a Lieutenant, Bruat took part in the 1827 Battle of Navarino as maneuver officer on Breslaw. In 1830, he received command of the brig Sil√®ne and cruised off Algiers, taking a number of prizes.

While captive, Bruat managed to transmit observations on the state of the defences of Algier to admiral Duperr√©. After the Invasion of Algiers, Bruat was promoted to captain and awarded commanded the I√©na, off Portugal. He then served on Triton, before supervising naval constructions in Toulon from 1841.

He makes three main points: first, that Borges was highly influenced by his wide and obscure reading, making the assertion that, \\"His sources are innumerable and unexpected. Borges has read everything, and especially what nobody reads any more: the Cabalists, the Alexandrine Greeks, medieval philosophers. His erudition is not profound ‚Äï he asks of it only flashes of lightning and ideas ‚Äï but it is vast.\\". Second, that Borges has many precursors, but is in the end, almost entirely unique - \\"... once these relationships are pointed out, it must be said that Borges's style is, like his thought, highly original\\". In this Maurois notes that to some extent, \\"'Every writer creates his own precursors'\\", finally noting that Borges' stories can be described by \\"'an absurd postulate developed to its extreme logical consequences'\\", making \\"a game for [Borges'] mind\\". This, he claims, reflects Borges' interest in metaphysics and philosophy, and leads to his style of magical realism.  Translators  Labyrinths principal editor and translator is James Irby, Professor Emeritus at Princeton. Irby's work on Labyrinths includes the book's Introduction and translations of the stories Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote, The Circular Ruins, The Library of Babel, Funes the Memorious, Theme of the Traitor and the Hero, Three Versions of Judas, The Sect of the Phoenix, The Immortal, The Theologians, Story of the Warrior and the Captive, The House of Asterion, Averroes' Search, and The Waiting: fourteen titles in all, and by far the lion's share of the translation work for the book. The balance of the translations are by Donald A. Yates, Professor Emeritus of Spanish American literature at Michigan State University; John M. Fein, Professor Emeritus, Spanish, in the Department of Romance Languages at Duke University; Julian Palley (September 16, 1925 - December 20, 2014) of the University of California, Irvine; and author and prize-winning translator Harriet de On√≠s. Publication information Originally published by New Directions Publishing, * Original paperback: * Re- issue: , with introduction by William Gibson There is also a Modern Library hardcover edition, .  Reception  On the book's release, the journalist Mildred Adams at The New York Times wrote of it, \\"The translations, made by various hands, are not only good they are downright enjoyable. They make it finally possible, after all these years, to give Borges his due and to add North Americans to his wide public.\\" In 2012, the novelist Jake Arnott observed in The Independent, \\"Like many of my generation, I first encountered him in the Penguin edition of Labyrinths, a collection of stories, essays, parables and poetry. An excellent compendium, it's a sort of collection of collections which I find a little frustrating (although it mirrors his theme of recursiveness). More recently, there has been the reissue of all of his short stories: Collected Fictions, translated by Andrew Hurley. But this new translation, commissioned by his estate after his death, has proved controversial. The battle over Borges's legacy in English has become as Daedalian as one of his faux literary essays. It's hard to know where to begin rereading.\\" The essayist Alberto Manguel writes in The Guardian that, \\"since the first American translations of Borges, attempted in the Fifties by well- intentioned admirers such as Donald Yates and James Irby, English-speaking readers have been very poorly served. From the uneven versions collected in Labyrinths to the more meticulous, but ultimately unsuccessful, editions published by Norman Thomas di Giovanni, from Ruth Simm's abominable apery of 'Other Inquisitions' to Paul Bowles's illiterate rendition of 'The Circular Ruins', Borges in English must be read in spite of the translations.\\"  Awards  In 2008 the London Society of Authors selected Labyrinths as one of the fifty outstanding translations from the last fifty years.

The company was acquired by ATI in February 2000 for $400 million. This led to ATI's greatly improved R300 graphics chip family. Yen later joined ATI's board of directors. With Nintendo, Yen cofounded another company iQue, the manufacturing and distributing arm of Nintendo for mainland China. Yen founded iGware, a company that offers cloud computing services to its customers, including Nintendo. iGware's cloud services power the online services of the Nintendo DS, the Nintendo 3DS, the Nintendo Wii, and the Nintendo Wii U. In July 2011, Acer, of which Yen is a former board member, acquired the US-based iGware for $320 million, and thus iGware becomes a part of Acer's company structure in providing cloud services. iGware changed its name to Acer Cloud Technology Co. and continued to be headed by Yen. As a result of the acquisition, Yen is the second largest shareholder of Acer after founder Stan Shih. Yen is currently the chairman and founder of AiLive, the company that partnered with Nintendo in developing software tools for programmers working with the Wii Remote controller and Wii MotionPlus attachment. Yen has been on the board of several prominent companies including Acer, ATI, MoSys, and others.

Their style was a mixture of jazz, psychedelic rock and progressive rock with an influence of music from India. Career The original line-up included Sambhu Babaji (bass guitar), Maha Dev (rhythm guitar), Shiva Shankar Jones (vocals, keyboards, percussion), Jake Milton (drums, percussion), Allan Mostert (lead guitar), and Raja Ram (flute, percussion). Jones, an Australian, had been Phil Jones and with his Sydney band The Unknown Blues had a hit with \\"If I Had a Ticket\\" in 1967. They rehearsed in All Saints Hall which was a converted church near Portobello Road, and recorded three albums for Island Records between 1969 and 1971, with two further albums recorded in 1972 for RCA. The first of the latter set, Self, featured studio material on side one, with the band recorded playing live at Exeter University, on 11 December 1971, on side two. They built a reputation on solid club work. Besides appearing at the first two Glastonbury Festivals (then called 'Fayres'), in 1970/71, they also were invited to play the Montreux Jazz Festival. On 18 September 1971, Quintessence played a benefit concert for Bangladesh at The Oval, Kennington. They appeared on a bill that included The Who, Mott the Hoople, Lindisfarne, Atomic Rooster, The Grease Band and America. Although Quintessence played many hundreds of concerts and festivals all over Europe, they turned down a U.S. record deal negotiated by Island Records' Chris Blackwell and did not play at a concert at New York's Carnegie Hall lined up in early 1972, or tour the U.S., because four of the band's members wanted a larger monetary advance. This disappointed Blackwell and he dropped the band from the record label. Quintessence then signed with RCA and recorded one album with Jones and Dev. Raja Ram then unexpectedly 'fired' the pair after that album was released. Jones and Dev went on to form the short-lived outfit called Kala, along with Davey 'Crabsticks' Trotter. Meanwhile, Quintessence played on into the 1980s before breaking up. Later activities Jones, the primary composer of Quintessence, has been extensively touring throughout the United States for the last 20 years. Jones has released numerous recordings of both new material and updated versions of Quintessence songs with his Swiss musical partner, Ralph Rudra Beauvert, via their band Shiva's Quintessence. As of 2014, Jones is performing in the U.S. with Boston-based guitarist Frank M Evans, as Trans- Portal, expressing many of the Quintessence songs in a more intimate and acoustic format. In 2010, Maha Dev's new Quintessence were invited by Michael Eavis to play the 40th Anniversary Glastonbury Festival, where they were joined by original vocalist Jones. Produced by John Barham, Quintessence's previous producer, this performance was recorded and released as Rebirth: Live At Glastonbury in 2011. The reunion of Phil Shiva Jones with Dev's Quintessence for the 2010 Glastonbury Festival was documented in a BBC One Inside Out programme which was aired in November 2010. Maha Dev's Quintessence continued to perform sporadically in the UK recreating the 'classic' Island Records era Quintessence sound. Dev released his first solo album, and Jones' Quintessence continues to record sporadically. Jake Milton went on to form Blurt with his brother Ted Milton. Raja Ram went on to help create the psytrance style of electronic music in the 1990s, and continues to produce electronic music to this day, being most well known for his involvement in Shpongle.

Cancer research ranges from epidemiology, molecular bioscience to the performance of clinical trials to evaluate and compare applications of the various cancer treatments. These applications include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy and combined treatment modalities such as chemo- radiotherapy. Starting in the mid-1990s, the emphasis in clinical cancer research shifted towards therapies derived from biotechnology research, such as cancer immunotherapy and gene therapy. Cancer research is done in academia, research institutes, and corporate environments, and is largely government funded.  History  Cancer research has been ongoing for centuries. Early research focused on the causes of cancer. Percivall Pott identified the first environmental trigger (chimney soot) for cancer in 1775 and cigarette smoking was identified as a cause of lung cancer in 1950. Early cancer treatment focused on improving surgical techniques for removing tumors. Radiation therapy took hold in the 1900s. Chemotherapeutics were developed and refined throughout the 20th century. The U.S. declared a \\"War on Cancer\\" in the 1970s, and increased the funding and support for cancer research.  Seminal papers  Some of the most highly cited and most influential research reports include: *The Hallmarks of Cancer, published in 2000, and Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation, published in 2011, by Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg. Together, these articles have been cited in over 30,000 published papers.  Types of research  Cancer research encompasses a variety of types and interdisciplinary areas of research. Scientists involved in cancer research may be trained in areas such as chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, medical physics, epidemiology, and biomedical engineering. Research performed on a foundational level is referred to as basic research and is intended to clarify scientific principles and mechanisms. Translational research aims to elucidate mechanisms of cancer development and progression and transform basic scientific findings into concepts that can be applicable to the treatment and prevention of cancer. Clinical research is devoted to the development of pharmaceuticals, surgical procedures, and medical technologies for the eventual treatment of patients.  Prevention and epidemiology  Cause and development of cancer  Numerous cell signaling pathways are disrupted in the development of cancer. Research into the cause of cancer involves many different disciplines including genetics, diet, environmental factors (i.e. chemical carcinogens). In regard to investigation of causes and potential targets for therapy, the route used starts with data obtained from clinical observations, enters basic research, and, once convincing and independently confirmed results are obtained, proceeds with clinical research, involving appropriately designed trials on consenting human subjects, with the aim to test safety and efficiency of the therapeutic intervention method. An important part of basic research is characterization of the potential mechanisms of carcinogenesis, in regard to the types of genetic and epigenetic changes that are associated with cancer development. The mouse is often used as a mammalian model for manipulation of the function of genes that play a role in tumor formation, while basic aspects of tumor initiation, such as mutagenesis, are assayed on cultures of bacteria and mammalian cells. = Genes involved in cancer = The goal of oncogenomics is to identify new oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that may provide new insights into cancer diagnosis, predicting clinical outcome of cancers, and new targets for cancer therapies. As the Cancer Genome Project stated in a 2004 review article, \\"a central aim of cancer research has been to identify the mutated genes that are causally implicated in oncogenesis (cancer genes).\\" The Cancer Genome Atlas project is a related effort investigating the genomic changes associated with cancer, while the COSMIC cancer database documents acquired genetic mutations from hundreds of thousands of human cancer samples. These large scale projects, involving about 350 different types of cancer, have identified ~130,000 mutations in ~3000 genes that have been mutated in the tumours. The majority occurred in 319 genes, of which 286 were tumour suppressor genes and 33 oncogenes. Several hereditary factors can increase the chance of cancer-causing mutations, including the activation of oncogenes or the inhibition of tumor suppressor genes. The functions of various onco- and tumor suppressor genes can be disrupted at different stages of tumor progression. Mutations in such genes can be used to classify the malignancy of a tumor. In later stages, tumors can develop a resistance to cancer treatment. The identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is important to understand tumor progression and treatment success. The role of a given gene in cancer progression may vary tremendously, depending on the stage and type of cancer involved.Vlahopoulos SA, Logotheti S, Mikas D, Giarika A, Gorgoulis V, Zoumpourlis V.The role of ATF-2 in oncogenesis\\" Bioessays 2008 Apr;30(4) 314-27. Detection Prompt detection of cancer is important, since it is usually more difficult to treat in later stages. Accurate detection of cancer is also important because false positives can cause harm from unnecessary medical procedures. Some screening protocols are currently not accurate (such as prostate-specific antigen testing). Others such as a colonoscopy or mammogram are unpleasant and as a result some patients may opt out. Active research is underway to address all these problems.  Treatment  Emerging topics of cancer treatment research include: *Anti-cancer vaccines **Oncophage **Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) is a prostate cancer vaccine * Newer forms of chemotherapy *Gene therapyChinese scientists to pioneer first human CRISPR trial *Photodynamic therapy *Radiation therapy *Reoviridae (Reolysin drug therapy) *Targeted therapy *Natural killer cells can induce immunological memory. Research is being developed to modify their action against cancer.  Research funding  Cancer research is funded by government grants, charitable foundations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. In the early 2000s, most funding for cancer research came from taxpayers and charities, rather than from corporations. In the US, less than 30% of all cancer research was funded by commercial researchers such as pharmaceutical companies. Per capita, public spending on cancer research by taxpayers and charities in the US was five times as much in 2002‚Äì03 as public spending by taxpayers and charities in the 15 countries that were full members of the European Union. As a percentage of GDP, the non-commercial funding of cancer research in the US was four times the amount dedicated to cancer research in Europe. Half of Europe's non- commercial cancer research is funded by charitable organizations. The National Cancer Institute is the major funding institution in the United States. In the 2016 fiscal year, the NCI funded $5.2 billion in cancer research.  Difficulties  Difficulties inherent to cancer research are shared with many types of biomedical research. Cancer research processes have been criticised. These include, especially in the US, for the financial resources and positions required to conduct research. Other consequences of competition for research resources appear to be a substantial number of research publications whose results cannot be replicated.Bruce Alberts, Marc W. Kirschnerb, Shirley Tilghmanc, and Harold Varmus, Rescuing US biomedical research from its systemic flaws , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 111 no. 16, April 2014Kendall Powell, Young, talented and fed-up: scientists tell their stories , Nature 538, pp. 446‚Äì449 (27 October 2016),  Public participation  One can share computer time for distributed cancer research projects like Help Conquer Cancer. World Community Grid also had a project called Help Defeat Cancer. Other related projects include the Folding@home and Rosetta@home projects, which focus on groundbreaking protein folding and protein structure prediction research. Members of the public can also join clinical trials as healthy control subjects or for methods of cancer detection.  Dominance of cancer research  MD Anderson Cancer Center is ranked as one of the top cancer research institutions.Cancer research has grown considerably as indicated by the number of records that have been indexed in the MEDLINE database, in the 1950s the proportion of cancer-related entries was approximately 6% of all entries and this has rose to 16% in 2016. This rise may be attributed to the impact of scientific advances such as genomics, computing and mathematics, which have had a stronger influence in Cancer than in other areas such as Cardiovascular conditions.  Organizations  Breast cancer awareness ribbon statue in Kentucky Organizations exist as associations for scientists participating in cancer research, such as the American Association for Cancer Research and American Society of Clinical Oncology, and as foundations for public awareness or raising funds for cancer research, such as Relay For Life and the American Cancer Society.  Awareness campaigns  Supporters of different types of cancer have adopted different colored awareness ribbons and promote months of the year as being dedicated to the support of specific types of cancer. The American Cancer Society began promoting October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month in the United States in the 1980s. Pink products are sold to both generate awareness and raise money to be donated for research purposes. This has led to pinkwashing, or the selling of ordinary products turned pink as a promotion for the company.

History  Although an Amerindian settlement has existed along the Kaituma River for some time, it was only after the discovery of manganese at nearby Matthew's Ridge that Port Kaituma was developed. As Matthew's Ridge was not located on a navigable river, a canal was cut from the Kaituma River and Port Kaituma was constructed. At the time of the manganese mining, Port Kaituma had three separate areas. The mine managers' house and the guest house were in a large clearing separated by a short road through the forest from the main rail-head and manganese loading facility. A longer road led in the opposite direction to the area known as 'Bottom Floor' where the workers lived. The manganese was transported from Matthew's Ridge via a 40-mile railway and then shipped from Port Kaituma to Chaguaramas Bay in Trinidad, from where it was distributed for industrial use with a large proportion going to Stavanger in Norway. The project was operated by subsidiaries of Union Carbide. Two Trinidadian oil tankers, the Ambrosio and the Inverrosa, were converted into manganese carriers as part of this project. They made the trip from Port Kaituma to Chaguaramas on a regular four-day cycle for much of the 1960s. With a displacement of just under 3,000 tons, they were originally built in the mid 1920s with a shallow draft to ship oil across shallow sand- bars at the mouth of Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela.http://www.aukevisser.nl/others/id306.htmhttp://www.aukevisser.nl/others/id574.htm The ability to slip over sand bars in very shallow water was essential to their being able to get across Waini Bar at the mouth of the Kaituma River. Port Kaituma's significance grew further following the proclamation from the then-President of Guyana, Forbes Burnham, that Guyana should become more self- sufficient by populating the interior of the country. Matthew's Ridge was highlighted as a potential new capital city, and within Port Kaituma a large secondary school was constructed to educate students sent from all over Guyana. During its heyday, the school boasted over 800 students, of which most were housed in two large dormitory buildings. In the 1970s, Jim Jones' commune of Jonestown was built only seven miles away from Port Kaituma. The first killings of the November 1978 Jonestown deaths occurred in Port Kaituma when Leo Ryan, a U.S. Congressman from California, and others were gunned down while boarding a small Twin Otter aircraft on the local airstrip. In the aftermath and clean-up operation that ensued, many items from the commune were acquired by the residents of Port Kaituma. Over the next 25 years, a large foreign-owned logging company came and went, the manganese factory at Matthew's Ridge ceased working and the railway linking Matthew's Ridge and Port Kaituma was closed and in some parts cut up. The school's importance diminished and fell into a state of disrepair. Today, Kaituma serves as the gateway to the nearby jungle where the now predominant industry of small-scale gold mining takes place. The transient nature of many of these porkknockers (gold miners) has led to problems of gun crime, robbery, murder and bribery in the unpoliced hinterlands. This however does not perturb a continual flow of workers through the town, including a recent influx of Brazilians.

The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Zibad, dates back to 500BCE. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the Nowruz, Chelah, or YaldƒÅ - the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years.

According to the history of Belazari Yazdegerd III was defeated in a war in province of Merv in the city of Gonabad. Nizak the army chief of Mahoe Suri in the Gonabad and according to the new research the war occurred in zibad of gonabad. Regardless, the death of Yazdegerd marked the end of the Sasanian Empire, and made it less difficult for the Arabs to conquer the rest of Iran. All of Khorasan was soon conquered by the Arabs, who would use it as a base to attack Transoxiana. The death of Yazdegerd thus marked the end of the last pre-Islamic Iranian empire after more than 400 years of rule. An empire‚Äìwhich had a generation earlier briefly conquered Egypt and Asia Minor, even reaching as a far as Constantinople, fell to a force of lightly equipped Arabs that were used to skirmishes and desert warfare. The heavy Sasanian cavalry was too sluggish and systematized to contain them; employed light-armed Arab or East Iranian mercenaries from Khorasan and Transoxiana would have been much more successful. Several different and contradictory narratives about the death of Yazdgerd III have been left in historical books. According to the excavations of Zibd-Gonabad Fortress and according to oral narrations and the report of Blazeri and Habib Abdolhai,Dr Ajam and Abas Zmani(historical study magazin 1974) it seems that the narration related to the murder of Yazdgerd in Merw Mill is more mythical than the truth and what is closer to the truth is the narration of Al- Baladhuri in Kitab Futuh al-Buldan. that yazdgerd was killed in Gonabad .The main text of Blazeri's book The Fate of Yazdgerd III: Then he went to Khorasan, then he went to Janabad (Gonabad) he was welcomed and ruler of merv send Nizak Trkhan to welcom him in gonabad. but after weeks he asked the emperor to marry his daughter and the emperor refused and this caused a war and at the end Nizak attacked and defeated the king army and Destroyed and captured the remnants of the imperial forces. the battle was occurred in zibad gonabad.ŸÅÿ™Ÿàÿ≠‚ÄåÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÑÿØÿßŸÜÿåAl-Baladhuri in Kitab Futuh al-Buldan p569 ÿµÿµ €µ€∂€∏‚Äì€µ€∂€π Mahoe Suri was probably from the House of Suren, one of the seven Parthian clans of the Sasanian state.

Famous Monsters of Filmland directly inspired the creation of many other similar publications, including Castle of Frankenstein, Cinefantastique, Fangoria, The Monster Times, and Video Watchdog. In addition, hundreds, if not thousands, of FM-influenced horror, fantasy and science fiction movie-related fanzines have been produced, some of which have continued to publish for decades, such as Midnight Marquee and Little Shoppe of Horrors. Publication history=1958‚Äì1983 Famous Monsters of Filmland was originally conceived as a one-shot publication by Warren and Ackerman, published in the wake of the widespread success of the Shock Theater package of old horror movies syndicated to American television in 1957.\\"Shock\\" But the first issue, published in February 1958, was so successful that it required a second printing to fulfill public demand. Its future as part of American culture was immediately obvious to both men. The success prompted spinoff magazines such as Spacemen, Favorite Westerns of Filmland, Screen Thrills Illustrated, Creepy, Eerie, and Vampirella. FM offered brief articles, well-illustrated with publicity stills and graphic artwork, on horror movies from the silent era to the current date of publication, their stars and filmmakers. Warren and Ackerman decided to aim the text at late pre-adolescents and young teenagers. In the pages of FM, Forrest J Ackerman promoted the memory of Lon Chaney Sr., whose silent works were mostly beyond the accessibility of fans for most of the magazine's life, but were a great influence on his own childhood. He also introduced film fans to science fiction fandom through direct references, first-person experiences, and adoption of fandom terms and customs. The magazine regularly published photos from King Kong (1933), including one from the film's infamous \\"spider pit sequence\\", featured in Issue #108 (1974) still from the lost spider pit sequence still from the lost spider pit sequence which, until Ackerman discovered a photo of a spider in the cavern setting, had never been proven definitively to have actually been filmed.\\"King Kong Urban Legends\\" FM's peak years were from its first issues through the late 1960s, when the disappearance of the older films from television and the decline of talent in the imaginative film industry left it with a dearth of subject matter acceptable to both editor and fan. Warren and Ackerman created a jump in issue numbering from issue 69, which was printed in September 1970, to issue 80 in October 1970. They did this (according to the editorial in issue 80) because it brought them closer to issue 100, justifying the numerical jump because of the publishing of ten issues of the short-lived companion magazine Monster World as issues that \\"would have been\\" Famous Monsters issues. During the 1970s, the magazine came to rely heavily on reprints of articles from the 1960s. In November 1974 and November 1975, New York City was host to the \\"Famous Monsters Convention,\\" a fan convention centered on FM, which featured such guests as Forrest J Ackerman, Verne Langdon, James Warren, Peter Cushing, Ingrid Pitt, Barbara Leigh, Catherine Lorre, Cal Floyd, and Sam Sherman. (A similar gathering was held in 1995 in Los Angeles, with such guests as Maila Nurmi, Ray Harryhausen, John Landis, Joe Dante, Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, Curt Siodmak, Adam West, John Agar, Les Tremayne, Angus Scrimm, William Schallert, and Al Lewis.)Kipen, David. \\"A Frightful Gathering of Movie Monsters,\\" L.A. Daily News (25 May 1995): L.7. In the early 1980s, the magazine folded after Warren became ill and unable to carry on as publisher, and Ackerman resigned as editor in the face of the increasing disorganization within the leaderless Warren Publishing Company. The magazine stopped publication in 1983 after a run of 191 issues. Monsterland (1984-1987) After Famous Monsters of Filmland ceased publication in 1983, Ackerman was coaxed into briefly resuming his title as editor of a horror-oriented magazine with Forrest J Ackerman's MONSTER LAND (with the official publication title inside as one all-caps word- \\"MONSTERLAND\\", and then \\"Monsterland\\" from 1986 onward) by Hal Schuster of New Media Publishing, which began publication in December 1984.Ackerman, Forrest J. \\"Editorial,\\" Forrest J Ackerman's Monsterland #1 p. 3 (February 1985) After two fill-in editorials by Ackerman as \\"Editor & Chief\\" (beginning with issue #10 /1986), the cover title Forrest J Ackerman's MONSTER LAND was shortened to MONSTER LAND, and Ackerman's title changed to \\"Editor Emeritus\\" (with James Van Hise assigned as \\"Editor\\"). Inside that issue, host character \\"Evila\\" states that \\"Forry [had] moved on.\\"\\"Evila\\". \\"Editorial,\\" Monsterland #10 (June 1986), p. 2. After the end of New Media Publishing in 1985, beginning with issue #10 the magazine was published by a new Schuster publishing entity, Movieland Publishing, Inc., until the final issue, #17 (summer 1987). Revival (1993‚Äì2008) Famous Monsters of Filmland was resurrected in 1993 by New Jersey portrait photographer and monster movie fan Ray Ferry. After finding that the Famous Monsters of Filmland title had not been \\"maintained\\" under law, Ferry filed for \\"intent to use\\" for the magazine's trademark, unbeknownst to Ackerman or the trademark's owner and creator, Jim Warren. Ferry, poised to restart publication of FM on a quarterly basis, offered Ackerman the position of editor-in-chief for a fee of $2,500 per issue, which he accepted. Starting at issue #200, the new Famous Monsters acquired subscribers and over-the-counter buyers who believed they would be reunited with Ackerman in print. While Ferry tried to maintain Ackerman's style in his own writings, he heavily edited and rejected contributions from the man himself. In an effort to help Ferry finance his full-time efforts on behalf of FM, Ackerman agreed to a reduced editor's fee of $1,500 per issue. With four consecutive unpaid issues and a continued rejection of his work, Ackerman resigned from his position. Aside from removing Ackerman's name from the masthead, Ferry did not inform FM readers that they were no longer reading material by, or authorized by, Ackerman. Instead, Ferry infused his writing with Ackerman's trademark puns, and mimicked his writing style, which led to legal action brought forth by Ackerman. =Libel lawsuit= In 1997, Ackerman filed a civil lawsuit against Ferry for libel, breach of contract, and misrepresentation; Ferry had publicly claimed that Ackerman's only connection with the new FM was as a hired hand and that Ferry ‚Äúhad to let Forry go‚Äù because he was no longer writing or editing for the magazine. Ferry also claimed rights to pen names and other personal properties of Ackerman. On May 11, 2000, the Los Angeles Superior Court jury decided in Ackerman's favor and awarded him $382,500 in compensatory damages and $342,000 in punitive damages. This verdict was appealed by Ferry, but the verdict was upheld by the Appellate Court of California, on November 12, 2002. With judgments in Ackerman's favor, Ferry filed for bankruptcy. As of mid-2007, Ferry had been allowed to continue to publish issues of FM due to lack of efforts on the part of bankruptcy trustees and Ackerman's lawyers to force the sale of the trademark or personal assets attached to his income. Ferry had also failed to pay any of the $720,000-plus cash judgment against him. 2008 to present In late 2007, Philip Kim, an entrepreneur and a private equity investor, purchased the rights to the logo and title, entering into an agreement with Ackerman to use his trademarks to retain the magazine's original look and feel. The new Famous Monsters of Filmland website was launched in May 2008 and on December 7, 2009, Kim announced the magazine's return to print. Ackerman died just before midnight on Thursday, December 4, 2008. The revival of the classic horror magazine came in July 2010, with the publication of Famous Monsters of Filmland #251 at the Famous Monster Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana. The success of the print magazine at the Famous Monster Convention and Comic-Con International in San Diego yielded the announcement of the magazine's expansion in distribution and circulation into major bookstore chains and independent retailers throughout North America and select markets in the US, Canada, and UK. Publisher Movieland Classics, LLC announced concurrently that the magazine would be entering into a bi-monthly publication schedule to meet the significant increase in requests from readers beginning with Issue 253. As executive editor of the magazine, Ed Blair steered FM starting with Issue 256 in 2011 through issue 282 in 2015, which saw the transition of editorial leadership go to David Weiner, a 13-year veteran of the syndicated television program Entertainment Tonight. Weiner held the position through Issue 288.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXhpqnt3pjghttps://muckrack.com/DWJournalism In 2015, Famous Monsters launched American Gothic Press, a comic book publishing imprint, marking their first foray into comics since Forrest Ackerman co-created Vampirella. The magazine won the Rondo Hatton Award for Best Classic Magazine in 2015 and 2016 under executive editor David A. Weiner. Weiner also received a Rondo Hatton Award for Best Interview of the Year in 2015, for his Famous Monsters interview with Mel Brooks for the 40th anniversary of Young Frankenstein. In 2017, Famous Monsters transitioned to an annual print format with Issue 289, which saw longtime associate editor Holly Interlandi take the position of executive editor. Pop-culture connections In April 1981, the punk band The Misfits began using the magazine's distinctive logo font on most albums, T-shirts, and other associated promotional materials. In 1999, The Misfits released an album named Famous Monsters. In his 2000 non-fiction book On Writing, Stephen King describes his own history with Ackerman's work and calls Famous Monsters of Filmland a life- changing publication, adding: \\"Ask anyone who has been associated with the fantasy‚Äìhorror‚Äìscience fiction genres in the last thirty years about this magazine, and you‚Äôll get a laugh, a flash of the eyes, and a stream of bright memories‚ÄîI practically guarantee it.\\" http://biblioteka.teatr- obraz.ru/files/file/English_cinema/Stephen_King_On_Writing.pdf Famous Monsters was mentioned by Billy Bob Thornton in an infamous 2009 interview with host Jian Ghomeshi on the CBC Radio One program Q. Thornton, upset by Ghomeshi's mentioning his career in the film industry during the interview with The Boxmasters, became non-responsive before relating a long story of how he read and entered a contest sponsored by FM when he was a boy. The Sci-Fi Boys, a 2006 documentary by Paul Davids, focuses heavily on Famous Monsters and Forrest J Ackerman. The film features interviews with Ackerman and several of the current top names in the science fiction genre, including Peter Jackson and Rick Baker, who attest to the influence of the magazine and of Ackerman himself. Writer and filmmaker Jason V. Brock created The Ackermonster Chronicles!, a 2012 documentary about Ackerman. The film has been shown at several venues (including a special screening at Loscon 39 in Los Angeles), and been critically well received in magazines such as Fangoria, Scary Monsters, and VideoScope. The movie is billed as the definitive film about Ackerman's life and cultural influence, and features in-depth interviews with Ackerman, Ray Bradbury, John Landis, Greg Bear, Richard Matheson, Dan O'Bannon, Ray Harryhausen, David J.

He was also the father of John Wesley and Charles Wesley, founders of Methodism. Family and early life Interior of St Andrew, Epworth: The Wesley Family Tree. Samuel Wesley was the second son of Rev. John Westley or Wesley, rector of Winterborne Whitechurch, Dorset. His mother was the daughter of John White, rector of Trinity Church, Dorchester, the so-called \\"Patriarch of Dorchester\\". Following some grammar school education in Dorchester, Wesley was sent away from home to prepare for ministerial training under Theophilus Gale. Gale's death in 1678 forestalled this plan; instead, he attended another grammar school and then studied at dissenting academies under Edward Veel in Stepney and then Charles Morton in Newington Green, where Gale had lived. Daniel Defoe also attended Morton's school, situated \\"probably on the site of the current Unitarian church\\",The Village that Changed the World: A History of Newington Green London N16 by Alex Allardyce. Newington Green Action Group: 2008. p7. contemporaneously with Wesley. Samuel resigned his place and his annual scholarship among the Dissenters and walked all the way to Oxford, where he enrolled at Exeter College as a \\"poor scholar.\\" He functioned as a \\"servitor\\", which means he sustained himself financially by waiting upon wealthy students. He also published a small book of poems, entitled Maggots: or Poems on Several Subjects never before Handled in 1685. The unusual title is explained in a few lines from the first page of the work: {align=\\"center\\"  In his own defense the author writes Because when the foul maggot bites He ne'er can rest in quiet: Which makes him make so sad a face He'd beg your worship or your grace Unsight, unseen, to buy it } Wesley married Susanna Annesley in 1688. He fathered among others Samuel (the younger), Mehetabel, John and Charles Wesley. He had 19 children, nine of whom died in infancy. Three boys and seven girls survived. In 1697 he was appointed to the living at Epworth through the benevolence of Queen Mary. He may have come to the queen's attention because of his heroic poem, \\"The Life of Christ\\" (1693) which he dedicated to her. Wesley's high-church liturgies, academic proclivities, and loyalist Tory politics were a complete mismatch for those of his illiterate parishioners. He was not warmly received, and his ministry was not widely appreciated. Wesley was soon deep in debt and much of his life would be spent trying to make financial ends meet. In 1709 his parsonage was destroyed by fire and son John was barely rescued from the flames.Tyson, John. Assist Me to Proclaim. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2008. Career His poetic career began in 1685 with the publication of Maggots, a collection of juvenile verses on trivial subjects, the preface to which apologizes to the reader because the book is neither grave nor gay. The poems appear to be an attempt to prove that poetic language can create beauty out of the most revolting subject. The first poem, \\"On a Maggot\\", is composed in hudibrastics, with a diction obviously Butlerian, and it is followed by facetious poetic dialogues and by Pindarics of the Cowleian sort but on such subjects as \\"On the Grunting of a Hog.\\" In 1688 Wesley took his B.A, at Exeter College, Oxford, following which he became a naval chaplain and, in 1690, rector of South Ormsby. In 1694 he took his MA from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, and the following year he became rector of Epworth. During the run of the Athenian Gazette (1691‚Äì1697) he joined with Richard Sault and John Norris in assisting John Dunton, the promoter of the undertaking. His second venture in poetry, the Life of Our Blessed Lord and Saviour, an epic largely in heroic couplets with a prefatory discourse on heroic poetry, appeared in 1693, was reissued in 1694, and was honored with a second edition in 1697. In 1695 he dutifully came forward with Elegies, lamenting the deaths of Queen Mary II and Archbishop Tillotson. An Epistle to a Friend concerning Poetry (1700) was followed by at least four other volumes of verse, the last of which was issued in 1717. His poetry appears to have had readers on a certain level, but it stirred up little pleasure among wits, writers, or critics. Judith Drake confessed that she was lulled to sleep by Blackmore's Prince Arthur and by Wesley's \\"heroics\\" (Essay in Defence of the Female Sex, 1696, p. 50). And he was satirized as a mere poetaster in Garth's Dispensary, in Swift's The Battle of the Books, and in the earliest issues of the Dunciad. Controversy For a few years in the early eighteenth century Wesley found himself in the vortex of controversy. Brought up in the dissenting tradition, he had swerved into conformity at some point during the 1680s, possibly under the influence of Tillotson, whom he greatly admired (cf. Epistle to a Friend, pp. 5‚Äì6). In 1702 there appeared his Letter from a Country Divine to his friend in London concerning the education of dissenters in their private academies, apparently written about 1693. This attack upon dissenting academies was published at an unfortunate time, when the public mind was inflamed by the intolerance of overzealous churchmen. Wesley was furiously answered; he replied in A Defence of a Letter (1704), and again in A Reply to Mr. Palmer's Vindication (1707). It is scarcely to Wesley's credit that in this quarrel he stood shoulder to shoulder with that most hot-headed of all contemporary bigots, Henry Sacheverell. His prominence in the controversy earned him the ironic compliments of Daniel Defoe, who recalled that our \\"Mighty Champion of this very High-Church Cause\\" had once written a poem to satirize frenzied Tories (Review, II, no. 87, 22 September 1705). About a week later, Defoe, having got wind of a collection being taken up for Wesley - who in consequence of a series of misfortunes was badly in debt - intimated that High-Church pamphleteering had turned out very profitably for both Lesley and Wesley (2 October 1705). But in such snarling and bickering Wesley was out of his element, and he seems to have avoided future quarrels. His literary criticism is small in bulk. But though it is neither brilliant nor well written (Wesley apparently composed at a break-neck clip), it is not without interest. Pope observed in 1730 that he was a \\"learned\\" man (letter to Swift, in Works, ed. Elwin-Courthope, VII, 184). The observation was correct, but it should be added that Wesley matured at the end of an age famous for its great learning, an age whose most distinguished poet was so much the scholar that he appeared more the pedant than the gentleman to critics of the succeeding era; Wesley was not singular for erudition among his seventeenth-century contemporaries. \\"Essay on Heroic Poetry\\" Engraving of Wesley by George Vertue (1732). The Essay on Heroic Poetry, serving as Preface to The Life of Our Blessed Lord and Saviour, reveals something of its author's erudition. Among the critics, he was familiar with Aristotle, Horace, Longinus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Heinsius, Bochart, Balzac, Rapin, Le Bossu, and Boileau. But this barely hints at the extent of his learning. In the notes on the poem itself the author displays an interest in classical scholarship, Biblical commentary, ecclesiastical history, scientific inquiry, linguistics and philology, British antiquities, and research into the history, customs, architecture, and geography of the Holy Land; he shows, an intimate acquaintance with Grotius, Henry Hammond, Joseph Mede, Spanheim, Sherlock, Lightfoot, and Gregory, with Philo, Josephus, Fuller, Walker, Camden, and Athanasius Kircher; and he shows an equal readiness to draw upon Ralph Cudworth's True Intellectual System and Robert Boyle's new theories concerning the nature of light. In view of such a breadth of knowledge it is somewhat surprising to find him quoting as extensively as he does in the \\"Essay\\" from Le Bossu and Rapin, and apparently leaning heavily upon them. The \\"Essay\\" was composed at a time when the prestige of Rymer and neo-Aristotelianism in England was already declining, and though Wesley expressed some admiration for Rapin and Le Bossu, he is by no means docile under their authority. Whatever the weight of authority, he says, \\"I see no cause why Poetry should not be brought to the Test [of reason], as well as Divinity....\\" As to the sacred example of Homer, who based his great epic on mythology, Wesley remarks, \\"But this [mythology] being now antiquated, I cannot think we are oblig'd superstitiously to follow his Example, any more than to make Horses speak, as he does that of Achilles.\\" To the question of the formidable Boileau, \\"What Pleasure can it be to hear the howlings of repining Lucifer?\\" our critic responds flippantly,\\"I think 'tis easier to answer than to find out what shew of Reason he had for asking it, or why Lucifer mayn't howl as pleasantly as either Cerberus, or Knoeladus.\\" Without hesitation or apology he takes issue with Rapin's conception of Decorum in the epic. But Wesley is empiricist as well as rationalist, and the judgment of authority can be upset by appeal to the court of experience. To Balzac's suggestion that, to avoid difficult and local proper names in poetry, generalized terms be used, such as Ill-luck for the Fates and the Foul Fiend for Lucifer, our critic replies with jaunty irony, \\"... and whether this wou'd not sound extremely Heroical, I leave any Man to judge\\", and thus he dismisses the matter. Similarly, when Rapin objects to Tasso's mingling of lyric softness in the majesty of the epic, Wesley points out sharply that no man of taste will part with the fine scenes of tender love in Tasso, Dryden, Ovid, Ariosto, and Spenser \\"for the sake of a fancied Regularity.\\" He had set out to defend the Biblical epic, the Christian epic, and the propriety of Christian machines in epic, and no rules or authority could deter him. As good an example as any of his independence of mind can be seen In a note on Bk. I, apropos of the poet's use of obsolete words (Life of Our Blessed Lord, 1697, p. 27): It may be in vicious imitation of Milton and Spenser, he says in effect, but I have a fondness for old words, they please my ear, and that is all the reason I can give for employing them. Wesley's resistance to a strict application of authority and the rules grew partly out of the rationalistic and empirical temper of Englishmen in his age, but it also sprang from his learning. From various sources he drew the theory that Greek and Latin were but corrupted forms of ancient Phoenician, and that the degeneracy of Greek and Latin in turn had produced all, or most, of the present European tongues (ibid., p. 354). In addition, he believed that the Greeks had derived some of their thought from older civilizations, and specifically that Plato had received many of his notions from the Jews (ibid., p. 230)‚Äîan idea which recalls the argument that Dryden in Religio Laioi had employed against the deists, furthermore, he had, like many of his learned contemporaries, a profound respect for Hebrew culture and the sublimity of the Hebrew scriptures, going so far as to remark in the \\"Essay on Heroic Poetry\\" that \\"most, even of [the heathen poets'] beat Fancies and Images, as well as Names, were borrow'd from the Antient Hebrew Poetry and Divinity.\\" In short, however faulty his particular conclusions, he had arrived at an historical viewpoint, from which it was no longer possible to regard the classical standards‚Äîmuch less the standards of French critics‚Äîas having the holy sanction of Nature herself. Literary tastes Some light is shed on the literary tastes of his period by Epistle to a friend concerning poetry (1700) and the Essay on Heroic Poetry (1697), which with a few exceptions were in accord with the prevailing current. The Life of Our Blessed Lord shows strongly the influence of Cowley's Davideis. Wesley's great admiration persisted after the tide had turned away from Cowley; and his liking for the \\"divine Herbert\\" and for Crashaw represented the tastes of sober and unfashionable readers. Although he professed unbounded admiration for Homer as the greatest genius in nature, in practise he seemed more inclined to follow the lead of Cowley, Virgil, and Vida. Although there was much in Ariosto that he enjoyed, he preferred Tasso; the irregularities in both, however, he felt bound to deplore. To Spenser's Faerie Queene he allowed extraordinary merit. If the plan of it was noble, he thought, and the mark of a comprehensive genius, yet the action of the poem seemed confused. Nevertheless, like Prior later, Wesley was inclined to suspend judgment on this point because the poem had been left incomplete. To Spenser's \\"thoughts\\" he paid the highest tribute, and to his \\"Expressions flowing natural and easie, with such a prodigious Poetical Copia as never any other must expect to enjoy.\\" Like most of the Augustans Wesley did not care greatly for Paradise Regained, but he partly atoned by his praise for Paradise Lost, which was an \\"original\\" and therefore \\"above the common Rules.\\" Though defective in its action, it was resplendent with sublime thoughts perhaps superior to any in Virgil or Homer, and full of incomparable and exquisitely moving passages. In spite of his belief that Milton's blank verse was a mistake, making for looseness and incorrectness, he borrowed lines and images from it, and in Bk. IV of The Life of Our Blessed Lord he incorporated a whole passage of Milton's blank verse in the midst of his heroic couplets. Wesley's attitude toward Dryden deserves a moment's pause. In the \\"Essay on Heroic Poetry\\" he observed that a speech of Satan's in Paradise Lost is nearly equalled in Dryden's State of Innocence. Later in the same essay he credited a passage in Dryden's King Arthur with showing an improvement upon Tasso. There is no doubt as to his vast respect for the greatest living poet, but his remarks do not indicate that he ranked Dryden with Virgil, Tasso, or Milton; for he recognized as well as we that the power to embellish and to imitate successfully does not constitute the highest excellence in poetry. In the Epistle to a Friend he affirmed his admiration for Dryden's matchless style, his harmony, his lofty strains, his youthful fire, and even his wit‚Äîin the main, qualities of style and expression. But by 1700 Wesley had absorbed enough of the new puritanism that was rising in England to qualify his praise; now he deprecated the looseness and indecency of the poetry, and called upon the poet to repent. One other point calls for comment. Wesley's scheme for Christian machinery in the epic, as described in the \\"Essay on Heroic Poetry\\", is remarkably similar to Dryden's. Dryden's had appeared in the essay on satire prefaced to his translation of Juvenal, published late in October 1692; Wesley's scheme appeared soon after June 1693. The Epistle to a Friend concerning Poetry is neither startling nor contemptible; it has, in fact, much more to say than the rhymed treatises on verse by Roscommon and Mulgrave. Its remarks on Genius are fresh, though tantalizing in their brevity, and it defends the Moderns with both neatness and energy. Much of its advice is cautious and commonplace‚Äîbut such was the tradition of the poetical treatise on verse. Appearing within two years of Collier's first attack upon the stage, it reinforces some of that worthy's contentions, but we are not aware of its having had much effect.  Theology  Samuel Wesley held Anglican Arminianism views. The Arminian Hugo Grotius, was his favorite biblical commentator. Through his sermons, he demonstrated beliefs in the tenets of Arminianism and especially in its distinctive Prevenient grace.

The head of a convent of nuns is called a hegumenia or ihumenia (). The term means \\"the one who is in charge\\", \\"the leader\\" in Greek. Initially the title was applied to the head of any monastery. After 1874, when the Russian monasteries were secularized and classified into three classes, the title of hegumen was reserved only for the lowest, third class. The head of a monastery of the second or first class holds the rank of archimandrite. In the Greek Catholic Church, the head of all monasteries in a certain territory is called the protohegumen. The duties of both hegumen and archimandrite are the same, archimandrite being considered the senior dignity of the two. In the Russian Orthodox Church the title of Hegumen may be granted as an honorary title to any hieromonk, even one who does not head a monastery. \\"Family Tree of the Solovetsky Monastery\\". A hand-drawn lubok listing the names of the monastery's hegumens (1870s). A ruling hegumen is formally installed in a ceremony by the bishop, during which he is presented with his pastoral staff (Greek: paterissa, Slavonic: –ø–∞–ª–∏—Ü–∞, palitza). Among the Russians, the pastoral staff for a Hegumen tends to be of wood (usually ebony), rather than metal. The hegumen is awarded the gold pectoral cross by the bishop, as for an archpriest. During divine services the hegumen wears a simple black monastic mantle, while the higher ranking archimandrite wears a mantle similar to one worn by a bishop (though without the white \\"rivers\\" along the sides, and decorated with unadorned \\"tablets\\" at the neck and feet). An archimandrite also wears a mitre similar to one worn by a bishop; a hegumen does not (however, in the Russian tradition, a bishop may grant an hegumen the privilege of wearing the mitre as an ecclesiastical award). A hegumen may carry his pastoral staff in processions and when giving blessings in the church (though it is never carried into the sanctuary), although it usually stands upright next to his kathisma (monastic choir stall). When outside the church, a hegumen may use a wooden walking stick similar to that used by a bishop or archimandrite, only not adorned with a silver knob. In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria the rank is used in the capacity of an archpriest and actually is one. The name in the Arabic is Kommos (ŸÇŸÖÿµ), which is in turn a derivation of the Greek Ighoumenos and this honorary title is granted to both married priests and hieromonks without distinction and is not used in the capacity of an Abbot, although the monasteries' abbots used to be Hegumen until the beginning of the 20th century, but by the mid century, the Church of Alexandria started to appoint Bishops in the capacity of Abbots. On the other hand, the rank of archimandrite fell into disuse in the Church of Alexandria from the late 16th century.

It is a \\"painful novel about obsessive imaginary love\\". Composition Highsmith dedicated the novel to her mother Mary: \\"To my mother\\". Synopsis Scientist David Kelsey is infatuated with Annabelle, with whom he had a short relationship before moving away to take a job. David hopes the job will allow him to earn enough money to marry Annabelle. However, the two never actually discussed marriage and, while David is away, Annabelle marries another man named Gerald. Unable to accept the turn of events and move on, David begins laboring under the increasingly self-deluding hope that Annabelle will leave her new husband. Under the assumed identity of William Neumeister, a freelance journalist who frequently travels, David buys a cabin in the country to serve as his eventual home with Annabelle. He furnishes the house to her liking and spends weekends there, performing household routines as if he is doing everything for two. David sends letters, visits Annabelle's home and asks her to divorce Gerald even after she has had a son by him. Eventually, Gerald discovers David's house and arrives to confront the situation. The two men get into a scuffle which ends with Gerald falling and breaking his neck. David reports the death to the police, identifying himself as Neumeister and describing Gerald as a belligerent stranger who showed up at his door and, spoiling for a fight, was killed accidentally. Two of David's friends, Wes Carmichael and Effie Brennan, once secretly followed him to the house and, after the death of Gerald, suspect him of a duality about which they question him over time and with escalating incisiveness. Effie, being in love with David and hoping he will ultimately give up on Annabelle, often supports him at key points during his attempts to maintain his two identities. David builds a web of lies, betrayal and denial. Annabelle wants to meet Neumeister in order to learn more about the circumstances of her husband's death; David fends her off successfully. David secures a new job, sells his house, and buys a new one nearer to Annabelle under his own name. He repeats his intrusive behavior with her new beau, Grant. One weekend, David, who is beginning to occasionally lose touch with reality, invites Wes and Effie to visit in his new home. After some heavy drinking and quarreling, their relationships deteriorate rapidly, followed by more violence and David on the lam in New York City. There, he fantasizes that Annabelle is with him as they sight-see, shop and dine. When, in a restaurant, he is recognized as a wanted man, he imagines the two of them are fleeing together, but David's time has run out. Reception Writing in the New York Times, Anthony Boucher called the novel \\"an impressive psychological study\\". He wrote: Adaptations This Sweet Sickness was adapted in 1962 for an episode of the anthology television series The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.

Designated a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group and a Scheduled Tribe, they belong to the broader class of Andamanese people. Along with the Great Andamanese, the Jarawas, the Onge, the Shompen, and the Nicobarese, the Sentinelese are one of the six native and often reclusive peoples of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Unlike the others, the Sentinelese appear to have consistently refused any interaction with the outside world. They are hostile to outsiders and have killed people who approached or landed on the island. In 1956, the Government of India declared North Sentinel Island a tribal reserve and prohibited travel within of it. It further maintains a constant armed patrol to prevent intrusions by outsiders. Photography is prohibited. There is significant uncertainty as to the group's size, with estimates ranging between 15 and 500 individuals, but mostly between 50 and 200. Aerial photograph of North Sentinel Island Overview=Geography The Sentinelese live on North Sentinel Island in the Andaman Islands, which are in the Bay of Bengal and administered by India. The island lies off the southwest coast of South Andaman Island, about west of Andaman capital Port Blair. It has an area of about and a roughly square outline. The seashore is about wide, bordered by a littoral forest that gives way to a dense tropical evergreen forest. The island is surrounded by coral reefs and has a tropical climate. The Onge call North Sentinel Island Chia daaKwokweyeh. Appearance Members of an unspecified Andaman tribe fishing, c. 1870 Comparative distributions of Andamanese indigenous peoples, early 1800s vs. 2004 One report by Heinrich Harrer described a man as tall, possibly because of insular dwarfism (the so-called \\"Island Effect\\"), nutrition, or simply genetic heritage. During a 2014 circumnavigation of their island, researchers put their height between and and recorded their skin colour as \\"dark, shining black\\" with well-aligned teeth. They showed no signs of obesity and had very prominent muscles. Population No rigorous census has been conducted and the population has been variously estimated to be as low as 15 or as high as 500. Most estimates lie between 50 and 200. A handbook released in 2016 by the Anthropological Survey of India on Vulnerable Tribe Groups estimates the population at between 100 and 150. The 1971 census estimated the population at around 82; the 1981 census at 100. A 1986 expedition recorded the highest count, 98. In 2001, the Census of India officially recorded 21 men and 18 women. This survey was conducted from a distance and may not have been accurate. 2004 post-tsunami expeditions recorded counts of 32 and 13 individuals in 2004 and 2005 respectively. The 2011 Census of India recorded 12 males and three females. During a 2014 circumnavigation researchers recorded six females, seven males (all apparently under 40 years old) and three children younger than four. Practices The Sentinelese are hunter- gatherers. They likely use bows and arrows to hunt terrestrial wildlife and more rudimentary methods to catch local seafood, such as mud crabs and molluscan shells. They are believed to eat a lot of molluscs, given the abundance of roasted shells found in their settlements. Some of their practices have not evolved beyond those of the Stone Age; they are not known to engage in agriculture. Similarities as well as dissimilarities have been spotted with the Onge people. They prepare their food similarly. They share common traits in body decoration and material culture. There are also similarities in the design of their canoes. (Of all the Andamanese tribes, only the Sentinelese and Onge make canoes.) The Onge call them \\"Chanku-ate\\". Similarities with the Jarawas have been also noted. Their bows have similar patterns; no such marks are found on Onge bows. Finally, both tribes sleep on the ground, while the Onge sleep on raised platforms. The metal arrowheads and adze blades are quite large and heavier than those of other Andamanese tribes. The Sentinelese reside in small temporary huts erected on four poles with slanted leaf-covered roofs. They recognise the value of metal, having scavenged it to create tools and weapons and accepted aluminum cookware left by the National Geographic Society in 1974. They have also developed canoes suitable for lagoon-fishing but use long poles rather than paddles or oars to propel them. They seldom use the canoes for cross-island navigation. Both sexes wear bark strings; the men always tuck daggers into their waist belts. They also wear some ornaments such as necklaces and headbands, but are essentially naked. The wearing of jawbones of deceased relatives has been reported. Artistic engravings of simple geometric designs and shade contrasts have been seen on their weapons. The women have been seen to dance by slapping both palms on the thighs whilst simultaneously tapping the feet rhythmically in a bent-knee stance. Language Because of their complete isolation, nearly nothing is known about the Sentinelese language, which is therefore unclassified. It has been recorded that the Jarawa language is mutually unintelligible with the Sentinelese language. There is uncertainty as to the range of overlap with the Onge language, if any. The Anthropological Survey of India's 2016 handbook on Vulnerable Tribe Groups considers them mutually unintelligible. Age The Sentinelese have been widely described as a Stone Age tribe, with some reports claiming they have lived in isolation for over 60,000 years, but Pandya theorizes that really the Sentinelese arose either from a deliberate, more recent migration or from drifting off the Little Andaman. Isolation and uncontacted status They are a community of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation. Designated a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group and a Scheduled Tribe, they belong to the broader class of Andamanese people. Along with the Great Andamanese, the Jarawas, the Onge, the Shompen, and the Nicobarese, the Sentinelese are one of the six native and often reclusive peoples of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Unlike the others, the Sentinelese appear to have consistently refused any interaction with the outside world. They are hostile to outsiders and have killed people who approached or landed on the island. The first peaceful contact with the Sentinelese was made by Triloknath Pandit, a director of the Anthropological Survey of India, and his colleagues on 4 January 1991. Indian visits to the island ceased in 1997. Contact=Colonial period In 1771, an East India Company hydrographic survey vessel, the Diligent, observed \\"a multitude of lights ... upon the shore\\" of North Sentinel Island, which is the island's first recorded mention. The crew did not investigate. During the late summer monsoon of 1867, the Indian merchant-vessel Nineveh foundered on the reef off North Sentinel. All the passengers and crew reached the beach safely, but as they proceeded for their breakfast on the third day, they were subject to a sudden assault by a group of naked, short-haired, red-painted islanders with arrows that were probably iron-tipped. The captain, who fled in the ship's boat, was found days later by a brig and the Royal Navy sent a rescue party to the island. Upon arrival, the party discovered that the survivors had managed to repel the attackers with sticks and stones and that they had not reappeared. Andamanese scholar Vishvajit Pandya notes that Onge narratives often recall voyages by their ancestors to North Sentinel to procure metal. The first recorded visit to the island by a colonial officer was by Jeremiah Homfray in 1867. He recorded seeing naked islanders catching fish with bows and arrows, and was informed by the Great Andamanese that they were Jarawas. M. V. Portman with Andamanese chiefs In 1880, in an effort to establish contact with the Sentinelese, British naval officer Maurice Vidal Portman, who was serving as a colonial administrator to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, led an armed group of Europeans along with convict-orderlies and Andamanese trackers (whom they had already befriended) to North Sentinel Island. On their arrival, the islanders fled into the treeline. After several days of futile search, during which they found abandoned villages and paths, Portman's men captured six individuals, an elderly man and woman and four children. The man and woman died shortly after their arrival in Port Blair and the children sickened. Portman hurriedly sent the children back to the North Sentinel Island with ample gifts to establish friendly contact and noted their \\"peculiarly idiotic expression of countenance, and manner of behaving\\". Portman visited the island again in 1883, 1885 and 1887. In 1896, a convict escaped from the penal colony on Great Andaman Island on a makeshift raft and drifted across to the North Sentinel beach. His body was discovered by a search party some days later with several arrow-piercings and a cut throat. The party did not see any islanders. In an 1899 speech, Richard Carnac Temple, who served as chief commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from 1895 to 1904, reported that he had toured North Sentinel island to capture fugitives, but upon landing discovered that they had been killed by the inhabitants, who retreated in haste upon seeing his party approach. Temple also recorded a case where a Sentinelese apparently drifted off to the Onge and fraternized with them over the course of two years. When Temple and Portman accompanied him to the tribe and attempted to establish friendly contact, they did not recognize the individual and responded aggressively by shooting arrows at the group. The man refused to remain on the island. Portman cast doubt on the exact time span the Sentinelese spent with the Onge, and believed that he had probably been raised by the Onge since childhood. Temple went on to describe the Sentinelese as \\"a tribe which slays every stranger, however inoffensive, on sight, whether a forgotten member of itself, of another Andamanese tribe, or a complete foreigner\\". MCC Bonnington, a British official, visited the island on two separate occasions in 1911 and 1932 to conduct a census. On the first occasion, he came across eight men on the beach and another five in two canoes, who retreated into the forest. The party progressed some miles into the island without facing any hostile response and saw a few huts with slanted roofs. Notably, the Sentinelese were counted as a standalone group, for the first time, in the 1911 census. There have been other recorded instances of British administrators visiting the island, including Rogers in 1902, but none of the expeditions after 1880 had any ethnographic purpose, probably because of the island's small size and unfavorable location. Government of India In 1956, the Government of India declared North Sentinel Island a tribal reserve and prohibited travel within of it. Photography is prohibited. A constant armed patrol prevents intrusions by outsiders. =T. N. Pandit (1967‚Äì1991)= In 1967, a group of 20 people, comprising the governor, armed forces and naval personnel, were led by T. N. Pandit, an anthropologist working for the Anthropological Survey of India, to North Sentinel Island to explore it and befriend the Sentinelese. This was the first visit to the island by a professional anthropologist. Through binoculars, the group saw several clusters of Sentinelese along the coastline, who retreated into the forest as the team advanced. The team followed their footprints and after about a kilometer, found a group of 18 lean-to huts made from grass and leaves that showed signs of recent occupation as evidenced by the still-burning fires at the corners of the hut. The team also discovered raw honey, skeletal remains of pigs, wild fruits, an adze, a multi-pronged wooden spear, bows, arrows, cane baskets, fishing nets, bamboo pots and wooden buckets. Metal-working was evident. The team failed to establish any contact and withdrew after leaving gifts. The government was aware that leaving the Sentinelese (and the area) completely isolated and ceasing to claim any control would lead to rampant illegal exploitation of the natural resources by the numerous mercenary outlaws who took refuge in those regions, and probably contribute to the Sentinelese's extinction. Accordingly, in 1970, an official surveying party landed at an isolated spot on the island and erected a stone tablet, atop a disused native hearth, that declared the island part of India. During the 1970s and 1980s, Pandit undertook several visits to the island, sometimes as an \\"expert advisor\\" in tour parties including dignitaries who wished to encounter an aboriginal tribe. Beginning in 1981, he regularly led official expeditions with the purpose of establishing friendly contact. Many of these got a friendly reception, with hoards of gifts left for them, but some ended in violent encounters, which were mostly suppressed. Some of the expeditions (1987, 1992, et al.) were entirely documented on film. Sometimes the Sentinelese waved and sometimes they turned their backs and assumed a \\"defecating\\" posture, which Pandit took as a sign of their not being welcome. On some occasions, they rushed out of the jungle to take the gifts but then attacked the party with arrows. Other obscene gestures in response to contact parties, such as swaying of penises, have been noted. On some of his visits, Pandit brought some Onge to the island to try to communicate with the Sentinelese, but the attempts were usually futile and Pandit reported one instance of angering the Sentinelese. In early 1974, a National Geographic film crew went to the island with a team of anthropologists (including Pandit), accompanied by armed police, to film a documentary, Man in Search of Man. They planned to spread the operation of gift-giving over the course of three days and attempt to establish friendly contact. When the motorboat broke through the barrier reefs, the locals emerged from the jungle and shot arrows at it. The crew landed at a safe point on the coast and left gifts in the sand, including a miniature plastic car, some coconuts, a live pig, a doll, and aluminum cookware. The Sentinelese followed up by launching another volley of arrows, one of which struck the documentary director in his thigh. The man who wounded the director withdrew to the shade of a tree and laughed proudly while others speared and buried the pig and the doll. They left afterward, taking the coconuts and cookware. This expedition also led to the first photograph of the Sentinelese, published by Raghubir Singh in National Geographic magazine, where they were presented as people for whom \\"arrows speak louder than words\\". =1991 expedition= In 1991, the first instances of peaceful contact were recorded in the course of two routine expeditions by an Indian anthropological team consisting of various representatives of diverse governmental departments and Madhumala Chattopadhyay. During a 4 January 1991 visit, the Sentinelese approached the party without weaponry for the first time. They collected coconuts that were offered but retreated to the shore as the team gestured for them to come closer. The team returned to the main ship, MV Tarmugli. It returned to the island in the afternoon to find at least two dozen Sentinelese on the shoreline, one of whom pointed a bow and arrow at the party. Once a woman pushed the arrow down, the man buried his weapons in the beach and the Sentinelese approached quite close to the dinghies for the first time. The Director of Tribal Welfare distributed five bags of coconuts hand-to-hand. Pandya comments: Pandit and Madhumala took part in a second expedition on 24 February. The Sentinelese again appeared without weapons, jumped on the dinghies and took coconut sacks. They were also curious about a rifle hidden in the boat, which Chattopadhay believed they saw as a source of iron. In light of the friendly exchanges with the scrap dealers' team and Portman's observations in 1980, Pandya believes that the Sentinelese used to be visited by other tribes. =Later expeditions= The series of contact expeditions continued until 1994, with some of them even attempting to plant coconut trees on the island. The programs were then abandoned for nearly nine years. The Indian government maintained a policy of no deliberate contact, intervening only in cases of natural calamities that might pose an existential threat or to thwart poachers. A likely reason for the termination of these missions was that the Sentinelese did not let most of the post-Pandit contact teams get near them. The teams usually waited until the armed Sentinelese retreated, then left gifts on the beach or set them adrift toward shore. The government was also quite concerned about the possibility of harm to the Sentinelese by an influx of outsiders‚Äîa result of them projecting a relatively friendly image. Photos of the 1991 expedition were removed from public display and use of them was restricted by the government. The next expedition occurred in April 2003, when a canoe built by the Onges was given to the visitors. There were further expeditions (some aerial) in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the effects of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which caused massive tectonic changes to the island: it was enlarged by a merger with nearby small islands, and the sea floor was raised by about , exposing the surrounding coral reefs to air and destroying the shallow lagoons, which were the Sentinelese's fishing grounds. The expeditions counted a total of 32 Sentinelese scattered over three places but did not find any bodies. The Sentinelese responded to these aerial expeditions with hostile gestures, which led many to conclude that the community was mostly unaffected and had survived the calamity. Pandya argues that Sentinelese hostility is a sign of the physical as well as the cultural resilience of the community. The Sentinelese generally received the post-tsunami expeditions in a friendly manner. They approached the visiting parties, which carried no arms or shields as they had in earlier expeditions, unarmed. In 2014, an aerial expedition followed by a circumnavigation investigated the effects of a forest fire. Important data was gathered and the expedition recorded that the fire did not seem to have affected the populace. They exhibited a balance of ages and sexes, with a number of young children. Friendly hand gestures were noted but the visitors did not go very close to the island. The 2014 expedition also recorded that the Sentinelese had adapted to the changes to their fishing grounds, and were using their canoes to travel up to half a kilometre (a third of a mile) from the shore. Other contacts In 1954, Italian explorer Lidio Cipriani visited the island but did not come across any inhabitants. In 1977, MV Rusley ran aground on the North Sentinel Reefs. On 2 August 1981, the cargo ship Primrose, carrying cargo between Australia and Bangladesh, ran aground in rough seas just off North Sentinel Island, stranding a small crew. After a few days, the captain dispatched a distress call asking for a drop of firearms and reported boats being prepared by more than 50 armed islanders intending to invade the ship. Strong waves prevented the Sentinelese canoes from reaching the ship and deflected their arrows. Nearly a week later, the crew were evacuated by a civilian helicopter contracted to the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) with support from Indian Naval forces. The Sentinelese scoured the abandoned shipwrecks to salvage iron for their weaponry. M. A. Mohammad, a scrap dealer who won a government contract to dismantle the Primrose wreck (about from the shoreline) and assembled men for the purpose, recorded friendly exchange of fruits and small metal scraps with the Sentinelese, who often canoed to the workplace at low tide: On 27 January 2006, Indian fishermen Sunder Raj and Pandit Tiwari, who had been attempting to illegally harvest crabs off North Sentinel Island, drifted towards the island after their boat's makeshift anchor failed during the night. They did not respond to warning calls from passing fishermen, and their boat drifted into the shallows near the island, where a group of Sentinelese warriors attacked the boat and killed the fishermen with axes. According to one report, the bodies were later put on bamboo stakes facing out to sea like scarecrows. Three days later, an Indian Coast Guard helicopter, dispatched for the purpose, found the buried bodies. When the helicopter tried to retrieve them, it was attacked by Sentinelese armed with spears and arrows and the mission was soon abandoned. There were contrasting views in the local community as to whether the Sentinelese ought to be prosecuted for the murder. Pandya hypothesizes that the aggressive response might have been caused by the sudden withdrawal of those gift- carrying expeditions, which was not influenced or informed by any acts of the Sentinelese. He also notes that whilst the images of the hostile Sentinelese (captured by the helicopter sorties) were heavily propagated in the media, the images of them burying the dead were never released. This selective display led to an effective negation of the friendly images that were circulated in the aftermath of the 1991 contact (which have been already taken out of public display) and restored the 1975 National Geographic narrative. In November 2018, John Allen Chau, a 26-year-old American, trained and sent by the US- based Christian missionary organization All Nations, travelled to North Sentinel Island with the aim of contacting and living among the Sentinelese in the hope of converting them to Christianity. Chau did not seek the necessary permits required to visit the island and traveled illegally to the island by bribing local fishermen. He expressed a clear desire to convert the tribe and awareness of the risk of death he faced and of the illegality of his visits, writing, \\"Lord, is this island Satan's last stronghold where none have heard or even had the chance to hear your name?\\", \\"The eternal lives of this tribe is at hand\\", and \\"I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people. Please do not be angry at them or at God if I get killed...Don't retrieve my body.\\" On 15 November, Chau attempted his first visit in a fishing boat, which took him about from shore. The fishermen warned Chau not to go farther, but he canoed toward shore with a waterproof Bible. As he approached, he attempted to communicate with the islanders and to offer gifts, but he retreated after facing hostile responses. On another visit, Chau recorded that the islanders reacted to him with a mixture of amusement, bewilderment and hostility. He attempted to sing worship songs to them, and spoke to them in Xhosa, after which they often fell silent. Other attempts to communicate ended with them bursting into laughter. Chau stated they communicated with \\"lots of high pitched sounds\\" and gestures. Eventually, according to Chau's last letter, when he tried to hand over fish and gifts, a boy shot a metal-headed arrow that pierced the Bible he was holding in front of his chest, after which he retreated again. On his final visit, on 17 November, Chau instructed the fishermen to leave without him. The fishermen later saw the islanders dragging Chau's body, and the next day they saw his body on the shore. Police subsequently arrested seven fishermen for assisting Chau to get close to the restricted island. His death was treated as a murder, but there was no suggestion that the Sentinelese would be charged and the U.S. government confirmed that it did not ask the Indian government to press charges against the tribe. Indian officials made several attempts to recover Chau's body but eventually abandoned those efforts.

She was named for James C. Jarvis. Jarvis was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Company, Camden, New Jersey on 1 July 1911; launched on 4 April 1912; sponsored by Mrs. Jean King; and commissioned on 22 October 1912, Lieutenant Commander D. P. Mannix in command. Pre-World War I Following shakedown off Cuba, Jarvis spent a year operating out of Norfolk, Virginia in the Caribbean. She departed Pensacola, Florida on 20 April 1914 for patrols off Tampico and Veracruz, Mexico, during the US occupation of Veracruz. Returning to Norfolk on 16 June, she operated in the Atlantic until departing New York on 26 May 1917 to join US Naval Forces operating in European waters under Vice Admiral William Sims. World War I Arriving in Queenstown, Ireland, via St. Nazaire, France on 11 June, she commenced patrol and escort duty along the Irish and English coasts. The operations of destroyers such as Jarvis were of immense value to the Allies in overcoming the German U-boat menace. While not credited with sinking any U-boats, on two occasions Jarvis rescued crews of ships torpedoed by enemy submarines. On 19 June she rescued 41 survivors of SS Batoum off the Irish coast, and she pulled 22 survivors of the British merchantman Purley from the North Sea on 25 July. After recovering Batoums survivors, she braved a possible torpedo attack and positioned herself between SS Mechanician and a U-boat to protect the merchant ship from enemy torpedoes. Jarvis operated out of Queenstown until 15 February 1918, when she sailed to Brest, France to guard Allied shipping along the French coast. She patrolled out of Brest until 28 December; then she sailed for the United States. Arriving at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 12 January 1919, she resumed operations along the Atlantic Coast. Jarvis returned to Philadelphia on 21 July and decommissioned on 26 November. To comply with the terms of the London Naval Treaty, she was scrapped and her materials sold on 23 April 1935.

Quranic usage The expression ma malakat aymanukum and its variants are found in 15 Quranic passages. It is the most common of the seven separate terms used in the Quran to refer to slaves. The Quranic vocabulary for slaves is significantly different from classical Arabic, where the most common terms for slave are ‚Äòabd (used in the Quran mainly in the sense servant/worshipper of God) and raqiq (not found in the Quran). According to Jonathan E. Brockopp, the use of the phrase ma malakat aymanukum and the Cognate term mamluk (possessed) makes it clear that slaves in the Quranic discourse are regarded as property.Jonathan E. Brockopp (2000), Early MƒÅlikƒ´ Law: Ibn  ªAbd Al-·∏§akam and His Major Compendium of Jurisprudence, Brill, , pp. 131 The Quran treats slavery and freedom not as part of the natural order saying that this distinction as an example of God's grace.https://www.islamawakened.com/quran/16/71/ It regards this discrimination between human beings as in accordance with the divinely established order of things and to undermine this order is to act against God.Jonathan E. Brockopp (2000), Early MƒÅlikƒ´ Law: Ibn  ªAbd Al-·∏§akam and His Major Compendium of Jurisprudence, Brill Academic, , pp. 130-133(, ), ()Marmon in Marmon (1999), page 2 Islamic views on slavery=Comparison to pre- Islamic cultures There were many common features between the institution of slavery in the Quran and that of pre-Islamic culture. However, the Quranic institution had some unique new features. According to Brockopp, the idea of using alms for the manumission of slaves who had converted to Islam appears to be unique to the Quran., Islam also prohibits the use of female slaves for prostitution which was common in pre-Islamic history. Brockopp states that the Qur'an was a progressive legislation on slavery in its time because it encouraged proper treatment.Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Slaves and Slavery Others state that Islam's record with slavery has been mixed, progressive in Arabian lands, but it increased slavery and worsened abuse as Muslim armies attacked people in Africa, Europe and Asia.Gad Heuman and James Walvin (2003), The Slavery Reader, Volume 1, Routledge, , pp. 31-32Murray Gordon (1989), Slavery in the Arab World, Rowman & Littlefield, , pp. 18-39 Murray notes that Quran sanctified the institution of slavery and abuses therein, but to its credit did not freeze the status of a slave and allowed a means to a slave's manumission in some cases when the slave converted to Islam. Freeing slaves When an individual erred such as missing a day of fasting, they were to free a slave (Manumission). Sharia authorized the institution of slavery, and under Islamic law, Muslim men could have sexual relations with female captives and slaves.Mazrui, A. A. (1997). Islamic and Western values. Foreign Affairs, pp 118-132.Ali, K. (2010). Marriage and slavery in early Islam. Harvard University Press. Sharia, in Islam's history, provided religious foundation for enslaving non-Muslim women (and men), as well as encouraged slave's manumission. However, manumission required that the non-Muslim slave first convert to Islam. Non-Muslim slave women who bore children to their Muslim masters became legally free upon her master's death, and her children were presumed to be Muslims as their father, in Africa, and elsewhere. Muhammad's treatment of captives Both the Quran and hadith make mention of the rights of slaves and how their masters must conduct themselves. Narrated Al-Ma'rur: At Ar-Rabadha I met Abu Dhar who was wearing a cloak, and his slave, too, was wearing a similar one. I asked about the reason for it. He replied, \\"I abused a person by calling his mother with bad names.\\" The Prophet said to me, 'O Abu Dhar! Did you abuse him by calling his mother with bad names You still have some characteristics of ignorance. Your slaves are your brothers and Allah has put them under your command. So whoever has a brother under his command should feed him of what he eats and dress him of what he wears. Do not ask them (slaves) to do things beyond their capacity (power) and if you do so, then help them.' Abu Huraira reported Muhammad as saying: \\"When the slave of anyone amongst you prepares food for him and he serves him after having sat close to (and undergoing the hardship of) heat and smoke, he should make him (the slave) sit along with him and make him eat (along with him), and if the food seems to run short, then he should spare some portion for him (from his own share) - (another narrator) Dawud said:\\" i. e. a morsel or two\\" After the Muslims repelled the siege of Medinah, they order the execution of the male members (between 600 and 900) of the Banu Qurayza tribe for committing treason under the constitution of Medina, the women and children were taken as slaves.Muir, William. \\"The Life of Mahomet\\". Smith, Elder, & Co., London, 1861; Vol.3, Ch.17, p.276 (citing Hishami, 436) Muhammad himself took Rayhana as his slave. He presented three women from the conquered Banu Hawazin as slaves to his key supportive close marital relatives in early 630: Reeta, to Ali; Zeinab, to Uthman; and an unnamed third to Umar.Muir, William. \\"The Life of Mahomet\\". Smith, Elder, & Co., London, 1861; Vol.4, Ch.25, pp.149‚Äì150 Sexual intercourse Surah Al-Muminun (23:6) and Surah Al- Maarij (70:30) both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and \\"those whom one's right hands possess\\" (female slaves), saying \\" ÿ£Ÿéÿ≤ŸíŸàŸéÿßÿ¨ŸêŸáŸêŸÖŸí ÿ£ŸéŸàŸí ŸÖŸéÿß ŸÖŸéŸÑŸéŸÉŸéÿ™Ÿí ÿ£ŸéŸäŸíŸÖŸéÿßŸÜŸèŸáŸèŸÖŸí\\" (literally, \\"their spouses or what their right hands possess\\"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible. However both these surahs literal wording do not specifically use the term wife but instead the more general & both-gender including term spouse in the grammatically masculine plural (azwajihim), thus Mohammad Asad in his commentary to both these Surahs rules out concubinage due to the fact that \\"since the term azwaj (\\"spouses\\"), too, denotes both the male and the female partners in marriage, there is no reason for attributing to the phrase aw ma malakat aymanuhum the meaning of \\"their female slaves\\"; and since, on the other hand, it is out of the question that female and male slaves could have been referred to here, it is obvious that this phrase does not relate to slaves at all, but has the same meaning as in 4:24 namely, \\"those whom they rightfully possess through wedlock\\" with the significant difference that in the present context this expression relates to both husbands and wives, who \\"rightfully possess\\" one another by virtue of marriage.\\" Following this approach, Mohammad Asads translation of the mentioned verses denotes a different picture, which is as follows: \\"with any but their spouses - that is, those whom they rightfully possess [through wedlock]\\". According to Maududi purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, But this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill, page 13. Rabb Intisar claims that Islamic sources treat non-consensual sex with slaves as zina or rape. However, Kecia Ali does not find the idea of consent explicitly stated in the per-modern Muslim legal tradition between the 8th and 10th century According to the Quran, slaves could not be forced into being prostituted, without breaking the law of God. \\"But let them who find not [the means for] marriage abstain [from sexual relations] until Allah enriches them from His bounty ... And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek [thereby] the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is [to them], after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.\\" (Surah An-Nur 24:33) However the word used for chastity in this verse is also used to describe married women in Surah 4 verse 24. Ibn Kathir in this tasfir of this verse applied prostitution only to Zina and cited a haddith about \\"one who gets married seeking chastity\\" One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that \\"it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the Muslim community.\\" p.22 Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), p.48 but according to Sikainga, \\"in reality, however,female slaves in some Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests.\\" The history of slavery in Islamic states and of sexual relations with slaves, was the \\"responsibility of Muslims, and not of the Quran\\", according to Parwez, as quoted by Clarence-Smith. Amir Ali blamed the history of Islamic slavery in racist terms, states Clarence-Smith, stating that slave servitude and sexual abuse of captive slaves may have been because of degeneration of the Arabs from their admixing over time with \\"lower races such as Ethiopians\\". Limitations on Sex with Other Slaves Regarding rules for having sexual intercourse with a slave, a man may not have sexual intercourse with a female slave belonging to his wife, but one he owns. Neither may he have relations with a female slave if she is co-owned without the permission of other owners. He may have sex with a female captive who was previously married prior to captivity, provided their Idda (waiting) period had come to an end.\\"They are allowed to take possession of married women if they are slaves. S≈´rah iv. 28: ‚ÄúUnlawful for you are ‚Ä¶ married women, save such as your right hands possess.‚Äù (On this verse al-JalƒÅlƒÅn the commentators say: ‚Äúthat is, it is lawful for them to cohabit with those women whom you have made captive, even though their husbands be alive in the DƒÅru ‚Äôl-·∏§arb.‚Äù\\" Hughes, T. P. (1885). In A Dictionary of Islam: Being a Cyclop√¶dia of the Doctrines, Rites, Ceremonies, and Customs, together with the Technical and Theological Terms, of the Muhammadan Religion. London: W. H. Allen & Co. There have been historical exceptions where forced sex of slave girl by other than the owner have been treated as an offense in Muslim state. The incident was, If the female slave has a child by her master, she then receives the title of \\"Ummul Walad\\" (lit. Mother of the child), which is an improvement in her status as she can no longer be sold and is legally freed upon the death of her master. The child, by default, is born free due to the father (i.e., the master) being a free man. Although there is no limit on the number of concubines a master may possess, the general marital laws are to be observed, such as not having sexual relations with the sister of a female slave., p.2 People are told that if they do not have the means to marry free- women, they can marry, with the permission of their masters, slave-women who are Muslims and are also kept chaste. In such marriages, they must pay their dowers so that this could bring them gradually equal in status to free- women.Javed Ahmad Ghamidi. Mizan, The Social Law of Islam, Al-Mawrid Contemporary usage In late 2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant released a pamphlet on the treatment of female slaves, which used a Quranic quote containing the expression ma malakat aymanukum to argue that Islam permits having sex with female captives.Amelia Smith, \\"ISIS Publish Pamphlet On How to Treat Female Slaves,\\" Newsweek, 12/9/2014Katharine Lackey, \\"Pamphlet provides Islamic State guidelines for sex slaves,\\" USA Today, December 13, 2014 Abolition argument In the 20th century, South Asian scholars Ghulam Ahmed Pervez and Amir Ali argued that the expression ma malakat aymanukum should be properly read in the past tense. When some called for reinstatement of slavery in Pakistan upon its independence from the British colonial rule, Pervez argued that the past tense of this expression means that the Quran had imposed \\"an unqualified ban\\" on slavery.

She is a blind Force-sensitive who forms a \\"bond\\" with the player character, the Jedi Exile, through the Force. Kreia sets herself up as the Exile's mentor, and rejects the divide of the light and dark side of the Force, as well as the predestination the Force entails. By the game's end, it is revealed she is the Sith Lord Darth Traya and is planning on destroying the Force, and she becomes the final boss of The Sith Lords. Kreia makes no more appearances in Star Wars fiction, though a miniature by Wizards of the Coast was released in August 2008, and she appears as an obtainable character in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Written by Chris Avellone, the character was created as a sounding board for the game's theme of the role of the Jedi and the nature of the Force, and was heavily influenced by Planescape: Torments Ravel Puzzlewell. She served both to test the player and to act as a mouthpiece for any questions Avellone thought should be asked about the Star Wars universe. Sara Kestelman voiced the character, with Kreia's casting being considered the most important of all the characters. Her name references Princess Leia of the original Star Wars trilogy, while her character design draws both on Palpatine's hood and Obi-Wan Kenobi's robes. She was positively received, and is often pointed as the highlight of The Sith Lords. Praise went to the questions and dialogue she provided, as well as her voice acting. The character has appeared in numerous \\"top lists\\", often commending her as a Star Wars character. Attention was drawn to one moment where Kreia lectures about the dangers of charity. Despite this, Avellone felt he failed in creating a \\"sympathetic\\" Sith Lord, though he has called her one of his favorite characters in the game. Conception and creation The first draft of the game placed a figurehead similar to Kreia as the leader of matriarchs ruling the Handmaiden's world, which the player was sent to free. This draft was made before Obsidian had played the first game, and after they had played it the draft was discarded. However, some of Kreia's characteristics were salvaged, though little else was. In the game proper, Kreia was written by Chris Avellone, who was also lead designer of The Sith Lords and created most of the party. Avellone was initially unsure about working on Star Wars but after beginning became more \\"excited\\" about it. Avellone decided to attempt to create a sympathetic Sith Lord. The character was highly influenced by Ravel Puzzlewell, a Planescape: Torment character which Avellone also wrote, and was intended to tell stories with her he had been unable to do in Torment. Avellone felt it would be \\"cool\\" to be in a party with Ravel. Despite Ravel's influence, the Star Wars setting and its elements resulted in Kreia changing heavily. A multi-page biography was created for narrative reference, art and audio. When making characters, Avellone prefers to focus on: their role in the story, their name, their visual signature (discussed with the concept artist), and in Kreia's case the character's ability to serve as his voice. Her name is inspired by Princess Leia of the original Star Wars films, and serves a similar role as ally, but Kreia has darker past demonstrated by a harsher prefix. Her visuals, meanwhile, combine elements of both \\"the wise mentor\\" like Obi-Wan's robes and dark side elements like Palpatine's hood. Brian Menze, lead concept artist and modeller for the characters, designed Kreia. Narratively, Kreia had several roles in The Sith Lords, acting as a party member, a foil, and a \\"sounding board\\" for the theme of the game, which concerned the Jedi's role and the Force's nature in a living galaxy. As an extension of Avellone's voice, Kreia became his way of expressing all his problems with the Force. Despite her view of the Force, it was important to avoid causing continuity problems with the rest of the Star Wars series, and her views were presented within the context of the original Force in the Star Wars world. Kreia is intended to test the player on the basic philosophical issues of the Star Wars universe. She is rude and dismissive to everyone but the player character, something intended to help make the player feel special. Sara Kestelman provided Kreia's voice. English actress Sara Kestelman voiced the character in the game. In voice directors Will Beckman and Darragh O'Farrell's \\"Designer Diary\\", the character was considered the most critical character to cast, though a challenging one as few games cast women of her age group. Obsidian worked hard in finding Kreia's voice, which had to match with her model without being \\"witchy or grating\\" due to her lengthy amount of dialogue. Developers tried to give each companion a unique ability to make them distinct from any other companion. Originally, throughout The Sith Lords Kreia would be seen through cutscenes recruiting certain characters such as Hanharr to side with her and seducing them to the dark side, though her exact purpose was not made overt. At the end of the game, they would then be used as \\"cannon fodder\\" before the fight with her began. Ultimately, this was cut. Character Kreia is shown as an elderly blind woman, whose eyes have atrophied from lack of use in preference of viewing things through the Force, viewing normal sight as a distraction. Dialogue in The Sith Lords establishes her past as a Jedi historian and one of the teachers of Revan, who became a Sith Lord and was the player character of the first game, and how her teachings were blamed for his fall. The Sith Lords reveals she has Sith trained two antagonists of the game, Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus, before they cast her out. She is initially depicted in earth-brown hooded Jedi robes with empty white eyes, though after the revelation of her identity as Darth Traya, both a Sith and a being of betrayal, both her robes and eyes are changed to black, and she becomes more pale. \\"She was questioning everything about the Star Wars universe that I thought should be questioned.\\"‚ÄîChris Avellone, writer of the character Kreia was the personification of Avellone's frustrations with the concept of the Force. He called her \\"one redeeming feature\\" her love of the player character, and what they represent: a way of destroying the Force and its predestination in favor of giving freedom to the galaxy. She shuns the light-side and the dark-side divide of the Force, as well as blanket good and evil, favoring choices that emphasise personal strength for the player. The A.V. Clubs Julie Muncy described her philosophy as \\"a pessimistic and borderline-Randian way of thinking focused on the importance of power and strife\\". She is initially presented as an ally and a teacher, and acts a mentor from the start of the game. Alexander Gambotto- Burke of Eurogamer commented that she has a \\"genuine, albeit twisted maternal\\" love for the player, her student. In contrast to Darth Malak, the clear villain of the first game, Avellone called Kreia neither \\"necessarily good or evil\\"; instead, she merely wants the Exile to grow as a person. Kreia is deliberately complicated in her goals and motivations, giving the character a feel of mystery. IGN's Hilary Goldstein noted this mystery, commenting both on her seemingly dark motives and yet how she appears as the player's \\"staunchest defender and a true protector\\". Relationships=Mentorship tree=Appearances=In The Sith Lords The game was first released in December 2004, on Xbox, marking the character's debut. Kreia initially seems dead when introduced, but after the player character, an exile of the Jedi Order, enters the morgue of the mining station they've woken in, she begins conversation. She informs the player that while they slept they both formed a Force bond, tying the Exile and Kreia together. It is revealed that Kreia and the Exile both came in aboard the Ebon Hawk after the Exile's original ship was attacked by the Sith and the Exile rescued while unconscious. During their escape, Kreia encounters Darth Sion and loses her hand during the battle, which in turn causes the Exile tremendous pain due to their bond. After she rejoins the party and they escape the station on the Ebon Hawk, Kreia then appoints herself the Exile's \\"teacher\\". Kreia serves as a party member throughout the game, and may interject at certain points of it to offer her perspective. Depending on each decision the player makes, Kreia may gain or lose \\"Influence\\", which measures how much \\"trust, confidence, or control\\" the player has with a party member. Unlike other party members, Kreia's alignment is not affected by the player's Influence level with her and is instead set at neutral, though Influence will unlock new conversations with her. In gameplay, she may only equip one hand, and is a \\"Jedi Consular\\", focused on using the game's Force powers. Having her in the party grants the player extra experience, and any Force effects the player character or Kreia use on themselves will also affect the other. After the player finds all the in- hiding Jedi Masters, Kreia will retake her mantle as a Sith Lord. If the player does not kill the Jedi, she will intervene when they attempt to cut the Exile off from the Force, draining the Jedi of the Force herself and killing them. If the player chooses to kill the Jedi, she will renounce the Exile. Either way, she will leave, and the player must hunt her to Malachor V, the site of such great atrocities and death that they caused a wound in the Force. Kreia seemingly plans on creating another wound in the Force there, deafening all to the Force and causing its \\"death\\", as well as potentially killing all those touched by it. The player faces Kreia, now \\"Darth Traya\\", as the final boss, and after she is defeated she offers to describe the future she foresees before dying. Later appearances The character would make no more future appearances in Star Wars fiction. However, Kreia is mentioned in several Star Wars reference books, such as Jedi vs. Sith: The Essential Guide to the Force and the second volume of The Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia. In addition, Wizards of the Coast created a miniature for the character, along with other characters in the Knights of the Old Republic series, which was released August 19, 2008. In February 2018, Darth Traya and select other Sith Lords characters were announced as playable characters and raid bosses for the mobile game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Reception Kreia has been positively received. Alexander Gambotto-Burke, for Eurogamer, considered Kreia to be the greatest villain in video gaming, praising her dialogue, Kestelman's \\"intelligent and subtle\\" voice-acting, and the way she forced the player into making choices and considering their decisions. IGN's Hilary Goldstein offered similar praise to her dialogue. When looking at morality in games, Gamasutra's Katherine Cross noted how Kreia's comments affected her more than many of the dark-side/light-side choices in the game. Her \\"practical\\" philosophy was also complimented by Kotaku's Phil Owen, who noted its ties to reality over the traditional moral extremes of the Sith and the Jedi. Eurogamers Richard Cobbett considered her the most \\"famous\\" of The Sith Lords subversion of Star Wars and the first Knights of the Old Republic, commenting \\"Whether you agree or think she's crazy, she's a fresh breath of air for the series, and easily one of the best RPG characters ever.\\" The character is often considered The Sith Lords greatest or most important character. Julie Muncy of The A.V. Club said she was the greatest part of the game and called her the game's most \\"captivating\\" character, which he credited to her \\"cold charisma\\". Muncy found herself genuinely changing his character based on her opinions, overly caring about how Kreia viewed his character. Similarly, PC Gamer credited Kreia with The Sith Lordss success, calling her \\"clearly haunted, bitter, manipulative, and yet right in so many ways\\". By looking at the Star Wars world through the view of her philosophy, they felt Obsidian made \\"the most thoughtful take on Star Wars we'll ever get\\". Robert Purchese, writing for Eurogamer, called her \\"the strongest and most memorable character\\" in the game, praising her writing and how she embodied The Sith Lordss gray areas. Allen Rausch of GameSpy described her as the game's most compelling character, commending Kreia for her challenges to his choices and noting how one example, concerning the importance of lightsabers, changed his view of the game. The character has appeared in numerous lists, often reflecting her good reception as a Star Wars character. IGN placed her at 81 in \\"The Top 100 Star Wars Characters\\", noting her crypticness. She, along with the other Sith Lords in the game, came second-place in a modified list of the best Star Wars villains, based on reader requests for characters left out of the original list. The Lords of both the first and second Knights of the Old Republic were similarly grouped as some of gaming's best Star Wars characters by Joe Juba of Game Informer, calling most of them \\"cooler and better developed\\" than the Sith Lords in the actual Star Wars films. The character was ranked seventh among Game Informers \\"Top Ten Female Villains in Video Games\\" by Liz Lanier, saying that \\"Kreia is one of the few female Sith Lords of the Star Wars universe, but she represents women of the dark side relatively ruthlessly.\\" The \\"struggle\\" against her was called one of \\"25 greatest Star Wars moments in Xbox history\\" by Edwin Evans- Thirlwell writing for GamesRadar, who called her reveal of her agenda \\"compelling\\" despite being exposition. Not all reception of the character was positive. Adam Rosenburg of UGO Networks listed Kreia as one of the worst Star Wars expanded universe characters, considering her at the center of Knights of the Old Republic IIs \\"stupidity\\" and criticizing her Sith name. Gamasutra's Christopher Buecheler, the \\"Resident Cynic\\", found Kreia's comments \\"a bit trite and condescending\\". Buecheler also faulted how gaining Influence with Kreia was essential in understanding the main plot of the game. In a moment described as \\"(in)famous\\" by Cross, on Nar Shaddaa the player may give a beggar money or leave him; if he is given the money, Kreia shows how he is made a target of and attacked, and if he is refused Kreia reveals he attacks others. Owen called this moment the crystallization of the game's gray areas. Anthony Brock of Gamers Hell noted how it led to him passionately arguing with a game character, complimenting Obsidian for how involved he felt. Cobbett similarly highlighted the moment when praising the character. Buecheler, however, criticized the scene for using an unlikely chance event to make its point. Kreia won \\"Best Character\\" in GameSpy's 2005 game of the year awards. They called her a \\"deeply unpleasant, highly disturbing, and incredibly hateful person\\", but also \\"easily the most intriguing, complicated, enigmatic, well-designed and nuanced character in a video game [in 2005]\\". She was also nominated for GameSpot's 2004 \\"Best New Character\\" award, though lost to \\"The Boss\\" in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Avellone retrospective Avellone has said he felt he failed in creating a sympathetic Sith Lord, recalling buglists by QA testers referring to her as \\"that crusty annoying lady,\\" and he considered the ending's explanations of her motivations more \\"hamfisted\\" than sympathetic. However, in an interview with 1UP.com he called Kreia, along with the Handmaiden, his favorite character after T3-M4, citing the mystery surrounding her. He called his favorite \\"unexpected turn\\" in the game the revelation of Kreia being neither fully good nor evil. In another interview, this time with Star Wars fansite EU Cantina, he called his favorite character either Kreia or T3, and called her scene where she explains her relationship with the Force one of his favorites in the game. Analysis Alexander Gambotto-Burke felt the character was a presentation of Avellone's criticisms of the Star Wars mythos and the morality presented in most post- Garriott video games, and called her \\"a tutorial, an incentive to explore moral avenues you might have otherwise ignored\\". Gambotto-Burke considered her not purely evil, and felt even at the end of the game \\"you can't help but see her as a flawed visionary\\". GameSpot considered it the point to be for the player to move on from her \\"self-defeating\\" nihilism and realize \\"the act of choice is what gives form and pattern to the universe\\". In her piece analysing game morality, Katherine Cross highlighted the beggar scene on Nar Shaddaa. Cross noted how it illustrated Kreia's morality, shed doubt on \\"tokenist\\" moral acts, and highlighted the player's own powerlessness. Hilary Goldstein noted how her philosophical points questioned the roles of the Jedi and the Sith.

In Persian mythology and folklore, Jamshid is described as the fourth and greatest king of the epigraphically unattested Pishdadian Dynasty (before the Kayanian dynasty). This role is already alluded to in Zoroastrian scripture (e.g. Yasht 19, Vendidad 2), where the figure appears as Avestan language ê¨´ê¨åê¨®ê¨Ä ê¨Üê¨ëê¨±ê¨Äê¨âê¨ôê¨Ä‚Äé Yima(-Kshaeta) \\"(radiant) Yima,\\" and from which the name 'Jamshid' is derived. Jamshid remains a common Iranian and Zoroastrian male name that is also popular in surrounding areas of Iran. Edward FitzGerald transliterated the name as Jamshyd. In the eastern regions of Greater Iran, Central Asia, and by the Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent it is rendered as Jamshed. Etymology The name Jamshid is originally a compound of two parts, Jam and shid, corresponding to the Avestan names Yima and X≈°aƒìta, derived from the proto-Iranian *Yamah X≈°aitah. Yamah and the related Sanskrit Yama are interpreted as \\"the twin,\\" perhaps reflecting an Indo-Iranian belief in a primordial Yama and Yami pair. By regular sound changes (y ‚Üí j, and the loss of the final syllable) an Old Persian form equivalent to Avestan Yima became Middle Persian Jam, which was subsequently continued into New Persian. There are also a few functional parallels between Avestan Yima and Sanskrit Yama, for instance, Yima was the son of Viva≈ãhat, who in turn corresponds to the Vedic Vivasvat, \\"he who shines out\\", a divinity of the Sun. Both Yamas in Iranian and Indian myth guard Hell with the help of two four-eyed dogs.http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/iml/iml08.htm *X≈°aitah meant \\"bright, shining\\" or \\"radiant\\". By regular sound changes (initial x≈° ‚Üí ≈° (sh); ai ‚Üí ƒì; t ‚Üí d between vowels; and dropping of the final syllable) *x≈°aitah became Persian shƒìd. In Iranian Persian, the vowel /ƒì/ is pronounced as /i/. Consequently, Jamshƒìd (as it is still pronounced in Afghanistan and Tajikistan) is now pronounced Jamshid in Iran. The suffix -shid is the same as that found in other names such as khorshid (\\"the Sun\\" from Avestan hvar…ô-x≈°aƒìta \\"radiant Sun\\"). The modern Turkish name Cem is derived from Persian Jam. One contributor has posited that Persian jam is the root of Arabic ajam, assuming that this Arabic word for the Persian-speaking population was derived from a Persian endonym, meaning the people of Jam. However, this is incorrect.  øAjam comes from the Arabic root  ø( øayn) ÿ¨ (jim) ŸÖ (mim), meaning to speak incomprehensibly, and was used among Arabs, initially, for all peoples who spoke languages that were incomprehensible to Arabic speakers, whether they spoke Persian, Fulani, or a Turkic language. Later, Arabs used this word as a derogatory term for Persian speakers to distinguish them from Arabic speakers. The word  øajam or  øajami is still used in other parts of the Islamic world to denote languages other than Arabic, particularly in the Saharan and sub-Saharan regions. In scripture Source:Quotations in the following section are from James Darmesteter's translation of the Vendidad , as published in the 1898 American edition of Max M√ºller's Sacred Books of the East In the second chapter of the Vendidad of the Avesta, the omniscient Creator Ahura Mazda asks Yima, a good shepherd, to receive his law and bring it to men. However, Yima refuses, and so Ahura Mazda charges him with a different mission: to rule over and nourish the earth, to see that the living things prosper. This Yima accepts, and Ahura Mazda presents him with a golden seal and a dagger inlaid with gold. Yima rules as king for three hundred years, and soon the earth was full of men, flocks of birds and herds of animals. He deprived the daevas, who were demonic servants of the evil Ahriman, of wealth, herds and reputation during his reign. Good men, however, lived lives of plenty, and were neither sick nor aged. Father and son walked together, each appearing no older than fifteen. Ahura Mazda visits him once more, warning him of this overpopulation. Yima, shining with light, faced southwards and pressed the golden seal against the earth and boring into it with the poniard, says \\"O Spenta Armaiti, kindly open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to bear flocks and herds and men.\\" The earth swells and Yima rules for another six hundred years before the same problem occurred once more. Once again he pressed the seal and dagger to the earth and asked the ground to swell up to bear more men and beasts, and the earth swells again. Nine hundred years later, the earth was full again. The same solution is employed, the earth swelling again. The next part of the story tells of a meeting of Ahura Mazda and the Yazatas in Airyanem Vaejah, the first of the \\"perfect lands\\". Yima attends with a group of \\"the best of mortals\\", where Ahura Mazda warns him of an upcoming catastrophe: \\"O fair Yima, son of Viva≈ãhat! Upon the material world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall bring the fierce, deadly frost; upon the material world the evil winters are about to fall, that shall make snow-flakes fall thick, even an ar…ôdvi deep on the highest tops of mountains.\\" Ahura Mazda advises Yima to construct a Vara (Avestan: enclosure) in the form of a multi-level cavern, two miles (3 km) long and two miles (3 km) wide. This he is to populate with the fittest of men and women; and with two of every animal, bird and plant; and supply with food and water gathered the previous summer. Yima creates the Vara by crushing the earth with a stamp of his foot, and kneading it into shape as a potter does clay. He creates streets and buildings, and brings nearly two thousand people to live therein. He creates artificial light, and finally seals the Vara with a golden ring. Henry Corbin interprets this story as a spiritual event and describes it as follows: Yima \\"received the order to build the enclosure, the Var, where were gathered together the elect from among all beings, the fairest, the most gracious, that they might be preserved from the mortal winter unleashed by the demonic Powers, and some day repopulate a transfigured world. Indeed, the Var of Yima is, as it were, a city, including houses, storehouses, and ramparts. It has luminescent doors and windows that themselves secrete the light within, for it is illuminated both by uncreated and created lights.\\"Corbin, Henry (1977).

FitzGerald translation } Over time, the Avestan hero Yima X≈°aƒìta became the world-ruling ShƒÅh Jamshid of Persian legend and mythology. According to the ShƒÅhnƒÅma of the poet Firdausƒ´, Jamshid was the fourth king of the world. He had command over all the angels and demons of the world, and was both king and high priest of Hormozd (middle Persian for Ahura Mazda). He was responsible for a great many inventions that made life more secure for his people: the manufacture of armor and weapons, the weaving and dyeing of clothes of linen, silk and wool, the building of houses of brick, the mining of jewels and precious metals, the making of perfumes and wine, the art of medicine, the navigation of the waters of the world in sailing ships. The sudreh and kushti of the Zoroastrianism are also attributed to Jamshid. From the skin-clad followers of Keyumars, humanity had risen to a great civilization in Jamshid's time. Jamshid also divided the people into four groups: * KƒÅtouzians: The priests who conducted the worship of Hormozd * NeysƒÅrians: The warriors who protected the people by the might of their arms * NƒÅsoudians: The farmers who grew the grain that fed the people * Hotokhoshians: The artisans, who produced goods for the ease and enjoyment of the people Jamshid had now become the greatest monarch the world had ever known. He was endowed with the royal farr (Avestan: khvarena), a radiant splendor that burned about him by divine favor. One day he sat upon a jewel- studded throne and the divs who served him raised his throne up into the air and he flew through the sky. His subjects, all the peoples of the world, marvelled and praised him. On this day, which was the first of the month of Farvardin, they first celebrated the holiday of Nawr≈çz (\\"new day\\"). In the variant of the Zoroastrian calendar followed by the Zoroastrians of India, the first day of the month of Farvardin is still called Jamshƒìd-i Nawr≈çz. Jamshid was said to have had a magical seven-ringed cup, the JƒÅm-e Jam which was filled with the elixir of immortality and allowed him to observe the universe. Jamshid's capital was erroneously believed to be at the site of the ruins of Persepolis, which for centuries (down to 1620 CE) was called Takht-i Jamshƒìd, the \\"Throne of Jamshid\\". However, Persepolis was actually the capital of the Achaemenid kings and was destroyed by Alexander. Similarly, the sculptured tombs of the Achaemenids and SƒÅsƒÅnians near Persepolis were believed to be images of the legendary hero Rostam, and so were called Naqsh-e Rustam. Jamshid ruled well for three hundred years. During this time longevity increased, sicknesses were banished, and peace and prosperity reigned. But Jamshid's pride grew with his power, and he began to forget that all the blessings of his reign were due to God. He boasted to his people that all of the good things they had came from him alone, and demanded that he should be accorded divine honors, as if he were the Creator. From this time the farr departed from Jamshid, and the people began to murmur and rebel against him. Jamshid repented in his heart, but his glory never returned to him. The vassal ruler of Arabia, ZahhƒÅk, under the influence of Ahriman, made war upon Jamshid, and he was welcomed by many of Jamshid's dissatisfied subjects. Jamshid fled from his capital halfway across the world, but he was finally trapped by ZahhƒÅk and brutally murdered. After a reign of seven hundred years, humanity descended from the heights of civilization back into a Dark Age. Legend of the discovery of wine King Jamshid is featured prominently in one apocryphal tale associated with the history of wine and its discovery. According to Persian legend, the king banished one of his harem ladies from his kingdom, causing her to become despondent and wishing to commit suicide. Going to the king's warehouse, the girl sought out a jar marked \\"poison\\" which contained the remnants of grapes that had spoiled and were deemed undrinkable. Unbeknownst to her, the \\"spoilage\\" was actually the result of fermentation caused by the breakdown of the grapes by yeast into alcohol. After drinking the so-called poison, the harem girl discovered its effects to be pleasant and her spirits were lifted. She took her discovery to the king, who became so enamored with this new \\"wine\\" beverage that he not only accepted the girl back into his harem but also decreed that all grapes grown in Persepolis would be devoted to winemaking. While most wine historians view this story as pure legend, there is archaeological evidence that wine was known and extensively traded by the early Persian kings.T. Pellechia (2006).

Originally known as surf trunks, later as Jams, and occasionally in British English as swim shorts, boardshorts are a style of men's and, more recently, women's summerwear. Boardshorts have evolved over the last 50 years and separated themselves from the simpler swim trunks category from which they originated. In the beginning of their history, change happened organically ‚Äì individual solutions were born out of the need to address environmental requirements and inadequacies in a garment that was increasingly used specifically for surfing. Although they are now considered a popular form of general beachwear, much of today's mass consumer acceptance is based on competing brands marketing themselves as being authentic due to their historical roots within the surfing lifestyle and their product's technical authority. The name \\"boardshorts\\" is based on their use in aquatic sports that use a board, such as surfing. They are also sometimes called \\"boardies\\" in slang, especially in Australia, and \\"baggies\\" in South Africa. Boardshorts are especially popular in North America and spread beyond surfing especially as the skater punk fashion trend got underway. They are also typically worn in men's beach volleyball. They are less popular in other parts of the world, where other suit styles are preferred.  Use and design  Boardshorts are designed to be quick-drying, and are generally made from strong and smooth polyester or nylon material. They are durable and hold up to wear from contact with a surfboard, yet are comfortable and light-weight. They are well-adapted to use in various active watersports. Boardshorts do not have an elastic waist like many swim shorts do; instead they have a more rigid waistband which opens at the front, often with a velcro fly. The waistband is also held together at the front with a lace-up tie. This double fail-safe system is in order to ensure that the shorts cannot be pulled off the body by the force of the wave when a surfer is tumbled under water during a wipeout. Another common feature of authentic surfing boardshort design is a very small pocket sealed with velcro and vented with a grommet. This is designed to be a secure place to carry a car key, house key, or hotel key card while in the water. Boardshorts traditionally have no lining, unlike traditional swim shorts. Boardshorts are normally longer than many shorts or form-fitting speedo styles of swimwear, and often (other than the waist) they have a loose or baggy appearance. The major reason for the extra length is to protect the wearer's legs from wax on the board. Surfboards are covered with a layer of sticky wax, which allows the surfer to stand on the board without slipping off. However, this wax can rip leg hair off a surfer when sitting on the board waiting for waves. Long boardshorts cover the back of the leg when sitting on the board, preventing the wax from ripping out the leg hair. The length of boardshorts is also affected by fashion trends; the length can range from mid-thigh (old school) to below the knee, covering the entire knee. In the 2000s, boardshorts were often worn low in the back, exposing the top of the buttocks. Many designs of boardshorts use vibrant color, striking patterns including Hawaiian floral images, and highlighted stitching; however not all boardshorts have these features. Although the basic design for boardshorts remains largely the same, some manufacturers have taken advantage of new technology. Because surfers and other water-sports enthusiasts commonly wear boardshorts without underwear, one of the major complaints has been about the use of velcro for the fly closure which tends to entangle pubic hair. A solution that some manufactures have come up with is to use a neoprene fly, which does not allow the fly to completely open, but provides enough stretch so that the shorts can be easily pulled on and off. Pubic hair does not get caught on the neoprene fly. To remedy another common complaint, about boardshorts stitching in the inseam area which would rub directly against the wearer's skin, many manufacturers switched to a seamless design, or use welding or glue, rather than stitches. For boardshorts that have no liner, many males choose to wear some type of tight swimwear underneath. Some male wearers prefer to wear regular underwear such as compression shorts, boxer shorts, a jockstrap, or briefs under them, while others wear nothing underneath at all. Some female surfers wear a one- piece swimsuit or bikini bottom under boardshorts. Some style of Mixed Martial Arts shorts were developed from boardshorts. Men's physique class in the National Physique Committee also uses boardshorts for onstage competition. Almost all swimsuit manufacturers and many designer brands now produce boardshorts. There are even boardshort-specific retailers, which offer an assortment of boardshorts to the surfing and wakeboarding public.

Publication history Major Disaster debuted in Green Lantern (volume 2) #43 and was created by Gardner Fox and Gil Kane. Fictional character biography Paul Booker was nothing more than a cheap crook. On the run from the police, he found an unlocked apartment window and climbed in to hide out. Unbeknownst to him, it belonged to Thomas Kalmaku, Green Lantern's former friend and confidant. Accidentally activating a hidden control panel, he discovered Kalmaku's casebook on Green Lantern. Using this, he found out the secret identities of both Green Lantern and the Flash. Armed with this knowledge, he decided to embark on a criminal career under the name of \\"Major Disaster,\\" and hired a group of criminal scientists to create devices for him capable of causing natural disasters. Using his new powers, he set out to kill the crime fighters, but was defeated and was thought to have died in the ensuing explosion. However, Disaster was wearing a device that protected him from any disaster he created. This device made his atoms reform over time, invisibly returning him to human form. However, his luck against Green Lantern failed to improve, as he was defeated again. Major Disaster's debut. Art by Murphy Anderson. After his defeat, Green Lantern used his ring to erase the memory of the Flash's secret identity and placed a mental block stopping him from telling anyone else about the Green Lantern's own identity. Major Disaster threatened the United Nations on behalf of the racist group Nurike. He attempted to destroy the UN Manhattan buildings using a master fissure he started, but was stopped by Karate Kid. He would later join forces with the Lord of Time in order to torment the Karate Kid.Karate Kid #12-15 Insanity Booker found that his power had started to internalize in him, but was growing in magnitude and slowly destroying him. He sought to remove the excess power by transferring it onto Superman, and was defeated again. Superman, aided by Batman, also defeated him when he joined General Scarr's Army of Crime. Seeking to finally kill Green Lantern, Booker threatened to destroy the Baldwin Hills Dam unless Jordan faced him. At the time, John Stewart had taken the Green Lantern mantle and when he arrived at the dam, Disaster was confused, as he still believed Jordan was Green Lantern. Believing that Green Lantern was ridiculing him, he destroyed the dam and nearly the majority of Los Angeles. Due to one of Lantern's constructs, Disaster was defeated and went insane, believing everybody to be Green Lantern. For a time, Booker served as an operative of the international crime cartel known only as SKULL when its leader, Simon Pons, recruited him into the cartel. Both Booker and SKULL ran afoul of the Outsiders when SKULL began kidnapping prominent scientists, superheroes, and millionaires. He also caused the destruction of the Outsiders' Station Markovia headquarters, making it sink off the coast of Los Angeles. Injustice League It was while in prison that Disaster first met the Mighty Bruce, a computer wizard who stole money from huge corporations to give to charity. The Mighty Bruce suddenly seemed vital to Disaster's future plans of a villainous team: the Injustice League. The team consists of Disaster as leader, the Mighty Bruce, Multi-Man, Cluemaster, Big Sir, and Clock King. Disaster and the League came into possession of a Thanagarian warship left over from a recent alien invasion of Earth and planned to use the weapons on board to attack the Justice League. Unfortunately for them, Guy Gardner, who was clearing up a Khund warship close by, intercepted their radio transmission and met the ship. He tore the craft into pieces and took the League into custody. Once free, the League decides that their criminal career would be easier in Europe and traveled to Paris to set up base, but the Justice League Europe branch had just opened its doors and the League found themselves in the same \\"French for Beginners\\" class as the JLE. A scuffle soon breaks out. They are quickly deported from France. Their next mission involves breaking the bank at the Club JLI casino on the island of Kooey Kooey Kooey. Whilst this operation was a success, they are unable to spend their winnings as the Island started to drift into the ocean (it turns out the island was sentient). Recruited by the JLA, Disaster helps avoid the ensuing geological and tectonic chaos by assisting Aquaman in anchoring the island to an underground volcano. He then chooses to stay and face justice rather than flee, despite having the opportunity. Justice League Antarctica Attempting to go legit, the Injustice League were given a chance by Maxwell Lord, the then-chief of the JLI. They somehow managed to stop a terrorist attack and were subsequently sent to the South Pole to form the Justice League Antarctica, along with other nuisances G'nort and the Scarlet Skier. The team was short lived as Disaster destroyed their embassy whilst defeating a waddle of killer penguins. The team, though lacking an embassy, stayed together, acting as bodyguards for Maxwell Lord when he was in a gunshot-induced coma. They also joined the American and European Leagues, the team called the Conglomerate, and the intergalactic bounty hunter Lobo in pitched battle against Despero. Major Disaster, in an effort to stop Despero, turned Times Square into smoking rubble. Afterwards, they departed from the League. Back to villainy Following this, the group returned to crime. They attempted to steal from the cult of Minister Sun, only to have their loot stolen back from them. Disaster's career took a boost when he accepted a deal from Neron that greatly enhanced his disaster-causing powers, making feats much easier and giving him far more disasters to cause, at the cost of his soul. Apparently at Neron's direction, Major Disaster lived up to his name when, in Aquaman vol. 5 #14, he caused a series of events to occur that resulted in the destruction of a commercial airplane and a military submarine with all onboard both vessels killed. This destruction also caused the death of Thanatos, a minor Aquaman villain who had sought to replace the King of Atlantis. Suicide Squad The Injustice League team then received an offer from the government to work on the Suicide Squad. Major Disaster agreed, even 'volunteering' Multi-Man against his will. They were sent to a small island off the coast of Iceland, to deal with a terrorist situation and an out-of- control genetic experiment. Lifeless, explosive genetic constructs who looked like kids killed Big Sir. The rest of the 'children' were shrunk by Multi-Man, who had that power in his current incarnation. Multi-Man was shot through the head soon after, but in the past he has come back from worse; on the other hand, Clock King, who had no such powers, was shot repeatedly. In the resulting chaos, Major Disaster perceived that Cluemaster saved his life at least twice, before also being shot dead. Cluemaster survived his injuries, but with multiple scars. Disaster stayed with the Squad until Superman gave him a chance to prove his heroic worth in defeating a number of Superman's foes. Hero again Batman also followed Disaster's career, and the Dark Knight chose him to serve on a substitute Justice League of America while the regular members went back in time to Atlantis, the other members of the team being Nightwing, Green Arrow, Atom, Hawkgirl, Faith, Firestorm and Jason Blood. The original League's final fate was unknown to the team, and for some time, they thought the original JLA had perished. Finally acting as a hero and receiving some respect for the first time in his career, Disaster jumped at the chance and remained with the team following their return and the subsequent battle with the powerful Atlantean sorceress Gamemnae. After joining, he became extremely close to Faith and is the only person in the League to have seen her true form. Major Disaster later joined the Justice League Elite, a covert-ops arm of the Justice League led by Sister Superior. During the JLElite series, it was revealed that he was an alcoholic. Later, while fighting with the Justice Society of America, Booker used his powers while hung-over, resulting in Hawkgirl being severely injured, and, later on, in the death of teammate Manitou Raven. At the end of the Justice League Elite series, he resigned from the League and asked them to 'wait a few months before sending any visitors in capes'. Death During Infinite Crisis, Major Disaster was present at the Battle of Metropolis. He is quickly killed by Superboy-Prime amidst the chaos.Infinite Crisis #7 During the events of Blackest Night, Major Disaster is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps along with the other heroes killed by Superboy-Prime and who head for Earth Prime to torment him. Superboy-Prime destroys them by using the black ring cycling through the power set of emotions resulting in a burst of colored energy that destroys Black Lanterns.Adventure Comics (vol. 2) #4-5 Post- Flashpoint=Powers and abilities Major Disaster's powers originally came from a set of weapons he used to cause natural disasters. Over time, exposure to these weapons made the powers internalize and now Disaster can cause chaos at will. His deal with Neron greatly enhanced his powers, enabling him to see the strands of chaos around him. The disasters he can now control theoretically range from being able to command asteroid showers without breaking a sweat to causing heart attacks, nose bleeds, and even making people trip up. He appears to have no real limitations, though he lacks fine control. He has devised a force field for himself, using his powers to redirect attacks, though he seems not to use it much. While Major Disaster is adept at creating chaos, it takes him great effort to stop disasters, whether his own or natural. In other media=Television Major Disaster, sitting between Killer Frost and Weather Wizard, as he appeared on Justice League Unlimited. * In the final season of Justice League Unlimited, Major Disaster appears as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society, taking part in a battle at Gorilla City before siding with Gorilla Grodd against Lex Luthor and being defeated by Volcana. He later switched to Luthor's side and is destroyed when Darkseid destroys the Society's ship. * Major Disaster appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by James Arnold Taylor.http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0905/09/index.htm In the episode \\"Hail the Tornado Tyrant\\", he attacks a beachside carnival demanding a significant ransom.

This usually occurs within 3‚Äì10 days after birth. The practice is performed mainly for spiritual purposes of the parents, including for the perceived spiritual connection between placenta and newborn. As of December 2008, no evidence exists to support any medical benefits for the baby. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has warned about the risks of infection as the decomposing placenta tissue becomes a nest for infectious bacteria such as Staphylococcus. In one such case a 20-hour old baby whose parents chose the ritual of UCNS was brought to hospital in agonal state, was diagnosed with sepsis and required 6-weeks long antibiotic treatment. On June 7, 2020, Sydney Morning Herald reported that a baby in Melbourne \\"died from sepsis, in the setting of a lotus birth\\" only 1 day after birth. History Although recently arisen as an alternative birth phenomenon in the West, super-delayed (1+ hours post-birth) umbilical severance is common in home births. Early American pioneers, in written diaries and letters, reported practicing nonseverance of the umbilicus as a preventative measure, as they believed it protected the infant from an open wound infection.Leavitt, Judith Walzer. Brought to Bed: Childbearing in America, 1750 to 1950. New York: Oxford University Press, 1986 pp.21-37 Modern practice thumb In the 1980s, yoga practitioners brought the idea to the United States and Australia, with the \\"lotus birth moniker, creating a link between the preciousness of the placenta and the high esteem in which the lotus is held in the Hindu and Buddhist faiths\\". Yoga master and midwife Jeannine Parvati Baker was the main advocate for the practice in the United States. The practice spread to Australia by a midwife, Shivam Rachana, founder of the International College of Spiritual Midwifery and author of the book Lotus Birth. In the full lotus birth clinical protocol, the umbilical cord, which is attached to the baby's navel and placenta, is not clamped nor cut. The baby is immediately placed on the mother's belly/chest (depending on the length of the cord) or kept in close proximity to the mother in cases when medically necessary procedures such as resuscitation may be needed. Lotus birth, after the placenta is born vaginally (often with the maternal informed choice for passive management of third stage allowing for natural detachment of the placenta within appropriate time allowed for it, with no hormonal injections such as oxytocin) or via cesarean section.stats Following birth, the placenta is simply put in a bowl or quickly wrapped in absorbent toweling and placed near the mother-baby. Caregivers step back to allow for undisturbed maternal-child bonding to occur as the primary event for an hour or more. It is only after this initial intense bonding period that the placenta is managed by rinsing, drying, applying preservatives, and positioning it in a way that allows for plentiful air circulation and proximity to the baby. Organs that are separated from their blood supply begin to rot within minutes, and the placenta is prone to infection. Over time, the cord dries and detaches from the baby's belly. This generally occurs 3‚Äì10 days postpartum.Integral Life Practice: A 21st-Century Blueprint for Physical Health, Emotional Balance, Mental Clarity, and Spiritual Awakening. Wilber, Patton, Leonard, Morelli. Integral Books, 2008. This practice requires the mother and baby to be home bound as they wait for the decomposing flesh of the placenta and umbilical cord to dry and separate from the baby. Spiritual Postpartum water immersion shortly after home birth, with umbilical nonseverance Relation to nature In the animal world, placenta is usually consumed by mother. e.g. placentophagy. There are observations that primates are keeping placenta attached to their newborns for longer period. Primatologist Jane Goodall, who was the first person to conduct long-term studies of chimpanzees in the wild, reported that they did not chew or cut their offspring's cords, instead leaving the umbilicus intact, like many other monkeys.See In the Shadow of Man by Jane Goodall. Other researchers report Fujisawa, Michiko, et al. \\"Placentophagy in wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) at Bossou, Guinea.\\" Primates 57.2 (2016): 175-180. , that chimpanzees consume placentas after birth. Though other mammals may sever their offspring's cords, they only do so after initial maternal sensory reception, unwinding of the cord, massage/cleaning (through touch), and initiation of nursing. Human Birth: An Evolutionary Perspective. Wenda Trevathan PhD, Univ of New Mexico Press, 2011. This has been observed to involve at least one hour, if left undisturbed. Energy Pseudo-scientific proponents of lotus births view the baby and the placenta as one on a cellular level, as they are from the same source, the egg and sperm conceptus. They also assert that the newborn and the placenta exist within the same quantum field, thus influencing various expressions of quantum mechanics that influence health.The New Physics of Healing lecture, Harvard Medical School, Deepak Chopra MD, Cambridge, MA , Audio recording. They claim transfers of energy & cellular information continue to take place, moving gradually from the tissue of the placenta to the baby during the drying process. Scientists challenge this claim of a metaphysical dimension related to quantum mechanics. Medicine Location of fetus and placenta in the uterus Lotus births are an extremely rare practice in hospitals. Risks The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has stated, \\"If left for a period of time after the birth, there is a risk of infection in the placenta which can consequently spread to the baby. The placenta is particularly prone to infection as it contains blood. At the post-delivery stage, it has no circulation and is essentially dead tissue,\\" and the RCOG strongly recommends that any baby that undergoes lotus birthing be monitored closely for infection. Other risks include Jaundice caused by abnormally high bilirubin and Polycythemia, which is an abnormally high percentage of red blood cells in circulation Currently, there are no statistics which show how many woman choose lotus birth. Case descriptions about adverse medical conditions related to this praxis are emerging, indicating severity of potential complications *Ittleman, Benjamin R., et al. ‚ÄúUmbilical Cord Nonseverance and Adverse Neonatal Outcomes.‚Äù Clinical pediatrics (2018): 0009922818805243Tricarico, Antonella, et al. \\"Lotus birth associated with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis.\\" Pediatrics & Neonatology 58.3 (2017): 281-282.

It broadcasts at 100 watts, and has a range of between 6 and 20 miles, depending on terrain, elevation, building density, distance between the university and the location of the listener and their antenna. It is operated by Kettering University, formerly the General Motors Institute (GMI). It is paid for by student activity fees and a special fund created by the university.  History = Early broadcasts  Radio has a long history at Kettering University. In the early 1970s an unlicensed \\"carrier current\\" radio station operated with the call letters \\"KRIB\\". The station was managed by GMI student Lewis Middaugh and Friday late-evening DJ, the late Johnnie Heiman (Dr. J). \\"Dr. J\\" moved from an Indiana nut farm to the \\"big city\\" Flint when he attended GMI. KRIB helped start him off on a very successful radio career until his death in a farming accident. KRIB was ahead of its time in the radio world. The Glett-Albanese wind-down hour, a Friday evening regular show, was one of the first \\"dueling DJ\\" spots in the nation. The show had a dedicated following and this broadcasting technique caught on across the nation. This continued until in the early 1980s, when the current student media club was formed, calling itself WGMI. The WGMI AM broadcasts were only available in the dorms, which meant that WGMI did not require any government licensing. The station, however, declined as AM broadcasts lost popularity. By 1997 there were no more broadcasts from WGMI AM 530. Despite this, there was still enough student interest to keep the radio media group alive.  WKUS Student Club  When GMI became Kettering University in 1998, the club updated its name to WKUS (Kettering University Station), and interest in a more official radio broadcast grew. Believing that Kettering should have a radio station due to its inevitable positive impacts on the university, WKUS made it one of their main goals to bring such a broadcast to campus. In effort to prepare for a radio station, a small broadcast booth was created in BJ's Lounge, and students began to pursue official licensing. Low-power FM was introduced to the public for the first time by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in January 2000. Club presidents Cortny Robison and Noelle Surprenant played an important role in filing the original FCC application in September 2000 for an LPFM building permit at a broadcast frequency of 96.7 MHz. The application, however, was held up because of a frequency adjacency issue with existing radio stations. Without a clear opportunity to amend the application, hopes for an FM radio station were put in limbo. In order to sustain itself as a student media organization while it awaited the FCC's response, WKUS reinvented itself as a student DJ service. The club promoted itself by instituting a regular Friday DJ Lunch Hour in the Great Court of Kettering's Campus Center. In addition, the club provided DJ services for student organization activities, orientation weekends, homecoming week, Greek open parties, and philanthropy events. WKUS also achieved campus recognition by regularly hosting open mic nights and an annual battle-of-the-bands. A benefit concert for the FM effort was even held at the Flint Local 432. The club operated this way for about two years, while this adjacency issue remained unchanged. Eventually, the FCC allowed the station the opportunity to amend the application and then-president Steven Proper took charge of filing the corrected application and preparing for possibility of being awarded a permit- to-build. With the time lapse from the original application, the university's official stance on the project had become unclear and so the club officers set to work on creating a proposal to secure the university's support. Foremost at the club's priorities was creating a contingency plan to raise approximately $50,000 for the construction of the tower and broadcast equipment. Work intensified when the club received notice that the FCC reviewed the amended application and had granted the university a permit-to-build. Faced with a fast approaching deadline, the student officers worked closely with Diane Vyvyan, the club's advisor, and a steering committee to secure station space, design the broadcasting rig, and create an entirely new infrastructure for the club. After many presentations and meetings with the university's leadership, the station was generously supported financially by Dr. Patrick Deese, the Dean of Student Affairs, and the Kettering Student Government (KSG). The station's construction was finished just before the deadline specified by the permit-to-build. The most visible portion of the station, the antenna tower, was erected on November 14, 2004 behind the Academic Building (original plans called for the antenna to be located on a lamp post in the athletic fields or on top of the campus center). As the station applied for an official call sign from the FCC, it was discovered that the letters WKUS, which had been associated with the LPFM effort were unavailable. The station leadership decided to instead apply for WKUF, which they envisioned standing for \\"Kettering University and Flint\\", suggesting the station's mission to be a voice for both the university and the Flint community. The \\"LP\\" suffix denotes the low power nature of the station. The selection and acquisition of broadcast equipment was overseen by David Blankenship, the club's vice- president (station engineer) and Dr. James McLaughlin from Kettering's Electrical Engineering department designed the station's antenna. Because of the time constraints surrounding the station's construction, the University hired a dedicated co-op student, Alan Delos Santos, to work on the station. On November 19, 2004 at 12:30 PM, WKUF-LP officially kicked off its broadcast with then-president Scott Porter giving a speech over the airwaves. As the speech was being read in the broadcast studio, a radio receiver was set up in the Great Court for all to hear. Steve Proper, who had originally prepared for the creation of the station, spoke as did Melverne Mills Jr., the Program Director and Steve Schwartz. Finally, Alan Delos Santos introducing the first official song broadcast by the station, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" by The Buggles (a reference to the inaugural broadcast of MTV). { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"90%\\" style=\\"background- color: #EEEEEE;\\" ----- WKUF-LP inaugural broadcast: > ‚Äî Good Afternoon.

In 2001 the \\"Museo degli strumenti musicali\\" collection opened. It includes musical instruments made by Stradivarius, Niccol√≤ Amati and Bartolomeo Cristofori which were acquired by the Florence Conservatory. Works The Galleria dell'Accademia has housed the original David by Michelangelo since 1873. The sculpture was allegedly brought to the Accademia for reasons of conservation, although other factors were involved in its move from its previous outdoor location on Piazza della Signoria. The original intention was to create a \\"Michelangelo museum\\", with original sculptures and drawings, to celebrate the fourth centenary of the artist's birth. Today, the gallery's small collection of Michelangelo's work includes his four unfinished Prisoners, intended for the tomb of Pope Julius II, and a statue of Saint Matthew, also unfinished. In 1939, these were joined by the Palestrina Piet√†, discovered in the Barberini chapel in Palestrina, though experts now consider its attribution to Michelangelo to be dubious. Other works on display are Florentine paintings from the 13th and 16th centuries, including works by Paolo Uccello, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli and Andrea del Sarto; and, from the High Renaissance, Giambologna's original full-size plaster modello for the Rape of the Sabine Women. As well as a number of Florentine Gothic paintings, the gallery houses the collection of Russian icons assembled by the Grand Dukes of the House of Lorraine, of which Leopoldo was one.

Kiviuq is an eternal Inuit wanderer. Spirits, giants, cannibals, bears and sea monsters intermingle in Kiviuq's world, creating havoc for him. He walks, or travels by dog sled, kayak, or may be borne by huge fishes. His supernatural powers allow him to overcome all manner of obstacles in his travels across the North. Stories about Kiviuq's many adventures are told across the Arctic. Kiviuq has lived a long time and has had many lives. Versions of his adventures vary with the location and the storyteller. In Greenland he is known as \\"Qooqa\\" and in Alaska he is called \\"Qayaq\\". Qajaq is short for Qajartuarungnertoq - 'He who shall always long to go roaming in his qajaq'). Franz Boas Franz Boas identified the Kiviuk legend as one of the best known of the circumpolar Inuit adventure hunter- hero-traveler legends. Versions of the legend One well-known legend of Kiviuq tells of his friendship with the grandson of an old woman. Everyone abuses and makes fun of the boy except Kiviuq. The old woman decides to get revenge. She changes her grandson into a seal and has him swim out to sea. The men follow the seal, intending to hunt it. Before the hunters reach it, however, the old woman creates a storm and drowns everyone but the seal and Kiviuq. The seal swims safely back to shore, where the old woman turns him back into a boy. Kiviuq drifts away in his kayak continuing his adventures and living with people of many foreign lands. Netsilik In a story from the Netsilik Region, the world ends when Kiviuq's face transforms completely into stone. Currently, after about 100 years of change, his face is half stone. Inuit elders say that he is in his last life now, on an adventure somewhere. However, before he dies he will return to see his people. Oral tradition has preserved many versions of the Kiviuq story-cycle, and today, a new generation of Inuit storytellers is bringing the tales to life in written or graphic form. Qikiqtaarjuk, once a Hudson Bay island and now part of the mainland is associated with Kiviuq. Kivalliq In the Kivalliq region, the story tells of an orphan boy who lived with his grandmother. The boy would be teased and bullied every day by other boys. He would go home crying every day with ripped clothes. His poor grandmother would have to sew perfectly good clothes every day with her poor eyesight. She grew tired of all the bullying her grandson went through that she had a plan. There was a seal that had been caught for them as they couldn't provide for themselves. With that seal, she asked her grandson to skin it carefully and not to puncture any holes in the skin. So as she said, the boy skinned it carefully and with no punctures. Then she asked him to put the skin on and make sure he could see through the little eye holes as if he were a seal. He followed her instructions, then he was asked to put his head in a pail of water and stay in there until he needed to breathe again. So the boy did as his grandmother asked and after he did it, he had to do it over and over until he could stay in the water so long that the sun moved when he finally comes up for air. The grandmother was so satisfied that she told him to secretly go into the water with the seal skin on and get the mean boys to notice him as if he were a seal. After he gets noticed, he had to lure them out to the ocean. The boy did what his grandmother told him to do. The mean boys noticed him and thought he was a seal. Among the mean boys were Kiviuq and his brother. After he lured them out to sea, they say he waved his arms and legs and cried as if he was a baby and asked for the wind to come. It is believed that when you were born and whatever the weather is on that day, it belongs to you. So in this case, the boy called for the wind and it came to him drowning all the mean boys but Kiviuq. Kiviuq was a strong boy; he fought and fought against the waves. He did this for many days until he found land. It is believed that he is still out there living, so old that he is hard as stone, but his heart is still beating. If his heart stops beating, they say the world will end. In Inuit art The Kiviok legend is depicted in numerous works by Canadian Inuit artists such as Jessie Oonark (1906-1985) and her daughters, Janet Kigusiuq, Victoria Mamnguqsualuk, and Miriam Marealik Qiyuk. Kigusiuq and Mamnguqsllaluk learned the stories from their grandparents in the 1930s and 1940s. Oonark's mother and father and her mother-in-law Naatak, were storytellers who shared them with their grandchildren. Oonark's well-known drawing and 1970 print by the same name‚Äì\\"Dream of the Bird Woman\\"‚Äìrefers to the Kiviuq (Qiviuk)., an Inuk who faced dangerous obstacles in his journeys by kayak, which was described by Franz Boas as the most widely known Inuit legend in the circumpolar region.

He was a founding member of the electronic dance act The Prodigy. Starting out as a dancer, he became the frontman of the group and performed on the group's two UK number one singles, \\"Firestarter\\" and \\"Breathe\\" both released in 1996. He was also the lead singer of his own band, Flint. He owned a motorcycle racing team, Team Traction Control, which won four Isle of Man TT races throughout 2015 and 2016, and competed in the British Superbike Championship. Early life Flint was born in Redbridge, London, to Clive and Yvonne Flint, on 17 September 1969.England & Wales, Birth Index: 1916‚Äì2005, September 1969, vol. 5d, p. 2989 Clive Flint worked as an engineering consultant. Keith Flint was initially raised in East London but in the mid-1970s his parents moved out to a quiet suburban cul-de-sac in Springfield, Essex. His childhood was described as unhappy and he feuded with his parents, who parted when he was young. He attended the Boswells School in Chelmsford and moved to Braintree after leaving school. Flint was described as being a \\"bright boy with dyslexia\\" and was disruptive in class. He was expelled from school at the age of 15. Flint then worked as a roofer and later enthusiastically embraced the acid house scene of the late 1980s. Musically, Flint was a childhood fan of the Jam and in the late 1980s he listened to bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees.  Music career  Flint with Prodigy guitarist Rob Holliday Flint met DJ Liam Howlett at local rave club the Barn in Braintree, Essex and said he liked Howlett's taste in music. After receiving a mixtape from Howlett, Flint came back with great enthusiasm, insisting that Howlett should be playing his tracks up on stage and that Flint, along with friend Leeroy Thornhill, would dance to them. Flint, Howlett and Thornhill were joined by MC Maxim Reality and became a successful electronic dance act called the Prodigy. In 1996, just prior to the release of the Prodigy's third album, Flint moved from being a dancer for the group to being its frontman when he performed vocals on the hit single \\"Firestarter\\" and the accompanying video showcasing Flint's new and soon-to-be iconic punk look.Roberts, David (2006). British Hit Singles & Albums. London: Guinness World Records Limited. This trend continued with the next Prodigy single \\"Breathe\\", on which Flint sang lead vocals, with Maxim backing him up. The 1997 album The Fat of the Land featured Flint's vocal contributions to several tracks, namely \\"Breathe\\", \\"Serial Thrilla\\", \\"Fuel My Fire\\" and \\"Firestarter\\". In 2002, the single \\"Baby's Got a Temper\\" was released. Flint did not perform vocals on the next Prodigy album, Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned (2004), although he did appear on the \\"Hotride ‚Äì El Batori Mix\\", on the \\"Hotride\\" single. The Prodigy album Invaders Must Die was released on 23 February 2009 and featured vocals by Flint on multiple tracks. Flint released a single titled \\"War\\" with dubstep artist Caspa in 2012. Flint experimented with solo projects, including his punk rock bands Flint, remixes by Steven ‚ÄúStitch‚Äù Held at The Recovery Room and Clever Brains Fryin'. Flint's debut album, Device #1, was cancelled before its release, leaving \\"Aim4\\" as their only single to be commercially released. Motorcycle racing Flint was a keen motorcyclist. He rode 2,400 km (1,500 miles) from England to southern Spain to attend the 2007 Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix and also raced in club competitions. He rode with Lee Thompson of the band Madness. He had his own motorcycle team, Team Traction Control, which competed in the British Supersport Championship as part of the British Superbike Championship before stepping up to the British Superbike Championship in 2017. In 2015 Team Traction Control machines won two Isle of Man TT races, ridden by Ian Hutchinson. The team and Ian Hutchinson repeated their two victories again in 2016. Personal life Flint dated television presenter Gail Porter; the couple split in 2001. In 2006, Flint married Japanese DJ Mayumi Kai who performed as DJ Gedo Super Mega Bitch. The couple were reported to be separated at the time of Flint's death. Flint had a tattoo across his stomach of the word \\"Inflicted\\", a reference to a lyric in \\"Firestarter\\". Flint was notoriously difficult on transatlantic flights; on one occasion he had to be restrained from kicking down the door to the cockpit. Prior to his marriage Flint suffered from depression and an addiction to prescription painkillers. Flint kept fit by boxing and practising jiu- jitsu. In 2014, he bought and renovated the Leather Bottle pub in Pleshey, Essex and became a popular landlord. Flint kept a jar in which customers were required to put a pound if they made a \\"firestarter\\" joke as he lit the pub's fire. He ended his connection with the pub without explanation in 2017. Flint lived in a listed Tudor manor house near Dunmow, Essex. He had a small flat track in his back garden, where he rode some of his motorcycles. Flint was a lover of animals and was an enthusiastic twitcher. He built a pond in his garden to attract birds and kept several dogs and horses at his home. Death Flint's final public performance with the Prodigy was on 5 February 2019 at Trusts Arena in Auckland, New Zealand. On Saturday 2 March 2019, Flint took part in the Chelmsford Parkrun, for the third consecutive week, in which he achieved his personal best time. On 4 March 2019, just after 8:10 am, Essex Police were called to Flint's home in North End, near Great Dunmow, Essex, in response to concerns for his welfare. Flint was pronounced dead at the scene, and the police did not treat the death as suspicious. It was later confirmed at an inquest into his death he had died as a result of hanging. The coroner adjourned the inquest until 23 July for a full hearing. Later that day, bandmate Liam Howlett stated in an Instagram post that Flint had taken his own life. The official band website then went black with an announcement of his death and the Prodigy announced that they had cancelled all forthcoming shows. It was later revealed by Emily Eavis that this included a booking at the 2019 Glastonbury Festival. The next scheduled Prodigy performance was to be the Est√©reo Picnic Festival on 6 April 2019 in Bogot√°, Colombia. Following his death, many musical artists and music industry figures from around the world paid tribute to Flint. Many tributes highlighted Flint's gentle temperament, illustrating a personal kindness, politeness and generosity that contrasted with his energetic and sometimes aggressive stage persona. Flint's funeral was held on 29 March 2019. There was a 1.5 mile public procession attended by fans from around the world followed by a private ceremony at St Mary's Church Bocking, near Braintree in Mid-Essex attended by family and friends including Flint's wife, Mayumi Kai, and bandmates Liam Howlett, Maxim, and Leeroy Thornhill. It was established by the coroners inquest on 8 May 2019 that there was insufficient evidence to conclude a suicide verdict in relation to Flint's death.  Legacy  After Flint's death, fans used the hashtag 'Firestarter4Number1' on social media in a campaign to try to get the song \\"Firestarter\\" to Number 1 in the UK Singles Chart as a mark of respect for Flint and to raise awareness for male suicide in the UK. In June 2019, fashion designer Donatella Versace dedicated her spring/summer 2020 menswear show in Milan to Keith Flint's memory. Versace, who was a friend of Flint's, dressed male models in clothing reflecting his style and they sported Flint's distinctive fire starter hair style. Whilst performing at Glastonbury Festival in June 2019, Liam Gallagher dedicated \\"Champagne Supernova\\" to Flint.

It then flows south through Essex and London and forms Barking Creek as it reaches the River Thames. The river leaves Dunmow and passes through or near a group of eight or nine villages in Essex known collectively as the Rodings, as their names are 'Roding' prefixed with various different specific names (High, Margaret, Aythorpe etc.). After Chipping Ongar, the river flows under the M25 motorway by Passingford Bridge and Abridge. Flood meadows by the river near Chigwell, looking towards Loughton, at Roding Valley Meadows Nature Reserve The river then runs between Loughton and Chigwell, where the Roding Valley Meadows make up the largest surviving area of traditionally managed river-valley habitat in Essex. This nature reserve consists of unimproved wet and dry hay meadows, rich with flora and fauna and bounded by thick hedgerows, scrubland, secondary woodland and tree plantation. The meadows stretch down to the M11 motorway and the Roding Valley tube station is situated close to the area, although Loughton or Buckhurst Hill are better placed for a visit. The river then enters Woodford. Redbridge takes its name from a crossing of the river which then passes through Ilford and Barking near the A406 North Circular Road. The River Roding through Ilford project is a government backed scheme to improve amenities along this stretch of the river. After Barking the tidal section is known as Barking Creek, which flows into the Thames at Creekmouth, where the Barking Barrier acts as a flood defence. In Essex the river forms part of the boundary between the district of Epping Forest and borough of Brentwood. The river marks the southernmost part of the boundary between the London Borough of Newham and the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.

It was the principal seaport in north-western France for six centuries, until Le Havre was built about five kilometres (three miles) downstream in the sixteenth century to take advantage of anchorages less prone to siltation. Harfleur is now on the eastern edge of Le Havre's urban area. Geography A light industrial town situated in the Pays de Caux by the banks of the Seine and L√©zarde rivers, some east of Le Havre, at the junction of the N282, D231 and D9015 roads. SNCF railways have a station here. History In Roman times, Harfleur was known as Caracotinum, the principal port of the ancient Calates. A Roman road led from Harfleur to Troyes. Another road that disappeared during the Hundred Years War linked Harfleur to F√©camp. Several Merovingian sarcophagi have been unearthed at the foot of Mount Cabert. In the Middle Ages, the town's name, Herosfloth, Harofluet or Hareflot, was still sufficiently uncorrupted to indicate its Norman origins. The suffix fleur comes from Old Norse Fl√∂the meaning \\"estuary or arm of the sea\\". The precise meaning of the prefix \\"har\\" is unknown. * 1202 saw the granting of a town charter by King John of England. * In 1281 the expansion of the port of Harfleur began. * At the beginning of the 14th century, Harfleur saw the setting-up of a Spanish (from the Aragonese Crown) and Portuguese merchants association. * 1341‚Äì1361 saw the building of the city walls, pierced by three gates (Porte d‚ÄôEure, Porte de Rouen and Montivilliers Gate). These were restored in the 15th century after the destruction caused during the Hundred Years War. The church and some timber framed houses For six centuries, Harfleur was the principal seaport of north-western France. In 1415, it was captured by Henry V of England, an event explicitly mentioned in a popular song of the day, the Agincourt Carol. Sir John Fastolf of Caister Castle Norfolk (1380‚Äì1459) later claimed to have been 'the first man over the side' of the boat when the English landed outside the town; and he certainly played a part in the siege, being invalided home afterwards. The Siege of Harfleur lasted some weeks longer than Henry V had anticipated; that was not helped by the outbreak of dysentery which afflicted and killed soldiers, knights, and nobles, with many of the sick having to be transported back to England. The town's defences were badly damaged by the siege warfare, as were many of the principal buildings of the town. In order to consolidate his victory, Henry was forced to leave a significant part of his army as a garrison for the newly captured town. Whilst Henry's intentions after the end of the siege are unclear, he had clearly entered France with an army large enough to engage the French in open battle and not merely to lay siege to one town. Henry left Harfleur, but he found his path to Calais blocked by a French army forcing him inland. The French cut off the English route and confronted them on the muddy fields near Azincourt (not the present-day Agincourt) on Saint Crispin's Day, 25 October 1415. The Battle of Agincourt ended in a decisive English victory with minimal losses - only in the hundreds - and a crushing defeat for the French with losses nearing the tens of thousands. In 1435, the people of the district of Caux, led by Jean de Grouchy, rose against the English. One hundred and four of the inhabitants opened the gates of the town to the insurgents, and forced the English occupiers out. The memory of the deed was long perpetuated by the bells of St. Martin's tolling 104 strokes. Between 1445 and 1449 the English were again in possession, but the town was recovered for the French by Dunois in 1450. In 1562, the Huguenots pillaged Harfleur and its registers and charters perished in the confusion, but its privileges were restored by Charles IX of France in 1568. It was not until 1710 that it was subjected to the \\"taille\\". In the 16th century, the port began to dwindle in importance owing to the silting up of the Seine estuary and the rise of Le Havre. In 1887, the Tancarville canal restored waterborne access to the town from both the Seine and Le Havre. After the Armistice following World War I, a huge hutted camp was established at Harfleur as a basis for dealing with the transit of thousands of troops being demobilised. The British soldier Arthur Bullock recorded in his memoir what life was like there, together with a humorous illustration of his Nissen hut, labelled 'Home Sweet Home'.Bullock, 2009, pages 99, 103, 105 Heraldry=PopulationPlaces of interest * The church of St-Martin, dating from the fourteenth century. * The seventeenth century H√¥tel de Ville (town hall). * Medieval ramparts (1350‚Äì1390) * The fifteenth century museums of fishing and of archaeology and history. * Statue of Jean de Grouchy (1875), leader of the forces who liberated Harfleur from the English in 1435.

He is the father of the director Juzo Itami. Career Originally from Matsuyama, Ehime, Itami joined the Nikkatsu studio in 1927, but the very next year moved to the actor Chiez≈ç Kataoka's company, Chiez≈ç Productions, where he made his directorial debut with Adauchi Ruten. His samurai films diverged from the norm in that they were not heroic epics of the sort which had by that time become formulaic, but rather satires that used the established symbols and iconography of the samurai culture to comment on both historical and modern society. His work was championed by the film critic Fuyuhiko Kitagawa. His most famous work is Akanishi Kakita, which is based on a story by Naoya Shiga and still survives (unlike many of his other films). In 1937, he collaborated with director Arnold Fanck on a German-Japanese co-production, starring the young Setsuko Hara. This eventually became two slightly different films: Atarashiki Tsuchi (The New Earth) in Japan, while Die Tochter des Samurai (Daughter of the Samurai) was the German version. He died of tuberculosis in 1946. His screenplays' popularity endured, however, and he is credited as a writer as recently as 1986's Kokushi Muso, a remake of his 1932 film of the same name. Family His son Yoshihiro Ikeuchi, who later changed his name to Juzo Itami, followed in his footsteps, becoming one of the pre-eminent Japanese filmmakers of the late 20th century.

Modern combat boots are designed to provide a combination of grip, ankle stability, and foot protection suitable for a rugged environment. They are traditionally made of hardened and sometimes waterproofed leather. Today, many combat boots incorporate technologies originating in civilian hiking boots, such as Gore-Tex nylon side panels, which improve ventilation and comfort. They are also often specialized for certain climates and conditions, such as jungle boots, desert boots, and cold weather boots as well as specific uses, such as tanker boots and jump boots. History Pair of hobnailed boots EarlyClassical era= The legionnaires of the Roman Empire wore hobnail boots, called caligae. By the late 1st century the army began to transition into an enclosed boot called calceus; calcei offered more protection and warmth than the caligae. They quickly became a staple in both Roman military and civilian dress. =England and United Kingdom= During the English Civil War, each soldier of the New Model Army was issued three shoes or ankle boots. After every march, the soldier would change them around to ensure they received even wear. Following the Restoration, shoes and uniforms followed the civilian pattern: shoes with buckles were used by most armies from 1660 until around 1800. Hessian boots were used by cavalry from the 18th century until World War I. Late in the Napoleonic Wars, the British army began issuing ankle boots that replaced the buckle shoes. These types of boots remained in use throughout the 19th century and were used in conflicts including the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856), First Zulu War (1879), and First Boer War (1880‚Äì1881). These in turn were replaced by ammunition boots, which were used in a variety of similar design patterns from the late 1880s until the late 1960s. The \\"George Boots\\" worn with the Officers' dress uniform and mess dress are similar, but they lack the leather counter (heel cap), the toe case (toe-cap) and omit the hobnails, and the steel heel and toe plates. =United States= Infantry regiments of the US military were equipped with calf-high boots in the War of 1812. From the 1820s until before the American Civil War soldiers were issued ankle-high boots, which were made on straight lasts. There was no \\"left\\" or \\"right\\" boot; instead, they shaped themselves to the wearer's feet over time. As a result, these boots were very uncomfortable until broken in and often resulted in blisters. They were replaced in 1858 with an improved version generally known as Jeff Davis boots after Jefferson Davis, the Secretary of War who re- equipped the army in the 1850s. These were used until the 1880s. 20th Century ‚Äì present=Australia The Australian Terra Combat Boot. Since 2000, the Australian Defence Force, primarily uses the Redback Terra Combat Boot as a replacement for the Vietnam War-era General Purpose combat boots. It was given a limited number of tests in 1999, and was later distributed in 2000. Despite the boot's general aptitude for the tasks which the ADF had first put it in place for, it still had major flaws. 90% of all negative feedback from soldiers was about its inappropriate sizing, having only 43 different sizes. Many also claimed that its sole would rot under worst-case tropical circumstances. Various military personnel have also used Rossi boots.http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/defence-snubs-samade- rossi-boots-in-favour-of-imports-for-defence-workers/news- story/8c5e61c9f93c6a838a03f5ea11129bf6 In mid 2013 a boot trial was undertaken by the ADF to find a replacement for the issued Redback Combat Boot. Boots trialled included updated versions of the Redback Boot as well as various off the shelf boots. At the conclusion of the trial the Danner TFX 8 was selected as the new ADF combat boots, they were comfortable in hot weather and provided good support. However these were found to fail prematurely and were never issued on a large scale. As a result, Redback were tasked with once again providing a range of combat boots to the ADF including a General Purpose boot, a Jungle Style boot and a Flame Resistant boot. These boots are being issued on a very limited basis and are currently undergoing limited testing. However early reports are not favourable with complaints of failing eyelets and lack of water resistance. Danners are still being retained as a 'Desert' boot or for those who don't fit the current boot. As of December 2017 the Redback Terra style combat boot is still the standard issue combat boot. Argentina In the early 20th century, Argentine soldiers wore hobnail boots with leather gaiters as well as jackboots. The combat boots worn during the Falklands War came with durable stitched rubber soles. These boots continue to be worn today in addition to the later pattern with \\"EA\\" stamped on the leg. Belgium Belgian combat boots are marked by the abbreviation \\"ABL\\" (Arm√©e Belge / Belgisch Leger), i.e. \\"Belgian armed forces\\" in French and Dutch languages. The soles of Belgian combat boots have different markings, according to the soles manufacturers: Rugak, Rubex and Solidor (models of 1970-s). Leather uppers have markings of \\"GESKA\\" (\\"Geska\\" NV) or \\"ARWY NV\\". Belgian Combats of the years 1970-90s come with stitched rubber soles. Later pattern made by Urban Body Protection International and come with British type \\"tyre tread\\" soles. France Brand new Mle 1965 combat boots made of shined black leather with direct molded soles. Combat boots of the French army are nicknamed \\"rangers\\" because of their similarity to the M 43 American model. Since the end of World War 2, three models have been manufactured. The first model was based on the 1952 combat ankle-boots on which a leather high-top cuff with two buckles were added. It was made of sturdy but very stiff brown colored cowhide leather. It was called \\"brodequin √† jambi√®re attenante Mle 1952\\" and was widely distributed from 1956 on, in priority to airborne troops engaged in Algeria. In 1961, a simplified version was introduced, the boot and the leather cuff being made in one piece. In 1965 a new version of the 1961 model was introduced made of shined black grained leather more flexible than the original one. Their soles were of a direct molded type. In 1986 a transitory model with laces and enhanced waterproofing was experimented with under the designation \\"combat boots model F 2\\" but was not adopted. The first two models had to be blackened with colored grease and shoe polish. They were issued to French soldiers; including Foreign legionnaires, until the beginning of the 1990s, and then were kept in store in case of conflict. A lot of them have been released on the market after the gendarmerie dropped the territorial defense mission at the beginning of the 21st Century. A winter model, with laces and a Gore-Tex lining was introduced in 1998. The third model and a winter model are still in service in the French army but are progressively being replaced in operation by more modern Meindl type boots. By the end of the 2000s, following the F√âLIN equipment program, the venerable Mle 1965 pattern was replaced by a Gore-Tex boot designed by Meindl (based on Meindl \\"Army Pro\\" tactical boot and itself derived from \\"Island\\" civilian boots) as the main army boot. The boot is known as \\"Botte F√©lin\\" (Felin boot) and, while there are several contractor beyond Meindl for the actual production of the design including historical French boot provider \\"Argueyrolles\\", the design is colloquially known as \\"the Meindl\\".Les rangers remplac√©es par chaussures Meindl Progressive replacement of Mle 65 was planned starting with combat units sent on missions abroad. India The leather combat boots used by the Indian Army \\"remained unchanged in design for 130 years,\\" other than the addition of a directly moulded sole. Combat boots were manufactured exclusively by the India's Ordnance Factories Board. In 2017, the Ministry of Defence authorized procurement of combat boots from private companies. The Defence Research and Development Organisation is also developing boots which will enable the tracking of soldiers in snowy locations. Norway Norwegian M77 Boots by Alfa The current combat boot used by the Norwegian Armed Forces is the M77. It was introduced in 1977 and is produced by Alfa Skofabrikk AS. The M77 boot took ten years to develop and strict requirements were set for weight, durability, water resistance, comfort, as well as ease of maintenance and good heat resistance to facilitate quicker drying. The Norwegian army frequently test boots from other manufacturers, however they have not made any plans to change boots for their soldiers. The M77 boot has notches along the sole and in the heel made for the NATO issue skis used by the Norwegian Armed Forces. The bindings for these skis fit the M77 boots as well as the thick waterproof outer shoes they can be put in. The boots can be used for skis as well as snowshoes. Sweden Tretorn. These are NOS from 1968. Over time (and with the use of shoe polish) they turn black. The military started using boots in 1779. The current model is m/90 that is designed to be both comfortable and light as well as giving ankle support. They are part of the m/90 uniform system. Switzerland The Swiss Armed Forces use three models of combat boots. The KS (from the German Kampfstiefel) 90, made from black leather and with a flat sole and used for marching on paved roads. The KS14 Schwer, made by the Italian enterprise AKU, is a heavy duty combat boot specially designed for the Swiss Army but also sold to civilians, with metal inserts to protect the foot. Every soldier receives, at beginning of boot camp two pair of KS90 and one pair of KS14. Special Forces corpsmen are outfitted with another custom made boot, developed by the German Meindl for the Swiss Army, the KS08 Schwer AGFA. The KS08 is suitable for every environment, for parachute jumps and fast roping. It allows to mount crampons for rock climbing and like the KS14, it has metal inserts to protect the feet. The army will introduce new boots (KS19 and KS19 Schwer) in the near future.https://www.vtg.admin.ch/de/organisation/kdo- ausb/aza/versuche.html#versuche_1648518825 South Africa Members of The South African National Defense Force (SANDF) are issued brown combat boots with 18 lace holes, pimple print leather and stitched rubber soles. Paratroopers (Parabats) wear a variant known as \\"Jumpers.\\" These boots are taller, having 22 lace holes, and are heavier, due to the steel plate housed within their double soles. The steel plate prevents the foot from flexing during hard landings when parachuting. They are usually polished with red polish. The colour combination of the brown leather with the red polish creates a shade of maroon that matches their maroon berets. Special Forces (Recces) are issued tan half-combat boots known as \\"Waxies.\\" These boots are an evolution of the old Rhodesian anti-tracking boots. The boots are ankle height, having 12 lace holes and an ankle strap at the top which is fastened with a buckle. The leather is thin and breathable and has a smooth wax finish, hence the name. The boots are lightweight, and have stitched rubber anti- tracking soles. These soles are completely flat, leaving behind shallow footprints that appear old and faded. Singapore Singapore Armed Forces Goretex boots The Singapore Armed Forces servicemen are currently issued the Frontier black combat boots with a \\"water outlet\\" that allows water to leak out of the boot should water ever enter the boots. These have been in use since 2012. However, the Singapore Army \\"Frontier\\" boots has received criticism from the Singapore Army reserve conscripts who were previously issued with the Gore-Tex boot. Unlike the predecessor Gore-Tex boots, which were neatly padded and waterproof, the Frontier designers removed the padding, added an ankle support strip, and added two \\"water outlets\\", making the boot very uncomfortable. With the change, the waterproof feature was also gone, resulting in criticism from the reserve conscripts who were previously issued with the Gore-Tex boots which were waterproof. However, it allowed the water to drain out of the boot after a river-crossing. Also, the boot become more ventilated (and \\"cooling\\") once the padding was removed. Durability was also an issue in both the 2nd Generation Gore-Tex (predecessor) and also some batches of the Frontiers. At times, the out-sole of the boot will come apart from the shell of the boot since the sole of the boot is only glued to the shell of the boot, not stitched. Some of the servicemen would also find their Frontier boots with its stitching coming apart after some weeks of usage. The Republic of Singapore Air Force servicemen are currently issued a modified version of the high-cut Frontier boots. The RSAF boots has padded sides, and a different out-sole, side-zip, a and composite toe fitted. The Republic of Singapore Navy servicemen are issued the modified version of the RSAF's boots. The modifications include the two water outlets (similar to the Singapore Army's standard issued boots), and a reduction in height from a high-cut boot to a mid-cut. Spain Before 1979, the Spanish army had issued triple- buckled boots, with full lace-up boots becoming common from 1984 to 1986. During the 1980s Spain changed boot suppliers and had many variations of design including Vibram or Panam√° sole, buckles or laces, and eyelets or speed lace. There were three common models: *Regular ‚Äì The general-issue boot used for instruction and campaign, it had a medium sole thickness and a few cleats. Smooth-soled versions fell into disuse over time, leaving only the instruction and campaign model. *Walking ‚Äì A lighter-constructed version of the regular boot with no cleats. It had a distinctive peculiarity as a boot to wear comfortably in the street, on flat ground, and was commonly known as vulgarmente (crude or vulgar) for its thin soles. *Paratrooper ‚Äì A boot exclusive to paratrooper units. It lacked the issue triple buckles (due to the hazard of hooking the parachute lines), and was slightly higher with extra shin-to-foot support and reinforced toe and heel. This was the general approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this period the manufacturer, Segarra, had various major problems which prevented regular deliveries on their supply contract with the Ministry of Defence. This eventually led to Segarra's closure, with Imipiel chosen as an alternative provider. Imipiel-manufactured boots were copies of the Segarra models but proved to be inferior, with poorly-attached soles that opened and peeled-off with relative ease, greatly shortening their useful lifetime. In an attempt to overcome the debonding problem, Imipiel changed the outsole, removing the cleats, and incorporated \\"panam√°\\" type soles. The Ministry initiated parallel studies for the final adoption of a new model boot, accepting new concepts on the original boot of instruction and campaign and benefits of the paratrooper- styled boot. There have been several manufacturers of these boots, including Iturri and Vidal. United Kingdom In late World War I, the standard Ammunition boots were replaced from 1917 to 1918 with the high-lacing calf- length Field Service Boots for service in the trenches to combat trench foot. The British Army introduced the DMS (Direct Moulded Sole) ankle boot in 1958. This had a moulded plastic sole and was externally similar to the World War Two Ammo Boot. However, as the leather was of shoddy quality at best, the boots leaked and could not be made satisfactorily water-resistant. The low sideless tongue also allowed water to get in over the top of the foot. Once water had got into the boot, it would evaporate through the top of the boot but not through the plastic sole, thereby keeping the foot wet and accelerating trench-foot. Although mesh insoles were issued to combat this, they were themselves fragile and could lead to 'burning' of the sole of the foot, with the result that most soldiers used commercially available sports- shoe insoles instead. This type of boot continued in service until the mid-1980s, after its unsatisfactory characteristics became a matter of public concern owing to the severe cases of trench-foot incurred during the Falklands War. The DMS boot was worn with anklets or wind-around puttees. The immediate successor of the DMS boot was the \\"Boot, Combat High\\" ‚Äì or as the soldiers themselves described it, the Boot Cardboard Horrible. Basically little more than a toecapless DMS boot extended up to mid-calf length, it was scarcely better than its predecessor. Theoretically waterproofed, it was therefore sweaty and unpleasant, and could cause acute tendinitis. A MkII version was introduced to solve this, but found little favour. Its only real advantage was that it was not supposed to be 'bulled' to a mirror shine. The Combat Assault Boots (CAB) were current issue until 2012, and were used primarily for combat training and general service although privately purchased boots were often deemed acceptable as long as they are made of black leather. The Foot Guards still use modified ammunition boots. These boots, being primarily made of leather, can be brought to a high shine for the ceremonial purpose, although boots used as every-day military footwear tend to be left comparatively dull, but clean. Various levels of shine can be achieved with CAB. However, when on exercise (in the field) or on operations, soldiers are only required to shine their boots to combat high. Jungle boots supplied by various manufactures are also commonly worn in barracks due to the ability to carry out loaded marches faster and for longer. From 2012 Armed Forces personnel will have a newly designed range of brown combat boots to replace the black and desert combat footwear they currently wear. Personnel will have the choice of five different boots depending on where they are based and what role they are in. * Desert Combat ‚Äì worn by dismounted troops conducting medium to high levels of activity in desert type environments with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. * Desert Patrol ‚Äì worn by drivers/armoured troops conducting lower levels of activity in desert type environments exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. * Temperate Combat ‚Äì worn by dismounted troops for medium to high levels of activity in temperate (European) climates. * Patrol ‚Äì worn by mounted troops (drivers/armoured troops) taking part in lower levels of activity in temperate (European) climates. * Cold Wet Weather ‚Äì worn by dismounted troops for medium to high levels of activity in temperatures down to ‚Äì 20 degrees Celsius. Each of the five boot types comes in two different styles, so personnel can wear whichever one is more comfortable for them. The new brown boots, which have been developed to match the MTP uniform worn by Service personnel, will be made in two different fittings designed for the first time to take account of the different shapes of men and women's feet. The current black boots will carry on to be worn with most non-camouflage uniforms as well as units on parade in full dress uniform, such as regiments performing ceremonial duties in central London. As of 2018, the five categories previously issued, have been changed to simplify the choices available. The Italian manufacturer AKU now supply their Pilgrim model as an option for a high liability boot alongside Altberg. United States The 1917 Trench Boot was an adaptation of the boots American manufacturers were selling to the French and Belgian armies at the beginning of World War I. In American service, it replaced the Russet Marching Shoe. The boot was made of tanned cowhide with a half middle sole covered by a full sole. Iron plates were fixed to the heel. It was a great improvement, however it lacked waterproofing. It soon evolved into the 1918 Trench Boot, also called the Pershing Boot after General John Pershing, who oversaw its creation. The boot used heavier leather in its construction, and had several minor changes from the 1917 Boot. M-1943 Combat Service Boots. The first true modern combat boots in the US Army, officially titled \\"Boots, Combat Service\\", were introduced in conjunction with the M-1943 Uniform Ensemble during World War II. They were modified service shoes, with an extended, rough-out or, more commonly, a smooth leather high-top cuff added. The cuff was closed using two buckles, allowing the boots to replace the existing service shoes and leggings worn by most soldiers with a more convenient and practical solution. The boots, and the service shoes from which they were made, had a one piece sole and heel, made from molded synthetic or reclaimed rubber. These \\"double buckle\\" boots were worn through the Korean War as a substitute for the Boots, Russet, Leather Lace Up introduced in 1948. The first type of Combat Boots, or Combat Tropical boots were based on the \\"buckle boot\\" design and worn during the early parts of the Vietnam War. Boots similar to the older IDF combat boots U.S. Army soldiers are issued their boots In 1957, the US Army switched to shined black combat boots, although the transition to black boots was not completed until late in the Vietnam War, which also saw the introduction of the jungle boot. Both of these boots had a direct molded sole. The jungle boot had a black leather lower and an olive drab canvas (later nylon) upper. Black boots continued to be worn following Vietnam, with the M81 BDU, although non-shine boots were considered by the Army. As the BDU was replaced with the MCCUU, Army Combat Uniform, and Airman Battle Uniform the services moved to more practical, non-shine footwear. The only current military service mandating shined black combat boots are the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, the Auxiliary Cadet Detachment of the Naval forces, and the Civil Air Patrol, the Auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, in conjunction with the BDU utility uniform. As the United States Marine Corps made the transition from its utility uniform to the MCCUU, they discarded shined black combat boots, and switched to more functional tan rough-out (non- shine) combat boots, with either hot weather or temperate weather versions. The standard-issue boot is the Bates Waterproof USMC combat boot. Commercial versions of this boot are authorized without limitation other than they must be at least eight inches in height and bear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor on the outer heel of each boot. Beginning on October 1, 2016, Marine Corps personnel were authorized to wear various Marine Corps Combat Boot models from Danner, Belleville, McRae and Bates, and Rugged all-terrain boots from Danner. The United States Army followed suit in 2002 with the introduction of the Army Combat Uniform, which also switched to tan rough-out combat boots, called the Army Combat Boot, and cotton socks. Commercial versions of this boot are authorized without limitation other than they must be at least eight inches in height and are no longer authorized to have a 'shoe-like' appearance. Two versions exist, a 2.5 lb temperate weather boot, and a 2 lb hot weather (desert) boot. Current manufacturers are Altama, Bates, Belleville Boot, McRae, Rocky, Warson Brands/Converse and Wellco. The US Air Force uses a sage green suede combat boot with its Airman Battle Uniform, although a tan version was authorized until 2011, when the green boot became mandatory.Air Force Instruction 36-2903 Fashion Combat boots worn as fashion apparel. Combat boots are also popular as fashion clothing in the goth, punk, grunge, heavy metal, industrial, skinhead, and BDSM subcultures, and as work boots; however, they are becoming more and more mainstream. Beyond fashion as such, many individuals choose to wear combat boots simply due to durability, comfort and other utilities, as the boots are specifically designed to be comfortable to wear in a variety of changing conditions for long durations without significant long-term wear. Combat boots have a longer lifespan than fashion boots, which can give them a vintage feel, even after recrafting. For these and other reasons, they can be purchased at military surplus stores.

It first appears in English in Francis Bacon's writings. Depending on context, the word may refer to \\"electric charge\\", \\"electric power\\" or \\"electric energy\\". Historical drift=Pre-English origins The New Latin adjective electricus, originally meaning 'of amber', was first used to refer to amber's attractive properties by William Gilbert in his 1600 text De Magnete. The term came from the classical Latin electrum, amber, from the Greek ·º§ŒªŒµŒ∫œÑœÅŒøŒΩ (elektron), amber.electric, adj. and n., Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision Mar. 2008 The origin of the Greek word is unknown, but there is speculation that it might have come from a Phoenician word elƒìkr≈èn, meaning 'shining light'. Entry into English The word electric was first used by Francis Bacon to describe materials like amber that attracted other objects.Bacon F, \\"Physiological Remains\\", before 1626, in Baconiana (1679) The first usage of the English word electricity is ascribed to Sir Thomas Browne in his 1646 work, Pseudodoxia Epidemica: In this context, an \\"Electrick\\" or \\"Electrick body\\" was a non-conductor, or an object capable of attracting \\"light bodies\\" (like bits of paper) when excited by friction; a piece of amber is \\"an Electrick\\", while a piece of iron is not. \\"Electricity\\", then, was simply the property of behaving like an electric, in the same way that \\"elasticity\\" is the property of behaving like an elastic. (\\"Electric\\" continued to be used as a noun until at least 1913 Definition of \\"electric\\" ‚Äî Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, 1828 and 1913 editions]. and is still used in this sense in the word \\"dielectric\\".) It was not until later that the definition shifted to refer to the cause of the attraction instead of the property of being attractive.Definition of \\"electricity\\" ‚Äî Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, 1828 and 1913 editions]. Charge, in the electrical sense, was first used in 1767.etymonline listing for \\"charge\\" The term quantity of electricity was once common in scientific publications. It appears frequently in the writings of Franklin, Faraday, Maxwell, Millikan, and J. J. Thomson, and was even occasionally used by Einstein. However, over the last hundred years the term \\"electricity\\" has been used by electric utility companies and the general public in a non-scientific way. Today the vast majority of publications no longer refer to electricity as meaning electric charge. Instead they speak of electricity as electromagnetic energy. The definition has drifted even further, and many authors now use the word \\"electricity\\" to mean electric current (amperes), energy flow (watts), electrical potential (volts), or electric force. Others refer to any electrical phenomena as kinds of electricity. These multiple definitions are probably the reason that Quantity of Electricity has fallen into disfavor among scientists. Physics textbooks no longer define Quantity of Electricity or Flow of Electricity. Quantity of electricity is now regarded as an archaic usage, and it has slowly been replaced by the terms charge of electricity, then quantity of electric charge, and today simply charge. Since the term electricity has increasingly become corrupted by contradictions and unscientific definitions, today's experts instead use the term charge to remove any possible confusion. Conceptual problems Despite their similarities, substituting the word \\"charge\\" for \\"electricity\\" presents new problems. Older scientific papers still exist, and their authors constantly discuss quantities of electricity and flows of electricity (meaning charge and current respectively.) Those historical authors know that their readers understand just one definition: the term electricity means charge and nothing else. Modern students who read physics papers from periods prior to 1930 (approx.) should make a continuous effort to remain aware of this issue. If historical physicists discuss quantities of \\"electricity\\" implying \\"electric charge,\\" yet the modern reader assumes they're speaking of electrical energy, the writings of those physicists will be quite difficult to understand. Another problem arises because the population of physicists abandoned the term \\"electricity\\" without much public discussion and perhaps without much awareness on the part of their community. By silently altering the meaning of common and heavily used terms, the scientific community caused an immense confusion on the part of the public. Whereas in the past the question \\"What is electricity?\\" was more or less easily answered, today the question itself has become meaningless. Is electricity a form of energy? Is electricity the same as electric charge? Is electricity nothing but a class of phenomena? Should we measure the quantity of electricity in coulombs, or should we instead use amperes, joules, or watts, or even volts? Physics texts and reference books supply no solid answer, since physicists have gradually abandoned electricity as a scientific term. And yet Quantity of Electricity still persists in its original definition in many major contemporary references. For example, in the modern SI units of physics, the SI definition of coulombNIST website SI definition of Coulomb, Table 3 is given as both the unit quantity of electric charge and also the unit quantity of electricity. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica defines the coulomb as the unit quantity of electricity. The Merriam-Webster dictionary, in definition 1a, defines electricity as charge. And until the late 1980s, the glossary in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics used the term \\"quantity of electricity\\" in place of \\"electric charge\\" in most of its definitions.CRC Handbook 85th ed. (page 2.44 image via Google books)] Chemistry students will be familiar with Faraday's discovery that a unit quantity of electricity, when passed through an electrolysis cell, liberates a certain number of atoms of metal or gas. Under these definitions, electricity is not a form of energy.

These specifications include the shapes, colors, and fonts used in road markings and signs. In the United States, all traffic control devices must legally conform to these standards. The manual is used by state and local agencies as well as private construction firms to ensure that the traffic control devices they use conform to the national standard. While some state agencies have developed their own sets of standards, including their own MUTCDs, these must substantially conform to the federal MUTCD. The National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD) advises the FHWA on additions, revisions, and changes to the MUTCD.  History  Map showing state adoption of the 2003 MUTCD At the start of the 20th century‚Äîthe early days of the rural highway‚Äîeach road was promoted and maintained by automobile clubs of private individuals, who generated revenue through club membership and increased business along cross-country routes. However, each highway had its own set of signage, usually designed to promote the highway rather than to assist in the direction and safety of travelers. In fact, conflicts between these automobile clubs frequently led to multiple sets of signs‚Äîsometimes as many as eleven‚Äîbeing erected on the same highway. Government action to begin resolving the wide variety of signage that had cropped up did not occur until the late 1910s and early 1920s, when groups from Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin began surveying existing road signs in order to develop road signage standards. They reported their findings to the Mississippi Valley Association of Highway Departments, which adopted their suggestions in 1922 for the shapes to be used for road signs. These suggestions included the familiar circular railroad crossing sign and octagonal stop sign. In January 1927, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) published the Manual and Specifications for the Manufacture, Display, and Erection of U.S. Standard Road Markers and Signs to set standards for traffic control devices used on rural roads. Despite the title, this manual did not have any guidance on pavement markings. In the archaic American English of the 1920s, the term \\"road marker\\" was sometimes used to describe traffic control devices which modern speakers would now call \\"signs.\\" In 1930, the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety (NCSHS) published the Manual on Street Traffic Signs, Signals, and Markings, which set similar standards for urban settings, but also added specific guidance on traffic signals, pavement markings, and safety zones. Although the two manuals were quite similar, both organizations immediately recognized that the existence of two slightly different manuals was unnecessarily awkward, and in 1931 AASHO and NCSHS formed a Joint Committee to develop a uniform standard for both urban streets and rural roads. This standard was the MUTCD. The original edition of the Manual on Uniform Control Devices for Streets and Highways was published in 1935. Since that time, eight more editions of the manual have been published with numerous minor updates occurring between, each taking into consideration changes in usage and size of the nation's system of roads as well as improvements in technology. In 1942, the Joint Committee was expanded to include the Institute of Transportation Engineers, then known as the Institute of Traffic Engineers. In 1948, the MUTCD was revised to change the standard color of stop signs from yellow to red. In 1960, the National Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices was again reorganized to include representatives of the National Association of Counties and the National League of Cities, then known as the American Municipal Association. In 1966, Congress passed the Highway Safety Act, P.L. 89-564, 72 Stat. 885 (1966), which is now codified at et seq. It required all states to create a highway safety program by December 31, 1968, and to adhere to uniform standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a condition of receiving federal highway-aid funds. The penalty for noncompliance was a 10% reduction in funding. In turn, taking advantage of broad rulemaking powers granted in , the Department simply adopted the entire MUTCD by reference at . ((a)(1), also enacted in 1966, authorizes federal agencies to incorporate by reference technical standards published elsewhere, which means the agency may merely cite the standard and need not republish its entire text as part of the appropriate regulation.) Thus, what was formerly a quasi-official project became an official one. States are allowed to supplement the MUTCD but must remain in \\"substantial conformance\\" with the national MUTCD and adopt changes within two years after they are adopted by FHWA. The 1971 edition of the MUTCD included several significant standards; it required all center lines on two-way roads to be painted in yellow (instead of white, which was to demarcate lanes moving in the same direction), and required that all highway guide signs (not just those on Interstate Highways) contain white text on a green background. Another major change, inspired by the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968, was that the 1971 MUTCD expressed a preference for a transition to adoption of symbols on signs in lieu of words \\"as rapidly as public acceptance and other considerations permit.\\" During what was then expected to be a transition period, the MUTCD allowed state highway departments to use optional explanatory word plaques with symbol signs and to continue using the previous standard word message signs in certain cases. Robert Conner, the chief of the traffic control systems division of the Federal Highway Administration during the 1970s, believed that symbol signs were \\"usually more effective than words in situations where reaction time and comprehension are important.\\" Conner was active in the Joint Committee and also represented the United States at international meetings on road traffic safety. Most of the repainting to the 1971 standard was done between 1971 and 1974, with a deadline of 1978 for the changeover of both the markings and signage. The adoption of several Vienna Convention-inspired symbol signs during the 1970s was a disaster. For example, the lane drop symbol sign was criticized as baffling to American drivers‚Äîwho saw a \\"big milk bottle\\"‚Äîand therefore quite dangerous, since by definition it was supposed to be used in situations where drivers were about to run out of road and needed to merge into another lane immediately. American highway safety experts ridiculed it as the \\"Rain Ahead\\" sign. Many motorists were bewildered by the symbol sign with two children on it, requiring it to be supplemented with a \\"School Xing\\" plaque. Available through ProQuest Historical Newspapers. The 1971 MUTCD's preference for a rapid transition to symbols over words quietly disappeared in the 1978 MUTCD. The 2000 and 2003 MUTCDs each eliminated a symbol sign that had long been intended to replace a word message sign: \\"Pavement Ends\\" (in 2000) and \\"Narrow Bridge\\" (in 2003). On January 2, 2008, FHWA published a Notice of Proposed Amendment in the Federal Register containing a proposal for a new edition of the MUTCD, and published the draft content of this new edition on the MUTCD website for public review and comment. Comments were accepted until the end of July 2008. The new edition was published in 2009.  Development  Proposed additions and revisions to the MUTCD are recommended to FHWA by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD), a private, non-profit organization. The NCUTCD also recommends interpretations of the MUTCD to other agencies that use the MUTCD, such as state departments of transportation. NCUTCD develops public and professional awareness of the principles of safe traffic control devices and practices, and provides a forum for qualified individuals to exchange professional information. The NCUTCD is supported by twenty-one sponsoring organizations, including transportation and engineering industry groups (such as AASHTO and ASCE), safety organizations (such as the National Safety Council and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety), and the American Automobile Association. Each sponsoring organization promotes members to serve as voting delegates within the NCUTCD.  Other jurisdictions  The United States is among the majority of countries around the world that have not ratified the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (based primarily on European signage traditions), and the FHWA MUTCD differs significantly from the Vienna Convention. Apart from the 1971 effort to adopt several Vienna Convention-inspired symbol signs (as explained above), achieving worldwide uniformity in traffic control devices was never a priority for AASHTO because the number of motorists driving regularly on multiple continents was relatively small during the 20th century. Warning signs (alerting drivers of unexpected or hazardous conditions) tend to be more verbose than their Vienna Convention counterparts. On the other hand, MUTCD guide signs (directing or informing road users of their location or of destinations) tend to be less verbose, since they are optimized for reading at high speeds on freeways and expressways. The MUTCD has become widely influential outside the United States; for example, the use of yellow stripes to divide opposing traffic has been widely adopted throughout the Western Hemisphere. Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland use many road signs influenced by the MUTCD. Canada For road signs in Canada, the Transportation Association of Canada (TAC)TAC publishes its own Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Canada for use by Canadian jurisdictions. Although it serves a similar role to the FHWA MUTCD, it has been independently developed and has a number of key differences with its US counterpart, most notably the inclusion of bilingual (English/French) signage for jurisdictions such as New Brunswick and Ontario with significant anglophone and francophone population, a heavier reliance on symbols rather than text legends, and metric measurements instead of imperial. The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) also has historically used its own MUTCD which bore many similarities to the TAC MUTCDC. However, as of approximately 2000, MTO has been developing the Ontario Traffic Manual (OTM), a series of smaller volumes each covering different aspects of traffic control (e.g., regulatory signs, warning signs, sign design principles, traffic signals, etc.).

Olson is the Orioles' all-time saves leader with 160 saves. High school and college Olson attended Omaha Northwest High School in Omaha, Nebraska, where he was a pitcher and led the Huskies to four straight state titles. His father, Bill Olson, was his high school coach. Olson appeared in Sports Illustrated's \\"Faces In The Crowd\\" section for the 07-16-84 Vol 61, No. 3. In the state championship game of his senior year, Olson threw a no-hitter. After graduating from high school in 1985, Olson went on to pitch at Auburn University for three seasons. Professional career Olson was drafted by the Orioles in the 1st round (4th pick) of the 1988 amateur draft, and was given a $200,000 signing bonus before making his major league debut on September 2, 1988. A reliever, he threw what baseball historian Sheldon Stewart referred to as a \\"blazing fastball and devastating curve\\". In 1989, Olson became the first reliever to win the American League Rookie of the Year Award. Olson also set an American League rookie record with 27 saves, and had a 5-2 mark with a 1.69 ERA and 90 strikeouts in 85 innings. Selected to the All-Star team in 1990, Olson set a club record of 37 saves during the season and collected 31 and 36 in the next two years. On July 13, 1991, Olson combined with 3 other Baltimore pitchers in a no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics. In August 1993, Olson suffered a torn elbow ligament injury that sidelined him for the rest of the year. He finished with 29 saves and a career low 1.60 ERA, but Baltimore opted not to take a risk with him and signed Lee Smith as their new closer. Olson struggled with a succession of injuries over the next years, playing for seven different teams from 1994-97. In 1998, Olson enjoyed a fruitful comeback with the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks. He set a franchise record of 30 saves (broken by Byung-hyun Kim in 2002) and was also part of a rare feat. On May 28, with Arizona leading the San Francisco Giants 8-5, Olson began the bottom of the ninth inning by striking out Darryl Hamilton, but the Giants then loaded the bases with two walks and a hit before Stan Javier had an RBI grounder that made it 8-6. After pinch-hitter J. T. Snow walked to load the bases, manager Buck Showalter ordered Olson to intentionally walk Barry Bonds, forcing home a run, and bringing up Brent Mayne, who worked the count full before he lined to right field for the third out. Olson put together one of the strangest saves imaginable, working around six walks in 1.1 innings. He threw 49 pitches (not counting the bases-loaded intentional walk) and only 22 of them were for strikes. Olson's only Major League hit was a home run during his last official at-bat of the 1998 season. Olson was replaced by new closer Matt Mantei in 1999. He finished his career as a setup man for the Dodgers. In a 14-year career, Olson compiled 217 saves with a 40-39 record, 588 strikeouts, and a 3.46 ERA in 672 innings pitched. On March 19, 2008, Olson was elected to the Orioles Hall of Fame. He was inducted during the pre-game ceremony before the Orioles vs Rangers game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards on August 9, 2008. He is currently a scout for the San Diego Padres. In 2016, Olson served as pitching coach to actress Kylie Bunbury, who played \\"Ginny Baker\\" on the scripted FOX television series Pitch. The series was about Major League Baseball's first female player, Ginny Baker, who was a pitcher for the San Diego Padres. Major League Baseball was a co-producer of the series.

The song is set to the melody of \\"Lauriger Horatius\\"Code of Maryland, State Government, Title 13, ¬ß 13-307. ‚Äî the same tune \\"O Tannenbaum\\" was taken from. The lyrics are from a nine-stanza poem written by James Ryder Randall (1839‚Äì1908) in 1861. The state's general assembly adopted \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\" as the state song on April 29, 1939.Maryland State Archives (2004). Maryland State Song - \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\". Retrieved 27 Dec. 2004. The song's words refer to Maryland's history and geography and specifically mention several historical figures of importance to the state. The song calls for Marylanders to fight against the U.S. and was used across the Confederacy during the Civil War as a battle hymn.Catton, Bruce. The Coming Fury [1961]. p. 352. It has been called America's \\"most martial poem\\".Randall, James Ryder. 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, p. 639. Due to its origin in reaction to the Baltimore riot of 1861 and Randall's support for the Confederate States, it includes lyrics that refer to President Abraham Lincoln as \\"the tyrant\\", \\"the despot\\", and \\"the Vandal\\", and to the Union as \\"Northern scum\\", as well as referring to the phrase \\"Sic semper tyrannis\\", which was the slogan later shouted by Marylander John Wilkes Booth when he assassinated Lincoln. Diary Entry of John Wilkes Booth For these reasons, occasional attempts have been made to replace it as Maryland's state song,Another Try for Maryland's State Song?, The Washington Post, April 6, 2000. but to date, all such attempts have failed.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/story/2009/03/01/ST2009030100010.html History The poem was a result of events at the beginning of the Civil War. During the secession crisis, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (referred to in the poem as \\"the despot\\" and \\"the tyrant\\") ordered U.S. troops to be brought to Washington, D.C., to protect the capital and to prepare for war with the seceding southern states. Many of these troops were brought through Baltimore City, a major transportation hub. There was considerable Confederate sympathy in Maryland at the time, as well as a large number of residents who objected to waging a war against their southern neighbors. Riots ensued as Union troops came through Baltimore on their way south in April 1861 and were attacked by mobs. A number of Union troops and Baltimore residents were killed in the Baltimore riots. The Maryland legislature summarized the state's ambivalent feelings when it met soon after, on April 29, voting 53‚Äì13 against secession,Mitchell, p.87 but also voting not to reopen rail links with the North, and requesting that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. At this time the legislature seems to have wanted to avoid involvement in a war against its seceding neighbors. The contentious issue of troop transport through Maryland would lead one month later to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, also a Marylander, penning one of the United States' most controversial wartime rulings, Ex parte Merryman.McGinty (2011) p. 173. \\"The decision was controversial on the day it was announced, and it has remained controversial ever since.\\" Neely (2011) p. 65 Quoting Lincoln biographer James G. Randall,\\"Perhaps no other feature of Union policy was more widely criticized nor more strenuously defended.\\" One of the reported victims of these troop transport riots was Francis X. Ward, a friend of James Ryder Randall. Randall, a native Marylander, was teaching at Poydras College in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, at the time and, moved by the news of his friend's death, wrote the nine-stanza poem, \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\". The poem was a plea to his home state of Maryland to secede from the Union and join the Confederacy. Randall later claimed the poem was written \\"almost involuntarily\\" in the middle of the night on April 26, 1861. Being unable to sleep after hearing the news, he claimed \\"some powerful spirit appeared to possess me ... the whole poem was dashed off rapidly ... [under] what may be called a conflagration of the senses, if not an inspiration of the intellect\\".Alice Fahs. The Imagined Civil War: Popular Literature of the North and South, 1861-1865. The University of North Carolina Press, 2001: 80. The poem contains many references to the Revolutionary War as well as to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and Maryland figures in that war (many of whom have fallen into obscurity). It was first published in the New Orleans Sunday Delta. The poem was quickly turned into a song ‚Äî put to the tune of \\"Lauriger Horatius\\" ‚Äî by Baltimore resident Jennie Cary, sister of Hetty Cary. It became instantly popular in Maryland, aided by a series of unpopular federal actions there, and throughout the South. It was sometimes called \\"the Marseillaise of the South\\". Confederate States Army bands played the song after they crossed into Maryland territory during the Maryland Campaign in 1862. By 1864, the Southern Punch noted the song was \\"decidedly most popular\\" among the \\"claimants of a national song\\" for the Confederacy.Alice Fahs. The Imagined Civil War: Popular Literature of the North and South, 1861-1865. The University of North Carolina Press, 2001: 79‚Äì80. According to some accounts, General Robert E. Lee ordered his troops to sing \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\", as they entered the town of Frederick, Maryland, but his troops received a cold response, as Frederick was located in the unionist western portion of the state.See James M. MacPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford University Press, 1988), 535-36, Amazon Kindle Location 11129-45. At least one Confederate regimental band also played the song as Lee's troops retreated back across the Potomac after the bloody Battle of Antietam.

This happens most often with minor planets, but sometimes a comet, a dwarf planet, a natural satellite, or a star is found in old archived images; even exoplanet precovery observations have been obtained. \\"Precovery\\" refers to a pre-discovery image; \\"recovery\\" refers to imaging of a body which was lost to our view (as behind the Sun), but is now visible again (also see lost minor planet and lost comet). Orbit determination requires measuring an object's position on multiple occasions. The longer the interval between observations, the more accurately the orbit can be calculated; however, for a newly discovered object, only a few days' or weeks' worth of measured positions may be available, sufficient only for a preliminary (imprecise) orbit calculation. When an object is of particular interest (such as asteroids with a chance of impacting Earth), researchers begin a search for precovery images. Using the preliminary orbit calculation to predict where the object might appear on old archival images, those images (sometimes decades old) are searched to see if it had in fact already been photographed. If so, a far longer observation arc can allow a far more precise orbital calculation. Until fast computers were widely available, it was impractical to analyze and measure images for possible minor planet discoveries because this required much human labor. Usually, such images were made years or decades earlier for other purposes (studies of galaxies, etc.), and it was not worth the time it took to look for precovery images of ordinary asteroids. Today, computers can easily analyze digital astronomical images and compare them to star catalogs containing up to a billion or so star positions to see if one of the \\"stars\\" is actually a precovery image of the newly discovered object. This technique has been used since the mid-1990s to determine the orbits of a great many minor planets.  Examples  In an extreme case of precovery, an object was discovered on December 31, 2000, designated , and a near-Earth orbit was calculated. Precovery revealed that it had previously been discovered on February 23, 1950 and given the provisional designation 1950 DA, and then been lost for half a century. The exceptionally long observation period allowed an unusually precise orbit calculation, and the asteroid was determined to have a small chance of colliding with the Earth. After an asteroid's orbit is calculated with sufficient precision, it can be assigned a number prefix (in this case, (29075) 1950 DA). The asteroid 69230 Hermes was found in 2003 and numbered, but was found to be a discovery from 1937 which had been named \\"Hermes\\", but subsequently lost; its old name was reinstated. Centaur 2060 Chiron was discovered in 1977, and precovery images from 1895 have been located. Another extreme case of precovery concerns Neptune. Galileo observed Neptune on both December 28, 1612 and January 27, 1613, when it was in a portion of its orbit where it was nearly directly behind Jupiter as seen from Earth. Because Neptune moves very slowly and is very faint relative to other known planets of that time, Galileo mistook it for a fixed star, leaving the planet undiscovered until 1846. He did note that the \\"star\\" Neptune did seem to move, noting that between his two observations its apparent distance from another star had changed. However, unlike photographic images, drawings such as those Galileo made are usually not precise enough to be of use in refining an object's orbit. In 1795, Lalande also mistook Neptune for a star. In 1690, John Flamsteed did the same with Uranus, even cataloging it as \\"34 Tauri\\". One of the most extreme cases postulated is of the discovery of Ganymede. This again involved Galileo, who is usually stated to have discovered it in 1610. It has been postulated by Xi Zezong that Ganymede was discovered by the Chinese astronomer Gan De in 365 B.C., when he catalogued it as a small red star next to Jupiter during naked eye observation.Galilean Moons‚Äì Gan De. Available at http://www.mediander.com/connects/12505/galilean- moons/#!/topic/1989270/ Accessed 27th November 2017. It may be noted that by apparent magnitude, Ganymede is supposedly (barely) visible with the naked eye, but it is usually lost in the glare of its parent planet.

It is found primarily in the Caspian and Black Sea basins, and formerly in the Adriatic Sea. Going on maximum size, it is the third most massive living species of bony fish.Huso huso. Fishbase.com. Accessed on 11 January 2008 Heavily fished for the female's valuable roe, known as beluga caviar, wild populations have been greatly reduced by overfishing and poaching. Etymology The common name for the sturgeon, as for the unrelated beluga whale, is derived from the Russian word –±–µ–ª—ã–π (belyj), meaning \\"white\\", probably referring to the extensive pale colour on the flanks and belly in beluga compared to other sturgeons. Other common names are morun (Ro), moruna (Bu), viza (Hu), vyza velka (Cz), vyza (Slov), storione ladano or storione attilo (It), grand esturgeon (F), Hausen (G).Vecsei, P., Sucui, R., & Peterson, D. (2002). Threatened fishes of the world: Huso huso (Linnaeus, 1758)(Acipenseridae). Environmental Biology of Fishes, 65(3), 363-365. Description Huso huso, comparison between an adult (above) and a juvenile (below) Huso huso shows typical characteristics of sturgeons, i.e., elongated body, heterocercal tail, partially cartilaginous skeleton, naked skin, longitudinal series of scutes. The dorsal fin has 48 to 81 soft rays, the anal fin, much shorter, has 22 to 41 soft rays. The series of longitudinal scutes are five: dorsal (1 series, 9-17 scutes), lateral (2 series, one per side, 28-60 scutes each) and ventral series (2 series, one per side, 7-14 scutes each). The surface of the skin is covered by fine denticles. The rostrum is conical and contains numerous sensory pits on both ventral and dorsal surfaces. Large, crescent shaped mouth, protractile, with the upper lip continuous while lower lip is interrupted by a large gap. The barbels are laterally compressed with foliate appendages, arranged in two pairs, originating midway or closer to the mouth than the tip of the snout. However, during the growth Beluga sturgeon shows evident morphologic changes: * juveniles are slender, head is quite narrow with a mouth ventrally placed but projecting upward, snout is thin and pointed (almost 1/2 of the head), scutes are evident, back and flancs are dark grey or black, and belly is white; * Adult are heavy-set, spindle-shaped but large individuals are humpbacked, head is massive with a very large protractil mouth which gradually moves in an almost frontal position during the growth, snout is quite short (1/3 to 1/4 of the head), scutes gradually undergo absorption and decrease in number with age, colouring is blue gray or dark brown with silver or gray flancs and white belly, dark dorsum contrasts strongly against the rest of the body; * Very old specimens are stocky, with an impressive head and an enormous mouth.http://www.ittiofauna.org/webmuseum/pesciossei/acipenseriformes/acipenseridae/huso/husohuso/h_huso.htm  Size  A 1000-kg, 4.17-m-long beluga fish from the Volga River (National Museum of Tatarstan, Kazan, Russia) Among all extant bony fishes, Beluga sturgeon may be considered a rival to the ocean sunfish (Mola sp.) as the most massive fish, the second longest fish after the giant oarfish (Regalecus glesne), as well as the largest freshwater fish in the world. The beluga also rivals the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the greenland shark (somniosus microcephalus) for the title of largest actively predatory fish.Burton, M., & Burton, R.

Today, mature belugas that are caught are generally long and weigh . The female beluga is typically 20% larger than the male. An exceptionally big beluga caught recently reportedly weighed and measured . Biology A sub-adult beluga sturgeon swimming in an aquarium. Spawning Like most sturgeons, the beluga is anadromous, migrating upstream in rivers to spawn on clean, hard substrate, which offers both support and cover to their sticky/adhesive eggs. Spawning biology and development of larval stages of sturgeons - the most ancient fish of the Danube - co-evolved with the formation of the Danube valley, resulting in very different survival strategies of their early life stages. This is in brief the accepted explanation of the fact that different individuals of the same long- migratory species spawned as far upstream as Danube river km 1700, while others spawned at river km 100. To make the long journey to very distant spawning grounds, sturgeons adopted to a two-stage migration strategy entering the river in fall and staying over winter in reaches of the river offering adequate substrate and water flow resting conditions. Only very few locations of existing wintering and spawning grounds for sturgeons are presently known in the Lower Danube River, none in the Middle Danube River and Upper Danube River. The same situation concerns nursery sites the young sturgeons depend on during their journey to the Black Sea Males attain sexual maturity at 12‚Äì16 years of age, whereas females do so at 16‚Äì22 years. In both sexes, they will go to spawn every 4 to 7 years. At one time, beluga sturgeons could migrate up to upriver to spawn but dams in almost every major tributary they utilize has impeded historic spawning routes. The female lays her eggs on gravel from underwater. Upon hatching, the embryo are long, 10‚Äì14 days later when they absorb their yolk sack, the length is . Thereafter, the larvae usually subsist on benthic invertebrates but at as small as in length will switch to a fish- based diet. While swimming back to the ocean, the young sturgeons may cover up to a day.Pirogovskii, M.I., L.I. Sokolov & V.P. Vasil‚Äôev. 1989. Huso huso (Linnaeus, 1758). pp. 295‚Äì344. In: J. Holc√≠k (ed.)

The sturgeons and paddlefishes of the world. Aquatech Publications. 202 pp. Diet Fingerling of Huso huso eating a small fish in aquarium Huso huso is a pelagic predator which local distribution is not influenced by the nature of the substrates, unlike most of the sturgeons which show demersal attitude. The prey is sucked into the mouth opening extremely quickly the jaws and extending forward the lips. Juveniles feed on benthic invertebrates in rivers and shallow coastal waters, where they grow quickly, then, at the length of 8‚Äì10 cm, they become largely piscivorous. Different diets have been observed throughout the distribution range of Beluga sturgeon, as well as according to the stage of migration of the spawners, anyway it mainly consists for adults in a great diversity of large fish (73% of the diet). Additional food items may include molluscs and crustaceans, even aquatic birds and young seals (Caspian seals, Pusa caspica). The piscivorous diet of Beluga sturgeon tendentially changes with age: in the Caspian Sea, it mainly consists in Clupeonella sp. for juveniles smaller than 40 cm, different species of Gobiidae for fish ranging between 40 and 280 cm, then mullets, Alosa sp. and other sturgeons for the biggest. An adult H. huso eating a small sturgeon In brackish environments of the Ponto-Caspian basin, the genera Alosa, Aspius and Engraulis are the preferred prey. In estuaries and rivers of the same area, migrating spawners eat various cyprinids, mainly Cyprinus carpio and Rutilus rutilus, Sander lucioperca and, among sturgeons, Acipenser ruthenus is the main prey. It is little known about the diet of the Adriatic population, it has been reported that in marine and brackish environments adult H. huso foraged primarily on molluscs (Cephalopoda, of which common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, and European squid, Loligo vulgaris, are particularly common in the Adriatic sea) and fish belonging to the families Gadidae, Pleuronectidae, Gobiidae, Clupeidae, Scombridae and Mugilidae, but also on big crustaceans; in the rivers, they fed mainly on local Cyprinidae.  Uses  The caviar of a beluga sturgeon, the main reason for the massive overharvesting of this species. Beluga caviar is considered a delicacy worldwide. The flesh of the beluga, though, is not particularly renowned but is a hearty white meat similar to that of swordfish. Beluga caviar has long been scarce and expensive and its endangered status has made its caviar even more expensive throughout the world. Its air bladder is said to make the best isinglass.  Status  IUCN classifies the beluga as critically endangered. It is a protected species listed in appendix III of the Bern Convention, and its trade is restricted under CITES appendix II. The Mediterranean population is strongly protected under appendix II of the Bern Convention, prohibiting any intentional killing of these fish. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has banned imports of beluga caviar and other beluga products from the Caspian Sea since 6 October 2005, after listing beluga sturgeon under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

The Family Game received several awards including the best movie of the year as selected by Japanese critics. Although the movie missed the Japan Academy Prize for the Best Picture (losing out to Palme d'Or Winner The Ballad of Narayama), Ichir≈çta Miyagawa was awarded Newcomer of the Year. Plot summary The Numata family consists of the father, K≈çsuke (Juzo Itami); mother, Chikako (Saori Yuki); and two sons, Shinichi (Jun'ichi Tsujita) and Shigeyuki (Ichir≈çta Miyagawa). Shigeyuki is a junior high school student. He will soon be taking a high school entrance examination. Unlike his high school student brother, Shinichi, who lives up to the father's expectations, Shigeyuki‚Äôs grades are poor, and he is only interested in roller coasters. His father finds a private tutor, Yoshimoto (Y≈´saku Matsuda), for Shigeyuki and imposes all responsibilities for his exam on the tutor. Yoshimoto's behaviour is extremely strange, including kissing Shigeyuki and hitting him painfully hard. Even though Yoshimoto is a seventh year student of a third-rate university, Shigeyuki‚Äôs marks become better and better. Eventually he passes the exam for the high school. At a family celebration, Yoshimoto begins to riot, hitting people, pouring wine on their heads, and throwing spaghetti around wildly.

Themes The film focuses on a dysfunctional middle-class nuclear family--each family member is connected not internally, but through the social roles they are expected to take on, and the pressure of these social expectations further accelerates the breakdown in their communication. Japanese critics saw the film as showing the change to a new epoch and a post- modern sensibility. One said that if Japanese before and during the high growth economy defined their reality first though \\"ideals\\" and then through \\"dreams,\\" and tried to change reality according to those visions, then in the post-high growth era, from the mid-1970s on, they no longer tried to change reality but to remain content with reality as \\"fiction.\\" The Numatas' table is not unrealistic, but fixes the \\"un-naturalness\\" of reality itself in an age when families watch television while eating. This epochal shift was marked, another critic said, by Morita's films and the works of novelist Haruki Murakami and musician Sakamoto Ryuichi, leading to a culture which celebrates meaninglessness.quoted in Aaron Gerow, \\"Playing with Postmodernism: Morita Yoshimitsu‚Äôs Family Game,\\" in Alastair Phillips and Julian Stringer, ed.Japanese Cinema: Texts and Contexts (London; New York: Routledge, 2007). p. 242.

He is possibly the Harpocration mentioned by Julius Capitolinus (Life of Verus, 2) as the Greek tutor of Lucius Verus (2nd century AD); some authorities place him much later, on the ground that he borrowed from Athenaeus.

As nearly all the lexicons to the Greek orators have been lost, Harpocration's work is especially valuable. Amongst his authorities were the writers of Atthides (histories of Attica), the grammarian Didymus Chalcenterus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and the lexicographer Dionysius, son of Tryphon. The book also contains contributions to the history of Attic oratory and Greek literature generally. The Collection of Florid Expressions, a sort of anthology or chrestomathy attributed to him by the Suda, is lost, but elements of it survive in later lexica.
