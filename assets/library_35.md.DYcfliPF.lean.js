Tensions between the Germanic tribes and the Romans began as early as 17 BC with Clades Lolliana, where the 5th Legion under Marcus Lollius was defeated by the tribes Sugambri, Usipetes, and Tencteri. Rome's emperor Augustus responded by rapidly developing military infrastructure across Gaul. His general, Nero Claudius Drusus, began building forts along the Rhine in 13 BC and launched a retaliatory campaign across the Rhine in 12 BC. Drusus led three more campaigns against the Germanic tribes in the years 11–9 BC. For the campaign of 10 BC, he was celebrated as being the Roman who traveled farthest east into Northern Europe. Succeeding generals would continue attacking across the Rhine until AD 16, notably Publius Quinctilius Varus in AD 9. During the return trip from his campaign, Varus was betrayed by Arminius, who was an ally of Rome and leader of the Cherusci. Roman expansion into Germania Magna had stopped as a result, and all campaigns immediately after were in retaliation of the Clades Variana and to prove that Roman military might could still overcome German lands. The last general to lead Roman forces in the region during this time was Germanicus, the adoptive son of emperor Tiberius, who in AD 16 had launched the final major military expedition by Rome into Germania. The Roman Empire would launch no other major incursion into Germany until Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180) during the Marcomannic Wars. Background In 27 BC, Augustus assumed power and Agrippa was sent to quell the uprisings in Gallia. During the Gallic uprisings weapons were smuggled into Gaul across the Rhine from Germania to supply the insurrection. At the time, Rome's military presence in the Rhineland was small and its only military operations there were punitive expeditions to punish intruders. It was seen as more important to secure Gaul and wipe out any signs of resistance there. After Gaul had been pacified, improvements including those to the Roman road network in 20 BC by Agrippa were made. Rome increased its military presence on the Rhine and several forts were constructed there between 19 and 17 BC. Augustus thought that the future prosperity of the Empire depended on the expansion of its borders, and Germania had become the next target for imperial expansion. After capturing and executing Roman soldiers east of the Rhine in 17/16 BC, the tribes Sugambri, Usipetes, and Tencteri crossed the river and attacked a Roman cavalry unit. Unexpectedly, they came across the 5th legion under Marcus Lollius, whom they defeated and whose eagle they captured. This defeat convinced Augustus to reorganize and improve the military presence in Gaul in order to prepare the region for campaigns across the Rhine. An attack soon after by Lollius and Augustus caused the invaders to retreat back to Germania and sue for peace with Rome. From 16 to 13 BC, Augustus was active in Gaul. In preparation for the coming campaigns, Augustus established a mint at Lugdunum (Lyon) in Gaul, to supply a means of coining money to pay the soldiers, organized a census for collecting taxes in Gaul, and coordinated the establishment of military bases on the west bank of the Rhine. Campaigns before the Clades Variana=Campaigns of Drusus= Campaigns of Drusus in Germania. Nero Claudius Drusus, an experienced general and stepson of Augustus, was made governor of Gaul in 13 BC. The following year saw an uprising in Gaul – a response to the Roman census and taxation policy set in place by Augustus. For most of the following year he conducted reconnaissance and dealt with supply and communications. He also had several forts built along the Rhine, including: * Argentoratum (Strasburg, France) * Moguntiacum (Mainz, Germany) * Castra Vetera (Xanten, Germany) Drusus first saw action following an incursion by the Sugambri and the Usipetes into Gaul. He repelled the attack and then launched a retaliatory attack across the Rhine. This marked the beginning of Rome's 28 years of campaigns across the lower Rhine. He crossed the Rhine with his army and invaded the land of the Usipetes. He then marched north against the Sicambri and pillaged their lands. Travelling down the Rhine and landing in what is now the Netherlands, he conquered the Frisians, who thereafter served in his army as allies. Then, he attacked the Chauci, who lived in northwestern Germany in what is now Lower Saxony. Around winter he recrossed the Rhine, and returned to Rome. The following spring, Drusus began his second campaign across the Rhine. He first subdued the Usipetes, and then marched east to the Visurgis (Weser River). Then, he passed through the territory of the Cherusci, whose territory stretched from the Ems to the Elbe, and pushed as far east as the Weser. This was the furthest east into northern Europe that a Roman general had ever traveled, a feat which won him much renown. Between depleted supplies and the coming winter, he decided to march back to friendly territory. On the return trip, Drusus' legions were nearly destroyed by German warriors taking advantage of the terrain to harass them. He was made consul for the following year, and it was voted that the doors to the Temple of Janus be closed, a sign the empire was at peace. However, peace didn't last, for in the spring of 10 BC, he once again campaigned across the Rhine and spent the majority of the year attacking the Chatti. In his third campaign, he conquered the Chatti and other German tribes, and then returned to Rome. As he had done before, Drusus returned to Rome at the end of the campaign season. In 9 BC, he began his fourth campaign, this time as consul. Despite bad omens, Drusus again attacked the Chatti and advanced as far as the territory of the Suebi, 'conquering with difficulty the territory traversed and defeating the forces that attacked him only after considerable bloodshed'. Afterwards, he once again attacked the Cherusci, and followed the retreating Cherusci across the Weser River, and advanced as far as the Elbe, \\"pillaging everything in his way\\", as Cassius Dio puts it. Ovid states that Drusus extended Rome's dominion to new lands that had only been discovered recently. On his way back to the Rhine, Drusus fell from his horse and was badly wounded. His injury became seriously infected, and after thirty days, Drusus died from the disease, most likely gangrene. When Augustus learned Drusus was sick, he sent Tiberius to quickly go to him. Ovid states Tiberius was at the city of Pavia at the time, and when he had learned of his brother's condition, and rode to be at his dying brother's side. He arrived in time, but it wasn't long before Drusus drew his last breath. =Campaigns of Tiberius, Ahenobarbus and Vinicius= Invasions of Tiberius and Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus in circa 3 BCE–6 CE After Drusus' death, Tiberius was given command of the Rhine's forces and waged two campaigns within Germania over the course of 8 and 7 BC. He marched his army between the Rhine and the Elbe, and met little resistance except from the Sicambri. Tiberius came close to exterminating the Sicambri, and had those who survived transported to the Roman side of the Rhine, where they could be watched more closely. Velleius Paterculus portrays Germany as essentially conquered, but Cassiodorus writing in the 6th century AD asserts that all Germans living between the Elbe and the Rhine had submitted to Roman power. The military situation in Germany was very different from what was suggested by imperial propaganda. In 3 BC, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus is the commander in Germany, whom Augustus appointed 3 years before (6 BC), he reached and crossed the Elbe with his army. Under his command were constructed causeways across the bogs somewhere in the region between the Ems and the Rhine, called pontes longi. The next year, conflicts between the Rome and the Cherusci flared up. While the elite members of one faction sought stronger ties with Roman leaders, the Cherusci as a whole would continue to resist for the next twenty years. Although Ahenobarbus had marched to the Elbe and directed the construction of infrastructure in the region east of the Rhine, he did not do well against the Cherusci warrior bands, who he tried to handle like Tiberius had the Sicambri. Augustus recalled Ahenobarbus to Rome in 2 BC and replaced him with a more seasoned military commander, Marcus Vinicius. Between 2 BC and AD 4, Vinicius commanded the 5 legions stationed in Germany. At around the time of his appointment, many of the Germanic tribes arose in what the historian Velleius Paterculus calls the \\"vast war\\". However, no account of this war exists. Vinicius must have performed well, for he was awarded the ornamenta triumphalia on his return to Rome.Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History, II.104 Again in AD 4, Augustus sent Tiberius to the Rhine frontier as the commander in Germany. He campaigned in northern Germany for the next two years. During the first year, he conquered the Canninefati, the Attuarii, the Bructeri, and subdued the Cherusci. Soon thereafter, he declared the Cherusci \\"friends of the Roman people.\\" In AD 5, he campaigned against the Chauci, and then coordinated an attack into the heart of Germany both overland and by river. The Roman fleet and legions met on the Elbe, whereupon Tiberius departed from the Elbe to march back westward at the end of the summer without stationing occupying forces at this eastern position. This accomplished a demonstration to his troops, to Rome, and to the German peoples that his army could move largely unopposed through Germany, but like Drusus he did nothing to hold territory. Tiberius' forces were attacked by German troops on the way west back to the Rhine, but successfully defended itself. The elite of the Cherusci tribe came to be special friends of Rome after Tiberius's campaigns of AD 5. In the preceding years, a power struggle had resulted in the alliance of one party with Rome. In this tribe was a ruling lineage that played a critical role in forging this friendship between the Cherusci and Rome. Belonging to this elite clan, was the young Arminius, who was around twenty-two at the time. Membership in this clan gave him special favor with Rome. Tiberius lent support to this ruling clan to gain control over the Cherusci, and he granted the tribe a free status among the German peoples. To keep an eye on the Cherusci, Tiberius had a winter base built on the Lippe. It was Roman opinion that by AD 6 the German tribes had largely been pacified, if not conquered. Only the Marcomanni, under king Maroboduus, remained to be subdued. Rome planned a massive pincer attack against them involving 12 legions from Germania, Illyricum, and Rhaetia, but when word of an uprising in Illyricum arrived he called the attack off and concluded peace with Maroboduus, recognizing him as king.Velleius Paterculus, Compendium of Roman History 2, 109, 5; Cassius Dio, Roman History 55, 28, 6–7 Part of the Roman strategy was to resettle troublesome tribal peoples, to move them to locations where Rome could keep better tabs on them and away from their regular allies. Tiberius resettled the Sicambri, who had caused particular problems for Drusus, in a new site west of the Rhine, where they could be watched more closely. Campaign of Varus Statue of Arminius at Teutoburg Forest, in North Rhine- Westphalia =Prelude= Following Tiberius's departure to Illyricum, Augustus appointed Publius Quinctilius Varus to the German command. It was assumed that the province of Germania Magna had been pacified, and so Varus had begun integrating the region into the empire. There was a risk of rebellion during the military subjugation of a province, so Augustus had to appoint an experienced officer like Varus for the job. As the main military operations were thought to be over, a brilliant military leader was not considered necessary. Varus imposed civic changes on the Germans, including a tax – what Augustus expected any governor of a subdued province to do. However, the Germanic tribes began rallying around a new leader, Arminius of the Cherusci. Arminius was considered an ally of Rome, and had fought in the Roman army before. He accompanied Varus, who was in Germania with the Legions XVII, XVIII, and XIX to finish the conquest of Germania. Not much is known of the campaign of AD 9 until the return trip, when Varus left with his legions from their camp on the Weser. On their way back to Xanten, Varus received reports from Arminius that there was a small uprising west of the Roman camp. The Romans were on the way back to the Rhine anyway, and the small revolt was only a small detour – about two days away. Varus departed to deal with the revolt believing that Arminius would ride ahead to garner the support of his tribesmen for the Roman cause. In reality, Arminius was actually preparing an ambush. Varus took no extra precautions on the march to quell the uprising, as he was expecting no trouble. =Victory of Arminius= Arminius' revolt came during the Pannonian revolt, at a time when the majority of Rome's legions were tied down in Illyricum. Varus only had three legions, which were isolated in the heart of Germany. Scouts were sent ahead of Roman forces as the column approached Kalkriese. Scouts were local Germans as they would have had knowledge of the terrain, and so would had to have been a part of Arminius' ploy. Indeed, they reported that the path ahead was safe. Wells and Abdale say that the scouts likely alerted the Germans to the advancing column, giving them time to get into position. The Roman column followed the road going north until it began to wrap around a hill. The hill was to the west of the road and was wooded. There was boggy terrain all around the hill, woodland to the east, and a swamp to the north (out of sight of the Roman column until they reached the bend taking the road southwest around the hill's northeastern point). Roman forces continued along the sloshy sandbank at the base of the hill until the front of the column was attacked. They heard loud shouting and spears began falling on them from the woody slope to their left. Spears then began falling from the woods to their right and the front fell into disorder from panic. The surrounded soldiers were unable to defend themselves because they were marching in close formation and the terrain was too muddy for them to move effectively. Within ten minutes, word reached the middle of the column where Varus was. Communication was hampered by the column being packed densely in the narrow road. Not knowing the full extent of the attack, Varus ordered his forces to advance forward to reinforce his forces at the front. This pushed the soldiers at the front further into the enemy, and thousands of German warriors began to pour out of the woods to attack up close. The soldiers at the middle and rear of the column began to flee in all directions, but most of them were caught in the bog or killed. Varus must have realized the severity of his situation and killed himself with his sword. A few Romans survived and made their way back to the winter quarters at Xanten by staying hidden and carefully travelling through the forests. Campaigns after the Clades Variana=Campaigns of Tiberius= Campaigns of Tiberius and Germanicus in the years AD 10–12. In pink the anti-Roman Germanic coalition led by Arminius. In dark green, territories still directly held by the Romans, in yellow the Roman client states It had become clear that German lands had not been pacified. After word reached Rome of Varus' defeat, Augustus had Tiberius sent back to the Rhine to stabilize the frontier in AD 10. Tiberius increased the defensive capabilities of the Rhine fortifications and redistributed forces across the region. He began to improve discipline and led small attacks across the Rhine. Velleius reports Tiberius as having enormous success. He says Tiberius: According to Seager and Wells, Velleius' account is almost certainly an exaggeration. Seager says that Tiberius successfully applied tactics that he had developed in Illyricum, but that his attacks were \\"no more than punitive raids\\". Tiberius did not get far in his conquest of Germany, because he was moving slow as to not risk wasting lives. His advance was cautious and deliberate: he ravaged crops, burned dwellings, and dispersed the population. Suetonius reports that Tiberius' orders were given in writing and that he was to be consulted directly on any doubtful points.Suetonius, Tiberius 18.2 Tiberius was joined by his adoptive son Germanicus for the campaigns of AD 11 and 12. The two generals crossed the Rhine and made various excursions into enemy territory, moving with the same caution as Tiberius had the year before. The campaigns were conducted against the Bructeri and the Marsi to avenge the defeat of Varus, but had no significant effect. However, the campaigns did, combined with Rome's alliance to the Marcommanic federation of Marbod, effectively prevent the anti-Roman Germanic coalition led by Arminius from crossing the Rhine to invade Gaul and Italy. In the winter of AD 12, Tiberius and Germanicus returned to Rome.Cassius Dio, LVI, 25 =Campaigns of Germanicus= Augustus appointed Germanicus commander of the forces in the Rhine the following year. In August AD 14, Augustus died and on 17 September the senate met to confirm Tiberius as princeps. Roman writers, including Tacitus and Cassius Dio, mention that Augustus left a statement ordering the end of imperial expansion. It's not known if Augustus actually made such an order, or that Tiberius found it necessary to stop Roman expansion as the costs were too great, both financially and militarily. About one-third of Rome's total military forces, eight legions, were stationed in the Rhine following their redeployment by Tiberius. Four were in lower Germany under Aulus Caecina (the 5th and 21st at Xanten; the 1st and 20th at or near Cologne). Another four were in upper Germany under Gaius Silius (the 2nd, 13th, 16th, and 14th). Between AD 14 and 16, Germanicus led Roman armies across the Rhine into Germany against the forces of Arminius and his allies. Tacitus says the purpose of the campaigns were to avenge the defeat of Varus, not to expand Rome's borders. Indeed, the battles and minor skirmishes did little to change the situation that had resulted in Arminius' victory over Varus.

They have been depicted many times as a pair, and the duo has become an identifiable motif in Zen painting and representative of deeper meanings in Zen Buddhism as a whole. Hanshan, whose name means \\"Cold Mountain,\\" is believed to be an eccentric Zen poet from the Tang Dynasty (618–907) who lived on the Tiantang Mountain in Zhejiang Province. Shide, whose name means \\"foundling\\" or \\"pickup,\\" was a kitchen worker at the nearby Guoqing Temple. He is said to have been abandoned by his family, and then found and raised by Fenggan, another Zen eccentric. As legend goes, the two formed a close friendship, with Shide stealing scraps from the kitchen to bring to Hanshan, and the pair spending time in nature, away from societal structure and institutions. Little is verified about the lives of these two figures, and they \\"have come to exist only in the works they have left behind.Robert Borgen \\"The Legend of Hanshan: A Neglected Source.\\" www.jstor.org/stable/604274\\" Hanshan and Shide are easily recognizable in Zen painting. They are almost always depicted wearing scrappy and ratty clothing, appearing disheveled, wandering in nature, laughing, or with mischievous looks on their faces. Hanshan is identified by the scroll he holds in his hand, alluding to his work as a poet. Shide is identified by the broom he holds, which references his work as a kitchen cleaner at the monastery.  Significance and Symbolism  The figures Hanshan and Shide, while often depicted simply and with humor, carry deep symbolism for the religion of Zen Buddhism as a whole. As seen in the attached images, Hanshan's scroll is often depicted blank. This indicates \\"that written or printed sutras are nothing compared to the book of nature.\\" Shide's broom can be read as a tool to \\"sweep out of the cobwebs in our impure souls.\\" Their carefree attitude symbolizes their knowledge that \\"the things which most men strive for are illusions, and that what really counts is not rank or riches but their own Buddha nature.Hugo Munsterberg, \\"Zen and Art.\\" www.jstor.org/stable/774379\\" Additionally, \\"in these lunatic figures the Zen artists portray something slightly more than a parody of their own wu-shin or mindless way of life, for as genius is to madness close allied there is a suggestive parallel between the meaningless babble of the happy lunatic and the purposeless life of the Zen sage.Alan Watts. \\"The Way of Zen.\\" The Way of Zen.

These bodhisattvas represent wisdom and Buddhist practice respectively, perhaps creating a parallel between the wisdom and practice of Hanshan and Shide. Mañjuśrī is often connected to poetry, oratory, and writing, in the same way that Hanshan is connected to his own poems. This comparison suggests the hidden significance of these otherwise eccentric and simple characters.Tim Lerch, \\"Manjushri and Samantabhadra,\\" https://kwanumzen.org/teaching-library/2003/09/01/manjushri-and-samantabhadra  Visual Representations = Four Sleepers = Early representations of Hanshan and Shide in Zen painting can be found in images depicting the \\"Four Sleepers.\\" The exact creation of this theme is unclear, though it is believed to have been established as a part of Zen painting in China by the early thirteenth century. \\"The earliest reference known to us concerning the artistic treatment of the subject is a poem in the Rujing Heshang yulu composed by the Chinese abbot Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) for a now lost painting of the 'Four Sleepers.Helmut Brinker \\"ZEN Masters of Meditation in Images and Writings,\\" www.jstor.org/stable/1522704'\\" One example of early renderings of the \\"Four Sleepers\\" is by the Japanese artist Mokuan. In Mokuan's \\"Four Sleepers,\\" Hanshan and Shide are seen sleeping soundly on the ground with Fenggan (the Zen master who found and raised Shide) and Fenggan's tiger. The inscription on this hanging scroll reads: > Old Old Feng-kan embraces his tiger and sleeps, All huddled together with > Shih-te and Han-shan They dream their big dream, which lingers on, While a > frail old tree clings to the bottom of the cold precipice. Shao-mu of the > Hsiang-fu [temple] salutes with folded hands.Gregory Levine and Yukio > Lippit, Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan, (Japan Society: > 2007), p. 106. The imagery of the Four Sleepers was made popular in Japan through paintings imported from China. Japanese interpretations of the theme emerged as early as the fourteenth century.\\"Tawaraya Sōtatsu  The Four Sleepers  Japan  Edo Period (1615–1868)  The Met,\\" metmuseum.org/exhibitions/view?exhibitionId=%7B5bc821dc-2782-4897-854f-ebbdc0f09577%7D&oid;=77247.'\\" Images of the Four Sleepers are meant to symbolize \\"peaceful coexistence with nature and the enlightened mind,\\" as the three men sleep soundly among a tiger and outdoors, in nature. Additionally, the sleeping figures hint at a \\"dream world that cannot be represented on paper\\" or a \\"peacefulness of Enlightenment that cannot be attained in the waking world.\\"World Art.\\" Annenberg Learner, www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/61/index.html\\" Key themes of Zen Buddhism are given shape in images of the Four Sleepers, such as the non- duality of man and animal sleeping peacefully, the serenity of enlightenment, and expunging of opposite figures and forces. = Representations as a pair = Hanshan and Shide are most commonly depicted with just one another. In Zen painting, the two eccentrics are typically shown laughing uproariously, frequently at a Zen joke and at the expense of the \\"pompous monks\\" at their monastery.\\"Kanzan & Jittoku by Chuzan.\\" Robyn Buntin of Honolulu Gallery, www.robynbuntin.com/Kanzan-Jittoku-p/4524.htm. Hanshan and Shide wear shabby clothing and are easily identifiable by their scroll and broom, respectively.

During this period, painters followed traditional standards for figure painting, with a combination of thin and delicate lines to render their faces and thicker lines on their bodies. These images were almost always accompanied by an inscription, though not all have been translated or attributed to an author. This style of painting is also exemplified through Kao Ninga's Zen Eccentrics Hanshan and Shide, a pair of paintings depicting the figures. = 15th Century = Fenggan, Hanshan, and Shide by Resai, Muromachi Period, 1st half of the 15th century, ink and color on paper, Metropolitan Museum of ArtHanshan and Shide by Ike Taiga, late 18th century, ink on paper, Metropolitan Museum of ArtThe subject of Hanshan and Shide remained popular in Zen painting in the 15th century. During the Muromachi Period (1392-1573) in Japan, artists like Resai experimented with color and tonality more so than in previous centuries. Resai's depiction of Hanshan and Shide is complex and contemplative, as the pair is seen on the pair on a mountain's edge with a vast space of nothingness beyond where they stand. They are shown in discussion and pointing out to the nothingness, perhaps exploring different facets of enlightenment as they often did. There are varying tones of ink, and areas are shaded and filled in. Resai stays true to common themes with Hanshan and Shide, showing their scroll, broom, joyous faces, and depicting them in nature. Also painting during the Muromachi period was Sesshū Tōyō, who is described as the most prominent master of ink painting from this time. Sesshu Toyo's painting of Kanzan and Jittoku differs from others seen, as it is a bust length image of the two figures' faces. Sesshu Toyo pays great attention to rendering their emotions and mischievous glances, as they laugh together while Kanzan holds a blank scroll. Through this, he captures the essence of the two figures. Sesshu Toyo employs variation in ink tonalities and in the thickness of his lines. There is three dimensional modeling to the faces and hands of the figures, demonstrating a more elevated and advanced style of painting.  Modern Representations  Representations of Hanshan and Shide remained very popular in Japan in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, and well into the 19th century. In the late 18th century, during the Edo Period (1615–1868), Ito Jakuchu painted Hanshan and Shide (Kanzan and Jittoku). His rendition is more abstract than any of the aforementioned paintings. The figures are depicted embracing and in opposites – one in a black robe and one in a white robe, with a scroll at their feet and a broom rising up. There is no background, placing the focus on the figures themselves. The inscription is attributed to Ike Taiga (Japanese, 1723–1776) and reads: > One is the Bodhisattva of the Great Path, The other is the Patriarch of the > Great Buddha. What evidence is there? A broken broom, a tattered scripture, > and unrhymed verse. Hanshan and Shide by Mochizuki Gyokusen, 19th century, Museum of Fine Arts Boston The inscription references their emanations of Mañjuśrī (Monju) and Samantabadhra (Fugen). In the 19th century, Japanese Zen painter Mochizuki Gyokuzen created a hanging scroll depicting the pair. Here, we see a shift in style from previous centuries. This painting is done in a more graphic manner, and Mochizuki Gyokuzen employs different colors and sharper lines to create a more cartoon-looking image of the pair. The figures are emotive and looking upwards at something outside of the picture frame, rather than at a scroll. Still, we see the common motifs of the ragged clothing, the broom, and the blank scroll in Kanzan's hand. Also in the 19th century, during the Meiji Period (1868–1912), was Hashimoto Gahō. His hanging scroll depicting the pair is done in ink and slight tint on paper, harkening back to the simple ink and wash paintings of previous centuries, though done in a far more modern manner. Hashimoto Gaho employs variations in ink tonalities and texture, as seen through the fuzzy hair, the different tones of the ground they stand on, and the fur on Kanzan's skirt. Jittoku is seen laughing and pointing to the blank scroll, while Kanzan looks on in amusement. The faces of the two figures are three dimensionally modeled, making them appear more realistic and modern than past renderings. The tree branches point downward to the characters to direct the attention of viewers. Nearly every common motif associated with the figures are employed in this painting, though it is done in a modern and expressive manner.  References  Further reading  * Aviman, Galit.

Al-Salem worked as the director for the Business Advisory Services (currently Advice for Small Business) Programme of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Central Asia for ten years. He contributed to the development of the consulting industry in the Central Asian region and was the first to provide formal training on business ethics to the consultants of Central Asia.  Early life and education  Al-Salem was born in Oakland, California to Bader Al-Salem (1939—2012), a Kuwaiti architect, and Margarete Dorsch (born 1939), a German national and a professor of French and German. Al-Salem grew up with his mother in the United States. He attended elementary school in Columbia, Missouri, and in 1978, Al-Salem and his mother moved to Lindsborg, Kansas, where he lived until 1984. Al-Salem spent most of his senior year of high school in Versailles, France and part of it in Berlin, Germany. Upon his return from the year abroad he started his undergraduate studies at the University of Kansas (KU), majoring in Russian language and political science. Al-Salem spent the first semester of his junior year at KU in Bonn, Germany, where he completed an internship in the office of Egon Bahr, a German SPD politician and the specialist for East-West relations in the German government, and the second semester at the Leningrad State University (today Saint Petersburg State University). After graduating from KU, Al-Salem spent half a year touring with a children's theater company across the United States. Subsequently, he attended a semester-long seminar on the European Union in Tilburg, the Netherlands. Al-Salem pursued an MA in Russian area studies at Georgetown University, where he also worked as a research assistant for his professor Angela Stent. He graduated in 1993, and his thesis focused on the implications of German reunification on Europe’s relations with Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union.  Career  Gabriel Al-Salem in his office in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Al-Salem worked on multiple international development projects around the world in the areas of privatization and economic reform. From 1994 to 1997, he worked as a project director for Ernst & Young LLP in Kazakhstan, where he led ongoing consultations to the government of Kazakhstan on privatization strategy, policy and implementation and provided assistance to the government in offering shares of key industrial enterprises to international investors through the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange. From 1998 to 1999, Al-Salem worked as an associate for A.T. Kearney Management Consulting in Moscow, Russia and Berlin, Germany, where he led consulting engagements in Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and the United States in market analysis, global benchmarking, and acquisition target identification. Moreover, he served as a trainer in the firm's Consulting Skills Training program. From 1999 to 2001, Al-Salem worked as a manager for KPMG Consulting in Washington, D.C., where he served as the project manager and senior advisor on engagements in Vietnam, Montenegro (former Yugoslavia) and Mongolia. Finally, from 2001 until his death, he worked as the Regional Director for Central Asia in the Business Advisory Services Programme of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. Here, he launched and directed a commercially-oriented consulting services provision program that assisted more than 1,000 enterprises in hiring local consultants in Central Asia to solve business problems. In 2011, the International Council of Management Consulting Institutes deemed Al-Salem’s work in Central Asia “commendable and of pioneering nature” and awarded him the honorable title Member of the Meridian Order.  Personal life  Gabriel Al-Salem with his paraglider. = Marriage and family = While studying at the Leningrad State University, Al-Salem met his wife, Viktoria Olskaia. They got married on May 23, 1992 and traveled the world working on various economic development projects. On January 16, 2000, their daughter, Anya Al-Salem, was born in Washington, D.C. = Activities = Al-Salem was an active mountaineer, skier, paragliding pilot, actor and musician. In 2002, he climbed the 7,010 meter mountain Khan Tengri. Moreover, he had over 150 hours of paragliding experience and competed in a number of paragliding competitions from 2005 to 2010. He was the first paragliding pilot to fly down from Talgar, a northern peak in the Tian Shan mountain range, after a multi-day ascent. In 2008, his writing on his experience paragliding over the Great Wall of China was published on the Wing China website and in the Cross Country magazine. = Death = On November 27, 2010, Al-Salem died in a paragliding accident on the northern slope of the Ushkonyr mountain in Almaty, Kazakhstan. He is buried in the Coronado Heights Cemetery near his hometown of Lindsborg, Kansas.  Legacy  After Al-Salem's death in 2010, his colleagues created the annual Gabriel Al-Salem Award for Excellence in Consulting in honor of his work. Al- Salem's wife, Viktoria Olskaia, supported this initiative by establishing the Gabriel Al-Salem Foundation. Al-Salem was recognized as one of the pioneers in the development of the internet sector in Kazakhstan due to his role in creating one of the first successful Kazakh business websites in 1997 as part of the USAID-funded \\"Capital Markets Development and Privatization in Kazakhstan\\" project.

Picasso painted three versions of the work on 26 December 1948; one is in the collection of the Welsh National Museum of Art, Cardiff, Wales. The painting is an oil painting on canvas and measures 50.3 × 61 cm. Picasso created few oil paintings during 1948, instead concentrating on his ceramics at the Madoura Pottery in Vallauris on the French Cote d'Azur. His preferred subjects during this period were Françoise Gilot, his partner, and their son, Claude. The painting was bought by the National Museum Wales for £1.435 million in 2009 to celebrate the museum's centenary; £100,000 of which came from the Art Fund, with the remainder from the Derek Williams Trust. It had initially been sold by the Parisian gallery Galerie Louise Leiris in 1949. This was the first oil painting by Picasso to enter a Welsh public collection. Subject A porrón is a traditional Spanish drinking vessel, with a lemon and a lobster also depicted in the painting.

She was unraced as a two-year-old and finished fifth in the 1000 Guineas on her debut before recording her first and only win in the Epsom Oaks. She failed to win in four subsequent races and was retired from racing at the end of the year. She had considerable success as a dam of winners. Background Rose of England was a brown mare with a white blaze and a white sock on her right hind leg bred in the United Kingdom by Lady James Douglas. As a yearling in 1928 the filly was put up for auction and bought for 3,100 guineas by Lord Glanely. She was sent into training with Lord Glanely's private trainer Thomas Hogg at Newmarket, Suffolk. She was sired by the French stallion Teddy who stood with great success in both France and the United States. His other offspring included Sir Gallahad, Bull Dog and La Troienne. Rose of England's dam Perce-Neige produced several over winners including the winner Winterhalter (Coronation Cup) and Star of England (Yorkshire Oaks). Racing career=1930: three-year-old season= On 9 May 1930 Rose of England made her racecourse debut in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse and ran well to finish fifth behind Lord Derby's filly Fair Isle who won from Torchere and Sister Clover. On 6 of June the filly was stepped up in distance for the Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse in which she was partnered by Gordon Richards and started at odds of 7/1 in a fifteen-runner field. Fair Isle was made the 5/4 favourite. Rose of England won the race by three lengths from Wedding Favour with Micmac taking third place ahead of Fair Isle. Rose of England failed to win in four subsequent races. She finished unplaced behind The Pen in the Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket in October.

The different shades of gray represent league divisions. The Swedish football club AIK was founded in 1891 and won the Swedish Football Championship in 1900 and 1901. In the following years the team competed instead in a Stockholm-only competition, and then in the Svenska Serien. In 1924 AIK joined the Allsvenskan league, and won it in 1932 and 1937. In 1937 also the club relocated to the Råsunda Stadium. From then until 1992, AIK failed to win the title, and were temporarily relegated to the second division several times. The team were champions in 1992, and again in a reformed league system in 1993. They won the Swedish Cup in 1996, and reached the third round of the European Cup Winners' Cup the following season. In 1999 the club was incorporated and bought many new players. This helped them to reach the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, where they lost to Barcelona. After this a period of decline set in and AIK were relegated in 2004. However, they returned to the top league the next year, and won both the League and Cup in 2009. After 2011 AIK were doing well without winning titles, until they won the Championship in 2018. 1891–1945: Beginnings and golden period Swedish Championship. Founded in 1891 by Isidor Behrens in Stockholm, at the downtown address of Biblioteksgatan 8, the club's full name, \\"Allmänna Idrottsklubben\\", translates to \\"The General Sports Club\\" or \\"The Public Sports Club\\". The name was chosen to reflect that the club was open for everyone, and also that athletics, at the time called \\"allmän idrott\\" in Swedish,AIK – aik.se was considered the club's main sport. AIK were runners-up in the championship in 1898 and won its first Swedish championship title in 1900, beating Örgryte IS in the final. In 1901, AIK won another title, after a walk- over win against Örgryte IS team II. At the turn of the century, Swedish league football was dominated by Örgryte, who won ten times between the years 1896 and 1909. However, in the period of 1898–1901 AIK won the championship twice and were runners-up three times. In 1899 the team faced Djurgårdens IF for the first time. Djurgården was founded in 1891, the same year as AIK, and therefore the games between these teames are commonly known as the tvillingderbyt (the twin derby), Djurgården is to this day AIK's main rival. AIK did not participate in the Swedish championships of 1902 and 1903. In 1902, AIK instead competed in \\"Svenska bollspelsförbundets tävlingsserie\\", a league competition open only to clubs from Stockholm. AIK competed with two teams in the first year of the competition. The competition was played until 1909, with AIK winning it in 1908 and 1909, and was replaced by Svenska Serien. Two years after the start of the \\"tävlingsserie\\", 1904, twelve teams participated in the championship, one of them being AIK for the first time since winning it. AIK went through to the semi-finals, where they were beaten by archrivals Djurgårdens IF. In 1905, AIK went just as far, this time being beaten by IFK Stockholm. AIK competed in the championship three times in 1906–1910 without any success, but in 1911 they won the championship for the third time after beating IFK Uppsala in the final. After that, AIK were eliminated in the semi-finals of 1912 and 1913 but won the championship once again in 1914. In 1915, AIK were again defeated by archrivals Djurgården in the semi-finals. In 1916, however, AIK came back and defeated future rivals IFK Göteborg in the semi-finals, beating Djurgårdens IF with 3–1 in the final. In 1917, Djurgården mirrored AIK's achievement, winning against Göteborg in the semi-finals and then beating AIK with 3–1 in the final. Another couple of years passed by without any success for AIK, until 1923, when they won their sixth title after beating IFK Eskilstuna in the final. From the years 1910 to 1924, a championship called \\"Svenska Serien\\" was played. AIK didn't win it, but were runners-up a couple of times. The status of this championship status increased in the beginning of the 1920s and it became more important than the Swedish championship. In 1924, Svenska Serien was replaced by the current highest league, \\"Allsvenskan\\", (officially named \\"Division I\\"). The first years, the championship were dominated by teams from Gothenburg (GAIS, IFK Göteborg och Örgryte IS) and by Hälsingborgs IF. After some years when AIK finished fourth and fifth and in the middle of the table, AIK won the championship in 1931/32, making it their first Allsvenskan title and their seventh Swedish title. Milan in 1950 The football of AIK relocated in 1937 from Stockholms Stadion to Råsunda Fotbollsstadion in what became Solna in 1942. This was however only one of the things making the year 1937 a memorable year – AIK won their eighth Swedish title. Olle Zetterlund scored 23 goals during the season, and is to this day the player who have scored the most goals during one season for AIK. 1945–1991: Mixed fortunes After World War II AIK finished second 1946 and third 1947. In June 1951 AIK were relegated to Division II. The last game were against Malmö FF, who had gone undefeated for 49 games. AIK beat Malmö, 1–0, but would have needed an extra goal to ensure a spot in Allsvenskan. After having won Division II AIK returned to Allsvenskan the following season. In the middle of the 1950s, a new star player came to play for AIK, Kurt \\"Kurre\\" Hamrin. However, after he left for Italy, the club experienced hard times. In 1962 AIK were again relegated to Division II, but won it and returned to Allsvenskan the following season. In the early 1970s the club were the one considered most likely to win the league; however, the closest AIK came to this was a second place in 1972. In 1975 40,669 came to see the derby with Djurgårdens IF, a record that lives on to this day. AIK won the Swedish Cup in 1976. In 1979 AIK were relegated to Division II again, but quickly returned to Allsvenskan. This however meant that Malmö FF advanced to the first place of the All-time Allsvenskan table, a position previously held by AIK. The Japan Soccer League chose AIK as the opponent for their all-star team in their first ever all-star game since their foundation as a league. On 2 December 1965, AIK battled a JSL all-star team to a 2–2 draw. 1992–1995: League champions and European challenges In 1992 AIK were Swedish champions, for the first time in 55 years. The next year, 1993, a regular league system was reinstated. AIK had the same managers as last year, Tommy Söderberg and Thomas Lyth, and much the same squad. The team opened the season brilliantly. After drawing away to IFK Göteborg in the opening game after a late equalizer, AIK won six straight games, most remarkably by 9–3 at home to Brage, with Kim Bergstrand scoring five. But during the summer, AIK lost ground to IFK Göteborg and IFK Norrköping, who ended up contending for the title. AIK managed, however, to finish third, securing a spot for next year's UEFA Cup. But first they had to compete in that year's Champions League, which had been created the year before. AIK didn't manage to get past the first round though, losing on aggregate to Sparta Prague. Even though – or maybe due to the fact that – AIK was the only Stockholm side in the top flight that year, the team had their largest average attendance since the mid-1980s. During the summer, AIK had three home matches in a row with gates exceeding 10,000, something not seen at non-derby games since 1965. In 1994, AIK aimed to regain the league title with a new manager, Hasse Backe, and a big signing, Jesper Jansson. Again, AIK started the season marvellously, only losing once in the first thirteen games. But after three straight losses the team parked mid-table and eventually ended sixth, fifteen points behind winners IFK Göteborg. After that, the fun was over for that year. AIK lost the cup final, and consequently the opportunity to play in Europe the next season. Also, they didn't manage to win a league game in nine rounds, which led to the team being close to having to qualify to stay in the league. This year saw the debut of AIK's youngest player and scorer of the 20th century, Alexander Östlund, at 16 years, 10 months and 2 days old. Östlund would play a crucial role for the club four years later. In 1995, the season started well once again. After seven games, AIK were at the top of the league, in the Swedish Cup final, and had three players (Dick Lidman, Ola Andersson, Jan Eriksson) capped for the national team. The club ended the season in a disappointing eighth place. 1996–1999: End-of-the-century glory In 1996, Erik Hamrén took the reins as sole manager, after co-managing the team alongside Hasse Backe the year before. The year started like the previous year ended, with AIK playing well but being rewarded by few or no points. After seven rounds with five losses, AIK were second last in the league. But then things changed. After a year of being unfortunate, most things went AIK's way during the summer and autumn, including a 6–0 win against IFK Göteborg. After only losing one came during the autumn, AIK finished fourth. The team also won the cup, which meant qualifying for the Cup Winners' Cup. AIK reached the third round where their paths crossed with FC Barcelona, just before the start of the 1997 Allsvenskan season. For the first time ever, Råsunda was sold out in advance, one month prior to the game. The first leg, at Camp Nou, started in the best possible way for AIK with new signing Nebojsa Novakovic forcing the opposing team's full back to make a weak home pass which Pascal Simpson converted into a goal. The opponents equalized in the very next attack. The match ended 3–1 to Barcelona. In the return game at Råsunda, Ronaldo scored an early goal for Barcelona, but even though AIK managed to score an equalizer, Barcelona won on aggregate. AIK were now considered the main contender to IFK Göteborg for the league title that year but finished a disappointing eighth. Yet again, however, AIK won the cup and qualified for the Cup Winners' Cup, but AIK went out in the first round against Slovenian side Primorje. Among the new faces in 1998 were English manager Stuart Baxter, goalkeeper Mattias Asper and defender Olof Mellberg. Six of the ten first games ended in 1–1 draws. After eight games, new goalkeeper Mattias Asper entered the pitch. With him between the posts AIK didn't lose another game that whole season, moving the team from the bottom of the table to title contenders. In the last game, leaders Helsingborg only had to win against already relegation-bound Häcken, but lost. Alexander Östlund scored when AIK won 1–0 against Örgryte helping AIK secure their tenth league title. AIK's average points per match that year was less than one, and AIK scored the fewest goals of all the teams in Allsvenskan that year. Asper, AIK's back four and defensive central midfielder Johan Mjällby were much lauded. Mjällby was snapped up by Celtic and Mellberg was sold to Racing Santander. 1999 was to be AIK's most eventful year of the twentieth century. The club was incorporated, and a slew of players were purchased, among them Andreas Andersson who was bought from Newcastle for circa 2 million euros, a record amount for Sweden at the time. During the season Mattias Asper kept a clean sheet for a record 19 hours and 17 minutes. AIK were destined for winning the league a second time running, but Helsingborg managed to slip by and win the title, albeit on a controversial goal that some people thought should have been disallowed for offside. AIK won all three games against Helsingborg that season (two in the league and one in the cup). The second place in the league was overshadowed by the glory of reaching the Champions League group stage, the first – and only time since – that a Stockholm side had gone this far in the tournament. The last obstacle was Greek side AEK. After a draw in Athens, AIK beat AEK 1–0 at Råsunda, with Novakovic scoring his most important goal to that point; but more important goals were to come from the Serbian striker in the following group matches. AIK got the worst possible draw. Every side in AIK's group had the potential of going all the way: Arsenal, Barcelona and Fiorentina. In the first game, AIK took the lead against Barcelona after an astonishing goal by Novakovic. But a while later, the referee allowed a Barcelona corner kick to be taken during a dual substitution for AIK, which resulted in a goal for Barcelona. The controversial decision led AIK's manager Stuart Baxter to utter the following words in desperation to the fourth referee: \\"This isn't the amateur league, this is the fucking Champions League. Please take responsibility.\\" Barcelona scored 2–1 in added time and won the game. The name of the principal referee, Alain Sars, is forever emblazoned in the memory of all AIK fans present or watching the game on TV. Another promising show was when AIK played Arsenal away, the first time a Swedish club side had ever played at Wembley. The match stood 1–1 in added time, when Arsenal scored two goals, winning 3–1. AIK then managed 0–0 at home against Fiorentina, but lost the last three games in the tournament. Although AIK in total only won one point in the tournament, the team could hold their heads high after all giving three opposing teams in the group a run for their money in the first half of the group stage. 2000–2004: Decline and relegation AIK were the bookmakers' favorites to win the first season of the new millennium, after having continued to recruit name players, like Teddy Lucic, Andreas Alm (who was later to manage the team), Sharbel Touma and Erik Edman – although Andreas Andersson and Pontus Kåmark tore their knee ligaments during pre-season. AIK played well initially, and were in the title race the first 20 matches, but finished poorly and ended third. In that year's Cup the club reached the final for the fifth time in six years but suffered a close defeat to Öis. The next year, 2001, was dominated by the three major Stockholm sides, with AIK finishing third after their two biggest cross-town rivals: first-time winners Hammarby and runners-up Djurgården (who saw the start of half a decade of league dominance). AIK didn't do too well the first half of the season, but with Andreas Alm returning from an injury, the club ended the season excellently, enjoying a 12-game unbeaten streak and ending with four wins in a row. Once again, AIK reached the final of the Cup, this time against Elfsborg. The tournament was decided by a penalty shootout. After a whopping 24 penalties AIK were defeated. The 2002 season was marred by several managerial changes. Olle Nordin, who had taken over from Stuart Baxter, was sick-listed early in the season and never returned. He was first replaced by the assistant manager, Peter Larsson, who in turn, shortly thereafter, was replaced by a Slovak, Dušan Uhrin. AIK finished fifth that year and yet again reached the final of the Cup, this time losing to arch- rivals Djurgården. As consolation the club won the attendance table for the fifth time in a row. Richard Money, an Englishman whose only prior managerial experience was running a fourth-tier English side, Scunthorpe, ten years previously, replaced Uhrin for the 2003 season. Having had the same position at AIK's feeder club Väsby, former AIK Champion's League star Nebojsa Novakovic was brought in to serve as assistant manager, a role he would keep for four years, before returning for a second spell as assistant manager in 2011. The feisty Brit and the cunning Serb got an excellent start with six wins and a draw in the first eight games. After a legendary Derby-of-the-twins performance where AIK were 3–0 down but managed to score three goals and get a draw, the club only won one of the following twelve games. AIK finished fifth again, 19 points behind that year's champions Djurgården, who also knocked out AIK in the quarterfinal of the Cup. This meant no European games for the club for the first time since 1998. The following year, 2004, was an annus horribilis for AIK. At the start of the season, after just three games, Money resigned and was replaced by Patrick Englund. Englund had been a key AIK player in the glory years of the 1990s, but had zero experience as a manager. He had to endure lots of injuries and a consistently under-performing team. As a result, AIK were relegated from the first tier of Swedish football for the fourth time in the club's history. Their fate was sealed after losing 3–0 at home to Öis, surrounded by empty stands due to the pitch being invaded by disappointed fans in the previous game, a derby against Hammarby. 2005–2009: Rapid rise and double-title win under Rikard Norling As is common when a team is relegated, several well-known players left the club and were replaced by less costly players. In addition a new manager, Rikard Norling, was appointed. Norling had managed AIK's youth team in 1996, and was assistant manager during the glory years of the late 1990s, when Stuart Baxter was behind the reigns. The 2005 season got off to bumpy start with two defeats in the first three games, when Norling tried out a, at that the time, rather uncommon 3–5–2 formation. From the fourth game onward, after returning to a more common and well-proven 4–4–2 formation, AIK went on a 15-game unbeaten run. With three games to go, AIK secured promotion away at Västerås. Some 6 000 AIK fans had traveled the mere 100 kilometres from Stockholm to witness the game, which finished in a celebratory and non-violent pitch invasion. AIK finished the season in style, nine points ahead of runners-up Öster. Among AIK's fans, expectations were high for AIK's return to Allsvenskan in 2006, with pre-season games against no-name sides attractiong crowds of 3 000. More than 23 000 people showed up for the opening match, a 2–2 draw against Gefle, a game which saw the homecoming of a club icon of the 1990s, Johan Mjällby, after a spell of eight years abroad – although he only played that game for the club this time around, succumbing to injuries. A highlight of the season was the 3–1 derby win over Djurgården in front of a crowd of some 34 000 at Råsunda, and featuring a dazzling performance by talismanic Ghanaian midfielder Derek Boateng. This was AIK's first win over a Stockholm side since 2002, and was followed up by defeating Djurgården away with 1–0 later in the season. AIK were only defeated three times this year (two of them against local rivals Hammarby) and were in the running for the title with one game left. In their last game, however, leaders Elfsborg defeated Djurgården and secured the title, one point ahead of runners-up AIK. AIK brought in a couple of Argentine players for the 2007 season, including Iván Obolo, an elegant target man and secondary striker who during his three seasons at the club scored 24 goals in 74 appearances. The season looked promising after a six-win streak in the second half of the season, but then the club sold the internal golden-boot winner of 2006, Wílton Figueiredo, to the Qatari side Al-Rayyan. Sorely missing the Brazilian striker, AIK drew four times in a row, falling out of the title race with half a dozen games left. Finishing the season with defeats against the season's winners Göteborg and runners up Kalmar, AIK ended fifth. The next year, 2008, was another failed season: yet another fifth place, which meant no European games. This resulted in the sacking of Norling, who was popular among many fans in spite of the disappointing results. AIK won the attendance table, however, with an average home attendance of 15 535. More than 34 000 people witnessed the home derby against Djurgården, a 1–1 draw. Norling was replaced by another Stockholmer from within AIK's ranks, Mikael Stahre. Stahre had been joint assistant manager (alongside Novakovic) under Norling in 2006, and managed AIK's feeder club Väsby for two seasons during their promotion from the third tier in 2007 and return to the second tier in 2008. Under Stahre, AIK won the league in 2009 after a thrilling title- deciding game in the very last match of the season. AIK needed a draw to win the title and the club's long time captain and club legend Daniel Tjernström scored the winning 2–1 goal at Göteborg, the club's fiercest rivals outside Stockholm, who would have won the league had they won that game. What is more, AIK also defeated Göteborg in that year's Cup final and brought home a third piece of silverware when they won the Super Cup. 2010–2016: Backlash, comeback, and establishment as a title contender under Andreas Alm In 2010, AIK suffered a bad start to the season and didn't win until the seventh day (3–0 at Kalmar FF). In late April, manager Mikael Stahre left the club for the Greek side Panionios. He was briefly replaced by Bjorn Wesström, then by Scotsman Alex Miller who was replaced by former AIK player Andreas Alm. The 2011 season saw AIK finishing second. A key player from the 2010 season, Mohamed Bangura, was complemented by fellow Sierra Leonean Teteh Bangura. Though unrelated, the two connected immediately and posed a serious threat to any defense they encountered, Teteh for example firing a memorable four-goal salvo against Halmstads BK in a 4–2 win, and scoring 12 goals in 34 appearances. That autumn, both Banguras were sold – Mohamed to Celtic and Teteh to Bursaspor. All in all, the season was a success with Alm extracting the most from his somewhat limited resources. Nebojsa Novakovic returned as assistant manager this season, a position he held until June 2017. In 2012 AIK reached the UEFA Europa League group stage. On 6 August 2013, AIK faced Manchester United in a friendly at Friends Arena drawing 1–1. Under Alm, AIK established itself as a top club, finishing second, fourth, second, third and third again during the seasons 2011–2015. Not satisfied with this, the board of AIK Fotboll made public a goal for the 2016 season that could also be interpreted as a requirement for the club: to win that year's championship, a decision manager Alm stated he was not invited to participate in, much to his chagrin. On 13 May, eight games into the 2016 season, following a 3–2 away win at Häcken, Alm was sacked. AIK was in ninth place at the time. 2016–2020: The second Norling era On 13 May 2016, Rikard Norling was presented as AIK's new manager. He had previously managed the team for four seasons 2005–2008. With Norling in command, the club managed to play eight consecutive games without losing, including derby wins against both Djurgården and Hammarby, before losing 2–0 away at Malmö 7 August. A key player for the spring part of the 2016 season was Carlos Strandberg, a striker who joined the squad just two days before the first game of the Allsvenskan season on a short loan spell from CSKA Moscow. Strandberg scored seven goals in twelve appearances before returning to Russia during the summer break of the season. During that summer AIK recruited another striker who was to become crucial. Chinedu Obasi had considerable experience from prominent Bundesliga side Schalke 04, but was also injury-prone and not fully fit. Therefore, AIK only offered Obasi a contract for the rest of the 2016 season, a decision the club surely regretted later. Debuting in the aforementioned away game at Malmö, Obasi scored six goals in ten appearances, and was widely considered the league's most skillful striker. (A free agent after the 2016 season, he went on to sign a one-year contract with Sven-Göran Eriksson's Shenzhen in China's second tier.) Under Norling's reigns the team performed very well throughout the 2016 season, adapting quickly and successfully to Norlng's preferred, and in Sweden still somewhat uncommon, 3–5–2 formation (a setup Norling had unsuccessfully tried during the first few games of AIK's 2005 season, his first season as manager of AIK). After the loss at Malmö in July, AIK had a streak of nine games without losing, including seven wins. With three games left of the season AIK was placed second, but lost the title race after a 1–0 away defeat to IFK Göteborg on 24 October. Two days later Malmö secured the championship title for 2016 by winning 3–0 away at Falkenberg. Forming a striking partnership with first Strandberg then Obasi, AIK's top scorer for the 2016 season was Alexander Isak, who was only 16 years old until 21 September that year. Isak scored 10 goals 2016 in 24 appearances including 19 starts. Thanks to his young age and goal scoring abilities, Isak was on the want list for most of Europe's top clubs that year, and was extremely close to accepting an offer from Real Madrid. However, on 23 January 2017, Isak, now 17 years old, was sold to Borussia Dortmund for a fee that was reported to be somewhere between 8.6m and 10m euros, the highest transfer fee ever paid for a Swedish player. Leading up to the 2017 season, AIK signed Kristoffer Olsson, captain of Sweden's U21 national team in the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. After an unimpressive start as a defensive midfielder, Olsson slowly but surely improved and became a key player in one of the two offensive spots in the central midfield. The pre-season also saw the homecoming of striker Henok Goitom. During the summer break Nebojša Novaković stepped down as assistant manager, a position he had held since 2011, to work with AIK's youth squads and later become manager for Vasalund, a club which has a collaborative agreement with AIK. July 2017 saw several squad changes, especially among the strikers. Failed Bosnian signing Sulejman Krpić was let go. Nicolás Stefanelli, a short, pacy Argentine with a decent goal-scoring track record from the Argentine Primera División, was given a 3.5-year contract. And after having scored 5 goals in 16 appearances in China's second tier, Chinedu Obasi was released prematurely by Shenzen and became a free agent. AIK re-recruited the Nigerian for the remainder of the 2017 season. During the summer, AIK also recruited Rasmus Lindkvist as a left wing back for their 3–5–2 formation. An immediate and arguably unexpected hit, Lindkvist posed just as strong a threat to the opponents as the ever-improving Daniel Sundgren did on the opposite wing. Lindkvist was awarded a spot in the national team in January 2018. AIK secured the second place in the league with one game left. They finished the season with an unbeaten streak of twelve league matches (eight wins and four draws). The defense had been solid all year, but towards the end AIK also finally got their earlier weak spots, the central midfield and the strikers, to gel and flourish, giving fans hope for a successful 2018 season. The 2017 season also saw the end of central midfielder, vice captain and set-piece specialist Stefan Ishizaki's second spell at the club, after having played a total of 11 seasons for AIK. Another player who left the club after 11 seasons was the captain Nils-Eric Johansson, who had to retire from football in February 2018, due to a heart condition. He made 297 appearances for AIK. Leading up to the 2018 season, AIK made several unusually high-profile recruitments, including Enoch Kofi Adu, Joel Ekstrand and Tarik Elyounoussi plus former AIK players Nabil Bahoui (on loan) and Alexander Milošević. After suffering major injuries on several key defenders, Robin Jansson was recruited from third-tier Oddevold who had recently hosted AIK in a cup fixture. The 25-year-old central defender, who had been playing in the sixth tier as late as 2015, was working in a factory when the call from AIK came. Jansson quickly secured a spot in AIK's back three, showing off a left foot that delivered lethal crosses. AIK managed to end in second place coming in to the summer break, which saw another major signing: Sebastian Larsson, who joined the club after playing a major part in reaching the quarter finals with Sweden in the World Cup 2018. AIK were in top of the league from the 13th game day to the end, but due to several draws in the final few games, the club needed a win or a draw in the last game of the season, away at Kalmar, to secure the title. A header from Jansson just before half-time was the only goal of the game, and AIK were champions for the first time since 2009. When it was time to lift the trophy, Goitom graciously handed over his captain's armband to former captain Johansson, who had been forced to retire pre-season, and let him be the first to lift the trophy. AIK came into the 2019 season having sold Kristoffer Olsson to Krasnodar and Robin Jansson to Orlando. Jansson was replaced by Karol Mets, captain of the Estonia national team, who excelled during the spring season. Replacing Olsson proved to be trickier. AIK came into the summer break in third place, however, with last year's signing Tarik Elyounoussi at the top of the league's Golden Boot on nine goals. AIK finished the 2019 season on a respectable 62 points, which, however, only resulted in fourth place, the club's first season out of the top three since 2012, meaning that AIK's only shot at playing in the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League is winning the 2019/2020 Swedish Cup. Leading up to the 2020 season, AIK lost Elyounoussi as well as first-choice goalkeeper Oscar Linnér, but welcomed back Ghanese midfielder Ebenezer Ofori after four years in the Bundesliga and MLS.

During World War II he worked with Tommy Flowers at Bletchley Park on Colossus, the world's first electronic computer, that helped to decode encrypted German messages using the Lorenz cipher. After the war, he worked on ERNIE, a machine based on Colossus engineering that was used to generate bond numbers for the Premium Bond draw.  Early life and education  Fensom was born in Catford, in South London. Shortly after his birth the family moved to Fife, where they stayed until 1928. His secondary education was at the Royal Liberty School in Gidea Park where he excelled in mathematics and the sciences. He left school at 16, shunning a university education in favour of finding work. Whilst working for the GPO as an engineer, Fensom continued his education at night school, studying for City and Guilds at East Ham, Borough and Northampton polytechnics.  World War II  In 1942, Fensom was sent to work at Dollis Hill Research Station with Tommy Flowers, Sidney Broadhurst and William Chandler. He began working on projects connected to the Enigma machine. Other projects included the Nightingale, the Tunny and the Heath Robinson. Fensom's work took him increasingly to Bletchley Park and in December 1943 the first Colossus machine was installed at Bletchley Park to decode the messages from the Lorenz machine. The Mark II Colossus was installed on 1 June 1944 in time for the D-day landings on 6 June. By the end of the war there were ten functioning Colossi working around the clock helping to decipher the messages of German High Command. The deciphered messages provided the Allies with crucial intelligence on what enemy armed forces were plotting. The allies knew for example that Hitler had swallowed the bait that the D-Day landings in June 1944 would be at Calais rather than Normandy. This gave the Allies a decisive advantage. Sir Harry Hinsley, as the official historian, in his book 'British Intelligence in the Second World War' gave his opinion that the breaking of the Enigma and Lorenz codes shortened the war by at least two years and saved hundreds of thousands of lives.  Post war activity  After the war, Fensom continued to work for the GPO at Dollis Hill. In 1957 he was given charge by Sydney Broadhurst of the system design of a machine called ERNIE, which was to be used to deliver the winning numbers of the prizes for the Premium Bonds.

BL-70/US 40/MO 5 run northeast, where it intersects both Old Highway 40 and Sombart Road, the latter of which serves as a connection to the Santa Fe Trail. As it passes by Frederick T. Kemper Park the routes curve to the east, and approaches Missouri Route 87 (Main Street), where US 40/MO 5 turns left at a northbound overlap, while BL-70 turns south at a southbound overlap, until both routes turn southeast onto Bingham Road, and Main Street becomes \\"Highway B.\\" The further the road gets away from Boonville, the more chances the suburban settings give way to rural and agricultural ones. Aside from the western terminus of Missouri Route 98, the only other site is the Hail Ridge Golf Course, and a local street leading to Jesse Viertel Memorial Airport.

The Interstate 70 Business Loop begins at Exit 228, a Single Point Urban Interchange with Missouri Route 94 (First Capitol Drive), and turns north, immediately having an unconventional interchange with Boone's Lick Road. From there it passes by a city water tower just south of West Clay Street. As it runs past Lindenwood University BL-70/MO 94 curves around a former segment of First Capitol Drive, then re-encounters that road as BL-70 makes a sharp right turn to the east while MO 94 continues to the northeast along Kings Highway. First Capitol Drive runs at a straight line towards Riverside Drive and the Katy Trail State Park along the Missouri River, but BL-70 doesn't go that far. Instead, it makes a sharp right turn at South Fifth Street, which becomes North Fifth Street two blocks north of this intersection. South Fifth Street is four lanes wide with a center left-turn lanes for one block, but narrows down to two lanes between Jackson and Tompkins Streets, only to widen again south of McDonough Street. The route becomes a divided highway before the intersection with Boone's Lick Road, and the last intersection along the route is Bass Pro Drive and Ameristar Boulevard.

It ran from Exit 47 at the east end of the Ohio State Route 4 overlap onto an expressway. The first interchange is a diamond interchange with Enon Road, then a partial cloverleaf with the southern terminus of Ohio State Route 369. The route made and easterly turn before crossing a bridge over a railroad line then encounters a west-to-southbound only fly-under interchange with Lower Valley Pike shortly before another westbound only fly-under interchange with U.S. Route 40, where the expressway ends. After the interchange with U.S. 68, which also includes a bridge over the Mad River, US 40/OH 4/BL-70 branches off to the northeast to break away from the Historic National Road onto Park Road, then becomes part of North Street. The route become a one-way pair after Bletcher Avenue, with the eastbound lanes moving to Columbia Street. Continuing to pass through downtown Springfield, the routes are joined by Ohio State Route 41 at North Yellow Springs Street. Eastbound US 40/OH 4/OH 41/BL-70 passes under a bridge that carries Ohio State Route 72 on North Spring Street, while westbound US 40/OH 4/OH 41/BL-70 intersects OH 72 directly. Access to OH 72 from North Spring Street to either East Main Street or the westbound routes along North Street. OH 4 leaves the concurrency remaining on Columbia Street, when the one-way pair ends at an interchange for Lagonda Avenue, then turns southeast on another brief limited-access segment which ends as it rejoins Main Street at an at-grade interchange that includes North and South Greenmount Avenues. OH 41 leaves the concurrency at the intersection with North and South Belmont Avenues, specifically turning onto South Belmont Avenue. East of South Fostoria Avenue, US 40/BL-70 ran over another bridge over a railroad line, then widens to a four-lane divided highway with a wider grassy median. Some portions of this segment are also flanked by frontage roads.

Caro Road in Watrousville, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It currently houses the Watrousville Museum. History Aaron Watrous first moved to the site of what is now Watrousville in 1852, looking to make money in the logging business. In 1853 he built a sawmill near this site, and shortly afterward built a log boarding house and frame lean-to, from which he operated a store. In 1860 Watrous purchased the land at this location, and platted the village of Watrousville. Some time between 1860 and 1864, he built the first story of the Watrous General Store. In 1864, Watrous sold the store and lot to David Philbrick for $300. Soon after, the building was increased in size to the present dimensions. The Philbrick family at first operated a general store out of the building. However, by 1875, they were operating a furniture store. In 1882, the Philbricks sold the building to the township of Juniata for use as a township hall. In 1972, the Watrousville – Caro Area Historical Society engaged with the township on a 99-year lease of the building. The Society began refurbishing the building and it now houses the Watrousville Museum. Description The Watrous General Store is a two-story balloon frame rectangular structure with a gable roof and a cut stone foundations. It has a one-story wing attached on one side. The structure measures forty feet long by thirty feet wide, including the wing. The exterior is plain but for a heavy wood molding under the eaves and above the front door. The unusually tall door is flanked by black metal light fixtures. The windows on the first floor of the main structure are two over four double hung sash units, the upstairs windows are six over six double hung sash units, and the windows in the wing are two over two double hung sash units.

It was built in 1909 for what is now the oldest Grange chapter (founded 1872) in New England to operate under its original charter. The building is a well-preserved example of vernacular Queen Anne architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history The Caledonia No. 9 Grange Hall is located in the village of East Hardwick, on the east side of Church Street opposite its junction with Stevens Lane. It is a clapboarded wood-frame structure with a gable roof, presenting 1-1/2 stories to the street. It is set on a steep hillside above the Lamoille River, however, and has a full understory. The street-facing facade has a single-story hip-roofed porch across the front, supported by turned posts with jigsawn brackets and turned balustrades on either side of the entry stair. Scrolled brackets also adorn the building corners. A similar porch once sheltered the secondary entrance on the lower level; its surviving decorative elements have been stored. The East Hardwick Grange chapter was founded in 1873, just one year after the first Grange chapter in New England was established in St. Johnsbury. This chapter at first met in other village spaces, including a church and the village hall, before having this building constructed in 1909. The building committee overseeing the project included former Governor of Vermont Charles J. Bell. The building is distinctive in Vermont in part because relatively few Grange halls were built specifically for that purpose, and were built following guidelines published by the national organization.

The film stars Dakota Fanning, Toni Collette, Alice Eve, River Alexander and Patton Oswalt, and was distributed by Magnolia Pictures. After playing at various film festivals, the film was simultaneously released theatrically and on-demand on January 26, 2018. Plot Wendy (Dakota Fanning)—a brilliant young woman who has autism and a fixation on Star Trek—lives a routine life in an Oakland, California group home where she is monitored by her primary caregiver, Scottie (Toni Collette). She spends her time writing a 450-page Star Trek script to enter in Paramount Pictures' screenwriting contest in hopes of winning the $100,000 prize. Wendy is visited by her sister Audrey (Alice Eve), who shows Wendy pictures of her infant daughter, Ruby, and reveals that she is selling their childhood home. Wendy asks Audrey to take her home, arguing that she will be able to buy back the house and help Audrey care for Ruby once she wins the screenwriting contest. Audrey refuses, informing Wendy she isn't capable of caring for a baby. Unfortunately, Wendy has a meltdown and Audrey leaves the group home weeping. After Wendy misses the mail-in date to send her script to Paramount Pictures, she decides to deliver the script herself. She leaves the group home early the next morning and is followed by the group home's small dog, Pete. Wendy and Pete board a bus to Los Angeles, but are kicked off and left by the side of the road after Pete urinates on the bus. Wendy then wanders into a shanty town, where she is mugged of most of her money. She then wanders to a nearby shop and is nearly swindled out of the last of her money by an employee. An elderly woman named Rose (Marla Gibbs) intervenes to stop the employee from exploiting Wendy. Rose sympathizes with Wendy as her grandson also has autism, and lets Wendy accompany her on the senior citizens' bus. The bus driver subsequently falls asleep at the wheel, crashing the bus without warning. Following the bus crash, Wendy wakes up in a hospital in Bakersfield. Still determined to deliver her script as planned, Wendy leaves Pete at the hospital, and escapes. During her escape, Wendy loses part of her script by chance. She gathers used paper and begins rewriting the script. Simultaneously, Audrey and Scottie have realized Wendy is missing. They begin to search for her and file a missing persons report. After correctly deducing that Wendy left for Los Angeles to personally deliver her script, Scottie and her son Sam (River Alexander) leave on the road. The Bakersfield hospital notifies Audrey and Scottie of Wendy's whereabouts; police continue the search from there. Scottie and Sam find the missing script pages while scouring the hospital. Wendy then attempts to buy a bus ticket to Los Angeles, but is unable as she has no money. She ultimately stows away on the next bus to Los Angeles, hiding herself inside a baggage compartment. Upon her arrival in Los Angeles, Wendy wanders around until two police officers recognize her from the missing persons report. Officer Frank (Patton Oswalt) gains Wendy's trust by speaking to her in Klingon. The officers bring Wendy to the police station, where she is reunited with Audrey and Scottie. They bring Wendy to Paramount Pictures so she can deliver her script as planned. Despite being stonewalled by a rude mailroom worker, Wendy is able to sneak past security and submit the script to the turn-in box. Satisfied that she has completed her mission, Wendy informs her sister she did this to prove that she was more capable than Audrey thought. Wendy returns back to the group home where she later receives a letter from Paramount informing her script was not chosen, but encouraging her to continue writing. Despite the rejection, she is satisfied with everything she has accomplished. Wendy visits Audrey and holds her niece in her arms for the first time.

He developed his family paper manufacturing company into a major industrial enterprise. He was innovative in introducing profit sharing and encouraging his employees to acquire shares in the business. Family Jean-Edmond Laroche-Joubert was born on 12 January 1820 in La Couronne, Charente. His parents were Jean Baptiste Laroche (1779–1864) and Marie Joubert (born 1786). Both his father and his mother came from old paper-making families of the Angoumois province. His father was a paper manufacturer with a large family, allied with the Barrots. On 13 October 1842 he married Marguerite Triaud (1823–1907). Their children were Jean Edgard (1843–1913) and Antoinette (1850–1869). Industrialist At the age of 20 Laroche-Joubert began working with his father's business. Laroche-Joubert and his brother Jean officially took over the business from their father in July 1845 at a time when the paper mills were already using modern technology that had been developed in the first half of the century. The Nersac paper mill had been mechanized in 1836. At an early age Laroche-Joubert demonstrated considerable business skills. He contributed to the family company by equipping it with the most advanced mechanical equipment. In addition to the family factory of Nersac he founded several other plants and created a large industrial enterprise in Angoulême, which became \\"Laroche-Joubert, Lacroix et Cie\\" in 1863. Laroche-Joubert mechanized the plants of the two main manufacturing centers of L’Escalier and Girac in La Couronne. He installed second-generation machines almost long making sheets of paper wide. The business continued to grow in the 1850s after the crisis of 1848, winning medals at the Paris expositions for the quality and originality of the paper products. The company was known for high quality writing papers that could be watermarked with all sorts of drawings at the choice of the buyer. It also made envelopes, notebooks for school children, account books and many other products. At one time Jean Edmond Laroche-Joubert had almost 1,500 workers and employees. The company had several manufacturing plants including the Escalier and Girac plants in La Couronne, and workshops created in 1843 in Angoulême. A crèche was established at the factory in Angouleme, with 60 infants in 1880. In 1857 Laroche frères transformed one of four wheat mills on the Basseau dam into an annex of the Martinet paper company. In 1885 there was an attempt to transform it into a pulp mill. After Laroche frères went bankrupt, in 1888 Papeterie Laroche-Joubert bought the property. Social contract Manufacture Laroche Joubert in 1862 From 1843 Edmond Laroche-Joubert instituted profit-sharing. From 1850 he developed social works to improve the living conditions of the workers. In 1868 the company took the name \\"Papeterie coopérative d’Angoulême\\". Employees received production bonuses, a share of profits, and could acquire shares in the company and thus become co-owners. Laroche-Joubert believed that social peace must rest on social equity, the indissoluble union of capital, labor and management. These three should share the profits they generate. Throughout his life he strove for cooperation based on the principle of employee participation in the prosperity of the company.

He was elected to represent Charente in the Corps législatif on 7 November 1868. He sat with the dynastic majority. He was reelected on 23 May 1869, and sat with the center right. He was not consistent in his political stances. As a Republican, on 14 July 1970 he attempted to delay debate on the war with Prussia through a filibuster.

On 5 March 1876 he ran on a Bonapartist platform and was elected in the second round for the first constituency of Angoulême. He sat on the right with the Appel au peuple group. He proposed many bills, each presented as \\"being of interest to the greatest number\\" of people. Topics included tax laws, education and cooperation. A bill asking for gymnastics to be taught in prisons was rejected on the basis that it would help \\"the greatest number\\" of thieves to climb the walls.

Background and release In early December 2017, Timothy Heller, a woman with whom Melanie Martinez once shared a friendship, accused the latter via Twitter of sexually assaulting and raping her. In response to Heller's accusations, Martinez tweeted that the allegations \\"horrified and saddened\\" her and that Heller \\"never said no to what they chose to do together\\", insinuating that she believed there was consent. The singer subsequently released a second statement, thanking her fans for pointing out Heller's \\"false statements\\" and that she would \\"never be intimate with someone without their absolute consent.\\" In less than 20 days after the incident, Martinez wrote and recorded \\"Piggyback\\".

It was premiered by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon from 16 November 2017 to 10 February 2018, directed by Gregory Doran and with Richard McCabe as Cicero. It played at the Gielgud Theatre in London from 14 June to 8 September 2018. Plot summary The cycle consists of six plays, each roughly one hour long, performed as two groups of three, all narrated by Cicero's slave and later freedman Tiro. =Part I - Conspirator= The first group consists of the plays Cicero, Catiline and Clodius. It includes a brief flashback to Cicero's prosecution of Verres in 70 BC but mainly runs from Cicero's election campaign for consul in 64 BC until his exile in 58 BC, adapting material from the end of Imperium, the whole of Lustrum and the start of Dictator. =Part II - Dictator = The second group adapts the remainder of Dictator into three plays entitled Caesar, Mark Anthony and Octavian. The first opens as Cicero returns to Italy in the wake of Caesar's victory at Pharsalus in 48 BC, followed by a summing-up of the recent Civil War and Caesar's assumption of dictatorial powers. The rest of the three plays then follows Cicero's reaction to the Ides of March and his failed attempts to save the Roman Republic by playing Mark Anthony and Octavian off against each other, culminating in Cicero's execution in 43 BC. The final play ends with an epilogue by Tiro, covering the later fates of Brutus, Cassius, Octavian and Mark Anthony and imagining Cicero's afterlife in words from his own Dream of Scipio.

The church was constructed between 1869 and 1875 to designs of Giorgio Costantino Schinas, in a combination of architectural styles. The oratory and dome were added later on in the 1890s and 1950s; the latter was designed by Andrea Vassallo and it was constructed under the direction of Ġużè Damato. History As the settlement of Casale San Giuseppe (as Ħamrun was then known) began to grow in the 19th century, the two old churches dedicated to Our Lady of Atocia (tas-Samra) and Our Lady of Porto Salvo (ta' Nuzzu) became too small to cater for the area. Therefore, the decision was taken to construct a new church, and it was dedicated to Saint Cajetan according to the wishes of Bishop Gaetano Pace Forno, instead of Saint Joseph, to whom there was popular devotion in the area. The Ħamrun skyline as seen from Floriana, dominated by the church's bell towers and dome The foundation stone of the new church was laid down on 13 June 1869, on a plot of land donated by the Judge Giovanni Conti. Funds were raised by the government, the population and some benefactors, and the building was designed by the architect Giorgio Costantino Schinas. The building was completed in 1875, being inaugurated on 11 July of that year by Bishop Carmelo Scicluna. At the time of its construction, the area still formed part of the parish of Qormi, but Ħamrun became a separate parish on 1 December 1881, with the Church of St. Cajetan becoming the parish church. The church was dedicated on 26 September 1930. The oratory was added in 1895, to designs of Andrea Grima. The dome was designed in the 1920s by Andrea Vassallo, but construction was delayed for a number of decades before it was actually built between 13 April 1953 and 20 April 1955, under the direction of Ġużè Damato. Despite being constructed decades after his death, the dome was built to his original designs with structural alterations made by Damato. The church's roof The titular statue depicting Saint Cajetan was sculpted between 1885 and 1888 by Karlu Darmanin, with the pedestal being made by Giovanni Farrugia and the detachable platform by Antonio Sciortino. The altarpiece depicts Saint Cajetan receiving the baby Jesus from Mary, and it was painted by the Italian artist Pietro Gagliardi. Other works of art in the church include paintings by G. Briffa, Raphael Bonnici, Ramiro Calì, Emvin Cremona and other Maltese and Italian artists. The interior of the dome contains paintings by Emvin Cremona. Parts of the church's interior were altered following the Second Vatican Council, with the main altar being replaced, and some side altars being replaced by confessionals. The centenary of the parish was celebrated in 1981 with the relics of Saint Cajetan being temporarily brought over to the church. Restoration works have been undertaken on the dome interior, and on a number of paintings located in the church. Thirty solar panels were installed on the roof in 2012. Architecture The dome The Parish Church of St. Cajetan has a cruciform plan, with two side aisles and a short choir. The two bell towers are the highest in Malta, and together with the dome they dominate Ħamrun's skyline. The church is built in a combination of several architectural styles, exhibiting influences from a number of medieval and classical sources. In particular, it draws from the French Gothic style, especially from the Laon Cathedral, and from the Venetian Baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute. The church's dome is regarded as being one of the finest in Malta. Schinas' original plan was to have a Romanesque turret-like structure similar to those found at Mainz Cathedral and the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse, but these would have been alien to the Maltese environment. Vassallo designed the present dome decades after the construction of the church, but it is harmonious to the rest of the building. It draws inspiration from the dome of Santa Maria della Salute, and it is also bears some similarities to the dome of the Parish Church of St. Nicholas in Siġġiewi, which had been designed by Vassallo in 1919.

It has 800 choristers and its members are between the ages of five and eighteen, and divided into Junior Division (Prelude, Minuet, Sonata, and Concerto Levels) and Senior Division (Debut and Premier Ensembles, and Scholars) across its four chapter cities - Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. Described as “one of the finest children’s choirs in the world today”, by conductor Grant Gershon, the chorus is noted for its refined choral sound, unique bicoastal structure, and esteemed music education and vocal training program, which empowers its members through ideals of artistic excellence, cultural openness, and social diversity. The chorus regularly appears at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and the Hollywood Bowl.  Origins  Though now fully secularized, National Children's Chorus traces its lineage back to the Paulist tradition of the late 19th Century. = Paulist Choristers = In 1904 Father William Finn (1881-1961) founded the Paulist Choristers of Chicago, an a capella, treble choir for boys (ages 5–13), which sang at the Vatican for Pope Pius X in 1912, and toured the United States during World War I to raise money for French refugee relief efforts. In 1918, Father Finn established the first Catholic Choir School in New York, and founded the Paulist Choristers of New York at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in Manhattan. In 1925, the New York ensemble began to perform on the WLWL radio station, and also on the NBC radio show, \\"The Catholic Hour.\\" The choir also gave frequent concerts at the Metropolitan Opera House. In addition to performances, each ensemble maintained separate recording projects with Columbia Records and Victor Records. In 1928, Father Eugene O’Malley, an original Chicago Paulist chorister, succeeded Father Finn as director of the Chicago ensemble. Under his leadership the choir once again traveled across the country, and performed at the White House. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Chicago and New York groups were disbanded during a liturgical shift towards contemporary sacred music throughout the Catholic Church in the United States. In 1977, despite the reformation in Catholic liturgy, Sister Stella Maria Enright (1933-2017) and Jon Wattenberger (1948-1992), a pupil of Father Finn's teachings, founded the Paulist Choristers of California at St. Paul the Apostle Church and School in Westwood, Los Angeles. The ensemble quickly gained international fame through recordings and performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, Los Angeles Master Chorale, and the Joffrey Ballet, in addition to multiple television/movie appearances and international tours to London, Oxford, Venice, Florence, Salzburg, and Paris. After Wattenberger's death, the ensemble was led, between 1992 and 2004, by conductors Dana Marsh and Sir Martin Neary, who famously conducted music for the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997. In 2002, the Paulist Choristers were invited to sing music from The Lord of the Rings with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, under the baton of Maestro John Mauceri. For the first time in Paulist history, girls were inducted into the organization, marking the first-ever co-ed appearance for the group. = Transition to National Children's Chorus = In 2004, following the exit of Neary from the position, Luke McEndarfer was chosen as the 4th Artistic Director of the Paulist Choristers of California. In 2009, with the support of Sister Stella, McEndarfer fully secularized the chorus, formally changed the group's name, and co-founded the National Children's Chorus with Cristina Demiany. This organizational change signified the formal separation of the group from the Catholic Church after more than a century. NCC broadened its programming to create ensembles for boys and girls of varying ages and vocal facility, including its first-ever SATB ensemble, and expanded to New York (2011), Washington, D.C. (2014) and San Francisco (2019). The organization maintains conductor training partnerships with graduate conducting programs at University of Southern California (2016) and Manhattan School of Music (2017), in addition to partnerships with the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and UCLA.

They can be painted or sculpted and usually present a Zen master ceremonially dressed and seated upright in chair.Baroni, Helen Josephine. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism. The Rosen Publishing, Group Inc, 2002 Chinsō include realistic portraits of prominent Zen monks, possibly commissioned by them and painted while they were alive or shortly after they died, as well as depictions of famous Zen patriarchs from the past commissioned by his disciples.Lee, Sherman E. Reflections of Reality in Japanese Art. The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1983. Chinsō were believed to have been passed down by Zen masters to their disciples as a symbol of dharma transmission, and known to have been meant for use in rituals, especially to represent the deceased during memorial services, and as an icon for their followers. Before monks would die, they would sometimes write a simple poem in the upper part of their portrait called eulogy, or have another author or monk write an inscription at the top. In Japan many remaining sculptural Buddhist chinsō are made out of wood, which may explain why so few remain in China and Korea on account of the Huichang persecution when most wooden sculptures perished.Pat, Youngsook. Handbook of Korean Art Buddhist Sculpture. Yekyong Publishing Co, 2002. Some of the oldest surviving chinsō of Chan masters were brought from China to Japan; about 12 of those are extant.Foulk T. Griffith, Sharf Robert H. On the Ritual Use of Ch'an Portraiture in Medieval China. In: Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie, Vol. 7, 1993. pp. 149–219.  Background and history  332x332pxChinsō flourished during the Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279–1368) dynasties in China, and were introduced in Japan during the Kamakura period (1185–1333). They are considered historically significant because of their antiquity, preservation and artistic quality. There are about 70 known surviving chinsō from China and Japan from the 13th and 16th centuries that are designated “national treasures,” but about 10 times that number have survived in Japanese museums and temple collections. = In China = 363x363pxChinsō emerged from mainstream traditions of Chinese portraiture during the Song dynasty (960–1279).Lippit, Yukio. “Negative Verisimilitude: The Zen Portrait in Medieval Japan.” In Asian Art History in the Twenty-First Century, edited by Vishaka Desai, 64–95. Williamstown: Sterling and Francine Clari Art Institute, 2007. Nothing visually distinguished them from other portraits done at the time of Chinese elite; the formal qualities were all the same. Chinsō are mainly understood to follow this basic formula: the monk is seated cross-legged in a chair, feet hidden, with his shoes on a footstool in front of him, in a three-quarter view, and ceremonially dressed with inner and outer robes and a kasaya or surplice draped over his left shoulder. The surplice can be held together with an ornamental ring right over the monk's heart. He usually holds something in his right hand, like a whisk, scepter, staff or bamboo. They follow the highest standard for painting at the time. As well as following the same basic formula of Chinese portraiture, chinsō assumed the characteristics of Chinese portraiture in general. These included private ownership, verse inscriptions, their role in social networks. Surviving chinsō also include many works created in Japan once Zen Buddhism was brought there from China. 360x360px 160x160px = In Japan = When Zen Buddhism was brought to Japan from China, the Chinese style of portraiture as well as these traditions surrounding chinsō, were brought with them. This realistic style was not typical in Japan and set chinsō apart from other portraits at the time in Japan because of their high degree of verisimilitude. Although most easily identifiable chinsō have the subject seated in a chair, in three-quarter profile against a black background, with an inscription at the top, not all chinsō followed this rigid formula. The portraits of Japanese monks Mokuan Shuyu and Ikkyu Sojun represent this identifiable formula, but the alternative version of Ikkyu Sojun does not. Instead of being seated in three-quarter view, the monk or patriarch could be shown frontally, or as a full figure, and could be in a circular frame instead of simply as a figure against a blank background. Less common are chinsō showing a monk in meditation in a landscape setting, where he could be either walking or sitting. Chinsō are usually inscribed at the top with a eulogy written in free verse, describing who the patriarch was, why it was made and possibly who wrote the eulogy and why. Some scholars distinguish chinsō from the soshizō 祖師像 category, which includes portraits of legendary patriarchs from the distant past, by checking whether or not the portrait is inscribed. It's also important to note that the soshizō were not as realistic as the chinsō.  Origin of the term chinsō  Chinsō, or dingxiang in Chinese, is a Chinese Buddhist neologism, and was originally a translation for the Sanskrit term uṣṇīṣa. The usnisa is the term coined for the fleshy protuberance on top of the Buddha's head. In India it was said to be invisible because it is unable to be seen by living beings. During the Song dynasty in China, the term chinsō began being used for portraits of Zen monks as we know the term today. The existence of a protuberance on top of a Buddha's head represented the fact he had reached enlightenment,Krishan, Yuvraj. The Buddha Image: Its Origin and Development. Munshiram Manoharial Publishers, New Delhi, 1996. similar to how chinsō were thought to prove enlightenment when passed down from a monk to his disciple.  Functions of chinsō  Chinsō have been known to serve many purposes throughout their history. The category includes portraits commissioned by the Zen monks themselves and painted while they are alive or shortly after they had died, and portraits commissioned by famous Zen patriarchs’ disciples to be used for worship. Scholars have also concluded that they could have been used as certificates or proof of dharma transmission. By proof of dharma transmission, it is meant that the portraits were thought to have been passed down from Zen master to their disciples when they became enlightened, since dharma transmission is the recognition of the enlightenment in a monk's successor and the passing down of lineage. This theory has since been questioned by scholars. Since the category of chinsō is so broad and includes portraits used for worship as well as portraits used to represent dharma transmission, the category could use stricter guidelines for classifying portrait as chinsō. The true function of chinsō is under question by scholars for the purpose of clarifying the category. More recently (since about 1994) it has come to the attention of scholars that chinsō were used in a mortuary context, rather than used to certify or authenticate dharma transmission. This was particularly the case in China. They were used after monks had died, meaning that they were used like other icons are: as a receptacle for a deity in a ritual context, like objects of worship in temples. An article by T. Griffith Foulk and Robert Sharf published in 1994 attempted to demystify this part of Zen culture by clarifying that chinsō did not serve as evidence of dharma transmission but are simply a category of Buddhist portraiture used in a mortuary context. Their inscriptions provide possible legitimization to lineage of transmission and possible affiliation, but are said to not have been given for the sole purpose of certifying enlightenment. This argument is supported by their claims that chinsō, unlike more important items for representing transmission like a monk's robes, were passed out freely in China to “laymen, novices, merchants, and the like”. Their argument goes on to say chinsō could have just been part of the regular gift-giving tradition. Different recipients of chinsō include designated dharma heirs associated with specific lineages, another meaningful relation to the monk, who received the portrait as a gift or an anonymous person who received the portrait at a fundraiser (a “hauzshu” in Chinese). The purpose and usage of chinsō is still in question by scholars. Statue of Monk Chikotsu Dai'e Some dharma lineages have been heavily influenced by portraiture. For example, the Portrait of Chikotsu Dai’e established Chikotsu Dai’e 癡兀大慧 (1229–1312) as a disciple of the Chan monk Enni Ben’e 円爾弁円(1202–1280) because the inscription of the chinsō is similar to that of Enni Ben’en's on his own portrait, and Enni's is similar to that of his predecessor Wuzun Shifan 無準師範 (1178–1249), a Chinese Chan monk. The portrait of Wuzun Shih-fan was brought by his disciple Enni Ben’en to Japan in 1241 and is one of the oldest surviving chinsō. Chikotsu Dai’e's portrait thus establishes the genealogical sequence of Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni and then to Chikotsu. Though it is unclear if chinsō served as certificates of dharma transmission, throughout history they have been used to show a direct line of dharma transmission and lineage. The portraits of these three monks show a clear acknowledgment of enlightenment from one monk to his disciple, from Wuzun Shih-fan to Enni Ben’en to Chikotsu Dai’e. Although each monk may not have passed down their chinsō to his disciple as proof of transmission, we can understand the history of lineage as being shown through the passing down of the portraits.

The Artwork  thumb La Nouvelle Liberté is the most famous and emblematic artwork of Douala, which today has become a symbol of the city. Produced by Joseph-Francis Sumégné in 1996, the Nouvelle Liberté is a majestic 12 meters tall sculpture made of scrap metals, erected in the middle of the busiest roundabouts of Douala, the Rond Point Deido. It features a 5 meters wingspan, and a mass of 8 tons. This artwork pays tribute to the contemporary culture of the city: the culture of recycling, of the assembly and disassembly of objects, of the ability of citizens in “se débrouiller” (getting by) in many complex situations. Despite the fact La Nouvelle Liberté has become an icon of the city, this sculpture is still often nicknamed the Njo Njo of Deido (meaning the evil, the monster of Deido). This negative designation is based on the strong protests carried on by local media and native populations against La Nouvelle Liberté. The first polemics mainly concerned the aesthetical features of the sculpture, made of recycled metallic pieces. Also, a violent controversy was raised by media on the origins of the artist (coming from the West Region of Cameroun) taking the fold of an ethnic struggle between the native and not native population of Douala. These diatribes led to subsequent attacks and vandalism of the work. For these reasons, La Nouvelle Liberté was officially inaugurated eleven years later during SUD2007. The artwork was sponsored by doual'art and donated to the Municipality of Douala (owner). This latter funded the pedestal on which the sculpture stands today. The crossroad where La Nouvelle Liberté was installed is considered the gateway of the city, the most important traffic hub from which the main boulevards of the city bring towards the center (through Akwa district), the Eastern popular districts, and out of Douala (through the Wouri Bridge and Bonaberi district). After the installation and donation of La Nouvelle Liberté to the Municipality of Douala, this latter has considerably invested on the urbanization of the Rond Point Deido, in particular through the eviction of informal markets surrounding the area, through the installation of street lights, new flooring works, and through the care of the garden of the roundabout.

Patented in England in 1821, it eliminated the stock of the Admiralty, making it both easier to handle and stow. Though it did not hold as well as an Admiralty, the trade-off proved acceptable and the stockless anchor became widely popular, and remains so today. Design The stockless anchor is an improved version of the Admiralty anchor it is derived from. It has two flukes that pivot on the same plane perpendicular to the shank. The weight of the shank and accompanying chain, or the shank angled under tension, keep the anchor laying flat on the sea floor. Performance The stockless anchor is simple design with no unnecessary parts. This makes it comparatively easy to handle and store. The simple geometry of its design makes breaking it from the bottom a relatively easy and reliable procedure. The shank being able to pivot while the flukes are embedded in the sea floor minimizes wear on attachment hardware. Another advantage of the pivoting shank design is that the anchor generally will still hold even if the wind and or current changes direction and causes the vessel to pull on the anchor from a slightly different angle. Due to the simple design of the stockless anchor, it is capable of free falling much faster in water than other more bulky anchor types according to a study done by The Japan Institute of Navigation. In terms of disadvantages, the stockless anchor is shown to perform poorly in soft cohesive bottoms such as soil or sand compared to other anchor types made specifically for that type of bottom.

Family DU Elizabethan Society CrestJohnston was born 25 November 1883 in Derry City, County Londonderry in Ireland to a Presbyterian family. Her father John Barr Johnston (1843 - 1919) was a knight, a merchant, as well as an alderman, mayor and justice of the peace from Tyrone. Her mother was Isabella Weir from Donegal. She had an older brother, John Alexander, who studied law, an older sister Margaret Chambers who became a secretary and a younger sister Kathleen Maude. Trinity College Dublin TCD had struggled for some time with the issue of allowing women to attend lecture, take exams and receive degrees. The long serving Provost, distinguished mathematician George Salmon, had long opposed women receiving degrees from the University. He is alleged to have said that women would only be admitted to TCD as students over his dead body. He eventually agreed to dropping his veto in 1901 when the Board voted in favour of allowing women to enter the university. Coincidentally, immediately after his death on Friday, 22 January 1904, Johnston became the first woman undergraduate to succeed in registering at TCD, and by the end of year other women had done likewise. She recalled, \\"When I arrived in Dublin 1904, I was informed that he [Salmon] had died that day, and the examination had to be put off until after the funeral.\\" The women in TCD were closely chaperoned when they started and unable to attend lectures and were permitted only to sit the exams. Johnston was the first woman to enter TCD where she read English and French. She was followed later the same year by the next women undergraduates, Ellen Tuckey and Avarina Shegog. She founded the women's debating society, The Dublin University Elizabethan Society, in 1905. Although \\"an active and able student\\" Johnston left before finishing her degree and married Fellow Stephen B. Kelleher, a mathematician and Catholic from Cork. Kelleher was the only Roman Catholic Fellow in the university at the time. Kelleher became the Erasmus Smith's Professor of Mathematics in Trinity for 1914-1917. The family later moved to England where Johnston became a founder member of the London branch of the DU Women graduates association.

Ditton is a successful solo long-distance yachtswoman. In her first solo crossing of the Atlantic, aged 25, Ditton was the youngest competitor and only woman to finish the Single-Handed Trans- Atlantic Race in 2005. Ditton crossed the finish line 4th in the multihull class after 27 days 9 hours 19 minutes at sea. In 2020, Ditton set a new women's world record for rowing solo from the US mainland to Hawaii. She completed the journey in 86 days and 10 hours.  Early life  Ditton grew up wanting to be an artist. She was passionate about sculpture in particular and a huge follower of the Young British Artist or YBA movement, in the 90s. By late 1999, Ditton had grown disillusioned with conceptual art and so set off for India to learn to carve stone. Ditton travelled on to Asia and in Thailand responded to an advert looking for crew to sail back to Europe via the Red Sea. This ocean voyage set the bar for many to come. After taking a 4-year sabbatical between her first and second year, Ditton graduated with a BA (Honours) degree in Fine Art from Chelsea College of Arts, part of the University of the Arts London. In 2012, she earned an M.A in Professional Writing from University College Falmouth.  Professional sailing  Ditton's first experience of winning yacht races was as crew on board the Transpac 52 Rosebud, on the Caribbean circuit in 2003. In 2007, Ditton raced in the Transpacific Yacht Race (known as the Transpac) on board the trimaran LoeReal, the boat originally built for the 1995 film Waterworld starring Kevin Costner. LoeReal was the 1st trimaran across the line and 3rd boat to finish, crossing with an elapsed time of 205:27:12. Ditton went on to project manage the boat's racing program based in San Diego, California. =Single-handed yacht racing= Ditton's first transatlantic crossing was aboard the famous trimaran Moxie in 2002. Ditton and crew survived a hurricane-force storm, which also decimated the fleet of the Route du Rhum. Moxie was forced to pitstop for repairs in the Azores, where Marc Guillemot, frontrunner of the trimaran fleet in the Route du Rhum, was also forced to stop for repairs. Inspired by this chance meeting, Ditton went on to race the next edition of Route du Rhum in 2006. This was Ditton's second transatlantic single-handed yacht race. Ditton came 2nd in class 2 for monohulls, with a crossing time of 25 days 02 hours 26 minutes in her 40 ft boat Dangerous When Wet. Ditton was one of 5 women of 74 entrants to enter the 2006 Route du Rhum race. Prior to 2006 and since the first edition of the race in 1978 only 7 women total had raced in the Route du Rhum, with 4 completing the course: Florence Arthaud (in 1978, 1982, 1986 and 1990), Aline Marchand (1978), Ellen MacArthur (1998, 2002) and Anne Caseneuve (1998, 2002). During the transatlantic race, Ditton penned the diary of her experience on the inside skin of the boat itself. After the Route du Rhum, her intention was to cut the boat in half, from bow to stern and exhibit the boat as two half-hulls; displaying half in a museum in Europe and the other half in an art gallery in South America. The boat sold complete with diary inside and on May 14, 2007, was abandoned and presumed sunk, circa 100 miles south of Bermuda. Ocean rowing Ditton was introduced to the sport of Ocean Rowing in 2008, by an Olympic hopeful Danish rower. Two years later, Ditton went on to become the 53rd woman to row the Atlantic and 64th woman to row any ocean after completing the Woodvale Challenge, which departed La Gomera in the Canary Islands for Antigua in the Caribbean. Ditton and her rowing partner finished the race as the 10th mixed pair ever to row the Atlantic. =Ocean rowing solo world record attempt= In October 2016, Ditton began training in San Francisco, CA, for a solo trans-Pacific ocean-rowing world record attempt. Departing in April 2022, Ditton will attempt to row circa 5,500 nautical miles solo and unsupported from Choshi, Japan to San Francisco, California. To date only 2 men have succeeded in rowing the North Pacific Ocean alone and without assistance. In 1991 Gerard d’Aboville departed Choshi, Japan and arrived in Ilwaco, Washington 134 days later. In 2005 Emmanuel Coindre departed Choshi, Japan and arrived in Coos Bay, Oregon 129 days later. Both men were towed the final distance to land, 20 miles and 50 miles respectively. Arguably, there is no record set for rowing land-to-land across the North Pacific.http://www.oceanrowing.com/Emmanuel_Coindre/2005/Press/Register- Guard.htm In December 2017, Ditton made the Forbes 2018 Women in Sports to Watch list, alongside speed skater Maame Biney, professional skateboarder Nora Vasconcellas and slopestyle snowboarder Spencer O'Brien. =Farallon Island solo rowing record attempt= In January 2018, Ditton set herself a smaller challenge as part of her training: to circumnavigate the Farallon Islands. The intention was to row a 70 nautical mile loop non-stop - out to the islands and back, which would be entered for consideration as a new Guinness World Record. According to the organisation Blue Point Conservation Science, on record no one had rowed to or from the Farallon Islands since Christmas 1898 in the era of the lighthouse keeper. Ditton's first attempt on 24 April 2018 ended after 10 hours. Her second attempt on 6 June 2018 also ended in failure. On 18 October 2018, Ditton finally completed the row in 3 days 35 minutes. The record was rejected by Guinness World Records on the grounds that \\"a first is not necessarily in itself a record. Records have to be breakable, measurable and comparable.\\" The short film about Ditton's row around the Farallons is called 'DETERMINATION: Farallon Record.' =San Francisco to Santa Barbara solo rowing trip= In June 2018, Ditton rowed under the Golden Gate Bridge of San Francisco, with 10 days of food packed on board her boat. After rounding Point Conception, Ditton was blasted by freak Santa Ana winds of 100 degrees fahrenheit. Ditton started drifting toward an oil rig. She dropped a sea anchor to slow down the vessel as it drifted, but, then found herself in a current heading westbound out to sea. Ditton arrived into Santa Barbara after 12.5 days at sea with nothing left to eat. Ditton said it was a good experience for what she will likely encounter on the Pacific and is quoted as having said, “You don’t learn anything if everything goes well.\\" Ditton categorized the 5 scariest challenges of rowing from San Francisco to Los Angeles as: 1. Jellyfish, 2. Weather, 3. Other Ships, 4. Sleep deprivation and 5. Rowing Nude. =Portland to San Francisco solo rowing trip= In September 2019, Ditton began a 30-day solo rowing trip 100 miles down the Columbia River at Portland, Oregon and headed out to sea, following a path charted along the edge of the Continental Shelf. She arrived in Sausalito on September 25 after rowing under the Golden Gate Bridge, completing her 828-mile journey.Gregory Thomas, \\"60-foot waves and 24 days: Rower survives solo journey from Washington to SF Bay,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, Sept. 27, 2019. Print: pp. A1, A8. According to Ditton, the open water trip was a training run for her planned 2020 trans-Pacific journey. Ditton characterized her Portland-to-San Francisco expedition as \\"a beautiful ordeal,\\" noting that at one point in the journey she faced a storm with 40-knot winds and 60-foot breaking waves, with one wave tipping her boat on its side and forcing her to hang on for dear life by jamming her feet into the footboards and tightly gripping the rails of her cockpit. At another point she was trapped in a powerful circular eddy, from which she extricated herself by counterintuitively rowing for two days back to the North from whence she came and escaping slightly to the West of the current. =San Francisco to Hawaii solo world record= In September 2020, Ditton set a new women’s world record for rowing solo from San Francisco to Hawaii. She made landfall at 06.10 am 12th September, reaching Waikiki Yacht Club on the island of Oahu in 86 days, 10 hours, 5 minutes and 56 seconds to break Roz Savage’s 2008 record of 100 days. The row was fraught with a series of mental and physical challenges, including illness before the start, two capsizes, a shortage of food, and persistent adverse currents and winds, as well as the tragic news that fellow rower Angela Madsen had died during her attempt. She described the voyage as \\"the greatest psychological challenge of my life\\". Other interests=Art installations= Ditton's experience of racing across the Atlantic alone in 2005, formed the basis of her 2006 art installation ‘Absolute Solitude: One Woman, One Boat’ in which she lived on her boat in the courtyard of Chelsea College of Arts, next to the Tate Britain Gallery for 28 days – the same number of days as it took her to sail to the US. Photographer Alain Zimeray was a visitor to the exhibition and inspired by his encounter with Ditton, composed the book ‘Dames de la Mer’ with author Christian Bontzolakis, published by Marines Editions in 2009. Filmmaker Richard Gooderick interviewed Ditton after the exhibition, as part of his series Bluewater which was aired by sailing magazine Yachting World. Ditton joined Craig Revel-Horwood on BBC Radio 4 Midweek with Libby Purves, to discuss the exhibition. =Modeling= Ditton has modeled three times in New York City at charity fashion show event Dressed to Kilt hosted by Sean Connery. In 2006, Ditton modelled for Nicole Romano, who attended the show; in 2007 for Nicole Hanley and in 2010 Ditton and Joan Jett walked down the catwalk wearing designs by Joey D. Both 2007 and 2010 events were attended by Donald Trump. =Writing= In 2012, Ditton was commissioned to write the book 50 Water Adventures To Do Before You Die, which was published by Bloomsbury Publishing in 2014 in English and in 2016 in German under the title 50 ultimative Wasserabenteuer, die man erlebt haben muss. =Film= In 2018, Ditton was featured in an episode of Engage Your Senses, a series of films about women's stories of adventure created by filmmaker Danielle Sellwood. Ditton and Sellwood then went on to document her training rows in a series of three short films. The first of these, Perseverance - California Coast Row, was screened for the Four Seasons Film Festival in London in March 2019.

Prewar life  Zubkova was born on 12 October 1920 to a Russian family in the city of Semyon in the Ryazan district of the Russian SFSR. After completing her seventh grade of school in her home village in 1935 she moved to Korablino, where she studied until graduating from her tenth grade of school in 1938, after which she went on to enter the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, where she was considered one of the top students.  World War II  During her fourth year of university, Zubkova had to pause her studies due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. After initially working in the construction of defensive structures and taking part in air defense watch duty at night, she received word that Marina Raskova was recruiting women for military aviation roles. Raskova met with Zubkova and thought she would make a good navigator for bombers due to her mathematics skills, and was accepted into the women's aviation group in October 1941. She then underwent training at Engel's Military Aviation School, and was heavily moved by her first training flight, having since she had never been in an airplane before. After graduating from navigation training in February 1942 she was appointed as chief of communications of the 587th Bomber Regiment, which arrived at the warfront January 1943 and eventually awarded the guards designation, becoming the 125th Guards Dive Bomber Regiment. Several months after being made chief of communications Zubkova was reappointed to work as a flight navigator. After making her first twelve sorties from April to June 1943 she received her first combat award, the Order of the Red Star. During a mission with Nadezhda Fedutenko on 26 May 1943 their Pe-2 was hit with shrapnel over Krasnodar, seriously injuring her pilot Fedutenko in the back of her head, leaving Zubkova to bring the plane to airfield. In 1944 Zubkova was promoted to the position of squadron navigator, and in mid-March 1945 she was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having tallied 56 sorties, resulting in the destruction of three ammunition depots, three trains, twelve tanks, fifty vehicles, and five machine-gun points. In addition to assisting navigation and bombing targets, Zubkova took high-quality photos showing the results of bombing for reports and reconnaissance of enemy troops; such photos were praised by her superior officers for providing useful information about the state forces on the ground and for the evidence of mission success. By the end of the war she totaled 68 sorties.1977 envelope featuring Zubkova.  Later life  After entering the reserve in September 1945 she returned to her studied at Moscow State University, completing her initial studies in 1948 before moving on to the graduate school of Research Institute of Mechanics. She married a navigator from another aviation regiment, Yevgeny Nedugov, and gave birth to their daughter Yelena in 1947. She died on 13 November 1950 and was buried in the Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow.

Life=Before 1849= He was the son of the Grand Duke's inspector Luigi Giacomo Casamorata, who stayed with the Grand Duke Ferdinando III in exile in Germany.Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Il cavalier Ferdinando Giorgetti, musicista romantico a Firenze, Roma, Società editrice di musicologia, 2015. Already, when he was seven years old, he moved to Florence and studied piano. In 1825, while he was attending law school at the University, he tied a competition for composition at the Accademia di Belle Arti with Ferdinando Giorgetti. At that point, he attempted a career in theater. He composed some ballets, but his attempts to write a comic opera were opposed by the producers, who forced him to instead debut with a dramma, Iginia d'Asti, first seen in Pisa in 1838 but was immediately jeered at in Bologna few months later (see also the section Librettos).Claudio Sartori, Casamorata, Luigi Ferdinando (sub voce), in Enciclopedia dello spettacolo, edited by Silvio d'Amico, executive editor Sandro d'Amico, editor of \\"music theatre\\" section Fedele d'Amico, vol. III: Car-Daf, Roma, Le Maschere, 1954, new edition Roma, Unedi, 1975, p. 155. There is information regarding two other attempts at dramas, of which there remains no trace. After his theatrical fiasco, he finished his studies in Law (his signed \\"Avv. Casamorata\\" for his entire life), but he never abandoned music; however, he became better known as a critic than as a composer. He collaborated with the following publications: \\"Gazzetta musicale di Milano\\", \\"La Patria\\", \\"Il Nazionale\\", and \\"Il Costituzionale\\", alternating his writing regarding music with political pamphlets. =The delusion of the Risorgimento= He participated in the uprising in 1848, but when the Grand Duke Leopoldo II returned to the throne, after the uprising, in 1849 his beliefs were disillusioned and from that moment on, he abandoned being active in the revolt. In this atmosphere of disillusion, he started to alternate journalism with some public administrative duties: he was part of the Board of Directors of the Railroad in Livorno,Sergio Lattes, Casamorata, Luigi Ferdinando (sub voce), in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Second Edition, edited by Stanley Sadie, executive editor John Tyrrell, vol. 5: Canon to Classic rock, London, Macmillan, 2001–2002, p. 227. was gonfalonier in Fiesole, and town counselor/representative in Florence.Clara Gabanizza, Casamorata, Luigi Ferdinando (sub voce), in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. 21, Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1978, available on-line at Treccani.it (It) =Characteristics as a critic= He was a very traditionalist critic, linked to formalist ideals. He was convinced that the main scope of music was to imitate nature, and many times he would go into a detailed description of technical cerebral aspects. Two of his most famous reviews were those of the debut of Macbeth by Verdi at the Pergola in 1847 (a very long review that was published in the Gazzetta musicale di Milano between 11 April and 2 June 1847), in which he judged the music as pleasant, but defined the libretto as a sequel of \\"a great deal of rubbish\\";David Rosen, Andrew Porter (ed.), Verdi's 'Macbeth'. A Sourcebook, New York-London, Norton, 1984; Bianca Maria Antolini, La stampa periodica dell'Ottocento come fonte per la ricerca musicologica: il \\"Répertoire International de la Presse Musicale\\", in \\"Rivista italiana di Musicologia\\", XXVI/2 (1991), Lucca, LIM, 1991, pp. 347–385; Marco Beghelli, La retorica del rituale nel melodramma ottocentesco, Torino, EDT, 2003, p. 100 ssgg.; Eduardo Rescigno, Vivaverdi.

See Gloria Staffieri, Firenze, Teatro della Pergola: materiali per una storia dell'orchestra (dagli anni Venti dell'Ottocento all'Unità d'Italia), in Studi verdiani, 16 (2002), Parma, Istituto di Studi Verdiani, 2002, pp. 97–136:111. =The debate regarding sacred music= He actively participated in the debate regarding the esthetics of sacred music, inaugurated by the Cecilian Movement (with which he actively collaborated in the writing of the Manifest of Sacred Music in 1877Fabio Bisogni, Casamorata, Luigi Ferdinando (sub voce), in Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, edited by Ludwig Finscher, serie I: Personenteil, vol. 4: Cam- Cou, Kassel-Basel-London-New York-Praha, Bärenreiter/Stuttgart-Weimar, Metzler, 2000, columns 333–335.). At the beginning he was a permissive and interested observer of all types of church music, but over time he became harsher, almost to the point of intransigence. In fact, he defined the Stabat Mater by Rossini as \\"un-religious\\". =The promotion of instrumental music= Another area that he favored was the promotion of instrumental music, especially German instrumental music, in Italy. He organized concerts for quartets and symphonies in the large concert halls in his villa located in Via delle Pinzochere (near Santa Croce). He also founded an association for wind instruments, the Società artistico-musicale degli strumenti a fiato, in 1864.Claudio Paradiso (ed.), Teodulo Mabellini. Il protagonista dell'Ottocento musicale toscano, Pistoia, Brigata del Leoncino, 2005. In addition, he sought to organize stable orchestras and teatri scuola (theater schools) in Florence. In fact, his articles inspired the Philharmonic Association in Florence (from 1859 Teodulo Mabellini was the orchestral director) to perform the works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Wagner, Gounod and Meyerbeer.Beethoven's symphonies had no florentine performances before 1859, cfr. Paolo Paolini, Beethoven a Firenze nell'Ottocento, in Nuova rivista musicale italiana, V/5 (1971) e V/6 (1971), Torino, ERI, 1971, pp. 753–787 and pp. 973–1002. Casamorata and Mabellini took part in Italian diffusion of Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms, cfr. Mila De Santis, La ricezione di Brahms e Schumann a Firenze. Prime indagini (1840–1880), in Schumann, Brahms e l'Italia. Convegno internazionale, Roma, 4–5 novembre 1999, Roma, Accademia dei Lincei, 2001, pp. 197–223. =Conservatory of Florence and the fame of the 60s and 70s= His activities and dedication brought him fame and national respect, and in 1859 he was requested to organize Florence music school together with Abramo Basevi and Girolamo Alessandro Biaggi. In 1862, he helped found what is now the Conservatory of Florence, and became the first director of the school, which was a title he held until his death. Thanks to this role, he became a sort of international authority on the history of Italian music: he celebrated for the entire decade of the 1870s concerts that were organized and held in Florence, which attracted artists such as Franz Liszt; talented composers dedicated pieces of music to him (Ferruccio Busoni dedicated l'op. 21 to him in 1880); publishers called him to revise scores (for example, Giovanni Gualberto Guidi employed him for the publication of the Stabat Mater by Pergolesi in 1877); and his experience was highly sought for the study of Italian operas (in 1874 the Conservatory of Paris turned to him in order to attribute an alleged Cimarosa's opera).Gazzetta d'Italia, 4 luglio 1874, Firenze, Tipografia della Gazzetta d'Italia, 1874. Cfr. He also wrote for the European Encyclopedia (starting in 1877 he collaborated with Arthur Pougin in order to update the Biographie universelle of François-Joseph Fétis. He handled the biographies of Tuscan artists. =Collectionist and expert of antique music= His fame was solidified when he found the Codice Squarcialupi in the Laurentian Library. From that moment on, he was also considered to be an expert of antique music. He wrote papers about people such as Francesco Nigetti (the inventor of the cembalo a cinque tastiere) and Father Mauro dei Servi di Maria (theorist of the sixteen-hundreds). He curated manuscript editions, collected antique instruments, and compiled papers about out-of-date aspects of performance customs. At his death, he left his own library and his instruments to the Conservatory of Florence.Casamorata, Luigi Ferdinando (sub voce), in Dizionario enciclopedico universale della musica e dei musicisti, edited by Alberto Basso, serie II: Le biografie, vol. 2: BUS-FOX, Torino, UTET, 1985, p. 132. Today, the donated instruments are preserved in the Museum of Musical Instruments in the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence.Some instruments are in Europeana catalogue viola d'amore, salterio, chitarra battente, ribeca Letter of Luigi Ferdinando Casamorata to Giovanni Ricordi Works and sources In addition to three theatrical operas that were unsuccessful, he composed a couple of cantatas, some ballets, instrumental music (a concerto for flute, one for clarinet, 4 symphonies, 2 overtures), various works for chamber music (including the reworked version of themes by Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Meyerbeer and Hummel), many works for theory and study (a manual of harmony which was published in Florence, a course for voice which remains only handwritten, a paper regarding musical notation which has been lost, a paper on the construction of the organ which did not oppose the use of electricity, and a historical overview of theatrical costumes), e molta musica sacra, di cui circa 14 messe, molte però rimaste inedite., as well as a lot of sacred music, of which about 14 masses, which, however, remain unedited. =Autographs= His autographs of sacred music are found in the Archive of the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata; however, because specific studies have not been carried out, the exact number of pieces is unknown. Other autographs are found in the following locations: *At the Conservatory of Naples: **a mass for three voices from 1839 **a Magnificat dated 1842 **a mass for three voices dated 1844 **the second quartet for strings from 1858 **a symphony from 1859 **an Ave Maria for four voices from 1871 **two antiphons for four voices dated 1878 *At the Conservatory of Florence (some are also digitalized): **a quartet for pianoforte, clarinet, horn and bassoon (printed by Boosey); **a Benedicta dated March 5, 1869 *At the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna: **an Absolve Domine, maybe owned by Masseangelo Masseangeli, dated September 11, 1877 =Manuscript copies=Copies in Florence The institution that preserves the greatest number of manuscript copies of Casamorata's works is the Conservatory of Florence: *the cantata that won the competition in 1825 *a cantata, Beatrice, for the florentine celebration of Dante in 1865 *the instrumental variations on the themes of Hummel, Meyerbeer, Bellini, Donizetti and Hummel *concerts for flute and clarinet *some pieces for oboe, with piano accompaniment or orchestra *exercises for organ dated 1874 *pieces that survived of his ballets *chamber music (at least four quartets and one trio) *orchestral pieces (preludes, the ouverture op. 2, symphony n. 3) *dramatic studies (recitives and cavatine, dated from 1836 and 1866) *collections of pieces by other celebrated composers that Casamorata arranged (or had arranged) for students of the conservatory *a patriotic song \\"alla Patria e al Re\\" *few religious pieces (a mass and some Armonie religiose to the text of Pietro Metastasio). The current state of research does not permit us to establish that these copies are autographs with certainty, although we can hypothesize a consistent number, since the number of compositions carried out from the copies conforms with most of the noted works by Casamorata. Other copies Out of Florence, the spread of manuscripts of Casamorata was because of his sacred music. The lack of specific research regarding the musical possessions of Italian parishes doesn’t allow for the affirmation of how extensive the spread of his sacred works is. However, the presence of a collection of his psalms in Turin (Biblioteca del Capitolo Metropolitano), of an Ave Maria in Naples, a Salve Regina in PistoiaUmberto Pineschi, Inventario Archivio Capitolare Pistoia Biblioteca Musicale, unpublished text, available in pdf format the website of Pistoia's Archive of the Chapter (It): more info on this page and in the Pistoia's section in Website of Musical Documentation Center of Tuscany. and some masses in the archive of the Sant'Antimo Church in Piombino, discovered by Musical Documentation Center of Tuscany, would indicate that the spread of his works is very large. =Printed editions= He published in Florence (especially with Genesio Venturini and Angiolo Lucherini), Milan (with Giovanni Canti and Ricordi)Casamorata published some extracts with Ricordi, the only that have survived, of the opera Iginia d'Asti, in a printed copy dedicated to his friend Nicola Benvenuti, maestro di cappella in Pisa. See pages of this extracts in Italian Library System website: item 1, item 2, item 3, item 4 and also with Parisian (Delanchy) and London-based publishers (Boosey). Many of his sacred compositions circulate in well-known magazines. The Palatina Library in Parma has the first edition (around 1831) of the Variazioni per pianoforte on a theme from Sonnambula by Bellini, printed by Artaria (Milan) and Lucherini (Florence), work that was published in the variation for harp by Ricordi. Other printed editions have been found at the Conservatory of Florence (the institution that preserves the greatest number), the Conservatory in Milan and in Brescia, the National Library of Florence, the Accademia di Santa Cecilia di Roma, the Accademia Filarmonica and the Museo Internazionale e Biblioteca della Musica di Bologna, and the Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana di Venezia. =Librettos= The libretto of Iginia d'Asti, the only opera of his that exists today, is preserved in two versions: published by the printer named Pieraccini from Pisa following the first performance, and the other published by Della Volpe al Sassi, following the fiasco in Bologna. Both are dated 1838 (see the paragraph Before 1849). The version by Pieraccini is at the National Library in Florence, at the Cini Foundation in Venice, and at the Palatina Library in Parma. The version by Della Volpe is at the Cini Foundation, at the Archiginnasio and the Conservatory of Bologna, at the Biblioteca Comunale Centrale of Milan, at the Saffi Library in Forlì, at the Library of Ravenna and at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich. =Modern editions= The Paideia publishers of Brescia and Bärenreiter of Kassel printed one of his complete masses, Messa completa, in 1981 Letters One of his letters to Ricordi from 1845 is preserved at the French National Library. Recordings  *In July 1997, at the Brüdernkirche in Braunschweig, the organist Hans-Dieter Karras recorded, together with other pieces, a Complete Mass for organ by Casamorata for the recording label Prospect. *In 2003, the organist Klemens Schnorr performed the same mass (together with other pieces) on the organ of the Cattedrale di Saragozza for a CD distributed by the recording label Motette (Harmonia Mundi) in 2006. *In November 2014, in the Basilica di San Lorenzo in Florence, the organists Antonio Tronci, Filippo Tronci and Gabriele Giacomelli performed a concert for organ composed in Florence from XVIth century to XIXth century, which also included two pieces by Casamorata. The concert was recorded and distributed as a CD by the recording label named Tactus in 2015. Further reading *Giovanni Masutto, I maestri di musica italiani nel secolo XIX.

Gameplay and plot The Red Strings Club is an adventure game set in a cyberpunk world. In this world, devices implanted in humans have become commonplace as a way to alter one's physical features and mental functions; a corporation called Supercontinent Ltd., led by a mysterious CEO, is at the forefront of this human implant industry. The game itself centers around three main (playable) characters: Brandeis, an enhanced human and \\"freelance hacker\\"; Donovan, an implantless human and owner of The Red Strings Club; and Akara-184, an android formerly owned by Supercontinent to administer implant surgery to customers and who possesses advanced empathy capabilities. Donovan, Brandeis, and Akara-184 are working together to stop Supercontinent from releasing a system known as Social Psyche Welfare, which alters the minds of all implanted humans in order to eliminate emotions such as anger and depression; Donovan's interactions with Akara-184 and employees of Supercontinent encourages the player to consider the role of and extent to which technology should alter one's humanity. The Red Strings Club utilizes several different styles of gameplay throughout with each of its playable characters. The bulk of the game involves Donovan mixing different types of drinks in order to bring out certain emotions in his bar's patrons, which allows him to probe them for information; however, some emotional states are more volatile than others, running the risk of cutting the conversation short and missing out on certain intelligence that could have been collected. At the end of each encounter, Akara-184 will test Donovan on each character's motivations and feelings; if he guesses most of the questions correctly, he receives an item that can enhance his drinks (and, in one instance, gains access to a new character). While playing as Akara-184 within a Supercontinent Ltd. facility, the player crafts different sets of implants made of biomass via pottery wheel that are to be inserted in clients, based on what will best help their careers or desires. Towards the end of this section of the game, the player inserts implants for Supercontinent executives, however, are encouraged by a human hacker intruder (who is associated with Brandeis), to assign them specially-designed implants that will make them less corporately- focused; the implants that the player chooses to insert will have an effect on these executives later on in the game. At the end of the game, as Brandeis, the player infiltrates Supercontinent Ltd. headquarters in order to stop the SPW program, but needs to go through several bureaucratic hoops in order to do so; in order to achieve his goal, Brandeis uses one of his implants to impersonate Supercontinent executives and glean the information needed to access restricted files and run a virus to shut down Social Psyche Welfare. Just before succeeding, though, Brandeis is surrounded by Akara and several clones of them - it is here that Akara reveals that they are an AI of uncertain origin that's slowly been manipulating human technological process via the internet for years, and intends to launch the SPW as a sort of final act. After this encounter, Brandeis is shot by Supercontinent security forces and falls out of Supercontinent's skyscraper to his demise, as seen in the beginning cutscene of the game; it is also here that it's revealed that Brandeis and Donovan are in love with each other. Development and release The Red Strings Club was developed by Deconstructeam. The game was announced in October 2017. The game was published by Devolver Digital and released for Windows, macOS and Linux on 22 January 2018. It was released on Nintendo Switch in March 2019. Reception The Red Strings Club received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics according to review aggregator Metacritic. The Spanish edition of Edge magazine gave it a 9/10. =Awards= The game won the award for \\"Best National Development\\" at the Titanium Awards 2018, whereas its other nomination was for \\"Best Indie Game\\". Controversy One of the characters Donovan encounters at The Red Strings Club is a woman named Larissa, a sensual marketing director for Supercontinent. Though not stated during this sequence, it is later revealed during Brandeis' section that Larissa is transgender; this is discovered when, in order to access an engineer's files, it becomes clear that the password is Larissa's \\"deadname\\" (name given at birth). In a Vice article, Danielle Riendeau criticizes the decision of Devolver Digital to reveal Larissa's gender identity via use of deadnaming, which is considered offensive, or even violent. Paula Ruiz, a developer of The Red Strings Club who is transgender, responded to Riendeau in defense of the decision, stating \\"[w]e agree it's important to talk about all this stuff and denounce it, but it's also important to look at all angles of a story... Deadnaming sucks, but it's also a part of trans people's realities, and the game tries to capture that bit too, maybe not in the depth it should according to you, but at no moment was its use frivolous.\\" See also * VA-11 HALL-A, another cyberpunk adventure game that involves bartending and mixing drinks * Do Not Feed the Monkeys * Gris ReferencesExternal links * 2018 video games Adventure games Cyberpunk video games Devolver Digital games GameMaker Studio games LGBT-related video games Linux games MacOS games Single-player video games Video games developed in Spain Windows games ","title":"The Red Strings Club"},{"id":"56377016","text":"Everysight Ltd. is an Israeli technology company established in 2014 as a spinoff of Elbit Systems. Everysight develops smartglasses based on augmented reality technology for the civilian market. The company's main product is Raptor smartglasses. History=Early years= Everysight's first generation projection system was developed in 2004. This version was a small micro-HUD, which used a staged beam combiner integrated within a panel window device located in front of the user's eye. This allowed the user to view the surroundings while looking at real-time information, projected from the combiners, and perceived as an augmented reality graphic layer floating in front of the user. An eMagin OLED display component enabled users to view the projected information even in full sunlight. The display system was connected by cable to a Sony U subnotebook running Windows XP, which interfaced wirelessly with a variety of ANT+ sensors while running custom software designed for cycling and skiing. = 2006–2007 – 2nd generation = The team developed the second generation of smartglasses based on the free space principle, with an off-axis non-forming exit pupil, whereby the glasses' lenses themselves are used as a beam combiner in such a way that the projected light can return to the user's eye. Other than the lens itself, there is no additional element in front of the eye, preventing sight obstruction and increasing eye safety. Additionally, the lenses featured a spherical structure delivering built-in correction for optical distortions. The optical solution combined the use of a mini OLED display with significantly low power consumption. The optical solution proved to perform with extremely high efficiency while enabling a high-contrast display that remained visible even in full sunlight. The model was powered by a specially adapted, PDA-like computer running Windows CE, which was connected to the glasses by cable and ran various software apps. The computer included a wireless interface, which enabled connection to a cellular network via smartphone, as well as a wide range of sensors (such as GPS, heart rate belt, speed sensor, cadence sensor, etc.). = 2008–2010 – 3rd generation = The team developed their third generation smartglasses, which included an integrated microcomputer with a graphics processor, line of sight system, camera, audio system and memory storage. The computer was based on dedicated low power Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware that could wirelessly interface with smartphones serving as a gateway to the internet. = 2010–2012 – 4th generation = The team developed the fourth generation smartglasses that included a patented minimized optical solution also based on the principle of projection from the lens itself. This optical solution enabled significant reduction of the frames in terms of both dimensions and weight. These glasses included aspheric lenses, which are compatible with plastic materials and allow for injection molding. The smaller, redesigned lens had a spherical structure which included built-in correction for optical distortions. This new optical solution was also proved to perform with high optical efficiency, enabling the integration of an OLED display for use and viewing of information outdoors, in full sunlight. = 2013–2017 – 5th generation = Raptor smartglasses is intended for outdoor athletes (road cyclists and mountain bikers). Raptor smartglasses enable users to see real-time graphic information projected directly from the lens, which appears as an augmented reality layer superimposed over the scene. This information includes physiological data, map navigation, training options, and location and media sharing.Everysight to sell Raptor AR smartglasses for cyclists The 5th generation of the smartglasses which included an even smaller, Android OS-based computer incorporated into the glasses, as well as a camera, memory storage, audio system, voice commands, wireless interfaces (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth & ANT+), touchpad, and batteries. These glasses used lenses developed for the fourth generation. As part of the development process, the glasses transitioned to mass production, with injection molding production lines opened for both the plastic lenses and the frames.

ASL is a rich, complex language on par with spoken languages, and employs rules of phonology, syntax, morphology, etc. using manual/visual modes of communication, where spoken languages rely on the oral/aural modes of communication. ASL is used by deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the North American continent, often as their primary language. Language interpretation is defined by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as the following: \\"Rendering a spoken or signed message into another spoken or signed language, preserving the register and meaning of the source language content.\\" ASL interpreters must understand the subject matter at hand, be able to reliably and fluently transmit the information without bias, and be accustomed to navigating any kind of social situation. ASL interpreting is a multifaceted job, requiring management of linguistic, interpersonal, and environmental issues. Training for ASL interpreters is highly varied, as are the education and certifications required for employment. Career and medical support for ASL interpreters has become a topic of concern and study in the last several years, in response to a high rate of interpreter burnout that has led to a shortage of ASL interpreters across the United States.  The role of ASL interpreters  ASL interpreters work in a large variety of environments, including medical, legal, educational, mental health, vocational, and other environments. Interpreting is often viewed as a practice profession (other examples include law, teaching, counseling, medicine, etc.), which requires careful judgement of interpersonal and environmental factors as well as expertise in the skills of the profession itself.Marschark, M., Peterson, R., & Winston, E.(Eds.), Sign Language Interpreting and Interpreter Education: Directions for Research and Practice. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 26 Apr. 2018, from http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof/9780195176940.001.0001/acprof-9780195176940. The interpreter must be able to understand the concepts they are seeing and hearing, perform the mental translation, and communicate them effectively in the second language. Although the interpreter usually intends to be in the background of the conversation and not contribute beyond interpretation, overcoming differences between the languages often requires them to make judgements which might alter the flow of communication. As with any two languages, ASL and English do not have a one-to-one word correspondence, meaning interpreters cannot simply translate word-for-word. They must determine how to effectively communicate what one interlocutor means, rather than strictly what they say, to the other. Sometimes these judgement calls and various linguistic barriers cause the interpreters to affect the flow of conversation. For example: if a medical professional asks a patient if they are \\"sexually active,\\" the interpretation can become complicated, because while the English phrase makes no overt reference to a partner or a specific act, in ASL it is very difficult to discuss sexual activity without reference to a partner or act. Consequently, the interpretation from English to ASL may result in the patient responding in dialogue rather than with the \\"yes/no\\" answer that the doctor might be expecting. Often, interpreters must manage situations in which the interlocuters' comments include connotations that may be lost on the other party, and the interpreter is left with the decision of how to convey those connotations, or whether they even have the authority to do so. For example, a doctor may ask an interpreter to relay to the patient, \\"There is nothing more we can do for you. We're going to make you as comfortable as we can.\\" While the literal meaning of the expression is easily conveyed, the interpreter would be aware that the euphemistic nature of this phrase in English might be lost on the deaf patient. Thus, the interpreter would put in the position of bluntly telling the patient that they are going to die. In a situation such as this, the interpreter may elect to discuss the interpretive difficulty with the doctor and allow the doctor the opportunity to communicate with the patient more directly and less euphemistically. The interpreter must not only be able to recognize the linguistic barrier in this situation, but also must be aware of the interpersonal factors involved in the situation and the limitations of their role.  Challenges for the ASL interpreter  Degree programs in ASL Interpreting are available at colleges, universities, and technical schools across the country, ranging from associate degrees to master's degrees. In addition, interpreters work with mentors, attend workshops, and get certifications to become more adept, gain experience, and open additional career opportunities. Other interpreters are children of Deaf adults (CODAs) and are typically exposed to ASL and Deaf culture at a young age, giving them an advantage over later learners. In recent years, much research has gone into discerning whether ASL interpreters have access to adequate, specialized, real-world training and career support systems to ensure success and protect against interpreter burnout. Many studies note interpreter reports of frustration with training that proved inadequate to deal with real-world problems, and a lack of professional support.Robyn K. Dean, Robert Q Pollard; Application of Demand-Control Theory to Sign Language Interpreting: Implications for Stress and Interpreter Training, The Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education, Volume 6, Issue 1, 1 January 2001, Pages 1–14, A variety of factors contribute to stress for the interpreter: variable working conditions, expectations, and even understanding of the interpreter's role and responsibilities can all play a part. Often, interpreters are party to emotional or traumatizing experiences because they are needed to interpret in those situations, with no outlet for dealing with their internal reactions to them. Interpreters also experience physical stress, often in the form of cumulative trauma disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome that may require them to take time off work to recuperate. Interpreting ASL as a profession carries a variety of demands. Robyn Dean and Robert Pollard, in applying control-demand theory to the profession, identify four categories of demands: * Linguistic Demand—Demands that are directly or indirectly related to language itself. These include the clarity with which the interlocutors speak or sign, the interlocutor's language fluency, use of technical vocabulary, voice volume, etc. * Environmental Demand—Demands that are related to the setting of the interpretation. These include sight lines, background noise, lighting quality, visual distractions, seating arrangements, odors, etc. * Interpersonal Demand—Demands that are related to the interaction of the interlocutors, as well as other people nearby. These include power and authority dynamics between the interlocutors, each person's understanding of the role of the interpreter, turn-taking, communication directed to the interpreter, etc. * Intrapersonal Demand—Demands that relate to the interpreter themselves, either physically or psychologically. These include vicarious reactions, safety concerns, doubts about their performance, isolation, liability concerns, etc. The relative lack of interpreter post- graduate training does little to prepare interpreters to deal with the varied demands above, which each may be prominent depending each particular interpreting assignment. Heller et al. (1986), Swartz (1999), and Watson (1987) (cited in Dean and Pollard 2001) all agree that this environment is a large contributor to interpreter burnout and, by extension, the current shortage of ASL interpreters in the United States. However, steps are being taken by several entities, including the Conference of Interpreter Trainers (CIT) and the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID), to create and adopt standards by which training programs can be judged. Laurie Swabey and Karen Malcolm's book In Our Hands: Educating Healthcare Interpreters (2012) discusses the specific difficulties that interpreters face in medical fields. The book covers issues that arise in mental health interpreting, the risks of vicarious trauma, explorations of authentic interactions to aid in discourse training, etc.Swabey, A. & Malcolm, Karen. In Our Hands: Educating Healthcare Interpreters. Washington: Gallaudet University Press, 2012. Project MUSE, Topics in Signed Language Interpreting: Theory and Practice, edited by Terry Janzen (2005), covers, among other things, the issues that arise with simultaneous interpretation, ethics and professionalism as they relate to interpreting, and a Deaf community perspective on best practices for interpreters. Still, a cohesive standard for postgraduate training and career support for ASL interpreters has yet to materialize.

Her father worked as a building contractor, and was frequently in financial difficulties. He died in 1898, when many of her younger siblings were still children. Blunt trained as a nurse after leaving school, with the initial intention of becoming a medical missionary.

Page – who was almost five years her junior – soon began courting her, and in 1904 convinced her to become the matron at his new private hospital in Grafton.Moorhouse (2001), p. 48. They married in Sydney on 18 September 1906, and would have five children together – Mary (b. 1909), Earle Jr. (b. 1910), Donald (b. 1912), Iven (b. 1914), and Douglas (b. 1916).Australia's Prime Ministers / Fast facts: Earle Page, National Archives of Australia. Retrieved 29 January 2018. Public life Page's husband was elected to federal parliament in 1919, and in 1921 became the leader of the fledgling Country Party. They moved their primary residence from Grafton to Sydney, which gave her the chance to become more socially and politically active.Australia's PMs > Earle Page > Ethel Page, National Archives of Australia. Retrieved 21 January 2018. She was the founder of the Women's Country Club, a social club for women visiting Sydney from country towns. She was involved in the Feminist Club of New South Wales, but later left to become a founding member of the more activist United Associations of Women, serving on its executive. Page largely shared her husband's political views, and in 1923 was elected as the inaugural president of the Women's Country Party. It was initially an independent organisation modelled on the Australian Women's National League, but was later integrated into the main party. She subsequently represented the women's section on the Country Party's state executive for seven years.Moorhouse (2001), p. 49. Ethel and Earle Page Page was a delegate to national conferences of the Country Women's Association (CWA) and the National Council of Women, and served as a state vice-president of the latter. In the CWA, she was one of the leaders of a faction that advocated the open endorsement of Country Party policies; this was somewhat controversial given the organisation's nominal nonpartisan nature. Page occasionally wrote articles for The Land, a newspaper focusing on rural matters. In 1924, apparently as a surrogate for her husband, she became a one-third owner of the Sunraysia Daily, the main newspaper in Mildura, Victoria; her co-owners were Robert Elliott and Percy Stewart. She served as a director of its holding company until 1932, when she sold her shares to Elliott. In 1933, Page's oldest son Earle Jr. was killed by a lightning strike, aged 22. Her husband wrote in his memoirs: \\"when my wife heard the news that her son would return no more, a brain stroke affecting the movements of her hands descended on her, and ever after, until her death twenty-five years later, affected her [...] despite this affliction, she gallantly continued to play her usual active part in public\\".Moorhouse (2001), p. 226. Prior to the 1937 federal election, Page made a 15-minute speech that was broadcast on ABC Radio National, an attempt to appeal to women voters.Mrs. Earle Page On The Air, The Daily Examiner, 19 October 1937. Despite her husband's long career in politics, she never lived in the national capital, generally only visiting for the state opening of parliament. Her husband stayed at the Hotel Canberra during parliamentary sittings, as was common at the time.Australia's PMs > Earle Page > After office, National Archives of Australia.

However, she had previously appeared at a number of public functions during her husband's numerous stints as acting prime minister. Page died at Grafton Base Hospital on 27 May 1958, aged 82, after several years of ill health.Death Of Lady Page After Long Illness, The Canberra Times, 27 May 1958.

It is a wooden bridge with an iron handrail, painted in different colors, each one representing people of different ethnic groups holding hands. It was inaugurated during the Salon Urbain de Douala en 2007. The artwork The Passerelle de Bessengue is a wooden bridge with an iron handrail, painted in different colors, each one representing people of different ethnic groups holding hands. La Passerelle was designed by the Cameroonian artist Alioum Moussa. It was initially conceived as a cooperation development project funded by the Institut Régional de Coopération-Développement d’Alsace (Ircod-Alsace), the Municipality of Douala I, and doual’art. As project coordinator, doual’art ran a community-based approach involving the local Development Community of Bessengue-Akwa (CDBA) from the conceptualization phase to the project production. leftDuring the process, an artistic contest was organized in order to provide La Passerelle with aesthetical features. On five projects submitted, the selection fell on Alioum Moussa. His proposal aroused among the community a critical discussion and self-reflection about historical conflicts among autochthonous and non-native populations. The success of the project by Moussa was to create a link between art and community experiences, documenting shared intentions to promote and pursue a peaceful collaboration for future generations. La Passerelle was officially inaugurated during the SUD 2007 and restored two times. In 2009, Malika Ouedraogo and Cecile Demessine repainted the handrail. In the occasion of the SUD 2013, the Municipality of Douala funded the replacement of a handrail side and some broken wood planches. La Passerelle has disclosed the block 1 of Bessengue to one of the busiest roads of Douala, facilitating the circulation of people, vehicles, and the provision of public services. Its position at the entrance of the neighborhood has contributed to create a square between La Passerelle and the first houses. This area, commonly known as Vallée Bessengue, has become an important landmark for children, young people and women who meet there to play, to date and to shop, surrounded by other art installations.

She and Nina Boyle wrote for \\"The Vote\\", where they argued against the injustices of a male-dominated legal system. Women victims needed to be cared for by women police and courts should realise that they could not expect women to give evidence in a court that was a room full of men. Watson decided to document what she saw as unfair practise. She was employed as the Court correspondent for \\"The Vote\\" and she recorded the crimes or rape, sexual assault and incest ironically under the title of \\"The Protected Sex\\". She catalogued the sentences given to the perpetrators noting that prostitutes could get nine months for approaching clients whereas a man guilty of grievously harming a woman might get a third of the sentence. She started this in 1912 and continued for three years to compare the sentences with those handed down for loss or damage to property. Boyle and Watson went to Marlborough Street Police Court in 1914 and made a more militant protest. Watson was amongst other who were arrested for chaining themselves to the gates.

She was built by Hawthorn Leslie in 1911–1912. She served throughout the First World War, forming part of the Grand Fleet until 1916 and taking part in the Battle of Jutland. Later in the war she served in the English Channel to protect merchant shipping against attacks by German U-boats. Christopher was sold for scrap in May 1921. Construction and design Christopher was one of three s ordered by the British Admiralty from the Hawthorn Leslie shipyard under the 1911–1912 shipbuilding programme, with a total of 20 Acastas (12, including Christopher to the standard Admiralty design and eight more as builder's specials). The Acastas were larger and more powerful than the s ordered under the previous year's programme. Greater speed was wanted to match large fast destroyers building for foreign navies, while a larger radius of action was desired. The destroyers built to the Admiralty standard design were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was Normal and Deep load. Four Yarrow water-tube boilers fed steam to Parsons steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated to giving a design speed of . Three funnels were fitted. The ship had an endurance of at . Armament consisted of three guns mounted on the ship's centreline, with one forward and two aft, and two torpedo tubes. Two reload torpedoes were carried. The ship had a crew of 73 officers and ratings. One of Christophers 4-inch guns was modified in 1916 to a high-angle mounting for anti-aircraft fire. This gun, together with both torpedo tubes, were removed in April 1918 to accommodate depth charges and paravanes. Christopher was laid down at Hawthorn Leslie's Hebburn shipyard on 16 October 1911, and was launched on 28 August 1912. In 1913 the Admiralty decided to reclassify the Royal Navy's destroyers into alphabetical classes, with the Acasta class becoming the K class. New names were allocated to the ships of the K class, with the name Kite being reserved for Christopher, but the ships were not renamed. Christopher reached a speed of during sea trials. She was completed in November 1912. Service On commissioning, Christopher joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. At the outbreak of the First World War, Christopher, along with the rest of the 4th Flotilla, joined the newly established Grand Fleet, based at Scapa Flow. In February 1915, Christopher was one of a number of Grand Fleet destroyers ordered to escort merchant ships carrying troops of the 1st Canadian Division from Avonmouth to St Nazaire. Although the destroyers failed to rendezvous with the convoy, it reached France without any losses On 13 February , , and Christopher were putting into Barrow harbour to refuel on the way back to Scotland, when they were suddenly signalled to turn away to avoid a ship leaving the harbour. Owl, Contest and Christopher ran aground while attempting to turn in the narrow approach channel, remaining aground until the next day. Christopher was repaired on the Clyde. On 8 August 1915 Christopher was on patrol on the Moray Forth when the steamer was attacked by the German submarine . Christopher, responding to reports of the attack, reached the incident as Glenravel was sinking, and then spotted a submarine in the vicinity of another merchant ship, the Swedish . Christopher opened fire on the submarine, which dived away, but the destroyer could not stop Malmland being sunk by U-17. On 23 September Christopher collided with the armed boarding steamer , damaging the destroyer. On 3 January 1916 Christopher and Contest set out from Scapa to meet up with battleship , on passage from Belfast, and escort her into Scapa. Poor weather forced the two destroyers to seek shelter at Stornoway, however, and Africa reached Scapa without escort. Christopher was present at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May/1 June 1916. She was one of four destroyers (together with , and ) assigned to escort the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron. Although Shark was sunk and Acasta badly damaged in a clash with German light cruisers and torpedo boats, Christopher, which fired 30 shells in the battle, was undamaged, with none of her crew injured. In July 1916, the 4th Flotilla left the Grand Fleet, moving to the Humber to counter German minelayers and to protect British minesweepers in the North Sea. The flotilla, including Christopher, moved again to Portsmouth in November that year. The 4th Flotilla was transferred to Devonport in spring 1917. Regular convoy operations on the North Atlantic route began in July 1917, with the destroyers of the 4th Flotilla being used as escorts to escort incoming convoys through the dangerous Western Approaches. At the end of the war, all pre-war destroyers were quickly withdrawn from active service, and Christopher was sold for scrap on 9 May 1921.

Subsequently, he initiated the studies on zebrafish cardiac development as a Helen Hay Whitney postdoctoral fellow with Mark Fishman at the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston). =Scientific interests= Together with the many students and postdocs in his laboratory, Stainier helped pioneer the use of the zebrafish model to study a wide range of questions pertaining to vertebrate organ development and function, and has published extensively. His forward genetic analyses of heart development revealed the unexpected role of several signaling pathways including sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling and the discovery of the long-elusive sphingosine 1-phosphate transporter. Additional genetic screens led to the elucidation of transcriptional networks regulating endoderm formation and endothelial cell specification as well as extracellular signals regulating liver induction. He pushed the frontiers of in vivo microscopy to reveal new insights into cardiac valve formation and cardiac trabeculation, and used cellular approaches to gain a detailed understanding of these processes. Stainier developed and used single-cell analyses to provide the first in vivo demonstration of the hemangioblast, a formerly hypothetical cell that gives rise to both endothelial and blood cells, as well as the discovery of a new mode of blood vessel formation. His studies on gut looping morphogenesis revealed the importance of tissue-level physical forces in shaping organs, and his studies on gut lumen formation revealed the importance of fluid flow in this process. He developed a number of cell ablation models that allowed him and others to gain new insights into the process of organ regeneration, with potential implications for novel disease therapies. Most recently, he has also made significant contributions to the understanding of genetic compensation.

He later undertook a wide variety of jobs, including police officer, engine driver, steelworker, and farrier, and at some point moved to Sheffield. An active trade unionist, Rolley was elected as chairman of the Sheffield Federated Trades Council when it was reconstituted in 1874, following the Sheffield Outrages.J. Mendelson, W. Owen, S.

He subsequently also served on the Parliamentary Committee of the TUC. Rolley developed an interest in politics. At the 1874 UK general election, he supported Joseph Chamberlain of Liberal Party when he stood unsuccessfully in Sheffield, and some people believed that it was Rolley who had first asked Chamberlain to contest the election in the city. Rolley was elected to the Sheffield School Board in 1876, and in 1883 he was a founder of the Sheffield Labour Electoral Association, which aimed to secure seats for working men at the local and national levels. He hoped to be selected as the Liberal-Labour candidate for Sheffield Attercliffe at the 1885 UK general election, but was not chosen. He was disappointed by this, and although he supported Irish Home Rule, he felt that party members were overly critical of Chamberlain for his opposition to the policy. In 1888, Rolley joined the Conservative Party, stating that \\"the working classes were likely to get as much from the Tories as from the Liberals\\". He was made a full-time agent for the party, serving in this post for the remainder of his career.

Southern Song Dynasty, mid-13th century. Property of the Freer Sackler Gallery. Xianzi (), or Kensu in Japanese, also known as the Shrimp Eater, was a semi-historical Chan/Zen monk, considered to be one of the “scattered sages,” who were deviant or otherwise unusual figures within the Chan tradition. Infamous for his iconoclastic breaking of the taboo on eating meat set forth in the Vinaya Code of monastic rules, the Shrimp Eater appears in several traditional Zen paintings as both a comedic figure that underscores the Zen tradition of humor, as well as an eccentric, enlightened individual.  Sources  Most information on Xianzi comes from the Transmission of the Lamp, a collection of hagiographies (1004-1007 C.E.) intended to highlight the “anti-textualism and iconoclasm of the Chan monks”. Included within this collection of hagiographies are many nontraditional Chan Buddhist figures, such as Xianzi, who never became patriarchs or abbots on their own, but whose stories were still considered vital for the transmission of Chan teachings. Additional information on Xianzi comes from the poems and inscriptions that monks wrote on paintings of him. One such inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Japanese painter Josetsu reads: > edit. Since there is very little hard information on Xianzi other than what is written in the Transmission of the Lamp, inscriptions such as these are important in understanding the context in which he was discussed, the role that he played in Zen teaching, as well as in filling in some of the basic details of his life story.  Biography  Buddhist Patriarch Kensu with Shrimp. Late 17th Century Japan. It is recorded in the Jing-de Era Record that Xianzi lived in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and was a pupil to Dongshan Liangjie 洞山良價, the founder of the Caodong 曹洞, or Sōtō, school of Chan Buddhism. Though he was known to never have taken students of his own or teach the dharma (Sengai), Xianzi was renowned for his eccentricities. Specifically, he was known to catch and eat shrimp, clams, and prawns from nearby lakes and streams, despite the Buddhist prohibition against consuming meat. Paradoxically, Xianzi was said to have attained enlightenment a moment after he had caught a shrimp and was preparing himself to consume it. For this reason, he was understood to be an enlightened individual and carrier of the transmission, rather than a degenerate monk and rule breaker. In addition to his eccentricities regarding the consumption of meat, Xianzi was known as a wanderer, never living in or belonging to an official monastery despite his lineage ties to the founder of one of Chinese preeminent schools of Chan Buddhism. Instead, he preferred to mingle with laypeople, spending most of his days catching his dinner. He did not wear the elaborate robes of a more traditional Chinese monk, instead wearing the same ragged robe during both summer and winter. At night, he slept beneath the paper offerings at the White Horse Temple, much as a homeless would in the modern day. Some have even speculated that he was crazy, although some secondary sources suggest that he was just feigning madness. = Vinaya Code = The Vinaya was the set of rules and principles that governed many Buddhist monastic communities. Among these rules were prohibitions against having sexual intercourse, regulations on begging, and an iron-clad ban on eating meat. Monks who broke these rules were said to have committed “pārājika,” or the eight misbehaviors and were declared “asaṃvāsa,” which means outside of the Buddhist religious community. Those deemed outside of the Buddhist religious community were not excommunicated per se, but rather were seen as deviants who were not representative of the tradition that they espoused. As someone who routinely ate fish, Xianzi would have certainly been considered asaṃvāsa under the Vinaya Code. The very paintings of Xianzi violate the Vinaya Code to a certain degree, because scholarship shows that originally, the code prohibited humor and laughter, believing it to be counterproductive to a monk's serious undertakings. Other parts of the Vinaya Code insist on humility and poverty. The expensive, elaborate robes of high society were frowned on, and monks were supposed to wear the cast-off rags of society. Additionally, in the late 8th century, the Chan master Bozhang recognized the changing dynamics of monastic life, and created the Bozhang qinggui 百丈淸規, which were additional rules for monastic life. These new rules reformed the ways that monks obtained their food, mandating that monks devote part of their time not just to begging for alms, but instead providing some sort of labor, causing monks to work for their food. Many farms were set up alongside monasteries as a result. Although Xianzi did break some basic Vinaya rules, he also upheld others. His dress is simple and although his consumption of meat may have been blasphemous, he did fulfill the responsibility laid out in the Bozhang qinggui of laboring for his food. = Xianzi as a Symbol of Zen Humor = The Shrimp Eater. Hanging scroll with inscription done by the monk-painter Muqi Fachang during mid-13th century China. Humor is thought to be one of the defining elements of Chan/Zen teaching, and that humor is almost certainly reflected in the case of Xianzi. Some argue that Chan/Zen masters used humor as a means of conveying its essential wordless transmission. In a similar way that Mahākāśyapa wordlessly received the transmission of the dharma through Śākyamuni Buddha's flower sermon, so too will those who look upon a humorous Chan/Zen painting wordlessly receive the transmission, provided that they get the joke. Understanding humor requires rigor and training, because humor without full- mindedness is grotesque and meaningless, while full-mindedness without awareness of its limitations is empty. In this way, it is argued that Chan/Zen humor is used to replicate the experience of no-mind that Chan/Zen teachings are based on. Zen humor, as in the case of Xianzi, is typically irreverent and iconoclastic. The paradox of Xianzi is that even though he shamelessly breaks monastic rules by eating meat, that is the way in which he achieved enlightenment. An inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Chinese monk- painter Muqi Fachang 牧溪法常 (ca. 1210-ca. 1279) ~~~~ alludes to this, reading: > .Xie, Kun. The Form of no-Form: Reconstructing Huineng in Two Paintings by > Liang Kai. Order No. 10599033 University of Oregon, 2017 Ann Arbor ProQuest. > 26 Mar. 2018 This kind of irreverence for Buddhist teachings and traditions is repeated in other figures such as the ebullient Budai/Hotei 布袋, known literally as the laughing monk. It is speculated that the reason for Chan/Zen's strong use of humor is that although Chan/Zen Buddhism held itself as being unique for having received the true transmission in an unbroken lineage from Shakyamuni Buddha, in everyday life there were few things that separated Chan/Zen monks from those of other sects. They frequently lived in the same monasteries, abided by the same rules, and read the same sutras. Humor was used to differentiate Chan/Zen from the rest, because it made fun of the very precepts that all of the other schools adhered to so rigorously. By asserting its iconoclastic side, Chan/Zen teachings professed their true knowledge and possession of the transmission. = The Scattered Sages = The Zen Eccentric Zhutou (Zhimeng.) Painted in the early 16th century Muromachi Period Japan by Josetsu. Xianzi is one of several traditional Chan/Zen figures known as the “scattered sages,” many of which are depicted with in the same humorous, iconoclastic light. Examples of other Scattered Sages include the laughing monk Budai/Hotei, Tanka 丹霞 the icon burner, the Four Sleepers (Hanshan 寒山, Shide 拾得, Fenggan 豐干, and Fenggan's tiger,) and Zhimeng 智猛. Zhimeng in particular bears similarities to Xianzi, because he was a figure famous for eating pig's heads as his favorite treat, much in the same way that Xianzi favored eating shrimp. As a result of their similarities, it was not uncommon for hanging scrolls of Xianzi and Zhimeng to be exhibited together. The artist Josetsu (1405-1496,) for instance, painted the two individually, but their paintings are strikingly similar and are displayed together. Some scholars theorize that many of the Scattered Sages actually predate Chan/Zen Buddhism and exist outside of its religious context. They were absorbed into the Chan/Zen pantheon as a means of co-opting traditional Chinese culture, enhancing Chan/Zen's cultural appeal and diverting local customs into a Buddhist framework. However, the evidence for this in the case of Xianzi is limited and no hard conclusions can be drawn.  Visual Representation  Kano Tan'yu in the 17th century. Property of the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Although his name can be translated as “Master Clam” and in his biography he is said to have eaten both shrimp and clams, Xianzi is always painted holding a shrimp in his hand and never a clam. Additionally, he is frequently painted with his fishing net in one hand to show that he caught his prey himself. His beard is always painted with blurry grey brushstrokes, and although his robes are always relatively simple and never decorated or elaborate, sometimes they more closely resemble the traditional robes of monk, rather than those of a peasant. His humble lifestyle is never drawn into question and his poverty is always made clear. Lastly, all known paintings of Xianzi show him eating shrimp – details of his life outside of his shrimp-eating habit are sometimes alluded to in the inscriptions and poems written at the top of the painting, but they are never explicitly shown. The Zen Eccentric Xianzi. Painted in the early 16th century Muromachi Period Japan by Josetsu. Much of Xianzi's iconography remains the same from painting to painting, but there seem to be three general categories of depicting him; in one, Xianzi holds the shrimp above his head with his mouth open as if to eat it, while in the second he holds it in front of his face at eye level, intently examining it. In the former category, Xianzi is also frequently smiling and standing more informally, while in the latter category his posture is more restrained. Although when Xianzi is painted looking at the shrimp with his mouth closed he can either be wearing the robes of a monk or the simpler, more ragged robes of the destitute, he is never painted both with his mouth open to eat the shrimp and the robes of a monk. In those paintings, his dress is not representative of the monastic tradition. The third way in which Xianzi is painted shows him actually fishing, with one shrimp already in his hand to show what exactly he is doing. He is intent on his work and pursues no other activities. Like many paintings done of the “scattered sages,” all paintings of Xianzi are done in the style of apparition painting. They are monochromatic ink paintings, frequently executed on hanging scrolls. The reason for the dominance of this particular style is that even though most paintings of Xianzi and other Scattered Sages were done by monk painters, it is understood that the audience they were trying to appeal to was the Chinese literati and scholastic community of Song Dynasty China, which preferred the apparition painting style. These paintings were frequently given as gifts to members of the scholar elite, and so they naturally reflected the tastes of their recipients.

History  This market was founded during the Aghlabid reign in the 9th century, witnessed many changes through the centuries but kept its distinguishing feature since its creation as totally covered. The current state goes back to the Tunisian independence period. For decades, this souk was exclusive for the nobles of Sfax and its rich citizens because of the type and quality of its products. Till this day, its merchants belong to the noble society of the community (which is not only related to wealth level), that's why, apart of its economic role, Souk Erbaa had a social one as a meeting place.  Etymology  It got its appellation from the position in which the merchants used to sit, in the lotus position, because of the high altitude of their shops. Some historians believe the Erbaa naming came from the fact that the products there used to be sold for the quarter of its original price.  Locale  Adjoining the oratory-cathedral, the cruciform Souk Erbaa occupies the whole territory from the north of the old city to its south, linking Souk El Sabbagine to Souk El Kamour. It is crossed in its middle by Souk El Attarine that is composed of two old Souks: Souk El Hannatine in the east, and Souk Erbaa Esghir in the west.  Description  Alley of Souk Erbaa According to a study conducted by Gdoura Mahmoud in 1982, the souk occupies a surface of 2000. It is composed of two rows of small 120 shops in total, with a ceiling made of stone and plaster arches. It is linked to Souk El Balghajine by a small eastern alley that used to be called Farkha during the 9th century, and that has two doors: the first in Souk Erbaa while the second is located in Souk El Balghajine (also known as Souk El Okba). Souk Erbaa is composed of three markets: Souk Erbaa El Wesaa (the wide Souk Erbaa) in the east and Souk Erbaa El sghir (the small Souk Erbaa) and Souk Erbaa Thayak (the tight Souk Erbaa) in the west. Souk Erbaa El Thayak that was basically a storage place for animals feed, and then for the animals themselves. Afterwards, it became a place for textile trading. The rest of the Souk was specialized in the wool products (laffa) trading (coats, blankets, chechias, margoums, etc.). Also, it was the trading place for Syrian products (saya).

Somali troops supported by tanks under the command of Barre stormed Mogadishu and seized key government buildings and ordered the resignation of the country's leaders. The coup deposed President Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein and Prime Minister Mohammad Egal and led to the twenty-one year long military rule by Barre and the imposition of a Marxist- Leninist government in Somalia until 1991. Arising out of the highly contested parliamentary elections of March 1969 and political tensions, the coup led to political repression and Somalia becoming a virtual Soviet satellite state until 1977 at which point it became an ally of the United States. It was the first successful coup, after two previous aborted attempts, in Somali history since the country achieved independence nine years earlier in 1960. Background Somalia became independent in 1960, creating the Somali Republic from former Italian Somaliland and former British Somaliland. The first leaders of the new republic were President Aden Abdullah Osman Daar who served as head of state and Prime Minister Mohammad Egal of the Somali Youth League. Because Somalia was composed of two recently unified territories, the country was divided in many aspects such as taxation, policing, legal systems, and administration, however these differences were largely resolved in a 1961 referendum on a new constitution which saw more than 90% of voters approve the document. The constitution which merged Italian and British colonial institutions established a parliamentary democracy and was intended to create a single national identity. Despite the ratification of a new constitution, Somalia remained deeply divided among ethnic, political, and clan lines. In 1961, a rebellion by British trained junior army officers in northern Somalia took place however it was quelled, resulting in one officer being killed. The country's first legislative elections were held in 1964, and the Somali Youth League won 69 out of 123 seats in the National Assembly. The rest of the seats in the parliament were split between 11 parties. In 1967, Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, the Italian educated prime minister and member of the Somali Youth League (SYL), was elected as president of Somalia. In March 1969 another legislative election was held with 64 parties in the running with the SYL being the only political party to have candidates in every election district. The number of political parties was typical of Somalia due to the wide array of differing clans and ethnic groups and the fact that the prerequisite to running was simply clan sponsorship or the support of 500 voters. The election was highly contentious and saw the Somali Youth League gain an even greater majority in the parliament. Allegations of electoral fraud and corruption were rampant and more than 25 people were killed in election-related violence. A general perception grew among Somalis that the SYL was becoming increasingly authoritarian in its rule. This view was compounded by the newly formed government under Prime Minister Egal largely ignoring allegations of fraud and corruption. This sweeping unrest and dissatisfaction created an unhealthy political situation in the country that paved the way for the October coup by Siad Barre and other officers. Major General Siad Barre, a former Italian colonial police officer and member of the Darod clan, was the commander of the Somali army, and an ardent Marxist and nationalist due to his experiences with Soviet advisers as an army officer in the 1960s. He emerged as the leader of the Supreme Revolutionary Council a group of Somali military and police officers ranging in rank from major general to captain. Coup Mogadishu city center in 1963. On 15 October 1969, President Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, only Somalia's second president of the postcolonial era, was shot dead by his bodyguard using an automatic rifle as he stepped out of a car in the northern city of Las Anod. He was succeeded by interim President Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein. The coup was set in motion the day after Sharmarke's funeral. The coup d'état took place during the early morning hours of 21 October 1969. Troops of the Somali National Armed Forces supported by tanks and commanded by various members of the Supreme Revolutionary Council sealed off several strategic sites in Mogadishu, including the parliament building, information ministry, the Radio Mogadishu station, police headquarters, and the mansion of Prime Minister Egal. Major government officials were abducted and imprisoned. Several former senior Somali politicians were rounded up during the coup as well, among them former President Aden Adde and former Prime Minister Abdirizak Haji Hussein. Both were placed in detention and were not released until 1973. Prime Minister Egal too was imprisoned, but in solitary confinement. Despite the seizure of police buildings in the coup, the police did not resist the military and even cooperated with them. Jama Ali Korshel, the head of the Somali Police Force was appointed vice chairman of the Supreme Revolutionary Council. After coupist forces seized Radio Mogadishu, the station began broadcasting martial music as a way of conveying the motives of the coup leaders, including the song \\"Either doomsday death or victory of life,\\" which invoked images of several wild animals such as lions and horses. In his first speech on the radio during the coup, Barre condemned the \\"corruption\\" of the old regime and disparaged the oppression of the educated. He also explained that although the government he had overthrown was inept and corrupt not all of its members were criminals, perhaps acknowledging that he had been a part of the very system he had just overthrown. Barre's Supreme Revolutionary Council dissolved the parliament and the Supreme Court, and suspended the constitution. In 1970, one year after the coup, Siad Barre declared Somalia to be a socialist state and set upon the 'Somalization' of the country, essentially a grand scheme to diminish clan loyalties and create a 'dutiful Somali' country. Aftermath Poster of Siad Barre in Mogadishu. The 25-member Supreme Revolutionary Council, in essence a military junta, took over all the duties of the state after the coup, including the presidency, National Assembly, and Council of Ministers. The country was renamed the Somali Democratic Republic and a political purge took place; political parties were banned, former Prime Minister Egal and several other politicians were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences, and dissidents were persecuted. A power struggle in the ranks of the SRC, took place with Siad Barre eventually rising to become Somalia's leader. Salaad Gabeyre Kediye, who had been called the \\"Father of the Revolution\\", and Abdulkadir Dheel, a high-ranking army colonel were executed in public by firing squad in 1972. Barre, called the \\"Victorious Leader\\", began leading the country in the direction of scientific socialism and sought to create a shared national identity in Somalia by decreasing the role and influence of the country's various clans. Nomads were resettled into agricultural communes, a large literacy campaign was undertaken, women were granted more rights, and the Latin script was officially adopted for use in the Somali language. Military spending increased with the help of the Soviet Union which provided large volumes of equipment and trainers, and soon Somalia possessed one of the most powerful military forces in Africa. Barre cultivated a cult of personality throughout his 21 years of rule, seeking inspiration from his idols, Kim Il-sung and Gamal Abdel Nasser. The SRC was dissolved in 1976 and Barre became increasingly totalitarian with human rights abuses becoming endemic in Somalia. The United Nations Development Programme wrote in 2001, \\"the 21-year regime of Siyad Barre had one of the worst human rights records in Africa,\\" with the Barre regime persecuting and torturing suspected political dissidents for decades.UNDP, Human Development Report 2001-Somalia, (New York: 2001), p. 42 Allegations of Soviet involvement Though no official evidence has been presented to support this theory, suspicions of Soviet involvement in the coup have been widespread since the takeover was carried out in 1969. At the time, postcolonial Somalia had been receiving large volumes of military support from the Soviet Union including vehicles, small arms, and technical assistance in the form of advisers. In addition, thousands of Somali military officers had been sent to the Soviet Union for training in the country's military academies and the Soviet Union maintained a sizable naval base in the country. However, after the coup the Soviets remained wary of the new regime and seemed unsure of the junta's preferred political direction. It is known that the KGB's station in Mogadishu was notified in advance of the coup and some of the plotters were Soviet informants. Salaad Gabeyre Kediye, one of the coup's main architects who was executed in 1972, was a KGB informant codenamed \\"OPERATOR\\", according to documents from the Mitrokhin Archive and the writings of Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew.Andrew, Christopher M.; Vasili Mitrokhin (2005).

She had been the prospective bride of two princes, both times judged not suitable to the match. Biography Baring was born on 8 November 1901, the daughter of Sir Godfrey Baring, 1st Baronet of Nubia House, Cowes, Isle of Wight and Eva Hermione Mackintosh.Mosley, Charles, editor.

Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003 She was the sixth generation in direct descent from United States Senator William Bingham, once America's richest man, and his wife Anne Willing Bingham. Their daughter married Baring in the first great international social match between an American bride and an English groom. Miss Poppy Baring (left) In 1921 Albert, Duke of York (the future king George VI), fell in love with Baring, but she had the reputation of being \\"fast\\" and fun-loving. He proposed marriage, she accepted, but Queen Mary made it clear that the match was impossible. Six years later, Baring had an affair with Prince George, Duke of Kent, but this time it was the King, George V, who objected to their romance because Poppy was not \\"suitable\\". Nevertheless, Poppy Baring was Prince George's mistress for many years. Her close friend was Lois Sturt. In October 1925, Baring assisted at the small, and apparently secret, wedding ceremony of Francis Hastings, 16th Earl of Huntingdon, to Christina Casati, daughter of Luisa Casati. After the marriage, Baring and Napier Sturt, 3rd Baron Alington (Lois' brother) accompanied the grooms to Dover. Poppy Baring, 1925 In 1927 Baring established a dress shop named \\"Poppy's\\" in Down Street where she sold the latest fashions. On 17 December 1928 she married William Piers \\"Peter\\" Thursby, an Eton cricketer, son of Reverend Harvey William Gustavus Thursby and Margaret Emily Mount. Raymund de Trafford was also a close friend of Baring, and went to stay with her soon after his release from prison in 1942. She died in 1980.

He was the son of Scottish internationalist, Hughie Gallacher from Gallacher senior's first marriage. Background Hughie Gallacher met his first wife, Annie McIlvanney, at the coalpit he worked at in Hattonrig. Gallacher was from a protestant background but uninterested in sectarianism grew up supporting Celtic. McIlvanney coming from a catholic background caused some family strains for a while. The couple married in July 1920 when Gallacher was 17 years old. They stayed together only for a year having a son who died before his first birthday. The couple reunited and tried living together again from which their second son, John (known as Jackie), was born. Hughie and Annie separated for the final time in 1923. Jackie grew up in Scotland when his father played most of his career in the English Football League.\\"The Hughie Gallacher Story\\", Paul Joannou, Breedon Books, 1989 Celtic Jackie Gallacher when aged 19 joined Celtic on 10 July 1943 from Armadale Thistle. He made his Celtic first team debut in the wartime Scottish Southern League on 4 September 1943. He scored his team's only goal in a 4–1 home defeat by Dumbarton. He played 22 games in that competition that season scoring 19 goals. He scored 12 goals in six Scottish Southern League Cup group games before his team lost 4–2 to Rangers in the semi-final. He formed a productive partnership with inside-forward, Gerry McAloon, who was there that season. However Gallacher was not the same player when McAloon was often away with work leading to Gallacher at one point being dropped and requesting a transfer. Gallacher was understudy to Ephraim 'Jock' Dodds in the 1944 wartime Scotland v England international. In the 1944–45 season Gallacher played in 21 games in the same wartime league competition. This time he scored 18 goals. In 1945–46 he formed an effective partnership with another inside-forward, this time Tommy Kiernan. Gallacher played 24 games in the last edition of the Scottish Southern League finding the net 18 times. In the 1946 Victory Cup at the end of that season he scored three in an 8–2 win at St Johnstone and two in a 3–0 home win over his father's ex-club, Queen of the South. Gallacher was again eliminated in the semis by Rangers this time 2–0 in a replay in June 1946. However after some tough challenges by his opponents he was stretchered from the field subsequently spending all of the next season without first team football.\\"Hughie Gallacher\\" qosfc.com In 1947–48 he returned to the first team. In four Scottish League Cup group games he scored four goals including one in a 2–0 home win v Rangers. He then played in two league games in September that his club lost without scoring. He didn't feature in the first team again that season. He returned to the first team in late August 1948. In 29 games (including three in the winning Glasgow Cup run), he scored 21 goals. That included seven goals in six League Cup group games that included one goal in the 3–1 home win over Rangers. He scored all five of his team's combined goals losing 4–2 at Hibernian and 6–3 at home to Clyde. He scored another hat- trick that season in the 4–4 home league draw against Falkirk. In 1948–49 his only Celtic appearance was his last for the club. He scored in a 5–1 League defeat on 17 December at Scot Symon's East Fife. He was 24 at the time. Gallacher had knee cartilage removed at the end of that season. Loans to Dunfermline Athletic and Falkirk In each of 1948–49 and 1949–50 Gallacher had loan spells at Dunfermline Athletic. He scored five goals from a combined 10 league games. In 1950–51 he played 11 league games on loan for Falkirk. He scored twice in those games.

For her service in the military she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 15 May 1946.  Civilian life  Stempkovskaya was born to a Russian family in the Minsk Region of the Byelorussian SSR in the year 1921, but her exact date of birth is unknown. The family later moved to Uzbekistan to develop the cotton industry; she graduated from the Tashkent Pedagogical Institute and remained in Uzbekistan until the start of the Second World War.  Military career  Stempkovskaya joined the Red Army in June 1941 after the start of the Second World War, having previously been in the Komsomol. She was trained in radio communications and assigned to the 216th Infantry Regiment as a radio operator. After a spotter was killed in the fighting in Kursk, she took over but was closer to the line of fire when the Nazis surrounded and closed in on the trench. There are two versions of the events leading up to her death; one states that she attempted to fend of the Nazis by throwing two grenades but was eventually captured due to being heavily outnumbered and tortured for information, her captors having stabbed her with bayonets and cut off her hands before they left her to bleed to death after she refused to reveal military secrets. The other version of her death, according to more recent sources, is that after the Nazis approached the trench holding several remaining Soviet soldiers, Stempkovskaya entered the battlefield with a machine gun in her last stand and was killed by gunfire, even though radio operators were at high risk of being captured by the Axis to reveal the information they received and transmitted and weren't supposed to be at the front of the fighting. All remaining members of the battalion that did not flee when the Germans began closing in were killed in the battle.

He played an important role in the conquest of Chen dynasty in 589, as well as the campaigns against Goguryeo led by Emperor Yang. In history Lai Hu'er was born in Guangling (today's Yangzhou) during the late Southern and Northern Dynasties period. His parents died when he was young, and he was adopted by Aunt Wu, the wife of his father's elder brother.History of the Northern Dynasties: 护儿未识而孤，养于世母吴氏。吴氏提携鞠养，甚有慈训。 In 581, Yang Jian overthrew the Northern Zhou dynasty and established Sui dynasty. To prepare for the war against Chen dynasty in the south, Sui dynasty ordered the general He Ruobi to lead a troop to guard Shouzhou, a city near Guangling. Lai Hu'er thus had a chance to join the Sui army.Book of Sui:贺若弼之镇寿州也，常令护儿为间谍，授大都督。History of the Northern Dynasties:及开皇初，宇文忻、宇若弼等镇广陵，并深相礼重。除大都督，领本乡兵。 He Ruobi sent Lai Hu'er to Chen dynasty as a spy. Lai Hu'er made several contributions as a spy and was promoted to be a Da Dudu (). In 589, Sui launched massive campaigns against the Chen dynasty in order to unify China. Lai Hu'er took part in this war and was further promoted to be a high-ranked official in the military after the war. In 590, because people in the previous Chen dynasty were unaccustomed of Sui's laws, they rebelled against Sui under the leadership of Gao Zhihui. The Emperor Wen of Sui ordered Yang Su and Lai Hu'er to put down the rebellion. During the campaign, Lai Hu'er provided a good strategy that eventually helped Sui defeat the rebels. After this campaign, Lai Hu'er was promoted to be the Grand General, given a title of Duke of Xiangyang County, and appointed to be the governor of Quanzhou. In the same year, Lai Hu'er defeated some other remnants forces of Gao Zhihui and was promoted to Duke of Yongning Prefecture.History of the Northern Dynasties:十一年，高智慧据江南反，以子总管统兵隋杨素讨之。贼据浙江岸为营，周亘百余里，船舰被江，鼓噪而进。护儿言于素曰：“吴人累锐，利在舟楫。必死之贼，难与争锋。公且严阵以待之，勿与接刃，请假奇兵数千，潜度江，掩破其壁，使退无所归，进不得战，此韩信破赵之策也。”素以为然。护儿乃以轻舸数百，直登江岸，袭破其营，因纵火，烟焰张天。贼顾火而惧，素因是动，一鼓破之。智慧将逃于海，护儿追至闽中，余党皆平。进位大将军。除泉州刺史，封襄阳县公。 In 604 after Emperor Yang became the new emperor, Lai Hu'er was promoted to be a top general of the royal guard army in the central court. His title was also promoted to be Duke of Rong. He was the favorite general to Emperor Yang. When Emperor Yang was touring the empire, he always let Lai Hu'er to be his personal guard outside of the palace. During his service as a senior general, he discovered the talent of Qin Shubao and predicted that Qin would eventually be a great general.History of the Northern Dynasties:炀帝嗣位，被追入朝。仍除右骁卫大将军。寻迁左。又改上柱国为光禄大夫，徙右翊卫大将军，进封荣国公，恩礼隆密，朝臣无比。New Book of Tang:始为隋将来护儿帐内，母丧，护儿遣使襚吊之。吏怪曰：“士卒死丧，将军未有所问，今独吊叔宝何也？”护儿曰：“是子才而武，志节完整，岂久处卑贱邪？” In 612, Emperor Yang launched his first campaign against Goguryeo. In this campaign, Lai Hu'er was appointed to be the Chief Commander of Pyongyang Circuit. He led the naval force of Sui dynasty to attack Goguryeo, and defeated the Goguryeo army 30 kilometers away from the Pyongyang city.History of the Northern Dynasties:辽东之役，以护儿为平壤道行军总管，兼检校东莱郡太守，率楼船指沧海。入自浿水，去平壤六十里，高丽主高元扫境内兵以拒之。 He then ordered his troops to attack Pyongyang. His vice commander Zhou Fashang suggested that they should be careful because Goguryeo people were good at ambushing. Lai Hu'er did not take that suggestion. He marched towards the Pyongyang city with 40,000 men, and was ambushed by Goguryeo army outside of the city. Fortunately, Zhou Fashang reinforced him with the rest of the Sui troops so that Lai Hu'er managed to retreat back to the harbor. After other circuits of Sui dynasty attacking the Goguryeo from land were all defeated in Liaodong, Lai Hu'er retreated back to Sui dynasty.Zizhi Tongjian:护儿欲乘胜趣其城，副总管周法尚止之，请俟诸军至俱进。护儿不听，简精甲四万，直造城下。高丽伏兵于罗郭内空寺中，出兵与护儿战而伪败，护儿逐之入城，纵兵俘掠，无复部伍。伏兵发，护儿大败，仅而获免，士卒还者不过数千人。高丽追至船所，周法尚整陈待之，高丽乃退。 In 613, Emperor Yang launched the second campaign against Goguryeo. Lai Hu'er, again, was ordered to lead the navy as the Chief Commander of Canghai Circuit to attack Pyongyang from the sea.History of the Northern Dynasties:明年，又出沧海道，师次东莱，会杨玄感反，进攻洛阳，护儿闻之，召裨将周法尚等议旋军讨逆。 Not long after the campaign started, Yang Xuangan rebelled against Sui in Luoyang. Lai Hu'er decided to draw back from Korea immediately and to encircle Yang Xuangan with some of other Sui generals such as Yuwen Shu. His vice commander Zhou Fashang was afraid that if they draw back without the permission from the emperor, they would be punished. Lai said that Goguryeo was only like a minor illness, but Yang Xuangan was like a life-threatening disease to Sui dynasty.Zizhi Tongjian:洛阳被围，心腹之疾；高丽逆命，犹疥癣耳 Then, he took his men back to Sui dynasty and eventually suppressed Yang Xuangan along with other Sui forces. The emperor was pleased with his decision and promoted him to be a chancellor.History of the Northern Dynasties: 于是护儿与宇文述破玄感于阌乡，斩平之。还，加开府仪同三司，赐物五千段、黄金千两、奴婢百人，赠父法敏东阳郡太守、永宁县公。 In 614, during the third campaign against Goguryeo, Lai Hu'er led the navy for the third time and defeated Goguryeo army during a battle at Sabi. King Yeongyang of Goguryeo was scared by Lai's attack and thus surrendered to Emperor Yang. Lai planned to continue attacking the Goguryeo, but the emperor accepted Goguryeo's surrender and asked Lai to withdraw.History of the Northern Dynasties:十一年，又率师渡海，破高丽奢卑等二城。高丽举国来战，护儿大破之。将趣平壤，高元震惧，使执叛臣斛斯政诣辽东城下请降。帝许之，诏护儿旋军。 In 615, when Emperor Yang was touring the northern border of the emperor, he was encircled by Tujue at Yanmen. Lai Hu'er led his troop to protect the general at Yanmen, and successfully held the city until reinforcements led by other Sui generals such as Li Shimin and Wang Shichong arrived. In 618, when Emperor Yang was touring the Jiangdu, Yuwen Huaji led a military mutiny. Emperor Yang was killed. Lai Hu'er was also killed during the fight in order to protect the emperor. Most of his sons were also executed by Yuwen Huaji after the mutiny. In popular culture Lai Hu'er was one of the prototypes that inspired the creation of the popular fictional figure Yang Lin. Folk tale writers in ancient China mixed stories of Lai Hu'er, Zhang Xutuo and Yang Shuang and created the story of Yang Lin that would be one of the most celebrated fictional figures in the folk culture. In some other versions of folk tales, Lai Hu'er was portrayed as a great warrior whose weapon was a steel spear.

Edward II had become increasingly unpopular with the English nobility due to the excessive influence of unpopular court favourites, the patronage he accorded them, and his perceived ill-treatment of the nobility. By 1325, even his wife, Queen Isabella, despised him. Towards the end of the year, she took the young Edward to her native France, where she entered into an alliance with the powerful and wealthy nobleman Roger Mortimer, who her husband previously had exiled. The following year, they invaded England to depose Edward II. Almost immediately, the King's resistance was beset by betrayal, and he eventually abandoned London and fled west, probably to raise an army in Wales or Ireland. He was soon captured and imprisoned. Isabella and Mortimer summoned a parliament to confer legitimacy on their regime. The meeting began gathering at Westminster on 7 January, but little could be done in the absence of the King. The fourteen-year-old Edward was proclaimed \\"Keeper of the Realm\\" (but not yet king), and a parliamentary deputation was sent to Edward II asking him to allow himself to be brought to parliament. He refused, and the parliament continued without him. The King was accused of offences ranging from the promotion of favourites to the destruction of the church, resulting in a betrayal of his coronation oath to the people. These were known as the \\"Articles of Accusation\\". The City of London was particularly aggressive in its attacks on Edward II, and its citizens may have helped intimidate those attending the parliament into agreeing to the King's deposition, which occurred on the afternoon of 13 January. On or around 21 January, the Lords Temporal sent another delegation to the King to inform him of his deposition, effectively giving Edward an ultimatum: if he did not agree to hand over the crown to his son, then the lords in parliament would give it to somebody outside the royal family. King Edward wept but agreed to their conditions. The delegation returned to London, and Edward III was proclaimed king immediately. He was crowned on 1 February 1327. In the aftermath of the parliamentary session, his father remained imprisoned, being moved around to prevent attempted rescues; he died—presumed killed, probably on Mortimer's orders—that September. Crises continued for Mortimer and Isabella, who were de facto rulers of the country, partly because of Mortimer's own greed, mismanagement, and mishandling of the new king. Edward III led a coup d'état against Mortimer in 1330, overthrew him, and began his personal rule.  Background  King Edward II of England had court favourites who were unpopular with his nobility, such as Piers Gaveston and Hugh Despenser the Younger. Gaveston was killed during an earlier noble rebellion against Edward in 1312, and Despenser was hated by the English nobility. Edward was also unpopular with the common people due to his repeated demands from them for unpaid military service in Scotland. None of his campaigns there were successful, and this led to a further decline in his popularity, particularly with the nobility. His image was further diminished in 1322 when he executed his cousin, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and confiscated the Lancaster estates. Historian Chris Given-Wilson has written how by 1325 the nobility believed that \\"no landholder could feel safe\\" under the regime. This distrust of Edward was shared by his wife, Isabella of France, who believed Despenser responsible for poisoning the King's mind against her. In September 1324 Queen Isabella had been publicly humiliated when the government declared her an enemy alien, and the King had immediately repossessed her estates, probably at the urging of Despenser. Edward also disbanded her retinue. Edward had already been threatened with deposition on two previous occasions (in 1310 and 1321). Historians agree that hostility towards Edward was universal. W. H. Dunham and C. T. Wood ascribed this to Edward's \\"cruelty and personal faults\\", suggesting that \\"very few, not even his half-brothers or his son, seemed to care about the wretched man\\" and that none would fight for him. A contemporary chronicler described Edward as rex inutilis, or a \\"useless king\\". Depiction of Isabella and Roger Mortimer, France had recently invaded the Duchy of Aquitaine, then an English royal possession. In response, King Edward sent Isabella to Paris, accompanied by their thirteen-year-old son, Edward, to negotiate a settlement. Contemporaries believed she had sworn, on leaving, never to return to England with the Despensers in power. Soon after her arrival, correspondence between Isabella and her husband, as well between them and her brother King Charles IV of France and Pope John XXII, effectively disclosed the royal couple's increasing estrangement to the world. A contemporary chronicler reports how Isabella and Edward became increasingly scathing of each other, worsening relations. By December 1325 she had entered into a possibly sexual relationship in Paris with the wealthy exiled nobleman Roger Mortimer. This was public knowledge in England by March 1326, and the King openly considered a divorce. He demanded that Isabella and Edward return to England, which they refused to do: \\"she sent back many of her retinue but gave trivial excuses for not returning herself\\" noted her biographer, John Parsons. Their son's failure to break with his mother angered the King further. Isabella became more strident in her criticisms of Edward's government, particularly against Walter de Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter, a close associate of the King and Despenser. King Edward alienated his son by putting the prince's estates under royal administration in January 1326, and the following month the King ordered that both he and his mother be arrested on landing in England. While in Paris, the Queen became the head of King Edward's exiled opposition. Along with Mortimer, this group included Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent, Henry de Beaumont, John de Botetourt, John Maltravers and William Trussell. All were united by hatred of the Despensers. Isabella portrayed her and Prince Edward as seeking refuge from her husband and his court, both of whom she claimed were hostile to her, and claimed protection from Edward II. King Charles refused to countenance an invasion of England; instead, the rebels gained the Count of Hainaut's backing. In return, Isabella agreed that her son would marry the Count's daughter Philippa. This was a further insult to Edward II, who had intended to use his eldest son's marriage as a bargaining tool against France, probably intending a marriage alliance with Spain. =Invasion of England= Mortimer and Isabella's invasion route in 1326 Their landing and attack is in green; the King's retreat westward is in blue. From February 1326 it was clear in England that Isabella and Mortimer intended to invade. Despite false alarms, large ships, as a defensive measure, were forbidden from leaving English ports, and some were pressed into royal service. King Edward declared war on France in July; Isabella and Mortimer invaded England in September, landing in Suffolk on the 24th. The commander of the royal fleet assisted the rebels: the first of many betrayals Edward II suffered. Isabella and Mortimer soon found they had significant support among the English political class. They were quickly joined by Thomas, Earl of Norfolk, the King's brother, accompanied by Henry, Earl of Leicester (brother of the executed Earl of Lancaster), and soon afterwards arrived the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishops of Hereford and Lincoln. Within the week, support for the King had dissolved, and, accompanied by Despenser, he deserted London and travelled west. Edward's flight to the west precipitated his downfall. Historian Michael Prestwich describes the King's support as collapsing \\"like a building hit by an earthquake\\". Edward's rule was already weak, and \\"even before the invasion, along with preparation, there had been panic. Now there was simply panic\\". Ormrod notes how King Edward's attempt to raise an army in South Wales was to no avail, and he and Despenser were captured on 16 November 1326 near Llantrisant. This, along with the unexpected swiftness with which the entire regime had collapsed, forced Isabella and Mortimer to wield executive power until they made arrangements for a successor to the throne. The King was incarcerated by the Earl of Leicester, while those suspected of being Despenser spies or supporters of the King—particularly in London, which was aggressively loyal to the Queen—were murdered by mobs. Isabella spent the last months of 1326 in the West Country, and while in Bristol witnessed the hanging of Despenser's father, the Earl of Winchester on 27 October. Despenser himself was captured in Hereford and executed there within the month. In Bristol Isabella, Mortimer and the accompanying lords discussed strategy. Not yet possessing the Great Seal, on 26 October they proclaimed the young Edward guardian of the realm, declaring that \\"by the assent of the whole community of the said kingdom present there, they unanimously chose [Edward III] as keeper of the said kingdom\\". He was not yet officially declared king. The rebels' description of themselves as a community deliberately harked back to the reform movement of Simon de Montfort and the baronial league, which had described its reform programme as being of the community of the realm against Henry III. Claire Valente has pointed out how, in reality, the most common phrase heard \\"was not 'the community of the realm', but 'the quarrel of the earl of Lancaster'\\", illustrating how the struggle was still a factional one within baronial politics, whatever cloak it may have appeared to possess as a reform movement. By 20 November 1326 the Bishop of Hereford had retrieved the Great Seal from the King, and delivered it to the King's son. He could now be announced as his father's heir apparent. Although, at this stage, it might still have been possible for Edward II to remain king, says Ormrod, \\"the writing was on the wall\\". A document issued by Isabella and her son at this time described their respective positions thus:  Summoning of parliament  Depiction of Edward II of England, Isabella, Mortimer and the lords arrived in London on 4 January 1327. In response to the previous year's spate of murders, Londoners had been forbidden to bear arms, and two days later all citizens had sworn an oath to keep the peace. Parliament met on 7 January to consider the state of the realm now the King was incarcerated. It had originally been summoned by Isabella and the Prince, in the name of the King, on 28 October the previous year. Parliament had been intended to assemble on 14 December 1326, but on 3 December—still in the name of the King—further writs were issued deferring the sitting until early the next year. This, it was implied, was due to the King being abroad, rather than imprisoned. Because of this, parliament would have to be held before the Queen and Prince Edward. The History of Parliament Trust has described the legality of the writs as being \\"highly questionable\\", and C. T. Wood called the sitting \\"a show of pseudo- parliamentary regularity\\", \\"stage-managed\\" by Mortimer and Thomas, Lord Wake. For Isabella and Mortimer, governing through parliament was only a temporary solution to a constitutional problem, because at some point their positions would likely be challenged legally. Thus, suggests Ormrod, they had to enforce a solution favourable to Mortimer and the Queen, by any means they could. Contemporaries were uncertain as to the legality of Isabella's parliament. Edward II was still king, although in official documents, this was only alongside his \\"most beloved consort Isabella queen of England\\" and his \\"firstborn son keeper of the kingdom\\", in what Phil Bradford called as a \\"nominal presidency\\". King Edward was said to be abroad when in reality he was imprisoned in Kenilworth Castle. It was maintained that he desired a \\"colloquium\\" and a \\"tractatum\\" (conference and consultation) with his lords \\"upon various affairs touching himself and the state of his kingdom\\", hence the holding of parliament. Supposedly it was Edward II himself who postponed the first sitting until January, \\"for certain necessary causes and utilities\\", presumably at the behest of the Queen and Mortimer. A priority for the new regime was deciding what to do with Edward II. Mortimer considered holding a state trial for treason, in the expectation of a guilty verdict and a death sentence. He and other lords discussed the matter at Isabella's Wallingford Castle just after Christmas, but with no agreement. The Lords Temporal affirmed that Edward had failed his country so gravely that only his death could heal it; the attending bishops, on the other hand, held that whatever his faults, he had been anointed king by God. This presented Isabella and Mortimer with two problems. First, the bishops' argument would be popularly understood as risking the wrath of God. Second, public trials always bring the danger of an unintended verdict, particularly as it seems likely a broad body of public opinion doubted whether an anointed king could even commit treason. Such a result would mean not only Edward's release but his restoration to the throne. Mortimer and Isabella sought to avoid a trial and yet keep Edward II imprisoned for life. The King's imprisonment (officially by his son) had become public knowledge, and Isabella's and Mortimer's hand was forced as the arguments for the young Edward being named keeper of the kingdom were now groundless (as the King had clearly returned to his realm—one way or another). = Attendance = No parliament had sat since November 1325. Only 26 of the 46 barons who had been summoned in October 1326 for the December parliament were then also summoned to that of January 1327, and six of those had never received summonses under Edward II at all. Officially, the instigators of the parliament were the Bishops of Hereford and Winchester, Roger Mortimer and Thomas Wake; Isabella almost certainly played a background role. They summoned, as Lords Spiritual, the Archbishop of Canterbury and fifteen English and four Welsh bishops as well as nineteen abbots. The Lords Temporal were represented by the Earls of Norfolk, Kent, Lancaster, Surrey, Oxford, Atholl and Hereford. Forty-seven barons, twenty-three royal justices, and several knights and burgesses were summoned from the shires and the Cinque Ports. They may well have been encouraged, suggests Maddicott, by the wages to be paid to those attending: the \\"handsome sum\\" of four shillings a day for a knight and two for a burgess. The knights provided the bulk of Isabella's and the Prince's vocal support; they included Mortimer's sons, Edward, Roger and John. Sir William Trussell was appointed procurator, or Speaker, despite his not being an elected member of parliament. Although the office of procurator was not new, the purpose of Trussell's role set a constitutional precedent, as he was authorised to speak on behalf of parliament as a body. A chronicle describes Trussell as one \\"who cannot disagree with himself and, [therefore], shall ordain for all\\". There were fewer lords present than were traditionally summoned, which increased the influence of the Commons. This may have been a deliberate strategy on behalf of Isabella and Mortimer, who, suggests Dodd, would have known well that in the occasionally tumultuous parliaments of earlier reigns, \\"the trouble that had been caused in parliament had emanated almost exclusively from the barons\\". The Archbishop of York, who had been summoned to the December parliament, was \\"conspicuous by his absence\\" from the January sitting. Some Welsh MPs also received summonses, but these had deliberately been despatched too late for those elected to attend; others, such as the sheriff of Meirionnydd, Gruffudd Llwyd, refused to attend, out of loyalty to Edward II and also hatred of Roger Mortimer. Although a radical gathering, the parliament was to some degree consistent with previous assemblies, being dominated by lords reliant on a supportive Commons. It differed, though, in the greater-than-usual influence that outsiders and commoners had, such as those from London. The January–February parliament was geographically broader too, as it contained unelected members from Bury St Edmunds and St Albans: says Maddicott, \\"those who planned the deposition reached out in parliament to those who had no right to be there\\". And, says Dodd, the rebels deliberately made parliament \\"centre stage\\" to their plans.  Parliament assembled =The King's absence= Illustration of a late 13th-century parliament (c. 1278): The lords spiritual are seated to the king's right, the lords temporal to his left, and in the centre sit the justices and law officers. No commons are present at this session.Before parliament met, the lords had sent Adam Orleton (the Bishop of Hereford) and William Trussell to Kenilworth to see the King, with the intention of persuading Edward to return with them and attend parliament. They failed in this mission: Edward flatly refused and roundly cursed them. The envoys returned to Westminster on 12 January; by which time parliament had been sitting five days. It was felt that nothing could be done until the King had arrived: historically a parliament could only pass statutes with the monarch present. On hearing from Orleton and Trussell how Edward had denounced them, the King's opponents were no longer willing to let his absence stand in their way. Edward II's refusal to attend failed to prevent the parliament from taking place, the first time this had ever happened.  Constitutional crisis  The various titles bestowed on the younger Edward at the end of 1326—which acknowledged his unique position in government while avoiding calling him king—reflected an underlying constitutional crisis, of which contemporaries were keenly aware. The fundamental question was how the crown was transferred between two living kings, a situation which had never arisen before. Valente has described how this \\"upset the accepted order of things, threatened the sacrosanctity of kingship, and lacked clear legality or established process\\". Contemporaries were also uncertain as to whether Edward II had abdicated or was being deposed. On 26 October it had been recorded in the Close Rolls that Edward had \\"left or abandoned his kingdom\\", and his absence enabled Isabella and Mortimer to rule. They could legitimately argue that King Edward, having provided no regent during his absence (as would be usual), should make his son governor of the kingdom in his father's stead. They also said Edward II held Parliament in contempt by calling it a treasonous assembly and insulted those attending it as traitors\\". It is unknown whether the King did, in fact, say or believe this, but it certainly suited Isabella and Mortimer for parliament to think so. If Edward did denounce parliament then he probably did not realise how it could be used against him. In any case, Edward's absence saved the couple the embarrassment of having a reigning king present when they deposed him, and Seymour Phillips suggests that if Edward had attended he may have found enough support to disrupt their plans. = Proceedings of Monday, 12 January = Parliament had to consider its next step. Bishop Orleton—emphasising Isabella's fear of the King—asked the assembled lords whom they would prefer to rule, Edward or his son. The response was sluggish, with no rush to either depose or acclaim. Deposition had been raised too suddenly for many members to stomach: the King was still not entirely friendless, and indeed, has been described by Paul Dryburgh as casting an \\"ominous shadow\\" over the proceedings. Orleton suspended proceedings until the next day to allow the lords to dwell on the question overnight. Also on the 12th, Sir Richard de Betoyne, the Mayor of London, and the Common Council wrote to the lords in support of both the Earl of Chester being made King and the deposition of Edward II, whom they accused of failing to uphold his coronation oath and the duties of the crown. Mortimer, who was highly regarded by Londoners, may well have instigated this as a means of influencing the lords. The Londoners' petition also proposed that the new king should be governed by his Council until it was clear he understood his coronation oath and regal responsibilities. This petition the lords accepted; another, requesting the King should hold Westminster parliaments annually until he reached his majority, was not. = Proceedings of Tuesday, 13 January = Whether Edward II resigned his throne or was forced from it under pressure, the crown legally changed hands on 13 January with the support, it was recorded, of \\"all the baronage of the land\\". Parliament met in the morning and then suspended itself. A large group of the lords temporal and spiritual made their way to the City of London's Guildhall where they swore an oath \\"to uphold all that has been ordained or shall be ordained for the common profit\\". This was intended to present those in parliament who disagreed with deposition with a fait accompli. At the Guildhall they also swore to uphold the constitutional limitations of the Ordinances of 1311. The group then returned to Westminster in the afternoon, and the lords formally acknowledged that Edward II was no longer to be King. Several orations were made. Mortimer, speaking on behalf of the lords, announced their decision. Edward II, he proclaimed, would abdicate and \\"...Sir Edward ... should have the government of the realm and be crowned king\\". The French chronicler Jean Le Bel described how the lords proceeded to document Edward II's \\"ill-advised deeds and actions\\" to create a legal record which was duly presented to parliament. This record declared \\"such a man was unfit ever to wear the crown or call himself King\\". This list of misdeeds—probably drawn up by Orleton and Stratford personally—were known as the Articles of Accusation. The bishops gave sermons—Orleton, for example, spoke of how \\"a foolish king shall ruin his people\\", and, report Dunham and Wood, he \\"dwelt weightily upon the folly and unwisdom of the king, and upon his childish doings\\". This, says Ian Mortimer, was \\"a tremendous sermon, rousing those present in the way he knew best, through the power of the word of God\\". Orleton based his sermon on the biblical text \\"Where there is no governor the people shall fall\\" from the Book of Proverbs, while the Archbishop of Canterbury took for his text Vox Populi, Vox Dei. = Articles of accusation= The main hall of the City of London's Guildhall where oaths were taken During the sermons, the articles of deposition were officially presented to the assembly. In contrast to the elaborate and floridly hyperbolic accusations previously launched at the Despensers, this was a relatively simple document. The King was accused of being incapable of fair rule; of indulging false counsellors; preferring his own amusements to good government; neglecting England and losing Scotland; dilapidating the church and imprisoning the clergy; and, all in all, being in fundamental breach of the coronation oath he had made to his subjects. All of which, the rebels claimed, was so well known as to be undeniable. The articles accused Edward's favourites of tyranny although not the King himself, whom they described as \\"incorrigible, without hope of reform\\". England's succession of military failures in Scotland and France rankled with the lords: Edward had fought no successful campaigns in either theatre, yet had raised enormous levies to enable him to do so. Such levies says F. M. Powicke, \\"could only have been justified by military success\\". Accusations of military failure were not wholly fair in placing the blame for these losses, as they did, so squarely on Edward II's shoulders: Scotland had arguably been almost lost in 1307. Edward's father had, says Seymour Phillips, left him \\"an impossible task\\", having started the war without making sufficient gains to allow his son to finish it. And Ireland had been the theatre of one of the King's few military successes—the English victory at the Battle of Faughart in 1318 had crushed Robert the Bruce's ambitions in Ireland (and seen the death of his brother). Only the King's military failures, though, were remembered, and indeed, they were the most damning of all the articles: = The King deposed = Every speaker on 13 January reiterated the articles of accusation, and all concluded by offering the young Edward as king, if the people approved him. The crowd outside, which included a large company of unruly Londoners, says Valente, had been \\"whipped ... into such fervour\\" by \\"dramatic outcries at appropriate points in the orations\\" from Thomas Wake, who repeatedly rose and demanded of the assembly whether they agreed with each speaker; \\"Do you agree? Do the people of the country agree?\\" Wake's exhortations—arms outstretched, says Prestwich, he cried \\"I say for myself that he shall reign no more\\")—combined with the intimidating mob, led to tumultuous responses of \\"Let it be done! Let it be done!\\" This, says May McKisack, gave the new regime a degree of \\"support of popular clamour\\". The Londoners played a key role in ensuring that remaining supporters of Edward II were intimidated and overwhelmed by events. Edward III was proclaimed king. At the end of the day, said Valente, \\"the electio of the magnates received the acclamatio of the populi, 'Fiat!,.\\" Proceedings drew to a close with a chorus of Gloria, laus et honor, and perhaps oaths of homage from the lords to the new king. Assent to the new regime was not universal: the Bishops of London, Rochester and Carlisle abstained from the day's affairs in protest, and Rochester was later beaten up by a London mob because of his opposition.  The King's response  One final action remained to be taken: the ex-King in Kenilworth had to be informed that his subjects had chosen to withdraw their allegiance from him. A delegation was organised to take the news. The delegates were the Bishops of Ely, Hereford and London, and around 30 laymen. Among the latter, the Earl of Surrey represented the lords and Trussell represented the shire knights. The group was intended to be as representative of parliament—and so the kingdom—as possible. It was not composed solely of parliamentarians, but there were enough of them in it to appear parliamentarian. Its size also had the added advantage of spreading collective responsibility far more broadly than would have happened in a small group. They left on or shortly after Thursday 15 January and had arrived in Kenilworth by either 21 or 22 January, when William Trussell asked for the King to be brought to them in the name of parliament. Edward, dressed in a black gown and under the Earl of Lancaster's escort, was brought to the great hall. Geoffrey le Baker's Chronicle describes how the delegates equivocated at first, \\"adulterating the word of truth\\" before coming to the point. Edward was offered the choice of resigning in favour of his son, and being provided for according to his rank, or of being deposed. This, it was emphasised, could lead to the throne being offered to someone, not of royal blood but politically experienced, clearly referring to Mortimer. The King protested—mildly—and wept, fainting at one point. According to Orleton's later report, Edward claimed he had always followed the guidance of his nobles, but regretted any harm he had done. The deposed king took comfort from his son succeeding him. It seems probable that a memorandum of acknowledgement was drawn up between the delegation and Edward, minuting what was said, although this has not survived. Baker says that at the end of the meeting Edward's Steward, Thomas Blunt, dramatically broke his staff of office in half, and dismissed Edward's household. The delegation left Kenilworth for London on 22 January: their news preceded them. By the time they reached Westminster, around 25 January, Edward III was already officially referred to as king, and his peace had been proclaimed at St Paul's Cathedral on the 24th. Now the new king could be proclaimed in public; Edward III's reign was thus dated from 25 January 1327. Behind the scenes, though, discussions must have begun on the thorny question of what to do with his predecessor, who still had not had any judgement—legal or parliamentary—passed upon him.  Subsequent events and aftermath = Recall of parliament = Edward III's political education was deliberately accelerated by the tutelage of advisors such as William of Pagula and Walter de Milemete. Still a minor, Edward III was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 1 February 1327: executive power remained with Mortimer and Isabella. Mortimer was made Earl of March in October 1328, but otherwise, received few grants of land or money. Isabella, on the other hand, gained an annual income of 20,000 marks (£13,333) within the month. She achieved this by requesting the return of her dower which her husband had confiscated; it was returned to her substantially augmented. Ian Mortimer has called the grant she received as amounting to \\"one of the largest personal incomes anyone had ever received in English history\\". Following Edward's coronation parliament was recalled. According to precedent, a new parliament should have been summoned with the accession of a new monarch, and this failure of process indicates the novelty of the situation. Official records regnally date the entire parliament to the first year of Edward III's reign rather than the last of his father's, even though it spread over both. When recalled, parliament returned to its usual business, and heard a large number (42) of petitions from the community. These not only included the political—and often lengthy—petitions related directly to the deposition, but a similar number coming from the clergy and the City of London. This was the greatest number of petitions to have been submitted by the Commons in the history of parliament. Their requests ranged from confirmation of the acts against the Despensers and those in favour of Thomas of Lancaster, to the reconfirmation of the Magna Carta. There were ecclesiastical petitions, and those from the shires dealt mainly in annulling debts and amercements of both individuals and towns. There were numerous requests for the King's grace, for example, overturning perceived false judgements in local courts and concerns for law and order in the localities generally. Restoring law and order was a priority of the new regime, as Edward II's reign had foundered on his inability to do so, and his failure then used to depose him. The principle behind Edward's deposition was, supposedly, to redress such wrongs his reign had caused. One petition requested members of the Commons be authorised to take written confirmation of their petition and its concomitant answer to their localities, while another protested against corrupt local royal officials. This eventually resulted in a proclamation in 1330 instructing individuals who had cause of complaint or need of redress from such should attend the approaching parliament. The Commons too were concerned for the restoration of law and order, and one of their petitions called for the immediate appointment of wide-ranging keepers of the peace who could personally put men on trial. This request was agreed by the King's council. This return to normal parliamentary business demonstrated, it was hoped, both the regime's legitimacy and its ability to repair the injustices of the previous reign. Most of the petitions were accepted—resulting in seventeen statute articles—which indicates how keen Isabella and Mortimer were to placate the Commons. When parliament finally dissolved on 9 March 1327, it had been the second longest, at seventy-one days, of the century to date; further, notes Dodd, because of this it was \\"the only assembly in the late medieval period to outlive a king and see in his successor\\". The dead Earl of Lancaster's titles and estates were restored to his brother Henry, and the 1323 judgement against Mortimer, which exiled him, was overturned. The invaders were also restored to their estates in Ireland. In an attempt at settling the Irish situation, parliament issued ordinances on 23 February pardoning those who had supported Robert Bruce's invasion. The deposed King was referred to only obliquely in official records—for example, as \\"Edward his father, when he was king,\\" \\"Edward, the father of the King who now is\\" or as he had been known as a youth, \\"Edward of Caernarfon\\". Isabella and Mortimer were careful to try to prevent the deposition from tarnishing their reputations, reflected in their concern of not just obtaining Edward II's ex- post facto agreement to his removal, but then publicising his agreement. The problem they faced was that this effectively involved having to rewrite a piece of history in which many people were actively involved and had taken place only two weeks earlier. The City of London also benefited. In 1321, Edward II had disenfranchised London, and royal officials, in the words of a contemporary, had \\"pris[ed] every privilege and penny out of the city\\", as well as deposing their mayor: Edward had ruled London himself through a system of wardens. Gwyn Williams described this as \\"an emergency regime of dubious legality\\". In 1327 Londoners petitioned the recalled parliament for their liberties to be restored, and, since they had been of valuable—probably crucial—importance in enabling the deposition, on 7 March they received not just the rights Edward II had removed from them, but greater privileges than they had ever possessed. = Later events = Meanwhile, Edward II was still imprisoned at Kenilworth, and was intended to stay there forever. Attempts to free him led to his transfer to the more secure Berkeley Castle in early April 1327. Plotting continued, and he was frequently moved to other places. Eventually being returned to Berkeley for good, Edward died there on the night of 21 September. Mark Ormrod described this as \\"suspiciously timely\\", for Mortimer, as Edward's almost-certain murder permanently removed a rival and a target for restoration. Parliamentary proceedings were traditionally drawn up contemporaneously and entered onto a parliament roll by clerks. The Roll of 1327 is notable, according to the History of as Parliament, because \\"despite the highly charged political situation in January 1327, [it] contains no mention of the process by which Edward II ceased to be king\\". The roll only begins with the reassembling of parliament under Edward III in February, after the deposition of his father. It is likely, says Phillips, that since those involved were aware of the precarious legal basis for Edward's deposition—and how it would not bear \\"too close an examination\\"—there may never have been an enrolment: \\"Edward II had been airbrushed from the record\\". Other possible reasons for the lack of an enrolment are that it would never have been entered on a roll because the parliament was clearly illegitimate, or because Edward III later felt it was undesirable to have an official record of a royal deposition in case it suggested a precedent had been set, and removed it himself. It was not long before the crisis affected Mortimer's relationship with Edward III. Notwithstanding Edward's coronation, Mortimer was the country's de facto ruler. The high-handed nature of his rule was demonstrated, according to Ian Mortimer, on the day of Edward III's coronation. Not only did he arrange for his three eldest sons to be knighted, but—feeling a knight's ceremonial robes were inadequate—he had them dressed as earls for the occasion. Mortimer himself occupied his energies in getting rich and alienating people, and the defeat of the English army by the Scots at the Battle of Stanhope Park (and the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton which followed it in 1328) worsened his position. Maurice Keen describes Mortimer as being no more successful in the war against Scotland than his predecessor had been. Mortimer did little to rectify this situation and continued to show Edward disrespect. Edward, for his part, had originally (and unsurprisingly) sympathised with his mother against his father, but not necessarily for Mortimer. Michael Prestwich has described the latter as a \\"classic example of a man whose power went to his head\\", and compares Mortimer's greed to that of the Despensers and his political sensitivity to that of Piers Gaveston. Edward had married Philippa of Hainault in 1328, and they had a son in June 1330. Edward decided to remove Mortimer from the government: accompanied and assisted by close companions, Edward launched a coup d'état which took Mortimer by surprise at Nottingham Castle on 19 October 1330. He was hanged at Tyburn a month later and Edward III's personal reign began.  Scholarship  The parliament of 1327 is the focus of two main areas of interest for historians: in the long term, the part it played in the development of the English parliament, and in the short term, its place in the deposition of Edward II. On the first point, Gwilym Dodd has described the parliament as a landmark event in the institution's history, and, say Richardson and Sayles, it began a fifty-year period of developing and honing procedure. The assembly also, suggests G. L. Harriss, marks a point in the history of the English monarchy in which its authority was curtailed to a similar degree to the limitation previously imposed on King John by the Magna Carta and Henry III by de Montfort. Maddicott agrees with Richardson and Sayles regarding the significance of 1327 for the development of separate chambers, because it \\"saw the presentation of the first full set of commons' petitions [and] the first comprehensive statute to derive from such petitions\\". Maude Clarke described its significance as being in how \\"feudal defiance\\" was for the first time subsumed to the \\"will of the commonality, and the King was rejected not by his vassals but by his subjects\\". The second question it raises for scholars is whether Edward II was deposed by parliament, as an institution, or just while parliament sat. While many of the events necessary for the King's removal had taken place in parliament, others of equal significance (for example, the oath-taking at the Guildhall) occurred elsewhere. Parliament was certainly the public setting for the deposition. Victorian constitutional historians saw Edward's deposition as demonstrating fledgeling authority by the House of Commons akin to their own parliamentary system. Twentieth-century historiography remains divided on the issue. Barry Wilkinson, for example, considered it a deposition—but by the magnates, rather than parliament—but G. L. Harriss termed it an abdication, believing \\"there was no legal process of deposition, and kings like ... Edward II were induced to resign\\". Edward II's position has been summed up as his being offered \\"the choice of abdication in favour of his son Edward or forcible deposition in favour of a new king selected by his nobles\\". Seymour Phillips has argued that it was the \\"combined determination of the leading magnates, their personal followers and the Londoners\\" that Edward should be gone. Chris Bryant argues it is not clear whether these events were driven by parliament, or merely happened to occur in parliament. although he suggests Isabella and Roger Mortimer thought it necessary to have parliamentary support. Valente has suggested \\"the deposition was not revolutionary and did not attack kingship itself\\", it was not \\"necessarily illegal and outside the bounds of the 'constitution'\\", even though historians commonly describe it as such. The discussion is confused further, she says, because varying descriptions are given of the assembly by contemporaries. Some described it as being a royal council, others called it a parliament in the King's absence or a parliament with the Queen presiding, or one summoned by her and Prince Edward. Ultimately, she wrote, it was magnates deciding on policy, and being able to do so through the support of the knights and commoners. Dunham and Wood suggested that Edward's deposition was forced by political rather than legal factors. There is also a choice of who deposed: whether \\"the magnates alone deposed, that the magnates and people jointly deposed, that Parliament itself deposed, even that it was the 'people' whose voice was decisive\\". Ian Mortimer has described how \\"the representatives of the community of the realm would be called upon to act as an authority over and above that of the King\\". It was no advance of democracy, and was not intended to be—its purpose was to \\"unite all classes of the realm against the monarch\\" of the time. John Maddicott has said the proceedings began as a baronial coup but ended up becoming something close to a \\"national plebiscite\\", in which the commons were part of a radical reform of the state. This parliament also clarified procedures, such as codifying petitioning, legislating for it, and promulgating statutes, which would become the norm. The parliament also illustrates how contemporaries viewed the nature of tyranny. The leaders of the revolution, aware that deposition was a barely understood and unpopular concept in the political culture of the day, began almost immediately re-casting events as an abdication instead. Few contemporaries overtly disagreed with Edward's deposition, \\"but the fact of deposition itself caused immense anxiety\\", suggested David Matthews. It was an event as yet unheard of in English history. Phillips comments that \\"using accusations of tyranny to remove a legitimate and anointed king were too contentious and divisive to be of any practical use\\", which is why Edward had been accused of incompetence and inadequacy and much else, and not of tyranny. The Brut Chronicle, in fact, goes so far as to ascribe Edward's deposition, not to intentions of men and women, but to the fulfilment of a prophecy by Merlin. Edward's deposition also set a precedent and laid out arguments for subsequent depositions. The 1327 articles of accusation, for example, were drawn on sixty years later during the series of crises between King Richard II and the Lords Appellant. When Richard refused to attend parliament in 1386, Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester and William Courtenay, Archbishop of Canterbury visited him at Eltham Palace and reminded him how—per \\"the statute by which Edward [II] had been adjudged\\"—a King who did not attend parliament was liable to deposition by his lords. Title page of the earliest published text of Edward II (1594) Indeed, it has been suggested Richard II may have been responsible for the disappearance of the 1327 parliament roll when he recovered personal power two years later. Given-Wilson says that Richard considered Edward's deposition a \\"stain which he was determined to remove\\" from the royal family's history by proposing Edward's canonisation. Richard's subsequent deposition by Henry Bolingbroke in 1399 naturally drew direct parallels with that of Edward. Events which had taken place over 70 years earlier were by 1399 considered \\"ancient custom\\", which had set legal precedent, if an ill-defined one. A prominent chronicle of Henry's usurpation, composed by Adam of Usk, has been described as bearing \\"a striking resemblance\\" to the events of the 1327 parliament. Indeed, said Gaillard Lapsley, \\"Adam uses words that strongly suggest that he had this precedent in mind.\\" Edward II's deposition was used as political propaganda as late as the troubled last years of James I in the 1620s. The King was very ill and played a peripheral role in government; his favourite, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham became proportionately more powerful. Attorney general Henry Yelverton publicly compared Buckingham to Hugh Despenser on account of Villiers' penchant for enriching his friends and relatives through royal patronage. Curtis Perry has suggested that 17th-century \\"contemporaries applied the story [of Edward's deposition] to the political turmoil of the 1620s in conflicting ways: some used the parallel to point towards the corrupting influence of favourites and to criticize Buckingham; others drew parallels between the verbal intemperance of Yelverton and his ilk and the unruliness of Edward's opponents\\". The Parliament of 1327 was the last parliament before the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 to summon Welsh representatives. They never took their seats, having been deliberately summoned too late to attend, because South Wales supported Edward, and North Wales was equally opposed to Mortimer. The 1327 parliament also provided almost the same list of attendees for the next five years of parliaments.  Cultural depictions  Christopher Marlowe was the first to dramatise the life and death of Edward II, with his 1592 play Edward II (or The Troublesome Reign and Lamentable Death of Edward the Second, King of England, with the Tragical Fall of Proud Mortimer). Marlowe emphasises the importance of parliament in Edward's reign, from his original taking of the coronation oath (Act I, scene 1), to his deposition (in Act V, scene 1).

Oakes grew up in rural Pennsylvania, where her concern for the environment began early. She studied ecology in college, where she noticed that scientific papers on the environment received much less attention than popular media. She became a model in New York City, and insisted on only modeling clothing made from organic or recycled materials. These principles cost her work, but gained her notice and the title of world's first \\"eco- model\\". Besides modeling, Oakes has worked as a writer and editor for fashion magazine Lucire, as a television reporter for environmental network Planet Green, and has written three books: Style, Naturally, a shopping guide to eco- friendly fashion and beauty products; SugarDetoxMe, a book of recipes to remove free sugars; and How to Make a Plant Love You on raising plants in an urban homestead. She also co-founded an award winning web site, Le Souk, formerly Source4Style, which connects environmentally conscious fashion designers to ecologically friendly fabric producers. She lives in a loft apartment in Brooklyn which she has filled with over 1100 plants, and formerly a pet chicken, who has now passed.  Early life  Oakes was named Summer Rayne due to being born during a downpour in June 1984. She grew up in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, a town north of Scranton. Oakes's concern for the environment began early: while growing up, she would post photographs of appliances and dead animals left alongside local roads, hoping to shame the owners into removing their litter. While she attended Lakeland High School, she also worked at the Lackawanna County Conservation District biosolids program, which applied treated sewage sludge onto farmland. After graduating, Oakes earned scholarships, including a Udall Scholarship, to Cornell University, where she studied natural resources, ecology, and entomology. There she jointly published two papers on sludge toxicity and contaminants, but she was frustrated by how she couldn't communicate the relevance of her work beyond a narrow audience of scientists, and noticed how much more attention advertising and media received. In 2003, while a student at Cornell, Oakes became involved with \\"The Organic Portraits Project\\", a project to produce a book of photographs about humanity's connection to nature by New York City photographer John F. Cooper that had been put on hold due to the September 11 attacks. Oakes applied for and got a National Wildlife Federation Campus Ecology fellowship for the project, which was instrumental in moving the project forward. The book Organic Portraits: A Photo Book of Polaroid & Film Images was published in 2015.   Career = Model = Behind the scenes at the Pirelli Calendar 2013: (left to right) Summer Rayne Oakes, Petra Němcová, Stuart Chapman, Kyleigh Kühn Oakes began modeling in New York City during her sophomore year in Cornell. Within two months, she was working for lingerie company StockingGirl. When she graduated in 2004, she moved to New York City to model full-time. The title of world's first \\"eco-model\\" was first bestowed on Oakes by Grist Magazine in their 2006 Earth Day issue, since she models only clothes made from organic or recycled materials. The moniker has since been taken up by multiple newspapers in the US, UK, and Canada.  These principles lost her multiple campaigns and her first New York City modeling agency contract, before she signed with Faith Kates of Next Model Management, who approved of them. In 2007, Oakes was profiled in Vanity Fair's \\"Green Issue\\", and was featured in a CNN video interview as part of the series \\"Young People Who Rock\\". In 2011, Oakes represented Aveeno beauty products in creating a temporary \\"pop-up\\" forest in Times Square. She also appeared in an environmental short film, eXtinction, which was shown at festivals around the world. She was photographed for the 2013 Pirelli Calendar by Steve McCurry. In 2012, designers for the Toyota Prius C said that they created the subcompact hybrid electric vehicle with Oakes in mind and named the \\"Summer Rain Metallic\\" paint color after her. Ironically, since Oakes lives in New York City, she does not drive. = Activist = Copenhagen Fashion Summit Oakes says she sees modeling as \\"a conduit to get into socially responsible causes\\" such as fair trade and pollution from the textile and garment industry. Since 2009, she has worked to promote the Mezimbite Forest Center conservation project in Mozambique. She spoke about fair trade and the textile industry at the Hong Kong World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2005 and attended the 2012 \\"Rio+20\\" United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, where she was profiled by the magazine of the United Nations Environment Programme. She teaches others to grow plants in a Brooklyn neighborhood community garden. = Writer = Oakes holding her book SugarDetoxMe in her plant-covered apartment, in 2017 Oakes was interviewed in New Zealand fashion magazine Lucire in April 2005. She went on to write for the magazine, starting with \\"Behind the Label\\", a series of articles on ethical and sustainable fashion designers. Oakes became Lucires acting editor for two issues in 2006, then US editor in 2007, and editor-at-large since then, contributing stories on body image, fair trade, and trends in sustainable design. She hosted the 2007 season of Singapore-based environmental television program Eco 4 the World. In 2008, Oakes became an environmental reporter on Planet Green, an environmental-focused network from Discovery Communications. She served as a correspondent for the program G Word, during which she reported from a methane-recapture farm, climbed windmills, and swam in the Pacific Trash Vortex. She had her own environmentally friendly fashion and beauty advice column \\"Ask Summer Rayne\\" on the Planet Green web site. Discovery relaunched Planet Green with a different focus in 2012. Oakes launched her first book, Style, Naturally, in early 2009. It is a shopping guide to eco-friendly fashion and beauty products. SugarDetoxMe began as a 2014 blog and website to document Oakes's 30-day removal of free sugars from her diet, then grew to a program to help others do the same. In 2017, it was joined by a book of recipes of the same name, partly based on Dr. Mark Hyman's book The Blood Sugar Solution; Hyman also endorses Oakes's program. Oakes teaching at a New York City community garden, in 2018 Oakes's third book, How to Make a Plant Love You: Cultivating Your Personal Green Space, scheduled for July 2019, grew out of her experiences with the hundreds of plants she cultivated in her apartment and is accompanied by a website \\"Homestead Brooklyn\\", a YouTube series \\"Plant One On Me\\", and an online course \\"Houseplant Masterclass\\". Also published as = Entrepreneur = In April 2009, Oakes partnered with Payless ShoeSource to create \\"Zoe & Zac\\", a line of eco-friendly low-priced shoes and accessories. Products were made of organic cotton, linen, hemp, jute, recycled rubber, and water-based glues and priced at or below $30. Her website, Le Souk, formerly Source4Style, founded with business partner Benita Singh in 2010, connects environmentally conscious fashion designers to small-scale, ecologically friendly fabric producers. Oakes says that up to 85% of a designer's time is spent sourcing fabric, and the site eases this task for the designer and makes sustainable design possible. Oakes says that companies listed on the site were put through a sustainability questionnaire based on the Eco Index, and their certifications were checked. The site also contains articles about sustainable fashion. Celebrity \\"curators\\", including Amanda Hearst, Angela Lindvall, and Ada Zanditon, wrote content for the site. Source4Style won a 2011 Cartier Women's Initiative Award, including $20,000.  Home  Oakes and Kippee, repotting a Monstera in her home, in 2018 Since 2005, Oakes has lived in a loft apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which she has filled with plants: over 500 plants by 2016, and 670 by 2017. A bedroom served as the headquarters of Source4Style for the company's first 18 months. When the company left, Oakes began transforming the room into an indoor vertical garden. Her first plant was a Ficus lyrata, which had grown to tall and conformed to the ceiling by 2016. Other plants include herbs, sweet potatoes, pineapples, bananas, and her favorite genus, Peperomia. Her kitchen hosts a mason-jar plant garden that Oakes built with her father, as well as compost and vermiculture bins. A closet is filled with kitchen plants, succulents live in the bathroom, and vines drape over walls and furniture.

The four syndics sat in the Senate with the senators and took part in the debates, but had no vote. The office, at that time, was somewhat analogous to that of a cabinet minister (which did not exist as such in Hamburg). To them were entrusted all important negotiations, and the preparation of every legislative enactment.Westminster Review Vol 37 Oct 1842, publ.Joseph Mason, New York (US ed.); p.225 A syndicus ranked between a mayor and a senator and had the title \\"Magnificence\\".Die diplomatischen Beziehungen zwischen Deutschland und Japan 1854-1868 (Diplomatic relations between Germany and Japan 1854-1868) by Holmer Stahncke, publ. Franz Steiner Verlag (), December 1, 1987; p.73 Sieveking was one of the most influential figures in Hamburg in the first half of the 19th century.Joist Grolle: Sieveking, Karl. In: Hamburgische Biografie. Vol. 3, Göttingen 2006, S. 361–363, hier: S. 361. Among the many traces he left behind in his hometown include the Rauhes Haus, the Kunstverein and the former country estate Hammer Park. Origins The Sieveking family was originally from Westphalia and was a merchant family based in Hamburg since the middle of the 18th century. The son of the merchant Georg Heinrich Sieveking, he was originally intended to become a merchant as well. His mother, Johanna Margaretha Sieveking, was the daughter of the physician, natural historian and economist Johann Albert Heinrich Reimarus. Early life His mother promoted early the artistic interests of her son and sent him, after the death of his father, to the Katharineum in Lübeck, the Academic School of the Johanneum and the Academic Gymnasium in Hamburg. At the graduation ceremony, August Neander (with whom he remained friends all his life) and he gave speeches in Latin.Karl Sieveking und David Mendel: Duo oratiunculae: Gehalten beim Abgang vom Johanneum im Jahre 1805 = Zwei lateinische Reden. Gesellschaft der Bücherfreunde, Hamburg 1956. He then studied law and political science at Göttingen, and Heidelberg universities from 1806 to 1810. After a brief period as secretary to his uncle Charles-Frédéric Reinhard, who was French Minister Plenipotentiary in the Kingdom of Westphalia, Sieveking first went back to Göttingen, obtaining a post-doctoral qualification. But during the climax of the Napoleonic Wars, he participated in setting-up the Burgher Militia of Hamburg and moved there in 1815. In 1819, Sieveking was appointed as the envoy of the Hanseatic cities (Hamburg, Lübeck and Bremen) in St. Petersburg. Syndicus Then in 1820 he was elected as a syndicus of the Hamburg Senate. In this office, too, Sieveking worked primarily in the field of foreign relations. For example, he participated in the drafting of the Elbe Shipping Agreement (21 June 1821) which provided for duty-free trade on the Elbe. In 1827 he negotiated a trade agreement in Rio de Janeiro with the newly independent Brazil and opened the lucrative South American market to Hamburg merchants. After 1830, he represented Hamburg at the Diet of the German Confederation in Frankfurt am Main. In 1841, the New Zealand Company proposed to establish a German colony in the Chatham Islands, which lie 500 miles east of New Zealand. John Ward for the company signed an agreement with Sieveking on 12 September 1841. However, when the Colonial Office said any Germans settling there would be treated as aliens, the proposed leader of the venture, John Beit, took the expedition to Nelson, New Zealand instead. Their ship was named Sankt Pauli. Sieveking continued as Syndicus until his death and was succeeded by Carl Merck, who was elected in his place the next month in July1847.Hamburg, Deutschland und die Welt, 2nd ed. 1952, by Percy Ernst Schramm, publ Hoffmann & Campe; p. 212Hamburgischer Staats Kalender 1846, publ. by Friedrich Hermann Nestler and Melle, Hamburg, 1846 However, one of the existing Syndics, Edward Banks, was now entrusted with the direction of foreign affairs.Edward Banks in General German Biography (ADB ) de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Banks,_Edward Retrieved Jan 2018 Other work In addition to his diplomatic and political duties, Sieveking worked as a promoter of numerous artists of his time and also the Hamburg Artists Association (1832). In addition, he made it possible to found the Rauhe Haus for neglected children by giving Johann Hinrich Wichern a piece of land from his private property.

History Samuel Frearson (1845 – 22 September 1887), Septimus Frearson (1849 – 23 August 1932) and Robert Sands Frearson (c. 1853 – 26 January 1937) were born in London and emigrated with their parents Alfred Frearson (c. 1811–1867) and Frances Frearson (c. 1809–1898) and other siblings (10 in all) aboard Cotfield, arriving in Adelaide in November 1853. Alfred and Frances took up land at Kanmantoo and later purchased Dr. Benjamin Archer Kent's residence and property at Kent Town. Samuel began in business in 1868 as a stationer and bookseller in Kent Town, and was joined a year later by Septimus, trading as \\"Frearson Brothers\\", with a shop in Rundle Street; moved to 58 King William Street in 1872; the business became Frearson & Brother in 1873. In 1878 they secured a twenty-year lease on a building on the Gresham Street corner of King William Street which they named Frearson's Chambers, much of which they sub-let profitably. They took in solicitor Alfred Bonnin (c. 1829 – 1910) as a partner and in 1882 they built Beaconsfield Buildings on the old King William site. They built new premises, Frearson's Printing House opposite the Sturt Hotel on Grenfell Street in 1882. The company published Frearson's Weekly, The Illustrated Adelaide News 1874–1880, Frearson's Monthly Illustrated Adelaide News 1881–1884 and The Pictorial Australian as well as a series of Almanacs, several handbooks: Frearson's Handbook to the Goldfields of West Australia (6th ed. 1894); Portonian Cartoon Album (1874) They had a shop in King William Street, then removed to North Terrace before 1894, then to Grenfell Street. Samuel caught an infection in 1884 while on a world cruise aboard the new steamer City of Rome. He never fully recovered, and died three years later. In the 1880s the printing shop was moved to Adam Street, Hindmarsh, and in 1888 was acquired by W. H. Burford & Sons. Septimus moved with his family to Western Australia in 1895, settling in Norseman, where he published the Norseman Pioneer, the first newspaper on the Dundas goldfields. He was elected mayor of Norseman in 1898. In 1914 he went to Dowerin to manage the farm of one of his sons, who was fighting overseas. When that son was killed, Frearson retired to Applecross, where he died. Robert was engaged in business in the city up to 1891, when he was sent by his brothers to Western Australia to represent Frearsons' Printing House in Perth. Eventually he took over the management of Frearsons Printing House in Adelaide, which position he held until the firm changed hands. He then went into the advertising and publishing business on his own account. As a young man Mr. Frearson was an active member of the Church of Christ at Grote street and Glenelg, and took a considerable interest in the Northern Territory, especially mining. He died at his home in L'Estrange Street, Knoxville (modern-day Glenside or Glenunga), leaving a widow, four sons, and three daughters. Frearson's Printing House was still a going concern in 1962, with premises at 83 Sturt Street, Adelaide and 20a Adam Street, Hindmarsh, though it is likely the Frearson family by then had no interest in the business. Family The children of Alfred Frearson (c. 1811–1867) and Frances Frearson (c. 1809 – 11 December 1898) include: *Emma Frearson (c. 1834 – 26 October 1907), their only daughter, married William Trevett Dalwood (c. 1834 – 22 August 1909) on 6 September 1855 *John Black Frearson (c. 1841 – 11 March 1884), general dealer of Wakefield Street, married Mary Ann \\"Annie\\" Frearson, née Young (c. 1850 – 1 August 1892) in 1866; (Young/Frearson was an adopted daughter of A.& F.

Origins The union had its roots in dissident New South Wales railway workers who had refused to join the 1917 general strike. The dissident workers had formed two unions in the wake of the strike: the New South Wales Government Railways Permanent Way Association and the Association of Employees (Mechanical Branch) of the New South Wales Railways. A subsequent Labor state government had allowed the deregistered Australian Railways Union to be reregistered at state level and had stripped the dissident unions of their registration. A later Nationalist Party of Australia government had reregistered the dissident unions, which had then been revoked again by Labor under Jack Lang. The two dissident unions amalgamated to form the Railway Service Association on 6 June 1930. The association then formed a new union, the National Union of Railwaymen in October 1932, with the intention of seeking federal registration as a union. Walter Skelton, a former New South Wales state MP, served as union secretary. The union and its predecessors were often referred as the \\"loyalist\\" union, which the union secretary stated that was because they had refused to \\"associate with strike-mad theorists\\" or \\"adhere to any political party\\"; many sources noted that they were frequently known as the \\"scab\\" union. Its constitution covered all railway workers at all levels, giving it the coverage of \\"one big union\\" covering railway workers throughout the Commonwealth if workers so chose. 1933 registration attempt The union's first attempt at registration in late 1932 was withdrawn due to \\"technical irregularities\\". A second attempt at registration, in January 1933, met with strong opposition from the unions, with many unions – variously reported as being between 17 and 23 – opposing the application before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, including the Australian Railways Union, the Federation of Salaried Officers of Railway Commissioners, the Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees' Association, and the Australian Workers' Union. The opposing unions dismissed the union as not being \\"bona fide\\" on the basis that only 206 members of the 5,000 in the Railway Service Association and of the 90,000 workers in the industry had joined the new union, while claiming that the union rules made the executive \\"a junta able to exercise despotic power\\". Other unions opposed \\"new organisations coming in to divide workers already properly catered for\\". The case highlighted the strong ongoing antipathy between the Australian Railways Union and the dissident unions seeking to form the NUR. Several NUR members gave evidence that they had refused to join the ARU because they saw it as affiliated with Russia and inconsistent with Catholic beliefs. NUR officials had campaigned against the NSW Labor government of Jack Lang at the 1932 election, citing Lang's previous attempts to deregister them and their belief that some of Lang's legislation \\"bordered on Sovietism\\"; in return, they claimed during the case that feared that they would lose their jobs if Lang returned to government in the future. They were at times met with a strong response from the existing unions: NSW state MP Abe Landa publicly labelled the NUR a \\"corrupt organisation\\" which existed to \\"satisfy the personal ambitions of certain NUR officials\\" and described their witnesses as \\"weak, twisting and vacillating\\", while alleging that the NUR had violated its own rules. On 30 March 1933, the Industrial Court granted their application for registration, finding that because of their history they had the same rights as the Australian Railways Union and that they had shown that their members could not \\"conveniently belong\\" to the ARU. All the opposing unions immediately resolved to co-operate in an appeal to the full bench of the Industrial Court, which was lodged in early April. The NUR then moved to absorb the membership of the Railway Service Association and to wind down that organisation. In media coverage following the decision, Skelton highlighted the union's detailed constitutional provisions against political activity, while Fletcher proudly stated that they had never resorted to strike action. The NUR's 1933 conference, while expressing gratitude for the defeat of the Lang government, was sharply critical of the conservative Stevens NSW government for reintroducing the 48-hour week and opposing wage increases. In hearings on the appeal, the NUR claimed to have actually had 5000 members, while the Australian Workers' Union claimed that it was \\"a phantom body without funds\\". On 13 July 1933, the full bench upheld the appeal against registration \\"with regret\\" on a technicality, as the NUR had \\"not accompanied [their application] with a list of branches of the National Union with appurtenant particulars.\\" The Chief Judge, while allowing the appeal, noted the \\"bitter and continuous hostility\\" between the unions and stated that if they \\"became members of the [ARU] they would fail to obtain a fair proportional share of control or influence in the activities of that union.\\" The NUR continued its advocacy at the NSW state level after its failure to gain federal registration, campaigning for a 44-hour week, opposing legal action to defend railway staff blamed for an accident, opposing reduction of fares and freight dues on the basis that funds should be directed towards increasing wages instead, and opposing various wage reductions. In September 1933, Skelton announced that the union would set up a \\"Reduction of Taxation League\\", advocating for a drastic reduction in taxation on a cross-party basis. In October 1933, the NUR succeeded in a Conciliation Court application that around 200 NUR and non-union workers receive the same wages and conditions as union workers covered by a federal award. In February 1935, the union succeeded in negotiating a 44-hour week for their members. In March 1935, the union was successful in bringing their entire membership of NSW railway employees within the federal award and basic wage. The union had launched its own publication, the \\"Railway Advocate\\", by the late 1930s. 1938 registration In March 1938, the NUR made a third and ultimately successful bid for federal registration as a union. In April 1938, it merged with another small union, the Government Railways Transport Staff Association. The union was finally federally registered in December 1938. The ARU appealed against the decision, but the Industrial Registrar upheld the registration in May 1939. By 1940, it was reported that the NUR had commenced organising in South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, and a Tasmanian branch was inaugurated by dissident former ARU members that August. After strong opposition to the NUR from the Launceston Trades Hall Council, the Tasmanian state Labor government quickly confirmed that they would not recognise the NUR in that state. Nonetheless, the new state branch elected their first state executive in September 1940; by that time, the branch was reported to have 167 registered members and to be \\"well established\\". It was reported in October 1940 that the ARU-NUR conflict at the Launceston rail yards had reached the stage where some workers were refusing to complete work begun by members of the opposite union. The union changed its name from the National Union of Railwaymen to the National Union of Rail Workers in 1982. Amalgamation In 1993 the NUR amalgamated with the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen (AFULE), Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees' Association (ATMOEA) and Australian Railways Union (ARU) to form the Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union (ARTBIU), also known as the Public Transport Union (PTU).

Created by the architecte Frédéric Keiff in 2007, it looks like a palaver tree, whose trunk and branches are made of painted iron rods, while attached fragments of colored glass represent leaves. The artwork The Arbre à Palabre by Frédéric Keiff is a palaver tree whose trunk and branches are made of painted iron rods, while attached fragments of colored glass represent leaves. The installation is more than 5 meters tall with a canopy circumference of 7 meters, and it is equipped with wooden slabs embedded in the trunk, serving as benches. It is a passageway installation. Initially conceived to substitute the former palaver tree of Douala, a huge baobab located in the district of Bonaberi, which fell down in 1993, the symbolic meaning of the installation forced some changes in the process. Traditionally, around the palaver tree, the chief of the village and the council members (the so-called notables) meet and seat in order to take the most important political and social decisions concerning the community, and it is there that tradition values were orally transmitted through generations. This artwork became the subject of a long discussion between the chief of the village and the notables, who finally decided to forbid a foreign artist to place his artwork next to the rest of the former palaver tree. However, it was important that Keiff’s installation was positioned in a public space, easily accessible to inhabitants in order to guarantee that the contemporary palaver tree would keep on holding its symbolic function as a meeting, discussion, and sharing point. The superior chief of Douala, the Prince René Duala Manga Bell, offered one of his properties in Bonanjo for repositioning the Arbre à Palabre that was inaugurated for SUD 2007 and officially donated to the city of Douala. The park where the Arbre à Palabre is located belongs to the Bell family, even if the installation itself is in the public domain. This area is surrounded by three historical monuments of Douala: to the North, the Vault of kings Bell, where today the same René Douala Manga Bell lies; to the South, the Espace doual'art (funding agency of the project) from which one can clearly see the Palace of the Kings Bell, commonly known as “La Pagode”, built in 1905 by German colonizers for the king Auguste Manga Ndoumbe; and, finally, to the West, the Old law court building.

The single source to the events is from a 1864 book of the same name, which describes it as an important event in the introduction of Christianity to Vietnam. Background During Lord Trịnh Sâm's rule, there are two Dominican missionaries in Hanoi: Jacinta Castañeda, a Spaniard and Vicente Liem de la Paz, a native Vietnamese. The mother of the Lord's uncle, Lady Thượng Trâm is a devout Christian and she wishes his son to convert. Trịnh Sâm's uncle is still undecided, as the majority of royalties still follow Taoist and folk beliefs. As a result, he invites the two Christian missionaries, a Confucian priest, a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk to the Lord's palace to debate on their religious views. Three days debate The debate took place in three days, in which each representative will present and discuss on three different topics: *First day debate:The origins of mankind, where do humans come from? On this question, the Confucian official states that everything comes from Taiji, Taiji gives birth to Yin and Yang, these two in turn create the Five Elements that is the basis of everything. Which the missionaries ask \\"What is in the beginning that make Taiji move?\\" The Taoist priest explains what is written in the Tao De Jing: \\"The Tao makes one, one makes two, two makes three and the three makes everything. The Tao itself is from nothing\\". Which the missionaries inquire \\"What is Tao? How can something be created from nothing?\\" The Buddhist monk makes reference to the Heart Sutra and proclaims Buddha-hood as the source of life, which the Christian say if Buddha was born during the Zhou dynasty era, how could he had created the world. The missionaries then tell the council how God created the world in six days, in 6,000 years ago. That everyone on Earth are descendants of Adam and Eve hence they are all brothers and sisters. To which the Confucian remarks that this is a merely a Western tradition, as no book from the East have mentioned about the Christian God. *Second day: What is the present human condition? How should we live our lives? The Confucian presents about Confucianism ethics and virtues. The missionaries and priests then debate on whether the Confucian Shangdi and the Abrahamic God is the same and only. The Daoist priest gives his views on the Wu wei philosophy, which the Christians criticize as passive and regressive. The Buddhist monk also discuss Buddhist ethics, to which the Christians question about punishment if these ethics were not met. The Confucian then inquire about Christianity, claiming its also superstitious, citing the reverence of saints. He also questions the banning of idolatry and the worship of Jesus: \\"If Jesus saves everyone from sin, did he also save Shennong or Fuxi? Why did not God himself save the people, not forcing Jesus to die?\\". The Confucian also question the Nativity, and the problem of being both Christian and continuing worship one's ancestor. The Buddhist monk then claims that Buddha and Jesus were both sons of the Jade Emperor, but Jesus was punished to Earth and had to suffer the Passion. *Third day: What is the meaning of life?

Biography  Pabich was born in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, the eldest child of Francis and Rosemary Pabich. He came to the Castro district of San Francisco, California during the 1970s amid a migration of gay and bisexual men. Pabich came out to his parents at Harvey Milk's request, as Milk asked gays across the country to come out to their friends and families to show that nearly everyone knew a gay person. Pabich was instrumental to Milk's career as an activist and politician. Pabich helped to organize and manage Milk's campaigns for public office from 1974 to 1977 and his influence was widely in evidence after Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977. Pabich earned a reputation as an aggressive, charming and savvy political strategist many would seek for advice. Pabich served as a legislative aide to Milk until Milk's assassination in November 1978. Pabich was one of the founders of the Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club in 1976. With the onset of the AIDS epidemic, the Milk Club was an early advocate of closing down the city's gay bathhouses. The club also created some of the earliest safe sex education materials in the United States. Pabich was the campaign manager for Harry Britt, who was appointed to succeed Milk following his assassination. Pabich is also credited with helping the political careers of California Assemblywoman Carole Migden and United States Senator Barbara Boxer. Pabich managed several Northern California campaigns to defeat anti-gay state ballot initiatives in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Death and legacy  After his retirement from full-time politics and move to the East Bay, Pabich remained as an unofficial advisor to San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown on LGBTQ and AIDS issues. Pabich has been credited with playing a primary role in shaping AIDS policies across the United States. He lost his hardest fight with AIDS January 1, 2000. Mayor Brown ordered city flags to be flown at half-staff in San Francisco. = Portrayal in popular culture = In the 2008 feature film Milk, the role of Dick Pabich was played by Joseph Cross.

It is the fourth oldest Baptist church in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The First Baptist Church of Sutton was organized, in 1735. With the exception of a ten- year period of being inactive, in the war years from 1775 to 1785, there have been almost steady services of worship and activities carried on by the men and women of this church. The first structure (1750) was located just down the road where Sutton High School is now, the second (1792) was built on where the current police and fire departments are, and third structure was built on what is now Central Turnpike in 1829 and is part of the West Sutton Historic District with the Fellowship Hall added in 1959. The sanctuary building is in the Greek Revival style of the time. The church is tied to many of the historic families that have and still call Sutton home. Among the names we read the names of Putnam, Buard, Waters, Davis, Freeland, Brigham, King, Marble, Titus, Rich, Dana, Merriam, Lamb, Sibley, Shaw, Moore, Burdon, Luther, Whittier, Plummer, Wallace, Leonard. First Baptist Church is part of the North American Missions Board Revitalize and Replant effort in New England stopping the 17 churches that close every week in America. Through the years the church has been also known through the town and region as Legacy Church, First Baptist Sutton, West Sutton Baptist Church, Sutton Baptist Church, Baptist Meetinghouse, and its original founding name by Rev. Marsh, The Frontier Church.  History =1700s= Second Building from the 1780s The original Baptist Church in Sutton was organized on September 19, 1735. James Bound had begun a group of Baptists meeting in the town prior to the date, and encouraged the organization of a church in the town. In 1737, Benjamin Marsh and Thomas Green were both ordained as co-pastors of the church. Green would leave with a group to Leicester to start a Baptist church there, in the Rochdale village, today known as Greenville Baptist Church. Marsh would go on to lead the First Baptist for over 40 years (still the longest tenure), seeing the church grow in life and vigor from the events of the Great Awakening. The first building was erected in 1750, at the corner of Hutchinson and Boston Roads. The second was built on Freeland Hill, this building had no steeple or bell. It was later moved to Braman Village and is now between the West Milbury and Sutton Roads and serves as the home of the Sutton Historical Society. Shortly after Rev. Marsh's passing, the church was partially dissolved due to the wars in America, but the members reorganized the church in 1785 and elder Ebenezer Lamson was chosen as the new pastor until he was voted out following his admission in beliefs of teachings that were against orthodox theology. In 1792, Rev. William Batchellor who was the pastor of First Baptist, organized the Second Baptist Church/Manchaug Baptist Church in South Sutton (the building was the original second structure of First Baptist and moved for their use in 1842) which today is the Historical Society's. =1800s= The church was active during the 100-year anniversary celebrations of the founding of Sutton. Under Rev. Samuel Waters the church grew to over 100 people and was no longer able to fit in the second building for one service. The congregation voted to and raised money to build their third and the current sanctuary building which would house 250 people total and included a balcony/choir loft. The present edifice was built in 1829 in a more central location in West Sutton. It was dedicated on Sept. 16, 1830. Hand-hewn lumber was used for the Greek Revival temple front of the structure was a form widely employed by congregations of all denominations in the early to mid decades of the 19th century. The steeple was of the Christopher Wren type. The lovely old bell was cast in Medway, Mass. by G.H. Holbrook in 1829, one of the first church bells to be cast in the United States. The old choir loft was closed and pew doors were taken off in the 1890s, only one of these pews from the original 1829 building remains in the enclosed loft leading up to the bell tower. The 1800s would see short terms from a number of pastors, many of whom were older and near retirement, with a few dying during their term as pastor. The Civil War would also play havoc on the pastoral terms as three men would pastor the church at about the same time because of service commitments to the Union Army. The church would be closed off and on for the years of the war because of this, with the elders leading services and other functions of the church. =1900s= The church during the 1904 Bi-centennial celebrations of Sutton's founding had Rev. Arthur Davis represent the church at all the festivities and functions. Several houses in West Sutton were used as a parsonage until, in 1915, the Church purchased a large house nearby. The one hundredth anniversary of the building of the church was celebrated, in 1929. A cellar was dug under the church, affording space for a furnace, and the two big wood stoves were removed. The interior was redecorated. Electric lights were installed in memory of Mr. C.S. Jones, who had been a member of the Men's Sunday School Class, known as the \\"Knights of the Wheel.\\" A Woman's Community Organization, known as \\"The Hillside Club,\\" was organized in 1906 to aid this church financially and to be of benefit to the community, and the members had always been ready and willing to raise extra funds when needed. In 1950, the club spent $100 beautifying the Community Hall and $400 towards the redecoration expenses. A Christian Endeavor Society was first formed in the 1890s, but later discontinued — until 1936 when it was revived. It has been a very vital and important part in the life of the church and the community, carrying on many worthwhile projects. Among the improvements made at this time were a new choir section made to the right of the stage area. New pews were bought for this project, but because they didn't match the interior of the church, this caused some issues with older families of the church. a maroon velveteen curtain was placed in the area to cover this up. They held religious services Sunday evenings as well as mornings at this time. The church lost several tiers of its steeple in the 1938 hurricane but otherwise looks much as it did in the engraving in the original town history. The horse sheds to the west of the building were torn down. The 1938 hurricane blew down the beautiful Christopher Wren-type steeple, damaging other parts of the building. In 1938, modern improvements were introduced. The men of the parish capped over the second section of the steeple and a fund has been started to build a new spire. In 1938, the Church felt the need for a larger place in which to hold activities of different kinds. The large two-story building next door was bought for a parish house and community hall for the use of the church and community. This building had been, for many years, a real \\"old time\\" country store and post office. It is being improved and modernized. The first well, drilled in 1949, supplied the church, parish hall and parsonage. A new organ was given to the church by the Hillside Club, in 1910, and this was electrified, in 1948, through the efforts of the Club and Choir. In 1951, The very important project of re-plastering and painting the whole interior of the Church was undertaken, in 1950. Money had been earned with auctions, suppers, movies and a Bazaar. A contractor was hired, but, in order to save money, the men and women of the Church and community cleaned and painted the pews and floor. The paint was donated by members of the Church. In removing old paint from the pews, it was found that the trim is solid mahogany. This trim restored, gives the white pews their original beauty. A beautiful maroon velveteen Choir Curtain, Dossal Curtain and draperies to match at the two south windows are now installed. In 1950, there were sixty-three members. A new hall has been added to the east side in 1959 to accommodate the growing congregation with classroom space under it with access to the 2.5 acres of land behind the structures. In the late 1990s the sanctuary was refurbished again and the balcony area was covered up as well as four pew areas reducing the capacity to about 180 to this day. =2000s= The church had been affiliated with the Triennial Convention and American Baptist but in 2003 joined the Southern Baptist Convention, through the Baptist Convention of New England, when the Rev. Edward Pentland and church leadership voted to join a more conservative denomination. The back of the church has a baseball field and basketball court that was in use by the town for many years until the town built new town ball fields and a soccer field complex on Central Turnpike. In 2004 the church replaced their rotting wooden sign with a newer lighted one and message board. The fellowship hall also was used as a meeting space for the local gun club, police and fire unions, flower club, Alcoholics Anonymous, and other groups in Sutton. Rev. Pentland retired in June 2017, having the church in April 2017, call Rev. Donald J. McKinnon to become its new pastor. 2017 saw the church begin a web and social media presence by launching its own website, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, as well as begin the #ForSutton hashtag. The church recently rejoined Sutton's Chain of Lights Christmas celebrations.

Her scholarly articles on ethnomusicology have been featured in several journals. She and her husband Joel Levin were featured in the media for co-founding Stop Sexual Assault in Schools (SSAIS) in Portland, OR, which advocates for preventing sexual violence in K-12 schools.  Activism  Warkov and her husband Joel Levin were widely covered by the media in 2016, including in the Huffington Post, The Washington Post, Slate, and NPR, after revealing their daughter was raped in 2012 while on a school field trip. This inspired them in 2015 to found a non-profit organization called Stop Sexual Assault in Schools (SSAIS). SSAIS educates parents about Title IX protections and teaches them how to file official complaints in response to known misconduct, which the couple said took them years to figure out. In January 2018, SSAIS was credited for creating the #MeTooK12 spinoff of the #MeToo hashtag, and is meant to raise awareness of the widespread prevalence of sexual misconduct towards children in K-12 educational settings.  Musical research  Warkov has published many scholarly articles, recordings, articles, and reviews on how music is related to society, especially music from Irish, Welsh, and Middle Eastern cultures. Her music research has been mentioned in books such as Ethnomusicological Encounters with Music and Musicians by Timothy Rice, Jewish Topographies: Visions of Space, Traditions of Place by Julia Brauch and Anna Lipphardt, and others.

After the expedition, Hime returned to Toronto and continued to work at the firm Armstrong, Beere and Hime, Civil Engineers Draughtsmen, and Photographists, and eventually held several municipal offices. The firm had produced the Armstrong, Beere and Hime panorama in 1857, the earliest known photographs of Toronto. In 1860, Hime established his own brokerage firm despite having no experience in stocks or brokerage, a trait shared with nearly half of Toronto's brokers at the time. Hime joined the Toronto Stock Exchange the following year, remaining a member until its collapse in 1869, and joined its replacement in 1871 and retained his membership until 1898. As a member of the TSE, he held various executive positions including Committee Member, Secretary, Treasurer, Vice President, and President.  Early life and emigration  Hime was born in Moy, Co. Armagh, Ireland on 17 September 1833. At 15, he travelled to England to pursue an education in business and manufacturing. Moving to Canada in 1854, he soon acquired work with surveying crews in the Bruce Peninsula, working under W. H. Napier. In 1856, Hime joined the firm Armstrong and Beere, and by December of that year was made a junior partner with the firm changing its name to Armstrong, Beere and Hime. While the precise date is unknown, the firm produced four sets of photographs of the city of Toronto, either in 1856 or 1857, the first comprehensive series of photographs of the city. The sets were included in Toronto's unsuccessful application to the Colonial Office to become the capital of Canada.  The 1858 Hind Expedition  In the mid-nineteenth century, a Canadian expansionist movement was blossoming. Wanting to expand westwards into territory owned by the Hudson's Bay Company, proponents of expansion needed to convince legislators and Canadians that moving westwards was feasible and beneficial. To this point, the north-west had only been seen as a fur-trading hinterland, impossible to settle due to the inhospitable landscape of the Canadian Shield. To do so, several expeditions were funded by the Canadian and British governments in order to assess the viability of agrarian settlements in Rupert's Land. In 1857, expeditions led by Captain John Palliser and another led by George Gladman (and later Henry Youle Hind) were sent west to conduct land surveys. Both parties did not venture more than two hundred miles north of the American border, exposing them to the oft-overlooked prairie region. Their analyses of this region caused expansionists to argue that western settlement was more viable than once thought. Following his return from the Gladman Expedition, Henry Youle Hind, a professor of geology at the University of Toronto was financed to undertake a second expedition to the western interior. Hime was approached by Hind in the Spring of 1858 and asked him to join the expedition as a photographer. It is speculated that Hind initially heard of Hime either through Hime's business partner William Armstrong, who was also a member of the Canadian Institute, or through W. H. Napier, who had partaken in the 1857 expedition with Hind.Great Britain, Parliament, House of Commons, Papers Relative to the Exploration of the Country between Lake Superior and the Red River Settlement (London: House of Commons, 1859), 19. CIHM no. 88996. The pair concluded negotiations in April, and Hime settled on the rate of £20 per month. Departing from Toronto on 29 April, the expedition moved to Detroit, through the Great Lakes to Grand Portage, where they canoed to the Red River settlement, arriving 1 June. Upon their arrival, Hime took the first photograph of western Canada. He brought with him over 200 glass plates required for photo development, but it is unknown exactly how many photographs were taken, and only eight survived to 1975. Hime encountered unexpected resistance from natives whose photographs he tried to take, as they feared that the photographs would be used later to have them killed or removed from their lands. Hime's performance on the expedition is subject to question. While Hind had initially been satisfied with Hime's conduct, he later wrote that Hime had \\"...neglected his duty, and proved a very undesirable companion on an expedition of this kind, retarding its progress and work.\\" Hind did not elaborate in his complaints, but he may have been unsatisfied with the photographs Hime was taking, and the quality of those developed. With photography in its infancy, controlled environmental conditions (humidity, temperature) were critical for clear photographs. In the western interior, however, these conditions could not be controlled, and Hime relied on stream water for developing his photographs. However, the photographs did alter perceptions of the West. Instead of being seen as either tundra or an arctic wasteland, photographs of plains reinforced the belief that suitable agricultural settlements could be established. Hind described the \\"fertile belt\\" of the prairies and the forested region to the north. In doing so, prominent politicians such as Thomas D'Arcy McGee would argue a decade later than \\"the future of the Dominion depends on our early occupation of the rich prairie land.\\" In 1870 the Red River colony would be incorporated into the new province of Manitoba, and in 1873, the heart of the Red River colony, then Fort Garry, would become the city of Winnipeg. Upon returning to Toronto, Hime returned to working with Armstrong, Beere and Hime, and was responsible for developing the photographs to be submitted with the final report. He enlisted the help of his partner Daniel Beere, charging $80 for the services. Hind did not approve of the additional costs, and would only pay half of the fee, resulting in legal action being taken. Despite the disagreements between the men, Hind understood the importance of the photographs, and had them placed within his book Narrative of the Canadian Red River Exploring Expedition of 1857 and the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition of 1858.  Post-expedition, life in Toronto and death  Hime continued to work with Armstrong, Beere and Hime until the firm's closure in 1861. In 1860, Hime had established his own brokerage firm despite having no previous experience in the field, something he shared with nearly half of the city's brokers. He became a member of the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1861, holding various positions including Secretary, Treasurer, Vice President, and President. Having no permanent headquarters, the TSE bounced between various members' offices, including Hime's brokerage office. Hime was President at the time of the Exchange's collapse in 1869, by which time membership had dropped from twenty-four members to six. Hime joined the reborn Stock Exchange in 1871, serving as its President in 1888-1889, and remained a member until 1898, when he passed his seat to his son A. G. Hime. Hime became an important community member during his time in Toronto. He held various positions in the municipal government, including several elected offices. Entering electoral politics as an alderman in 1873, he went on to be a member of various committees: Finance and Assessment Standing Committee, Board of Health Committee, and the Jail Committee, while also becoming a Justice of the Peace in 1874. Despite retiring from politics only a year after joining, the city would rely on his services in later years with various financial matters. Returning to the private sector, Hime worked for the Toronto Brewing and Malting Company and eventually became President of the Copland Brewing and Malting Company by 1882. In this capacity he was described as a man of \\"untiring zeal and energy, great popularity, and of thoroughly practical experience\\" by author Charles Mulvaney. Hime and his wife Christina would have eight children between 1861 and 1879. He died on 31 October 1903 in his home in Toronto at the age of 70. In his obituary, the Globe called him \\"...one of the best known and most highly esteemed agents in Toronto.\\" His private funeral took place 2 November.

The artwork Les Mots Écrits de New Bell is a set of six mural installations by Hervé Yamguen. It is part of \\"Liquid projects\\", a program of SUD2010 that financed the production of permanent artworks dedicated to the theme of water in the neighborhoods of residence of four local artists. In New Bell, Yamguen worked in collaboration with two local rappers, Picsou and Moctomoflar, engaging them in the recording (and releasing) of a four songs album about water. During the production process the artist also introduced young people and local residents to the project through night performances and discussion meetings. From the lyrics of rappers, Yamguen extracted text fragments, reproducing them on six façades of Ngangue’s neighborhood that were spontaneously offered by locals. Les Mots Écrits de New Bell were produced on different supports: neon lights, tile mosaics, mirrors, iron rods, and painting. The text fragments selected by Yamguen clearly depict the reality of hardship and hope of New Bell's inhabitants. Here the texts: # Après le temps mort vient le temps vif comme un coup de foudre. Ne pleure pas maman, tous les yeux de la ville pleuvent sur moi. Tranquille papa on ne panique pas; # La vie saine, la joie de se sentir bien, l’envie de vivre de bonheur; # Se sentir bien; # La nuit le bonheur c’est dans les moustiquaires; # Wash ma life, Lave mon âme; Wash mes ways, Lave mon kwatt; # Dans les eaux sales du quartier, dans ma ruelle, ma jeunesse rebelle. However, two of these installations were removed: the first one – “Wash ma life, Lave mon âme, Wash mes ways, Lave mon kwatt” – for degradation, due to its position on the wall of a car washer; the second one – “Dans les eaux sales du quartier, dans ma ruelle, ma jeunesse rebelle” – was vandalized by the owner of the wall due to hard discussions with the rapper who wrote the sentence. The inauguration of the artwork took place during SUD - Salon Urbain de Douala 2010.

She is President and CEO of Ocean Networks Canada.  Education  Kate Moran grew up in Pennsylvania, where she first became interested in the ocean. Moran completed a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. She spent some time working at Procter and Gamble before joining a new program in Ocean Engineering at the University of Rhode Island. After receiving a job offer from the Atlantic Geoscience Centre, she moved to Nova Scotia. She received her PhD in 1995 from Dalhousie University, under the supervision of Hans Uaziri and Geoff Meyerhoff.  Research  Moran researches marine geotechnics and paleoclimatology and has led several oceanographic expeditions. In 2004 she was part of a team to extract 400 metres of sediment core from the Arctic sea floor, using it to understand the changing climate in the Arctic. The expedition was organised by the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat, who even threw a party for the scientists on the ice. Her team identified the earthquake that was the cause of the 2004 Indian Tsunami. She was described by Todd McLeish as knowing \\"more about the history of Arctic climate change than anyone\\". In 2008, Moran delivered testimony to the US Senate committee on Environmental and Public Works outlining the scientific evidence for climate change, and future predictions which resulted from the research. Between 2009 - 2011 Moran was seconded to President Obama's White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Obama instructed the federal government to develop an ocean policy, which was released in 2012. Moran was involved with the government's response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Moran was selected to be on Secretary Steven Chu's team in that response. Moran describes the efforts as \\"an incredible response, actually, by BP and the government\\". She is a supporter of renewable energy, \\"when I first started to be seriously concerned about the fact we need to stop [creating] CO2, I got involved in the first offshore wind farm in the U.S\\". In 2012, Moran took over as President and CEO of Ocean Networks Canada, where she overseas Canada's advanced cabled ocean observatories, NEPTUNE, in the Northeast Pacific Ocean and VENUS. The cabled observatories are open-access: their data are provided free-of-charge to anyone in the world. She is a Board member of the Clear Seas Centre for Responsible Marine Shipping. In 2012, Moran delivered a TEDx talk in Vancouver, entitled \\"Connecting our Planet's Oceans... To the Internet\\". Her observation systems provide 24 hour monitoring of ocean processes.

She is best known for founding the fashion company Pearl Daisy, designing head scarfs, and becoming the first hijab model in a L'Oreal hair-care campaign. Personal life Amena Khan was born in Leicester, United Kingdom in 1983. She was raised in a Hyderabadi Muslim family but did not start wearing hijab until she was in her early twenties. She felt like she never saw people of her background portrayed in a positive light on television and that's what inspired her to become a model. Khan began wearing the hijab at 22 and decided to take it off at 36. She stated both decisions were made of her own free will with no external pressures and both decisions made her feel empowered. In 2006, Khan married Osaama Khamkar. The couple has two children— a son born May 2009 and a daughter born March 2011. Career=Pearl Daisy= In 2009, Khan began hand-sewing and creating hijabs to sell to her YouTube fan base. This turned into her company which she entitled Pearl Daisy. Later on, she invented the \\"Hoojab\\" as part of the Pearl Daisy brand and has since become a staple for the company. The Hoojab is a hijab headscarf with a built in hood. The hood is supposed to create more styling options and make it easier for wearers to get the proportions right because when the hood is placed on the head, there is already a long side and short side built in. =Ardere Cosmetics & Lashionery= In 2015, Khan co-founded Ardere Cosmetics a cruelty- free makeup line meant for darker skinned woman.

She also has her own false lash line called Lashionery and in 2018, she launched a clothing line for her fashion boutique Pearl Daisy. =L'Oréal partnership= In 2018, Khan became the first woman wearing a hijab to be part of a mainstream advert for hair care. However, this accomplishment was short lived— she resigned following the criticism of her now deleted tweets criticising Israel's military action in Gaza in 2014, in which she stated that the Israeli government were \\"child killers.\\" She later said: Editorial writers Kate Wilkinson Cross and Rajnaara C Akhtar wrote an article comparing Khan's treatment during the L'Oréal controversy and Gal Gadot's treatment who made similar comments from the other side of the argument about the same exact event Khan commented on. After Israel took military action in Gaza in 2014, Gal Gadot tweeted her support of the Israeli military and Amena Khan tweeted her disapproval of the event. Yet the reactions they received were very different. The editorials writers wrote: Other political outlets have also spoken up about the complexity of this issue. The Intercept interviewed a political fashion blogger and activist named Hoda Katebi about Khan stepping down from the L'Oréal partnership and she said: \\"Brands want the face, but they don’t want the complex politics or the identity or the voice behind it... Once a Muslim woman asserts her agency, they’ll strip that away.” Backing up her comments, writer of the same Intercept article, Rashmee Kumar, explained that brands are trying to tap into a billion dollar Muslim consumer market by \\"positioning themselves as socially conscious havens for Muslims\\" except they are \\"operating on a profit motive rather than a moral imperative.\\" However no matter how complex the issue may be, journalist Toi Staff, wrote that calling Israel an \\"illegal, sinister\\" state and that \\"Insha’Allah (God willing), defeat also awaits the former; it’s only a matter of time,” as Amena Khan has, will always be antisemitic and should never be excused. =Magazine Covers & Editorials= In 2017, Khan was featured by Elle Magazine as one of four Muslim beauty influencers, in which she spoke about fighting against stereotypes as well as her experience wearing a headscarf. She said \\"Growing up without a headscarf I can see the stark difference between how I was treated then to how I'm treated now.\\" In 2018, She was featured in Vogue Magazine following the announcement of her L'Oréal hair campaign. The magazine hailed her as a \\"perfect\\" hair ambassador and pointed out that this is a first for headscarf wearing women. Writer of the aricle, Lisa Niven-Phillips, states why the work Khan is doing for L'Oréal is so important: =Bumble Partnership= In 2019, Khan landed a partnership with Bumble and became a Bumble Bizz Ambassador. Bumble is a networking app used for dating, friendships, and business. The business side of the app was attempting to expand by creating brand ambassadors to promote the company. Khan became one of those ambassadors and used this opportunity to uplift Muslim and South Asian business women by holding a workshop and networking event that focused on that demographic. =Podcast= In 2020, Khan started a podcast called Thrive that airs on Spotify and iTunes. She does both solo episodes and episodes with guests. Her solo episodes focus on sharing information about \\"everything from beauty to health, to business, parenting, education and spirituality\\", whereas her guest episodes focus more on stories from the guest that center around personal growth.

It was created by Lucas Grandin in 2010 and is made of a wooden structure built on three floors that serves as a panoramic viewpoint on the Wouri River, as a botanical garden and as a dewdrop percussion organ. The artwork Le Jardin sonore est d'une hauteur de 10 mètres, longueur de 6,83 mètres, une largeur maximale de 4,52 mètres. Sa superficie totale est de 35 mètre carrés d’espace repartis sur trois niveaux (Rez de chaussée 20 m2, 1er étage 10m2 et 2ième étage 5m2) Il fut inauguré pendant le SUD - Salon Urbain de Douala 2010. In February 2010, Lucas Grandin started working at his Jardin Sonore, a wooden structure built on three floors that serves as a panoramic viewpoint on the Wouri River, as a botanical garden and as a dewdrop percussion organ. Lucas Grandin’s work aroused the passionate interest of the inhabitants of the district, creating a place for socializing and contemplation and covering the urban cacophony inside its water walls. During SUD 2010, the artist engaged the inhabitants of Bonamouti in the production process of the work though preparatory meetings, the requalification of the area (used before as dumpster on the edge of the river), and the building structure. The botanical garden, located on the perimeter of the wooden structure, hosts flowering, cosmetics, grocery and light pharmaceutical plants. The Jardin Sonore is equipped with a sustainable “drop by drop” irrigation system, which allows reaching water autonomy up to 6 months. The water is collected by the rainfall, stocked in barrels and offered to the vertical garden through transparent tubes using a hydroponic dripping system. This system does not allow for water dispersion and, at the same time, it does not require regular watering from inhabitants. Drops of water drip into cans of different sizes, creating notes and feeding plants for the neighborhood of Bonamouti. Different kinds of sound are directly conducted by the plants different needs of water. This elevated garden growing at the sound of the water and invites the public to contemplate at the river Wouri from each of its three levels. This building is a water sound garden, to gain conscience of the importance of the water in our life, to give Douala its right to the water back and to show its origins, to give a free new social meeting place in Bonamouti where everybody can go when he wants to have some rest with the water melody, to smell of the flowers, to see the Wouri river and its original mangrove (where everybody came) and feel the wind of the nature... a new social area to talk, to plant, to listen, to re- create a new inter-generational communication through the garden. The Jardin Sonore has also become a romantic area for young lovers, who meet on the upper floors to contemplate the river view.

The effects of radiation on cells has been found to be dependent on the dosage of the radiation, the location of the cell in regards to tissue, and whether the cell is a somatic or germ line cell. Generally, ionizing radiation appears to reduce methylation of DNA in cells. Ionizing radiation has been known to cause damage to cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. It has also been known to cause DNA double-strand breaks. Accumulation of DNA double strand breaks can lead to cell cycle arrest in somatic cells and cause cell death. Due to its ability to induce cell cycle arrest, ionizing radiation is used on abnormal growths in the human body such as cancer cells, in radiation therapy. Most cancer cells are fully treated with some type of radiotherapy, however some cells such as stem cell cancer cells show a reoccurrence when treated by this type of therapy.  Radiation exposure in everyday life  Non-ionising radiations, electromagnetic fields (EMF) such as radiofrequency (RF), or power frequency radiation have become very common in everyday life. All of these exist as low frequency radiation which can come from wireless cellular devices or through electrical appliances which induce extremely low frequency radiation (ELF). Exposure to these radioactive frequencies has shown negative affects on the fertility of men by impacting the DNA of the sperm and deteriorating the testes as well as an increased risk of tumor formation in salivary glands. The International Agency for Research on Cancer considers RF electromagnetic fields to be possibly carcinogenic to humans, however the evidence is limited. = Radiation and medical imaging = Advances in medical imaging has resulted in increased exposure of humans to low doses of ionizing radiation. Radiation exposure in pediatrics has been shown to have a greater impact as children's cells are still developing. The radiation obtained from medical imaging techniques is only harmful if consistently targeted multiple times in a short space of time. Safety measures have been introduced in order to limit the exposure of harmful ionizing radiation such as the usage of protective material during the use of these imaging tools. A lower dosage is also used in order to fully rid the possibility of a harmful effect from the medical imaging tools. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements along with many other scientific committees have ruled in favor of continued use of medical imaging as the reward far outweighs the minimal risk obtained from these imaging techniques. If the safety protocols are not followed there is a potential increase in the risk of developing cancer. This is primarily due to the decreased methylation of cell cycle genes, such as those relating to apoptosis and DNA repair. The ionizing radiation from these techniques can cause many other detrimental effects in cells including changes in gene expression and halting the cell cycle. However, these results are extremely unlikely if the proper protocols are followed.  Target theory  Target theory concerns the models of how radiation kills biological cells and is based around two main postulates: # \\"Radiation is considered to be a sequence of random projectiles; # the components of the cell are considered as the targets bombarded by these projectiles\\" Several models have been based around the above two points. From the various proposed models three main conclusions were found: # Physical hits obey a Poisson distribution # Failure of radioactive particles to attack sensitive areas of cells allow for survival of the cell # Cell death is an exponential function of the dose of radiation received as the number of hits received is directly proportional to the radiation dose; all hits are considered lethal Radiation exposure through ionizing radiation (IR) affects a variety of processes inside of an exposed cell. IR can cause changes in gene expression, disruption of cell cycle arrest, and apoptotic cell death. The extent of how radiation effects cells depends on the type of cell and the dosage of the radiation. Some irradiated cancer cells have been shown to exhibit DNA methylation patterns due to epigenetic mechanisms in the cell. In medicine, medical diagnostic methods such as CT scans and radiation therapy expose the individual to ionizing radiation. Irradiated cells can also induce genomic instability in neighboring un-radiated cells via the bystander effect. Radiation exposure could also occur via many other channels than just ionizing radiation. = The basic ballistic models = The single-target single-hit model  In this model a single hit on a target is sufficient to kill a cell The equation used for this model is as follows: p(k) = \\\\frac{m^k}{k!} e^{-m} Where k represents a hit on the cell and m represents the mass of the cell. = The n-target single-hit model = In this model the cell has a number of targets n. A single hit on one target is not sufficient to kill the cell but does disable the target. An accumulation of successful hits on various targets leads to cell death. The equation used for this model is as follows: p(n) = (1-e^{-\\\\frac{D}{D_0}})^n Where n represents number of the targets in the cell. = The linear quadratic model = The equation used for this model is as follows: S(D) = e^{-\\\\alpha D -\\\\beta D^2} where αD represents a hit made by a one particle track and βD represents a hit made by a two particle track and S(D) represents the probability of survival of the cell.  The three lambda model  This model showed the accuracy of survival description for higher or repeated doses. The equation used for this model is as follows: S(D) = e^{-\\\\lambda_3 (1 - e^{\\\\lambda_1D}(1 -(1 - e^{-(\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_1)D})^2))}  The linear-quadratic-cubic model  The equation used for this model is as follows: S(D) = e^{-\\\\alpha D-\\\\beta D^{2}+\\\\gamma D^{3}} = Sublesions hypothesis models = The repair-misrepair model  This model shows the mean number of lesions before any repair activations in a cell. The equation used for this model is as follows: S_\\\\psi = e^{-U_0} (1+ \\\\frac{U_0(1-e^{-\\\\lambda T})}{\\\\epsilon})^{\\\\psi \\\\epsilon} where Uo represents the yield of initially induced lesions, with λ being the linear self-repair coefficient, and T equaling time  The lethal-potentially lethal model  This equation explores the hypothesis of a lesion becoming fatal within a given of time if it is not repair by repair enzymes. The equation used for this model is as follows: S = e^{-n_{tot} (T+t_r)} = e^{-N_{tot}} [\\\\frac{1+N_{PL}}{\\\\epsilon (1-e^{- \\\\epsilon_{PL}t_r})}]^\\\\epsilon T is the radiation duration and tr is the available repair time.  The saturable repair model  This model illustrates the efficiency of the repair system decreasing as the dosage of radiation increases. This is due to the repair kinetics becoming increasingly saturated with the increase in radiation dosage. The equation used for this model is as follows: S(D) = e^{-\\\\frac{n_0-c_0}{1-\\\\frac{c_0}{n_0}e^{kT(c_0-n_0)}}} n(t) is the number of unrepaired lesions, c(t) is the number of repair molecules or enzymes, k is the proportionality coefficient, and T is the time available for repair.  Cellular environment and radiation hormesis = Radiation hormesis = Hormesis is the hypothesis that low levels of disrupting stimulus can cause beneficial adaptations in an organism. The ionizing radiation stimulates repair proteins that are usually not active. Cells use this new stimuli to adapt to the stressors they are being exposed to. = Radiation-Induced Bystander Effect (RIBE) = In biology, the bystander effect is described as changes to nearby non-targeted cells in response to changes in an initially targeted cell by some disrupting agent. In the case of Radiation-Induced Bystander Effect, the stress on the cell is caused by ionizing radiation. The bystander effect can be broken down into two categories, long range bystander effect and short range bystander effect. In long range bystander effect, the effects of stress are seen further away from the initially targeted cell. In short range bystander, the effects of stress are seen in cells adjacent to the target cell. Both low linear energy transfer and high linear energy transfer photons have been shown to produce RIBE. Low linear energy transfer photons were reported to cause increases in mutagenesis and a reduction in the survival of cells in clonogenic assays. X-rays and gamma rays were reported to cause increases in DNA double strand break, methylation, and apoptosis. Further studies are needed to reach a conclusive explanation of any epigenetic impact of the bystander effect.  Radiation and oxidative stress = Formation of ROS = Ionizing radiation produces fast moving particles which have the ability to damage DNA, and produce highly reactive free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). The production of ROS in cells radiated by LDIR (Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation) occur in two ways, by the radiolysis of water molecules or the promotion of nitric oxide synthesis (NOS) activity. The resulting nitric oxide formation reacts with superoxide radicals. This generates peroxynitrite which is toxic to biomolecules. Cellular ROS is also produced with the help of a mechanism involving nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. NADPH oxidase helps with the formation of ROS by generating a superoxide anion by transferring electrons from cytosolic NADPH across the cell membrane to the extracellular molecular oxygen. This process increases the potential for leakage of electrons and free radicals from the mitochondria. The exposure to the LDIR induces electron release from the mitochondria resulting in more electrons contributing to the superoxide formation in the cells. The production of ROS in high quantity in cells results in the degradation of biomolecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. In one such instance the ROS are known to create double stranded and single stranded breaks in the DNA. This causes the DNA repair mechanisms to try to adapt to the increase in DNA strand breaks. Heritable changes to the DNA sequence have been seen although the DNA nucleotide sequence seems the same after the exposure with LDIR. = Activation of NOS = The formation of ROS is coupled with the formation of nitric oxide synthase activity (NOS). NO reacts with O2− generating peroxynitrite. The increase in the NOS activity causes the production of peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Peroxynitrite is a strong oxidant radical and it reacts with a wide array of biomolecules such as DNA bases, proteins and lipids. Peroxynitrite affects biomolecules function and structure and therefore effectively destabilizes the cell. = Mechanism of oxidative stress and epigenetic gene regulation = Ionizing radiation causes the cell to generate increased ROS and the increase of this species damages biological macromolecules. In order to compensate for this increased radical species, cells adapt to IR induced oxidative effects by modifying the mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation. There are 4 epigenetic modifications that can take place: # formation of protein adducts inhibiting epigenetic regulation # alteration of genomic DNA methylation status # modification of post translational histone interactions affecting chromatin compaction # modulation of signaling pathways that control transcription factor expression ROS- mediated protein adduct formation ROS generated by ionizing radiation chemically modify histones which can cause a change in transcription. Oxidation of cellular lipid components result in an electrophilic molecule formation. The electrophilic molecule binds to the lysine residues of histones causing a ketoamide adduct formation. The ketoamide adduct formation blocks the lysine residues of histones from binding to acetylation proteins thus decreasing gene transcription. ROS-mediated DNA methylation changes DNA hypermethylation is seen in the genome with DNA breaks at a gene-specific basis, such as promoters of regulatory genes, but the global methylation of the genome shows a hypomethylation pattern during the period of reactive oxygen species stress. DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species results in increased gene methylation and ultimately gene silencing. Reactive oxygen species modify the mechanism of epigenetic methylation by inducing DNA breaks which are later repaired and then methylated by DNMTs. DNA damage response genes, such as GADD45A, recruit nuclear proteins Np95 to direct histone methyltransferase's towards the damaged DNA site. The breaks in DNA caused by the ionizing radiation then recruit the DNMTs in order to repair and further methylate the repair site. Genome wide hypomethylation occurs due to reactive oxygen species hydroxylating methylcytosines to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). The production of 5hmC serves as an epigenetic marker for DNA damage which is recognizable by DNA repair enzymes. The DNA repair enzymes attracted by the marker convert 5hmC to an unmethylated cytosine base resulting in the hypomethylation of the genome. Another mechanism that induces hypomethylation is the depletion of S-adenosyl methionine synthetase (SAM). The prevalence of super oxide species causes the oxidization of reduced glutathione (GSH) to GSSG. Due to this, synthesis of the cosubstrate SAM is stopped. SAM is an essential cosubtrate for the normal functioning of DNMTs and histone methyltrasnferase proteins.  ROS-mediated post-translation modification  Double stranded DNA breaks caused by exposure to ionizing radiation are known to alter chromatin structure. Double stranded breaks are primarily repaired by poly ADP (PAR) polymerases which accumulate at the site of the break leading to activation of the chromatin remodeling protein ALC1. ALC1 causes the nucleosome to relax resulting in the epigenetic up-regulation of genes. A similar mechanism involves the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) serine/threonine kinase which is an enzyme involved in the repair of double stranded breaks caused by ionizing radiation. ATM phosphorylates KAP1 which causes the heterochromatin to relax, allowing increased transcription to occur. The DNA mismatch repair gene (MSH2) promoter has shown a hypermethylation pattern when exposed to ionizing radiation. Reactive oxygen species induce the oxidization of deoxyguanosine into 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) causing a change in chromatin structure. Gene promoters that contain 8-OHdG deactivate the chromatin by inducing trimethyl-H3K27 in the genome. Other enzymes such as transglutaminases (TGs) control chromatin remodeling through proteins such as sirtuin1 (SIRT1). TGs cause transcriptional repression during reactive oxygen species stress by binding to the chromatin and inhibiting the sirtuin 1 histone deacetylase from performing its function.  ROS-mediated loss of epigenetic imprinting  Epigenetic imprinting is lost during reactive oxygen species stress. This type of oxidative stress causes a loss of NF- κB signaling. Enhancer blocking element CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binds to the imprint control region of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) preventing the enhancers from allowing the transcription of the gene. The NF- κB proteins interact with IκB inhibitory proteins, but during oxidative stress IκB proteins are degraded in the cell. The loss of IκB proteins for NF- κB proteins to bind to results in NF- κB proteins entering the nucleus to bind to specific response elements to counter the oxidative stress. The binding of NF- κB and corepressor HDAC1 to response elements such as the CCCTC-binding factor causes a decrease in expression of the enhancer blocking element. This decrease in expression hinders the binding to the IGF2 imprint control region therefore causing the loss of imprinting and biallelic IGF2 expression.  Mechanisms of epigenetic modifications  After the initial exposure to ionizing radiation, cellular changes are prevalent in the unexposed offspring of irradiated cells for many cell divisions. One way this non-Mendelian mode of inheritance can be explained is through epigenetic mechanisms. = Ionizing radiation and DNA methylation = Genomic instability via hypomethylation of LINE1  Ionizing radiation exposure affects patterns of DNA methylation. Breast cancer cells treated with fractionated doses of ionizing radiation showed DNA hypomethylation at the various gene loci; dose fractionation refers to breaking down one dose of radiation into separate, smaller doses. Hypomethylation of these genes correlated with decreased expression of various DNMTs and methyl CpG binding proteins. LINE1 transposable elements have been identified as targets for ionizing radiation. The hypomethylation of LINE1 elements results in activation of the elements and thus an increase in LINE1 protein levels. Increased transcription of LINE1 transposable elements results in greater mobilization of the LINE1 loci and therefore increases genomic instability.  Ionizing radiation and histone modification  Irradiated cells can be linked to a variety of histone modifications. Ionizing radiation in breast cancer cell inhibits H4 lysine tri-methylation. Mouse models exposed to high levels of X-ray irradiation exhibited a decrease in both the tri-methylation of H4-Lys20 and the compaction of the chromatin. With the loss of tri- methylation of H4-Lys20, DNA hypomethylation increased resulting in DNA damage and increased genomic instability.  Loss of methylation via repair mechanisms  Breaks in DNA due to ionizing radiation can be repaired. New DNA synthesis by DNA polymerases is one of the ways radiation induced DNA damage can be repaired. However, DNA polymerases do not insert methylated bases which leads to a decrease in methylation of the newly synthesized strand. Reactive oxygen species also inhibit DNMT activity which would normally add the missing methyl groups. This increases the chance that the demethylated state of DNA will eventually become permanent.  Clinical consequences and applications = Epigenetic affects on a developing brain = Chronic exposure to these types of radiation can have an effect on children from as early as when they are fetuses. There have been multiple cases reported of hindrance in the development of the brain, behavioral changes such as anxiety, and the disruption of proper learning and language processing. An Increase in the cases of ADHD behavior and autism behavior has been shown to be directly correlated with the exposure of EMF waves. The World Health Organization has classified RFR as a possible carcinogen for its epigenetic effects on DNA expression. The exposure to EMF waves on a consistent 24hr basis has shown to lower the activity of miRNA in the brain affecting developmental and neuronal activity. This epigenetic change causes the silencing of necessary genes along with the change in expression of other genes integral for the normal development of the brain. = MGMT- and LINE1- specific DNA methylation = DNA methylation influences tissue responses to ionizing radiation. Modulation of methylation in the gene MGMT or in transposable elements such as LINE1 could be used to alter tissue responses to ionizing radiation and potentially opening new areas for cancer treatment. MGMT serves as a prognostic marker in glioblastoma. Hypermethylation of MGMT is associated with the regression of tumors. Hypermethylation of MGMT silences its transcription inhibiting alkylating agents in tumor killing cells. Studies have shown patients who received radiotherapy, but no chemotherapy after tumor extraction, had an improved response to radiotherapy due to the methylation of the MGMT promoter. Almost all human cancers include hypomethylation of LINE1 elements. Various studies depict that the hypomethylation of LINE1 correlates with a decrease in survival after both chemotherapy and radiotheraphy. = Treatment by DNMT inhibitors = DMNT inhibitors are being explored in the treatment of malignant tumors.

He was regularly employed by the civil engineer Sir John Kelk to design the homes and public buildings he funded. Johnson is best known for his collaboration with Alfred Meeson on designs for Alexandra Palace in north London; his designs for the Church of St Edward the Confessor in Romford, Essex; and for the Grade I listed St Mary's Church in Tidworth, Wiltshire, which was completed the year he died. As a result of the land on which one of Johnson's churches – St Luke's Church, Euston Road – was sitting being purchased by the Midland Railway, the building was dismantled, moved to Wanstead in north-east London, and re-erected as a Congregational church. Johnson's participation in the work gave him the distinction of becoming one of a small number of architects to have undertaken such a move and subsequent reconstruction. Personal life John Johnson was born in 1807; little is known of his life, but he enjoyed fishing, and was for ten years on the committee of the Thames Angling Preservation Society.John Johnson (1807–1878).

Career=Churches= St Edward the Confessor Church in Romford, Essex Johnson was a prolific designer of religious buildings and churches. In 1849 he was instructed to design the Church of St Edward the Confessor in Romford, Essex, and returned in 1864 to complete his second church in the town, St Andrew's, in what is in now the Waterloo Estate. In 1853 he took on the rebuilding of the parish church of All Saints in Beyton, Suffolk, which retained the medieval core and tower. Johnson created the original designs for St Luke's Church, Euston Road, between 1856 and 1861. In 1866 it was dismantled and re-designed by Johnson, and re-erected as a Congregational church in Wanstead. The church was relocated because of the purchase of land by the Midland Railway, which obtained an Act of Parliament in 1863 to extend its line to London and build a new terminus, (which became St Pancras railway station) on the land occupied by Johnson's church. It was described by Historic England as \\"one of few examples of churches which have been moved and substantially reconstructed to their original form, and by the original architect\\". Other religious buildings followed, including the Old Vicarage in Oakley Square, Camden, in 1861; and St Andrews Church in Hertford in 1875. One of his final churches was St Mary's Church in Tidworth, Wiltshire, which was completed in the year in which Johnson died. It is his only Grade I listed building. =Public and private buildings= St Mary's in South Tidworth, Wiltshire Johnson was closely associated with the civil engineer Sir John Kelk (1816–1886) who instructed Johnson to complete the Army and Navy Club in St James's Square, London; Kelk's personal residence at 3 Grosvenor Square, London; and St Mary's Church, which was built on Kelk's estate in Tidworth, Wiltshire. Kelk and Johnson worked together in 1862 as part of the Kensington Exhibition, and again on the construction of Alexandra Palace, which Johnson co-designed with Alfred Meeson (1808–1885). The palace burnt down in 1873 and Johnson and Meeson designed the new building which exists to this day. Kelk personally funded the project and used the contractors Charles and Thomas Lucas to construct the property. Death and legacy Johnson died at the age of 71 on 28 December 1878 at his home, 14 Buckingham Street, near the Strand, London.\\"Deaths\\", The Standard, 31 December 1878, p. 1.

The bill authorizes the use of funds generated by Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) to be invested in communities adversely affected by the cessation of mining operations in the area. A revised version was introduced April 30, 2019 as S 1232 by Senator Manchin (D-WV) and on April 9, 2019 as HR 2156 by Representative Cartwright (D-PA). PEABODY COAL COMPANY STRIP MINE, SOUTH OF COLSTRIP - NARA - 549167 Background The RECLAIM Act was preceded by and amends the SMCRA, which was enacted in 1977 to decrease the amount of coal dust in downstream water resources and other mining operations that are harmful to wildlife. Shortly after SMCRA was established, the United States Department of Interior created the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) agency to enforce the law. OSMRE's purview includes protecting wildlife, restoring abandoned mines, and making sure the regulations for surface coal mining are complied with. In addition, the agency has been charged with the administration of Abandoned Mine Land (AML) Reclamation Fund. Under the RECLAIM Act, extra AML funds will be disbursed over the next five years, giving up to $1 billion to help clean up and restore abandoned mines and foster economic development. Provisions RECLAIM Act spending by state Section 416 amends the SMCRA by adding a section at the end of the bill that appropriates $200,000,000 for five fiscal years. This money is to be used by U.S. states and Indian tribes to \\"promote economic revitalization, diversification, and development in economically distressed mining communities through the reclamation and restoration of land and water resources adversely affected by coal mining carried out before August 3, 1977.\\" The appropriated funds can only be used for certain priority projects. The project must meet the requirements of sections 403(a) (of 30 USC 1233) and 416(c) of the RECLAIM Act. Section 416(c) states that upon completion of the project, the reclamation should have created conditions for favorable development or conditions for the general welfare through development of communities. This section of the bill, the appropriations section, states that 30 percent of funds can be used for acid mine drainage treatment, 10 percent for project planning and administration and no more than 50 percent can be used for abandoned mine lands reclamation and restoration. The money is divided among states by a formula, with 80% weight on the amount of coal mined from each State or Indian tribe before August 3, 1977, and 20% weight on reclamation fees paid from 2012 through 2016. The RECLAIM Act's stated goal is to help \\"economically distressed mining communities... adversely affected by coal mining carried out before August 3, 1977,\\" and much of the targeted support goes to Kentucky, Illinois, Pennsylvania amd West Virginia.. Reactions The bill has generated support from a broad coalition of interests groups, such as Appalachian grassroots organizations, religious organizations, and environmentalist groups. The organizations argue that the bill will revitalize the economies of communities that were traditionally reliant upon coal mining. Polling in Eastern Kentucky suggests that Appalachian support for the bill is not limited to lobbying groups, approximately 89% of voters support this bill. Industry groups have lobbied against the bill, arguing that the Abandoned Mines Lands (AML) funds should not be diverted from their original purpose. The National Mining Association has stated broader opposition to the administration of AML funds. The Heritage Foundation argues it is a poor use of money, deregulation would be better, and the AML fees should be allowed to expire at the end of 2021.

It was created by Pascale Marthine Tayou and inaugurated in 2010. The artwork leftLa Colonne Pascale consisted of pots in Vitreous enamel, which were used in the past by the housewives to protect the food and the drinks. La Colonne Pascale is a simple and uncluttered dynamic line rising in the sky, located in the heart of a roundabout in the extremely lively quarter New Bell of Douala. It is high and constituted of a pile of 76 marmites and 38 lids. The intention of the artist was to pay homage to African women giving value to the culinary culture of the Cameroonian tradition. Nevertheless, the artwork was the subject of debates and tensions from local residents. People's controversies depend both on the physical position of the Colonne Pascale, appealing to historical events (the square was the epicenter of the riots that led to the independence of the country), and for its symbolic interpretation, since according to many people the artwork recalls and highlights the poverty of New Bell.

Examples of distributions that satisfy this condition include Gaussian, uniform, and exponential; some power law distributions also satisfy regularity. Distributions that satisfy the regularity condition are often referred to as \\"regular distributions\\".  Definitions  Two equivalent definitions of regularity appear in the literature. Both are defined for continuous distributions, although analogs for discrete distributions have also been considered. = Concavity of revenue in quantile space = Consider a seller auctioning a single item to a buyer with random value v. For any price p set by the seller, the buyer will buy the item if v \\\\geq p. The seller's expected revenue is p \\\\cdot \\\\Pr[v\\\\geq p]. We define the revenue function R:[0,1] \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} as follows: R(q) is the expected revenue the seller would obtain by choosing p such that \\\\Pr[v \\\\geq p] = q. In other words, R(q) is the revenue that can be obtained by selling the item with (ex-ante) probability q. Finally, we say that a distribution is regular if R is a concave function. = Monotone virtual valuation = For a cumulative distribution function F(v) and corresponding probability density function f(v) := F'(v), the virtual valuation of the agent is defined as : w(v) := v - \\\\frac{1-F(v)}{f(v)} The valuation distribution is said to be regular if w is a monotone non-decreasing function.  Applications = Myerson's auction = An important special case Myerson distinguishes between \\"preference uncertainty\\", which we expect to be independent for each bidder, and \\"quality uncertainty\\", which is treated in a more general model where one bidder's private information affects the valuation of other bidders, and even the value of the item to the seller. considered by is the problem of a seller auctioning a single item to one or more buyers whose valuations for the item are drawn from independent distributions. Myerson showed that the problem of the seller truthfully maximizing her profit is equivalent to maximizing the \\"virtual social welfare\\", i.e. the expected virtual valuation of the bidder who receives the item. When the bidders valuations distributions are regular, the virtual valuations are monotone in the real valuations, which implies that the transformation to virtual valuations is incentive compatible. Thus a Vickrey auction can be used to maximize the virtual social welfare (with additional reserve prices to guarantee non-negative virtual valuations). When the distributions are irregular, a more complicated ironing procedure is used to transform them into regular distributions. = Prior-independent mechanism design = Myerson's auction mentioned above is optimal if the seller has an accurate prior, i.e. a good estimate of the distribution of valuations that bidders can have for the item. Obtaining such a good prior may be highly non- trivial, or even impossible. Prior-independent mechanism design seeks to design mechanisms for sellers (and agents in general) who do not have access to such a prior. Regular distributions are a common assumption in prior- independent mechanism design. For example, the seminal proved that if bidders valuations for a single item are regular and i.i.d. (or identical and affiliated), the revenue obtained from selling with an English auction to n+1 bidders dominates the revenue obtained from selling with any mechanism (in particular, Myerson's optimal mechanism) to n bidders.

SETD3 is capable of methylating the cytoskeletal protein actin on histidine residues. In patients of the Estrogen Receptor-positive, and Luminal A-type breast cancer classification, a high expression of SETD3 is associated with better relapse-free survival, whereas in patients lacking expression of estrogen-, progesterone- and HER2/neu-receptor, and those affected by a p53-mutation, SETD3 was associated with poor relapse-free survival.

A zoo is considered to be scientifically managed if it is run by a director with an academic education, usually a biologist or a veterinarian, and if he or she follows and implements scientific standards of zoology, conservation, and zoo pedagogy. History The association was founded in 1887, making it the oldest zoo association in the world. It originated from the annual meetings of zoo directors from the European area at the animal auctions in the zoo Antwerp. From the 1920s, the association expanded through members from Central and Northern Europe. He became the nucleus of the first International Zoodirektorenverbandes, which was founded in 1935 at the annual convention in Basel. In 1946, after the Second World War, the reestablishment of the International Zoodirektorenverband took place. The VDZ was reconstituted in 1951. In 1987, exactly 100 years after its founding, the VDZ attended its annual conferenceRheine a new statute, which made the loose association with its annual meetings a registered association with a solid association structure. From 2009 until relocation to Berlin in 2015, the office of the association was in Bern.

The association's body published the magazine The Zoological Garden until the end of 2017. It is also an organ of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). In addition, 40 VDC members are institutional members of WAZA. The cooperation with the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria EAZA, in which VdZ zoos are also members, is also very close. Once a year, the members of the VdZ meet for their annual meeting in a member zoo. These meetings consist of scientific sessions and business meetings, a tour of the host zoo and a scientific excursion. The board consists of nine members.

In 2004, the number rose to more than 28 million, to which the reopening of the converted Zoo on the sea in Bremerhaven contributed significantly. Thereafter, overall numbers continued to rise, notably as a result of the total renewal of the zoos in Gelsenkirchen, Hanover and Leipzig, which saw massive growth, the opening of the tropical aquarium Hagenbeck in 2007, the Darwineum in Rostock in 2012 and the growing popularity of the borderline Zoos of Aachen and Nordhornin the neighboring country Holland.

It stretched in the Lower Danube over territory in Romania and Moldavia. The population of the area was made up of Romanized descendants of Daco-Getic, Germanic and Slavic tribes. There are views that it derived from the Chernyakhov culture and represented a group of the Antes. The houses were identical to the Slavic huts of the Prague-Korchak and Penkovka areas.

Browser isolation technologies approach this model in different ways, but they all seek to achieve the same goal, effective isolation of the web browser and a user's browsing activity as a method of securing web browsers from browser-based security exploits, as well as web-borne threats such as ransomware and other malware. When a browser isolation technology is delivered to its customers as a cloud hosted service, this is known as remote browser isolation (RBI), a model which enables organizations to deploy a browser isolation solution to their users without managing the associated server infrastructure. There are also client side approaches to browser isolation, based on client-side hypervisors, which do not depend on servers in order to isolate their users browsing activity and the associated risks, instead the activity is virtually isolated on the local host machine. Client-side solutions break the security through physical isolation model, but they do allow the user to avoid the server overhead costs associated with remote browser isolation solutions. Mechanism Browser isolation typically leverages virtualization or containerization technology to isolate the users web browsing activity away from the endpoint device - significantly reducing the attack surface for rogue links and files. Browser isolation is a way to isolate web browsing hosts and other high-risk behaviors away from mission-critical data and infrastructure. Browser isolation is a process to physically isolate a user's browsing activity away from local networks and infrastructure, isolating malware and browser based cyber-attacks in the process. Market In 2017, the American research group Gartner identified remote browser (browser isolation) as one of the top technologies for security. The same Gartner report also forecast that more than 50% of enterprises would actively begin to isolate their internet browsing to reduce the impact of cyber attacks over the coming three years. According to Market Research Media, the remote browser isolation (RBI) market is forecast to reach $10 Billion by 2024, growing at CAGR 30% in the period 2019-2024.  Comparison to other techniques  Unlike traditional web security approaches such as antivirus software and secure web gateways, browser isolation is a zero trust approach which does not rely on filtering content based on known threat patterns or signatures. Traditional approaches can't handle 0-day attacks since the threat patterns are unknown. Rather, browser isolation approach treats all websites and other web content that has not been explicitly whitelisted as untrusted, and isolates them from the local device in a virtual environment such as a container or virtual machine. Web-based files can be rendered remotely so that end users can access them within the browser, without downloading them. Alternatively, files can be sanitized within the virtual environment, using file cleansing technologies such as Content Disarm & Reconstruction (CDR), allowing for secure file downloads to the user device.  Effectiveness  Typically browser isolation solutions provide their users with 'disposable' (non-persistent) browser environments, once the browsing session is closed or times out, the entire browser environment is reset to a known good state or simply discarded. Any malicious code encountered during that session is thus prevented from reaching the endpoint or persisting within the network, regardless of whether any threat is detected. In this way, browser isolation proactively combats both known, unknown and zero-day threats, effectively complementing other security measures and contributing to a defense-in-depth, layered approach to web security. History Browser isolation began as an evolution of the 'security through physical isolation' cybersecurity model and is also known as the air- gap model by security professionals, who have been physically isolating critical networks, users and infrastructures for cybersecurity purposes for decades. Although techniques to breach 'air-gapped' IT systems exist, they typically require physical access or close proximity to the air-gapped system in order to be effective. The use of an air-gap makes infiltration into systems from the public internet extremely difficult, if not impossible without physical access to the system . The first commercial browser isolation platforms were leveraged by the National Nuclear Security Administration at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories in 2009, when browser isolation platforms based on virtualization were used to deliver non-persistent virtual desktops to thousands of federal government users. In June 2018, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) announced a request for information for a \\"cloud-based internet isolation\\" solution as part of its endpoint security portfolio. As the RFI puts it, \\"the service would redirect the act of internet browsing from the end user’s desktop into a remote server, external to the Department of Defense Information Network.\\" At the time, the RFI was the largest known project for browser isolation, seeking \\"a cloud based service leveraging concurrent (simultaneous) use licenses at ~60% of the total user base (3.1 Million users).\\" See also * Malware * Internet safety * Browser security * Antivirus software  References  Web browsers Web security exploits Computer network security ","title":"Browser isolation"},{"id":"56380197","text":"Nicole Bélanger is a Canadian novelist and screenwriter from Quebec.\\"Nicole Bélanger - Les rois mongols: une ado rebelle raconte la crise d'Octobre\\".

The bride, Princess Eugenie of York, is a member of the British royal family. The groom, Jack Brooksbank, is a British wine merchant, brand ambassador of Casamigos Tequila and socialite. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England. Princess Eugenie was the first British princess of the royal blood to marry in the Church of England since the wedding of Princess Anne and Mark Phillips 45 years before. Announcement of engagement Princess Eugenie of York in 2013 Princess Eugenie of York is the second daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and Sarah, Duchess of York. At the time of the engagement announcement, she was eighth in the line of succession to the British throne. Jack Christopher Stamp Brooksbank is the European brand manager for Casamigos Tequila, the company co-founded by George Clooney. Brooksbank is related to the Brooksbank baronets: he is the great-great-grandson of Sir Edward Clitherow Brooksbank, 1st Baronet. Jack is a third cousin twice removed of Princess Eugenie through Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester. His great- grandfather is Sir Jack Coke, Gentleman Usher to King George VI and Extra Gentleman Usher to Queen Elizabeth II. Brooksbank's parents are Old Etonian George Brooksbank, a company director and chartered accountant, and his wife, Nicola (née Newton) who split their time between London and France's Bordeaux wine region. Jack has a younger brother, Thomas who is also an Old Etonian. After completion of his studies at Stowe School, Brooksbank worked in hospitality and management at establishments such as the Mahiki club and the Markham Inn gastropub. His first job after leaving school was in service at the Admiral Codrington pub in Chelsea. The couple had been dating for seven years and they were first introduced by friends in a ski break in Verbier, Switzerland, where Brooksbank was working at the time. On 22 January 2018, Buckingham Palace announced that they would marry in the autumn. They were engaged earlier the same month while in Nicaragua with Brooksbank giving the Princess an oval-cut Padparadscha sapphire surrounded by a halo of diamonds set on a gold band with two further diamonds on the shoulders. The ring bears a striking similarity to the engagement ring of Princess Eugenie's mother. Its value is estimated to be between $30,000 and $150,000. Although Eugenie is a member of the British royal family, she does not require the Queen's permission to marry. The Duke of York and Sarah, Duchess of York expressed their delight at the news and the British Prime Minister Theresa May congratulated the couple on her Twitter account. After the announcement the couple gave an interview to Matt Baker of BBC One. The official engagement photographs were taken in the Picture gallery at Buckingham Palace. During the public announcement of the engagement, Eugenie wore a floral Erdem cocktail dress to coordinate with the pink sapphire engagement ring. She had previously worn the dress for a 2016 interview with Harper's Bazaar. To mark the wedding of Eugenie and Jack, the Royal Collection Trust produced an official range of commemorative china, showing a monogram surmounted by the coronet of Princess Eugenie, alongside the couple's entwined monogram. During the week preceding the wedding, Buckingham Palace and the Duke of York shared family photographs to commemorate the wedding. The couple gave a final interview to ITV's This Morning on 11 October 2018, released before the live coverage of the wedding. Wedding= Planning = The Duke of York announced shortly after the engagement announcement that the wedding would be held on Friday, 12 October 2018. Eugenie, who is a supporter of charities that battle plastic pollution, stated that she was organizing a plastic-free wedding ceremony. The couple reportedly hired Peregrine Armstrong-Jones, founder of Bentley's Entertainment and half-brother of Princess Margaret's husband, the Earl of Snowdon, to plan the wedding parties. Rob Van Helden designed an autumnal floral theme for the ceremony using roses, hydrangeas, dahlias and berries from Windsor Great Park. The Duke of York later described the event as a family wedding, rather than a public one. = Venue = St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle Following the engagement announcement, it was subsequently announced that the wedding would take place in autumn 2018 at St George's Chapel, Windsor, a few months after the wedding of her cousin, Prince Harry, making it the second royal wedding at the chapel this year. The venue was previously the site for the weddings of her uncle the Earl of Wessex and cousin Peter Phillips, as well as the blessing for the second marriage of her uncle the Prince of Wales. The Duke of York later revealed that it was the Queen who suggested St George's Chapel to be used as the venue for the ceremony. =Cost= The wedding itself and the parties were paid for privately by the bride's parents and family, not by the public as commonly thought. The royal family also paid for flowers, entertainment and the dress. Experts expected the wedding to cost the public around £2 million due to security, Thames Valley Police having confirmed they would be responsible for security on the day. The cost of providing security was expected to be lower than for the weddings of Princes William and Harry, but an exact estimate has not been given. Thames Valley Police were expected to use a special grant provided by the tax payer to cover its costs. Windsor and Maidenhead Borough Council was to spend money on stewarding and setting up parking, and were expected to receive a government reimbursement. This caused controversy across the country with many people, including Labour Party Members of Parliament Emma Dent Coad and Chris Williamson, claiming they should not contribute. Republic, an anti-monarchist group, launched a petition asking the House of Commons to withdraw public funding for the wedding. The petition received around 50,000 signatures. = Wedding attire = The wedding invitations specified a dress code for men of \\"dress, morning coat\\" and for women, \\"day dress and hat\\".  Bride and bridal attendants  The bride wore a long-sleeved ivory \\"open-back\\" dress with folded shoulders and flowing full length train designed by Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos. Eugenie, who did not wear any veil, wanted her scar from the scoliosis operation that she had undergone at the age of 12 to be revealed. The bride also wore a pair of diamond and emerald earrings, gifted to her by Brooksbank. The Queen lent her granddaughter the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, which was made in 1919 by Boucheron for Dame Margaret Greville and bequeathed by Mrs. Greville to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1942. It features \\"brilliant and rose cut diamonds pavé set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side\\". For the customary bridal themes of \\"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\\", Eugenie had her emerald drop earrings (the \\"new\\"), the Queen's tiara (the \\"borrowed\\"), and a handful of \\"blue thistle flowers\\" in her bouquet (the \\"blue\\"). Hairstylist Sonny-Jo MacFarlane styled Eugenie's hair in a \\"loose chignon\\". The bride wore shoes by Charlotte Olympia. Her bouquet, created by Patrice Van Helden Oakes, consisted of \\"Lily of the Valley, Stephanotis pips, hints of baby blue thistles, white spray roses, trailing ivy, and sprigs of myrtle from Osborne House\\". After the wedding the bridal bouquet was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey, following royal tradition that began with the Queen Mother. Bobbi Brown make- up artist Hannah Martin did Eugenie's make-up for the ceremony. Maid-of-honour Princess Beatrice wore an outfit by Ralph & Russo and a hat by Sarah Cant. The bridesmaids and pageboys wore dresses and uniforms designed by Amaia Arrieta. The design incorporates the Mark Bradford artwork included in the Order of Service. The bridesmaids carried flowers by Rob Van Helden similar to that of the bride's bouquet. The special attendant, Lady Louise Windsor, wore a dress by Claudie Pierlot and a hat by Emily London.  Groom and best man  The groom and the best man wore morning dress with tie pins given to them by Eugenie which featured \\"the white rose of York and the Padparadscha sapphire\\". =Wedding party= On 10 October 2018, Buckingham Palace confirmed that Eugenie had picked her sister, Princess Beatrice of York, as maid of honour after having previously announced it in a Vogue interview in August. It was confirmed that Thomas Brooksbank, brother of the groom, would be his best man, and that the bridesmaids and page boys would all be children. A total of six bridesmaids and two page boys were chosen: Eugenie's godchild, Maud Windsor, daughter of Lord and Lady Frederick Windsor, her cousin Peter Phillips' daughters Isla and Savannah Phillips, her cousin Zara Tindall's elder daughter Mia Tindall, her cousin the Duke of Cambridge's eldest children Prince George and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, as well as Theodora Williams, daughter of Ayda Field and Robbie Williams, and Louis de Givenchy, son of Olivier and Zoë de Givenchy. Eugenie's cousins Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn, were also confirmed to be special attendants. Members of the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards, of which the Duke of York is Colonel, lined the West Steps of the chapel as the couple depart for their carriage procession. =Wedding service= On 14 September 2018, the palace announced that the ceremony would commence at 11:00am. Members of the Royal Family started to arrive at the chapel at 10:25am. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to depart for the ceremony, as is traditional, arriving at the chapel at 10.52am. Shortly after, the bride arrived in a 1977 Rolls Royce Phantom VI and proceeded down the aisle escorted by her father. He accompanied her through the Nave to the Organ Screen, where the groom and the best man were standing. After the introduction had been read by the Dean of Windsor, the couple along with the best man and the bride's father were led through the Quire Gates and into the Quire of the Chapel. It had been announced that the Dean of Windsor, David Conner, would give the Address at their Wedding. The Dean also officiated as the couple made their marriage vows. The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, had written a personal prayer for the service, which was included in the Order of Service. Brooksbank's first cousin, Charles Brooksbank, gave the first reading taken from St Paul's Letter to the Colossians (Chapter 3, verses 12–16), followed by another reading by Princess Beatrice of York taken from The Great Gatsby. The marriage vows were those published in Common Worship, and included the promise \\"to love and to cherish\\" each other. This was sealed by putting a ring on the fourth finger of bride's left hand. The ring is made out of the Welsh gold. After the signing of the registers, Eugenie and Brooksbank together with the guests sang the national anthem. The couple paused briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen before walking down the aisle. They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party and by their families. The couple shared a kiss on the steps outside the chapel. =Music= Members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the State Trumpeter of the Household Cavalry trumpeters provided music for the service. James Vivian, the Director of Music at St George's Chapel, prepared two hymns exclusively for the couple. Hymns sung at the wedding included \\"Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken\\" words by John Newton, tune Austria; \\"Immortal, Invisible, God Only Wise\\" words by Walter Chalmers Smith, tune \\"St Denio\\"; and Love Divine, All Loves Excelling words by Charles Wesley, tune Blaenwerm. Andrea Bocelli also performed two pieces: the Bach/Gounod Ave Maria, and Panis angelicus by César Franck. During the signing of the registers, the choir sang Ubi caritas from Quatre Motets sur des thèmes grégoriens by Maurice Duruflé and \\"My spirit sang all day\\" by Gerald Finzi. The Scots Guards performed as a personal link to Brooksbank's great grandfather, Sir Jack Coke, who was an officer in the regiment. As the couple departed the chapel for the carriage procession, pipers from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland performed \\"Scottish pieces\\" from the Garter Tower. The recessional was the Final from the Symphonie No 1 by Louis Vierne. =Family celebrations= There was a carriage procession through Windsor after the ceremony in the Scottish State Coach, \\"leaving Castle Hill and proceeding along part of the High Street before returning to the castle via Cambridge Gate\\". The couple decided to use an enclosed carriage due to windy weather. An estimated crowd of 3,000 people lined the streets to watch the couple during the procession. There was a reception hosted by the Queen at Windsor Castle. The Duke of York is said to have delivered a speech at the reception. This was followed by a black-tie reception that evening at Royal Lodge, the Duke of York's official residence, with a third celebration the next day hosted by the bride's parents. Brooksbank drove his new wife to the reception at the Royal Lodge in a silver Aston Martin DB10, one of the eight models made for the 2015 James Bond movie Spectre. For the evening reception, Princess Eugenie wore a silk gown designed by Zac Posen. The \\"pin-tucked plisse\\" dress was \\"cut on the bias and mixed with signature drapes\\", and \\"the White Rose of York was embroidered on both the shoulder and back which held together the cape\\". Biddle Sawyer Silks provided the silk for the gown. Eugenie adorned her hair with a hair slide that belongs to the Queen. It was originally commissioned by King William IV in 1830 for Queen Adelaide. The Wheat-Ear brooches were passed to the Queen in 1952. The monarch has since worn them as both hair slides and brooches. The wedding cake was a 5-tier red velvet and chocolate cake made by London-based cake designer Sophie Cabot. Four official wedding photos taken by Alex Bramall were released the day after the ceremony. Two of them were taken at Windsor Castle following the wedding service, while the third one showed the couple inside the Scottish State Coach, and the fourth one was taken at the Royal Lodge, during the private black-tie reception. =Guests= The guest list included approximately 850 people. The Duchess of Cornwall was absent from the ceremony as she was on a trip to Scotland to visit the Crathie Primary School and the Alford Community Campus in Aberdeenshire. Clarence House described the Duchess's engagements as a \\"previous commitment\\". A reported weekend house party at Birkhall was seen as another reason due to which the Duchess might have decided to not attend the wedding. The Duchess of Kent, who is in a semi-retired state, did not attend the wedding, as well as Princess Alexandra, who had broken her arm. Amongst the non-royal guests were Naomi Campbell, Demi Moore, Ellie Goulding, Cara Delevingne, Poppy Delevingne, Liv Tyler, Ricky Martin, Pixie Geldof, Eric Buterbaugh, Robbie Williams, Ayda Field, Tracy Emin, Stephen Fry, Kate Moss, James Blunt, Jack Whitehall, Chelsy Davy, Cressida Bonas, and members of the Middleton family. On 18 July 2018, the royal family's and the Duke of York's websites announced that 1,200 people from across the United Kingdom were going to be invited to the grounds of Windsor Castle. The Palace received over 100,000 applications, and the invitations to those that were selected to join them on the day were sent out on 12 September. Among those present in the castle grounds were representatives from the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, the Teenage Cancer Trust, the Salvation Army and the UN Trust Fund to End Violence Against Women, which are all charities supported by Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, together with members of the Windsor community and children from the local schools which Eugenie attended. Residents of Windsor Castle and a number of Royal Household staff were also present. Gifts for guests The 1,200 members of the public invited to Windsor Castle for the wedding were given commemorative gift bags. Each bag had the initials of the couple, the date and the venue printed on the exterior. Inside was an order of service booklet, a chocolate coin, a can of water, a fridge magnet, a poncho, and a pocket-size tube of shortbread. Coverage Coverage of the royal wedding in the United Kingdom was shown on ITV's This Morning, hosted by Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. An average audience of 3 million people watched the wedding coverage on ITV, the channel's best ratings for the time slot since the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's 2011 wedding. BBC did not broadcast the ceremony live, but they had full coverage across their news services. Sky News also reported the highlights of the event. In the United States, a simulcast of ITV's coverage of the wedding and carriage procession was shown live exclusively on cable network TLC beginning at 4:25 AM EDT. It was then be rebroadcast in its entirety beginning at 7:25 AM EDT. Both broadcasts aired on a three-hour tape delay in the west coast. The network also made their full wedding coverage available on their TLC Go mobile app at the conclusion of the live airing. In Australia, the wedding was broadcast on Channel 7, starting at 20:00 PM Sydney time. The coverage was watched by 1.5 million viewers nationally, making it the highest rated program on Australian television for the day. On 10 October, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the wedding would be streamed live on the Royal Family's and the Duke of York's media channels beginning at 10:00 AM (BST). Live updates and material were also released throughout the day. Title Since her wedding, the Court Circular has used the style \\"Princess Eugenie, Mrs. Jack Brooksbank\\". Although it was speculated that Brooksbank would receive the title Earl of Northallerton, such rumors were dismissed by representatives of the York family. Honeymoon It is not clear when the couple left for their honeymoon. The location of the honeymoon has been kept secret, although the press speculated that they might have been headed to locations such as Switzerland, Nicaragua, Italy, the Caribbean, and the Seychelles.

Prior to that he was a Special Justice and Associate Justice of the court, starting in 1928. Early life and education Adlow was born in the West End of Boston, Massachusetts to Jewish immigrant parents. His father, Nathan Adlow, emigrated as a youth from Kazarez, Poland, His mother, Bessie (Bravman) Adlow, was born in Dauge, Lithuania. The family moved from the West End to East Boston, and afterwards settled in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston a year after Nathan opened a furniture store there. Due to changes in rules and policies made both by Adlow's elementary school and the Boston Public Schools, he completed grammar school in 1908 at age 11. He entered English High School the following school year, graduating in 1912 at 16 years old. Later that year, Adlow attended Harvard University, which he went through in three years, graduating cum laude in 1915. Two years later, he was graduated from Harvard Law School, and after passing his bar exam, he served in the Navy until the end of World War I.\\"JUDGE ELIJAH ADLOW, 45 YEARS ON THE BENCH\\" The Boston Globe, page 1, November 6, 1982.

From 1927 until he was appointed a judge in 1928, he served as special counsel for the City of Boston. He was a member of the National Guard from 1924 until 1954, when he retired with the rank of brigadier general. From 1930 to 1942, he was judge advocate of the 26th Yankee Division and entered federal service with the division in 1941. After World War II, he was a member of the adjutant general's staff. Adlow's judicial career began in October 1928 when he was appointed Special Justice of the Municipal Court by Governor Alvan T. Fuller.\\"JUDGE ADLOW TAKES OATH OF OFFICE\\" The Boston Globe, page 2, October 11, 1928. His position with the court was made permanent one year later when Governor Frank G.

Life Airthrey Loch with Airthrey Castle behind The Pullar Memorial, Logie Kirkyard He was born in Bridge of Allan near Stirling on 20 January 1875 the son of the industrialist Laurence Pullar and his wife, Ellen Ferguson Pattison. He was educated at Stanley House School at Bridge of Allan then at the High School in Stirling. He then attended the West of Scotland Technical College in Glasgow. Around 1893 he entered the family firm of Pullars of Perth founded by his grandfather, John Pullar, in the 1820s.http://maps.nls.uk/bathymetric/biographies.html In 1897 Frederick's father Laurence Pullar commissioned his friend, Sir John Murray to undertake an entire survey of all Scottisgh fresh water lochs.http://maps.nls.uk/bathymetric/chart/2156 This was on condition that Sir John employed his then 22 year old son Frederick to assist in the task. However, Frederick, although having no formal university training, proved more than competent in this role. Frederick and Sir John spent over three years together, surveying 15 lochs beginning with Loch Lubnaig. In this they utilised a device known as Pullar's Sounding Machine.https://rsgsexplorers.com/2016/05/03/sir-john-murray-beneath-the- surface/ The sounding machine appears to have been named after the father, rather than Frederick, the father having undertaken his own highly competent bathymetrical surveys from at least 1885.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scottish_geographical_magazine_(1885)_(14597429968).jpg In 1901 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir John Murray, Alexander Buchan, Robert Munro and John Horne. On 15 February 1901 he was skating with several hundred people on Airthrey Loch in front of Airthrey Castle, when the ice gave way. Accounts related that Pullar rescued three people and returned to rescue a young lady. Sadly both he and the lady then drowned. He is buried in Logie Churchyard, just east of Stirling.http://maps.nls.uk/bathymetric/biographies.html The beautiful memorial stands east of the church and was commissioned by his parents from the sculptor George Frampton. They were later buried beside him. The results of his work and his measuring device brought about the publication of the Bathymetrical Survey of the Fresh Water Lochs of Scotland in 1910.

Titanium alloy is often used in medical and military applications because of its strength, weight, and corrosion resistance characteristics. In implantable medical devices, titanium is used because of its biocompatibility and its passive, stable oxide layer.Linjiang Chai et al. Microstructural characterization and hardness variation of pure Ti surface-treated by pulsed laser. Journal of Alloys and Compounds, January 2018. Pg. 116-122. Also, titanium allergies are rare and in those cases mitigations like Parylene coating are used. In the aerospace industry titanium is often bonded to save cost, touch times, and the need for mechanical fasteners. In the past, Russian submarines' hulls were completely made of titanium because the non-magnetic nature of the material went undetected by the defense technology at that time. Bonding adhesive to titanium requires preparing the surface beforehand, and there is not a single solution for all applications. For example, etchant and chemical methods are not biocompatible and cannot be employed when the device will come into contact with blood and tissue. Mechanical surface roughness techniques like sanding and laser roughening may make the surface brittle and create micro- hardness regions that would not be suitable for cyclic loading found in military applications. Air oxidation at high temperatures will produce a crystalline oxide layer at a lower investment cost, but the increased temperatures can deform precision parts. The type of adhesive, thermosetting or thermoplastic, and curing methods are also factors in titanium bonding because of the adhesive's interaction with the treated oxide layer. Surface treatments can also be combined. For example, a grit blast process can be followed by a chemical etch and a primer application.  Abrasives  Aluminium oxide or Alumina and Silicon carbide are most commonly used to prepare titanium for epoxy bonding. Alumina has a hardness of 9 on the Mohs scale while silicon carbide has a hardness of just under that of diamond. Alumina particle sizes in the 10 to 150 micron range are used depending on the workpiece geometry and blasting capabilities. Silicon carbide particles are typically in the 20 to 50 micron range with texturing occurring at a faster pace than alumina. When silicon carbide hits the titanium surface the operator will see sparks as is common with titanium surfaced golf drivers when they hit the ground surface. Care must be taken if sensitive electronic assemblies are housed within the titanium enclosure. Electrostatic discharge can be mitigated with point ionizers or grounding features in the tools. Glass beads media are used less commonly. They come as spherical particles in the 35-100 micron range. They are a 6 on the Mohs scale and are oftentimes used with water to create a hydrohone slurry. When applied to commercially pure titanium material they will stress relieve the assembly, typically after welding, and create a satin-like finish perfect for laser marking of labels. The surface is also suitable as preparation for assemblies prior to vapor deposition of Parylene coating. Silicon carbide grit blast on a commercially pure titanium sample - 500X magnification. Surface roughness is achieved through the use of a blasting nozzle propelled by compressed air. The focus and velocity of the media created by the nozzle can be varied depending on the roughness requirements and repeatability. Surface roughness measured using Ra, Sa and Sdr is used to characterize the media application and the adhesive bonding strength. Typical Ra values for commercially pure titanium are between 0.2 and 0.75 micro meters.S. Zimmermann et al. Improved adhesion at titanium surfaces via laser-induced surface oxidation and roughening. Materials Science & Engineering, August 2012. Pg. 755-760. The surface roughness can be tailored to the epoxy viscosity and curing conversion. The roughened surface is rinsed with process water or an alkaline cleaner and is often sealed with a primer application like Silane A-187 or alkoxide. Application of the primer can be achieved through manual means, like a brush. It can also be sprayed on the roughened surface or the whole assembly can be dipped in a primer solution and cured. On commercially pure titanium surfaces that have been roughened with silicon carbide, a silane primer will darken the surface allowing for verification of application. Implantable medical devices are often manufactured in a cleanroom environment. Typical cleanroom ratings are within the ISO-7 and ISO-8 range or between class 10k and 100k. Abrasives and their application cannot be housed in such cleanrooms. If pass through windows are not available then laser roughening is a good option.  Laser roughening  Grade 1 Ti Laser Roughened Contact Angle Measurement. Laser roughening of titanium surfaces for epoxy bonding is a good option when abrasives and chemical agents are restricted in the manufacturing area. The process is also more repeatable and consistent than the often manual abrasive blasting. Other advantages over abrasives are touch time and maintenance. The drawback of laser roughening is the cost of the equipment and tooling. Also, the laser will heat the material depending on its power output and number of passes. It will remove material from the surface and create regions of hardened material that get relocated within the surface. Neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), CO2, green, femtosecond lasers can be used depending on the workpiece and adhesion requirements. YAG or fiber laser markers that anneal the titanium surface are the low cost solution while the femtosecond laser is on the high end of the cost scale. Surface roughness of laser roughened surfaces is best measured using a three-dimensional scanning laser microscope or a non-contact profilometer. XPS and SEM analysis of alloyed titanium, like grade 5, will show the segregation of the aluminum and vanadium. Oftentimes, the laser roughening is done in ambient conditions with or without argon shielding gas. Ambient elements that play no role in bonding like carbon and nitrogen can be ignored from the surface analysis. Laser roughening of grade 5 titanium will show that the vanadium will segregate to the bulk of the alloy and appear at the surface with an increased oxygen level. Lap shear tests have shown that this segregation does not affect surface adhesion. The increase of laser power has shown to increase oxidation of grade 5 titanium which has been correlated to increase bond strength.Palmieri et al. Laser Ablation Surface Preparation of Ti-6Al-4V for Adhesive Bonding. NASA Langley Research Center; Hampton, VA, United States, 2012. Also, producing alumina at the surface has shown to improve bonding. Dimples created by multiple laser pulses increase the surface area for adhesion, but the center of the topography will have reduced oxide formation because of the laser-induced plasma.J.I. Ahuir-Torres et al. Influence of laser parameters in surface texturing of Ti6Al4V and AA2024-T3 alloys, September 2017. Optics and Lasers in Engineering. Pages 100-109. Depending on the grade of titanium and the adhesive used, the laser parameters of power, frequency, and pattern can be tailored to the loading requirements and the aforementioned surface elemental beneficial conditions. Unwanted metal oxide can occur when higher laser powers and multiple passes are employed. These can be removed with a lower powered laser pass or a titanium brush, post roughening. The grain size will affect the surface roughness, hardness, and wettability of the surface. On grade 2 titanium, a smaller grain structure improved these surface prep characteristics.H. Garbacz et al. The effect of grain size on the surface properties of titanium grade 2 after different treatments. Surface & Coating Technology, May 2017. Pages 13-24. As with abrasives, a silane primer application is used to seal the laser roughened surface. Commercially pure titanium roughened using a fiber laser .001 inch spacing, 100 inches/second speed - 500X magnification.  Etchant, chemical and anodizing preparation  Prior to these treatments a solvent degreaser should be used with an alumina grit blast to remove unwanted oxides on the surface. A 1982 study at the Naval Air Development Center compared 11 etchant, chemical and anodizing preparations on grade 5 titanium samples. Once bonded, these samples were exposed to 56 days of 140 degrees F and 100% relative humidity. Crack growth was measured at preselected intervals. The results showed that chromic acid anodizing with fluoride, etchants Turco 5578, Pasa Jell 107C – hydrohone, Pasa Jell 107M – dry hone, Dapcotreat 4023/4000 and alkaline peroxide were superior to phosphate fluoride preparations.S.R. Brown and G.J. Pilla, Titanium Surface Treatments for Adhesive Bonding, Naval Air Development Center Warminster, Pa 1982. Turco 5578-L is a commonly used etchant and alkaline cleaner for titanium. It is produced by Henkel Technologies and comes in a liquid form so concentrations can be easily modified. It is an anisotropic etchant that avoids hydrogen embrittlement. When used on Grade 5 titanium it will produce an oxide layer 17.5 nm thick and a surface roughness of 3.4 um total height profile (Rt).G.W. Critchlow and D.M. Brewis. Review of surface pretreatments for titanium alloys. Institute of Surface Science & Technology, February 1995. Pages 161-172. In a chromic acid treatment the anodization is typically done at 5 or 10 volts. The 1982 study referred to above stated that the 5 volt performed better than the 10 volt as a function of average crack opening. In the Review of preparation for Ti, Critchlow and Brewis state that the 10 volt anodize showed better durability results. The 10 volt anodize can produce a columnar and cellular oxide layer with a thickness between 80 and 500 nm. The pores and whiskers produced can be penetrated by selecting a low viscosity adhesive, like a 3M 1838 epoxide resin or an Epo-Tek 301 epoxy. The surface oxide can be compromised if it is subjected to high temperatures, above 300 °C, and humidity prior to bonding. Pasa Jell wet and dry hone are chemical etchants produced by Semco. They create oxide thicknesses of 10-20 nm. It is recommended to degrease the titanium surface and remove any corrosion by way of sanding and/or grit blasting prior to application. Typical application times are 10–15 minutes followed by a rinse with tap water. Application of a corrosion inhibiting primer like BR-127 has shown to produce adhesive joints comparable to ones produced by the chromic acid anodizing process.

It is her second novel and takes place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where Ng grew up. The novel is about two families living in 1990s Shaker Heights who are brought together through their children. The author described writing about her hometown as \\"a little bit like writing about a relative. You see all of the great things about them, you love them dearly, and yet, you also know all of their quirks and their foibles.\\" For three weeks in April 2020, Little Fires Everywhere was #1 on The New York Times fiction best-seller list, concurrent with the release of a television adaptation of the book. Plot The story starts in 1998 where the Richardson home in Shaker Heights, Ohio catches fire. Arson is suspected, as there were multiple small fires. The previous year, 1997, Elena Richardson rents her rental home on Winslow Road to Mia Warren, an artist, and her teenage daughter, Pearl. Elena's younger son, Moody, who is Pearl's age, develops a crush on Pearl and becomes friends with her. Through Moody, Pearl meets the rest of the Richardson siblings: Lexie, Trip, and Izzy. Pearl, who is used to a transient lifestyle in which her mother scrapes together money, is charmed by the Richardsons and their established home. She spends time every day at their home, develops a crush on Trip, and idolizes Lexie. Mia works part-time at a Chinese restaurant called the Lucky Palace and sells photographs through a dealer named Anita Rees in New York. She becomes concerned about Pearl's idealization of the Richardsons. When Elena condescendingly offers her a job doing housekeeping for her family, she agrees only to keep an eye on Pearl. She meets Izzy, the black sheep of the family, and the two become close. The Richardsons are invited to the birthday party of Mirabelle Rose McCullough, the adopted daughter of Elena's friends, Linda and Mark. After talking with Bebe Chow, a coworker at Lucky Palace, Mia learns that the child is actually named May Ling Chow and is Bebe's daughter, whom she left at a firehouse in the middle of a postpartum episode and economic hardship. Bebe has been looking for her child for over a year. Bebe is despondent as she has no money for lawyers. Mia advises her to get the local news involved. The scandal results in Bebe getting visitation rights and help from an Asian lawyer named Edward Lim pro bono. Elena discovers that Bebe learned of her child's whereabouts through Mia. Angry on behalf of her friend, she investigates Mia's past. She tracks down Mia's parents and learns that Pearl was conceived by Mia for a wealthy New York couple named Joseph and Madeline Ryan who were unable to have children of their own. Mia could not face the idea of giving up her child. She told the couple that she miscarried and ran away with Pearl; Mia's parents hadn't heard from her since. Lexie gets pregnant and asks Pearl to come with her to get an abortion. Afraid of being discovered, Lexie uses Pearl's name at the clinic. Pearl takes Lexie back to her mom's house, and Mia cares for Lexie while keeping the abortion a secret from the rest of the Richardson family. Pearl and Trip begin to have sex, which they keep a secret from everyone. When Moody discovers what's going on, he and Pearl stop speaking. Elena investigates a suspicion that Bebe had an abortion and, to her shock, discovers Pearl is listed as having had one. She confronts Moody about being the father, but he tells her she is accusing the wrong son. Bebe Chow loses her case and Mia comforts her. Elena confronts Mia about finding Pearl's name at the abortion clinic, and asks Mia to move out. Pearl is reluctant to go, but when Mia reveals the truth about her family and Pearl's father, Pearl gains a deeper understanding for her mother, and agrees to leave Shaker Heights. Izzy realizes that Moody, Lexie, and Trip have all used Pearl in their own way and becomes angry at them. She attempts to visit the Warrens, but finds the rental home vacant. Choosing a moment when they are all out of the house, she pours gasoline on each of her siblings' beds, not realizing that her mother is still in the house. She lights the fires and leaves. After the fire, the Richardsons go to the rental home, now vacated by the Warrens, where they find that Mia has left them with photographs that have personal significance to each of them. Bebe Chow, using Mia's words as inspiration, sneaks into the McCulloughs' home and kidnaps her daughter, flying with her to Canton. The McCulloughs unsuccessfully spend thousands of dollars searching for them. Eventually, they are approved to adopt a baby from China. Mia and Pearl hit the road, planning to reconnect with Mia's family and Pearl's father. Izzy runs away to Pittsburgh with the name of Mia's parents, promising herself that if she is caught and returned, she will continue to run away until she is never forced to come back again. Elena realizes that her greatest fear, losing Izzy, has come true, and vows to spend the rest of her life looking for her daughter.

Early 16th century Southeast Asia countries faced the sedimentation of states and were propelled towards modern day civilization. This formation began through Southeast Asian contact with foreign groups and the adaptation and integration of such culture into the demographics and geography of Southeast Asia. Post-1500 Southeast Asia Archaeology, is often referred to as the archaeology of colonization as it focuses on the period of European colonization in Southeast Asia. Archeology of colonization thus is the analysis of trade ports, colonial and indigenous communities, and the study of historic and cultural patterns. Additionally, archaeology of colonization hopes to gain a deeper understanding of the history and culture of indigenous communities in particular, because history is often told and influenced by the more powerful groups, which is in this case, colonizers. Colonial perspectives have resulted in a lack of archaeological research or anthropological support that better understands the effect of European powers in Southeast Asia. In the following paper we provide a brief overview of European colonization in Southeast Asian countries, specifically by the Spanish in Philippines, English in Singapore, Dutch in Indonesia, British in Brunei, and French/British in Vietnam. All of which began and expanded through the silk route and spice trade. We also discuss the limited archaeological work that has been conducted in these areas and the insight this provides into the culture, geography, and social and political systems of these countries beginning in the 16th century.  European colonization of Southeast Asia  The source of many material distributions in Southeast Asia was a result of the Silk Road era; it consisted of historical sea and land trade routes across Afro-Eurasian that connects East, South, and Western Asia with the Mediterranean and the European world. It also included North and East Africa. The Silk Road consisted of trade routes that were expanding overtime due to different colonies’ desires for specific items.Waugh, D. C. (2010). The silk roads in history. Expedition: The magazine of the University of Pennsylvania, (52), 9-22. = The Silk Road Trade = The 15th to 17th centuries was a time known as the “age of discovery” in Southeast Asia because of the recognition and demand of SE Asia's natural resources from European powers.Dean, G. (1999). The Importance and Consequences of Trade in Southeast Asia till 1870. In SE Asia, spices were useful and popular for creating flavor in food. Spices were in high demand and were imported and exported through the Silk Road, which flourished during the colonization period. It included black pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, turmeric, nutmeg, and cloves, nutmeg, etc. Nutmeg was the most popular and most expensive to get because of how scarce it was. = European colonization of Southeast Asia = The European colonization of Southeast Asia began in the 16th century when the Dutch and Portuguese colonized Southeast Asia for their spices. Throughout the 17th and 18th century, the British and Dutch began to colonize Southeast Asia. The Dutch arrived in Batavia and established Dutch East Indies. The British established themselves in the Straits Settlements, British Malaya, Borneo, and Burma. In the 19th century, the French established French Indochina. All of Southeast Asia was colonized, except Thailand. Not only spices, but also ceramics, stoneware, and porcelain were popular items used for trading in Southeast Asia. Mainland Southeast Asia is distinguished by the ongoing complementary coexistence of two major ceramic traditions- earthenware and stoneware. The first evidence of earthware ceramics was in Japan 12,000 years ago. Pottery and clay vessels originated from China 20,000 years ago. The earliest forms of stoneware were found in Indus Valley Civilisation and China. The Xia Dynasty, during 1700-1050 BCE, had evidence of the earliest forms of stoneware, which is a source of where the product originated from. Stoneware production has continued for more than three thousand years. These two basic types of clay bodies have been used for processing, amending, and forming of the clay body; the use of resins, pigments, slips, and glazes; and the development of firing procedures and kilns.Kurin, R. (2002). The silk road: connecting peoples and cultures. The Silk Road: connecting cultures, creating trust: the 36th annual Smithsonian Folklife Festival on the National Mall, 26-30. = Dutch colonization of Indonesia = The Dutch used trade to change the political and physical geography of Indonesia. The first Dutch fleet arrived in Indonesia in 1596 and in 1619 they seized Jakarta (the Capital of Indonesia) and established the city of Batavia.Tarling, N. (Ed.). (1992). The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia: Volume 1, from Early Times to C. 1800 (Vol. 1). Cambridge University Press. Forts were established to ensure they maintained power and control, some of the most historic forts can be found in the Banda Islands, also known as the spice islands. A well-known fort is Fort Nassua, in the Banda Islands. It was built by the Dutch in 1609, it was the center for the Vereenigde Oost- Indische Compagnie (VOC), \\"United East India Company\\", which was the primary trading company of the Dutch.Hanna, W. A. (1978). Indonesian Banda: Colonialism and its aftermath in the Nutmeg Islands. Institute for the study of human issues. Similarly to Batavia, the Banda Islands were used as a center for trade and a place to capitalize on the spice market. In the 16th century the Banda Islands were the only known source of nutmeg, consequently making them a major site for power in the world of trade.Jordan, A. J. (2016). The Price of Spice: Archaeological Investigations of Colonial Era Nutmeg Plantations on the Banda Islands, Maluku Province, Indonesia (Doctoral dissertation).  Archaeological Evidence in Dutch Forts and the Banda Islands  The Dutch forts, Fort Diamond and Fort Speelwijk in Banten, Java were studied and analyzed to shed light on the interaction between Bantanese elite and the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Archaeological evidence, such as utensils and vessels that were used to prepare and serve meals show that there was a sort of “reverse” colonialism were indigenous Bantanese culture had a greater influence on the Dutch, than vice versa.Ueda, K. (2015). An archaeological investigation of hybridization in Bantenese and Dutch colonial encounters: Food and foodways in the sultanate of Banten, Java, 17 th-early 19 th century. Boston University. Another site of archaeological work can be found in the Banda Islands. The Banda Islands, specifically an area known as Groot Walling, was studied to find whether nutmeg plantations were used as a signal of social identity. The study thus focused on material culture to see if inhabitants reacted to shifts in social and political control and the different trade distributions of goods. Findings, such as a combination of ceramic, funal remains, and starch grins were analyzed, there was evidence of both European and Chinese tradeware but European, specifically English and Dutch tradeware dominates. Findings thus suggest that indigenous inhabitants may have adopted symbols of elite power through trading. Another study, conducted by archaeologists, Carlson and Jordan, also studied Groot Walling and the culture of the plantation in the 16th century. They tested the hypothesis that the plantation was used to produce inequality and as a way for inhabitants to patrol and surveil each other. They studied the design of the plantation compound; their findings eventually refuted their hypothesis and instead suggested a different form of surveillance. A system, unlike those in the Caribbean islands which adhere to strong social control.CARlSoN, D. R., & Jordan, A. (2013). Visibility and Power: Preliminary Analysis of Social Control on a Bandanese Plantation Compound, Eastern Indonesia. Asian Perspectives, 52(2), 213-243. = Spanish colonization of the Philippines = An expedition lead by Ferdinand Magellan was the headwind of the Spanish conquest of the Philippine islands, followed by expeditions headed by López de Villalobos, who in 1542, named the islands after King Philip.Borlaza, Gregorio C., and Carolina G. Hernandez. “Philippines.” Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 23 Feb. 2018, www.britannica.com/place/Philippines/The-Spanish-period. Archeological evidence in the form of the wreckage of the San Diego ship, and the artifacts left behind suggest that the Spaniards arriving in the Philippines were there for conquest. San Diego's Astrolabe was a part of the San Diego's shipwreck, found along with many other artifacts including cannons and guns off the coast of Nasugbu, dates back to December 14, 1600. The heavy load of artillery brought over by the Spanish correlates strongly with the time of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.Fish, S. (2011). The Manila-Acapulco galleons: the treasure ships of the Pacific: with an annotated list of the transpacific galleons 1565-1815. AuthorHouse. In 1564 the first moves towards colonizing were taken by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. The Spanish city of Manila was established in the Philippines in 1571, effectively establishing Spanish roots in the Philippines. The Spanish colonizers began cutting out all threats to their grip on power, starting with the increasing Chinese population in 1603, massacring thousands of Chinese people.  Evidence of Philippine Archaeology  Archeological evidence of the presence of the Chinese in the Philippines was present in the form of the Oton Death Mask. The death mask, dated between the 14th and the 15th century A.D., was discovered by Alfredo Evangelista and F. Landa Jocan in the city of San Antonio, Oton. This archeological find suggests that the Southern Chinese traders brought this practice over to the Philippines. This mask was used to protect the dead from evil spirits.National Museum Collections, (2014). National Cultural Treasures of Philippine Archaeology. Another piece of archeological evidence that suggests Chinese presence in the Philippines is the Flying Elephant of Leona Shoal. The Flying Elephant was a blue and white china dish dating to the 15th century A.D. from the Ming Dynasty in China.“VCM.” VIRTUAL COLLECTION OF ASIAN MASTERPIECES, 1997, masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=11376. Not only was their cultural diffusion between the Chinese and Philippines, through diffusion of religious practices, but also material culture. In 1941, WWII hit the Philippines with the Japanese invasion, which ultimately resulted in the Philippine-US forces being defeated in 1942. Many Japanese artifacts are still being found until this day in the Philippines, including five Japanese warships from the battle of Surigao Strait in 1944.Kyodo, Staff Report. “Wrecks of Japanese and U.S. Warships - Including First American Vessel to Fire Shot in WWII - Found off Philippines.” The Japan Times, 8 Dec. 2017, www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/08/national/history/wrecks- believed-5-japanese-wartime-ships-found-southern-philippines/#.WpSDcIJG2b8. = British colonization of Singapore = Insular Southeast Asia is known as one of the most beautiful regions on earth today. When people immerse themselves into the various cultures that are a part of Southeast Asia, they find that influences from colonialism have shaped the native people's perspectives and ways of life. For example, Singapore has been colonized by British influence, and has resulted in adaptation to their culture. Through this adaptation, colonization from Britain has allowed the native people of Singapore to develop interest in finding their roots through archaeological excavations. Archaeology in Singapore is relatively new, with excavations beginning in the 20th century. The findings, however, have dated back to ancient China. Taking it back to the beginning of colonization, Stamford Raffles of Britain colonized Singapore in 1819. He identified the island as a choice for a new port, and began negotiations with the ruler of the land at the time, the Sultan of Johor. Upon agreement, a treaty was signed and modern Singapore was born. Not until 1824 did the entire region of Singapore land in Britain's possession. In 1826, Singapore was included in the Straits Settlements, which were a larger collection of Southeast Asian countries that were made British colonies.Miksic, J. N., & Low, C. A. M. G. (Eds.). (2004). Early Singapore, 1300s-1819: Evidence in Maps, Text and Artefacts. Singapore History Museum. Trade and export became a huge part of Singapore, and through this was once considered the main place for trading and exporting by the British. The people of Singapore had then acclimated the surrounding culture, allowing them to adopt British mannerisms and ideologies which are still valid in modern Singapore.Polanyi, K., Arensberg, C. M., & Pearson, H. W. (1957). Trade and market in the early empires: Economies in history and theory (No. 338 (091)). Free Press,. World War II prompted a change in ruling for Singapore. The failure of Britain to successfully defend Singapore had destroyed their credibility and trust. After a decline in order of the country, the infrastructure and economy started to steadily rise with the rising demand of tin and rubber from other regions.Zaini, S. A. (1997). Metal finds and metal-working at the parliament house complex, Singapore (Doctoral dissertation, MA Thesis, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor).  Singaporean Archaeology  Interest in Singaporean Archaeology had not risen until 1984, but there was a long history of findings by Raffles himself upon first contact with the land. He discovered abundant remains of ancient settlement, with ruins of buildings made from brick, Chinese antiques and remains dating back to the ninth century. What these findings confirmed was the following of ancient Malay tradition and culture. Due to lack of interest, this was not pursued or investigated further, even after the discovery of stone tools in the 1890s and ancient jewelry in 1920s. 1984 was the year when the National Museum of Singapore was interested and received a grant from a Dutch petroleum company to begin a ten-day excavation. The site of interest was Fort Canning, Singapore, where an artillery fort had been built in 1858. The hill also was the site of an ancient palace which existed when Britain landed there in 1819. The most common items found within this excavation were ancient Chinese porcelain pottery and stoneware from the Yuan Dynasty. Evidence of ancient Singapore economy and trading had been found when bronze Chinese coins were discovered, the main form of trade during pre-colonial times. These bronze coins served as a wider piece of evidence for the growth of metals in Southeast Asia, proving the heavy use of iron, copper, and gold, especially in Fort Canning. Items used in daily life were found as well, among the most popular were Chinese cast iron pans, commonly known as woks. Copper used in Singapore was found to be exported from another Southeast Asian country, most likely Sumatra. Pottery was found to be one of the biggest forms of art in ancient Singapore. It was admired so much that pieces of pottery were included in burials of the people living in Singapore.Miksic, J. N. (2013). Singapore and the Silk Road of the Sea, 1300_1800. Nus Press. = French and British colonization of Vietnam = Alongside a new world for Vietnam, it was a change that many had to adjust to; as this was their new home. Recent findings allowed archeologist to conclude that the main exports were “tobacco, indigo, tea and coffee”.“Vietnam History .” Vietnam History, Cultural Portfolio , 2007, academic.depauw.edu/mkfinney_web/teaching/Com227/culturalPortfolios/VIETNAM/VIETNAM/history.html. These are just some of the new changes that the people were beginning to see during this time. The French had influenced those living in Vietnam, which essentially became referred to as the “French Indochina”. This was a combination of 3 Vietnamese regions (North, Centre and South).  Architecture and Archaeological Evidence  As archaeologists continued to study and find evidence of the colonization of the Vietnamese, it was very clear within their architecture. In the city of Hanoi, “enclaves of colonial architecture are still very visible. The French settlers wanted to turn this city into the capital of their Asian Empire, and made many grand constructions in pursuit of this”.S.L. Just. “The French influence on modern day Vietnam” Just Landed, 21 Aug. 2014, www.justlanded.com/english/Vietnam/Vietnam- Guide/Culture/History. The main goals for a lot of these architectures were to essentially forget that one was living in Vietnam as though it was not a very settling and calming place. Instead, they were motivated to execute the idea of originality and culture of the country they were in, and intertwine what they believed to be the superior culture. Another example, which was found, was that of the Hanoi Opera House. Within this structure, it had a heavy focus on “European balconies and pillars” alongside French style cafes and cinemas. Aside from these influences that the French had on Vietnam there were influences on religion that took place after the 16th century. The British in the 16th century wanted to open Vietnam up for trade. However the ruler at the time was against foreign ideas. The authors Jennifer Llewellyn, Jim Southey, and Steven Thompson (2014) found that the Vietnamese rulers wanted to abolish Catholicism and bring back Confucian ideology. Eventually the trade deals were accepted from the French, and around the 1750s Pope Clement XII wanted Vietnam to be split up into two spheres. The first being the Portuguese missionaries and the second being French missionaries.Llewellyn, Jennifer, et al. “Alpha History .” Alpha History, 2014 alphahistory.com/what-is-history/. = British colonization of Brunei = Brunei, a state located on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia, first established itself as significant and powerful territory but declined from contact with the British government in Borneo's expansion of trade in the Southeast Asian area. From severed relationships from alleged piratical acts with the Spanish, Borneo suffered leading to Early European intrusions in trading ports.Church, P. (2017). A short history of South-East Asia. John Wiley & Sons. By the end of the 17th century, Borneo's own decline lead to Brunei's own deterioration over control of neighboring territories. When Brunei was made a conquest for an expedition by the Portuguese, the island was found to be linked into Southeast Asia and China's trading network. Brunei developed a strong commercial and political relationship with the other Southeast Asian states.Hughes-Hallett, H. (1940). A Sketch of the History of Brunei. Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. 18, No. 2 (137), 23-42. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/41559952 This relationship soon severed and Brunei's political and commercial power began to decline from the result of British ports in Southeast Asia. These ports allowed for goods to be imported and exported from local traders at a cheaper price compared to Malay ports. Evidence of the relationship with India, China, and the Spanish was found in archaeological history in the 18th century on the island of Labuan as settlement for the East India company. In 1775, the company was driven away by piracy and the E.I.C gained exclusive rights to trade in pepper in return for protection. However, trade policies were threatened with the Portuguese in spice islands, Spanish in the Philippines, and the Dutch in the South. Direct trade suffered and pepper territories became expired. By the 18th century, Brunei sultans had minimal control over trade districts, leading to more piracy and oppression towards pepper traders and planters.  Treaty of Labuan and North Borneo Charted Company  In mid-19th century, British addressed Brunei on the suppression of piracy and decreased the extension and promotion of trade. In year 1847, a treaty was reached between Great Britain and Brunei to allow for mutual suppression of piracy and commercial relations.Saunders, G. E. (2015). A History of Brunei. London : Routledge, 2015. During the 1980s, the Sultan had made multiple treaties with the British consul which eventually led to the British forming the British North Borneo Company. Brunei began to dwindle from these treaties, but sociocultural changes appeared in the 20th century when a coal mining lease in 1882 was granted in Muara, Brunei and oil was discovered in 1926.  Archaeological Evidence in Coal and Oil Mining  Archaeological evidence of a variety of copper, antimony ores, gold and plumbago were found in these locations. Brunei improved as a state when revenues acquired from years of coal and oil mining. Discovery of oil lead to economic freedom, demographic changes, infrastructure, and educational opportunities. Centuries of trade oppression with the British weakened Brunei as a state, eventually leading to limited findings of data and material culture of the Brunei community and archaeological work today.

Benjamin Bromberg founded Benny's Auto Store on November 9, 1924, in Providence. In 1929, a second store was opened in East Providence, Rhode Island, and in 1931, Benny's opened its first Massachusetts store in Taunton. The Providence Journal building exists on the site of the first Benny's store. In 1965, the Esmond Mill became the corporate headquarters for Benny's. After Benjamin Bromberg's death in 1966, he was succeeded as company president by his son Malcolm Bromberg. In 1968, a fire burned down the store located in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. Throughout the 1960s to 1970's, Benny's began to expand further into Massachusetts and Connecticut, with stores opening as far as Cape Cod. The last store to open was in 2005 in Killingly, Connecticut. Malcolm Bromberg was succeeded by his children—Arnold and Howard Bromberg, and Judy Rosenstein—as the company owners following his death in 2014. Closure On September 8, 2017, Benny's announced that it would be closing all 31 stores. This stirred minor controversy among its employees, as a portion of them found out by indirect means such as social media and claimed that they received no formal notice from corporate.

The final Benny's store, located in Greenville, Rhode Island, closed on December 11, 2017. Twenty-nine of the 31 Benny's store locations were purchased by the Carpionato Group, a development company based in Johnston, Rhode Island. Following the final store's closure, the company faced minor controversy regarding a lack of severance pay for its former employees. Since the company's closure, several former store locations have fallen into disrepair. The roof collapsed on the former Benny's in East Wareham, Massachusetts, in January 2018. In May 2018, a fire broke out at one of the former Benny's in Seekonk, Massachusetts. Some of the former stores were sold by the Carpionato Group to other retail chains, including Dollar General and Ocean State Job Lot. An auction was held at the Benny's corporate offices in June 2018. Store-use machinery, shelving units, delivery trucks, and returned defective merchandise were among the items auctioned. Legacy The announcement of the company's closure shocked many customers, as Benny's was considered a southern New England icon. As a near century-old local retail store, customers shared their nostalgia for the store online. Local businesses expressed their condolences for Benny's closure.

In 1870, the town was annexed by the City of Boston and Dorchester High came under the jurisdiction of Boston Public Schools. A new school designed by the architectural firm of Hartwell, Richardson & Driver was built on Talbot Avenue in Codman Square and opened in 1895.Anthony Mitchell Sammarco (2000).

Dorchester High for Boys was created and moved to the new facility, while Dorchester High for Girls was established and remained in the Codman Square building. In a Boston School Committee vote July 27, 1953, the Dorchester High School for Girls was ordered closed. The stated reasons for closure were the School Committee's desire for a co-educational school, integrating trade courses for girls, and student enrollment being under capacity.

Her work advanced children's health care, education, and the juvenile justice system in Iowa. She was admitted into the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame in 1976. Early life Hillis was born on August 8, 1858, in Bloomfield, Iowa. Her parents were Cyrus Bussey, a merchant and Union General in the American Civil War, and Ellen (Kiser) Bussey. The Busseys moved to New Orleans after the war, and Hillis attended Sylvester Larned Institute. Public life and career In 1887 Hillis helped found the Des Moines Women's Club, and she raised money for the organization by giving lectures on the fine arts in her home. Hillis first ventured into advocacy work in 1894 when she campaigned to create a safe public swimming facility for children in the Des Moines River, including a bath house and rental swimwear for those who could not afford their own. After the death of her son Philip in 1893, Hillis became involved in the \\"mother's congress\\" movement (later became the Parent-Teacher Association) that promoted an educated approach to parenthood and child- rearing. She attended the 1899 National Mothers' Congress in Washington, D.C., serving as a delegate from the Iowa Child Study Society. Hillis became highly involved in the organization. She organized the next Congress, which took place in Des Moines in May 1900, and she was elected the first president of the Iowa Congress of Mothers. The organization advocated for recognizing the responsibility and commitment of parenthood, and for discarding inaccurate gender stereotypes. Hillis used the network of the Iowa Congress of Mothers to advocate for other political and social changes that would benefit children and families. She campaigned for the creation of a juvenile court system in Iowa, which at the existed in very few states, and she helped write the legislation that was eventually passed in 1904. She worked to establish a system for tracking infant births and deaths as a way to reduce child mortality. She worked with the newly established Baby Saving Campaign in Des Moines, which included birth registrations, ice and milk distribution, visiting nurses, and the fresh air camp. The camp took place in the Summer of 1913. Hillis raised the funds for it and supervised the camp for a month. The aim of the camp was to provide a respite for young and poor mothers during the hot summer months, as well as to provide education about nutrition, health, and hygiene. For many years Hillis attempted to convince the State University of Iowa to establish a research unit devoted to child development, which was an area poorly understood at the time. Hillis was inspired in this work by her experiences caring for her invalid sister, Laura, who developed a rare spinal disease when she was two years old. Doctors provided contradictory and insufficient guidance in Laura's case, in part because there was very little research into child development. In 1914, after taking the idea to the four previous presidents of the University, Thomas Macbride agreed to support and move forward with the idea. Together with Carl Seashore, Dean of the Graduate College, Hillis campaigned the state legislature to allocate funds to establish such a center. Finally, in April 1917, the Child's Welfare Bill was signed into law in Iowa. It established the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station (now the Institute of Child Behavior and Development), which researches children's physical growth, intellectual development, speech development, and aspects of teacher training. Personal life Cora Bussey met Isaac Hillis, a lawyer, on a family vacation to Keokuk, Iowa, and they married in 1880. They had five children, Ellen, Cyrus, Philip, Isaac, and Doris. The Hillis's also cared for Cora's invalid sister, Laura (Lollie), after the death of her mother in 1881. Her family life was beset by tragedies, and her three youngest children died before reaching adulthood. Hillis died in a car accident on August 12, 1924, near St. Cloud Minnesota and was buried at Woodland Cemetery (Des Moines, Iowa).

The bloody overthrow which saw numerous soldiers killed in street fighting was sparked by a power struggle in the highest echelons of the government. Rodríguez's takeover spelled the end of El Stronato, Stroessner's thirty-four year long rule, at the time the longest in Latin America, and led to an array of reforms which abolished numerous draconian laws and led to the liberalization of Paraguay. Background Alfredo Stroessner, a general and veteran of the Paraguayan Civil War and the Chaco War, came to power in the aftermath of the 1954 coup d'état. As president he declared a \\"state of siege\\" and instituted a number of laws and security reforms which gave him the power to suspend civil liberties, including habeas corpus and freedom of assembly. Between 1958 and 1988, Stroessner was reelected seven times by questionably high margins of victory (only in the 1968 election did an opposition candidate receive more than 20% of the vote). The United States was one of President Stroessner's most ardent supporters, due to his fervent anti-communism and Paraguay was the recipient of large amounts of U.S. military assistance during the 1960s and 1970s. The \\"state of siege\\" imposed by Stroessner soon after assuming the presidency was officially lifted in 1987; however, this move was largely symbolic as most of the country's stringent security provisions remained in place. In the late 1980s, political conflict broke out between two competing factions in the ruling Colorado Party. One faction, the \\"militants\\", vigorously supported Stroessner while the \\"traditionalists\\" sought a more open Paraguay and were less supportive of some of Stroessner's policies. Among the traditionalists was General Andrés Rodríguez, a close confidante of Stroessner and commander of Paraguay's 1st Army Corps. A strong contender for succeeding the aging president, the militant wing of the party attempted to neuter his political power by giving him the option of taking the position of defense minister, a largely ceremonial position, or retiring. Fearing a rebellion, Stroessner had already removed high-ranking, experienced military commanders from their postings and replaced them with cronies. Coup On the night of 2 February 1989, Rodríguez ordered units of his 1st Army Corps, including some 40 to 50 tanks, into the streets of Asunción. The unit, the strongest and most well-equipped of Paraguay's armed forces seized the capital city's center. Troops from the unit attempted to arrest Stroessner as he dined at his mistress' home, however bodyguards resisted fiercely and allowed the president to escape to the headquarters of the Presidential Escort Regiment. A battle broke out between Rodríguez's troops and the 700-strong presidential guard. Meanwhile, the rest of Paraguay's military districts pledged their allegiance to the rebels. Artillery units and naval vessels in the city's harbor shelled the headquarters during the course of the battle and by 5:00pm on 3 February, the government under Stroessner surrendered. Rodríguez announced the surrender over the radio and said Stroessner was in custody and unharmed. The official death toll of the coup stood at 31 killed however other estimates put the actual toll between 150 and 250, the majority of them Stroessner's guards. The Catholic Church station Radio Caritas said up to 200 people were killed in the fighting. Stroessner was initially detained at the base of the 1st Army Corps but he was flown to exile aboard a LAP Boeing 707 to Brasilia, Brazil on 6 February after being granted asylum. He left with his son, Gustavo, and daughter-in-law and lived in a lakeside home, previously his summer home, until his death in 2006. Aftermath President Andrés Rodríguez began his rule by reversing Stroessner's repressive measures, removing his loyalists from the military, and abolishing the death penalty. He also abolished the legislature, removed the sweeping ban on political parties, and organized elections to take place in May 1989. Rodríguez was elected to the presidency in the 1989 elections and served in that capacity until 1993, the first Paraguayan leader in decades to leave at the end of his first term. He died of cancer in 1997.

This creates a conflict between Peralta and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, the precinct must undergo a \\"tactical village\\" for training in operations. There, Santiago runs into her former boyfriend Teddy Wells (Kyle Bornheimer), which may indicate she still has feelings for her. Meanwhile, Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) gets furious when she is not invited to Charles Boyle's (Joe Lo Truglio) wedding while Holt and Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) get addicted to a mobile app. The episode was seen by an estimated 2.61 million household viewers and gained a 1.3/3 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research.

However, when he learns Michael Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker) is also at the same level as him, he ends up dropping it. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Tactical Village\\" was seen by an estimated 2.61 million household viewers and gained a 1.3/3 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.66 million viewers with a 1.3/3 in the 18-49 demographics.

This was a more mature episode, both structurally and in the way it pushed the relationships of each of its characters forward. 'Tactical Village' was ostensibly about team bonding, but its main plot didn't deal with the team as a whole. Instead, it looked at two central pairs, defining their paths for the rest of the season.

He is from West Virginia and is known for bringing attention to oversights of the government in relation to the Martin County coal slurry spill and whistleblowing on the subsequent downplaying of the role of the government and Massey Energy in the disaster. Early life Jack Spadaro was born in West Virginia and graduated from Mt. Hope High School in 1967. Under the guidance of an influential English teacher who was married to the head of the Bureau of Mines at that time, he received a scholarship to West Virginia University where he studied mining engineering. Career Two years after graduation from college, Spadaro was teaching and doing research when, on February 26, 1972, the Buffalo Creek flood disaster occurred. Spadaro was one of the investigators called upon by Governor Arch Moore to investigate the matter. When Jack arrived he noticed workers pulling dead bodies from the mud. This inspired him to protect miners and regulate activity in those communities. He began to uncover information that proved dams built across West Virginia had not used standard engineering methods. Vice president of Buffalo Mining Steve Dasovich said that during the construction of one dam on Buffalo Creek no engineering calculations were made. Nearly a decade later Spadaro joined the Department of Natural Resources and began building an inventory of dams and enforcing laws regulating coal waste and dam construction. Spadaro spent his career overseeing environmental disasters and damage caused by coal mining. For 38 years he worked alongside companies, citizens, and many other organizations to combat hazards that correlate with coal mining incidents and processes. He worked as a Mine Safety and Health Administration consultant, providing assistance as an expert witness in cases that involved damage to the environment and mining incidents that affected workers. Spadaro has been a key trial witness due to his personal experience with large mining incidents.  Martin County sludge spill  The Martin County sludge spill was an incident that Spadaro worked closely on. This coal slurry impoundment resulted from the Massey Energy Company's mining expeditions. He was asked to investigate the incident, working alongside colleagues to find the root of the impoundment failure. This investigation led to the discovery of a previous spill at the same spot. Accusations came amid claims that this problem had been fixed in the past. Through Spadaro's efforts and investigation, it was discovered that engineers were aware of the previous spill in 1994, and that the issue had been ongoing until it broke in October. Spadaro came forward with viable evidence and sources stemming from his research. This information intended to show the origin of the spill. During this time, the Bush administration had a strong push for more energy, which led to the deregulation of energy companies. On June 4, 2003 government agents entered Spadaro’s office and went through his files. He was locked out and placed on administrative leave. Spadaro stated that the Bush administration was covering up the Martin County spill. Spadaro complained that the new administration had given lucrative contracts for work at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy to friends. The MSHA denied the accusations, while Jack claimed the program was divided into 186 smaller contracts.

Life Originally, the Zhu family hailed from the city of Hangzhou, but after Zhu's grandfather chose to retire in Beijing, the family had lived in the city for the past three generations at the time of Zhu Yun's birth. Studying intensely in his youth, Zhu was ranked first place in the civil examinations of 1745 and later on was introduced into the Hanlin Academy. By his middle age, Zhu Yun was already an important, distinguished, and wealthy official in Beijing. His presence and stature in the city established Beijing as a rising cultural hub in competition to only the already known city of Jiangnan. Serving in the mid- Qianlong era, Zhu Yun resided in the county of Daxing, which was nestled on the surrounding area of the Qing capital. As a scholar, Zhu Yun enjoyed the works of other Chinese literati and had a vast collection of books, which included a manuscript of the writings of Wang Ji, a Tang Dynasty era poet. During his tenure as an official in Beijing, he welcomed a young Zhang Xuecheng into his home. It was during this visit that Zhang introduced himself to Zhu's extensive collection of literary works. As a result of this interaction, Zhu Yun subsequently became a teacher and mentor to Zhang Xuecheng. Their relationship was very close as after the death of Zhang's mother, it was Zhu who wrote a funeral ode to commemorate her life. Zhang Xuecheng would go on to write the Wenshi Tongyi and become a premier historian of Qing China. Aside from his relationship with Zhang Xuecheng, Zhu Yun had interactions with many other scholars of his time. As an academic, he fostered close relationships with his disciples whom reportedly were numbered close to a thousand. Among Zhu Yun's academic acquaintances were Ruan Yuan (1764-1849) and Wang Zhong (1745-1794), who were both part of the social circle at the School of Yangzhou.  Political Influence Zhu was a favorite of Qianlong and had accompanied the Emperor on his tour to the city of Mu-lan during the summer of 1758. With such influence, Zhu established a government bureau devoted to the collection of books, which set the scholarly mood in the imperial court at the time. In 1772, Zhu Yun, who was then the Education Commissioner of Anhui, suggested to the Qianlong Emperor to collect all the scattered and known works from the predecessor Ming Dynasty into one compilation. This project was dubbed the Imperial Library in Four Treasures (Siku Quanshu). While he was working on the imperial library, Zhu Yun and several colleagues used their political influence to undertake several side projects simultaneously. This in itself further extended Zhu's own ambition and work in the Han learning movement. During this time, Zhu introduced the scholar Shao Chin-Han to his contemporaries at the time, which subsequently influenced Shao in his future work on the Siku Commission. Shao's contributions showed areas of tension between the writing for the Qing Court and that of the Han learning movement. During his tenure as the Education Commissioner, Zhu Yun met with several other scholars such as Hung Laing-chi, Tai Chen, and Chang Hseuh-ch'eng to personally discuss his own memorial onto the Siku Quanshi project. In this sense, Zhu's acts ultimately secured his own legacy in the political scholarship projects of the High Qing period.  Legacy Shortly after Zhu Yun's plea, the Qianlong Emperor approved the commencement of the Imperial Library in Four Treasures (Siku Quanshu). Subsequently, the editorial privilege for the project was vested among the academic circle surrounding Zhu Yun. Zhu's position as a top scholar at the time ultimately resulted in his own additions of Han ideals into the Qing project. The Qing, trying to strengthen their mandate, supported the traditional Confucian texts that were accepted by the people. However, Zhu Yun's influence resulted in scholars around his academic circle to argue against any Neo-Confucian texts whenever the opportunity presented itself. As a result, the Imperial Library project was mirrored and impaired with division. This lack of unity amongst the educated elite would later become a factor in the dissolving bureaucratic morale during the final decades of the Qing Dynasty. Living in the same time as the corrupt official Heshen, Zhu inevitably found himself at odds in court. After his death in 1781, Zhu Yun's struggle to protect his Hanlin ideals against Heshen's influence was continued by his brother Zhu Gui. Heshen used his power to block Zhu Gui from entering the Imperial Court in the 1780s, but the younger Zhu instead served as Governor of Anhui from 1790-1794 and of Guangdong from 1794-1797. After Heshen's downfall in 1799, Zhu Gui was recalled back to Beijing to serve as the head of The Boards of Personnel and Revenue. Zhu Gui's subsequent appointment marked the return of degree holding literati to important posts in the central government.

Dellville is a village in Wheatfield Township, Perry County, Pennsylvania, United States. The settlement is located within the Harrisburg–Carlisle metropolitan statistical area.  Population  Determining the ethnic population of Dellville is a challenge, as the area is not a census designated place. Additionally, there is widespread inaccuracy among the locals as to what specific ethnicity falling in the general class of caucasian they are. Most identify as either German, Irish, or Scots-Irish, while some simply identify as American. Despite these factors, sourcing historical documents and county data makes it clear (albeit with imperfect accuracy) that Dellville is predominantly German ethnically, though sizable Irish population exists as well.https://millpictures.com/mills.php?millid=1086 Kirkpatrick is an Irish surname. The original church in the area was a German Reformed Church plant.https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wa4yAQAAMAAJ&rdid;=book- Wa4yAQAAMAAJ&rdot;=1 Page 1081. Perry County as a whole self-identifies as 45.2% German (43.3% \\"German\\" and 1.9% \\"Pennsylvania German\\", with the latter being Anabaptist people in other parts of the county), however, as Dellville has no major commerce area, there is a statistical likelihood of a higher German percentage of population.  Structures  It is most famous as the site of the (arsoned) Dellville Covered Bridge, burnt in November 2014. The bridge was built either in 1810 or 1889, steel beams were added in the 1950s, and it was repaired in 1973 after Hurricane Agnes. In 2007, the Dellville Covered Bridge was barred from traffic, with a new bridge (made of concrete) receiving the redirected traffic. In March 2018, reconstruction began on the bridge. The covered bridge is nearly finished as of January 2019. There is one church in Dellville, presently a Methodist church, but there is some evidence to suggest that it was formerly a Lutheran church. The church was expanded from its original size, though the time of this is not known. A store, now not used as such, was built in 1855 and first kept by Adam Billow. A post office was established in 1860, and the first postmaster was Eli Young, who served 14 years. There is no longer a post office in Dellville. The mill was one of the main parts of the village, and had various owners from the time it was built in 1841.  Geography  Dellville is one of many villages and towns in Perry County to have the Shermans Creek, which flows into the Susquehanna River in Duncannon, run through it.http://duncannonatc.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/07/PA_waterbasins1.jpg The Appalachian Trail runs through nearby, but is not easily accessible for another 7 miles.

The incline is quite observable on Pine Hill Road.https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/advanced- viewer/viewer/index.html?marker=-77.1158136,40.3639746&level;=13 Elevations on various points going upward in the northern section of Pine Hill Road in Wheatfield Township # Lat Lon Elev (ft) Elev (m) 1 40.36358 -77.11641 382.92 116.71 2 40.36260 -77.11757 414.26 126.27 3 40.35979 -77.11869 470.12 143.29 4 40.35766 -77.11933 503.83 153.57 5 40.35580 -77.11985 536.32 163.47 The land surrounding Dellville is primarily agricultural as is evident by satellite imagery, as well as historical documents pertaining to the founding of the village. However, there is also significant areas of woodlands with springs which are tributaries to Shermans Creek, especially further from the village, in the area. The woodlands surrounding Dellville predominantly contain red maple, pitch pine, eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, birch, shagbark hickory, and beech trees, though American sycamore, ironwood, black walnut, juniper, oak, elm, alder, and sassafras are also fairly common.

They perform on period instruments, and specialize in one-voice-per-part singing. Called “a major force in the New York early music world\\" (The New York Times), TENET maintains a flexible roster of professional musicians from across the US and the world. Their singers have garnered praise for performing with \\"an uncanny degree of precision” (The Boston Globe). Tenet frequently collaborates with other early music ensembles across the country, including Blue Heron, Dark Horse Consort, The Sebastians, New York Polyphony, Five Boroughs Music Festival, and others.  History  Soprano and artistic director Jolle Greenleaf took over the Tiffany Consort in 2009, and changed the name to Tenet. Since then, Tenet has presented a series of concerts in New York City and the surrounding area, as well as touring around the country and internationally. Past projects include J.S. Bach’s St. Matthew Passion, St. John Passion, Bach's motets, Handel’s Messiah, a three-year cycle of Carlo Gesualdo’s Tenebrae Responsories, regular performances of works by Purcell and his contemporaries celebrating St. Cecilia (music’s patron saint), two medieval survey series curated by Robert Mealey, and original theatrical performances highlighting works composed by, for, and about women in 17th century Italy. Tenet has been credited for helping to raise the profile of New York's early music scene. They were described by the New York Times as \\"stellar\\" and \\"an excellent vocal ensemble.\\" Tenet has performed at Carnegie's Zankel Hall, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Rockefeller University, Columbia University, Yale University, and many other venues across New York City. Tenet has been invited to perform at numerous festivals across the country, in Latin America, and in Europe, including Caramoor Summer Music Festival, Skaneateles Festival, Berkshire Bach Festival, Festival Casals de Puerto Rico, Costa Rica International Music Festival, and Montreal Baroque Festival. In 2018, on the occasion of its tenth anniversary season, the group changed its name to \\"TENET Vocal Artists.\\" = Green Mountain Project = In 2010, Jolle Greenleaf joined forces with Boston violinist Scott Metcalfe to present Monteverdi's 1610 Vespro della Beata Vergine for its 400th anniversary, performing as the Green Mountain Project (a translation of Monteverdi's name). The success of this concert inspired Greenleaf and Metcalfe to make it an annual event. In 2012 Metcalfe assembled a Vespers service from music by Monteverdi and some of his contemporaries. The Green Mountain Project (as a sub-project of Tenet) presented this in concert as the \\"Vespers of 1640.\\" Unlike Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers, this was not a pre-existing collection of music, but followed the format of a Vespers service from the time. The same concept was the basis for a different Monteverdi service \\"Vespers for the Feast of St. John the Baptist\\", presented by Tenet in 2014, and a Vespers service by Marc-Antoine Charpentier presented in 2015. In 2020, TENET will perform the tenth and final iteration of the Green Mountain Project in New York City at the Church of St. Jean Baptiste and at Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice.

It has a single thin leaf and up to twenty five purplish brown flowers with a shiny, hairless, dark purplish labellum. It is sometimes confused with Genoplesium nigricans which has differently coloured flowers and a much wider distribution. It is regarded as a synonym of G. nigricans by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families. Description Corunastylis nigricans is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long with the free part long, ending below the flowering stem. Between five and twenty five flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are brownish purple, turn slightly downwards and are about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long, wide with hairless edges. The lateral sepals are about long, wide, free from each other and spread widely apart. The petals are linear in shape, about long and wide with hairless edges. The labellum is oblong to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, thick and fleshy, about long and wide with a blunt tip. Flowering occurs between February and May. Taxonomy and naming The Kangaroo Island leek orchid was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown who gave it the name Prasophyllum nigricans and published the description in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis nigricans. The specific epithet nigricans is a Latin word meaning \\"blackish\\".

Background  Frank Coppola was born in Partinico, Sicily, Italy in 1899. In 1926 he emigrated clandestinely to the United States and settled in Detroit. He worked as a laborer and then as a seller of fruit and vegetables, before entering the mob. He was known as Frank Three Fingers because he lacked two, the left ring finger and little finger after his fingers had slipped inside the door of a safe during a robbery and had to be cut off with a knife before the police arrived. He later claimed, in an interview by the Italian Antimafia Commission in 1971:http://legislature.camera.it/_dati/leg07/lavori/stampati/pdf/023_003003.pdf page 1056 = Drug trafficking = He was a major drug trafficker with strong ties to the Detroit Partnership with Angelo Meli and the St. Louis crime family particularly Anthony \\"Tony\\" Giordano.

Expelled to Italy  In 1948 he was expelled from the United States and sent back to Italy. He settled in Ardea, near Rome, where he invested all the money accumulated, in real estate.

As a real estate developer, Trump began acquiring and constructing golf courses in 1999. By the time of his election as United States President in 2016, he owned 17 golf courses worldwide through his holding company, the Trump Organization. Courses owned by Trump have been selected to host various PGA and LPGA events, including the upcoming 2022 PGA Championship. Following his election, Trump broke precedent with recent presidents and chose not to divest from his business holdings, including his golf courses. Although not illegal, this led to criticism from ethics lawyers and journalists for potential conflicts of interest. At least three lawsuits (D.C. and Maryland v. Trump, Blumenthal v. Trump and CREW v. Trump) have been filed claiming that foreign payments at Trump golf courses and hotels violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. Background Trump, according to Jack Nicklaus, \\"loves the game of golf more than he loves money\\". According to Golf Digest, his handicap is as low as 2.8. Trump began playing golf during his college years at the University of Pennsylvania. In the introduction to his 2005 book The Best Golf Advice I Ever Received, Trump wrote, \\"for me and millions of people—men, women, young and old around the world—golf is more than a game. It is a passion.\\" In 1999, Trump opened his first golf course: the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in Florida. Land for the US$45 million course was acquired through a lawsuit against Palm Beach County, Florida, after Trump's purchase of the Mar-a-Lago resort. By 2007, Trump owned 4 courses around the US. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Trump began purchasing existing golf courses and re-designing them. Golf courses owned by Trump hosted the LPGA Tour finale from 2001 to 2008, as well as the 2009 US Junior Amateur and US Junior Girls Championships.In 2014, the Professional Golfers' Association of America announced a multi-year partnership with the Trump Organization. The PGA of America selected Trump golf courses to host the 2017 Senior PGA Championship and the 2022 PGA Championship. Donald Trump and Mark Wahlberg in 2006 In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy in the 2016 presidential election with a controversial speech which led to companies such as Macy's and NBC cutting ties with the businessman. While speaking on illegal immigration, Trump claimed that Mexico is \\"sending people that have lots of problems... they're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,\\" drawing criticism from immigration and Latino advocacy groups. The LPGA, PGA of America, PGA Tour, and United States Golf Association issued a joint statement, saying that while the organizations \\"do not usually comment on presidential politics, Mr. Trump's comments are inconsistent with our strong commitment to an inclusive and welcoming environment in the game of golf.\\" The PGA of America also decided to relocate the 2015 PGA Grand Slam of Golf—an exhibition match which had been scheduled to take place at Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles. Other upcoming events at Trump courses were not affected. In 2018, PGA Tour Latinoamérica held its Shell Tour Championship at Trump National Doral Miami's Golden Palm course after plans were announced to demolish the Melreese Country Club in Miami, which had held the event, for a football stadium. Golf courses owned Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles in Rancho Palos Verdes, California As of December 2016, Trump owned 17 golf courses in the United States and abroad. Over nearly two decades (as he reported in his 2000–2018 tax filings), these golf courses had combined losses of $315.6 million. = United States = *Trump National Golf Club, Bedminster, New Jersey – purchased in 2002. * Trump National Golf Club, Charlotte, North Carolina – designed by Greg Norman, located on Lake Norman, purchased in 2012. * Trump National Golf Club, Colts Neck, New Jersey – purchased in 2008. * Trump National Golf Club, Hudson Valley, New York – purchased in 2010. *Trump National Golf Club, Jupiter, Florida – purchased in December 2012. *Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles *Trump National Doral Golf Club, Florida *Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach, Florida *Trump National Golf Club, Philadelphia *Trump National Golf Club, Washington, D.C. *Trump National Golf Club, Westchester, New York = Outside of the U.S. = *Trump International Golf Links, Scotland *Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland * Trump International Golf Club, Dubai * Trump World Golf Club Dubai, Dubai *Trump Turnberry, Scotland  Other golf courses  The Trump Organization also operates a public golf course built and owned by New York City under a 20-year contract awarded in 2013 by the administration of then Mayor Bloomberg. The course, which opened in 2015, is called Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, New York. Under the agreement, the city paid the course's utility and water bills while collecting no income for the first four years. In the first year of operation, ending in March 2016, the company had $8 million in gross receipts, and the city paid $1 million in water and sewage bills. In the second year of operation, gross receipts dropped 9.5%. For the operating year that ended March 2019, the Trump Organization reported a loss of $122,000; it now faces contractual fees of at least $300,000 per operating year from the city. Trump previously licensed his name to the Trump International Golf Club in Puerto Rico, which served as host of the PGA Tour's Puerto Rico Open. The course filed for bankruptcy protection in 2015. According to Trump Organization executive vice president Eric Trump, the organization \\"merely licensed our name for a fee and [had] nothing to do with the ownership, development or entity.\\" Coats of arms Trump has used a number of logos in the style of coats of arms for his businesses. The coat of arms granted to Davies in 1939 bears the motto \\"Integritas\\". Joseph E. Davies, third husband of Marjorie Merriweather Post and a former US ambassador of Welsh origins, was granted a coat of arms by British heraldic authorities in 1939. After Trump purchased Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate built by Merriweather Post, in 1985, the Trump Organization started using Davies's coat of arms at Trump golf courses and estates across the country. It was also registered with the US patent and trademark office. In 2008, Trump attempted to establish the American logo at his new Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, Scotland, but was warned by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the highest authority for Scottish heraldry, that an act of the Scottish Parliament from 1672 disallows people using unregistered arms. In January 2012, shortly after the inauguration of the golf course, Trump unveiled the new coat of arms that had been granted to \\"The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd\\" by the Lord Lyon in 2011: The coat of arms granted to \\"The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd\\" in 2011 bears the battle cry: \\"Nunquam Concedere\\". From 2014, Trump used the same logo for the Trump International Golf Links, Ireland, the golf resort built from his acquisition of Doonbeg Golf Club. Presidency Following his election in 2016, Trump announced that he would not divest his business holdings, as other recent presidents had. Instead, Trump kept his ownership stake in the Trump Organization and appointed his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump to manage the business. In an unusual rebuke from the Office of Government Ethics, director Walter Shaub called Trump's actions \\"wholly inadequate\\" and \\"meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.\\" In an interview with The New York Times, Trump explained: \\"As far as the, you know, potential conflict of interests, though, I mean I know that from the standpoint, the law is totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest.\\" Trump and Shinzō Abe Just days after his inauguration, a lawsuit was filed in federal court seeking to block the president from receiving payments from foreign government entities at his businesses. The lawsuit alleged that these payments constitute a violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. In February 2017, the president invited Prime Minister of Japan Shinzō Abe to play at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida and stay at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Legal and ethical concerns were raised by organizations such as the Sunlight Foundation over foreign payments the president may receive from the visit. Trump has vowed to donate any such payments to the Treasury Department, although the specifics of this arrangement remain unclear. In June 2017, the attorney generals of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a separate lawsuit, claiming the president was \\"flagrantly violating\\" the Emoluments Clause. A 2016 investigation by USA Today found that lobbyists and corporate executives had been purchasing memberships at Trump golf courses to gain favor or contact with the president. Membership fees at Trump courses can exceed US$100,000, leading to ethical concerns over a sitting president accepting money from people lobbying the government. While campaigning to be president, Trump declared in August 2016: \\"I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to play golf\\". After becoming president, the amount of time he spent golfing generated controversy. Despite frequently criticizing his predecessor Barack Obama as having played golf too much as president, Trump golfed 11 times during his first eight weeks in office, when Obama did not golf at all in his first eight weeks, although Golf Digest concluded that Obama played 306 rounds of golf over his two terms, which the magazine describes as \\"...a fairly remarkable amount of golf while in office.\\". According to CNN, Trump visited Trump-owned golf courses 92 times between becoming president in January 2017 and January 3, 2018, although the White House does not disclose when the president actually plays golf during a visit to a golf course. And the White House has on some occasions denied that Trump played golf during his visits even after photos published on social media showed him playing golf. In November 2018, The Washington Post found that the average number of days between golf rounds was around 5 days for Trump, and around 12–13 days for Obama. Journalists and ethics experts have alleged that these frequent visits are a means of boosting publicity at the courses to sell more memberships. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the president's golfing, saying that his time on the course was spent \\"developing deeper and better relationships with members of Congress in which those relationships have helped push forward the president's agenda.\\" But CNN reported in January 2018 that Trump was known to have played golf with members of Congress only seven times at a Trump-owned golf course. Vice president Mike Pence stayed at the Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland in 2019 while meeting with Irish officials in Dublin. Pence was originally going to end his trip in Doonbeg, where he has familial ties, but Trump suggested that he stay at the Trump property instead, which required daily flights of a more than one hour each way.

The mosque was founded in 859-860, making it one of the oldest mosques in Morocco. It is located at the heart of a district which was historically associated with Andalusi immigrants, from which it takes its name. It has been renovated and expanded several times since then. Today, it is one of the relatively few remaining Idrisid-era establishments and one of the main landmarks of the city. Description The minaret and eastern entrance of the mosque According to historical sources like al-Jazna'i, the mosque was founded in 859-860 by Maryam bint Mohammed bin Abdullah al-Fihri (sister of Fatima al-Fihri, who founded the Qarawiyyin Mosque at the same time). Construction was also aided by additional funds donated by a group of local residents of Andalusi background. The latter had come to the city as refugees in 818, fleeing the city of Cordoba after a failed uprising which resulted in severe repressions from the Ummayyad emir al-Hakam I. The original construction was modest; according to the 12th-century Andalusian geographer Al-Bakri, the mosque consisted of seven vaults and a small sahn where a walnut tree and several other trees were planted. The mosque had access to abundant water from an artificial water channel known as Wadi Masmuda.Jami' al-Andalusiyyin. Archnet. Retrieved January 23, 2018. In the 10th century, the Umayyads of Cordoba erected the minaret which survives up until today. The minaret is square- shaped and has simple decorations on its frame. It is built to resemble the minaret of the al-Qarawiyyin Mosque. During the rule of Obaidullah, a governor of Fez during the Fatimid-era, the mosque became the place for khutbah (religious sermon) during the Friday Prayer, replacing the position of the Mosque of Al-Ashyakh which was the first mosque built in the eastern settlement. Muhammad al-Nasir, the fourth Almohad caliph, ordered the construction of the gate during 1203-1207 which overlooks the northern facade. The gate is topped by two domes, one of which is built of carved plasters and another is built of cedar wood, and decorated by the combination of wooden zellij and qashani works. It was restored during the Alaouite period. Several historians, artists, and scholars, including the orientalist Georges Marçais praised the architecture as a masterpiece of Moroccan architectural style. The caliph built as well a water tank, a fountain on the northern facade of the building which resembles that of the al-Qarawiyyin Mosque, and an apartment made of stone for the imams of the mosque on the second floor above the prayer hall for women. During the Marinid period, several parts of the building including the ceiling, beams, and fountain were restored. The mosque also provided seven courses for education and contained two libraries, similar to the al-Qarawiyyin Mosque, making it the second most important mosque in the medina of Fez.مسجد الأندلسيين.

The group consists of lead vocalist Lucas Woodland, guitarist Scott Carey, bassist James Joseph and drummer Ashley Green. The band released an initial collection of singles in 2017, as well as a split EP with Loathe in 2018, before finally releasing their debut record, Holding Absence, in 2019. They are signed with SharpTone Records. History=2015–2018: Formation, singles and the This Is As One EP = The band initially formed in 2015 fronted by current Parting Gift vocalist Zac Vernon. However, he soon parted ways with the band leaving the door open to current vocalist Lucas Woodland. Upon Lucas joining the band in 2016, Holding Absence released their debut single and video for \\"Permanent\\". The band would soon go on to follow up the release of \\"Permanent\\" with their contrasting single \\"Dream Of Me\\", gaining the attention of US-based record label \\"Sharptone Records\\". In 2017, the band signed with SharpTone Records, with a physical release of the double-A side single Permanent/Dream of Me. The following few months were spent touring the UK alongside several bands, including Blood Youth and We Are The Ocean, before eventually performing at the prestigious Download Festival in Donington. Soon after Download, the band released their third single \\"Penance\\". A 6-minute long track about \\"the journey towards happiness\\". Before the year was out, the band toured the UK again supporting Young Guns, and soon after released their fourth single \\"Heaven Knows\\". Before the end of the year, Holding Absence announced a surprise split EP with label mates Loathe, as well as dropping their 5th single \\"Saint Cecilia\\". \\"This Is As One\\" dropped in March 2018, accompanied by a unique co-headline tour with the two bands. According to Woodland, \\"the split came about both at a stage in our careers where we could have benefited from releasing music, but also we wanted to do something a little different\\". This tour was Holding Absence's first foray into European territory and on the UK leg the bands opted to hand-pick the support acts for each date, including artists such as Sleep Token, Modern Error and Parting Gift. =2018–2019: Line-up changes and the release of Holding Absence= Soon after returning from the \\"This Is As One\\" tour, founding member and guitarist Feisal El-Khazragi left the band, it was later announced that he had joined Loathe on bass duties. A new-look Holding Absence (including future guitarists Scott Carey and Chris Smitheram) made their first live appearances at Slam Dunk Festival, before jetting off to Europe again, this time to support Being As An Ocean. The band went on to win the Cardiff Music Award for \\"Best Breakthrough Band\\", as well as being nominated at the Heavy Music awards for the \\"Best UK Breakthrough Band\\". After finishing the summer by playing sporadic UK festivals Holding Absence went on to close the year off with their biggest tour yet supporting fellow UK Post-Hardcore band As It Is, alongside Trash Boat and Courage My Love. In support of this tour, Holding Absence released \\"Like A Shadow\\", the first single off the, at the time, unannounced debut album. After the uncertainty with the band's line-up earlier in the year, Like A Shadow was seen as a reintroduction to the band and their new line-up. Later in the year, Holding Absence announced their debut, self-titled record would be released on 8 March 2019. They released 3 more singles before the album release, Perish, You Are Everything and Monochrome. Woodland mentions in several interviews how hard the song-writing process was. In regards to El-Khazragi's leaving the band he said that the \\"line-up change happened not just mid-album, but mid-recording\\" and how the band \\"were left having to write and record another half of the album\\" without him. The record was also recorded in two parts, which caused the band further complications while trying to get it finished. Woodland believes that the changes benefitted the record in the end, as tracks like \\"Wilt\\", \\"Monochrome\\" and \\"Like A Shadow\\" wouldn't have existed if the band remained in its original form. Holding Absence was finally released via Sharptone Records on 8 March and was instantly received well critically and commercially. Kerrang gave it 4K's stating that the album was a \\"brilliantly told tale of love and life, and a superb example of how to stretch the limits of what Post-Hardcore can achieve.\\", as well as giving the album a 9/10, Dead Press expressed, though a long-time coming, Holding Absence \\"prove[d] that art cannot be rushed, relinquishing a stellar debut that bares the human soul, emotion, and conviction in abundance\\" In aid of the record release, Holding Absence started touring, playing some of their biggest UK shows to date, joined by Luke Rainsford and The Nightmares. Holding Absence spent the remainder of the year touring Europe with Being As An Ocean and Counterparts in the summer, before returning again alongside Sleeping With Sirens in the winter. =2020: The Greatest Mistake of My Life= On 21 October 2020, the band announced their second full-length album, \\"The Greatest Mistake of My Life\\".https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-holding-absence-confirm-second-album- the-greatest-mistake-of-my-life/ Members=Current members= * James Joseph – bass * Ashley Green – drums * Lucas Woodland – vocals, keyboard * Scott Carey – guitar =Former Members= * Zac Vernon – vocals * Giorgio Cantarutti – guitar * Feisal \\"Fez\\" El-Khazragi – guitar * Chris Smitheram – guitar =Timeline=Discography=Albums= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" ! rowspan=\\"1\\" scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" data-ve- attributes=\\"{\\"style\\":\\"width:12em;\\"}\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"1\\" scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\" data-ve-attributes=\\"{\\"style\\":\\"width:19em;\\"}\\" Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Holding Absence  * Released: 8 March 2019 * Label: SharpTone, Nuclear Blast * Format: Music download, CD and Vinyl - ! scope=\\"row\\" The Greatest Mistake of My Life  * Released: 16 April 2021 * Label: SharpTone, Nuclear Blast * Format: Music download, CD and Vinyl } =EPs= { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" ! rowspan=\\"1\\" scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" data-ve-attributes=\\"{\\"style\\":\\"width:12em;\\"}\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"1\\" scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:19em;\\" data-ve- attributes=\\"{\\"style\\":\\"width:19em;\\"}\\" Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\" This Is As One  * Released: 16 February 2018 * Label: SharpTone, Nuclear Blast * Format: Music download and Vinyl * Notes: Split EP with Loathe } = Singles = { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" !Title !Year !Album - !‘’Immerse’’ 2016 Non-Album Single - !‘’Luna’’ 2016 Non-Album Single - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Permanent/Dream of Me\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" data-ve- attributes=\\"{\\"style\\":\\"text-align:center;\\"}\\" 2017  rowspan=\\"3\\" Non-Album Single - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Penance\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Heaven Knows\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Saint Cecilia\\" 2017 This Is As One - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Like A Shadow\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\" 2019  rowspan=\\"4\\" Holding Absence - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Perish\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"You Are Everything\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Monochrome\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Gravity\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2020  rowspan=\\"2\\" Non-Album Single - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Birdcage\\" } References 2015 establishments in Wales Musical groups established in 2015 Musical groups from Cardiff British post-hardcore musical groups Welsh rock music groups ","title":"Holding Absence"},{"id":"56382637","title":"Paul Groves (Australian coach)"},{"id":"56382650","text":"Skeletonemataceae is a family of diatoms in the order Thalassiosirales.

It is the type genus of its family. The genus Skeletonema was established by R.K. Greville in 1865 for a single species, S. barbadense, found in the Barbados deposit [Jung 2009]. These diatoms are photosynthetic organisms, meaning they obtain carbon dioxide from their surrounding environment and produce oxygen along with other byproducts. Reproduce sexually (sexual reproduction is oogamous) and asexually [Guiry 2011]. Skeletonema belong to the morphological category referred to as centric diatoms. These are classified by having valves with radial symmetry and the cells lack significant motility [Horner 2002]. Skeletonema are cylindrical shaped with a silica frustule. Cells are joined by long marginal processes to form a filament [Horner 2002]. Their length ranges from 2-61 micrometers, with a diameter ranging from 2-21 micrometers [Hasle 1997]. They are found typically in the neritic zone of the ocean and are highly populous in coastal systems [Jung 2009]. The genus is considered cosmopolitan, showing a wide range of tolerance for salinity and temperature [Hasle 1973]. For example, they have been found in various aquatic environments such as brackish or freshwater. Skeletonema are found worldwide excluding Antarctic waters [Hevia-Orube 2016]. Some harmful effects these diatoms may have on an ecosystem are attributed to large blooming events which may cause hypoxic events in coastal systems. Additionally, they are known to cause water discoloration [Kraberg 2010].  References  * \\"Descriptions of New and Rare Diatoms\\". R. K.

The madrasa does not contain mihrab but it has a square shaped prayer hall. The large entrance overlooks the northern facade of the sahn, which has unique compositions compared with the other Marinid architectures in Fez. The madrasa had around 140 students from across the country, distributed to the rooms on the ground and second floor. It also had a facility for healthcare. Today, the madrasa is facing the severe damage and collapse due to the lack of maintenance and the restoration attempt by the laypersons. Dome of the prayer room, the ceiling of the ablution room and some other rooms were destroyed, and the iconic marbles have also been deteriorated. However, it still retains the valuable elements of Marinid motifs and original forms of floral and geometric decorations, and currently undergoing the restoration initiated in the early 1990s.المدرسة المصباحية.

MCASOM is a school within the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science (MCCMS), the education division of the Mayo Clinic. It grants the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree, accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). In November 2018, the school was renamed in honor of a $200 million donation from businessman Jay Alix. Rankings As of 2020, U.S. News & World Report ranks Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine #6 (tie) on their \\"Best Medical Schools: Research\\" list. MCASOM is the most selective medical school in the United States, with the lowest acceptance rate (2.1%) among schools submitting data for the 2017-2018 application cycle. In 2017, medical students had the highest USMLE Step 1 board scores in the nation with a median of 245 (tied with Harvard). Approximately 70% of MCASOM graduates matched with their first-choice residency program during the 2016 Match. Graduates also have the lowest educational debt of all medical schools surveyed by USA Today in 2017. MCASOM students receive their hospital training at the Mayo Clinic Rochester, ranked #1 on the 2018-19 U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals Honor Roll, as well as at the Mayo Clinic Phoenix (#11 on Best Hospitals Honor Roll) and the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville. History Mitchell Student Center in Rochester, MN The Mayo Foundation appointed cardiologist Dr. Raymond Pruitt as the first dean of the Mayo Medical School (now Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine) in 1970, publicly announcing its creation the following year. It officially opened on September 5, 1972, with an inaugural class of 40 students, becoming the 110th medical school in the United States and the 2nd in Minnesota. The MCASOM was accredited as a medical school by the LCME in 1972 but the Mayo Foundation did not have regional institutional accreditation for granting degrees. Therefore, the Mayo Foundation began operations of the MCASOM through an affiliation established with the University of Minnesota in 1915 for graduate degree and medical specialty programs. Thus the MCASOM granted its first M.D. degrees in 1976 under the University of Minnesota's North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) accreditation. The Mayo Foundation terminated their affiliation with the University of Minnesota in 1983, becoming an independent degree-granting institution accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the NCA the following year. A reorganization of the Mayo Foundation in 1989 spun out a new graduate degree-granting school called the Mayo Graduate School, now named the Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (MCGSBS). This facilitated the start of the M.D.-Ph.D. program, which became the Mayo Clinic Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) in 2003 when it was first awarded a T32 grant by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The Mayo Clinic historically provided a merit scholarship—the amount of which was based on state of residency—to every matriculating student not receiving extramural full-tuition support.Tuition Though MCASOM has since moved to awarding grant aid based primarily on student need, it recently ranked as one of the most affordable private medical schools in the country. =Renaming= The Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine has been renamed twice in its history. The first took place in 2017 when the school was renamed from Mayo Medical School to Mayo Clinic School of Medicine in order to clarify its focus and function more clearly. The second took place in November 2018, when it was renamed Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine in honor of a $200 million donation from businessman Jay Alix. Culture and traditions Gonda Building main entrance The Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine has a distinct culture from that of most other medical schools. Mayo medical students wear business attire (often referred to as \\"Mayo wear\\") instead of white coats in the clinic to convey professionalism and respect for patients. Accordingly, there is no white coat ceremony—first-year students instead participate in a Commitment to Human Values ceremony in which they make their Physician's Pledge to Patients, Colleagues, and Society (adapted from the Hippocratic Oath). Students at MCASOM are party to other Mayo Clinic traditions during their training. At the Mayo Clinic, faculty doctors are referred to as \\"consultants\\", as opposed to the term \\"attending\\" used elsewhere. Additionally, because the Mayo brothers were left-handed surgeons, Mayo medical students are taught to glove their left hand first when scrubbing in to procedures. First-year students also learn formal dining etiquette for meals at the Mayo Foundation House in preparation for benefactor events, visiting dignitaries, and society dinners (e.g. Mayo Clinic Oncology Society, Sigma Xi). =Mentorship= First-year students are inducted into the Mayo Clinic Alumni Association (MCAA) and given their first stethoscopes by alumni. Medical students are encouraged to explore and develop their specialty interests early on through the Career Advisory and Mentorship Program—which pairs students with faculty physicians—as well as through their Mentorship Family. Because the Mayo Clinic has the largest residency and fellowship program in the United States, the MCAA Alumni Connect program provides medical students access to an extensive network of prominent physicians at a variety of institutions. =Student life= MCASOM students are eligible for membership in the Mayo Fellows Association, which puts together social events for medical and graduate students, residents, and fellows. Other social outlets available to students include the Mayo Employee Resource Groups (MERGs). These MERGs sponsor programs and activities for Mayo Clinic affiliates identifying with diverse communities, such as LGBTI, women leadership, and Native American heritage. The Alice Mayo Society and Mayo Families’ Connection offer moving, career, and social support for significant others of MCASOM students. Arts and other creative pursuits are part of many students' experiences at MCASOM. The Mayo Clinic Dolores Jean Lavins Center for Humanities in Medicine sponsors year-round programs in art making, creative writing, improvisational theater, and musical performance. The center publishes The Tempest creative arts publication annually—a collection of poetry, prose, and visual art meant to illustrate the growth of medical students into physicians. Campuses The Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine is integrated with the Mayo Clinic campuses in Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona; and Jacksonville, Florida. =Rochester, Minnesota= Mitchell Student Center in front of the Guggenheim Building MCASOM has its administrative center and primary location at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. It is the largest medical school campus in the United States, with 11.5 million square feet of medical and research space in a single location. Educational activities are based at the Mitchell Student Center and Guggenheim Building, particularly in the Kendall-Hench lecture hall. Students also attend classes and conduct laboratory exercises in the Stabile Building, which contains a state-of-the-art anatomy laboratory and a Multidisciplinary Simulation Center. The Plummer Building is home to the Mayo Clinic Libraries system—one of the largest medical libraries in the world—which offers students access to around 400,000 bound volumes and 4,800 medical and scientific journal subscriptions. The Gonda Building houses several seminar rooms and the Mayo Clinic Center for Innovation, a facility where students can develop ideas to improve health care alongside staff and entrepreneurs. The adjacent Mayo Building has a number of conference rooms used for small group exercises. Together, the Gonda and Mayo buildings comprise the core outpatient clinical practice facilities in downtown Rochester. The Mayo Clinic Hospital — Rochester provides extensive inpatient learning experiences for medical students with 2,059 licensed beds and 115 operating rooms across the Methodist Campus, Saint Marys Campus, and Mayo Eugenio Litta Children's Hospital. Each year, the Rochester campus matriculates 46 M.D. students, 7 M.D.-Ph.D. students, and 2 M.D.-O.M.S. students, for a total incoming class size of 55. These students have the opportunity to complete their selective experiences, third- and fourth-year rotations, clinical electives, and research projects (including Ph.D. dissertations) at the campuses in Arizona and Florida. The City of Rochester is currently undergoing a 20-year, $5.6 billion infrastructure improvement project called the Destination Medical Center (DMC). This public–private partnership, which started in 2013, matches public investment from a legislative bill for transportation infrastructure to private investments from the Mayo Clinic on its Rochester facilities. The overarching goal is to turn the campus into a global destination for health and wellness. Regional plans from the Rochester-Olmsted Council of Governments aim to attract outside companies and investments in the biotechnology industry and to double the population of the city by the year 2040.

Arizona-based medical students have their preclinical classes in Scottsdale, then complete most of their clerkships at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix during years 3 and 4. They may also rotate in pediatrics and related subspecialties through a partnership at Phoenix Children's Hospital. The Maricopa Integrated Health System offers medical students expanded rotation opportunities in psychiatry. Students may also rotate through the Carl T. Hayden Veterans Affairs Hospital for internal medicine and psychiatry. Each year, the Arizona campus matriculates 50 M.D. students. =Jacksonville, Florida= In addition to selectives and clerkships, up to 8 MCASOM students based in either Minnesota or Arizona have the option to complete years 3 and 4 at the Mayo Clinic Florida campus (Florida FOCUS 2+2 track). Curriculum The Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine is a leader and innovator in medical school curriculum development as a founding member of the American Medical Association Accelerating Change in Medical Education Consortium. The MCASOM Anatomy course in the fall of 2015 was featured in the documentary film The First Patient, written and directed by Chip Duncan. =Selectives= A unique feature of the MCASOM curriculum are the selectives, which have been shown to increase medical student academic productivity and the desire to conduct future research. There are twenty-eight undesignated weeks between blocks spread out during the first two years. Twelve of these weeks can be used as vacation or for dedicated USMLE Step 1 study time. The other sixteen must be spent doing something medically-related for at least 20 hours per week—these are termed selectives. Selectives allow students to shadow physicians, learn surgical skills, volunteer in free clinics, remediate courses, or do research. Each student is eligible for up to $1,500 in travel funding per year in order to visit other Mayo Clinic campuses, present research, or serve indigent patients. Established selective options include the Bounce Day course in emergency preparedness, Regenerative Medicine and Surgery, and Mission:BRAIN global health trips with Professor of Neurologic Surgery Dr. Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa. =Science of Health Care Delivery Certificate= Starting with the incoming class of 2015, the school formally integrated longitudinal coursework in the Science of Health Care Delivery (SHCD) into the four-year curriculum. This coursework entails a mixture of lectures and practical experiences. Studies of SHCD comprise six major domains: leadership, person-centered care, high value care, health economics and technology, population-centered care, and team-based care. The SHCD curriculum adds a social sciences perspective to the traditional medical school model, aiming to produce physicians aware of and capable of addressing problems in the US health care system. =Student-run and volunteer clinics= Students fulfill a community service requirement by seeing uninsured and underinsured patients at the Rochester Education and Advocacy for Community Health (REACH) free clinic throughout Year 2. Interested students can volunteer to staff other local free clinics—the Smoking Cessation Clinic, the Center Clinic in Dodge Center, and the Mayo Family Medicine Resident Clinic in Kasson—for selective credit or just to gain more experience. In Phoenix, Arizona, first and second year students see patients at St. Vincent de Paul community clinic. Academic partnerships Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine partners with several universities to offer its students access to expanded dual degree (e.g. medicine combined with law, business, or engineering) and study abroad opportunities. =Arizona State University (ASU)= The Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University Alliance for Health Care offers expanded academic and research opportunities for MCASOM students at ASU. This program allows medical students to earn additional degrees through ASU, including a Juris Doctor (J.D.) and a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.). =Paracelsus Medical University (PMU)= Paracelsus Medical University was developed based on the model and in close cooperation with MCASOM. PMU offers MCASOM students full scholarships to pursue medical research and clinical fellowships for up to one year at its campuses in Salzburg (Austria) and Nuremberg (Germany). =University of Oxford= MCASOM students have the opportunity to be involved (e.g. through selectives or student exchanges) at Mayo Clinic's London operation in partnership with the University of Oxford and the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

In the early 1920s it was a movement in theatre associated with the (FEKS), which rejected traditional theatrical acting in favor of a modern and physical performance incorporating shocking stunts, derived from the circus and other popular entertainment.“Eccentrism” entry in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance, Oxford University Press, 2005. A school of eccentrist cinema emerged from the theatre group in the later 20s. Sergei Eisenstein was briefly associated with the movement.  Eccentrism in theatre  In Russian, the word eccentric was used as a term of art for circus performers, referring to the tricks performed for the audience. In 1921 the young directors Grigory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, Sergi Yutkevich, and Gregory Kryzhitsky formed the theatre workshop “factory of the eccentric actor” (Fabrika Ekstsentricheskogo Aktera, or FEKS), in Petrograd. It was one of a plethora of avant-garde artists groupings blossoming in this period which attempted to respond to the faster paces of modernity within the openings perceived after the 1917 revolution. FEKS in particular advocated “an illogical performance style modeled on the physicality of circus stunts”, as well as on the popularity of American cinema of the period, such as Charlie Chaplin. page 6. The December 1921 manifesto of the eccentric theater “Ekstsentrism” pronounced: “1) for the actor—from emotion to the machine, from anguish to the trick. The technique—circus…. 2) for the director—a maximum of devices, a record number of inventions, a turbine of rhythms. 3) for the dramatist—a composer of tricks. 4) for the artist—decoration in jumps.”Grigory Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, Sergi Yutkevich, and Gregory Kryzhitsky, \\"Ekstsentrism,\\" 1922, reprinted in In true Futurist fashion the manifesto demanded the abandonment of the old culture, and was handed out on the streets of St. Petersburg. In New Worlds, Russian Art and Society, David Elliott states that “Eccentricism was a logical development from the alogical thought of the futurists. Artists introduced absurd elements or breaks in logic into their work in order to restructure and reorientate reality.” In July 1922 the main participants in FEKS expanded on the Eccentrist manifesto, and cited as parents of the movement, street language, circus posters, negro jazz bands, cinema, the music hall, the circus and boxing. Key to eccentrism in action was “synthesis of movements: acrobatic, gymnastic, balletic, constructivist- mechanical,” to give “the BASIC TEMPO of the epoch.” It was not till September 1922 that FEKS put on its first public performance, based loosely on Nikolai Gogol's Wedlock, but titled “Wedlock (Not from Gogol): A Stunt in Three Acts”. The playbill promised “Eccentrism presents: operetta, melodrama, farce, movies, circuses, variety, puppetry in a single performance!” According to contemporary reviews, the two main characters, scientists Albert and Einstein, “were played by circus eccentrics Serge and Taurek”, to “the utter delight of the audience.” “Eccentrism was the principle of organization of the entire spectacle”, with the actors joined by a dancer and a crowd of marchers. In “The Future of FEKS” of 1923, Sergy Radlov announced that, from this season, “FEKS will carry on work as an independent studio within the Petroproketkul’t”,Sergy Radlov, “The Future of FEKS” Teatr 3 (1923), cited in Senekick and Ostrovsky (eds.), p. 190. the Petrograd manifestation of the new Soviet Proletkult federation dedicated to revolutionary working-class aesthetic production. It was in this form that the group produced the Cocteau- influenced Foreign Trade on the Eiffel Tower (1923). By then, the group included well-known theatrical figures such as, SG Martinson, FF Knorre, as well as the dancer and silent film actress Z. Tarkhovskaya. Despite the stated links with the circus, a sympathetic critic, Vladimir Nedobrovo, wrote in 1928 that “the Eccentrism of the FEKS is not the same as the eccentrism of the music hall” and is concerned with opening up stilted perception through “impeded form” and “alienation of the object” from its automatic state, a vision which owed something to Russian Formalist poetics. Yutkevich went further, and claimed its “aim was the final destruction of the bourgeois world.” The young Sergi Eisenstein (then associated with the more mechanized aesthetic of Meyerhold's acting workshop) was introduced to FEKS by Sergi Yutkevich in 1922. He was strongly under its influence when he produced his first major work for the theater, The Montage of Attractions (1923), and worked with Tretiakov on The Wiseman, shown in the Moscow Proletkult Theatre in 1923. While FEKS cited Chaplin's cinema as an influence on their theater, and Eisenstein was influenced by FEKS theater in his later films, both took pains to distinguish the methods of fiction film from those of theater, unlike Meyerhold, who moved to merge their styles. Viktor Shklovsky wrote of the impossible, unexpected, and “eccentric” effects in Eisenstein's 1925 film, Strike.Shklovsky, Viktor, \\"Strike\\" (1922) in  Eccentrism in film  Out of the FEKS theater, a new film-making group was being formed. They were concerned not just with “the selection of memorial moments” in the words of contemporary Russian Formalist critic Viktor Shklovsky, but “a new, non- automatic connection between them.” This paralleled Eisenstein's ideas of a “montage of attraction.” The motivation behind this was summed up by Shklovsky in 1928: “Eccentrism is a struggle with the monotony of life, a rejection of its traditional conception and presentation.” However, Eisenstein soon broke with eccentrism to theorize his notion of “the attraction” in theatre and film as including, but going beyond, the “stunt” and the “trick,” on their own, in favor of a structure based on the ideological reactions of the audience.Sergi Eisenstein, “The Montage of Attractions” in LEF no. 3, 1923, translated and reprinted in Taylor and Christie, p. 87-89. Dziga Vertov was also to move beyond eccentrism in his work, declaring in his 1926 “The Factory of Facts” that cinema should be “Not a FEKS (the Leningrad Factory of the Eccentric Actor), nor Eisenstein’s ‘factory of attractions’” but “a factory of facts.”Dziga Vertov, 'The Factory of Facts' (1926), translated and reprinted in Taylor and Christie page 150-151. Between 1924 and 1929 FEKS produced five films under the banner of eccentricism.Widdis, Emma, “To Explore or Conquer?: On the Soviet Cultural Revolution,” in Evgeny Dobrenko and Eric Naiman (ed), The Landscape of Stalinism: The Art and Ideology of Soviet Space, U Washington Press, 2003, p.222 At this point, the Soviet Cinema Week reported the FEKS collective as having twenty-five members, including Leonid Trauberg and Grigorii Kozintsev as co-directors, Hungarian communist Evgenii Enei as art director and the important addition of Andrei Moskvin as cinematographer/cameraman. Their films were famous for exaggerated body movements, comedic acting, and extrovert character psychology. The first FEKS film was the 1924 Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny (The Adventures of an Octoberite) an agitational spectacle featuring a farcical villain and a chase scene set in the cupula of Petrograd's Saint Isaac's Cathedral. The film's combination of comedic entertainment and propaganda received a positive reaction from audience and critics, but, “it marked the end of the FEKS passion for the bizarre as a self-sufficient artistic objective.” In a following film, Chertovo kolesco (the Devil's Wheel, 1926), a love scene unfolds on a switchback in front of a funfair. Kozintsev described their film as based on the idea that “everything must be active.” While the popular funfair background is enticing, and reflects the spirit of the FEKS manifesto, in the film the carnival is seen as a vacation from more serious Bolshevik pursuits of building a new world, and so can be seen as an ideological self-criticism of earlier FEKS fascinations. The same could be said of the 1927 film S.V.D. where the “trickster” character served in the plot as a counter revolutionary bad character, questioning the solid identification of the FEKS aesthetic with the eccentric clown. In these films, technology was seen as on the side of a progressive modernism, but by FEKS last film, the 1929 Novyi Vavilon (New Babylon) featuring the uprising and suppression of the Paris Commune, impersonal machinery in the form of guns are on the side of oppression. In form, the sharp focus of Pokhozhdeniya Oktyabriny has given way to a diffuse cinematography using smoke, diffusion disks or Vaseline on the lens. The change in attitude towards the machine aesthetic parallels the degeneration of the Russian Revolution, and the film received an unfavorable critical reception.  Eccentrism’s demise  In its development from the 1921 manifesto, Eccentrism was faced with many crossroads; the aesthetic traditions of popular theatrical entertainment and the new cinema; silent and sound film, and avant-garde experimentation and socialist realism, all within the quickly changing ideas of the role of art in the 20s.Corrigan, Marina Natasha, (2015) “Soviet Eccentrism: A Can-Can on the Tightrope of Logic,” dissertation at University of California, Santa Barbara. By 1928 film production was effectively subsumed under the control of the state, and the soviet government was increasingly under the bureaucratic control of Joseph Stalin. Eccentrism, as with many of the early Soviet Avant-Garde movements, was not to survive the move to the state-sponsored “Socialist Realism.” In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Grigory Kozintsev, a founding member of FEKS theatre who had moved to FEKS filmmaking, produced more conventional stagings of Shakespeare at the Pushkin Theater in Leningrad (formerly Petrograd). He later made movies of Don Quixote (1957) and Hamlet (1964).

Biography Born in Yunnan, Pu's family was originally from Qinzhou, Guangxi. He graduated from Sun Yat-sen University College of Agriculture in 1935, earned his PhD at the University of Minnesota in 1949. He became Professor and Dean of Life Sciences at Sun Yat-sen University. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980. Pu is also known for his work of bringing together international (yang 洋， \\"foreign\\") scientific knowledge and Chinese (tu 土， \\"local\\") knowledge, thus playing an important, and exemplary role, in the history of science in the context of Chinese political history. Pu’s work also reflects the emphasis on nationalist self-reliance produced by economic constraints, China's odd position in Cold War geopolitics, and Maoist ideology. Although postsocialist biographies of Pu highlight his professional (yang) achievements and downplay his contributions to the self-reliance, mass mobilization, and nativism embodied in tu science, Pu's experience demonstrates that tu science could be a natural fit for agricultural scientists. At the same time, Pu skillfully navigated the tensions of the Cold War to serve as an effective agent of China's new form of transnationalism in the 1970s.

George was born in Monroe, Louisiana, where his parents encouraged an interest in the natural world. He studied at Louisiana Polytechnic Institute in Ruston from 1930 to 1932 when he moved to the Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge. He received a BS in 1934 and an MS in 1936. He worked for a while as an instructor and was assistant curator of the Museum of Zoology. He received a PhD from the University of Kansas in 1947 and returned to become a professor. In 1955 he was made Boyd Professor of Zoology. He published Louisiana Birds in 1955 which won the Louisiana Literary Award. He also made collection trips, some funded by the McIlhenny family, and he collaborated with Josselyn Van Tyne. His most famous contribution to ornithology was a technique he developed along with the astronomer W.A. Rense to study nocturnal migration. They recruited a number of amateur astronomers to collaborate and produce quantitative estimates of bird migration by direct observation. This was his doctoral research topic and he developed it with his students S. A. Gauthreaux and Robert J. Newman. He received the Brewster award of the American Ornithologists Union for this work in 1956.

She was also the first and the only woman in Australia, at the time, known to hold a 'X' certificate in oxy-welding and metallurgy.  Life  Bradford was born in Bega, New South Wales and grew up in Rubyvale, Queensland where her father, John 'Charles' Bradford, had been involved in the mining industry as a prospector and washing plant owner since approximately 1902. Having been a member of Fitzgerald's circus, Charles with his wife Emily, was also the proprietor of Bradford's Surprise Party Circus and Piano Orchestra which featured members of the Bradford family performing musical and comedy numbers and offering a program of acrobatic and trapeze acts held within their own marque or inside meeting halls throughout Far North Queensland in the early 1900s. May Bradford was an accomplished horse rider, competing in shows and being awarded the fastest time ever recordered by a man or woman for hunt riding on the Brisbane Showground in 1920. She was also an expert rifle shot and sportswoman. Bradford followed her father's second profession and became a qualified gem expert selling sapphires and opals. She married Francis Shepherd (10 April 1894 – 20 November 1933) in Rockhampton on 24 November 1919. They had two sons, Francis 'Frank' Ray (15 August 1921) and Henry 'Harry' James (11 November 1923), before her husband's death from injuries sustained some years earlier at Galipolli in World War I. Bradford became interested in aviation after overhearing a conversation in a cafe about how an Australian woman would never undertake the flight made by Amy Johnson between England and Australia in 1930. Bradford received flying lessons from Captain H. L. Fraser at Connor Park before moving to Brisbane to continue training at the Queensland Aero Club. She funded her lessons by selling gems, achieved her pilot's licence in 1931 and started working as a commercial pilot. Bradford spent at least four years as an apprentice mechanic at Mascot Airport and worked as a ground maintenance engineer for New England Airways. She had purchased her own aircraft, a Klemm Eagle but, being unhappy with the paintwork, sanded it back and repainted it in red, black and gold. She choose her own insignia, a golden eagle, and designed it herself based on one she saw on display at the Sydney Museum. She outfitted the interior of her plane with grey silk, included book holders and named it the Golden Eagle. May Bradford, at Parafield Airport for the Adelaide Centenary Air Race In 1936, she was one of the five female pilots in the Adelaide Centenary Air Race along with Nancy Bird, Lores Bonney, Freda Thompson and Ivy May Pearce. She completed the race in her Golden Eagle which was able to reach a ground speed of 175 miles per hour. While she was forced to stop the race on a number of occasions to tend to her aircraft, as a licensed engineer Bradford was able to undertake the repairs herself. Bradford offered joy rides around Sydney in her plane and would transport people where ever they required. She was planning a flight to London before she was killed with her passengers, Mrs Harriett Mastery (known as Miss Coley) and Miss Ellen Lattimer, when her Klemm Eagle clipped the wing of a plane being piloted by George Hoskins at Mascot Airport on 24 January 1937.

He also serves on the board for the Federation of American Hospitals.  Life and education  A son of two lawyers, Robert G. Breier and Eileen G. Breier, Breier grew up in Miami. He received a B.S. in economics from The Wharton School of Business at The University of Pennsylvania in 1993, and an MBA and MHA from The University of Miami in 1991. Breier and his family live in Louisville, Kentucky. His sister Lylle is a marketing executive at Walt Disney Company.  Career  Breier's healthcare career began in Florida where he worked as an administrator to help a hospital recover after devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew. In 1995, Breier was promoted to an assistant vice president at the hospital's system, Baptist Health Systems. In January 1997, Breier joined Premier Practice Management, a subsidiary of Premier, Inc., as chief operating officer, and he became chief executive officer in June 1998. After Premier, Breier served as vice president of Operations at Concentra, Inc., and in 2003, he was appointed Concentra's senior vice president of operations. In September 2019, Breier was named Chair of the Louisville Healthcare CEO Council (LHCC), which was formed in 2017 to leverage the strengths and assets of its members to solve important problems that extend beyond the scope of any one single member company.  Kindred Healthcare  Breier joined Kindred Healthcare in August 2005 as president of the company's Rehabilitation Division, where he served until he was appointed president of the Hospital Division in March 2008. In August 2010, Breier was promoted to chief operating officer of Kindred, and he assumed the additional responsibilities of president of the company in May 2012. In October 2014, Kindred announced that Breier would become chief executive officer, effective March 31, 2015. The appointment took effect as Kindred was completing its acquisition of home health and hospice provider Gentiva Health Services, a transaction that created the largest diversified provider of post-acute healthcare services in the country. In 2018, Breier oversaw a transaction with Humana, TPG Capital, and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (WCAS) that separated Kindred into two, privately held companies, a home health care company and a specialty hospital company. Effective July 2018, Breier became president and CEO of the specialty hospital company, Kindred Healthcare.  Awards and honors  In 2010, Modern Healthcare named Breier to its Up and Comers list.

She is currently a Professor Emerita in Education and in Linguistics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. An applied linguist, known for her work in second language acquisition, English as a second or foreign language, language teaching methods, teacher education, and English grammar, she is renowned for her work on the complex/dynamic systems approach to second language development. Career Larsen-Freeman began her career as a Peace Corps volunteer, teaching English in Sabah, Malaysia from 1967 to 1969, an experience she credits for igniting her fascination with language acquisition. She went on to graduate studies at the University of Michigan, earning her PhD in linguistics in 1975. Larsen-Freeman served on the faculty of first the University of California, Los Angeles and then the SIT Graduate Institute. In 2002, she returned to the University of Michigan to direct the English Language Institute; she was also appointed Professor in the School of Education and the Department of Linguistics. She retired from the University of Michigan in 2012, and holds emerita positions at the English Language Institute and in Education and Linguistics at the University of Michigan, as well as at the SIT Graduate Institute. She remains active in her field, and teaches courses on the structure of English and second language development as a visiting senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education. Larsen-Freeman concentrates her research on the process of second language acquisition. She also researches English grammar, which she regards not only as a set of structural patterns, but also as an important resource for making meaning and for adapting language to the communicative context. She has found that complexity theory provides new insights into language, its acquisition, and its use. She sees all three as complex, non-linear, dynamic processes. Such a perspective has contributed to her dynamic perspective of language, which she has applied to teaching grammar, or “grammaring” as she calls it. The dynamic approach to second language development also acknowledges the individual paths that students chart to second language success, and views teaching as fundamentally a process of managing learning. Larsen-Freeman was also the editor of the journal Language Learning for five years. In 2020, Larsen-Freeman contributed to the volume, entitled Usage-based Dynamics in Second Language Development to honour Marjolijn Verspoor's work in applied linguistics. Research In 1997, she wrote a seminal article in which she suggested the application of complex/dynamic systems theory to study second language acquisition. A book of papers in her honor, Complexity Theory and Language Development, was published in 2017. Larsen-Freeman criticised Larry Selinker's Interlanguage in a chapter entitled Another Step to be Taken published in Han and Tarone's Interlanguage - Forty Years Later by claiming that there is no endpoint of the interlanguage continuum. She suggested the reconsideration of the Interlanguage. Bibliography=Books= *Larsen- Freeman, D. (Editor) (1980). Discourse Analysis in Second Language Research.

The funduq is situated in the heart of the medina, at Al-Najjarin Square (also: Nejjarine Square or Place Nejjarine), which is also notable for the Nejjarine Fountain, an attached saqayya or traditional public fountain. The building was designed for use by the merchants, traders, and visitors to the city of Fez and provided a storage place. It is a prominent example of Moroccan riad architecture.

History Place an-Nejjarine today, with the funduq on the left and the fountain on the right. The name al- Najjarin (or the French transliteration Nejjarine; ) means \\"carpenters\\", a reference to the historic presence of a carpenters' souq (market) around the square in front of the funduq today. The souq is believed to have existed since the Marinid era (1244-1465 CE). The funduq was commissioned by the amin (provost or magistrate) 'Adiyil in 1711, under the reign of the Alaouite Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif. Its attached saqayya (fountain) was commissioned in the 19th century by the Sultan Abd al-Rahman (ruled 1822–1859). Despite these developments from different dates, the various structures and the public square form an integrated whole in the local community. The building was originally used as a trading center, caravanserai (inn), and merchant warehouse associated closely with the Makhzen (the government or royal authorities). It likely continued to serve this function up until the beginning of the 20th century. Another funduq founded in the same year (1711), the Funduq Sagha () in northern Fes el-Bali, also exhibits a very similar architecture and decorative style. The funduq was classified as a national historic monument in 1916 and was used as a police station by the French colonial authority in the 1940s. The building was restored between 1990 and 1996, and on May 23, 1998 it was reopened as a private museum for wood arts and crafts known as Le Musée Nejjarine des Arts et Métiers du Bois.Funduq al- Najjariyyin.

English-medium schools are growing in popularity among the middle class, upper-middle-class and rich families. The English-medium schools not only teach the students about their own countries but also about the European History and Literature. The exams of the O-level and A-level students of Edexcel and Cambridge are conducted through British Council Bangladesh. The Daily Star Award is the most prestigious award provided to O-Level and A-Level examinees of Bangladesh, for their extraordinary academic performance. The criteria for an award are: 6 'A's in O-Levels, 3 'A's in A-Levels, and highest marks in O-Levels and A-Levels. Language The English-medium schools teach most of the subjects in English. Bengali is also taught. French and Spanish is taught in International School Dhaka. The St Francis Xavier's Green Herald International School also teaches French to its students from grade 6 onwards. These language skills help the students later in life when they go abroad for higher studies. Criticisms Critics of English medium curriculum point out that the students of English-medium are weak in their mother-tongue (Bengali). They say that in English-medium schools, English is the first priority. They also argue that English-medium students are less patriotic. These criticisms are similar to those that can be found in English-medium education. This is not always true, however. These days, schools try their best to educate their students about their own culture. Also, the students are not taught the social studies courses which sometimes discusses about the social problems the government is dealing with.

The attack was carried out by members of the commando unit of Mukti Bahini. Formation and deployment of Crack Platoon In June 1971, the World Bank sent a mission to observe the situation in East Pakistan. The media cell of Pakistan government maintained that the situation in East Pakistan was stable. Major Khaled Mosharraf, a sector commander of Mukti Bahini, planned to deploy a special commando team. The task assigned to the team was to carry out commando operations and to terrorise Dhaka. The main objective of this team was to prove that the situation was not stable. Moreover, Pakistan at that time was expecting economic aid. The plan was to stop the World Bank mission, and to make the UNHCR understand the true situation of East Pakistan, and therefore not provide financial aid. Khaled, along with Major ATM Hyder (a former SSG Commando), another sector commander, formed the Crack Platoon, initially of 17 members. They received commando training in Melaghar Camp. From Melaghar, commandos of the Crack Platoon headed for Dhaka on 4 June 1971 and launched the guerrilla operation on 5 June. Later, the number of commandos was increased, and the platoon was split and deployed in different areas surrounding Dhaka city. Operation Hotel Intercontinental On 9 June 1971 the commandos launched the first attack at InterContinental Dhaka. The commandos stopped in a car in front of the hotel, armed with ENERGA grenades, bayonets, and submachine guns. Five grenades were thrown in the attack. The operation was reported in BBC news.

The earthquake, measured at 7.9 on the scale, was approximately southeast of Kodiak and happened at a depth of . It was initially measured as a M 8.2 event, but later downgraded by the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake was felt throughout most of southern Alaska, including the major cities of Anchorage and Fairbanks, and parts of neighboring British Columbia. The earthquake prompted tsunami warnings and advisories for Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California, and Hawaii. Residents in low-lying areas along the Gulf of Alaska and in British Columbia were evacuated to shelters and higher ground. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center later cancelled most of the alerts within four hours of the earthquake, due to the apparent lack of tsunami. The highest recorded waves after the event measured at under above tide level on Kodiak Island. Earthquake According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred southeast of Kodiak, Alaska at 12:31 AM local time (AKST). Witnesses to the earthquake itself reported that it was very long in duration, feeling like a \\"slow roller,\\" but it was not a violent earthquake despite its magnitude. This was corroborated by witnesses in Anchorage. There was no immediate damage reported. The earthquake woke people in Anchorage, from the epicenter, and was felt as far as Fairbanks to the northeast and British Columbia to the southeast. The earthquake's S-waves arrived in Anchorage within one minute, and reached Fairbanks within three minutes. =Tectonic setting= The earthquake was a strike-slip event that occurred within the Pacific Plate. The epicenter was to the south of the Aleutian Trench, where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate. The region has produced twelve large earthquakes since 1900, including several megathrust earthquakes. =Aftershocks= The first major aftershocks occurred 20 minutes after the earthquake. The strongest aftershock measured 5.5 on the moment magnitude scale, while most measured 4–5. Within two days, the United States Geological Survey recorded over 50 aftershocks. More than 1000 aftershocks have been recorded well into March. Alerts and evacuations Communities on Kodiak Island and other coastal areas on the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet were evacuated after warning sirens were activated. Hundreds gathered in local schools, which were opened as evacuation shelters, in Kodiak, Seward, and Homer. Evacuees seeking higher ground filled local roads and the parking lots of supermarkets, while locals reported large numbers of evacuees parking near a wind farm on Pillar Mountain near Kodiak. An unrelated power outage at the Alaska Earthquake Center in Fairbanks caused some alerts to be delayed, while its website was overwhelmed by the number of users. The National Weather Service sent emergency alerts to cell phones in Alaska, reading, \\"Emergency Alert. Tsunami danger on the coast. Go to high ground or move inland.\\" The National Weather Service and Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a tsunami watch for Hawaii and the entire West Coast, but cancelled them after less than two hours. In the San Francisco Bay Area, residents within three blocks of the Pacific coast and five blocks of the San Francisco Bay were warned by the city's Department of Emergency Management to be ready for evacuation. Some aspects of the warning systems in place were delayed or failed to issue a warning at all, prompting multiple reviews of the warning infrastructure.

The palace was commissioned by the Alaouite Sultan Hassan I in the late 19th century and finished under his successor Abdelaziz. It was converted into a museum of historical arts and crafts in 1915 with a collection that now comprises over 6,500 objects. The palace is located near Bab Bou Jeloud at the western edge of Fes el-Bali, the old medina quarter of the city, and close to Fes el-Jdid, the new medina quarter. History Before the reign of Moulay Hassan I (ruled 1873-1894), the land on which Dar Batha is located was occupied only by small isolated structures between Fes el-Bali and Fes el-Jdid. It was only when Moulay Hassan decided to build a corridor of walls connecting the two cities that much of this space was filled with royal gardens (such as Jnan Sbil) and palaces. The land for Dar Batha was purchased from the wealthy Ben Jelloun family of Fes. Dar Batha was part of a palace complex, along with the Dar al-Beida (\\"White Palace\\") on its west side, which was constructed to serve as a summer palace and as a residence for distinguished visitors and guests. The palace was commissioned and begun in the late 19th century by Moulay Hassan I and then finished and embellished by Moulay Abdelaziz (ruled 1894-1908). One source reports that construction took place between 1886 and 1907. The adjoining Dar al-Beida was completed by Sultan Abdelhafid (ruled 1909-1912), the last independent sultan of Morocco in the early 20th century. Main entrance to Dar al-Beida, another palace and garden complex adjacent to Dar Batha on its western side In 1912 the two palaces were used to house the services of the Resident-general of the new French Protectorate. This function continued to be served by the Dar al-Beida palace, but in 1915 Dar Batha was converted into a museum of local arts (previously housed at the Dar Adiyel), then eventually as a national ethnographical museum and cultural center. In 1924 it was classified as a national monument. The Dar al-Beida continues to be used by the government as a reception palace, and consists of a large garden with pavilions, entered via a monumental gate to the southwest. One of the canals derived from the Oued Fes (Fes River) passes through its gardens.  Architecture  The main entrance of the building leads to a vast rectangular courtyard around which the building is centered. The courtyard is surrounded by galleries and by the two main wings of the building are at its eastern and western ends. The courtyard floor is decorated at its west and east ends with colorful zellij mosaic tilework across its floor and around its ornamental fountains. The galleries at the east and west ends of the courtyard consist of large horseshoe arches in brick, while the galleries to the north and south of the central garden are made of painted wood. Some of the other rooms around the palace are also decorated with zellij and painted woodwork. The garden represents a typical riad layout and Andalusian style, a rectangular area divided into four parts along its two central axes, with a fountain at its middle. It makes up around 58% of the entire area of the palace. The garden was originally arranged by landscape architect Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier in 1915 for the recreational use of the visitors, especially during the summer. Among the tree and plant species here are palm trees, jacarandas, and hibiscus. Today, concerts and religious festivals are held in the garden.

The film was directed by Kujtim Çashku and its main theme is the blood feud (Gjakmarrja) on a strong political background. The story is set in 1939 Albania and revolves around two main threads. It depicts a couple on a trip in the mountainous north of the country during their honeymoon (starring Vangjush Furxhi and Rajmonda Bulku) and the last days of freedom of a 26-year-old highlander (Piro Qirjo), who has taken revenge for his brother's death, in respect of the traditional law of the region, the Kanun. Plot The writer Besian Vorpsi (Vangjush Furxhi) is waiting in the hall of the Royal Palace. Before him, a police officer (Gjon Karma) has been summoned by the King's adjutant (Luan Qerimi) to follow the new austerity measures the King's government has taken after 62 men have been convicted of serious political guilt. The adjutant goes on to explain that most of them were communists, among whom he shows Martin Alushi (Timo Flloko), who has translated Marx's works and is interned in the north of Albania under the supervision of a local prince. Next, the three main religious leaders of Albania get called in. A pack of Camel cigarettes and a photo of the Albanian King Zog is shown on a table, while the adjutant seeks the leaders' support for the King's policies. After them Besian Vorpsi gets received in. The adjutant demands Besian as an influential writer, to go to the north and assure the local prince of the King's support and inviolability of the Kanun. Besian is firstly reluctant to obey since he is getting married in few days, but the adjutant convinces him to spend the honeymoon there and simultaneously do the job. Couples are shown dancing under a dim light and Siegfried's Funeral March of Wagner’s Götterdämmerung is playing in the background. Besian Vorpsi declares that he and his wife Diana (Rajmonda Bulku) will spend their honeymoon in the northern highlands. Cezar, a Besian's colleague, calls him out on his decision implying that Besian is being politically used in going somewhere that he had himself previously dubbed as the \\"territories of death\\". A quiet talk for the upcoming trip follows between the couple in their bedroom. Besian talks about the customs in the north and persuades Diana to come with him and enjoy the beauties of that region. Eventually the couple sets out on the journey to the north of Albania in a horse-drawn carriage. On the way, Besian shows to Diana a highlander with his typical costume and a black armband. He explains with admiration to her that the piece of cloth is a symbol that he either has to \\"take blood\\" (revenge) or is a target to be killed. Gjorg Berisha (Piro Qirjo), is waiting in an ambush near the road with his riffle. After the carriage leaves behind, Gjorg takes aim at an approaching man passing by. At first he hesitates and sighs, then aims again at his target and shoots the man. The couple hears the shooting too. The next moment Gjorg goes to see his victim. Shocked by what he has done he runs away and tells about his killing to the first men he sees so that they can turn his victim right, according to the tradition. Then he runs into Martin Alushi and tells him the same thing. The couple arrives to a guesthouse at night. Next morning Gjorg wakes up, goes to his sheep and plays the flute. He contemplates to his sister about this custom of revenge, calling the killing as horrible and saying that attending the funeral of his victim and the lunch after it is meaningless and unbearable. Meanwhile the couple is having breakfast and Besian notices through his binoculars how in the neighbouring tower, they are washing the blood from the old victim's shirt (Gjorg's brother) since he now was vindicated, while on the other tower they are raising the new bloodshed shirt (Gjorg's victim) as a symbol for an upcoming revenge. Church bells are heard to signal the funeral. The couple sees from the distance how both the victim's and the killer's father attend the funeral in silence, while the killer is also with them. After the funeral, Gjorg and his father have a short talk at home. His father gives him a sack of money, so he can pay the \\"blood tax\\" (money paid for 1 month truce) to the prince. The couple stops for a coffee at a guesthouse near a church. In the same place, Gjorg has a short break. Before he resumes his walk, Diana sees him and secretly takes a photo of him. They continue the trip in the carriage, where Besian rebukes her for taking that shot, but quickly forgets about it as they see again Gjorg walking along the way. Near the road, two gendarmes are dragging down a man for being indebted with a local Bajraktar. Martin Alushi tries to intervene but is pushed away by the gendarmes. Besian stops the carriage and gets out. He recognizes Martin and doesn't speak. This infuriates Martin who knows the writer and calls his silence and his trip a shame. In the evening, Gjorg arrives in the prince's tower, followed by the couple. While Besian and Diana are welcomed by the prince (Mario Ashiku) dressed in local costume, Gjorg and the other men who had killed for blood feud are waiting in a room to pay the \\"blood tax\\". Mark Ukaçjerra (Reshat Arbana) who is the blood feud’s reeve, summons Gjorg and fills his name in a list. Gjorg gives the money and Mark tells him he has one month truce (6 March – 6 April). The prince, now wearing a tuxedo, receives the couple with a lavish dinner. He talks about the Kanun and Gjakmarrja. The prince and Mark complain about the diminishing blood feuds. Diana asks if they earn money from these blood feuds, and her husband looks at her angrily. The prince replies that the Kanun is a thousand year old, and neither did he invent it or earn from it, but he only guards it. When alone together, the prince makes Mark guilty of the diminishing income since people are giving up on the blood feud. Late at night Besian wakes up, leaves the room and goes to talk to the prince. His wife is worried and goes to look for him. Besian tells the prince that the King esteems his power in the north of the country and supports him, without wanting to interfere in the prince's local authority and the Kanun. On the other hand, the prince appreciates Besian's writings and visit and shows him gratitude. The next morning in the carriage, Diana confronts Besian on why he didn't come to her at night and that he is hiding something to her. She looks at him doubtfully and they leave in silence with the carriage. While travelling, the couple assists a property dispute and the curious Besian and his wife get closer. A geometer approaches Besian and tells him to write about the difficult life they live in, without having the right to exercise their professions and dubbing all that as a \\"tragicomedy\\". Gjorg is counting his remaining days of freedom. He decides to go up the mountains during his remaining days. His father hands him 2 bullets while his sister ties him the black armband and gives him the flute. On his way, Gjorg runs into Mark Ukaçjerra. Mark tells that he would forgive Gjorg's blood feud and spare his life if he kills a King's enemy, the interned man. Gjorg shakes his head for no and leaves in silence. Along the way he notices a traditional wedding moment and imagines if he was the groom instead. In the carriage, Besian tells to Diana he will go to meet a local leader while she can wander and photograph around. Diana gets into a poor house in miserable conditions where the housewife complains the authorities have jailed her husband. In the carriage Diana talks about her bad impressions inside the tower and recalls a poem of Migjeni. On his way, Gjorg has a friendly encountering with Martin and two highlanders. But they all stand up and leave when Mark approaches. Martin meets his wife who has come from Tirana. She talks about politics, that Italy has sent an ultimatum to Albania and that the fascists may be disembarking unexpectedly. She tells him that the people have no trust in the Kingdom's army anymore. Their meeting is short because a gendarme is waiting for them. On the way back, Besian and Diana's carriage sees that Cezar is a new convicted. He is tied and guarded by three gendarmes, what doesn't impede him from speaking angrily and feeling revolted at Besian. Meantime Mark Ukaçjerra meets a traditional judge of Kanun, asking him a false judgement, but he denies. Besian stops the carriage and together with Diana goes to meet a doctor he recognizes. He had studied in Austria for microbiology. After coming back to Albania he had made a study to eradicate malaria, but was treated as a madman for his requests and sent to the north. He goes on to explain Besian that now he serves as a type of judge who has to check and decide upon the wounds of a killed man on blood feud, so as each wound on the body is paid differently. A fierce argument starts between them and Diana leaves and hides away. After Besian finds her, Diana accuses him of playing the deaf and blind in this tragedy. In the next scene, Martin goes to cut timber. While he is cutting down a poplar tree with an axe, Mark hidden on the ground shoots at him. Gjorg Berisha is wandering nearby and upon hearing the shot, runs at Martin, asking who shot. The dying Martin replies that the King and the Tower shot at him, but this order will collapse and then everything will be different. Hearing the shot, several men approach the scene. Gjorg tells that there is no greater shame than to shoot behind the back of an innocent who was not even from there, declaring that the King, the prince and Mark Ukaçjerra shot him, opening up about the later's promise to spare his life if he would shoot at Martin. When the group leaves, a boy reads aloud one of Martin's papers \\"The King is disarming the people and is selling the country to the foreigners\\". The next day Gjorg is wandering on a plain and turns up his head to see a passing airplane. A gunshot is heard and he falls to the ground with arms wide open. Sometime after the shot, Besian and Diana's carriage happen to drive close to him and they stop in silence to see his dead body. More airplanes are heard to fly above them. On the late afternoon they stop at a government office to call the Royal court in Tirana but nobody replies. Then the carriage gets ambushed by a group of armed highlanders, who assumed the king and the queen were inside. Realizing it is not them, they leave. Besian asks a gendarme who reveals that the King has left the country and the kingdom is falling down. After the carriage leaves, he takes off the uniform and ties a reddish scarf around the neck, a symbol of the Partisans’ Resistance. As the carriage continues, a long line of armed highlanders are marching. \\"Albania is attacked by an enemy. The feuds are closed.\\" ― two of them say. More airplanes patrol the sky throwing flyers down. Besian goes out to see and returns in desperation to Diana. The armed highlanders continue to walk in line and the film ends.

The theatre was wrecked in a riot of 1814; and there were further riots in 1819. Jones attributed his unpopularity to his being active in politics; in 1807 he had supported the election of an anti-ministerial member of parliament for Dublin. His application in 1818 for renewal of the patent was refused, being granted instead to Henry Harris, a proprietor of Covent Garden Theatre. The years of disruption had been financially detrimental, and he was imprisoned for debt. During the 1819–20 season the Crow Street Theatre did not open regularly. =End of the theatre= The theatre was rented for a short period and opened as a circus, and was then abandoned. In 1836 the Apothecaries' Hall Company bought part of the site, and a medical school was built.John C. Greene.

The Lindormen class is currently in service with the Estonian Navy.  History  The class consists of two ships: KDM Lindormen (N43) () and KDM Lossen (N44) (). The purchase of the cable-minelayers was approved in the 1973 defence bill. The ships were built by Svendborg Skibsværft in 1977 and commissioned on 14 June 1978. One of the ships served as a command and support ship in STANAVFORCHAN, under Danish Navy. Both ships were decommissioned by the Danish Navy on 22 October 2004 and sold to Estonia in 2006. They were renamed and and would later find service in the Standing NATO Mine Countermeasures Group 1. Wambola was held in reserve until it replaced Tasuja in Estonian Navy service in 2016.  Design  The ships have a steel hull and were originally designed to lay controlled minefields, though they would later be used as support vessels. The ships were initially propelled by two 800 horsepower Frichs diesel engines with two adjustable propellers. They were later replaced with two MTU diesel engines, providing 1600 kW of power in total. The ships were initially armed with two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons - one fore and one aft. In 1985, another 20 mm cannon was added to the fore. In 1997, a pair of FIM-92 Stinger launchers were also added. The weapons were removed when they were sold to Estonia. Estonian Navy later equipped the ships with M2 Browning machine guns. They are also equipped with two I-band navigation radars, two cranes (one 2 tonne crane fore and one 2.8 tonne crane aft) and two boats. The ships have a large mine deck, sufficient for carrying 50-60 naval mines, but can also be used for diving support, training or command duties.

An instrumentalist and singer, she was a pioneer of the authentic instruments movement, which insisted that as far as practical music from earlier periods should be performed using instruments of the period when the music was written or, failing that, replicas.Ilse Reicke: Die Musikantin Olga Schwind – Weg und Widerhall, Darmstadt 1981  Life  Olga Schwind was born in Saarbrücken where her father worked as a jurist at the district court. However, the family came from nearby Tholey where her paternal grandfather Johann Theodor Schwind, a lawyer, had been posted from Berlin and worked as the court clerk. Theodor Franz Schwind, her father, had grown up in the family home which had been converted from the refractory of a former Benedictine monastery, and married Bertha Heise, the daughter of the local postmaster. Olga and her younger brother spent much of their early childhood with their grandparents, growing up in the magical ambience of the abbey church, the monastery gardens and monastic ruins that adjoined the family home. Later she attended school in Saarbrücken and then in 1903 went on to take a \\"finishing year\\" with the Ursulines at a convent across the border, in Belgium, at which stage she was already involving herself with organising student musical presentations. She returned to Saarbrücken by 1905, learning to play the guitar using an instrument which she shared with her brother. She also taught herself to play the lute, reaching the point at which she became a teacher of the instrument at Saarbrücken's newly established music conservatory. Between 1905 and 1907 she rapidly became interested in the sounds made by historic instruments and in classical music, which she followed up by consulting old folios, tablets and handwritten manuscripts, attempting to understand how pre-industrial instruments would have been used, using old images and other contemporary sources. During the decades that followed, working with craftsmen, she would successfully create replicas of old instruments, including harps, panpipes, portatives and hurdy-gurdies.Antonius Lux (ed.): Große Frauen der Weltgeschichte. Tausend Biographien in Wort und Bild. Sebastian Lux Verlag, München 1963, p. 428. During this time she also took several trips to Basel in order to seek out medieval texts and chants in the university archives. In 1907 she moved to Munich where she studied the lute with Robert Korthe who after a year sent her on to his own teacher, Heinrich Scherrer (1865–1937) for further lessons. In 1910 she came into contact with Louis Pinck, a priest based in Metz who was also a music teacher, a noted folklorist and a folksong collector. Together they traveled in Lotharingia (which had been part of Germany since 1870/71), embarking on a project to collect the folk music of the region. Pinck documented the lyrics and Schwind wrote down the melodies of the folk songs they came across. In 1918 she first made contact with Corry de Rijk. They discovered a shared enthusiasm for ancient music, and over the next few decades toured Europe extensively in pursuit of their interest. The women were friendly with the princesses of the von Wied family, as a result of which many aristocratic doors were opened to them across Germany, Austria and Italy, where Schwind and de Rijk gave their \\"Musica Antiqua\\" concerts together, sometimes privately and sometimes in public. One high point was a performance at Huis Doorn, home to the exiled German emperor. Another, a little later, took place in Rome in front of the Pope. At the same time Schwind maintained her contacts in her home region, the Saarland, where locally she acquired the status of a minor celebrity. During 1935 she was back home, campaigning prominently in the referendum campaign in favour of reunification. In 1939 she went into exile in Ticino. Her music was no longer in favour with the authorities, and there was a concern that her Dutch partner might face arrest in Germany. During the war years she lived on in Switzerland in relative poverty. Friends provided accommodation and also, sometimes, food. The concerts became infrequent. After 1945 Schwind remained in Ticino. Within the canton she moved house several times between 1945 and 1953, her material circumstances evidently improving again, little by little. There was a series of concerts in London in 1953. In 1954 there came a parting of the ways with Conny de Rijk, but she continued to give musical performances with other accompanists mostly, now, in southern Germany. The intervention of friends enabled her to relocate again, in 1955, to the \\"Casa Pineta\\" (loosely: \\"House surrounded by pine trees\\") at Ronco sopra Ascona, and in 1957 the house was acquired on her behalf by a Mrs. Johanna Becker from Saarbrücken. It was here, on the shore of Lake Maggiore, that she would live out the rest of her life. In 1957 she teamed up with the feminist writer Ilse Reicke, and the two of them took to giving \\"house concerts\\" in the \\"Casa Pineta\\". Although there is mention of Olga Schwind having \\"retired\\" in 1955, other sources suggest that she was still undertaking \\"Musica Antiqua\\" winter concert tours, at least as far as southern Germany, during the later 1950s. A 1952 newspaper report on a concert appearance in the drafty confines of Schloss Elmau (near Garmisch) provides an engaging glimpse of Olga Schwind as \\"the 'Meisterin' of Musica Antiqua with her unique collection of instruments, dating back as far as the ninth century, and her extensive repertoire of Medieval and Baroque songs in all the languages\\". There can be little doubt that by the time Olga Schwind died in the \\"Casa Pineta\\" on 12 May 1979, that unique collection of ancient instruments had become significantly larger. Olga Schwind never married and she had no children. She had nephews and nieces because of her younger brother, but after they grew up the siblings grew apart. Her nephew gained the impression from his relatively straight-laced father that his aged aunt had followed an alternative somewhat \\"Bohemian\\" path, tainted by a certain \\"artistic craziness\\" (\\"Verrücktheit\\"). Her death triggered the pressing challenge of preserving her collection. The solution came from Tholey where her grandfather had lived and where she had spent her childhood, and where now much of her collection is displayed in the basement of the local museum. Other items from her collection have found their way, apparently on a permanent basis, into the collection of the Basel Historical Museum.

Mount Selby in Antarctica's Britannia Range is named for him. Biography Born in Luton, Bedfordshire, England, on 13 January 1936, Selby studied at Keble College, Oxford, gaining a BA(Hons), MA, and DipEd. Selby came to New Zealand on the RMS Rangitata in 1960, and was appointed as a junior lecturer at the Waikato branch of the University of Auckland. On the establishment of the University of Waikato in 1964, he joined the new Department of Geography, and then the Department of Earth Sciences when it was formed in 1970. The following year, he completed a DPhil: the title of his doctoral thesis was Runoff, infiltration and soil erodibility studies in the Otutira catchment. He was later awarded a Doctor of Science degree from the University of Oxford on the basis of his research linking concepts in geomorphology with quantitative measurements in engineering geology. Selby took part in either three or four field expeditions to Antarctica, including in 1968–69, 1971–72, and 1978–79. On the first of these, he became the first geomorphologist to travel to Antarctica. The 1978–79 trip to the Britannia Range–Darwin Glacier region was led by Selby, and mapped exposures in the McCraw Glacier area, and discovered iron meteorites on Derrick Peak. Selby also made expeditions to the Sahara, Namib, and Atacama Deserts, as well as to the Himalayas and Colorado. He also visited the Eastern Mediterranean after developing a research interest in archaeology and human evolution and dispersion. In 1980, Selby was appointed as a professor of earth sciences at Waikato. During his academic career, he wrote six books and more than 80 refereed scientific papers. In the later part of his career, Selby was part of the senior administrative team at Waikato, and served as deputy vice-chancellor (research). He took part in the Treaty of Waitangi negotiations with Waikato Tainui relating to the ownership of the university campus. On his retirement from Waikato in 2002, Selby was granted the title of emeritus professor. He continued to serve the university as chair of the University of Waikato Foundation and as a director of companies commercialising research at the university. Selby became a naturalised New Zealander in 1980. He died on 21 January 2018. Honours and honorific eponym In the 2005 New Year Honours, Selby was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to education. A peak in the Britannia Range in Antarctica was named Mount Selby, in honour of Selby, by the New Zealand Antarctic Placenames Committee.

Review, instead writing a polemical article titled \\"Cult of the Noble Amateur\\" in which she wrote: \\"Plum is the product not of a poet but of a personality. I was supposed to be reviewing it, but to do so for a poetry journal would imply that it deserves to be taken seriously as poetry. Besides, I was too distracted by the pathological attitude of its faux-naïve author, and too offended by its editor's exemplary bad faith, to ignore the broader questions it provokes.\\" Although the article began from this point Watts also discussed the work of poets such as Rupi Kaur and Kate Tempest. This article subsequently received coverage in several national news outlets such as The Guardian, which described it as, variously \\"excoriating\\", \\"a stinging critique\\" and \\"Giving a fresh meaning to the notion of a poetry slam\\". Watts was also interviewed on Front Row as a result of this article. Responses to the article also appeared elsewhere – an article written for The Times Literary Supplement stated: \\"So: Hollie McNish is a terrible poet. Or: Hollie McNish is a wonderful poet. Leave her alone, OK? As ever, the people who care, or pretend to care, about poetry cannot make up their collective mind. This time round, it is an essay in the latest issue of the poetry magazine PN Review, 'The Cult of the Noble Amateur\\". McNish commented on her blog: \\"I just feel like this is an extremely one-sided piece and if it's going to be used to prove how shite and attention-seeking I am, I'd like a space to stand up for myself\\", before going on to provide a line-by-line response to the essay.

It provides entertainment to the patients and staff of Ashford and St Peters Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The station broadcasts using WiFi speakers at St Peters Hospital and Ashford Hospital, as well as on the internet to the local community of North West Surrey and Middlesex The station is run as a charity by volunteers (registered charity number 275620). Today Radio Wey has over 60 members, who work together, to present a range of live programmes each week. They also carry out all the roles necessary to run the station, such as administration, maintenance of the equipment, and raising the funds. As Radio Wey has no income or grant aid, it needs to raise all money it needs to run the station. This comes from member’s subscriptions, donations and fundraising activities  History  The origins of Hospital Radio Wey go back to the mid-1960s when two friends, Alan Timbrell and John Best spent some of their leisure time visiting patients in Weybridge Hospital and finding out what kind of music they liked. The patients’ choices of music were then recorded onto a tape recorder in Alan’s home. They then returned to the hospital with the tape recorder and played the music to the patients in the wards. Once acceptance was gained, the hospital offered a room for the production of programmes. At that time there was no ready-made equipment for a home studio, therefore it was necessary to construct equipment from kits produced for radio DIY enthusiasts. A basic studio with an interviewer’s desk and record storage was constructed which made it possible to broadcast live programmes to the wards over the patient headphone system, which were initially Bakelite headphones, later to be replaced with the plastic tube Stethoscope system. The first live broadcast was on 5 October 1967. The schedule at that time consisted of 13 hours of programmes a week, presented by three broadcasters. The studio at Weybridge Hospital was then linked to other hospitals using (as it was then) GPO telephone lines, and eventually, broadcasts were made to Weybridge, Walton, St Peter’s, Ellesmere and Ashford hospitals. There was also a link to Stompond Lane football ground, which enabled live 2nd half commentary on Walton and Hersham FC's home games. The first commentary was broadcast on 11 October 1970. At a later date the Hospital Radio Wey network was extended to Woking Victoria hospital. By 1971 Hospital Radio Wey had grown to 23 members who were presenting 30 hours of programmes a week. Programmes consisted of patient requests, collected by a Hospital Radio Wey (HRW) member visiting the wards. Each member would visit a specific ward and the requests would then be played at a specific time each week for each ward. There were also specialist music programmes such as classical music, country and western, big band and jazz. In the early years, most of the HRW members had day jobs and programmes were broadcast on weekday evenings and on Saturday and Sunday. BBC programmes were available for the patients during the times HRW was not broadcasting its own material. As the network increased, more members were recruited and an increased number of wards had dedicated request programmes. Some members used their experience gained from hospital radio to secure work in professional radio, which was being deregulated. With the introduction of commercial radio and BBC local radio, there came increasing job opportunities. Each Friday a special local news programme was compiled and broadcast. This programme was recorded and made available to another charity \\"Talking newspapers for the blind\\", who duplicated the content onto cassette tapes and distributed them to blind people in the area. Early in 1973 the DIY studio equipment was replaced by a custom built mixing console. The re-opening on Sunday 8 April 1973 featured a day of special programmes by guest presenters from BBC and commercial radio. Those participating were Tony Brandon, Noel Edmonds, Terry Wogan, Johnnie Walker, John Dunn and Keith Skues. One slogan used by HRW was \\"Bringing the outside to your bedsides.\\" Using equipment that had to be connected by telephone line, HRW members visited events in the catchment area served by the hospitals and provided reports and interviews from those events. These included hospital fetes, shopping centres, and the Byfleet Parish Day. If no telephone link was available, recordings were made and taken back to the studio to be played on air later. The cost of the landline links had been met by the hospital amenity fund but in 1977 the hospital announced that it could no longer pay for the links. The local press at the time picked up the story which made front page headlines. The outcome of the publicity benefitted HRW. Not only did the hospitals agree to continue to fund the transmission links, but one local councillor offered support to HRW through business connections and the Helping Hands charity. This secured the donation of a professional mixing desk, unused except for a demonstration in a marketing suite. Cash donations were also made. The station closed for three months to install the donated broadcast desk, together with other new equipment. Once complete, there was a grand re-opening day. With many guest personalities from the radio scene of the day, the new studio provided a stable platform for HRW to present its programmes. Another landmark came in 1978 when Hospital Radio Wey became a registered charity. Its registration number being 275620. The studio at Weybridge had become affectionately known as \\"the shoebox\\" due to its small size and shape and it was not possible for HRW to develop it further. In 1984, HRW was offered accommodation at St Peter’s Hospital and this presented an opportunity to expand beyond the cramped single room at Weybridge. The building that was offered had been the hospital’s telephone exchange and it needed considerable alterations to make it suitable for use as a broadcasting studio and record library. Plans were drawn up, and in 1985, the hospital works department appointed a contractor and supervised the building work, which cost £12,200. £5,000 of this was contributed by the hospitals, with HRW paying the remainder. HRW members undertook the decoration and fitting out at the premises, which offered space for two studios, a record library, a kitchen and a toilet. The plan was to install one brand new studio, and to be able to broadcast from the new premises so that we could transfer the existing studio kit from Weybridge to the new accommodation. Estimates for the new studio equipment amounted to nearly £7,500 with £2,700 being needed to refit the equipment being re-used from Weybridge into the second studio. A lot of fundraising needed to be done. HRW benefitted from the fact that the supply industry had started to market equipment specifically for non-professional use and Radio Wey was able to purchase one of the first off the shelf, mixing desks specifically aimed at its needs. With the transfer to St Peter’s complete, an official opening of the new studio complex was held with guest of honour Sir Cliff Richard. They were also joined on the day by Alan Dell, Adrian Juste, Adrian Love and Tony Brandon. Shortly after the move, things were changing in the way music was marketed and the CD was introduced. New equipment needed to be added to the studios so music in this format could be played. The record library also evolved to store the CD cases. To enhance its outside broadcast capacity, HRW invested in a new caravan. The events attended also offered fundraising opportunities. The van was fitted out specifically for Radio Wey use and gave excellent service until it was sold to another hospital radio organisation; a decision taken because so few members had cars with tow bars, needed to take it to events. Changes in the NHS also affected HRW. With the closure of smaller hospitals, the service to Ellesmere, Walton, Woking and eventually Weybridge ceased as these hospitals closed or were given new healthcare roles. This left HRW just serving Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals. Studio 1 at Radio Wey One of the programmes is the Sunday morning, \\"Good News\\" religious programme. The building of the new Accident & Emergency wing at St Peter’s included a new chapel to replace the one on The Ramp, which was scheduled to be demolished. During the construction, permanent wiring was installed above the ceiling to enable non-intrusive microphones to be installed. Radio Wey now began to broadcast a live service from the chapel on the first Sunday of each month and this continues today. Digital equipment for broadcast use continued to be developed. HRW adopted the use of a digital playout system known as \\"Myriad.\\" Music tracks could be stored on a computer and accessed by a keyboard or screen. One advantage was the space saved in the music library which had become full of vinyl records and CD discs. The development of Internet applications has also impacted on broadcasting. In 2007, HRW made its programmes available through its website. This made it possible for hospital staff to access the programmes and facilitated introduction of the service into nursing homes. Sports fans who were away from home also found it possible to keep in touch with the fortunes of local teams. Studio 2 at Radio Wey By around 2005, the equipment installed in the late 1980s was becoming time expired and difficult to maintain. HRW’s plans at that time were to get better premises and a new studio appeal was launched. Consultation with the hospital authorities began. Plans were drawn up for a replacement studio on the same site as the existing building. Planning permission was obtained. A lottery application to cover the construction costs of £100,000 was unsuccessful and the scheme could not proceed. Other options were considered but none could be turned into a practical affordable scheme. In 2007, a decision was taken to refit Studio 2 with programmes continuing to be broadcast from Studio 1. New studio furniture, mixing desk and other equipment was installed after redecoration. This was completed in September 2007. The new telephone connections included with the new equipment gave better facilities for the Saturday SportScene team which enabled better coverage from more grounds. The following year, the mixer in Studio 1 which had seen service since 1978 failed and that studio was then completely refitted to the same specification as Studio 2. Having two identical studios made is easier to train new presenters. In 2012, the volunteers at Ashford and St Peters Hospitals NHS Trust were awarded the Queen's Award for Voluntary Services and Hospital Radio Wey is part of this team In recent years, the station have had presenters who have retired or work shifts and this has enabled us to offer daytime programming in addition to evenings and weekends. What has made HRW the success it has been for the past 50 years has been the dedication and commitment of the members, all of whom are volunteers. There have been many over the period HRW has been operating – some have been with us a short while and some have never left. Some have used their training and experience to go on to careers in professional radio and television.  Programming  Radio Wey broadcasts 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with over 85 hours of live programming every week. This consists of a mix of request shows [where the presenters have visited the hospital wards and collected request details from the patients and staff], specialist music programmes; news programmes; speech based shows; classic comedy and sport. Radio Wey at the Festival of Light at Walton-on-Thames 2016 On Saturday afternoons, the SportScene team provides commentary on a local football match as well as reports from other local football and rugby matches. Some of the regular teams covered are Staines Town FC, Hampton & Richmond Borough FC, Woking FC, Dorking Wanderers FC, Bracknell Town FC, and Esher Rugby The station also works with the community at local events, providing public address, music and entertainment services. Recent events include the Black Cherry Fair and Goose Fair in Chertsey, the Pancake Race, Santa Fun Run and Christmas Parade in Staines upon Thames, Horsell Village Show, Ottershaw May Fair and the Heritage Day and the Festival of Light at Christmas, both in Walton on Thames.  Awards  Each year, the Hospital Broadcasting Association invites its member stations to submit examples and extracts of their programmes to be judged in various categories.

During World War II, she worked on aircraft assembly at the Naval Air Station Alameda. She was photographed operating a machine tool and this widely used photograph was thought to be an inspiration for the poster. Geraldine Hoff Doyle was initially credited as the subject but research by a professor at Seton Hall University set the record straight. After the war, she worked as a waitress in Palm Springs and married three times. When she died, aged 96 in 2018, she was survived by her son and six step-children. Early life upright Naomi Fern Parker was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921, as the third of eight children to Joseph Parker and Esther Leis. Her father was a mining engineer while her mother was a homemaker. The family moved across the country from New York to California, living in Alameda at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. She and her younger sister Ada went to work at the Naval Air station, where they were assigned to the machine shop for aircraft assembling duties. We Can Do It! The \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster appeared in a few factories in 1943. In 1942, Parker's photo was taken at a Pratt & Whitney vertical shaper and it appeared in local press including the Pittsburgh Press on July 5, 1942. The following year J. Howard Miller's \\"We Can Do It!\\" poster was one of a series that appeared in factories at Westinghouse in a worker morale campaign. Miller could have seen the picture of Parker, and it is presumed that the newspaper photo was the source of his image. In 2011, Parker Fraley was at a reunion held at the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park and there she spotted the 1942 photo of her operating a machine. She was surprised to find that the caption said that it was Geraldine Hoff Doyle and she wrote to the park to correct their mistake. They thanked her for telling them the correct name for the photo. Doyle had in innocence thought that the photo was of her and by extension she had decided that the poster was too. This mis-identification then became well-established as sources repeated it – an example of the Woozle effect. =Kimble investigation= Meanwhile, Seton Hall University professor James J. Kimble had become interested in the poster which was now an icon of the feminist movement. He tracked down the original photo and found that it was credited to \\"Naomi Parker\\" in 1942. Doyle was still at school and she had only worked at the plant for a few weeks. He found Naomi in 2015 to show her the photo and she still had the cutting from 1942. Kimble was certain that Naomi was the woman in the photo and considered her to be the strongest candidate to be the inspiration for the poster, but noted that Miller did not leave any writings which could identify his model. In February 2015, Kimble interviewed the Parker sisters, known as Naomi Fern Fraley and Ada Wyn Morford and aged 93 and 91 respectively, and found that they had known for five years about the incorrect identification of the photo, and had been rebuffed in their attempt to correct the historical record. Later life After the war, Parker worked as a waitress at The Doll House, a restaurant in Palm Springs, California. She was married three times, first to Joseph Blankenship (divorced), second to John Muhlig, ended with his death in 1971, and third to Charles Fraley (d. 1998), whom she married in 1979. In February 2017 she moved to the Longview, Washington, area, before moving into an assisted care home there later that year. Death On January 20, 2018, Parker died in Longview, Washington, at the age of 96. The following month, her life was celebrated on BBC Radio 4's obituary programme Last Word.
