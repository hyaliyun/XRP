It is sometimes described as the \\"sixth sense\\". Proprioception is mediated by proprioceptors, mechanosensory neurons located within muscles, tendons, and joints. There are multiple types of proprioceptors which are activated during distinct behaviors and encode distinct types of information: limb velocity and movement, load on a limb, and limb limits. Vertebrates and invertebrates have distinct but similar modes of encoding this information. The central nervous system integrates proprioception and other sensory systems, such as vision and the vestibular system, to create an overall representation of body position, movement, and acceleration. More recently proprioception has also been described in flowering land plants (angiosperms). System overview In vertebrates, limb velocity and movement (muscle length and the rate of change) are encoded by one group of sensory neurons (Type Ia sensory fiber) and another type encode static muscle length (Group II neurons). These two types of sensory neurons compose muscle spindles. There is a similar division of encoding in invertebrates; different subgroups of neurons of the Chordotonal organ encode limb position and velocity. To determine the load on a limb, vertebrates use sensory neurons in the Golgi tendon organs: type Ib afferents. These proprioceptors are activated at given muscle forces, which indicate the resistance that muscle is experiencing. Similarly, invertebrates have a mechanism to determine limb load: the Campaniform sensilla. These proprioceptors are active when a limb experiences resistance. A third role for proprioceptors is to determine when a joint is at a specific position. In vertebrates, this is accomplished by Ruffini endings and Pacinian corpuscles. These proprioceptors are activated when the joint is at a threshold, usually at the extremes of joint position. Invertebrates use hair plates to accomplish this; a row of bristles located along joints detect when the limb moves. =Reflexes= The sense of proprioception is ubiquitous across mobile animals and is essential for the motor coordination of the body. Proprioceptors can form reflex circuits with motor neurons to provide rapid feedback about body and limb position. These mechanosensory circuits are important for flexibly maintaining posture and balance, especially during locomotion. For example, consider the stretch reflex, in which stretch across a muscle is detected by a sensory receptor (e.g., muscle spindle, chordotonal neurons), which activates a motor neuron to induce muscle contraction and oppose the stretch. During locomotion, sensory neurons can reverse their activity when stretched, to promote rather than oppose movement. =Conscious and non-conscious= In humans, a distinction is made between conscious proprioception and non- conscious proprioception: * Conscious proprioception is communicated by the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway to the cerebrum. * Non-conscious proprioception is communicated primarily via the dorsal spinocerebellar tract and ventral spinocerebellar tract, to the cerebellum. * A non-conscious reaction is seen in the human proprioceptive reflex, or righting reflex‚Äîin the event that the body tilts in any direction, the person will cock their head back to level the eyes against the horizon. This is seen even in infants as soon as they gain control of their neck muscles. This control comes from the cerebellum, the part of the brain affecting balance.  Mechanisms  Proprioception is mediated by mechanically sensitive proprioceptor neurons distributed throughout an animal's body. Most vertebrates possess three basic types of proprioceptors: muscle spindles, which are embedded in skeletal muscle fibers, Golgi tendon organs, which lie at the interface of muscles and tendons, and joint receptors, which are low-threshold mechanoreceptors embedded in joint capsules. Many invertebrates, such as insects, also possess three basic proprioceptor types with analogous functional properties: chordotonal neurons, campaniform sensilla, and hair plates. The initiation of proprioception is the activation of a proprioreceptor in the periphery. The proprioceptive sense is believed to be composed of information from sensory neurons located in the inner ear (motion and orientation) and in the stretch receptors located in the muscles and the joint-supporting ligaments (stance). There are specific nerve receptors for this form of perception termed \\"proprioreceptors\\", just as there are specific receptors for pressure, light, temperature, sound, and other sensory experiences. Proprioreceptors are sometimes known as adequate stimuli receptors. Members of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels have been found to be important for proprioception in fruit flies, nematode worms, African clawed frogs, and zebrafish. PIEZO2, a nonselective cation channel, has been shown to underlie the mechanosensitivity of proprioceptors in mice. Humans with loss-of-function mutations in the PIEZO2 gene exhibit specific deficits in joint proprioception, as well as vibration and touch discrimination, suggesting that the PIEZO2 channel is essential for mechanosensitivity in some proprioceptors and low-threshold mechanoreceptors. Although it was known that finger kinesthesia relies on skin sensation, recent research has found that kinesthesia-based haptic perception relies strongly on the forces experienced during touch. This research allows the creation of \\"virtual\\", illusory haptic shapes with different perceived qualities.the MIT Technology Review article \\"The Cutting Edge of Haptics\\"  Anatomy  Proprioception of the head stems from the muscles innervated by the trigeminal nerve, where the GSA fibers pass without synapsing in the trigeminal ganglion (first-order sensory neuron), reaching the mesencephalic tract and the mesencephalic nucleus of trigeminal nerve.  Function = Stability = An important role for proprioception is to allow an animal to stabilize itself against perturbations. For instance, for a person to walk or stand upright, they must continuously monitor their posture and adjust muscle activity as needed to provide balance. Similarly, when walking on unfamiliar terrain or even tripping, the person must adjust the output of their muscles quickly based on estimated limb position and velocity. Proprioceptor reflex circuits are thought to play an important role to allow fast and unconscious execution of these behaviors, To make control of these behaviors efficient, proprioceptors are also thought to regulate reciprocal inhibition in muscles, leading to agonist-antagonist muscle pairs. = Planning and refining movements = When planning complex movements such as reaching or grooming, animals must consider the current position and velocity of their limb and use it to adjust dynamics to target a final position. If the animal's estimate of their limb's initial position is wrong, this can lead to a deficiency in the movement. Furthermore, proprioception is crucial in refining the movement if it deviates from the trajectory. Development In adult Drosophila, each proprioceptor class arises from a specific cell lineage (i.e. each chordotonal neuron is from the chordotonal neuron lineage, although multiple lineages give rise to sensory bristles). After the last cell division, proprioceptors send out axons toward the central nervous system and are guided by hormonal gradients to reach stereotyped synapses. Jan, Y. N. and Jan, L. Y. (1993). The peripheral nervous system. In: The Development of Drosophila melanogaster (ed. Bate, M and Arias, A. M.), pp 1207-1244. New York, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. The mechanisms underlying axon guidance are similar across invertebrates and vertebrates. In mammals with longer gestation periods, muscle spindles are fully formed at birth. Muscle spindles continue to grow throughout post-natal development as muscles grow. Maier, A., 1997. Development and regeneration of muscle spindles in mammals and birds. The International journal of developmental biology, 41(1), pp.1-17.  Mathematical models  Proprioceptors transfer the mechanical state of the body into patterns of neural activity. This transfer can be modeled mathematically, for example to better understand the internal workings of a proprioceptor or to provide more realistic feedback in neuromechanical simulations. A number of different proprioceptor models of varying degrees of complexity have been developed. They range from simple phenomenological models to complex structural models, in which the mathematical elements correspond to anatomical features of the proprioceptor. The focus has been on muscle spindles, but Golgi tendon organs and insects hair plates have been modeled too. = Muscle spindles = Poppelle and Bowman used linear system theory to model mammalian muscle spindles. They obtained a set of de-efferented muscle spindles, measured their response to a series of sinusoidal and step function stretches, and fit a transfer function to the spike rate. They found that the following Laplace transfer function describes the responses of the primary sensory fibers: H(s) = K_1 frac{s(s+0.44)(s+11.3)(s+44)}{(s + 0.04)(s+0.816)} The following equation describes the response of secondary sensory fibers: H(s) = K_2 frac{(s+0.44)(s+11.3)}{s+0.816} More recently, Blum et al showed that the muscle spindle firing rate is modeled better as tracking the force of the muscle, rather than the length. Furthermore, muscle spindle firing rates show history dependence which cannot be modeled by a linear time-invariant system model. Clinical relevance=Impairment= Temporary loss or impairment of proprioception may happen periodically during growth, mostly during adolescence. Growth that might also influence this would be large increases or drops in bodyweight/size due to fluctuations of fat (liposuction, rapid fat loss or gain) and/or muscle content (bodybuilding, anabolic steroids, catabolisis/starvation). It can also occur in those that gain new levels of flexibility, stretching, and contortion. A limb's being in a new range of motion never experienced (or at least, not for a long time since youth perhaps) can disrupt one's sense of location of that limb. Possible experiences include suddenly feeling that feet or legs are missing from one's mental self-image; needing to look down at one's limbs to be sure they are still there; and falling down while walking, especially when attention is focused upon something other than the act of walking. Proprioception is occasionally impaired spontaneously, especially when one is tired. Similar effects can be felt during the hypnagogic state of consciousness, during the onset of sleep. One's body may feel too large or too small, or parts of the body may feel distorted in size. Similar effects can sometimes occur during epilepsy or migraine auras. These effects are presumed to arise from abnormal stimulation of the part of the parietal cortex of the brain involved with integrating information from different parts of the body. Proprioceptive illusions can also be induced, such as the Pinocchio illusion. The proprioceptive sense is often unnoticed because humans will adapt to a continuously present stimulus; this is called habituation, desensitization, or adaptation. The effect is that proprioceptive sensory impressions disappear, just as a scent can disappear over time. One practical advantage of this is that unnoticed actions or sensation continue in the background while an individual's attention can move to another concern. The Alexander Technique addresses these unconscious elements by bringing attention to them and practicing a new movement with focus on how it feels to move in the new way. People who have a limb amputated may still have a confused sense of that limb's existence on their body, known as phantom limb syndrome. Phantom sensations can occur as passive proprioceptive sensations of the limb's presence, or more active sensations such as perceived movement, pressure, pain, itching, or temperature. There are a variety of theories concerning the etiology of phantom limb sensations and experience. One is the concept of \\"proprioceptive memory\\", which argues that the brain retains a memory of specific limb positions and that after amputation there is a conflict between the visual system, which actually sees that the limb is missing, and the memory system which remembers the limb as a functioning part of the body. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, such as after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain), or removal of an eye (phantom eye syndrome). Temporary impairment of proprioception has also been known to occur from an overdose of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine and pyridoxamine). Most of the impaired function returns to normal shortly after the amount of the vitamin in the body returns to a level that is closer to that of the physiological norm. Impairment can also be caused by cytotoxic factors such as chemotherapy. It has been proposed that even common tinnitus and the attendant hearing frequency-gaps masked by the perceived sounds may cause erroneous proprioceptive information to the balance and comprehension centers of the brain, precipitating mild confusion. Proprioception is permanently impaired in patients that suffer from joint hypermobility or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (a genetic condition that results in weak connective tissue throughout the body). It can also be permanently impaired from viral infections as reported by Sacks. The catastrophic effect of major proprioceptive loss is reviewed by Robles-De-La-Torre (2006). Proprioception is also permanently impaired in physiological aging (presbypropria). Parkinson's disease is characterized by a decline in motor function as a result of neurodegeneration. It is likely that some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are in part related to disrupted proprioception. Whether this symptom is caused by degeneration of proprioceptors in the periphery or disrupted signaling in the brain or spinal cord is an open question. =Diagnosis= \\"Joint position matching\\" is an established protocol for measuring proprioception, and joint position sense specifically, without the aid of visual or vestibular information. During such tasks, individuals are blindfolded while a joint is moved to a specific angle for a given period of time, returned to neutral, and the subjects are asked to replicate the specified angle. Measured by constant and absolute errors, ability to accurately identify joint angles over a series of conditions is the most accurate means of determining proprioceptive acuity in isolation to date. Recent investigations have shown that hand dominance, participant age, active versus passive matching, and presentation time of the angle can all affect performance on joint position matching tasks. Joint position matching has been used in clinical settings in both the upper and lower extremities. Proprioception is tested by American police officers using the field sobriety testing to check for alcohol intoxication. The subject is required to touch his or her nose with eyes closed; people with normal proprioception may make an error of no more than , while people suffering from impaired proprioception (a symptom of moderate to severe alcohol intoxication) fail this test due to difficulty locating their limbs in space relative to their noses. =Training= Proprioception is what allows someone to learn to walk in complete darkness without losing balance. During the learning of any new skill, sport, or art, it is usually necessary to become familiar with some proprioceptive tasks specific to that activity. Without the appropriate integration of proprioceptive input, an artist would not be able to brush paint onto a canvas without looking at the hand as it moved the brush over the canvas; it would be impossible to drive an automobile because a motorist would not be able to steer or use the pedals while looking at the road ahead; a person could not touch type or perform ballet; and people would not even be able to walk without watching where they put their feet. Oliver Sacks reported the case of a young woman who lost her proprioception due to a viral infection of her spinal cord.Sacks, O.. \\"The Disembodied Lady\\", in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat and his autobiographical case study A Leg to Stand On. At first she could not move properly at all or even control her tone of voice (as voice modulation is primarily proprioceptive). Later she relearned by using her sight (watching her feet) and inner ear only for movement while using hearing to judge voice modulation. She eventually acquired a stiff and slow movement and nearly normal speech, which is believed to be the best possible in the absence of this sense. She could not judge effort involved in picking up objects and would grip them painfully to be sure she did not drop them. Lower limb proprioceptive work The proprioceptive sense can be sharpened through study of many disciplines. Examples are the Feldenkrais method and the Alexander Technique. Juggling trains reaction time, spatial location, and efficient movement. Standing on a wobble board or balance board is often used to retrain or increase proprioception abilities, particularly as physical therapy for ankle or knee injuries. Slacklining is another method to increase proprioception. Standing on one leg (stork standing) and various other body- position challenges are also used in such disciplines as yoga, Wing Chun and tai chi. The vestibular system of the inner ear, vision and proprioception are the main three requirements for balance. Moreover, there are specific devices designed for proprioception training, such as the exercise ball, which works on balancing the abdominal and back muscles. History of study The position-movement sensation was originally described in 1557 by Julius Caesar Scaliger as a \\"sense of locomotion\\". Much later, in 1826, Charles Bell expounded the idea of a \\"muscle sense\\", which is credited as one of the first descriptions of physiologic feedback mechanisms. Bell's idea was that commands are carried from the brain to the muscles, and that reports on the muscle's condition would be sent in the reverse direction. In 1847 the London neurologist Robert Todd highlighted important differences in the anterolateral and posterior columns of the spinal cord, and suggested that the latter were involved in the coordination of movement and balance. At around the same time, Moritz Heinrich Romberg, a Berlin neurologist, was describing unsteadiness made worse by eye closure or darkness, now known as the eponymous Romberg's sign, once synonymous with tabes dorsalis, that became recognised as common to all proprioceptive disorders of the legs. Later, in 1880, Henry Charlton Bastian suggested \\"kinaesthesia\\" instead of \\"muscle sense\\" on the basis that some of the afferent information (back to the brain) comes from other structures, including tendons, joints, and skin. In 1889, Alfred Goldscheider suggested a classification of kinaesthesia into three types: muscle, tendon, and articular sensitivity. In 1906, Charles Scott Sherrington published a landmark work that introduced the terms \\"proprioception\\", \\"interoception\\", and \\"exteroception\\".Sherrington, C.S.(1906). The Integrative Action of the Nervous System. NewHaven, CT:YaleUniversityPress. The \\"exteroceptors\\" are the organs that provide information originating outside the body, such as the eyes, ears, mouth, and skin. The interoceptors provide information about the internal organs, and the \\"proprioceptors\\" provide information about movement derived from muscular, tendon, and articular sources. Using Sherrington's system, physiologists and anatomists search for specialised nerve endings that transmit mechanical data on joint capsule, tendon and muscle tension (such as Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles), which play a large role in proprioception. Primary endings of muscle spindles \\"respond to the size of a muscle length change and its speed\\" and \\"contribute both to the sense of limb position and movement\\". Secondary endings of muscle spindles detect changes in muscle length, and thus supply information regarding only the sense of position. Essentially, muscle spindles are stretch receptors. It has been accepted that cutaneous receptors also contribute directly to proprioception by providing \\"accurate perceptual information about joint position and movement\\", and this knowledge is combined with information from the muscle spindles. =Etymology= Proprioception is from Latin proprius, meaning \\"one's own\\", \\"individual\\", and capio, capere, to take or grasp. Thus to grasp one's own position in space, including the position of the limbs in relation to each other and the body as a whole. The word kinesthesia or kin√¶sthesia (kinesthetic sense) refers to movement sense, but has been used inconsistently to refer either to proprioception alone or to the brain's integration of proprioceptive and vestibular inputs. Kinesthesia is a modern medical term composed of elements from Greek; kinein \\"to set in motion; to move\\" (from PIE root *keie- \\"to set in motion\\") + aisthesis \\"perception, feeling\\" (from PIE root *au- \\"to perceive\\") + Greek abstract noun ending -ia (corresponds to English -hood e.g. motherhood).  Plants  Terrestrial plants control the orientation of their primary growth through the sensing of several vectorial stimuli such as the light gradient or the gravitational acceleration. This control has been called tropism. However, a quantitative study of shoot gravitropism demonstrated that, when a plant is tilted, it cannot recover a steady erected posture under the sole driving of the sensing of its angular deflection versus gravity. An additional control through the continuous sensing of its curvature by the organ and the subsequent driving an active straightening process are required. Being a sensing by the plant of the relative configuration of its parts, it has been called proprioception. This dual sensing and control by gravisensing and proprioception has been formalized into a unifying mathematical model simulating the complete driving of the gravitropic movement. This model has been validated on 11 species sampling the phylogeny of land angiosperms, and on organs of very contrasted sizes, ranging from the small germination of wheat (coleoptile) to the trunk of poplar trees. This model also shows that the entire gravitropic dynamics is controlled by a single dimensionless number called the \\"Balance Number\\", and defined as the ratio between the sensitivity to the inclination angle versus gravity and the proprioceptive sensitivity. This model has been extended to account for the effects of the passive bending of the organ under its self- weight, suggesting that proprioception is active even in very compliant stems, although they may not be able to efficiently straighten depending on their elastic deformation under the gravitational pull. Further studies have shown that the cellular mechanism of proprioception in plants involves myosin and actin, and seems to occur in specialized cells. Proprioception was then found to be involved in other tropisms and to be central also to the control of nutation These results change the view we have on plant sensitivity. They are also providing concepts and tools for the breeding of crops that are resilient to lodging, and of trees with straight trunks and homogeneous wood quality. The discovery of proprioception in plants has generated an interest in the popular science and generalist media. This is because this discovery questions a long-lasting a priori that we have on plants. In some cases this has led to a shift between proprioception and self-awareness or self-consciousness. There is no scientific ground for such a semantic shift. Indeed, even in animals, proprioception can be unconscious; so it is thought to be in plants.

A blue diamond with the same shape, size, and color as the Hope Diamond was recorded in Eliason's possession in September 1812, the earliest point when the history of the Hope Diamond can be definitively fixed. John Francillon wrote a memorandum describing the large superfine blue diamond. It is often pointed out that this date was almost exactly 20 years after the theft of the French Blue, just as the statute of limitations for the crime had expired. Eliason's diamond may have been acquired by King George IV of the United Kingdom. There is no record of the ownership in the Royal Archives at Windsor, but some secondary evidence exists in the form of contemporary writings and artwork, and George IV tended to commingle the state property of the Royal Jewels with family heirlooms and his own personal property. It is thought that Francis Beaulieu, who came from Marseilles to London, arranged to sell the diamond to Eliason. Beaulieu fell terribly ill from jail fever and died in a poor humble lodging. When Eliason went round to pay over the money Beaulieu was dead and the money never changed hands. Eliason killed himself some months afterwards, but before he did so he sold the diamond (this was in about 1830) to Henry Thomas Hope of Deepdene, Surrey.Susanne Steinem Patch, Blue Mystery: The Story of the Hope Diamond (Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1976) 18.

Shapiro (born February 15, 1913) is an American businessman and philanthropist. In 1939 he founded Kay Windsor, Inc. in New Bedford, Massachusetts and built it into one of the largest women's clothing companies in the country. He is its former president and chairman of the board and was director of VF Corporation, which acquired Kay Windsor in 1971; he retired five years later. Philanthropy In 1961 The Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family Foundation was established. It supports community-based nonprofits focused on improving the lives of the disabled, disadvantaged, and disenfranchised. Its support has bolstered the work of about 65 organizations working in areas such as youth arts, adult education, domestic violence, and assistive technology for persons with disabilities. In December 2008, the Foundation lost about $145 million in Bernard Madoff‚Äôs Ponzi scheme. Shapiro and his wife, Ruth became Brandeis University benefactors in 1950. Ruth joined the University's National Women's Committee in 1948. Carl served as a Brandeis Fellow from 1977‚Äì79, and as a Trustee from 1979 to 1988, when he became a Trustee emeritus. They gave $25 million, the largest gift in Brandeis history, to build the 2003 Carl and Ruth Shapiro Campus Center and funded the admissions center and endowed a chair in international finance held by Peter Petri, dean of the International Business School (formerly the Graduate School of International Economics and Finance). The Shapiros also funded the Carl and Ruth Shapiro Center for Library Technology and Journals in the Farber Library on campus. In January 2003 Shapiro received Brandeis' highest honor, an honorary degree, citing cites an \\"unshakable commitment to making the world a better place\\". Shapiro founded the Carl J. Shapiro Institute for Education and Research at Harvard Medical School, Boston Medical Center, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. In 2005 The Shapiros donated $25 million to Brigham and Women's Hospital, for the world's most advanced cardiovascular care facility, the Carl J. and Ruth Shapiro Cardiovascular Center, designed to support one of the world‚Äôs leading teams of cardiovascular experts. In 2008 they also pledged $27 million to Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women‚Äôs Cancer Center to substantially upgrade and expand its facilities for cancer care services. Other contributions include: Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Wellesley College, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Kravis Center for the Performing Arts, the Norton Museum of Art, and the Palm Beach Opera, among other institutions. Bernard Madoff Shapiro and his foundation reportedly lost some $550 million from Bernie Madoff, who received $250 million around December 1, 2008 from Shapiro, then one of Madoff's oldest friends and one of his biggest financial backers. Shapiro's and Jaffe's accounts with Madoff were managed by Paul J. Konigsberg, senior tax partner at Konigsberg Wolf & Company, New York City. Konigsberg has been criminally indicted for working closely with Madoff to phony up investment records for Konigsberg's large clients to achieve targeted gains and tax losses.[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/09/26/longtime-madoff-accountant-is- arrested/?_r=0 \\"Accountant Who Worked With Madoff for Years Is Indicted in Fraud\\", The New York Times, September 26, 2013). Regulators are looking into a brokerage firm, Cohmad Securities (taken from the names \\"Cohn\\" and \\"Madoff\\"), which is largely owned by Maurice Cohn and his daughter Marcia, President and Chief Compliance Officer, of whom Madoff shares 10‚Äì20 percent ownership stakes, and Madoff's firm's address in New York City. Peter Madoff, brother of Bernard, owns less than one share. Cohmad vice president Robert Jaffe's ownership of Cohmad was less than 5 percent.\\"Cohmad, Jaffe Face Closer Look\\", The Wall Street Journal (January 14, 2009) =Robert Jaffe= Jaffe \\"worked the Palm Beach, Florida circuit, and attracted many Palm Beach Country Club members as investors\\". Jaffe claimed he had received a commission of 1% to 2% from an investor's first profit after he guided their money to Madoff. Jaffe paid commissions to financial advisers who steered cash to Madoff's fund. On January 14, 2009 William Galvin, Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who is in charge of the state's securities issues, filed suit against Jaffe, who promoted Madoff's funds to wealthy investors in Massachusetts and Florida. On February 4, compelled to testify, Jaffe invoked his Fifth Amendment right. On February 11, 2009, Galvin filed a complaint seeking to revoke the Massachusetts license of Cohmad Securities Corp., an accounting of all Massachusetts investors Cohmad referred to Madoff‚Äôs company, all the fees it earned doing so (more than $67 million), and a fine. =Financial losses= On May 20, 2009 the family foundation of Carl Shapiro amended its taxes to reflect more than $140 million in losses in 2005. It reflected a 74 percent drop in income, to $1.2 million. The Foundation hired Caras and Shulman, P.C. for accounting purposes. Their previous accounting firm, Konigsberg, Wolf & Co., was the firm Madoff recommended to many clients. =Sanctions= Shapiro is among a group of investors who have experienced potential losses between $100 million and $1 billion in the Bernard Madoff hedge fund scheme. It has been reported that a criminal investigation has commenced regarding his alleged complicity in the Madoff affair. In 2010, Shapiro and various related people and entities agreed to forfeit $625 million to the United States, all of which will be made available to the victims of the fraudulent investment advisory business which was owned and operated by Bernard L. Madoff. Since at least the late 1960s, Shapiro was an investor in Madoff holding an account in his own name and controlling accounts held by various related individuals and entities. Over the course of his approximately 40-year relationship with Madoff and BLMIS, Shapiro invested hundreds of millions of dollars into his BLMIS accounts, but withdrew hundreds of millions more. To resolve any and all potential civil claims by the government against the Shapiro family, the family agreed to forfeit $625 million to the government‚Äîan amount in excess of Shapiro and his wife‚Äôs current net worth, as well as in excess of the fictitious profits that Shapiro and his wife took out of BLMIS. The settlement contains no finding or admission of fault against Shapiro or his family; the settlement does not, however, release any party from criminal liability. Personal life Shapiro was married for 73 years to Ruth Gordon, who was also Jewish, until her death in 2012; they had three daughters: Rhonda Shapiro Zinner, Ellen Shapiro Jaffe and Linda Shapiro Waintrup.Palm Beach Daily News: \\"PB, Boston philanthropist Ruth Shapiro dies\\", Shannon Donnelly, Palm Beach Daily News, 15 October 2012 Since 2009 Shapiro divides his time between Boston and Palm Beach.

The Tada family homesteadDesignated as a cultural asset of Nagano Prefecture in 1960. was surrounded by moats and mounds, which suggests the power and position they held. Traditionally the head of the family became the headman of Nakagaya village, and Kasuke took over the position when his father retired. He was an educated man, who was said to have been influenced by the Wang Yangming schoolIts basic theory is \\"Knowledge and action are inextricably linked.\\" of Neo-Confucianism.TANAKA, J≈çky≈ç Gimin Ikki, pp.83-84 In around 1680, he was fired as village head when authorities decided that he was too lenient on peasants.TSUKADA Masakimi, Gimin Shiro ni Sakebu (Gimin Shouts at the Castle), Shinky≈ç Shuppan-bu, 1986, p.20 He had a wife named Otami,Her real name was Tami.

At the time of the uprising, the first-born son named Dempachi was twelve years old, and the second son named Sanz≈ç was eight.Some people say that he was ten. (Both of them were caught and executed, though neither of them had taken part in the incident.) In addition, Kasuke had an unmarried younger brother named Hikonoj≈ç. (He took part in the uprising, and was executed. Some people believe that he was engaged to Oshyun, the sixteen-year-old girl who took part in the uprising. She was also executed.It was rare for a girl to be executed for such a crime.) J≈çky≈ç Uprising Tada Kasuke's severed head is buried here. In 1686, the domain government of Matsumoto raised taxes to a very high level. But Azumidaira had been hit by crop failure, and the tax rise was exorbitant.TSUKADA, Gimin Shiro ni Sakebu, pp.20-21 In the fall of that year, Tada Kasuke and a number of farmers‚Äô leadersTANAKA, J≈çky≈ç Gimin Ikki, p.76 gathered at a local shrine, called Kumano Jinja (Kumano Shrine), and held a series of meetings. They decided to appeal to the magistrate‚Äôs office in Matsumoto, though they fully understood that they were risking their lives in doing so. They wrote a letter of appeal of five articles, in which they asked for lowered taxes. On October 14, they hand delivered the letter to the magistrate‚Äôs office outside Matsumoto Castle. Tada Kasuke and his followers expected to carry out this mission peacefully. But when word spread that they were appealing, thousands of peasants gathered at Matsumoto Castle. (One scholar who disagrees with this notion claims that the leaders did intend to perpetrate an uprising.HOSAKA Satoru, Hyakush≈ç Ikki to Sono Sah≈ç (Farmers' Uprising and Its Manners), Yoshikawa K≈çbunkan, 2002, p.110) Some peasants stormed shops, others committed robbery, and still others attacked wealthy merchants.TANAKA, J≈çky≈ç Gimin Ikki, p.124 The domain lord, Mizuno Tadanao, was away in Edo at the time, and executives of the domain government had to deal with the situation themselves. After all, the tax rise in question had obviously been decided by the executives without consulting the lord. In order to settle the incident, the executives at Matsumoto Castle agreed to grant the farmers their wishes. On October 18, five executives signed documents promising that the taxes would be lowered. It seemed a peaceful end to a stormy incident. But a month later, Kasuke and his followers were arrested and the documents signed by the executives were confiscated. The farmers were cheated by the authorities. Without trial, twenty-eight farmers were executed on November 22 (or Jan.5, 1687 by the solar calendar). Kasuke's last words were a passionate outcry for lowered taxes. The executions were witnessed by hundreds of citizens, which was the custom of those days. The scene of Kasuke's last moment made an enormous impact on the people. Kasuke shrine Tada Kasuke's gravestone The stone pagoda in Nir√© commemorating the 50th anniversary of the uprising Several decades passed before people could openly commemorate and appreciate Tada Kasuke and others.MIYAZAWA Hisanori, J≈çky≈ç Gimin Kensh≈ç no Sokuseki (Tracing the History of Commemoration of the J≈çky≈ç Gimin), J≈çky≈ç Gimin-sha H≈çsank≈ç, 2009, p.1 For one thing, while the domain lord's family, the Mizuno clan, was ruling the Matsumoto Domain, the executed farmers were deemed as rebels. And then in 1725 the lord of the Mizunos at the time was dethroned after a dishonorable incident which he perpetrated at Edo Castle. The Toda clan took over the Matsumoto Domain the following year. The first evidence of the commemoration of Kasuke, or GiminStarts with a hard pronunciation like \\"Gettysburg Address\\" (martyr, in the non-religious sense) as he was referred to, was a household altar dedicated to Kasuke and other executed members of the Tadas founded on the grounds of the Tada homestead in 1735. At around the same time, a stone pagoda inscribed with Buddhist scripture was erected to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the uprising. The stone (140 cm tall and 75 cm wide) stands in Nir√©, where Kasuke's right arm, Oana Zembei, had governed. Kasuke was also given a kaimy≈ç (afterlife name) soon after his death. The meaning of the kaimy≈ç clearly shows how Kasuke was honored as a selfless person. The name was inscribed on his gravestone when it was erected in the Tada family cemetery many years later. On the part of the Mizuno clan, they suffered a number of mishaps after the uprising. The final blow was the dethronement of Mizuno Tadatsune, Mizuno Tadanao's grandson. Fearing that those unfortunate incidents might be the karmic backlash of Kasuke's passion, the Mizuno family had a statue of Kasuke sculptured and reverently placed it inside the homestead. In 1786 the household altar honoring Kasuke and others was renovated to observe the centennial anniversary of the uprising. A hundred years later in the Meiji period, the altar was moved out of the Tada homestead to a new site nearby and was expanded to a shrine. Kasuke's followers who had been executed were also enshrined there in 1880 to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary. This is the origin of Kasuke shrine. Kasuke shrine to J≈çky≈ç Gimin shrine J≈çky≈ç Gimin shrine Tada Kasuke and the J≈çky≈ç Uprising were buried in oblivion before the Jiy≈´-Minken Undo (Freedom and People's Rights Movement) raged nationwide in the 1870s and 1880s during the Meiji period. Matsuzawa Ky≈´saku from Azumidaira featured Tada Kasuke in his column in the newspaper, and went on to dramatize the story.NAKAJIMA Hiroaki, Tamp≈ç \\"Azumino\\" (Investigating Azumino), Ky≈çdo Shuppan-sha, 1997, p.77 Matsuzawa perceived J≈çky≈ç Uprising as a model of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. Because he understood that what Kasuke had struggled for was the right to life, though there was no such concept as human rights two hundred years before. In 1898 the sculpture of Kasuke, along with some money, was donated to Kasuke shrine by the Mizuno family. The sculpture has been an object of worship ever since. The interesting thing about it is that Mizuno Tadanao was enshrined there on this occasion. The reason for his enshrinementSome have argued that Mizuno Tadanao's enshrinement helped increase the prestige of Kasuke shrine. is believed to be that the passage of two hundred years had assuaged the grief and bitterness on the part of the descendants of Kasuke and his followers. Besides, Mizuno Tadanao was widely believed to have been the victim himself in that he had been kept in the dark during and after the uprising. (Obviously, the lord consented to the executions of the farmers without the knowledge of the tax rise that had triggered the uprising.) The real culprits were the executives at Matsumoto Castle and the petty officials who were in charge of collecting taxes. The reasoning behind this was not very common, but not unheard of. In 1960 Kasuke shrine was granted the status of religious institution as J≈çky≈ç Gimin-sha (J≈çky≈ç Gimin shrine) by the Association of Shinto Shrines. The tercentennial and the J≈çky≈ç Gimin Memorial Museum In 1986 the tercentennial anniversary of the uprising was observed with much enthusiasm. The nearest railroad station to J≈çky≈ç Gimin-sha is Nakagaya Station on ≈åito Line. The post-house of the station was remodeled after the shrine. A number of books were published and cassette tapes made about the uprising. There was a surge in public sentiment of desire for a memorial museum around this time. In 1992, Azumino people founded a memorial museum in honor of the uprising. It was built right across the street from J≈çky≈ç Gimin-sha. The museum is called J≈çky≈ç Gimin Memorial Museum. Two plaques stand on each side of the main entrance to the museum. One is inscribed with the 11th and 12th articles of the Constitution of Japan. The other is inscribed with the first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The inscriptions on the two plaques are both in Japanese and English, which clearly shows a global perspective of the founding fathers of the museum.

Like Windows 2.0, the 286 edition would run on 8086 hardware, only without HMA support. A few PC vendors shipped Windows/286 with 8086 hardware; an example was IBM's PS/2 Model 25, which included Windows/286, resulting in some customer confusion. Windows 2.11 On March 13, 1989, Windows 2.11 was released in Windows/286 and Windows/386 editions, with some minor changes in memory management, AppleTalk support and faster printing and updated printer drivers. Windows 2.11 was superseded by Windows 3.0 in May 1990, but supported by Microsoft for twelve years, until December 31, 2001.  Windows 3.0  A successor to Windows 2.1x, Windows 3.0, was released on May 22, 1990 and the latest release, 3.00a was released in October 1991. Microsoft had intended to make Windows 3.0 appealing to the public in general. The company's \\"Entry Team\\", assigned to that task, was concerned that the public might perceive it to be no more than a tool for large enterprises, due to the software's high system requirements. Major game publishers did not see it as a potential game platform, instead sticking to DOS.

An audition is a sample performance by an actor, singer, musician, dancer or other performer. It typically involves the performer displaying their talent through a previously memorized and rehearsed solo piece or by performing a work or piece given to the performer at the audition or shortly before. In some cases, such as with a model or acrobat, the individual may be asked to demonstrate a range of professional skills. Actors may be asked to present a monologue. Singers will perform a song in a popular music context or an aria in a Classical context. A dancer will present a routine in a specific style, such as ballet, tap dance or hip-hop, or show his or her ability to quickly learn a choreographed dance piece. The audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals select performers, which is in some ways analogous to a job interview in the regular job market. In an audition, the employer is testing the ability of the applicant to meet the needs of the job and assess how well the individual will take directions and deal with changes. After some auditions, after the performer has demonstrated their abilities in a given performance style, the audition panel may ask a few questions that resemble those used in standard job interviews (e.g., regarding availability). Auditions are required for many reasons in the performing arts world. Often, employing companies or groups use auditions to select performers for upcoming shows or productions. An audition for a performing opportunity may be for a single performance (e.g., doing a monologue at a comedy club), for a series or season of performances (a season of a Broadway play), or for permanent employment with the performing organization (e.g., an orchestra or dance troupe). Auditions for performing opportunities may be for amateur, school, or community organizations, in which case the performers will typically not be paid. As well, auditions are used to select or screen candidates for entry to training programs (ballet school or circus school); university programs (B.Mus, M.Mus, MFA in Theater); performance-related scholarships and grants; or to be considered for representation by a talent agency or individual agent. Actors For actors, monologues and speeches are the \\"calling card\\" that they use to demonstrate their skills to casting directors. For actors in theater, film, and TV, the \\"audition is a systematic process in which industry professionals make final casting decisions. Industry professionals may consist of casting directors, producers, directors or agency representatives\\". In film and television, the audition is called a screen test, and it is filmed so that the casting director or director can see how the actor appears on screen. Auditions are advertised in major media outlets (such as newspaper or radio), industry magazines and newsletters (e.g., auditions for musicians are advertised in the American Federation of Musicians newsletter), audition websites, and through a talent/casting agencies. Some performers hire an agent, to be able to draw on the agent's connections with casting directors and performing arts companies. However, the agent will take a cut (often 10‚Äì20%) of the performer's earnings. Although an actor's talents comprise crucial criteria in the casting process, an almost equal amount of attention is given to an actor's \\"type\\", (a combination of personality, looks and general casting intuition) as required for a particular production. Actors who are selecting an audition piece may select a monologue by a character who is close to their own age. They may wear neutral clothing that allows freedom of movement. Auditionees may avoid going over the stated time limit. By convention, some actors choose to not direct their speech to the audition panel if they are doing an on-stage audition. In some cases, the audition panel may request that the auditionee interacts with them (e.g., a director may ask the actor to speak the lines while looking directly at the director). An actor who is doing an audition may warm up before the audition, like an athlete would, although with an actor, a warm up might include vocal exercises in addition to stretching. Just as with any interview outside of the performing arts world, an auditionee may dress well. Even if the auditionee does not have expensive clothing, simple clothing may be acceptable if it is clean and of good quality. Auditionees know casting directors are also considering \\"whether or not the actor will be easy to work with, that they know what they are doing and can take direction well\\". Audition pieces are not always from the show the actor is being considered for; an actor wishing to be cast in Hamlet may not do a monologue from that play. Most performers do have a range of audition pieces and select something appropriate; an actor auditioning for Hamlet would have a dramatic Shakespearean monologue ready, and not perform a monologue from an Oscar Wilde comedy, or a contemporary playwright. Some auditions involve cold reading, or performing a script that the actor is not familiar with. Auditions often involve monologues or speeches, but not always. In some cases, an auditionee is asked to read a scene (with a second person reading the other character). For most auditions, it is expected that auditionees will bring a professional 8\\"x10\\" photo called a \\"head shot\\" and a resume that indicates their acting experience and training. Actors may bring additional copies of the head shot and resume, in case there are additional members of the casting team present at the audition. The casting agent or company may \\"call back\\" an auditionee days, weeks, or even months after the initial audition for a second audition. At a major audition for a professional company, the time limits are strictly enforced. A musical theater performer may be given a moment to tell the piano accompanist the tempo, and state their name and audition number to the audition panel. Then, once the auditionee starts acting or singing, the clock starts running. A buzzer sounds when the time limit runs out, which may be a minute and a half, two minutes, or three minutes, depending on the company. At this point, the auditionee is expected to stop and leave to free up the stage for the next auditionee. Right before the audition, the casting director may give new instructions that were not in the advertisement; for example, due to time constraints, the time limit for the monologues might be cut in half, or the vocal selections might be cut. Actors know that it is important that they follow these last-minute instructions, and not be \\"thrown off balance\\" by these changes. At an audition, a director may ask for changes in the delivery of the lines or in other aspects of the performance. The goal may be to see if the auditionee is versatile or because the director disagrees with the initial approach used by the auditionee. In either case, the behavior of the auditionee is important; if the auditionee is cooperative in making the changes, it shows that he or she will be easy to work with. If a script is provided beforehand, actors often try to memorize as much as possible, because this shows that they have prepared and it allows them to look up from the script and show their facial expressions more. Film auditions are different from theatre auditions. For film auditions, actors and actresses are given \\"sides\\" which are often a few pages of the script with the roles that they are auditioning for. These sides are often given to the actors 1‚Äì3 days before the audition. In 2015, the widespread availability of relatively inexpensive video cameras has made video recordings of auditions feasible. To find their talent, casting directors are able to request video auditions from actors and actresses from a different state or country. Music=Popular music=Instrumentalists A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play basslines from a range of different styles. In some styles of music, such as jazz-oriented stage bands, instrumentalists may be asked to sight read printed music at various levels of difficulty. In jazz groups, auditionees may be asked to perform standard pieces (e.g., a jazz standard such as \\"Now's the Time\\") with an ensemble. Similarly, in a rock or blues band, auditionees may be asked to play a rock or blues standard. An auditionee for a rhythm section role (rhythm guitar, electric bass, drumkit, etc.) will be asked to play a range of standard styles or \\"feels\\" which are used in a given style. For example, a drummer applying to play in a jazz band might be asked to play a slow ballad, a medium \\"standard\\", and an up-tempo swing style. A bassist auditioning for a pop band might be asked to play in a Motown style bassline, a syncopated 1970s funk \\"slapping\\" style line, and a reggae-style bassline. A person auditioning for a role as a rhythm section member in some styles of music may be expected to be able to demonstrate the ability to perform as a backup singer. A performer auditioning for a solo or \\"lead\\" instrument role will typically perform prepared solos that showcase a range of skills, including the ability to perform a melody with sensitivity and expression; the ability to play virtuosic passages; and, in some styles (e.g., fusion jazz or blues), the ability to improvise a melody over a chord progression. In some popular genres, there is relatively less emphasis on \\"stage presence\\" and movement onstage, such as classic jazz or traditional 1950s-style country music. In these styles, there is more of a focus on the sound of the music and the expressiveness of the performer with their voice or instrument. In other genres, such as heavy metal \\"shred guitar\\" or hardcore punk, it may be very important that a performer can move about in a dramatic fashion onstage. One of the differences between instrumentalist auditions in rock music styles and Classical styles is that in a rock context, the performers will be expected to have memorized most or all of the music. In a Classical context, most or all of the music is read from sheet music (with the exception of a solo Bach suite movement or a solo concerto movement). Singers Irving Berlin, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and Helen Tamiris watching music theater auditions For rock, country, and other forms of popular music, auditions are used to test the ability of an instrumentalist or singer to perform a specific style of music, or several styles. A singer auditioning for a role in a musical theatre production would not, unless instructed otherwise, need to sing opera or country music, and a musician auditioning for a seat in an orchestra would not perform rock. Occasionally a musical theatre audition may require the performer to sing a song in the genre to which the musical pertains. For instance, a singer auditioning for Destry Rides Again may be asked to sing a standard country-western song. A person auditioning for The Rocky Horror Show may be asked to sing a standard rock song. As well, in some cases, an audition may require a performer to demonstrate pieces in several styles. A hard rock band auditioning a new singer may request that the individual perform songs from heavy metal and related styles such as blues rock. A pop or rock band that is selecting a new lead singer that has whittled the number of applicants down to the top two or three singers may test out how the singers perform in live shows by performing a few live concerts with each guest singer. This allows the band to see how the singer performs in a full multi-hour concert, including how well the singer can develop a rapport with the audience, deal with the inevitable problems that occur in live music (e.g., microphones failing or stage lights malfunctioning), and maintain their vocal endurance until the end of the evening. A contestant in the Eurovision Song Contest tries to impress the judges at her live audition For smaller roles in a large musical theater production, mass auditions are held at which many inexperienced or aspiring performers, most without agents, show up. These are popularly known as \\"cattle calls\\", since the hopefuls are often kept together in one large room. The musical A Chorus Line depicts this type of audition. American Idol also auditions its aspiring vocalists using this technique, since there are so many auditions. In musical theater and in pop music styles for which onstage dancing is part of the performance (e.g., hip hop), singers who are doing a vocal audition may also be required to demonstrate that they can dance while singing. In some popular music groups, such as a rock band, a backup singer may be expected to be able to play an instrument while singing, such as strumming a simple rhythm guitar part or playing a percussion instrument (e.g., tambourine or congas). While an ability to sing in multiple languages with the appropriate diction and pronunciation is more associated with Classical music than popular music, there are some popular styles where multiple languages are expected, including Latin jazz styles such as Bossa Nova (Portuguese songs may be requested); Tango (Spanish songs may be requested); folk music (French songs may be requested); and Celtic music (Irish songs may be requested). =Classical music= In classical music, auditions are used to screen candidates for positions as instrumentalists in chamber groups or orchestras or as soloists, and to screen singers for positions as members of a choir or as solo performers. In classical music, auditions are also used to screen candidates for entry to training programs, university or Conservatory programs or degrees, and training festival activities (e.g., classical summer camps). In comparison with some types of pop music auditions, classical auditions tend to be much more formal. The performer may, by tradition, wear a tuxedo or a formal dress, and the judges may sit behind a desk and write comments on clipboards. Instrumentalists In classical music, each instrument or vocal type has a standard repertoire of music which is commonly requested at auditions. Instrumentalists in an orchestral context are typically asked to perform excerpts from the orchestral literature, including both exposed solos and \\"tutti\\" parts which are particularly demanding. Orchestral auditions are typically held in front of a panel that includes the conductor, the Concertmaster, and a number of Principal players from the orchestra. In the United States since WWII, professional orchestra auditions often include a musician's union representative, who ensures that the audition is being run in a fair manner. A cloth screen may be used at some stages of the audition process, to protect the audition panel from allegations of favouritism or sexism. In Germany, Austria, and German-speaking Switzerland, the entire orchestra (every tenured member) votes on the musicians auditioning, with the section the musician would join (and sometimes the conductor) having a veto. An orchestral audition will normally set out a list of orchestral excerpts which each performer has to prepare. As well, each performer plays a movement from a Sonata or Concerto which may be performed with piano accompaniment. When the performer plays the orchestral excerpts, he or she may be given a tempo, or asked to follow the gestures of the conductor. Orchestral auditions are often run in several stages, in order to screen candidates and reduce those who are less likely to meet the needs of the job. A large number of applicants typically apply for a professional orchestra job. The orchestra personnel manager then selects the most promising candidates based on the experience and training indicated in the applicants' CVs (and, in some cases, based on the performing ability demonstrated in a recording of the applicant). This first \\"cut\\" of auditionees then perform in front of the audition panel. Typically in a professional orchestra, this would require the performance of excerpts representing stylistic and technical challenges drawn from repertoire typical to that orchestra. The most promising candidates are invited to return for a second or third round of auditions, which allows the conductor and the panel to compare the best candidates. Performers may be asked to sight read orchestral music. If a candidate is successful in passing the audition, typically a Trial period of several months to a year takes place allowing the Chief Conductor and Principal players to see if the individual can function well in an actual performance setting. Singers There is a standard repertoire of vocal literature for each voice type (e.g., soprano, alto) that is used at auditions for singers. Each sub-type of vocal activity has a separate standard audition repertoire (e.g., choirs, operas, etc.). A person auditioning for a role in a choir will be expected to be able to sight read choral parts. In auditions for opera, a singer will be expected to demonstrate the ability to act out the movements that are associated with the lyrics of the aria, which may include pretending to be dying from a stab wound, miming an activity (e.g., pouring wine), or doing a simple dance routine. Both choral and opera singers are expected to be able to follow the gestures of a conductor in regards to expression and tempo. Since microphones are not used in most classical music performances,The exception is acoustic enhancement systems which apply a subtle amplification in order to balance the volume in the hall and compensate for acoustic problems. the audition panel will be assessing the auditionees ability to project a strong, room-filling vocal tone. In classical music, in addition to judging singing ability (e.g., tone, intonation, etc.), the audition panel will be judging the applicant's ability to use the appropriate diction and pronunciation of the major languages used in Art music: German, Italian, and French. Other languages that the applicant may be asked to sing in include English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin. Musical theatre In musical theatre, a standard audition consists of two sixteen-measure selections of songs, contrasting in style, intention, characters, time period, or all of the above. There is also usually a monologue portion, where the actor is asked to perform a one-minute monologue. A headshot and r√©sum√© are almost always required. Although auditions vary depending on the theatre, program, or show, this formula is considered ‚Äúthe norm‚Äù in the musical theatre world. The purpose of an audition is two-fold. Practically, performers audition to get a callback. \\"Callbacks\\", or callback auditions, allow the artistic team to assess a performer's skills in accordance with specific characters. During the callback, the panel has shortlisted a candidate, because they have noted his or her potential for particular parts. As such, during a callback audition, the candidate is asked to sing the songs performed by certain characters or read their lines. The first audition is not a platform for selling oneself as a particular character. Character-specific auditions take place during callbacks. Instead, the first audition is a chance for the performer to show off the songs she does best. Dance Two dancers performing modern dance, a style in which performers may be asked to demonstrate improvised movements at an audition. There are many types of dance auditions for different performance venues. Dance companies hire employees for ballet and modern dance shows. Broadway companies hire dancers for traditional musicals (Rodgers and Hammerstein) and more modern dance musicals (e.g., Fame and Grease). Casinos, resorts, amusement parks, and cruise ships hire dancers for revue-style shows that can range from jazz dance to hip-hop. For these shows, some backup singing skills or acting skills may be required. Pop music concert producers and pop music video producers recruit dancers to perform onstage during concerts or during videos. For live pop concerts, onstage dancers may be required to perform simple backup singing. Movie and TV producers also hire dancers for short term shoots; even though a dancer may only get several days of work from a movie or TV show, there may be residual payments. Most auditions specify what type of dance skills are required (e.g., Classical, pointe, contemporary, jazz, hip- hop, etc.). In the case of modern dance, some dance companies ask applicants to demonstrate their ability to improvise dance moves. These dancers from the Braziers troupe are performing Highland dancing, a style at which auditionees must demonstrate a high degree of technique and the ability to quickly learn new steps. Many dance auditions test the ability of applicants to learning new choreography in a short time period, rather than showcasing a prepared work. In other cases, a short prepared solo piece may also be required (about 90 seconds long). Applicants will be instructed in a technical routine or pattern in a group session. Some auditions require applicants to have completed training at a recognised dance school or conservatoire, and in some cases, auditionees may be requested to bring a reference letter from a dance teacher or dance company director (especially in the case of young dancers with little professional experience). At some auditions, applicants are asked to make a short verbal statement about their dancing goals or why they wish to join the troupe. Auditionees should ensure that they know the major dance terms, because the judges may request that certain dance moves be demonstrated. Dancers are often asked to bring one or two photographs, such as a \\"headshot\\" and a full-body photo of the applicant in a dancing pose. The clothing that auditionees need to wear at auditions varies. At some auditions, particularly Classical auditions, there is a strict dress code: applicants wear dance leotards and pointe shoes, and long hair is tied back. Other dance auditions specify loose clothing. For some contemporary dance auditions, applicants must dance barefoot. In some music theater roles, applicants need to bring tap shoes to demonstrate their tap dancing skills. Some auditions where there is a large number of applicants require the performers to wear a number pinned to their shirt, in a similar way to marathon runners. This way, if the casting director sees an exceptional dancer, he or she can take note of the number. Unless jewellery or make-up is an expected part of a dancer's appearance in a certain dance style, dance auditionees generally avoid jewellery and makeup. In music theater and pop music, there is a lot of crossover between dancing and singing roles. Almost all dancers in music theater and many dancers in pop music will be expected to have some singing ability as a backup singer (singing harmony parts to accompany the solo vocalists). In rarer cases, dancers will be asked to demonstrate the ability to play a musical instrument (e.g., guitar), because there are some shows in which some of the dancer- actors have to play instruments onstage, such as the Threepenny Opera. In music theater, there is also often crossover between dancing and acting roles. Dancers may be expected to be able to take on an acting role and speak lines (often in a supporting role). Some major dance companies have \\"open calls\\" once a year, in which any or almost any applicant can come to demonstrate their dancing skills. At these open calls, the entire group of applicants are taught a dance routine by a choreographer, and then the group of dancers performs the routine while judges assess their performance. It can be hard for a good dancer to get noticed by the judges in such a large group of dancers. For this reason, some dance coaches encourage their students to wear outgoing clothes and bright things to stand out, so that the dancer will get personal attention during his or her audition. For any audition interviews, dancers should send their resume and headshot to the company director ahead of time. Circuses and amusement parks A high wire act by an acrobat Performers auditioning for amusement parks worldwide are generally viewed by one or more casting directors in a rehearsal hall or a large facility. Most theme park auditions, like other auditions, are closed to the public. This means that no one is allowed into the audition room who is not auditioning. Vocalists for Disney auditions are asked to prepare two separate vocal selections of contrasting styles. The singers do not sing the entire songs; instead they just need to sing the best 16 bars of each song. Disney provides a piano accompanist for all vocal auditions, and so singers have to bring sheet music in the correct key. Disney does not allow any pre-recorded accompaniment. The casting directors may also ask auditionees to learn additional music or learn a movement combination. Disney Parks & Resorts casts performers for theme parks, resorts, and cruise ships. At Cirque du Soleil, depending on a performer's discipline, the audition may last an hour, a day or even two days. Depending on a performer's discipline, he or she might have to perform a solo presentation in front of the group of participants and/or participate in individual and group exercises following the solo presentation. Auditions for Cirque du Soleil are filmed. Modeling Model Ai Tominaga modeling in the 2004 Red Dress Collection for the Heart Truth campaign Modelling agencies and other organizations that are looking for models, such as fashion designers and advertising agencies also use auditions to screen and select potential candidates. Aspiring female models for most fashion industry roles need to be in their teens or early twenties and be tall and slim. Although there are \\"niche markets\\" for non-svelte models (\\"plus size models\\" and \\"real life models\\" who model clothes for middle-market clothing catalogues), most female models need to be slender and between 108‚Äì125 lbs. Young men who are aspiring models should be between 18 and 25, tall, and fit. While male models who are selected at modelling auditions may well end up having careers that last till beyond age 25 (even into their 40s), modelling agencies prefer to recruit new models in the 18‚Äì25 age range. Most models work with an agent who arranges auditions, bookings, and negotiates fees. At an audition, casting agents will ask the model to demonstrate different poses, which a photographer may record with a digital camera. For high fashion auditions, the model may be asked to demonstrate the \\"catwalk\\" style of modelling clothes on a raised runway. At most modelling auditions, models wear fairly simple clothes that will allow the talent agents to imagine the model in different garments. Typically, a model wears fairly body-hugging clothes, so that the judges can see the body type of the model. Some modelling agencies audition a large number of aspiring models in an \\"open call\\", in which agents consider applicants for under a minute or so each. Some agencies hold model searches, which is a type of beauty contest in which applicants audition for the opportunity of winning a model portfolio or a photo shoot.

Some older maps refer to the area as \\"Woodman's Hollow State Park.\\" History=Geological Formation and Early Human Use= Many of the rock bluffs lining the interior of the preserve are composed of sandstones, limestones, and dolomites. The rock was produced over time from chemical and physical processes acting on the bed of ancient marine seaways that once covered vast portions of North America between 66 and 550 million years ago. The shoreline of the ancient seaways migrated back and forth from roughly Oklahoma to Illinois, and the river delta systems deposited clay, mud, peat, and channel sands across the area. Over time, these deposits were compacted and cemented into the familiar rock formations observed today. Significant erosion of glacial deposits by the Des Moines River and associated tributaries has helped to expose these deposits over time after the retreat of the Wisconsin Glaciation about 12,000 to 14,000 years before present.Iowa Department of Natural Resources - Geological Survey \\"Ancient River Channels\\", Retrieved on 2009-11-21.

The Guide to Iowa's State Preserves. Iowa City: University of Iowa Press. . =Designation as a State Public Area= The Iowa Board of Conservation purchased the land that would become Woodman Hollow in 1927 from A. S. Woodman. The original intent of the area was for it to be developed as a state park, and in the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed an access road, two latrines, some trails, and the foundations for a trail bridge. The State of Iowa later decided to discontinue development of the area and to leave it in its natural condition. The land was officially designated as a biological, geological, and archaeological state preserve on August 12, 1970.Wolf, Robert Charles (1991). Iowa State Parks. Ames: Iowa State University Press . Today=Overview= The preserve features several deep, forested ravines, which combine into a larger ravine with a small creek that empties into the Des Moines River. The creek is spring and runoff fed. Sandstone bedrock lines the ravine walls. Several small cascades and waterfalls up to high have carved a shallow gorge through the center of the preserve. The two latrines constructed decades ago were not removed after efforts to develop the area into a state park were abandoned, and have fallen into heavy dis-repair. The access road was removed, and most trails within the park have eroded away or have become overgrown, except for those maintained by the footsteps of infrequent visitors. =Flora= Over 500 species of plants can be found within Woodman Hollow. The preserve is said to have one of the largest varieties of ferns in the state of Iowa. Trees found in the area include white and red oak in the uplands. Numerous old growth trees, some over 300 years in age, exist within the boundaries of the preserve, some old enough to be used in climate reconstruction through Dendrochronology.Duvick - Woodman Hollow State Preserve - QUAL - ITRDB IA026 \\"NOAA Paleoclimatology\\", Retrieved on 2009-12-3. Near the river, steep ravine walls on both sides of the creek exceed in height - steep enough to vary the species of flora over short distances. =Access to the Preserve= The entrance to the preserve is on Woodman's Hollow Road, east of Otho. A small, grassy parking area provides a space for two vehicles. The entrance to the main area of the preserve is a narrow, overgrown corridor between two farm fields that heads south for roughly , which is the old access road grade.

He was born in Washington, D.C., in 1910 and he died in Provincetown, MA in May 1984. He was the son of Giuseppe and Concetta Battaglia, who had emigrated from Cefal√π, Italy. Aurelius attended the Corcoran School of Art. He graduated as one of the Corcoran's most promising students, winning $50 in a Corcoran-sponsored art contest. Career Battaglia migrated west in the late 1930s and worked for the Walt Disney Studios from 1937 to 1941. He contributed most notably to Dumbo, Fantasia, and Pinocchio and is credited as one of the writers of the latter. In the mid-1950s, Battaglia joined United Productions of America, a studio staffed by some of the industry's most accomplished, forward-thinking animation artists. Perhaps his most outstanding UPA contribution was the short film The Invisible Moustache of Raoul Dufy. Battaglia directed the film, which was nominated for a BAFTA award. Battaglia was also a prolific children's book illustrator. His picture book work in the 1950s and 1960s differs significantly from the deco-inspired circus animals of his depression-era murals. They feature bold, solid colors and striking, stylized pen and brush work indicative of the looser, more abstract mid-century cartooning style that he helped pioneer. Notable examples include \\"Cowboy Jack, the Sheriff,\\" \\"The Fire Engine Book,\\" \\"Little Boy With a Big Horn,\\" \\"When I Met Robin,\\" \\"Captain Kangaroo's Read-Aloud Book,\\" and \\"The Fireside Book of American Folk Songs.\\" He contributed to the Childcraft book series published by Field Enterprises. Battaglia moved to Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he continued to work until his death in May 1984. Personal life Battaglia married fellow student Edith Richmond after the two of them graduated from Corcoran School of Art in 1932. Her father, Stoughton Richmond Sr, was an attorney who told them in no uncertain terms that they'd have to find a way to make a living with their art, as he would not support them. They bartered paintings for dental work and other necessities before heading to California, where Aurie truly established himself as an artist.  Style  In the 1930s, Battaglia worked in a flowing, deco-influenced, organic style informed by classic European illustration. His later children's book and animation work was emblematic of the radical, more abstract stylization prevalent in the 1950s and '60s, a trend he helped to establish. In 1934, the Public Works of Art Project commissioned Battaglia to paint murals in the children's section of the library in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington where he resided. The result was a stunning, whimsical panorama of anthropomorphic animals at play. It still hangs in the alcoves of the building's second floor. The Mount Pleasant Library is located at 3160 16th Street, NW Washington, DC 20010. Additional information Battaglia started out as a caricaturist for the old Washington Star. He later worked for the Resettlement Administration (RA), a New Deal U.S. federal agency that, between April 1935 and December 1936, relocated struggling urban and rural families to communities planned by the federal government. 1937-1941: Walt Disney Studios (Dumbo - story development - as Aurie Battaglia, Fantasia, and Pinocchio - story adaptation). Battaglia started working for Disney on January 6, 1937 as an in-betweener, soon after Battaglia moved to the Story Department, where he worked as a sketch man and contributed ideas. Battaglia worked on the \\"Fox and the Cat\\" sequence, story sketch, for Pinocchio. Battaglia worked on the \\"Pastoral\\" sequence of Fantasia, and the \\"Dance of the Hours\\" sequence - hippo & alligator. Battaglia made storyboards for Dumbo, worked on the \\"Pink Elephant\\" sequence and wrote some of the gags. Battaglia participated in the Disney animators' strike. He was fired, but was able to return. He also worked briefly for Warner Brothers. Battaglia made training films for the navy during World War II as a civilian. (obituary) Joined the Navy, stationed on Constitution Ave in D.C., made slide films, \\"How to survive in the jungle.\\" (from Michael Barrier Interview, September 6, 1983) Battaglia made 17 or more theatre caricatures of actors during the late 1940s for the New York Times, the Compass, and the New York Star.

Two of the book dummies contain children from a variety of ethnic backgrounds‚Äîyears before Ezra Jack Keats book, \\"The Snowy Day\\".

X-rays may induce such an energy storage. A plate based on this mechanism is called a photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plate and is one type of X-ray detector used in projectional radiography. Creating an image requires illuminating the plate twice: the first exposure, to the radiation of interest, \\"writes\\" the image, and a later, second illumination (typically by a visible-wavelength laser) \\"reads\\" the image. The device to read such a plate is known as a phosphorimager (occasionally spelled phosphoimager, perhaps reflecting its common application in molecular biology for detecting radiolabeled phosphorylated proteins and nucleic acids). Projectional radiography using a photostimulable phosphor plate as an X-ray detector can be called \\"phosphor plate radiography\\" or \\"computed radiography\\" (not to be confused with computed tomography which uses computer processing to convert multiple projectional radiographies to a 3D image).  Structure and mechanism  The phosphor plate radiography process =Energy storage= On photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plates, the phosphor layer is typically 0.1 to 0.3 mm thick. After the initial exposure by short-wavelength (typically, X-ray) electromagnetic radiation, excited electrons in the phosphor material remain 'trapped' in 'colour centres' (\\"F-centers\\") in the crystal lattice until stimulated by the second illumination. For example, Fuji's photostimulable phosphor is deposited on a flexible polyester film support with grain size about 5 micrometers, and is described as \\"barium fluorobromide containing a trace amount of bivalent europium as a luminescence center\\". Europium is a divalent cation that replaces barium to create a solid solution. When Eu2+ ions are struck by ionizing radiation, they lose an additional electron to become Eu3+ ions. These electrons enter the conduction band of the crystal and become trapped in the bromine ion empty lattice of the crystal, resulting in a metastable state that is higher in energy than the original condition. =Energy release and digitalization= Readout of a PSP plate A lower-frequency light source that is insufficient in energy to create more Eu3+ ions can return the trapped electrons to the conduction band. As these mobilized electrons encounter Eu3+ ions, they release a blue-violet 400 nm luminescence. This light is produced in proportion to the number of trapped electrons, and thus in proportion to the original X-ray signal. It can be collected often by a photomultiplier tube, which is clocked at a specific resolution or pixel capture frequency. The light is thereby converted to an electronic signal and significantly amplified. The electronic signal is then quantized via an ADC to discrete (digital) values for each pixel and placed into the image processor pixel map. =Reuse= Afterwards, the plates can be \\"erased,\\" by exposing the plate to room-intensity white light. Thereby, the plate can be used over and over again. Imaging plates can theoretically be re- used thousands of times if they are handled carefully and under certain radiation exposure conditions. PSP plate handling under industrial conditions often results in damage after a few hundred uses. Mechanical damage such as scratches and abrasions are common, as well as radiation fatigue or imprinting due to high energy applications. An image can be erased by simply exposing the plate to a room-level fluorescent light - but more efficient, complete erasure is required to avoid signal carry-over and artifacts. Most laser scanners automatically erase the plate (current technology uses red LED lighting) after laser scanning is complete. The imaging plate can then be re-used. Reusable phosphor plates are environmentally safe but need to be disposed of according to local regulations due to the composition of the phosphor, which contains the heavy metal Barium.  Uses  thumb Computed radiography is used for both industrial radiography and medical projectional radiography. Image plate detectors have also been used in numerous crystallography studies. = Medical X-ray Imaging = In phosphor plate radiography, the imaging plate is housed in a special cassette and placed under the body part or object to be examined and the x-ray exposure is made. The imaging plate is then run through a special laser scanner, or CR reader, that reads and converts the image to a digital radiograph. The digital image can then be viewed and enhanced using software that has functions very similar to other conventional digital image- processing software, such as contrast, brightness, filtration and zoom. CR imaging plates (IPs) can be retrofitted to existing exam rooms and used in multiple x-ray sites since IPs are processed through a CR reader (scanner) that can be shared between multiple exam rooms. Differences from Direct Radiography CeReO - PSP plate scanner PSP plate radiography is often distinguished from Direct Radiography (DR). Direct radiography usually refers to image capture onto an amorphous silicon or selenium flat panel detector (FPD), the data being directly passed electronically to the processing computer. PSP plate radiography instead uses a cassette containing the imaging plate, which stores the image until it is read out and loaded into the computer. This additional extra step, from exposing the detector to a viewable digital image, is the main difference between the two techniques. PSP plates and DR FPDs are typically used for projectional radiography. This should not be confused with fluoroscopy, where there is a continuous beam of radiation and the images appear on the screen in real time, for which PSP plates cannot be used.  History  Image plates were pioneered for commercial medical use by Fuji in the 1980s.

The mountainous accumulations of boulders known as the Alabama Hills served as the backdrop for the film's opening and closing scenes.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/19798/Comanche-Station/articles.html Plot Jefferson Cody, whose wife was captured by Comanches, frees another man's wife and is taking her home. Three outlaws, led by the charming but malevolent Ben Lane, reveal that the woman's husband has offered a $5,000 reward, making the woman, Lordsburg resident Mrs. Lowe, suspicious of Cody's motives in coming to her rescue. Lane is known to Cody, who helped court- martial him from the army for killing \\"tame\\" Indians. The Comanche in the area, on the warpath due to recent Comanche scalpings, kill Frank, one of Lane's men, and make repeated attempts to kill the rest of the party. Lane attaches himself to Cody, intending to make it look like the Comanches killed Cody and to take the reward for himself. Although her husband did not try to find her himself, the reward for the return of Mrs. Lowe is \\"dead or alive,\\" so Lane prefers dead so she won't be able to testify against him. He tries to ambush her and Cody, and when partner Dobie refuses to help, Lane shoots him. In a showdown in the hills, Cody gets the better of Lane. He escorts the woman back home, discovering that her husband is blind. Before he can be paid the $5,000, Cody rides away.

The school is a state-integrated all-girls Catholic secondary school for years 9-13. History The school, which is one of the oldest existing schools in New Zealand, was founded in 1850 by Philippe Viard, first Bishop of Wellington and staffed from 1861 by a small group of religious sisters, the \\"Sisters of Mercy\\", established by Viard. Part of the land on which the school is situated was donated by Lord Petre, the 11th Baron Petre (1793-1850), who was a director of the New Zealand Company and whose family seat Thorndon Hall in Essex was an important centre of Catholic Recusancy from the time of Queen Elizabeth I. Another part of the site was given by Sir George Grey, Governor of New Zealand out of public funds. In 1861 the school was taken over by the Sisters of Mercy who first arrived in Wellington in that year. To begin with, the school was co-educational (boys and girls) and had a boarding facility attached. Nowadays the boarding facility is gone, and it is a single sex girls' school. Buildings While most traces of the original buildings on the site have disappeared, buildings dating from the twentieth century as the latest, including the \\"Gabriel Block\\" which is now used as the school hall. The other two main blocks are \\"Carlow\\" and \\"McAuley\\". McAuley is named after Sister Catherine McAuley, who used her inherited fortune to found the Sisters of Mercy in Dublin, Ireland. The school remains in the ownership of the Sisters of Mercy and describes itself as a \\"Mercy School\\". The Gabriel Hall and St Joseph's Providence Porch have Category II listings with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. As most other New Zealand Schools do, students in years 11-13 sit NCEA (National Certificate of Educational Achievement) examinations.

It is bordered to the north by the Grand Union Canal mainline and to the south by the M4. The area now consists of a mixture of mostly large, semi detached suburban properties. It is also home to the Airlinks golf course and Convent Way, an estate with a mixture of high and low-rise housing. Etymology The name North Hyde is thought to mean \\"north land\\", seeming to mean area of land lying to the north of Heston. There is some evidence to suggest that this area of land was named by a wealthy Saxon land owner trying to avoid paying taxes to the parish of Heston. History Before the 18th century, North Hyde formed part of the infamous Hounslow Heath. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Board of Ordnance (responsible for provision of arms, artillery and other items to the armed forces) took the decision to establish an Ordnance Depot at North Hyde, alongside the Grand Junction Canal. Mindful of the vulnerability of its coastal gun wharves and gunpowder magazines to a possible seaborne attack, the Board planned to establish inland depots at points on the canal network; (another was established at Weedon Bec, Northamptonshire, at around the same time).Royal Ordnance Depot History, Weedon Bec of land alongside the canal was compulsorily purchased; work began in 1813 and took four years to complete. The depot initially consisted of three magazines, each holding 6,800 barrels of powder, along with ancillary buildings and an adjacent barracks for three officers and fifty soldiers to guard the site. The complex was enclosed within a branch of the canal, which (as well as creating a defensive perimeter) provided the powder barges with direct access to the magazines, mixing houses and cooperages. By 1830 some 42,000 barrels of gunpowder were being stored at the North Hyde Depot; the following year, however, the depot closed. The magazines were demolished not long afterwards. The canal branch (known as the Hanwell Loop) continued in use, at least until the 1880s, serving a brickworks which had been established on the site; it was gradually filled in during the first half of the 20th century. In 1842, the former barracks were taken over by the Belgian Catholic order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy and turned into an orphanage for Roman Catholic boys (St Mary's Orphanage). In 1914 it was reconstituted as an Industrial School; it closed in 1934 and the buildings were later demolished.

The Lake of the Dead exists on another plane of existence beneath Spring Lake at the junction of the Zuni River and the Little Colorado River.

Microsoft had worked with Apple Computer to develop applications for Apple's January 1984 original Macintosh, the first mass-produced personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI) that enabled users to see user friendly icons on screen. Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Microsoft Windows line. It runs as a graphical, 16-bit multi-tasking shell on top of an existing MS-DOS installation. It provides an environment which can run graphical programs designed for Windows, as well as existing MS-DOS software. Its development was spearheaded by the company founder Bill Gates after he saw a demonstration of a similar software suite known as Visi On at COMDEX. Despite positive responses to its early presentations and support from a number of hardware and software makers, Windows 1.0 was received poorly by critics. Critics felt Windows 1.0 did not meet their expectations. In particular, they felt that Windows 1.0 put too much emphasis on mouse input at a time when mouse use was not yet widespread; not providing enough resources for new users; and for performance issues, especially on systems with lower computer hardware specifications. Despite these criticisms, Windows 1.0 was an important milestone for Microsoft, as it introduced the Microsoft Windows line. On December 31, 2001, Windows 1.0 was declared obsolete and Microsoft stopped providing support and updates for the system.  History  A Microsoft Windows 1.0 brochure published in January 1986 Microsoft began developing a graphical user interface (GUI) in 1981. The development of Windows began after Microsoft founder Bill Gates saw a demonstration at COMDEX 1982 of VisiCorp's Visi On, a GUI software suite for IBM PC compatible computers. In 1983 Microsoft learned that Apple's own GUI software‚Äîalso bit-mapped, and based in part on research from Xerox PARC‚Äîwas much more advanced; Microsoft decided they needed to differentiate their own offering. In August 1983, Gates recruited Scott McGregor, one of the key developers behind PARC's original windowing system, to be the developer team lead for Windows 1.0 Microsoft first presented Windows to the public on November 10, 1983. Requiring two floppy disk drives and 192 KB of RAM, Microsoft described the software as a device driver for MS-DOS 2.0. By supporting cooperative multitasking in tiled windows when using well-behaved applications that only used DOS system calls, and permitting non-well-behaved applications to run in a full screen, Windows differed from both Visi On and Apple Computers Lisa by immediately offering many applications. Unlike Visi On, Windows developers did not need to use Unix to develop IBM PC applications; Microsoft planned to encourage other companies, including competitors, to develop programs for Windows by not requiring a Microsoft user interface in their applications. Many manufacturers of MS-DOS computers such as Compaq, Zenith, and DEC promised to provide support, as did software companies such as Ashton-Tate and Lotus. After previewing Windows, BYTE magazine stated in December 1983 that it \\"seems to offer remarkable openness, reconfigurability, and transportability as well as modest hardware requirements and pricing ‚Ä¶ Barring a surprise product introduction from another company, Microsoft Windows will be the first large-scale test of the desktop metaphor in the hands of its intended users\\". From early in Windows' history Gates viewed it as Microsoft's future. He told InfoWorld magazine in April 1984 that \\"Our strategies and energies as a company are totally committed to Windows, in the same way that we're committed to operating-system kernels like MS-DOS and Xenix. We're also saying that only applications that take advantage of Windows will be competitive in the long run.\\" IBM was notably absent from Microsoft's announcement, and by late 1984, the press reported a \\"War of the Windows\\" between Windows, IBM's TopView, and Digital Research's Graphics Environment Manager (GEM). Microsoft had promised in November 1983 to ship Windows by April 1984, but subsequently denied that it had announced a release date, and predicted that Windows would ship by June 1985. During its development and before its windowing system was developed, it was briefly referred to by the codename \\"Interface Manager\\". Deemphasizing multitasking, the company stated that Windows' purpose, unlike that of TopView, was to \\"turn the computer into a graphics-rich environment\\" while using less memory. After Microsoft persuaded IBM that the latter needed a GUI, in April 1987 the two companies announced the introduction of OS/2 and its graphical OS/2 Presentation Manager, which were supposed to ultimately replace both MS-DOS and Windows. =Release versions: Windows 1.01‚Äì1.04= Windows version 1.01, released on November 20, 1985, was the first public release of Windows. The first international release, Windows version 1.02, was released in May 1986. Windows version 1.03, released in August 1986, included enhancements that made it consistent with the international release like drivers for European keyboards and additional screen and printer drivers. Windows version 1.04, released in April 1987, added support for the new IBM PS/2 computers, although no support for PS/2 mice or new VGA graphics modes was provided. However, on May 27, 1987, an OEM version was released by IBM, which added VGA support, PS/2 mouse support, MCGA support, and support for the 8514/A display driver. IBM released this version on three 3.5 inch 720k floppies, and offered it as part of their \\"Personal Publishing System\\" and \\"Collegiate Kit\\" bundles. = Succession: Windows 2.0 = In November 1987, Windows 1.0 was succeeded by Windows 2.0. Microsoft supported Windows 1.0 for 16 years, until December 31, 2001 ‚Äì the longest out of all versions of Windows.  Features  Multitasking capabilities of Microsoft Windows 1.01 released in 1985, here shown running the MS-DOS Executive and Calculator programs Windows 1.0 offers limited multitasking of existing MS-DOS programs and concentrates on creating an interaction paradigm (cf. message loop), an execution model and a stable API for native programs for the future. Due to Microsoft's extensive support for backward compatibility, it is not only possible to execute Windows 1.0 binary programs on current versions (albeit only 32-bit) of Windows to a large extent, but also to recompile their source code into an equally functional \\"modern\\" application with just limited modifications. Windows 1.0 is often regarded as a \\"front-end to the MS-DOS operating system\\", a description which has also been applied to subsequent versions of Windows. Windows 1.0 is an MS-DOS program. Windows 1.0 programs can call MS-DOS functions, and GUI programs are run from .exe files just like MS-DOS programs. However, Windows .exe files had their own \\"new executable\\" (NE) file format, which only Windows could process and which, for example, allowed demand-loading of code and data. Applications were supposed to handle memory only through Windows' own memory management system, which implemented a software-based virtual memory scheme allowing for applications larger than available RAM. Because graphics support in MS-DOS is extremely limited, MS-DOS applications have to go to the bare hardware (or sometimes just to the BIOS) to get work done. Therefore, Windows 1.0 included original device drivers for video cards, a mouse, keyboards, printers and serial communications, and applications were supposed to only invoke APIs built upon these drivers. However, this extended to other APIs such as file system management functions. In this sense, Windows 1.0 was designed to be extended into a full-fledged operating system, rather than being just a graphics environment used by applications. Indeed, Windows 1.0 is a \\"DOS front-end\\" and cannot operate without a DOS environment (it uses, for example, the file-handling functions provided by DOS.) The level of replacement increases in subsequent versions. The system requirements for Windows 1.01 constituted CGA/HGC/EGA (listed as \\"Monochrome or color monitor\\"), MS-DOS 2.0, 256 KB of memory or greater, and two double-sided disk drives or a hard drive. Beginning with version 1.03, support for Tandy and AT&T; graphics modes was added. MS-DOS Executive file manager. Windows 1.0 runs a shell program known as the MS-DOS Executive, which is little more than a mouse-able output of the DIR command that does not support icons and is not Y2K-compliant. Other supplied programs are Calculator, Calendar, Clipboard Viewer, Clock, Notepad, Paint, Reversi, Cardfile, Terminal and Write. Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows. Instead all windows are tiled. Only dialog boxes can appear over other windows, but cannot be minimized. Reception Windows 1.0 was released to mixed reviews. Most critics considered the platform to have future potential, but that Windows 1.0 had not fulfilled expectations. Many reviews criticized its demanding system requirements, especially noting the poor performance experienced when running multiple applications at once, and that Windows encouraged the use of a mouse for navigation, a relatively new concept at the time. The New York Times compared the performance of Windows on a system with 512 KB of RAM to \\"pouring molasses in the Arctic\\", and that its design was inflexible for keyboard users due to its dependency on a mouse-oriented interface. In conclusion, the Times felt that the poor performance, lack of dedicated software, uncertain compatibility with DOS programs, and the lack of tutorials for new users made DOS-based software such as Borland Sidekick (which could provide a similar assortment of accessories and multitasking functionality) more desirable for most PC users. In retrospect, Windows 1.0 was regarded as a flop by contemporary technology publications, who, however, still acknowledged its overall importance to the history of the Windows line. Nathaniel Borenstein (who went on to develop the MIME standards) and his IT team at Carnegie Mellon University were also critical of Windows when it was first presented to them by a group of Microsoft representatives. Underestimating the future impact of the platform, he believed that in comparison to an in-house window manager, \\"these guys came in with this pathetic and na√Øve system. We just knew they were never going to accomplish anything.\\" The Verge considered the poor reception towards the release of Windows 8 in 2012 as a parallel to Microsoft's struggles with early versions of Windows. In a similar fashion to Windows 1.0 running atop MS-DOS as a layer, Windows 8 offered a new type of interface and software geared towards an emerging form of human interface device on PCs, in this case, a touchscreen, running atop the legacy Windows shell used by previous versions. A mock version of Windows 1.0 was created by Microsoft as an app for Windows 10 as part of a tie-in with the Netflix show, Stranger Things, aligned with the release of the show's third season, which takes place during 1985.

He served in the Prussian Army during the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. Matthies emigrated to the United States in 1849 and settled in Iowa where he became a successful liquor merchant.The Lincoln Putsch: America's Bolshevik Revolution Once the Civil War began, Matthies immediately volunteered for the Union Army. On May 14, 1861 he became a captain in the 1st Iowa Volunteer Infantry. Soon after on July 23, 1861 he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 5th Iowa Volunteer Infantry. Matthies first saw action at the Battle of Island Number Ten. He was appointed colonel on May 23, 1862 and fought at the battles of Iuka and Corinth. During the winter of 1862-1863 he was in command of a brigade in the Army of the Tennessee. On April 4, 1864 he was promoted to brigadier general of U.S. Volunteers, to rank from November 29, 1862. He was placed in command of the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division in William T. Sherman‚Äôs XV Corps. Matthies led this brigade during the Vicksburg Campaign, fighting at the Battle of Jackson and in the assaults on Vicksburg. During the following siege, Matthies‚Äô brigade was transferred to the 7th Division of the XVII Corps. In September 1863 Matthies‚Äô brigade became the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, XVII Corps and was sent to the aid of the besieged Union forces at Chattanooga. During the battle of Missionary Ridge, he participated in Sherman‚Äôs attack against the Patrick Cleburne‚Äôs division near Tunnel Hill.

The topic of this article is African American candidates for President of the United States. The article covers only candidates from major parties (including one who briefly left one of the major parties to run). On November 4, 2008, then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama was elected president of the United States. He is the first African American to win a presidential election and the first African American to serve as president of the United States. 19th century= Frederick Douglass = Frederick Douglass was invited to speak at 1888 Republican National Convention. Afterward, during the roll call vote, he received one vote, so was nominally a candidate for the presidency. In those years, the candidates for the position and vice presidency were chosen by state representatives voting at the nominating convention. Many decisions were made by negotiations of state and party leaders \\"behind closed doors.\\" Douglass was not a serious candidate in contemporary terms.  20th century = George Edwin Taylor = In 1904, George Edwin Taylor was president of the National Negro Democratic League.Mouser, For Labor, Race, and Liberty, 102-106. Southern Democrats were enacting laws that disfranchised most Black voters and were imposing segregation through ‚ÄúJim Crow‚Äù laws. Northern Democrats seemed unwilling and unable to control the excesses of their Southern parties. The National Negro Democratic League was fractured by the debate over the issue of linking the nation's currency to silver as well as to gold. By 1904, Taylor was positioned to abandon the party and bureau that he had led as president for two terms. It was not a good time to be a Black Democrat. It also was a time when lynching was creeping northward and when scientific racism was gaining acceptance within the nation's intellectual and scientific community (see Nadir of race relations). ‚ÄúJudge‚Äù Taylor made that change in 1904 when the executive committee of the newly formed National Negro Liberty Party asked him to become their candidate for the office of president of the United States.Ottumwa (Iowa) Daily Courier, 22 July 1904, p.4. That party had its origin in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1897 when it was known as the Ex-Slave Petitioners‚Äô Assembly. It was one of several leagues or assemblies that had formed at the end of the century to support bills then working their way through the United States Congress to grant pensions to former slaves.James Davidson, ‚ÄúEncountering the Ex-Slave Reparation Movement from the Grave: The National Industrial Council and National Liberty Party, 1901-1907,‚Äù The Journal of African American History 97 (2012), 13-38. These leagues claimed that membership in an association was required to qualify for a pension, if and when Congress passed such a bill. In 1900, that Assembly reorganized as the National Industrial Council and in 1903 added issues of lynching, Jim Crow laws, disfranchisement, anti-imperialism and scientific racism to its agenda, broadening its appeal to Black voters in Northern and Midwestern states. In 1904 the Council moved its headquarters to Chicago, Illinois and reorganized as the National Negro Civil Liberty Party.Atlanta (Georgia) Constitution, 27 July 1903, p.9. The first national convention of that new party convened in St. Louis, Missouri in July 1904, with plans to field candidates in states that had sizeable Black populations. Its platform included planks that dealt with disfranchisement, insufficient career opportunities for Blacks in the United States military, imperialism, public ownership of railroads, ‚Äúself- government‚Äù for the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.), lynching and pensions for ex-slaves. The convention also selected ‚ÄúCol.‚Äù William Thomas Scott of East St. Louis, Illinois as its candidate for the office of president of the United States for the 1904 election and William C. Payne a little-known teacher from Warrenton Virginia as his vice presidential running mate. The 37-year-old Payne who later founded an industrial school in Puerto Rico served as a Cabin Steward on the USS Dixie during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.\\"Others: Third Parties During The Populist Period, by Darcy Richardson, p 381.For accounts of the convention, see St. Louis (Missouri) Palladium, 16 July 1904, p.1; Washington Bee, 3 September 1904, p.1. When convention delegates had left St. Louis and when Scott was arrested and jailed for having failed to pay a fine imposed in 1901, the party's executive committee turned to Taylor (who had just stepped down as president of the National Negro Democratic League) to lead the party's ticket.Daily Illinois State Register, 14 July 1904; St. Louis (Missouri) Republic, 24 July 1904. Taylor's campaign in 1904 was unsuccessful. The party's promise to put 300 speakers on the stump to support his candidacy and its plan to field 6,000 candidates for local offices failed to materialize. No newspaper endorsed the party. State laws kept the party from listing candidates officially on election ballots. Taylor's name was unable to be added to any state ballot. The votes he received were not recorded in state records. William Scott later estimated that the party had received 65,000 votes nationwide, a number that could not be verified.The Marshfield (Wisconsin) Times, 19 February 1905, p.3; Daily Illinois State Journal, 29 January 1905, p.1. = Channing E. Phillips = At the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Channing E. Phillips was placed in nomination for President of the United States. He received 67.5 votes. = Shirley Chisholm = In 1972, Shirley Chisholm was a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination and participated in the Democratic primaries in numerous states. She campaigned in 12 states and won 28 delegates.House Resolution 97, Recognizing Contributions, Achievements, and Dedicated Work of Shirley Anita Chisholm, [Congressional Record: June 12, 2001 (House)] [Page H3019-H3025] From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:cr12jn01-85]. In the actual balloting at the 1972 Democratic National Convention, she gained additional votes from disaffected Democrats and ended with 152 delegates. = Jesse Jackson = In the 1984 presidential election and 1988 presidential election, Jesse Jackson was the first major-party black candidate to run nationwide primary campaigns and to win individual states' primaries or caucuses. He also competed as a Democrat. In 1984, he garnered around 3 million votes in the primaries and 1988, about 7 million. = Alan Keyes = In 1992, Alan Keyes received a vote for the presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention but did not campaign for President (he was the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Maryland that year). He became the first African-American candidate to run in the Republican presidential primaries in 1996 but did not win any state's primary or caucus.  21st century = Barack Obama = Barack Obama was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942‚Äì1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas; he was mostly of English descent,Obama (1995, 2004), p. 12. with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.  * His father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936‚Äì1982), was a Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo. Obama was identified as a potential candidate for president of the U.S. after his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.Zweigenhaft, R.L. and Domhoff, G.W. (2006) Diversity in the Power Elite: How it Happened, why it Matters. Rowman & Littlefield. p 140. A Democrat, Obama was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004. The distinct possibility of an African American becoming elected was realized as the Democratic primary elections got underway in early 2008.

As the Democratic Party's nominee, he went on to win the general election on November 4, 2008. On January 20, 2009, he was sworn in as the first African American president of the United States. He was re-elected to a second term as president on November 6, 2012. = Other candidates = Alan Keyes ran for president again in 2000 and in 2008. In 2004, Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton were unsuccessful candidates in the Democratic primaries. \\"Tea Party\\" Republican Herman Cain staged a run for the presidency in 2012 and received a brief surge of attention and popularity, but withdrew before any primaries were held. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson ran for the Republican nomination in the 2016 election and surged in the polls for a time in late 2015, but withdrew after the first Super Tuesday. Carson received 857,039 votes during the Republican primaries; this total represented 2.75% of the votes cast. He received the support of seven delegates at the Republican National Convention. In early 2019, U.S. Sens. Kamala HarrisKamala Harris is an American of Jamaican and Tamil Indian descent. Her mother was a Tamil Indian breast-cancer scientist who immigrated to the United States from Madras, India, in 1960. Her father is a black Jamaican who emigrated from Jamaica to the U.S. in 1961. and Cory Booker declared their presidential campaigns for the 2020 Democratic nomination within weeks of each other. Both withdrew from the race before any nominating contests were held. On December 3, 2019, Harris ended her presidential campaign, and Booker followed on January 13, 2020. Meanwhile, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick was a late entrant into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Impact  The results of African-American presidential campaigns had ranged from winning the presidency to dropping out before primary voting began. However, all of the candidates have had a political impact by making sure their voices were a part of the national debate and gaining some attention from their party's establishment. Chisholm paved the way for African American and female candidates. Her goal was to make the Democratic Party more responsive to the people. When describing her reasons for running, Chisholm said, ‚ÄúI am not the candidate of black America, although I am black and proud. I am not the candidate of the women‚Äôs movement of this country, although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of that‚Ä¶I am the candidate of the people of America.‚ÄùGutgold, Nichola D.

Print. in fourteen states and 28 delegates at the Democratic Convention in Miami.Gutgold, Nichola D. Paving the Way for Madam President, Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2006. Page 65. Print. Chisholm provided a boost to George McGovern, the eventual Democratic nominee when she campaigned for him after the convention. Chisholm's candidacy inspired many women and African Americans to make a difference in politics. As the first African American and woman to run for the nomination of a major party, Chisholm paved the way for Jesse Jackson Sr. who would be the next major African American candidate to run. For future candidates, Chisholm advised, ‚Äúthe next campaign by a woman or black must be well prepared, and well-financed; it must be planned long in advance, and it must aim at building a new coalition.‚ÄùGlasrud, Bruce A and Cary D. Wintz. African Americans and the Presidency: The Road to the White House. New York: Routledge, 2010. Page 74. Print. Jesse Jackson seemed to follow Chisholm's advice in his 1984 run for president. His 1984 campaign sought to bring together a ‚ÄúRainbow Coalition‚Äù of African Americans, Hispanics, the poor, the elderly, family farmers, and women that would challenge the conservative policies of President Ronald Reagan.Glasrud, Bruce A and Cary D. Wintz. African Americans and the Presidency: The Road to the White House. New York: Routledge, 2010. Page 119. Print. Jackson placed third out of ten candidates for the Democratic nomination with more than 3 million primary votes.Glasrud, Bruce A and Cary D. Wintz. African Americans and the Presidency: The Road to the White House. New York: Routledge, 2010. Page 120. Print. He won primaries or caucuses in four states and the District of Columbia. Jackson's campaign made progress by building on Chisholm's legacy. His 1984 campaign registered nearly 2 million voters of all racial backgrounds.Walters, Ronald W. Freedom Is Not Enough. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, Inc., 2005. Page 28. Print. By registering so many new voters, Jackson expanded the Democratic Party's base. He also inspired African American voters. Exit polls showed that nearly 12% of all Black voters were participating for the first time. Jackson's campaign won him a speaking slot at the 1984 Democratic Convention, which provided a national platform for him to present his agenda. In his 1988 campaign, Jackson increased his support to 6.9 million primary votes and won 9 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.Glasrud, Bruce A and Cary D. Wintz. African Americans and the Presidency: The Road to the White House. New York: Routledge, 2010. Page 121. Print. Sharpton and Moseley Braun followed Jackson's campaign when they ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. Moseley Braun, having already made history as the only African American woman elected to the United States Senate, became the most visible female candidate to run for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination. She advocated for expanding opportunity and encouraged women to seek positions of power. ‚ÄúNow is the time for Democrats to renew hope that we will leave [the American Dream] for the next generation in even better shape than we found it,‚Äù Moseley Braun said, ‚ÄúAnd a woman can lead the way.‚ÄùGutgold, Nichola D. Paving the Way for Madam President, Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2006. Page 157. Print. Though Moseley Braun ended her campaign in January 2004, she earned a speaking slot at the Democratic Convention in Boston where she had a national platform to advocate for equal rights.Gutgold, Nichola D. Paving the Way for Madam President, Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2006. Page 156. Print. Sharpton's 2004 campaign also focused on equal rights. In describing why he was running, Sharpton said, ‚Äú I think if we stand up for workers‚Äô rights, stand up for a peace plan worldwide, stand up for the constitutional rights of every American, those people will come back [to the Democratic Party], and those people are the majority of Americans.‚ÄùWalters, Ronald W. Freedom Is Not Enough. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, Inc., 2005. Page 139. Print. Like Moseley Braun, Sharpton's campaign allowed him to participate in the early nationally televised Democratic Party primary debates, and earned him a speaking slot at the 2004 Democratic Convention, the same year future president Barack Obama gained national attention for his convention speech. On the Republican side, Keyes first ran for the nomination in 1996 seeking to get his party to focus on social issues such as abortion. Keyes garnered a significant amount of free media during this campaign.Connolly, Ceci. ‚ÄúThe Republicans.‚Äù Washington Post 1998. Online The number of primary votes Keyes received increased from his 1996 campaign (471,716) to his 2000 campaign (914,548) but his vote total decreased in his 2008 primary run (58,977).Glasrud, Bruce A and Cary D. Wintz. African Americans and the Presidency: The Road to the White House. New York: Routledge, 2010. Page 174. Print. African American candidates have a variety of reasons for running for president. Some candidates run because they think they can win. Others run to influence the national debate by advocating for specific policy proposals. Some run for a combination of these reasons.Glasrud, Bruce A and Cary D. Wintz. African Americans and the Presidency: The Road to the White House. New York: Routledge, 2010. Page 9. Print.

Together with other endemic species, Salvia jurisicii constitutes a key component of the ‚ÄúMacedonian steppe‚Äù ecotype. Mainly due to agricultural activity, this species is considered critically endangered in its native habitat.  Description  Salvia jurisicii is a small compact plant, about tall and wide, with pinnate leaves that have linear segments. The olive-green leaves are much-branched, with hairs on the back of the ribs and leaves giving the plant a frothy appearance. The small flowers are covered in hairs and grow in closely spaced whorls that are turned upside down. The flower colour ranges from white to violet. none  Habitat  Salvia jurisicii was first described by Koshanin, in 1923, from the Ovche Pole basin in central North Macedonia. Various climatic, geological and anthropogenic factors have contributed to the development of a characteristic xerothermic, steppe-like vegetation in this region ‚Äì a so-called ‚ÄúMacedonian steppe‚Äù. The typical floristic associations for this eco-type, including its unique endemic and halophytic elements, have been described by Matevski et al. With the hill Orlovo Brdo in the adjacent Negotino municipality in North Macedonia, Ovche Pole constitutes the total area of distribution for Salvia jurisicii ‚Äì less than . In fact, up to 70% of the populations are found between the municipalities Sveti Nikole and Shtip.–ú–∏—Ü–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏, –í., –ú–∞—Ç–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏, –í. & –°–∏–¥–µ—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏, –ö.

Within this territory, populations of Salvia jurisicii have been registered in the vicinities of the villages Mustafino, Vrsakovo, and Delisinci. none none  Conservation  The construction of an irrigation canal in Ovche Pole during the 1970s contributed to the gradual expansion of farmland in this region. Previously covering most of Ovche Pole, the steppe vegetation as a result now occupies only a small fraction, on non-cultivated areas ‚Äì ‚Äúislands‚Äù, scattered across this territory. As a rule, Salvia jurisicii appears on a few non-disturbed such ‚Äúislands‚Äù exclusively. Surrounding agricultural activity impedes the natural migration processes of this species, forming geographically isolated populations. Where the non-cultivated areas are arable, these populations are especially threatened by expanding farmland and land usurpation. Another significant threat to this species stems from development projects (roads, power-lines, windmills, landfills, etc.) implemented across the Ovche Pole territory, typically in Salvia jurisicii habitats. The combination of permissive ecological surveying and poor implementation renders these projects their character as a pending threat to the future survival of this species. Other noteworthy threats include illegal plant collection, afforestation activities, and fires, which, as a traditional farming practice and due to the high aridity of Ovche Pole, are a continuing occurrence in this region. These various threats are especially problematic in Ovche Pole, where Salvia jurisicii and its floral community do not enjoy any sort of formal protection currently. What is more, little is known about the actual distribution of Salvia jurisicii in the Ovche Pole region or the extent to which past and present agricultural/developmental activities have affected it. Seeing its very limited distribution, a 1998 work by Walter and GilletWalter K. S., Gillett H. J. 1998: 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants. Compiled by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre. IUCN ‚Äì The World Conservation Union, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK. classifies this species as Rare (‚ÄúR‚Äù) on the IUCN Red List of species according to the contemporary IUCN criteria. Salvia jurisicii is not yet assessed in line with the current IUCN criteria. However, according to relevant national lists and botanical experts, the applicable category for this species is Critically Endangered (‚ÄúCR‚Äù). Because of Salvia jurisicii‚Äôs rarity, as well as the unique floral compositions in which this species appears, key locations in the extended steppe-like region have either been protected or are considered for some form of protection.

Apart from pharmaceutical, Salvia jurisicii also has ornamental value. For example, Clebsch argues that this species‚Äô horticultural properties make it especially adequate for the rock garden ‚Äì it is compact, tidy, as well as resistant to drought and winter cold. Clebsch also indicates that, in addition to the wild-type with purple flowers, there also is a white-flowering variety called ‚ÄúAlba‚Äù.

The method is named after Nikolay Krylov and Nikolay Bogoliubov. Various averaging schemes for studying problems of celestial mechanics were used since works of Gauss, Fatou, Delone, Hill. The importance of the contribution of Krylov and Bogoliubov is that they developed a general averaging approach and proved that the solution of the averaged system approximates the exact dynamics. Background Krylov‚ÄìBogoliubov averaging can be used to approximate oscillatory problems when a classical perturbation expansion fails. That is singular perturbation problems of oscillatory type, for example Einstein's correction to the perihelion precession of Mercury. Derivation The method deals with differential equations in the form : frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + k^2 u = a + varepsilon fleft(u,frac{du}{dt}right) for a smooth function f along with appropriate initial conditions. The parameter Œµ is assumed to satisfy : 0 < varepsilon ll k. If Œµ = 0 then the equation becomes that of the simple harmonic oscillator with constant forcing, and the general solution is : u(t) = frac{a}{k^2} + A sin (kt + B), where A and B are chosen to match the initial conditions. The solution to the perturbed equation (when Œµ ‚â† 0) is assumed to take the same form, but now A and B are allowed to vary with t (and Œµ). If it is also assumed that : frac{du}{dt} = kA(t) cos (kt + B(t)), then it can be shown that A and B satisfy the differential equation: : frac{d}{dt} begin{bmatrix} A  B end{bmatrix} = frac{varepsilon}{k} fleft( frac{a}{k^2} + A sin (phi), kA cos (phi)right) begin{bmatrix} cos(phi)  - frac{1}{A} sin(phi) end{bmatrix}, where phi = kt + B . Note that this equation is still exact ‚Äî no approximation has been made as yet. The method of Krylov and Bogolyubov is to note that the functions A and B vary slowly with time (in proportion to Œµ), so their dependence on phi can be (approximately) removed by averaging on the right hand side of the previous equation: : frac{d}{dt} begin{bmatrix} A_0  B_0 end{bmatrix} = frac{varepsilon}{2pi k} int_0^{2 pi} fleft( frac{a}{k^2} + A_0 sin (theta), kA_0cos (theta)right) begin{bmatrix} cos(theta)  - frac{1}{A_0} sin(theta) end{bmatrix} dtheta, where A_0 and B_0 are held fixed during the integration. After solving this (possibly) simpler set of differential equations, the Krylov‚ÄìBogolyubov averaged approximation for the original function is then given by : u_0(t,varepsilon) := frac{a}{k^2} + A_0(t,varepsilon) sin (kt + B_0(t,varepsilon)). This approximation has been shown to satisfy : left u(t,varepsilon) - u_0(t,varepsilon) right le C_1 varepsilon, where t satisfies : 0 le t le frac{C_2}{varepsilon} for some constants C_1 and C_2, independent of Œµ.

History Founded in October 20, 1910, by then president of the republic Nilo Pe√ßanha, the College of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine (ESAMV) laid the foundations of agricultural education in Brazil. The ESAMV, however, only began operating in 1913 and ended in 1934. In its place emerged three distinct institutions: the National School of Agriculture (ENA), National School of Veterinary Medicine (ENV) and the National School of Chemistry (which was incorporated in 1937 by the University of Brazil, today Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). These institutions have been crucial to overcoming the fragmentary and differentiated from existing agricultural and veterinary education throughout the nineteenth century and to create an academic reference space. In January 1944, the Rural University is established as an organ of the National Centre for Agronomic Research and Teaching (PNES) and incorporates the ENA and the Environment. The creation of ESAMV thus represents the origin of the Rural University of Brazil, today the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro.

The discovery was first announced by seismologists on January 21, 2009. It is separate from the New Madrid Seismic Zone, {} which is to the east. Haydar Al-Shukri, director of the Arkansas Earthquake Center at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, discovered the Marianna Fault after searching for a fault since 2005. The fault line is seven miles long, with dimensions. The land above the Marianna Fault is mostly cotton fields, but the presence of fertile soil with stretches of fine sand alerted seismologists to the fault's existence. It is believed that the Marianna Fault has previously experienced an earthquake that would have measured 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, and may well do so again. Al-Shukri believes that the fault was created 5,000 years ago. Previously, the predicted earthquake damage Marianna, Arkansas might receive from the more distant New Madrid Fault suffering a 7.0 earthquake was 100% architectural and content damage, half of all bridges suffering some damage, 2,955 displaced residents, and loss of phones and electricity. The capital city of Arkansas, Little Rock, would also face damage. A major natural gas pipeline is located near the fault, and could be devastated by any such earthquake. Tennessee and Mississippi would possibly be affected as well. In 2006, a letter to the Seismological Research Letters indicated the possible existence of a fault at Marianna. Sand blows in the area were similar in size to the New Madrid sand blows, giving rise to the speculation of a new fault. It was believed that the Marianna sand blows were created between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago. This followed a letter to the same journal a few months before saying that ground- penetrating radar (GPR) was being used to study \\"large elliptical sand deposits\\" near Marianna. Haydar Al-Shukri announced the discovery of the Marianna Fault on January 21, 2009. Days later, Al-Shukri stated that more funding was required to study the fault, which would include trying to establish whether or not the fault was still active. The lack of seismic equipment in the vicinity is one factor in the need for additional funding. The most recent earthquake activity in the area around the fault was located ten miles northeast of Marianna in August 2008. It measured 2.6 on the Richter scale. Few quakes have been felt in the area since 1994.

The series began with Windows 3.1, which was first sold during April 1992 as a successor to Windows 3.0. Subsequent versions were released between 1992 and 1993, notably Windows 3.11, until the series was superseded by the Windows 9x series starting in 1995 with Windows 95. During its lifespan, Windows 3.1 introduced several enhancements to the still MS-DOS-based platform, including improved system stability, expanded support for multimedia, TrueType fonts, and workgroup networking. Official support for Windows 3.1 ended on December 31, 2001. However, OEM licensing for Windows for Workgroups 3.11 on embedded systems continued to be available until November 1, 2008.  Editions =Windows 3.1= Windows 3.1, released on April 6, 1992, introduced a TrueType font system (and a set of highly legible fonts), which effectively made Windows a viable desktop publishing platform for the first time. Similar functionality was available for Windows 3.0 through Adobe Type Manager (ATM) font system from Adobe. Windows 3.1 was designed to have backward compatibility with older Windows platforms. As with Windows 3.0, version 3.1 had File Manager and Program Manager, but unlike all previous versions, Windows 3.1 cannot run in real mode. It included Minesweeper as a replacement for Reversi (though Reversi was still included in some copies). Improvements over Windows 3.0 Windows 3.1, showing some of the personalization options available Windows 3.1 dropped real mode support and required a minimum of a 286 PC with 1 MB of RAM to run. The effect of this was to increase system stability over the crash-prone Windows 3.0. Some older features were removed, like CGA graphics support (although Windows 3.0's CGA driver still worked on 3.1) and compatibility with real-mode Windows 2.x applications. Windows 3.1 can run in Standard mode if installed with the VGA display driver. When installed with high resolution/high color driver, it only operates in 386 Enhanced Mode. Truetype font support was added, providing scalable fonts to Windows applications, without having to resort to using a third-party font technology such as Adobe Type Manager. Windows 3.1 included the following fonts: Arial, Courier New, and Times New Roman, in regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic versions, as well as Symbol (a collection of scalable symbols). Truetype fonts could be scaled to any size and rotated, depending on the calling application. In 386 Enhanced Mode, windowed DOS applications gained the ability for users to manipulate menus and other objects in the program using the Windows mouse pointer, provided that a DOS application supported mice. A few DOS applications, such as late releases of Microsoft Word, could access Windows Clipboard. Windows' own drivers couldn't work directly with DOS applications; hardware such as mice required a DOS driver to be loaded before starting Windows. Icons could be dragged and dropped for the first time, in addition to having a more detailed appearance. A file could be dragged onto the Print Manager icon and the file would be printed by the current printer, assuming it was associated with an application capable of printing, such as a word processor. Alternatively, the file could be dragged out of File Manager and dropped onto an application icon or window for processing. While Windows 3.0 was limited to 16 MB maximum memory, Windows 3.1 can access a theoretical 4 GB in 386 Enhanced Mode. The actual practical ceiling is 256 MB. However, no single process can use more than 16 MB. File Manager was significantly improved over Windows 3.0. Multimedia support was enhanced over what was available in Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions and available to all Windows 3.1 users. Windows 3.1 was available via 720 KB, 1.2 MB, and 1.44 MB floppy distributions. It was also the first version of Windows to be distributed on CD-ROM ‚Äì although this was more common for Windows for Workgroups 3.11, which typically came with MS-DOS 6.22 on one CD. Installed size on the hard disk was between 10 MB and 15 MB. 32-bit disk access (386 Enhanced Mode only) brought improved performance by using a 32-bit protected mode driver instead of the 16-bit BIOS functions (which necessitate Windows temporarily dropping out of protected mode). Windows 3.1's calendar uses the .cal filename extension. Windows 3.1 also introduced the Windows Registry, a centralized database that can store configuration information and settings for various operating systems components and applications. Windows 3.1 was the first version that could also launch Windows programs via Command.com. = Windows 3.1 for Central and Eastern Europe = A special version named Windows 3.1 for Central and Eastern Europe was released that allowed use of Cyrillic and had fonts with diacritical marks characteristic of Central and Eastern European languages. Microsoft introduced its own code page (Windows-1250) and supported its use in violation of many countries' ISO standards (e.g., the official Polish codepage is ISO-8859-2, which was ignored by Microsoft but is supported by contemporary Internet Explorer versions). Similarly, Microsoft also released Windows 3.1J with support for Japanese, which shipped 1.46 million copies in its first year on the market (1993) in Japan. = Modular Windows = Modular Windows is a special version of Windows 3.1, designed to run on Tandy Video Information System. = Windows 3.11 = Windows 3.11 was released on November 8, 1993. It did not add many feature improvements over Windows 3.1; it primarily contained bug fixes, but was considered a significant improvement because of those fixes, contributing to the operating system's popularity. Microsoft replaced all retail versions of Windows 3.1 with Windows 3.11 and provided a free upgrade to anyone who currently owned Windows 3.1. = Windows 3.2 = On November 22, 1993, Microsoft released a Simplified Chinese version of Windows for the Chinese market. A year later, an update was released, which identified itself as Windows 3.2. Thus, Windows 3.2 is an updated version of the Chinese version of Windows 3.1. The update was limited to this language version, as it only fixed issues related to the complex input system for the Chinese language. Windows 3.2 was generally sold by computer manufacturers with a ten-disk version of MS-DOS that also had Simplified Chinese characters in basic output and some translated utilities.  Windows for Workgroups  Network capabilities of Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Windows for Workgroups is an extension that allowed users to share their resources and to request those of others without a centralized authentication server. It used SMB protocol over NetBIOS. = Windows for Workgroups 3.1 = Windows for Workgroups 3.1 (originally codenamed Winball and later Sparta), released in October 1992, is an extended version of Windows 3.1 that features native networking support. It comes with SMB file sharing support via NetBIOS- based NBF and IPX network transport protocols and introduces the Hearts card game and VSHARE.386, a VxD version of SHARE.EXE (a terminate-and-stay-resident program). =Windows for Workgroups 3.11= Windows for Workgroups 3.11 (originally codenamed Snowball) was released on August 11, 1993, and shipped in November 1993, by Microsoft. It supported 32-bit file access, full 32-bit network redirectors, and VCACHE.386 file cache, shared between them. WFW 3.11 dropped standard mode support and requires a 386 machine to run. A Winsock package was required to support TCP/IP networking in Windows 3.x. Usually third-party packages were used, but in August 1994, Microsoft released an add- on package (codenamed Wolverine) that provided TCP/IP support in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Wolverine was a 32-bit stack (accessible from 16-bit Windows applications via WinSock Thunk), which gave it superior performance to most of the third-party TCP/IP Windows stacks available. However, it was only compatible with Windows for Workgroups 3.11, and lacked support for dial-up. Wolverine stack was an early version of the TCP/IP stack that would later ship with Windows 95, and provided an early testbed for the 16-to-32-bit compatibility layer that was crucial to Windows 95's success. Following the release of MS-DOS 6.22 in 1994, WFW 3.11 largely replaced Windows 3.1 for OEM installations on new PCs due to its improved capabilities and greater stability.  Windows 95  A successor to Windows 3.1, the MS-DOS-based Windows 95 was released to manufacturing on August 15, 1995, and generally to retail on August 24, 1995. Windows 95 merged Microsoft's formerly separate MS- DOS and Microsoft Windows products, and featured significant improvements over its predecessor, most notably in the graphical user interface (GUI) and in its simplified \\"plug-and-play\\" features. There were also major changes made to the core components of the operating system, such as moving from a mainly cooperatively multitasked 16-bit architecture to a 32-bit preemptive multitasking architecture, at least when running only 32-bit protected mode applications. OEM Service Release 2.5 (4.0.950 C) of Windows 95 was released on November 26, 1997.  Add-ons = Video for Windows = Video for Windows was first introduced in November 1992 as a reaction to Apple Computer's QuickTime technology which added digital video to Macintosh. Costing around $200, the software included editing and encoding programs for use with video input boards. A runtime version for viewing videos only was also made available. Originally released as a free add-on to Windows 3.1 and Windows 3.11, it then became an integral component of Windows 95 and later. Like QuickTime there were three components in Video for Windows. The technology introduced a file format designed to store digital video, Audio Video Interleave (AVI). The technology provided an application programming interface that allowed Windows software developers to add the ability to play or manipulate digital video to their own applications. Lastly, it included a suite of software for playing and manipulating digital video. = Windows for Pen Computing = Windows for Pen Computing was a series of Microsoft-produced add-ons for Microsoft Windows versions in the mid-1990s with additional tools for tablet PCs. Windows for Pen Computing (also known as Pen Windows and W4PC) was developed as Microsoft's pen computing response to PenPoint OS by GO Corporation. Windows for Pen Computing was rendered obsolete by Tablet PC support for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition in 2002. = Win32s = Windows 3.1x was given limited compatibility with the then-new 32-bit Windows API used by Windows NT by another add-on package, Win32s. There was a rumor that Microsoft did not want to increase any mainstream Windows 3.1x version to something like \\"Windows 3.2\\" because it could be confused with the Win32 API or otherwise distract consumers from upgrading to a \\"real 32-bit OS\\", though Windows NT 3.1 and 3.5 were both 32-bit operating systems that looked similar in appearance. A game called FreeCell was included for testing the new Win32s functions. = WinG = To entice game manufacturers to move from DOS to Windows, Microsoft provided a first attempt at high-speed graphics and animation capabilities for Windows 3.1x, introduced in September 1994. Windows' GDI capabilities were originally designed with static images in mind, allowing only for write-only graphics calls. WinG provided a device-independent interface to graphics and printer hardware, and allowed programs to have both read and write capabilities to the WinGDC (WinG device context).  Applications  Windows 3.1x introduced new possibilities for applications, especially multimedia applications. During this era, Microsoft developed a new range of software that was implemented on this operating environment, called Microsoft Home, Microsoft Bob being one of the programs. As the first versions of Windows to enjoy major commercial success and software support, Windows 3.1 and WFW 3.11 quickly replaced DOS as the platform for application software on PC compatibles. Multimedia software (especially games) proliferated, although many games continued to run on DOS until Windows 95. = Program Manager = Program Manager was included in all versions of Windows from version 3.0 until Windows XP Service Pack 1. A non-operable icon library named progman.exe is included in Windows XP Service Pack 2, and the file was removed entirely from Windows Vista. = Internet Explorer = Internet Explorer 2 through Internet Explorer 5 were released for Windows 3.1.  Promotion and reception  Microsoft began a television advertising campaign for the first time on March 1, 1992. The advertisements, developed by Ogilvy & Mather, were designed to introduce a broader audience to Windows. Internet Archive Windows 3.1 was shipped worldwide on April 6, 1992, and reached three million sales two months later. The year of Windows 3.1's release was successful for Microsoft, which was named the \\"Most Innovative Company Operating in the U.S.\\" by Fortune magazine, while Windows became the most widely used GUI-based operating environment. Internet Archive  Controversy = DR-DOS compatibility = The installer to the beta release used code that checked whether it was running on Microsoft-licensed DOS or another DOS operating system (such as DR- DOS). The code ran several functional tests that succeeded on MS-DOS and IBM PC DOS, but resulted in a technical support message on competing operating systems. If the system was not MS-DOS, the installer would fail. Digital Research, who owned DR-DOS, released a patch within weeks to allow the installer to continue. Microsoft disabled, but did not remove, this warning message for the final release of Windows 3.1. When Caldera bought DR-DOS from Novell, they brought a lawsuit against Microsoft over the AARD code, which was later settled with Microsoft paying $280 million.  Legacy  Windows 3.x was superseded by the release of Windows 95 in August 1995. Microsoft officially dropped support for all 16-bit versions of Windows on November 1, 2008. Windows 3.1 found a niche market as an embedded operating system after becoming obsolete in the PC world. As of November 2008, both Virgin Atlantic and Qantas employed it for some of the onboard entertainment systems on long- distance jets. It also sees continued use as an embedded OS in retail cash tills. On July 9, 2008, it was announced that Windows for Workgroups 3.11 for the embedded devices channel would no longer be made available for OEM distribution as of November 1, 2008. On July 14, 2013, Linux kernel version 3.11 was officially named \\"Linux For Workgroups\\" as a tongue-in-cheek reference to \\"Windows for Workgroups 3.11\\".

It was first published in Strand Magazine in 1913. Synopsis The story is told through a blood-stained notebook discovered on the edge of a farm in Withyham. The notebook is written by a Mr. Joyce-Armstrong, and the first two and last pages are missing; the notebook is thus dubbed the \\"Joyce-Armstrong Fragment\\". Joyce-Armstrong, a brave aviator, had been curious over the deaths of certain pilots who tried to break the current height record of 30,000 feet. Recent casualties involve some strange deaths ‚Äì one, Hay Connor, died after landing while he was still in his plane, while another, Myrtle, was discovered with his head missing. Joyce-Armstrong speculates that the answer to these deaths may be the result of what he calls \\"air-jungles\\": > There are jungles of the upper air [‚Ä¶] One of them lies over the Pau- > Biarritz district of France. Another is just over my head as I write here in > my house in Wiltshire. I rather think there is a third in the Homburg- > Wiesbaden district. Joyce-Armstrong takes his monoplane to a height of 40,000 feet and is nearly hit by three meteors. It is then that he learns that his speculations are right: entire ecosystems (air-jungles) exist high in the atmosphere, and are inhabited by huge, gelatinous, semi-solid creatures. After going through a flock of animals superficially resembling jellyfish and snakes, Joyce- Armstrong is attacked by a more solid-looking but amorphous creature with a beak and tentacles, from which he narrowly escapes. He then returns to the ground. The aviator writes he will be going up again to the air-jungle to bring back proof of his discoveries, but here the fragment ends, save for one last sentence which reads: > \\"Forty-three thousand feet. I shall never see earth again. They are beneath > me, three of them. God help me; it is a dreadful death to die!\\" The narrative outside the notebook then explains that Joyce-Armstrong has been missing and that his monoplane was discovered in a wreck on the border of Kent and Sussex. Collections The story has appeared in a number of collections, the earliest being Danger! and Other Stories (1918), as well as in more general collections like Volume 5 of The Road to Science Fiction. Adaptations The story formed a part of Forgotten Futures III.

She has been dubbed \\"an indie sensation\\" by Toronto Life Magazine; \\"the wunderkind of Canadian theatre\\" by CBC Radio; \\"irritatingly talented\\" by the now defunct Eye Weekly; and the \\"dark angel of Toronto theatre\\" by Toronto Star. The National Post, The Globe and Mail, and Now Magazine have all hailed Hannah as \\"Canada‚Äôs Hottest Young Playwright\\". She is best known for her plays East of Berlin, The Russian Play, and This Is War. Life and career Today based in Toronto and Halifax, she was raised in Ottawa. Her father, Allan Moscovitch, is a social policy professor at Carleton University. Her mother, Julie White, is a labour researcher. Both have long been active in left wing politics. Moscovitch's father is Jewish, of Romanian and Ukrainian background, while her mother is from a Christian background (of English and Irish ancestry). Moscovitch was \\"raised as an atheist\\", and has said that there is \\"implicitly Jewish sensibility\\" to her plays. She studied at the National Theatre School in the acting stream. Moscovitch gained considerable notice for two short plays written for Toronto's SummerWorks. In 2005 she presented Essay, a play about gender politics in modern academia. The next year at the festival The Russian Play premiered, a romance set in Stalinist Russia. Both were well received by critics and audiences. In 2007 her first full-length play, East of Berlin, premiered at the Tarragon Theatre. The play focuses on the legacy of the Holocaust on the children of those involved. The main character is the son of a Nazi war criminal who grows up in Paraguay. He eventually travels to Berlin and meets the daughter of an Auschwitz survivor. The play was acclaimed for its complex subject, humour, and characters and was also a popular success, returning to Tarragon in winter 2009 and 2010. 2013 saw the premiere of This Is War, a play depicting the lives of Canadian troops in Afghanistan. This Is War won multiple awards with one reviewer writing \\"Moscovitch shines a light on massive issues like sexual harassment within the military without making her play a morality tale or expos√©. It‚Äôs a story about four good people in a bad place and all the gray area that that produces.\\" In 2015, Moscovitch wrote the play Infinity about a physicist who becomes involved in a love story while contemplating the nature of time. She collaborated with Lee Smolin to lend verisimilitude to some of the theoretical ideas. Hannah Moscovitch has written a play for young audiences called In This World. This play, which premiered in March 2009 through Montreal's Youtheatre, deals with violence and sexual and racial politics. Moscovitch's other writing for the stage includes Little One, The Children‚Äôs Republic and The Huron Bride (a ghost story). Her plays have been produced across Canada, including at the Magnetic North Theatre Festival, Ottawa's Great Canadian Theatre Company, The National Arts Centre, Toronto's Factory Theatre, Edmonton's Theatre Network, the Manitoba Theatre Centre, Vancouver's Firehall Arts Centre, and the Alberta Theatre Projects. Moscovitch is currently playwright-in-residence at Tarragon Theatre and was previously a contributing writer to the CBC radio drama series Afghanada (2006-2011).

Center Moriches Union Free School District, 508 U.S. 384 (1993), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States concerning whether the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment was offended by a school district that refused to allow a church access to school premises to show films dealing with family and child-rearing issues faced by parents. In a unanimous decision,There were nine votes for the result, but the court split 6-3 on the reasoning. (Justices Kennedy and Scalia filed opinions concurring in the judgment; Justice Thomas joined Scalia's opinion) the court concluded that it was. Summary of case The case arose in New York, where state law authorized school boards to promulgate regulations for the use of school property outside of school hours. The Lamb's Chapel evangelical church sought to show a series of family lectures by James Dobson on school property. The local board refused on the grounds that the film \\"appear[ed] to be church related,\\" 508 U.S. at 389, whereafter the church sued. The district court rejected their claims, finding that the school was a limited public forum, and that because \\"the District had not opened its facilities to organizations similar to Lamb's Chapel for religious purposes, ... the denial ... was viewpoint neutral and, hence, not a violation of the Freedom of Speech Clause.\\" Id. at 389-90. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and the matter came before the Supreme Court. Writing for the court, Justice Byron White observed that the courts below missed the point: \\"That all religions and all uses for religious purposes are treated alike ... does not answer the critical question whether it discriminates on the basis of to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.\\" The subject of the films was permitted; the viewpoint was the problem: \\"[the] exhibition was denied solely because the series dealt with the subject from a religious standpoint.\\" This constituted viewpoint discrimination and could not withstand First Amendment scrutiny. Three justices concurred in the judgment. The Court had, in passing, invoked the landmark Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) case, which remained good law, to the consternation of some of the concurring justices. Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote: > Like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its > grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed and buried, Lemon > stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence once again, frightening the > little children and school attorneys of Center Moriches Union Free School > District.

It is a specific application of the number needed to treat metric (NNT) that incorporates the implications of herd immunity. Derivation NNV is the statistical inverse of incidence i.e. 1/incidence. In other words, in case of the vaccination for a disease with incidence of 1 per 1000, the NNV is 1000. For example, one study reported a number needed to vaccinate of 5206 for invasive pneumococcal disease. Significance In order to determine a NNV, it is necessary to identify a specific population and a defined endpoint, because these can vary: * Tuberculosis vaccination rates are much higher in Europe than in the United States. * When evaluating a vaccine against chickenpox, it is necessary to define whether or not the endpoint would include shingles due to reactivation. * If evaluating a HIV vaccine, the NNV may vary depending upon the expected standard of care in the absence of a vaccine, which may vary from continent to continent. * If an infectious disease is acute and highly lethal, there may be large differences in the impact of the vaccine upon incidence and prevalence. Despite the limitations, the NNV can serve as a useful resource. For example, it can be used to report the results of computer simulations of varying vaccination strategies.

There were multiple names for this product's family members: Windows/286, Windows 386, and Windows 2.01 and Windows 2.1x. Features Windows 2.0 allowed application windows to overlap each other, unlike its predecessor Windows 1.0, which could display only tiled windows. Windows 2.0 also introduced more sophisticated keyboard-shortcuts and the terminology of \\"Minimize\\" and \\"Maximize\\", as opposed to \\"Iconize\\" and \\"Zoom\\" in Windows 1.0. The basic window setup introduced here would last through Windows 3.1. New features in Windows 2.0 included support for the new capabilities of the 80386 CPU (in some versions - see Editions), 16-color VGA graphics, and EMS memory support. It was also the last version of Windows that did not require a hard disk. With the improved speed, reliability and usability, computers now started becoming a part of daily life for some workers. Desktop icons and use of keyboard shortcuts helped to speed up work. The Windows 2.x EGA, VGA, and Tandy drivers notably provided a workaround in Windows 3.0 for users who wanted color graphics on 8086 machines (a feature that version normally did not support). IBM licensed Windows's GUI for OS/2 as Presentation Manager, and the two companies stated that it and Windows 2.0 would be almost identical.  Editions  Windows 2.0x came in two different variants with different names and CPU support. The first variant simply said \\"Windows\\" on the box, with a version number on the back distinguishing it from Windows 1.x. The second was billed on the box as \\"Windows/386\\" This distinction continued to Windows 2.1x, where the naming convention changed to Windows/286 and Windows/386 to clarify that they were different versions of the same product. = Windows = The base version of Windows 2.0 uses the HMA feature of the 80286 CPU to increase the memory available to Windows programs. It introduced the HIMEM.SYS DOS driver for this purpose. While this variant was renamed Windows/286 in the 2.1 versions, both would run on an 8088 or 8086 processor, simply without HMA support. Windows 2.0 also includes support for EMS, which works on 8086 and 8088 CPUs. The segmented nature of 16-bit Windows programs is quite suited to the usage of EMS, as portions of code and data can be made visible in the first megabyte of memory accessible to real-mode programs only when the program using them is given control. Microsoft encouraged users to configure their computers with only 256KB of main memory, leaving the address space from 256-640KB available for dynamic mapping of EMS memory. =Windows/386= The 1987-released Windows/386 was much more advanced than its 286 sibling. It introduced a protected mode kernel, above which the GUI and applications run as a virtual 8086 mode task. Win 2.0's Windows/386 had fully preemptive multitasking, and allowed several MS-DOS programs to run in parallel in \\"virtual 8086\\" CPU mode, rather than always suspending background applications. (Windows applications could already run in parallel through cooperative multitasking.) With the exception of a few kilobytes of overhead, each DOS application could use any available low memory before Windows was started. Windows/386 ran Windows applications in a single Virtual 8086 box, with EMS emulation. In contrast, Windows 3.0 in standard or enhanced mode ran Windows applications in 16 bits protected mode segments. Windows/386 also provided EMS emulation, using the memory management features of the 80386 to make RAM beyond 640k behave like the banked memory previously only supplied by add-in cards and used by popular DOS applications. (By overwriting the WIN200.BIN file with COMMAND.COM, it is possible to use the EMS emulation in DOS without starting the Windows GUI.) There was no support for disk-based virtual memory, so multiple DOS programs had to fit inside the available physical memory; therefore, Microsoft suggested buying additional memory and cards if necessary. Neither of these versions worked with DOS memory managers like CEMM or QEMM or with DOS extenders, which have their own extended memory management and run in protected mode as well. This was remedied in version 3.0, which is compatible with Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) in \\"standard mode\\" and with DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) in \\"386 enhanced\\" mode (all versions of Windows from 3.0 to 98 exploit a loophole in EMM386 to set up protected mode). Windows 3.0 also had the capability of using the DWEMM Direct Write Enhanced Memory Module. This is what enables the far faster and more sleek graphical user interface, as well as true extended memory support. BYTE in 1989 listed Windows/386 as among the \\"Distinction\\" winners of the BYTE Awards, describing it as \\"serious competition for OS/2\\" as it \\"taps into the power of the 80386\\". =Windows 2.1x=Application support The first Windows versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel ran on Windows 2.0. Third-party developer support for Windows increased substantially with this version (some shipped the Windows Runtime software with their applications, for customers who had not purchased the full version of Windows). However, most developers still maintained DOS versions of their applications, as Windows users were still a distinct minority of their market. Windows 2.0 was still very dependent on the DOS system and it still hadn't passed the 1 megabyte mark in terms of memory. Stewart Alsop II predicted in January 1988 that \\"Any transition to a graphical environment on IBM-style machines is bound to be maddeningly slow and driven strictly by market forces\\", because the GUI had \\"serious deficiencies\\" and users had to switch to DOS for many tasks. There were some applications that shipped with Windows 2.0. They are: *CALC.EXE ‚Äì a calculator *CALENDAR.EXE ‚Äì calendaring software *CARDFILE.EXE ‚Äì a personal information manager *CLIPBRD.EXE ‚Äì software for viewing the contents of the clipboard *CLOCK.EXE ‚Äì a clock *CONTROL.EXE ‚Äì the system utility responsible for configuring Windows 2.0 *CVTPAINT.EXE - Converted paint files to the 2.x format *MSDOS.EXE ‚Äì a simple file manager *NOTEPAD.EXE ‚Äì a text editor *PAINT.EXE ‚Äì a raster graphics editor that allows users to paint and edit pictures interactively on the computer screen *PIFEDIT.EXE ‚Äì a program information file editor that defines how a DOS program should behave inside Windows *REVERSI.EXE ‚Äì a computer game of reversi *SPOOLER.EXE ‚Äì the print spooler of Windows, a program that manages and maintains a queue of documents to be printed, sending them to the printer as soon as the printer is ready *TERMINAL.EXE ‚Äì a terminal emulator *WRITE.EXE ‚Äì a simple word processor Legal conflict with Apple On March 17, 1988, Apple Inc. filed a lawsuit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, accusing them of violating copyrights Apple held on the Macintosh System Software. Apple claimed the \\"look and feel\\" of the Macintosh operating system, taken as a whole, was protected by copyright and that Windows 2.0 violated this copyright by having the same icons. The judge ruled in favor of Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft on all but 10 of the 189 graphical user interface elements that Apple sued on, and the court found the remaining 10 GUI elements could not be copyrighted.  Windows 2.1x  The successor to Windows 2.0, called Windows 2.1x was officially released in the United States and Canada on May 27, 1988. The final entry in the 2.x series, Windows 2.11, was released in March 1989.

It was established by the Episcopal Conference of Malawi on October 16, 2004, and officially opened its doors in 2006. The University has seven faculties, namely Education, Law, Theology, Social Sciences, Science, Commerce and, Nursing and Midwifery. The Catholic Church has been involved in education in Malawi for over a hundred years. Its first school was established on 2 February 1902 at Nzama in Ntcheu District by three Montfort Missionaries: Fr. Pierre Bourget SMM (Superior), Fr. Augustine Prezeau SMM (who later became the first Apostolic Prefect of Shire) and Fr. Anton Winnen SMM, in charge of the first Catholic primary school in the country which he used to call ‚ÄòThe University of Nzama‚Äô. The ‚ÄòUniversity‚Äô started with eight students ‚Äì men, women, and children aged between six and sixty years. In spite of so many setbacks, by the late 1950s, the Catholic Church ran 1249 of the 2884 primary schools in Nyasaland (Malawi) and of the 24 grant-aided secondary schools and teacher training colleges, 13 were run by the Catholic Church. Just as the Church‚Äôs achievements at primary school level necessitated the establishment of Catholic secondary schools in the fifties, its achievements at the secondary school level called for the establishment of a Catholic University. It is against this background that on 15 September 2004, the Bishops sent the Chairperson for Education to meet the then Minister of Education to, among other things, alert him about the Episcopal Conference of Malawi‚Äôs intention to request the FIC Brothers to turn Montfort Teachers Training College into a Catholic University. The then Minister of Education, Hon. Yusuf Mwawa, warmly welcomed the idea. In addition, he asked the then Principal Secretary for Education (Dr S.A. Hau) to arrange that one or two officers be included in the taskforce of the Catholic University to assist in the establishment of the University. This was indeed done and a number of task force meetings were attended by a representative of the Principal Secretary. By God‚Äôs grace and in partnership with the Malawi Government, through the Ministry of Education, on 28 October 2006 it pleased the State President, late Professor Bingu wa Mutharika to officially open The Catholic University of Malawi. Since then, student enrolment has steadily increased from 129 to 4000 plus students by 2020. The University was accredited in January 2009. In seven years of its existence, CUNIMA has officiated three graduations. The University has entered into an affiliation agreement with the Inter Congregational Institute (ICI), and there are proposals of affiliation with other institutions of higher learning namely, Kachebere and St Peter‚Äôs Major Seminaries.

Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC DOS, and some operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as \\"DOS\\" (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system. IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs. Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993, with recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax, and capabilities. During its lifetime, several competing products were released for the x86 platform, and MS-DOS went through eight versions, until development ceased in 2000. Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system, but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly evolving computer architectures. Ultimately, it was the key product in Microsoft's development from a programming language company to a diverse software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. It is a flexible operating system, and consumes negligible installation space. History MS- DOS was a renamed form of 86-DOS owned by Seattle Computer Products, written by Tim Paterson. Development of 86-DOS took only six weeks, as it was basically a clone of Digital Research's CP/M (for 8080/Z80 processors), ported to run on 8086 processors and with two notable differences compared to CP/M: an improved disk sector buffering logic, and the introduction of FAT12 instead of the CP/M filesystem. This first version was shipped in August 1980. Microsoft, which needed an operating system for the IBM Personal Computer, hired Tim Paterson in May 1981 and bought 86-DOS 1.10 for in July of the same year. Microsoft kept the version number, but renamed it MS-DOS. They also licensed MS-DOS 1.10/1.14 to IBM, which, in August 1981, offered it as PC DOS 1.0 as one of three operating systems for the IBM 5150, or the IBM PC. Within a year, Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to over 70 other companies. It was designed to be an OS that could run on any 8086-family computer. Each computer would have its own distinct hardware and its own version of MS-DOS, similar to the situation that existed for CP/M, and with MS-DOS emulating the same solution as CP/M to adapt for different hardware platforms. To this end, MS-DOS was designed with a modular structure with internal device drivers (the DOS BIOS), minimally for primary disk drives and the console, integrated with the kernel and loaded by the boot loader, and installable device drivers for other devices loaded and integrated at boot time. The OEM would use a development kit provided by Microsoft to build a version of MS-DOS with their basic I/O drivers and a standard Microsoft kernel, which they would typically supply on disk to end users along with the hardware. Thus, there were many different versions of \\"MS-DOS\\" for different hardware, and there is a major distinction between an IBM-compatible (or ISA) machine and an MS-DOS [compatible] machine. Some machines, like the Tandy 2000, were MS-DOS compatible but not IBM- compatible, so they could run software written exclusively for MS-DOS without dependence on the peripheral hardware of the IBM PC architecture. This design would have worked well for compatibility, if application programs had only used MS-DOS services to perform device I/O, and indeed the same design philosophy is embodied in Windows NT (see Hardware Abstraction Layer). However, in MS-DOS's early days, the greater speed attainable by programs through direct control of hardware was of particular importance, especially for games, which often pushed the limits of their contemporary hardware. Very soon an IBM-compatible architecture became the goal, and before long all 8086-family computers closely emulated IBM's hardware, and only a single version of MS-DOS for a fixed hardware platform was needed for the market. This version is the version of MS-DOS that is discussed here, as the dozens of other OEM versions of \\"MS-DOS\\" were only relevant to the systems they were designed for, and in any case were very similar in function and capability to some standard version for the IBM PC‚Äîoften the same-numbered version, but not always, since some OEMs used their own proprietary version numbering schemes (e.g. labeling later releases of MS-DOS 1.x as 2.0 or vice versa)‚Äîwith a few notable exceptions. Microsoft omitted multi-user support from MS-DOS because Microsoft's Unix-based operating system, Xenix, was fully multi-user. The company planned, over time, to improve MS-DOS so it would be almost indistinguishable from single-user Xenix, or XEDOS, which would also run on the Motorola 68000, Zilog Z8000, and the LSI-11; they would be upwardly compatible with Xenix, which Byte in 1983 described as \\"the multi-user MS-DOS of the future\\". Microsoft advertised MS-DOS and Xenix together, listing the shared features of its \\"single-user OS\\" and \\"the multi-user, multi-tasking, UNIX-derived operating system\\", and promising easy porting between them. After the breakup of the Bell System, however, AT&T; Computer Systems started selling UNIX System V. Believing that it could not compete with AT&T; in the Unix market, Microsoft abandoned Xenix, and in 1987 transferred ownership of Xenix to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). On March 25, 2014, Microsoft made the code to SCP MS-DOS 1.25 and a mixture of Altos MS-DOS 2.11 and TeleVideo PC DOS 2.11 available to the public under the Microsoft Research License Agreement, which makes the code source-available, but not open source as defined by Open Source Initiative or Free Software Foundation standards. (NB. While the publishers claim this would be MS-DOS 1.1 and 2.0, it actually is SCP MS-DOS 1.25 and a mixture of Altos MS-DOS 2.11 and TeleVideo PC DOS 2.11.) (NB. While the author claims this would be MS-DOS 1.1 and 2.0, it actually is SCP MS-DOS 1.25 and a mixture of Altos MS-DOS 2.11 and TeleVideo PC DOS 2.11.) (NB. While the author claims this would be MS-DOS 1.1 and 2.0, it actually is SCP MS-DOS 1.25 and a mixture of Altos MS-DOS 2.11 and TeleVideo PC DOS 2.11.) Microsoft would later re-license the code under the MIT License on September 28, 2018, making these versions free software. As an April Fool's Day joke in 2015, Microsoft Mobile launched a Windows Phone application called MS-DOS Mobile which was presented as a new mobile operating system and worked similar to MS-DOS. Versions Microsoft licensed or released versions of MS-DOS under different names like Lifeboat Associates \\"Software Bus 86\\" a.k.a. SB- DOS, COMPAQ-DOS, NCR-DOS or Z-DOS before it eventually enforced the MS-DOS name for all versions but the IBM one, which was originally called \\"IBM Personal Computer DOS\\", later shortened to IBM PC DOS. (Competitors released compatible DOS systems such as DR DOS and PTS-DOS that could also run DOS applications.) In the former Eastern bloc, MS-DOS derivatives named DCP () 3.20 and 3.30 existed in the late 1980s. They were produced by the East German electronics manufacturer VEB Robotron.

The VER internal command reports the Windows version 4.90.3000, or 5.1 when created from newer versions of Windows. Applications requesting the version through the API would report version 8.00. Microsoft DOS was released through the OEM channel, until Digital Research released DR-DOS 5.0 as a retail upgrade. With PC DOS 5.00.1, the IBM-Microsoft agreement started to end, and IBM entered the retail DOS market with IBM DOS 5.00.1, 5.02, 6.00 and PC DOS 6.1, 6.3, 7, 2000 and 7.1. =Localized versions= Japanese MS-DOS 6.2/V Localized versions of MS-DOS existed for different markets. While Western issues of MS-DOS evolved around the same set of tools and drivers just with localized message languages and differing sets of supported codepages and keyboard layouts, some language versions were considerably different from Western issues and were adapted to run on localized PC hardware with additional BIOS services not available in Western PCs, support multiple hardware codepages for displays and printers, support DBCS, alternative input methods and graphics output. Affected issues include Japanese (DOS/V), Korean, Arabic (ADOS 3.3/5.0), Hebrew (HDOS 3.3/5.0), Russian (RDOS 4.01/5.0) as well as some other Eastern European versions of DOS. Competition The original MS-DOS advertisement in 1981. On microcomputers based on the Intel 8086 and 8088 processors, including the IBM PC and clones, the initial competition to the PC DOS/MS-DOS line came from Digital Research, whose CP/M operating system had inspired MS-DOS. In fact, there remains controversy as to whether QDOS was more or less plagiarized from early versions of CP/M code. Digital Research released CP/M-86 a few months after MS-DOS, and it was offered as an alternative to MS-DOS and Microsoft's licensing requirements, but at a higher price. Executable programs for CP/M-86 and MS-DOS were not interchangeable with each other; many applications were sold in both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 versions until MS-DOS became preponderant (later Digital Research operating systems could run both MS-DOS and CP/M-86 software). MS-DOS originally supported the simple .COM, which was modeled after a similar but binary incompatible format known from CP/M-80. CP/M-86 instead supported a relocatable format using the file extension .CMD to avoid name conflicts with CP/M-80 and MS-DOS .COM files. MS-DOS version 1.0 added a more advanced relocatable .EXE executable file format. Most of the machines in the early days of MS-DOS had differing system architectures and there was a certain degree of incompatibility, and subsequently vendor lock-in. Users who began using MS-DOS with their machines were compelled to continue using the version customized for their hardware, or face trying to get all of their proprietary hardware and software to work with the new system. In the business world the 808x-based machines that MS-DOS was tied to faced competition from the Unix operating system which ran on many different hardware architectures. Microsoft itself sold a version of Unix for the PC called Xenix. In the emerging world of home users, a variety of other computers based on various other processors were in serious competition with the IBM PC: the Apple II, early Apple Macintosh, the Commodore 64 and others did not use the 808x processor; many 808x machines of different architectures used custom versions of MS-DOS. At first all these machines were in competition. In time the IBM PC hardware configuration became dominant in the 808x market as software written to communicate directly with the PC hardware without using standard operating system calls ran much faster, but on true PC-compatibles only. Non-PC- compatible 808x machines were too small a market to have fast software written for them alone, and the market remained open only for IBM PCs and machines that closely imitated their architecture, all running either a single version of MS-DOS compatible only with PCs, or the equivalent IBM PC DOS. Most clones cost much less than IBM-branded machines of similar performance, and became widely used by home users, while IBM PCs had a large share of the business computer market. Microsoft and IBM together began what was intended as the follow-on to MS-DOS/PC DOS, called OS/2. When OS/2 was released in 1987, Microsoft began an advertising campaign announcing that \\"DOS is Dead\\" and stating that version 4 was the last full release. OS/2 was designed for efficient multi-tasking (as was standard in operating systems since 1963) and offered a number of advanced features that had been designed together with similar look and feel; it was seen as the legitimate heir to the \\"kludgy\\" DOS platform. MS-DOS had grown in spurts, with many significant features being taken or duplicated from Microsoft's other products and operating systems. MS- DOS also grew by incorporating, by direct licensing or feature duplicating, the functionality of tools and utilities developed by independent companies, such as Norton Utilities, PC Tools (Microsoft Anti-Virus), QEMM expanded memory manager, Stacker disk compression, and others. During the period when Digital Research was competing in the operating system market some computers, like Amstrad PC1512, were sold with floppy disks for two operating systems (only one of which could be used at a time), MS-DOS and CP/M-86 or a derivative of it. Digital Research produced DOS Plus, which was compatible with MS-DOS 2.11, supported CP/M-86 programs, had additional features including multi-tasking, and could read and write disks in CP/M and MS-DOS format. While OS/2 was under protracted development, Digital Research released the MS-DOS compatible DR DOS 5.0, which included features only available as third-party add-ons for MS-DOS. Unwilling to lose any portion of the market, Microsoft responded by announcing the \\"pending\\" release of MS-DOS 5.0 in May 1990. This effectively killed most DR DOS sales until the actual release of MS-DOS 5.0 in June 1991. Digital Research brought out DR DOS 6.0, which sold well until the \\"pre-announcement\\" of MS-DOS 6.0 again stifled the sales of DR DOS. Microsoft had been accused of carefully orchestrating leaks about future versions of MS-DOS in an attempt to create what in the industry is called FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) regarding DR DOS. For example, in October 1990, shortly after the release of DR DOS 5.0, and long before the eventual June 1991 release of MS-DOS 5.0, stories on feature enhancements in MS-DOS started to appear in InfoWorld and PC Week. Brad Silverberg, then Vice President of Systems Software at Microsoft and general manager of its Windows and MS-DOS Business Unit, wrote a forceful letter to PC Week (November 5, 1990), denying that Microsoft was engaged in FUD tactics (\\"to serve our customers better, we decided to be more forthcoming about version 5.0\\") and denying that Microsoft copied features from DR DOS: > \\"The feature enhancements of MS-DOS version 5.0 were decided and development > was begun long before we heard about DR DOS 5.0. There will be some similar > features. With 50 million MS-DOS users, it shouldn't be surprising that DRI > has heard some of the same requests from customers that we have.\\" ‚Äì > (Schulman et al. 1994). (xviii+856+vi pages, 3.5\\"-floppy) Errata: The pact between Microsoft and IBM to promote OS/2 began to fall apart in 1990 when Windows 3.0 became a marketplace success. Much of Microsoft's further contributions to OS/2 also went into creating a third GUI replacement for DOS, Windows NT. IBM, which had already been developing the next version of OS/2, carried on development of the platform without Microsoft and sold it as the alternative to DOS and Windows. Legal issues As a response to Digital Research's DR DOS 6.0, which bundled SuperStor disk compression, Microsoft opened negotiations with Stac Electronics, vendor of the most popular DOS disk compression tool, Stacker. In the due diligence process, Stac engineers had shown Microsoft part of the Stacker source code. Stac was unwilling to meet Microsoft's terms for licensing Stacker and withdrew from the negotiations. Microsoft chose to license Vertisoft's DoubleDisk, using it as the core for its DoubleSpace disk compression. MS-DOS 6.0 and 6.20 were released in 1993, both including the Microsoft DoubleSpace disk compression utility program. Stac successfully sued Microsoft for patent infringement regarding the compression algorithm used in DoubleSpace. This resulted in the 1994 release of MS-DOS 6.21, which had disk compression removed. Shortly afterwards came version 6.22, with a new version of the disk compression system, DriveSpace, which had a different compression algorithm to avoid the infringing code. Prior to 1995, Microsoft licensed MS-DOS (and Windows) to computer manufacturers under three types of agreement: per-processor (a fee for each system the company sold), per-system (a fee for each system of a particular model), or per-copy (a fee for each copy of MS-DOS installed). The largest manufacturers used the per-processor arrangement, which had the lowest fee. This arrangement made it expensive for the large manufacturers to migrate to any other operating system, such as DR DOS. In 1991, the U.S. government Federal Trade Commission began investigating Microsoft's licensing procedures, resulting in a 1994 settlement agreement limiting Microsoft to per-copy licensing. Digital Research did not gain by this settlement, and years later its successor in interest, Caldera, sued Microsoft for damages in the Caldera v. Microsoft lawsuit. It was believed that the settlement ran in the order of $150 million, but was revealed in November 2009 with the release of the Settlement Agreement to be $280 million. Use of undocumented APIs Microsoft also used a variety of tactics in MS-DOS and several of their applications and development tools that, while operating perfectly when running on genuine MS-DOS (and PC DOS), would break when run on another vendor's implementation of DOS. Notable examples of this practice included: * Microsoft's QuickPascal released in early 1989 was the first MS product that checked for MS-DOS by modifying the program's Program Segment Prefix using undocumented DOS functions, and then checked whether or not the associated value changed in a fixed position within the DOS data segment (also undocumented). This check also made it into later MS products, including Microsoft QuickC v2.5, Programmer's Workbench and Microsoft C v6.0. * The AARD code, a block of code in the windows launcher (WIN.COM) and a few other system files of Windows 3.1. It was XOR encrypted, self-modifying, and deliberately obfuscated, using various undocumented DOS structures and functions to determine whether or not Windows really was running on MS-DOS. In the beta versions, it displayed an \\"error\\" message if the test for genuine MS-DOS failed, prompting the user to abort or continue, with abort the default. In the final release version, the code still ran, but the message and prompt were disabled by an added flag byte, rendering it (probably) ineffectual.  Note that the Windows 3.0 beta code only gave a warning that Windows would not operate properly on a \\"foreign\\" OS. It did, in fact, run just fine on DR DOS 6.0. * Interrupt routines called by Windows to inform MS-DOS that Windows is starting/exiting, information that MS-DOS retained in an IN_WINDOWS flag, in spite of the fact that MS-DOS and Windows were supposed to be two separate products. Demise US Navy food service management system. The introduction of Windows 3.0 in 1990, with an easy-to-use graphical user interface, marked the beginning of the end for the command-line driven MS-DOS. With the release of Windows 95 (and continuing in the Windows 9x product line through to Windows Me), an integrated version of MS-DOS was used for bootstrapping, troubleshooting, and backwards-compatibility with old DOS software, particularly games, and no longer released as a standalone product. In Windows 95, the DOS, called MS-DOS 7, can be booted separately, without the Windows GUI; this capability was retained through Windows 98 Second Edition. Windows Me removed the capability to boot its underlying MS-DOS 8.0 alone from a hard disk, but retained the ability to make a DOS boot floppy disk (called an \\"Emergency Boot Disk\\") and can be hacked to restore full access to the underlying DOS. In contrast to the Windows 9x series, the Windows NT-derived 32-bit operating systems developed alongside the 9x series (Windows NT, 2000, XP and newer) do not contain MS-DOS as part of the operating system, as NT is not built as a subsystem running on DOS but an entirely different independent operating system, but provide a subset of DOS emulation to run DOS applications and provide DOS-like command prompt windows. 64-bit versions of Windows NT line do not provide DOS emulation and cannot run DOS applications natively. Windows XP contains a copy of the Windows Me boot disk, stripped down to bootstrap only. This is accessible only by formatting a floppy as an \\"MS-DOS startup disk\\". Files like the driver for the CD-ROM support were deleted from the Windows Me bootdisk and the startup files (AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS) no longer had content. This modified disk was the base for creating the MS-DOS image for Windows XP. Some of the deleted files can be recovered with an undelete tool. When booting up an MS-DOS startup disk made with Windows XP's format tool, the version reports as \\"Windows Millennium,\\" and not \\"MS-DOS 8.0\\" (which was used as the base for Windows Me but never released as a stand-alone product). With Windows Vista the files on the startup disk are dated April 18, 2005 but are otherwise unchanged, including the string \\"MS-DOS Version 8 Copyright 1981‚Äì1999 Microsoft Corp\\" inside \`COMMAND.COM\`. Starting with Windows 10, the ability to create a DOS startup disk has been removed and so either a virtual machine running MS-DOS or an older version (in a virtual machine or dual boot) must be used to format a floppy disk, or an image must be obtained from an external source. Other solutions include using DOS compatible alternatives, such as FreeDOS or even copying the required files and boot sector themselves. MS-DOS 6.22 was the last standalone version produced by Microsoft for Intel 8088, Intel 8086, and Intel 80286 processors, which remain available for download via their MSDN, volume license, and OEM license partner websites, for customers with valid login credentials. MS-DOS is still used in embedded x86 systems due to its simple architecture and minimal memory and processor requirements, though some current products have switched to the still-maintained open-source alternative FreeDOS. In 2018, Microsoft released the source code for MS-DOS 1.25 and 2.0 on GitHub. The purpose of this, according to Microsoft, is mainly for education and experimentation with historic operating systems and for new programmers to gain an understanding of how low-level software works, both historic and current. Due to the historical nature of the software, Microsoft will not accept any pull requests to the code; only pull requests for modified and translated documentation will be accepted. Users, however, are allowed and fully encouraged to fork the repository containing the MS-DOS source code and make their own modifications, and do whatever they like with it. Windows command-line interface All versions of Microsoft Windows have had an MS-DOS- like command-line interface (CLI) called Command Prompt. This could run many DOS and variously Win32, OS/2 1.x and POSIX command line utilities in the same command-line session, allowing piping between commands. The user interface, and the icon up to Windows 2000, followed the native MS-DOS interface. The 16-bit versions of Windows (up to 3.11) ran as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on top of MS-DOS. With Windows 95, 98, 98 SE and Me, the MS-DOS part was (superficially) integrated, treating the MS-DOS operating system and the Windows GUI as a complete package, though the DOS component could actually stand alone. The command line accessed the DOS command line (usually \`COMMAND.COM\`) through a Windows module (WINOLDAP.MOD). A new line of Windows, (Windows NT), boot through a kernel whose sole purpose is to load Windows. One cannot run Win32 applications in the loader system in the manner that OS/2, UNIX or Consumer Windows can launch character-mode sessions. The command session permits running of various supported command line utilities from Win32, MS-DOS, OS/2 1.x and POSIX. The emulators for MS-DOS, OS/2 and POSIX use the host's window in the same way that Win16 applications use the Win32 explorer. Using the host's window allows one to pipe output between emulations. The MS-DOS emulation is done through the NTVDM (NT Virtual DOS Machine). This is a modified SoftPC (a former product similar to VirtualPC), running a modified MS-DOS 5 (NTIO.SYS and NTDOS.SYS). The output is handled by the console DLLs, so that the program at the prompt (\`CMD.EXE\`, \`4NT.EXE\`, \`TCC.EXE\`), can see the output. 64-bit Windows does not have either the DOS emulation, or the DOS commands EDIT, DEBUG, EDLIN), that come with 32-bit Windows. The DOS version returns 5.00 or 5.50, depending on which API function is used to determine it. Utilities from MS-DOS 5.00 run in this emulation without modification. The very early beta programs of NT show MS-DOS 30.00, but programs running in MS-DOS 30.00 would assume that OS/2 was in control. The OS/2 emulation is handled through OS2SS.EXE and OS2.EXE, and DOSCALLS.DLL. OS2.EXE is a version of the OS/2 shell (CMD.EXE), which passes commands down to the OS2SS.EXE, and input-output to the Windows NT shell. Windows 2000 was the last version of NT to support OS/2. The emulation is OS/2 1.30. POSIX is emulated through the POSIX shell, but no emulated shell; the commands are handled directly in CMD.EXE. The Command Prompt is often called the MS-DOS prompt. In part, this was the official name for it in Windows 9x and early versions of Windows NT (NT 3.5 and earlier), and in part because the SoftPC emulation of DOS redirects output into it. Actually only \`COMMAND.COM\` and other 16-bit commands run in an NTVDM with \`AUTOEXEC.NT\` and \`CONFIG.NT\` initialisation determined by \`_DEFAULT.PIF\`, optionally permitting the use of Win32 console applications and internal commands with an \`NTCMDPROMPT\` directive. Win32 console applications use \`CMD.EXE\` as their command prompt shell. This confusion does not exist under OS/2 because there are separate DOS and OS/2 prompts, and running a DOS program under OS/2 will launch a separate DOS window to run the application. All versions of Windows for Itanium (no longer sold by Microsoft) and x86-64 architectures no longer include the NTVDM and can therefore no longer natively run DOS or 16-bit Windows applications. There are alternatives in the form of virtual machine emulators such as Microsoft's own Virtual PC, as well as VMware, DOSBox, and others. Legacy compatibility From 1983 onwards, various companies worked on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) capable of running on PC hardware. However, this required duplicated effort and did not provide much consistency in interface design (even between products from the same company). Later, in 1985, Microsoft Windows 1.0 was released as Microsoft's first attempt at providing a consistent user interface (for applications). The early versions of Windows ran on top of MS-DOS. At first Windows met with little success, but this was also true for most other companies' efforts as well, for example GEM. After version 3.0, Windows gained market acceptance. Windows 9x used the DOS boot process to launch into protected mode. Basic features related to the file system, such as long file names, were only available to DOS when running as a subsystem of Windows. Windows NT runs independently of DOS but includes NTVDM, a component for simulating a DOS environment for legacy applications. Related systems MS-DOS compatible systems include: * IBM PC DOS * DR DOS, Novell DOS, OpenDOS * FreeDOS * PTS-DOS * ROM-DOS Microsoft manufactured IBM PC DOS for IBM. It and MS-DOS were identical products that eventually diverged starting with MS-DOS version 6.0. Digital Research did not follow Microsoft's version numbering scheme. For example, MS-DOS 4, released in July 1988, was followed by DR DOS 5.0 in May 1990. MS-DOS 5.0 came in April 1991, and DR DOS 6.0 was released the following June. These products are collectively referred to as \\"DOS\\", even though \\"Disk Operating System\\" is a generic term used on other systems unrelated to the x86 and IBM PC. \\"MS-DOS\\" can also be a generic reference to DOS on IBM PC compatible computers. Microsoft's control of the Windows platform, and their programming practices which intentionally made Windows appear as if it ran poorly on competing versions of DOS, crippled the ability of other DOS makers to continue to compete with MS-DOS. Digital Research had to release interim releases to circumvent Windows limitations inserted artificially, designed specifically to provide Microsoft with a competitive advantage.

McKenzie was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 11 November 1869 and died on 29 August 1929, in London.Buckland, Raymond (2005). The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication. Visible Ink Press. pp. 246-247 Biography Through years of study and experimentation with hypnotists and mediums, Mckenzie wrote what is considered his main work, Spirit Intercourse: Its Theory and Practice in 1917. A number of pamphlets on the related topics also bear his name including his 1917 work If a Soldier Die in and Personal Experiences in Spiritualism 1920. He left his practice as a psychologist and psychoanalyst in 1900 to pursue parapsychology and the occult sciences as a result of being disenfranchised by traditional theology and science not being able to reconcile themselves.Hazelgrove, Jenny (2000). Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars. Manchester University Press. pp. 16-17 He devoted his time to helping spiritual mediums develop their abilities. Such mediums included Gladys Osborne Leonard, Franek Kluski, Maria Silbert and Eileen J. Garrett. He spent a number of years touring and lecturing in the United States both seeking and studying mediums he also spent quite some time in the middle east, Germany, Austria, and Poland for this same purpose, finally returning home to England in 1920. McKenzie's contributions to parapsychology and its coming of age in the great spiritual movement of the early 20th century can be considered his greatest legacy, paving the way for future study of clairvoyance, extrasensory perception and remote viewing. However, allegations of fraud and mismanagement, as well as hoaxing, plagued McKenzie's research. It is stated in the Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology \\"A devoted Spiritualist, McKenzie had no scientific training. Characterized by a strong, assertive personality, he was known to cover up evidence of fraud when he discovered it.\\"\\"James Hewat Mckenzie\\". Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology. =British College of Psychic Science= The British College of Psychic Science was founded in April 1920 in London by McKenzie and his wife to study psychical phenomena, similar to the Institut M√©tapsychique International in Paris. In December 1938 the college merged with the International Institute for Psychical Research, becoming the Institute for Experimental Metaphysics. During World War II the institute closed, and in 1947 all of its library and records were destroyed.Shepard, Leslie. (1991). Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology. Gale Research. p. 222 =Harry Houdini= In his book Spirit Intercourse: Its Theory and Practice, McKenzie claimed the magician Harry Houdini's feats such as being able to unbolt locked doors and escape from handcuffs were the result of psychic power.Houdini, Harry (2011 reprint edition). Originally published in 1924. A Magician Among the Spirits. Cambridge University Press. pp. 211-215 McKenzie also claimed in his book that Houdini had the power to materialize and dematerialize objects and other stage mentalists such as Anna Eva Fay and Julius and Agnes Zancig had genuine psychic powers. Houdini referred to this as \\"one of the most, if not the most flagrant instances of mal-observation\\" and in his book Magician Among the Spirits wrote a response to McKenzie \\"I do claim to free myself from the restraint of fetters and confinement, but positively state that I accomplish my purpose purely by physical, not psychical means. The force necessary to \\"shot a bolt within a lock,\\" is drawn from Houdini the living human being and not a medium. My methods are perfectly natural, resting on natural laws of physics.\\" Psychical researcher Eric Dingwall wrote regarding McKenzie that \\"In spite of his massive credulity and disregard of scientific evidence he was a remarkable example of the spiritualist business-man; and it is better to remember him for his many good qualities than to stress his na√Øve belief in Houdini‚Äôs ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù powers\\".Hankey, Muriel Winifred Arnold.

As a composer, Kopec has had his music used in feature film trailers including The Tall Man, Never Surrender, and The Curse of Micah Rood. He formed the American-based Industrial rock band Intricate Unit in 1999, but did not start performing live until 2003. Since then Intricate Unit has opened for bands on the East Coast, and headlined their own tour in 2006. in 2006, Kopec launched Epitome Music Library. The primary goal of the company is to place music into film, TV, video games, advertising campaigns, and other mediums. Previous companies Kopec has started include a Rock Band Authoring service, called The Rock Pulse, to help bands get their music into the Rock Band Network. Early life and education Kopec studied Music and Sound Recording at the University of New Haven for 2 years before attending and receiving his 4-year Bachelor of Science degree in Audio Engineering at the University of Hartford. He went on to also receive his minor in Communication Studies. Kopec also received his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. Kopec is currently taking classes for his Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. While attending the University of New Haven, Kopec inherited an 8-year-running industrial music radio station called The Industrial Revolution. The station itself was called WNHU 88.7 FM. Kopec would go on the air every Wednesday from 6 pm to 8 pm for over 2 years. Career Kopec started the band Intricate Unit. Having played many shows at Toad's Place in New Haven, CT, the band eventually started playing many shows in the Tri-state area and touring across the country; notably, playing to thousands of people in Ohio in 2006 at the Gathering of the Juggalos. Kopec composes for film, TV, and video games. Kopec has placed twice at the Hollywood Reporter Film and TV Music Conference in Los Angeles for his music in trailers and video games. Kopec also works with Massachusetts-based company Sonicbids for music licensing opportunities. Kopec has been an ASCAP (American Society for Composers and Publishers) member since 2005. Kopec also has a music publishing company called Jukebox Johnny with ASCAP. In late 2009, Kopec started a company called The Rock Pulse. The mission of this company is to provide a service for bands to get into the Rock Band Network. The Rock Pulse has authored songs for Intricate Unit and Dead By Wednesday. However, Kopec decided in 2011 to focus more of hsi energy on his other companies. On 10‚Äì10‚Äì10 Kopec relocated his home and studio to Los Angeles, CA.

It is also designated R-1234yf as the first of a new class of refrigerants: it is marketed under the name Opteon YF by Chemours and as Solstice YF by Honeywell. HFO-1234yf has a global warming potential (GWP) of less than 1, compared to 1,430 for R-134a and 1 for carbon dioxide. This colorless gas is being used as a replacement for R-134a as a refrigerant in automobile air conditioners. As of 2018, 50% of new vehicles from \\"original equipment manufacturers\\" (OEMs) are estimated to use HFO-1234yf. It does break down into persistent organic pollutant short chain PFCAs. Adoption by automotive industry HFO-1234yf was developed by a team at DuPont, led by Barbara Haviland Minor, which worked jointly with researchers at Honeywell. Their goal was to meet European directive 2006/40/EC, which went into effect in 2011 and required that all new car platforms for sale in Europe use a refrigerant in its AC system with a GWP below 150. HFO-1234yf was initially considered to have a 100-year GWP of 4, and is now considered to have a 100-year GWP lower than 1. It can be used as a \\"near drop-in replacement\\" for R-134a, the product previously used in automobile AC systems, which has a 100-year GWP of 1430. This meant that automakers would not have to make significant modifications in assembly lines or in vehicle system designs to accommodate the product. HFO-1234yf had the lowest switching cost for automakers among the proposed alternatives. The product can be handled in repair shops in the same way as R-134a, although it requires some different, specialized equipment to perform the service. One of the reasons for that is the mild flammability of HFO-1234yf. Another issue affecting the compatibility between HFO-1234yf and R-134a-based systems is the choice of lubricating oil. Shortly after confirmation from automakers that HFO-1234yf would be adopted as a replacement of R-134a automotive air-conditioning refrigerant, in 2010, Honeywell and DuPont announced that they would jointly build a manufacturing facility in Changshu, Jiangsu Province, China to produce HFO-1234yf.\\"Automakers Go HFO\\", Chemical & Engineering News, July 26, 2010 In 2017, Honeywell opened a new plant in Geismar, Louisiana, USA to produce the new refrigerant as well. Although others claim to be able to make and sell HFO-1234yf, Honeywell and DuPont hold most or all of the patents issued for HFO-1234yf and are considered the leading players in this area as of 2018. =Flammability= Although the product is classified slightly flammable by ASHRAE, several years of testing by SAE International proved that the product could not be ignited under conditions normally experienced by a vehicle. In addition several independent authorities evaluated the safety of the product in vehicles and some of them concluded that it was as safe to use as R-134a, the product then in use in cars. In the atmosphere, HFO-1234yf degrades to trifluoroacetic acid, which is a mildly phytotoxic strong organic acid with no known biodegradation mechanism in water. In case of fire it releases highly corrosive and toxic hydrogen fluoride and the highly toxic gas carbonyl fluoride. In July 2008, Honeywell/Du-Pont published a report claiming \\"HFO-1234yf is very difficult to ignite with electric spark\\" detailing the tests they did passing the gas over a hot plate heated to various temperatures in the range of 500¬∞C - 900¬∞C. Ignition was only seen when HFO-1234yf was mixed with PAG oil and passed over a plate that was > 900¬∞C. In August 2012, Mercedes-Benz showed that the substance ignited when researchers sprayed it and A/C compressor oil onto a car's hot engine. A senior Daimler engineer who ran the tests, stated \\"We were frozen in shock, I am not going to deny it. We needed a day to comprehend what we had just seen.\\" Combustion occurred in more than two thirds of their simulated head-on collisions. The engineers also noticed etching on the windshield caused by the corrosive gases. On September 25, 2012, Daimler issued a press release and proposed a recall of cars using the refrigerant. The German automakers argued for continued use of carbon dioxide refrigerants, which they argued to be safer. In October 2012, SAE International established a new Cooperative Research Project, CRP1234-4, which included members of 13 automotive companies, to extend its previous testing and investigate Daimler's claims. A preliminary update as of December 2012 and a final report publicly released on July 24, 2013 agreed that R-1234yf was safe to use in automotive direct-expansion air conditioning systems. R-1234yf was believed not to increase the estimated risk of vehicle fire exposure. The report further stated that \\"the refrigerant release testing completed by Daimler was unrealistic\\" and \\"created extreme conditions that favored ignition\\". The final report was supported by Chrysler/Fiat, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda, PSA, Renault and Toyota. Daimler, BMW and Audi chose to withdraw from the SAE R-1234yf CRP Team. Following Mercedes' claims that the new refrigerant could be ignited, Germany's Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA, Federal Motor Transport Authority) conducted its own tests. They submitted a report to the European Union in August 2013. The Authority concluded that while R-1234yf was potentially more hazardous than previously used R-134a, it did not comprise a serious danger. Daimler disagreed with this conclusion and argued that the report supported their decision to continue to use older refrigerants. On July 23, 2010, General Motors announced that it would introduce HFO-1234yf in 2013 Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, and Cadillac models in the U.S. Cadillac became the first American car to use R-1234yf in 2012. Since then, Chrysler, GMC and Ford have all begun transitioning vehicles to R1234yf. Japanese automakers are also making the transition to R1234yf. Honda and Subaru began to introduce the new refrigerant with the 2017 models. From 2017 to 2018, BMW changed all of its models to R-1234yf. As of 2018, 50% of new vehicles from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are estimated to use R-1234yf. Mixing HFO-1234yf with 10-11% R-134A is in development to produce a hybrid gas under review by ASHRAE for classification as A2L which is described as \\"virtually non-flammable\\". These gases are under review with the names of R451A and R451B. These mixes have GWP of ~147. Other additives have been proposed for lowering the flammability of HFO-1234yf, such as trifluoroiodomethane, which has a low GWP due to its short atmospheric lifetime, but is slightly mutagenic. Production Typical methods for producing HFO-1234yf start with 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropene. Hydrogenation of this alkene gives 1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropane, which upon heating with an Al-based catalyst undergoes dehydrofluorination:Rao, Velliyur Nott Mallikarjuna; Sievert, Allen Capron; Nappa, Mario Joseph \\"Process to manufacture 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene\\" PCT Int.

The term ethnophyletismos designates the idea that a local autocephalous church should be based not on a local (ecclesial) criterion, but on an ethnophyletist, national or linguistic one. It was used at the Holy and Great (ŒúŒµŒØŒ∂œâŒΩ Meizon \\"enlarged\\") pan-Orthodox Synod in Constantinople on 10 September 1872 to qualify \\"phyletist (religious) nationalism\\", which was condemned as a modern ecclesial heresy: the church should not be confused with the destiny of a single nation or a single race. History After their emancipation from Ottoman rule, the Balkan churches freely developed both their national identities and their religious life. Theological faculties were created in Athens, Belgrade, Sofia, and Bucharest. The Romanian Orthodox Church introduced the full cycle of the liturgical offices in vernacular Romanian. However, these liberal developments were often marked by nationalistic rivalries. The term phyletism was coined at the Holy and Great pan-Orthodox Synod that met in Istanbul (then Constantinople) in 1872. The meeting was prompted by the struggle of the Bulgarian Orthodox against the domination of the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople in the 1850s and 1860s. Discontent with the supremacy of the Greek clergy in Bulgaria had started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses as early as the 1820s. It was not, however, until 1850 that the Bulgarians initiated a purposeful struggle against the Greek clerics in a number of bishoprics demanding their replacement with Bulgarian ones as well as other changes such as the use of Bulgarian language in liturgy and fixed salaries for bishops. By that time, most Bulgarian religious leaders had realised that any further struggle for the rights of the Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire could not succeed unless they managed to obtain at least some degree of autonomy from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. On 10 August 1872 the Synod issued an official condemnation of ecclesiastical racism, or \\"ethno-phyletism\\", as well as its theological argumentation. In condemning phyletism, the Synod in Constantinople had, in fact, defined a basic problem of modern Orthodoxy. Both the Bulgarians and Greeks have been accused of phyletism during this period, the Greek clerics in particular for trying to impose the Greek language on non-Greek ethnic groups, such as the Slavic population of Macedonia and Thrace, and for spreading nationalistic ideas of a Greater Greece. Konstantin Leontiev, a prominent writer on the subject, notes that both sides were equally responsible for the schism, but differentiates the two: > ‚ÄúBoth you [Greeks] and the Bulgarians can equally be accused of phyletism, > that is, of introducing ethnic interests into Church questions, and in the > use of religion as a political weapon; but the difference lies in the fact > that Bulgarian phyletism is defensive, while yours is offensive. Their > phyletism seeks only to mark out the boundaries of their tribe; yours seeks > to cross the boundaries of Hellenism...Leontiev, Konstantin ‚ÄúThe Fruits of > the National Movements‚Äù, op. cit., p. 559 21st century Although the Eastern Orthodox Churches condemned phyletism in 1872, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew has declared that \\"nationalism remains one of the central problems of the Church.\\" Phyletism has been a threat to Orthodox unity since at least the rise of nationalism in the 19th century, and its impact on Orthodoxy in America‚Äîand in other areas of ethnic diaspora communities‚Äîthroughout the 20th century and to the present-day is well known.Pillar Two - Orthodox Relations The conditions behind modern-day phyletism are different from those surrounding the 1872 decision of the Synod in Constantinople. In the latter half of the 20th century, there has been a vigorous and sometimes contentious debate among the Orthodox concerning the problem of the Diaspora, specifically the organization of the Orthodox Church in countries to which Orthodox have emigrated, particularly since the Russian Revolution. The problem is that Orthodox dioceses (officially called \\"jurisdictions\\") in the Diaspora are superimposed on each other. The result is that there are usually several Orthodox bishops of different Orthodox churches in Diaspora cities. This situation violates the canonical principle of territoriality ‚Äì that each city and province should have its own unique bishop. =United States= In the United States, most Eastern Orthodox parishes are ethnocentric, that is, focused on serving an ethnic community that has immigrated from overseas (e.g., the Greeks, Russians, Romanians, Finns, Serbs, Arabs, etc.) Many Orthodox Christians must travel long distances to find a local Church that is familiar to their ethnic background. All Orthodox churches make some attempt to accommodate those of other ethnic traditions with varying degrees of success. In June 2008, Metropolitan Jonah of the Orthodox Church in America delivered a talk on ‚ÄúEpiscopacy, Primacy, and the Mother Churches: A Monastic Perspective‚Äù at the Conference of the Fellowship of St. Alban and St. Sergius at St. Vladimir‚Äôs Theological Seminary. > The problem is not so much the multiple overlapping jurisdictions, each > ministering to diverse elements of the population. This could be adapted as > a means of dealing with the legitimate diversity of ministries within a > local or national Church. The problem is that there is no common expression > of unity that supersedes ethnic, linguistic and cultural divisions: there is > no synod of bishops responsible for all the churches in America, and no > primacy or point of accountability in the Orthodox world with the authority > to correct such a situation. Josiah Trenham noted nine divisions of pastoral practice among the Orthodox jurisdictions in the United States. =France= Metropolitan Philip of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America points to Paris, France as an example of phyletism. He argues: > One more example of phyletism is Paris, France. There are six co-existing > Orthodox bishops with overlapping ecclesiological jurisdictions. In my > opinion and in the opinion of Orthodox canonists, this is phyletism. However, the Ecumenical Patriarchate claims that it is the only legitimate canonical authority for all Orthodox living in Western Europe, both having regard to canon 28 of the Council of Chalcedon, and also because since the 11th century the Patriarch and Pope of Rome has no longer been able to offer pastoral care for Orthodox in the West and the See of Constantinople is the nearest Patriarchate, geographically, which is able to offer such care. =Estonia= Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, divisions within the Orthodox community in Estonia arose between those who wished to remain under Russian authority and those who wished to return to the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, with the dispute often taking place along ethnic lines, many Russians having immigrated to Estonia during the Soviet occupation. Lengthy negotiations between the two patriarchates failed to produce any agreement. In 1993, the synod of the Orthodox Church of Estonia in Exile was re-registered as the autonomous Orthodox Church of Estonia, and on February 20, 1996, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I renewed the tomos granted to the OCE in 1923, restoring its canonical subordination to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. This action brought immediate protest from the Estonian-born Patriarch Alexei II of the Moscow Patriarchate, which regarded his native Estonia as part of his canonical territory and the Patriarch of Moscow temporarily removed the name of the Ecumenical Patriarch from the diptychs. An agreement was reached in which local congregations could choose which jurisdiction to follow. The Orthodox community in Estonia, which accounts for about 14% of the total population, remains divided, with the majority of faithful (mostly ethnic Russians) remaining under Moscow. As of a U.S. Department of State report from November 2003, about 20,000 believers (mostly ethnic Estonians) in 60 parishes are part of the autonomous church, with 150,000 faithful in 31 parishes, along with the monastic community of P√ºhtitsa, paying traditional allegiance to Moscow.International Religious Freedom Report 2003 See also * Bulgarian schism * Ethnic religion * Kinism, a sect of Calvinism * Messianic Judaism, an ethnically defined denomination of Evangelical Protestantism * Moscow‚ÄìConstantinople schism (2018) * National church * Day Of Slavonic Alphabet, Bulgarian Enlightenment and Culture References External links  * The ‚ÄúBulgarian Question‚Äù and the 1872 Council of Constantinople, Part 4 (the articles of the council can be found on this page) Further reading * Russian Autocephaly and Orthodoxy in America: An Appraisal with Decisions and Formal Opinions.

He was a historian of Korea, a scholar of comparative world religions, and wrote many books on these and related topics. He was a key figure in the 2nd generation of Korean studies scholars in the United States. Biography Palmer was born in Eden, Arizona on October 4, 1927. He was raised in Thatcher, Arizona. He studied at Eastern Arizona College before transferring to Brigham Young University (BYU) where he received his bachelor's degree. Between his studies at these two institutions Palmer served as a missionary for the LDS Church in the California Mission. He then studied at the University of California, Berkeley where he earned a master's degree in East Asiatic Studies and a Ph.D. in Oriental History. In 1956 Palmer married Shirley Ann Hadley in the Salt Lake Temple. Palmer served in the United States military as a chaplain in both Japan and Korea. Palmer first arrived in Korea in 1953 as a 2nd lieutenant and chaplain. When Palmer joined the BYU faculty he was the only scholar specializing in Korean studies. He was involved in forming BYU's Asian Studies program. He was the president of the Korean Mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1965-1968. During this time he often traveled and worked closely with Gordon B. Hinckley, who was then the member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, responsible for overseeing the operation of the LDS Church in Asia. As mission president Palmer also purchased the site where the Church later built the Seoul Temple. Palmer served as a bishop, a counselor in a stake presidency, as a Regional Representative of the Twelve in Southeast Asia, and was president of the Seoul Korea Temple from 1988 to 1990. For many years Palmer was a professor at BYU, where he served as director of the World Religions Division at BYU's Religious Studies Center and director of BYU's Center for International and Area Studies. This was the predecessor to the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at which Palmer served as a director. In 1991 Palmer donated his collection of over 5,000 books on Asian and religious topics to BYU's Harold B. Lee Library, a collection that included about 1,500 rare books in Korean. In 1993 Palmer worked for six months as a visiting professor in China teaching comparative world religions to students from local ethnic minority groups at the invitation of the Chinese government. The Palmers were the parents of four children: John, Dwight, Jennette, and James. John Leroy Palmer, which was also the name of Palmer's father, died as an infant, but the other three outlived their father. Publications *The Expanding Church.

Early life Broughton was born in 1865 on a farm in Wake County, North Carolina, about 12 miles outside of Raleigh, North Carolina. He was the second son of Gaston H. Broughton and Louisa Hawkins Franks. His father was a poor farmer who fought in the American Civil War in the 26th North Carolina Regiment, was captured by Union troops at the Battle of Gettysburg, and was held prisoner until the end of the war. After his return (and on Louisa's urging) the family moved to Raleigh where the children (including Len) were schooled via the aid of a wealthy relative. At the age of fourteen, Broughton was baptized into his faith at what was later known as Tabernacle Baptist Church in Raleigh. Broughton attended Wake Forest College with his brother Charlie though he did not graduate due to illness. (Wake Forest granted him a D.D. later). Broughton went on to attend the Kentucky School of Medicine at Louisville and achieved an M.D.. Career He moved to Wilson County, North Carolina to practice medicine and it was there that he met his wife Roxana Barnes. He later also practiced medicine in Reidsville, North Carolina for four years. It was there that he contracted Typhoid fever. A long period of recovery helped him make the decision to become a minister. In March 1891 he became the pastor of a small church in Winston, North Carolina. In the year and a half he was there, the church gained one hundred members. He became known for this and other churches sought his services. He accepted such an offer in November, 1893 at Calvary Church in Roanoke, Virginia. In March 1898 he became pastor of Third Baptist Church in Atlanta. He had been in Atlanta only a short while when he started a project to build a much larger facility for the congregation, nearer to the center of town, to be known as the Tabernacle. Many of the older members of the church opposed Broughton's plan, and when it passed by a vote of 542 to 240, the church was split into two. Those opposed remained to form Jones Avenue Baptist Church in the existing facility, and the rest went with Broughton to form Tabernacle Baptist Church nearby. On March 5, 1899 a church structure was dedicated but rapid growth quickly rendered it obsolete. On March 9, 1910 the cornerstone was laid on a huge new four-story structure to house the church. (This structure still stands, it is now used as the music venue The Tabernacle). Broughton had a long and successful tenure as pastor of this church, creating many new programs including Tabernacle Infirmary in 1901 (which would later become Georgia Baptist Hospital) and the largest Bible Conference in the South at the time. Broughton again was receiving many requests to leave his church for posts elsewhere. In 1912 he accepted such an offer of a position at Christ Church in London, England, a church famous among Baptists of the time because of the work of F.B. Meyer. He remained there for over 2 years, but the outbreak of World War I and his own declining health took its toll. He left in 1915 and took a post at First Baptist in Knoxville, Tennessee. From 1923 to 1927, he was the pastor of First Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida. Broughton returned to Tabernacle Baptist Church in Atlanta from 1929 to 1931. He died in 1936 and was buried in Knoxville.

Published in 1980 by Pan Books (), it was a best-seller that achieved popularity in the United Kingdom and worldwide. The code mentioned in the title is an intended throwback from Follett to Daphne du Maurier's famed suspense novel Rebecca. Creation, basis and development While undertaking research for his best- selling novel Eye of the Needle, Follett had discovered the true story of the Nazi spy Johannes Eppler (also known as John W. Eppler or John Eppler) and his involvement in Operation Salaam, a non-fiction account of which was published in 1959.Eppler, John W., G√∂rz, Heinz: Rommel ruft Kairo: Aus dem Tagebuch eines Spions. Bertelsmann, G√ºtersloh 1959 This was to form the basis of Follett's The Key to Rebecca, Eppler being the inspiration behind the character Alex Wolff, and he spent a year writing it, more than the time he took to write his previous novels Eye of the Needle and Triple. This true story was also later to form the basis behind Michael Ondaatje's Booker Prize- winning 1992 novel The English Patient and the 1996 Academy Award-winning film of the same name starring Ralph Fiennes. Len Deighton's novel City of Gold is also laid against much of the same background. Many plot elements in the novel are based on actual historical details. The real-life Eppler, like Follett's fictional Alex Wolff, had grown up in Egypt after his mother had remarried to a wealthy Egyptian, and thus had a mixed German and Arab cultural heritage, greatly facilitating his ability to penetrate British-ruled Egypt. Like Follett's spy, Eppler was based at a houseboat on the river Nile, got help from a nationalist-inclined belly dancer in his espionage work, and used a system of codes based on Daphne du Maurier's book Rebecca ‚Äì which provided the title of Follett's book. And Eppler did request assistance from the Cairo- based Free Officers Movement, who were at the time nominally pro-Axis in the belief that they would 'liberate' Egypt from the British, and specifically from the young Anwar Sadat. Sadat plays an important role in the plot, and the scene of his arrest by the British is largely derived from Sadat's own autobiography ‚Äì though the British officer who actually arrested him was not Follett's protagonist, Major William Vandam, a completely fictional character. When seeing Sadat already beginning to think of making the most of his arrest and \\"preparing to play martyr\\", Vandam thinks \\"He is very adaptable, he should be a politician\\"; the reader, obviously, is well aware that Sadat is the future President of Egypt. However, Wolff is a far more formidable character than the actual Eppler, who \\"deliberately sabotaged his own radio, because he wanted to enjoy himself and live with a Jewish prostitute\\".Sadat, Anwar Revolt on the Nile. The emphasis on the prostitutes being Jewish is in Sadat's book. In contrast, Follett's Wolff ‚Äì though having a sensual and pleasure-loving side ‚Äì is completely dedicated to his mission, driven by a curious mixture of German nationalism, Egyptian patriotism and an overwhelming personal ambition. Like the German spy Faber in Follett's earlier Eye of the Needle, he is supremely intelligent, competent and resourceful, and utterly ruthless ‚Äì ever ready to kill anyone perceived as threatening him, and preferring to do it silently with a knife. However, towards the end of the book, Wolff displays an increasing sadistic streak absent from Follett's earlier spy. Among other things, Wolff is credited with having crossed the Sahara into Egypt by himself on camel, rather than being ferried there, as was the actual Eppler. To enable Wolff to carry out such an epic feat, Follett provides him with a Bedouin background. Thus Wolff is thoroughly conversant with three distinct cultures; Nazi Germany, the Egyptian urban elites and the desert-dwelling tribes ‚Äì the last two as distant from each other as they are from the first. Another major departure is to make Wolff's espionage of far greater strategic significance than Eppler's ever was, making the very outcome of the war ‚Äì or at least of the North African campaign ‚Äì hinge on it, and fictionally crediting some of Rommel's main battle victories to information provided by Wolff, having gained access to secret battle plans carried by a Secret Intelligence Service officer. A departure from cryptologic sense occurs in Follett's title conceit: the \\"key\\" or code sequence used to render the Axis spy's messages unreadable by the Allies without it. The author has it as a written down device, available for capture by the wily Major Vandam, but the actual code key imagined by Follett is so simple that a real agent would have simply memorised it, not had it written down for anyone to get hold of. To have it as a mnemonic \\"key\\" would have required a different method for the book's climax, either involving a \\"Bletchley Park\\" type codebreaker trick (some early \\"computer\\" perhaps) or by Vandam pressuring Wolff to reveal it (unlikely, given the obstinate history of the Nazi-Bedouin character). The quote from Rommel which serves as the book's motto ‚Äì \\"Our spy in Cairo is the greatest hero of them all\\" ‚Äì is genuine, and the battles of the North African Campaign are described accurately. However, the credit given to information provided by Wolff as decisively helping Rommel's victories ‚Äì and to Vandam's disinformation in causing his ultimate defeat ‚Äì is fictional. Reviewer Mary Klein noted that \\"Not only is the code used in the book based on du Maurier's Rebecca, but the book's plot line of romance between Elene Fontana and Major Vandam has some similarity with the plot of the original Rebecca. In both, a Plebeian girl falls in love with a member of the British ruling class, but feels overwhelmed and overshadowed by the memory of his aristocratic first wife ‚Äì and in both cases, eventually turns out to be a much better mate than that first wife\\"Mary C. Klein, \\"How Convincing Are the Love Themes in Thrillers, Detective Fiction and Science Fiction?\\" in Barbara Edwards (ed.), \\"Round Table on Developing Trends and Themes in the Popular Culture of the Later Twentieth Century\\".. Reception and success The Key to Rebecca was an immediate best-seller, becoming a main selection of the Book of the Month Club, with an initial printing of 100,000 copies within days and having been serialised in several magazines, even before any reviews had been published. Positive reviews of the novel cited its depth in historical detail, and accurate depictions of Cairo and the Egyptian desert in the Second World War. Follett noted that it was due to the success of The Key to Rebecca that he had believed he had truly been successful. Film adaptation In 1985, The Key to Rebecca was adapted into a film, directed by David Hemmings and starring David Soul as Alex Wolff and Cliff Robertson as Maj. William Vandam. It was filmed in Tunisia and was shot as a two-part, four-hour television film; syndicated as part of the Operation Prime Time package, the first part was broadcast in New York City on WPIX on 29 April 1985, with the second part on 9 May 1985. (Dates varied by station.) Produced by Taft Entertainment in association with Castle Comb Productions, it was later shown in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and several other countries in which the novel had been popular. Similar themes in other books Len Deighton's novel City of Gold is set in the same time and place and with a similar theme ‚Äì the British worried about a spy in Cairo sending information to Rommel. However, in Deighton's depiction, it is ultimately discovered that there had been no spy, and information went to the Germans due to faulty radio security. Like Follett's story, Deighton's is also based on historical fact. Another novel covering this period and events is the 2014 novel by Juliana Maio, City of the Sun. Because of her Egyptian Jewish heritage, Maio, who was born in Cairo, relies on family accounts to give us the slightly different perspective of the Jewish community in Cairo during this time, while based on the same historical facts.

The journal is currently published by Hakirah, Inc. from editorial offices in Brooklyn with two annual issues. Hakirah is today one of the largest Orthodox journals of Jewish law and thought in the United States with a readership that includes members from major Jewish communities throughout the world.  Foundation and early years  Hakirah is a Jewish journal which publishes articles that reflect a wide range of Orthodox beliefs and ideas. Those who submit articles run the gamut from laypeople, to rabbis, doctors and professors. The first volume of Hakirah was published in the fall of 2004. Each volume generally contains about ten English and two Hebrew articles comprising a total of about 250 pages. A new volume appears about every six to seven months.Hakirah, vol. 1, p.5, Hakirah was created by a small group of individuals in Flatbush, Brooklyn who study together on Shabbat afternoon. Concerned about an alleged lack of sophistication in Torah study and what they believed was an excessive reliance on mysticism and kabbalah, it was the desire of the group to create a journal that would inspire the community toward what they considered a higher level of Torah study and analysis. The early volumes of Hakirah relied mainly on articles by members of their original study group, Asher Benzion Buchman, David Guttmann, Sheldon Epstein, Yonah Wilamowsky and Heshey Zelcer. From about the third volume, however, Hakirah began to attract international attention whereupon Hakirah redefined its mission to include not just the Flatbush community but those who identified with the Flatbush Orthodox community.  Mission statement  The mission of Hakirah is to encourage members of the Flatbush community to study issues of Jewish law and thought in depth by analyzing original sources, and to provide these same individuals with a forum to disseminate the results of their study for peer review. Although not stated explicitly on either their Web page or journal, the orientation of the Hakirah board is toward a commitment to Orthodox Judaism that is accepting of the proven natural science and documented history, and cognizant of the general culture and zeitgeist. Hakirah tries to address what its editors consider important contemporary issues affecting the Orthodox Community as they arise. In this vein, Hakirah has solicited and published articles on \\"The Eruv‚Äù, Mezizah B‚ÄôPeh\\", the ‚ÄúSlifkin Affair‚ÄùHakirah vol. 2, p. 5 and the current ‚ÄúConversion Controversy\\" in what its editors believe is a straightforward and detailed manner. Hakirah is not affiliated with any political or rabbinic institution. Its articles question accepted institutions of both the right as well as works and ideas of the Modern Orthodox Judaism and the left.  Editor and Review Board  The staff of Hakirah are mainly volunteers and the core members are those on the Editorial Board: Asher Benzion Buchman, Sheldon Epstein, David Guttmann, the late Shlomo Sprecher, and Heshey Zelcer. Two of the board members have semikhah but none are rabbis by profession. R. Asher Benzion Buchman is the Editor-in-Chief.  Policies  Upon the release of each new volume Hakirah posts the first two pages of each article on its web page except for the lead article which it publishes in full. When the following volume is published the full text of all the articles in the previous volume are made available on its web page. Transliteration of Hebrew words into English should follow the conventions of either Encyclopedia Judaica or ArtScroll.  Important articles  Hakirah contains articles from rabbis, doctors, scholars and lay-people throughout the world. Some of the articles which created a sensation upon publication are: * ‚ÄúMezizah be-Peh ‚Äì Therapeutic Touch or Hippocratic Vestige?‚Äù by Shlomo Sprecher argues against the need to perform Mezizah with the mouth and shows that Hatam Sofer was of the same opinion.Hakirah, vol. 3, pp. 15-66 (accessed 27 January 2008)Hakirah, vol. 4, pp. 9-19(accessed 27 January 2008) * ‚ÄúIs Handshaking a Torah Violation?‚Äù by Yehuda Henkin argues that for a man to shake a woman‚Äôs hand in a business setting is not a Biblical prohibition (see Negiah).Hakirah vol. 4, pp. 115-120 (accessed 27 January 2008) See also letters and follow-up in the following volume.Hakirah vol. 5. pp. 8-27(accessed 27 January 2008) * A pair of articles by Aharon Hersh Fried ‚ÄúAre our Children too Worldly?‚Äù Hakirah, vol. 4, pp. 37-67 (accessed 27 January 2008) and ‚ÄúIs there a Disconnect between Torah Learning and Torah Living‚Äù Hakirah, vol. 6, pp. 11-56 (accessed 27 January 2008) examines the failures of a yeshiva education. * ‚ÄúA Hagiographer‚Äôs Review of ‚ÄúStudies in Maimonides and His Interpreters‚Äù‚Äù by Asher Benzion Buchman Hakirah, vol. 7, pp. 107-154 challenges the claim of an academic that Rambam was careless and made many errors. * Three articles in volume 7 by Yehuda Henkin,Hakirah, vol. 7, pp.19-24 Marc D.

It was initially regarded as a form of lymphocyte-derived cutaneous lymphoma and alternatively named CD4+CD56+ hematodermic tumor, blastic NK cell lymphoma, and agranular CD4+ NK cell leukemia. Later, however, the disease was determined to be a malignancy of plasmacytoid dendritic cells rather than lymphocytes and therefore termed blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. In 2016, the World Health Organization designated BPDCN to be in its own separate category within the myeloid class of neoplasms. It is estimated that BPDCN constitutes 0.44% of all hematological malignancies. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is an aggressive malignancy with features of cutaneous lymphoma (e.g. malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltrations into the skin to form single or multiple lesions) and/or leukemia (i.e. malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cells in blood and bone marrow). While commonly presenting with these clinical features, BPDCN, particularly in its more advanced stages, may also involve malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cell infiltrations in and thereby injury to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, central nervous system, or other tissues. The neoplasm occurs in individuals of all ages but predominates in the elderly; in children, it afflicts males and females equally but in adults is far more common (~75% of cases) in males. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm typically responds to chemotherapy regimens used to treat hematological malignancies. All too often, however, the disease rapidly recurs and does so in a more drug-resistant form. Furthermore, the disease may occur in association with the myelodysplastic syndrome or transform to acute myeloid leukemia. Consequently, BPDCN has a very low 5 year survival rate. Current translational research studies on treating BPDCN have therefore focused on non-chemotherapeutic regimens that target the molecular pathways which may promote the disease.  Presentation  Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm occurs in children, including neonates, but is more common in adults, particularly those between the ages 60‚Äì80. BPDCN usually (i.e. 61% to 90% of cases) presents with skin lesions, i.e. nodules, tumors, red or purple papules, bruise-like patches, and/or ulcers that most often occur on the head, face, and upper torso. The lesions are due to diffuse infiltrations of the skin by malignant pDC. In one large study, this presentation was accompanied by swollen lymph nodes, usually in the neck, due to malignant pDC infiltrations (~50% of cases); enlarged liver (~16% of cases) and/or spleen (26% of cases), also due to malignant pDC infiltrations; increased levels of malignant pDC in blood (i.e. >2% of nucleated cells) (~40% of cases), bone marrow (~65% of cases) and cerebrospinal fluid (47% of childhood cases but less often detected in adult cases). More advanced or severe cases may present with extreme organ and/or lymph node enlargements, skin lesions in virtually any site, and clinical evidence of malignant pDC infiltrations in the breasts, eyes, kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, bone, sinuses, ears, or testes. About 10% of individuals with BPDCN present with a leukemia-like disease, i.e. they exhibit circulating malignant pDC, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or leukopenia due to extensive malignant pDC infiltrations in the bone marrow. A leukemic phase of the disease is a common feature of end stage and post- therapy relapsing BPDCN.  Pathophysiology  There are three types of dendritic cells, plasmacytic dendritic cells (pDC) and two types of conventional dendritic cells (cDC), myeloid cDC1 and myeloid cDC2. pDC circulate in the blood, representing <0.4% of all nucleated blood cells, and are present in various hematological tissues such as lymph nodes and spleen. Their major function is to detect and then initiate immune responses to intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses such as the cold sore-causing Herpes simplex viruses, HIV, and hepatitis viruses but also bacteria such as the tuberculosis-causing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi such as the aspergillosis-causing Aspergillus fumigatus and parasites such as malaria- causing Plasmodium falciparum. Following detection of these intracellular pathogens, pCD initiate immune responses by producing massive amounts of type I and type III interferons as well as by differentiating (i.e. maturing) into conventional dendritic cells that further promote immune responses by, e.g. functioning as antigen-presenting cells. The malignant pDC in BPDCN have the appearance of immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells. They are distinguished from other dendritic, myeloid, lymphoid and NK cell types by exhibiting at least several of the following properties: 1) plasmacytoid morphology; 2) production of large amounts of type I interferons when properly stimulated; 3) ability to differentiate into conventional dendritic cells when properly stimulated; 4) the expression of key marker proteins such as granzyme B, TCF4, interleukin-3 receptor (i.e. CD123), CLEC4C, and Neuropilin, and 5) failure to express certain marker proteins that are commonly expressed by myeloid, lymphoid, and NK cell lineages. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm typically arises after the serial acquisition of multiple genetic abnormalities in pDC or their precursor cells. Inactivating mutations (i.e. mutations which cause the gene to make no or a less active product) in the TET2 gene are the most common genetic abnormality in the disease, occurring in 32-67% of all BPDCN cases and often accompanied by mutations in either the NPM1 or SRSF2 gene. Numerous other genetic abnormalities are associated with the disease: 1) mutations in NRAS, ASXL1, and TP53; 2) deletions of the CDKN2A-ARF-CDKN2B locus on the short arm of chromosome 9, CDKN1B locus on the short arm of chromosome 12, RB1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 13, or NRC1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 5; 3) fusions of KMT2A on the long arm of chromosome 11 with MLLT1 on the short arm of chromosome 10, SUPT3H on the short arm of chromosome with MYC on the long arm of chromosome 8, or KMT2A on the long arm of chromosome 11 with MLLT1 on the long arm of chromosome 19; and 4) duplication or lose of entire chromosomes, particularly chromosomes 9, 13, or 15. Laboratory studies indicate that malignant pDC have a pathologically overactive NF-Œ∫B pathway that promotes their survival and production of various cytokines) that stimulate their own proliferation. Presumably, these genetic abnormalities lead to the activation of the NF-Œ∫B pathway and/or other cellular activation pathways which promote the survival, proliferation, and/or other malignant phenotypic traits in pDC and thereby cause BPDCN.  Diagnosis  BPDCN is suggested by a biopsy of skin lesions which reveals the infiltration by medium-sized blast (i.e. immature) cells into the dermis while sparing the epidermis. These cells exhibit irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, and at least one small nucleolus. Such blast cells may also be observed in the circulation, bone marrow, or other tissues and suggest BPDCN. However, the diagnosis of this disease requires determination that these cells are pDC blast cells rather than AML, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (TCLL), or aggressive NK-cell leukemia (NKL) blast cells. Various studies have offered similar but not identical criteria to make this determination. All studies agree that pDC should have a typical plasmacytoid morphology and express a particular profile of marker proteins as detected by immunoassay and/or flow cytometry. However, the studies disagree on which marker proteins to profile. One study's profile assayed 1) CD4, CD56, CD123 (i.e. Interleukin-3 receptor, and TLC1, which are expressed on 80-100% of pDC but uncommon on AML, TCLL, or NKL blasts); 2) CD2AP and CLEC4C which are unique to pDC; and 3) myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, CD34, CD14, CD11c, and CD163 which are unique to AML, TCLL, or NKL blasts. Two other studies recommended assaying somewhat different sets of marker proteins. Treatment  There have been no controlled studies to define the optimal treatment for BPDCN. Studies on small numbers of individuals with the disease have found that the standard chemotherapy regimens used for the initial induction treatments of AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and high-grade lymphoma give complete remission rates of 77%, 93%, and 80%, respectively, in childhood PBDN and 47%, 77%, and 53%, respectively, in adult PBDN. However, these remissions were short-lived: post- treatment mean times to relapse or death were 12 months for children and 6.8 months for adults. Given these poor remission and survival rates, other treatments have been added to the initial treatment regimens. Studies have shown that the addition of intrathecally administered drugs (administered directly into the spinal canal) as prophylaxis prolongs the period of CNS-free disease and increases overall survival. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following initial chemotherapy-induced remission also prolongs these remissions and, it is suggested, offers potential for curing the disease. (A graft-versus-leukemia effect may have contributed to the benefits seen after transplantation.) Studies have not yet determined whether allogenic (i.e. taken from others) or autologous (i.e. taken from self) stem cells achieve better results, although one retrospective study in Japan found that autologous stem cells gave significantly better overall and progression-free survival rates. A phase I clinical research study to test the safety and efficacy of a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of methotrexate, L-asparaginase, idarubicin, and dexamethasone followed by allogenic or autologous bone marrow transplantation in 26 participants newly diagnosed with BPDCN is planned but not yet in its recruiting phase.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03599960?cond=Blastic+Plasmacytoid+Dendritic+Cell+Neoplasm&rank;=4 While few studies have reported on the treatment of BPDCN that has recurred following initial therapy, donor lymphocyte infusions coupled with alternative chemotherapy treatments have induced second complete or partial remissions in a few patients. = Tagraxofusp-erzs = Tagraxofusp-erzs (trade name Elzonris; formerly SL-401 and DT388-IL3) was approved in the United States in December 2018 for the treatment of BPDCN. Tagraxofusp-erzs is a fusion protein consisting of interleukin 3 (i.e. IL-3) fused to diphtheria toxin. The fusion protein readily kills cultured pDC by binding to their IL-3 receptors to thereby gain entrance to the cells and then blocking these cells' protein synthesis (due to diphtheria toxin-mediated inhibition of eukaryotic elongation factor 2).  Prognosis  Due to the high rates of recurrence following initial therapy and the short overall survival times of individuals with BPDCN, prognosis of the disease is poor. However, further study of treatment regimens that include intrathecal chemotherapy and hematological stem cell transplantation in initial treatment regimens (see previous section) and newer non-chemotherapeutic drug treatments (see next section) may improve this situation.  Research = UCART123 = UCART123 are chimeric T cell receptor-bearing cells, i.e. T lymphocytes engineered to bear a monoclonal antibody that directs them to attack and kill BPDCN cells. The intravenous infusion of these cells in patients with BPDCN is in phase 1 clinical trials but in September 2017, the Federal Drug Administration suspended these because one patient developed a Grade 5 (i.e. lethal) cytokine release syndrome (see UCART123#CAR-T cancer treatment). The suspension was lifted in November 2017 after the trial used reduced amounts of the cells and with additional conditions were applied.FDA Lifts Clinical Hold on Cellectis‚Äô UCART123 Phase 1 Trials in AML, BPDCN. nov 2017 A new phase 1 clinical trial is now recruiting 76 new patients to study the safety and efficacy of UCAR123 in treating BPDCN.

It has received media attention for its acts of moral policing, including the 2009 Mangalore pub attack. Formation The Sri Ram Sena was founded in the late 1960s by Kalki Maharaj, the right-hand man of Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray, and also a former member of the Bajrang Dal and the Vishva Hindu Parishad. Activities and accusations  The group is mentioned in the charge sheet filed by the Maharashtra Police following the 2006 Malegaon blasts. In the transcript of a conversation, the prime accused, Prasad Shrikant Purohit, is heard praising the Shri Ram Sena and calling Pramod Muthalik its leader. Muthalik staunchly defended Pragya Singh Thakur, another of the accused, saying she was innocent. An investigation found that neither the Sri Ram Sena nor Muthalik were involved in the blasts. In an interview with Rediff.com, Muthalik said, \\"Look at the Hubli case where so many terrorists were arrested. These arrests helped in cracking a nationwide nexus of the Students Islamic Movement of India. It was our boys who gave information about these terrorists and on the basis of our information the police nabbed these anti-national elements.\\" On 24 August 2008, the Sri Ram Sena vandalized an Exhibition of M F Hussain's paintings in Delhi. The exhibition had been organized by SAHMAT, an NGO, to protest against the exclusion of Husain's works from the concurrent India Art Summit. On 27 October 2008, activists of the Sri Ram Sena ransacked the central office of the Samajwadi Party in New Delhi, in retaliation for defamatory comments alleged to have been made by the Samajwadi leadership against slain Delhi Police Inspector M C Sharma. Taking responsibility for the attack, the Sri Ram Sena's national general secretary Binay Kumar Singh told the Press Trust of India that he and his supporters had entered the premises of the Samajwadi Party office and damaged some vehicles parked inside, as well as furniture and hoardings. The members of the Sena attacked young men and women after dragged them out of a pub in Mangalore, on 24 January 2009. A group of 40 activists of the Sena barged into the pub \\"Amnesia ‚Äî The Lounge\\" and beat up a group of young women and men, claiming the women were violating traditional Indian values. Two of the women were hospitalized. The video of the incident has become one of the most watched clips on YouTube, though how the TV crew happened to be ready at the 'unannounced' attack is not known. Commenting on the incident, founder Pramod Muthalik said \\"Whoever has done this has done a good job. Girls going to pubs is not acceptable. So, whatever the Sena members did was right. You are highlighting this small incident to malign the BJP government in the state.\\" In January 2009, Muthalik announced a plan to target couples found dating on 14 February, Valentine's Day. He said \\"Our activists will go around with a priest, a turmeric stub and a mangalsutra on 14 February. If we come across couples being together in public and expressing their love, we will take them to the nearest temple and conduct their marriage.\\" On 9 February 2008, P. Chidambaram the Indian Minister of Home Affairs, said, \\"Sri Ram Sena is a threat to the country. The Centre is watching its activities with great concern\\". Muthalik's remarks aroused widespread criticism and protests like the Pink Chaddi Campaign. As a precaution, Muthalik and 140 others of the Sri Ram Sena were held in preventive custody on Valentine‚Äôs Eve and released a few days later. On 12 October 2011 a few Sri Ram Sena activists allegedly assaulted senior lawyer and social activist Prashant Bhushan in his Supreme Court chamber. The Sena leadership denied any involvement.

It sold all categories of musical instruments, instrument accessories and sheet music. In 2010 it became Allans Billy Hyde, but collapsed in 2012. It collapsed again in 2018 but into voluntary administration. Shortly after, the ATO ordered the company to enter liquidation. History A 1925 article in The Australian Musical News outlining the history of the founders and companies which became Allans Music. Gawler Place, Adelaide, Winter 2008. Allans was established in May, 1850 when Joseph Wilkie and John Campbell Webster started a music warehouse (Wilkie and Webster) in Collins Street, Melbourne. George Leavis Allan joined the company in 1862, then twelve years after becoming a junior partner Allan found himself sole proprietor. (The original store had signage \\"Wilkie, Webster & Allan\\".) His son George became a partner in 1881 when the name of the firm was formally altered to Allans and Company. By 1877 it was the largest musical warehouse south of the equator, a distinction it retained; in spite of many changes in musical retailing, the firm of Allan built its name into the record of Australian music. The company subsequently became Allans Music Australia Ltd. It was bought by Brashs, to become Australia's biggest music retail chain. Brashs collapsed (going into receivership in 1994 and in 1998), and Allans Music was subsequently bought by private investors, including The Roland Corporation. In 2005 The Brackenbury Group acquired Allans Music and as at 2009, operates seven physical stores (three in Victoria, two in New South Wales and one each in Queensland and South Australia) and an online presence. =2012 and 2018 Demise= In 2010, Allans Music merged with Billy Hyde Music to become the largest music retailer in Australia. The company was later placed into receivership on 23 August 2012. All stores with the exception of Mona Vale (New South Wales), Shepparton (Victoria), and Darwin (Northern Territory) faced imminent closure. In November 2012, the majority of the Allans/Billy Hyde stores were liquidated. The final day of trading was on Sunday, 25 November. On 28 November 2012, it was announced that rival music company Gallins music had successfully purchased Allans Billy Hyde effective that date, meaning major stores would re open. The company was placed in voluntary administration on 20 June 2018 after mass store closures to downsize the company and allegedly again owing employees. On 20 July, the company faced court over a case with the ATO and the Federal Court declared the Group insolvent and ordered it to be wound up. The company appointed Ferrier Hodgson as voluntary administrator and liquidator and was looking to still sell the business, but was holding a liquidation sale at the same time.

It collapsed on January 28, 1922 under the weight of snow from a two-day blizzard that was later dubbed the Knickerbocker Storm. The theater was showing Get- Rich-Quick Wallingford at the time of the collapse, which killed 98 patrons and injured 133 more. The disaster ranks as one of the worst in Washington, D.C., history. Former Congressman Andrew Jackson Barchfeld and a number of prominent political and business leaders were among those killed in the theater. The theater's architect, Reginald Geare, and owner, Harry Crandall, later died by suicide, in 1927 and 1937, respectively. Theater The Knickerbocker Theatre was commissioned by Harry Crandall in 1917. Designed by architect Reginald Geare, it had a seating capacity of 1,700. In addition to serving as a movie theater, it also served as a concert and lecture hall, with ballrooms, luxurious parlors and lounges. Collapse On January 28, 1922, the Knickerbocker was showing the silent comedy Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford. News reports estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people were in the theater that evening. Two days before, a massive blizzard had begun and lasted 28 hours, resulting in significant accumulation of snow and ice throughout the Washington, DC area. It was the worst snowfall in the area since 1899, and much of the city was paralyzed by it. The snow accumulation on the Knickerbocker's flat roof put significant strain on the structure, and on the evening of the 28th, it gave way. The Knickerbocker Theatre from the outside after the collapse of the roof The collapse occurred suddenly just after 9:00 PM. Witnesses reported that they had no hint of danger such as creaking or loud noises beforehand. With a loud noise, the roof of the theater collapsed onto the concrete balcony, and both in turn collapsed onto the orchestra seating section. In the moments after the collapse, a witness called a telephone operator, who spread the alarm to police, firefighters, and hospitals. She also phoned the city government, which ordered the immediate closure of all theaters in the city to prevent loss of life from any further collapses. People nearby during the collapse rushed to help, although their efforts were disorganized until the arrival of more than 600 soldiers and Marines. It took time for authorities to gain control of the scene as relatives of people in the theater tried to gain entry. Authorities also experienced delays in getting fire engines and other equipment to the scene as the streets of the city were nearly impassable in places due to snow and vehicles that had become stuck during the blizzard. However, a fleet of ambulances from Walter Reed Army Medical Center and volunteer taxis were able to reach the scene and evacuate some of the injured to hospitals.Interior of the theater after the collapse Even with large numbers of police, firemen, and military personnel, by 2:30 the next day the rescuers had still not been able to remove debris from the balcony and reach those who had been seated in the orchestra. While they worked, a young boy crawled through the rubble and delivered water to the victims to keep them alive. Neighboring houses and stores were used temporarily to give medical treatment to victims of the collapse, and a nearby Christian Science Church was used as a morgue. In total, 98 people died as a result of the collapse, and a further 133 were injured. Nearby residents, including the theater‚Äôs architect, Reginald Geare, helped pull bodies from the debris and feed the rescuers, also supplying them with hot drinks. Geare‚Äôs knowledge of the building‚Äôs design was invaluable in the rescue work. Many of those being pulled from the rubble were either dead or barely conscious. Contemporary accounts described severe crushing injuries that resulted in loss of limbs or forced amputations in order to extricate the victims. Among the victims was former Pennsylvania congressman Andrew Jackson Barchfeld, and other politicians, members of the diplomatic corps, and businessmen. Many media reports focused on less famous but more tragic figures, such as a violinist in the theater's orchestra who had been married five days previously and a honeymooning couple who were attending the movie that night. Another report mentioned a young boy who was brought to the temporary morgue to identify the bodies of both of his parents and his two sisters. Aftermath Former site of the Knickerbocker Theatre A number of investigations were conducted into the causes of the collapse by the Washington, D.C., city government, both houses of Congress, the city coroner, and the courts. Early witness accounts suggested that theater employees had discussed removing the snow from the roof, but had decided that it was unnecessary. The investigations concluded that the collapse was most likely the result of faulty design, blaming the use of arch girders rather than stone pillars to support the roof. However, a number of lawsuits that resulted from the collapse were unsuccessful, as courts were unable to determine who was liable. The year after the collapse, a new theater was built in the same location, dubbed the Ambassador Theater. This would in turn be torn down during a 1960s era urban renewal project, and the site is now the location of a Sun Trust bank.The building is shaped like a movie theater, to pay homage to the Knickerbocker Theater. Geare, whose career had been effectively ended by the collapse, died by suicide in 1927. Crandall died by suicide ten years later, leaving a note for reporters asking them not to be too hard on him. The storm which led to the collapse was later dubbed the Knickerbocker Storm. Book In 2013, The Knickerbocker Snowstorm (Images of America), was released.

Marshall was distinguished for research in the field of tumour cell signalling. His track record includes the discovery of the N-Ras oncogene , the identification of farnesylation of Ras proteins, and the discovery that Ras signals through the MAPK/ERK pathway. These findings have led to therapeutic development of inhibitors of Ras farnesylation, MEK and B-Raf.  Early life  Marshall was born in Birmingham, UK, and educated at the King Henry VIII School, Coventry. He then studied Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge followed by a DPhil in cell biology at the University of Oxford. His graduate studies were followed by post-doctoral work at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund laboratories at Lincoln‚Äôs Inn Fields (now part of the Francis Crick Institute) in London and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.  Oncogene research  In 1980, Marshall moved to The Institute of Cancer Research in London, and began studies to identify human cancer genes. This work, in collaboration with his colleague Alan Hall, resulted in the identification of NRAS, a new human oncogene. Subsequent work from his laboratory showed that NRAS has important roles in leukaemia and others demonstrated the role of NRAS in melanoma. Following the identification of NRAS, Marshall concentrated on studying how NRAS and the two other RAS genes, HRAS and KRAS, act in cancer. His work in the field of cell signalling showed how RAS and other signalling proteins are involved in transmitting signals from outside of the cell all the way to the cell nucleus. His work laid the foundation for studies that showed the importance of the BRAF cancer gene in melanoma. At the time of his death, Marshall's laboratory studied the cell signalling mechanisms that allow cancer cells to disseminate through the body.

Behavior trees employ a well-defined notation to unambiguously represent the hundreds or even thousands of natural language requirements that are typically used to express the stakeholder needs for a large-scale software-integrated system.Wen, L., Dromey, R.G. 2007. From Requirements Change to Design Change: A Formal Path  Overview  The amount of detail in the large number of natural language requirements for a large-scale system causes short-term memory overloadDromey, R.G. 2007. Principles for Engineering Large-Scale Software-Intensive SystemsBoston, J. 2008. Raytheon Australia supports pioneering systems research and may create a barrier that prevents anyone from gaining a deep, accurate and holistic understanding of the system needs. Also, because of the use of natural language, there are likely to be many ambiguities, aliases, inconsistencies, redundancies and incompleteness problems associated with the requirements information. This adds further to the uncertainty and complexity. Generally, at best, a few people understand parts of the system or situation well, but no one has other than a superficial understanding of the whole ‚Äì that is, the detailed integrated behavior of the system. The behavior tree representation, (with the help of the composition treeBehavior Engineering. Composition Trees representation that resolves alias and other vocabulary problems with large sets of requirements) allows people to avoid short-term memory overload and produce a deep, accurate, holistic representation of system needs that can be understood by all stakeholders because it strictly uses the vocabulary of the original requirements. Because the behavior tree notation uses a formal semantics, for any given example, it already is, or can be made executable. = Behavior tree forms = Set of four requirements behavior trees Requirements Integration Process Single and composite or integrated behavior tree forms are both important in the application of behavior trees in systems and software engineering. * Requirement behavior trees: Initially, individual requirement behavior trees (RBTs) are used to capture all the fragments of behavior in each individual natural language requirement by a process of rigorous, intent- preserving and vocabulary-preserving translation. The translation process can uncover a range of defects in original natural language requirements. * Integrated behavior trees: Because a set of requirements imply the integrated behavior of a system, all the individual requirement behavior trees can be composed to construct an integrated behavior tree (IBT) that provides a single holistic view of the emergent integrated behavior of the system. This enables the building of the integrated behavior of a system out of its requirements.Winter, K. 2007. Formalising Behaviour Trees with CSP An analogy to help describe this process is the transition from a randomly arranged set of jigsaw puzzle pieces to putting each of the pieces in its appropriate place. When we do this, we see each piece of information in its intended context and we see the pieces of information as a whole and the emergent properties of the whole. Having all the requirements converted to behavior trees (RBTs) is similar to having all the pieces for a jigsaw puzzle randomly spread out on a table - until we put all the pieces together we cannot see the emergent picture and whether any pieces are missing or do not fit. Constructing an integrated behavior tree (IBT) allows us to do this. = Behavior engineering process = ;Representation used - (critical) * BEHAVIOR TREES provide a vehicle for growing a shared understanding of a complex system. * The role of the COMPOSITION TREE in the overall process is to provide a vehicle for overcoming the imperfect knowledge associated with the large set of requirements for a system. ;Process used - (critical) * BEHAVIOR ENGINEERING uses behavior trees to control complexity while growing a shared understanding of a complex system. * That shared, holistic understanding of a complex system, because it integrates the requirements, shows the emergent behavior of the system implied by requirements. Phases of the behavior modelling process  History  Behavior trees and the concepts for their application in systems and software engineering were originally developed by DromeyR.G.Dromey, \\"Formalizing the Transition from Requirements to Design\\" , in \\"Mathematical Frameworks for Component Software ‚Äì Models for Analysis and Synthesis\\", Jifeng He, and Zhiming Liu (Eds.), World Scientific Series on Component-Based Development, pp. 156‚Äì187, (Invited Chapter) (2006)R.G.Dromey, From Requirements to Design: Formalizing the Key Steps , (Invited Keynote Address), SEFM-2003, IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods, Brisbane, Sept. 2003, pp. 2‚Äì11.R.L.Glass, \\"Is This a Revolutionary Idea or Not\\" , Communications of the ACM, Vol. 47(11), pp. 23‚Äì25, Nov. 2004.R.G.Dromey, \\"Climbing Over the ‚ÄòNo Silver Bullet‚Äô Brick Wall\\" , IEEE Software, Vol. 23, No. 2, pp. 118‚Äì120, (March 2006) with first publication of some of the key ideas in 2001.R.G.Dromey, Genetic Software Engineering - Simplifying Design Using Requirements Integration, IEEE Working Conference on Complex and Dynamic Systems Architecture, Brisbane, Dec 2001. Early publications on this work used the terms \\"genetic software engineering\\" and \\"genetic design\\" to describe the application of behavior trees. The reason for originally using the word genetic was because sets of genes, sets of jigsaw puzzle pieces and sets of requirements represented as behavior trees all appeared to share several key properties: * they contained enough information as a set to allow them to be composed ‚Äì with behavior trees this allows a system to be built out of its requirements * the order in which the pieces were put together was not important ‚Äì with requirements this aids coping with complexity * when all the members of the set were put together the resulting integrated entity exhibited a set of important emergent properties. For behavior trees important emergent properties include * the integrated behavior of the system implied by the requirements * the coherent behavior of each component referred to in the requirements. These genetic parallels, in another context, were originally spelled by Woolfson,A. Woolfson, Living Without Genes, Flamingo, 2000, (A. Woolfson, Living Without Genes, Flamingo, 2000) Further weight for use of the term genetic came from eighteenth-century thinker Giambattista Vico, who said, \\"To understand something, and not merely be able to describe it, or analyse it into its component parts, is to understand how it came into being ‚Äì its genesis, its growth ‚Ä¶ true understanding is always genetic\\".Berlin, I. The Crooked Timber of Humanity: Chapters in the History of Ideas, Ed., H.Hardy, Princeton University Press, 1998 Despite these legitimate genetic parallels it was felt that this emphasis led to confusion with the concept of genetic algorithms. As a result, the term behavior engineering was introduced to describe the processes that exploit behavior trees to construct systems. The term \\"behavior engineering\\" has previously been used in a specialized area of Artificial Intelligence - robotics research. The present use embraces a much broader rigorous formalization and integration of large sets of behavioral and compositional requirements needed to model large-scale systems. Since the behavior tree notation was originally conceived a number of people from the DCCS (Dependable Complex Computer-based Systems Group ‚Äì a joint University of Queensland, Griffith University research group) have made important contributions to the evolution and refinement of the notation and to the use of behavior trees. Members of this group include: David Carrington, Rob Colvin, Geoff Dromey, Lars Grunske, Ian Hayes, Diana Kirk, Peter Lindsay, Toby Myers, Dan Powell, John Seagrott, Cameron Smith, Larry Wen, Nisansala Yatapanage, Kirsten Winter, Saad Zafar, Forest Zheng. Probabilistic timed behavior trees have recently been developed by Colvin, Grunske and Winter so that reliability, performance and other dependability properties can be expressed.Colvin, R., Grunske, L., Winter, K. 2007 Probabilistic Timed Behavior Trees  Key concepts = Behavior tree notation = Core elements of the behavior tree notation A behavior tree is used to formally represent the fragment of behavior in each individual requirement. Behavior for a large-scale system in general, where concurrency is admitted, appears abstractly as a set of communicating sequential processes. The behavior tree notation captures these composed component-states in a simple tree-like form. Behavior is expressed in terms of components realizing states and components creating and breaking relations. Using the logic and graphic forms of conventions found in programming languages, components can support actions, composition, events, control-flow, data-flow, and threads. Traceability tags (see Section 1.2 of behavior tree notation) in behavior tree nodes link the formal representation to the corresponding natural language requirement. Behavior trees accurately capture behavior expressed in the natural language representation of functional requirements. Requirements behavior trees strictly use the vocabulary of the natural language requirements but employ graphical forms for behavior composition in order to eliminate risk of ambiguity. By doing this they provide a direct and clearly traceable relationship between what is expressed in the natural language representation and its formal specification.Dromey, R.G. \\"Genetic Design: Amplifying Our Ability to Deal With Requirements Complexity\\" , in S.Leue, and T.J. Systra, Scenarios, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, LNCS 3466, pp. 95‚Äì108, 2005. A basis of the notation is that behavior is always associated with some component. Component-states which represent nodes of behavior are composed sequentially or concurrently to construct a behavior tree that represents the behavior expressed in the natural language requirements. A behavior tree with leaf nodes may revert (symbolized by adding the caret operator ^) to an ancestor node to repeat behavior, or start a new thread (symbolized by two carets ^^). A behavior tree specifies state changes in components, how data and control is passed between components and how threads interact. There are constructs for creating and breaking relations. There are also constructs for setting and testing states of components as well as mechanisms for inter-process communication that include message passing (events), shared variable blocking and synchronization. For a complete reference to behavior tree notation, version 1.0, see: Behavior Tree Notation v1.0 (2007)Behavior Tree Group, ARC Centre for Complex Systems, 2007.Behavior Tree Notation v1.0 (2007) = Semantics = The formal semantics of behavior trees is given via a process algebra and its operational semantics.Colvin, R., Hayes, I.J. 2006 A Semantics for Behavior Trees The semantics has been used as the basis for developing simulation, model checking and failure modes and effects analysis.L.Grunske, P.Lindsay, N.Yatapanage, K.Winter, An Automated Failure Mode and Effect Analysis Based on High-Level Design Specification with Behavior Trees, Fifth International Conference on Integrated Formal Methods (IFM-2005), Eindoven, The Netherlands, 2005.Zafar, S. and Dromey, R. G., (2005), Integrating Safety and Security Requirements into Design of an Embedded System. Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference 2005, 15‚Äì17 December, Taipei, Taiwan. IEEE Computer Society Press. pp. 629‚Äì636. = Requirements translation = Example requirement translation Requirements behavior tree integration Requirements translation is the vehicle used to cross the informal-formal barrier. Consider the process of translation for requirement R1 below. The first tasks are to identify the components (bold), identify the behaviors ( _underline_ ) and identify indicators of the order (italics) in which behaviors take place. The corresponding behavior tree can then be constructed. What is clear from the outcome of this process is that apart from pronouns, definite articles, etc., essentially all the words in the sentences that contribute to the behavior they describe have been accounted for and used. = Requirements integration = Once the set of requirements are formalized as individual requirement behavior trees, two joint properties of systems and requirements need to be exploited in order to proceed with composing the integrated behavior tree: * In general, a fragment of behavior expressed by a requirement always has associated with it a precondition which needs to be satisfied before the behavior can take place (this precondition may or may not be expressed in the requirement). * If the requirement is really part of the system then some other requirement in the set must establish the precondition needed in (1). :For requirements represented as behavior trees this amounts to finding where the root node of one tree occurs in some other behavior tree and integrating the two trees at that node. The example below illustrates requirements integration for two requirements, R1 and R3. In other words, it shows how these two requirements interact. = Operations on integrated behavior trees = Once an integrated behavior tree has been composed, there are a number of important operations that can be performed upon it.  Inspection: defect detection and correction  In general, many defects become much more visible when there is an integrated view of the requirements and each requirement has been placed in the behavior context where it needs to execute. For example, it is much easier to tell whether a set of conditions or events emanating from a node is complete and consistent. The traceability tags also make it easy to refer back to the original natural-language requirements. There is also the potential to automate a number of defect and consistency checks on an integrated behavior tree.Smith, C., Winter, K., Hayes, I., Dromey, R.G., Lindsay, P., Carrington, D.: An Environment for Building a System Out of Its Requirements, 19th IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, Linz, Austria, Sept. (2004). When all defects have been corrected and the IBT is logically consistent and complete it becomes a model behavior tree (MBT) which serves as a formal specification for the system‚Äôs behavior that has been constructed out of the original requirements. This is the clearly defined stopping point for the analysis phase. With other modelling notations and methods (for instance, with UML) it is less clear-cut when modelling can stop. In some cases, parts of a model behavior tree may need to be transformed to make the specification executable. Once an MBT has been made executable it is possible to carry out a number of other dependability checks.  Simulation  A model behavior tree can be readily simulated to explore the dynamic properties of the system. Both a symbolic tool and a graphics tool have been constructed to support these activities.L.Wen, R.Colvin, K.Lin, J.Seagrott, N.Yatapanage, R.G.Dromey, 2007, \\"Integrare, a Collaborative Environment for Behavior-Oriented Design\\", in Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization and Engineering, LNCS 4674, pp. 122‚Äì131, 2007C.

Model-checking  A translator has been written to convert a model behavior tree into the \\"actions systems\\" language. This input can then be fed into the SAL Model-checkerBensalem, S., Ganesh, V., Lakhnech, Y., Mu√±oz, C., Owre, et al.: \\"An Overview of SAL\\", Fifth NASA Langley Formal Methods Workshop (LFM 2000), 2000, pp. 187‚Äì196.Rushby, J. Automated Formal Methods 2006 AFM-2006, Automated Formal Methods 2006, Seattle, August 2006, pp. 6‚Äì7. in order to allow checks to be made as to whether certain safety and security properties are satisfied.Zafar, S. and Dromey, R. G., 2005. Managing Complexity in Modelling Embedded Systems. Systems Engineering/Test and Evaluation Conference 2005, 7‚Äì9 November, Brisbane, Australia  Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)  Model-checking has often been applied to system models to check that hazardous states cannot be reached during normal operation of the system.Grunske, L., Colvin, R., Winter, K. Probabilistic Model-Checking Support for FMEA Quantitative Evaluation of Systems. QEST 2007. Fourth International Conference on the Quantitative Evaluation of Systems, 17-19 Sept. 2007 pp. 119‚Äì128 It is possible to combine model-checking with behavior trees to provide automated support for failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). The advantage of using behavior trees for this purpose is that they allow the formal method aspects of the approach to be hidden from non-expert users.  Requirements change  The ideal that is sought when responding to a change in the functional requirements for a system is that it can be quickly determined: * where to make the change, * how the change affects the architecture of the existing system, * which components of the system are affected by the change, and * what behavioral changes will need to be made to the components (and their interfaces) that are affected by the change of requirements. Because a system is likely to undergo many sets of changes over its service time, there is also a need to record, manage and optimize the system‚Äôs evolution driven by the change sequence. A traceability model, which uses behavior trees as a formal notation to represent functional requirements, reveals change impacts on different types of design constructs (documents) caused by the changes of the requirements.Wen, L., Dromey, R.G. 2005. Architecture Normalization for Component-Based Systems Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on Formal Aspects of Component Software FACS'05, pp. 247‚Äì261. The model introduces the concept of evolutionary design documents that record the change history of the designs. From these documents, any version of a design document as well as the difference between any two versions can be retrieved. An important advantage of this model is that the major part of the procedure to generate these evolutionary design documents can be supported by automated tools.  Code generation and execution  The behavior tree representation of the integrated behavior of the system affords several important advantages as an executable model. It clearly separates the tasks of component integration from the task of individual component implementation. The integrated behavior of the system that emerges from integrating the requirements can be used as a foundation to create a design by applying design decisions. The result is a design behavior tree (DBT): an executable multithreaded component integration specification that has been built out of the original requirements. Behavior tree models are executed in a virtual machine called the behavior run-time environment (BRE). The BRE links together components using middleware,RTI Inc. 2007 \\"Meeting Real-Time Requirements in Integrated Defense Systems\\", RTI White Paper . allowing components to be independent programs written in one of several languages that can be executed in a distributed environment. The BRE also contains an expression parser that automatically performs simple operations to minimize the amount of code required to be manually implemented in the component. The implementation of components is supported by views that are automatically extractable from the DBT. These views provide the component behavior trees (CBTs) of individual components together with the interfaces of individual components. This information, together with the information in the integrated composition tree (ICT) captured about each individual component, provides the information that is needed to implement each individual component. Several BRE‚Äôs can be linked together to form complex systems using a system-of-systems construct and the behavior engineering component integration environment (BECIE). BECIE is also used to monitor and control the behavior tree models being executed within a BRE, similar to supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems used in industrial process control. Executable behavior trees have been developed for case studiesDromey, R.G. Using Behavior Trees to Model the Autonomous Shuttle System , 3rd International Workshop on Scenarios and State Machines: Models, Algorithms, and Tools (SCESM04) ICSE Workshop W5S, Edinburgh, 25 May 2004 including automated train protection, mobile robots with dynamic object following, an ambulatory infusion pump and traffic light management systems. A version of the BRE suited for embedded systems (eBRE) is also available that has reduced functionality to tailor it to small-footprint microcontrollers.  Applications  Behavior tree modelling can and has been applied to a diverse range of applications over a number of years. Some of the main application areas are described below. = Large-scale systems = Modeling large-scale systems with large sets of natural-language requirements have always been the major focus for trialling behavior trees and the overall behavior engineering process. Conducting these evaluations and trials of the method has involved work with a number of industry partners and government departments in Australia. The systems studied have included a significant number of defense systems, enterprise systems, transportation systems, information systems, health systems and sophisticated control systems with stringent safety requirements. The results of these studies have all been commercial-in- confidence. However the results of the extensive industry trails with Raytheon Australia are presented below in the Industry Section. What all this work has consistently shown is that by translating requirements and creating dynamic and static integrated views of requirements a very significant number of major defects are discovered early, over and above the defects that are found by current industry best-practice. = Embedded systems = Failure of a design to satisfy a system‚Äôs requirements can result in schedule and cost overruns.Barker, D. 2000. Requirements modeling technology: a vision for better, faster, and cheaper systems. Proceedings from VHDL International Users Forum Fall Workshop, 2000. pp. 3‚Äì6. If there are also critical dependability issues, not satisfying system requirements can have life-threatening consequences.Leveson, N. G. Safeware: System Safety and Computers: [a guide to preventing accidents and losses caused by technology]. Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1995. However, in current approaches, ensuring requirements are satisfied is often delayed until late in the development process during a cycle of testing and debugging.Futrell, R. T., Shafer, D.F., Shafer, L.I. Quality Software Project Management (Software Quality Institute Series). Prentice Hall, 2002 This work describes how the system development approach, behavior engineering, can be used to develop software for embedded systems. The result is a model-driven development approach that can create embedded system software that satisfies its requirements, as a result of applying the development process. = Hardware‚Äìsoftware systems = Many large-scale systems consist of a mixture of co-dependent software and hardware. The different nature of software and hardware means they are often modelled separately using different approaches. This can subsequently lead to integration problems due to incompatible assumptions about hardware/software interactions.Myers, T., Fritzson, P., Dromey, R.G. 2008. Seamlessly Integrating Software & Hardware Modelling for Large-Scale Systems. 2nd International Workshop on Equation-Based Object-Oriented Languages and Tools (EOOLT 2008), Cyprus, July 2008. pp. 5‚Äì15. These problems can be overcome by integrating behavior trees with the Modelica, mathematical modelling approach. The environment and hardware components are modelled using Modelica and integrated with an executable software model that uses behavior trees. = Role-based access control = To ensure correct implementation of complex access control requirements, it is important that the validated and verified requirements are effectively integrated with the rest of the system.Zafar, S. Colvin, R., Winter, K., Yatapanage, N., Dromey, R.G. Early Validation and Verification of a Distributed Role-Based Access Control Model. 14th Asia- Pacific Software Engineering Conference, Nagoya, Japan, December 2008. pp. 430‚Äì437. It is also important that the system can be validated and verified early in the development process. An integrated, role-based access control model has been developed. The model is based on the graphical behavior tree notation, and can be validated by simulation, as well as verified using a model checker. Using this model, access control requirements can be integrated with the rest of the system from the outset, because: a single notation is used to express both access control and functional requirements; a systematic and incremental approach to constructing a formal behavior tree specification can be adopted; and the specification can be simulated and model checked. The effectiveness of the model has been evaluated using a case study with distributed access control requirements. = Biological systems = Because behavior trees describe complex behavior, they can be used for describing a range of systems not limited to those that are computer-based. In a biological context, BTs can be used to piece together a procedural interpretation of biological functions described in research papers, treating the papers as the requirements documents as described above. This can help to construct a more concrete description of the process than is possible from reading only, and can also be used as the basis for comparing competing theories in alternative papers. In ongoing research, the behavior tree notation is being used to develop models of the brain function in rats under fear conditioning. = Game AI modeling = While BTs have become popular for modeling the artificial intelligence in computer games such as HaloDamian Isla Handling Complexity in the Halo 2 AI. and Spore,Chris Hecker My Liner Notes for Spore these types of trees are very different from the ones described on this page, and are closer to a combination of hierarchical finite state machines or decision trees. Soccer-player modeling has also been a successful application of BTs.Xiao-Wen Terry Liu and Jacky Baltes An Intuitive and Flexible Architecture for Intelligent Mobile Robots 2nd International Conference on Autonomous Robots and Agents December 13‚Äì15, 2004 Palmerston North, New ZealandYukiko Hoshino, Tsuyoshi Takagi, Ugo Di Profio, and Masahiro Fujita Behavior description and control using behavior module for personal robot = Model Based Testing = Model Based Testing (MBT) Model-based testing is an approach to software testing that requires testers to create test models from requirements of Software Under Test (SUT). Traditionally, UML state charts, FSMs, EFSMs, Flow charts are used as the modeling language. Recently, an interesting approach in which Event-Driven Swim Lane Petri Net (EDSLPN) is used as the modeling language also appears. Behavior tree notation should be considered as a good modeling notation to MBT also, and it has a few advantages among other notations: # It has the same expressiveness level as UML state charts and EDSLPN # It is intuitive to use as a modeling notation due to its graphical nature # Each behavior tree node has a requirement tag, this makes creating a traceability matrix from requirement to test artifact a piece of cake Such an attempt has been made here.MBTester The MBTester is composed of a modeler and a test case generation engine. Business owners or testers translate their requirements into behavior trees using the modeler, and then (optionally) integrate a few related behavior trees into a composite one. A behavior tree can be fed into the backend engine to generate test cases, test scripts, and test data automatically.  Scalability and industry applications  Screen- shot of behavior engineering support environment tool Integrated behavior tree - larger system (more than 1000 requirements) The first industry trials to test the feasibility of the method and refine its capability were conducted in 2002. Over the last three years a number of systematic industry trials on large-scale defence, transportation and enterprise systems have been conducted.Powell, D. 2007. Requirements Evaluation Using Behavior Trees - Findings from Industry This work has established that the method scales to systems with large numbers of requirements but also that it is important to use tool support in order to efficiently navigate and edit such large integrated views of graphical data. Several main results have come out of this work with industry. On average, over a number of projects, 130 confirmed major defects per 1000 requirements have consistently been found after normal reviews and corrections have been made. With less mature requirements sets much higher defect rates have been observed. An important part of this work with industry has involved applying the analysis part of the method to six large-scale defence projects for Raytheon Australia. They see the method as \\"a key risk mitigation strategy, of use in both solution development and as a means of advising the customer on problems with acquisition documentation\\".McNicholas, D., (Raytheon Australia), 2007. Behavior Engineering Industry Benefits An outcome of these industry trials has been the joint developmentRaytheon Australia, 2008. Understanding grows on Behavior Trees with Raytheon Australia of an industry-strength tool to support the analysis, editing and display of large integrated sets of requirements.Phillips, V., (Raytheon Australia), \\"Implementing a Behavior Tree Analysis Tool Using Eclipse Development Frameworks\\", Australian Software Engineering Conference (ASWEC‚Äô08), Perth, March 2008 More extensive details of industry findings can be found on the Behavior Engineering website.Behavior Engineering.

Jim Boston, Raytheon Australia. *Raytheon Australia supports pioneering systems research  Benefits, advantages  As a behavior modelling representation, behavior trees have a number of significant benefits and advantages: * They employ a well-defined and effective strategy for dealing with requirements complexity, particularly where the initial needs of a system are expressed using hundreds or thousands of requirements written in natural language. This significantly reduces the risk on large-scale projects. * By rigorously translating then integrating requirements at the earliest possible time they provide a more effective means for uncovering requirements defects than competing methods.Boston, J., (Raytheon Australia), Behavior Trees - How they improve Engineering Behaviour?, 6th Annual Software and Systems Engineering Process Group Conference (SEPG 2008), Melbourne, Aug. 2008. * They employ a single, simple notation for analysis, specification and to represent the behavior design of a system. * They represent the system behavior as an executable integrated whole. * They build the behavior of a system out of its functional requirements in a directly traceable way which aids verification and validation.Zafar, S., K.Winter, R.Colvin, R.G.Dromey, \\"Verification of an Integrated Role-Based Access Control Model\\" , 1st International Workshop - Asian Working Conference on Verified Software (AWCVS'06), pp 230-240, Macao, Oct. 2006. * They can be understood by stakeholders without the need for formal methods training. By strictly retaining the vocabulary of the original requirements this eases the burden of understanding. * They have a formal semantics, they support concurrency, they are executable and they can be simulated, model-checked and used to undertake failure mode and effects analysis. * They can be used equally well to model human processes, to analyse contracts,Milosevic, Z., Dromey, R.G. On Expressing and Monitoring Behavior in Contracts, EDOC 2002, Proceedings, 6th International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference, Lausanne, Switzerland, Sept. 2002, pp. 3-14. to represent forensic information, to represent biological systems, and numerous other applications. In each case they deliver the same benefits in terms of managing complexity, and seeing things as a whole. They can also be used for safety critical systems, embedded systems and real-time systems.Lin, K., Chen, D., Sun, C., Dromey, R.G., A Constraint Maintenance Strategy and Applications in real-time Collaborative Environments, 2nd International Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization and Engineering (CDVE2005), 2005.Lin, K., Chen, D., Dromey, R.G., Sun, CZ.: Multi-way Dataflow Constraint Propagation in Real-time Collaborative Systems , IEEE, The 2nd International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom 2006), Atlanta, Georgia, USA, Nov, 2006.Grunske, L., Winter, K., Colvin, R., \\"Timed Behavior Trees and their application to verifying real- time systems\\" , Proceedings of 18th Australian Conference on Software Engineering (AEWEC 2007), April 2007, accepted for publication.  Criticisms, disadvantages  * For small textbook level examples, their tree-like nature means that the graphic models produced are sometimes not as compact as statechart or state machine behavior specifications. * Tool support is needed to navigate the very large integrated behavior trees for systems that have hundreds or thousands of requirements. * For group walkthroughs of very large systems good display facilities are needed. * There is a need to provide additional sophisticated tool support to fully exploit integrated behavior tree models.

The film was co-written by Cui Zi'en, one of the few openly gay writers in China. Cui also has a cameo-role in the film, as the host of an underground radio show. One of China's few films touching on LGBT-films, Men and Women was cast with openly gay actors. Unlike earlier films like Zhang Yuan's East Palace, West Palace, Men and Women focused on the daily lives of its characters, rather than their underground existence in Chinese society. The film won a FIPRESCI award at the 1999 Locarno International Film Festival.  Plot  Men and Women follows the travels of a young homosexual man, Xiao Bo, who goes to Beijing in search of a job. There he is taken in by Qing Jie, who not only gives him a home in her apartment, but also a job in her clothing store. While she tries to set Xiao Bo with her friend A Meng, Xiao Bo resists and eventually moves out when he is assaulted by Qing Jie's husband. He moves in with his friend, Chong Chong, with whom a romantic relationship is kindled. Qing Jie, meanwhile, discovers that she may have feelings for A Meng, and decides to leave her husband.

A human's mandible and teeth found in the cave have been carbon dated to 10,610 BCE. Above all that, there were a series of Archaic period campfires, dated between 8,500 and 7,000 BCE. Wood, bone, antler and fiber cordage were among the artifacts that were recovered from the level, as well as willow leaf, tanged, lanceolate, and concave base Ichuna/Arcata projectile points. A single grinding slab and a bone flesher were also recovered from this part of the area. Levels were included in the Early and Middle Horizon occupations, cist tombs, and wall paintings between about the 1000 BCE to 1000 CE. In the 1960s, archeologists discovered artifacts in an extraordinary state of preservation at the site. Remarkably, textiles, wood and leather tools, and basketry have been preserved intact. Some of the evidence of early domesticated beans Phaseolus, chili, corn and other cultivars have been argued for Guitarrero. Fiberwork found in the cave dates back over ten-thousand years ‚Äì the earliest found in South America.

Franek Kluski, real name Teofil Modrzejewski (1873-1943), was a Polish medium. Career Hand mould from a Kluski seance. Kluski was born in Warsaw. According to French psychical researcher Gustav Geley, Kluski's claimed psychic powers manifested themselves during childhood and after undergoing a psychological change he became Franek Kluski. Kluski's powers during s√©ances were said to include physical manifestation of human limbs and various animals.Geley, Gustav; Brath, Stanley De. (2003). Clairvoyance and Materialization. Kessinger Publishing. Between 8 November and 31 December 1920, Geley of the Institute Metapsychique International attended fourteen s√©ances with Kluski in Paris. A bowl of hot paraffin was placed in the room and according to Kluski spirits dipped their limbs into the paraffin and then into a bath of water to materialize. Three other series of s√©ances were held in Warsaw in Kluski's own apartment, these took place over a period of three years. Kluski was not searched in any of the s√©ances. Photographs of the moulds were obtained during the four series of experiments and were published by Geley in 1924.Ch√©roux, Cl√©ment. (2005). The Perfect Medium: Photography and the Occult. Yale University Press. p. 268. Skeptics have pointed out that the experiments were not conducted in fraud proof conditions and the moulds could have easily been produced by fraudulent techniques.Polidoro, Massimo. (2003). Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims. Prometheus Books. pp. 168-176. Geley has been described as an unreliable investigator. Physician Ant√¥nio da Silva Mello noted that Geley \\"published many writings on ectoplasms and teleplastic phenomena, things which today are quite out of date and totally discredited.\\"Mello, Ant√¥nio da Silva. (1960). Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. p. 291 Magicians have been able to easily replicate the \\"materialization\\" moulds.Lycett, Andrew. (2007). The Man Who Created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Free Press. p. 433. The magician Carlos Mar√≠a de Heredia revealed how fake materialization hands could be made by using a rubber glove, paraffin and a jar of cold water.Heredia, Carlos Mar√≠a De. (1923). Spirit Hands, \\"ectoplasm,\\" and Rubber Gloves. Popular Mechanics. pp. 14-15 Geley and Arthur Conan Doyle objected to the medium having used a rubber glove. In response, Harry Houdini demonstrated that a glove was not needed as he replicated the Kluski materialization moulds by using his hands and a bowl of hot paraffin.Polidoro, Massimo. (2001). Final S√©ance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle. Prometheus Books. pp. 71-73. \\"At the time Houdini didn't press the argument further, but later on, experimenting with paraffin, he found no artifice was needed to duplicate Kluski's moulds. As a series of pictures for a newspaper of the time shows, he immersed his hand in the hot paraffin, let it dry, and then carefully removed the hand from it. When one experiments with this technique, one realizes that it is not the plaster cast that has to be removed from the thin wax mould, which would be impossible to do without breaking the mould. One almost forgets that what has to be removed is the living hand, possibly the best-suited object to slip out of a mould without damaging it. In fact, a real hand is even more effective than any other artifice dreamed up to substitute for it. First, the paraffin doesn't stick to skin, only to quite long hair. Nonetheless, if one moves the fingers very slowly, one will realize that every small bit one pulls out will gradually allow the rest of the hand to be removed; that's similar to what happens when one pulls off a tight glove.\\" Harry Price wrote regarding Kluski \\"His mediumship is unsatisfactory from the point of view that no scientific body has investigated the alleged miracles. On each of my two visits to Warsaw I attempted to obtain sittings with Kluski, without results.\\"Price, Harry. (2003). Fifty Years of Psychical Research. Kessinger Publishing. Researchers have compared Kluski's mediumship to the medium Eva Carri√®re and have speculated that he introduced items in the s√©ance room by fraud.Franklyn, Julian. (2003). A Survey of the Occult. p. 381. Kessinger Publishing. A psychical researcher sent a letter to Hereward Carrington claiming Kluski had been detected in fraud.Carrington, Hereward. (1988). Letters to Hereward Carrington from Famous Psychical Researchers. Society of Metaphysicians. p. 89. Massimo Polidoro and Luigi Garlaschelli have produced wax-moulds directly from one's hand which were exactly the same copies as Geley obtained from Kluski, which are kept at the Institute Metapsychique International. Fraud incident In a notable incident during a s√©ance that Paul Heuze attended the medium was requested to produce a face impression. However, a large-sized buttocks impression was found in the wax.Mello, Ant√¥nio da Silva. (1960). Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next. Weidenfeld & Nicolson. p. 408 It was alleged by a s√©ance sitter that \\"Kluski dropped... his pants and placed his buttocks in the paraffin\\".Brower, M. Brady. (2010). Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France. University of Illinois Press. p. 171. Heuze believed the impression was Kluski's. This was later confirmed as it was discovered that Kluski had suffered from a burnt buttocks for many days after the incident. Confession Some later authors have written about an alleged confession from Kluski. In his book Sixty Years of Psychical Research (1950), magician Joseph Rinn claimed that Kluski had confessed to fraud.Rinn, Joseph. (1950). Sixty Years of Psychical Research: Houdini and I Among the Spiritualists. Truth Seeker Company. p. 441. \\"The medium Kluski produced a paraffin hand of a spirit for Dr. Geley, but when Dr. Geley wanted to bring him to the United States, Kluski confessed he was a fraud.\\" In 1978, researcher Melvin Harris also noted that Kluski had confessed to fraud.Harris, Melvin. (1978). Strange to Relate. Granada Publishing. p. 102. \\"Doyle was also duped by Kluski, a medium who produced wax moulds, said to be made by 'spirit hands'!

Biography Born in a small town in the old province of Oriente, Pe√±a studied with Marcos Gonz√°lez and Jos√© Santos Betancourt. In 1902 he moved to Havana, and founded the band La Juventud, with himself as director and cornet, Rogelio Solis (double bass), F√©lix Gonz√°lez (ophicleide), Jos√© Bel√©n Puig (first clarinet), Jos√© Urf√© (second clarinet), Jos√© de los Reyes (kettle drum) and Rufino C√°rdenas (g√ºiro). This band had several members who became well known; Puig went on to become a famous leader of his own charanga. The band functioned until 1906. His second band was called the Orquesta t√≠pica de Enrique Pe√±a. Its line-up was Pe√±a (cornet); Antonio Gonz√°lez (trombone); F√©liz Gonz√°lez (figle); Jos√© Bel√©n Puig (1st clarinet); Jos√© Urf√© (2nd clarinet); Juli√°n Barreto (violin); Alfredo S√°enz (violin); Jos√© de los Reyes (tympani); Rufino C√°rdenas (g√º√≠ro) and unknown (double bass). This orchestra became famous for being the first to play El bomb√≠n de Barreto (Barreto's bowler hat), written by Urf√©, which was supposedly the first danz√≥n to incorporate a syncopated third part, influenced by the son. The group recorded about 150 numbers,D√≠az Ayala, Crist√≥bal 1994. Cuba canta y baila: discograf√≠a de la m√∫sica cubana 1898‚Äì1925.

An ancestor to this iguana first dispersed to Hispaniola, then onwards to the north and western islands, which has since diversified on different islands into the 9 species and several additional subspecies of the genus Cyclura as we know it today. Taxonomy The Anegada ground iguana was first described by American Herpetologist Thomas Barbour 1917. Its specific name pinguis means \\"fat\\" and refers to the animal's stocky appearance and the common name \\"Stout iguana\\". Anatomy and morphology The Anegada ground iguana is a large heavy-bodied rock iguana which attains a total body length of close to . As juveniles they are faintly or boldly patterned with wide gray to moss green bands interspersed with wide gray to black anteriorly directed chevrons. These bands fade and are generally lost as the animals mature, turning a uniform grayish or brownish-black with varying amounts of turquoise on the dorsal spines, tail base, fore and hind legs. Occasionally this bluish coloration extends up onto the sides of the individual, particularly in males. Females tend to be relatively dull in color, exhibiting less brilliant blue if any. This species, like other species of Cyclura, is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have more prominent dorsal crests, \\"horns\\" and femoral pores on their thighs, which are used to release pheromones. Diet Like all Cyclura species the Anegada ground iguana is primarily herbivorous, consuming leaves, flowers and fruits from different plant species. However, due to direct competition with grazing livestock in its native habitat such as sheep, goats, burros, and cattle they have been reduced to eating vegetation rejected by these domestic and feral animals. This has also caused them to become opportunistic carnivores preying upon centipedes, millipedes, roaches, insects, and other invertebrates as opposed to being strict herbivores. Mating and habitat At the Houston Zoo This forced diet has affected the iguanas' ability to reproduce. As reproductive females are not being provided with enough nutrition to produce eggs and support their own metabolism; many do not survive after laying eggs, resulting in the present skewed sex ratio of 2 males to every female. Females usually lay one clutch of about 12-16 eggs per year in late spring or early summer. Anegada Island is rare in that it is not a volcanic island, but formed from coral and limestone providing many caves and natural burrows for the iguanas to live. Animals typically inhabit a single burrow and it was once observed that they appeared to bond for life, dwelling in burrows in close proximity to their mate. As the drive to find more females and compete for food has increased their range, this does not appear to be occurring any longer. Conservation=Endangered status= It is estimated that the current global population is less than 300 and is rapidly declining: the population has decreased by at least 80% over the last 40 years. =Causes of decline= In the brush The primary reason for the Anegeda ground iguana's decline is competitive grazing with domestic and feral livestock. The secondary reason is that they are preyed upon by feral dogs and cats. As with other Rock Iguanas, their habitat is also in rapid decline due to development and logging. Live Anegada iguanas used to regularly be sold to tourists as pets, as their rarity made them more appealing to exotic animal collectors, despite this being illegal under the CITES treaty. In 1999 a World Wildlife Fund international conservation officer, Stuart Chapman, said: \\"The British government has turned a blind eye for over 20 years to these overseas territories which are home to many rare and endangered species. Many of these face extinction if Britain fails to honour its treaty obligations. The British Caribbean islands are extremely rich in biodiversity with many critically endangered species that are unique to the islands - yet there is virtually zero enforcement or implementation of CITES.\\" =Recovery efforts= Intense conservation efforts are underway to protect this species. In the 1980s, eight iguanas were moved from Anegada to Guana Island, British Virgin Islands, to start a second population in part of the species' former range. Guana Island is not a limestone island, and does not provide as many natural retreats as Anegada does. The iguanas appear to be doing well and reproducing in areas free of feral sheep, which is its only competitor for vegetation. Approximately 20 adult iguanas are estimated to inhabit Guana and offspring have been seen each year since 1987. Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep, which may improve the habitat for iguanas. The Anegada ground iguana has also been successfully bred in captivity at the San Diego Zoo and the Fort Worth Zoo. Both zoos have actively been working with the British Virgin Islands on a joint-recovery program started in 1997 on Anegeda Island. 120 iguanas have been raised at the facility for release into the wild. Hatchlings are fed and protected so they can be \\"headstarted\\" for the wild and not fall prey to feral dogs and cats. This offsets the juvenile mortality rate and is accompanied by field research, nestsite protection, and monitoring of released animals.

It is native to the Ouachitas of west-central Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma in the central United States, where it is found growing in habitats such as rocky ridges, bluffs, hillsides, weathered sandstone, and open woods. It blooms in June to September and may start blooming as early as May, it has purple flowers grouped into heads. It was known as a variety of Liatris squarrosa as Liatris squarrosa var. compacta until relatively recently. Description Liatris compacta grows from rounded corms, that produce hairless stems 22 to 50 centimeters (8.8-20.0 inches) tall. The flowers are in heads with 18-25 flowers per head, the heads are produced singularly or in clusters of 2 to 5 heads. The heads have large leaf-like bracts under them; the stems attaching the heads to the main stem are 3 to 25 millimeters (0.12-1.00 inch) long. The heads are arranged in loose spike-like or raceme-like collections. The basal and early cauline leaves have 3 to 5 nerves and are elliptic-lanceolate in shape; the basal foliage often withers before flowering. The foliage is hairless and may have faint glandular dots; the leaves are gradually reduced in size as they ascend near the tops of the stems. The seed are produced in cypselae fruits that are 5.5 to 8 millimeters long with feathery bristles. Taxonomy Liatris compacta appears closely related to Liatris squarrosa and has been grouped within that species in the past. It has differences in morphology and a distinctive range, it also grows in different habitats. It, along with Liatris squarrosa, Liatris hirsuta, and Liatris cylindracea are interrelated and similar in appearance; all four species having a tendency for cylindric involucres and have corolla lobes with dense hirsute hairs.

It was approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on January 21, 2009 making it Washington's 10th federally designated AVA. It is the second smallest AVA in the state, after the Red Mountain AVA, and has one of the state's longest viticultural histories. The appellation is a sub-AVA of the Yakima Valley AVA and the Columbia Valley AVA. It is located above and between the towns of Sunnyside and Granger around Outlook, Washington, in the southeast corner of the Yakima Valley.  Geography  The viticultural area is located on Snipes Mountain, a seven mile (11 km) long anticline ridge, including a peak high, that rises from the floor of the Yakima Valley with comparatively unique, rocky soils, called aridisols. The viticultural area also includes Harrison Hill, which lies contiguously east of Snipes Mountain and has similar soil and topography. The Snipes Mountain AVA, like much of Eastern Washington, is located in the rain shadow of the Cascade Mountains which contributes to the warm and dry climate of the region. Soil deposits below the area are composed of gravels and settlements left by ancient river beds that the Columbia River once followed. These deposits range in size from that of a human fist to large melons. The mountain itself was created by fault activity.  History  Snipes Mountain, itself, was named for Ben Snipes, an early Yakima County pioneer who built a house at the base of a mountain in the 1850s and developed an expansive cattle operation. The petition to create the Snipes Mountain AVA was filed by Upland Vineyards, which was first planted in 1917 by Washington State wine pioneer William B. Bridgman. The vineyard on Snipes Mountain was one of the first to plant the European Vitis vinifera varieties of Semillon and Pinot noir in Washington.

Besides having a very large library of songs across all music genres, the NoteStation was able to print the sheet music on demand in any key, as selected by the customer. This reduced the need for retailers to carry a large selection of physical inventory, which was usually only printed in one key. Early in the MusicWriter's history Warner Bros. Music and Thorn EMI, the two largest music publishers in the world, invested in the company and became board members. The company then was able to sign most of the major music publishers to offer their titles through the system. MusicWriter was among the first applications of the new distribution paradigm of \\"Mass Customization\\" or \\"Point-of-Sale Manufacturing\\", where a retailer is able to offer a very large selection of a product, with virtually no inventory, and manufacture the customized product on the spot for a customer. This trend was documented in B. Joseph Pine II‚Äôs 1993 book, Mass Customization, The New Frontier in Business Competition published by Harvard Business School Press. The company expanded its features to include producing MIDI files on demand and online ordering of music products from distributors. The company was featured on CNN TV and written about in Fortune Magazine, Business Week, USA Today, San Francisco Examiner, San Jose Mercury News, and Popular Science. Due to the major print music companies that fought against the technologies, in 1999 MusicWriter went bankrupt as online technology emerged and the decline of sheet music retailers made the in-store technology obsolete.

His work shows a sensitive understanding of his subject matter, and part of his success in capturing the peaceful country atmosphere depicted in so many of his paintings lay in his affection for it. He was greatly influenced by one of the foremost animal painters of the nineteenth century, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer.

She has appeared in many television variety shows and in erotic comedies. She has hosted several programmes for Mediaset's Canale 5, including Scherzi a Parte and La sai l'ultima?. She is also credited as Pamela Field in some of her pictures.  Career  Little is known about Prati early life. She maintains that she was born from a Spanish flamenco dancer that later abandoned her Italian mother in Ozieri in the province of Sassari, northern Sardinia; however the Italian tabloid Chi has alleged that her father was in fact an Italian womanizer known as \\"Piscittu Murtu\\" (dead fish). She moved to Rome in her late teens where she worked as a model and made a brief appearance on television in the variety show La Sberla in 1976. Prati attracted much publicity when she appeared on the cover of singer Adriano Celentano's album Un po' artista un po' no in 1980. That same year she debuted in her first film, La moglie in bianco... L'amante al pepe, an erotic comedy in which she had the starring role.Pamela Prati at the Internet Movie Database This was followed by other films, and in the meanwhile Prati began to study dance, singing and diction. She soon joined the Bagaglino Company, which was directed by Pier Francesco Pingitore and produced variety shows; Prati began making regular appearances on television as a showgirl and hostess, while she continued to act in films and television fiction. She has also performed on stage in theatrical productions. Prati participated in three beauty contests in 1983, which included Mora pi√π bella d'Italia, Miss Sardinia and Miss Universe. In 1996, she released an album entitled Il tango delle 11.

It is significant for being the destination of the celebrated annual Rath Yatra of Puri. While it remains vacant most of the year, the temple is occupied by images of the deities of Jagannath, his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra for seven complete days (total 9 days including the start and concluding day of Ratha Yatra) every year during the annual Rath Yatra festival. Temple Known as the Garden House of Jagannath, the Gundicha temple stands in the centre of a beautiful garden, surrounded by compound walls on all sides. It lies at a distance of about from the Shrimandira, the main temple of Jagannath. The two temples are located at the two ends of the Bada Danda (Grand Avenue) which is the pathway for the Rath Yatra. The temple is built using light-grey sandstone and architecturally, it exemplifies typical Kalinga temple architecture in the Deula style. The complex comprises four components: vimana (tower structure containing the sanctum), jagamohana (assembly hall), nata-mandapa (festival hall) and bhoga-mandapa (hall of offerings). There is also a kitchen connected by a small passage. The temple is set within a garden, and is known as \\"God's Summer Garden Retreat\\" or garden house of Jagannath. The entire complex, including garden, is surrounded by a wall. The sanctum features a plain raised platform ( high and long) made of chlorite called Ratnavedi, where the deities are placed during the annual festivities. The temple has two gates. The western gate is the main temple gate, through which the deities enter the temple during Ratha Yatra. The eastern gate, known as Nakachana gate, is used for the departure of the deities. Except for the 9-day Rath Yatra when Jagannath is worshipped in Gundicha temple, the temple remains empty the rest of the year. Tourists can visit the temple after paying an entry fee. Foreigners (prohibited entry in the main temple) are allowed inside this temple during this period. The temple is under the Jagannath Temple Administration, Puri - the governing body of the main temple. A small band of servitors maintain the temple. The Rath Yatra The Rath Yatra starts on the second lunar day (dwitiya) the bright fortnight (shukla paksha) of the Hindu month of Ashadha. One day before the Ratha Yatra, the Gundicha Temple is religiously cleansed for housing the gods. On the first day of the yatra, the deities are transported in chariots from the main temple to Gundicha temple. This is the famous Rath Yatra or Chariot Festival of Jagannath Puri. The three deities are transported in three magnificent chariots, drawn by the numerous devotees gathered there. The three chariots involved in the chariot procession are: one for each deity with central chariot called the Nandighosha, carrying the main deity of Jagannath and the second chariot known as Taladhwaja carrying Balabhadra, and the third chariot called the Darpadalana carrying Subhadra. The procession progresses down the 3 km long \\"Bada Danda\\" (long avenue) and reaches the gates of the Gundicha temple before nightfall. The deities remain in the chariots on the first day and enter the Gundicha Temple on the second day. They reside at the Gundicha temple for the subsequent seven days.details of the temple Ratha Yatra rituals ;Worship A particular feature in the worship of the deities at Gundicha Temple is that Brahmin temple servants offer the puja instead of daitas, the traditional non-Brahmin servitors of Jagannath who are excluded from worship. Though devadasis generally function as agents of Lakshmi, they offer worship in the Gundicha Temple in the same manner as in the main temple, while Lakshmi is left behind in a storeroom in the main temple. This connotes a different context to the role of the devadasis in the Gundicha Temple. Another unusual feature is that the images are smeared with larger quantities of sandalwood paste, twice a day, as a \\"cooling agent\\" (as is commonly done to the goddess Gundicha). Every day of their stay in the temple, the deities are decorated with new dresses. ;Hera Panchami Gundicha Devi, the main deity of the temple. Nandighosha, the Chariot of Jagannath leaves the main temple. main gate of gundicha A major ceremony celebrated in the Gundicha Temple during the Rath Yatra is on the Panchami (5th day of the Ratha Yatra) known as Hera Panchami (Hera means \\"to see'). This ceremony is attended by a very large number of devotees, who visit the Ratha Yatra Festival. While Jagannath visits Gundicha temple, his wife Lakshmi is left behind in the main temple of Puri. On Hera Panchami, the furious goddess Lakshmi arrives, in the form of the image of Subarna Mahalakshmi, at the Gundicha Temple. She is formally carried in a palanquin with much fan fare and welcomed and worshipped by the priests of Gundicha Temple, who take her to the sanctum to meet Jagannath. The husband and wife seat face-to-face on the porch in the sanctum of the Gundicha Temple; on this occasion devotees flock to the temple to have the darshan (see the holy images). Lakshmi requests him to return home and Jagannath gives his consent by offering her agyan mala (a garland of consent), which the goddess accepts and takes with her while return to the main temple in the evening. Before returning to the temple, to vent her anger at being left out of the vacation, Lakshmi orders one of her attendants to damage a part of Jagannath's chariot, the Nandighosha. This ritual is known as the Ratha Bhanga (the breaking of the chariot). This is followed by her hiding behind a tamarind tree outside the Gundicha Temple. After some time, she escapes to her home temple in secrecy, through a separate path way known as Hera Gohri Lane, as she fears the repercussions of her angry act. ;Dakshina Moda The ceremony of Dakshina Moda (turning south) is observed on the day after Hera Panchami, that is, the sixth day of the Rath Yatra. The chariots of the deities are parked outside the temple, facing the main temple gate (western gate). In preparation for the return journey, the Bahuda Yatra, the chariots are turned to face towards the main temple in the southern direction and are parked near the Nakachana gate (eastern gate) of the Gundicha Temple through which the deities leave the temple. It is said the demon-king of Lanka, Vibhishana got darshan of Jagannath from far away Lanka on this day. Devotees believe one can attain salvation by witnessing this ceremony. ;Rasa Lila Dakshina Moda, marks the beginning of the three-day Rasa Lila of Jagannath. Rasa lila is described in Hindu texts like the Bhagavata Purana and Gita Govinda as a night in Vrindavan when Krishna danced with his gopi-consort Radha and other gopis. The image of Jagannath is taken to the Rasa mandapa (a temple hall) of the Gundicha Temple where hymns from the Gita Govinda are sung for the last 3 days of his stay in the temple. During the Rasa Lila, the interaction between Jagannath-Krishna and the gopis is enacted through the Gita Govinda verses. In the olden days, Devadasis sang the verses, which are now sung by the temple servitors. Vaishnavas thus consider Gundicha Temple as Vrindavan during Jagannath's stay there. ;Sandhya Darshan and Mahaprasad As per tradition, during Jagannath's stay in Gundicha temple, the kitchens of the main temple stop preparing Mahaprasad (food offered to deity and given to a devotee as the deity's blessing). The Mahaprasad consists of rice, dal, vegetables etc. The kitchens of the Gundicha temple are repaired and food is cooked there to offer to Jagannath. The day of Sandhya Darshan, (evening prayers) the second last day of the festival, is considered the most important day to have darshan of Jagannath. On this day, as thousands of devotees throng the temple to have darshan of Jagannath and partake of Mahaprasad. ;Bahuda Yatra The Nakachana Gate of the Gundicha Temple The return journey of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra to the main temple, after spending seven days in the Gundicha temple, is known as the Bahuda Yatra. The images of the deities are brought out of the Gundicha temple through the Nakachana Gate during the Pahandi ceremony, to the accompaniment of the beats of cymbals and gongs and the sound of conches being blown. Odissi and Gotipua dancers serenade to the tune of music in front of the chariots, and martial artists perform banati, a traditional martial art in front of the deities. The deities are taken in the same chariots in which they arrive, pulled by devotees back to the main temple. It is considered auspicious to get a glimpse of the deities on their chariots. Legends The Main Gate of the Gundicha Temple There are many legends linked to the temple and the annual seven-day stay of the central icons of Jagannath and his siblings during the Ratha Yatra. A legend links the temple to Gundicha, the queen of Indradyumna (the legendary builder of the main temple) - after whom the Gundicha Temple is named. Gundicha had a peep at the divine image of Jagannath being created by the celestial architect Vishwakarma. Impressed by the image, she insisted on her husband building the temple for the deity and starting the Ratha Yatra. Another variant suggests that Jagannath was pleased with her temple and promised to visit her house, now the Gundicha Temple.Shree Kshestra As per another legend, when Jagannath (identified with the god Krishna) goes to stay for seven days in the Gundicha Temple, he intentionally leaves behind his consort Lakshmi locked up in a store room in the main Jagannath temple. While in the Gundicha temple, he is exclusively taken care by his gopis (cow-herding girls) led by his gopi-lover Radha like Krishna in Vrindavan. The gopis are symbolized by the temple devadasis on this occasion. When Jagannatha returns to his main temple after his amorous dalliance, Lakshmi meets him at the main temple gate and sprinkles some magical powder on him, which makes him forget about his escapade in the Gundicha Temple, and she is immediately reunited with her husband in blissful love. One more legend relates the temple's name Gundicha to a local goddess Gundicha, akin to Durga, worshipped to cure smallpox. Gundi in Oriya means smallpox, Gundicha is considered Krishna-Jagannath's aunt, which he visits with his siblings annually. Another legend is about the mysterious disappearance of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (an incarnation of Krishna according to the Bhavishya Purana). He established Gaudiya Vaishnavism and also known to have composed the Jagannath Astakam. He lived in Puri for many years and sang bhajans (devotional songs) and led sankirtan processions in front of Jagannath during his Chandan Yatra and Ratha Yatra, along with many devotees. It is also said that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu used to go into a rapturous mood watching the god's love play and dance with joy and also fainted many times due to emotion. Daily, he prayed to Jagannath, standing behind the garudastamba (Pillar of Garuda) with tears flowing down his eyes. With permission of the king, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu once undertook the task of cleaning the Gundicha temple premises a day before the Ratha yatra (this tradition is followed even to this day by the followers of the Gaudiya Vaishnavism). It is mentioned that once Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, unnoticed by his attendants, walked towards the Gundicha Temple and was last seen entering the Manikotha, thereafter he was never seen again. This disappearance has remained an unexplained mystery as none of the books written on him have recorded this event. It is believed that he merged with Jagannath at the temple.

Later, decorations of the margins of pages, displaying a variety of graphic techniques, were added in order to beautify the book. In the 12th century, the Naskh alphabet was invented; it featured curves instead of the angled lines of Kufi script.

However, these early references appears to refer to domino cards. See Early references to Playing Cards Chinese playing cards, as we understand the term today, date from at least 1294, when Yen Sengzhu and Zheng Pig-Dog were apparently caught gambling in Enzhou (in modern Shandong Province).John Berry, Introduction to the Exhibition 'The World of Playing Cards' at the Guildhall Library, London, from September 1995 to March 1996 Cards entered Europe from the Islamic empire.Kathleen Wowk, Playing Cards of the World, Lutterworth Press (January 1, 1983), The earliest authentic references to playing cards in Europe date from 1377.Catherine Perry Hargrave, A History of Playing Cards and a Bibliography of Cards and Gaming, Dover Publications; Unabridged edition (January 11, 2001), Europe changed the Islamic symbols such as scimitars and cups into graphical representations of kings, queens, knights and jesters.

Lower production costs enabled the printed playing cards' quick exportation throughout Europe. The substitution of wood-block printing and hand coloring with copper-plate engraving during the 16th century was the next significant innovation in the manufacture of playing cards. The mass printing of playing cards was revolutionized by the introduction of color lithography in the early 19th century.

This kind of sign is called pictogramLarousseŸÑÿßÿ±Ÿàÿ≥ The main advantage of a pictogram is that one does not need to be able to read or to understand a particular language in order to be able to understand the information it conveys.According to Greek mythology, Asclepius was said to have learned the art of healing from the centaur Chiron. He is customarily represented as a surgeon on the ship Argo. Asclepius was so skilled in the medical arts that he was reputed to have brought patients back from the dead. For this, he was punished and placed in the heavens as the constellation Ophiuchus (meaning \\"serpent-bearer\\").

Glaser created this rebus-style icon which became a major success and has continued to be sold for years. Rebus has played an important role in creation of alphabets. =Heraldry= Heraldry is the practice of designing and displaying coat of arms and heraldic badge and is rather common among all nations. For example, Romans used eagle as their coat of arms, French used fleur de lis, and Persians used the sign of their god, Ahura Mazda. Historically, it has been variously described as \\"the shorthand of history\\"Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, (Thomas Nelson, 1925). and \\"the floral border in the garden of history.\\".Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk & Pottinger, Simple Heraldry (Thomas Nelson, 1953).

The actual symbolism behind the rose has religious connotations as it represents the Virgin Mary, who was often called the Mystical Rose of Heaven. =Logos and trademarks= A trademark is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, company or other entity to identify its products or services and to distinguish them from those of other producers. A trademark is a type of intellectual property, and typically a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements.The Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.

Information signs: ISOTYPE In 1921, Otto Neurath, an Austrian social scientist, introduced graphic design in order to facilitate the understanding of various social and economic trends through the creative use of statistical charts. In 1924, Neurath advocated the establishment of the Museum of Economy and Society, an institution for public education and social information. In May 1925, the Museum's first graphical displays was opened to the public. The exhibition showed various complicated social and economic trends. By using charts which were to be intuitive and interesting the attempt was to make those concepts easy to grasp. This style of presentation at the time was called the Viennese method, but now it is known as ISOTYPE charts (International System of Typographic Picture Education). Otto Neurath (1882‚Äì1945) was an enthusiast of sociology. After obtaining his PhD he worked on planning the war economy of the Austro- Hungarian empire. However, by 1919 he was engaged in the planning for a wholly new economic system of the chaotic and short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic. He proposed for the abolition of money, but before this could be implemented, the republic was bloodily overthrown by Weimar's Social Democrats. Neurath escaped to Vienna, where he became an activist for the self-help squatters' movement. In the 1920s he joined the Vienna Circle of Logical Positivists, who attempted to establish a scientific foundation for philosophy; and at the same time he pioneered the graphic methods that became Isotype and were shown in the \\"Museum of Society and Economy\\". He fled Vienna after the collapse of its social democratic city government in 1934. Neurath's final years were spent in Britain, as postwar planner for the Midlands town of Bilston.Nader Vossoughian, Otto Neurath: The Language of the Global Polis, NAi Publishers (July 1, 2008) As Lupton argues: Neurath suggested \\"two central rules for generating the vocabulary of international pictures: reduction, for determining the style of individual signs; and consistency, for giving a group of signs the appearance of a coherent system\\". Reduction means finding the simplest expression of an object. For instance, silouette is a basic technique for reduction. It emulates the shadow of the image without any human intervention. Thus, it is a natural cast rather than a cultural interpretation. The sign as geometric representation of reality is both a rhetorical connotation and a practical technique for many symbol designers. Martin Krampen suggested \\"simplified realism;\\" he urged designers to \\"start from silhouette photographs of objects...and then by subtraction...obtain silouette pictographs.\\"Ellen Lupton, Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students (Design Briefs), Princeton Architectural Press; 1 edition (September 9, 2004), Gerd Arntz (1900‚Äì1988) was born in a German family of traders and manufacturers. He was a socio- political activist in D√ºsseldorf, where he joined a movement that aimed to turn Germany into a radical-socialist state form. As a revolutionary artist, Arntz was connected to the Cologne-based ‚Äòprogressive artists group‚Äô (Gruppe progressiver K√ºnstler K√∂ln) and depicted the life of workers and the class struggle in abstracted figures on woodcuts. Published in leftist magazines, his work was noticed by Otto Neurath who for his ‚ÄòVienna method of visual statistics‚Äô needed a designer of pictograms that could summarize a subject at a glance. Neurath invited the young artists to come to Vienna in 1928, and work on further developing his ISOTYPE. Arntz designed around 4000 different pictograms and abstracted illustrations for this system. Neurath's motto was ‚Äòwords divide, images unite‚Äô. Many of his designs together with those of his prot√©g√© Gerd Arntz were the forebears of pictograms we now encounter everywhere, such as the man and woman on toilet doors. As Marina Vishmidt suggests: \\"Neurath's pictograms owe much to the Modernist belief that reality may be modified by being codified ‚Äì standardised, easy-to-grasp templates as a revolution in human affairs.Marina Vishmidt The Dutch Are Weeping in Four Universal Pictorial Languages At Least = Olympic pictograms = The logos and pictograms for Olympic Games change every four years and the sponsoring city develops its own logos. Pictograms first appeared at the Olympics in London in 1948. They came into wide use, since they simultaneously communicate a message to a large number of people who speak different languages. In the absence of such signs in venues such as Olympic village there would be a need for many written signs in different languages, for example for rowing such as; Roningÿå ŒöœâœÄŒ∑ŒªŒ±œÉŒØŒ±ÿå Aviron, ŸÇÿß€åŸÇ ÿ±ÿßŸÜ€åÿå and „Éú„Éº„ÉàÁ´∂ÊäÄ which not only would be costly but also may confuse the viewers.

Pioneers of modern graphics and industrial design Image:Allgemeine Elektricit√§ts-Gesellschaft (logo).svgIn 1907, AEG (Allgemeine Elektricit√§ts-Gesellschaft) retained Peter Behrens, a German architect and designer, as artistic consultant. He designed the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) and for that he is considered the first industrial designer in history. He never became an employee of AEG, but worked as an artistic consultant.Stanford Anderson: \\"Peter Behrens and a New Architecture for the Twentieth Century\\", page 252. The MIT Press 2000.

Raymond Loewy was one of the best known industrial designers of the 20th century. Born in France, he spent most of his professional career in the United States. Among his many contributions were the Shell logo, the Greyhound bus, the S-1 locomotive, the Lucky Strike package, Coldspot refrigerators and the Studebaker Avanti. Loewy was first approached by the greyhound corporation to redesign its logo. The company's logo looked like a 'fat mongrel' he said. So, he created a slimmed-down version that is still used today.Setright, L.J.K., \\"Loewy: When styling became industrial design\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 11 William Golden is one of the pioneers of American graphic design. He was born in lower Manhattan, the youngest of twelve children. His only formal schooling was at the Vocational School for Boys, where he learned photoengraving and the basics of commercial design. In conjunction with the Didot typeface, Golden developed the famous CBS Eye logo. It has been suggested that the eye was inspired by an article in Alexey Brodovitch's Portfolio about the subject of Shaker design.Golden, Cipe Pineles, Kurt Weihs, and Robert Strunsky, eds. The visual craft of William Golden. New York: George Braziller, Inc., 1962. Remington, R. Roger, and Barbara J. Hodik. Nine Pioneers in American Graphic Design. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, 1989. . Placards and posters Placard and posters existed from the ancient times. The Persian reliefs that depicted the important historical events; and the Greek axons and the Roman Albums, with their decorative designs and announcements, were quite similar to today's posters. In ancient Greece the name of athletes, and games schedules were written on columns that were slowly turning on an axis. Romans used whitewashed walls in their markets in which sellers, money lenders, and slave traders wrote their announcements and advertised for their products, and to attract the attention of customers they added attractive designs to their announcements. =Ancient reliefsEmergence of the print and design industry= Around 1450, Johann Gutenberg's printing press made books widely available in Europe. The book design of Aldus Manutius developed the book structure which would become the foundation of western publication design. With the development of the lithographic process, invented by a Czech named Alois Senefelder in 1798 in Austria, the creation of posters become feasible. Although handmade posters existed before, they were mainly used for government announcements. William Caxton, who in 1477 started a printing company in England, produced the first printed poster.Encarta: \\"William Caxton\\". Archived 2009-10-31. In 1870, the advertising poster emerged.In the 19th and 20th centuries artists like Jules Ch√©ret, Daumier, Manet, Picasso, Ben Shahn, Norman Rockwell, Alexandre Steinlen, Alphonse Mucha, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec made compelling posters advertising products entertainments and restaurants. Matt Morgan's circus advertisements (c. 1890) started the American poster, and this was followed by Edward Penfield, Will H. Bradley, Maxfield Parrish, Howard Chandler Christie, James Montgomery Flagg, Charles Dana Gibson, and Harrison Fisher.M. Rickards, The Rise and Fall of the Poster (1971); J.

Engraving Engraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface, by cutting grooves into it. The process was developed in Germany in the 1430s from the engraving used by goldsmiths to decorate metalwork. Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a burin to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate. Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. Image:Theodor de Bry.pngTheodor de Bry (1528 ‚Äì 1598) was an engraver, goldsmith and editor.

Etching Etching is the process of using strong acid or mordant to cut into the unprotected parts of a metal surface to create a design in intaglio in the metal. This technique is believed to have been invented by Daniel Hopfer (c. 1470-1536) of Augsburg, Germany, who decorated armour in this way, and applied the method to printmaking. Etching soon came to challenge engraving as the most popular printmaking medium. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving which requires special skill in metalworking, etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.

Modern graphic design In the second half of the 19th century William Morris's Kelmscott Press produced many historicist graphic designs, and created a collectors market for this kind of art. In Oxford he associated with artists like Burne- Jones, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Together they formed the Pre-Raphaelites group, and their ideas influenced the modern graphic design considerably.Encarta \\"William Morris. Archived 2009-10-31.Larousse \\"Morris\\". Image:Morris Peacock and Dragon Fabric 1878 v2.jpgThis fabric design called Peacock and Dragon, which is the work of William Morris (1878) is an example of decorative graphic design. Such designs was revived during the 1960s with the emergence of the hippie movement. Image:Morris Tulip and Willow design 1873.jpgThis Morris Tulip and Willow design (1873) is another example of decorative graphics. By using a diagonal blue, with only some suggestion of orange the artist tries to create a harmonious color scheme that could be used effectively in the design of a poster or other graphic design media. Image:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpgThis is the first page of The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin which was published by Kelmscott Press of William Morris. The decorative design was the revival of the Gothic style in graphic design. Image:Rubaiyat Morris Burne-Jones Manuscript.jpgThis book of poetry, called Rubaiyat, by the famous Persian poet Omar Khayyam, is an example of early modern graphic design cooperation. The graphic composition of calligraphy and its decorative design are by Morris and the painting is by Burne-Jones. In 1917, Frederick H. Meyer, director and instructor at the California School of Arts and Crafts, taught a class entitled ‚ÄúGraphic Design and Lettering‚Äù. Posters Post-World War II After the Second World War, with the emergence new color printing technology and particularly appearance of computers the art of posters underwent a new revolutionary phase. People can create color poster on their laptop computers and create color prints at a very low cost. Unfortunately, the high cost sophisticated printing processes can only be afforded mostly by the government entities and large corporations. With the emergence of internet the role of posters in conveying information has greatly diminished. However, some artist still use the chromolithography in order to create works of arts in the form of print. In this regard the difference between painting and print has been narrowed considerably. =Psychedelic design= The word \\"psychedelic\\" means \\"mind manifesting\\". Psychedelic art is art inspired by the psychedelic experience induced by drugs, and refers above all to the art movement of the 1960s counterculture. Psychedelic visual arts were a counterpart to psychedelic rock music. Concert posters, album covers, lightshows, murals, comic books, underground newspapers and more reflected revolutionary political, social and spiritual sentiments inspired by psychedelic states of consciousness.Masters, Robert E.L. and Houston, Jean Psychedelic Art New York: 1968 A Balance House book‚Äîprinted by Grove Press, Inc. Although San Francisco remained the hub of psychedelic art into the early 1970s, the style also developed internationally. Pink Floyd worked extensively with London-based designers, Hipgnosis to create graphics to support the concepts in their albums like this cover of Soundtrack from the Film 'More'. Life magazine's cover and lead article for the September 1, 1967 issue at the height of the Summer of Love focused on the explosion of psychedelic art on posters and the artists as leaders in the hippie counterculture community. Yellow Submarine was a milestone in graphic design, inspired by the new trends in art, it sits alongside the dazzling Pop Art styles of Andy Warhol, Martin Sharp, Alan Aldridge and Peter Blake. Heinz Edelman was hired by TVC as the art director for this film. Before making Yellow Submarine, TVC had produced The Beatles, a 39 episode TV series \\"produced\\" by Al Brodax and King Features. Despite the critical acclaim of his design work for the film, Edelman never worked on another animated feature.Robert R. Hieronimus and Laura Cortner, Inside the Yellow Submarine; The Making of the Beatles' Animated Classic, kp books, February 01, 2002, Peter Max's art work was a part of the psychedelic movement in graphic design. His work was much imitated in commercial illustration in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1970, many of Max's products and posters were featured in the exhibition \\"The World of Peter Max\\" which opened at the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco. He appeared on the cover of Life magazine with an eight-page feature article as well as The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Ed Sullivan Show. =Poster design in Japan= The distinctive aesthetics of Japanese graphic design have been admired over many decades, winning awards at prestigious international venues. The works of Japanese graphic designers are noted for their resourcefulness, powerful visual expression and extraordinary technical quality of print.Richard S. Thornton, \\"Japanese Posters: The First 100 Years\\", Design Issues, Vol. 6, No. 1, Design in Asia and Australia (Autumn, 1989), pp. 4-14, Published by: The MIT Press The distinctive artistic language and typographic sophistication show particularly in Japanese poster-design. The Japanese poster is a compelling pictorial medium and an original work of art, reflecting in full the designer's creative talent. =Chinese cultural revolution= The poster \\"Revolution promotes production\\", created by He Shuxui, celebrates traditional ceramic painting techniques. A plaque in the background commemorates a group of ceramic workers as an outstanding productive unit, 1974. A worker named Wang Qing Cang created the poster \\"The three countries of Indo Zhina (Lao, Cambodia, Vietnam) will win!\\". On the upper left side, it says \\"Enemies are getting sicker and sicker every day, and we are getting better and better every day.\\" (The U.S. supported Indo Zhina (Indochina) governments while China supported their communist guerilla forces.) October 1964. The poster \\"Mao Ze Dong at Jing Gang Mountain\\" depicts a young Mao Ze Dong sitting against a background of Mount Jing Gang. Jing Gang Shan (Jing Gang Mountain) symbolizes the Mao Ze Dong leadership and his vision to unite the oppressed masses to fight against and fight against the ruling class. Created by Liu Chun Hua and Wang Hui, October 1969. The poster, \\"Time is Money\\", features the famous Canadian doctor Norman Bethune (Dr. Bai Qiuen in Chinese), racing to rescue another patient. Bethune became an early proponent of universal health care, the success of which he observed during a visit to the Soviet Union. As a doctor in Montreal, Bethune frequently sought out the poor and gave them free medical care. As a thoracic surgeon, he traveled to Spain (1936‚Äì1937) and to China (1938‚Äì1939) to perform battlefield surgical operations on war casualties. Created by Zhang Xin Gua. Hebei People's Publishing House. =Culture and politics= Richard Avedon was an American photographer. Avedon capitalized on his early success in fashion photography and expanded into the realm of fine art. This is a solarised poster portraits of the Beatles, originally produced for 9 January 1967 edition of the American magazine Look. The Barack Obama \\"hope\\" poster is an iconic image of Barack Obama designed by artist Shepard Fairey. The image became one of the most widely recognized symbols of Obama's campaign message, spawning many variations and imitations, including some commissioned by the Obama campaign. In January 2009, after Obama had won the election, Fairey's mixed-media stenciled portrait version of the image was acquired by the Smithsonian Institution for its National Portrait Gallery. Image:Poster loveulster.gifThis political poster by Tiocfaidh √År L√° about Ulster. Image:PavlovskiyMAYAKOVSKIY.jpgAndrew Pavlovsky poster of Poet MAYAKOVSKIY (2003). This poster is a graphic illustration of a true interest to Constructivism in Russia today. This Art Movement (Constructivism) was almost always in demand in Russia and it can become one of principal trends now. Some of the contemporary Russian artists and art historians have already suggested the new term - Additive Constructivism. It emphasizes the return to modernism, which starts to significantly push out the postmodern art practices. It's not a postmodern performance. The Constructivist color solution proves that so it is. do =Computer aided graphic design in posters= With the arrival of computer aided graphic design an assortment of novel effects, digital techniques, and innovative styles have been emerged in poster designs. With software such as Adobe Photoshop, Corel and Windows' Paint program, image editing has become very cheap, and artists can experiment easily with a variety of color schemes, filters and special effects. For instance, utilizing various filters of Photoshop, many artists have created \\"vectored\\" designs in posters where a photographic image is solarized, sharpened, rendered into watercolor or stained glass effects or converted into bare lines with block colors. Other designs created soft or blurry styles, ripple or cascade effects and other special filters. Advertising Graphic design is used in advertising to announce a persuasive message by an identified sponsor; or a promotion by a firm of its products to its existing and potential customers. Egyptians used papyrus to make sales messages and wall posters. Commercial messages and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of Pompeii and ancient Arabia. Lost and found advertising on papyrus was common in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America.Johnson, J.

German Plakatstil, \\"Poster style\\" In the early 20th century, Germany became the cradle of many of the avant-garde art movements particularly for posters. This created the \\"Plakatstil\\" or \\"Poster style\\" movement. This movement became very influential and had a considerable impact on the graphic design for posters. Posters in this style would feature few but strong colours, a sharp, non- cluttered, minimal composition and bold, clear types.Lucian Bernhard - Werbung und Design im Aufbruch des 20.

He was trained and practiced as an architect until 1906 when he switched to poster design. Hohlwein's adaptations of photographic images was based on a deep and intuitive understanding of graphical principles. His creative use of color and architectural compositions dispels any suggestion that he uses photos as a substitute for creative design. for Riquet Pralinen Tea c. 1920‚Äì1926. Hohlwein was born in the Rhine-Main region of Germany, though he and his work are associated with Munich and Bavaria in southern Germany. There were two schools of Gebrauchsgrafik in Germany at the time, North and South. Hohlwein's high tonal contrasts and a network of interlocking shapes made his work instantly recognizable. Poster historian Alain Weill comments that \\"Hohlwein was the most prolific and brilliant German posterist of the 20th century... Beginning with his first efforts, Hohlwein found his style with disconcerting facility. It would vary little for the next forty years. The drawing was perfect from the start, nothing seemed alien to him, and in any case, nothing posed a problem for him. His figures are full of touches of color and a play of light and shade that brings them out of their background and gives them substance\\"Weill, Alain, The Poster a Worldwide Survey and History, G K Hall, 1985, =Lucian Bernhard= Over the course of his career, which lasted well into the 1950s, Lucian Bernhard became a prolific designer not only of innovative posters but of trademarks, packaging, type, textiles, furniture, and interior design. =Advertising in the 1920-30 era= Image:Pierce-ArrowColorAd.jpgPierce-Arrow auto ad, from advertisement in Life magazine, 1919 Image:Brightest London and Home By Underground.jpgThe London Underground Electric Railway Company Ltd published this poster in 1924.

Growing as a child in Nazi Germany, Aicher, along with his friends Hans and Sophie Scholl, organized the anti-Nazi political organization Die Weisse Rose (the White Rose). In 1943, the Scholls and Aicher were arrested by the Nazi party. While Aicher was released, the Scholls went to trial where they were found guilty of treason and executed. After the war Aicher went on to help rebuild his ravaged city of Ulm and to found the influential international school of design, Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung (HfG). In Munich's original bid for 1972 Olympic one of the main promises was to create a synthesis between sport and art. Otl Aicher was appointed as the head of the committee's visual design group, and his mandate was to deploy art in a relatively new role of promoting this global public event. From the start, posters were high on the agenda of the organizing committee, and ideas were discussed as early as September 1967 to publish a series of art posters that would ‚Äòrelate artistic activity to the Olympic Games and engage the best artists to collaborate‚Äô, and also to commission an internationally known artist for the official poster.212 POURET Henri (FRA): \\"The Artistic Environment of the Olympic Athlete\\". In: OARe 1972, pp. 164-171. Otl Aicher created the official posters for the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. As he pointed out in his essay \\"Entwurf der Moderne\\"Otl Aicher, \\"Entwurf der Moderne\\", Arch+, vol. 98, 1989. (Designing the Modern Era), the German word entwerfen, meaning \\"to draft \\"or \\"design\\", also contains the verb werfen, meaning \\"to throw\\". But where? To whom? What? And with what intention? As Benjamin Secher writes: \\"He devised an invigorating, almost Day-glo palette for the Olympics that was utterly free of red and black - banned for their association with the German flag. Athletes depicted in the official posters for each sport had their uniforms stripped of any national identifier, leaving the emphasis firmly on individual effort. Even the logo for the Games, a graphic of a radiant sun, hammered home the message of universality and, above all, optimism.\\"Benjamin Secher, A winning way with symbols, Telegraph, 21 February 2007 Aicher developed a comprehensive system to articulate the games' character across a wide range of materials, from signage to printed pieces and even staff uniforms. As the introduction to his exhibition at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art states: \\"His works including official posters and sporting event tickets, demonstrate the design tools Aicher used to join individual elements to the collective: structural grids, a bold and animating color palette, and ingenious pictograms. Aicher's orderly and pleasant design nimbly carried the weight of modern German history as it repositioned the nation's hospitality on the world stage\\". This is a poster of 1972 Olympics Yachting in Germany designed by Otl Aicher. Using a bright color scheme, borrowed from 60s pop art and psychedelic art, and combining it with German modernism Aicher creates this visual graphic program. =Current advertising= Nike's My Butt is Big poster appears to convey a bold and honest statement. The only part of a body in the picture is a butt. The text of a poem on the right repeats the curved form of the woman's bottom which is repeated again with some vividly colored splosh of red and purple dots in the background. The background is white, which contrasts with the darker skin of the model. The statement, \\"My butt is big\\" is red and larger than the rest of the poem. Image:Courvoisier Cognac.jpg  This is a modern advertisement poster for Courvoisier Cognac. A balanced composition of the hands, feet, and face of the figure on a black background appear to convey the message of this poster. This is a look alike poster advertisement for Wendy's \\"where's the Beef?\\" campaign. In the TV version of this ad, Clara Peller, a gray-haired actress, stared at an unimpressive looking hamburger and asked, \\"Where's the beef?\\" This simple message was so sharp that by asking the same question about his rival's program Vice President Walter Mondale effectively neutralized Colorado Senator Gary Hart's momentum in the 1984 presidential campaign. This is a perfume advertisement for Chanel No 5. The combination of the female figure with the number 5, together with the striking color of dress have resulted in creation of its visual graphic impact. Comics and graphic novels A comic refers to a magazine or book of narrative artwork and, virtually always, dialog and descriptive prose. Despite the term, the subject matter in comic is not necessarily humorous; in fact, it is often serious and action-oriented. Due to the fact that graphic design constitutes the main foundation of comics it plays a crucial role in conveying various narratives through its compositional devices, line drawings and colouring scheme.Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art, Harper Paperbacks (April 27, 1994), .

Lichtenstein's Drowning Girl, and its word balloon appears to have been inspired by a comic similar to this work. Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Roy Lichtenstein used the splash page of a romance story lettered by Ira Schnapp in Secret Hearts, (volume 83, November 1962), and slightly reworked the art and dialogue by re-lettering Schnapp's original word balloon. This precise composition, titled Drowning Girl (1963) is now part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.Janis Hendrickson and Roy Lichtenstein, Roy Lichtenstein, Benedikt Taschen Verlag (June 1996), , Diane Waldman, Roy Lichtenstein, Guggenheim Museum Pubns (November 1994), , Elizabeth Brown, Dave Hickey, Roy Lichtenstein, and Chris Bruce; Roy Lichtenstein: Prints 1956-1997, Marquand Books, Inc./Museum of Art/Washington State University (October 15, 2005), , Susan Goldman Rubin, Whaam!

Web Design Graphic design is used to make a web site understandable, memorable and attractive to the end user as well to present its content in a user friendly fashion.According to the web designer Armin Vit; although, web sites are a different breed of design project, the same principles of graphic design apply: \\"How do you render information in a manner that is understandable, memorable and pleasing to the end user? ... Yet, when it comes to web design it's rare that all elements ‚Äî functionality, clarity of information, and subjective beauty ‚Äî come together to create a result that is widely admired, recognized or lauded in the same vein as anything resembling the likes of Saul Bass‚Äô AT&T; logo, or Susan Kare's icons for the original Mac OS\\". (Armin Vit Landmark Web sites, where Art Thaou?) Graphic design ties in closely to user interface design and user experience design for the web, since aesthetics can impact how well people are able to interact with web content. The web dates back to the early 1980s at CERN, a European high energy physics research facility. Tim Berners-Lee who did the initial development stage was interested in the ability to link academic papers electronically and to utilize the internet in order to correspond with people in other laboratories around the world.

Notable artworks  Eric Millikin with one of his \\"Danger Beast\\" murals of endangered animals created from endangered Venus flytraps. Millikin's art often includes self-portraits as well as portraits of celebrities and political figures. His work often incorporates mixed media and found objects, such as packages of candy, paper currency, and spiders. His large-scale artwork takes full advantage of the internet's formal possibilities, and has incorporated animation and winding \\"infinite canvas\\" designs, going beyond the limited sizes and shapes of conventional printed pages.McCloud, Scott (July 25, 2000). \\"Reinventing Comics\\".

Millikin's artwork has been published in books, serialized in newspapers, and displayed in art museums. * Danger Beasts: Since 2016, Millikin has created the Danger Beast series of street art portraits of endangered animals created out of endangered plants, including a portrait of Harambe the gorilla made from Venus flytraps. * Made of Money, a series of portraits of accomplished historical figures who died in poverty, created from cut up paper currency woven together. Portraits in the series have included Nikola Tesla, Hedy Lamarr, Joe Louis, Vincent Van Gogh, and Edgar Allan Poe. Millikin created the portraits as a statement on economic inequality, as a reminder \\"that our best people aren't always rewarded with wealth, and that our wealthiest people aren't always our best.\\" As part of the ArtPrize festival in 2017, Millikin created a small fold-up book of the series and installed it inside one of the small PO Boxes at the local Post Office, as a critique of the large scale pieces that typically dominate the festival. Since the ArtPrize festival was created by the wealthy family of President Donald Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the installation was widely seen as an attack on the perceived greed and unearned wealth of DeVos and Trump. * Totally Sweet, a series of pop art, large-scale portraits of monsters, each created from thousands of packages of Halloween candy and a single spider. Millikin uses over 40 different kinds of candy, and a single portrait can take between 5,000 and 10,000 candies. Included in the series are portraits of such monsters as Freddy Krueger, Lily Munster, Gort, Godzilla and the Bride of Frankenstein. Millikin compares his artistic technique of building large monsters from many smaller parts to the similar techniques Victor Frankenstein used to create his monster. * Hollywood Witch Trials, a series of painted portraits of celebrities like Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan based on their crime mug shots, stylized to look like witches, and combined with excerpts from transcripts of the Salem Witch Trials. The portraits are characterized by brilliantly colored paint brushed and smeared into expressionist swirls and spirals.Vincent, Pheroze L. (September 24, 2009). \\"Spinning a dark web of fun\\".

For example, Millikin's Pride, Prejudice and Frankenstein contains twenty \\"experimental horrific love poems,\\" each a variation on the same theme, with each starting with the beginning words of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, ending with the final words of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and the middle words consisting of overlapping text from both sources.

The version of tiep called thieboudienne or chebu jen (; ) is prepared with fish, rice and tomato sauce cooked in one pot, and it is considered the national dish. There are also tiep yappa (with meat) and tiep ganaar (with chicken). Additional ingredients often include onions, carrots, cabbage, cassava, hot pepper, lime and peanut oil, and Maggi cubes. These ingredients are common in the country. Historically, tiep is commonly attributed to the city of Saint-Louis, in the nineteenth century. The name of the dish comes from Wolof words meaning \\"rice\\" (ceeb) and \\"fish\\" (j√´n). In Pulaar it is known as maaro e liddi (rice and fish). It is served on large trays with the rice on the bottom and the fish, usually White grouper (Epinephelus aeneus), and the vegetables, many of them whole placed in the center. Tiep bears a strong resemblance‚Äîin ingredients, presentation, and significance‚Äîto Maghrebi cuscus. Traditionally it is eaten in a large communal dish with the hand. It is also the symbol of the Senegalese Terranga (hospitality): Family, visiting friends, and/or guests gather around a single dish (called a bolus) in which everyone is using a spoon (couddou Pulaar) or a piece of bread. The Gullah dish, red rice, resembles thieboudienne, suggesting a creolization of foodways from West Africa in the New World by enslaved Africans and their descendants. Like thieboudienne , there are regional variations of red rice throughout the Gullah/Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, including Savannah red rice and Charleston red rice.  Recipe  It is a preparation of fresh or dried fish, and rice (rice Wolof), cooked with vegetables (such as cassava, pumpkin, cabbage, carrot, turnip, or eggplant), parsley, tomato paste, peppers, garlic and onions. Originally made with fish, it is nowadays frequent to see it served with beef or even chicken.  Variations = By Country = Originally from Senegal, the traditional recipe includes fish, rice, tomato and onions. However, tiep is commonly consumed in several countries in West Africa. Depending on the country, the recipe and the ingredients change‚Äîeven the method of cooking can differ. In Mali, tiep is known as \\"tieb,\\" a dish consisting of chicken, rice and vegetables such as a tomato and onion base. Another type of tiep is the Jollof or \\"Djolof\\" (in Wolof, the national language) rice also called \\"Benachin\\" which means 'one pot' in Wolof. It is a popular dish especially in Nigeria and Ghana. The components are similar to the original recipe's ingredients with the inclusion of tomatoes, rice and onions. Tiep made with beef, rice and vegetables. = By Ethnicity = Senegal's distinctive ethnic groups have their own variations on cuisine and eating habits, influenced either by proximity to the ocean or the traditions of nomadism and cattle raising. For instance, people from southern Senegal usually also add some kouthia, while people from Dakar and Saint-Louis will use some \\"soul\\" (Wolof).  History and culture = In Senegal = The Senegalese \\"Teranga\\", or hospitality, is an important aspect of the Senegalese tradition of sharing food and cooking for your hosts, and it is very rude for a guest to refuse food, or refuse to share a meal. All are welcome to eat, even in the poorest household. It is a given that food is a blessing from God, and is here to be shared. There is always \\"a share for the stranger\\". People take enormous pride in their welcoming tradition and go to great length in order to fulfill what is seen as a responsibility toward their guests, or even an unannounced visitor. There‚Äôs a belief that eating around the bowl means there‚Äôs always enough food for everyone rather than eating on individual plates. Eating from the bowl teaches children values. One of them is that once they have food in your mouth they have to wait for the next portion until everyone else is ready before putting their hand back in the bowl. This teaches you to be patient. When they reach into the bowl with their hand, they have to eat from the section right in front of them. They cannot reach over to the other side. They can‚Äôt eat from the middle of the bowl. That‚Äôs where all the meat and vegetables are kept. That section is for the mother. As they eat, she regularly distributes what‚Äôs at the center of the bowl to everyone eating from it, so that each person receives an equal portion. Therefore, sharing is another value learned from the bowl. Embracing teranga for the Senegalese equates to your success in life. They are taught early on to be hospitable, to be generous, to be sharing, to be grateful, to embrace others. This equates to the cooking. The tiep (Fish) made with rice, fish and vegetables. = Food and religion customs = The Senegalese generally eat three meals a day. The main meal is at about 1:00 PM. Senegalese eat from a communal platter or large bowl with the right hand, as is the Muslim custom.  Benefits  Tiep consumption is understandable from the farming point of view but also from its benefits. Eating plenty of fish on a regular basis can help protect you from a range of serious diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer or heart disease. Eating a diet rich in vegetables may reduce risk for stroke, cancer, heart diseases and type-2 diabetes. The nutrients in vegetables are vital for health and maintenance of your body. The health benefits of rice include its ability to provide fast and instant energy, regulate and improve bowel movements, stabilize blood sugar levels, and slow down the aging process, while also providing an essential source of vitamin B1 to the human body. Other benefits include its ability to boost skin health, increase the metabolism, aid in digestion, reduce high blood pressure, help weight loss efforts, improve the immune system and provide protection against dysentery, cancer, and heart disease.

He played a leading role in the establishment of eisteddfodau in Wales in the nineteenth century. Life Jenkins, who was born in a farmhouse in Llangoedmor in Ceredigion, Wales, on 8 April 1770, studied at the school in Llangoedmor and Carmarthen Academy before obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Oxford in 1793. He was initially a member of Jesus College, Oxford before transferring to Merton College. He was ordained in 1793 and his first post was at Whippingham, Isle of Wight, where he acted as curate to the rector, who was his uncle. From 1799 onwards, he was chaplain of , then of , in the West Indies. After illness, he returned to Wales to become rector of Manordeifi in Pembrokeshire, before Thomas Burgess (the Bishop of St David's) appointed him as vicar of Ceri in Montgomeryshire in 1807. The name of the village gave him the name by which he was known as an antiquarian, Ifor Ceri. (\\"Ifor\\" was after Ifor ap Llywelyn, patron of the medieval Welsh poet Dafydd ap Gwilym - Jenkins was very hospitable towards poets and musicians at his house in Ceri.) On one visit in 1818, Thomas Burgess and Jenkins decided \\"to rekindle the bardic skill and ingenuity of the principality ... by holding eisteddfodau in different places in the four provinces\\". Jenkins carried on directing eisteddfodau until 1829 when he decided that the English influence was too strong. His work paved the way for the National Eisteddfods beginning later in the century. He also collected folk songs, hymn tunes and psalm tunes, and wrote local histories and other articles, some in Welsh. He helped to reform the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion.

The trio was formed in Tuva, Siberia in 1996. They have played in concerts in Asia and Europe, and released four CDs, including Infinity (2008), which was a new type of CD that is different every time it is played. In a review of K-Space's second album, Going Up (2004), Fran√ßois Couture of AllMusic described their music as a mixture of \\"psychedelic shamanism\\" and \\"the strangest Krautrock you ever heard\\". History Tim Hodgkinson, co-founder of the English avant-rock group Henry Cow, and Ken Hyder, founder of the Celtic/jazz band Talisker, first began collaborating in 1978. After one of Hodgkinson's concerts in Moscow in 1989, Hodgkinson asked Hyder if he would like to play \\"all of Russia\\". Hodgkinson, a social anthropology graduate, was interested in making contact with rural Russian musicians and ritual specialists. In 1990 and under the banner \\"Friendly British Invasion: in Search for the Soviet Sham(an)s\\", Hodgkinson and Hyder toured seven Soviet cities covering Siberia and Soviet Far East as well as Moscow and Leningrad, requiring (quite regular for foreigners at the time) separate registration (KGB) clearance for every city they performed in. They were the first British musicians to play in Vladivostok since the Russian Revolution. This was the first of a series of study trips Hodgkinson and Hyder made to Siberia to explore shamanic culture. At the time shamanism had been suppressed by the Soviets but was still practised in secret by the locals. Initially little interest was shown in the duo, but soon they started to meet shamans and experience first hand shamanic rituals in which the shaman enters a trance state using drum and voice. This had a profound effect on Hyder and Hodgkinson. What interested them was the improvisational and musical aspects of the ritual, because it raised questions as to whether the psychological state of a performer is more important than musical technique. They began working with shamans from Tuva, Altay and Khakassia, and meet the musicians of Biosintes, \\"a kind of Tuvan Sun Ra band\\" which included Gendos Chamzyryn. Chamzyryn, a shaman from Tuva, played a variety of traditional Tuvan instruments and used the deep-vocal Kargiraa style of overtone-singing. Hyder and Hodgkinson invited Chamzyryn to join them on a tour of Altay villages in 1996. During this tour Chamzyryn took the unusual step of \\"shamanising\\" on stage, which had never been done before because the use of voice and drum by shamans is not primarily musical. But their performances were well received and the success of this experiment prompted the trio to form a group they called K-Space. From 1999 K-Space began touring Siberia and later Western Europe, which included concerts in France, Germany, Austria and Italy. In 2005 they returned in Tuva and performed with local musicians and shamans. =Recordings= K-Space's first CD, Bear Bones (2002) contains recordings made by the trio between 1996 and 2001. For their next CD, Going Up (2004) they took K-Space performances recorded in Siberia and Europe, plus field recordings of shamanic rituals, and manipulated and superimposed them on one another to produce a sound collage of what Hyder called \\"total music\\". In 2008 K-Space broke new ground when they released Infinity, a new type of CD that is different every time it is played. It was created with the help of programmer Andy Wilson, and uses software to remix source material located on the disc to produce an \\"infinite\\" number of different musical pieces. In 2013 a live album, Black Sky was released, which was recorded in Catania, Sicily. =Name= K-Space is short for Kozyrev-Space and refers to a space/time warp supposedly created by Russian astrophysicist Nicolai Kozyrev. Kozyrev believed that time was a channel for energy and built a device known as Kozyrev's Mirrors to prove his theory. When Hodgkinson and Hyder were in Akademgorodok, the educational and scientific centre of Siberia, they experienced first-hand the effects of Kozyrev's Mirrors. Hyder has said that their second album, Going Up (2004) was directly influenced by the \\"esoteric theories\\" of Kozyrev.

It was released in the United States in August 2008 by Ad Hoc Records, an affiliate of Recommended Records, and was a new type of CD that is different every time it is played. \\"Infinity\\" will not work in a standard CD player and requires a computer to play it. Each time the CD is played, supplied software remixes source material located on the disc and produces a new 20-minute musical piece. The CD cannot be paused or fast-forwarded, and there are no tracks to select. The only controls available are \\"PLAY\\" and \\"STOP\\". The music produced by the CD is electroacoustic improvisation that is rooted in Tuvan shaman ritual music. Background K-Space was formed in 1996 after a series of study trips to Siberia by Scottish percussionist Ken Hyder and English multi-instrumentalist Tim Hodgkinson. They were exploring the improvisational and musical aspects of shamanism when they met up with Gendos Chamzyryn, a shaman and musician from Tuva. Hyder, Hodgkinson and Chamzyryn formed K-Space to experiment with improvised music rooted in the Tuvan shamanic ritual. Their second album, Going Up (2004) was a sound collage of K-Space performances plus field recordings of shamanic rituals, manipulated and superimposed on one another. Infinity extended Going Up's production process and made it dynamic to produce a new mix with each play. Technology The idea for the Infinity project began when Tim Hodgkinson started describing some of the implicit rules that K-Space use during their live improvisations. It occurred to him that these rules could be embedded in software that would produce interesting variations on the original process. Hodgkinson discussed his ideas with Andy Wilson (aka The Grand Erector), a software designer and webmaster of German krautrock band Faust's website, The Faust Pages. They investigated ways to select sound files within different contexts and to use them in different ways to produce a new stream of music with each play. Wilson then set about developing \\"metacompositional\\" software that compiles and sequences deconstructed fragments of sound files. These sound sources were provided by K-Space and include field recordings, throat singing, various percussion, string and reed instruments. The number of audio files available were restricted by the size limitations of the CD format, but when combined and permutated, they would create an apparently infinite number of different \\"compositions\\", and hence the album title Infinity. The audio files are categorized into a number of groups, including acoustic, live, solo, environmental and loops. A single audio file can be used in many different ways by varying, for example, dynamic levels, volume and duration of play. For a particular piece, for example, the software might select any two of seven acoustic files and play them together for x seconds, adding one of four environmental files after y seconds. The sound source selection process the software uses is not random, but algorithmic based on scores Hodgkinson wrote for the project. Each time \\"PLAY\\" is pressed, the software selects a new score which it uses to construct a new piece of music. The score consists of a set of audio file selection criteria, which vary depending on what has happened before. While there are a finite number of scores on the CD, there are many different interpretations of each score. Each play lasts about 20 minutes, a time span which was chosen with the shamans of Tuva in mind, and how each of their rituals produces a different journey. The 20-minute period of intense music was also chosen to deviate from the standard music CD playing times, albeit an \\"infinite\\" number of different 20-minute plays.Infinity CD liner notes. In October 2008 the software developed for this project was made available to anyone interested in working with it. Wilson also prepared a continuous play version of Infinity for the K-Space exhibition in the Stuttgart Ethnographic Museum. Reception John Cavanagh of The Herald in Glasgow said in a review of the album that even though he knew each listening was the result of a \\"computer triggered sequence\\", it always sounded like a \\"cohesive musical work, as though it was meant to be that way\\". Requirements \\"Infinity\\" must be played on a Windows PC or an Apple Mac computer. The computer software required to play the music is included on the CD. The computer must have a CD drive, a 200 MHz or greater processor, at least 1.5Gb of RAM, and a sound card or stereo interface.

Antrodia species have fruit bodies that typically resupinate (i.e., lying flat or spread out on the growing surface), with the hymenium exposed to the outside; the edges may be turned so as to form narrow brackets. Most species are found in temperate and boreal forests, and cause brown rot. Description Antrodia are effused- resupinate, that is, they lie stretched out on the growing surface with the hymenium exposed on the outer side, but turned out at the edges to form brackets. When present, these brackets are typically white or pale brown. The pores on the surface of the hymenium may be round or angular. The context is white or pale. All species cause brown-rot. Typically, basidiospores are thin- walled, cylindrical, and narrowly ellipsoidal or fusiform in shape. Most species grow on the wood of coniferous trees, except for A. albida, which grows on the dead wood of deciduous trees. Phylogeny In order to reliably identify the various species and strains of medicinal Antrodia, genetic markers have been developed and phylogenetic analyses performed. These analyses have demonstrated that there are three distinct phylogenetic lineages within the genus Antrodia. Classification The modern definition of the genus follows the description given by Gilbertson and Ryvarden (1986), in their monograph North American Polypores.

As its name suggests, it was purportedly an affliction of the scrotum affecting male players of the cello. History The original letter was written by Dr Elaine Murphy but signed by her husband John as a joke to compare with a previous letter regarding 'guitar nipple', a condition reportedly occurring when some styles of guitar playing excessively irritate the player's nipple (a form of contact dermatitis similar to jogger's nipple), which Murphy and her husband believed was likely a joke. Murphy now points out that even a cursory study of the cellist's posture would show that the 'cello scrotum' complaint would not occur. The unlikelihood of a cellist's posture contributing to scrotal injury was raised back in 1974, but seems to have been overlooked. Murphy admitted the hoax in 2009 in another letter to the BMJ after an article in the 2008 Christmas edition of the BMJ made reference to the complaint. The truth of the case report had already been questioned in the medical literature in 1991. (in reference to ) Others have cited it, although expressing scepticism.

Adsorption nitrogen generator  Adsorption technology = Adsorption concept = Adsorption nitrogen generator The adsorption gas separation process in nitrogen generators is based on the phenomenon of fixing various gas mixture components by a solid substance called an adsorbent. This phenomenon is brought about by the gas and adsorbent molecules' interaction. = Pressure swing adsorption technology = The technology of air-to-nitrogen production with the use of adsorption processes in nitrogen generators is well studied and widely applied at industrial facilities for the recovery of high-purity nitrogen. The operating principle of a nitrogen generator utilizing the adsorption technology is based upon the dependence of the adsorption rates featured by various gas mixture components upon pressure and temperature factors. Among nitrogen adsorption plants of various types, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants have found the broadest application world-wide. The system's design is based on the regulation of gas adsorption and adsorbent regeneration by means of changing pressures in two adsorber‚Äìadsorbent-containing vessels. This process requires constant temperature, close to ambient. With this process, nitrogen is produced by the plant at the above-atmospheric pressure, while the adsorbent regeneration is accomplished at below-atmospheric pressure. The swing adsorption process in each of the two adsorbers consists of two stages running for a few minutes. At the adsorption stage oxygen, H2O and CO2 molecules diffuse into the pore structure of the adsorbent whilst the nitrogen molecules are allowed to travel through the adsorber‚Äìadsorbent-containing vessel. At the regeneration stage the adsorbed components are released from the adsorbent vented into the atmosphere. The process is then multiplely repeated. = Advantages = * High nitrogen purity: PSA nitrogen generator plants allow production of high-purity nitrogen from air, which membrane systems are unable to provide ‚Äì up to 99.9995% nitrogen. But in most cases they do not produce more than 98.8% nitrogen with the remainder being argon that is not separated from the nitrogen by the usual PSA process. The argon is not normally a problem, as argon is more inert than nitrogen. This nitrogen purity may also be ensured by cryogenic systems, but they are considerably more complex and justified only by large consumption volumes. The nitrogen generators use CMS (carbon molecular sieve) technology to produce a continuous supply of ultra high purity nitrogen and are available with internal compressors or without. * Low operating costs: By substitution of out-of-date air separation plants nitrogen production savings largely exceed 50%. The net cost of nitrogen produced by nitrogen generators is significantly less than the cost of bottled or liquefied nitrogen. * Environmental impact: Generating nitrogen gas is a sustainable, environmentally friendly and energy efficient approach to providing pure, clean, dry nitrogen gas. Compared to the energy needed for a cryogenic air separation plant and the energy needed to transport the liquid nitrogen from the plant to the facility, generated nitrogen consumes less energy and creates far fewer greenhouse gases.  Membrane technology  Membrane nitrogen generator = Gas separation concept = The operation of membrane systems is based on the principle of differential velocity with which various gas mixture components permeate membrane substance. The driving force in the gas separation process is the difference in partial pressures on different membrane sides. = Membrane cartridge = Flux distribution inside the fiber Structurally, a hollow-fiber membrane represents a cylindrical cartridge functioning as a spool with specifically reeled polymer fibers. Gas flow is supplied under pressure into a bundle of membrane fibers. Due to the difference in partial pressures on the external and internal membrane surface gas flow separation is accomplished. = Advantages = * Economic benefits: By substitution of cryogenic or adsorption systems nitrogen production savings generally exceed 50%. The net cost of nitrogen produced by nitrogen complexes is significantly less than the cost of cylinder or liquefied nitrogen. * Module design: With respect to the simplicity of the system, a nitrogen generator can be split into modules. This is in direct contrast to classical systems where the equipment is designed for a certain stage of the separation process. Using a modular system, the generation facility may be built from a selection of preexisting equipment and where necessary, the output capacity of a plant may be increased at the minimum cost. This option appears all the more useful where a project envisages a subsequent increase in enterprise capacity, or where demand may simply require on site production of nitrogen by employing equipment that is already present. * Dependability: Gas separation units have no moving component parts, thus ensuring exceptional reliability. Membranes are highly resistant to vibration and shocks, chemically inert to greases, moisture-insensitive, and capable of operating over a wide temperature range of ‚Äì40¬∞–° to +60¬∞–°. With appropriate maintenance, membrane unit useful life ranges between 130,000 and 180,000 hours (15 to 20 years of continuous operation). = Disadvantages = * Limited capacity * Relatively low purity compared to PSA units (95% to 99% purity as compared to 99.9995% - higher purity applications are available at lower flow rates ‚â§ 10L/min)  Applications of nitrogen generators  * Food and beverage industries: The moment food or beverages are produced, or fruits and vegetables harvested, an aging process kicks in until the complete decay of the products. This is caused by bacteria and other organisms. Generators are used to flood the products with N2 that displaces the oxygen and prolongs the product lifetime significantly because these organisms cannot develop. Furthermore, chemical degradation of food caused by oxidation can be eliminated or stopped. * Analytical chemistry: Nitrogen generators are required for various forms of analytical chemistry such as liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry and gas chromatography where a stable and continuous supply of nitrogen is necessary. * Aircraft & motor vehicle tires: Although air is 78% nitrogen, most aircraft tires are filled with pure nitrogen. There are many tire and automotive shops with nitrogen generators to fill tires. The advantage of using nitrogen is that the tank is dry. Often a compressed air tank will have water in it that comes from atmospheric water vapor condensing in the tank after leaving the air compressor. Nitrogen maintains a more stable pressure when heated and cooled as a result of being dry and doesn't permeate the tire as easily due to being a slightly larger molecule (155 pm) than O2 (152 pm). * Chemical and petrochemical industries: The primary and very important application of nitrogen in chemical and petrochemical industries is the provision of inert environment aimed at ensuring general industrial safety during cleaning and protection of process vessels. In addition, nitrogen is used for pipelines pressure testing, chemical agents transportation, and regeneration of used catalysts in technological processes. * Electronics: In electronics, nitrogen serves to displace oxygen in the manufacture of semi-conductors and electric circuits, heat treatment of finished products, as well as in blowing and cleaning. The most common uses in electronics are in the soldering process. Specifically Selective, Reflow, and Wave Soldering equipment. Membrane nitrogen generator providing supervisory gas to dry pipe fire sprinkler system *Fire Protection: The fire protection industry uses nitrogen gas for two different applications - fire suppression and corrosion prevention. Nitrogen generators are used in hypoxic air fire prevention systems to produce air with a low oxygen content which will suppress a fire. To prevent corrosion, nitrogen generators are used in place of or in conjunction with a compressed air system to provide supervisory nitrogen gas in place of air for dry pipe and pre-action fire sprinkler systems. * Glass industry: In glass production, nitrogen proves efficient as a cooling agent for electric arc furnace electrodes as well as to displace oxygen during process procedures. * Metallurgy: The metal industry generally utilizes nitrogen as a means of protecting ferrous and non-ferrous metals during annealing. Also, nitrogen is helpful in such standard industry processes as neutral tempering, cementing, hard brazing, stress relieving, cyanide hardening, metal-powder sintering and extrusion die cooling. * Paint-and-varnish industry: Paint and varnish production uses nitrogen for the creation of an inert environment in process vessels to ensure safety, as well as for oxygen displacement during packing in order to prevent polymerization of drying oils. * Petroleum industry: In the petroleum industry, nitrogen is an indispensable component in a number of processes. Most commonly, nitrogen is used to create an inert environment for preventing explosions and for fire safety and to support transportation and transfer of hydrocarbons. Additionally, nitrogen is used for pipeline testing and purging, cleaning technological vessels and cleaning liquefied gas carriers and hydrocarbon storage facilities. * Pharmaceutical industry: In the pharmaceutical industry, nitrogen finds application in pharmaceuticals packaging, and ensuring against explosion and fire safety in activities where fine dispersed substances are used.

It was founded by Goenawan Mohamad and Yusril Djalinus and the first edition was published on 6 March 1971. History=New Order era= On June 21, 1994, under the New Order of President Suharto, Information Minister Harmoko banned the publishing of Tempo magazine, along with two other weekly news magazines, Editor and DeTik, citing them as a threat to national stability. In response to the ban, a number of journalists established the Alliance of Independent Journalists (Aliansi Jurnalis Independen). Publication of Tempo resumed following Suharto's departure from office in 1998. =Post New Order era= The magazine has continued its independent position, and on 27 June 2010 published a story about police corruption, based on leaked documents showing that six senior police officers had bank accounts containing millions of dollars, in one case more than US$10 million, on monthly salaries of around US$1600. A few days later (6 July) the magazine's editorial offices in central Jakarta were firebombed by two black-clad men on a motorcycle. Little damage ensued but the attack was widely presumed to be linked to the police.The Test of Indonesia's Press Freedom, Asia Sentinel, 7 July 2010 In the early morning hours on the day the story broke, officials presumed to be connected with the police vainly tried to buy up all the copies of the offending story. Although they purchased 30,000 copies in central Jakarta, no other areas were affected, and vendors doubled the price of the much-in-demand remainder. Tempo simply printed and supplied its distributors with 30,000 replacement copies. The action only added to the publicity surrounding the story. Tempo 's previous editor-in-chief is Wahyu Muryadi. Since November 2012, the position replaced by Arif Zulkifli, the youngest editor in Tempo 's history. Tempo has evolved its internet presence with Tempo.co. Besides the weekly magazine, Tempo also publishes a daily newspaper, Koran Tempo. It provides semi-investigative news about political and economic issues. The newspaper is only published in Indonesian but foreign readers can read other versions, including English, at Tempo.co. Its style of journalism is different from other Indonesian daily newspapers. Tempo provides news in the style of what they call 'the story behind the story'. So, what is served to the readers is not only current events, but also the story following and behind the news. Magazine Tempo magazine is published in Indonesian. Starting from 12 September 2000, Tempo has also been published in English. Since its inception, the deputy editor-in- chief of the English edition of Tempo has been Yuli Ismartono, who during Tempo's ban was the vice-president of corporate communications for Freeport Indonesia.

With the 73rd and 74th amendmentsSee 74th Constitutional amendment act 1994 of the Constitution of India, decentralization of planning is emphasized and the methodology of district plan was changed. The approach suggested for the preparation of the district plan is as follows:-.See the Drsft guidelines for the preparation of district plan, Govt of Assam, Panchayat and Rural Development Department, Dispur , Guwahaty Steps in district planning The sequence in the preparation of district plan can be as follows * Preparation of district vision, block vision and gram panchayat level vision. * Preparation of participatory plan involving Gram Sabha from Gram Panchayats to Zilla Parishad. * Preparation of plans by Urban Local Bodies. * Consolidation of plans prepared by local bodies by District Planning Committees. Planning starts with the preparation of vision documents by local bodies.See Manual for integrated district planning, New Delhi, Planning Commission, 2008 PP 51 - 132 Block vision After finalizing the vision document for the district at the district level, the document will be discussed at the block level and a vision document for the block will be prepared with some modifications based on the conditions of the block. The vision document for each block need not be completely different because the agro-ecological conditions of some planning units at this level may be same, particularly when a district is divided into a large number of Inter Mediate Panchayats as in the case of Andhra Pradesh. Even though the same vision is adopted for some blocks / mandals, it is necessary to have the vision owned by the Intermediate Panchayat. This exercise will be done by a team of experts at block level. The same team will be responsible for plans at the GP level. However, the team will take some members like professionals or retired persons belonging to the area to assist the team in the preparation of the plan. The general formats for planning at the lowest unit level viz., GP or ULB will be prepared at the district level and they will be adopted with certain modifications at the block level. Vision of the Gram Panchayat will also be prepared accordingly. The vision of the GP will be based on the Socio-economic Profile of the GP and views of the GP. Plan for grama panchayat/municipality At the third stage, the plan at the GP or ULB will be prepared. This will be prepared by the team with the help of people's participation. The will first interact with the GP and prepare a vision on the lines of the district vision. Once the Gram Panchayat vision is approved, the team will conduct several Group Discussions to find out the potentials, needs and constraints of the village economy in Gram Sabha. The felt needs of these communities and the support needed for improving their livelihood conditions will be elicited. Once this exercise is completed, it will be discussed in the Gram Sabha. This approach will help to study the situation thoroughly and prepare the plan. In particular, all the schemes CSS State sponsored schemes will be examined thoroughly with a view to understand their suitability to the area. This can be more easily ascertained from the beneficiaries/stake holders. The plan should also take into account the long term development perspective of the GP and also natural resource management (NRM) aspects. Plan for block panchayats The above three steps followed the top down approach in the preparation of the district plan. After this GP Plan is prepared and no plan is ready at higher levels except the vision. The Plans at the higher levels will be prepared in the next steps. In this step, the GP plans will be consolidated and put before the IP. In the GP plans, the benefits of some of the schemes will go beyond the GP and such schemes may figure in the other GP plans also. Hence, they have to be separated and duplication has to be avoided. Similarly, some schemes which provide benefits beyond the GP level may not be identified in any GP. The Block Plan has to identify those schemes / projects. This exercise will be done at the meetings of the Intermediate Panchayat level. District plan The final stage is the preparation of the district plan. This will be finalized after the Block Plans are finalized in the same way as the Block Plan is finalized on the basis of the GP Plans in the Block. The schemes that will not figure in the Block Plans, but are essential for the development of the district will be identified at this stage. Further, an attempt will have to be made to achieve functional and spatial integration and use the norms for the provision of social infrastructure. Integration of entire local plans In the realization of the district vision, district plans will need to put together resources channelised from all sources including district segments to the State Plan, CSSs, Special Programmes such as Employment Guarantee, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan, Rural Health Mission, Grants-in-aid for specific purposes from Finance Commission, Bharat Nirman etc. Therefore consolidation is a task that goes much beyond compilation and connotes a degree of value addition through integration of local plans. There are several aspects of integration of plans that have to be considered in the preparation of the draft development plan. The different dimensions of integration have been discussed very succinctly in the planning guidelinesSee Guidelines for decentralized planning in local governments of Govt of Kerala for eleventh five-year plan, Govt Order(MS) No. 128/2007/LSGD, dated,14-05-2007, for local bodies in Kerala as detailed below and could be adapted for general use: *Spatial integration This would mean integration of schemes such as roads that run through one or more Panchayats. Such kinds of Multi Panchayat infrastructure projects could be taken up with proportionate contributions from the Panchayats concerned dovetailed into the funding available from above and entrusted to one local government for execution. * Sectoral integration This relates to the integration that takes place within a sector. For instance, an integrated approach to agricultural development would require the integration of several schemes relating to agriculture, such as horticulture, drip irrigation, high yielding varieties and integrated pest management. * Cross- sectoral integration To ensure maximum impact from different interventions, it is necessary to design approaches that draw resources from various schemes. For instance, a good approach to public health would require inputs from water and sanitation allocations and health programme allocations. Again, a typical watershed management programme would comprise soil conservation, water harvesting, micro irrigation, bio-mass generation, fisheries, animal husbandry, agro processing and micro enterprise components, all properly sequenced. *Vertical integration This is based on the precept that District and Intermediate Panchayats ought to perform activities which have the advantages of scale and which cannot be done by the lower tiers of local government. This will require that Block Panchayats have a clear idea as to what the draft plans of Village Panchayats will contain, Similarly the District Panchayats would need to consider the approved plans of Village and Block Panchayats before finalizing theirs. *Integration of resources There are several schemes both Centrally sponsored and State sponsored which Panchayats can utilize, integrate into local plans and to which they can contribute additional resources. This would comprise two aspects, as below: *Integration with State Plans There are several State Plans, which as implemented can be strengthened by increased allocation from Panchayat funds. In some cases a component having a complementary nature could be added to the State Plan Scheme. For instance, the drawing of electric wires to villages could be complemented by the Panchayat taking up the wiring of BPL houses. *Integration of CSSs with local plans It is important that in the interest of efficient use of resources, there ought to be only one development plan for the local government prepared through a common planning process and not a set of separate plans prepared in accordance with the guidelines of each programme. Thus once priorities and works are identified and prioritized through a single planning process, components pertaining to a particular sector could be taken up through schemes, including CSSs while still keeping within the guidelines of those schemes. *Integration with local resources Planning can provide for local investments to be catalysed through local resources or initiatives. For example, village knowledge centers and Rural business Hubs could be catalysed by Panchayats. This is also possible by extending the concept of Pura to encompass the concept of rural business hubs. By this, we do not meant that Panchayats ought to run industry locally, but that it catalogs local skills and natural resource endowments and facilitate the development of business linkages. *Rural Urban Integration Integration of urban-rural plans, which is particularly important in the light of increasing urbanization, is an area where the District Planning Committee could contribute a great deal. The DPC should work out mechanisms of joint programmes to be financed by State government institutions and joint contributions by urban and rural local bodies.

She has been married to Paulo Coelho since 1980. Oiticica is known for using an exotic neoconcretist technique that is reminiscent of both land art and eco art, a technique that allows nature‚Äôs elements to act upon her works. Oiticica is a \\"daughter\\" of the experimental art movement of the 1970s arisen in Rio de Janeiro, where she was born, and has taken her paintings all around the world. Oiticica idealized the combination of land art ‚Äì which uses nature as foundation matter ‚Äì with a painting in the French Pyrenees, five years ago, when she decided to paint a 10-meter long canvas in the middle of nature in the open air, as she realized not to have a covered area that would enable her to create on such surface. Once her work was finished, she left it to dry right there, outside. On the next day, as she went back to pick it up, she found that dust, dirt, leaves and some insects had been integrated to the canvas. \\"With no premeditation, nature had given its unique touch to the painting.\\" The artist began this technique painting in the forests, valleys and mountains of the Pyrenees, in France. The result of this work is her book The Four Seasons. Soon after, between 2004 and 2005, she buried many canvases in the Amazon Rainforest forest in Brazil and waited a year to retrieve them. The humid and equatorial forest left their indelible marks on her paintings. In 2005, she took her work up to the Sacred Valley of Ganespura, in India. Between 2006 and 2008, Oiticica elected the Saint James Way, a sacred and symbolic place that receives pilgrims from all over the world, as her studio. She composed her canvases at different locations along the Way, using the relief of rocks, the intervention of rain, snow, the color of the soil, natural pigments and wax. Once composed, they were \\"planted\\" on the ground and recovered months later. Generally, Oiticica leaves her canvases \\"planted\\" for a period of nine months (the cycle of a pregnancy) or for one year (cycle of the four seasons).  Exhibitions  In twenty years of artistic career, Oiticica‚Äôs works have been exhibited in more than sixty galleries in twenty countries.

His most prestigious victories include the Swedish Trotting Derby (Swedish: Svenskt Travderby), Elitloppet, Nat Ray Trot and Gran Premio della Lotteria. At the end of his career, the gelding had earned US$5,168,902 (‚Ç¨4,085,814).Victory Tilly won 37,705,278 Swedish Kronor (SEK). In the conversion to USD and Euro, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of Victory Tilly's last race, have been used. He was awarded the Swedish Horse of the Year Award in 2000 and 2002. Early years Victory Tilly was born on May 3, 1995, in Almunge, Uppsala municipality, Sweden. He spent his years as a colt at his breeder's, Stall Tilly. Glen Norman was in charge of the training of the stable's race horses and was Victory Tilly's trainer in the horse's early years. During this period, as a two-year-old, Victory Tilly was castrated because of testicle problems. As a gelding, he was ineligible to enter major French events like Prix d'Am√©rique, that are open only for stallions and mares. Racing career=1998 - 3 years old= On June 17, 1998, Victory Tilly made his racing debut at Solvalla, Stockholm. As the favourite of a race for trotters 3 or 4 years old, he won by 4 and ¬Ω length. In his debut, as well as in all but one of his other races during his 3-year-old season, he was driven by Torbj√∂rn Jansson. On October 4, Victory Tilly took part in the biggest event for Swedish 3-year- olds, the Swedish Trotting Criterium (Svenskt Travkriterium), at Solvalla. The gelding broke stride and finished 6th behind, among others, future star Gidde Palema. During November and December, the horse won three fairly big races, his total earnings to US$173,278. Out of 13 races, Victory Tilly won 8.Victory Tilly won 1,264,000 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. =1999 - 4 years old= Victory Tilly continued to win in early 1999. In connection to the third win of the year, at Solvalla on February 24, a routine doping test was made. After the analyze of the sample, it was revealed that it showed traces of the prohibited substances caffeine and theophylline. Victory Tilly's owner and breeder Hans-Gunnar Tillander of Stall Tilly got hugely disappointed by this affair and, as a consequence, opted to sell all his racing horses. Before the sale, in the last race for trainer Norman, Victory Tilly and Torbj√∂rn Jansson, as heavy favourites, failed to win the major 4-year-old race Konung Gustaf V:s Pokal after being disturbed into galloping. The new owners, Stall Kalas (English: approximately \\"Party Stables\\"), who paid SEK3,500,000 (ca US$420,000 at the time) for the gelding, engaged Stig H. Johansson as new trainer of the horse. Victory Tilly made his debut for Johansson on the Elitloppet Day. Together with Torbj√∂rn Jansson, who was hired as a stand-in driver since Johansson was suspended, Victory Tilly won on the new Swedish record 1:11.8 (km rate, European style of keeping time). Victory Tilly, along with trainer Johansson in the sulky, won the rest of the races he participated in that year. The biggest win of the year was in the Swedish Trotting Derby, Svenskt Travderby, the richest and most prestigious event for 4-year-olds in Sweden. From gate one, Victory Tilly and Johansson went to the front, where they remained the entire race. Of the SEK1,300,000 gained through the win, Stall Kalas donated 500,000 to the Swedish Cancer Society (Cancerfonden). Later in the autumn, Victory Tilly won another major race, the Swedish Breeders Crown for 4-year-old stallions and geldings. 16 races at age four meant 14 victories, and Victory Tilly earned US$520,108 during the year.He won 3,794,000 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. =2000 - 5 years old= In the first year competing against the domestic and foreign aged elite, Victory Tilly claimed many of Sweden's major events. Before that, he won Norway's biggest race, Oslo Grand Prix, on May 14. Success in Elitloppet Stig H. Johannson and Victory Tilly wins the 2000 Elitloppet. Two weeks later, in Elitloppet at their home track Solvalla, Johansson and Victory Tilly faced foreign stars like Italian Varenne and French G√©n√©ral du Pommeau, the reigning Prix d'Am√©rique champion. Victory Tilly and Johansson won their elimination despite starting from post seven. In the subsequent final, just as in the elimination, Victory Tilly went to the front out of the gate. G√©n√©ral du Pommeau was placed outside in first over. Meanwhile, favourite Varenne galloped shortly. The two horses in the front kept the pace up all through the race, and none of the other contenders posed a threat. Victory Tilly defeated his French opponent, and driver/trainer Johansson threw his whip into the air out of joy as the finish line was crossed and many of the 32,000 attending celebrated. Victory Tilly's 1:53.2 (1:10.5 km rate) mark was a new all-age world record for geldings trotting on a five-eighths of a mile track. After the race, Johansson said that this possibly was the best race ever by a Swedish trotter and that Victory Tilly was the best trotter he had ever trained or driven. Other than finishing as runner-up in √Örj√§ng in July, the gelding kept winning. During the following months, he won major Swedish races like Hugo √Öbergs Memorial at J√§gersro, Jubileumspokalen at Solvalla, Sundsvall Open Trot at Bergs√•ker, and √Öby Stora Pris at √Öby. In total, Victory Tilly won US$1,366,182 and 12 of 14 entered races in 2000.He won 9,965,805 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. He was awarded the Swedish Horse of the Year Award for his efforts. =2001 - 6 years old= In May, Victory Tilly and Johansson failed to repeat the previous year's successes in both Oslo Grand Prix and Elitloppet. In Oslo, they finished fourth after a race in the pocket position. In Elitloppet, they ended up third, even though they reached their much-preferred front position early. Italian Varenne ran as parker but had no problem cruising to victory down the stretch. The summer of 2001 brought victories in Copenhagen Cup, Jubileumspokalen, and Sundsvall Open Trot. In October, Victory Tilly competed outside Scandinavia for the first time, when he won Gran Premio Gaetano Turilli at Tor di Valle, Rome. The gelding returned to Italy a few weeks later to win Gran Premio delle Nazioni at San Siro, Milan. At this occasion, Victory Tilly was accompanied by old acquaintance Torbj√∂rn Jansson, since Stig H. Johansson was unavailable due to vacation. Nine wins out of 16 during the year brought US$887,929.Victory Tilly won 6,477,125 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. =2002 - 7 years old= To compete in his first major event of 2002, Victory Tilly again travelled to Italy. The major international race at Agnano, Gran Premio della Lotteria, ended with the gelding in third, behind Varenne and Legendary Lover K. After finishing fourth in Elitloppet, three victories in native Sweden followed before Victory Tilly travelled to the USA. Racing in the US=Breeders Crown= Even though they were not certain the gelding would make it in time to race in the Breeders Crown at Meadowlands, Victory Tilly's connections paid the US$80,000 required to enter the event. If eliminations had been required a week before the final to decrease the number of contestants, the money would have been of no use. Fortunately for the owners, few enough trotters entered the race, and Victory Tilly could compete in the final. From the eighth post position, Stig H. Johansson guided Victory Tilly to the front. Fool's Goal passed the Swedish guest and during the latter part of the race, Victory Tilly was positioned in first over. Fool's Goal won the US$1 million event and Victory Tilly came in fourth, beaten by Plesac and Danish Delight as well. =Nat Ray - world record= Stig H. Johansson and Victory Tilly wins the 2002 Nat Ray Trot at the Meadowlands Racetrack. A week later, on August 3, Victory Tilly avenged the loss. In the $500,000 Nat Ray, he defeated, among others, Fool's Goal and Plesac. The mark 1:50.4 (1:08.9 km rate) was a new world record, beating Varenne's race record and Pine Chip's time-trial record with seven and six tenths of a second, respectively. The record was a valid mark for all trotters until Tom Ridge, guided by driver Ron Pierce, broke it in September 2004 by winning the World Trotting Derby in 1:50.2. Victory Tilly's mark is still a valid world record for all-age geldings. Back in Sweden, Victory Tilly claimed Sundsvall Open Trot at Bergs√•ker for a third consecutive time. He won √Öby Stora Pris and Frances Bulwark's Race at Solvalla before going to Italy to defend his title in Gran Premio delle Nazioni at San Siro, Milan. From the front, Victory Tilly and Johansson made it back-to-back victories in the event. During 2002, the trotter entered 16 races, winning 12 of them. Moneywise, it was, by a narrow margin, the best year of his career. Victory Tilly earned US$1,382,625 that year.He won 10,085,751 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. For the second time, he was awarded the Swedish Horse of Year Award. =2003 - 8 years old= Similar to the previous year, Johansson let Victory Tilly enter a few smaller races in the spring before making a trip to Agnano, Naples, and make a second attempt to claim the prestigious Gran Premio della Lotteria. After a successful fight for the front position with Legendary Lover K., the Swedish gelding could not be caught, and the winner's purse, consisting of US$230,000, was Victory Tilly's. Elitloppet and the injury Three weeks later, Victory Tilly and his connections were in place at Solvalla Racetrack, Stockholm, to make a fourth effort to win Elitloppet. A win in the elimination meant a good post position in the final. Nevertheless, Swedish From Above claimed the title while Victory Tilly finished second, one length behind. Shortly after the race, reports came that Victory Tilly had been injured. The horse was taken to a veterinary clinic, and severe damage to his right hind suspensory was diagnosed. Trainer/driver Johansson stated that the healing process would take at least six months and that there even a risk that Victory Tilly would never return to the track. There was a plan to again travel over the Atlantic to face North America's top trotters in July and August, but the trip was cancelled. Part of Victory Tilly's medical treatment was to keep him in good shape without stressing his injured leg. This was done by swimming in a lake. In the abruptly ended racing year of 2003, Victory Tilly won US$448,852 and four races in six attempts.He won 3,274,217 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. =2004 - 9 years old= On April 7, Victory Tilly returned to the tracks for a qualifying race. At √Öby Racetrack, on April 29, he made his competitive comeback, 11 months after getting injured in Elitloppet. He returned to his winning ways immediately, and Johansson was happy with his performance. After losing as big favourites at Dannero a couple of weeks later, they ruled out Elitloppet. Victory Tilly claimed J√§mtlands Stora Pris and a couple of smaller events but failed to earn a single krona in the bigger races Sundsvall Open Trot and √Öby Stora Pris in August and September. The leg problems recurred, which made Johansson end the campaign. The eight races of the year meant four wins and US$131,603 in prize money.Victory Tilly won 960,000 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. =2005 - 10 years old= Now ten years old, Victory Tilly began the 2005 racing at Mantorp on May 16. Although a heavy favourite, he finished second. Johansson was, nonetheless, pleased, and spoke about possibly entering the Breeders Crown later that year. This was not to be, however, since Victory Tilly picked up another injury to his leg. This time, it kept him off the tracks for four months. When he returned after the latest setback, the gelding did it at Eskilstuna by claiming the easiest victory of his career, according to trainer/driver Johansson. Johansson admitted that Victory Tilly probably never would return to his past heights because of the injuries and age. On November 26 at Kalmar Racetrack, Victory Tilly and Johansson won the veteran driver's 1000th victory in the rikstoto, a weekly series of races in Sweden. Reaching the milestone together with a horse that close to his heart was \\"almost too much\\", as Johansson put it. In Victory Tilly's second last competitive year, the gelding earned another US$57,165 in seven races, of which four were won.He won 417,000 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. =2006 - 11 years old= Victory Tilly's final year on the track started with a couple of smaller domestic races. Johansson then took the gelding to the Forus Racetrack to compete in the major Norwegian event Forus Open. Together with new driver Erik Adielsson (Johansson had quit driving in the end of 2005), the star won in a comfortable way after favourite Steinlager went off-stride. Johansson afterwards admitted himself tempted to take part in Elitloppet once more. Four weeks later, Victory Tilly raced in the big one-mile race. However, Adielsson and the gelding had no success in the eliminations, as French Jag de Bellouet interfered with them. At √ñstersund, on June 10, Victory Tilly raced for the last time. Guided by Adielsson, he won the event J√§mtlands Stora Pris for the fourth time. During the summer, he was again injured in a hind leg. In October, the gelding still had not shook off his problem. Stig H. Johansson and the owners decided to call it quits. The decision was made official on October 25. On December 30, Victory Tilly was honoured during a ceremony at Solvalla. During his last year on the tracks, Victory Tilly won three races out of six, which moneywise meant US$201,159 to add to his purse.He won 1,467,380 Swedish Kronor (SEK) during this year. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 2006-06-10, the date of his last race, have been used. At the time of his retirement, Victory Tilly had earned US$5,168,902, which made him the richest Swedish trotter ever. Life after racing Stig H. Johansson and Victory Tilly in 2003 When Stig H. Johansson in the summer of 2005 turned 60, Stall Kalas gave him Victory Tilly once the horse had retired. Thus, since retiring, Victory Tilly has spent his days at Johansson's farm Stora Alby outside Stockholm. In March 2007, Johansson announced that there were plans to build a Victory Tilly museum at Stora Alby, where guests can see, among other things, trophies and blankets, as well as visit Victory Tilly. Pedigree The paternal half of Victory Tilly's pedigree consists of American horses solely. He was sired by Quick Pay (1973‚Äì2000), an American stallion that was exported to Sweden in 1978. During his racing career, Quick Pay claimed the Kentucky Futurity and finished second in the Yonkers Trot. In 18 years as a breeding stallion, he sired more than 1,350 foals, 1,117 of which were born in Sweden. Victory Tilly, Lass Zefyr (winner of Breeders Crown and Momarken Grand Prix), Atas Fighter L. (winner of Gran Premio delle Nazioni, Finlandia-Ajo, Prix de France and International Trot), The Onion (winner of Elitloppet, Gran Premio della Lotteria and √Öby Stora Pris), Pay Nibs (winner of Campeonato Europeo and St. Michel Race), Lucky Po (winner of the Swedish Trotting Criterium and Konung Gustaf V:s Pokal), Born Quick (winner of the Finnish Trotting Criterium, the Finnish Trotting Derby and Finlandia-Ajo), Sacrifice (winner of Drottning Silvias Pokal) and Pay the Bill (winner of Stochampionatet) are some of the successful trotters Quick Pay sired. He received the title Swedish Elite Stallion and was himself by Star's Pride out of Spry Hanover. The dam Icora Tilly as well as grand dam Cikora Tilly, third dam Glenna H., and fourth dam Scotch Dot are all considered Elite Mares. Icora Tilly had some success on the tracks (runner-up in the Swedish Trotting Criterium as well as in Gran Premio d'Europa) and as a broodmare, she gave birth to SEK-millionaires Brunton Tilly, Super Tilly and Golden Tilly. The total domination of French horses on Icora Tilly's paternal side, makes Victory Tilly one quarter French, pedigree wise.

He belonged to the Baradu Hindu military clan, and was captured by the Delhi army during Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Malwa in 1305. After being brought to Delhi as a slave, he converted to Islam, and became a homosexual partner of Alauddin's son Mubarak Shah. After ascending the throne in 1316, Mubarak Shah gave him the title \\"Khusrau Khan\\", and greatly favoured him. Khusrau Khan led a successful campaign to reassert Delhi's control over Devagiri in 1317. The next year, he led an army that besieged Warangal, forcing the Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra to resume tribute payments to Delhi. In 1320, he led a group of Baradus and disgruntled nobles to assassinate Mubarak Shah, and ascended the throne with the regnal name Nasiruddin. However, he was soon deposed by a group of rebels led by the noble Malik Tughluq, who succeeded him on the throne.  Early life  According to the Delhi chronicler Amir Khusrau, Khusrau Khan and his brother belonged to a Hindu military caste or group called Baradu. In 1305, during the reign of Alauddin Khalji, they were captured when the Delhi forces led by Ayn al-Mulk Multani conquered Malwa in central India. They were brought as slaves to Delhi, where they converted to Islam, and were named Hasan (later Khusrau Khan) and Husamuddin (or Hisamuddin). They were brought up by Alauddin's naib-i khas-i hajib Malik Shadi. The two brothers acted as passive homosexuals to maintain their status and position. Alauddin's son Mubarak Shah fell in love with Hasan: he preferred Hasan as a homosexual partner, but turned to Husamuddin whenever Hasan was not available. Their relationship was not a secret, and Mubarak and Hasan used to exchange hugs and kisses in public. After Alauddin's death in 1316, his slave-general Malik Kafur appointed the minor prince Shihabuddin Omar as a puppet ruler. Shortly after, Malik Kafur was killed, and Shihabuddin's half brother Mubarak Shah usurped the throne. Mubarak Shah gave Hasan the title Khusrau Khan, with the former fief of Malik Kafur. Within a year, Khusrau Khan was promoted to the post of vazir. According to the chornicler Barani, Mubarak Shah became \\"so enamored by Hasan ... that he did not want to be parted from him for a moment.\\" Mubarak Shah appointed Khusrau Khan's brother Husamuddin as the governor of Gujarat. Husamuddin later became an apostate (from Islam), because of which the local nobles of Gujarat arrested him, and brought him to Delhi in chains. However, Mubarak Shah merely slapped him, and gave him a high position in the royal court.  Military career under Mubarak Shah  The Yadavas of Devagiri, who had become tributaries to Delhi during Alauddin's reign, asserted their independence after Malik Kafur's death. After consolidating his rule in Delhi, Mubarak Shah led a campaign to Devagiri in 1317, forcing the Yadava leader Harapala-deva and his prime minister Raghava to flee. Khusrau Khan, along with Malik Qutlugh, led an army to pursue them. The Delhi forces completely routed Raghava's army. Khusrau Khan then dispatched a force led by Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Talbagha to pursue Harapaladeva, who was later captured and beheaded. Another tributary, the Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra, stopped making tribute payments to Delhi after Alauddin's death. In 1318, Mubarak Shah sent an army led by Khusrau Khan, Malik Qutlugh, and Khwaja Haji to besieged Warangal, the capital of Prataparudra. Prataparudra surrendered, and agreed to make regular tribute payments. After this victory, Khusrau Khan marched to Ellora, where Mubarak Shah had been residing for a month. The rest of the army joined him on the banks of the Narmada River on his way back to Delhi.  Assassination of Mubarak Shah  Chronicler Ziauddin Barani writes that Khusrau Khan resented \\"the way the Sultan forced himself upon him and took advantage of him\\", and secretly planned revenge against him. Mubarak's other subordinates warned him about Khusrau's treacherous plans, but while being sodomized by the Sultan, Khusrau convinced him that the accusers were falsely slandering him. Khusrau Khan also convinced Mubarak Shah to allow him to raise an army of Baradu Hindus by arguing that all other nobles (maliks) had their own groups of followers. He enlisted several soldiers at Bahilwal (near Mount Abu and in the province of Gujarat. According to Tughluq Nama, this army included 10,000 Baradu horsemen, and was commanded by several Hindu chiefs (rais and ranas). Next, Khusrau Khan contacted officers who resented Sultan Mubarak Shah, and conspired with them to kill the Sultan in the royal palace. He told the Sultan that he wanted his men to be granted access to the palace, so that they could meet him without requiring him to leave the Sultan's company. The Sultan obliged, and subsequently, every night 300-400 Baradus started entering the palace. They assembled in the former chambers of Malik Kafur on the ground floor of the palace, which had been assigned to Khusrau Khan. On 7 May 1320, Qazi Ziyauddin, a teacher of the Sultan, suggested an investigation into the assembly of the Baradus. However, the Sultan angrily dismissed the suggestion, and none of the nobles dared to make a similar suggestion. Barani claims when the Sultan told Mubarak Shah about Qazi Ziyauddin's suggestion, Mubarak Shah won over his confidence by making love with him. On the night of 9 July 1320, Qazi Ziyauddin visited the ground floor of the palace to supervise the palace guard. Randhol, the maternal uncle of Khusrau Khan, entered the palace with a large number of Baradus, who hid daggers under their clothes. When Ziyauddin let his guard down to accept a paan (betel leaf preparation) from Randhol, the Baradu leader Jaharya stabbed him to death. The Sultan, who was in the company of Khusrau Khan on the upper floor, heard the commotion caused by Ziyauddin's murder. However, Khusrau Khan told him that the royal horses had broken loose, and the noise was caused by the guards trying to catch the animals. Meanwhile, Jaharya and other Baradus entered the upper floor, and killed the Sultan's special guards - Ibrahim and Ishaq. The Sultan now realized that a rebellion was happening against him, and tried to escape to his harem, which was located a floor above. However, Khusrau Khan stopped him by seizing his hair. The Sultan knocked Khusrau Khan to the ground, and sat on his chest, but Khusrau Khan did not let go of his hair. Meanwhile, Jaharya arrived at the scene, stuck a patta (axe) at the Sultan's chest, lifted him up by his hair, and threw him to the ground. He then beheaded the Sultan, and the head was later thrown in the courtyard on the ground floor. The Baradus massacred the palace residents, while the royal guards fled to save their lives. To eliminate any possible claimants to the thorne, the Baradus then entered the royal harem. They asked for the surviving sons of Alauddin to be produced before them, declaring that they intended to install one of the princes on the throne, and the others as provincial governors. The mothers of the princes did not believe the Baradus, and tried to hide them. However, the Baradus found the princes, and killed the eldest among them - Farid Khan (15 years) and Abu Bakr Khan (14 years) - after allowing them to say their final prayers. They also killed Mubarak Shah's mother Jhatyapali. They blinded three other sons of Alauddin - Bahauddin Khan (8 years), Ali Khan (8 years), and Usman Khan (5 years); these princes were imprisoned at the Red Palace (Qasr-i Lal). According to the 16th century writer Firishta, even Malik Nusrat - who had renounced royal life to become a dervish - was killed, because he was the son of a sister of Alauddin.  Reign = Accession = Khusrau Khan initially planned to install a son of the deceased Sultan on the throne as a puppet ruler. However, his advisors suggested that a prince would have him killed after his accession, and therefore, he decided to claim the throne himself. After killing the Sultan and potential claimants to the throne, the conspirators persuaded or compelled the various nobles to come to the first floor of the royal palace at midnight, and accept Khusrau Khan as the new king. According to Barani, the following nobles were held as \\"hostages\\" at midnight: Ayn al-Mulk Multani, Wahiduddin Quraishi, Bahauddin Dabir, and three sons of Malik Qara Beg. No information is available about the discussions between the conspirators and the nobles, but by the sunrise, all the nobles at the palace had accepted Khusrau Khan's accession to the throne as Sultan Nasiruddin. Shortly after ascending the throne, Khusrau Khan married the widow of Mubarak Shah. This marriage was declared invalid after Khusrau Khan was deposed, as according to the Muslim law, the widow could re-marry only when four menstruation periods had passed after her husband's death. = Administration = Khusrau Khans officers included the following men, many of whom had served Alauddin: * Tajul Mulk Malik Wahiduddin Quraishi was re-appointed as the wazir; he died or retired soon after, when the post of wazir was given to Ayn al-Mulk Multani * Malik Ayn al-Mulk Multani was given the title Alimul mulk * Malik Hasan, Malik Hussain, and Malik Badruddin Abu Bakr - the sons of Malik Qara Beg - were given the offices of their father. * Malik Fakhruddin Jauna, a son of Tughluq, was given the office of akhur-bek * Shaista Khan, a co-conspirator and a son of Muhammad Qirat Qimar, was appointed the minister of war * Yusuf Sahi, another co-conspirator, was given the title of Sufi Khan and appointed as a counseller * Malik Tamar was appointed as the governor of Chanderi * Kamaluddin Sufi * Kafur Muhrdar was given the post of amir-i hajib * Shihab was given the post of naib-i amir-i hajib * Tigin was appointed as the governor of Awadh * Bahauddin Dabir was given the title Azam-ul Mulk, and re- appointed as the minister of the secretariat, a post that he held during Alauddin's reign * Sumbul Hatim Khan * Malik Yak Lakkhi Qadr Khan (not to be confused with Yak Lakkhi, the governor of Devagiri and Samana) * Ambar Bughra Khan * Talbagha, son of Yaghda * Talbagha Nagauri * Saif Chaush * Malik Qabul, who had been given the post of shuhna-i manda by Alauddin * Ahmad Ayaz, the kotwal of Siri, and his son Muhammad Ayaz The Baradus do not appear to have been granted any important posts in Khusrau Khan's government, presumably because they were illiterate. However, several of them appear to have been rewarded with titles, cash grants, and military commands. For example: * Husamuddin, the younger brother of Khusrau Khan, was given the title Khan-i Khanan * Randhol, an uncles of Khusrau Khan, was given the title Rai Rayan; he was also given the house and wealth of Qazi Ziyauddin * Two other uncles of the new Sultan - probably Nag and Kajb Brahma - were given the highest commands in the Baradu contingent * Jaharya, the murderer of the preceding sultan, was given pearls and diamonds = Religion = Barani portrays the killing of Mubarak Shah as a Hindu-Muslim conflict. He claims that 5-6 days after Khusrau Khan's ascension to the throne, the Baradus and other Hindus started idol worship in the palace, and would sit on Quran. The Baradus obtained control of the houses of the former Muslim nobles, along with their women and slave-girls. The Hindus rejoiced at Khusrau Khan's ascension, hoping to weaken the Muslims, and make Delhi a Hindu-majority city again. However, Barani's narrative is unreliable, and contradicted by more reliable sources. Khusrau Khan wished to be seen as a normal Muslim monarch, and had the khutba in the mosques read in his name. Apart from Qazi Ziyauddin, whose wife and child had run away after his killing, the Baradus did not seize houses of Muslim nobles, many of whom were appointed to regular government posts under Khusrau.  Overthrow  Ghazi Malik Tughluq, the governor of Dipalpur refused to acknowledge Khusrau Khan's ascension. However, realizing the enemy's military strength, he did not take any immediate steps to oppose the ascension. Tughluq's son Fakhruddin Jauna, who held the office of akhur-bek in Khusrau Khan's government, was not happy with the regime at Delhi. He convened a secret meeting of his friends, and on their advice, sought help from his father to overthrow Khusrau Khan. On the advice of his father, Fakhruddin Jauna left Delhi with some companions. When Khusrau Khan came to know about the conspiracy, he dispatched his minister of war Shaista Khan in pursuit of Fakhruddin, but the royal army was unable to capture the rebels. Tughluq then sought support from five neighbouring governors: * Bahram, the governor of Uchch, joined Tughluq's cause and provided military support. * Mughlati, the governor of Multan, refused to join Tughluq, and was killed by Tughluq's friend Bahram Siraj. His army did not join Tughluq's forces. * Malik Yak Lakkhi, the governor of Samana, informed Khusrau Khan about Tughluq's letter, and unsuccessfully invaded Dipalpur. He later retreated to Samana, and was killed by a group of angry citizens. * Muhammad Shah Lur, the governor of Sindh, agreed to support Tughluq, but reached Delhi only after Tughluq ascended the throne. * Hushang Shah, the governor of Jalor, also promised to support Tughluq, but deliberately reached Delhi only after the battle between the forces of Tughluq and Khusrau Khan was over. Tughluq also sent a letter to Khusrau Khan's wazir (prime minister) Ayn al-Mulk Multani. Multani was surrounded by Khusrau Khan's men when he received the letter, so he took the letter to the Sultan and expressed his loyalty. However, when Tughuq sent a second message to him, he expressed sympathy with Tughluq's cause, although refused to directly support Tughluq because he was surrounded by Khusrau Khan's allies. As Tughluq raised a bigger army, and gained more support, Khusrau Khan's counselors advised him to take steps to prevent any further conspiracies and eliminate potential claimants to the throne. Accordingly, Khusrau Khan ordered killings of Alauddin's three sons - Bahauddin, Ali, and Usman - who had earlier been blinded and imprisoned. Tughluq's army defeated Khusrau Khan's forces at the Battle of Saraswati and the Battle of Lahrawat. Khusrau Khan fled from the battlefield, but was captured and killed a few days later. According to Amir Khusrau, Mubarak Shah was murdered on 9 July 1320 and Tughluq ascended the throne on 6 September 1320. This implies that Khusrau Khan held the throne for less than two months. However, 14th century chronicler Isami states that Khusrau Khan reigned for \\"two or three\\" months. Barani also suggests that Khusrau Khan ruled for more than two months, when he states that Fakhruddin Jauna fled from Delhi 2¬Ω months after the Sultan's ascension.

The performance was broadcast on Hear and Now on BBC Radio 3 on 16 June and is available for download from NMC Recordings http://www.nmcrec.co.uk The second performance took place at the Purcell Room, South Bank Centre London on 15 July 2012, as part of the New Music 20x12 Weekend Celebration http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/music/classical/tickets/emily-howard- zatopek-65778 The composer of Zatopek Emily Howard describes how the opera was created in an interview with the PRS for New Music Foundation http://www.prsformusicfoundation.com/Partnerships/Flagship-Programmes/New- Music-20x12/Meet-the-New-Music-20x12-Composers/Emily-Howard A review of the first performance in the Liverpool Echo.http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo- entertainment/2012/06/16/review-race-against-time-including-emily-howard-s- zatopek-at-the-epstein-theatre-100252-31194872/ was enthusiastic: ‚Äú Zatopek! ‚Ä¶..is as unreservedly entertaining as the man it pays tribute to. That comes partly from the score, performed last night by Ensemble 10/10 relegated to the pit at the (N)Epstein, partly from the singers from opera company Second Movement, who built up a sweat performing in singlets and shorts Chariots of Fire style, and partly from the simple but effective visuals of the staging ‚Äì ‚Äù The reviewer in The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/18/zatopek-review commented : ‚ÄúHoward's score captures Z√°topek's oddball personality by setting him at a slight harmonic variant with the rest of the field. Selma Dimitrijevic's libretto evokes a military chorus, a love duet with his javelin-throwing wife Dana (herself an Olympic champion) and a tipsy, beer-hall song of celebration; all in slightly less time than it took Z√°topek to complete 12-and-a-half laps. Intelligent use of projection gives Danielle Urbas's production a sense of grainy newsreel footage. Ensemble 10/10 present a meticulous rendering of the score's fluid, dream-like structure under Clark Rundell; and John McMunn's Z√°topek shows an admirable ability to execute a punishing, high-lying tenor role while performing press-ups and jogging on the spot.‚Äù Paul Morley reviewed the London performance on BBC 2‚Äôs The Review Show on 20 July 2012.

He has worked in several popular and acclaimed films as a cinematographer. Some of his award-winning films include 1942 A Love Story, Devdas, Rang De Basanti, Mission Kashmir, and Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.. Biography Binod grew up in the picturesque hill town of Kalimpong, West Bengal. Coming from a humble Gorkha Newar background, Binod got his first box camera in the early years from his father, H. K. Pradhan, who ran a photo studio. The love affair with camera started from thereon. Binod would shoot black-and-white pictures and try and colour them using water-paints. He was often caught shooting unknown portraits and making prints of them. Displeased at first, his father recognized his work and most of Binod's images landed up on the display case of the studio and he was rewarded with an Asahi Pentax. Binod and his camera were pretty much inseparable and by the age of 14, he was running things at the studio. Soon found the isolated life at Kalimpong was a hindrance for taking up photography as a career option. There was no formal forum to learn new techniques and share his experience. On hearing about FTII in Pune, he approached the institute with his portfolio and was admitted into a three-year course in cinematography. The break into films came when film director Prem Sagar came to the institute to judge the students' work. Impressed with Binod's work, Prem Sagar immediately offered him the job of an assistant at Sagar Arts. He went on to assist Prem Sagar on the Dharam-Hema Malini starrers, Charas and Ram Bharose. Realizing that he was not making his identity in the huge industry, he started looking at other options. Ace cameraman A. K. Bir, who was working on a film Gharonda offered him the job of assistant cameraman, in charge of the zoom and focus department. This proved to be a very useful internship. Work soon dried up and he often found himself changing addresses very often. Few sporadic assignments like documentaries (for Durga Khote productions), ads and corporate films helped improve his technical skills. During this period, he lived with a Kutchi family and this was when he met Dolly. He fell in love with Dolly, and was unable to convince her parents. Resorting to desperate measures, he eloped with her back to Kalimpong. They soon had their first-born, Binay. Out-of-work Binod devoted himself completely to raising him. He also has a second son named Deep Pradhan . Slowly, old friends approached him with work assignments. He worked with Mani Kaul on the celluloid version of Ghashiram Kotwal and did Jabbar Patel's Jait Re Jait. The Assamese film Apa Roopa happened then. The dry spell finally broke when Kundan Shah started gathering all his mates from FTII for the film Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro. This film went on to reach cult status.

Purpose  It advocates and supports the provision of efficient, user-orientated and excellent library and information services that aspire to equitable access to information for all communities (literate and illiterate) in South Africa. It represents the interest of and promotes the development and image of library and information in South Africa, at local, provincial and national level to government and other agencies. LIASA also represents the LIS sector at international levels. LIASA's membership consists of individuals interested in or working in libraries and information services and institutions or organizations that maintain or are interested in libraries and information services. Today LIASA has nearly 1600 members and is nationally and internationally acknowledged and recognised as the professional association. The Association is divided into 10 branches that reside in each province in the country with two based in Gauteng. The Association is governed by a Representative Council elected by its members. An Executive Committee consisting of elected officials are mandated by the Council to implement its policies and programmes. The Executive Committee's activities are guided by a strategic plan that is revised every 4 years. The LIASA National Office is located on the Pretoria campus of the National Library of South Africa (NLSA). History The Library and Information Association of South Africa (LIASA) was launched on 10 July 1997. The launch marked the end of the process of unification of all existing library organisations in South Africa. This process was initiated in January 1995 at the Conference on Libraries and Information Services in Developing South Africa (LISDESA), which was an initiative of the two largest existing organisations at the time, the South African Institute for Librarianship and Information Science (SAILIS) and the African Library Association of South Africa (ALASA). It was at LISDESA that the first Steering Committee for the Unification of Library and Information Stakeholders (ULIS) was elected and given the mandate to carry forward the process for a new organisation. At the ULIS-1 conference, held in July 1996 in Johannesburg, an Interim Executive Committee (IEC) was elected and mandated to draft a constitution for discussion by all the stakeholders. The IEC, supported by the Provincial Support Groups (PSGs) representing all nine provinces in the country, arranged the Constituent Conference (aka ULIS-2) at the University of Pretoria in July 1997. Approximately four hundred and fifty library and information workers representing all nine provinces in South Africa attended the Constituent Conference. The primary focus was to debate and approve the draft constitution. All delegates were given the opportunity to discuss and propose amendments. On the final morning the final edited draft of the constitution was presented and accepted unanimously. The delegates also voted for the name of the new organisation. A Transitional Executive Committee (TEC) was elected to manage the Association, to prepare for the election of the first Representative Council, and to organise the first annual conference, which took place in November 1998. Of significant note, the acronym LIASA, pronounced as \\"liyasa\\", in the Nguni languages, means \\"the dawning\\". Peter Johan Lor, former State Librarian and IFLA Secretary General, is listed as the very first LIASA member.  Structure  The Representative Council is made up of the five elected officials (President, President-Elect, Secretary, Treasurer and Public Relations Officer), the Chairs and Chairs-Elect of the LIASA Branches, Chairs of the Interest Groups, as well as the Editors of LIASA-in-Touch (the official magazine) and the South African Journal of Libraries and Information Science (SAJLIS). The Executive Committee is made up the five elected officials and four additional Representative Council members. Elections are held every two years and each portfolio is held for a two-year term. Branches: The Library and Information Association of South Africa has 10 branches one in every province and two in Gauteng. Each branch has a committee elected from its paid-up members. Every branch arranges its own meetings and functions, and compiles its own constitution in alignment with the LIASA constitution. Interest Groups: LIASA has 10 Interest Groups that serve as platforms for membership discussions that cover various areas of interest and specialisation. Members may choose to belong to two (2) Interest Groups at the time of registration. A national meeting of each Interest Group is convened at the annual LIASA Conference. Several Interest Groups have organised pre- conferences at the annual conference, which have exposed members to further training and skills development by experts in the field.  International Achievements  IFLA, the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, of which LIASA is a member organisation, invites bids from different countries to host its annual World Library and Information Congress and Assembly. It attracts approximately 3500 international delegates to this annual congress. * IFLA 2007 ‚Äì While still a young organisation in comparison to other library associations (see the List of Library Associations), LIASA won the bid to hold the 73rd IFLA General Congress and Council in Durban, South Africa in 2007. * IFLA/WLIC 2015 ‚Äì LIASA was awarded the bid to host the 2015 IFLA World Library and Information Congress in Cape Town, South Africa.  Annual Conference  The LIASA Conference is held annually during September or October, and since 2011 the Conference rotates between the cities of Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg/Pretoria. This Conference serves as an opportunity for LIASA members to showcase best practices; learn about national and international trends; and meet experts.  South African Library Week (SALW)  In 2001 LIASA was tasked with the responsibility of initiating a week during which all types of libraries across the country raise the profile of libraries and market their services in an effort to contribute to the understanding of the important role that libraries play in a democratic society, advancing literacy, making the basic human right of freedom of access to information a reality, and to promote tolerance and respect among all South Africans. After extensive research into the history of libraries in South Africa and consultation with the membership the following proposal was accepted: \\"That the week within which 20 March falls should be national library Week. In the event of this day failing within a weekend, then the week preceding it would be celebrated as national Library Week.\\" This is in recognition of the establishment of the first public library by a government proclamation on 20 March 1818, the South African Public Library, now known as the National Library of South Africa (Cape Town Campus). Furthermore, Human Rights Day is celebrated on 21 March and the South African Bill of Rights recognizes and upholds the freedom of access to information as a basic human right. The linking of an important historical event with a crucial date in this new democracy received wide acceptance.  Presidents  The President of LIASA serves a two-year period, and may be re-elected for office. The following is a list of the current and past presidents of the association: * 2018 - 2020 Nikki Crowster * 2016 - 2018 Mandla Ntombela * 2014 - 2016 Segametsi Molawa * 2012 - 2014 Ujala Satgoor * 2010 - 2012 Naomi Haasbroek * 2008 - 2010 Rachel More * 2006 - 2008 Tommy Matthee * 2004 - 2006 Tommy Matthee * 2002 - 2004 Robert Moropa * 2000 - 2002 Ellen Tise * 1998 - 2000 Ellen Tise  Publications  LIASA has two official publications, namely: #The South African Journal of Libraries and Information Science (SAJLIS), an open access, peer reviewed and accredited journal, is published twice per year. #Its official magazine, LIASA-in-Touch, is published four times per year.

In Albania it is mainly danced by Cham Albanians. The dance bears the name of Osman Taka, a 19th-century Muslim Cham Albanian guerilla fighter who fought against Ottoman forces. It is a famous variation from the Albanian Cham repertoire of the older √áam√ße dance. Background Osman Taka was jailed in Yanina and was sentenced to death. When he was asked to give his final wish, he wanted to dance. The folk tradition says that his dance was so beautiful that the local Albanian gendarmes of the Ottoman army, did not execute him. After some days he was caught again and was killed in Konispol while fighting against Ottoman authorities .Anamali, Sk√´nder and Prifti, Kristaq. Historia e popullit shqiptar n√´ kat√´r v√´llime. Botimet Toena, 2002, . Performance Osman Taka Dance The dance follows a strict tempo with emphasis in the \\"attitude, style and grace\\" of the dancer. It is a meter with steps \\"slow- quick-quick\\". The dance is a row dance, with a lead dancer performing skillfully executed steps. He then drops to his knees, arches his back and extends his chest upward, forming a bridge. The other dancers then step forward onto the lead dancer's stomach and dance on top of his stomach. The dancers hold each other from the hands, bend 90 degrees upwards at the elbows. It takes a sturdy hand, especially if you are supporting the first or last person of the line. This symbolizes the strength and centrality of the lead dancer as he forms a bridge with his body for the other men to cross over. In Albania and Greece The dance is part of the repertoire of Epirote music in Greece and of the Cham music in Albania. \\"In the case of a dance known in Southern Albania as \\"dance of Osman Taka\\" and in northern Greece as \\"Tsamiko. [23]\\"... Footnote \\"[23] In some parts of northern Greece also termed \\"Osman Taka\\" and Samantaka.\\"; p. 375. The Dance of Osman Taka is a Cham dance well known throughout Albania and has been performed at some number of national occasions. =Albania= The dance is performed alongside instrumental accompaniment of lute, violin, tambourine with clarinet alongside vocals. It is famous variation from the Albanian Cham repertoire of the older √áam√ße dance. =Greece= In Greece the dance is called \\"Osmantakas\\" or \\"Samantakas\\" and it is danced in Epirus. It is one of nine basic dancing genres (the other being Tsamikos, Syrtos in 3 steps, Syrtos in 2 steps, Pogonisios, Zagorisios, Kleftes, Fezodervenagas, Berati) of Epirus. The Osmantakas dancing genre has its distinct dancing style, it's exclusively danced in the correspondent song and it's not to be confused with any other dancing genre in Epirus. Apart from the traditional 8-measure motif, today it is also performed in a 4-measure motif, very similar to the Pogonios. In the typical fashion in the music of Epirus the specific song may sometimes be interrupted at the end and end up in Syrtos or Tsamikos rhythm. A general classification of the dancing genres in Zagori region of Epirus can classify Osmanatakas, as well as the Berati, Kleftes, Perdikomata, as variations of Tsamiko. This dance is supposed to have been the dance of the Souliotes.

Situated in Banbridge, Northern Ireland it has been weaving since 1854. The Company, bears the name of its founder, Thomas Ferguson (1820‚Äì1900), who was born at Clare, near the village of Waringstown in Co. Down. They are almost exclusively weavers of linen fabrics, made from yarns spun from 100% flax fibre. These fabrics are made up into luxury household linens and gifts, such as napery, bed linen, traditional lettered tea towels, etc., by Thomas Ferguson and others who purchase their fabrics. In early 2012 Thomas Ferguson developed a range of exclusive apparel fabrics. Most were made from Irish linen, but some were wool. Thomas Ferguson & Co Ltd were always one of the smaller, but more specialist, Irish linen weavers. They specialised in finer linens, and bespoke weaving, sometimes of only one custom sized tablecloth, or the weaving-in of the customers own family crest, company logo or special design. They set up their weaving plant to allow them to commercially deal with this type of small order, whilst the larger companies produced volume and went for big hotel contracts, or the like. The top end, and custom work, that Thomas Ferguson's specialised in became more what individual customers wanted as the industry came under more and more pressure from low cost countries. Larger contracts were squeezed out to the low cost producers, but the quality custom work that Ferguson's concentrated on largely remained as this involved smaller orders and generally 'fell under the radar' of the larger producers in the low cost countries. They are a member of the Irish Linen Guild. Since 1988 it has been part of the Franklins Group of companies. Since that time the Ferguson family has no longer been involved in the business. Tours are run of the factory to allow visitors to see Irish linen damask being woven. In 2012 John England (Banbridge) Ltd was brought under the same ownership as Thomas Ferguson. John England will widen the range offered into apparel, curtaining, upholstery and theatrical linens for film and stage productions.

The turf structure was sub-rectangular and contained a hearth surrounded by some paving. Pottery dating to no later than the 16th century was recovered from the interior. The enclosure was also constructed of turf. The full plan of the turf building was exposed during excavation. Due to the construction materials and nature of the building it had been greatly affected by soil processes from the time it went out of use to the present. The walls appeared to have been made from a mixture of turf and soil of local origin. Preservation was found to vary with the south end showing the best. Extensive slumping had occurred, and this combined with subsequent decay, made excavation difficult. The presence of charcoal and charred cereal grains within the walls suggested that material from earlier occupation may have been incorporated and the remains may have represented more than one structural phase. On the interior of the building the level of the floor was indicated by the hearth and some slabs. Elsewhere, the floor was likely to have been of beaten earth, which is no longer recognisable due to the mixing of soil.

In his attempt to get one up on his new nemesis, Rob decides to find Duncan's first love, Jo, and ask her to the wedding as his ‚Äòplus one‚Äô. However, he finds her in a coma, under the care of her mother who is hoping to raise money for her treatment by holding a fun run. In an attempt to impress Nicola Dare (Susie Amy) - his own first love - after having insulted her transgender brother, Rob decides to participate in the fun run himself. Doubting his ability to run 20 km, he plans to cut through the middle of the devised route. He turns up at the event with a cheque donating the greatest amount - most of which was put in from himself instead of sponsors - which earns him great popularity. However, while cutting through the middle of the route, he trips, hits his head on a log and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up with his shoes having been stolen by a tramp, and ends up getting kicked in the crotch by someone who assumes he is also homeless. A five-year- old girl catches him holding his groin in pain, and he proceeds to run to the end of the fun run, where the rest of the participants are awaiting his arrival to celebrate his generous donation. As he arrives, Duncan appears and provides a donation of ¬£17,000, making him the largest donor instead of Rob. Already frustrated, the parents of the five-year-old girl appear and accuse him of masturbating in front of a young girl, and he is chased further. *Episode 2: Black White and Red All Over T4 is featuring the buildup to Duncan and Linsey's wedding in reality show One Love. Rob feels he needs to find an impressive girl to have on his arm if he's to show his ex just what she has missed out on. Enter Rich - Rob's brother - and his girlfriend's sister, Abby (Sophie Winkleman); a gorgeous West End star who always has to have what she wants. In an attempt to secure her as his plus one, Rob agrees to go to a 'bad taste' fancy dress party with Abby, dressed as a panda. Before the party, she paints his face to resemble a panda, but ends up getting the colours the wrong way round. A car crash on the way leads to a nasty case of whiplash and Rob offending two paramedics with his facepaint. The paramedics call Linsey, who arrives at the hospital along with T4's Steve Jones, a million TV viewers and Duncan from Blue. Continuing to offend people with his accidentally racist facepaint, the episode ends with Duncan telling young children in the hospital how it's wrong to be racist and wondering why we all can't just get along. *Episode 3: See it in a Boys Lies Rich persuades Rob that he needs a model to accompany him to the wedding. Working in the music compilation industry by placing songs in a spreadsheet, he has access to beautiful models only through the means of his colleague Laura, who works in graphic design. He convinces her to set up a photoshoot with model Aimee, who becomes more and more attracted to him when Laura tells her all the celebrities he has allegedly worked with, including mentioning that Rob and Jamelia are 'practically best friends'. After the shoot, Rob fantasizes about kissing Laura on their desk and begins to see her in a different way. Aimee invites Rob and Laura to a club night, and notice Jamelia is at the same club. Aimee begs Rob to introduce them, leading to him pleading with Jamelia to go along with the story that they're friends. She goes along with it, grudgingly, and tells Aimee that he is a very talented breakdancer. Having to go along with this story to impress Aimee, he performs a dance routine and manages to impress Jamelia, Aimee and Laura. However, this is short-lived when he kicks Laura in the face and is thrown out of the club. He drives alongside her, trying to apologise, and is arrested for mistakenly trying to solicit sex with Laura whom they think is a prostitute. *Episode 4: The Competition Winner Rob decides the only way he can upstage Linsey and Duncan in their celebrity wedding magazine pictures is by taking a celebrity as his plus one. Spotting George Clooney's ex Lisa Snowdon across a crowded bar gives him an idea - however he needs a 'competition winner' to even have a chance at meeting her. His brother, Rich, offers his assistance with one of his pupils, Craig, who pretends to be disabled - for a price of money and video games - to get Rob in with Lisa. An allergic reaction to peanuts on Craig's part leads to Lisa having to leave the date early but scheduling a lunch appointment with Rob the next day. Rob tells her about Linsey and Duncan's wedding, and Lisa insists he takes her as his plus one in order to upstage the bride and groom. However, his happiness son comes crashing down, as Craig's mother finds him and accuses him of grooming her son with money and video games in front of a crowd of paparazzi. *Episode 5: One Love After a catalogue of dating disasters, close shaves with the law and public disgrace in front of celebrities and models, Rob decides to give up looking for the perfect plus one to outshine Linsey and Duncan. However, before long he meets the beautiful Astrid (a millionaire, supermodel, biochemist whose dad invented Toilet Duck), and they quickly fall for each other. On spending the night together and joining Linsey and Duncan for a double date, he decides Astrid is the perfect plus one. However, on arriving at the wedding in her Aston Martin, Astrid appears to be slightly uncomfortable. The priest asks for any objections, and Astrid pulls out a knife, stabbing Duncan in his testicle. It is revealed that she is his number one stalker, believing that she should be his bride. The wedding is ruined, and Linsey and Duncan plan to do it all again in the future. Laura hints at Rob to take her to the next wedding instead of hunting down models and celebrities, but Duncan bursts into the office in tears, claiming that Linsey ran off with Steve Jones, who was covering their wedding for T4.

Early life Fratin was born in Metz, Moselle, France the son of a taxidermist. He first studied drawing under Pioche in Metz and later worked in Paris at the studio of Th√©odore G√©ricault. Work Eagles and Prey by Fratin, Central Park, New York City He exhibited at the Paris Salon from 1831‚Äì1842 and 1850‚Äì1862, as well as at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. Fratin never signed his bronzes but instead used a stamp showing his last name in straight block letters. One of the stamps he used (pictured) showed the \\"n\\" reversed, not by design but due to an error on the part of the maker of the stamp. Bronzes bearing this stamp have the appearance of not seeming to be genuine when in reality they are. Fratin received monumental commissions in France and elsewhere, including the Deux Aigles Gardant Leur Proie (Eagles and Prey, created 1850) displayed since 1863 in New York City's Central Park. Many of his small bronzes‚Äîincluding his miniature bronzes which were more affordable due to their smaller size‚Äîwere sold commercially to the general public during his lifetime. Today, Fratin's sculpture is on permanent display in the Louvre, the city museums of Metz, Lyon, Strasbourg, N√Æmes and at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. The Georg Eisler archive in Vienna also has on display works by Fratin. A number of Fratin's pieces portray horses, especially portraits of famous horses such as Fermer, cheval anglais pur-sang, a wax of which he debuted at the Salon of 1831, the same exhibition in which Barye's Tigre d√©vorant un gavial was featured. At Montrouge Square in Paris appears a colossal bronze group standing 2 meters high entitled Cheval attaqu√© par un lion, executed in 1852. Fratin received many commissions from the State including groups designed for the botanical garden and the esplanade of his hometown; amongst the groups were two dogs, a deer at bay, a purebred horse, and some eagles. He also produced a number of whimsical bear sculptures, one being Ours jouant de la cornemuse which shows a bear holding a musical instrument. Death and legacy Fratin died on 17 August 1864 at Le Raincy (Seine-Saint-Denis) and is buried in Montmartre Cemetery. He is honored in Metz where a street is named after him.

MRCPsych is awarded after the completion of core psychiatry training and successful completion of examinations. A further three years within psychiatry and a certificate of completion of specialist training are required to register as a psychiatrist on the General Medical Council specialist register. The examination has undergone a radical change in the past few years, notably in terms of focus and structure.  Composition  This meant that there were now three written exams and a Clinical Assessment of Skills & Competencies (CASC). In order to obtain membership candidates currently need to complete 30 months post foundation/internship experience in Psychiatry and a pass in all components of the MRCPsych Examinations. The current examination consists of 3 parts, with 2 written papers and a clinical exam (CASC). Paper A focuses on Neuroscience, Pharmacology, Psychology and theory, while Paper B focuses on Current Clinical Practice & Evidence within General Adult and the various subspecialties of Psychiatry, Epidemiology, Statistics, Critical Appraisal and Psychotherapy. History The qualification was first introduced in 1972 a year after the founding of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. In recent years extensive modernisation has taken place in line with changes occurring in medical training in the UK. Major changes included the replacement of the classical long case method of assessment (where a single case is presented to the candidate, a history is taken and the case is presented to the examiners) with the objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) in 2003, and the subsequent replacement of the OSCE with the CASC exam in 2008. A major factor for these changes has been the perceived reliability of the assessments. The long case assessments were criticised for their inter-test reliability with a study showing the reproducibility coefficient was as low as 0.24. However, some psychiatrists were disappointed that loss of the long case method of assessment may be a detriment to future candidates ability to take an effective clinical history.

It is a Grade I listed building south of Chellaston on the A514. The pavilion was constructed between 1630 and 1632. Its frontage displays the arms of Sir John Harpur and his wife Catherine Howard (granddaughter of the Earl of Suffolk), who had married in 1631 or 1632, so it may have been built in celebration of their marriage. The Harpur family lived at the adjacent Swarkestone (Old) Hall, built in the 1560s for Sir Richard Harpur. The purpose of the building is a matter of some debate. It has been referred to as the Bowling Alley House, The Stand, The Grandstand, The Bullring and The Summerhouse; it is also suggested it may be a banqueting house or a decorative part of a formal garden. Even the enclosure to the front of the pavilion is debated, with suggestions it may have been constructed in the 19th century when the Swarkestone estate was used for large-scale livestock breeding.  Description  The building stands in a large field known as \\"The Cuttle\\" which stretches from the Old Hall to the A514 road; to its front is a walled enclosed for the Bowling Green (some say bull baiting ring). The pavilion is built from local gritstone rubble (thought to have been quarried on the Swarkestone estate); the front of the pavilion, however, is faced with fine ashlar Keuper sandstone, decorated with the coat of arms of Sir John Harpur. The building is in a Jacobean style with a two-storey centre, castellated parapet, flanked by a pair of three-storey towers with leaded cupolas topped by balled finials. The building was probably not constructed in one go and the towers are thought to have added as \\"an afterthought\\"; for example, their masonry \\"butts up\\" to that of the central part of the building, and is not bonded in. The pavilion is thought to have been built by a local mason called Richard Shepperd, who was paid ¬£111 12s 4d to construct a building known as the \\"bowle alley house\\"; however, the Harpur family's accounts list the \\"Bowl Alley Surveyor\\" as a Mr. Wooldridge. Mark Girouard has suggested that, judging by its style, the building may have been designed by John Smythson, who had done work elsewhere in Derbyshire; however this seems unlikely, given that the pavilion gained its Smythson-like appearance through later additions, and the evidence pointing to Sheppard and Woodridge. The main Harpur line failed with the death of Henry Harpur in 1677, and the estate fell to the descendants of his great-uncle, Sir Henry Harpur, who had bought an estate at Calke Abbey in 1621. Thereafter Calke was the principal seat of the family and Swarkestone Hall fell into decline. It was demolished around 1750, with only its 17th-century gate piers (Grade II listed) and the ruins of the house (Grade II* listed) remaining. In 1844 the pavilion was struck by lightning. The cupolas were subsequently repaired, but with a changed profile: the roofs were set back 'inside the line of the cornice'. The pavilion fell into dereliction some time afterwards.  Rolling Stones photo shoot  In June 1968 the Rolling Stones had a photo shoot with Michael Joseph in and around the Pavilion for the album Beggar's Banquet. The album was released in a different sleeve without these pictures, but some were used for the Stones' first compilation album, Hot Rocks 1964‚Äì1971.  Acquisition by the Landmark Trust  After many years of neglect, in 1985 the Pavilion was acquired by the Landmark Trust. The trust reconstructed the pavilion at a cost of around ¬£100,000; the dereliction was so bad that only the masonry of the current pavilion is original ‚Äì everything else is modern replacement. The trust now rent the building as holiday accommodation.

It has been used for hydrological studies throughout the world.Bortone, p.24 History GEMSS has been used for ultimate heat sink analyses at Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant, and Arkansas Nuclear One. In Pennsylvania it has been applied at PPL Corporation's Brunner Island Steam Electric Station on the lower Susquehanna River, Exelon‚Äôs Cromby and Limerick Generating Stations on the Schuylkill River, and at several other electric power facilities. River applications for electric power facilities have been made on the Susquehanna (Brunner Island), the Missouri(Labadie Power Station), the Delaware (Mercer and Gilbert Generating Station), the Connecticut (Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant), and others. Applications of GEMSS and its individual component modules have been accepted by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Canada. It is the sole hydrodynamic model listed in the model selection tool database for hydrodynamic and chemical fate models that can perform 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D time-variable modeling for most waterbody types, consider all state variables and include the near- and far-fields. GEMSS can also provide GUI‚Äôs, grid generation, and GIS linkage tools and has strong documentation.Fitzpatrick, J., et al. Features GEMSS includes a grid generator and editor, control file generator, 2-D and 3-D post processing viewers, and an animation tool. It uses a database approach to store and access model results. The database approach is also used for field data; as a result, the GEMSS viewers can be used to display model results, field data or both, a capability useful for understanding the behavior of the prototype as well as for calibrating the model. The field data analysis features can be used independently using GEMSS modeling capability. =Modeling techniques= A GEMSS application requires two types of data: (1) spatial data (primarily the waterbody shoreline and bathymetry, but also locations, elevations, and configurations of man-made structures) and (2) temporal data (time-varying boundary condition data defining tidal elevation, inflow rate and temperature, inflow constituent concentration, outflow rate, and meteorological data. All deterministic models, including GEMSS, require uninterrupted time-varying boundary condition data. There can be no long gaps in the datasets and all required datasets must be available during the span of the proposed simulation period. For input to the model, the spatial data is encoded primarily in two input files: the control and bathymetry files. These files are geo-referenced. The temporal data is encoded in many files, each file representing a set of time-varying boundary conditions, for example, meteorological data for surface heat exchange and wind shear, or inflow rates for a tributary stream. Each record in the boundary condition files is stamped with a year-month-day-hour- minute address. The data can be subjected to quality assurance procedures by using GEMSS to plot, then to visually inspect individual data points, trends and outliers. The set of input files and the GEMSS executable constitute the model application.

A pony is a small horse (Equus ferus caballus). Depending on the context, a pony may be a horse that is under an approximate or exact height at the withers or a small horse with a specific conformation and temperament. A pony is typically under the height of 14.2 hands high. There are many different breeds. Compared to other horses, ponies often exhibit thick manes, tails and overall coat, as well as proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, thicker necks, and shorter heads with broader foreheads. The word pony derives from the old French poulenet, meaning foal, a young, immature horse, but this is not the modern meaning; unlike a horse foal, a pony remains small when fully grown. On occasion, people who are unfamiliar with horses may confuse an adult pony with a foal. The ancestors of most modern ponies developed small stature because they lived on marginally livable horse habitat. These smaller animals were domesticated and bred for various purposes all over the Northern Hemisphere. Ponies were historically used for driving and freight transport, as children's mounts, for recreational riding, and later as competitors and performers in their own right. During the Industrial Revolution, particularly in Great Britain, a significant number were used as pit ponies, hauling loads of coal in the mines. Ponies are generally considered intelligent and friendly. They are sometimes also described as stubborn or cunning. Properly trained ponies are appropriate mounts for children who are learning to ride. Larger ponies can be ridden by adults, as ponies are usually strong for their size. In modern use, many organizations define a pony as a mature horse that measures less than at the withers, but there are a number of exceptions. Different organizations that use a strict measurement model vary from to nearly . Many breeds classify an animal as either horse or pony based on pedigree and phenotype, no matter its height. Some full-sized horses may be called ponies as a term of endearment. A group of ponies is called \\"a string of ponies,\\" which dates back to a mention in the 15th century Harley Manuscript. Horses and ponies A pony foal. Pony foals are smaller than standard horse foals, but both have long legs and small bodies. For many forms of competition, the official definition of a pony is a horse that measures less than at the withers. Standard horses are 14.2 or taller. The International Federation for Equestrian Sports defines the official cutoff point at without shoes and with shoes, though allows a margin for competition measurement of up to without shoes, or with shoes.\\"PONY MEASUREMENT 2007 30 January 2007 \\" Explanation of Article 3103.1, FInternational Federation for Equestrian Sport Web site, Accessed October 7, 2009 However, the term \\"pony\\" can be used in general (or affectionately) for any small horse, regardless of its actual size or breed. Furthermore, some horse breeds may have individuals who mature under that height but are still called \\"horses\\" and are allowed to compete as horses. In Australia, horses that measure from are known as a \\"galloway\\", and ponies in Australia measure under .Owlet, Lorna and Phlip Mathews, Ponies in Australia, Milsons Point: 1979 People who are unfamiliar with horses may confuse an adult pony with a young, immature horse. While foals that will grow up to be horse- sized may be no taller than some ponies in their first months of life, their body proportions are very different. A pony can be ridden and put to work, while a foal is too young to be ridden or used as a working animal. Foals, whether they grow up to be horse or pony-sized, can be distinguished from adult horses by their extremely long legs and slim bodies. Their heads and eyes also exhibit juvenile characteristics. Furthermore, in most cases, nursing foals will be in very close proximity to a mare who is the mother (dam) of the foal. While ponies exhibit some neoteny with the wide foreheads and small size, their body proportions are similar to that of an adult horse. History Ponies originally developed as a landrace adapted to a harsh natural environment, and were considered part of the \\"draft\\" subtype typical of Northern Europe. At one time, it was hypothesized that they may have descended from a wild \\"draft\\" subspecies of Equus ferus. Studies of mitochondrial DNA (which is passed on though the female line) indicate that a large number of wild mares have contributed to modern domestic breeds; in contrast, studies of y-DNA (passed down the male line) suggest that there was possibly just one single male ancestor of all domesticated breeds. Domestication of the horse probably first occurred in the Eurasian steppes with horses of between to over , and as horse domestication spread, the male descendants of the original stallion went on to be bred with local wild mares. Domesticated ponies of all breeds originally developed mainly from the need for a working animal that could fulfill specific local draft and transportation needs while surviving in harsh environments. The usefulness of the pony was noted by farmers who observed that a pony could outperform a draft horse on small farms.Smith, E.C.A. \\"The Pony Useful\\" Country Life in America, volume 29. Doubleday, Page & Co., 1916 pp.46-47 By the 20th century, many pony breeds had Arabian and other blood added to make a more refined pony suitable for riding. Uses An Australian pony shown under saddle Ponies are seen in many different equestrian pursuits. Some breeds, such as the Hackney pony, are primarily used for driving, while other breeds, such as the Connemara pony and Australian Pony, are used primarily for riding. Others, such as the Welsh pony, are used for both riding and driving. A Shetland pony shown in harness There is no direct correlation between a horse's size and its inherent athletic ability.Barakat, Christine. \\"Why Size Matters.\\" Equus, October 2007, Issue 361, pp. 36-42 Ponies compete at events that include show hunter, English riding on the flat, driving, and western riding classes at horse shows, as well as other competitive events such as gymkhana and combined driving. They are seen in casual pursuits such as trail riding, but a few ponies have performed in international-level competition. Though many exhibitors confine themselves to classes just for ponies, some top ponies are competitive against full-sized horses. For example, a pony named Stroller was a member of the British Equestrian show jumping team, and won the silver medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics. More recently, the pony Theodore O'Connor won the gold medal in eventing at the 2007 Pan American Games. Pony Clubs, open to young people who own either horses or ponies, are formed worldwide to educate young people about horses, promote responsible horse ownership, and also sponsor competitive events for young people and smaller horses. In many parts of the world ponies are also still used as working animals, as pack animals and for pulling various horse-drawn vehicles. They are used for children's pony rides at traveling carnivals and at children's private parties where small children can take short rides on ponies that are saddled and then either led individually or hitched to a \\"pony wheel\\" (a non-motorized device akin to a hot walker) that leads six to eight ponies at a time. Ponies are sometimes seen at summer camps for children, and are widely used for pony trekking and other forms of Equitourism riding holidays, often carrying adults as well as children. Ponies are used for riding Kedarnath pilgrims in India. Characteristics The Shetland pony is one of the smallest pony breeds, but is very strong. Ponies are often distinguished by their phenotype, a stocky body, dense bone, round shape and well-sprung ribs. They have a short head, large eyes and small ears. In addition to being smaller than a horse, their legs are proportionately shorter. They have strong hooves and grow a heavier hair coat, seen in a thicker mane and tail as well as a particularly heavy winter coat. Pony breeds have developed all over the world, particularly in cold and harsh climates where hardy, sturdy working animals were needed. They are remarkably strong for their size. Breeds such as the Connemara pony are recognized for their ability to carry a full-sized adult rider. Pound for pound ponies can pull and carry more weight than a horse. Draft-type ponies are able to pull loads significantly greater than their own weight, with larger ponies capable of pulling loads comparable to those pulled by full- sized draft horses, and even very small ponies are able to pull as much as 450 percent of their own weight.McNeill, Erin. \\"Ponies at Boone County Fair pull their weight and then some\\" Missourian, July 27, 2010 Nearly all pony breeds are very hardy, easy keepers that share the ability to thrive on a more limited diet than that of a regular-sized horse, requiring half the hay for their weight as a horse, and often not needing grain at all. However, for the same reason, they are also more vulnerable to laminitis and Cushing's syndrome. They may also have problems with hyperlipemia. Ponies are generally considered intelligent and friendly, though sometimes they also are described as stubborn or cunning. The differences of opinion often result from an individual pony's degree of proper training. Ponies trained by inexperienced individuals, or only ridden by beginners, can turn out to be spoiled because their riders typically lack the experience base to correct bad habits. Properly trained ponies are appropriate mounts for children who are learning to ride. Larger ponies can be ridden by adults, as ponies are usually strong for their size. The Connemara pony is a larger pony which occasionally matures over . For showing purposes, ponies are often grouped into small, medium, and large sizes. Small ponies are and under, medium ponies are over 12.2 but no taller than , and large ponies are over but no taller than . The smallest equines are called miniature horses by many of their breeders and breed organizations, rather than ponies, even though they stand smaller than small ponies, usually no taller than at the withers. However, there are also miniature pony breeds. Breeds and types that are not ponies The full-sized horses used for polo are called \\"polo ponies,\\" even though they are taller than ponies. Some horse breeds are not defined as ponies, even when they have some animals that measure under . This is usually due to body build, traditional uses and overall physiology. Breeds that are considered horses regardless of height include the Arabian horse, American Quarter Horse and the Morgan horse, all of which have individual members both over and under . The Icelandic horse is considered a horse, not a pony, by those who own and breed them. Other horse breeds, such as Icelandic horse and Fjord horse, may sometimes be pony-sized or have some pony characteristics, such as a heavy coat, thick mane, and heavy bone, but are generally classified as \\"horses\\" by their respective registries. In cases such as these, there can be considerable debate over whether to call certain breeds \\"horses\\" or \\"ponies.\\" However, individual breed registries usually are the arbiters of such debates, weighing the relative horse and pony characteristics of a breed. In some breeds, such as the Welsh pony, the horse-versus-pony controversy is resolved by creating separate divisions for consistently horse-sized animals, such as the \\"Section D\\" Welsh Cob. Some horses may be pony height due to environment more than genetics. For example, the Chincoteague pony, a feral horse that lives on Assateague Island off the coast of Virginia, often matures to the height of an average small horse when raised from a foal under domesticated conditions. There is debate over whether the feral Chincoteague ponies of Assateague Island are horses or ponies Conversely, the term \\"pony\\" is occasionally used to describe horses of normal height. Horses used for polo are often called \\"polo ponies\\" regardless of height, even though they are often of Thoroughbred breeding and often well over . American Indian tribes also have the tradition of referring to their horses as \\"ponies,\\" when speaking in English, even though many of the Mustang horses they used in the 19th century were close to or over , and most horses owned and bred by Native peoples today are of full horse height. The term \\"pony\\" is also sometimes used to describe a full-sized horse in a humorous or affectionate sense. The United States Pony Club defines \\"pony\\" to be any mount that is ridden by a member regardless of its breed or size. Persons up to 25 years old are eligible for membership, and some of the members' \\"ponies\\" actually are full-size horses.

The statue was a gift from the Swedish Aeronautical Society in memory of different Swedish aviation pioneers who fell in both the North Pole expedition and in the first time of the Swedish aviator era in 1917. The task to build the monument was given to the famous sculptor Carl Milles. The Aviator Monument was finished in 1931. The statue The monument is a sculpture of a large eagle with outstretched wings about to lift. Height 185 cm, width 750 cm and depth 185 cm. On the plinth which the statue is standing on are reliefs of Icarus, balloonists and early warplanes. Milles thought that an eagle would be an excellent symbol. Inside the shallow monument there is an urn, which contains medals for each fallen Swedish pilot. History Some may think that the Aviator Monument is Carl Milles admiration for Nazism. The eagle with its outstretched wings is often associated with the Nazi symbol, The Nazi Eagle. In the 1940s, young Swedish Nazis used the monument as a meeting point, and a place for gathering and commemoration. At this meeting point they commemorated. During this time young socialists sabotaged the statue with graffiti in protests against Nazis. The Swedish Air Force used it as a monument for a wreath-laying ceremony. The original purpose of this statue is to honour fallen pilots such as Salomon August Andr√©e, Nils Strindberg and Knut Fraenkel who died in the North Pole expedition in 1898.

(5) Vesicles containing protons avoid acidification of the cytoplasm, but still generate ATP from the electrochemical gradient (in A.ferrooxidans); (6) Uncouplers (uncharged compounds), such as organic acids, permeate the membrane and release their H+, leading to acidification of the cytoplasm; (7) To avoid this, heterotrophic acidophiles may degrade the uncouplers; (8) Alternatively, cytoplasmic enzymes or chemicals may bind or sequester the protons. The outflow of acidic liquids and other pollutants from mines is often catalysed by acid-loving microorganisms; these are the acidophiles in acid mine drainage. Acidophiles are not just present in exotic environments such as Yellowstone National Park or deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Genera such as Acidithiobacillus and Leptospirillum bacteria, and Thermoplasmatales archaea, are present in syntrophic relationships in the more mundane environments of concrete sewer pipes and implicated in the heavy-metal-containing, sulfurous waters of rivers such as the Rheidol. Such microorganisms are responsible for the phenomenon of acid mine drainage (AMD) and thus are important both economically and from a conservation perspective. Control of these acidophiles and their harnessing for industrial biotechnology shows their effect need not be entirely negative. The use of acidophilic organisms in mining is a new technique for extracting trace metals through bioleaching, and offers solutions for the phenomenon of acid mine drainage in mining spoils. Introduction Upon exposure to oxygen (O2) and water (H2O), metal sulfides undergo oxidation to produce metal-rich acidic effluent. If the pH is low enough to overcome the natural buffering capacity of the surrounding rocks (‚Äòcalcium carbonate equivalent‚Äô or ‚Äòacid neutralising capacity‚Äô), the surrounding area may become acidic, as well as contaminated with high levels of heavy metals. Though acidophiles have an important place in the iron and sulfur biogeochemical cycles, strongly acidic environments are overwhelmingly anthropogenic in cause, primarily created at the cessation of mining operations where sulfide minerals, such as pyrite (iron disulfide or FeS2), are present. Acid mine drainage may occur in the mine itself, the spoil heap (particularly colliery spoils from coal mining), or through some other activity that exposes metal sulfides at a high concentration, such as at major construction sites. Banks et al. provide a basic summary of the processes that occur: : + + + + Bacterial influences on acid mine drainage The oxidation of metal sulfide (by oxygen) is slow without colonization by acidophiles, particularly Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (synonym Thiobacillus ferrooxidans). These bacteria can accelerate pyritic oxidation by 106 times. In that study, a proposal for the rate at which A.ferrooxidans can oxidise pyrite is the ability to use ferrous iron to generate a ferric iron catalyst : :Fe2+ + 1/4O2 + H+ ‚Üí Fe3+ + 1/2H2O Under the above acidic conditions, ferric iron (Fe3+) is a more potent oxidant than oxygen, resulting in faster pyrite oxidation rates. A.ferrooxidans is a chemolithoautotrophic bacteria, due to the oligotrophic nature (low dissolved organic carbon concentration) of acidic environments, and their lack of illumination for phototrophy. Even when in vadose conditions, A.ferrooxidans can survive, if the rock retains moisture and the mine is aerated. In fact in this situation, with pioneer microorganisms, the limiting factor is likely to be the environmental circumneutral pH, which inhibits many acidophiles' growth. However, favourable geochemical conditions quickly develop with an acidic interface between the bacteria and the mineral surface, and pH is lowered to a level closer to acidophilic optimum. The process proceeds through A.ferrooxidans exhibiting a quorum level for the trigger of acid mine drainage (AMD). At first colonisation of metal sulfides there is no AMD, and as the bacteria grow into microcolonies, AMD remains absent, then at a certain colony size, the population begins to produce a measurable change in water chemistry, and AMD escalates. This means pH is not a clear measure of a mine's liability to AMD; culturing A.ferrooxidans (or others) gives a definite indication of a future AMD issue. Other bacteria also implicated in AMD include Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans. Archaean acidophiles Though proteobacteria display impressive acid tolerance, most retain a circumneutral cytoplasm to avoid denaturation of their acid-labile cell constituents. Archaea such as Ferroplasma acidiphilum, which oxidises ferrous iron, have a number of intracellular enzymes with an optimum similar to that of their external acidic environment. This may explain their ability to survive pH as low as 1.3. The differing cell membranes in archaea compared to the bacteria may hold part of the explanation; ether lipids that link isoprene, compared to proteobacteria's di-ester linkage, are central to the difference. Though lacking a cell wall, F. acidiphilum cell membranes contain caldarchaetidylglycerol tetraether lipids, which effectively block almost all proton access, Thermoplasma acidophilum also uses these bulky isoprenoid cores in its phospholipid bilayer. It is possible that the family Ferroplasmaceae may in fact be more important in AMD than the current paradigm, Acidithiobacillaceae. From a practical viewpoint this changes little, as despite the myriad physiological differences between archaea and bacteria, treatments would remain the same; if pH is kept high, and water and oxygen are prohibited from the pyrite, the reaction will be negligible. The isolation from solfataric soils of two Picrophilus species of archaea P.oshimae and P.torridus are of note for their record low of survival at pH 0, indicating that further AMD microorganisms may remain to be found which operate at an even lower pH. Though the genus Picrophilus is not known to be involved in AMD, its extreme acidophily is of interest, for instance its proton-resistant liposomes, which could be present in AMD acidophiles. Interactions in the mine community Tentatively, there may be examples of syntrophy between acidophilic species, and even cross- domain cooperation between archaea and bacteria. One mutalistic example is the rotation of iron between species; ferrous-oxidising chemolithotrophs use iron as an electron donor, then ferric-reducing heterotrophs use iron as an electron-acceptor. Another more synergistic behaviour is the faster oxidation of ferrous iron when A.ferrooxidans and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans are combined in low-CO2 culture. S.thermosulfidooxidans is a more efficient iron- oxidiser, but this is usually inhibited by low-CO2 uptake. A.ferrooxidans has a higher affinity for the gas, but a lower iron oxidation speed, and so can supply S.thermosulfidooxidans for mutual benefit. The community possesses diversity beyond the bacteria and archaea however; the approximately constant pH present during acid mine drainage make for a reasonably stable environment, with a community that spans a number of trophic levels, and includes obligately acidophilic eukaryotes such as fungi, yeasts, algae and protozoa. Physiology and biochemistry Acidophiles display a great range of adaptations to not just tolerating, but thriving in an extreme pH environment (the definition of an acidophile being an organism that has a pH optimum below pH 3). Principal in these is the necessity of maintaining a large pH gradient, to ensure a circumneutral cytoplasm (normally, however not in Picrophilus species). The archaeans have already been discussed above, and further information on their and bacterial adaptations are in basic form in the Figure. To elaborate upon the figure, the bacteria also use membrane proton blocking to maintain a high cytoplasmic pH, which is a passive system as even non-respiring A.ferrooxidans exhibit it. Acidophiles are also able to extrude protons against the pH gradient with unique transport proteins, a process more difficult for moderate- and hyper-thermophiles; a higher temperature causes cell membranes to become more permeable to protons, necessarily leading to increased H+ influx, in the absence of other membrane alterations. =Proton motive force= To grow at low pH, acidophiles must maintain a pH gradient of several pH units across the cellular membrane. Acidophiles harness the strong proton motive force (PMF), caused by the pH gradient across their cell membrane, for ATP production. A large amount of energy is available to the acidophile through proton movement across the membrane, but with it comes cytoplasmic acidity. Instead ions such as sodium can be used as a substitute energy transducer to avoid this pH increase (ATPases are often Na+ linked, rather than H+ linked). =Expelling H+ containing vesicles= Alternatively bacteria can use H+ containing vesicles to avoid cytoplasmic acidity (see Figure), but most require that any H+ taken in must be extruded after use in the electron transport chain (ETC). On the subject of the ETC, an adaptation to living in the mine environment is in the use of different ETC electron acceptors to neutralophiles; sulfur, arsenic, selenium, uranium, iron, and manganese in solid form rather than O2 (most commonly Fe in dissimilatory iron reduction, frequent in AMD). =Genomic adaptations= Genomic adaptations are also present, but not without complications in organisms like Thermoplasmatales archaea, which is both acidophilic and thermophilic. For instance, this Order expresses an increased concentration of purine-containing codons for heat-stability, whilst increasing pyramidine codons in long open reading frames for protection from acid-stress. More generally, and presumably to reduce the chances of an acid-hydrolysis mutation, all obligate hyperacidophiles have truncated genomes when compared to neutralophile microorganisms. Picrophilus torridus, for instance, has the highest coding density of any non-parasitic aerobic microorganism living on organic substrates. =Improved repair= Acidophiles also benefit from improved DNA and protein repair systems such as chaperones involved in protein refolding. The P.torridus genome just mentioned contains a large numbers of genes concerned with repair proteins. Biotechnology applications Bioremediation is the primary biotech issue created by the AMD acidophiles. There are a number of methods for dealing with AMD, some crude (such as raising pH through liming, removing water, binding iron with organic wastes) and some less so (application of bactericides, biocontrol with other bacteria/archaea, offsite wetland creation, use of metal-immobilising bacteria, galvanic suppression). A number of other neutralising agents are available (pulverised fuel ash-based grouts, cattle manure, whey, brewer's yeast) many which solve a waste disposal problem from another industry. As supplies of some metals dwindle, other methods of extraction are being explored, including the use of acidophiles, in a process known as bioleaching. Though slower than conventional methods, the microorganisms (which can also include fungi) enable the exploitation of extremely low grade ores with minimum expense. Projects include nickel extraction with A.ferrooxidans and Aspergillus sp. fungi and sulfur removal from coal with Acidithiobacillus sp.. The extraction can occur at the mine site, from waste water streams (or the main watercourse if the contamination has reached that far), in bioreactors, or at a power station (for instance to remove sulfur from coal before combustion to avoid sulfuric acid rain). Future of the technique AMD continues to be important in the River Rheidol, and in the near future further treatment will be needed in the area around Aberystwyth, which contains 38 of the 50 worst polluting metal mines in Wales.Environment Agency, 2002, in Pearce, N.J.G., Hartley, S., Perkins, W.T., Dinelli, E., Edyvean, R.G.J., Priestman, G., Bachmann, R. & Sandlands, L.

In 2007, the UK government endorsed a return to coal as an energy sourceDepartment of Trade and Industry (2007) Meeting the Energy Challenge: a white paper on energy. pp.111-112. Accessed 27/02/08 and mining in the UK is increasing (for instance the open-cast coal pit at Ffos-y-fran, Merthyr Tydfil). Much preventative work will be required to avoid the AMD associated with the last generation of coal mines. The fast and efficient protein and DNA repair systems show promise for human medical uses, particularly with regard to cancer and ageing. However further research is required to determine whether these systems really are qualitatively different, and how that can be applied from microorganisms to humans. As discussed above, acidophiles can have the option to use electron acceptors other than oxygen. Johnson (1998) points out that facultative anaerobism of acidophiles, previously dismissed, could have major implications for AMD control. Further research is needed to determine how far current methods to block oxygen will working, in light of the fact that the reaction may be able to continue anaerobically.

The devices can be separated by a few meters (e.g. via Ethernet) or nearly unlimited distances (e.g. via the interconnections of the Internet). There are several technologies used for network connections. Patch cables are used for short distances in offices and wiring closets. Electrical connections using twisted pair or coaxial cable are used within a building. Optical fiber cable is used for long distances or for applications requiring high bandwidth or electrical isolation. Many installations use structured cabling practices to improve reliability and maintainability. In some home and industrial applications power lines are used as network cabling. Twisted pair alt=A picture of an unterminated cable, showing four twisted pairs of wires Twisted pair cabling is a form of wiring in which pairs of wires (the forward and return conductors of a single circuit) are twisted together for the purposes of canceling out electromagnetic interference (EMI) from other wire pairs and from external sources. This type of cable is used for home and corporate Ethernet networks. Twisted pair cabling is used in short patch cables and in the longer runs in structured cabling. An Ethernet crossover cable is a type of twisted pair Ethernet cable used to connect computing devices together directly that would normally be connected via a network switch, Ethernet hub or router, such as directly connecting two personal computers via their network adapters. Most current Ethernet devices support Auto MDI-X, so it doesn't matter whether you use crossover or straight cables.  Fiber optics Multi-mode fiber cables with LC (top) and ST (bottom) optical fiber connectors, both with protective caps in place. An optical fiber cable consists of a center glass core surrounded by several layers of protective material. Optical fiber deployment is more expensive than copper but offers higher bandwidth and can cover longer distances. There are two major types of optical fiber cables: shorter-range multi-mode fiber and long-range single-mode fiber. Coaxial A coaxial cable has a central conductor surrounded by a sheath of conductor with insulation in between. Coaxial cables form a transmission line and confine the electromagnetic wave inside the cable between the center conductor and the shield. The transmission of energy in the line occurs totally through the dielectric inside the cable between the conductors. Coaxial lines can therefore be bent and twisted (subject to limits) without negative effects, and they can be strapped to conductive supports without inducing unwanted currents in them. Early Ethernet, 10BASE5 and 10BASE2, used baseband signaling over coaxial cables. In the 20th century the L-carrier system used coaxial cable for long-distance calling. Coaxial cables are commonly used for television and other broadband signals. Although in most homes coaxial cables have been installed for transmission of TV signals, new technologies (such as the ITU-T G.hn standard) open the possibility of using home coaxial cable for high-speed home networking applications (Ethernet over coax). Patch A patch cable is an electrical or optical cable used to connect one electronic device to another towards building infrastructure for signal routing. Devices of different types (e.g. a switch connected to a computer, or a switch connected to a router) are connected with patch cables. Patch cables are usually produced in many different colors so as to be easily distinguishable, and most are relatively short, no longer than a few meters. In contrast to on- premises wiring, patch cables are more flexible. Power lines Although AC power wires are not designed for networking applications, power line communication (PLC) allows these wires to also be used to interconnect home computers, peripherals or other networked consumer products. The HomePlug protocol family was an early PLC technology. In December 2008, the ITU-T adopted Recommendation G.hn/G.9960 as the first worldwide standard for high- speed powerline communications. G.hn also specifies techniques for communications over the existing category 3 cable used by phones and coaxial cable used by cable television in the home.

Mr Pitt and Miss Buckle put in competing bids. Mr Pitt bid ¬£200,000, which PHH accepted ‚Äòsubject to contract‚Äô. Miss Buckle then increased her bid to ¬£210,000. PHH withdrew its acceptance of Mr Pitt. Mr Pitt threatened to sue for an injunction, to compel transfer of the cottage to him (it was noted in the Court of Appeal that this probably would have not succeeded, and just caused nuisance). So PHH agreed to sell to him and said they would consider no further offers. This is known as a \\"lock out agreement\\". But then, PHH sold to Miss Buckle anyway. Mr Pitt sued. PHH argued in its defence, there was no consideration to not consider further offers (for the lock out agreement), because Mr Pitt had only promised to be ready, willing and able to proceed with exchange of contracts, and he was already obliged to do that. Judgment Peter Gibson LJ held there was consideration. First, Mr Pitt had agreed to not apply for an injunction.

All tramcars reversed here. The halt was the line's temporary western terminus for the eighteen months from opening until the extension to the permanent terminus at Immingham Dock was opened on 17 November 1913. Throughout this period the halt appeared on tickets as plain \\"Immingham\\", being permanently \\"Immingham Town\\" thereafter. Overview The electric railway was built primarily to carry workers between Grimsby and the dock facilities, Immingham Dock having been built on a greenfield site in a sparsely populated area. The line was built by the Great Central Railway and remained in railway ownership up to closure in 1961. It therefore appeared in railway timetables and it was possible to buy through tickets between any of the stops on the line and anywhere on the national railway network, though there never was any physical connection with any conventional track, nor with the tramways in Grimsby and Cleethorpes. In modern parlance the vehicles would be described as trams, but they were typically referred to locally and in publications such as Bradshaw as \\"cars\\" or \\"tramcars\\", with related things being called names such as \\"tramcar halt\\" and \\"tramcar bridge.\\" \\"Car\\" was always a more common short form than \\"tram.\\" Location and facilities Immingham Town - known locally as \\"Tramcar Halt\\" - was situated outside the dock estate in what in 2012 was still open country. It was the nearest point to the line for its two lesser markets - railwaymen travelling to and from Immingham engine shed and residents of the village of Immingham, by far the greatest market being dock workers. The station was nevertheless a third of a mile from the engine shed and a good mile from the village proper. The line was a tramway, no platforms ever existed at any of the stopping places; passengers were expected to board and alight from the roadway or trackside cinders according to the location. The \\"stations\\" were much more commonly referred to as \\"halts\\" or \\"stopping places.\\" In the case of Immingham Town the tracks ran along a metalled road, giving passengers a firm footing at least. A wooden waiting shelter was provided at Immingham Town, but it gave scant protection from the elements. During the Second World War this was replaced by an altogether more substantial brick shelter designed to double as an air raid shelter. This structure was still in place in 2013. Passengers bought tickets from the conductor on board the cars. The lines from the station Tramcars arrived from Immingham Dock down the grooved double track southern slope of one of the two \\"hills\\" on the whole line, i.e. the bridge over the conventional Grimsby District Light Railway line near Immingham East Junction. This bridge, which was in regular, heavy road use in 2015, was known locally as \\"tramcar bridge.\\" All cars reversed at Immingham Town, a process which took several minutes as the conductor had to unhook the rear trolley pole from the overhead wire then attach the front one, which would become the rear one on reversing. On restarting the tramcar would swing right off the public road, change from grooved rails to conventional and merge to become a single track on a reserved way running parallel to the conventional Grimsby District Light Railway line through open, marshy farmland. Tramcars running in the opposite direction followed the same procedure in reverse. This was not quite the whole story. When the line was proposed it included plans to continue from Immingham Town southwest along Queens Road to a point near the footpath to the engine shed, or \\"Loco\\" as it was called locally. When the line was completed in 1913 the extension was omitted. Influential fingers were wagged so the company grudgingly built it to what would have been Queens Road Halt. Proving tramcars ran every quarter to maintain the right of way, but no revenue earning vehicle ever traversed it. The overhead wires and points were removed in the Second World War and all trace of the branch had gone by 1955. Services Unusually among British tramways services ran round the clock, particularly to provide for railway workers based at Immingham engine shed, whose duties often involved starting or finishing at unsocial hours. Traffic was highly peaked, with convoys of tramcars leaving and arriving to match shift changes at the dock. It was normal for several tramcars to queue to reverse at Immingham Town at the peaks. In 1956 over a million passengers used the line and even with deliberate rundown a quarter of a million used it in its last twelve months up to closure in July 1961. Closure The line took some years to die, being cut back at the Grimsby end in 1956 then reduced to peak services only in 1959, when it disappeared from Bradshaw and through ticketing beyond the line was withdrawn. Formal closure of the line and Immingham Town tramcar halt came on Monday 3 July 1961, with the last tramcars running on Saturday 1 July 1961, when a convoy of six tramcars set off from Immingham Dock, nominally at 14:03. The last tramcar of this convoy and therefore the last from Immingham Town was Number 4. Aftermath The first track on the line to be removed was at Dock tramcar station, to give increased parking space. The process of demolition was piecemeal and even in 2013 many hints of the line remained, such as spun concrete masts near Immingham Town.

At Habrough Marsh Drain bridge a little over half a mile from the station road and rail merged, with the tracks changing to grooved tramway common throughout all road tramways. This spot was and remains the eastern boundary of dock property. In 2012 this was a continuously staffed entrance checkpoint with barriers to road vehicles and pedestrians. In the 1950s and 1960s the spot was completely unmarked, with not so much as a sign to indicate entering or leaving the dock.

A fourth, turnback, loop was added at the extreme western end of the street running section, west of Cleveland Bridge, in 1956 when the remainder of the street running section closed. Unlike the \\"country\\" section of the line, halts did not always coincide with loops. The points at the ends of the loops were spring loaded. As the line was unsignalled, motormen drove by line of sight. No platforms ever existed at any of the stopping places; passengers were expected to board and alight from the roadway or trackside cinders according to the location. The \\"stations\\" were much more commonly referred to as \\"halts\\" or \\"stopping places.\\" With the sole exception of this station, where a ticket office was provided, passengers bought their tickets from conductors on board the cars. Corporation Bridge terminus opened with the line in 1912 and was mentioned in the 1914 and 1922 timetables, as well as the 1948 version reproduced in the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway article. The terminus not only had the line's sole ticket office, it had its sole parcels office and was one of only three halts to offer waiting passengers any form of shelter. It also provided offices for the line's superintendent. Finally, the line's two termini - Corporation Bridge and Immingham Dock - were the only halts on the line to attempt anything along the lines of railway nameboards, both proclaimed themselves in very large letters to be a \\"TRAMWAY STATION.\\" Services Unusually among British tramways services ran round the clock, particularly to provide for railway workers based at Immingham engine shed, whose duties often involved starting or finishing at unsocial hours. Traffic was highly peaked, with convoys of tramcars leaving and arriving to match shift changes at the dock. It was normal for several tramcars to queue to enter and leave Corporation Bridge Tramway Station at the peaks. After 1945 industry was attracted to the south bank of the Humber, steadily transforming the landscape from rural to urban, though few workers at the new plants lived locally. This led to an increase in ridership and an increase in footfall at Corporation Bridge. It also coincided with and reinforced a rise in road use along Corporation Road itself, increasing the risk of conflicts and accidents. The tension between tram and rubber wheeled traffic is nowhere better shown than the famous \\"Tram Pinch\\" signs at the roadside. The east coast floods of 1953 did considerable damage to the tramway's infrastructure, with passengers having to walk between tramcars marooned either side of flooded or washed out sections. In 1956 over a million passengers used the line, nevertheless the roadway section east of Cleveland Bridge, including Corporation Bridge Tramway Station, closed at midnight on 30 June 1956. The last car to leave was original GCR car No. 1. Closure The line took some years to die. It was cut back at the Grimsby end in 1956. In 1959 it was reduced to peak services only, it disappeared from Bradshaw and through ticketing beyond the line was withdrawn. Formal closure of the line came on Monday 3 July 1961, with the last tramcars running on Saturday 1 July 1961, when a convoy of six tramcars set off from Immingham Dock, nominally at 14:03. The last tramcar of this convoy and therefore the last of all was Number 4. Aftermath The first track on the line to be removed was at Immingham Dock tramcar station, to give increased parking space. The process of demolition was piecemeal and even in 2013 many hints of the line remained, such as spun concrete masts near Immingham Town. Despite its rickety appearance Corporation Bridge Tramway Station building survived for many years after the line closed. It performed a number of uses, latterly as a yacht chandlers. The wooden bench which stood in front of the station for many years has been preserved at the National Railway Museum, York.

Glass making was discontinued in 1842. The buildings of the works, including the 120 feet high glasshouse cone, were converted into a pottery works which remained in production until 1918. Aerial view of site under excavation. The River Clyde can be seen in the background. This area was the centre of major industry in Glasgow in the 19th and early 20th century. In addition to a rich historical and documentary archive, evidence for the operations and technology of these industries was gained from excavations in 2005. The archaeological excavation, carried out by Headland Archaeology uncovered several buildings and structures relating to both the glass and the pottery works. Historical background The Verreville Glassworks was established by a group of Glasgow merchants in 1777. Workmen were brought from England and Germany to build the cone, a major Glasgow landmark of its day, which reached a height of 120 feet. The company amalgamated with the Glasgow Bottlework Company in c. 1786 and in 1806 the business was sold to the Dumbarton Glass Company. The new business was immediately sold to John Geddes, on the condition that he did not make window glass or bottles. John Geddes founded the ‚ÄòGlasgow and Verreville Glass and Pottery Company‚Äô, which quickly established itself and developed an export trade to North America and Ireland. However, pottery production was a very competitive market and Geddes was soon declared bankrupt. In 1830 the pottery was taken over by Robert Montgomery, a former manager. Montgomery‚Äôs involvement with the pottery was short-lived and by 1833 he too was declared bankrupt. The glassworks were closed in 1834. The glassworks and John Geddes‚Äô house and grounds (Verreville House) were bought by Robert Alexander Kidston who was a partner in the nearby Anderston Pottery (often called Lancefield Pottery). By this time the pottery had two earthenware kilns and one china kiln. Kidston tried to raise the quality of the products - he added the production of porcelain, imported Staffordshire workers and extended the works into the grounds of Verreville House ‚Äì but by 1841 he himself was in financial trouble and the firm was taken over by a consortium, one of whom was Robert Cochran, whose family later owned the much larger Britannia Pottery in Glasgow. Glassmaking appears to have ceased production in 1842 and a number of small pottery kilns were built inside the original glassworks cone. Only white and earthenwares were being made by this time. The Cochran family remained in charge of the pottery until its eventual closure in 1918. Archaeological Excavations The Headland excavations in 2005 revealed several features related to three major phases of development: glass manufacturing activity (c. 1777 ‚Äì mid-1840s), pottery manufacturing phase (late 1840s ‚Äì c. 1859) and the later pottery works (after c. 1859 ‚Äì c. 1918). =Glass Manufacturing Activity= ;The Glassworking Cone The earliest phase of activity identified on site was associated with the production of glass. Evidence for the glass cone structure was identified by four evenly spaced brick built piers. These were constructed of hand made red bricks and formed a half circle in plan. It is probable that this is the remains of the northern half of the original octagonal glass cone structure built in 1777. These piers possibly supported an arcaded external wall, allowing access to the interior of the glass cone. A vaulted tunnel or flue associated with the production of glass Structures of the glass working buildings. The brick piers in the background are the remains of the northern half of the original glass cone structure. Leading into the central area of the ‚Äòglass cone‚Äô was a series of flues. The largest was constructed of hand made red brick with a vaulted ceiling. The interior of the brick was blackened by soot and the floor was blackened natural sand, which contained a large quaintly of broken glass or cullet. These flues would have pulled cold air into a central (unidentified) glass furnace, obliterated by the post-1920s buildings. ;The Glassworking Hovel The sub square building (hovel), which housed the glass cone was only identified by one wall during the excavation. Two lengths of hand made red brick wall, interpreted as the original northern wall of the hovel were excavated. Truncated by later stone pillar bases the fragmentary walls were upstanding to a height of approximately 2 m. The western wall fragment had a remains of a double archway ‚Äì possibly an original entrance into the glass cone. ;The Fritting Floors Two glass working ‚Äòfloor‚Äô structures were identified. The northern structure was constructed of yellow refractory bricks with single coarse brick walls spaced at regular intervals. The floor base was vitrified with a thick layer of melted glass covering it. The southern structure appeared to be of a similar construction although was heavily truncated. These structures have been initially interpreted as possible fritting (or melting) floors for the primary production of melted glass. View of Flint Yard area The pottery buildings during excavation The base of a pottery kiln =Pottery Manufacturing Activity= ;Yard Area A heavily compacted surface of crushed flint covered the eastern area of the site. Several parts of the surface had been repaired by rounded cobbles and obvious areas of wear, including possible cart ruts, were apparent. The Pottery Drying Room. The brick floor with flues is exposed. Here, pottery was dried before being fired in the kilns. ;Pottery Buildings Five buildings associated with pottery manufacture were identified during the excavation including a pottery drying room, workshops and furnaces. These all appeared to date from the expansion of the pottery works c. 1820. ;The Kilns Six brick built kilns were identified during the course of the excavations. All were fragmentary and truncated by both the modern buildings and later 19th century buildings. All that survived of each was the partial remains of circular structures forming the base of the pottery-firing kiln. A number of rectangular ash pits, evenly spaced along the edges of the main kiln bases, were identified with each kiln. These contained ash and kiln furniture and were used to collect the burnt material falling from the fires above. Surrounding each of the kilns were cobbled floors, which sloped downward to the external edges of the ash pits ‚Äì to allow easy emptying of the content of the ash pits. Three kilns were situated within the probable location of the large circular glass cone, built in c. 1777. Historical reference note that after the glass cone went out of use (c. 1840) a number of small pottery kilns were built within it, reusing the glass cone building to house them. =The Later Pottery works= During the final 50 years of production existing buildings were adapted to new functions and new technology. Steam power was by now incorporated within the factory. The archaeological evidence for the final phase of Verreville Pottery factory offers glimpses into the complex operations of pottery manufacturing such as processing, constructing, drying and firing of vessels. Clay would arrive into the area via a short gauge rail line in the warehouse. It would then be mixed by paddles in water (blunging), placed into tanks and put into the slip drying room to evaporate off the water. After this the clay would be thrown (wedged) to remove air bubbles and moulded or slip cast before placing into the pot drying room and finally into the kilns for firing. Archaeological remains included a slip drying oven, a tunnel furnace and a pot drying room as well as evidence for modifications to the warehouse, courtyard area and workshop and the removal of the rectangular oven.

Goolwa Barrage looking towards Hindmarsh Island  History  Prior to the construction of the barrages, during periods of low river flow, tidal effects and the intrusion of seawater were felt up to upstream from the mouth of the River Murray, approximately as far inland as the river port at present-day Swan Reach.Murray Darling Basin Commission, \\"\\" Retrieved 17 November 2012 From the 1900s, with the advent of large irrigation schemes, landowners along the lower reaches of the river strongly urged for the construction of barrages, primarily to keep the water fresh in the lower reaches of the River Murray, as well as Lake Albert and Lake Alexandrina. In 1931, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission authorised the construction of five barrages. Work commenced in 1935 and was completed in 1940. South Australia's Engineering and Water Supply Department undertook the project, with costs shared equally by the governments of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and the Commonwealth of Australia.

It is the fourth in the Gabriel Allon series. Plot summary An Israeli-run Holocaust research office in Vienna is bombed, resulting in the death of the two female staff and serious injury to the Director. Gabriel Allon, a former assassin for 'The Office' and working under a new identity as an art restorer in Venice, is requested by former director Ari Shamron to go to Vienna to investigate. He is approached by Max Klein, a Holocaust survivor who claims to have information about a man named Ludwig Vogel. After following up this information, Allon finds Klein has been murdered. Allon is apprehended by Austrian security police and expelled from the country. At the Yad Vashem, research reveals that Vogel is probably a Nazi war criminal and former SD officer named Erich Radek. Radek was the engineer behind Aktion 1005, a Nazi operation to conceal the atrocities of the Holocaust by exhuming mass graves and burning the bodies so that no trace of them ever existed. Radek visited half a dozen concentration camps as a part of Aktion 1005, and it is suggested that even he is unaware how many bodies were burned. Allon is disturbed by Radek's resemblance to a painting his mother made of one of her tormentors during the Death Marches. The trail to establish Vogel's true identity takes Allon to the Vatican, where he obtains information that the Vatican would rather not be known: that Radek was one of many escaping Nazis helped and sheltered by the Vatican. The trail further takes him to Argentina where Radek is supposedly buried. Finding the grave and headstone of 'Radek', Allon is nearly killed by an assassin who has been following him, a man known only as \\"the Clockmaker\\". He is rescued by CIA agents who have also been trailing him and the assassin escapes. In Langley the CIA admit that Radek was one of many Nazis recruited to set up an intelligence network in Germany in order to spy on the Soviet Union, laying a false trail through Italy, Syria and Argentina as misdirection. He is also the trustee of several billion dollars worth of investments, based on looted money and assets, which are now controlled by a Swiss banker. These assets were seeded throughout the Swiss and Austrian Alps by Nazi Party members fleeing the Allied invasion, where they were placed in escrow for a generation before National Socialism could be a viable political stance once more. Radek has since retired and is regarded by the CIA as 'disposable'. The CIA agree to cooperate in his kidnap by the Israelis. The Prime Minister of Israel reluctantly approves the operation. With the enforced assistance of the Swiss banker, who controls the secret bank accounts and investments, Radek is enticed into the hands of a kidnap team in Vienna. Drugged and hidden in a van, he is spirited across the border into the Czech Republic and thence into Poland. He is taken to the memorial on the site of the extermination camp at Treblinka, one of the sites he visited as part of Aktion 1005. Allon reveals that he knows Radek has a son, Peter Metzler, who is on the verge of being elected as Chancellor of Austria. Armed with the money from the Swiss bank, Metzler would be able to reintroduce Nazism to Austria unopposed. Allon uses this knowledge to convince Radek to surrender, or else his connection to Metzler will be revealed and Metzler's political career will be ruined. Radek is taken to Israel and placed in solitary confinement. In return for not being tried and executed, he is to prepare a detailed history of Aktion 1005, which he was heavily involved in. In Vienna, Metzler is duly elected. The knowledge that he is actually Radek's son is kept secret, known only to the CIA and The Office while Allon returns to his restoration work in Venice. In Vienna, the Clockmaker receives a parcel bomb and is killed. International titles Portuguese: Morte em Viena. (Death in Vienna). (2009). Sources Silva, Daniel. A Death in Vienna.

This election marked the end of the Lodge family dynasty and the beginning of the Kennedy family dynasty. Republican primary=Candidates=Declared * Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., incumbent U.S. Senator Results Senator Lodge was unopposed for renomination. Democratic primary=Candidates=Declared * John F. Kennedy, U.S. Representative Results Representative Kennedy was unopposed for the Democratic nomination. General election=Campaign= The 1952 Massachusetts Senate election was a contest between two representatives of New England's most prominent political families: the Republican Lodges and the Democratic Kennedys. The Lodges were a much older political dynasty; the family could trace its roots to the original Puritan pioneers who had first settled the state in the early seventeenth century. The Lodges were a \\"Blue blood\\" family, and along with several other Boston-area Protestant families, were considered to be at the apex of Massachusetts High Society, and they had been prominent in Boston political and business circles for generations. Lodge's grandfather, Henry Cabot Lodge Sr., had been a powerful United States Senator from Massachusetts, as well as a close friend and ally of President Theodore Roosevelt; he was also a foe of Woodrow Wilson. His grandson and namesake, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., had first been elected to the U.S. Senate in 1936, when he was the only Republican Senate candidate in the nation to defeat a Democratic incumbent. He was easily reelected in 1942. During the Second World War he had resigned his Senate seat and served in the U.S. Army. In 1946 Lodge reclaimed a Senate seat when he defeated Democratic Senator David Walsh. Lodge's Democratic opponent in the 1952 Senate race was three-term Congressman John F. Kennedy, then only 35 years old. Although the Kennedys were a much newer political dynasty than the Lodges, they had amassed a considerably larger financial fortune, thanks in large part to the business activities of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., Kennedy's father. The Kennedys were Irish Catholics, and in many ways the 1952 Massachusetts Senate campaign was the climax of a longstanding battle between the older Protestant families like the Lodges, who had controlled politics in the Bay State for generations, and the newer Irish Catholic families such as the Kennedys, who for demographic reasons now outnumbered the Protestants. The Kennedys also viewed the 1952 race as something of a grudge match, as Lodge's grandfather had defeated Kennedy's grandfather, Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald, in a 1916 Senate race in Massachusetts. Congressman Kennedy's Senate campaign was managed by his younger brother Robert F. Kennedy, who would perform the same function for his brother in the 1960 presidential campaign. Kennedy launched his campaign early in 1952 and made an intensive effort, by election day in November 1952 he had visited every city, town, and village in Massachusetts at least once. He also collected a record number of signatures for his petition for office, assembling a petition of over a quarter-million signatures. Many of those who signed the petition would later become campaign volunteers or workers for Kennedy in their hometowns. A famous innovation by the Kennedys in the 1952 Senate race were a series of \\"tea parties\\" sponsored by Kennedy's mother and sisters in the fall. Congressman Kennedy attended each of the tea parties and shook hands and charmed the voters (usually female) who were present; it is estimated that a total of 70,000 voters attended the tea parties, which was roughly his margin of victory over Lodge. Lodge, meanwhile, neglected his Senate campaign for most of 1952. Instead, he focused on persuading Dwight D. Eisenhower, the popular World War II general, to run for and win the Republican presidential nomination over Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft, the leader of the party's conservatives. Lodge, a moderate and internationalist, strongly disagreed with Taft's isolationist foreign-policy views and felt that Taft could not win a presidential election. Lodge served as Eisenhower's campaign manager and played a key role in helping Eisenhower to beat Taft and win the Republican nomination. However, Lodge's prominent role in defeating Taft angered many of Taft's supporters in Massachusetts, and they vowed revenge. Congressman Kennedy privately courted many of Taft's more prominent backers in Massachusetts, and some of them, such as Basil Brewer, the publisher of the New Bedford Standard-Times, supported Kennedy over Lodge in their newspapers and editorials. When the usually Democratic-leaning but financially unstable Boston Post planned to endorse Lodge, Joseph Kennedy arranged for a $500,000 loan so the paper would endorse his son; John Kennedy stated that \\"we had to buy that fucking paper or I'd have been licked.\\" Kennedy and Lodge engaged in one public debate, which was held on radio; the debate was generally considered a draw, although some observers felt that Kennedy's ability to hold his own with the older and more distinguished Lodge gave him the advantage. The nationally-known and Catholic Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin refused to campaign for Lodge, a fellow Republican, due to his friendship with the Kennedy family. McCarthy was popular among many Catholic voters in Massachusetts due to his Communist-hunting activities in Congress; William F. Buckley Jr. believed that Lodge probably would have won the election with McCarthy's help.The Kennedys. American Experience. Boston, Massachusetts: WGBH. 2009. On the weekend before the election Eisenhower visited Boston and energetically campaigned for Lodge, but it was not enough. Although Eisenhower carried Massachusetts by over 200,000 votes, Kennedy narrowly upset Lodge, winning by 70,000 votes and three percentage points. =Results= Results by county Kennedy: Lodge: :Source: OurCampaigns.com Aftermath Kennedy's narrow victory marked the end of the Lodge dynasty and beginning of the Kennedy dynasty. Since January 1953 no member of the Lodge family has held political office in Massachusetts, and the family has largely retired from politics. Conversely, the Kennedy family controlled the Senate seat they won in 1952 from January 1953 until Ted Kennedy's death in August 2009, as John Kennedy, family friend Benjamin A. Smith II, and then Ted Kennedy each held the seat. Lodge served for eight years as President Eisenhower's United Nations Ambassador. In the 1960 presidential election, he was Richard Nixon's running mate, but the Democratic ticket of Senators Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson won the election. Lodge's son George C. Lodge lost the 1962 Massachusetts Senate race to Ted Kennedy, the last time that the two families opposed one another in a political campaign.

Synopsis Ting-Xing Ye was the fourth daughter of a factory owner, and she and her siblings were branded as the children of capitalists and persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. By the age of thirteen, both Ye's parents had died. The Cultural Revolution then tore the remaining family members apart. Along with millions of other Chinese youths, Ye was \\"sent down\\" from the city for labor reform on a prison farm, where she was subjected to humiliating psychological torture. Later, Ye was accepted into Beijing University where she studied English before being assigned to the Foreign Ministry as a translator for the delegations of such dignitaries as Queen Elizabeth II, Ronald Reagan and Imelda Marcos. Ye left China for good in 1987, when she defected to Canada. =Domestic abuse= In addition to describing her life in Communist China before and during the Cultural Revolution, Ye also writes about the domestic abuse she suffered during her first marriage. Ye and her first husband had one daughter, as permitted by the Chinese One Child Policy. Later, Ye was forced to abort a second pregnancy as it was not permitted by government policy. Ye describes how her husband repeatedly beat her in front of her daughter, and insisted that a close male friend share their cramped living quarters. Ye became increasingly estranged from her husband and spent significant periods of time apart from him during her postgraduate studies in Beijing. During her studies, Ye fell in love with her Canadian English teacher, William E. Bell, and eventually defected to the West to be with him, gaining permission to leave China under the guise of a fully paid scholarship to York University in Canada. However, to do so, she had to leave her daughter in the custody of her husband. When it became clear that Ye did not intend to return permanently to China, her husband denied her access to her daughter, changing her name and moving to a new, secret address to avoid the possibility of contact with Ye. Ye ends her memoir with her descriptions of how, as a Canadian citizen, she continues to attempt to contact her daughter, hoping one day to take her to Canada.  Reception  A Leaf in the Bitter Wind received positive reviews from professional critics, who praised the book's ability to engross readers despite the difficult subject matter. The Barrie Examiner described it as \\"fascinating yet horrifying\\", while a review appearing in Cityview called it \\"a page-turner that can be enjoyed as exquisite grassroots history, or as the simple story of one woman‚Äôs triumph over brutish odds\\". Writing for the Ottawa Citizen, Patrick Kavanagh claimed that \\"Ting-Xing Ye tells her story with such vividness of imagery and such a galloping momentum that the narrative reads like splendid fiction\\".

July 30, 2012.Hennessey, Kathleen. \\"Obama related to legendary Virginia slave, genealogists say\\", Los Angeles Times. July 30, 2012.  Unsubstantiated claims that presidents have/had African ancestry  Claims that certain U.S. presidents other than Barack Obama had African or African-American ancestry have been made by the historian William Estabrook Chancellor, amateur historian J. A. Rogers, ophthalmologist Leroy William Vaughn,Dr. Leroy Vaughn, Black People & Their Place in History and Auset BaKhufu. All but Chancellor base their theories chiefly on the work of J. A. Rogers, who apparently self- published a pamphlet in 1965 claiming that five presidents of the United States, widely accepted as white, also had African ancestry.Rogers, J. A., The Five Negro Presidents: According to What White People Said They Were (St. Petersburg, Fla.: Helga M. Rogers, 1965; ). Vaughn's and BaKhufu's books also appear to have been self-published. Vaughn's publisher, Lulu, advertised a self-publication service at its home page, as accessed February 21, 2013. Historians' and biographers' studies of these presidents have not supported such claims, nor have the claims been published in any peer-reviewed journal. These authors are generally ignored by scholars. They repeat each other's material and are classified as \\"rumormongers and amateur historians.\\" Vaughn and BaKhufu have added little substantive research to their claims, although there has been extensive new documentation of race relations by others in the decades since Rogers published his pamphlet. = Thomas Jefferson = Vaughn and others claim Thomas Jefferson's mother Jane Randolph Jefferson was of mixed-race ancestry. The academic consensus does not support such claims. In her recent analyses of historical evidence about the Hemings and Jeffersons, for example, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed makes no claim of African descent in the Randolph family.Annette Gordon-Reed, The Hemingses of Monticello and Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. Specifically, Vaughn says, \\"The chief attack on Jefferson was in a book written by Thomas Hazard in 1867 called The Johnny Cake Papers. Hazard interviewed Paris Gardiner, who said he was present during the 1796 presidential campaign, when one speaker states that Thomas Jefferson was a mean-spirited son of a half-breed Indian squaw and a Virginia mulatto father.\\" An overlapping claim is that, in an 18th-century Presidential campaign, someone speaking against Jefferson's candidacy and in favor of that of John Adams accused Jefferson of being \\"half Injun, half nigger, half Frenchman\\"Nock, Albert Jay, Jefferson (N.Y.: Hill & Wang (American Century ser.), 1st Am.

The Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which owns and operates Monticello, the major public history site on Jefferson, characterizes Jefferson's parents this way: \\"His father Peter Jefferson was a successful planter and surveyor and his mother Jane Randolph a member of one of Virginia's most distinguished families.\\" They describe the quote in The Johnny Cake Papers as one frequently repeated, but it is attributed in written sources to the 1800 rather than the 1796 election campaign and clearly is one made by political opponents. The Johnny Cake Papers were a collection of folk tales published in 1879, not 1867, and only one tale commented on Jefferson. Dixon Wecter, in his essay \\"Thomas Jefferson, The Gentle Radical,\\" discusses various portrayals of Jefferson by his political enemies, and mentions that \\"the Jonnycake [sic] Papers later burlesqued such caricatures...\\" = Andrew Jackson = Andrew Jackson referred to a charge that his \\"Mother ... [was] held to public scorn as a prostitute who intermarried with a Negro, and [that his] ... eldest brother [was] sold as a slave in Carolina.\\"Letters from Andrew Jackson to R. K.

Less specific was a rumor of Jackson having \\"colored blood\\", meaning having \\"Negro\\" ancestry;Both quotations: Jacobson, David J., The Affairs of Dame Rumor (N.Y.: Rinehart & Co., 1948), p. 190. this rumor was unproven. President Jackson's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738.Gullan, Harold I., First Fathers: The Men Who Inspired Our Presidents (Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons, 2004; ; ; ). Retrieved January 14, 2010. Scholars Hendrik Booraem, Robert Remini, and H. W.

Vol. 1 (1999); The Papers of Andrew Jackson. Vol. 1, 1770‚Äì1803 (1980); H. W. Brands, Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times (2006). = Abraham Lincoln = Abraham Lincoln's mother Nancy Hanks was claimed to be of African descent (Ethiopian). According to historian William E. Barton, a rumor \\"current in various forms in several sections of the South\\" was that Lincoln's biological father was Gorge Enloe, which Barton dismissed as \\"false\\". According to Doug Wead, Enloe publicly denied this connection to Lincoln but is reported to have privately confirmed it. Another claim was that Lincoln was \\"part Negro\\",Jacobson, David J., The Affairs of Dame Rumor (N.Y.: Rinehart & Co., 1948), p. 191, citing Burr, Chauncey, Catechism, the latter referencing a \\"pamphlet by a western author adducing evidence\\" for the claim. but that was unproven.Sandburg, Carl, Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years (N.Y.: Harcourt, Brace,1928), vol. 2, p. 381 (in chap.champ;154).Coyle, David Cushman, Ordeal of the Presidency (Washington, D.C.: Public Affairs Press, 1960), p. 155 (author graduate of Princeton & Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute). According to Lincoln's law partner William H. Herndon, Lincoln had \\"very dark skin\\"Hertz, Emanuel, The Hidden Lincoln: from the Letters and Papers of William H. Herndon (N.Y.: Viking Press, February 1938), p. 413. although \\"his cheeks were leathery and saffron-colored\\"Hertz, Emanuel, The Hidden Lincoln, op. cit., p. 414. and \\"his face was ... sallow,\\" and \\"his hair was dark, almost black\\".Hertz, Emanuel, The Hidden Lincoln, op. cit., p. 414 and see p. 413 (\\"dark hair\\").

The Charleston Mercury described him as being \\"of ... the dirtiest complexion\\".Taylor, Coley, & Samuel Middlebrook, The Eagle Screams, op. cit., p. 106 and see p. 109. = Warren G. Harding = Warren G. Harding was said to have African ancestry; one claim was by his political opponent, a controversial and racist historian, William Estabrook Chancellor. Chancellor said Harding's father was a mulatto and Harding's great-grandmother was black. During Harding's campaign, Democratic opponents spread rumors that Harding's great-great-grandfather was a West Indian black and that other blacks might be found in his family tree.Russell, Francis, The Shadow of Blooming Grove‚ÄìWarren G. Harding In His Times (Easton Press, 1962; ), p. 372. Chancellor publicized rumors, based on supposed family research, but perhaps reflecting no more than local gossip.Russell, Francis, The Shadow of Blooming Grove, op. cit., pp. 403‚Äì405. In an era when the \\"one-drop rule\\" would classify a person with any African ancestry as black, and black people in the South had been effectively disenfranchised, Harding's campaign manager responded, \\"no family in the state (of Ohio) has a clearer, a more honorable record than the Hardings', a blue- eyed stock from New England and Pennsylvania, the finest pioneer blood.\\"Russell, Francis, The Shadow of Blooming Grove, op. cit., p. 404. \\"Many biographers have dismissed the rumors of Harding's mixed-race family as little more than a political scandal and Chancellor himself as a Democratic mudslinger and racist ideologue.\\" According to Chancellor, Harding got his only academic degree from Iberia College, which had been \\"founded to educate fugitive slaves.\\"Murphy, P. (1993), Making the Connections: Women, Work, and Abuse. PMD Press, p. xxxi. The college was founded by abolitionist supporters in the Presbyterian Church in Ohio for students of both genders and all races. > When asked directly about Chancellor's account, Harding did not make any > effort to deny that he may have had an African-American ancestor. He said he > did not know and demonstrated that it was not a significant issue. The rumors may have been sustained by a statement Harding allegedly made to newspaperman James W. Faulkner on the subject, which he perhaps meant to be dismissive: \\"How do I know, Jim? One of my ancestors may have jumped the fence.\\"Adams, Samuel Hopkins, Incredible Era: The Life and Times of Warren Gamaliel Harding (Houghton Mifflin, 1939; ), p. 280. However, while there are gaps in the historical record, studies of his family tree have not found evidence of an African-American ancestor.Millner, Gloria, Warren G. Harding, Cleveland Live, February 4, 2008, retrieved December 23, 2010. In 2015 genetic testing of Harding's descendants determined, with more than a 95% percent chance of accuracy, that he lacked sub-Saharan African forebears within four previous generations. = Calvin Coolidge = Calvin Coolidge's mother Victoria Moor was claimed to be of a mixed-race family in Vermont. Vaughn noted that her surname was derived from \\"Moor\\", a European term for people of North Africa. He did not note that another meaning of her surname is the landscape feature of moor or bog. People's surnames were often based on such landscape features when surnames became generally adopted in 14th century England. Moor/Moore is a common name in England, Scotland, and Ireland. = Dwight D. Eisenhower = Dwight D. Eisenhower's mother was said to be of mixed blood from Africa and mulatto. However, historians and biographers of Eisenhower had documented his parents' German, Swiss and English ancestry and long history in America. Some of his immigrant ancestors settled in Pennsylvania in 1741 and after, migrated west to Kansas.Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum , includes Home and Tomb, and photo of parents, Official website, accessed 30 January 2009.

Any postal address gets a unique eight-letter code, the Sedamo address code, which can be used to retrieve the original address in native writing.  Background  Especially people from the Asian world face the problem that Westerners cannot write postal addresses in Asian scripts. Though work-arounds exist (such as writing the address using a romanization), these are error-prone and slow down the postal delivery, due to two reasons: (1) Romanisations of Chinese, Japanese, Thai etc. contains ambiguities, thus, a romanised address cannot be re- translated into the original language. (2) The postmen in the destination countries are not used to recognise addresses written in a foreign (Latin) alphabet. (The situation can be compared to a US-American mailman who has to decipher an address written in Chinese transcription.) The service d¬¥adresse mondial offers an easy way to ensure correctly written and formatted addresses. The address can be retrieved from the sedamo web site as an image (bitmap) and can be printed directly onto an envelope or address label. The letter-sending user has not to install any special software or foreign language font. The service d¬¥adresse mondial is operated by the Cross-Cultural Communication Club (CCCC), a charity registered in London, UK. Using sedamo via the web site is for free; the operation is financed by donations.  Usage  In the first step, the receiver looks up the sedamo address code of the destination address. This code is forwarded to the sender. In the second step, the sender uses the code to print out the foreign address in an international format (as recommended by the Universal Postal Union). The sedamo system automatically generates a romanisation of any address. This romanisation can be used if an express company only accepts addresses written in Latin.  The sedamo Address Code  The sedamo address code consists of eight letters, e.g., CT-QP-ED-TP (which is the code for the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests inside the Temple of Heaven, Beijing, PRC). The dashes are for better readability only and can be omitted. The code may contain any Latin letter but \\"I\\" (which can be mistaken for \\"1\\" or \\"J\\"), N (similar to \\"M\\"), \\"O\\" (\\"0\\"), \\"S\\" (\\"5\\"), \\"V\\" (\\"U\\" or \\"W\\"), and \\"Z\\" (\\"2\\"). The code contains a check digit, simple errors such as a single mistyped letter, or the permutation of two successive letters does not lead to a wrong address but an error message. Moreover, neighbouring addresses get strongly different codes which shall prevent mistakes.Technical Documentation of the service d'adresse mondial, sedamo version: 1, document version: 15. Published by: Cross-Cultural Communication Club, Ltd., London, UK. (PDF file: http://sedamo.info/static/sedamo_technical_documentation.pdf) The sedamo address code describes the address, not a receiver (person or company). The only exception is the code AA-AA-AA-AA which directs to the address of the sedamo division of the Cross-Cultural Communication Club. To mark sender's and receiver's address codes, a double arrow should be used: AA-AA-AA-AA >> CT-QP- ED-TP. For automation purposes, the CCCC suggests to print the code in Code 39 barcode with a leading \\"%+\\" (percent sign followed by plus sign) for the receiver's code and a \\"%-\\" (percent sign followed by minus sign) for the sender's code without dashes.

A bishop, however, had little chance of keeping anything if the queen or one of her favourites wanted it.

Born into a wealthy Quaker family in Horsham, Sussex, he was the discoverer of the 'Great Horsham Iguanodon'. Having started life pursuing a medical career he was able to devote more time to his fossil hunting from 1834. It was in that year that his father died and left him considerable property interests. As early as 1836 he contributed to Howard Dudley's history of Horsham with a paragraph on his work. Religion Bax Holmes was born in Horsham on 3 May 1803, the first son of Joseph Holmes, an active Quaker. He was married on 19 October 1826 to his third cousin Mary Burns of Chichester at which time his occupation was recorded as \\"chemist and druggist\\" of Horsham. As a Quaker in these times Bax Holmes was still regarded as a dissenter from the mainstream Church of England, even though the religious Act of Toleration had been passed in 1689. In 1834, for refusing to pay the church rates of 4s 10¬Ωd (2007: ¬£19) he had two arm chairs valued at ¬£3 9s 0d (2007: ¬£276) removed. Fossil collecting Bax Holmes is perhaps best known for his discovery of the Great Horsham Iguanodon, a plant eating dinosaur, in building works on the future site of the Royal & Sun Alliance (now RSA) headquarters. In 1840 a stone was uncovered while building the Chapel of Ease, later to become St Marks Church. Bax Holmes identified them as fossilised iguanodon bones, the largest found since the name was coined by Gideon Mantell of Lewes some 15 years earlier. The bones were used by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins in 1854 when creating the dinosaur models for Sydenham Park. A record of Bax Holmes' work is preserved in the form of 34 letters to fellow fossil expert Richard Owen, with whom Bax Holmes was in correspondence throughout his life. These letters are held in the Owen Correspondence collection at the Natural History Museum. Legacy The Grade I Iguanodon sculptures still on display in Crystal Palace Park South London, though no longer considered an accurate reconstruction from the fossils George Bax Holmes died on 31 March 1887 and is buried at the Friends Meeting House in Worthing Road, Horsham. Today his gravestone is in use as a paving slab and can be seen at the start of the path to the left of the central entrance. His death is noted in the Quaker's Annual Monitor and the Horsham Advertiser, dated 2 April 1887, published an obituary. After Bax Holmes died his daughter sold his collection of 767 (some say 764) fossils to the Corporation of Brighton for ¬£55 and they later went on display at the Booth Museum of Natural History. Until recently they lay in store there until being returned to Horsham Museum for a long term display. It is believed that Bax Holmes lived in the Causeway next door to the current museum and the bones have almost come home.

The version of the IFS run at ECMWF is often referred to as the \\"ECMWF\\" or the \\"European model\\" in North America, to distinguish it from the American GFS.  Mechanism  It comprises a spectral atmospheric model with a terrain-following vertical coordinate system coupled to a 4D-Var data assimilation system. In 1997 the IFS became the first operational forecasting system to use 4D-Var. Both ECMWF and M√©t√©o-France use the IFS to make operational weather forecasts, but using a different configuration and resolution (the M√©t√©o-France configuration is referred to as ARPEGE). It is one of the predominant global medium-range models in general use worldwide; its most prominent rivals in the 6‚Äì10 day medium range include the American Global Forecast System (GFS), the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM and GDPS) and the UK Met Office Unified Model. = Variants = ECMWF runs the IFS in several configurations. The highest resolution \\"HRES\\" configuration is run every twelve hours out to ten days with a horizontal resolution of 9 km using 137 layers in the vertical. The 51-member ensemble system \\"ENS\\" is also run every twelve hours out to 15 days with a horizontal resolution of 18 km and 91 layers in the vertical. The ECMWF also runs a coarser version of the IFS out 45 days; this version is run weekly, with output in five-day intervals. There is also a version that runs out one year. All model versions except HRES are coupled to the ocean model NEMO.  Usage  Many ECMWF member states use ECMWF global forecasts to provide boundary conditions for their own higher resolution, limited domain forecasts. ECMWF forecasts are free to the national weather services of its member states, but a fee is charged to commercial users, while limited operational data (select variables from the HRES and ENS out ten days) is available direct to consumers under the noncommercial Creative Commons license prohibiting derivative works (CC-BY ND NC). In contrast, output from the GFS and GEM/GDPS is freely licensed to all users. The full IFS source code is available only to the national weather services of ECMWF member states, but the source code for the atmosphere model is available to other non-commercial users in the form of the OpenIFS.

Its focus is on Victorian taxidermy especially of British birds, insects, as well as fossils, bones and skeletons. It is part of \\"Royal Pavilion & Museums, Brighton and Hove\\". Admission to the museum is free. History Butterflies exhibit in the museum The Booth Museum was opened in 1874 by naturalist and collector Edward Thomas Booth. Booth was particularly interested in birds, and it was his ambition, though not fully realized, to collect examples of every bird species found in Britain. Each species collected would include a male, a female, a juvenile and any plumage variations. He presented his bird collection in Victorian-style dioramas that attempted to recreate how birds would appear in the setting of their natural habitat. Booth was one of the pioneers of such diorama displays, and his museum, the first to present its collection in this manner in Britain, influenced how other museums would present animal species in their displays. Booth donated the museum to the city in 1890 with the proviso that the display of over 300 dioramas should not be altered, and it was opened under Brighton civic ownership in 1891. In 1971 the Booth became a Museum of Natural History. The museum continues to feature the dioramas of British birds in their habitat settings, as well as collections of butterflies, and British fossils and animal bones. Other items have been added to the museum's collection through the years, and it is now home to a collection of 525,000 insects, 50,000 minerals and rocks, 30,000 plants and 5,000 microscopic slides. Several of the exhibits were used as references for CGI animations in the 2019 television adaptation of the fantasy drama His Dark Materials. Exhibits A bird diorama at the Booth Museum of Natural History The museum's collection of taxidermied birds is one of the largest in the country. The museum also has some skeletons of mammal species, including primates, whale as well as extinct species such as dodo and woolly rhinoceros. Also included in the display are fossils and minerals. Insects displayed include over 650 types of butterfly. Victorian curiosities such as a hoax merman and a \\"Toad in the Hole\\" are also found in the museum.

Purposes The bill was a counter-proposal to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 introduced by President Barack Obama. HR 470 proposes to stimulate the economy without new government spending by implementing a permanent five-percentage point income tax cut for all taxpayers; it also would make permanent current capital gains and dividend tax rates at 15% (current law will allowing rates to rise after 2010). The bill proposes to index capital gains for inflation, and reduce the corporate tax rate to 25% from 35%, and repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax for individuals. The bill proposes a one-percent reduction in all non-defense discretionary spending for the fiscal year ending in 2009. Representative Price of Georgia, the RSC chair, described the Democratic proposal, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as \\"the non- stimulus plan\\" and claimed it \\"simply won't work\\" because it has no market incentives to create jobs.

It is based on a story by Alistair MacLean. A book based on MacLean's story by John Denis was the first in the series of UNACO books. Plot Criminal mastermind Mr. Smith (Keir Dullea) is being pursued by Malcolm Philpott (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), the head of an international peace organization. Smith draws together a team for a heist including weapons expert Mike Graham (ex-CIA) and thieves Sabrina and Clarence. Sabrina and Clarence secretly work for Philpott. When Mr. Smith captures the Eiffel Tower and kidnaps the mother of the President of the United States (Celia Johnson), Philpott must enlist the help of spies to take him down. Mr. Smith demands a ransom of $30 million without which he will blow up the tower and the President's mother. He has protected the tower from infiltration by stealing four high-power lasers which will shoot anyone entering who is not equipped with a protective device. Cast *Peter Fonda as Mike Graham *Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Malcolm Philpott *Maud Adams as Sabrina Carver *Billy Dee Williams as Clarence Whitlock *Keir Dullea as Mr. Smith *Britt Ekland as Leah *Rachel Roberts as Sonya Kolchinski *Celia Johnson as Mrs Wheeler Production In the early 1970s, a series of films based on MacLean novels had not performed well at the American box office, including When Eight Bells Toll, Puppet on a Chain and Fear Is the Key. MacLean decided to focus on American television, collaborating with producers Peter Snell and Jerry Leider. In 1977 Leider and Snell suggested MacLean write some story ideas for a series. The author prepared eight outlines which dealt with the activities of a crime fighting group, the United Nations Anti-Crime Organization (UNACO). He wrote a 120 page novella called Air Force One is Down about top executives of various oil companies travelling in Air Force One when it is hijacked. The idea was turned down by NBC. MacLean then pitched a number of new ideas to networks, each with a 25-30 page treatment. The Hostage Tower was approved by CBS. The network requested the Eiffel Tower be changed to the Statue of Liberty but MacLean refused, feeling the tower was essential, and CBS ultimately agreed. Filming took twelve weeks starting in October 1979.Alistair MacLean's Eiffel Tower Drama By DAVID LEWIN. New York Times 11 May 1980: D37. The entire film was shot in Paris with three weeks shooting on the tower itself.'The Hostage Tower' Begins Production Work in France Los Angeles Times 15 Nov 1979: g33. Filming dates were arranged so the Tower scenes were shot during the slow season. The film marked Douglas Fairbanks Jnr's return to screen acting after a long absence, although he had regularly appeared on stage. \\"I've been away so long that nothing feels tempting,\\" he said during the shoot. \\"But this one has a quality team and a sense of sharing that is really creative.\\"Ex-Swashbuckler Before TV Cameras: SWASHBUCKLER SWASHBUCKLER Hall, William. Los Angeles Times 4 Jan 1980: e14. Fontana Books expressed interest in publishing a novelised version of the story. MacLean was busy writing Athabasca so John Denis did the job. The results were well received and Denis then did a novelisation of Air Force One is Down. Britt Ekland and Maud Adams were previously seen together as Bond girls in The Man with the Golden Gun. Rachel Roberts was in a great deal of personal turmoil during filming and was worried she would be able to perform. She got through the film with minimal trouble. However she committed suicide not long after filming. Reception The Los Angeles Times called it \\"a preposterous but rather charming piece of escapism.\\"THE TUBE TONIGHT: ESCAPE VIA 'HOSTAGE TOWER' Brown, James. Los Angeles Times 13 May 1980: h6. Follow Up The roles of Mike Graham and Sabrina Carver are later reprised by Pierce Brosnan and Alexandra Paul in TV adaptations of Death Train and Night Watch, both UNACO novels written for the screen. Death Train also featured Clarke Peters taking over as C. W. Whitlock and Patrick Stewart as Malcolm Philpott. A mini series based on Air Force One is Down came out in 2012.

Philippe- Fran√ßois-Joseph Le Bas (4 November 1764, Fr√©vent, Pas-de-Calais ‚Äì 28 July 1794, Paris) was a French politician. Biography The son of a notary, intendant to the prince de Rache, avocat to the parliament of 1789, companion and collaborator of Saint-Just, Le Bas was elected d√©put√© to the National Convention for the Pas-de-Calais in 1792, sitting among the Montagnards. A discreet, cold, and loyal representative, he voted for King Louis XVI's death and against the sentence at his trial (i.e., against the people's appeal). Le Bas and Duquesnoy were delegated to the arm√©e du Nord in August 1793, and Le Bas proceeded with the arrest of generals Richardot and O'Moran for inability. A member of the Committee of General Security, he was among those close to Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint-Just, who had a brief and discreet relation with his sister Henriette. He and Saint-Just were made the Convention's commissioners to the armies and set out on this mission to eastern France, where he reorganized the army after its reverses at Wissembourg. Saint-Just and Le Bas were also later sent to reorganize the arm√©e du Nord by the Committee of Public Safety in the face of an attempted return by Austrian forces after Wattignies - it was this reorganisation that made possible the victory at Fleurus. Since 1 June he was appointed as the director of the \\"√âcole de Mars\\", formerly known as the √âcole Militaire. =Death= Faithful to Robespierre, Augustin Robespierre and Le Bas demanded to share his fate. The five deputies were taken to the Committee of General Security, questioned and then escorted to different prisons; LeBas to the Conciergerie. The mayor of the Commune ordered the janitors to refuse any member of the Convention. LeBas, as well as the others gathered in the H√¥tel de Ville on 9 Thermidor. When the anti-Robespierristes under Barras and L√©onard Bourdon broke into the main room of the townhall (where Le Bas had taken refuge with Maximilien Robespierre, Augustin Robespierre, St-Just and Couthon) LeBas committed suicide by pistol in the early morning of 10 Thermidor. Marriage and issue He married Elisabeth Duplay, daughter of Maurice Duplay, Robespierre's landlord in Paris, and their son was Philippe Le Bas (1794‚Äì1860), who would be Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte's preceptor until 1827 then director of the library of the Sorbonne (from 1844 to 1860), a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1838‚Äì60) and president of the Institut de France (from 1858).

The American-football-sized dish is then smoked or baked. It became known after being posted on the BBQ Addicts blog, and spread to the mainstream press with numerous stories discussing the dish. In time, the articles began to discuss the Internet \\"buzz\\" itself. The Bacon Explosion is made of bacon, sausage, barbecue sauce, and barbecue seasoning or rub. The bacon is assembled in a weave to hold the sausage, sauce, and crumbled bacon. Once rolled, the Bacon Explosion is cooked (either smoked or baked), basted, cut, and served. The Bacon Explosion's creators produced a cookbook featuring the recipes which ultimately won the 2010 Gourmand World Cookbook Awards for \\"Best Barbecue Book in the World\\". The Bacon Explosion also won at the 2013 Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival. History and origin Jason Day and Aaron Chronister posted the dish in December 2008 on their \\"BBQ Addicts\\" blog. It quickly became an Internet phenomenon, generating more than 500,000 hits and 16,000 links to the blog, and was even included on political blogs because \\"Republicans like meat.\\" There are fan clubs and follow-up videos of various attempts to create the dish. The inventors are experienced barbecue competition participants from Kansas City, and compete in cook-offs as the Burnt Finger BBQ team. According to the Telegraph, \\"They came up with the delicacy after being challenged on Twitter to create the ultimate bacon recipe.\\" They christened their innovation the \\"Bacon Explosion: The BBQ Sausage Recipe of all Recipes.\\" The Bacon Explosion is similar to a number of previously published recipes. Day and Chronister do not claim to have invented the concept, but assert the term \\"Bacon Explosion\\" as a trademark. Preparation Preparing a Bacon Explosion \\"requires the minimum of culinary talent\\" and the ingredient list is short. It is made from of thick cut bacon, 2 pounds of Italian sausage, one jar of barbecue sauce, and one jar of barbecue rub/seasoning. The Bacon Explosion is constructed by weaving the bacon together to serve as a base. The base is seasoned and followed by the layering of sausage meat and crumbled bacon.

He was educated at Charterhouse School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated M.A. in 1719 and became Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1720. He became Bishop of Peterborough in 1747, and was made preceptor to the future George III, then Prince of Wales, in 1752. In 1757 be became Bishop of Salisbury, and in 1761 Bishop of Winchester. Life He was the son of Stremer Thomas, a colonel in the Guards Regiment, born on 17 August 1696 at Westminster, and educated at Charterhouse school. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, on 28 March 1713, and took the degrees of B.A. 1716, M.A. 1719, B.D. 1727, and D.D. 1731. In 1720 he was elected fellow of All Souls' College, and, having been disappointed of a living promised to him by a friend of his father, took a curacy in London. Here his preaching attracted attention; in 1731 he was given a prebend in St Paul's Cathedral, and was presented by the dean and chapter in 1733 to the rectory of St. Bene't and St. Peter, Paul's Wharf, which he retained till 1757. In 1742 Thomas succeeded to a canonry of St. Paul's, and held it till 1748. In 1742 he had been made one of George II's chaplains, and preached the Boyle lectures, which he did not publish; and, having secured the favour of the king when Prince of Wales, he was given the bishopric of Peterborough, and consecrated at Lambeth Palace on 4 October 1747. In 1752 Thomas was selected to succeed Thomas Hayter as preceptor to the young Prince of Wales, later George III, James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave being governor; these appointments were directed against the influence of the Princess Dowager. In 1757 he followed John Gilbert as bishop of Salisbury(and ex officio Chancellor of the Order of the Garter) and also as clerk of the closet, and in 1761 was translated to Winchester in succession to Benjamin Hoadly. Thomas died at Winchester Palace, on 1 May 1781, and was buried in Winchester Cathedral. There are portraits of the bishop at the palaces of Salisbury and Lambeth, and a fine mezzotint engraving (three-quarter length in robes of the Garter) by R. Sayer from a picture by Benjamin Wilson, published on 24 January 1771. Works John Thomas published about ten works, mainly sermons. Family Thomas married Susan, daughter of Thomas Mulso of Twywell, Northamptonshire; her brother Thomas married the bishop's sister, and their daughter, Mrs. Hester Chapone, spent much of her time after her husband's death with her uncle and aunt at Farnham Castle.

It was Per √Öhlin's first fully animated feature film, since his earlier films Out of an Old Man's Head and Dunderklumpen! had both used a mix of animation and live action. The full English title is The Journey to Melonia: Fantasies of Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. It won two Guldbagge Awards for Best Creative Achievement (a category with three awards for technical achievements without their own categories). The first was to √Öhlin for the animation and the second to Bj√∂rn Isf√§lt for the music.Guldbaggen: Vinnare 1981-90 Swedish Film Institute Plot The beautiful paradise island Melonia is inhabited by the sorcerer Prospero with his daughter Miranda, the albatross Ariel, the good-natured vegetable-faced gardener Caliban and William the dog- nosed poet. They live a generally peaceful life, except for Caliban who has to work hard with the garden. A few miles away lies the dark island Plutonia, where the greedy capitalists Slug and Slagg rule. Once as green and flourishing as Melonia, Plutonia is now perceived as hell on earth, where children are forced to, under slave conditions, build weapons and tools of war, which Slug and Slagg believe is the way of the future. With Plutonia's resources nearly exhausted, Slug and Slagg turn their gaze on the unexploited Melonia, scheming to take it over with a gigantic drill. The movie begins with one of the child slaves, a boy named Ferdinand, escaping from Plutonia in a box, and ends up on Melonia, where Miranda and Prospero nurse him back to health. Prospero has just finished a magical growth elixir (humorously labelled \\"power soup\\" for the remainder of the movie), which Caliban is entrusted. Slug and Slagg kidnap Caliban and bring him to Plutonia. Ferdinand, Miranda, Prospero and some others journey to Plutonia in order to free Caliban, which eventually turns into a quest to free Ferdinand's enslaved friends. Eventually, Miranda helps the children escape by transforming them into birds and transporting them into an old theater, where William the poet is making a less than successful attempt at staging Shakespeare's The Tempest. After breaking out of his prison, the thirsty Caliban thoughtlessly drinks the elixir. Slug and Slagg, encouraged by Caliban's growth, attempt to coax him into working for them, but their rants of superiority by arms falls upon deaf ears. They then attempt to destroy Caliban using the great drill, but he easily lifts it off the ground and plunges it into the floor, causing the island to sink to the bottom of the ocean in a gigantic maelstrom. Slug and Slagg are unable to escape the maelstrom and as they do not appear again, it's safe to assume that they sink to the bottom and drown. The theater almost sinks as well, but is saved by Caliban. Prospero loses his magical powers, but accepts it readily, knowing that everybody's power will replace his magic. He frees Caliban and Ariel from his service, and the movie ends with a singing Ariel flying off into the sunset.

Some critique was given regarding the slow pace and ambiguous tone, making it hard to distinguish whether it was a children's film or aimed for adults. Others complained about the somewhat na√Øve message. The most negative review came from Variety, where Keith Keller wrote: \\"The Voyage to Melonia by Per √Öhlin, Sweden's past master of animated films, probably has aimed over everybody's head with this go at The Tempest.

Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.  Definitions  Architecture can mean: * A general term to describe buildings and other physical structures.Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993), Oxford, * The art and science of designing buildings and (some) nonbuilding structures. * The style of design and method of construction of buildings and other physical structures. * A unifying or coherent form or structure.Merriam‚ÄìWebster's Dictionary of English Usage, or * Knowledge of art, science, technology, and humanity. * The design activity of the architect, from the macro-level (urban design, landscape architecture) to the micro-level (construction details and furniture). The practice of the architect, where architecture means offering or rendering professional services in connection with the design and construction of buildings, or built environments. Theory of architecture The philosophy of architecture is a branch of philosophy of art, dealing with aesthetic value of architecture, its semantics and relations with development of culture. Many philosophers and theoreticians from Plato to Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Robert Venturi and Ludwig Wittgenstein have concerned themselves with the nature of architecture and whether or not architecture is distinguished from building.‚ÄúIt is not the line that is between two points, but the point that is at the intersection of several lines.‚Äù Deleuze, Gilles. Pourparlers Paris: Minuit, 1990 p. 219 =Historic treatises= The earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is De architectura by the Roman architect Vitruvius in the early 1st century AD.D. Rowland ‚Äì T.N. Howe: Vitruvius. Ten Books on Architecture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1999, According to Vitruvius, a good building should satisfy the three principles of firmitas, utilitas, venustas, commonly known by the original translation ‚Äì firmness, commodity and delight. An equivalent in modern English would be: * Durability ‚Äì a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition * Utility ‚Äì it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used * Beauty ‚Äì it should be aesthetically pleasing According to Vitruvius, the architect should strive to fulfill each of these three attributes as well as possible. Leon Battista Alberti, who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, De re aedificatoria, saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the Golden mean. The most important aspect of beauty was, therefore, an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially, and was based on universal, recognisable truths. The notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th century, with the writing of Vasari.Fran√ßoise Choay, Alberti and Vitruvius, editor, Joseph Rykwert, Profile 21, Architectural Design, Vol. 49 No. 5‚Äì6 By the 18th century, his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects had been translated into Italian, French, Spanish, and English. In the early 19th century, Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin wrote Contrasts (1836) that, as the titled suggested, contrasted the modern, industrial world, which he disparaged, with an idealized image of neo-medieval world. Gothic architecture, Pugin believed, was the only \\"true Christian form of architecture.\\" The 19th-century English art critic, John Ruskin, in his Seven Lamps of Architecture, published 1849, was much narrower in his view of what constituted architecture. Architecture was the \\"art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by men ... that the sight of them\\" contributes \\"to his mental health, power, and pleasure\\".John Ruskin, The Seven Lamps of Architecture, G. Allen (1880), reprinted Dover, (1989) For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance. His work goes on to state that a building is not truly a work of architecture unless it is in some way \\"adorned\\". For Ruskin, a well-constructed, well-proportioned, functional building needed string courses or rustication, at the very least. On the difference between the ideals of architecture and mere construction, the renowned 20th-century architect Le Corbusier wrote: \\"You employ stone, wood, and concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say: This is beautiful. That is Architecture\\".Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture, Dover Publications(1985). Le Corbusier's contemporary Ludwig Mies van der Rohe said \\"Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins.\\" The National Congress of Brazil, designed by Oscar Niemeyer =Modern concepts= The notable 19th-century architect of skyscrapers, Louis Sullivan, promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: \\"Form follows function\\". While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of \\"function\\" in place of Vitruvius' \\"utility\\". \\"Function\\" came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception and enjoyment of a building, not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural. Nunzia Rondanini stated, \\"Through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other human sciences. Through its own particular way of expressing values, architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that, in and of itself, it will promote social development.' To restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art's sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality\\".Rondanini, Nunzia Architecture and Social Change Heresies II, Vol. 3, No. 3, New York, Neresies Collective Inc., 1981. Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are Rationalism, Empiricism, Structuralism, Poststructuralism, Deconstruction and Phenomenology. In the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of sustainability, hence sustainable architecture. To satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable power sources for heating, cooling, water and waste management, and lighting. History=Origins and vernacular architecture= Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (shelter, security, worship, etc.) and means (available building materials and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a craft, and \\"architecture\\" is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft. It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world.

Wexford.JPGYola hut -Tagoat Co. Wexford Ireland =Prehistoric architecture= Early human settlements were mostly rural. Expending economies resulted in the creation of urban areas which in some cases grew and evolved very rapidly, such as that of √áatal H√∂y√ºk in Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan. Neolithic settlements and \\"cities\\" include G√∂bekli Tepe and √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey, Jericho in the Levant, Mehrgarh in Pakistan, Knap of Howar and Skara Brae, Orkney Islands, Scotland, and the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture settlements in Romania, Moldova and Ukraine. =Ancient architecture= In many ancient civilizations such as those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, architecture and urbanism reflected the constant engagement with the divine and the supernatural, and many ancient cultures resorted to monumentality in architecture to represent symbolically the political power of the ruler, the ruling elite, or the state itself. The architecture and urbanism of the Classical civilizations such as the Greek and the Roman evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or empirical ones and new building types emerged. Architectural \\"style\\" developed in the form of the Classical orders. Roman architecture was influenced by Greek architecture as they incorporated many Greek elements into their building practices. Texts on architecture have been written since ancient time. These texts provided both general advice and specific formal prescriptions or canons. Some examples of canons are found in the writings of the 1st-century BCE Roman Architect Vitruvius. Some of the most important early examples of canonic architecture are religious.

File:Segovia - Acueducto 03.jpgRoman aqueduct in Segovia, Spain. =Asian architecture= The architecture of different parts of Asia developed along different lines from that of Europe; Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh architecture each having different characteristics. Indian and Chinese architecture have had great influence on the surrounding regions, while Japanese architecture has not. Buddhist architecture, in particular, showed great regional diversity. Hindu temple architecture, which developed from around the 5th century CE, is in theory governed by concepts laid down in the Shastras, and is concerned with expressing the macrocosm and the microcosm. In many Asian countries, pantheistic religion led to architectural forms that were designed specifically to enhance the natural landscape. In many parts of Asia, even the grandest houses were relatively lightweight structures mainly using wood until recent times, and there are few survivals of great age. Buddhism was associated with a move to stone and brick religious structures, probably beginning as rock-cut architecture, which has often survived very well. Early Asian writings on architecture include the Kao Gong Ji of China from the 7th‚Äì5th centuries BCE; the Shilpa Shastras of ancient India; Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra of Sri Lanka and Araniko of Nepal .

File:Kinkaku3411.jpgKinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion), Kyoto, Japan. =Islamic architecture= Islamic architecture began in the 7th century CE, incorporating architectural forms from the ancient Middle East and Byzantium, but also developing features to suit the religious and social needs of the society. Examples can be found throughout the Middle East, Turkey, North Africa, the Indian Sub-continent and in parts of Europe, such as Spain, Albania, and the Balkan States, as the result of the expansion of the Ottoman Empire.

Ottoman bridge & UNESCO site in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina. =Middle Ages= In Europe during the Medieval period, guilds were formed by craftsmen to organize their trades and written contracts have survived, particularly in relation to ecclesiastical buildings. The role of architect was usually one with that of master mason, or Magister lathomorum as they are sometimes described in contemporary documents. The major architectural undertakings were the buildings of abbeys and cathedrals. From about 900 CE onward, the movements of both clerics and tradesmen carried architectural knowledge across Europe, resulting in the pan-European styles Romanesque and Gothic. Also, a significant part of the Middle Ages architectural heritage is numerous fortifications across the continent. From Balkans to Spain, and from Malta to Estonia, these buildings represent an important part of European heritage. File:Notre Dame de Paris by night.jpgNotre Dame de Paris, France.

File:Photograph of of the Doges Palace in Venice.jpgDoge's Palace, Venice, Italy. =Renaissance and the architect= In Renaissance Europe, from about 1400 onwards, there was a revival of Classical learning accompanied by the development of Renaissance humanism, which placed greater emphasis on the role of the individual in society than had been the case during the Medieval period. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects ‚Äì Brunelleschi, Alberti, Michelangelo, Palladio ‚Äì and the cult of the individual had begun. There was still no dividing line between artist, architect and engineer, or any of the related vocations, and the appellation was often one of regional preference. A revival of the Classical style in architecture was accompanied by a burgeoning of science and engineering, which affected the proportions and structure of buildings. At this stage, it was still possible for an artist to design a bridge as the level of structural calculations involved was within the scope of the generalist.

File:Santa Maria Novella.jpgSanta Maria Novella, Florence, Italy. =Early modern and the industrial age= With the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology, architecture and engineering began to separate, and the architect began to concentrate on aesthetics and the humanist aspects, often at the expense of technical aspects of building design. There was also the rise of the \\"gentleman architect\\" who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes, typified by the many country houses of Great Britain that were created in the Neo Gothic or Scottish baronial styles. Formal architectural training in the 19th century, for example at √âcole des Beaux-Arts in France, gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility. Meanwhile, the Industrial Revolution laid open the door for mass production and consumption. Aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products, once within the province of expensive craftsmanship, became cheaper under machine production. Vernacular architecture became increasingly ornamental. Housebuilders could use current architectural design in their work by combining features found in pattern books and architectural journals.

File:2019 Buenos Aires - Palacio del Congreso de la Naci√≥n Argentina.jpgCongeso Nacional Palace, Buenos Aires, Argentina. =Modernism= Around the beginning of the 20th century, general dissatisfaction with the emphasis on revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern architecture. Notable among these is the Deutscher Werkbund, formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine-made objects. The rise of the profession of industrial design is usually placed here. Following this lead, the Bauhaus school, founded in Weimar, Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis‚Äîthe apex‚Äîof art, craft, and technology. When modern architecture was first practised, it was an avant-garde movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after World War I, pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order. The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functional details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms. Architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright developed organic architecture, in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose, with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being Robie House and Fallingwater. Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Marcel Breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the Industrial Revolution, including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. Fazlur Rahman Khan's development of the tube structure was a technological break-through in building ever higher. By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the International Style, an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's World Trade Center designed by Minoru Yamasaki. File:Bauhaus.JPGThe Bauhaus school building in Dessau, Germany. File:NYC - Guggenheim Museum.jpgGuggenheim Museum, New York City, United States. File:Catedral de Bsb.jpgCathedral of Bras√≠lia, Brazil. File:Sears Tower ss.jpg Willis Tower, Chicago, United States =Postmodernism= Many architects resisted modernism, finding it devoid of the decorative richness of historical styles. As the first generation of modernists began to die after World War II, the second generation of architects including Paul Rudolph, Marcel Breuer, and Eero Saarinen tried to expand the aesthetics of modernism with Brutalism, buildings with expressive sculptural fa√ßades made of unfinished concrete. But an even new younger postwar generation critiqued modernism and Brutalism for being too austere, standardized, monotone, and not taking into account the richness of human experience offered in historical buildings across time and in different places and cultures. One such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and Brutalism is the school of metaphoric architecture, which includes such things as biomorphism and zoomorphic architecture, both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design. While it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of postmodernism, others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of expressionist architecture. Beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s, architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism, with architects like Charles Moore in the United States, Christian Norberg-Schulz in Norway, and Ernesto Nathan Rogers and Vittorio Gregotti, Michele Valori, Bruno Zevi in Italy, who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents. Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials, with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles, from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles. Robert Venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a \\"decorated shed\\" (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside), and upheld it against modernist and brutalist \\"ducks\\" (buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms).

Moreover, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect A design architect is one who is responsible for the design. from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.A project architect is one who is responsible for ensuring the design is built correctly and who administers building contracts ‚Äì in non-specialist architectural practices the project architect is also the design architect and the term refers to the differing roles the architect plays at differing stages of the process. The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many. Modernism and Postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences. Environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue, with a profound effect on the architectural profession. Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in passive solar building design, greener roof designs, biodegradable materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings that seek to meet green building sustainable design principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques. The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this.Other energy efficiency and green building rating systems include Energy Star, Green Globes, and CHPS (Collaborative for High Performance Schools). Concurrently, the recent movements of New Urbanism, metaphoric architecture and New Classical Architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl.Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 23 March 2014. Glass curtain walls, which were the hallmark of the ultra modern urban life in many countries surfaced even in developing countries like Nigeria where international styles had been represented since the mid 20th Century mostly because of the leanings of foreign-trained architects.

Other types of architecture Stourhead in Wiltshire, England, designed by Henry Hoare (1705‚Äì1785) =Landscape architecture= Landscape architecture is the design of outdoor public areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioral, or aesthetic outcomes.Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Susan Jellicoe, The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome. The scope of the profession includes landscape design; site planning; stormwater management; environmental restoration; parks and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a landscape architect. =Interior architecture= Charles Rennie Mackintosh ‚Äì Music Room 1901 Interior architecture is the design of a space which has been created by structural boundaries and the human interaction within these boundaries. It can also be the initial design and plan for use, then later redesign to accommodate a changed purpose, or a significantly revised design for adaptive reuse of the building shell. The latter is often part of sustainable architecture practices, conserving resources through \\"recycling\\" a structure by adaptive redesign. Generally referred to as the spatial art of environmental design, form and practice, interior architecture is the process through which the interiors of buildings are designed, concerned with all aspects of the human uses of structural spaces. Put simply, interior architecture is the design of an interior in architectural terms. =Naval architecture= Body plan of a ship showing the hull form Naval architecture, also known as naval engineering, is an engineering discipline dealing with the engineering design process, shipbuilding, maintenance, and operation of marine vessels and structures.Biran, Adrian; (2003). Ship hydrostatics and stability (1st Ed.) ‚Äì Butterworth-Heinemann. Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or repair). Naval architecture also involves the formulation of safety regulations and damage control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet statutory and non-statutory requirements. =Urban design= Urban design is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of cities, towns, and villages. In contrast to architecture, which focuses on the design of individual buildings, urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, streets and public spaces, whole neighborhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable. Urban design is an interdisciplinary field that utilizes elements of many built environment professions, including landscape architecture, urban planning, architecture, civil engineering and municipal engineering.Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., & de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198. It is common for professionals in all these disciplines to practice urban design. In more recent times different sub- subfields of urban design have emerged such as strategic urban design, landscape urbanism, water-sensitive urban design, and sustainable urbanism. =Metaphorical \\"architectures\\"= \\"Architecture\\" is used as a metaphor for many modern techniques or fields for structuring abstractions.

The character is associated with the Dazzler. She first appeared in Dazzler #22 (December 1982) and was created by writer Danny Fingeroth and artist Frank Springer. She reappears in the X-Men franchise in 2009 as a villain, calling herself Mortis. Fictional character biography Lois London in her original civilian appearance as seen in the Marvel Comics 1980's Handbook. Art by Frank Springer Born Lois Brown, Lois London is the younger half-sister of the mutant recording artist, Dazzler. She was born to Alison's mother, Katherine Blaire, and her lover, Nicholas Brown. At a young age Lois watched her father beat her mother, who spiraled into drug addiction. Eventually, Katherine sobered up and took Lois with her as she fled her abusive lover.Dazzler #21 Katherine took on a new identity, Barbara London, and changed Lois' surname as well. Lois grew up as a normal teenager and attended State University. Despite being a big Dazzler fan, Lois never knew Alison Blaire was her own half-sister, since Barbara was too ashamed to discuss her sordid past.Dazzler #20 =Meeting Dazzler= After Dazzler reunited with Barbara London, Lois introduced herself. Lois, however, was unaware of Dazzler's mutant powers until Alison used them to help the pair escape a building fire. Lois kept Alison's mutant powers a secret.Dazzler #23 Lois soon became a target for trouble as Dazzler's then-enemy, Rogue, attacked Lois in her dorm room. Dazzler, with the help of Luke Cage and Iron Fist, was able to evade Rogue and draw her focus from Lois, as Lois watched helplessly.Dazzler #24 =Powers emerge= Lois soon became plagued by headaches and migraines, which she was hoping was a simple case of mononucleosis. After leaving a Dazzler concert and walking the streets alone, Lois was approached by a hobo. When she attempted to get away, Lois's hand crackled with a mysterious energy. She accidentally touched the hobo with her crackling hand and he suddenly dropped dead. Lois fled to Alison's apartment for safety, confused and panicked over what had occurred. Dazzler decided to take her younger sister and flee New York.Dazzler #26 While stopped at a motel, Lois attacked and killed the motel manager's cat after it scratched her. When her sister found out, she took Lois and fled again. Later, mysterious photos emerged of Lois killing the hobo in New York along with a blackmail message. The blackmailer demanded that the two sisters assassinate a man in California, or else the photos would be given to the police and Lois would be arrested. Fearing what the judicial system would do to a mutant, Alison convinced Lois to go along with the plan.Dazzler #27 Lois's world turned upside down when she discovered the target was her own father, Nicholas Brown. Brown had sent an assistant to search for Lois, but the assistant went rogue and attempted to gain money in blackmailing Lois into killing her own father, his boss. The plan failed, and Brown and Lois were reunited with Dazzler in the middle.Dazzler #28 Although she had been protected by her half-sister and just reunited with an abusive father she barely knew, Lois decided to stay with Brown. Brown, now very wealthy and well-connected in California, offered Lois a sense of security she needed. Lois and Alison parted ways, with Alison angry and hurt.Dazzler #30 =Necrosha= Prior to the events of Necrosha, Lois was still living with her father and the guilt that she killed a man a few years ago. One evening at dinner with her father, he does everything he can to make her feel better, so she pretends everything is fine. While watching the news she sees a report on the X-Men moving to San Francisco and sees her sister Dazzler with the other X-Men. It is revealed that Lois's feelings toward her sister have soured and that she now hates her.X-Necrosha: The Gathering One-Shot One night Lois receives a call from her father's secretary claiming her father is drunk. Lois goes to his office where he calls her a monster and asks for Allison. He blames her for the destruction of their family and slaps her. She turns around and tells him he was the one who destroyed their family, not her, and in a fit of rage kills him. Afraid of what she has done, she tries to kill herself with her powers. Her father's secretary then enters and reveals everything will be fine while trying to calm her down. Eventually it is revealed that Selene has been pretending to be her father's secretary in order to sway Lois to embrace her powers, give in to the pleasure it gives her to kill and turn her back on humanity and any attachments to them. Selene then recruits her to her cause and gives her the name Mortis. As a part of Selene's new Inner Circle, Mortis travels to Selene's birthplace, Rome, and then New York. There, they slaughter the New York branch of the Hellfire Club before going to the ruins of Genosha.X-Necrosha One-Shot When the Inner Circle are dispatched to retrieve the mystical knife necessary for Selene's ritual, Mortis draws first blood when she casually kills Diamond Lil. She then uses her powers against Wolverine, but his healing factor allows him to survive the usually fatal effects. She then confronts her sister, claiming that she hates her.X-Force Vol. 3 #23 Wolfsbane battles Mortis during the final fight, commenting how Lois smells like Alison. Furious, Lois declares she is nothing like her sister. Wolfsbane agrees, saying Alison is a good person who would have helped Lois. She then slices Mortis' throat, ending her threat. Blink, injured herself, later flees Necrosha with the wounded Lois.X-Force Vol. 3 #25 =After Necrosha= Lois confronts her sister Alison once more, enlisting the help of Arcade in an attempt to kill her. The battle ends with Lois being defeated.Dazzler One-Shot (2010) Alison brings her to Utopia, causing conflict with Cyclops, as the murder of Diamond Lil is not easily forgotten by him or the other residents of Utopia. Alison defends her decision, pointing out that others living on the island have killed before, and that Cyclops himself also has a murderous sibling.Dazzler One-Shot (2010) She seeks the help of Psylocke, who places Lois in a telepathically-induced coma. She senses that Lois has suffered a great trauma, and that her psyche has shattered.

Bacterial action in the colon produces LCA from chenodeoxycholic acid by reduction of the hydroxyl functional group at carbon-7 in the \\"B\\" ring of the steroid framework. It has been implicated in human and experimental animal carcinogenesis. Preliminary in vitro research suggests that LCA selectively kills neuroblastoma cells, while sparing normal neuronal cells and is cytotoxic to numerous other malignant cell types at physiologically relevant concentrations. Dietary fiber can bind to lithocholic acid and aid in its excretion in stool; as such, fiber can protect against colon cancer. LCA (and LCA acetate and LCA propionate) can activate the vitamin D receptor without raising calcium levels as much as vitamin D itself. LCA was also shown to have anti-aging effects in a yeast study. A later study showed that the bile acid accumulates in the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes, altering the mitochondria's lipid composition by promoting or inhibiting various enzymes.Beach, A.; Richard, V.R.; Leonov, A.; Burstein, M.T.; Bourque, S.D.; Koupaki, O.; Juneau, M.; Feldman, R.; Iouk, T.; Titorenko, V.I.

Life The son of a farmer, he served time as a private in the dragoons then (at the start of the French Revolution) moved to farming and raising his large family. He was elected a d√©put√© for the Pas-de-Calais to the Assembl√©e l√©gislative, then to the National Convention. At the trial of Louis XVI he voted for death without appeal to the people, not for the sentence, and forced his colleague Bollet to vote the same by threats. He took on many missions to the Nord and was absent during the struggle between the Montagnards and Girondists. He was sent to Dunkirk with Lazare Carnot and fought with courage at the Battle of Wattignies, where he charged the enemy at the head of his troops. He was very severe with incompetent generals, notably dismissing Jean Nestor de Chancel and Jean-Baptiste Davaine who were both executed. Denounced by H√©bert for allegedly impeding army operations of Jourdan and taking advantage of his position to put his brother at the head of the army, he was rescued by Maximilien Robespierre and had no difficulty proving his innocence. He warmly defended Jean-Baptiste Jourdan before the Committee of Public Safety and probably saved him from the guillotine. Sent back to the Nord, then to Moselle, according to his colleague Nicolas Hentz, Duquesnoy forgot his dignity as a representative and behaved with an insupportable despotism. Recalled to Paris on 10 August 1794, he succeeded in excluding Jean-Lambert Tallien from the club des Jacobins and having Armand-Joseph Guffroy beaten before Carnot. Guffroy complained to the Committee of General Security and, accused of being one of the leaders of the insurrection of 1 prairial an III (20 May 1795), Duquesnoy was condemned to death despite his friends' depositions. However, he succeeded in committing suicide by pistol in the condemned prisoners' bathroom, writing to his wife after his sentence \\"You know my heart, it was always pure.

His parents had migrated from the south to work in the shipyards, and Oden's father bought him a guitar from a Montgomery Ward catalogue when he was 15 years old. He was taught to play by Robert Kelton, a guitarist for Jimmy McCracklin, and within a year he was sitting in on jam sessions around the local area; he would also play and sing in local churches. In the 1960s he was the bass player with Freddy & The Stone Souls, working with Freddie Stone Stewart, brother of Sly Stone, and backing many local acts such as Rodger Collins and Fillmore Slim. He was also a member of Loading Zone, and recorded behind the group's vocalist Linda Tillery when the group split up. In the 1970s, Oden toured for a short while with Freddie King, and helped to develop the career of Lady Bianca. He returned to music in his own right in the early 1980s, working with Mark Naftalin's Blue Monday band, recording with Clifton Chenier, and touring internationally and recording with the San Francisco Blues Festival package. In the middle of the decade he teamed up with Joe Louis Walker, providing Walker with \\"Shade Tree Mechanic\\" (among other songs throughout the years). This relationship was spasmodic, and for a while Oden based himself in Canada, taking a degree in Humanities. Over the years, Oden appeared with: Jimmy Reed, Pee Wee Crayton, Big Mama Thornton, Mike Bloomfield, Buddy Ace, Curtis Lawson, Bill Withers, Little Joe Blue, Chris Cain, Percy Mayfield, Craig Horton, JJ Malone, Troyce Keys, Cool Papa Sadler, Mississippi Johnny Waters, Big Bones, Sonny Rhodes, Earl King, Johnny Adams, Maria Muldaur and Boz Scaggs.

After fleeing France in 1815, he assumed the name Charles Arnould.  Early life  Coming from a family of nineteen children of a farrier, Nicolas Hentz was born in Metz, France on 5 June 1753. In 1780 he became a lawyer at the Parliament of Metz. He was elected Justice of the Peace of Sierck-les-Bains in December 1790, and embraced the revolutionary ideas. As Justice of the Peace, he made arrests of emigres on the road to Trier. He was a deputy for Moselle to the Revolutionary National Convention 1789 after which he was elected MP for the Moselle in September 1792. Hentz belonged to the party of the Montagne in the National Assembly of France during the French Revolution. He became a member of the Legislation Committee, where he proposed a limitation of inheritances. Regicide and revolution At the trial of King Louis XVI in December 1792, he voted for the guilt of the king, the ratification of the judgment against the people, against the stay and for the death penalty. In the year 1793, he was sent as a representative on mission to ensure the reform of the army and the military's compliance with the revolution. From April to July, he was sent as commissioner to the Army of the Ardennes. He did not participate in elections relating to impeachment of Jean-Paul Marat nor the conviction (and subsequent executions) of Girondins such as Georges Danton. From August to September, he was on a mission to the northern army, where he arrested General Houchard, who he considered to be a \\"creature and successor of Custine's\\" who had recently been accused of treason and executed.Nicholas Hentz, Danton, Robespierre and Marat, up, 1844, p. 252. In October, another mission took him to the Western army; in November, he was back to the Army of the Ardennes and the Moselle and the North. He returned to Paris in late November 1793 and left immediately for the northern army, where he remained until mid-January 1794. =Controversy= The year 1794 marks the downfall of Hentz's career as an influential French politician. Hentz was with the Western army from February to May where the tragic shootings in the Vendee were blamed on his \\"reckless zeal.\\" Hentz left the Army of the Rhine after being accused of overzealous violence and the burning of the town of Kusel on 26 July 1794. He returned to Paris in August. Work under Napoleon Upon the death of Robespierre, he briefly fled to Germany under the assumed name of Charles Arnould but returned under the French Consulate. He became known for his work on the legislative committee specifically in compiling the \\"Code Napoleon\\". Emigration to the United States Upon the Bourbon Restoration in 1815, Hentz was ordered to leave France with his family within thirty days, otherwise he would be imprisoned for life. Nicolas Hentz and his family then sailed for the United States. He settled in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in Pennsylvania, where he appears in the 1830 census with his wife, Theresa, and one of his sons.1830; Census Place: Wilkes Barre, Luzerne, Pennsylvania; Series: M19; Roll: 145; Page: 496; Family History Library Film: 0020619.

Before he died, he wrote a short treatise on \\"Danton, Robespierre and Marat\\" in which he maintained \\"Behold, these three men, who have been erected into a 'detestable triumvirate.' I have believed it my duty... to attempt to recover the fellow-citizens of my adopted country from the abyss of error into which the English ministry has plunged them.\\"Hentz, 248.

It was the last and one of the most remarkable and stubborn popular revolts of the French Revolution. After their defeat in Prairial, the sans-culottes ceased to play any effective part until the next round of revolutions in the early nineteenth century. To a lesser extent, these movements are also important in that they mark the final attempt of the remnants of the Mountain and the Jacobins to recapture their political ascendancy in the Convention and the Paris Sections; this time, though they gave some political direction to the popular movement which arose in the first place in protest against worsening economic conditions, their intervention was timorous and halfhearted and doomed the movement to failure.  Causes  The abandonment of the controlled economy provoked a frightful economic catastrophe. Prices soared and the rate of exchange fell. The Republic was condemned to massive inflation and its currency was ruined. In Thermidor, Year III, assignats were worth less than 3 percent of their face value. Neither peasants nor merchants would accept anything but coin. The debacle was so swift that economic life seemed to come to standstill. The insurmountable obstacles raised by the premature reestablishment of economic freedom reduced the government to a state of extreme weakness. Lacking resources, it became almost incapable of administration, and the crisis generated troubles that nearly brought its collapse. The sans-culottes, who had unprotestingly permitted the Jacobins to be proscribed, began to regret the regime of the Year II, now that they themselves were without work and without bread.  The insurrection  A pamphlet, published in the evening of 30 Floreal (19 May 1795) and entitled Insurrection of the People to obtain bread and reconquer their right, gave the signal for the movement. This pamphlet, which was known as The Plan of Insurrection, provided the popular agitators with definite objectives, the first of which was expressed in a single word: Bread! Its political aims were expounded at greater length: the putting into practice of the Constitution of 1793, the election of a legislative assembly which should take the place of the Convention, the release of the imprisoned patriots. The people were asked to march in a body to the Convention on 1 Prairial. There can be no doubt about the preparation of the insurrection by the sans-culottes leaders. As early as 29 Germinal (18 April), had reported a plot to the Convention. As for the deputies of the Left, their attitude on the first of Prairial showed that they looked favorably on the movement, yet they did nothing to organize or direct it. = First round = Prairial uprising F√©lix Auvray, 1831 Early on 1 Prairial the tocsin was sounded in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine and in the Jardin des Plantes. Once more, as in October 1789, it was the women that took the initiative and brought their menfolk into action after them. In the Faubourg du Nord (Saint-Denis) they called the men out from the workshops at 7 o'clock in the morning. There were food riots and assemblies of women at bakers' shops in Popincourt, Gravilliers, and Droits de l'Homme. As they marched, they compelled women in shops and private houses, and other riding in carriages, to join them. They reached the Place du Carrousel, in front of the Tuileries, at 2 o'clock; pinned to their hats, bonnets, and blouses were the twin slogans of the rebellion, Du Pain et la Constitution de 1793. Thus equipped, they burst into the assembly-hall, but were quickly ejected. They returned with armed groups of the National Guard an hour later. Meanwhile, a general call to arms had been sounded in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine; men quickly armed and prepared to follow the women to the Tuileries. A similar movement began in the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and in the central sections. In some cases, a minority of insurgents forced the doors of the armories, distributed arms to their comrades, and compelled their commanders to lead them to the Convention. The second invasion of the Tuileries quickly followed. A deputy, Jean-Bertrand F√©raud, who opposed their entry, was struck down and his head was severed and paraded on a pike. This time the women were amply supported by armed citizen of the rebellious sections, though few battalions broke into the building in full strength. Yet the demonstrators were in sufficient numbers and their weapons sufficiently imposing to reduce the majority to silence and to encourage the small remnants of deputies of the Mountain, The Crest ( la Cr√™te de la Montagne ), to voice their principal demands ‚Äì the release of the Jacobin prisoners, steps to implement the Constitution of 1793, and new controls to ensure more adequate supplies of food. These were quickly voted and a special committee was set up to give them effect. But the insurgents, like those of Germinal, lacked leadership and any clear program or plan of action. Having achieved their immediate objective, they spent hours in noisy chatter and speech-making. This gave the Themidorian leaders time to call in the support of the loyal sections ‚Äì with Butte des Moulins (Palais-Royal), Museum (Louvre), and Lepeletier at their head ‚Äì and insurgents were driven out the Tuileries. = Second day = The armed rebellion continued the next day. From 2 o'clock in the morning, the call to arms had sounded in the Quinze Vingts. The tocsin tolled before 10 o'clock in Fidelite (Hotel de Ville) and Droits de l'Homme. In these two sections and in Arcis, Gravilliers, and Popincourt illegal assemblies were held. The three sections of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine sprang to arms and marched on the Convention, led by Guillaume Delorme, a wheelwright and captain of the gunners of Popincourt. Supported by some sections of the center, they appeared on the Place du Carrousel at 3:30 in the afternoon, loaded guns and trained them on the Convention. General Dubois, who commanded the Convention forces, had 40,000 men under him; the insurgents may have numbered 20,000. It was the largest display of military force drawn up for battle that had been seen in Paris since the Revolution began. But no shots were fired: when the Convention's gunners and gendarmerie deserted to the opposing side, the insurgents failed to follow up the advantage. Towards evening negotiations began; petitioners were received at the bar of the Assembly, repeated their demands for bread and the Constitution of 1793 and received the presidential embrace. Lulled by vain hopes of promises to be fulfilled, the insurgents thereupon retired to their various sections. = The defeat = But the Convention was determined to make an end of the business. On the morning of 3 Prairial regular army units were mustered, in addition to the jeunesse dor√©e and battalions of the western Sections, and preparations were made to enclose the Faubourg Saint-Antoine within a ring of hostile forces. The jeunesse made a premature sortie into the faubourg and was forced to retreat, and Saint- Antoine workers rescued from the police one of the assassins of F√©raud on his way to execution. But, during the night, the Government overcame the resistance of most of the other insurgent Sections; and, on the 4 Prairial, the faubourg was called upon to hand over F√©raud's murderers and all arms at its disposal: in the event of refusal it would be declared to be in a state of rebellion and all Sections would be called upon to help to reduce it by force of arms or to starve it into surrender. Meanwhile, an army under General Menou prepared to advance against the rebels. Their situation was hopeless; yet some attempt was made in other Sections to bring them relief. In Poissonni√®re √âtienne Chefson, a cobbler and old soldier of the arm√©e r√©volutionnaire, was later arrested for trying to organize building workers of the rues d'Hauteville and de l'√âchiquier to march to the help of the faubourg; in Arcis and in Finist√®re, there were shouts, even after the battle was lost. But no material support was forthcoming; and the faubourg surrendered, a few hours later, without a shot being fired. The movement was totally crushed.  Reaction  The martyrs of Prairial Les derniers Montagnards Charles Ronot, 1882 (Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise) This time, the repression was thorough and ruthless. It struck both at the leaders ‚Äì or presumed leaders ‚Äì of the insurrection itself and at the potential leaders of similar revolts in the future: to behead the sans-culottes once and for all as a political force it was thought necessary to strike at the remnants of Jacobins in the Convention and in the Sectional assemblies and National Guard. Twelve deputies were arrested, including six that had supported the demonstrators' demands on 1 Prairial. On 23 May (4 Prairial), a Military Commission was set up for the summary trial and execution of all persons captured with arms in their possession or wearing the insignia of rebellion. The Commission sat for ten weeks and tried 132 persons; nineteen of these, including six deputies of the Mountain, were condemned to death. The murderers of Feraud, the gendarmes who had gone to over to rioters, and the deputies Romme, Duquesnoy, Goujon, Duroy, :fr:Pierre-Amable de Soubrany and Bourbotte were all lumped together in the same category. The condemned deputies, wishing both to demonstrate their inviolable liberty and to challenge their accusers, attempted to kill themselves before being conducted to the scaffold. The first three were successful. Soubrany died as he reached the guillotine; the others were executed alive. This 'heroic sacrifice' put the 'martyrs of Prairial' in the pantheon of the popular movement. But it highlighted the insoluble contradiction of their position. On 1 Prairial the most lucid of them understood the trap which was set up for them and consciously walked into it. The Sections were invited to hold special meetings on 24 May to denounce and disarm all suspected 'terrorists' and Jacobin sympathizers. The result was a massive toll of proscriptions, in which the settling of old scores played as large a part as the testing of political orthodoxy. By the 28 May the Gazette fran√ßaise already put their number at 10,000; and the eventual total of arrested and disarmed must have been considerably larger, as, in several Sections, all former members of Revolutionary Committees, all soldiers of the arm√©e r√©volutionnaire were arrested or disarmed irrespective of any part they may have played in the events of Germinal or Prairial. The precedent thus established was to be followed on more than one occasion during the Directory and Consulate. Why were the Parisian sans-culottes defeated in May 1795? Partly it was for lack of a clear political program and plan of action; partly through the weakness of the deputies of the Mountain; partly through political inexperience and the failure to follow up an advantage once gained; partly, too, through the correspondingly greater skill and experience of the Convention and its Committees and the support that these were able to muster ‚Äì even without the active intervention of the regular army ‚Äì from the jeunesse dor√©e and the merchants, civil servants, and monied classes of the western Sections. But, above all, the sans-culottes failed to secure and maintain in Prairial, as they had in the great journ√©es of 1789‚Äì1793, the solid alliance of at least the radical wing of the bourgeoisie. When this faltered and failed, their movement for all its breadth and militancy, was reduced to a futile explosion without hope of political gains.

Prior to that he was involved in BarackObama.com and directed the technological initiative to announce the selection of Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee to be Vice President of the United States. Philips' new media efforts during the 2008 United States presidential election helped raise vast sums of money for the Obama presidential campaign, while his text messaging, online videos and social networking skills led the campaign in many organizational and informational ways. Blue State Digital created and managed Obama's campaign site, which brought in a million Facebook friends and about $500 million. In early August 2009, Phillips was publicly criticized for asking members of the public‚Äîvia a blogpost at whitehouse.gov‚Äîto forward \\"fishy\\" emails regarding healthcare reform, raising privacy concerns in the process. On August 17, 2009, the White House closed down flag@whitehouse.gov, the e-mail address created to receive those reports. In September 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry hired Philips as the head of the Bureau of International Information Programs in order to spearhead the overhaul of America's \\"digital diplomacy\\" efforts. On November 20, 2013, he met with the Russian participants of the U.S.-Russia Young Journalist Exchange. Personal Phillips is the brother of Metropolitan Opera lyric soprano Susanna Phillips. He is married to Emily Price Phillips. They had a son, Max, in November 2012. His parents are Dr. Macon and Barbara Phillips.

The park occupies along the Bow River to the east of downtown Calgary. It is described as \\"constructed wetlands filled with native plants and animals\\". The land was donated to the city around 1929 by then prominent Calgarian William Pearce. The park is located east of the Calgary Zoo and the neighborhood of Inglewood, at the eastern end of International Avenue, inside a bend of the Bow River. An interpretative trail was opened to the public in 2004. Location The main parking lot for the park is located at 1440 17A St. S.E. Calgary, to the west of the neighborhood of Inglewood. It is west of the Calgary Zoo, at the eastern end of International Avenue, inside a bend of the Bow River. Background William Pearce (1848‚Äì1930), who served as the Inspector of Dominion Lands Agencies, where he oversaw the \\"development and allocation of all land, forests, mineral and water resources\\" from \\"Winnipeg to the eastern foothills of the Rockies\\"‚Äîrepresenting 400,000 square miles of land. With such influence, he earned the nickname the \\"Czar of the West\\". On October 21, 1880, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) signed an agreement with the federal government to build a 1,900 mile-railway from Kamloops, British Columbia to Callander, Ontario. The railway was to receive \\"$25 million and 25 million acres of land 'fairly fit for settlement.'\\" Pearce convinced the CPR to build the line through Calgary, with the Bow River watershed used to irrigate lands in southern Alberta. John Palliser who led the 1857-1859 British Palliser expedition to Western Canada, and for whom the Palliser's Triangle was named, had said the land was \\"unfit for settlement.\\" By 1915, Pearce's vision of a vast irrigation system had been realized; land that Palliser thought would never support settlement, was \\"fertile and valuable\\". A 1915 article in Scientific American described it as \\"America‚Äôs Greatest Irrigation Project.\\" According to E.J. (Ted) Hart, director of the Whyte Museum in Banff, who is the author of \\"several histories\\" of the Bow River watershed region, the \\"irrigation history of the Bow is one of the great industrial projects of Canada‚Äôs history. It created an economy out of an area that was considered useless.\\" Pearce moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1884 and worked for twenty years for the CPR. A year before he died he donated his estate in the southeast of Calgary, which occupied about in a curve along the Bow River as it flows through the city. Pearce's land, on which the Pearce Estate Park is situated, was \\"devoted to experimental methods.\\" Before Pearce owned the wetlands, they were once part of a \\"riverine forest complex\\". Pearce used some of the land for agriculture. Pearce \\"believed in urban parks\\" and he \\"is the reason so much of the Bow remains accessible\\" to the public as it runs through the city core. In 2004, the city opened the newly developed wetland area and interpretive trail to the public. Features Pearce Estate Park includes naturalized, reconstructed wetlands with ponds and streams along its pathways. It has a playground, picnic sites, seasonal washrooms, cross-country skiing, walking and biking trails, and access to the kayak rapids. Trails include the \\"Walking on Water Trail,\\" the British Petroleum (BP) \\"Discovery Trail,\\" and the Ducks Unlimited \\"Webbed Foot Lane\\". The Sam Livingston Fish Hatchery, which is operated by the province, and provincially operated Bow Habitat Station are on the site. The nature interpretation facility is \\"jointly developed and operated\\" by the province of Alberta, the City of Calgary, along with private and non-profit sectors. The park occupies hectare which includes of wetland area and the adjacent Bow Habitat Station. Flora The Estate ecosystem is a Balsam Poplar riverine forest, where willows, including the silver willow, Water Birch and Red-osier Dogwood thrive. Balsam Poplar Populus balsamifera, which are also known as call Black Cottonwoods, prefer a very moist soil and can tolerate flooding. The bark of the balsam poplar is thick and gnarly and their leaves are large and pointed leaves. These trees provide habitat for a diversity of native fauna. In the small streams and ponds, submergent vegetation, like Sago Pondweed can be found. Common Duckweed floats on surface waters. Wildlife The White-breasted Nuthatch and Gray Catbird are very common. Birds that nest in cavities, such as Common Goldeneye, Tree Swallows, and Northern Flickers, are attracted to the older Balsam poplar trees. Some of these trees can live up to 200 years. Pond birds include American Coots. Invertebrates include the Water Boatman, Midges, and Diving Beetles that the ducks feed on. Bend in the Bow Pearce Estate Wetland is part of a larger city project which is a project that connects Pearce Estate Park and the adjoining green spaces on the banks of the Bow River to the Inglewood Wildlands and Inglewood Bird Sanctuary (IBS). The Inglewood Bird Sanctuary is the \\"only urban-centred, federally-recognized bird sanctuary in Canada.\\" The Calgary Weir, is part of a network of canals and ponds originally created by the CPR in the early 20th century to divert water from the Bow River. where water was diverted from the Bow River as part of the Western Irrigation District (WID), first opened in 1914. This was one of three irrigation districts in southern Alberta that supplied water from the Bow River‚Äîthe two others are the Eastern Irrigation District (EID),The Canadian Railroad Company (CPR) developed the original irrigation system on the land allocated to them by Pearce as part of the Dominion of Canada's final payment for building the railroad from Ontario to the Pacific coast of British Columbia. CPR irrigated land in southern Alberta to attract settlers that would increase the use of the railway lines. In 1910, construction began and by 1914 the first irrigation water began flowing. The current Eastern Irrigation District was established in 1935, when a group of farmers \\"negotiated a deal with the CPR to take over control of the project\\".The Bow River has been an \\"engineered and managed river\\" since the early 20th century.The Calgary-based Alberta WaterPortal released a series entitled The Story of Water Management on the Bow River consisting of ten videos about the past, present and future of water management on the Bow. The CPR construction of the diversion weir at the bend in the Bow River in Calgary, was the first stage in what would become the network of irrigation canals and reservoirs. By 1905, Reservoir #1 (Chestermere Lake) was filled for the first time as water flowed from the Bow at the weir through the Main Canal. According to a 2011 series by the Alberta Water Portal, WID receives much of Calgary's storm water and has more rainfall than the EID and BRID, so the Calgary Weir diversion, is supports the needs of the City and those of the southern Alberta agriculture sector. Harvie Passage The Pearce Estate provides access to the Harvie Passage, which was officially reopened for recreational use in 2018, a high water channel, for skilled kayakers and a \\"low water channel for novice paddlers.\\" It had been closed to recreational use since the 2013 flood.

Louis Jean Joseph L√©onard Bourdon de la Croni√®re (6 November 1754, Alen√ßon - 29 May 1807, Breslau) was a French politician of the French Revolution. He was president of the National Constituent Assembly and substitute for the procureur of the Commune de Paris. Despite his depiction in the traditional historiography, where he is presented as \\"a fanatical Montagnard, a fierce terrorist, a violent man, thirsty for blood, corrupt and decadent\\", he is depicted more sympathetically by modern historians.  Biography  He was born in 1754 in Alen√ßon, Normandy, in the large family of a wealthy administrative officer who was among the king's advisers. He studied law in Orleans and in 1779 achieved the position of avocat aux conseils, a lawyer with the right of representing litigants before the Council of State and Court of Cassation. In 1785, he settled in the Faubourg Saint-Marcel quarter of Paris, ceasing any activity as a lawyer. In 1788 he publishes a pamphlet called Plan d‚Äôun √©tablissement d‚Äô√©ducation nationale, which lays out his plans for various educational reforms. This made him the recipient of the royal letters patent placing him in charge of a new learning institution, the Soci√©t√© Royale d'√âmulation, which closed down after only two years. He was elected to the Estates General of 1789, where he continued his educational proselytism, proposing a national education plan, both in the Paris department and in the new legislative assembly. A member of the Jacobin club, he became more involved in politics after the attempted flight attempt of Louis XVI, in June 1791. His activist fervor gained him a gruesome reputation for the coldness with which he would oversee massacres and executions during the Terror. At the same time, he also opened up a new school, named \\"Soci√©t√© des Jeunes Fran√ßais\\". In the committee of public education he supported a new plan of national public instruction. He also submitted an economic project of \\"granaries of plenty\\", to fight against food scarcity and speculation on the grain and flour trade. As the tension within the Jacobins mounted towards height of the Reign of Terror, he fell out of grace with Robespierre, who denounced him as an \\"intriguer despised by all\\". During the Thermidor Reaction, he joined in the actions that lead to the arrest and execution of Robespierre, but this crisis was also the beginning of his political career. In April 1795 he was arrested as a conspirator and imprisoned in the fortress of Ham. He was released in October 1795, as part of an amnesty. For the next few years, he would be entrusted several small administrative or diplomatic jobs, while he was still trying to propose a reform of education. Finally, in 1800 he abandoned these plans and managed to join the board of directors of the Toulon military hospital. This position led him in the wake of the Grand Arm√©e, as director of military hospitals, to Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), where he died on May 29, 1807.  Further reading  * Michael J.

From observation, words tend to exhibit only one sense in most given discourse and in a given collocation.  Application  The algorithm starts with a large, untagged corpus, in which it identifies examples of the given polysemous word, and stores all the relevant sentences as lines. For instance, Yarowsky uses the word \\"plant\\" in his 1995 paper to demonstrate the algorithm. If it is assumed that there are two possible senses of the word, the next step is to identify a small number of seed collocations representative of each sense, give each sense a label (i.e. sense A and B), then assign the appropriate label to all training examples containing the seed collocations. In this case, the words \\"life\\" and \\"manufacturing\\" are chosen as initial seed collocations for senses A and B respectively. The residual examples (85%-98% according to Yarowsky) remain untagged. The algorithm should initially choose seed collocations representative that will distinguish sense A and B accurately and productively. This can be done by selecting seed words from a dictionary‚Äôs entry for that sense. The collocations tend to have stronger effect if they are adjacent to the target word, the effect weakens with distance. According to the criteria given in Yarowsky (1993), seed words that appear in the most reliable collocational relationships with the target word will be selected. The effect is much stronger for words in a predicate- argument relationship than for arbitrary associations at the same distance to the target word, and is much stronger for collocations with content words than with function words. Having said this, a collocation word can have several collocational relationships with the target word throughout the corpus. This could give the word different rankings or even different classifications. Alternatively, it can be done by identifying a single defining collocate for each class, and using for seeds only those contexts containing one of these defining words. A publicly available database WordNet can be used as an automatic source for such defining terms. In addition, words that occur near the target word in great frequency can be selected as seed collocations representative. This approach is not fully automatic, a human judge must decide which word will be selected for each target word‚Äôs sense, the outputs will be reliable indicators of the senses. A decision list algorithm is then used to identify other reliable collocations. This training algorithm calculates the probability Pr(Sense  Collocation), and the decision list is ranked by the log-likelihood ratio: : log left( frac{Pr(text{Sense}_A  text{Collocation}_i)}{ Pr( text{Sense}_B  text{Collocation}_i)} right) A smoothing algorithm will then be used to avoid 0 values. The decision-list algorithm resolves many problems in a large set of non-independent evidence source by using only the most reliable piece of evidence rather than the whole matching collocation set. The new resulting classifier will then be applied to the whole sample set. Add those examples in the residual that are tagged as A or B with probability above a reasonable threshold to the seed sets. The decision-list algorithm and the above adding step are applied iteratively. As more newly-learned collocations are added to the seed sets, the sense A or sense B set will grow, and the original residual will shrink. However, these collocations stay in the seed sets only if their probability of classification remains above the threshold, otherwise they are returned to the residual for later classification. At the end of each iteration, the \\"one sense per discourse\\" property can be used to help preventing initially mistagged collocates and hence improving the purity of the seed sets. In order to avoid strong collocates becoming indicators for the wrong class, the class-inclusion threshold needs to be randomly altered. For the same purpose, after intermediate convergence the algorithm will also need to increase the width of the context window. The algorithm will continue to iterate until no more reliable collocations are found. The ‚ÄòOne sense per discourse‚Äô property can be used here for error correction. For a target word that has a binary sense partition, if the occurrences of the majority sense A exceed that of the minor sense B by a certain threshold, the minority ones will be relabeled as A. According to Yarowsky, for any sense to be clearly dominant, the occurrences of the target word should not be less than 4. When the algorithm converges on a stable residual set, a final decision list of the target word is obtained. The most reliable collocations are at the top of the new list instead of the original seed words. The original untagged corpus is then tagged with sense labels and probabilities. The final decision list may now be applied to new data, the collocation with the highest rank in the list is used to classify the new data. For example, if the highest ranking collocation of the target word in the new data set is of sense A, then the target word is classified as sense A.

He was landlord to Robespierre. On the evening of 17 July, after the Champ de Mars massacre, the authorities ordered numerous arrests. Robespierre, who attended the Jacobin club, did not dare to go back to the rue Saintonge where he lodged, and so asked Laurent Lecointre if he knew a patriot near the Tuileries who could put him up for the night. Lecointre suggested Duplay's house and took him there. Maurice Duplay, a cabinetmaker and ardent admirer lived at 398 Rue Saint-Honor√© near the Tuileries. After a few days Robespierre decided to move in, although he lived there in the backyard so that he was constantly exposed to the sound of working. He was motivated by a desire to live closer to the Assembly and the meeting place of the Jacobins in the Rue Saint-Jacques.

It has 460 beds and over 700 physicians. The hospital is a Level I Trauma Center, and an Advanced Primary Stroke Center. It houses a Neurointensive Care Unit and a Level III Neonatal ICU. It was formerly known as Georgia Baptist Hospital. History On Thanksgiving Day 1901, the pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church, Len G. Broughton M.D., created a small infirmary as a new program for his church, operating it out of a rented house. The Tabernacle Infirmary started with only five beds and Broughton as the only doctor, but quickly grew. By 1910 it had 75 beds and a staff of physicians and surgeons, and its own building on Luckie Street (adjacent to The Tabernacle). Broughton also founded a Nurse Training School associated with the Infirmary. After Broughton left Atlanta for London in 1912, the hospital suffered somewhat. It was sold to the Georgia Baptist Convention for $85,000 in 1913 and was managed by Rev. James Long as Georgia Baptist Hospital. The Baptist organization was not enthusiastic at first about running a hospital but Long overcame that and the business was self-sufficient by 1916. In 1921 the hospital purchased the former Levi B. Nelson home site at Boulevard and East Avenue (which was destroyed in the Great Atlanta fire of 1917), which is the present location east of downtown Atlanta. The hospital moved from its former Luckie Street location to here late in 1921. A building program was undertaken starting in 1948 to expand the hospital. In 1956, office space for medical professionals was added. In 1981, air ambulance service was initiated via heliport. On September 5, 1997 the hospital was sold to Tenet Healthcare and was subsequently renamed Atlanta Medical Center. Effective March 31, 2016 the hospital was sold to Wellstar Health System along with four other Atlanta-area hospitals.

A pure gravity assist uses only the gravity of a body to change the direction of the spacecraft trajectory. The change in direction is limited by the mass of the body, and how closely it can be approached. An aerogravity assist uses a closer approach to the planet, dipping into the atmosphere, so the spacecraft can also use aerodynamic lift with upside-down wings to augment gravity and further curve the trajectory. This enables the spacecraft to deflect through a larger angle, resulting in a higher delta-v (change in velocity). This in turn allows a shorter travel time, a larger payload fraction of the spacecraft, or a smaller spacecraft for a given payload. The related techniques of aerocapture, aerobraking, and atmospheric entry also attempt to use the body's atmosphere to help reduce propulsion requirements. In an aerogravity assist, however, the goal is not to use the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down, but instead use it to achieve a larger change in direction. Aerogravity assists, though proposed in theory, have not yet been used in practice.

Predecessors = TVE (2002‚Äì2004) = The idea of the show actually began in 2002 as a number of separate sketches on La 1's Noche de Fiesta, led by Jos√© Luis Moreno.

In this first incarnation, the actors who gave life to the characters were Marisa Porcel (Pepa), Pepe Ruiz (Avelino) Silvia Gambino (Marina) and Alfredo Cernuda (Roberto).

A bank may accumulate a large portfolio of debts or other financial instruments which unexpectedly increase in risk, making it difficult for the bank to raise capital, for example through sales of bonds. In these circumstances, the bank may wish to segregate its \\"good\\" assets from its \\"bad\\" assets through the creation of a bad bank. The goal of the segregation is to allow investors to assess the bank's financial health with greater certainty. A bad bank might be established by one bank or financial institution as part of a strategy to deal with a difficult financial situation, or by a government or some other official institution as part of an official response to financial problems across a number of institutions in the financial sector. In addition to segregating or removing the bad assets from parent banks' balance sheets, a bad bank structure permits specialized management to deal with the problem of bad debts. The approach allows good banks to focus on their core business of lending while the bad bank can specialize in maximizing value from the high risk assets. Such bad bank institutions have been created to address challenges arising during an economic credit crunch to allow private banks to take problem assets off their books. The financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 resulted in bad banks being set up in several countries. For example, a bad bank was suggested as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to help address the subprime mortgage crisis in the US. In the Republic of Ireland, a bad bank, the National Asset Management Agency was established in 2009, in response to the financial crisis in that country. Models In a 2009 report, McKinsey & Company identified four basic models for bad banks. * In an on-balance-sheet guarantee, the bank uses some mechanism (typically a government guarantee) to protect part of its portfolio against losses. While simple to implement, this situation is difficult for investors to assess. * In an internal restructuring, the bank creates a separate unit to hold the bad assets. This solution is more transparent, but does not isolate the bank from risk. * In a Special purpose entity (SPE), the bank transfers its bad assets to another organization, typically government backed. This solution requires significant government participation. * Finally, in a bad bank spinoff, the bank creates a new, independent bank to hold the bad assets. This completely isolates the original bank from the risky assets. Examples= Mellon Bank (1988) = The first bank to use the bad bank strategy was Mellon Bank, which created a bad bank entity in 1988 to hold $1.4 billion of bad loans. Initially, the Federal Reserve was reluctant to issue a charter to the new bank, Grant Street National Bank (in liquidation), but Mellon's CEO, Frank Cahouet, persisted and the regulators eventually agreed. A dumping ground for non-performing energy and real estate loans, Grant Street was spun off with its own five-member board of directors and about $130 million in Mellon capital; it was named for a main street in Pittsburgh which was home to Mellon Financial headquarters. It took no public deposits. Mellon shareholders were issued shares in both the good and bad banks on a one-for-one basis, as a dividend. After the Grant Street National Bank had fulfilled its purpose, issuing preferred shares and equity purchase contracts to finance the purchase of $1 billion in Mellon's bad loans at 57% of face value, then collecting what it could on the individual loans, it was liquidated and its employees quietly returned to Mellon Bank. Securities collateralized by the bank's assets were structured and sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The securities were divided into two tranches: Senior, which received investment grade rating, and Junior which were high yield securities. Internally at Drexel they were nicknamed CLOWNS which stood for \\"Collateralized Loan Obligations Worth Nothing Securities\\". All bonds were paid off at full. Grant Street's early investors made handsome profits; the bank was dissolved in 1995 after repaying all bondholders and meeting its objectives. = Swedish banking crisis of 1992 = The Swedish banking crisis of 1992 was the direct result of a combination of over- speculation in property assets and the exchange rate of the Swedish krona. By 1992 three of the four major banks were insolvent. The Swedish authorities engaged McKinsey & Company to help design a solution, and chose to establish two bad banks, Retriva and Securum. Retriva took over all the nonperforming loans from and Securum took over the non-performing loans from Nordbanken, with the good bank operations continuing as Nordea. The government retained a significant equity stake in Nordea. Lars Thunell was appointed to lead Securum, supported by Anders Nyr√©n and Jan Kvarnstr√∂m to manage its toxic book, at the time valued at sek 51 billion. The performance of Securum has been analysed by many, such as Claes Bergstr√∂m. While the figures are debated, depending on initial costs and the time frame the cost was no more than 2% of GDP (an extremely good result) and eventually both bad banks made a positive return. Nordea has been considered one of the strongest and best performing banks in Europe. International commentators such as Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman have suggested the Swedish bad banking model be adopted internationally. = France = *Cr√©dit Lyonnais (1994) *Dexia = Finland = The Finnish banking crisis of the 1990s caused the collapse of two major banks, the S√§√§st√∂pankki group/SKOP and STS Bank. The government founded the bad banks (\\"property management companies\\") OHY Arsenal and Sponda, which took over the bad debt. In 2015 Arsenal started the process of winding down by deliberately filing for bankruptcy. 200 million of remaining capital has been collected during the bankruptcy. However, Arsenal is still involved in court cases and may not be disestablished until they are complete. Sponda was privatized and listed in Helsinki Stock Exchange in 1998, and in 2012, all government-held shares were sold by their holder, the government's asset management company Solidium. As of 2016, Sponda operates and remains on the stock market. =Indonesia (1998)= During the Asian Financial Crisis which emerged in Indonesia and several other countries in Asia in 1997 and 1998, the Indonesian government established the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA) as an official body to oversee the asset disposals of an extensive number of distressed banks. = Belgium = The 2008‚Äì09 Belgian financial crisis is a major financial crisis that hit Belgium from mid-2008 onwards. Two of the country's largest banks ‚Äì Fortis and Dexia ‚Äì started to face severe problems, exacerbated by the financial problems hitting other banks around the world. The value of their stocks plunged. The government managed the situation by bailouts, selling off or nationalizing banks, providing bank guarantees and extending the deposit insurance. Eventually, Fortis was split into two parts. The Dutch part was nationalized, while the Belgian part was sold to the French bank BNP Paribas. Dexia group was dismantled, Dexia Bank Belgium was nationalized. = US sub-prime mortgage collapse of 2008 = In early 2009, Citigroup dumped more than $700 billion worth of impaired assets into bad bank Citi Holdings. By 2012, the Citi Holdings bad bank represented 9% of the total Citigroup balance sheet. In March 2011, Bank of America segregated almost half its 13.9 million mortgages into a bad bank composed of risky and worst- performing \\"legacy\\" loans. =India's Position= Parliament has to enact a legislation establishing the Bad Bank ‚Äì by whatever name called ‚Äì NAMA, PARA, or NAMC. The Government shall retain minority stake in the Bad Bank and invite the private investors to hold the majority. However, the Government should have a right to veto any decision of the Bad Bank. Professionals from various fields should be made part of the management and political interference should be kept to a minimum. The provisions of the Act with respect to acquisition/disposal of bank assets should override any other legal /contractual restrictions including any consent requirements. Valuation of the NPAs should be done by professional agencies and transfer price should not be more than long term economic value of the bad asset. Moreover, the Bad Bank shall not acquire the NPA, if its long term economic value is less than its market value. Safety net provision such as (i) lack of Government guarantees on its subordinated debt, (ii) ‚ÄòClaw back provision‚Äô in form of a surcharge on banks, and (iii) purchase price involving an average haircut of 30% on large accounts. = Baltic crisis of 2008-2011 = Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined the European Union in 2004, attracting an influx of foreign investment and launching a real estate bubble which burst during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08, leaving the countries saddled with foreign debt. Riga-based Parex Bank, the largest Latvian-owned bank, was vulnerable as it held large sums from foreign depositors (which began withdrawing assets around the time of Lehman Brothers September 2008 collapse) and was heavily exposed to real estate loans. Latvia's government took a controlling interest in Parex in November 2008, spinning off Citadele banka as a good bank in August 2010. The bad assets were left behind, effectively creating a bad bank with the original Parex Banka name and no retail depositors. The Parex \\"bad bank,\\" its core retail functions stripped out by the 2010 split, gave up its banking licence in 2012 to become professional distressed asset management company Reverta. While the crisis was focused in the markets of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, it involved Swedish banks, so Sweden was also exposed. The Baltic Crisis was partly initiated by the global credit crunch, but it revealed questionable lending practices of all major Swedish banks. Swedbank was particularly exposed, given its 50% share of market and well over sek150 million of impaired loans. With the support of the Swedish authorities the new CEO of Swedbank, Michael Wolf, engaged bad bank specialist Kvanrnstrom, European Resolution Capital and Justin Jenk who lead the formation and management of Swedbank‚Äôs bad banking operations (Financial Resolution & Recovery and Ektornet). This work was part of wider revolutionary change at Swedbank. This bad bank‚Äôs creation was covered in depth and published in a book by Birgitta Forsberg. The steps by management and this team were instrumental in rescuing Swedbank and stabilizing the region‚Äôs economy. Today, Swedbank is considered one of Europe‚Äôs stronger and better performing banks. = United Kingdom = In 2010 the UK government established UK Asset Resolution, a state owned limited company to manage the assets of the two nationalised mortgage lenders Bradford & Bingley and Northern Rock (Asset Management). This bad bank manages a total mortgage book of ¬£62.3bn (as at 30 September 2013)http://www.ukar.co.uk/~/media/Files/U/Ukar-V2/Attachments/fact- sheet/factsheet-16052014.pdf In 2013, the Royal Bank of Scotland transferred ¬£38.3bn of its worst loans to an internal bad bank. In 2014, Barclays Bank dumped the bulk of its commodities operation and fixed income business into an internal \\"bad bank\\" as part of a restructuring in which it greatly curtailed its investment banking activities. = Germany = Germany has several bad banks dating as far back as the 1980s, Bankaktiengesellschaft (BAG), owned by the Federal Association of German 'Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken' Co- operative Banks, Bankgesellschaft Berlin, Erste Abwickelungsanstalt and FMS Wertemanagement. The Erste Abwickelungsanstalt and the FMS Wertmanagement together hold 190 Bn ‚Ç¨ and 170 Bn ‚Ç¨ respectively from the failed WestLB and Hypo Real Estate. = Austria (2009) = Hypo Alpe Adria: Nationalised in 2009 by the Austrian government to avert a bank collapse, dismantled in 2014. = Spain (2012) = In 2012 the Spanish government granted powers to the Fund for orderly restructuring of the bank sector (FROB) to force banks to pass toxic assets to a financial institution whose role is to remove risky assets from banks balance sheets and to sell off the assets at a profit over a 15-year period. The SAREB (Restructured Banks Asset Management Company) has assets of close to ‚Ç¨62Bn on its balance sheet. = Portugal (2014) = On 3 August 2014, Banco de Portugal, Portugal's central bank, announced a ‚Ç¨4.4 billion bailout of Banco Esp√≠rito Santo (BES) that heralded the end of BES as a private bank. It will be funded by the European Stability Mechanism. The bank will be split into a healthy bank, Novo Banco, while the toxic assets remain in the existing bank.  Some major conclusions from the experiences in Sweden  *By separating the non-performing loans from the banks, it was possible to start the process of focusing the banks back to lending. Trying to work out all the non-performing loans inside the bank only prolonged the healing process in the organisation and reduced the ability of the bank to lend more to the public and businesses. *Repairing the balance sheet of the banks is only one important element to get the banks back to normal lending activities. The other major element is organisational processes. *The organisational requirements are very different in a bad bank than in a normal bank. A good bank is a 'process' organisation while a bad bank is a 'project' organisation. The skill set and the emphasis on type of skills are different in a restructuring and winding up situation than in a lending situation. *The first year of the bad bank determines its success. The challenge is the large number of non-performing loans in a wide variety of situations with regards to geographical location, type of industry, size and type of problem. If the bad bank does not quickly get control of the loans, a lot of value is lost and the capital requirements of the bad bank can change dramatically. To be successful, a well-defined process on how to handle the different loans has to be established. This process has to be followed and managed with force and speed in the organisation. If not, the bad bank will easily end up in chaos. *When a bad bank has gone through its credit work-out process, the remains of the bad bank is often asset ownership. Therefore, the bad bank in its life span changes dramatically from being at the outset basically a bank with a large number of loans to later in life a large asset-owning company. A common mistake is to think of this last phase of the bad bank as a kind of investment company. An investment company has very well defined objectives regarding what type of assets they want to acquire. They choose the assets they want to acquire. A bad bank gets all the assets that are left after the credit work- out process. *A lifetime of 10‚Äì15 years is too long for planning purposes. The world changes substantially in such a long lifespan. Most banking crises are over in a 5‚Äì6 year period. A 5‚Äì6 year time span is the logical time to use for planning purposes and the timeline to use for winding down a bad bank. All three bad bank structures have been deemed text book examples of success. They resolved the toxic loans and made positive returns to the relevant stakeholders. This body of work has been referenced by governments and authorities around the world as best practice and some of its lessons applied (most recently in Ireland, Spain, Cyprus and Slovenia).  Criticism  Critics of bad banks argue that the prospect that the state will take over non-performing loans encourages banks to take undue risks, which they otherwise would not, i.e. a moral hazard in risk-taking. Another criticism is that the option of handing the loan over to the bad bank becomes essentially a subsidy on corporate bankruptcy. Instead of developing a company that is temporarily unable to pay, the bondholder is given an incentive to sue for bankruptcy immediately, which makes it eligible for sale to a bad bank. Thus, it can become a subsidy for banks at the expense of small businesses.

He was a close associate of Emperor Shunzong (Li Song) while Li Song was crown prince under his father Emperor Dezong, and was powerful during Emperor Shunzong's brief reign in 805, when Emperor Shunzong was severely ill. However, he offended the powerful eunuchs and further lost power when he was forced to leave governmental service due to his mother's death, and after Emperor Shunzong yielded the throne to his son Emperor Xianzong, Emperor Xianzong ordered Wang to commit suicide.  Background and service under Li Song as Crown Prince  Wang Shuwen was born in 753. His family was from Yue Prefecture (Ë∂äÂ∑û, in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang). It was said that during the reign of Emperor Dezong, he became a reserve consultant in the imperial administration on the basis of his abilities in Go, rough knowledge in the books, and speaking ability. Emperor Dezong had him become a member of the staff of Emperor Dezong's son and crown prince Li Song.Old Book of Tang, vol. 135. It was said that Wang was, when he was having chances, bringing to Li Song's attention of the suffering of the people. At one point, Li Song was studying with several scholars who were teaching him in various matters, and they began to discuss one of the institutions of Emperor Dezong's court that was much criticized ‚Äî \\"the Emperor's purchasing\\" (ÂÆÆÂ∏Ç), where palace eunuchs \\"bought\\" items for palace supplies, but effectively were forcibly taking things from merchants and paying either nothing or very little. Li Song indicated that when he had a chance, he would try to talk to Emperor Dezong to suggest ending the process. The scholars all praised Li Song, but Wang, who was also present did not say anything. After the scholar had left, Wang told Li Song that if he actually made such suggestions to Emperor Dezong, Emperor Dezong would suspect him of attempting to please the people. Li Song saw Wang's point and wept, and thereafter became more trusting of Wang. Meanwhile, Wang and another staff member of Li Song's, Wang Pi, who was known for his calligraphy, became close associates.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. As time went by, Wang Shuwen gradually recommended to Li Song a group of junior officials with reputations for abilities whom he believed could eventually be high level officials or generals, and whom he had befriended. Such junior officials included Wei Zhiyi, Lu Chun (Èô∏Ê∑≥), L√º Wen (ÂëÇÊ∫´), Li Jingjian (ÊùéÊôØÂÑâ), Han Ye (ÈüìÊõÑ), Han Tai (ÈüìÊ≥∞), Chen Jian (Èô≥Ë´´), Liu Zongyuan, Liu Yuxi, Ling Zhun (ÂáåÊ∫ñ), and Cheng Yi. It was said that they would spend their days together in secret and that the contents of their deliberations were not openly known. Some regional governors, believing that this would be the next group of officials to take power, sent them gifts. By 803, this group was said to be powerful enough that, when they suspected another junior official, Zhang Zhengyi (ÂºµÊ≠£‰∏Ä) of making negative reports about Wang Shuwen to Emperor Dezong, they had Wei accuse Zhang of being wasteful and engaging in partisanship. As a result, Zhang and his associates Wang Zhongshu (Áéã‰ª≤Ëàí) and Liu Bochu (Âäâ‰ºØËäª) were exiled without any publicly announced faults.  During Emperor Shunzong's reign  In late 804, Li Song suffered a debilitating stroke that left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak. When Emperor Dezong died on February 25, 805,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%ADs%A4%B8&yy;=21&ycanzi;=&mm;=1‚ÖÜ=&dcanzi;=%AC%D1%A4x there were initially some eunuchs who suggested that someone else should succeed Emperor Dezong, but at the strong advocacy of the imperial scholar Wei Cigong (Ë°õÊ¨°ÂÖ¨), Li Song's succession was not further questioned despite his illness. To show that he was still not completely incapacitated, Li Song was forced to personally show himself to the imperial guards, and he took the throne (as Emperor Shunzong). However, Emperor Shunzong remained seriously ill, and he was often attended to only by the eunuch Li Zhongyan (ÊùéÂø†Ë®Ä) and his concubine Consort Niu. Much of the decisions on important matters of state were entrusted to Wang Pi and Wang Shuwen, both of whom were named imperial scholar and was largely making decisions at the Hanlin Institute (Áø∞ÊûóÈô¢). Under Wang Shuwen's recommendation, Wei Zhiyi was made a chancellor, and it was said that Wei, Wang Shuwen, Wang Pi, Li Zhongyan, and Consort Niu formed a group of decision makers. It was said that much authority were also delegated to Han Tai, Liu Zongyuan, and Liu Yuxi, and that Wang Shuwen was effectively the leader. His associates were also said to be praising each other and comparing each other to such great historical figures as Yi Yin, the Duke of Zhou, Guan Zhong, and Zhuge Liang. Many officials were being promoted and demoted based on their recommendations. Meanwhile, Wang Shuwen, believing that the key to getting the support from the soldiers and the people to affirm their power was control over the imperial treasury, had himself made the deputy director of finances, serving under the senior chancellor Du You. Wang Shuwen was said to be so insolent in his exercise of power that, at one point, breaching the protocol that chancellors were to have lunch together, he demanded that Wei meet him during lunch time ‚Äî angering Wei's senior colleague Zheng Xunyu so much that Zheng went home and refused to exercise chancellor responsibilities from that point on. With Emperor Shunzong's severe illness, there was a popular sentiment among officials that Emperor Shunzong's oldest son Li Chun should be made crown prince as soon as possible. It was said, though, that Wang Shuwen and his associates ‚Äî especially Consort Niu, who was not Li Chun's mother ‚Äî were apprehensive about Li Chun, who was known for his being intelligent and decisive. One of the imperial scholars, Zheng Yin, however, directly proposed to Emperor Shunzong that LI Chun be created crown prince by writing the proposal on paper and showing it to Emperor Shunzong. After Emperor Shunzong nodded to show approval, Li Chun was created crown prince on April 26.http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%ADs%A4%B8&yy;=21&ycanzi;=&mm;=3‚ÖÜ=&dcanzi;=%AC%D1%A4x At Li Chun's creation ceremony, Wang Shuwen was said to be so concerned about Li Chun's accession that, while he did not say anything directly, he was heard reading from Du Fu's poem about Zhuge ‚Äî \\"He had not even succeeded in his campaigns when he died. This often caused heroes to weep onto their collars.\\" Meanwhile, though, Wang Shuwen had begun to draw the displeasure of the powerful eunuch Ju Wenzhen (‰ø±ÊñáÁèç). In summer 805, when Wang Shuwen, wanting to strip the control of the imperial Shence Army from the eunuchs, had the general Fan Xichao (ËåÉÂ∏åÊúù) made the commanding general of the Shence Army soldiers at the western frontier with Han Tai as his deputy, the eunuchs were alarmed. Ju had Wang Shuwen promoted in title to be the deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé) ‚Äî but stripped of his imperial scholar status, making it impossible for him to be making decisions at Hanlin Institute. Wang Pi tried to intercede, but was only able to have Wang Shuwen allowed to visit Hanlin Institute once every three to five days to continue to look over the matters of state. Meanwhile, the eunuchs, believing that Wang Shuwen was intending them harm by giving Fan the command, instructed the Shence Army officers not to yield to Fan's orders. When Fan reached the frontier, none of the Shence Army officers came to greet him, and he was forced to return to the capital Chang'an. When Han Tai reported this to Wang Shuwen, Wang Shuwen became distressed but was unable to think of anything further to do. Around this time, also, Wei and Wang Shuwen began to break with each other, as Wei wanted not to be seen as a puppet of Wang Shuwen's. For example, when Yang Shi'e (ÁæäÂ£´Ë´§), a messenger from Xuanshe Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠ô, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), and Liu Pi, a messenger from Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), made demands on behalf of their superiors, Wang angrily wanted to execute both of them, but Wei opposed, and Yang was only exiled, while Liu Pi fled back to Xichuan. This incident created a substantial rift between Wang Shuwen and Wei. After Liu Pi returned to Xichuan, his commanding officer, the military governor of Xichuan Circuit, Wei Gao, further submitted a harshly worded accusation against Wang Shuwen and his associates. Wei Gao's words were soon echoed in petitions submitted by other regional governors Pei Jun (Ë£¥Âùá) and Yan Shou (Âö¥Á∂¨), and it was said that Wang Shuwen and his associates were greatly distressed. Meanwhile, Wang Shuwen's mother had become seriously ill to the point of near death. Wang Shuwen, anticipating that he would have to leave governmental service to observe a period of mourning for her, held a banquet and invited the other imperial scholars, as well as Li Zhongyan, Ju, and another powerful eunuch Liu Guangqi (ÂäâÂÖâÂ•á), to try to defend his actions with these eunuchs, including his attempts to have Yang and Liu Pi executed and his attempts to reform the economic regulations. Ju was thoroughly dismissive, and it was said that as Wang Shuwen made each point, Ju would rebut each point. On July 19, when his mother died, Wang Shuwen left governmental service.http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%ADs%A4%B8&yy;=21&ycanzi;=&mm;=6‚ÖÜ=&dcanzi;=%A4B%A4x It was said that after Wang Shuwen left governmental service, Wei Zhiyi further abandoned the alliance, drawing Wang Shuwen's anger and causing him and his associates to plan to have Wang Shuwen recalled to government to counteract Wei. Wang Pi submitted petitions to have Wang Shuwen recalled to governmental service and be made a chancellor, but none of Wang Pi's petitions were acted on. Wang Pi, seeing that the situation was hopeless, feigned a stroke himself and resigned. After this, Wang Shuwen's and Wang Pi's associates began to be purged from government. Li Chun was soon made regent, and on August 31, Emperor Shunzong yielded the throne to Li Chun (as Emperor Xianzong).  Death  Almost immediately after Emperor Xianzong took power ‚Äî indeed, even before he was ceremonially enthroned ‚Äî Wang Pi and Wang Shuwen were both exiled ‚Äî in Wang Shuwen's case, to become the census officer at Yu Prefecture (Ê∏ùÂ∑û, in modern Chongqing). In 806, Emperor Xianzong ordered Wang Shuwen to commit suicide.  Historical views of Wang Shuwen  The official histories of Tang Dynasty, the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang, both charactered Wang Shuwen as conniving, power-hungry, and insolent.New Book of Tang, vol. 168. These characterizations were adopted by the Zizhi Tongjian. The only positive characteristic that they attributed to Wang Shuwen was a sense of duty and a desire to improve the imperial government structure. However, as observed by such historians as the Qing Dynasty historian Wang Mingsheng (ÁéãÈ≥¥Áõõ), Wang Shuwen was trying to reform the imperial government in such a way as to strip power from powerful eunuchs and warlords and restore it to the emperor. Wang Mingsheng pointed out that there were a number of positive reforms carried out during Emperor Shunzong's brief reign that historians did not attribute to Wang Shuwen but which could only have been the result of Wang Shuwen's actions, including:See Wang Mingsheng's commentary, cited in the Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 57 [805]. * Exiling of the mayor of the capital municipality Jingzhao (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ), Li Shi (ÊùéÂØ¶), known for his harsh treatment of the people. * General pardoning of past taxes owed by the people. * Forbidding of improper tributes to the emperor. * Releasing of ladies in waiting from palace service. * Recalling and posthumous honoring of several key officials who had been unduly exiled during Emperor Dezong's reign. * Commissioning of Fan Xichao in an attempt to take back control of Shence Army. Wang Mingsheng compared Wang Shuwen to an overly aggressive daughter-in-law who tried to correct her mother-in-law in important matters as soon as she was married ‚Äî in other words, being attentive but being overly eager on his agenda, and believed that Wang Shuwen had committed no crimes.

Pir Nazeer Ahmed was born in 1880. His education started at an early age. Because former schooling was not available in the area, various scholars were invited to Mohra Sharif to teach him Persian, Urdu, Islamic Studies, Arabic, Sarf, Nahv, Hadith, Fiqh and other traditional subjects. Along with these, he was also trained in riding, swordsmanship and lancing. In 1892, when he was 12 years of age, his father Baba Ji Muhammad Qasim Sadiq took him to Kahyian Sharif to meet with Khwaja Nizam ad Din. During his first meeting with the Sheikh, Pir Nazeer Ahmed was given the Khilafat by the great Sheikh and Khwaja Nizam ad Din said to him ({Pir Nazeer Ahmed}) that your 7 posterities will be Wali ALLAH and that he instructed his father Baba Ji Muhammad Qasim Sadiq that he (Pir Nazeer Ahmed) will be his (Khwaja Nizam ad Din's) heir and he (Pir Nazeer Ahmed) will be Mujadid of his era . After returning from Kahiyan Sharif, he again went back to his studies and after sometime went into solitude in the neighboring Jungle. This routine, he continued for twelve years. During this time, he was married and his eldest son Mubarak Khan was born. Because his inclination was more towards solitude, the marriage did not work out and in 1906 he separated from his wife. In the meantime, he continued his education and Maulvi Ghulam Muhammad of Dandot stayed at Mohra Sharif for a year to teach him the complex matters of Islamic studies. Later two scholars Maulana Ghulam Kibriya Khan of Bihar and Maulana Abd ar Rehman stayed at Mohra Sharif and completed his formal education. References * Sufi Muhammad Rasheed (2006).

The company is traded on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol SPO.L; the stock is a component of the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE SmallCap Index. The company, formerly known as Rodime PLC, was originally an electronics company specialising in hard disk drives based in Scotland. In 2000, the company changed its name to Sportech PLC, after acquiring Littlewoods Pools from The Littlewoods Organisation for ¬£160 million. History Sportech began as a small electronics company, Rodime PLC, based in Scotland in 1979. By 1986, it was listed on the London Stock Exchange. The company specialized in manufacturing hard disks, inventing the 3.5-inch hard drive in early 1985, but soon became unprofitable due to delays in getting the product to market. By 1991, Rodime ceased manufacturing hard disks. By early 2000, Rodime was a shell company with a $34 million overdraft and four employees, primarily in the business of suing other hard drive vendors for patent infringements related to Rodime's 3.5-inch drive development work. The company negotiated patent-licensing settlements with Seagate Technology, Conner Peripherals, and IBM. In 2000, businessman Trevor Hemmings masterminded a deal that merged Rodime with the much larger Littlewoods Pools business. Littlewoods had been hurt by the advent of the lottery. After the acquisition, the company changed its name to Sportech PLC. Sportech purchased Scientific Games Racing, a division of Scientific Games Corporation, on 5 October 2010. Scientific Games Racing is one of three large bet-processing companies in the United States horse-racing industry, whose clients include major racetracks in California and New Jersey, as well as off-track betting companies in parts of New York state. Football pools Littlewoods' football pools were founded in 1923 by John Moores. The Vernons pools were established in 1925, and Zetters in 1933. The National Lottery, which was introduced in 1994, offered higher jackpots. This led to the decrease in popularity of the football pools.Munting, An Economic and Social History of Gambling in Britain and the USA, p. 141 The number of football-pool players declined from a peak of 10 million in 1994 to 830,000 in 2006. Subsequently, Vernons closed its doorstep collectors operation in February 1998, but ran a partnered lottery-base game with National Lottery during the 1998/99 football season. This helped it resume its business operations thereafter. In 2000, Littlewoods Pools was acquired by Rodime as part of a ¬£161 million deal Littlewoods Gaming. Rechristened Sportech, the company's Littlewoods brand bought Zetters, a football pool firm with 60,000 customers, in 2002 for ¬£1.35 million. It bought Vernons from Ladbrokes in 2007. The Littlewoods, Vernons, and Zetters pools were merged into one new brand, \\"The New Football Pools\\", in August 2008. In March 2017 Sportech announced that it has entered a ‚Äòconditional agreement‚Äô to sell its Football Pools division for ¬£83 million to ‚ÄòFP Acquisitions Limited‚Äô a newly created company controlled by the funds of London private equity firm OpCapita. Poker In 2001, Sportech was one of three firms worldwide to win gambling licences from the Isle of Man to run online casinos in there. Leveraging the Littlewoods brand name, it launched littlewoodscasino.com. Towards the end of 2003, Sportech decided to relocate its gaming operations from the Isle of Man to the Netherlands Antilles in order to broaden the range of games it currently offers. The terms of the Isle of Man were restrictive, with operators unable to advertise their services in jurisdictions that do not yet have legalised online gaming. The Isle of Man would force the company to undergo a recertification process in order to upgrade its software, and customers were limited as to how they could withdraw money from their accounts. Seeing a successful launch of the Littlewoods Casino product, the company wanted to move on and include Littlewoods Poker and an integrated jackpot product in their offering. Littlewoods Poker was launched in 2003. Company today In 2008, Sportech signed a strategic partnership with 888sport, replacing Cryptologic as the firm's software supplier. In their 2016 full year results Sportech announced profits before tax climbed to ¬£13.8m, compared to ¬£11.8m in 2015. In 2016 the company won a long-running battle with HMRC over a ¬£97m VAT repayment on one its games.

Wengert began his academic career as a member of the faculty of City College of New York (1948-51); was Professor of Political Science and Chair of the Social Science Department at North Dakota State University (1952-56); Professor of Public Administration at the University of Maryland, College Park (1956-59); Professor and Chair of the Department of Political Science at Wayne State University (1960-68); Visiting Professor of Public Administration at Pennsylvania State University (1968-69), and Professor of Political Science at Colorado State University (1969-87), where with Henry P. Caulfield, Jr. and Phillip O. Foss he helped establish its doctoral program in Environmental Politics and Policy. During this period he also served as Visiting Research Professor at the U.S. Army Engineering Institute for Water Resources (1969-70), was a Summer Fellow at Fonds f√ºr Umweltstudien, in Bonn, Germany (1973), and lectured at the University of Sarajevo in 1978. Wengert's scholarship explored the politics of natural resources and environmental policy formation and administration, with emphases in national energy policy, urban water planning and management, land use planning and controls, national forest management, and citizen participation in administrative processes. At a time when environmental issues were nascent in the public consciousness, Wengert was one of the few political scientists applying their skills in this area.Lester, James P.

Lawrence, eds. The Energy Crisis: Reality or Myth? Philadelphia: American Academy of Political and Social Science, 1973. Later in his career he advanced a seminal theory of the \\"politics of getting\\" in which he asserted: \\"American politicians will get as much as they can for their constituents, with only casual attention to the merits of the case and to the extent that they are not likely to be held directly accountable for costs\\".Wengert, Norman I.

Unafraid of courting controversy, he also published a research monograph that argued that the U.S. Forest Service had substituted its professional values for the legal requirements of their Organic Act of 1897 by allowing timber to be clearcut on the national forests for almost 80 years before they were authorized to do so by the National Forest Management Act of 1976.Wengert, Norman I., and A.A.

M. Coetzee. Woven around the existing plot of Robinson Crusoe, Foe is written from the perspective of Susan Barton, a castaway who landed on the same island inhabited by \\"Cruso\\" and Friday as their adventures were already underway. Like Robinson Crusoe, it is a frame story, unfolded as Barton's narrative while in England attempting to convince the writer Daniel Foe to help transform her tale into popular fiction. Focused primarily on themes of language and power, the novel was the subject of criticism in South Africa, where it was regarded as politically irrelevant on its release. Coetzee revisited the composition of Robinson Crusoe in 2003 in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech. Plot Susan Barton is on a quest to find her kidnapped daughter who she knows has been taken to the New World. She is set adrift during a mutiny on a ship to Lisbon. When she comes ashore, she finds Friday and Cruso who has grown complacent, content to forget his past and live his life on the island with Friday‚Äîtongueless by what Cruso claims to have been the act of former slave owners‚Äîin attendance. Arriving near the end of their residence, Barton is on the island for only a year before the trio is rescued, but the homesick Cruso does not survive the voyage to England. In England with Friday, Barton attempts to set her adventures on the island to paper, but she feels her efforts lack popular appeal. She tries to convince novelist Daniel Foe to help with her manuscript, but he does not agree on which of her adventures is interesting. Foe would prefer to set her story of the island as one episode of a more formulaic story of a mother looking for her lost daughter, and when he does write the story she wishes, fabulates about Cruso's adventures rather than relating her facts. Frustrating Barton's efforts further, Foe, who becomes her lover, is preoccupied with debt and has little time or energy to write about anything. Barton's story takes a twist with the return of someone claiming to be her missing daughter. Themes Analysts of the book have primarily focused on themes of power and language use, particularly as it relates to marginalized people. In 1994 Patrick McGrath of The New York Times claimed that one of Coetzee's central themes throughout his body of work is the \\"linkage of language and power, the idea that those without voices cease to signify, figuratively and literally\\"; McGrath pointed to Foe as the \\"most explicit expression\\" of that theme. Barton longs to tell her own story, but lacks the language to do so in a way that the public will accept. The agent she chooses to help give her the words necessary to communicate persists in erasing her history, by minimizing what she perceives as important and supplanting her remembered facts with adventurous fiction. As Foe takes over her tale, McGrath said, Barton \\"loses her voice in history, and thus her identity.\\" In addition to trying to preserve herself and her history, Barton is attempting to give voice to the even more graphically silenced Friday. Denis Donoghue of New York University stated that \\"the political parable [of the novel] issues from Friday's tonguelessness\\", as one of the central themes of the novel is the imperative to give voice to the oppressed. Barton sees Friday as caught on the edge of birth by his speechlessness, though she believes that his desire for liberation is explicit, if unspoken; Foe ‚Äì though wondering if those who are not speechless \\"are secretly grateful\\" for the opportunity to project their thoughts onto Friday ‚Äì believes that Friday could overcome his speechlessness by learning to write. While the book depicts the struggle to control text, Donoghue concludes that the undefined narrator of the book's finale (which Sam Durrant in \\"J. M. Coetzee, Elizabeth Costello and the Limits of the Sympathetic Imagination\\" pointed out could only have been written after the deaths of Barton and Defoe). is \\"the voice of the poetic imagination, its sympathies expanding beyond all systems to reach the defeated, the silenced‚Ä¶\\" Friday is afforded a final opportunity to tell his story, but can only communicate through the release of bubbles from his waterlogged corpse, a communication which neither the narrator nor the reader can interpret. David Attwell in J.M. Coetzee: South Africa and the Politics of Writing saw this inability of a silenced black character to communicate as central to the book, indicating that \\"Friday's enforced silence represents what a monocultural, metropolitan discourse cannot hear\\".Atwell, 5 South African writer Rian Malan also felt the racial gap was key, describing Foe as \\"the most profound book ever written about race relations in a society where whites were often separated from blacks by an abyss of linguistic and cultural incomprehension.\\" When Malan interviewed Coetzee for Time Magazine, he questioned the writer about this theme, who only replied, \\"I would not wish to deny you your reading.\\" Professor Manju Jaidka of Panjab University, Chandigarh noted that Barton, as a woman in a very masculine text, in herself represents \\"the minority, the marginalised, or the silenced other.\\" Jane Poyner in J.M. Coetzee and the Idea of the Public Intellectual highlighted the inherent tension in Barton's role, as she simultaneously struggles against the efforts of Foe to appropriate and misrepresent her story and unintentionally \\"'colonizes' Friday's story\\" herself as she interprets his silence. Critical reception Foe attracted criticism in South Africa upon its publication. According to Michael Marais in \\"Death and the Space of the Response of the Other in J.M. Coetzee's The Master of Petersburg\\", Foe met \\"acrimony, even dismay\\" at the time of its publication, as one of South Africa's \\"most prominent authors\\" seemed to turn his attention from compelling events in South Africa to \\"writing about the writing of a somewhat pedestrian eighteenth century novelist.\\" Marais, 83 In detailing that receipt, Marais quotes Michael Chapman in \\"Writing of Politics\\" as typical with his dismissive comment: \\"In our knowledge of the human suffering on our own doorstep of thousands of detainees who are denied recourse to the rule of law, Foe does not so much speak to Africa as provide a kind of masturbatory release, in this country, for the Europeanising dreams of an intellectual coterie\\"335, quoted in Marais, 84. Attwell, however, noted in 2003 that the novel is contextualized to Africa by the transformation of Friday from a Carib who looked nearly European to an African.Atwell, 108. In the United States, reception was less politically charged. The novel received a positive review in The New York Times, where Michiko Kakutani praised the writing as \\"lucid and precise; the landscape depicted, mythic yet specific\\", concluding that \\"the novel - which remains somewhat solipsistically concerned with literature and its consequences - lacks the fierceness and moral resonance of Waiting for the Barbarians and Life and Times of Michael K, and yet it stands, nonetheless, as a finely honed testament to its author's intelligence, imagination and skill.\\" Andrew O'Hehir for Salon described the novel as \\"a bit dry.\\" In his review for Time Magazine, Stefan Kanfer questions the impact of what he describes as an \\"achingly symbolic retelling\\", suggesting that readers may be more self-congratulatory for discovering the author's \\"brilliantly disguised\\" themes than moved by \\"urgencies that are neither fresh nor illumined.\\" Nobel acceptance speech When Coetzee was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Literature, he revisited the theme of composition as self-definition in his acceptance speech, entitled \\"He and his Man\\". Coetzee, who had lectured in character before, narrated a situation in which an elderly Crusoe quietly living in Bristol becomes the ambivalent muse of Defoe. According to The Guardian, this act of composition \\"write[s] \\"Defoe into existence, rather than the other way around.\\" Although Crusoe is the narrator of the piece, Coetzee indicated he did not know whether Crusoe or Defoe represented him in the lecture. By contrast, he clearly identified himself with Barton in Foe: \\"the unsuccessful author‚Äîworse, authoress.\\"Atwell, 112. NotesSources Further reading *\\"He and his Man\\", transcript.

For Celtic he was even greater and a stalwart for many a year. Shaw made his debut for the Bhoys in a 2‚Äì1 Glasgow Charity Cup win at Third Lanark on 6 May that year. With the fragile-looking Shaw in goals, Celtic's defensive record improved dramatically. But Shaw also had the intelligence to match his athleticism. He was a good reader of the game and he developed an understanding with Alec McNair and the other defenders. \\"Get it back tae Charlie!\\" was a common call. According to legendary Celtic manager Willie Maley: \\"Shaw, McNair and Dodds understood one another so well that they developed the pass-back into a scientific move of which there have been many imitators but none to equal the originators. It was indeed a spectacle to see either McNair or Dodds passing, with unerring accuracy and cheeky coolness, the ball to Shaw two yards away, with the opposing forwards almost on top of them. That was their method of getting out of a corner, which in all probability would otherwise have been fatal.\\" (Weekly News 25 July 1936) He became Celtic captain in September 1916 following \\"Sunny\\" Jim Young's retirement (1916) and his commanding voice was heard throughout games offering encouragement and instructions to his teammates. Shaw was also vocal off the pitch, and his criticism of the low wages many footballers were paid did not go down well among the affluent and influential in the Parkhead boardroom. This likely stemmed from his background coming from the mining village of Twechar. After leaving Celtic, Shaw emigrated to the United States to be player/manager of the New Bedford Whalers.Charlie Shaw, SoccerStats.usCeltic Soccer Legend Charlie Shaw Honored at Madonna Cemetery Ceremony, Patch, 7 April 2013 He died of pneumonia in 1938, in New York City. =Shoutout record= In the 1913‚Äì14 season, Shaw lost only 14 goals in 38 games, with 26 shut-outs along the away,Games involving Shaw, Charles in Season 1913/1914, FitbaStats which remains a record for Celtic.

It was awarded BPI Silver Certification on 19 July 1977. Recording sessions with its producer and orchestral arranger Rupert Holmes started in the summer of 1976 in the United States when Miles was promoting his first album \\"Rebel.\\" The bulk of the album was recorded in England. For this album, Miles recruited Australian keyboardist Gary Moberley because Miles felt that his previous album was missing something funky.http://www.john-miles.net/ Both \\"Remember Yesterday\\" and \\"Slow Down\\" charted in the UK (respectively 32 and 10) and would be the last Miles singles to chart in Britain until 1983. Although the singles did fairly well, the album itself barely cracked the top 40 of the UK chart. However, the cut \\"Slow Down\\" proved to be Miles' biggest US chart hit, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Disco chart, and No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1977. \\"Remember Yesterday\\" was written about Bob Marshall, who was according to Miles a very romantic type, because he drifted around from girl to girl. A track of the title song had been recorded during the sessions of Rebel and was originally planned to be released as the B-side of \\"Highfly\\", but was shelved. It was orchestrated by Holmes who added percussion in New York performed by recording legend Jimmy Maelen. \\"Manhattan Skyline\\" was written about the first impressions Miles and Marshall had of New York and was recorded entirely in Manhattan. In 1977, singer-songwriter Melissa Manchester covered the beautiful Miles- Marshall ballad \\"Time\\" which on \\"Stranger in the City\\" was performed solely by Miles at the piano accompanied by strings and brass.

As a technical term of Roman law, infamia was an official exclusion from the legal protections enjoyed by a Roman citizen, as imposed by a censor or praetor. More generally, especially during the Republic and Principate, infamia was informal damage to one's esteem or reputation. A person who suffered infamia was an infamis (plural infames). Infamia was an \\"inescapable consequence\\" for certain professionals, including prostitutes and pimps, entertainers such as actors and dancers, and gladiators. Infames could not, for instance, provide testimony in a court of law. They were liable to corporal punishment, which was usually reserved for slaves. The infamia of entertainers did not exclude them from socializing among the Roman elite, and entertainers who were \\"stars\\", both men and women, sometimes became the lovers of such high-profile figures as Mark Antony and the dictator Sulla. A passive homosexual who was \\"outed\\" might also be subject to social infamia, although if he were a citizen he might retain his legal standing.

Purpose and audience Sisters Vanessa and Jessica Valenti began Feministing in 2004 while working at the National Organization for Women's legal defense fund (now Legal Momentum), where Jessica felt that young feminists were being excluded from feminist discourse. She describes Feministing's purpose as \\"a way to get through the mommy filter\\" and make feminism more accessible to young women through giving an Internet presence for young feminists. Feministing covers topics ranging from outrage on measures to restrict reproductive rights or pay equity to irreverent or bemused coverage of pop culture and art, such as urinals shaped to look like vaginas. The writing on Feministing is not exclusively political, but also concerns feminist perspectives and observations from the staff's daily lives. Sex and sexuality are another frequent topic of discussion; it is sometimes cited as an Internet extension of the third-wave feminist movement. It is popular among young feminists. Feministing also has a comments section. Readers post (sometimes heated) comments on posts by the editorial board and post their own writing at their community portal. Staff Gwendolyn Beetham As of September 2013, Feministing had three co-executive directors: Lori Adelman (Partnerships), Maya Dusenbery (Editorial), and Jos Truitt (Development). In 2015 Adelman was named as one of The Forward 50. Alexandra Brodsky is an editor and columnist. The other staff columnists were Chloe Angyal (Senior Columnist), Katie Halper, Syreeta McFadden, Sesali Bowen, Ver√≥nica Bayetti Flores, Juliana Britto Schwartz, Mychal Denzel Smith, Katherine Cross, Gwendolyn Beetham (Academic Feminist Columnist), Dana Bolger, and Suzanna Bobadilla (Interviews Columnist). The site was supported by advertisements but all of the writers had day jobs. Former Feministing staff include former editors Vanessa Valenti, Ann Friedman, Miriam Zoila P√©rez, Courtney E. Martin, and Samhita Mukhopadhyay. =Retirement of Jessica Valenti= Valenti retired from Feministing in 2011. In a statement issued on 2 February, Valenti announced her retirement, arguing that her intention for the site was to provide a space for younger feminists outside the elite. Valenti states: :\\"Today, almost 5,000 posts later, I'm a 32-year-old feminist with a voice that is listened to. Largely because of the work I've done with Feministing, I have a successful platform for my work ‚Äì I've published books, written articles, and built a career as a speaker. Because I feel Feministing should remain a place for younger feminists to build their careers and platforms, I think it's appropriate to our mission that I step back.\\" Valenti continued to respond to articles using the comments forum, and Feministing writers frequently posted links to other work by both Valenti and Friedman.

History Rees was born in Gibraltar, the eldest son of Rowland Rees, of Sutrana House, Dover, and later alderman of Brighton, England. He was educated in Hong Kong and Sheffield. It has also been asserted that he was educated in Dover, where his father was for many years mayor. He emigrated to Adelaide in 1869; his brother, Dr. John Rees followed seven years later. Rowland (\\"something of a black sheep in the family\\"), along with his brothers Allen and Charles, \\"had all three received and squandered their inheritance\\" and were accordingly left nothing in their father's will; at any rate, having suffered \\"some kind of financial catastrophe\\" and moved into \\"a small terrace villa in Hove\\", the senior Rowland Rees left only enough to cover a few preliminary bequests.Ivy When Young- The Early Life of I. Compton-Burnett 1884-1919, Hilary Spurling, Allison & Busby, 1983, p. 135 Rees began his architectural practice immediately upon arriving in the colony, initially in partnership with Thomas English. His work was usually characterised by bold decorative elements such as capitals, pilasters and pediments. He was in partnership with J. A. Hornabrook from 1878 to 1881, when Hornabrook left for a life on the professional stage. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as member for The Burra (1873‚Äì75), Burra (1875‚Äì81) and Onkaparinga (1882‚Äì90). He advanced liberal ideas, such as free education, the regulation (rather than banning) of gambling, and equal divorce rights for women. Rees was a member of the South Australian Institute from 1878, and helped to select works for the South Australian State Collection. He was a director of the Holdfast Railway Company, for which firm he also acted as engineer.

He was mayor of Hindmarsh from December 1883 to December 1886, also serving as honorary Health Officer. He died of consumption (tuberculosis). His sister Kathleen Rees in 1883 married the widower Dr. James Compton-Burnett (c. 1840 ‚Äì 2 April 1901), 15 years his junior (so she was born around 1855). She had seven children by him, of whom Ivy Compton-Burnett (1884‚Äì1969) was the eldest; there were also five children by his first marriage.

The parish was founded in 1838 as the third parish in the city. The original parish boundaries intersected those of St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans and served the French community. In fact, the French tradition was so strong that sermons were not given in English until the 1880s. In later years, its parish boundaries overlapped the boundaries of Holy Trinity Church, which served German residents. The church was originally housed in a wood frame building built in 1838. In 1866, a red brick building was built, in the basilica plan, and the original frame building became a school. The church added a clock tower in 1924. Edward Ripoll, the original owner of Bud Rip's Bar in New Orleans and a Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1984 to 1988, organized a golf tournament in the 1980s to help with repairs to St. Vincent de Paul and to assist surviving families of police officers killed in the line of duty. In 2001, as part of a study of parish facilities, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans announced that five parishes in the area would be merged into one parish. Annunciation, St. Cecilia, St. Gerard (a parish for the hearing-impaired), Sts. Peter and Paul, and St. Vincent De Paul were merged into a new parish, Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos. The new church was located in the church and facilities of St. Vincent De Paul. On May 25, 2003, the building was severely damaged by a fire. The main altar was destroyed, along with several murals and the sacristy. As part of the repairs, the former altar from Sts. Peter and Paul Church was moved to Blessed Seelos Parish, along with the pulpit from St. Cecilia. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused further damage to the nearby St. Gerard Center (the former Motherhouse of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception), forcing the church to replace the roof.

Life and career His father was a wine-merchant who played the flute, while his mother played the piano. At 16, having finished his school studies, he went into the family business. Having learnt the piano and tried some composition, at 18 he studied harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Julien Fernand Vaubourgoin, director of the Bordeaux Conservatoire, although Beydts never enrolled there. Through Vaubourgoin he gained a strict classical harmonic technique.James Stevens. Louis Beydts (1895-1953). Opera, December 1953, Vol.4 No.12, p747. Beydts also studied with Andr√© Messager to whom he paid homage in Moineau with a variation on the theme of the swing duet. During the First World War Beydts was mobilized, only returning to civilian life in 1919, picking up his much-appreciated studies with Vaubourgoin until 1924. His parents were supportive of their son's musical ambitions.Landormy P. La Musique Fran√ßaise apr√®s Debussy. Gallimard, Paris, 1943. In Paris he had a work for voice and orchestra Le Sommeil performed at the Concerts Lamoureux in 1926. In 1927 Adieu was performed by the Concerts Colonne, and Le Promenoir des deux amants at the Concerts Pasdeloup. His first attempt at operetta was Le Bourreau des c≈ìurs (unperformed), but he went on to write others: MoineauA complete audio performance is available via the website L'encyclop√©die multimedia de la com√©die musicale th√©√¢trale en France (1918-1940) (http://comedie-musicale.jgana.fr/index.htm), accessed 28.01.09.(originally entitled La Noce, staged at the Th√©√¢tre Marigny on 13 March 1931) with limited success.Caubert A. Notes to INA Memoire Vive IMV064. In November 1931 la S A D M P (la Soci√©t√© amicale des messieurs prudents) with words by Sacha Guitry, was seen at the Th√©√¢tre de la Madeleine, and on 22 December of the same year le Club les Canards mandarins was performed in Monte Carlo. Another collaboration with Guitry Voyage de Tchong-Li was staged in March 1932. Beydts was among the last generation of composers to conserve and develop the traditional French op√©rette.Traubner R. Operetta ‚Äì a Theatrical History. Oxford University Press, 1983. Beydts composed A l‚Äôaimable Sabine and m√©lodies such as La lyre et les amours (cycle, 1938), Jeux Rustiques (Joachim du Bellay, 1936), M√©lancolie, Quatre Odelettes, 1929 ; Quatre Humoresques, 1932; Quatre Chansons, 1935 (Chansons pour les oiseaux (Heyse): La colombe poignard√©e; Le petit pigeon blue; L'oiseau bleu; Le petit serin en cage); le Coeur inutile, as well as a suite for 14 instruments. He was one of seven composers to contribute to an oratorio Jeanne d'Arc (co-sponsored by the Association Jeune-France), first performed on 28 April 1942 conducted by Charles Munch at the Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire. His D‚Äôombre et de soleil was first performed on 2 February 1947 in a Conservatoire concert, with soloist Ninon Vallin and Beydts himself conducting.Kern Holoman D. Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire. . Accessed 2.06.09.

Les Joachim, une famille de musiciens. Fayard, 1999. He finished his career as Director of the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris from 1952 to 1953, with the 50th anniversary production of Pell√©as et M√©lisande and the first French production of The Rake's Progress.Wolff S. Un demi-si√®cle d'Op√©ra-Comique (1900-1950). Andr√© Bonne, Paris, 1953. An important figure in Parisian musical life, Beydts was a close friend of the cellist Pierre Fournier.Hughes A. Pierre Fournier, cellist in a landscape with figures. Ashgate, Aldershot and Brookfield, 1998. He died at Caud√©ran in Gironde. On the day of his funeral, he was honoured in a simple and moving ceremony at the Op√©ra-Comique after the curtain for Act I of The Rake's Progress - the curtain rose to reveal the cast and management of the theatre facing the house, and Louis Musy, spoke a brief obituary, requested a minute's silence after which the curtain fell slowly. His musical style has been described as traditional, classical, clear, melodic and of indisputable elegance. His favourite composers were Faur√©, followed by Debussy, Gounod, Messager, Ravel and Piern√©. Another writer acknowledged his \\"natural spontaneous melodic style strengthened by a fertile invention\\" and that he showed an \\"unerring and resourceful instinct\\" in setting French verse; his settings of Tristan Klingsor, Tristan L'Hermite and Henri de Regnier \\"constantly bewitch by their delicate melodic tracery, their suppleness and freedom of line\\". His conducting may be heard on the recording of Messager's Isoline and his own La Lyre et les Amours with Pierre Bernac, and A travers Paris.

Often the result is a modeling tool for that language. MetaCASE tools are thus a kind of language workbench, generally considered as being focused on graphical modeling languages. Another definition: MetaCASE tools are software tools that support the design and generation of CASE tools. In general, metaCASE tools should provide generic CASE tool components that can be customised and instantiated into particular CASE tools. The intent of metaCASE tools is to capture the specification of the required CASE tool and then generate the tool from the specification.A rapid development model for metaCASE tool design, Conceptual Modeling ‚Äî ER '97, Maokai Gong, Louise Scott, Yingping Xiao and Ray Offen, Overview=Quick CASE tools overview= Building large-scale software applications is very complicated process which is not easy to handle. Software companies must have good system of cooperation throughout developing teams and good displicine is highly required. Nevertheless, using CASE tools is modern way how to speed up software development and ensure higher level of application design. However, there are another issues which has to be kept in mind. First of all usage of these tools doesn't guarantee good results because they are usually large, complex and extremely costly to produce and adopt. CASE tools can be classified as either front-end or back-end tools Definition In: D. Schefstrom, ‚ÄòSystem Development Environments: Contemporary Concepts‚Äô in Schefstrom, D and van den Broek, G (eds) Tool Integration John Wiley and Sons (1993). depending on the phase of software development they are intended to support: for example, ‚ÄúFront-end‚Äô analysis and design tools versus ‚ÄúBack-end‚Äù implementation tools. For a software engineers working on a particular application project, the choice of CASE tool would typically be determined by factors such as size of project, methodology used, availability of tools, project budget, and numbers of people involved. For some applications, a suitable tool may not be available or the project may be too small to benefit from one. CASE tools support a fixed number of methodologies but software development organizations dynamically change their adopted methodologies. =Quick metaCASE tools overview= MetaCASE products are usually highly specialised, application development environments which produce a custom tool(set) from a high level description of the required tools. IPSYS Toolbuilder Manual, Version 2.1 Lincoln Software Ltd (1996)G. Stumer, Oracle 7: A User‚Äôs and Developer‚Äôs Guide International Thomson Publishing (1995) So in other words metaCASE technology approaches the methodology automation from a dynamic perspective. MetaCASE tools allow definition and construction of CASE tools that support arbitrary methodologies. A CASE tool customizer first specifies the desired methodology and customizes the corresponding CASE tool. Then software developers use that CASE tool to develop software systems. An advantage of this approach is that the same tool is used with different methodologies, which in turn, reduces the learning curve and consequently the cost. Any desired methodology can be automated or modified by the developing organization which provides a dynamic capability in today's dynamic and competitive world. From another perspective this technology can be used as a practical teaching tool considering the shortened length of development and learning times that suits academic course periods. =Differences between metaCASE and CASE tools= Most CASE tools for object-oriented modeling are heavily based on the UML method. A method also dictates other CASE tool functions, such as how models can be made, checked and analyzed, and how code can be generated. For example, a tool can generate CORBA IDL definitions only if the modeling language can adequately specify and analyze CORBA compliant interfaces. If the tool (and method) does not generate them, it offers very little, if any, support for work on interface design and implementation. When using methods developers often face similar difficulties. They can not specify the domain and system under development adequately because the method does not provide concepts or notations for the task at hand. End-users may find the models difficult to read and understand because they are unfamiliar with the modeling concepts. Typically they also find it difficult to map the concepts and semantics used in the models to their application domain. After creating the models, which fail even to illustrate the application domain adequately, the tool does not provide the necessary reports nor does it generate the required code. What is needed then is the ability to easily capture the specifications of any method and then to generate CASE tools automatically from these specifications. Later when the situation in the application domain evolves and the development environment changes you may incrementally update the method support in your CASE tool. This is exactly what metaCASE technology offers. ABC TO METACASE TECHNOLOGY, WHITE PAPER, MetaCase, 5605 North MacArthur Blvd. 11th Floor, Irving, Texas 75038 =How metaCASE works= Traditional CASE tools are based on a two-level architecture: system designs are stored into a repository, whose schema is programmed and compiled into the CASE tool. This hard-coded part defines what kind of models can be made and how they can be analyzed. Most importantly, only the tool vendor can modify the method, because it is fixed in the code. MetaCASE technology removes this limitation by providing flexible methods. This is achieved by adding one level above the method level. MetaCASE tools are based on a three-level architecture: # The lowest, the model level, is similar to that of CASE tools. It includes system designs as models. # The middle level contains a model of the method, i.e. a metamodel. A metamodel includes the concepts, rules and diagramming notations of a given method. For example, a metamodel may specify concepts like a class and an inheritance, how they are related, and how they are represented. However, instead of being embedded in code in the tool, as in a fixed CASE tool, the method is stored as data in the repository. The use of metamodels has recently become more popular. Many method books now include metamodels of their method, and several important innovations, such as XMI, are metamodel-based. Unlike a CASE tool, a metaCASE tool allows the user to modify the metamodel. Hence, metaCASE is based on the flexibility of the method specifications. # This is achieved by having a third, higher level that includes the metamodeling language for specifying methods. This level is the hard-coded part of the metaCASE software. All the three levels are tightly related: a model is based on a metamodel, which in turn is based on a metamodeling language. Clearly, no modeling is possible without some sort of metamodel. This dependency structure is similar to that between objects, classes and metaclasses in some object-oriented programming languages. metaCASE tools This is a list of currently available metaCASE tools; many other modeling tools may also offer some measure of metamodeling functionality * DOME * GME * MetaEdit+ * MetaDONE * Obeo Designer * Whole Platform * ConceptBase Real benefits of using metaCASE tools Jackson Jackson, M.A., Software requirement & Specifications A lexicon of practice, principles and prejudices Addison Wesley, ACM Press, 1995 recognises the vital difference between an application‚Äôs domain and its code: two different worlds, each with its own language, experts, ways of thinking etc. A finished application forms the intersection between these worlds. The difficult job of the software engineer is to build a bridge between these worlds, at the same time as solving problems in both worlds. Empirical studies Necco, C.R., Gordon, C.L., Tsai, N.W. Systems Analysis and Design: Current Practices, MIS Quarterly, December, 1987.Fitzgerald, B., The use of system development methods: a survey. Paper ref 9/95, Univ. College Cork, 1995. have consistently shown that only around half of all development projects use methods. Among those using methods, over 50% either modify the methods to better fit to their need or even develop their own methods Russo, N., Wynekoop, J., Walz, D., The use and adaptation of system development methodologies. Procs of International Conference of IRMA, Atlanta, May 21-14, 1995.Hardy, C., Thompson, J., Edwards, H., The use, limitations and customisation of structured systems development methods in the UK. Information and Software Technology, 37 (9), 1995. In a standard CASE tool, the method supported by the tool is fixed: it cannot be changed. In a metaCASE tool, there is complete freedom to change the method, or even develop an entirely new method. Both models and metamodels (method descriptions) are stored as first-class elements in the repository. This allows an organisation to develop a method that suits their situation and needs, and to store and disseminate that knowledge to all developers. The tool and method then guide developers, provide a common framework for them to work in, and integrate the work of the whole team.Visual domain-specific modelling: Benefits and experiences of using metaCASE tools, Steven Kelly, MetaCASE Research prototypes and even commercial metaCASE tools have existed for many years, but only recently have there been tools which are mature, user-friendly and stable for both the method developer and the method user.

He first studied at the Saint Jovan Bigorski Monastery, then he moved to Ohrid in 1836, where he was taught by Bulgarian educator Dimitar Miladinov; he also studied at the Greek schools in Thessaloniki and Istanbul. Trizlovski became a monk at the Bulgarian Zograf Monastery on Mount Athos, where he acquired his clerical name. Zografski continued his education at the seminary in Odessa, Russian Empire; he then joined the CƒÉpriana monastery in Moldavia. He graduated from the Kiev seminary in 1846 and from the Moscow seminary in 1850. He was briefly a priest at the Russian church in Istanbul until he established a clerical school at the Zograf Monastery in 1851 and taught there until 1852. From 1852 to 1855, he was a teacher of Church Slavonic at the Halki seminary; from 1855 to 1858, he held the same position at the Bulgarian school in Istanbul, also serving at the Bulgarian and Russian churches in the imperial capital. On 29 October 1859, at the request of the Bulgarian Municipality of Kukush (Kilkis), the Patriarchate appointed Zografski Metropolitan of Dojran in order to counter the rise of the Eastern Catholic Macedonian Apostolic Vicariate of the Bulgarians. Parteniy Zografski co-operated with the locals to establish Bulgarian schools and increase the use of Church Slavonic in liturgy. In 1861, the Greek Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Thessaloniki and a clerical court prosecuted him, but he was acquitted in 1863. In 1867, he was appointed Metropolitan of Nishava in Pirot.

He co-operated with the Bulgarian Books magazine and the first Bulgarian newspapers: Savetnik, Tsarigradski Vestnik and Petko Slaveykov's Makedoniya. In 1857, he published a Concise Holy History of the Old and New Testament Church. The following year he published Elementary Education for Children in Macedonian vernacular. In his article Thoughts about the Bulgarian language published in 1858 he argues that it is the Macedonian dialect that should represent the basis for the common modern \\"Macedono-Bulgarian\\" literary standard, called simply Bulgarian.Bechev, Dimitar. Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia Historical Dictionaries of Europe. Scarecrow Press. 2009; p. 134. . In 1870 Marin Drinov, who played a decisive role in the standardization of the Bulgarian language, rejected the proposal of Parteniy Zografski and Kuzman Shapkarev for a mixed eastern and western Bulgarian/Macedonian foundation of the standard Bulgarian language, stating in his article in the newspaper Makedoniya: \\"Such an artificial assembly of written language is something impossible, unattainable and never heard of.\\"Makedoniya July 31st 1870 Tchavdar Marinov.

Macedonian literary scholars maintain Zografski‚Äôs literary works published in western Macedonian vernacular make him a leading representative of the \\"Macedonian National Rebirth\\". Father Partenij wish of using the western Macedonian vernacular as the basis for a standard Bulgarian language is interpreted by the Macedonian literary scholars as a two-way Bulgaro-Macedonian compromise, not unlike the one achieved by Serbs and Croats with the 1850 Vienna Literary Agreement.Bechev, Dimitar. Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia Historical Dictionaries of Europe. Scarecrow Press. 2009; p. 245. . On the other hand Zografski, who was Bulgarian teacher and bishop, regarded his vernacular as a version of Bulgarian. He called the Macedonian dialects Lower Bulgarian and the region of Macedonia Old Bulgaria. On that base Bulgarian literary scholars, maintain that his idea about a common literary standard was not for compromise between Bulgarian and Macedonian languages, as Macedonian authors claim, but about a common language for all the Bulgarians.Tchavdar Marinov.

However historians from North Macedonia maintain the designation Bulgarian used by Zografski meant in fact Macedonian.Lucian Leustean as ed., Orthodox Christianity and Nationalism in Nineteenth-century Southeastern Europe, Oxford University Press, 2014, , p. 257. Macedonian researchers claim that the term \\"Bulgarian\\" at that time was not used as an ethnic designation.Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996, Peter Lang, 2010, , p. 92. Zografski died in Istanbul on 7 February 1876 and was buried in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church.

A doctor at the Kamloops Home for Men in the 1920s, he was able to interview many veterans of the province's early gold rush, including many of the more famous names in the history of the Cariboo Road, the Cariboo Gold Rush and the Overlanders of 1862 led by Thomas McMicking.The Cariboo Road, Mark Sweeten Wade, prefaceThis is Cariboo, Robin Skelton, Introduction He also wrote on medical legislation and hospital policy in the province of British Columbia as well as a biography of explorer Alexander Mackenzie. His works have served as an important source of biographical and historical detail by later historians. Biography :This section is paraphrased from \\"Dr. Mark Sweeten Wade\\", an unpublished typescript by Mary Gulliford on the Kamloops Museum and Archives website. He was born in Sunderland, County Durham, England on November 23, 1858. His parents were John Wade of Stockton-on-Tees and his mother was Mary Sweeten of Barnard Castle. After an education in British public schools (what would in North America be called private schools) and matriculated in the Faculty of Medicine at Durham University. He emigrated to Canada in 1881 and pursued further studies in medicine at Fort Wayne, Indiana and returning to Canada in 1882 was hired as a medical officer for the Canadian Pacific Railway survey with the party surveying the Qu'Appelle, Regina, Moose Jaw and Swift Current area. In the fall of that year he returned to school at the University of Toronto General Hospital, finishing in 1883. He returned to England for a short visit, then upon re-entry to Canada at Victoria, B.C. registered as a medical practitioner and took land in the Surrey area near his brother Edmund Wade, practicing there until 1884. He hired on with Andrew Onderdonk's construction operations for the Canadian Pacific Railway, then based in Spences Bridge and Savona. There he met Emma Uren, daughter of James Bottrell Uren, who ran the local hotel and also the ferry, on March 10, 1885. Upon the completion of the CPR he moved to Clinton and was the resident physician there until 1889. In 1889 Wade went to San Francisco to study medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, returning to live in Victoria after graduation and practicing medicine there until 1895. During a major smallpox epidemic in 1892 he was appointed Chief Medical Officer of the province by Premier Theodore Davie. In 1895, he moved to Kamloops and open practice as an ear, nose and throat specialist in offices across from that city's Dominion Hotel. A growing interest in newspaper writing led to his appointment as Editor of the Inland Sentinel when that paper's editor and publisher, F.J. Deane, was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for Yale-West (which Kamloops was in at the time) and needed to be freed up from his editorial activities to pursue politics in Victoria and around the riding. Although the provincial legislature as yet did not have political parties, both men were ardent Liberals and the newspaper espoused Liberal politics. In the same year he was appointed doctor for the Provincial Home for men and the local jail, and in 1899 he was appointed coroner and in 1900 elected vice-president of the Kamloops Liberal Association and also elected to the Board of Trade. Deane lost re-election in 1902 to F.J. Fulton and due to most such appointments in the province being from patronage, Wade also lost his position as jail doctor and coroner. Deane bought the Nelson Miner in 1902 and renamed it the Nelson Daily News, with Wade also contributing to it as a writer. In 1904 Deane sold the Inland Sentinel to Wade, who continued publishing it as a small paper covering only local and district news. In 1910, he tied the paper into a wire service and expanded it to eight pages as a weekly, covering world news and little local news. Wade's activities on the Board of Trade and a group known as the 10,000 Club (which like others of its time sought to promote growth in the city to a population of 10,000), Wade engaged in an advertising campaign to draw industries to the city, promoting ventures such as a tourist hotel, steamboat service on the North Thompson River, a cannery, a creamery, a flour mill and a cold storage plant.. As part of his promotional zeal and in time for the Christmas sales market of 1907, Wade published The Thompson Country, which biographer Mary Gulliford notes was error-ridden and \\"had an air of carelessness. It was probably due to increased demand for advertising of the Kamloops district that caused the hurried job.\\" Wade also took part in the city's negotiations with the Canadian National Railway concerning sites for stations and shops in the Kamloops area for that railway's expansion of a line to the Okanagan. Wade helped organized the memorial service for King Edward VII, held in the city's Riverside Park and was on the city's welcoming committee when Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier came to town. He sold the Sentinel in 1912 and was elected alderman in 1913, retiring from the position and touring Europe briefly in 1914, returning to serve as a member of the medical board examining new recruits for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. During his lifetime Wade wrote two books other than The Thompson Country. Mackenzie of Canada: The Life and Adventurers of Alexander Mackenzie, Discoverer was the first biography ever published on the famous explorer. His The Overlanders of '62, which had been commissioned by the provincial government, was unfinished at the time of his death and was edited and published by provincial Archivist and Librarian John Hosie in 1932. His biographer summarizes > \\"It was said of Wade as a historian \\"no pains in research were too > strenuous\\" and certainly The Overlanders displays this trait. He possessed > every scrap of evidence on the Overlanders that was to be had in diaries and > correspondence and by word of mouth. The book is very meticulous and a > fascinating work.\\" Wade died in 1929 leaving his wife Emma and son M. Leighton; another son, Daryl Fred, had died in 1920 after operating as an auto mechanic in Kamloops from 1912 and serving in the war from 1916 onwards to its completion. M. Leighton earned a [Bachelor of ScienceB.Sc.] from McGill University and was involved in construction of the Mt. Olie power plant near Kamloops in 1913 and later supervised construction of hydroelectric development at Adams Lake, also becoming superintendent of the East Kootenay Power Co. in 1930 and from 1934 onwards was in charge of the Kamloops area highway department.

The book was first published by Doubleday on February 1, 1988, five months after the release of Jackson's 1987 Bad album, and named after Jackson's signature dance move, the moonwalk. The book contains a foreword by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It reached number one on the New York Times Best Seller list. The book was reissued by Doubleday on October 13, 2009 following Jackson's death on June 25, 2009.  Production  Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who was an editor at Doubleday, secured the book deal and paid Jackson a $300,000 advance. As part of the deal Jackson wanted Onassis to write a foreword, which she initially refused not wanting her name on any books she worked on but agreed to three paragraphs. She also edited the book.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jackson-jackieo/michael-jackson-book- a-headache-for-jackie-o-idUSTRE5631S420090704 The first manuscript of the book was written by Robert Hilburn and was refused by the publishers, Doubleday, because it lacked \\"juicy details\\". A second manuscript was written by Stephen Davis, which Jackson drastically edited. Jackson finally decided to write the book himself, with help from Shaye Areheart (although there were reports that Areheart later quit after Jackson threw a snake at her).Campbell (1993), p. 197 Due to the public interest in Jackson, Moonwalk was prepared for publication in secret. Relatives of Doubleday employees were hired as couriers, to deliver portions of the book from the company's head office in Manhattan to the printing plant in Fairfield, Pennsylvania.McDowell, Edwin. \\"Michael Jackson writes his story\\", The New York Times, 18 April 1988. At the printing plant, the book was given the code name \\"Neil Armstrong\\", after the first \\"moonwalker\\". Narrative Dedicated to Fred Astaire, the book discusses Jackson's show business friends, girlfriends and his rise to fame. The book also discusses Jackson's appearance and thoughts on plastic surgery.Tucker, Ken. \\"Firing your father isn't easy.\\", The New York Times, 5 June 1988. Jackson stated that up to that point, he had two rhinoplastic surgeries and the surgical creation of a cleft in his chin.Jackson, p. 229‚Äì230 He attributed the change in the structure of his face to puberty, weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hair style and stage lighting. In the book, Jackson tells of the beatings he received from his father, Joseph. While rehearsing with The Jackson 5, Jackson stated that when they messed up they \\"got hit, sometimes with a belt, sometimes with a switch.\\" The singer added that his father was \\"real strict\\" and \\"something of a mystery\\". In September 1988, Jackson telephoned his father to apologize for some of the material in the autobiography. He explained that he hadn't written the book himself and that the critical content was written by \\"someone else\\".Taraborrelli, p. 395 The singer also reveals how much he has been hurt by the press, asking, \\"What happened to truth? Did it go out of style?\\" Reception Moonwalk debuted at number one on both the British newspaper The Times and the Los Angeles Times bestseller lists. Reaching number two in its first week on The New York Times Best Seller list, Moonwalk reached number one the following week. Within a few months of its release, Moonwalk had sold 450,000 copies in fourteen countries. Ken Tucker, of The New York Times, stated that if the book had been written by anyone else, it would be dismissed as \\"an assiduously unrevealing, frequently tedious document.\\" However, he adds that \\"these are precisely the qualities that make it fascinating\\". Re-release Moonwalk was re-released on October 13, 2009 as a result of Michael Jackson's death, with a new foreword by Motown founder Berry Gordy and afterword by Shaye Areheart.

It was a significantly below average season, having only four fully tropical named storms, the fewest since 1930. It was one of only five Atlantic hurricane seasons since 1944 to have no major hurricanes, the others being 1968, 1986, 1994, and 2013. The season officially began on June 1, 1972 and ended on November 30, 1972. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical systems form. However, storm formation is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated in 1972 by the formation of Subtropical Storm Alpha on May 23. The season's final storm, Subtropical Storm Delta, dissipated on November 7. The season produced nineteen tropical or subtropical cyclones, of which seven intensified into tropical or subtropical storms; three became hurricanes, of which only but only one, Betty, had sustained winds greater than minimum hurricane force. Despite its relative inactivity, the 1972 season resulted in one of the worst natural disasters in American history, Hurricane Agnes. Agnes was a weak but large storm that initially made landfall on the Florida Panhandle before moving up the eastern United States. The hurricane killed 122 people and caused $2.1 billion (1972 USD) in damage, mostly due to flooding in Pennsylvania and New York. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. It includes information that was not released throughout the season, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as a storm that was not initially warned upon, has been included. By convention, meteorologists one time zone when issuing forecasts and making observations: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and also use the 24-hour clock (where 00:00 = midnight UTC).

Early life Larkin as a West Point cadet Larkin was born in Louisburg, Wisconsin and attended the Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington. In 1915 he graduated from the US Military Academy at West Point (\\"the class the stars fell on\\") and was sent to Mexico in 1916 with the 2nd Engineers. After returning to the US he graduated in 1917 from the Engineer School at Washington Barracks, Washington, D.C. and in December was sent to France. He was awarded the Silver Star for his reconnaissance efforts during the Second Battle of the Marne during July 1918. From 1921-1923 he served as the Assistant Military Attache for the American Embassy in Tokyo, Japan. In 1927 he graduated from the Army Industrial College; in 1929 from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; and in 1938 from the Army War College. Marriage and children Larkin would marry Mary Irwin. She was the daughter of William, a United States Navy Commander, and Elizabeth Irwin. One of their sons, Harrison S. Larkin, was a First Lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was killed when his plane crashed on April 28, 1950. The Larkin Conference Center at Fort Lee was named for Lieutenant Larkin. Another son, Thomas B. Larkin, Jr., was a Lieutenant in the United States Navy. All four Larkins, as well as the Irwins, are buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Through the Irwins, Larkin was also a relative of Rear Admiral Harold Percival Norton, also buried at Arlington. Military career Larkin served a tour of duty in the Panama Canal Zone as Supervisory Engineer in charge of Third Locks Project, and as Special Assistant to the Governor of the Canal Zone in charge of special civil defense. In WWII, he was personally selected by Major General John C. H. Lee in May 1942 to serve as Chief of Staff, Headquarters, Services of Supply, U.S. Army Forces, British Isles. He served under Lee in the opening months of the Operation Bolero buildup in Britain, until (USMA classmate) Lt. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower requested he be split off from the ETO for Operation Torch, the Invasion of North Africa beginning on 8 November 1942. In February 1943 he became Commanding General, Services of Supply in the North African Theatre, and later Commander for the Communications Zone in North Africa, and would continue in this role through the invasions of Sicily, Italy, and then southern France in August 1944. For his efforts in supplying the combat troops during the Tunisian Campaign he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal in June 1943. He was also awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster to the Distinguished Service Medal in November 1944 for his support of the 5th Army in Italy, and his role in planning the invasion of southern France. He remained in this capacity for the Operation Dragoon France invasion, and served under Lt. Gen. Jacob L. Devers, who took over in January 1944, in the now-larger Mediterranean Theater of Operations the until the fall of Nazi Germany.

Most are powered by diesel engines, but Kleinloks with steam, petrol, or electric engines were also produced. After testing several trials locomotives, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) placed various types of such locomotives into service from 1930 onwards. Industrial lines and railway workshops generally procured engines of the same design. In Switzerland Kleinlokomotiven were used as light rail motor tractors.  History  In order to speed up goods traffic and meet the challenges posed by emerging competition from road traffic, various national railways in Europe carried out trials with small diesel- powered shunters starting in 1923. Until then, all shunting movements for goods wagons at small stations and loading yards had to be carried out by the locomotive in charge of the local goods train (Nahg√ºterzug). This extended waiting times and reduced the average speed of the train considerably, but having a dedicated shunting engine at such stations would not have been economically viable due to the low levels of goods traffic. The development of combustion-engined locomotives offered new possibilities here: the Kleinlokomotiven were smaller, cheaper and easy to operate. It was anticipated that the resulting improvement in the speed at which goods could be moved would enable railways to compete with road transport. The first trials - in 1923 by the French Eastern Railway, in 1925 by the Danish State Railway, in 1925 by the Dutch Railways, and in 1927 by the Reichsbahn - were very promising. As a result, in 1930, the Deutsche Reichsbahn issued the first orders to various manufacturers for a total of 18 trials locomotives. A 1927 shunting unit delivered by the Berliner Maschinenbau AG to the Dutch State Railways served as a prototype. These vehicles were very different from one another, with varying performance. For its subsequent orders, in 1931 and 1932, the DRG specified the dimensions and divided the locomotives into two power categories ‚Äì locomotives with an engine power output of up to 40 PS (29 kW) were allocated to power group I and more powerful locomotives to power group II. Based on its experience with the earlier engines, the Kleinlokomotiven were then standardised by the DRG as Einheitskleinlokomotive (standard small locomotives).  Classification = DRG classification system = The first Kleinloks to be completed in 1930 were initially given the letter class V for Verbrennungsmotor (combustion engine) or A for Akkumulatorlokomotive (accumulator or battery-driven locomotive) followed by a serial number, beginning at 6000. To make a better distinction between the various types of Kleinlokomotiven, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) introduced a new system in 1931, as part of which the concept of a Kleinlokomotive was first unequivocally laid down. Traction engines that only worked in railway workshops or at repair shops (Ausbesserungswerken) were not counted as Kleinlokomotiven. The class letter K was now used to identify them. This was followed by a letter indicating the type of engine: b stood for petrol engine (Benzol, lit: \\"benzene\\"), d for steam engine (Dampfmaschine), √∂ for diesel engine (√ñl, i.e. oil) and s for a battery-driven electric engine (Speicher, i.e. accumulator battery). The next letter indicated the type of transmission: e for electric power transmission (Elektrogetriebe) and f for hydraulic transmission (Fl√ºssigkeitsgetriebe). Kleinlokomotiven with purely mechanical transmission were not given a specific third letter and those whose batteries were charged by a diesel or petrol engine were classified as K√∂e and Kbe respectively. These letters were followed by a four-figure number, which indicated the power of the Kleinlok. Locomotives in power group (Leistungsgruppe) I were given numbers up to 3999; locomotives in power group II numbers from 4000 onwards. The numbers ran sequentially within each group. In 1944, the letter g was introduced for locomotives powered by generator gas (Generatorgas). Like the other DRG classification schemes, the classification for Kleinlokomotiven was retained by the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) and the Deutsche Reichsbahn after the Second World War. In 1955, the Deutsche Bundesbahn raised the boundary between power groups I and II from 40 PS to 50 PS. In 1956, a new power group III was introduced for Kleinlokomotiven with an engine power output over 150 PS and they were allocated operating numbers from 10000 to 20000. In 1960,the Deutsche Bundesbahn changed the code letter s to a. = 1968 DB numbering scheme (West Germany) = Beginning on 1 January 1968, Kleinlokomotiven in the DB were placed into new classes in the 300 series. The second figure indicated the power class (based on the 1955 groups). The third digit varied depending on top speed and the type of brake or drive (chain drive or Gelenkwellenantrieb). Ka locomotives were allotted to classes 381 (pre-war types) and 382 (newer types). The existing narrow gauge Kleinlokomotiven on the Wangerooge Island Railway were grouped into Class 329. In 1987, the DB Class 260/261 diesel locomotive (the pre-1968 Class V 60) was classed as a Kleinlokomotive so that it could be crewed by shunting staff who had not been trained to work locomotives on the open line. They were consequently reclassified as 360/361 engines. = 1970 DR numbering scheme (East Germany) = The DR's new numbering plan, introduced on 1 July 1970, placed all existing Kleinlokomotiven into Class 100, i.e. into the standard range of numbers for combustion-engined locomotives. Locomotives in power group I became sub-class 100.0 and locomotives in power group II went into sub-classes 100.1‚Äì100.9. The narrow gauge Kleinloks of both power groups were also grouped into sub-class 100.9 until 1972, but were then moved to Class 199. Prior to 1970, however, newly built Kleinlokomotiven in the DR had not been given the class letter K, but were allocated, for example, to Class V 15 (later 101). In the DB/DR common numbering scheme of 1992, the DR's Class 100 locomotives became Class 310.

His book The Creative City: A Toolkit for Urban Innovators became a movement to rethink the planning, development and management of cities. He has chaired multiple urban innovation juries including The European Capital of Innovation Award ‚Äì iCapital, New Innovations in the Creative Economy (N.I.C.E.) and Actors for Urban Change. He is a fellow of The Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. He is credited for his attempt to rethink city making through his work on intercultural cities, the psychology of cities, creative bureaucracies and the measurement of creativity in cities ‚Äì the latter developed with Bilbao and now assessed through in-depth studies of 25 cities. Previously he founded the think tank Comedia in 1978, which pioneered the connection between culture, creativity and city transformation. Early life Charles Landry was born in 1948 and brought up and educated in Britain, Germany and Italy. Landry was born in London to German parents who had escaped from the Nazis. His father Harald was a philosopher and Nietzsche specialist and his mother an artist. He was educated at the Nymphenburger Gymnasium in Munich, Keele University in Staffordshire and Johns Hopkins in Bologna where he was assistant to Lord Robert Skidelsky. His dissertation was on problems of post-industrial society. Career Landry was assistant to Lord Kennet, a former Labour government minister, on the Europe Plus Thirty an EEC study on forecasting (1973-1974) commissioned by Lord Ralf Dahrendorf. With colleagues he started Publications Distribution Co-Op in 1975, a company focused on distributing alternative literature and media for the then burgeoning system of non-mainstream publishers and bookshops. In parallel he was a specialist bookseller focusing on radical publications. In 1978 he founded Comedia, a think tank, publisher and consultancy. Comedia undertook much of the early work highlighting the importance of cultural resources as well as a methodological framework and evidence for what is now known as the creative economy, formerly cultural industries. Its publishing programme provided some of the intellectual backdrop to the emergence of cultural studies, involving authors such as Dave Morley, Ken Worpole, Geoff Mulgan. The provocative What a way to run a Railroad: An Analysis of Radical Failure (1985) assessed how the high failure rate of radical projects could be understood. Subsequently, Landry was criticized as being ‚Äòa left wing Thatcherite‚Äô. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, a changing group of people developed projects concerned with urban life, culture and creativity and the future of cities including also Franco Bianchini, Phil Wood, Sir Peter Hall, Jude Bloomfield and Naseem Khan. After producing more than 100 books Comedia publishing was sold to Routledge in 1988. Initially Comedia's publishing wing was most well known for research and projects on the future of cities. Later Comedia's research became better known with long term projects including The Creative City, Culture at the Crossroads, The Art of Regeneration, Richness of Cities, and Creativity at the Heart of Culture.  Outlook and concepts  Charles Landry's focus shifted in 1986 towards the concept of \\"the creative city\\", a term he coined in response to the dramatic economic and social changes happening at that time. He argues that in such changing circumstances creativity at every level is required to address and adapt appropriately. He posits that conditions need to be created for people to think, plan and act with imagination in harnessing opportunities or addressing seemingly intractable urban problems. This means a city needs to embed a culture of creativity in the way it operates and to infuse how all of its organisations operate. Initially there was a focus on the contribution of the arts and the creative industries in driving innovation in cities and helping to make them distinctive. Increasingly he has focused on civic creativity and emphasised how the organizational culture needs to change to unleash the potential, resources and assets of a city. Traditional hierarchical structures restrict ideas generation and rethinking. This has been elaborated in his work on the Creative Bureaucracy. He contrasts the urban engineering approach to cities with creative city making. In the former there is a focus on the physical infrastructure or the hardware of the city, in the latter equal attention is paid to both hardware and software issues. Software is the human dynamics of a place, its connections and relationships as well as atmosphere. The publication of the John Howkins' book The Creative Economy (2001) and Richard Florida's The Rise of the Creative Class (2002) gave the creativity cities movement added popularity. In his follow up book, The Art of City Making (2006) he discusses \\"the sensory landscape of cities\\" and how creativity needs to change its focus and be linked to an ethical foundation. This he calls being creative \\"for the world\\" so cities give something back to the wider community. He argues that the popularity of the term \\"creativity\\" is in danger of hollowing out the concept and making it meaningless. A main focus of creativity should be on addressing global issues and behavioural issues such as climate change or the balance between rich and poor. In addition a role of creativity is to help make cities more distinctive given the danger of homogeneity and global branding. Work with his colleague Phil Wood has focused on the idea of The Intercultural City (2008). This looks at how diversity in cities can become an advantage and whether diversity can lead to innovation and wealth creation. Interculturalism goes beyond equal opportunities and respect for existing cultural differences, to the pluralist transformation of public space, institutions and civic culture. His overall aim has been to shift the intellectual architecture for city making. A series of short books have extended this concern, such as The Sensory Landscape of Cities, Culture & Commerce, The Fragile City, Cities of Ambition, The Digitized City, Psychology & the City. The Civic City in a Nomadic World (2017) focuses on where we belong when everything is on the move and how we create places of encounter and empathy. In 2008 he developed The Creative Cities Index with Jonathan Hyams in collaboration with Bilbao. This assesses cities in terms of their comprehensive creativity economically, socially and culturally along four clusters: their capacity to nurture potential, the regulatory and incentives regime, the ability to harness and exploit creativity and the lived experience of place. The danger of the creativity agenda is that it too narrowly conceived and becomes hollowed out. His latest work emphasizes the need for civic creativity which is imaginative problem- solving applied to public good objectives.

Watson was born in Dundee, Scotland on 7 March 1860. He specialised in sanitation and was regarded as a pioneer in the development of sewage treatment. Watson was engineer to the Birmingham and District Drainage Board and also General Manager to the Birmingham, Tame and Rea District Drainage Board.. At Birmingham he was responsible for the construction of the first large-scale percolating filter plant, a complete departure from the traditional land treatment in use in the city and elsewhere. Other changes that he introduced, based on his work in Birmingham, were the separation of sludge digestion, the extraction of methane from sewage for use in power generation and the introduction of flocculation prior to the percolating filter. He drew up plans for sanitation works in the district of Aberdeen which included a pumping station at Denmill, reservoir at the Hill of Ord and water supply to the district of Culter. These plans are now held by the National Archives of Scotland. Watson became General Manager of Birmingham Agricultural College by 1920 where he undertook investigations into tuberculosis in cattle. By 1920 he was also a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and a fellow of the Royal Sanitary Institute. Watson was elected president of the ICE for the November 1935 to November 1936 session.. In his retirement he joined his son, David Mowat Watson, who was also a member of the ICE, in his private engineering consultancy practice. Watson died in Birmingham in 1946.
