It is located approximately two miles northeast of Forest Grove, one mile east of Oregon Route 47 in the Tualatin Valley. The community is part of the Forest Grove Rural Fire Protection District. History Verboort was named for early settler Father William Verboort in 1876. Verboort post office was established in 1893 and ran intermittently until 1919. The community was founded by six Dutch Catholic families. The group was led by John Verboort, who had traveled from the Netherlands with his family and first settled in Wisconsin. In 1875, the group, unhappy with the soil and weather in Wisconsin, bought 550 acres of land in the Verboort area and shared a large house. Father William Verboort, son of John, joined family later that year. Father Verboort and the community built St. Francis Xavier Church, and an informal school was founded at the same time. In 1883, a new church was built and named Our Lady of the Visitation, while the old church was converted into a schoolhouse. The Sisters of St. Mary of Oregon established a convent in Verboort in 1891, and by longstanding tradition, local families provide the sisters with produce. In 1922, the school at Verboort and the Sisters of St. Mary who taught there were affected by the Oregon Compulsory Education Act, which was later overturned by the United States Supreme Court. The current Visitation Church building, with 150-foot sequoias on either side, was constructed in 1959. The sequoias were planted in 1888 by John Porter, who brought the seeds back to Oregon from California after returning from the California Gold Rush of 1849. The church at Verboort established successful missions in Hillsboro, Cornelius, Forest Grove, and Roy (another Dutch Catholic community), which all became self- supporting parishes. Arts and culture =Annual cultural events= The annual Verboort Sausage and Sauerkraut Festival, founded in 1934, is held on the first Saturday in November; proceeds go to the upkeep of the church school. The festival, with its sausage and sauerkraut dinner, attracts between 7,800 and 10,000 people each year, while the line for purchasing bulk sausage and sauerkraut starts forming four or five hours before sunrise. In 2008, 15 tons of sausage and 2,000 pounds of sauerkraut were produced for the event. The sausage is smoked using green vine maple wood. =Museums and other points of interest= Along with the Catholic church and its pioneer cemetery, notable sites in the community include the 1864 house of Henry Black, on whose Donation Land Claim the Verboort family originally settled, the 1921 William Hermans Granary, the 1921 Verboort Garage and General Repairing building, and the 1876 Martin Hermens House and Farm.

Academic background and scientific research  Cornsweet is known for documenting the effect that bears his name in the 1960s. Prior to his work on this particular optical illusion, Cornsweet graduated from Cornell University and enrolled in a graduate program at Brown University, operating in the vision research laboratory of Lorrin A. Riggs. During his graduate studies he was co-author of an early paper describing stabilized images. His 1955 Ph.D. dissertation in experimental psychology involved small movements of the eye. Cornsweet was an assistant professor at Yale University from 1955‚Äì1959, and then became professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. His interest in psychophysics led him to develop a widely employed improvement in the staircase method. As an outgrowth of the courses he taught, Cornsweet published a frequently-cited textbook.  Inventor and entrepreneur  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Cornsweet was a key member of the Bioinformation Systems Group at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). While also teaching in the psychology department at Stanford University, he designed or co-designed several innovative instruments for measuring properties of the eye, including eyetrackers, auto-refractors, and optical fundus scanners. He left SRI to become Chief Scientist at Acuity Systems, where he developed the first commercial auto-refractor in 1973. During this time, Cornsweet continued to invent devices for measuring various properties of the eye and also to teach, first at the Baylor College of Medicine and later at the University of California, Irvine. Note: Part of The Linguistic Reporter (1959‚Äì1982), Volume 25, published in 1982. He served as Vice President of research and development for Sensory Technologies from 1994 to 1997. In 1999 Cornsweet retired from UC‚ÄìIrvine and co-founded Visual Pathways, where his team developed an automated retinal imaging system intended for the diagnoses of glaucoma, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. Visual Pathways folded after several years after shipping only 24 devices. Until his death in 2017, Cornsweet was Professor of Cognitive Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Ophthalmology, Emeritus, University of California, Irvine. From 2013 to 2015, he was Chief Scientist at Brien Holden Vision Diagnostics (formerly Quantum Catch), a company developing low-cost ophthalmic instruments for detection and monitoring of disease.

Life Roux-Spitz was born 13 June 1888 in Lyon. The son of an architect, he entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, Lyon in the studio of Tony Garnier and then became a student in the workshop of Gaston Redon and Alfred Henry Recoura at the National School of Fine Arts in Paris. He won the Prix de Rome in 1920. He moved to Paris on his return from Rome in 1924. Influenced by Auguste Perret, he made a characteristic building of his style - with bay windows to 3 sides on the front - at 14 Guynemer street in Paris. He repeated that form in several works, such as the Quai d'Orsay, known as the \\"White Series\\". He was appointed editor in chief of The Architect between 1925 and 1932, then joined the Board of Patrons of the journal L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui in 1930. He again became editor of the French magazine Architecture between 1943 and 1950. Roux-Spitz used these various forums to defend the position of modern architects, but opposed the radical principles of Le Corbusier. He was also a professor of theory at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in 1940. Official duties included chief architect of civil buildings and national palaces, and architect of the postal services. He was chief architect of the National Library in 1932 and remained so until 1953, in this post making a rearrangement within the current Richelieu site and construction of an annex to Versailles. On 29 March 1945, he was appointed chief architect for reconstruction of the township of Nantes.

(UK) during the 2000s.R.L. Clarke, B.J. Dougherty, S. Harrison, P.J. Millington, S. Mohanta, US 2004/ 0202925 A1, Cerium Batteries, (2004).R.L. Clarke, B.J. Dougherty, S. Harrison, J.P. Millington, S. Mohanta, US 2006/0063065 A1, Battery with bifunctional electrolyte, (2005). In this rechargeable battery, both negative zinc and positive cerium electrolytes are circulated though an electrochemical flow reactor during the operation and stored in two separated reservoirs. Negative and positive electrolyte compartments in the electrochemical reactor are separated by a cation-exchange membrane, usually Nafion (DuPont). The Ce(III)/Ce(IV) and Zn(II)/Zn redox reactions take place at the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Since zinc is electroplated during charge at the negative electrode this system is classified as a hybrid flow battery. Unlike in zinc‚Äìbromine and zinc‚Äìchlorine redox flow batteries, no condensation device is needed to dissolve halogen gases. The reagents used in the zinc-cerium system are considerably less expensive than those used in the vanadium flow battery. Due to the high standard electrode potentials of both zinc and cerium redox reactions in aqueous media, the open-circuit cell voltage is as high as 2.43 V. Among the other proposed rechargeable aqueous flow battery systems, this system has the largest cell voltage and its power density per electrode area is second only to H2-Br2 flow battery. Methanesulfonic acid is used as supporting electrolyte, as it allows high concentrations of both zinc and cerium; the solubility of the corresponding methanesulfonates is 2.1 M for Zn, 2.4 M for Ce(III) and up to 1.0 M for Ce(IV). Methanesulfonic acid is particularly well suited for industrial electrochemical applications and is considered to be a green alternative to other support electrolytes. The Zn-Ce flow battery is still in early stages of development. The main technological challenge is the control of the inefficiency and self discharge (Zn corrosion via hydrogen evolution) at the negative electrode. In commercial terms, the need for expensive Pt-Ti electrodes increases the capital cost of the system in comparison to other RFBs. Cell chemistry At the negative electrode (anode), zinc is electroplated and stripped on the carbon polymer electrodes during charge and discharge, respectively. :Zn2+(aq) + 2e‚àí Zn(s) ::(‚àí0.76 V vs. SHE) At the positive electrode (cathode) (titanium based materials or carbon felt electrode), Ce(III) oxidation and Ce(IV) reduction take place during charge and discharge, respectively. :Ce4+(aq) ‚àí e‚àí Ce3+(aq) ::(ca. +1.44 V vs. SHE) Because of the large cell voltage, hydrogen (0 V vs. SHE) and oxygen (+1.23 V vs. SHE) could evolve theoretically as side reactions during battery operation (especially on charging). The positive electrolyte is a solution of cerium(III) methanesulfonate. History and development The zinc‚Äìcerium redox flow battery was first proposed by Clarke and co-workers in 2004, which has been the core technology of Plurion Inc. (UK). In 2008, Plurion Inc. suffered a liquidity crisis and was under liquidation in 2010 and the company was formally dissolved in 2012. However, the information of the experimental conditions and charge-discharge performance described in the early patents of Plurion Inc. are limited. Since the 2010s, the electrochemical properties and the characterisation of a zinc‚Äìcerium redox flow battery have been identified by the researchers of Southampton and Strathclyde Universities. During charge/discharge cycles at 50 mA cm‚àí2, the coulombic and voltage efficiencies of the zinc‚Äìcerium redox flow battery were reported to be 92 and 68%, respectively. In 2011, a membraneless (undivided) zinc‚Äìcerium system based on low acid concentration electrolyte using compressed pieces of carbon felt positive electrode was proposed. Discharge cell voltage and energy efficiency were reported to be approximately 2.1 V and 75%, respectively. With such undivided configuration (single electrolyte compartment), self-discharge was relatively slow at low concentrations of cerium and acid. Major installation of the zinc‚Äìcerium redox flow battery was the > 2 kW testing facility in Glenrothes, Scotland, installed by Plurion Inc. The use of mixed acid electrolytes for the positive half-cell has been investigated as a mean to increase the kinetics of the cerium redox reaction in State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resource Utilization and the Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, China. Platinum-iridium coatings have shown the best performance as positive electrodes for the battery, while being less expensive than platinum electrodes. Charge-discharge of the system has been preliminarily simulated. Research on mixed acids continues and it has been shown that low concentrations of hydrochloric acid can improve the electrochemical response of the cerium reaction, while nitric acid additions had negative results. Hierarchical porous carbon as the positive electrode has yielded better performance than carbon felt in laboratory scale experiments. The zinc electrodeposition on the negative electrode has been studied using a Hull cell. Carbon paper has also been studied as an alternative material for the positive electrode. Graphene oxide-graphite composites have shown some promise as a better catalytic electrode material for the reaction of cerium in the positive electrolyte. A similar cerium-lead RFB has been proposed. Indium- modified electrodes have been suggested as an alternative to conventional graphitised carbon as negative electrodes. The Zn-Ce system has introduced the use of this acid to other flow batteries as a better alternative to sulphuric acid. The relationship between cell potential and current density has been estimated for a Zn-Ce unit flow cell. This permitted to rationalise the contribution of the thermodynamic, kinetic and ohmic components of the battery voltage and to assess the effect of increasing inter-electrode gap. The development of the Zn-Ce battery has been recently reviewed, as well as the electrochemical technology of cerium conversion for industrial applications, which include energy storage, nuclear decontamination, indirect organic synthesis, destruction of hazardous organics and gas scrubbing.

The basilica next to the castle. Coat of the Lords of Xavier, now shield the town of Javier. The Castle of Xavier (; ) is located on a hill in the town of Javier (Navarre, Spain), 52 km east of Pamplona and 7 km east of Sang√ºesa. Built in the 10th century, this castle was the birthplace and childhood home of Saint Francis Xavier, son of the Lords of Xavier, hence his surname. The town of Javier belonged to the Kingdom of Navarre which was always its own kingdom, never belonging to France.  Etymology  The name Xavier derives from Basque Etxeberri or 'new house', evolving thereafter into \\"Javier\\" in Navarro-Aragonese and Spanish.  Construction  Consists of three buildings with different antiquity. The \\"Tower of the Kristo Santua\\" is the main fortified building and chapel, holding an interesting Late Gothic crucifix and a series of murals depicting the dance of the death, unique in Spain. The \\"Tower of Homage\\", call also the San Miguel Tower, is the oldest in the castle. It also harbors the museum dedicated to the life of the saint. In its foundations Muslim vestiges have been unveiled, possibly dating from the 10th century. In the 11th century, the first enclosure that sheltered the early surround rooms. In the 13th century, two polygonal bodies and two flanking towers were added in all four cardinal directions.  History  The castle and village of Xavier were won by Sancho VII of Navarre in approximately 1223. An Aragonese noble got a loan of 9,000 sols from the King of Navarre, with the latter receiving Xavier as a warranty. The Aragonese noble could not afford to pay in due time, so the stronghold became property of Sancho. It was not the first time nor the last, since Sancho VII was one of the major lenders to the Crown of Aragon, and took over a number of villages and castles in return for his unpaid loans that notably strengthed of his border with Aragon: Esc√≥, Pe√±a, Petilla, Gallur, Trasmoz, S√°daba, etc. In 1236 the castle was handed over by King Theobald I to Ad√°n de Sada. Before the Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre, the castle belonged to Maria Azpilikueta, native of Baztan Valley, married to Joanes Jatsukoa, parents, amongst others, of Francis Xavier, whose family defended the independence of the kingdom. For this reason, the Spanish regent Cardinal Cisneros ordered the complete demolition of the castle in 1516, but only held a topping of the strong part of it:I√±aki Sagredo Garde. \\"Navarre.

After successive inheritance, the ownership of the castle, along with the rest of the town of Javier, went to the House of Villahermosa.

She exhibited in London, Beijing, Hong Kong and at exhibitions in Scotland. She was a member of and exhibited with the Royal Scottish Academy 1915-1968.Charles Baile de la Perriere, ed., The Royal Scottish academy exhibitors 1826-1990 : a dictionary of artists and their work in the annual exhibitions of the Royal Scottish Academy, 1991, entry under Hotchkis, Miss Anna MaryJoanna Soden, \\"Anna Mary Hotchkis,\\" in Elizabeth Ewan, Sue Innes, and Sian Reynolds, eds., The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women (Edinburgh University Press 2007): 171.  Early life  Hotchkis was born in Crookston House, Renfrewshire, Scotland (near Glasgow). She had three sisters, Margaret, Catherine and Isobel (1879‚Äì1947, also a painter), and six brothers, only one of whom, Richard, is known to have survived into adulthood. Hotchkis inherited a love of painting from her mother and wanted to be an artist from age 14.Interview in Glasgow Herald, 9 September 1982 She began formal training at Glasgow School of Art at age 21, despite objections from parents who were worried about her delicate health. Her family moved to Edinburgh in 1907, and she enrolled at Edinburgh College of Art studying under Robert Burns for three years. She completed her studies but left without taking a diploma. Around this time, three of the sisters Anna, Margaret and Isobel, went to Munich to study art under Hans Lasker. At the suggestion of her Edinburgh teacher, Hotchkis set up a studio in the small town of Kirkcudbright, initially rented then bought from Jessie M King, an acquaintance of her teacher. She kept the studio from 1915 until her death in 1984.  First encounter with China  In 1922 Hotchkis travelled to China via the United States, Japan and Korea to visit her sister Catherine in Mukden (now Shenyang), where since 1915 she had established and worked in girls‚Äô school for the YWCA. After Mukden, she spent three months in Shanghai, where she held an exhibition of her work. While painting child labourers at a cotton factory there she caught a severe infection, which caused her to return to Mukden and then move to Peking for treatment. She decided to stay in Peking to take up an offer to fill in for the art teacher at Yenching University. Hotchkis taught at Yenching for a year and then returned to Scotland in 1924, travelling on the Trans-Siberian Express to Moscow, where she stayed with the Quaker mission, then home to London via Berlin. She brought back with her over 70 pictures which she exhibited in the Brook Street Gallery in London.The Evening News, Glasgow, 24 April 1925 She returned to China in 1926, lodging with a Chinese family in Peking, where she remained until the Japanese invasion of China in 1937.  Travels in China  In July 1924, while in convalescence at her sister's holiday house at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, she had first met the American painter Mary Mullikin who, hearing there was a fellow artist in town, rode over on a donkey to introduce herself.Recalled by AH in an interview in the Glasgow Herald, 10 March 1973 Despite Hotchkis living in Peking and Mary in Tianjin, the two became good friends and after Hotchkis‚Äôs return to China travelled extensively together, writing several books and articles about their travels there. Their first trip together was to Japan and Korea in 1927. In 1929 Hotchkis visited her sisters in the UK, travelling via Japan and Los Angeles. She returned to China the following year, and in September 1931 she and Mary made their first trip to the Yungang caves near the city of Datong in northern Shanxi province. They returned there the following June, having conceived the idea of publishing a book about the cave sculptures of Yungang, to be illustrated with their own paintings and drawings. They returned from Yungang the long way round, via Hangzhou and the sacred island of Putuoshan, one of the Four Great Mountains of Buddhism in China. In an attempt to find an English publisher for their intended book Hotchkis again visited the UK later in 1932, but she returned empty-handed. While in London she held another exhibition in the Brook Street Galleries, this time including paintings of the Yungang caves by Mary Mullikin as well as her own. A notice in The Times was favourable: \\"As much for their enterprise and courage as for their judgement and talent are these ladies to be praised. Ignoring the usual interests of the globe-trotter, they have concentrated on artistic and archeological values peculiar to the places visited, which few have the opportunity to see.\\"The Times of London, 15 April 1933 Eventually they found a publisher for the book in Peking, Henri Vetch, whose Librairie francaise specialised in books in English and French on Chinese themes. Having agreed to publish their first book, Vetch now suggested they travel around China to all the most sacred Buddhist and Taoist mountains for another book. Meanwhile, a planned trip to Kaifeng and Luoyang in 1934 had to be cancelled because of fighting between warlords in the area, but in October 1934 the two artists managed to spend a week painting on Mount Tai in Shandong province, the pre-eminent sacred peak of the Taoists and one of the mountains Vetch suggested. This was apparently Hotchkis‚Äôs first trip there although Mary had been several times already. In 1935 Hotchkis moved into a house in Xie He Hutong in the eastern district of Peking. The house had been rented since 1931 by Laurence Sickman, an American later to become the Director of the Nelson- Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, and his mother. When Sickman returned to the US in 1935, his mother wished to stay in Peking and invited Hotchkis to share the beautifully furnished traditional courtyard house.Described in Harold Acton, Memoirs of an aesthete, London 1948, 323-4. In the spring of 1935 Mary came to Peking to stay with Hotchkis and celebrate the publication by Vetch of their book on the Yungang caves. On 27 August they set out from Peking on the journey first suggested by Vetch, a self-styled \\"pilgrimage\\" to the sacred mountains. This they completed in two formidable journeys, over two months in the autumn of 1935 (to northern Heng Shan, Wutai Shan and Hua Shan) and four months in the spring and summer of 1936 (to Song Shan, Emei Shan, southern Heng Shan and Jiu Hua Shan). On the steep slopes of Hua Shan in Shanxi province, the 50 year old Hotchkis suffered heart strain, but after resting in Beijing through the winter of 1935-36 was fit to continue.  Return to Scotland  In July 1937 the Japanese Army, which had occupied the northern Chinese province of Manchuria since 1932, invaded the rest of China, taking Peking in August. Hotchkis reluctantly decided to leave China, returning by ship via Japan, then Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, India and Iraq to Greece. Another ship took her via Constantinople to Venice, where she caught a night train to Paris, and then back to London, where she arrived in April 1938, some five months after leaving Peking.. Hotchkis settled back in her studio in Kirkcudbright in Scotland. In 1940 she visited friends in Paris, where characteristically she caught one of the last boats from France to England during the German invasion.Glasgow Herald 9 September 1982 Back in Scotland during the war, she worked as a supervisor in a cordite factory in Dalbeattie for 10 months, before being forced to retire from the war effort due to ill health and return to Kirkcudbright to paint.Glasgow Herald, 10 March 1973 After the war she travelled extensively in Europe and North America, and made two trips to Hong Kong where Henri Vetch had re-established his publishing business. Her and Mary‚Äôs second book, The Nine Sacred Mountains of China, was finally published there in December 1973, 37 years after the pilgrimage it documented. Active and exhibiting almost until the end of her life,Her last exhibition seems to have been for the Travelling Art Gallery, based in Edinburgh, at the age of 95: Galloway News, 12 February 1981 Hotchkis died peacefully in Kirkcudbright in 1985, in her 100th year. She never married or had children.

Federal Communications Commission, 535 U.S. 467 (2002), is a United States Supreme Court case in which Verizon Communications argued that the FCC had an unreasonable way for setting rates for leasing network elements. It held that the FCC can require state commissions to set the rates charged by incumbents for leased elements on a forward-looking basis untied to the incumbents' investment and that the FCC can require incumbents to combine elements of their networks at the request of entrants..  Background  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 left the FCC freedom to define the standard for leasing rates with very few details. This led to Verizon questioning if the FCC is authorized to be able to require state utility commissions to set the rates charged by the incumbents for leased elements. The court focused on three main issues, which were the FCC's pricing rules for these unbundled network elements, also whether the exclusion of historical costs in the pricing rules constitutes a governmental taking, and lastly, various rules for combining network elements. It focused primarily on the economic implications of the FCC's costing standards which the Court upheld and secondarily on the takings claim. = Telecommunications Act of 1996 = The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows the FCC the ability to require state utility commissions to set rates charged by incumbent local exchange carriers for lease of network elements to competitive local exchange carriers on a forward-looking basis, untied to the incumbents' historical or past investments. The methodology of doing this by the FCC is not inconsistent with the act therefore is reasonable. The Act contains unbundled access obligations of local exchange carriers: > The duty to provide, to any requesting telecommunications carrier for the > provision of a telecommunications service, nondiscriminatory access to > network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on > rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and > nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the > agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252. An incumbent > local exchange carrier shall provide such unbundled network elements in a > manner that allows requesting carriers to combine such elements in order to > provide such telecommunications service.P.L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 > (1996). = Pricing network elements = The Historical cost is the cost of using long-lived assets in any given period which depends on the original costs of assets. In the telecommunications industry these have the trend of dropping over time due to technological innovation and progress. This cost calculating method may then overstate the current long run marginal cost which is why, in contrast, the FCC uses a \\"forward-looking\\" cost, referred to as Total Long Run Incremental Cost, or TELRIC, which uses current replacement costs instead of the original cost in its methodology. Under the Telecommunications Act, Bell Operating Companies, which includes Verizon, have the incentive to unbundle their elements. If conditions are met, elements that are unbundled need not be offered at TELRIC and prices only need to avoid being \\"unjust, unreasonable, or unreasonably discriminatory.\\" Enough interconnection, unbundling and resale agreements with the companies can foster competition.  Opinion of the Court  = Arguments = The case was decided in an opinion written by Justice David Souter. The Respondent, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), received six out of eight votes with Justices Stephen Breyer and Antonin Scalia dissenting. In the certiorari from the Supreme Court to the Appeal court they state, ‚ÄúIn order to foster competition between monopolistic carriers providing local telephone service and companies seeking to enter local markets provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 entitle the new entrants to lease elements of the incumbent carriers local-exchange networks‚Äù. In five separate cases they argued over the FCC's regulations though ultimately the Court of Appeals held that the use of the TELRIC methodology was foreclosed because the Act plainly required rates based on the actual cost of providing the network element and invalidated certain combination rules.Verizon Communications v.

He is a professor emeritus of economics at Ohio University and senior fellow at The Independent Institute. Biography Vedder was born on November 5, 1940. He earned his bachelor's in economics in 1962 from Northwestern University in 1962 and his Ph.D in economics from the University of Illinois in 1965. He has since studied U.S. economic history, particularly as it relates to public policy. Some of his research has involved American immigration, economic issues in American education, and the interrelationship between labor and capital markets. Vedder serves as an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a think tank known for mostly libertarian and conservative perspectives. He has served as an economist with Congress' Joint Economic Committee. In his role with the AEI, he later testified before the Committee on October 30, 2008. He is also director of the Center for College Affordability and ProductivityCenter for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington, D.C. Public commentary =Higher education= Vedder wrote in his June 2004 book Going Broke by Degree: Why College Costs Too Much that American universities have become less productive and less efficient in recent years as well as more likely to shift funds away their core mission of teaching. He also criticized rising tuition costs. He proposed as a broad solution moving state universities toward free market competition and privatization. He specifically recommended as well that colleges expand distance learning, cut out non- educational programs, modify tenure, raise teaching loads, and reduce administrative staffs. On May 27, 2011, Vedder appeared on the news/public affairs TV program PBS NewsHour and stated that since \\"the cost of college is rising relative to the benefits of college,\\" but \\"learning outcomes are stagnant or falling in this country,\\" American society must \\"open up opportunities for people to consider a variety of different options after high school, one of which is college, but there are many others.\\" Vedder also stated that \\"as many as one out of three college graduates today are in jobs that previously or historically have been filled by people with lesser educations, jobs that do not require higher-level learning skills, critical thinking skills, or writing skills or anything of that nature.\\" =Government spending= Vedder and writer Stephen Moore wrote in the Wall Street Journal editorial page in March 2011 that every new dollar of new taxes leads to more than one dollar of new spending according to their research. Thus, they found evidence in favor of the \\"Feed the Beast\\" theory: that increasing taxes for the purported purpose of balancing the budget leads only to the government spending such inflows. =U.S. bailout= In the aftermath of the late-2000s financial crisis, Vedder stated that he \\"somewhat reluctantly\\" supported the $700 billion bailout package included in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. He attributed the crisis to governmental failure and \\"public policy miscues,\\" saying the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 \\"never would have happened\\" in \\"the absence of these governmental mistakes.\\" = Walmart wages = Vedder wrote, along with Wendell Cox, the December 2006 book The Wal-Mart Revolution in which they asserted that criticisms of wage practices at WalMart are \\"unfounded.\\" He argued that Walmart workers are \\"paid fairly\\" given their skill and experience, and he stated that they also receive side benefits such as health insurance that is fairly similar to competing firms. He further argued that communities with new Walmart stores have greater total employment and higher incomes. Books and writings Vedder's scholarly writings have appeared in journals such as Explorations in Economic History, The Journal of Economic History, and Agricultural History. He has written over two hundred such scholarly articles. Vedder's writings have also appeared in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, Investor's Business Daily, and the Christian Science Monitor. He has published the books The American Economy in Historical Perspective, Unemployment and Government in Twentieth-Century America (with Lowell Gallaway), Can Teachers Own Their Own Schools?, Going Broke by Degree: Why College Costs Too Much, and The Wal-Mart Revolution: How Big-Box Stores Benefit Consumers, Workers, and the Economy (with Wendell Cox).

It was Boyd's second feature film following his little-noticed 1975 Intimate Reflections. Like William Somerset Maugham's 1927 play The Letter and two subsequent film adaptations, its narrative content depended on the 1911 Ethel Proudlock murder in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which became a cause c√©l√®bre scandalising British colonial society and which had been featured in a Sunday Observer article as recently as the year before. Boyd, drawing in part on his own experience of growing up in an increasingly dysfunctional family in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion, wanted to tell a story about the decline of the Empire and the surrender of responsibility. In the event his project was for the most part ridiculed but the film did draw warm support from the film director Bryan Forbes. Plot The film is set in South East Asia in 1948, in an unnamed British colony. The governor is assassinated, but the colonists continue to ignore the natives' discontent with British occupation. Plantation owner Robert Proudfoot exploits his native workers, while his spoiled wife Eve (Judi Bowker) becomes progressively distant from her husband. Eventually Eve has an affair with Embassy secretary Nash (John Hurt), but soon discovers that Nash already has a mistress: a native woman. In a fit of rage, Eve murders Nash. Robert comes to Eve's rescue, and tries to get her a lighter sentencing for the murder. Cast * John Hurt ... Nash * Jeremy Kemp ... Harry Rawlins * Judi Bowker ...

Commissioner * Upali Attanayake * J. B. L. Gunasekera Production The film is treated at length in Alexander Walker's book National Heroes: British Cinema in the 70's and 80's. The script was written by Richard Boyle, with input from fellow journalist, James Atherton. Filming took place during a four-week period in April and May of 1976, on location in Sri Lanka, with a budget of just ¬£100,000. Post production was undertaken in London and the film's score was composed by Peter Skellern. Reception The film was selected for the 1976 London Film Festival. The programme notes pointed out: It took a year for Boyd to find a distributor and then secure a release, as it was an independent production - without any studio backing. Its first general screening was in January 1978, at the brand-new four-screen Classic 1-2-3-4 on Oxford Street in London. The film received an extraordinarily hostile UK press and there were suggestions that Boyd had 'ripped-off' William Wyler's classic film noir The Letter. Boyd responded, not implausibly, that he simply hadn't seen Wyler's film but he certainly knew of the Proudlock affair. Philip French, writing in The Times, commented: while Time Out characterised it as a \\"depressingly redundant sample of British independent cinema\\". Alexander Walker's view was more nuanced. He praises the film's often glorious mise en sc√®ne on a limited budget and especially valorises Jeremy Kemp's performance but agrees the story was ineptly handled. Bryan Forbes came to the film's defence in a letter to The Times later joking that his letter had cost him good reviews for his own films ever since.

He is mainly known for a chemical reaction that bears his name, the Baudisch reaction. Early life and education Baudisch was born to Joseph and Julie Baudisch in Maffersdorf, Austria, which is today Vratislavice nad Nisou, now part of the Czech Republic. He received his first education in chemistry at the Staatsgewerbeschule in Reichenberg. Since this kind of school was not sufficient to be allowed to start a Ph. D. thesis in Austria, he went abroad. Baudisch studied chemistry in Zurich, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1904. Career =In Europe= After a year of military service in the Austro-Hungarian Army, he worked for his former chemistry teacher, Ferdinand Breinl, in Reichenberg. There he published a paper on the oxidation of proteins by hydrogen peroxide. He then joined the group of Eugen Bamberger at the University of Zurich as a private assistant. In 1907 he joined the University of Manchester where he worked with William Henry Perkin, Jr.. During this time he published his work on Cupferron, a complexation agent later used for the quantitative analysis of copper and iron. Baudisch left London in 1909 and worked in the dyestuff industry for some time. In 1911, he worked with Alfred Werner in Zurich, and obtained his habilitation. Just before the outbreak of World War I, he became director of the Strahlenforschungsinstitut (radiation research institute) in Hamburg. During the war, Baudisch served in the Austria-Hungary army in the fields of medicine and epidemic control. After the war he joined the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. =In America= In 1920, he assumed a professorship of photochemistry at Yale University. Two years later, he moved to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research where he concentrated his research on trace minerals in soil and water. In 1933, he was asked to head the New York State Institute of Balneology and Hydrotherapy at Saratoga Springs, New York. During his time at this institute he also worked on the impact of trace minerals in water on health. During this time he published on iron-pyridine complexes. In 1939 Baudisch discovered the copper-catalyzed reaction of phenols and hydroxylamine hydrochloride to give o-nitrosophenols. This reaction is today known as the Baudisch reaction. Death Baudisch drowned on 28 March 1950 near La Jolla, California in a boating accident. He had been working on a research project on trace elements in the sea for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla.

However, in 1984 she was discredited by a booklet which accused her of alleged racist theories. Following these events Onkruid magazine ended its relation with her. She then moved to Kalmthout in Belgium, where eleven years before she had established the Oasis Mellie Uyldert Foundation, which was a center directed for natural therapeutic treatments. At a country house belonging to her foundation, Uyldert continued to write books, teaching courses, organizing workshops and giving lectures up to age 96. She lived her last years in the \\"Leendert Meeshuis\\", an anthroposophical nursing home in Bilthoven until reaching 100. Literary work By 2008 Uyldert registered about 30 books with a total circulation around one million, with translations in German, English, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and Danish. Uyldert reveals that the major interest over her work came when the World War began, turning people‚Äôs attention to spiritual issues, but in fact it dates from the nineteen sixties, helped by her involvement with environmental writings, and because it was a period of a belief in a new, peaceful, romantic world accompanied by numerous protests against the emergent and global mechanized world and belief in a New Age. She early discovered esoteric astrology, claiming it as a base of all sciences and regularly citing the East as source of ancient wisdom. According to her, people have only a short free will, and most of time the celestial bodies rule their destinies. Uyldert commonly focuses on some aspects of physical and spiritual diseases, regarding them as consequences of neglect of ancient knowledge and of the estrangement between man and nature. For instance she asserts that Chinese have had rules by 6000 years for which place a house should be built because the soil must provide good energy. As for herself, she claims to remember things from her past lives and have psychic abilities since childhood, although she states \\"The important thing is the understanding coming from within - clairvoyance is just a trick\\". However she claims esoteric knowledge for her writings about herbal medicine and nutrition where she argues the influence of nature spirits over the plants.Mellie Uylder, The psychic garden (Plantenzielen, 1974). .

She delivers her own interpretations of folkloric tales, human behavior, and many subjects, merging all with her astrologic knowledge.

The first regular school in the State was opened in the year 1860, and about ten years later it was decided by the Durbar that the people might be induced to have their children instructed even in primary knowledge if they were to publish an order that appointments to positions in the State departments would not thereafter be given to any individuals who had not obtained a certificate from a recognised college of school. A Regulation to that effect was actually issued, and progress was noted almost immediately afterwards. The principal educational institution at the present time is the Sulaimania High School, affiliated to the University of Allahabad, in which instructions is given in the Persian, Urdu, and Hindi languages, and in the text of the Koran. The students are more than 800 in number. The Alexandra High School has a daily attendance roll of about 185 youths, and the good work performed by the teachers is apparent from the satisfactory percentage of pupils who have been successful in matriculation examinations. The institution in which English was first taught in Bhopal is the Jahangiria School, in which there are about 320 pupils. There are also the ‚ÄúMadrassa Ahmadia‚Äù, specially reserved for instruction in religious subjects; the Victoria Girls‚Äô School, erected in 1891 and the Sultania School, for daughters of parents in good positions, which has a large number of pupils on the rolls.

Their eclectic sound, built over a decade of recording, incorporates many different styles, diverse as progressive rock, post-rock, experimental, pop, classical, jazz and ambient soundscapes. Founded by Steve Messina and Nik Chinboukas in 2001, the group has evolved into more of a collective than a band, as some of their members have changed over the years.  History  Their debut, self-titled CD, is a concept album about death and the afterlife. The CD was recorded in a beach house in West Hampton, New York, over the course of three weeks in March 2001, and was released the following year. Originally the recording was intended to be just a \\"musical vacation\\" amongst friends who had performed and recorded together in various groups and projects throughout the years. But after hearing the results, and enjoying the collaboration, they decided to release it, with Blow Up Hollywood as their moniker. Their sophomore CD, Fake, was released in 2004, and garnished critical acclaim. In September 2004, John Diliberto, the host of the radio show Echoes, ran a feature on the band and had them perform live on air, bringing them national attention. That same year their live version of the song \\"beyond the stars\\" was included on the Echo's compilation CD, alongside artists Yo-Yo Ma, Kai King, and Will Ackerman. Stars End - A one track ambient improvisation, was recorded live on November 14, 2004, at WXPN in Philadelphia. The CD is titled after Chuck Van Zyl's show Star's End which has aired every Saturday night since 1976. \\"We asked Chuck what we should play, and he gave us . So we improvised for an hour\\", one of the band members has stated. In 2006 the band released what would become their most popular CD, both nationally and internationally. With the debate over the war in Iraq raging, the band released another concept album, The Diaries of Private Henry Hill. Based on the journal entries of a young, deceased soldier from the Iraq war, Blow Up Hollywood takes us on Private Henry Hill's surreal journey as he joins the army out of necessity rather than patriotism. That same year the album was released, Amy Goodman, the host of the news show Democracy Now! (a daily TV/radio news program, airing on over 900 stations, pioneering the largest community media collaboration in the United States) championed the band and the video for the song WMD playing it repeatedly on her show for weeks. Rachael Maddow, the then host of The Rachael Maddow show on Air America Radio, also invited the band to perform live and discuss the CD. And many other songs from the Diaries record were featured on NPR's program All Things Considered. In 2008, the band was invited by Tomas Young (an injured American soldier from the Iraq war ) and Eddie Vedder (the lead vocalist of the American rock band Pearl Jam) to have WMD included on the compilation soundtrack to the documentary film Body of War, alongside Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Tori Amos, Tom Waits, Roger Waters (founding member of Pink Floyd), and Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam. Body of War, directed by Ellen Spiro and Phil Donahue, is a 2007 documentary following Tomas Young, an Iraq War veteran paralyzed from a bullet to the spine, on a physical and emotional journey as he adapts to his new body and begins to question the decision to go to war in Iraq. As Tomas's journey unfolds, the film cuts back and forth to Congressional proceedings in Washington, D.C.

Description Danmark is in overall length with a beam of and a depth of , with a gross tonnage of 790 tons. She was designed for a crew complement of 120 but in a 1959 refit this was reduced to 80. Although she is equipped with a 486-hp diesel engine capable of in other respects she retains many primitive features: for example, the steering gear lacks any mechanical assistance, and the stock anchors are raised by a capstan rather than a powered windlass. The permanent crew has berths, but the trainees sleep in hammocks. History Danmark succeeded K√∏benhavn, a five- masted barque which was lost mysteriously at sea at the end of 1928, as Denmark's principal training ship. Launched in 1932 at the Nakskov Shipyard in Lolland and fitted out the following year, she was built to train officers of the Danish merchant marine. In 1939 she visited the United States to participate in the 1939 Worlds Fair in New York City, but at the outbreak of hostilities in World War II she was ordered to remain in US waters to avoid capture by the Germans. She was then based in Jacksonville, Florida and maintained with the help of the Danish American community there. After the attack on Pearl Harbor the captain, Knud L. Hansen, offered the ship to the U.S. government as a training vessel. This offer was accepted, and Danmark moved to New London, Connecticut to train cadets at the United States Coast Guard Academy there. Approximately five thousand cadets were trained before the ship was returned to Denmark in 1945. Her designation in the U.S. Coast Guard was USCGC Danmark (WIX-283). She resumed her training duties the following year. In recognition of her wartime service, a bronze plaque was placed on the mainmast, and Danmark was given the honor of leading the parade of ships at the 1964 Worlds Fair in New York. Experience with Danmark led to the acquisition of the USCGC Eagle from Germany at the end of the war as a training vessel. Training voyages continue to be offered, not only to Danes but also to those of any nation interested in learning the basics of seamanship on a large sailing vessel.

To the north of the range runs the valley of the Dad√®s, separating it from the massive High Atlas Range. Sa…£ru in the Tamazight language means drought, an apt name considering that the Jbel Saghro is the driest mountain area of the whole Atlas Mountain System.

Its history spans more than 350 years, and it has survived both the French Revolution of 1789‚Äì99 and the Russian Bolshevik (Communist) revolution of 1917. It was owned by European kings and queens. Origin of name \\"La Pelegrina\\" is a Spanish word. Some gem historians translated it as \\"the Incomparable\\", but actually \\"La Pelegrina\\" has no such meaning in Spanish. Other gem historians believe that the name \\"La Pelegrina\\" was made to show a connection between \\"La Pelegrina\\" and another famous pearl La Peregrina. \\"La Peregrina\\" means \\"the Pilgrim\\" or \\"the Wanderer\\", and rhyming the names \\"La Pelegrina\\" and \\"La Peregrina\\" could mean that the name \\"La Pelegrina\\" was meant to be also \\"the Pilgrim\\" or \\"the Wanderer\\", and a single letter was changed to distinguish between the two different pearls. Physical characteristics The original weight of this pear-shaped pearl was 133.16 grains. \\"The pearl undoubtedly has all the desirable characteristics under GIA's seven pearl value factors :- size, shape, color, luster, surface quality, nacre quality, and matching.\\" History The pearl was found by an African slave on the coast of the isle of Santa Margarita in the Gulf of Panama in the mid-16th century. The slave who found it was rewarded with freedom. The historian and writer, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, from the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru, made the pearl famous. In his Royal Commentaries of Peru he wrote: The pearl made its first appearance in Spain in 1660, when Philip IV of Spain presented his daughter Maria Theresa with it. The occasion for the expensive present was the marriage of Maria Theresa to Louis XIV of France. Before the king gave it to his daughter he wore the pearl himself. An eyewitness noted: La Pelegrina traveled to France with its new owner. After the death of Maria Theresa in 1683 La Pelegrina's history went blank until it reappeared in Saint Petersburg in 1826. Although it is not known what happened to the pearl after Maria Theresa's death, there is good reason to believe she left it to her only son, and that the pearl entered the French Crown Jewels. Its last royal owner could have been Louis XVI of France, who was executed during French Revolution. The Crown Jewels were stolen in 1792 when the Garde Meuble (Royal Treasury) was stormed by rioters. It is possible that La Pelegrina was stolen together with the Sancy Diamond and French Blue Diamond, and was thereafter sold to the Russian nobles of the House of Yusupov. Zinaida Yusupova had her portraits painted while she was wearing the famous pearl. The pearl passed to her son, Felix Yusupov, best known for participating in the murder of Grigori Rasputin. During the October Revolution of 1917 many jewels from the Yusupov collection were taken by the Bolsheviks, but La Pelegrina had a different fate. Felix was able to smuggle the pearl, together with a few other jewels, out of Russia. During the following years Felix sold some of his jewels, but he could not bring himself to sell La Pelegrina, one of his favorite treasures, until 1953, when he sold it to a Geneva-based jeweler.

He had staged a military coup against the preceding and the last Eastern Ganga dynasty ruler Bhanu Deva IV and overtook the throne as the king was weak and had lost territories to the south. His name is also written as Kapilendra Routray or Sri Sri Kapilendra Deva. In claiming descent from the Surya Vamsha (Sun dynasty) of the Mahabharata, he also took the title shri shri ...(108 times) Gajapati Gaudeshwara NabaKoti Karnata Kalabargeswara. This title literally meant the lord of Bengal (Gauda), of Karnataka region or Vijayanagara kingdom, of Golkonda kingdom and of nine crore subjects. The title is still used by the sun dynasty kings of Puri on ritual occasions.  The Initial Life of Kapilendra Deva  There are separate theories or concepts about Kapilendra Deva's initial life. In Madala Panji records of Puri temple it states that he was known as Kapila Routa and was born in a poor family whose job was to take care of domesticated cows. Due to a divine symbol of cobra (naga) seated by his head covering him from the sunlight while he was resting, he was predicted to become a king one day. Another note from the same records state that he used to be a robber by profession and appointed his friend from his gang called Kali Dasa as the head priest of his court once he became a king. In the third statement from the same records it states that he used to beg in front of the Puri Jagannath temple as a child and was later adopted by the last Eastern Ganga dynasty ruler Bhanudeva following a divine dream. He was later appointed in his young days as a military general of the Ganga forces and was assigned the task to fight the Muslim forces of Bengal.  Consolidation of Authority by Suppressing Internal Rebellions Lingaraj Temple Inscription of Kapilendra Deva issuing warning to the vassal kings for complete loyalty to him or else loose their property and be banished from the kingdom Due to the weakening administration of the Eastern Ganga dynasty rulers, Kapilendra Deva mounted the throne with internal support while the last ruler of the dynasty, Bhanu Deva IV was on a military expedition in the southern territories. He was declared as the new king with a rajyabhishek ceremony at Bhubaneswar. Since the accession was based on a coup or rebellion, some feudal kings of Odisha like Matsarvamshi of Oddadi, Shilavamshis of Nandapur, Bishnukundina of Panchadhara, etc. declined his authority and declared themselves independent. Around the same time, the Sultanate of Jaunpur also posed as an external threat to his kingdom. He appointed his able minister Gopinath Mahapatra to deal with the Jaunpur threat which was successfully executed by him and Kapilendra Deva himself suppressed the internal rebels with force. The rebels were suppressed by the year 1440 A.D. The rebellious troubles dealt by him with force are proven by his Lingaraj Temple declaration in which he has ordered the rebels to accept his rule or be toppled from power. = The Odia Military under Kapilendra Deva = Gajapati Kapilendra Deva Routray depicted holding a sword and seated in a dominating Lakulisha position at Kapileswar Temple in Old Bhubaneswar Different historical sources give varied accounts about the Odishan military commanded by the Gajapatis. According to Muslim text Buhan-m-Mansir, Kapilendra had an elephant force numbering two hundred thousand (2,00,000). This number of war elephants is usually a very huge number compared even to any military of the existing kingdoms during the times of Kapilendra Deva himself in India. Nizzamuddin writes that the Gajapati encamped on the Godavari river banks with an infantry of seven hundred thousand (700,000). Another Muslim source documents that Kapilendra Deva raided Bidar with only 10,000 foot soldiers while being assisted by the Vellamati chiefs of Telangana. The Odia poet Sarala Das who lived during the era of Kapilendra Deva, has given descriptions about the military divisions in his Odia Mahabharata. The divisions mentioned are:- * Hantakaru Dala :- This division was in the forefront of the marching army and was responsible forward scouting, clearing jungles and marking roads for the army. * Aguani Thata :- The division that marched ahead of the main army. * Pradhana Vala :- The main division of the army * Pachhiani Thata :- The rear guard division * Anga Vala :- The specially deployed bodyguards of the military generals and the royalties. * Oridandas :-The contingent of the army that stayed in charge of conquered forts and the adjoining regions. Sarala Das also gives a picture of different musical instruments used to motivate soldiers during the march and warfare Some names of the weapons used by the Gajapati army are also mentioned like Dhanu, Troua, Sara, Asi, Parigha, Pattisa, Kunta, Jathi, Buruja, Saveli, etc. Information with regard to breaking of the gateways and the walls of the fort with the help of horses, elephants and iron instruments is also found in the same text.  Military Conquests and Territorial Expansion  Kurumbera fort compound built during the rule of Kapilendra Deva Routray and which is today within the territorial limits of West Bengal state. The military hegemony of Odisha had declined during the last line of Eastern Ganga dynasty rulers which provided enough opportunity for the rising powers in its neighborhood. When Kapilendra Deva took over the throne, hostile Muslim powers like the Sultan of Jaunpur (Mahmud Shah), Bahmani Sultanate and the young ruler of Bengal Samsuddin Ahmad Shah were continuously preparing to invade Odisha. Deva Raya II of Vijayanagara along with Reddys of Rajmahendri had advanced as far as the Simhanchalam territory in the south. Along with suppressing internal rebellions, Kapilendra Deva first defeated the Jaunpur forces with the help of his minister Gopinath Mahapatra and contained Bengal forces with the help of his minister Joginath Mahapatra after which only he initiated his aggressive military campaigns of the Southern and Deccan parts of India. = Conquest of Rajamahendri = * First Campaign in 1444 A.D. - The first campaign against the alliance of Vijayanagar kingdom and Rajamahendri Reddys was unsuccessful as Odia forces had to face a two front war with both the Jaunpur Muslim forces in the north and the Vijayanagar forces under the able leadership of the Devaraya II's able commander Mallapa. Kapilendra Deva first diverted his attention in dealing with the invasion in the northern frontiers and hence the campaign in the south was abandoned. *Second Campaign in 1446 A.D. and Capture of Kondavidu by Hamvira Deva - The Odia forces returned in the year 1446 A.D. led by Hamvira Deva or Hamvira Kumara Mahapatra, the eldest son of Kapilendra Deva. The political alliance between Vijayanagar and the Reddy kingdom had ceased to exist as Deva Raya II had died and the power passed on to a weaker successor, Malikarjuna Raya. The Reddy kingdom was conquered and the Odia forces occupied Kondavidu by the year 1454 A.D. A vassal king by the name Ganadeva was made the feudal ruler of the region. Hamvira Deva was declared as the governor of the southern territories by Kapilendra Deva after this conquest. = Conquest of Gauda region in Bengal = An inscription in the Jagannath temple of Puri that is dated to the year 1450 A.D narrates the conquest of Gauda by Kapilendra Deva after defeating Malika Parisa (Malik Padsah) which in short refers to the contemporary sultan of Bengal by the name Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah. After this victory, Kapilendra Deva accepts the title epithet of 'Gaudeswara' which meant the lord of Gauda kingdom. = Subjugation of Vijayanagar Kingdom and Expansion till Tiruchirappalli = Udayagiri fort situated in Nellore district was first built by conquering forces of Kapilendra Deva as the military headquarters of his Odishan empire's southern parts. From the documents of Gangadasa Bilasa Charitam it is known that Kapilendra Deva ordered Hamvira Deva to conquer Vijayanagar and Bahmani sultanate. Hamvira Deva successfully captured the Vijaynagar capital, Hampi and forced the weak ruler Malikarjuna Raya to pay yearly taxes. Hamvira Deva's commander Tamavupala conquered the southern states of Udayagiri (Nellore district) and Chandragiri in the year 1460 A.D.. The inscriptions of Srirangam temple near Trichinapalli dictate that Hamvira Deva captured as far as Trichinapalli, Tanjore and Arcot in south before stopping his advance. Hamvira Deva assumed the title of Dakshina Kapileswara in the year 1464. Odishan Empire of Gajapati Kapilendra Deva (1434 A.D - 1466 A.D) = Conquest of Telegana (Gulberga or Kalaberga) = The political situation of Telegana provided an opportunity for the Gajapati army to intervene and capture the territory. The Velama chiefs of Devara Konda in Telegana and the Bahmani sultan Aladdin Ahmad Shah II had cordial relations in the initial stages but on the event of war between Vijayanagar and Bahmani Sultanate, the Velama chiefs backed Bahmani sultante and sought to fight Vijaynagar. In an act of revenge the Bahmani sultan invaded the Telegana region and the Bahmani commander Sanjar Khan exerted barbaric atrocities on the common people. Hindus were sold as slaves. In 1456 A.D. Humayun Shah ascended the throne of the Bahmani sultanate and his general Sikander Khan suppressed the rebel Velama chiefs after occupying Devarakonda. Kapilendra Deva was invited by the Velama chiefs to rescue the Telegana population from the Bahmani rulers. In 1458 A.D. a battle ensued at Devara Konda between Odia forces led by Hamvira Deva and Bahmani forces. As a result of this battle Odia forces came out as victorious and Telegana region became a feudal state of the Gajapati empire with the Velama chiefs as the vassal rulers. = Campaigns against Bahmani Sultanate and March on Bidar = * First Campaign - After the death of Humayun Shah in 1462 A.D., his underage son Nizam Shah was crowned as the ruler of the Bahmani sultanate. With the help of Zamindars of Telegana and the Velama chiefs the Odia forces marched towards Bidar, the then capital of the Bahmanis. Widespread loot and rampage of Bahmani country side ensued during this march. However, due to the invasion by Muslim Sharqui ruler of Jaunpur on the northern borders of Odisha with 3,00,000 cavalry and 1400 war elephants forced Kapilendra Deva to abandon the campaign and move against the invading enemy. *Second Campaign - During his second expedition on Bidar, the Bahmani sultanate faced another simultaneous invasion from the Malwa kingdom due to which the Odia forces easily captured the capital Bidar and carried out widespread loot and destruction of the kingdom. Later Malwa and its capital Dhara was also invaded successfully by the Odia forces.  Constructive Activities and Cultural Renaissance of the Odia Society  left Meghanada wall resistant to even the sounds from outside and fortifying Jagannath temple was constructed during Kapilendra Deva Kapileswar Temple at old Bhubaneswar built during Kapilendra Deva Kapilendra Deva patronized vaishnavism and expanded the Jagannath temple at Puri. Although his entire life was spent in warfare, the Jagannath temple became the center for an efflorescence of drama and dance (Odissi) and other forms of art during Gajapati rule. He was a great patron of Vedic culture and himself wrote a Sanskrit play called Parshuram Bijaya. He constructed the Shaivite temple of Kapileswar in Bhubaneswar which shows that he was tolerant to every sectarian belief under the Hindu domain. It was during the rule of Kapilendra Deva when Odia language was officially used as an administrative language and the poet Sarala Das wrote the Odia Mahabharata. Several learned poets and writers were promoted by him. Sanskrit poets also flourished during this era like Visvanatha Kaviraja who wrote Sahitya Darpana and Chandrakala Natika along with other works, Narsingha Mishra Vajapeyi wrote Samksepasariraka vartika and Kalidasa Chayani wrote Suddhichandrika. Kapilendra Deva had declared himself as the servant ruler of lord Jagannath which also reflects from his title Routaray meaning the lord's servant king. Narendra tank at the Puri Jagannath temple premises was constructed by Kapilendra Deva in the memory of his martyred younger brother, Veer Narendra Deva. Fourteen out of sixteen ghats of the tank are named after his fourteen nephews. The two concentric defensive stone walls known as Kurma Prachira (the inner wall measuring 400‚Äô x 278‚Äô) and Meghanada Prachira (the outer wall measuring 665‚Äô x 644‚Äô with height varying from 20‚Äô to 24‚Äô) were constructed during the rule of Kapilendra Deva. The Chandan Jatra festival of Lord Jagannath was initiated during his rule. He himself donated a large amount of jewelry and utensils to the Puri temple during the 41 anka of his rule. The Gajapati was man of charity who had solely pledged to donate equal amount of wealth and rights to the Brahmins. He ordered the banishing of Chaukidari tax paid by the Brahmins previously and also banned the resumption of waste and pasture lands. He had ordered his officials to follow the path of justice, righteousness and spiritual teachings and had issued warning to them to face the punishment of exile if they failed to do so. During his rule, two Dadhivamana temples were constructed, one each in the village of Kaunrpur and Gopinathpur in Cuttack district. Kapilendra Deva was a builder of a welfare state and had ordered not to commit atrocities or impose excessive hardships on the people of his kingdom.  Last days of Kapilendra Deva  Kapilendra deva was troubled by treacherous internal subjects who were opposed to his overthrowing of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. His edicts in the Puri Jagannath temple towards his end days provide a glimpse of his troubled state of mind due to rebels and traitors. He had taken oath to punish all those who rebelled against him. Before his death in 1466 A.D., he chose his youngest son Purushottama Deva, as heir, resulting in a rebellion by Hamvira Deva. In 1472, Purushottam was defeated and Hamvira Deva became king, but in 1476 A.D., Purushottam fought back and recaptured the throne.

It is 4.2 km long by 1 km wide, and lies 15 km from the nearest point of the Mexican coast and about 28 km west of the resort town of San Carlos on the coast of the Sonoran Desert. The island is protected as a nature reserve and its coastal waters are well known as a sport fishing and diving site. Flora and fauna The island is home to an endemic cactus Echinocereus websterianus. Endemic fauna include the San Pedro Nolasco Island spinytail iguana (Ctenosaura nolascensis) and, formerly, Pemberton's deer mouse (Peromyscus pembertoni ), a rodent which is now extinct.

Pacific Linguistics 599. is a species of mangrove in the mahogany family (Meliaceae). It is found in Africa, Asia, Australasia and the Pacific Islands. It is a common species of mangrove, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description Xylocarpus granatum is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, growing to a maximum height of . The trunk has buttresses and above-ground roots which extend for long distances to either side. The bark is brown and smooth, and comes away in flakes. The leaves are pinnate and arranged spirally on the twigs; they have two to four pairs of leaflets and are pale green when young and darken with age. The inflorescence grows in a short panicle in the axil of a leaf or at the end of the shoot. The individual flowers are wide, with parts in fours, and are white or pinkish-yellow. They are followed by large, spherical, woody capsules, in diameter, which split open to reveal up to a dozen seeds. Distribution and habitat This species is native to the tropical and sub-tropical western Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique (in which it is one of ten mangrove species) to India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, northern Australia and Papua New Guinea; it grows in the higher intertidal zone and is found in estuaries and lining the banks of creeks. Uses The wood is hard and durable and can be used for boat-building, construction and making furniture, however the trees are twisted and often hollow so large pieces of timber may not be available; the wood is also used for tool handles and other small items, and can be used as firewood but burns rather quickly. The bark is rich in tannins and has been used for strengthening rope and dying cloth. The bark, fruits and seeds have been used in traditional medicine. Status Mangroves in general are under threat from coastal development and from harvesting, and another threat is global warming and the consequent rise in sea levels. Xylocarpus granatum is a common species of mangrove with a very wide range, and it is probably not declining at a sufficient fast rate to be included in any threatened category. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as being of \\"least concern\\".

Among the many hard candy varieties are stick candy such as the candy cane, lollipops, aniseed twists, and b√™tises de Cambrai. Most hard candy is nearly 100% sugar by weight, with a tiny amount of other ingredients for color or flavor, and negligible water content in the final product. Recipes for hard candy may use syrups of sucrose, glucose, fructose or other sugars. Sugar-free versions have also been created. Once the syrup blend reaches the target temperature, the candy maker removes it from the heat source and may add citric acid, food dye, and some flavouring, such as a plant extract, essential oil, or flavourant. The syrup concoction, which is now very thick, can be poured into a mold or tray to cool, or a cooling table in case of industrial mass production. When the syrup is cool enough to handle, it can be folded, rolled, or molded into the shapes desired. After the boiled syrup cools, it is called hard candy, since it becomes stiff and brittle as it approaches room temperature. Chemistry Chemically, sugar candies are broadly divided into two groups: crystalline candies and amorphous candies. Crystalline candies are not as hard as crystals of the mineral variety, but derive their name and their texture from their microscopically organized sugar structure, formed through a process of crystallization, which makes them easy to bite or cut into. Amorphous candies have a disorganized crystalline structure. Hard candies are non-crystalline, amorphous candies containing about 98% (or more) solid sugar.  Medicinal use  king of Denmark to take the medicine he had been prescribed, despite not liking the flavour. Hard candies are historically associated with cough drops. The extended flavor release of lozenge-type candy, which mirrors the properties of modern cough drops, had long been appreciated. Many apothecaries used sugar candy to make their prescriptions more palatable to their customers. They are also carried by people with hypoglycemia to quickly raise their low blood sugar level which, when untreated, can sometimes lead to fainting and other physical complications, and are used as part of diabetic management.  Sugar-free  Hard candies and throat lozenges prepared without sugar employ isomalt as a sugar substitute, and are sweetened further by the addition of an artificial sweetener, such as aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, or a sugar alcohol, such as xylitol.

Biography Gerngross was from a Baltic German noble family of Dutch origin. He entered military service in 1868, and graduated from the Riga School of Infantry. Commissioned as an ensign in 1871, he served with the 63rd Infantry Regiment. He was promoted to second lieutenant in 1873 and to lieutenant in 1875. Serving with distinction during the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) he received a field commission as brevet captain, which was formally confirmed in 1879. He rose to lieutenant colonel in 1887. He served in Russian Turkestan from 1891‚Äì1897, during which time he was responsible for land surveys for the Trans-Caspian Railway. He was promoted to colonel in 1894, and became commander of the Transcaspian Infantry Battalion to August 1897. Gergross then commanded the border guards units of the Russian Ministry of Finance through 1901. In 1900, he was stationed in Harbin, and played an important role in the defense of Harbin during the Russian suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900‚Äì1901. He was awarded the Order of St. George (4th class) for heroism during this campaign. From 1902, Gerngross was commander of the 1st Siberian Infantry Brigade, which was subsequently active in combat during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 131. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1904. During the Battle of Te-li-Ssu, his division came under a strong artillery attack from the Imperial Japanese Army, and suffered heavy losses. Although the promised reinforcements never arrived, he personally led two regiments in a successful counterattack on Japanese positions. He was wounded in the battle, and was subsequently awarded the Gold Sword for Bravery. He was also at the Battle of Liaoyang. At the Battle of Shaho, Gerngross commanded the reserve forces, which he used to recapture positions from the Japanese south of the Sha River before being ordered to withdraw. During the Battle of Sandepu, Gerngross led a detachment consisting of the 2nd, 3rd, 35th and 36th Infantry Regiments in a successful night attack, which split the Japanese 3rd Division and succeeded in securing a foothold within the fortified village of Sandepu. However, his action was part of the unauthorized offensive and he was again obliged to withdraw, sustaining heavy losses. For this action, he was relieved of his command by General Georgii Stackelberg. During the Battle of Mukden, Gerngross (who had just been reinstated as commander) and General Konstantin Tserpitsky, despite a lack of reinforcements, led a counterattack, which temporarily halted the advance of the Japanese Third Army. After the end of the War, Gerngross was made commander of the 1st Siberian Army Corps. He held this position from 23 May 1905 to 7 June 1910. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of infantry general, and commander of the 24th Army Corps until 20 January 1913.

The party describes itself as progressive and social-democratic and was admitted into the Socialist International in December 2014. The party currently holds 14 out of 167 seats in the Venezuelan National Assembly, the country's parliament, and is a member of the Democratic Unity Roundtable, the electoral coalition that currently holds a plurality in the National Assembly. The party was formed in reaction to alleged infringements of individual freedom and human rights on the part of the government of the Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez and his successor, Nicol√°s Maduro. The party attempts to bring together Venezuelans of various backgrounds who consider Chavismo oppressive and authoritarian. Popular Will self-identifies itself as \\"a pluralist and democratic movement\\" that is committed to \\"progress,\\" which it defines as the realization of \\"the social, economic, political, and human rights of every Venezuelan.\\" The party says its \\"fundamental pillars\\" are progress, democracy, and social action.  History  = Background and foundation = Leopoldo L√≥pez in 2012 Popular Will traces its roots to the Popular Networks (Redes Populares) formed in 2004 as a means of promoting social action and leadership. The year 2007 saw the formation of the so-called \\"2D\\" opposition movement, which considered the constitutional referendum called by Hugo Ch√°vez an attempt to impose dictatorship on the country. This was followed in 2009 by the formation of the Social Action (Accion Social) movement, which brought together \\"youths, workers, community leaders, business people, and politicians.\\" On December 5, 2009, L√≥pez, along with the other leaders of other political parties, Un Nuevo Tiempo, Primero Justicia, and Acci√≥n Democr√°tica,Manifiesto de Voluntad Popular (Spanish, visited September 21, 2010)Dirigentes opositores lanzan movimiento Voluntad Popular en Carabobo (Spanish, visited December 05, 2009) officially announced the formation of the Popular Will Movement (Movimiento Voluntad Popular) at a forum in Valencia, Carabobo. The National Electoral Council, on February 1, 2010, refused to allow the group to call itself Movimiento Voluntad Popular, supposedly because of the similarity between this name and that of the Movimiento Base Popular, a regional political party in Apure. This frustrated the party's desire to field candidates in the 2010 parliamentary election; nonetheless, three party members won election to the National Assembly, two of them with the support of the Coalition for Mesa de la Unidad Democr√°tica (MUD).Negado en el CNE conformaci√≥n del Movimiento Voluntad Popular dirigido por Leopoldo L√≥pez (Spanish, visited February 11, 2010) On January 14, 2011, the National Electoral Council of Venezuela (Consejo Nacional Electoral) formally accepted Popular Will as a legitimate political party. This was followed by an unprecedented event in Venezuelan political history, namely the choice of a party's officials in open elections, which were held on July 10, 2011. Later, MUD candidates for the presidency and state government offices were selected in primaries that took place on February 12, 2012. Leopoldo L√≥pez had retired himself and supported Henrique Capriles Radonski who was elected as the MUD candidate for presidential election of October 7, 2012. Hugo Ch√°vez was reelected as president and the party received 471,677 votes. In the regional elections on December 16, 2012, the party was established as the fourth largest party in MUD coalition and as the sixth nationwide. The youth leader, David Smolansky, won the 2013 municipal election for mayor of the municipality of El Hatillo in Miranda State.Leopoldo L√≥pez anunci√≥ que Voluntad Popular es ahora un partido pol√≠tico (Spanish, visited January 18, 2011) = Protest movement = Protestors in Caracas on 12 February 2014 The Popular Will Party played a central role in the protests that took place in Venezuela in early 2014. L√≥pez was blamed by the government of president Nicolas Maduro for three deaths that occurred during protests on February 12, and the next day a Caracas court upheld a request from the Public Prosecutor's Office to order his arrest. \\"Without a doubt, the violence was created by small groups coordinated, exalted and financed by Leopoldo L√≥pez,\\" said Jorge Rodriguez, the Socialist Party mayor of the Libertador municipality in Caracas. \\"The government is playing the violence card, and not for the first time,\\" L√≥pez claimed. \\"They're blaming me without any proof....I have a clear conscience because we called for peace.\\" He added: \\"We won't retreat and we can't retreat because this is about our future, about our children, about millions of people.\\" On February 16, L√≥pez announced he would turn himself in to the Venezuelan government after one more protest. \\"I haven't committed any crime,\\" he said. \\"If there is a decision to legally throw me in jail I'll submit myself to this persecution.\\" In early March 2014, a peaceful protest march in Caracas, organized by the Student Movement (Movimiento Estudiantil) and supported by Popular Will, was dispersed by members of the National Guard (GNB) and National Police (PNB) using tear gas and gunshots. This action prevented the marchers from reaching the headquarters of the national Ombudsman, where they planned to demand the resignation of Gabriela Ramirez for justifying acts of torture and other violations of human rights committed by the government of Nicol√°s Maduro. At this point L√≥pez had been in prison for 22 days. Popular Will, in response to this action, stated that Maduro, \\"in addition to being illegitimate, is a murderer.\\" Party official Freddy Guevara emphasized that Popular Will believed in a peaceful and constitutional transfer of power, and called on the Venezuelan people to maintain pressure on the government to provide justice and freedom, saying that \\"the power of the street\\" must be used \\"to force the government to uphold the constitution.\\" He added. \\"We cannot rest until Leopoldo L√≥pez is free.\\" = Arrests = Since the party became more involved in Venezuela's protest movement, numerous members of Popular Will have been arrested. In March 2018, The New York Times reported that over 90 members of Popular Will have been detained by the Maduro government.  Party headquarters raid  On 17 February 2014, \\"alleged members of military counterintelligence\\" broke into the headquarters of Popular Will without a search warrant and holding people at gunpoint. In videotapes of the incident that were later made public, armed men are seen threatening people in one room of the headquarters and violently breaking down a door in order to enter another room. Carlos Vecchio, the party's national political coordinator, reported the incident via Twitter. L√≥pez, in his own tweet, urged his followers to spread the word about the incident.  Arrest of L√≥pez  Patricia Guti√©rrez (Mayor of San Crist√≥bal), David Smolansky (Mayor of El Hatillo) and Lilian Tintori gathered at Ramo Verde Prison following L√≥pez's arrest On February 18, 2014, L√≥pez delivered a speech in Plaza Bri√≥n calling for \\"a pacific exit\\" from authoritarian government, \\"within the constitution but in the streets.\\" He lamented the loss of independent media in the country and declared that if his imprisonment helped Venezuelans to wake up once and for all and demand change, it would have been worth it. He said he could have left the country, but instead had \\"stayed to fight for the oppressed people in Venezuela.\\" He thereupon turned himself in to the National Guard, saying that he was handing himself over to a \\"corrupt justice\\" system. On February 20, Supervisory Judge Ralenis Tovar Guill√©n, issued a pre-trial detention order against L√≥pez in response to formal charges of \\"arson of a public building,\\" \\"damages to public property,\\" \\"instigation to commit a crime,\\" and \\"associating for organized crime.\\" Human-rights organizations around the world condemned the arrest of L√≥pez, with Amnesty International, in a February 19 statement, calling it \\"a politically motivated attempt to silence dissent\\" and Human Rights Watch accusing the Venezuelan government of adopting \\"the classic tactics of an authoritarian regime.\\" The New York-based Human Rights Foundation declared L√≥pez a prisoner of conscience on February 20 and called for his immediate release, adding: \\"Either Maduro releases L√≥pez and calls for an honest dialogue with all of the opposition, or he must step down for the sake of all Venezuelans: both those who support Chavismo and those who do not. Venezuela does not need an executioner willing to kill half of the country. Venezuela needs a president.\\" On February 26, L√≥pez's wife, Lilian Tintori, led a quiet protest of female students just prior to a government peace conference.  Arrest warrant for Vecchio  Vecchio's arrest warrant The day after L√≥pez's arrest, the government issued an arrest warrant for Carlos Vecchio, who with L√≥pez in jail was serving as the de facto leader of Popular Will. He was charged with the same offenses as L√≥pez: arson, criminal association, damages to public property, and instigation to commit a crime. Vecchio, who was in hiding, defied the arrest order. Meanwhile, public unrest continued, with the official death toll from more than two weeks of violence rising to 17. Enrique Betancourt, writing in the Yale Daily News, described Vecchio, a 2013 Yale World Fellow, as a champion of freedom who, unlike L√≥pez, \\"is not an internationally recognizable figure (yet).\\" Betancourt expressed the concern that this \\"relative anonymity will allow government forces to arrest Carlos and violate his human rights with impunity and without fear of any international repercussion.\\" On March 22, as street protests continued, Vecchio, still defying the arrest order, addressed a crowd of supporters in Caracas.  Ideology  Popular Will has been variously described as right wing, even \\"fascist\\" by the government, but calls itself a centre to centre-left party, with socialist and progressive tendencies, although some sources have also described it as centre-right. The party supports LGBT rights, and following the 2015 parliamentary election, the first two LGBT members of the Venezuelan legislature (Tamara Adri√°n and Rosmit Mantilla) were elected under Popular Will's banner.\\"Elected congressmen fight to get out of jail in Venezuela\\". Fusion, December 14, 2015. = Party platform = The party platform, \\"The Best Venezuela\\" (La Mejor Venezuela), calls for an open, transparent government and for the punishment of abuses of power by public officials. It supports globalization and calls for an inclusive society \\"without regard to wealth, religion, age, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or political opinions.\\" L√≥pez, when running for president, called for greater autonomy in fiscal matters to be given to governors and mayors. The party seeks to make Venezuela the world's largest producer and exporter of oil. L√≥pez does not seek to nationalize oil firms but says that oil income should be used to form a \\"Solidarity Fund\\" to help alleviate extreme poverty and finance an efficient system of social security, as well as to diversify the non-oil sectors of the nation's economy. L√≥pez also opposes price controls and favors subsidizing domestic production. He supports the market economy and opposes \\"state capitalism.\\" The party's \\"real battle,\\" L√≥pez has claimed, is \\"against poverty, exclusion, and disrespect for human rights.\\" In opinion pieces in December 2013 and January 2014, he proposed the creation of a \\"Social Forum\\" within the context of which Venezuelans could \\"discuss and rethink\\" the country's future and forge a \\"new social pact.\\" L√≥pez expressed the view \\"that mineral resources are owned by the nation\\" and that \\"democratizing oil\\" can lead to a democratization of income. He also encouraged Venezuelans to invest in the oil business in order to \\"participate in its production.\\" In the January article, L√≥pez described Popular Will as a grassroots \\"social and political\\" movement that \\"avoids the harmful practices of old and new political parties\\" and that is opposed to \\"warlordism and cronyism in the selection of its authorities.\\" He added that Popular Will does \\"not share the vision of a hegemonic state that controls everything and decides everything\\"; rather, government's role is to promote the development of human capabilities, to help people flourish as free citizens, to cultivate \\"social solidarity,\\" and to foster \\"respect for the constitution.\\" In order to forge \\"the best Venezuela,\\" L√≥pez has written, Venezuelans must focus on \\"peace, welfare, and progress,\\" and must engage in \\"a broad process of consultation and reflection‚Ä¶with groups of experts in specific subject areas and with social movements, as well as with communities, in dialogues in which we can feel the needs and cries of Venezuelans.\\" He has expressed confidence that Venezuelans \\"can construct a country in which the problems that have never been solved can be solved, the eternal problems that exist from generation to generation.\\" L√≥pez has further spoken of creating a Venezuela \\"where liberty is exercised in a constructive and responsible manner,...and where opportunities are created for all Venezuelans, regardless of wealth, religion, age, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or political persuasion.\\" L√≥pez has said that Venezuela must commit itself to strengthening production and bringing down inflation, which, he said, would reduce corruption and enable Venezuelans to save money. He has held up the examples of Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and Colombia as countries \\"that had hyperinflation and achieved price stability.\\" He criticized price controls, saying that Venezuela, while having \\"a number of controls,\\" also had \\"the continent's highest inflation.\\" L√≥pez has described his foreign policy as \\"win-win\\" policy, the objective of which would be to solve the country's problems and to promote peace, welfare, and progress. He has said that he would curb the \\"ideologized\\" foreign policy of the current government. L√≥pez has also expressed belief in a multipolar world in which Venezuela would play a role as an international champion of democracy and human rights. = View of Bolivarian government = The party's manifesto states: \\"This is an infamous epoch because the laws are used to create injustice; it is a disastrous epoch because the laws are used to subdue, frighten and eliminate the people who protest and who demand justice\\". In January 2012, L√≥pez, at the time a presidential candidate, described the current Venezuelan government as authoritarian, and called on Venezuelans to join him in choosing \\"the path of democracy.\\" He said that the \\"first commitment\\" of government must be to justice, specifically to \\"functioning courts,\\" an end to impunity, and an end to corrupt tax authorities.

This massacre was later dubbed an incident by Chinese officials.  Background  The areas involved were the Josutu and Juu Uda Leagues of Inner Mongolia during the Manchu Qing Dynasty. They were located at the southern end of the Mongol land and faced devastating floods of Chinese colonization. While early migrants were insignificant in number and quickly assimilated into the Mongol society, Chinese farmers from northern Hebei later settled en masse and outnumbered the indigenous Mongols. Large-scale agriculturalization made the Mongols unable to continue pastoralism. The Mongols became agricultural farmers and adopted the Chinese system of land ownership. The presence of the large number of Chinese within Inner Mongolia resulted in a complex administrative system. The Chinese came under the jurisdiction of Chinese prefectures and counties, which were set up as enclaves within the Mongol lands. Mongol banners nominally retained the land ownership and ceaselessly fought over various rights over the Chinese settlers. As the Qing dynasty gradually lost the ability to maintain social order, the Chinese began to challenge the rule of the minority Mongols. Chinese tenants delayed or even refused land tax payment, and obstructed land surveys by Mongol authorities with force. Another main conflict between the indigenous and immigrant populations involved access to natural resources. Mongols strictly forbade the Chinese from cutting timbers on Mongol lands mainly for religious reasons. Violators were severely punished by banner officials, which fueled Chinese hostility toward Mongols. Little is known about the Jindandao (literally meaning to Golden Elixir Way). Also known as the Red Turban (–£–ª–∞–∞–Ω –º–∞–ª–≥–∞–π—Ç–∞–Ω), the Jindandao was a secret society and considered to be an offshoot of the White Lotus sect, which had previously risen in revolt at various times in China. Another sect involved was named Zaili. It was a religious sect popular in Northern China and had a confirmed connection with the White Lotus sect.Richard Shek, The Revolt of the Zaili, Jindan Sect in Rehe (Jehol), 1891, Modern China, Vol. 6, pp. 161‚Äì196, 1980. online edition  Rebellion  The outbreak of the rebellion took place in November 1891 when rebels attacked the government office of the Aukhan Banner. They slaughtered the jasagh (head) of the banner, Prince Daghchin, who was concurrently the head of the Juu Uda League and vandalized his ancestral tomb. They quickly rampaged southward into the Ongniud banners (and Chifeng County within them), and then into the Kharachin Left Banner. Around the same time, another group of rebels captured Chaoyang County within the T√ºmed Right Banner, the Josutu League. They moved into the neighboring T√ºmed banner and two Kharachin banners while annihilating Mongol communities. They openly employed anti-Mongol and anti-dynastic slogans including \\"Defeat the Qing and wipe of the Mongols\\" () and \\"Kill Mongols in revenge\\" (). In response, Li Hongzhang, Governor-General of Chinese Zhili Province, dispatched Ye Zhichao, Commander-in-chief of Zhili, to suppress the rebels. The Zhili forces crossed the Great Wall and marched from the south and southwest. On the eastern front, troops detached from Fengtian played a role in the encircling operation. The modernized army, communicating through telegraph, sending soldiers by the railway and armed with modern firearms, quickly crushed rebels in December. The rebel leader Yang Yuechun was executed in Tianjin. As was usual in China, the local population suffered at the hands of Chinese forces, not just rebels. What was worse for Mongols was that General Ye sided with the rebels, falsely reporting to the imperial court in Beijing that the Mongol banner army killed innocent Chinese. Prince Vangdudnamjil, the jasagh of the Kharachin Right Banner, who was consulted with by the imperial court, successfully rebutted General Ye's claim with a detailed report.  Impact  The rebels killed tens of thousands of Mongols, burned many Tibetan Buddhist temples, and devastated Mongol communities. The imperial court tried in vain to ease ethnic tensions, paying relief money to both the Mongols and the Chinese and forbidding further revenge. Beijing decided to make Chinese prefecture and county authorities collect tax from Chinese tenants on behalf of Mongol nobles. It also decided to put Mongol- Chinese conflicts under the jurisdiction of Chinese authorities. This further weakened the power of Mongol banners. The ethnic tension remained high throughout the first half of the 20th century. The situation was further worsened by Chinese warlords in the Republican era. In 1930s Mongol leaders pressed Manchukuo to stop and roll back the tide of Chinese migration. After the collapse of Manchukuo in 1945, Mongols felt somewhat relieved as the power vacuum was filled by troops from the Mongolian People's Republic and Soviet troops instead of Chinese armies. More than one hundred thousand Mongol refugees fled northward to the pastoral areas south of the Khinggan mountains. This resulted in rapid agriculturalization of the Jirim and Juu Uda Leagues in the early 20th century. The massacre by the Chinese no doubt strengthened Mongolian nationalism and movements for independence, autonomy and self- determination. Prince Gungsangnorbu, who succeeded Prince Vangdudnamjil of the Kharachin Right Banner, started just a few years later to modernize Mongol education and military training. Khaisan, who later played an important role in the Mongol independence movement, then worked for the Kharachin Right Banner and got involved in the disturbance.Borjigin Burensain „Éú„É´„Ç∏„ÇÆ„É≥„Éª„Éñ„É¨„É≥„Çµ„Ç§„É≥, Kingendai Harachin Tomedo ni okeru chiiki rieki sh≈´dan no keisei ËøëÁèæ‰ª£„Éè„É©„ÉÅ„É≥„Éª„Éà„É°„Éâ„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãÂú∞ÂüüÂà©ÁõäÈõÜÂõ£„ÅÆÂΩ¢Êàê (The formation of regional profit groups in Modern Harachin and Tumed areas), Uchi naru tasha: sh≈´hen minzoku no jiko ninshiki no naka no Ch≈´goku ÂÜÖ„Å™„Çã‰ªñËÄÖ=Âë®Ëæ∫Ê∞ëÊóè„ÅÆËá™Â∑±Ë™çË≠ò„ÅÆ„Å™„Åã„ÅÆ„Äå‰∏≠ÂõΩ„Äç (Immanent Stranger: \\"China\\" in the identify of ethnic minorities), pp.117‚Äì128, 2009. The impact of the massacre was not limited to Inner Mongolia. In July 1911, Bogd Gegen of the Khalkha (Outer Mongolia), who soon became the head of state of Mongolia, referred to the incident in his letter to the Russian emperor asking for support for the independence of Mongolia.  Interpretations  Mongols consider the incident as an ethnic conflict between Mongols and Chinese.Tang Kai-jian Ê±§ÂºÄÂª∫ and Zhang Yu Âº†ÂΩß, 1891Âπ¥ÁÉ≠Ê≤≥Èáë‰∏πÈÅìËµ∑‰πâ‰∏≠ÁöÑËíô„ÄÅÊ±âÊ∞ëÊóèÂÜ≤Á™Å (Han-Mongolian Nationality Conflict in Jindandao Uprising in Rehe in 1891), Ë•øÂåóÊ∞ëÊóèÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â≠¶Êä• Âì≤Â≠¶Á§æ‰ºöÁßëÂ≠¶Áâà (Journal of Northwest University For Nationalities (Philosophy and Social Science)), No. 6. 2005 pp.17‚Äì22. Given the impact on the Mongol society, Borjigin Burensain thought that the incident marked the beginning of modern Mongolian history while according to the official Chinese view, the Opium War marked the beginning of modern Chinese history.Borjigin Burensain „Éú„É´„Ç∏„ÇÆ„É≥„Éª„Éñ„É¨„É≥„Çµ„Ç§„É≥, Harachin Tomedo imin to kingendai Mongoru shakai „Éè„É©„ÉÅ„É≥„Éª„Éà„É°„ÉâÁßªÊ∞ë„Å®ËøëÁèæ‰ª£„É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´Á§æ‰ºö (Mongolian immigrants from the Qaraƒçin and Tumed areas within modern Mongolian society), Kingendai Uchi Mongoru T≈çbu no heny≈ç ËøëÁèæ‰ª£ÂÜÖ„É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´Êù±ÈÉ®„ÅÆÂ§âÂÆπ (Social and Cultural Change in Eastern Inner Mongolia in the Modern Period), pp. 318‚Äì345, 2007.

From this point of view, this incident can be called the Jehol Persecution (). The Chinese rebel sects burnt Catholic churches and Chinese converts in Jianchang County within the Kharachin Left Banner and Pingquan Prefecture within the Kharachin Right Banner. The number of casualties varies greatly from 170 to 1200. Borjigin Burensain argued that Christians were not the main target of the insurgence. The proclamations of the Jindandao made no mention of the Western religion while they were full of anti-Mongol slogans. The interest of Sinologists lies in the characteristics of the secret societies involved, especially in their relationships with the preceding White Lotus rebellions and the subsequent Boxer Rebellion. Borjigin Burensain pointed out a Chinese bias in historical sources used. Sinologists only investigated official archives that contain reports from the Chinese armies, in addition to Western accounts on Christian persecution. Reports from Mongol banners stored at the Lifanyuan were supposedly lost during the Boxer Rebellion.Borjigin Burensain, \\"Imin shakai no keisei to chiiki t≈çg≈ç\\" ÁßªÊ∞ëÁ§æ‰ºö„ÅÆÂΩ¢Êàê„Å®Á§æ‰ºöÁµ±Âêà, \\"Kingendai ni okeru Mongoru jin n≈çk≈ç sonraku shakai no keisei\\" ËøëÁèæ‰ª£„Å´„Åä„Åë„Çã„É¢„É≥„Ç¥„É´‰∫∫Ëæ≤ËÄïÊùëËêΩÁ§æ‰ºö„ÅÆÂΩ¢Êàê (Formation of the Mongolian Farming Village Society from later 19c to later 20c), pp. 157‚Äî233, 2003. Official publications of the People's Republic of China have appraised this massacre as a \\"peasant uprising\\" against \\"imperialism\\" and \\"feudalism.\\"Yao Hai-shan ÂßöÊµ∑Â±±, Áï•ËÆ∫ÊúùÈò≥Èáë‰∏πÈÅìËµ∑‰πâÁöÑÂèçÂ∏ùÂÄæÂêë (A Brief Comment on the Anti-imperialistic Inclination of Chaoyang Rebellion of Jindandao), Journal of Liaoning Normal University, Vol. 29, No.2, pp. 126‚Äì128, 2006. As an \\"anti-foreign, anti-imperialist uprising,\\" they emphasis on the attacks against Christians while the Mongol princes and lamas and Manchu officials are treated as feudal rulers to be overthrown. The communists have intentionally concealed the ethnic conflict dimension in the evaluation of the insurgence. As an example of such distortion, Borjigin Burensain pointed to the authoritative Brief History of the Mongol Nationality (, 1986), which altered Jindandao slogans, \\"Defeat the Qing and Wipe out the Mongols\\" (') to \\"Defeat the Qing and Destroy the Westerners\\" ('), and \\"Kill Mongols in revenge\\" () to \\"Kill Mongol nobles in revenge\\" ('). Mongols in the PRC see such an evaluation as the justification the slaughter of the Mongols. In 1990s Mongols from the Fuxin Mongol Autonomous County (the former T√ºmed Left Banner) protested against newspapers that glorified the Jindandao incident.

It is performed on New Year's Day of Nepal Sambat, the national lunar calendar of Nepal, which occurs during the Swanti festival. Mha Puja means \\"worship of the self\\" in Newari, and it celebrates the spirit within oneself. The ceremony signifies an auspicious beginning of the New Year, and invokes prosperity and longevity for the participant. Mha Puja and Nepal Sambat are also celebrated abroad where Nepalese have settled. The ceremony A row of mandalas (sandpainting of a sacred circular diagram) are drawn on the floor for each member of the family. Extra mandalas are drawn at the end of the row for the two messengers of death. Mandalas are also drawn for essential household items like water pitcher, winnowing tray and broom. The mandala is worshipped by making offerings of ritual food, sacred thread, colored paste, incense, lighted wicks and flowers. Family members then sit cross-legged in front of one's mandala, and the lady of the household walks down the row putting a dab of colored paste on their forehead. She then presents each member an extra long burning wick (khelu itƒÅh ‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤‡•Å ‡§á‡§§‡§æ:) which is placed next to the mandala. She also gives them sacred threads (kwakha ‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§ñ‡§æ) and a basket of fruits including citron (tahsibwa ‡§§:‡§∏‡§ø‡§¨‡•ç‡§µ) symbolizing long life and good fortune. The next part of the ceremony is Sagan Biyegu (‡§∏‡§ó‡§Ç ‡§¨‡§ø‡§Ø‡•á‡§ó‡•Å). One of the women walks down the line holding a clay pot containing Dhau (yogurt) from which everybody takes a dab and puts it on one's temple. The participants are then presented a set of auspicious ritual food consisting of boiled egg, smoked fish and rice wine. The rice wine is poured in a little bowl and refilled three times, until when the bowl must be held in the hand and not set down. The worship of the mandala is the principal ritual during Mha Puja. The mandala represents the universe, and the wick and incense stick which are lighted during the ceremony means that the participant should spread brightness and fragrance for others. Mha Puja is a revered custom among Newars, and is observed outside Nepal too. The mandala The mandala is a sandpainting made with powdered limestone. The Mha Puja mandala is drawn in the shape of an eight-petalled lotus inside a circle marked with water. It can be drawn freehand or by using a stencil or mould. At the center of the mandala, a small circle is drawn with mustard oil. This is surrounded by concentric rings marked with red rice, black lentil, black soybean, unhusked rice and puffed rice as per family tradition. The items used to adorn the mandala symbolize good fortune, long life and freedom from perils. The mandala has been interpreted as a microcosmic and macrocosmic representation of the self. The ingredients used to construct the Mha Puja mandala may differ as per caste group and family tradition, but the philosophy behind the ceremony is the same. The feast Bronze dinner plate with initial servings At the end of the ceremony, the family members partake of a feast. The bronze plate containing auspicious food items is placed on one's mandala, destroying the not so perfect mandala made and decorated design to signify worldly impermanence. The main menu consists of a set of eight items representing the Astha Matrika, the eight grandmother goddesses who are worshipped as protectors. They are known as Ajima in Nepal Bhasa. The arrangement of the food on the plate also represents a mandala, with a mound of beaten rice at the center surrounded by portions of eight side dishes. In addition, other food items are served to make a sumptuous feast. After dinner, the plates and leftover food are left as they are overnight. The floor is swept clean the next day.

Unlike most other species of Scaevola which grow into a bush, Scaevola albida is a ground cover, forming a mat on the ground around 30-40 centimetres across. Its leaves are bright green, semi-succulent and slightly hairy. They are of an elliptical shape with wavy edges. In spring or early summer, the plant bursts into a striking mass of small flowers, which range in colour from snow white, through to pale blue or lilac.

This piece of mantle can be identified using seismic velocity imaging as well as earthquake maps. Subducting oceanic slabs carry large amounts of water; this water lowers the melting temperature of the above mantle wedge. Melting of the mantle wedge can also be contributed to depressurization due to the flow in the wedge. This melt gives rise to associated volcanism on the earth's surface. This volcanism can be seen around the world in places such as Japan and Indonesia. thumb Water in mantle wedge Magmas produced in subduction zone regions have high volatile contents. This water is derived from the breakdown of hydrous minerals in the subducting slab, as well as water in the oceanic plate from percolation of seawater. This water rises from the subducting slab to the overriding mantle wedge. The water lowers the melting temperature of the wedge and leaves behind melt inclusions that can be measured in the associated arc volcanic rocks. Structure of the mantle wedge The forearc mantle extends from where the subducting slab meets the cold nose of the mantle wedge, this occurs at depths from 10‚Äì40 km. Low seismic attenuation, and high seismic velocities characterize this region. There is a boundary between this low attenuation region and a high attenuation region on the forearc side of the arc volcanoes. To image the mantle wedge region below volcanic arcs P-wave, S-wave and seismic attenuation images should be used in coordination. These tomographic images show a low velocity, high attenuation region above the subducting slab. The slowest velocities in these volcanic arc regions are Vp= 7.4 km¬∑s‚àí1 and Vs= 4 km¬∑s‚àí1. Mantle wedge regions that do not have associated arc volcanism do not show such low velocities. This can be attributed to the melt production in the mantle wedge. Mantle wedge flow Flow in mantle wedges has important effects on the thermal structure, overall mantle circulation and melt within the wedge. Minerals are anisotropic and have the ability to align themselves within the mantle when exposed to strain. These mineral alignments can be seen using seismic imaging, as waves will travel through different orientations of a mineral at different speeds. Shear strain associated with mantle flow will align the fast direction of pyroxene and olivine grains in the direction of flow. This is the most common theory on flow within the mantle, although opposing theories do exist (6). Flow within the mantle wedge is parallel to the crust until it reaches the relatively cooler nose of the wedge, then is overturned and is parallel to the subducting slab. The nose of the wedge is generally isolated from the overall mantle flow. Oxidation in the mantle wedge Studies have shown that magmas that produce island arcs are more oxidized than the magmas that are produced at mid-ocean ridges. This relative degree of oxidation has been determined by the iron oxidation state of fluid inclusions in glassy volcanic rocks. It has been determined that this state of oxidation is correlated with the water content of the mantle wedge. Water itself is a poor oxidant and therefore the oxidizing agent must be transported as a dissolved ion in subducting slab.

Established in 2005, PATT attempts to raise environmental awareness and foster better practices in less developed nations around the world, planting trees as a means to combat deforestation and climate change. Organisational history =Establishment and purpose= The Plant A Tree Today Foundation (PATT) was organised in November 2005 by Andrew Steel,\\"Bazaar of Ideas,\\" United Nations ESCAP Environmental and Development News, vol. 9, no. 4 (December 2009), pg. 4.Angus Young, \\"Campaign Branches Out,\\" Hull Daily Mail, March 2, 2011. who established the organization as a means of combating ongoing deforestation in less-developed nations around the world through public education and tree- planting campaigns.Howard Lake, \\"Midas Attends The Plant A Tree Today Foundation 2nd Birthday Dinner, Bangkok, Thailand,\\" UK Fundraising, 12 November 2007. The group is a registered charitable organisation in the United Kingdom since 2006. Shortly after its launch, PATT began to work with UK fundraising consultant The Midas Partnership, which assisted in the generation of the initial capitalisation of the group. Fundraising activities were conducted both in the UK and in Thailand, a nation of primary concern to the organisation. It is also a registered foundation in Thailand. Steel remains a Director of the foundation, assisted by Charlotte Whalley. PATT works to raise awareness of global environmental issues, campaign for better environmental practices and take action against deforestation and climate change by planting trees. It implements tree planting projects and carbon offsetting with environmentally conscious businesses, provides environmental education to schools in developing countries, and funds community development projects in rural communities centred on tree planting and reforestation. Reforestation projects sponsored by PATT attempt to generate broad participation among the affected communities. For example, a 2008 reforestation project in Phetchaburi, Thailand, brought together schoolchildren, monks, governmental officers, and local villagers with forestation staff in planting over 2500 trees.\\"Bangkok Buzz,\\" Hua Hin Observer, Issue 152 (August 2008). Native tree species were replanted in a forest degraded by selective logging in an effort to restore animal habitat. The restored lowland deciduous tropical forest was to be used in the future as a tool for future environmental education. =Carbon Bank and Village Development Project= In 2009 the Carbon Bank and Village Development Project sponsored by PATT was awarded a 2009 United Nations-backed SEED Award. The SEED Initiative, founded by the United Nations Environmental Programme, the United Nations Development Programme and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, identifies and supports promising locally oriented enterprises in developing countries which are working to improve livelihoods and manage natural resources sustainably. The group's Carbon Bank and Village Development Project targeted 48 rural villages in Thailand, helping to establish community forests and a micro-finance system in each, managed by the local communities themselves. Ultimately it is hoped that degraded land in these communities will be reforested and climate change lessened through the project, while at the same time village economies are enhanced. =UK Educational Programme= In 2012, PATT launched a programme to join with almost 600 primary schools in the UK to provide educational materials, including online lesson plans and activities to be downloaded by teachers and used in classes. The educational materials are linked with the national curriculum, allowing the future generation to become aware of climate change and the problems which come with global warming. The programme includes an intranet site for students and teachers to communicate and view lesson plans, as well as being able to interact with others in the programme. Facts are supported by resources, such as live webcam and video sessions from the wildlife from the middle of the forests, showing the reforestation projects being carried out by PATT. Maps are also available to pinpoint on-going and future projects.

Early life  His family was from Alaiye (now Alanya in Antalya Province, Turkey), but Ahmed was born in S√∂ke (in Aydƒ±n Province, Turkey) to his father Cafer. One of his uncles was a vizier. He was appointed as the chief stableman (). In 1738, he was promoted to be the governor of Aydƒ±n Province. In 1742, he returned to Constantinople, the capital. He was appointed as the ni≈üancƒ± (one of the highest bureaucratic posts). Soon afterwards, he was promoted to be the grand vizier on 23 June 1740. He was sometimes called K√∂r Vezir (\\"blind vizier\\") because he was somewhat cross-eyed.  As Grand Vizier  His term in the office was one of the few periods of peace in the history of the Ottoman Empire, as the war against the Habsburg Monarchy and the Russian Empire had just ended and Nader Shah of Persia was occupied in Transoxiana and Daghestan. Despite the favorable conditions, Ahmed Pasha was unable to take advantage of the political state of peace and failed to follow his intended program of recovery and reform. Meanwhile, he was accused of dishonesty and indifference to state affairs. He was dismissed from the post on 21 April 1742 and was replaced by the more experienced Hekimoƒülu Ali Pasha, who had already once served a term as grand vizier 10 years ago.  Later years  He was exiled to the island of Rhodes. Soon thereafter, however, he returned to government services. In 1743, he became the governor of the Sanjak of ƒ∞√ßel (modern Mersin Province, Turkey) and then the governor of Sidon Eyalet. After the beginning of the new phase of the war against Persia, he was tasked with commanding () the northern portion of the front, where he successfully defended Kars (in modern Turkey). He then worked as the governor of Aleppo Eyalet (in modern Syria) and Diyarbekir Eyalet. After the Treaty of Kerden, he was appointed the governor of Baghdad Eyalet in 1747, the governor of Egypt Eyalet in 1748, and the governor of Adana Eyalet in 1751. However, Ahmed Pasha refused this last position in Adana, and in 1752, he returned to his former governorship in Aleppo, where he died in February 1753.Ayhan Buz: Osmanlƒ± Sadrazamlarƒ±, Neden Kitap, ƒ∞stanbul, 2009, pp 227-231 Contemporaries in Ottoman Egypt described him as a man interested in the sciences and philosophy, but reported that he was disappointed when he discovered that Egypt's famed Al-Azhar University had ceased to teach about sciences and focused on only religious education. Reportedly, he found even the most educated Egyptians and ulema to be illiterate in basic mathematics, spending most of his time with the few he found that shared his interest in the sciences.

Recruited locally, Thomson's career at Essendon coincided one of the club's most successful decades and as a result he found it difficult to command regular selection. He played ten games in 1981, his first season, which included an elimination final. In the opening round of the 1982 season he kicked five goals against Footscray but made just two further appearances that year. He participated in the Essendon reserves premiership in 1983 and put in some good performances in the seniors, including having 42 disposals and kicking three goals in a win over St Kilda. In 1984 he didn't play a single game and a shoulder injury restricted him to just six appearance in 1985, missing out on both of Essendon's premierships. Thomson, a utility, was used mostly in the back pocket and as a wingman over the course of his career. He was granted a clearance to Richmond in 1987 and was a regular fixture in the team that year, averaging 18 disposals.

It was directed by John Riggi, and written by Matt Hubbard. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on February 3, 2011. Guest stars include Ken Howard, Vanessa Minnillo, Brian Williams, Richard Belzer, Ice-T, and Elizabeth Banks. In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) meets with Kabletown's boss, Hank Hooper. Jack doesn't like Hank's tactics of being a friendly boss and, in order to impress him, steals Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) idea. Liz Lemon keeps Avery Jessup's pregnancy from relentless reporter Carmen Chao (Vanessa Minnillo). Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) fight over a sweatshirt. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"¬°Qu√© Sorpresa!\\" was watched by 4.784 million viewers during its original broadcast and received a 2.4 rating/6 share among adults aged 18‚Äì49. Plot Vanessa Minnillo guest starred in the episode as Avery's rival Carmen Chao Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) goes to the TGS set and tells them that Hank Hooper (Ken Howard) the boss of NBC's Kabletown is touring 30 Rockefeller Plaza and tells them all, especially Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), to act normal and tells them of his desire to make a good first impression. Meanwhile, Tracy and Jenna receive a gift basket from Hank Hooper. The gift basket contains two of the following: MacBook Air, a watch, and a cellphone. Both are very happy with each other until they see only one Kabletown sweatshirt. Tracy unwillingly lets Jenna have it. Later, Jack tells Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to go shopping for baby stuff with Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks), who has cleverly hidden her third-trimester pregnancy from her co-workers by wearing \\"fashionable\\" wizard cloaks. Jack goes on to tell her that Avery's dream career as the Financial reporter for NBC Nightly News would not be possible if they find out about the pregnancy, and that Carmen Chao (Vanessa Minnillo), an MSNBC reporter with an unknown ethnic background, is relentlessly trying to reveal Avery's secret pregnancy. Avery and Liz meet Carmen at the baby store where Liz defends Avery's secret pregnancy by saying that she is pregnant. Knowing this to be false, Carmen schedules an \\"interview\\" with Liz about single mothers. Jenna and Tracy continue to fight over the sweatshirt, so they talk to Liz about it, where both are wearing one side of the sweatshirt. Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) tells them to lay off Liz because she is \\"pregnant\\". As a result, Liz goes on to get the sweatshirt and throws it in the trashcan. Jack meets Hank, who hugs him at first sight, at the executive dining room (which Hank turned into an \\"Everyone Dining Room\\"), much to Jack's horror. While eating, Hank convinces Jack to do an employee pitch day, where every employee can pitch their ideas to upper management. The pitch doesn't go well, so Jack pitches an idea of his own to Hank. His idea is the Voice-Activated remote (or \\"Vo-Act\\"). Jack's idea is also unsuccessful as the characters on the TV can also control the television. With no apparent choice, he steals Kenneth's idea: the Blah-Bar, where there is a black bar on the bottom part of the screen which prevents people from seeing anything dirty. Jack tells this to Kenneth and asks him for what he wants, despite the fact that Kenneth wants nothing. Meanwhile, Liz's plan backfires when the TGS staff hears that Liz is pregnant. Jack convinces Liz to keep it that way, but Carmen keeps questioning Liz intensely. To really get the truth out of Liz, Carmen makes her do sexy pregnancy photos. During the photo shoot, Carmen tells Liz that she knows she's not pregnant and tries to convince her to admit it, but Carmen and her cameraman run away quickly when they see Liz grab oil and rub it on her stomach. Eventually, Jack tells Hank about stealing Kenneth's idea, with Kenneth in the room, apologizes, and files for his resignation. But Hank says that they're \\"gonna be just fine.\\" And since, Kenneth wants nothing, Hank suggests that they hug, much to Kenneth's joy. In the end, Avery is moved to NBC Nightly News (to Carmen's chagrin) and her pregnancy is finally revealed. To acknowledge their gratefulness for Liz's efforts to help Avery, Jack and Avery plan to give their daughter the middle name Elizabeth. Tracy and Jenna find out that Liz is not pregnant, so she gives them her \\"pregnancy\\" photos as her \\"punishment\\". Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 4.784 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 2.4 rating/6 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The figure was a decrease from the previous episode, Operation Righteous Cowboy Lightning, which was seen by 4.922 million households. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix described the episode as \\"uneven but funny-enough\\" and spoke positively about Ken Howard's performance, but opined that \\"the Liz/Avery/Vanessa Minillo story was underdeveloped and didn't have a good enough payoff [...] and the only good thing about the Tracy/Jenna subplot was how quickly it got back-burnered.\\" References External links 2011 American television episodes 30 Rock (season 5) episodes ","title":"¬°Qu√© Sorpresa!"},{"id":"31248476","text":"Sri Darma Muneeswaran Temple is a Hindu temple in Serangoon North, Singapore.

There were also protests in Argentine embassies and consulates in cities such as New York, Miami, Madrid, Sydney, Bogot√°, Santiago de Chile, Naples, Zurich and Barcelona, among others. The protest is considered not only a call to Kirchnerism, but also to the opposition, because they did not have a strong leader. The event Only in the City of Buenos Aires, there were hundreds of thousands of protesters. Most of them stayed in the surroundings of the Obelisk. In Olivos, more than 30,000 protesters gathered outside the official residence of the President. The protest, considered a cacerolazo, gathered up, according to several sources, over 2 million people across the country, the biggest and noisiest anti-government demonstration in a decade. Protesters rejected inflation, corruption, media controls, a possible re-election by Fern√°ndez and insecurity; without party identification. People were convened by social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, but also text messages, e-mails and instant messengers. =Sites=  Autonomous city of Buenos Aires  The main meeting point was the Obelisk. 9 de Julio Avenue had to stop the traffic and led to a huge mass of protesters. The first place where a crowd carrying a huge flag was seen was in Santa Fe and Callao, from there they marched to the Microcentro. A mass of people come and went through Avenida de Mayo, which connects the Obelisk with Plaza de Mayo. Plaza de Mayo was also an epicenter of the protest.

Adjacent stations History The private Kyushu Railway, had opened a track from to by 5 May 1895, and thereafter expanding southwards in phases, as part of the construction of a line to Nagasaki. Separately, a track was laid from (then known as Nagasaki) north to Nagayo, which opened on 22 July 1897 as the terminus. On the same day, Michinoo was opened as an intermediate station between Urakami and Nagayo. When the Kyushu Railway was nationalized on 1 July 1907, Japanese Government Railways (JGR) took over control of the station. On 12 October 1909, track from Tosu through Haiki, ≈åmura, Michinoo to Nagasaki was designated the Nagasaki Main Line. On 2 October 1972, a shorter inland bypass route was opened between through to Urakami was opened, which became known as the new line or Ichinuno branch of the Nagasaki Main Line. The section serving Michinoo became known as the old line or the Nagayo branch. With the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR), the successor of JGR, on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR Kyushu. Passenger statistics In fiscal 2016, the station was used by an average of 987 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), and it ranked 166th among the busiest stations of JR Kyushu.

It was created as a two player version of their 1973 game, Hot Shot. The table is pool themed and is very popular among skilled players and collectors, because of the skill required to hit all 14 drop targets in the game. 2,900 units were manufactured.http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=271  Game Play  The goal of the game is to light all 15 billiard ball lights. The player must hit the ball drop targets on either side of a central bumper to light its corresponding ball light, except the 8 ball. The 8 ball is lit by either going through the middle gate or by stopping in the center pit. When stopped in the center pit, a diverter (also called a gate) will change position, allowing a ball drained in the right outlane to return to the plunger lane. Once all the ball lights are lit, the special can be achieved by hitting the target on the special lit side. The light switches sides when the slingshots are hit. Replays can be achieved by hitting the special lit side and by earning 50,000 points, 64,000 points, and 72,000 points. Design team * Concept: Ed Krynski * Game Design: Ed Krynski * Artwork: Gordon Morison  Digital versions  Big Shot is available as a licensed table of The Pinball Arcade for several platforms, and can be adjusted for three ball or five ball play. This game is also included in the Pinball Hall of Fame: The Gottlieb Collection for the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, Wii, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable. The game has goals that players must achieve to open a secret in the game. In the Gamecube/Xbox/PS2 version, the table's goal is to drop all fourteen drop targets and light the eight ball. When the player achieves this, an unlockable will be given. In the Wii/PSP version however, the table's goal is to clear either one side of drop targets (either solids or stripes) including the eight ball, when the player achieves this it will unlock a table for free play and it is incorrectly marked as released in 1974 on some digital versions.

In Deutsche Bahn‚Äôs timetable it has route number 761. A branch line once ran from Kirchheim to Weilheim an der Teck, but it is now closed. History The section from Wendlingen (then called Unterboihingen) to Kirchheim opened on 21 September 1864. Its original operator was the Kirchheim Railway Company (Kirchheimer Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft), which was the first private railway company in W√ºrttemberg. It was later taken over by the Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways. On 1 October 1899, the first train ran to Oberlenningen after the line had been extended there. In 1975, a large section of the line was moved in Kirchheim, the old station near to the centre of the town was abandoned and a new station was built on the southern outskirts. A shopping centre (the Teck-Center), was built on the site of the old station and the old track, which partly ran through the local streets, was abandoned. Until December 2009, the line was a single track, non-electrified line operated by DB Regio, with services from Wendlingen to Kirchheim twice an hour and from there to Oberlenningen once an hour. Some morning and evening trains ran to and from Plochingen. The service was operated with class 650 diesel multiple units and locomotive-hauled trains (consisting of a class 218 diesel locomotive and three Silberling carriages). The vehicles were operated by DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee (RAB), a subsidiary of DB Regio. There had long been a proposal to connect the Teck Railway to the Stuttgart S-Bahn network and thus prolong the S-Bahn line S1 from Plochingen Wendlingen to Kirchheim. In early 2008, after several years of planning, the Verband Region Stuttgart (Stuttgart Region Organisation), which coordinates public transport in the Stuttgart Region, concluded a contract for rail services with Deutsche Bahn for the construction and financing of the line. Then from July 2008 until the start of the December 2009 timetable, the line between Wendlingen and Kirchheim was electrified and modernised, with line closures during the two intervening summer holiday seasons. In Wendlingen, the lead at the junction with the Neckar-Alb Railway was doubled to allow the S-Bahn trains to use the platforms appropriate to their direction of operation. A new train storage area was created in Kirchheim for terminating trains. Branch line  The 7.74-kilometre-long branch line from Kirchheim (Teck) South over Jesingen and Holzmaden to Weilheim an der Teck was opened in 1908. The last scheduled passenger train ran on this section on September 25, 1982. On March 31, 1988, the Holzmaden‚ÄìWeilheim section was also closed for freight. The Kirchheim‚ÄìHolzmaden section was served by freight services until September 25, 1994. The section after the 5.5 km mark (just past Holzmaden station) has been dismantled and is partly converted to a foot or bike path. The Kirchheim‚ÄìHolzmaden section is still usable but it is not used. The five-kilometre section from Kirchheim unter Teck South station to Holzmaden station will eventually be reactivated for work trains for the new Wendlingen‚ÄìUlm high-speed railway. Excavated material from the new line (including the tunnels) will be carried on the A 8 to Holzmaden via a highway exit dedicated to this traffic. There the excavated material will be loaded on to rail wagons to continue its journey. Kirchheim station has a set of points that would allow the extension of the S-Bahn along the line to Holzmaden. Current operations  Services on the extension of the S1 from Plochingen to Kirchheim unter Teck commenced on December 13, 2009. Since then Wernau, Wendlingen, √ñtlingen and Kirchheim have been served every half-hour by class 423 electric multiple units. Up to this point the line is electrified and is built for a top speed of 100 km/h. Passengers have to transfer at Kirchheim station to continue towards Oberlenningen. Between Kirchheim and Oberlenningen hourly services are formed of class 650 diesel multiple units operated by DB ZugBus Regionalverkehr Alb-Bodensee. On this section the speed is limited to 60 km/h. The transport authority for regional and S-Bahn traffic on the Teck Railway is the Verband Region Stuttgart (VRS). The section from Kirchheim to Oberlenningen is one of three regional lines that VRS is responsible for; the others are the Schuster Railway and the Backnang‚ÄìLudwigsburg line. Until a few years ago the line was the responsibility of Nahverkehrsgesellschaft Baden- W√ºrttemberg (Regional Transport Company of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, NVBW). Between Wendlingen and Kirchheim, the line has colour light signals and is controlled from two interlockings in Wendlingen and Kirchheim. Safe working on the Kirchheim‚ÄìOberlenningen section operates under the system known as Zugleitbetrieb (\\"train control\\"), which is used in Germany on simple routes. Freight also plays an important role on the Teck Railway. Trains run several times a day to the Papierfabrik Scheufelen (Scheufelen paper mill) in Oberlenningen and several times a week to a scrap dealer in Dettingen unter Teck. The freight yard at Oberlenningen station is relatively large for a secondary line and has its own Class V 60 diesel shunter. Freight is now operated exclusively with class 294 diesel locomotives. The class 218 locomotives formerly used have not been in systematic use since 11 December 2009. Planning  Modernising the section from Kirchheim to Oberlenningen by increasing speeds and upgrading the technical safety of railway crossings would improve connections with the S-Bahn in Kirchheim. There are no concrete plans at this time. The Regional Transportation Plan for the Stuttgart region of 2001 identified a rail link between G√∂ppingen and Kirchheim unter Teck, connecting the abandoned tracks of the Voralb Railway (Voralbbahn) with the Teck Railway, and classified it as of \\"high urgency\\".Regional transport plan of the Stuttgart Region of 2001.

Life Tate was born in 1560 at Gayton, the second son of Bartholomew Tate (d. 1601) of Delapre, Northamptonshire, by his wife Dorothy, daughter of Francis Tanfield of Gayton. On 20 December 1577 he matriculated as a commoner at Magdalen College, Oxford, but left the university without a degree and entered the Middle Temple. He was called to the bar in 1587, but devoted his attention mainly to antiquarian researches. He was an original member of the Society of Antiquaries, and was for some time its secretary; a volume of collections by him (Stowe MS. 1045) is said to consist of matters discussed by the society. In 1601 Tate was returned to parliament for Northampton. On 22 February 1604 he was placed on commissions of the peace in the counties of Glamorgan, Brecknock, and Radnor, and from 1604 till 1611 he sat in parliament as member for Shrewsbury. In 1607 he was Lent reader in the Middle Temple, and about the same time was employed as justice itinerant in South Wales. He died, unmarried, on 11 November 1616.

The website was established by the founder of 4chan, Christopher Poole, and backed by Andreessen Horowitz, SV Angel, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Founder Collective, and Joshua Schachter. It closed in 2014.  Company and funding  Reports indicate that Canvas Networks received at least in seed funding. The site had seven employees and was based in New York City.  History  On January 31, 2011, Canvas officially opened, sending out invitations to users who had previously signed up to receive updates. In March 2011, Canvas made its discussion threads viewable by users who were not registered, while remaining in closed beta status. In early 2011, Poole began to virally market Canvas on sites such as Reddit. Canvas moved from private beta to open beta on September 6, 2011, at which point Poole reported that over fifty thousand users had registered during the private beta period. On January 21, 2014, the Canvas blog announced that the site was shutting down. The Canvas team promised that users would be able to download their contributions to the site in the near future, and proposed the possibility of an archive of the site's old threads. Poole called his newer project, DrawQuest, \\"by all accounts a success\\", but noted that it had been created (in early 2013) \\"after the failure of our first product, Canvas\\". He hoped to keep DrawQuest running for \\"a few more months\\". Poole told TechCrunch that his team was \\"never able to crack the business side of things in time\\", that the value of their user community was not apparent to investors, and that they could not sufficiently monetize in-game purchases.  Site features and purpose  Canvas was an imageboard that allowed for anonymous and non-anonymous sharing and commenting on media, as well as the \\"remixing\\" of posted images, and the adding of music to animated GIFs. Unlike 4chan or other sites such as Reddit, Canvas had image editing tools built into it, negating the need for desktop editing programs like Adobe Photoshop in order to share with the site's community. Poole's goal with the website was to \\"reimagine forums in a world where everyone has a fast, modern browser\\". He asserts that the central idea of Canvas is \\"play\\", where \\"photo, video, and audio is all interactive, malleable, and participatory\\". Though the site was intentionally separate from 4chan, it also emphasized anonymity, and allowed people to post anonymously or using pseudonyms. Despite the ability to act anonymously, the site received some criticism, especially from users of 4chan, for at first offering Facebook Connect as the only signup mechanism. It subsequently moved away from that policy. Closure On January 14, 2015, founder Christopher Poole announced that the company had been dissolved in December 2014 with the remaining funds being donated to charity. This was, in part, due to a series of security breaches that had occurred on the website.

He previously served as the Chairman of the Israel's Editors Committee.  Politics  Galezer was born and raised in Afeka Tel-Aviv. In 1973, at the age of 21, he was appointed spokesman of \\"Moked,\\" a left wing movement. He then became a co-founder of the peace party, \\"Mahane Sheli\\", and served as its spokesman during the 1977 elections. Galezer did not continue in politics after the 1977 elections.  Professional Journalism  Galezer started his journalistic career in the early 1980s at Jerusalem weekly newspaper, Kol Ha-Ir, which earned an impressive reputation as qualitative, bold, liberal that included exclusive interviews and extensive in-depth investigative reporting. In the mid 1990s, Galezer was appointed editor in chief of Schocken Group‚Äôs local newspapers. At the end of 1996, Galezer was appointed editor in chief of \\"7 Days\\" weekly magazine in Yediot Aharonot, then the most widely circulated magazine in Israel. He earned a name as a bold editor who published many important stories of government corruption and questionable connections between tycoons and politicians ‚Äì including the first investigative reporting about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's family receiving gifts (The Amedi case) and his wife's problematic behavior (The Sara case). The weekly magazine also published exposes of a series of military and security failures ‚Äì one of which won The (the most important journalistic award in Israel) for research about the high propensity of cancer among naval commando sailors due to training exercises in the polluted Kishon river. Continuing his successful track record, Galezer was appointed Deputy Editor in Chief of Yedioth Aharonot in charge of all the papers' magazines.  Television Career  At the beginning of the millennium, Galezer retired from Yedioth Aharonot to pursue a television career and served for 6 years as editor in chief of the Israeli investigative TV show, \\"Uvda with Ilana Dayan\\". Galezer introduced a dramatic change in the program's format and engaged, alongside Ilana Dayan, a team of star reporters and investigative journalists, such as Itai Engel, Omri Assenhaim, Orly Vilnai, Igal Musco and Roni Kuban. Under his leadership, \\"Uvda\\" published investigative reports about criminals taking over 'Roberto' Models Agency, Israir airlines cover-up of a near accident at Ben Gurion airport, Captain R' - killing of a girl by the Israeli Army at Girit base, the Ferinian case ‚Äì an investigation leading to a Commission of Inquiry and ousting of police inspector general Moshe Karadi, and Anthrax experiments done on special units‚Äô soldiers, an investigation that also led to establishing a Commission of Inquiry.  Journalism  At the end of 2007 Galezer was appointed co-editor in chief of Maariv newspaper alongside Ruth Yuval replacing Amnon Dankner. Galezer and Yuval succeeded in cutting its losses (from ILS 5 million to ILS 1 million) and stopped the decrease in circulation, but resigned In 2009, following disagreements with Maariv's publisher, Ofer Nimrodi. Since 2009, Galezer has been a member of the press council, a board member of DocAviv international documentary film festival, and an investigative press lecturer at The Tel Aviv Academic College and The Netanya Academic College.

Sadiq allegedly committed suicide under suspicious circumstances related to the 2G spectrum case in India.  Early career  Batcha was born in kattur village in Lalgudi taluk, Trichy, one of four brothers. Whilst Batcha was still in Karur his two brothers Jamal Mohammed and Jaffar Ali opened a real estate business. Batcha received a Master of Business Administration (MBA). He had a modest start to his career, selling mattresses and clothes as a door-to-door salesperson. He initially went door-to-door by foot, then by bicycle. Anecdotal accounts of Batcha's early financial ventures claim that he sought to purchase land, providing the owning party with an initial deposit upfront. He would then re-sell the land to a larger party, making a profit, and settle his debt with the initial landowner. Batcha borrowed sums of money from banks and private lenders and began to diversify his activities. Some of these ventures failed and, at this point, Batcha sought the help of a lawyer, A. Raja. Allegations of improper conduct surfaced soon after in relation to Batcha's pre-existing ownership of cheaply acquired land involved with important infrastructure projects that were scheduled for the Perambalur district. A. Kaliaperumal, A. Raja's elder brother, is the Joint MD (managing director) of Green House Promoters.  Business Interests  Green House Promoters Private Limited was floated months after A. Raja became a Union minister in 1999. The real estate company soon flourished, acquiring huge tracts of land in the state's small towns and selling it at a huge premium. It was alleged that Batcha forcibly acquired large tracts of land from the poor at cheap rates and sold it to Madras Rubber Factory for a huge sum. The Green House Promoters, starting as a nondescript company with an equity base of Rs 100,000 in 2004, grew to a company of over Rs 6 billion in revenue within a short time. The CBI is investigating the rapid growth of the company. The company also indirectly benefited from the 2G spectrum case by acquiring shares of a company that, in turn, became a partner in Shahid Balwa's Swan Telecom. Swan Telecom was one of the beneficiaries of the first-come-first- served policy, which came from the then minister for Telecom in India.  Death  Sadiq Batcha is said to have committed suicide at his residence in Chennai on Wednesday, 16 March 2011 (IST). He was found hanged at his home. He was pronounced \\"dead on arrival\\" at the Apollo hospital in Chennai at about 1:30 pm. Doctors believe he died of asphyxia. Some believe that this was not a suicide, but that he died from mysterious causes. In a long letter, which started with an apology, he blamed none for his suicide and said he felt sorry for Raja's plight. He expressed his wish to be reborn and wanted his siblings to be happy and his wife and children to stay in Chennai for their education. Some believe that Batcha had too much information and he was the man who could have given CBI the exact map of the 2G money trail. It is also alleged that he was the link between the 2G money, the underworld and the hawala operators. A CBI investigation alleged that his company, Greenhouse, was a front company belonging to Raja, and all the money earned through the 2G spectrum case was hidden in Greenhouse. The investigations have also shown that Batcha handled all of Raja's money. The CBI wanted names of four very crucial accomplices who helped Batcha rout the money between India and Singapore. These men are alleged to be operatives of the Dawood gang. Sources say the CBI wanted to interrogate Batcha further on this on the Wednesday he was found dead. The doctor who performed an autopsy and postmortem on Batcha's body resigned from government service. Dr V Dekal, who heads the department of forensic sciences at Madras Medical College, and whose father was a DMK member said he had put in his papers on 3 March, over a fortnight before Batcha's suicide, to contest the Tamil Nadu assembly elections. The Directorate of Public Health has reportedly rejected Dr V Dekal's resignation on grounds of shortage of staff and lack of sufficient notice. Dekal claims that he was only on contract with the Health Department and could, therefore, quit at any time. CBI investigated the case.

It opened in 1992 with the park under the name Explorer's Club. It specialises in a wide range of pizzas and pastas. Explorer's Club Photographs of Explorers displayed in the restaurant At the opening of the park, the building was originally known as Explorer's Club Restaurant. Housed in a colonial estate in a lush jungle where adventurers rest and have meals, the Club allowed guests to encounter famous European explorers, portrayed by cast actors, like David Livingstone or Ernest Hemingway. The featured soundtrack fitted the theme, with tunes such as Theresien-Fanfare, Colonel Bogey March, Onward, Christian Soldiers, Royal Air Force March Past or Cavalry of the Steppes. The Club features a wide outdoor setting area, with one part overlooking waterfalls, and an inside room complete with trees displaying animatronic birds and animals (which was reminiscent of the Tiki Room). Some of these animals even interacted with the actors. The room is also ornamented with artifacts from numerous exotic regions, and murals representing journeys around the world. The meals were originally colonial-inspired, and delivered on table. The nearby ride Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril still displays in its queueline part items featuring the name Explorer's Club. Colonel Hathi's Pizza Outpost In 1993, one year after the opening of the park, the decision was made to turn the restaurant into a counter service for East-Asian meals, since guests lacked interest in table meals. Some of the trees were removed to make way for counter services. Then, in 1995, the restaurant became an eating place for pizzas and pastas. Its new chosen theme was Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book, especially its Disney adaptation. Though not entirely, most of the original soundtrack was replaced with samples from this movie's one.

It corresponds to what is now the Libya and Egypt frontier, including the towns of Bomba (ancient Phthia), Timimi (ancient Paliurus), Tobruk (ancient Antipyrgus), Acroma (ancient Gonia), Bardiya, As-Salum, and Sidi Barrani (ancient Zygra). The territory stretched to the far south, encompassing the Siwa Oasis, which at the time was known for its sanctuary to the deity Amun. The eastern part of Marmarica, by some geographers considered a separate district between Marmarica and Aegyptus, was known as Libycus Nomus. In late antiquity, Marmarica was also known as Libya Inferior, while Cyrenaica was known as Libya Superior. Libya is found in Africa and is located west of the Nile, more precisely west of the mouth of the Nile at Canopus. The periplus of Scylax of Caryanda names the Adyrmachidae as the first people of Libya (Africa). Marmarica proper was delimited towards the east by the escarpment of Catabathmus Magnus, now known as Akabah el-Kebir, at Salum. The geographers of the Hellenistic period included Egypt in the continent of Asia, and drew the boundary between Asia and Africa (Libya) at this point. Under the Roman Empire, Marmarica included the Libycus Nomus, located between the Catabathmus and the Bay of Plinthine (Sinus Plinthinetes). This area had formerly been considered part of Egypt. The city of Paraetonium (also Ammonia, modern Mersa Matruh) was the westernmost town of Egypt, for which reason it together with Pelusium was known as the \\"horns of Egypt\\". About 10 stadia west of Paraetonium was Apis, marking the border to the Libyan Nomos. Menelaus Portus (near modern Zawiyat Umm Rukbah), according to tradition founded by Menelaus, was known as the site of the death of Agesilaus II. The inhabitants of Marmarica were known generically as Marmaridae, but they are given the special names of Adyrmachidae and Giligammae in the coastal districts, and of Nasamones and Augilae in the interior. The Adyrmachidae are said to have differed considerably from the nomadic tribes of the country, strongly resembling the Egyptians. The territory south of the Libyan Nomos was inhabited by the Ammonii, centered on the celebrated and fertile oasis of Ammon (Siwa) Both Cyrenaica and Marmarica were included in the diocese of Egypt in the 4th century, within the larger Praetorian prefecture of the East (while Tripolitania was in the Praetorian prefecture of Italy).

They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine begins in the midrib, spreading outward and upward between two lateral veins. In that part of the early mine adjacent to the lower of the lateral veins between which it lies, the parenchyma is left in narrow transverse bars, giving the mine a very characteristic aspect. As the mine increases, it extends beyond the confines of the two veins, with irregular projections and parenchyma all consumed. The pupa is formed within the mine beneath the transverse bars, which are here lined with silk forming a tubular pupal chamber. Adults are on wing from early July to mid-September.

They mine the leaves of their host plant. The larva makes an irregular blotch mine that is often changed for a new one. Between the two leaf mines the larva creates a path of silk to travel between these mines. The frass is partly ejected from the mine and partly deposited inside. Although next to the food plant, Ipomoea santillanii also occurred, no leaf mines were found on that plant. Adults have been collected in May.

This required a new generation of fasteners and tools, which could be installed from one side of the assembly to replace conventional rivets. By the 1950s the company was focusing on providing new value added assembly solutions, this \\"systems\\" approach created greater optimisation and provided customers with a single source for dependable fasteners and installation equipment. In 1961 the company was renamed 'Avdel' and substantial growth throughout the next two decades saw it become one of the world's largest manufacturers of blind fasteners and installation tools.

After the production of most cheeses, about 50% of milk solids remain in the whey, including most of the lactose and lactalbumin. The production of whey cheese allows cheesemakers to use the remaining whey, instead of discarding it as a waste product. There are two fundamentally different products made of whey and called whey cheese:Charles Thom, Walter Fisk, The Book of Cheese, 1918, reprinted in 2007 as , p. 295 * Albumin cheese, made by coagulating the albumin in the whey with heat and possibly acid: ricotta, mizithra, and so on. * Norwegian brown cheeses, made by boiling down the whey to concentrate the sugar, and consisting primarily of caramelized milk sugar: mysost and the like. Since these are not primarily made of coagulated milk proteins, they are technically not cheese. Cheese and whey cheese are distinct categories in the Codex Alimentarius. In the appellation system of the European Union, protected whey cheeses are included in class 1.4 for other products of animal origin instead of class 1.3 for cheeses. Production UrdƒÉ is a Romanian whey cheese Two different methods are used to produce whey cheese: * The whey can be concentrated and then moulded. Cheeses produced with this method possess a relatively high lactose content. Typically, they have a yellowish to brown color and possess a sweet, cooked, or caramelized flavor. * Heat can be used to coagulate the whey and optionally adds acid. This type has a relatively low lactose content and a white to yellowish color. It is possible to ripen whey cheeses made with the coagulation method. With both methods, the whey may be pre-concentrated prior to the further concentration or coagulation of the whey. The process may also include the addition of milk, cream, or other raw materials of milk origin before or after concentration or coagulation. Depending on the production method used, whey cheeses range from soft to hard consistencies. Fresh soft varieties contain a lot of moisture and expire quickly. Ripened hard varieties have a much lower moisture content, making them preservable for much longer. The production yield of whey cheese is generally lower than ordinary cheese because whey does not possess as many nutrients as milk. Yield is dependent on the composition of the whey, the addition of milk or cream, the production technology, and the composition (moisture content) of the final product. With efficient modern methods such as ultrafiltration, 10 to 20% of solids or more remain after the whey is mixed with cream and reduced. Because almost all varieties generally contain significant amounts of whey, they are unsuitable for consumption by people who are lactose intolerant. Brocciu is lower in lactose. Varieties Whey cheese is produced all over the world. Ricotta is the most important and popular cheese of this type. It originated in Italy, but has become popular in many parts of the world. * Anari cheese, from Cyprus * Anthotyros, from Greece * Breuil, from the Basque region * Brocciu, from Corsica * Brousse (cheese), from Provence, France * Brunost, from Norway * Gailtaler Almschotten, from Carinthia, Austria * Greuilh, from the Nouvelle- Aquitaine region of France * Lor, from Turkey * Manouri, from Greece * Mizithra, from Greece * Primost, from Norway * Recuite, from France * Requeij√£o, from Portugal * Ricotta, from Italy * Rigouta, from Tunisia * Schottenziger, from Switzerland * S√©rac, from the French and Valais Alps * UrdƒÉ, from Romania * Xynotyro, from Greece References External links * ","title":"Whey cheese"},{"id":"31249476","text":"All Saints' Church, Sandon Sandon is a village and civil parish in the North Hertfordshire district, in the county of Hertfordshire, England.

The Prince's \\"feats\\" of lobbying legerdemain included securing the purchase of AWACS surveillance aircraft in the teeth of fierce Israeli and congressional opposition, and augmenting his influence with the Reagan administration by quietly supplying $32m to the Contras in Nicaragua and $10m to anti-communist politicians in Italy.

Biology The larvae feed on Parietaria judaica, Parietaria officinalis, Parietaria pensylvanica and Pilea pumila. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mines starts as an irregular gallery usually at the midrib, soon leading to an irregular blotch. Inside the mine a silken spinning is found, which often causes contortion of the leaf. The larva constructs a silk-lined gallery, which serves as a shelter when the larva is not feeding. The frass is partly inside the mine, but most of it is rejected through a hole at the beginning of the mine. The black pellets of frass on the underside of a leaf indicate the presence of a larva. New mines are made very often. The cocoon is found inside the mine. The species is bivoltine, with adults on wing throughout the year in southern areas.

History The Catria horse derives from the cross-breeding of Maremmano-derived stock from west of the Apennines, thought to have been brought from their homeland in Tuscany mainly by charcoal burners, with other breeds, principally Franches-Montagnes. After the Second World War, the number of Catria horses decreased. The population survived in mountainous areas suitable only for untended livestock. In 1974, the Azienda Speciale Consortile del Catria, or \\"special co-operative agency of Catria\\", took control of horse breeding in the area. In 1980, a herd book was opened to conserve the bloodlines of the breed. Catria horses are used in the mountains for agricultural purposes, particularly for carrying cut firewood from steep woodland. They are also used for riding and for the production of horsemeat. Characteristics Catria Horses may only be bay or chestnut; breeding stallions may not be chestnut.

Biography He was born in B√°taap√°ti, in Tolna County, which was mainly inhabited by Germans. This may have had an effect on his choice of musical instruments as the harp was very popular with the German people in his community. Many wanderer harpists lived in the counties south of Lake Balaton. Between 1926-34 Rohmann studied at the Academy of Music in Budapest as a student of Otto Mosshammer. In 1938, he was a scholar of the Hungarian Opera House. After the war, in 1945 he became a professional musician with the Opera House and remained the harpist of this institution until his retirement in 1971. From 1948 he was a harp teacher at the B√©la Bart√≥k Music Institute in Budapest. He had many disciples who became famous later; for example, Erzs√©bet Ga√°l, Andrea Kocsis, Anna Lelkes, √âva Maros, Andrea Vigh and Aristid von W√ºrtzler. Rohmann was also involved in the international music scene. W√ºrtzler invited him to the USA repeatedly, where he gave master classes at the University of Hartford in 1964 and 1969. There he met the French professor, Pierre Jamet, founder of the first World Harp Congress. He attended several international harp competitions as a member of the jury. He was a friend of Jakob M√ºller the Russian violinist, with whom he toured in 1958. Also in 1958 he gave a concert with contrabassist Zolt√°n Tibay, which was recorded for television in Paris. In 1965 Rohmann performed at the Hungarian premiere of Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi‚Äôs 'Harp competition', conducted by P√°l Varga. He played this composition again with the Saint Stephen Symphony Orchestra at the Academy of Music on 10 November 1975. In 1962, as a member of the Hungarian quintet with J√°nos Szebenyi, Zolt√°n D≈ëry, J√≥zsef Iv√°nyi and Eszter Is√©py he presented L√°szl√≥ Lajtha's composition, which was written for flute, violin, viola, cello and harp and marked II. Quintet, Op. 46. Memory Harold Schiffman, an American composer and former pupil of Dohn√°nyi, dedicated his composition called 'Suite for Two Harps' to Henrik Rohmann. This piece was composed in 2005, at the request of the Hungarian Harp Duo (Ad√©l B√©lyei and M√°ria Gogoly√°k). The parts of the eight-minute piece are: 1. Moto Perpetuo, 2. Dialogue, 3.

Sasha had a 20-year business career in HP. She was Director of Public Sector for the world Growth Markets at Hewlett-Packard. Previously she had managed the Central Eastern Europe Public sector business of the corporation. Before that Sasha was the General Manager of Hewlett-Packard Bulgaria for more than 10 years, positioning the company as the leader in the local ICT market and driving important investment in the country where HP employs today more than 5000 people. Her long list of business achievements and social development engagements throughout the years involve positioning Bulgaria as an ICT center of global significance, boosting the entrepreneurial culture and women empowerment in her home country Bulgaria and at European level.

Early life and education  Sasha Bezuhanova was born in Pernik, Bulgaria. She graduated German language high school in Sofia. Bezuhanova went on to study in Technical University in Sofia graduating with Masters in Electronics (1985). She holds also Executive master's degree in International Negotiations and Policy Making from the Graduate Institute in Geneva (2015) and has Executive qualifications from INSEAD and Stanford. She attended special programs for studying the Irish economic model (Dublin, 2001), the structure of ICT sector in California (Palo Alto, 2002) and European Software Institute (Bilbao, 2003). Aside from her native language Sasha Bezuhanova speaks English, German and Russian.  Career  The professional career of Sasha Bezuhanova started in 1985 in the Central Institute for Computer Technologies where in 1986 she became Research Associate. Shortly after the democratic changes in Bulgaria when the country opened up for direct presence of international businesses she was invited by the German medical concern HELLIGE to head their Bulgarian operation. Under her leadership in the period 1990 to 1994 the company played key role in the modernization of the Bulgarian health infrastructure. Her international business and operational management experience evolved further as General Manager for S&T; Bulgaria, the exclusive distributor of HP ‚Äì a role she took over in 1995. When HP decided to open up direct operation in Bulgaria in 1997 Bezuhanova was appointed as General Manager. Sasha Bezuhanova has managed Hewlett-Packard's business in Bulgaria for more than 10 years. In that period of time HP's Bulgarian team developed a series of IT infrastructure projects for the country's three biggest telecommunication companies, industrial manufacturers, and state and private finance institutions. Some of these projects have been implemented for the first time in Bulgaria and became reference solutions incorporated in the HP's portfolio. Among them was the implementation of electronic ID for Bulgarian citizens, which ended in August 1999 and was the key to Bulgaria's acceptance in the EU visa-free countries list in 2001. Another flagship project, that enriched the HP's worldwide practice, was the implementation of the Real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) in Macedonia. Her most important accomplishment at the time was attracting an important investment of HP in Bulgaria where in 2006 started operation HP Global Delivery Centre. Today it employs more than 5000 high- profile engineers and specialists. That strategic project placed the country on the world IT investment map. As a result, Hewlett-Packard has become the largest IT employer in Bulgaria and the Top 5 in the country overall. Hewlett- Packard became also the largest investor and employer in the Bulgarian IT sector. Sasha Bezuhanova continued her career in HP on international level being appointed in 2008 as Public Sector Director for Central Eastern Europe. She manages the corporation‚Äô government business in 27 countries including Russia, New Europe, Western Balkans and Central Asia bringing in an important strategic dimension and a holistic approach to this market segment.

She founded the non-partisan organization MOVE.BG ‚Äì a platform for collaboration in finding sustainable solutions for the state, economy and society via innovation, participation and co-creation.

Here and there comparisons with the much more elaborate settings which Hollywood would have devised for a picture of this kind are unavoidable, but on the whole the genuine atmosphere and environment of an English country house has been retained; and there is compensation in verisimilitude for what the eye loses in the way of spectacle...Though there is no gainsaying the fact that this picture is full of robustious humor, is pat in dialogue and quick in action for an English offering, there are still times when the onlooker is inclined to suggest \\"getting on with it\\" ;https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E07E0DE173DEE32A25754C0A9609C946094D6CF while more recently, Allmovie wrote, \\" It's Ralph Lynn's show all the way, and he makes the most of every comic opportunity.

Main characters =Battle Force 5= Battle Force 5 are the main protagonists in the series, led by Sage and Vert Wheeler as the field commander. Their headquarters are located in Vert's garage (which features an underground level called \\"The Hub\\"). Each vehicle has an identification modulator, molecular bonding mode, magnetic Battle Key grapplers, and a com-link system, and is powered by a Sentient conversion chip. These chips can be exchanged between cars and can upgrade other vehicles. Sage only has five of these chips, so normally, only five vehicles can operate through a Storm Shock portal (though all seven vehicles can operate at the same time, just not in a Battle Zone). Each member is equipped with a G-Force resistant Battle Suit called a Shocksuit which protects him or her from impact and also contains a communicator and air-con units to keep the driver cool in hot, humid environments. In order to bond with the vehicle, each driver must name it. Primary members * Vert Wheeler (voiced by Mark Hildreth) - Field Commander of the Battle Force 5. Sometime before the series, he and A.J. Dalton were close friends, sharing a love for extreme sports. He's also a fan of Dan Wheldon and an auto racing lover since childhood. After finding his way into a Battle Zone, Vert rescued Sage from the Vandals. She, in exchange, upgrades his vehicle. Vert also wields a sword and has a special pair of sunglasses that function as a computer. Skilled in strategic planning and combat, he is able to focus even under extreme mental or physical distress, channeling energy caused by stress to his benefit rather than hindering him. While always up for a fun time, experience has taught him to take things seriously when the situation demands it. He's a dynamic and understanding individual who retains unwavering trust in his team and a very capable leader. In \\"Unite and Strike,\\" he wins the Sentient war and becomes leader of the Sentient Council of Five at the end of the Second Season. He is the legendary \\"Crimson One\\", the person who will end the war between Blue and Red Sentients. * Agura Ibaden (voiced by Kathleen Barr) - BF5's Special Operations Officer, second in command, and Hunter. The tomboy female and African-American member of Battle Force 5. Her favorite hobby is off-road driving and was brought into BF5 under the pretense of taking part in an off-road race. She finds Stanford very \\"obnoxious\\" and the two get into fights, though this tendency begins to diminish after \\"Cold as Ice.\\" Her pet peeve is being referred to in any way as weak and/or especially helpless. She has excellent tracking and hunting skills, and also possesses formidable hand-to-hand abilities and athleticism, allowing her to defeat even Kyburi. While she can get easily angered when annoyed, she has methods of staying calm and focuses on the task at hand. She apparently has 5 brothers as revealed in \\"The Blue Tide\\"' and a 3 year old nephew in \\"Gladiators.\\" * Sherman and Spinner Cortez (voiced by Brian Drummond and Gabe Khouth) - BF5's Strategic Tactical and Tech Support. Spinner is the older, shorter twin brother, acts immature, and is marked by hacking skills and hand-eye coordination. He's very adept at video games and is able to manipulate computer programs. Sherman is the younger, taller twin brother, is more level- headed, intelligent, and physically stronger. He's shown to have impressive technological and engineering skills and has studied Sentient culture in depth (though not as much as Tezz). Both joined BF5 when they thought they were attending a video game convention. Spinner can also control the other vehicles via remote control as shown in Spawn Hunters.Character Bio for the brothers * Stanford Isaac Rhodes IV (voiced by Noel Johansen) - BF5's Artillery Expert. The oldest team member and part of the British Royal Family, the 189th in line for the throne. He loves to party, but hates the planet Vandal from his experiences there and puzzles are not his strong point. He has an ancestor that once explored the Multiverse and was also very superstitious, as he believes his Great Uncle Stansted comes to haunt a member of the Royal Family every year, until Sage helped him deal with the issue. Due to his royal roots, Stanford tends to be arrogant, isn't used to doing things for himself, and gets insecure when he makes a mistake, though he later learns independence and becomes more reliable as time goes on. He was tricked into coming with a false invitation to a party, but later agrees to becoming a member of BF5. * Zoom Takazumi (voiced by Alessandro Juliani) - BF5's Scout. The youngest team member and a skilled Muay Thai fighter from Bangkok, Thailand. He is athletic, restless, and curious, but is willing to fight for the sake of the Earth. He dislikes ice, cold weather, lectures, and being called \\"kid\\". He also looks up to Vert like an older brother, which led to trouble when he imitates him early on. His helmet is equipped with scanning devices to help in his scouting duties and can be adapted to allow him to breathe underwater. Zoom was originally a chosen guardian from the Order of the Flying Fists, a school of elite martial arts warriors, but he abandoned it for a new life in the outside world. He was brought into the BF5 after accepting what he thought was an invitation to the World's Mixed-Martial Arts Championship. Secondary members * Sage (voiced by Kira Tozer) - A female Blue Sentient, BF5's advisor and leader, and Krytus' twin sister. She can turn into a small dodecahedron to hibernate and happened to be the last Blue Sentient due to an intervention by Rawkus. She can fire an electric shock to stun enemies and levitate. Later, Sage upgrades her systems and gains a \\"human-friendly\\" sense of humor. When her memory was fully restored, she regained the ability to modify Battle Keys (program a Key to take a driver to a different Battle Zone/Planet instead of its programmed Zone). Sage has a weak telepathic link to Krytus, which she uses to track him down, but refrained from communication to prevent him from finding Earth's coordinates. She was unaware that she possessed the lost minds of her race within her subconscious. As Vert, Zoom, and Rawkus were the only ones who knew, they could not tell her this. If she had learned that the minds were there, they would have been released prematurely, and lost forever. In \\"The Crimson One\\" and \\"Blast from the Past,\\" she had sent the BF5 into the past to make certain history unfolded the way it was supposed to. In \\"Better Off Red,\\" it is revealed that Sage is in process of creating a weapon that will be used against an enemy even more dangerous than her brother and the Red Sentients. In \\"Unite and Strike,\\" she is killed by Kyburi, but downloaded her mind into BF5's vehicles, which were then used by BF5 to fight their way through the Red Sentient 5 to eventually restore her race and herself. She later assists in setting up a new peace with the Red Sentients and banished her brother, becoming a member of the Council of Five at the end. * Tezz Volitov (voiced by Noel Johansen) - Joins in The Power of Resistance. A scientific genius of European origin with a Russian accent and expertise in Electromagnetism. Years ago during an experiment, the speed and energy his engine put out created a portal and stranded him on a Red Sentient moon. Honing his knowledge of Sentient culture based on the Data Logshttp://www.battleforce5.com/videos/index.aspx?VideoName=lostcharge he recovered, he fought back against the Red Sark as the sole rebel there. Tezz is brought back to Earth by Stanford, where he receives his suit and vehicle upgrade to assist the team. He also wields a gauntlet which can emit electromagnetic fields and fire EMP blasts, as well as remotely control his vehicle. Tezz has great pride in his intelligence, which tends to make him arrogant and a loner. As a result, it is difficult for him to admit his faults, express his feelings, understand expressions, and work with others. Furthermore, his scientific curiosity often puts him into dangerous situations. Underneath it all, he is a very capable man who accepts the group as his \\"slightly-less intelligent\\" family. He does display a more sensitive side toward others with high intellect, such as the Kharamanos, especially with Tromp. At the end of \\"Rumble in the Jungle,\\" he vows to return Tromp home after leaving him to detonate a bomb. In \\"Unite and Strike,\\" this is apparently achieved as Tromp is seen along with all others after the Blue Sentients are restored. * A.J. Dalton (voiced by Michael Dobson) - First mentioned in \\"Cold as Ice\\" and joins in \\"Deep Freeze.\\" He's a Canadian survival and terrain expert hailing from the Yukon. Before Battle Force 5, he and Vert were close friends. Both have a love for extreme sports, which is evident by A.J.'s energy and enthusiasm. Vert calls him over for help years later in retrieving a Terraforming Pod in the Ice Battle Zone. He is overly- friendly, honest, and optimistic, though he can be wise when need be. He is not very comfortable in hot climates, in contrast to Agura and Zoom. Villains =The Vandals= The Vandals (also called Vandalians) are a race of anthropomorphic tribal animals from the planet Vandal who have also occupied the Blue Sentient planet. Unlike the Sark, the Vandals are driven by aggression and value strength gained through combat above all else. While the Sark conquer worlds, the Vandals loot and vandalize them enslaving their inhabitants for their necessities. The position of Vandal Warlord is decided by a ritual (trial by combat) called Kio Hakoko. Even in everyday life, the slightest insult is settled through fighting. Apparently, they are also very superstitious and often explain unknown things due to sources of magic. Due to their dependence on scavenged Sentient technology and their enslavement of the Kharamanos, their war machines were destroyed in \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\" when a bomb was detonated at their power source, thereby robbing them of their ability to ravage other worlds. Currently with no technology, the only way to access planet Vandal is with a Battle Key. * Captain Kalus (voiced by Colin Murdock) - The liger-like Vandal and Warlord who is the dictator of the planet Vandal. He uses a crossbow mounted on his right arm. He also has a wide assortment of spears, axes, and throwing projectiles. Kalus considers humans and other races inferior and while he rules over the Vandals through fear and intimidation, he does respect and value those who are loyal to his lead. He is also shown to have aquaphobia and gets seasick easily, since he very closely resembles a cat. After the final defeat of the Vandals, Kalus is last seen approaching a captured Grimian with a spear implying that he will do away with him. He has shown extremely good hand-to-hand combat prowess being able to go head to head with Krytus. Kalus' vehicle is a chariot-like vehicle called Fangore. * Krocomodo (voiced by Brian Drummond) - A crocodile-like Vandal who is Kalus' second-in-command. He once planned to overthrow Kalus and take control of the Vandals as leader, but gives up when Kalus discovered his intentions. It was later revealed that his ancestors and Stanford's ancestors started the war between the Vandals and Sentients. Krocomodo is also adaptable to water environments, though not as much as Sever. When Grimian was appointed to his position as second-in-command, Krocomodo was temporarily demoted to third-in-command until Grimian's banishment and eventual execution, thus returning him to second-in-command. His vehicle is Riptile. * Sever (voiced by Colin Murdock) - A shark-like Vandal. Sever has a keen sense of smell which allows him to detect life forms from a mile away, similar to Krocomodo's. However, he isn't very bright, especially since he often thinks about food. So far, he is the only Vandal on the team who has not tried to overthrow Kalus. In the Vandal Ocean, Sever leads a team of shark-beings like himself called the Aqua-Jaws, and can communicate with them using high-pitched screeches similar to a whale. His vehicle is Water Slaughter. * Hatch (voiced by Kathleen Barr) - A cockroach-like Vandal who is arguably the most intellectual of the team. It is shown that he is an expert in making crude electronics as well as poisons and chemicals and is able to perform black magic, which he actually confuses with science and technology. His position is a sorcerer, though most of his 'spells' are actually bits of Sark and Sentient devices he had scavenged. Hatch is capable of creating a magical aura with his antennas that makes him (and others) as he pleases invisible to insects. Hatch is cowardly and sycophantic and will not hesitate to grovel in the event of a new leader, though he does show more loyalty to Kalus. His vehicle is Scarib which is made from the bones of larger creatures, has a scorpion-like stinger, and has grappling cables. * Iguanarox - Former leader of the Vandals who was defeated by Kalus before the events of the series and presumably either dead or exiled. He was only mentioned in \\"Behind Enemy Lines.\\" * Vandal Warriors - Kalus's soldiers. The soldiers seen so far are Felines, Crocodiles, Sharks, Insectoids, and Apes. =The Sark= The Sark are a race of deadly robots from the planet Sark, as well as occupying the Red Sentient planet. Their entire existence is based on logic and the conquest of other worlds. They were created to be an army for the Red Sentients, but Zemerik rebelled against Krytus and took control of the Sark until Krytus was freed from the Krypt Zone. After the events of Get Zemerik, Blue Sark no longer exist. Currently, Red Sark still remain, though no longer aggressive due to the new alliance between the Red and Blue Sentients. It's possible the Red Sentients didn't create the Sark, but merely found the schematics for them because of the existence of a Factory Battle Zone older than the Sentients themselves. Additionally, the Alpha Code and the Old Sark of the Badlands point to a more ancient origin. Considering these facts, it is actually more likely that The Ancient Ones created the Sark. * Zemerik (voiced by Michael Dobson) - The leader of the Sark with an Electric Whip for combat. He also has the ability to turn Red Zurk to his command, though the Red Sentients can turn them back. Zemerik's head can also operate independently when separated from his body. He emphasizes logic and considers organic beings inferior. Originally built to lead a Red Sark Army, in \\"The Crimson One,\\" it is revealed that Zemerik gained free will after Vert was sent back in time and uploaded a virus, which allowed Zemerik to betrayal Krytus, imprison the RS5, and turn the Sark blue. Presently, he has no memory of Vert during that time (possibly due to a side effect of the virus). Zemerik and Zug were the only Sark not under Red Sentient control. In \\"The Blue Tide,\\" they attempted to create a Blue Sark Army resistant to conversion, but the plan failed when the BF5 shut down the Factory Battle Zone that was manufacturing them, thereby forcing Zemerik and Zug back into hiding. In \\"Get Zemerik,\\" he was reprogrammed by a band of Green Zurk, and underwent a radical personality change as well as a slight physical change, which involved his eyes going green and the symbol representing the Alpha Code engraved into his forehead. He then was terminated by Krytus and thrown into a pit. His final fate is undetermined with the appearance of the Old Sark of the Badlands who resurrects the former dictator. Zemerik's vehicle is Zelix. * Zug (voiced by Brian Drummond) - Zemerik's second-in-command. Zug is very strong and has three drill fingers on his left hand, but is somewhat slow-witted. Aside from Zemerik, Zug is the only Sark with free will, and his primary mission is to follow and serve Zemerik, even at the cost of his own existence. Like Stanford, Zug hates the planet Vandal. He was also the first Sark turned blue after Zemerik gains free will. He was deactivated in the Toborian Badlands after being badly damaged by an ion storm and giving his power core to Zemerik, though his body was taken by the Green Zurk and dumped into the pit with his fallen master. His final fate remains to be seen. Zug's vehicle is Zendrill which has a drill in front of it. * Zurk - Common and disposable minions for Zemerik and later Krytus, they make up most of the Sark population. There are 2 types of Zurk: The Humanoid versions that drive the Zentners and the small wheeled versions, or Mini-Zurk, which roll about on their own. Generally, Zurk are mindless and will even destroy themselves if ordered to do so. However, if a Red Sentient is nearby, Zemerik's control over the Zurk is overridden, upon which they turn red and use more aggressive tactics. They speak in a series of beeps and robotic noises, but in one of the webisodes it is revealed that they know the terms \\"Warning\\" and \\"Intruder alert\\". * Sark Sentries - Small flying scout devices that patrol the Sark Homeworld in the first season and patrol for the Red Sentients in the second season. There are larger versions armed with blasters, used for hunting. * Alpha Sark - Discovered in \\"Get Zemerik,\\" these outcast and obsolete green Zurk were banished to the Torborian Badlands by Zemerik long ago. Remarkably, not only were they able to survive there, they even gained intelligence and built a hive-city of their own. They also established a cult that worships something known only as the \\"Alpha-Code\\", which makes them immune to any attempts at conversion by Zemerik and presumably the Red Sentients. They wear cloaks wrapped around their heads like hoods and carry electro-staves. They are also able to speak, and operate individually.  Alpha Code - A corrupt program or virus that turns Sark green, making them Alpha Sark. The affected consider this code \\"enlightenment\\". It first appears in \\"Get Zemerik,\\" where Zemerik (and possibly Zug as well) gets infected by it. It could be possible that it might convert Red or Blue Sentients into Green/Alpha Sentients. * Zorax (voiced by Brian Dobson) - Originally thought to be no more than a myth, this ancient robot appears to be the leader of the Green/Alpha Sark. He is seen at the end of \\"Get Zemerik\\" in the pit Zemerik and Zug were thrown into where he resurrects Zemerik as his new servant. He is the main antagonist of \\"Full Revolution.\\" * Generic Sark - The unnamed Sark seen on their planet come in different colors. The Blue Sark serve the Blue Sentinels, the Red Sark serve the Red Sentinels, the Green Sark serve the Karmordials, the Purple Sark serve the Red Sentinels and the Blue Sentinels, and the Yellow Sark only appear in \\"Blue Tide\\" and resemble Tors-10. =Krytus' Red Sentient 5= Krytus' personal team, which is basically the Red Sentient equivalent of the Battle Force 5. It is possible that Sage had created the BF5 based on the RS5 or was inspired by the events of Blast from the Past. Unlike the rest of the Red Sentient population, they were off-planet during the time Sage had used the Double-Helix Crystals to freeze the Red Sentients. Krytus's team was imprisoned by Zemerik, but later freed by Krytus once he escaped the Krypt Zone. Each member can form his/her own vehicle with special properties similar to BF5's. Their main shared weakness is through breaking their crystal shells and releasing their antimatter energy. Because of this, Krytus made \\"Re-Spawn\\" chambers for him and his team so that if any of them are destroyed, they will revive in them. In Better Off Red, Vert tricked Krytus into revealing how this process is done, and that there could be hidden Blue Sentient Re-Spawn chambers as well. Any one of them can turn Blue Sark into Red ones and override Zemerik's control, however, Zemerik can turn them back. * Krytus (voiced by Brian Drummond) - Leader of the Red Sentient 5, Vert's counterpart, and Sage's twin brother. He once he tried to kill Sage, but was stopped by Rawkus, and as a result, made her the last blue Sentient until her people were restored. Krytus possesses high amounts of strength and has the ability to form blades from his hands. He created Zemerik to lead his army, until Zemerik turned on Krytus and imprisoned him in the Krypt Zone. Due to Zemerik's betrayal, he harbored an intense hatred for his once-loyal creation. Neither he nor the other members of the RS5 seem to remember Vert's involvement in Zemerik's betrayal, though Krytus vaguely remembers the BF5 in Blast from the Past. Because they are twins, Krytus and Sage share a weak telepathic link, which Sage uses to locate him. Though physically stronger, his mental powers are weaker than Sage's. After being forced to work together in \\"Shadow Runners,\\" Krytus admits a grudging respect for Vert and calls him by his name, rather than just \\"human\\". In \\"Get Zemerik,\\" he finally got the chance to terminate Zemerik, but felt cheated out of revenge when Zemerik's new personality \\"forgave\\" him. In \\"Unite and Strike,\\" he destroys a Battle Zone in order to create an intense beta wave, which was capable of not only reaching the Red Sentient homeworld, but also undoing the stasis field that trapped his people, thus freeing them. However, his plans for conquest come to naught as the Blue and Red Sentients, weary of eons of fighting, agree to a new peace and Krytus is forever banished into stasis to a frozen wasteland on a distant planet. His vehicle is Syfurious. * Kytren (voiced by Michael Dobson) - RS5's Scout, Zoom's counterpart, and Sol's twin brother. Unlike the other Red Sentients, he has a tendency to speak in brief sentence fragments, due to his savage nature. In Total Revolution It is revealed that the Red Sentient 5 shared the same fate as Krytus. His vehicle is Vylirex which can drive into the ground and reappear in any location. * Kyburi (voiced by Kathleen Barr) - RS5's Special Operations Officer and Agura's counterpart. Short-tempered and cruel, she is Krytus's First Lieutenant and Hunter. She has the special ability to drain energy from machines and living beings. She is especially antagonistic toward Agura. In Total Revolution It is revealed that the Red Sentient 5 shared the same fate as Krytus. Her vehicle is Venikus which is an all-terrain vehicles with energy-draining \\"fangs\\" on the front and sports a stealth mode. * Krylox (voiced by Colin Murdock) - RS5's Strategic Tactical and Tech Support and counterpart to the Cortez brothers. Krylox is a large, hulking Red Sentient with incredible strength and the ability to duplicate himself. He is brutal, arrogant, and prefers to solve all his problems by smashing things with his fists or his vehicle. His weakness is that if one duplicate is damaged, the other will be damaged in the same place as well. In Total Revolution It is revealed that the Red Sentient 5 shared the same fate as Krytus. His vehicle is Synataur which is a tank-like vehicle that can split apart. * Kyrosys (voiced by Mark Hildreth) - RS5's Artillery Expert and Stanford's counterpart. He is taciturn and very methodical. In Total Revolution It is revealed that the Red Sentient 5 shared the same fate as Krytus. His vehicle is Synthrax. Minions * Tors-10 (voiced by Michael Dobson) - A mysterious, deranged and maniacal Red Sark who was in control of the Colosseum Battle Zone. He lived up in a tower over the arena, from which he conducted tests and experiments. He called himself the \\"design master\\" of a Sark vehicle testing facility. Using a device that stimulates high levels of aggression, he forced the Vandals and the BF5 to fight against each other and their own teammates to determine which of their vehicles' designs was \\"worthy\\" of the superior beings he claimed to represent. He was ultimately destroyed when he initiated the Battle Zone's self-destruct sequence as a last resort. When confiding with Sage about it later, Vert was informed that Tors-10 might only be a minion working for an unknown threat even greater than the Sark and Vandals. This was confirmed to be the Red Sentients, as it was revealed in Legacy that the project was a Red Sentient Mobias Command Center with mobile Re-Spawn Chambers. The project was destroyed by the BF5.  Red Zurk - First seen in \\"Ascent of the Red Sentients Part 2.\\" All Sark, including Zemerik and Zug were red and under the control of the Red Sentients, until Zemerik was turned blue by Sage's virus. With the return of Krytus and the Red Sentient 5, every blue Zurk except for Zemerik and Zug was turned back to red. * Grimian (voiced by Scott McNeil) - A gorilla-like Vandal who first appears in \\"Uprising.\\" A brutal Vandal, he also wants to take over as Vandal Warlord. Unlike Hatch and Krocomodo, he will try to do so at any cost. After Kalus defeated him, he appointed Grimian to second-in-command. However, it turns out that Grimian is secretly working for Krytus. How they allied is revealed in the webisode \\"Secret Alliance.\\" While fighting, Krytus proposed a chance to overthrow Kalus by working with him. Grimian took up the offer as Krytus was choosing whether to spare him from falling over a cliff.http://www.battleforce5.com/videos/index.aspx?VideoName=secretalliance In \\"Grimian's Secret,\\" his treason is revealed to Kalus and he is banished from the Vandal Hordes. However in Rumble in the Jungle, he makes one final alliance with the Red Sentients and rallies those who are loyal to him to start a Vandal civil war. In the end, Grimian is defeated and captured, with his life most likely ended by Kalus himself as Kalus was seen approaching him with a spear in his hand. His vehicle is Prime Evil. The Ancient Ones They were first mentioned in Better Off Red, referred to in that episode as the \\"Greater Enemy\\" and that Sage is constructing a weapon that will be used against them. But in \\"Unite and Strike!,\\" they were referred to by name by Rawkus, who asked Battle Force 5 to ride with him to combat them into darkness. As shown by constellations at the end of the episode: one of them looks like a dragon, one looks like an Octopus, one looks like he is made out of fire or ice, and one looks like a huge gargoyle. Due to the series' cancellation, the true appearance of the Ancient Ones was never revealed until the \\"Full Revolution\\" movie. Other characters * Negative Kalus - Appears in \\"Double Down.\\" Good opposite of the original Captain Kalus from a parallel universe. His armor is white and new-looking, instead of grey and battle- scarred. He also carries his crossbow on his left arm. Unlike his counterpart, he upholds honor in a much higher regard and will not kill an unarmed opponent. He fights as a loner as the good versions of Hatch, Krocomodo and Sever were killed by the evil version of the BF5. * Zen (voiced by Kathleen Barr) - Debuts in \\"The Chosen One.\\" A student of the Order of the Flying Fists, he at first comes to try to get Zoom to go back to the Order, but allows him to stay following a successful Battle Key run. He later returns in \\"Mouth of the Dragon\\" once he learns of the rift that connected Earth to the Red Sentient planet. He later makes an appearance with Tromp at the end of \\"Unite and Strike.\\" * Rawkus (voiced by Mark Acheson) - Debuts in \\"Stone Cold Warrior.\\" A gigantic stone elemental with no allegiance to good or evil. He has massive strength, durability, and wields a sickle which has total control over rock. He also has limited powers of space and time manipulation that he only uses in extreme emergencies. He is known as the Eternal Equalizer, whose mission is to maintain the balance of the Multiverse by making certain that no one faction dominates it completely. It was because of him that Sage was saved from her brother and became the last Blue Sentient until her people were restored. He is powered by his Power Core Stone, but can use a Sentient Chip in an emergency. He has also met with Master Takeyasu. He later brings Vert and Zoom to the Shadow Zone in order to have them find the lost Blue Sentient minds and eventually restore the balance of the Multiverse. He also appears in \\"Blast from the Past\\" as the referee in the ancient Sentient gladiatorial games. In \\"Unite and Strike,\\" he provided the coordinates to the Blue Sentient Shells and instigated the events that led to the Blue/Red Sentient Alliance, thereby maintaining the balance. At the end of the episode, he watches the Battle Force 5 from a distance and commends them for restoring the balance of the Multiverse. He then talks about how the Battle Force 5 will face even greater challenges in the near future as well as the coming of the 'Ancient Ones'. * Dan Wheldon (voiced by himself) - Debuts in Full Throttle. A pro racer and Indy 500 champion, Dan was trying to perfect a maneuver called the 1260 ricochet on the BF5's test track, but was later recruited to help destroy a Red Sentient scanner. As a kid Dan always wanted to fight aliens and Vert relates with wanting to race in a race car. At the end of the episode, he was given a communicator by Sage and was made an honorary member of the BF5. After Dan Wheldon was killed in a crash during the IZOD IndyCar World Championship race in Las Vegas on October 16, 2011, the television film \\"Full Revolution\\" was dedicated in his memory. * Negative BF5 - Appear in \\"Double Down.\\" Evil opposites of the original primary members of BF5 from a parallel universe. They each have their Sentient ranking symbols painted below their left eye. * Shadow Speeders - Debut in \\"The Shadow Zone.\\" Lost Multiverse travelers who remained in the Shadow Zone too long and became mindless shadow raiders. Their only purpose is to trap and transform living beings into Shadow Speeders. They are able to move about by defying normal laws of physics and constant contact with them will eventually turn anyone into another Shadow Speeder. Staying within the Shadow Zone too long will also cause a gradual transformation and they can only be destroyed temporarily. They speak in high-pitched hisses and screeches. Sentients Sentients are highly evolved energy lifeforms that created the Battle Zones, the Battle Keys, and the Multiverse many years ago. There are two factions, Blue and Red. Blue Sentients such as Sage are benevolent, while Red Sentients like Krytus are destructive. =Blue Sentients= The Blue Sentients are a benevolent race of highly-generated energetic aliens who created the Multiverse. After their world was taken over by the Vandals, the Blue Sentient Council of Five downloaded the knowledge of their civilization into Data Logs and spread them throughout the Multiverse. Thanks to the efforts of the BF5, they are reborn at the end of the second season and have charted a new peace with the Red Sentients. * Boralis (voiced by Michael Dobson) - An ally of Sage who assigned his servant, Quardian, to collect several hundred Blue Sentient shells before dying, so that they may someday be reunited with their minds. In \\"Unite and Strike,\\" he is revived, and is shown to be different from his shell. He appears to be missing an eye, and has two horns on his head, making it look like he is wearing a helmet. * Sol (voiced by Michael Dobson) - First and only appeared in \\"Sol Survivor.\\" Sage's mentor and one of the original members of the Blue Sentient Council of Five. He is also Kytren's twin. After a brutal interrogation from Krytus, Sol was badly damaged while escaping into a deep hibernation mode. The BF5 unknowingly doomed him when he was revived, destroying his ability to recharge. An attempt to use Kytren's Re-Spawn Chamber failed with Sol perishing in a trap, but he left behind his genetic makeup and memories with Sage, indicating that he may be revived. =Red Sentients= The Red Sentients are the war-like \\"twin race\\" to the Blue Sentients. Most of the populace was in stasis, but at the end of Rumble in the Jungle, Krytus' team found a way to unfreeze them. However, due to their weariness to the war and their desire to end the fighting, they agree to a new peace with the restored Blue Sentient Race. * General Kromax - A deceased Red Sentient General who was known for ambush tactics. Krytus and Kyburi used his name as part of a secret code. =Diads= The Diads are artificial silicon beings created to serve the Sentients: * Praxion Diad (voiced by Mark Hildreth) - First and only appears in \\"Axis of Evil\\" Pt. 2. A Diad who appeared to be the only survivor on the Blue Sentient home world. Though seemingly on the side of the Blue Sentients, he turns out to be a traitor gone mad, and frees Krytus from the Krypt Zone. After BF5 returns to Earth, Praxion is dropped off of a cliff by Krytus, who had no further use for him. * Quardian Diad (voiced by G. Khouth) - First appears in \\"Found!...And Lost.\\" The Diad servant of Boralis. Boralis' dying command was for Quardian to gather Blue Sentient shells and hide them away, so they will one day be resurrected. While searching for more shells, Quardian is kidnapped by Kyburi and taken back to the Red Sentient planet as a servant. Before he is made to tell Krytus of his mission, the Battle Force 5 rescue him. He is sent back to continue his mission, while Sage erases the memories of the BF5 and her own of Quardian's location and identity in order to protect Quardian's secret. He is seen again in \\"Unite and Strike,\\" when BF5 came to him so they could download the Blue Sentient minds from Sage's mind into his collection of Blue Sentient shells.

History TNMU was founded on 12 April 1957 as a Ternopil Medical Institute. On July 1, 1992, the institute was named after Ivan Horbachevsky. On December 30, 1997, it received the status of State Medical Academy, and on 17 November 2004, after reorganization, the institution became Ivan Horbachevsky Ternopil State Medical University. The first rector of the medical institute was Petro Ohii, and the vice-rector Arsen Martyniuk. The regional administration transferred ownership of two buildings to the institute for the use as academic and laboratory facilities, and two dormitories. University clinic facilities were located in the municipal hospital. At the same time, the Morphology Building, a dormitory, and the Regional Hospital were being built. The institute had 19 departments, and employed 66 instructors, among them Kostiantyn Kovanov, Rostyslav-Yurii Komarovskyi, Anatolii Lokai, Ivan Sytnyk, Mykola Skakun, and Yevhen Honcharuk. The first class consisted of 210 students. The institute steadily developed programs and facilities, but the biggest change took place after Ukraine has gained its independence in 1991, when the school started moving towards the European system of education. In 1994, the Institute received IV level of institutional accreditation. In 1995 TSMU added the specialty of Nursing, and in 2000 Pharmacy. As of 2016, the university offers Bachelor's level programs in Physical rehabilitation and Nursing; Master's level programs in Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry and Nursing; and Ph.D. level programs in specialties Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry and Biology.

A Tasmanian, Harrison was just 17 when he was picked up by Carlton in the 1992 AFL Draft. He served a long apprenticeship before finally making his senior debut in 1995. His two games in 1995 were the only times he was able to break into the Carlton side, with the club forming such a strong 21 that they would go on to win the premiership that year.AFL Tables: Ben Harrison After taking home the reserve's \\"Best and Fairest\\" award in 1995, he joined his childhood friend Matthew Richardson at Richmond for the 1996 season, having been traded for Justin Murphy. He only played eight games in his first season with Richmond but was a regular member of the team in 1997. In the final round of the home and away season, Harrison kicked the winning goal in a two-point win over Carlton. The result meant that his former club would miss the finals for the first time since 1992 and it would be the last game that their captain Stephen Kernahan played in the AFL. During both the 1997 and 1998 seasons, Harrison spent some time up forward and kicked four goals on three occasions. He was however primarily a key defender, also used as a half back flanker and on the wing. One of only three Richmond footballers to play in all 22 games in 1998, Harrison had perhaps his best league season. He took 114 marks, the second most by a player from his club, kicked 15 goals and averaged just under 19 disposals a game. Harrison also secured five Brownlow Medal votes and finished fourth in the Jack Dyer Medal count. In 1999 he was restricted by a hamstring injuries and didn't play until round nine, but then didn't miss a game for the rest of the year. He added another 14 games the following season and was then on the trading table once again, swapped to the Western Bulldogs for the 41st pick of the 2000 AFL Draft, which was used on Andrew Krakouer. He played 82 of a possible 88 games from 2001 to 2004. A knee injury kept him out of the seniors for much of 2005 and he retired at the end of the year.

This earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 6.8 and 6.4. The earthquake triggered a coral reef platform collapse and a submarine landslide that caused a tsunami. Eight people were reported killed; a wharf, bridges, and buildings were severely damaged in Suva.  Tectonic setting  Fiji lies in a complex tectonic setting along the boundary between the Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate. Southwards from Fiji the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Australian Plate along the Tonga Trench forming the Tonga Ridge island arc system and the Lau Basin back-arc basin. To the southwest of Fiji the Australian Plate is subducting beneath the Pacific Plate forming the Vanuatu Ridge island arc system and the North Fiji back-arc basin. Hence, the region has undergone a complex process of plate convergence, subduction, and arc volcanism from the Middle Eocene to the Early Pliocene. Many of the larger islands, such as Viti Levu, are of volcanic origin. Volcanism still exists, and there are Holocene volcanos in Fiji. The Fiji Platform lies in a zone bordered with active extension fault lines around which most of the shallow earthquakes were centered. These fault lines are the Fiji Fracture Zone (FFZ) to the north, the 176¬∞ Extension Zone (176¬∞E EZ) to the west, and the Hunter Fracture Zone (HFZ) to the east.  Earthquake  The earthquake lasted between 25 and 30 seconds and had an estimated magnitude of 6.75 on the surface wave magnitude scale. The calculated focal mechanism is consistent with slightly oblique dextral (right lateral) strike-slip on a NW-SE trending fault plane, matching the orientation of other fault planes measured in the area and a marked bathymetric lineament. The fault parameters calculated for the earthquake are a length of 30 km, a width of 27 km and a slip of one metre. The NW trending nodal plane of this earthquake coincides with the strike of the NW trending Naqara Fault on the southeast coast of Viti Levu.  Tsunami  The first sign of the tsunami was observed about one minute after the earthquake when a disturbance of the sea surface was noticed by the captain of the cutter Adi Tirisa \\"beyond the reef some 4 to 5 miles southwest of Suva‚Ä¶she was badly shaken and a little later three great spouts burst out of the sea, carrying mud, stones, and part of a long-wrecked vessel‚Ä¶\\" The location of this disturbance was at the western end of the entrance to the Suva Passage. = Origin = From the type of fault displacement and the magnitude of the event it was clear that the tsunami was not caused by any displacement of the seabed associated with the earthquake. The shaking triggered collapse of part of the barrier reef at Suva into the Suva Canyon. The current reef edge shows the effects of repeated slope failure. The characteristics of the 1953 landslide scar were investigated using a high resolution multibeam echo sounder. The area immediately offshore from the reef is a composite failure surface, within which a fresh scar was identified with a width of 800 m, defining an estimated slide volume of 60 million cubic metres. Numerical modelling of this as the likely source was able to reproduce many aspects of the observed development of the tsunami.  Damage  This earthquake was the most destructive in Fiji's recorded history, the tremor itself killing three people and seriously injuring twenty others. The most serious damage occurred in the southeastern part of Viti Levu. The tsunami caused particular damage to coastal areas not protected by barrier reefs, devastating the villages of Nakasaleka and Makaluva. There were five deaths from the tsunami, three at Suva and two at Nakasaleka. Had the tsunami occurred at high tide, rather than low tide it would have been more damaging. The landslide that caused the tsunami generated turbidity currents that damaged several underwater cables in the Suva Canyon. The total damage caused by earthquake and tsunami was estimated as $500,000 (at 1953 values in U.S. dollars).

Political career  Ehrenreich joined COSATU in 1989, raising to become its National Deputy General-Secretary from 1999 to 2001. He represented COSATU at the World Trade Organization in Doha, International Confederation of Labour Trade Committee in Geneva; Organization of African Trade Union Unity in Ghana, and Unions Bi-lateral with French Trade Unions in Paris. Ehrenreich was nominated by COSATU as the 2011 mayoral candidate for the African National Congress (ANC) in the City of Cape Town in the 2011 municipal elections. Ehrenreich lost to the Democratic Alliance mayoral candidate, Patricia De Lille. He is now the leader of the opposition in the Cape Town City Council where he is a member of Economic, Environmental and Spatial Planning Portfolio committee. Ehrenriech is a supporter of mixed- income housing and believes that the primary responsibility of government is to prioritise the needs of the poor first. He donates most of his income to charitable causes through an independent board of trustees.  Controversial statements  = White civil servants = In April 2014 the Anton Alberts of the Freedom Front Plus referred to Ehrenreich as a \\"racist clown\\" for a statement Ehrenreich made that if the COSATU-aligned ANC were to gain power in the Western Cape more than half of the white senior civil servants in the provincial government to be sacked to make way for civil servants of other ethnic groups based on the ANC's affirmative action policies. = South African Jewish Board of Deputies and Israel = During the height of the violence in the Israeli-Palestinian Gaza crisis of 2014, Ehrenreich was accused by South African Jewish Board of Deputies chairperson Mary Kluk of inflaming tensions in South Africa when he issued a Cosatu press release informing the South African Jewish Board of Deputies that it had until 7 August to stop advancing a \\"Zionist agenda\\" in South Africa. Ehrenreich warned that should they fail to do so Cosatu would boycott and call strikes at all of their member ‚Äì and supporting companies and organisations. Some time later, just before the lapse of the second 72-hour ceasefire between Hamas and Israel on 13 August 2014, Tony Ehrenreich stated on his Facebook page that \\"The time has come to say very clearly that if a woman or child is killed in Gaza, then the Jewish board of deputies, who are complicit, will feel the wrath of the People of SA with the age old biblical teaching of an eye for an eye. The time has come for the conflict to be waged everywhere the Zionist supporters fund and condone the war killing machine of Israel .\\" In response, the Jewish Board of Deputies released a statement indicating they will be initiating civil and criminal charges against Ehrenreich for \\"hate speech and incitement to violence\\".Incitement to violence against Jewish leaders threatens Democracy Doron Isaacs of Equal Education and Zackie Achmat of the Treatment Action Campaign, both outspoken critics of Israeli actions in Gaza, criticized Ehrenreich's call of an 'eye for an eye'. Isaacs stated that it was \\"idiotic and against the traditions of Cosatu\\" whilst Achmat wrote in a Twitter post that it was \\"[u]nlawful, wrong & harms #Palestine'.\\" = Tweets = Ehrenreich has been criticised by Business Day columnist Gareth Van Onselen for his combative and insulting Twitter messages targeting the Democratic Alliance's leader Helen Zille and mayor of Cape Town Patricia de Lille. His comments have been described by Van Onselen as \\"deep and hostile myopia\\" that is counter productive to increasing the appeal of the ANC amongst voters in the Western Cape.

Gordon and the lady visit all the passengers in the railway carriage. One of them is Steve Harding, handcuffed to police officer Peterson. Harding is to appear in court the next day, charged with the murder of a young woman. The other passengers are a broker, an engineer, a woman and a young man. All of them, in one way or another, have a connection with Harding. The ticket collector has been knocked out by an assailant who has taken his uniform coat and posed as him. Two female stowaways are hiding in the guard's van. It is determined that the scream they heard came from another police officer, who was also escorting Harding. The passengers leave the train at a junction (hence the title). They gather at a deserted railway station, where officer Peterson is shot and killed, enabling Harding to be released by accomplices.

Nikola Pushkarov was born on December 14, 1874 in Pirdop, then in the Ottoman Empire. He graduated from elementary school in his hometown and high school in Sofia. Afterwards Pushkarov taught as a teacher in Mirkovo. In the period 1898-1901 he studied natural sciences at the Sofia University. Later he taught in the Bulgarian High School in Skopje, where he became a member of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO). In 1902 he received a task from Gotse Delchev to reinforce the Skopje Revolutionary Region. As a result, Pushkarov was elected as a president of the Skopje Revolutionary Committee of IMRO in 1902. Pushkarov was also the editor of the IMRO organizational newsletter in Skopje, \\"Freedom or death\\". As a whole the revolutionary network, in Skopje Region was not well developed and the lack of weapons was a serious problem. On the other hand, in some areas, as in Kumanovo, the strong pro-Serbian propaganda gained support, and other districts, as Kratovo, were under the control of the Supremists. Before the start of the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 Pushkarov had on his disposal an armed detachment of 18 people, which carried 100 kilograms of dynamite and 200 bombs. At the outbreak of the uprising Pushkarov was a chief of the rebel forces in the Skopje Region. On July 22, the band of Pushkarov settled in the Monastery \\"St. John\\", near the village of Vetarsko, close towhere the river Pchinya flows into Vardar. From there the cheta could control the traffic on the railway. The detachment moved from the monastery to the village of Novachene and on August 1, they derailed a military train with 32 carriages.–ò–ª–∏–Ω–¥–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ-–ü—Ä–µ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ –≤—ä—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ 1903‚Äî1968, –û—Ç–≥. —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä–∏: –î–∏–Ω–æ –ö—å–æ—Å–µ–≤ –∏ –õ–∞–º–±–∏ –î–∞–Ω–∞–∏–ª–æ–≤, —Å—Ç—Ä. 145-146. On 3 and 5 August respectively, they attacked a Turkish unit, guarding the bridge on the Vardar river and gave a battle in the \\"St. John\\" monastery. In the next few days the band was pursued by numerous Bashibozuks and moved slowly to Bulgaria, because it carried the wounded rebels with it. On August 20 the band runs through Vranje in Kyustendil. Nicola Pushkarov formed a new band there, which went into Macedonia again. The cheta moved to Kriva Palanka and in October after a battle in Prelesiya returned to Bulgaria. After the uprising Pushkarov returned to Bulgaria. As he could no longer return to Skopje, as the Turkish police actively sought him, he worked as a teacher in Plovdiv, Sofia and Vidin. Later he devoted himself to scientific work. He dealt with the study of the soil types and created the first soil map of Bulgaria in 1931. Pushkarov died on February 18, 1943 in Sofia.

According to notes of Seyyah Kandemir published by the governorate of Ankara in 1932, the lake was named after a Turkmen tribe named Eym√ºr.  Geography  The lake is about south of the Ankara city center within the secondary municipality of G√∂lba≈üƒ± at about . The southern shore lies along the ring road of Ankara. The altitude of the water surface with respect to sea level is about . The shape of the lake roughly resembles the letter S. The lake has a surface area of . The length of the lake is approximately , the average width is about . and the circumferential length is about . The deepest point is at (dry season) with an average depth of the lake at (dry season) and (wet season).Bathymetry and Bottom Sediments of Lake Eymir, South of Ankara  Geology  The lake is an alluvial set lake. The main water input is a channel from the nearby Lake Mogan, some at the south west. When the level of Lake Eymir increases beyond a certain level, the extra water is discharged to the River ƒ∞mrahor. During the flood in 1910, Lake Mogan and Lake Eymir temporarily merged. Near history  According to 1930 travel notes of Nahit Sƒ±rrƒ± √ñrik the area surrounding the lake was arid land devoid of any green plantation. In 1956, land including Lake Eymir was allocated to the Middle East Technical University () campus. Now ODT√ú is the only university in Turkey with a lake in the campus area. Immediately after 1956, the first rector of the university Kemal Kurda≈ü began a forestation project around the lake. Now most of the once-barren land is a pine forest. In 1995, Kemal Kurdas and Alattin Egemen, director of reforestation of the Middle East Technical University, shared the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for the re-forestation work done on 45 km2 area of Middle East Technical University including Lake Eymir and surroundings.  Access  The lake has two entrances to the east and west, and it is open to public. Only cars with a special permit are admitted inside the lake area in order to eliminate the pollution and risk of traffic accidents. However the parking lots located near both entrances are free for use. For public use, there is a transportation services at the door to recreational areas.

Payday loans is often used as a term by members of the public (and commentators) generically to refer to all forms of High-cost Short-term credit (HCSTC) including instalment loans, e.g. 3-9 month products, rather than just loans provided until the next pay day. Shop window in Aberdeen August 2012 APR of 1410.33% Market Overview The provision of Payday (HTSTC) loans is overseen by the UK‚Äôs Financial Conduct Authority. FCA data sizes the UK market, in the twelve months to 2018, at 5.4 million loans per year. This is a significant reduction from in 2013, before FCA regulation of the sector, when the market was c. 10million loans a year. In terms of value the FCA sizes the market with consumers borrowing c. 1.3bn a year, making the average loan size c. ¬£250. The market is concentrated. In 2018 the FCA identified 88 firms providing loans however 85% of loans were provided by just ten players. Since that time a number of key players have left the market. This includes Wonga, Enova (trading as Quickquid and Onstride), Dollar (Moneyshop, Payday Express, Payday UK), Curo/Cash euro net (trading as Wageday Advance). As at April 2020 the largest players left in the market were Sunny and Lending Stream. Other lenders include Mr Lender, Money boat and My Jar. The large players, including Sunny and Lending Stream, are members of the trade association, The Consumer Finance Association.  Customer profile  In 2018 the FCA published their financial lives research. This gave insight into customers of different product types (among other segmentations). From this research, Payday loan and installment loan customers tend to be younger overindexing in the 25-34 year old agegroup. They are less likely to have a degree however are not necessarily low income, overindexing in the ¬£30-50k range. Regulation Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 lenders must have a licence from the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to offer consumer credit. The Consumer Credit Act 2006 explicitly requires the OFT to consider irresponsible lending in its evaluation of whether a lender is fit to hold a licence.Damon Gibbons, Neha Malhotra, and Richard Bulmore (2010), Centre for Responsible Credit, Payday lending in the UK: a review of the debate and policy options , October 2010 There are currently no restrictions on the interest rates payday loan companies can charge or on rolling over loans, however the government is pending new legislation to cap the costs of such loans. Advertising of payday lending is subject to the Consumer Credit (Advertisements) Regulations 2004. This means that the \\"typical APR\\" must be stated in adverts which meet certain criteria, such as adverts which indicate that credit will be given to customers who may otherwise find access to credit restricted.OPSI (2004), section 8. Advertising is regulated by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), and there have been several cases of the ASA upholding complaints against advertising by payday lenders. In June 2010 the OFT published a \\"review of high-cost credit.\\"Office of Fair Trading, June 2010, Review of high-cost credit In this report they concluded that changes could be made to the industry itself, but that \\"more radical approaches would be required if the Government or others wanted to tackle the wider social, economic and financial context in which high-cost credit markets exist.\\" To get a good idea of the size and range of payday loan companies operating in the UK, comparison sites are a useful tool, as recommended in the OFT report - \\"We recommend that the Government works with industry groups to provide information on high-cost credit loans to consumers through price comparison websites. If this cannot be undertaken on a voluntary basis, the Government should consider the case for introducing legislation to create a single website allowing consumers to compare the features of home credit, payday and pawnbroking loans alongside credit unions and other lenders in their local area.\\" In March 2013 the OFT published a long-awaited update regarding the industry. It was very critical, giving the 50 leading lenders just 60 days to address the issues raised or risk losing their licences. In particular, it cited \\"a failure to work out whether people could afford the loans, aggressive debt collection practices, a failure to explain how repayments are collected, and a lack of sufficient forbearance for those who cannot afford the repayments.\\" It referred the market to the Competition Commission for \\"deep-rooted problems in how payday loan companies compete\\" in 2015 the Financial conduct authority introduced new restrictions on payday loans in the UK. These rules introduced three key points of regulation: # An interest rate cap of 0.8% per day - Lowering the cost for most borrowers. For all high-cost short-term credit loans, interest and fees must not exceed 0.8% per day of the amount borrowed. # Fixed default fees capped at ¬£15 - Protecting borrowers struggling to repay. If borrowers do not repay their loans on time, default charges must not exceed ¬£15. Interest on unpaid balances and default charges must not exceed the initial rate. # Total cost cap of 100% - Protects borrowers from escalating debts. Borrowers must never have to pay back more in fees and interest than the amount borrowed. Advertising =Google= Google declared that as of 13 July 2016, advertising of payday loans would no longer be possible however this implementation was limited in the UK. While in some countries the new search policy prevented ads for loans with an annual percentage or 36% or more, in th UK the only limitation was banning ads with a repayment period of 60 days or less from the date of issue. This implementation meant that, while loans of one or two months were not advertised, a number of lenders moved into installment loans of 3-12 months duration as an alternative to payday loans. Brokers Until new FCA regulations was enforced on the industry in 2015, the brokers used to include a broker fee, which was often payable upfront; meaning the applicant must have paid a fee merely to apply for an advertised loan, in addition to the high rate of interest. The OFT has urged the government to tighten restrictions on payday loans.  Criticism  There has been considerable criticism of the short-term loans market in the UK. Vince Cable MP said in 2008 that \\"the growing popularity of these kinds of short- term loans highlights the problems stemming from the credit crunch and unsustainable levels of personal debt in the UK.\\"Between August 2007 and June 2008, the number of loans made grew by 130%. Chris Tapp of debt charity Credit Action said in mid-2008: \\"Over the past year, payday loans have become an issue in the UK, and the growth in people who have such a loan and have problems has been notable in the last six months.\\" Credit Action made a complaint to the OFT that payday lenders were placing advertisements on social network website Facebook which broke advertising regulations. Its main complaint was that the APR was either not displayed at all or not displayed prominently enough, which is clearly required by UK advertising standards. In 2010 a campaign organised by pressure group Compass to \\"end legal loan sharking\\" and apply interest rate caps in the \\"high cost credit sector\\" saw over 200 MPs sign an Early Day Motion by April 2011.House of Commons, 6 September 2010, Early day motion 660: LOAN SHARKS, accessed 7 April 2011. Other motions on the subject have been made in previous years,House of Commons, 31 March 2008, Early day motion 1280: ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CREDITHouse of Commons, 29 March 2010, Early day motion 1194: 2,356 PER CENT. PAYDAY LOANS CAMPAIGN and groups such as Debt on our Doorstep have previously highlighted the issue. The writer Carl Packman has criticised the regulation of the industry. Packman says: \\"given the regulatory landscape currently in force we have to trust [lenders] on their word that they follow a self- defeating business model ... Indeed payday lenders break their promise on responsible lending all the time.\\"Packman, Carl: \\"Loan Sharks: The Rise and Rise of the Payday Lenders\\" (Cambridge: Searching Finance, 2012) , p. 62 The widely criticized payday lender Wonga.com was one of the biggest finance firms in Britain. Wonga has faced widespread criticism over its interest rates, allegedly heavy-handed debt collection methods and its ¬£24 million shirt sponsorship deal with Newcastle United football club that some say will tempt impressionable young fans to get into debt. Another concern over evidence it had allowed children to borrow cash. Although under-18s are banned from taking out loans with the firm, young people are finding ways to convince Wonga‚Äôs \\"automated, real-time risk and decision system\\" that they are eligible for its 4,214 percent APR loans.Simon Read, 8 October 2012 Payday loans firms raided by watchdog In 2012 the company became the target of identity thieves, with hundreds of cases of UK individuals being chased by the company for repayment of loans they have never applied for. In 2013 payday broker Cash Lady was widely criticised over an advertising campaign which featured Kerry Katona. Following complaints to the ASA in May 2013, Cash Lady adverts were re-edited to remove the phrase 'Fast Cash for Fast Lives'. The ASA believed this implied that payday loans would help fund a high-flying celebrity lifestyle. In July 2013, Katona declared bankruptcy for the second time, and was dropped by Cash Lady. One month later the ASA ruled that Cash Lady could no longer use Katona in adverts, as she was too heavily associated in people's minds with debt. In January 2014 247Moneybox along with other payday lenders was accused by the consumer group Which? of using \\"excessive\\" default fees to cut their headline rates of interest. Which? Found that \\"Ten of 17 leading payday lenders we looked at have default fees of ¬£20 or more, and four charged ¬£25 and above\\". Since January 2015 the FCA have capped default fees that can be charged for a missed payment to ¬£15 and that the total amount a borrower has to repay cannot exceed 100% of the amount borrowed, inclusive of all fees and interest.

During his tenure within the CSL he won three CSL Championships and two Croatian World Club Championship.  Playing career  Herrera began his career in his native Argentina with Defensa y Justicia in the Primera B Nacional in 2000, where he would appear in a total of 10 matches and two goals recorded. In 2003, he went abroad to Chile to play with Provincial Osorno of the Primera B de Chile. In 2003, he signed a contract with Canadian side Brampton Hitmen of the Canadian Professional Soccer League. He made his debut match for the franchise on July 20, 2003 against Toronto Croatia, where he contributed with a goal which resulted in a 5-0 victory for Brampton. He had a great debut season in the CPSL recording six goals in eight matches, and clinching a postseason berth for club by finishing second in the Western Conference. In the postseason he featured in the quarterfinal match against Toronto Croatia, which resulted in a victory for Toronto, but was later overruled due to Toronto Croatia fielding an illegal player. In the following playoff match he scored the lone goal for Brampton in a 1-1 draw with London City, the game went to penalties and Herrera successfully converted his penalty kick, and the Hitmen advanced to the finals in a 5-3 victory in penalties. In the finals Brampton faced Vaughan Sun Devils, and the match concluded in a 1-0 victory for the club, marking the organizations first CPSL Championship. After a four-year tenure with the Brampton franchise, Herrera signed with league giants Toronto Croatia for the 2007 season. He would record his first goal for Toronto on June 1, 2007 in a match against London City in a 1-1 draw. That same season Toronto Croatia entered the Croatian World Club Championship, where Herrera contributed a goal in a 9-1 victory over Croatia Essen. Croatia would end up winning the tournament in a 3-1 victory over Canberra FC. For the remainder of the season he helped Toronto achieve a 21-game undefeated streak, and reached the postseason by finishing second in the International Division. In the playoffs Toronto reached the finals where they faced arch rivals the Serbian White Eagles FC in a two-game final, where Croatia would end up claiming the CSL Championship in a 4-1 victory in goals on aggregate.

It is one of the fifteen indigenous horse \\"breeds of limited distribution\\" recognised by the AIA, the Italian breeders' association. Although it should never exceed at the withers, it is officially termed a cavallo or horse, and not a pony. Characteristics According to the breed standard, a Sarcidano Horse may be black, bay, or grey; other coat colours are excluded from registration. The height range for males is , the girth and the cannon circumference ; for females the height measures , the girth and the cannon . Horses over at 30 months may not be registered. The head is rather heavy and roughly set on, the profile straight, the ears mobile and the eyes and nostrils large. The neck is muscular, the mane thick. The shoulder is fairly straight, the withers high and the croup short but muscular. The legs are short, strong and reasonably well conformed, the joints are broad, the hooves are strong but tend to be cylindrical. The action is lively and sure-footed. The Sarcidano Horse has a lively and responsive nature, and adapts well to equestrian uses; it is frugal and resistant. Supernumerary premolars are frequently present on both sides of the upper jaw. History The Sarcidano horse appears to have ancient Spanish ancestry in common with the Andalusian horse. Studies by Valiati (1997) and by Bell (1999) of transferrins are reported to confirm common ancestry with the Iberian horse of 25000 years ago. A 1996 study of protease inhibitor polymorphism concludes that \\"a genetic correlation could be present between Sarcidano Horses and ancient Spanish horses as reported by historical documents about horse breeding in Sardinia\\". The \\"constant\\" presence of the seventh molar in the upper jaw is cited as evidence of ancient origin by Baccino, who notes that this characteristic is shared by only a few ancient breeds such as the Exmoor Pony and the Caspian horse; Baccino also notes the presence in the Sarcidano horse of an allele otherwise seen only in Przewalski's Horse. In 1999 a group of 15 Sarcidano horses was acquired by the comune of Laconi from a private owner; this herd lives in the state-owned forest of Funtanamela, on the Sarcidano plateau, and in 2006 numbered approximately 100 horses. A second herd, privately owned, also lives in the same area, while a third group is held by the Istituto di Incremento Ippico della Sardegna (Sardinian horse-breeding institution) of Ozieri, at Foresta Burgos in central northern Sardinia. In 2007, the total Sarcidano horse population was approximately 190, of which 78 were mares. The Sarcidano horse was recognised as a breed by Ministerial Decree No. 24347, dated 5 November 2003; the breed register was established in 2005, and is held by the Associazione Provinciale Allevatori (regional breeders' association) of Nuoro. Use No use of the Sarcidano horse is documented. In 2001 the possibility of starting a few horses for use in trekking was being considered.

Baaij (24 March 1921 ‚Äì 31 January 2012) was a Dutch bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in South Africa. At the time of his death, he was the oldest bishop belonging to his religious congregation. Biography Baaij was born in Rotterdam into a non-Catholic home. He was introduced to the Catholic faith as a young man, and immediately felt called to become a priest. His parents allowed him to take catechism classes and to be received into the Catholic Church. Still feeling a draw to the ministry, he explored entering the minor seminary of the local diocese, but found that the tuition was beyond his family's means. By chance, he encountered a member of the Congregation of the Priests of the Sacred Heart and entered their seminary. He persevered and was ordained a priest on 20 July 1947. After this, Baaij was sent to France where he did language studies in preparation for service in French Canada, where he also worked as a hospital chaplain, which proved to be a ministry he enjoyed. He was sent to Canada in 1949 and was initially assigned to teach in a minor seminary of the congregation in Delaware, Ontario. He became a Canadian citizen in 1955. Two years later, he was sent to work in the United States. Due to his lack of a proper visa to work there, however, he was asked to serve, instead, in South Africa. The country had been entrusted to the German Province of his congregation by the Holy See in 1923 for the implantation of the Catholic faith, and the American Province had just begun to share in this work in 1948. When Baaij arrived in South Africa in March 1957, apartheid was in full force, forbidding any racial mixing among the population. As a result, the parish in Middelburg, Eastern Cape, to which he was assigned had three separate churches and congregations in differing locations. He was appointed the second bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aliwal on 17 December 1973 and consecrated on 23 May 1974 in the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart. He resigned his office on 30 October 1981, due to poor health. After his resignation, Baaij spent some time in a rehabilitation center. He then began to do the work he loved, serving the sick in medical institutions of various types, from sanitoria to mental health facilities. When the apartheid laws were ended in 1994, he became a citizen of South Africa. He worked to open two hospices in Natal Province, before moving to a nursing home in Port Elizabeth. Continuing his service to the sick as best he could, he died there. His wish was to be buried in Aliwal.

Bird's Eye View of Victoria, Texas De Le√≥n's Colony was established in 1824 in northern Coahuila y Tejas state of the First Mexican Republic, by empresario Mart√≠n De Le√≥n. It was the only ethnically Mexican colony founded during the Mexican period (1824-1835) that is located within the present-day U.S. state of Texas. Victoria was the center of the colony. Attracting new settlers to this area was part of an effort by the Mexican government to develop Coahuila y Tejas, which was sparsely populated. De Le√≥n was one of several empresarios who were granted colonization contracts by the Mexican government. Others were Stephen F. Austin, Green DeWitt, Haden Edwards, David G. Burnet, Lorenzo de Zavala and Sterling C. Robertson. Of these, only De Le√≥n and Austin successfully established colonies. Upon De Le√≥n's death in 1833, his colony's value was estimated at $1 million. Petitions to the Spanish government In 1799, Mart√≠n De Le√≥n and his wife Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n established a cattle ranch in Spanish Texas, in the area of present-day San Patricio County, Texas. In both 1807 and 1809, Mart√≠n De Le√≥n petitioned the Spanish government in the Viceroyalty of New Spain for permission to colonize in this area. Both petitions were denied. Petition to Mexican government After Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, colonization possibilities looked more favorable. On April 13, 1824, prior to the 1824 Constitution of Mexico enactment on October 4, the provisional Mexican government approved a contract allowing De Le√≥n to settle forty-one Mexican families on the lower Guadalupe and Lavaca rivers, in the vicinity of Coleto, Garcitas, Arenosa, and Zorillo (Placido) creeks. Under the contract, each settler received a town lot, plus one league (4,228 acres) of grazing land and one labor (177 acres) of arable land. It was the only colony in Texas settled predominately by Mexicans, as opposed to colonists who immigrated from outside Mexico. De Le√≥n was to receive five leagues (22,140-acres) upon the settlement of the forty-one families. De Le√≥n located his ranch along Garcitas Creek. Establishing the colony Patricia de la Garza De Le√≥n invested $9,800 from her inheritance into the colony, plus another $300 valuation of cows, horses, and mules. Coahuila y Tejas appointed her son, Fernando De Le√≥n, as the first commissioner and colonization manager of De Le√≥n's Colony. Pl√°cido Benavides became De Leon's secretary. The settlement provided for a living for Catholic priests and land for a school. Benavides built a house fortress, fortified with first-floor gun slits and a reinforced door. It was known as \\"Pl√°cido's Round House\\" and the \\"Round Top House\\". The settlement was originally named \\"Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe Victoria\\" in honor of Guadalupe Victoria, who had just become the first president of Mexico, and the Guadalupe River. Empresario Mart√≠n De Le√≥n was appointed as the settlement's first alcalde. His assistant Pl√°cido Benavides would become the second alcalde, and his son Silvestre De Le√≥n was the third. When Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal platted the town, De Le√≥n named the main street Calle de los Diez Amigos (Street of Ten Friends), after the ten leading citizens entrusted with leadership of the community. The ten friends were: *Mart√≠n De Le√≥n *Fernando De Le√≥n, a son *Silvestre De Le√≥n, a son *Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal *Pl√°cido Benavides *Rafael Manchola *Le√≥nardo Manso *Julian de la Garza, brother-in-law *Valentino Garcia *Pedro Gellardro =Conflict with Green DeWitt= A conflict arose when the Coahuila y Tejas state government granted an empresario contract to Green DeWitt on April 15, 1825. The new government had not yet received notification of where De Le√≥n had established his grant's settlement of Guadalupe Victoria, and included that area in DeWitt's contract. On October 6, 1825, the Coahuila y Tejas government settled the dispute in favor of De Le√≥n. But competitive conflicts broke out between De Le√≥n and Dewitt, with an October 26, 1826 incident that resulted in De Le√≥n and his son-in-law Rafael Manchola arresting DeWitt. American Stephen F. Austin, another empresario in Texas, was called on to resolve the issues. In 1829 De Le√≥n was authorized by the Coahuila y Tejas government to bring an additional 150 families to the colony. His contract expired in 1831, and the government denied him an extension. In May 1832, the government ruled in favor of De Le√≥n's colonists settling on DeWitt's land. Legacy Mart√≠n De Le√≥n died of cholera in 1833, during an epidemic that swept towns along many of North America's waterways. Upon his death, the estimated wealth of his colony was $1 million. The government authorized his son Fernando De Le√≥n to assume his father's position as empresario. More than one hundred titles were given in the colony by July 1835. Other empresarios granted colonization contracts under the Mexican government were Stephen F. Austin, Green DeWitt, Haden Edwards, David G. Burnet, Lorenzo de Zavala and Sterling C. Robertson. Mart√≠n De Le√≥n and Stephen F. Austin were the only empresarios who completely fulfilled their contracts. References External links *Wikisource:Cook v.

It was written by Tracey Wigfield and directed by Ken Whittingham. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on March 17, 2011. The episode follows a reality show format, and often parallels the events of the Real Housewives franchise. Guest stars in this episode include Sherri Shepherd, Susan Sarandon and Tituss Burgess. This episode aired as an episode of Queen of Jordan, a fictional reality series that started sometime during the events of \\"Mrs. Donaghy\\". In this episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) convinces Liz to convince Angie to convince Tracy to come back from Africa. Meanwhile, Frank is found by his lost love. Throughout the episode, Jack gets into embarrassing situations and Jenna tries to be the focus of the reality show's cameras. This episode of 30 Rock received generally positive reviews from television critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Queen of Jordan\\" was watched by 4.192 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 1.7 rating/5 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. Plot Sherri Shepherd guest starred as Angie Jordan, whose reality TV show Queen of Jordan replaced the usual 30 Rock format The episode begins with Angie Jordan (guest star Sherri Shepherd) headed for a meeting with Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to discuss how her new single \\"My Single Is Dropping\\" is dropping. Jack offers to throw a release party on the set of TGS, but during the conversation, he trips, which gets caught by the cameras. Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), head writer of TGS, begs Angie to get Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to come back from Africa, but Angie doesn't want to. Liz is worried, but Jack tells Liz to continue to try to convince Angie to get Tracy back from Africa. Liz uses several attempts, at first impersonating Tracy (to which Angie says, \\"Don't do impressions of other races\\"). Liz then shows her their wedding video, saying that she \\"mixed up\\" the DVDs of that and the backup dancers' audition for the release party of the song (which is revealed to be 15 seconds long). This, too, fails, when Liz sees that Tracy came to their wedding with handcuffs and police behind him, thus getting Angie to prove how \\"exhausting\\" Tracy is. Liz's third attempt, sending an e-mail from Angie's computer to Tracy, is the last straw for Angie. She then proceeds to pull out Liz's hair (thinking that it was a weave) and explains that she is contractually obliged to \\"pull out some bitches' weaves eight more times this season.\\" Throughout the episode, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tries to get more screen time and promotion for her website Jennas- Side.com (which, when said out loud, sounds like \\"genocide\\") from the reality show cameras by throwing wine at several people. While drunk, Portia (Moya Angela) talks to Jenna about her alcoholism. Jenna pretends to not like the planned intervention, while actually loving it because it will get her more screen time. However, her plan backfires in the end when Pete, who led the intervention, sends Jenna to rehab. But Jenna hits the driver unconscious and sneaks off to Angie's single release party. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy is being portrayed as a clumsy gay flatulent when he is talking to Grizz and Dot Com about his college days. He goes on to say that he \\"went both ways\\" (i.e., played on both offense and defense in football) and was \\"on the DL\\" (i.e, the baseball disabled list). It is then presumed that he is gay because of his misconstrued statements. Angie's gay friend D'Fwan (Tituss Burgess) talks to him about this. Jack, in a talking head interview, says that he is not gay but further embarrasses himself when a fart sound is heard when he stands up from the chair. Meanwhile, news of Lynn Onkman's (guest star Susan Sarandon) release from jail reveals to the TGS office that one of the writers, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), was Lynn's lover when he was 14, leading to Lynn Onkman's arrest and status as a registered sex offender. Lynn meets Frank at the TGS office. Inspired by their love, Randi (Paula Leggett Chase) sets them up on a date at her pole-dancing studio and watches them while she dances on a pole. Frank and Lynn have an argument because she talks about how he has remained \\"stuck\\" as a boy who loves comic books and action figures. Frank storms out, but the next day, he brings all his toys to her workplace in a fast food restaurant and puts them in a deep fryer to prove that he is ready to become the man she loves. Lynn is fired, and Frank and Lynn rekindle their relationship. At the release party, Liz finally confronts Angie about getting Tracy back and tells her that Tracy is a part of their family. She goes on to say her family is as \\"thick as thieves\\" before flipping a table, likely referencing a phrase used by Caroline Manzo and the infamous table flip by Teresa Giudice, both stars of the Real Housewives of New Jersey. Angie cries, but when Liz apologizes, she says that it is because of seeing how Frank and Lynn love each other. She goes on to say that she misses her \\"weird love\\" with Tracy. Angie confesses that she has been trying to get Tracy to go back since he left, but since he doesn't want to go back, she pretends to be happy about it. Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 4.192 million households in its original American broadcast. It earned a 1.7 rating/5 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The figure was a decrease from the previous episode, TGS Hates Women, which was seen by 4.501 million households. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix was largely positive toward the episode, describing it as \\"a pretty thorough send-up of the cliches of the Real Housewives franchise\\" and opining that \\"Jack sinking deeper and deeper into the show's caricatured conception of him was hilarious\\". Sepinwall also noted that \\"Tracy Morgan's medical leave [had] forced the show to vamp a bit, and this was a particularly creative bit of vamping with some fine gags\\", however he commented that he looked forward to the show returning to normal the following week. The A.V. Club critic Emily VanDerWerff commented on the improved quality that the fifth season of 30 Rock had demonstrated, attributing it to the show \\"rediscovering its sense of playfulness\\". She praised the primary plot, commenting that \\"the Liz storyline was unexpectedly moving, as Liz‚Äôs farcical attempts to get Tracy to come back [...] led to the revelation that Angie has been trying to get Tracy to come back to no avail\\". However, she also noted that the episode's format crowded out a number of storylines, including the one featuring Susan Sarandon. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic was also positive toward the episode, praising the character of Angie and saying that \\"everything about [the] spoof worked\\", whilst Ian McDonald of TVOverMind said that the humour in the episode \\"reads like a checklist for 'Housewife' reality shows to adhere to\\" and concluded that \\"including the minor hiccups, \\"Queen of Jordan\\" was the best episode of the season, if not the most memorable\\".

This can be divided into compressive and adhesive forces in the direction perpendicular to the interface, and frictional forces in the tangential direction. Frictional contact mechanics is the study of the deformation of bodies in the presence of frictional effects, whereas frictionless contact mechanics assumes the absence of such effects. Frictional contact mechanics is concerned with a large range of different scales. * At the macroscopic scale, it is applied for the investigation of the motion of contacting bodies (see Contact dynamics). For instance the bouncing of a rubber ball on a surface depends on the frictional interaction at the contact interface. Here the total force versus indentation and lateral displacement are of main concern. * At the intermediate scale, one is interested in the local stresses, strains and deformations of the contacting bodies in and near the contact area. For instance to derive or validate contact models at the macroscopic scale, or to investigate wear and damage of the contacting bodies' surfaces. Application areas of this scale are tire-pavement interaction, railway wheel-rail interaction, roller bearing analysis, etc. * Finally, at the microscopic and nano-scales, contact mechanics is used to increase our understanding of tribological systems (e.g., investigate the origin of friction) and for the engineering of advanced devices like atomic force microscopes and MEMS devices. This page is mainly concerned with the second scale: getting basic insight in the stresses and deformations in and near the contact patch, without paying too much attention to the detailed mechanisms by which they come about.  History  Several famous scientists, engineers and mathematician contributed to our understanding of friction. They include Leonardo da Vinci, Guillaume Amontons, John Theophilus Desaguliers, Leonhard Euler, and Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. Later, Nikolai Pavlovich Petrov, Osborne Reynolds and Richard Stribeck supplemented this understanding with theories of lubrication. Deformation of solid materials was investigated in the 17th and 18th centuries by Robert Hooke, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and in the 19th and 20th centuries by d‚ÄôAlembert and Timoshenko. With respect to contact mechanics the classical contribution by Heinrich Hertz stands out. Further the fundamental solutions by Boussinesq and Cerruti are of primary importance for the investigation of frictional contact problems in the (linearly) elastic regime. In railway applications one wants to know the relation between creepage (velocity difference) xi and the friction force F_w. Classical results for a true frictional contact problem concern the papers by F.W. Carter (1926) and H. Fromm (1927). They independently presented the creep versus creep force relation for a cylinder on a plane or for two cylinders in steady rolling contact using Coulomb‚Äôs dry friction law (see below). These are applied to railway locomotive traction, and for understanding the hunting oscillation of railway vehicles. With respect to sliding, the classical solutions are due to C. Cattaneo (1938) and R.D. Mindlin (1949), who considered the tangential shifting of a sphere on a plane (see below). In the 1950s, interest in the rolling contact of railway wheels grew. In 1958, Kenneth L. Johnson presented an approximate approach for the 3D frictional problem with Hertzian geometry, with either lateral or spin creepage. Among others he found that spin creepage, which is symmetric about the center of the contact patch, leads to a net lateral force in rolling conditions. This is due to the fore-aft differences in the distribution of tractions in the contact patch. In 1967, Joost Jacques Kalker published his milestone PhD thesis on the linear theory for rolling contact. This theory is exact for the situation of an infinite friction coefficient in which case the slip area vanishes, and is approximative for non-vanishing creepages. It does assume Coulomb's friction law, which more or less requires (scrupulously) clean surfaces. This theory is for massive bodies such as the railway wheel-rail contact. With respect to road-tire interaction, an important contribution concerns the so-called magic tire formula by Hans Pacejka. In the 1970s, many numerical models were devised. Particularly variational approaches, such as those relying on Duvaut and Lion‚Äôs existence and uniqueness theories. Over time, these grew into finite element approaches for contact problems with general material models and geometries, and into half-space based approaches for so-called smooth- edged contact problems for linearly elastic materials. Models of the first category were presented by LaursenLaursen, T.A., 2002, Computational Contact and Impact Mechanics, Fundamentals of Modeling Interfacial Phenomena in Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis, Springer, Berlin and by Wriggers.Wriggers, P., 2006, Computational Contact Mechanics, 2nd ed., Springer, Heidelberg An example of the latter category is Kalker‚Äôs CONTACT model. A drawback of the well-founded variational approaches is their large computation times. Therefore, many different approximate approaches were devised as well. Several well-known approximate theories for the rolling contact problem are Kalker‚Äôs FASTSIM approach, the Shen-Hedrick-Elkins formula, and Polach‚Äôs approach. More information on the history of the wheel/rail contact problem is provided in Knothe's paper. Further Johnson collected in his book a tremendous amount of information on contact mechanics and related subjects. With respect to rolling contact mechanics an overview of various theories is presented by Kalker as well. Finally the proceedings of a CISM course are of interest, which provide an introduction to more advanced aspects of rolling contact theory.  Problem formulation Central in the analysis of frictional contact problems is the understanding that the stresses at the surface of each body are spatially varying. Consequently, the strains and deformations of the bodies are varying with position too. And the motion of particles of the contacting bodies can be different at different locations: in part of the contact patch particles of the opposing bodies may adhere (stick) to each other, whereas in other parts of the contact patch relative movement occurs. This local relative sliding is called micro-slip. This subdivision of the contact area into stick (adhesion) and slip areas manifests itself a.o. in fretting wear. Note that wear occurs only where power is dissipated, which requires stress and local relative displacement (slip) between the two surfaces. The size and shape of the contact patch itself and of its adhesion and slip areas are generally unknown in advance. If these were known, then the elastic fields in the two bodies could be solved independently from each other and the problem would not be a contact problem anymore. Three different components can be distinguished in a contact problem. # First of all, there is the deformation of the separate bodies in reaction to loads applied on their surfaces. This is the subject of general continuum mechanics. It depends largely on the geometry of the bodies and on their (constitutive) material behavior (e.g. elastic vs. plastic response, homogeneous vs. layered structure etc.). # Secondly, there is the overall motion of the bodies relative to each other. For instance the bodies can be at rest (statics) or approaching each other quickly (impact), and can be shifted (sliding) or rotated (rolling) over each other. These overall motions are generally studied in classical mechanics, see for instance multibody dynamics. # Finally there are the processes at the contact interface: compression and adhesion in the direction perpendicular to the interface, and friction and micro-slip in the tangential directions. The last aspect is the primary concern of contact mechanics. It is described in terms of so-called contact conditions. For the direction perpendicular to the interface, the normal contact problem, adhesion effects are usually small (at larger spatial scales) and the following conditions are typically employed: # The gap e_n between the two surfaces must be zero (contact) or strictly positive (separation, e_n>0); # The normal stress p_n acting on each body is zero (separation) or compressive (p_n > 0 in contact). Mathematically: e_n ge 0, p_n ge 0, e_ncdot p_n = 0,!. Here e_n, p_n are functions that vary with the position along the bodies' surfaces. In the tangential directions the following conditions are often used: # The local (tangential) shear stress vec{p} = (p_x, p_y)^mathsf{T},! (assuming the normal direction parallel to the z-axis) cannot exceed a certain position-dependent maximum, the so- called traction bound g; # Where the magnitude of tangential traction falls below the traction bound vec{p}, the opposing surfaces adhere together and micro-slip vanishes, vec{s} = (s_x, s_y)^mathsf{T} = vec{0},!; # Micro-slip occurs where the tangential tractions are at the traction bound; the direction of the tangential traction is then opposite to the direction of micro-slip vec{p} = -gvec{s}/vec{s},!. The precise form of the traction bound is the so-called local friction law. For this Coulomb's (global) friction law is often applied locally: vec{p}le g = mu p_n,!, with mu the friction coefficient. More detailed formulae are also possible, for instance with mu depending on temperature T, local sliding velocity vec{s}, etc.  Solutions for static cases = Rope on a bollard, the capstan equation = Illustration of an elastic rope wrapped around a fixed item such as a bollard. The contact area is divided into stick and slip zones, depending on the loads exerted on both ends and on the loading history. Consider a rope where equal forces (e.g., F_text{hold} = 400,mathrm{N}) are exerted on both sides. By this the rope is stretched a bit and an internal tension T is induced (T = 400,mathrm{N} on every position along the rope). The rope is wrapped around a fixed item such as a bollard; it is bent and makes contact to the item's surface over a contact angle (e.g., 180^circ). Normal pressure comes into being between the rope and bollard, but no friction occurs yet. Next the force on one side of the bollard is increased to a higher value (e.g., F_text{load} = 600,mathrm{N}). This does cause frictional shear stresses in the contact area. In the final situation the bollard exercises a friction force on the rope such that a static situation occurs. The tension distribution in the rope in this final situation is described by the capstan equation, with solution: :begin{align} T(phi) &= T_text{hold}, & phi &in left[phi_text{hold}, phi_text{intf}right]  T(phi) &= T_text{load} e^{-muphi}, & phi &in left[phi_text{intf}, phi_text{load}right]  phi_text{intf} &= frac{1}{mu} logleft(frac{T_text{load}}{T_text{hold}}right) & end{align} The tension increases from T_text{hold} on the slack side (phi = phi_text{hold}) to T_text{load} on the high side phi = phi_text{load}. When viewed from the high side, the tension drops exponentially, until it reaches the lower load at phi = phi_text{intf}. From there on it is constant at this value. The transition point phi_text{intf} is determined by the ratio of the two loads and the friction coefficient. Here the tensions T are in Newtons and the angles phi in radians. The tension T in the rope in the final situation is increased with respect to the initial state. Therefore, the rope is elongated a bit. This means that not all surface particles of the rope can have held their initial position on the bollard surface. During the loading process, the rope slipped a little bit along the bollard surface in the slip area phi in [phi_text{intf}, phi_text{load}]. This slip is precisely large enough to get to the elongation that occurs in the final state. Note that there is no slipping going on in the final state; the term slip area refers to the slippage that occurred during the loading process. Note further that the location of the slip area depends on the initial state and the loading process. If the initial tension is 600,mathrm{N} and the tension is reduced to 400,mathrm{N} at the slack side, then the slip area occurs at the slack side of the contact area. For initial tensions between 400 and 600,mathrm{N}, there can be slip areas on both sides with a stick area in between. = Generalization for a rope lying on an arbitrary orthotropic surface = If a rope is laying in equilibrium under tangential forces on a rough orthotropic surface then three following conditions (all of them) are satisfied: , where k_gis a geodesic curvature of the rope curve, k is a curvature of a rope curve, mu_tauis a coefficient of friction in the tangential direction. If omega is constant then T_0 e^{-mu_tau k s , sqrt{ cos^2 alpha - frac{sin^2 alpha}{mu_g^2}}} le T le T_0 e^{mu_tau k s , sqrt{ cos^2 alpha - frac{sin^2 alpha}{mu_g^2}}}. }} This generalization has been obtained by Konyukhov A., = Sphere on a plane, the (3D) Cattaneo problem = Consider a sphere that is pressed onto a plane (half space) and then shifted over the plane's surface. If the sphere and plane are idealised as rigid bodies, then contact would occur in just a single point, and the sphere would not move until the tangential force that is applied reaches the maximum friction force. Then it starts sliding over the surface until the applied force is reduced again. In reality, with elastic effects taken into consideration, the situation is much different. If an elastic sphere is pressed onto an elastic plane of the same material then both bodies deform, a circular contact area comes into being, and a (Hertzian) normal pressure distribution arises. The center of the sphere is moved down by a distance delta_n called the approach, which is equivalent to the maximum penetration of the undeformed surfaces. For a sphere of radius R and elastic constants E, u this Hertzian solution reads: :begin{align} p_n(x, y) &= p_0 sqrt{1 - frac{r^2}{a^2}} & r &= sqrt{x^2 + y^2} le a & a &= sqrt{Rdelta_n}  p_0 &= frac{2}{pi} E^* sqrt{frac{delta_n}{R}} & F_n &= frac{4}{3} E^* sqrt{R} delta_n^frac{3}{2} & E^* &= frac{E}{2left(1 - u^2right)} end{align} Now consider that a tangential force F_x is applied that is lower than the Coulomb friction bound mu F_n. The center of the sphere will then be moved sideways by a small distance delta_x that is called the shift. A static equilibrium is obtained in which elastic deformations occur as well as frictional shear stresses in the contact interface. In this case, if the tangential force is reduced then the elastic deformations and shear stresses reduce as well. The sphere largely shifts back to its original position, except for frictional losses that arise due to local slip in the contact patch. This contact problem was solved approximately by Cattaneo using an analytical approach. The stress distribution in the equilibrium state consists of two parts: :begin{align} p_x(x, y) &= mu p_0 left(sqrt{1 - frac{r^2}{a^2}} - frac{c}{a}sqrt{1 - frac{r^2}{c^2}} right) & 0 le {} &r; le c  p_x(x, y) &= mu p_n(x, y) & c le {} &r; le a  p_x(x, y) &= 0 & a le {} &r; end{align} In the central, sticking region 0 le r le c, the surface particles of the plane displace over u_x = delta_x/2 to the right whereas the surface particles of the sphere displace over u_x = -delta_x/2 to the left. Even though the sphere as a whole moves over delta_x relative to the plane, these surface particles did not move relative to each other. In the outer annulus c le r le r, the surface particles did move relative to each other. Their local shift is obtained as :s_x(x, y) = delta_x + u_x^text{sphere}(x, y) - u_x^text{plane}(x, y) This shift s_x(x, y) is precisely as large such that a static equilibrium is obtained with shear stresses at the traction bound in this so-called slip area. So, during the tangential loading of the sphere, partial sliding occurs. The contact area is thus divided into a slip area where the surfaces move relative to each other and a stick area where they do not. In the equilibrium state no more sliding is going on.  Solutions for dynamic sliding problems The solution of a contact problem consists of the state at the interface (where the contact is, division of the contact area into stick and slip zones, and the normal and shear stress distributions) plus the elastic field in the bodies' interiors. This solution depends on the history of the contact. This can be seen by extension of the Cattaneo problem described above. * In the Cattaneo problem, the sphere is first pressed onto the plane and then shifted tangentially. This yields partial slip as described above. * If the sphere is first shifted tangentially and then pressed onto the plane, then there is no tangential displacement difference between the opposing surfaces and consequently there is no tangential stress in the contact interface. * If the approach in normal direction and tangential shift are increased simultaneously (\\"oblique compression\\") then a situation can be achieved with tangential stress but without local slip. This demonstrates that the state in the contact interface is not only dependent on the relative positions of the two bodies, but also on their motion history. Another example of this occurs if the sphere is shifted back to its original position. Initially there was no tangential stress in the contact interface. After the initial shift micro-slip has occurred. This micro-slip is not entirely undone by shifting back. So in the final situation tangential stresses remain in the interface, in what looks like an identical configuration as the original one. Influence of friction on dynamic contacts (impacts) is considered in detail in.  Solution of rolling contact problems Rolling contact between a cylinder and a plane. Particles moving through the contact area from right to left, being strained more and more until local sliding sets in. Rolling contact problems are dynamic problems in which the contacting bodies are continuously moving with respect to each other. A difference to dynamic sliding contact problems is that there is more variety in the state of different surface particles. Whereas the contact patch in a sliding problem continuously consists of more or less the same particles, in a rolling contact problem particles enter and leave the contact patch incessantly. Moreover, in a sliding problem the surface particles in the contact patch are all subjected to more or less the same tangential shift everywhere, whereas in a rolling problem the surface particles are stressed in rather different ways. They are free of stress when entering the contact patch, then stick to a particle of the opposing surface, are strained by the overall motion difference between the two bodies, until the local traction bound is exceeded and local slip sets in. This process is in different stages for different parts of the contact area. If the overall motion of the bodies is constant, then an overall steady state may be attained. Here the state of each surface particle is varying in time, but the overall distribution can be constant. This is formalised by using a coordinate system that is moving along with the contact patch. = Cylinder rolling on a plane, the (2D) Carter-Fromm solution = Consider a cylinder that is rolling over a plane (half-space) under steady conditions, with a time-independent longitudinal creepage xi. (Relatively) far away from the ends of the cylinders a situation of plane strain occurs and the problem is 2-dimensional. If the cylinder and plane consist of the same materials then the normal contact problem is unaffected by the shear stress. The contact area is a strip x in [-a, a], and the pressure is described by the (2D) Hertz solution. :begin{align} p_n(x) &= frac{p_0}{a} sqrt{a^2 - x^2} & x &le a & a^2 &= frac{4 F_n R}{pi E^*}  p_0 &= frac{2 F_n}{pi a} &&& E^* &= frac{E}{2left(1 - u^2right)} & end{align} The distribution of the shear stress is described by the Carter- Fromm solution. It consists of an adhesion area at the leading edge of the contact area and a slip area at the trailing edge. The length of the adhesion area is denoted 2a'. Further the adhesion coordinate is introduced by x' = x + a - a'. In case of a positive force F_x > 0 (negative creepage xi < 0) it is: :begin{align} p_x(x) &= 0 & &x; ge a  p_x(x) &= frac{mu p_0}{a} left( sqrt{a^2 - x^2} - sqrt{a'^2 - x'^2} right) & a - 2a' le {} &x; le a  p_x(x) &= mu p_n(x) & &x; le a - 2a' end{align} The size of the adhesion area depends on the creepage, the wheel radius and the friction coefficient. :begin{align} a' &= a sqrt{1 - frac{F_x}{mu F_n}}, & mbox{for } F_x le mu F_n  xi &= -operatorname{sign}(F_x) , frac{mu (a - a')}{R}, & mbox{i.e. } xi le frac{mu a}{R}  F_x &= -operatorname{sign}(xi) ,mu F_n left( 1 - left( 1 + frac{R xi}{mu a}right)^2 right) end{align} For larger creepages a' = 0 such that full sliding occurs.  Half-space based approaches When considering contact problems at the intermediate spatial scales, the small-scale material inhomogeneities and surface roughness are ignored. The bodies are considered as consisting of smooth surfaces and homogeneous materials. A continuum approach is taken where the stresses, strains and displacements are described by (piecewise) continuous functions. The half-space approach is an elegant solution strategy for so-called \\"smooth-edged\\" or \\"concentrated\\" contact problems. # If a massive elastic body is loaded on a small section of its surface, then the elastic stresses attenuate proportional to 1/distance^2 and the elastic displacements by 1/distance when one moves away from this surface area. # If a body has no sharp corners in or near the contact region, then its response to a surface load may be approximated well by the response of an elastic half-space (e.g. all points (x, y, z)^mathsf{T} in R^3,! with z>0,!). # The elastic half-space problem is solved analytically, see the Boussinesq-Cerruti solution. # Due to the linearity of this approach, multiple partial solutions may be super-imposed. Using the fundamental solution for the half-space, the full 3D contact problem is reduced to a 2D problem for the bodies' bounding surfaces. A further simplification occurs if the two bodies are ‚Äúgeometrically and elastically alike‚Äù. In general, stress inside a body in one direction induces displacements in perpendicular directions too. Consequently, there is an interaction between the normal stress and tangential displacements in the contact problem, and an interaction between the tangential stress and normal displacements. But if the normal stress in the contact interface induces the same tangential displacements in both contacting bodies, then there is no relative tangential displacement of the two surfaces. In that case, the normal and tangential contact problems are decoupled. If this is the case then the two bodies are called quasi-identical. This happens for instance if the bodies are mirror-symmetric with respect to the contact plane and have the same elastic constants. Classical solutions based on the half-space approach are: # Hertz solved the contact problem in the absence of friction, for a simple geometry (curved surfaces with constant radii of curvature). # Carter considered the rolling contact between a cylinder and a plane, as described above. A complete analytical solution is provided for the tangential traction. # Cattaneo considered the compression and shifting of two spheres, as described above. Note that this analytical solution is approximate. In reality small tangential tractions p_y occur which are ignored.  See also  s    References  External links  * Biography of Prof.dr.ir. J.J.

(sources on page include historical publications) Career Whitney moved to New York City in his early twenties, taking a job in his brother Henry's business firm Lawrence & Whitney. By 1800 Whitney had accumulated enough capital to go into business as a grocer and an importer of wine and spirits on his own, at first in partnership with a Scotsman named John Currie. = War of 1812 = During the War of 1812, American cotton had become almost worthless due to an embargo on exports. Whitney arranged through agents to accept cotton as payment for debts owed him in the South. He was able to export some of that cotton during the war through Amelia Island in northern Florida, at the time still part of neutral Spain. When the war ended in 1815, he owned warehouses full of cotton. He is also reported to have purchased all the cotton bales used to build fortifications by Andrew Jackson's army during the Battle of New Orleans. When the embargo was lifted, the price of cotton shot up, and he became a wealthy man. By 1818‚Äîat age 42‚Äîhe was able to retire from commerce. = Later life = The Merchants' Exchange Building burning in 1835 Whitney turned his attention to investing his fortune. He bought up real estate in the city, especially in the area around Pearl Street and lower Manhattan. He was a director of both the National Bank of Commerce in New York, of which he was a founder in 1839, and the Bank of America. He invested in shipping, including the China trade and the Robert Kermit Red Star Line of packets. One of the Kermit Line vessels was named for him (the ship Stephen Whitney). Other interests were insurance, canals, and the new railroads (he was a director of the New Jersey Rail Road). In 1827, he joined William Backhouse Astor, son of John Jacob Astor, in building a Merchants' Exchange Building at the corner of Wall and William Streets. The New York Stock and Exchange Board moved their operations from the Tontine Coffee House to the new building, adopting it as their first permanent home. In the 1840s he was involved in the founding of Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Much of lower Manhattan was destroyed in a disastrous fire in December 1835. The Merchants Stock and Exchange Building was one of the losses (a new building, the second building of that name, was built on the site and still stands today). Stephen Whitney was one of the many prominent citizens who served on the committee to help the city rebuild. Two years later, he managed to make a huge profit from the Panic of 1837. He bought up commercial paper during the panic, and held it until it had rebounded. This greatly increased his wealth, making him a millionaire. Politically, Whitney was an \\"Old-Line Whig\\", and like many New Yorkers he was a supporter of Henry Clay. In 1852 Whitney was one of the leaders in organizing the City Reform League, which spearheaded a movement to wrest some of the power away from corrupt city aldermen. Personal life In 1803, when he was 26 years old, he married Harriet Suydam (1782‚Äì1860), the sister of his brother's wife. Together, they were the parents of: * Samuel Suydam Whitney (1804‚Äì1858), who died unmarried. * Emeline Whitney (b. 1806), who married John Dore. * John Currie Whitney (1808‚Äì1808), who died in infancy. * Mary Whitney (1810‚Äì1876), who married Jonas Phillips Phoenix, a merchant and U.S. Representative. * Henry Whitney (1812‚Äì1856), who married Hannah Eugenia Lawrence (1815‚Äì1844) in 1835. After her death, he married Maria Lucy Fitch (d. 1886) in 1850. * William Whitney (1816‚Äì1862), who married Mary Stuart McVickar (1817‚Äì1907) in 1843. * Stephen Whitney (1814‚Äì1858), who died unmarried of consumption. * Edward Whitney (1818‚Äì1851), who died unmarried. * Caroline Whitney (1823‚Äì1905), who married Ferdinand Suydam. After his death, she married Dr. John Jacob Crane. Whitney died at home in Bowling Green on February 16, 1860. An elaborate funeral was held at Trinity Church, after which he was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. The executors of his estate later had a marble chapel built at his burial site. Harriet Suydam Whitney died four months later, in May 1860. =Residence= In 1825, Whitney had a townhouse built at Number 7 Bowling Green, at the corner of State Street and Broadway‚Äîthe current site of the old Custom House that is now home to the Heye Indian Museum. The seven houses in the block, which faced across Bowling Green and straight up Broadway, were among the most fashionable in the city when they were built. However, as the city quickly evolved, wealthy residents began to move \\"uptown\\" to Washington Square and Fifth Avenue. Stephen Whitney, who was famous for refusing to bend to fashion, was still living at 7 Bowling Green when he died, even though the neighborhood had become somewhat run down and all of his peers had moved away. The contents of the Whitney living room at 7 Bowling Green have been on permanent display at the Museum of the City of New York since 1936. =Wealth= Whitney was among the first multi-millionaires in the city. Many accounts refer to his fortune as second only to that of John Jacob Astor, who died in 1848 with an estate of $20 million. Whitney's wealth was estimated at his death to be at least $8 million, although some thought it was $10 or even $15 million. Unlike the Astors, he was not given to public philanthropy, and the result is that the Whitney name is not remembered in the city the way that the Astor name is. =Descendants= Through his son William, he was a grandfather of Mary Stuart Whitney (1849‚Äì1922), who married attorney J. Frederic Kernochan, brother of businessman James Powell Kernochan.

Early life Archibald Young Gipps Campbell was born in Brighton, England, on May 18, 1872. His father, Archibald Samuels Campbell (1821‚Äì1899), had been a Fellow of mathematics at St John's College, Cambridge before going out to Jamaica where the family owned a number of plantations. He returned to England and married Alice Gipps (died 1932) in 1871 at the age of 50 and had three sons (Archibald, Allan, and William) and two daughters (Alice a.k.a. Hilda; and Mary a.k.a. Daisy). Archibald Young Gipps Campbell was the eldest child. Archilbald Samuel Campbell retired to Cambridge and died there in 1899. An obituary appeared in the Eagle, the St John‚Äôs College magazine, the following year. A. Y. G. Campbell and was educated at the Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Archibald Young Gipps Campbell appears to have inherited much of his father‚Äôs talent for mathematics. After going up to Westminster School, he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he went on to become a Smith‚Äôs Prizeman and Tyson Medallist, passing out 9th in the mathematics tripos, and particularly distinguishing himself for his work in cosmology. His undergraduate dissertation on the Theory of the Composition of the Stars was so outstanding that on the strength of it, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and a member of the Soci√©t√© astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society). Sir Robert Ball, then Lowndean Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge, included his work in his lectures and described him as one of the most brilliant mathematicians of his time. Early career The Indian Civil Service was an attractive proposition for the brightest Cambridge graduates in the 1890s. Archibald sat the examinations on graduation in 1895 and came second, only being beaten by Julius Mathison Turing, father of the famous Alan Turing FRS (the cryptologist who led the team who broke the Enigma code at Bletchley Park in the Second World War). Alan Turing‚Äôs biography mentions that his father was always bitter that Archibald Campbell had been promoted more quickly than he had when they were in India. Turing wrote that he thought Archibald‚Äôs success over his father‚Äôs could be put down to the fact that Julius Turing was notably un- diplomatic in dealing with people. He also revealed that his father always referred to Archibald as ‚ÄúXYZ Campbell‚Äù. The nickname ‚Äì no doubt a play on his initials AYG and his penchant for mathematics ‚Äì seems to have been generally used by everyone, including his family. His sons certainly recalled having called him ‚ÄúXYZ‚Äù as children. Archibald Young Gipps Campbell joined the Indian Service on 29 October 1896 and arrived in India to take up his post on 3 December of the same year. He was 24 years old. He remained an active member of the Indian Civil Service for the next thirty-four years, ten months and seven days, finally retiring at the age of 58 in January 1935. His rank was initially as an Assistant Collector and Magistrate in the Madras Presidency until his appointment as an Under-Secretary in the Revenue Department in November 1903. Whether Julius Turing had any right to be jealous of XYZ‚Äôs success in the service is more doubtful. It is true that he eventually reached a very high grade but his promotion record suggests that this was through hard work and long service, not any kind of preferment. His appointments in the first five years from 1897-1902 were as Assistant Collector to the outlying areas of Nellore, Bellary, Onole and Penukonda. His first duty was the relief of the famine in Nellore. In 1902 he was posted to Ooty, preparing the Annual Administration Report and the Manual of Standing Information. In 1903 he was appointed an Under-Secretary in the Revenue Department. A year later, in 1904, he moved to the Public Department where his duties were mainly involved with the creation of suitable ceremonies for public investitures and with the planned visit to Madras of their Majesties the King-Emperor and Queen-Empress (Edward VII and Alexandra). In January 1906 he was seconded to escort the Prince of Wales to Madras and in May of the same year he became Private Secretary to the Governor, Sir Arthur Lawley. He continued as such with his successor Thomas Gibson Carmichael. XYZ remained as the Governor‚Äôs Private Secretary for five years (1906‚Äì1911) until after the Delhi Durbar. During this time he made many friends in all parts of the Madras government. The nickname ‚ÄúXYZ‚Äù given to him by his friends on account of his mathematical prowess, became so universal that on his marriage telegrams addressed to ‚ÄúXYZ Madras‚Äù were delivered direct without any delay and even his wife came to call him by that name. He took his first leave in 1909, returning to the UK for two- and‚Äìa-half months. It was presumably during that time that he courted Frances Irene Young. She came to India and they married in Madras in 1910. In January 1911 he was made a Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (C.I.E.). By that time he was 38 years old and had already served 14 years in India, a third of it in the direct service of the Governor. On 17 January 1911 he was posted to Chittoor as a sub-collector, first grade. There he devoted his attentions to the improvement of roads and bridges and helping the farmers marketing their produce, but before he had made as much progress as he hoped he was recalled to Madras to become President of the Corporation. He was then lent to the Government of India as a member of the Weights and Measures Committee for India and Burma, which involved a visit to that country. In 1914 both husband and wife returned to the UK on leave. The period of leave allowed his son Archibald Hugh (always known as Hugh) to be born in England. The original plan must have been for the family to return to India but all this was interrupted by the declaration of the First World War. Family Life Archibald Campbell had married Frances Irene Young in 1910. He was 38 and she was 25. The fact that there was a ‚ÄúYoung‚Äù in both his name and hers was not a coincidence: they were distant cousins. They were married in Madras by Bishop Whitehead in Fort St George. They went on to have three sons: Archibald Hugh (always known as Hugh), Colin Alan George and Niall Patrick (always known as Patrick). Hugh was born in 1914, followed by Colin in 1917. There was then a gap before the youngest Patrick was born in 1925. No doubt part of the reason for the gap was separation. Initially Archibald and Irene had lived together in Madras, but they were in England on leave in 1914 when the First World War broke out and the family only returned to Madras after Armistice in November 1918. However it was a short stay. In 1920 Irene decided that the pressures of Archibald‚Äôs job and his other commitments meant that the family were better off in England and she moved back permanently. Thereafter she may have come out to India to see him, possibly while the children were at boarding school, but he only came back on his extended periods of leave and then only very rarely. In 1926 Irene and Archibald bought a house in England. It was called Flowers Court and was in Pangbourne. It acted as the family home for the next 26 years. In 1952 when they moved to Burghfield near Reading. The sons were all sent to boarding school in England (Winchester). All three subsequently went on to Trinity College, Cambridge. The period of leave in the Indian Civil Service was normally 8 months in every three years to allow English civil servants to return to England and see their families. He returned to England in 1921, 1924 and 1928 but that was the last time. Colin remembered that when he was 18 when he drove to the station to collect his father on his final return after retirement, he had not seen his father since he was eleven years old. First World War When war was declared in 1914, Archibald was back in England on leave. He had been a keen volunteer soldier in India, serving as a major in the Southern Provinces Mounted Rifles and earning a Volunteer Decoration for his work. He now sought to get involved in the army but his age worked against him, so instead he turned to his old Governor, Sir Arthur Lawley. Lawley had been appointed Commissioner of the Red Cross in France and he appointed XYZ as Financial Secretary and Secretary of the General Commission. Archibald Campbell had an extraordinary ability at organisation. Sir Robert Hudson, Treasurer of the Commission, described his work as Financial Secretary as one of the best bits of finance he had ever seen. Sir Arthur Stanley (Chairman of the Joint War Committee of the British Red Cross Service) later stated that the committee ‚Äúfully realised how much of the success of our work in France is due to his efforts and his great organising ability‚Äù. Worthy as this was, his greatest contribution was yet to come. He was recalled to India on expiry of his leave, but before he could set sail he was once more borrowed, this time at the instigation of Lord Northcliffe, by the War Office and the Red Cross to conduct a joint enquiry into the condition and feeding of British prisoners of war in Germany. XYZ‚Äôs report recommended the unification of the many associations providing food for the prisoners of war in Germany under the headship of Central Prisoners of War Committee and he was duly appointed to personally undertake this task. Offices were taken in 4 Thurloe Place, London and the committee was chaired by Sir Leander Starr Jameson, leader of the famous Jameson Raid in 1896 and later Prime Minister of Cape Colony. Major Campbell, as he was then known, was thus directly responsible for inventing and implementing the Red Cross food parcel. This was perhaps his single greatest achievement and the one for which he most deserves to be remembered. Nor did it go unrecognised at the time: he was made a Knight of Grace of the Order of St John of Jerusalem for this work in 1916 and in 1920 received a CBE for it, ‚Äúas Founder and Organiser of the Central Prisoners of War Organisation‚Äù. After the work was completed he was finally and urgently recalled to India. Return to India XYZ returned to India on 9 January 1917 as a Collector second grade in Kristna district based in Masulpatum. From 3 January 1919 he returned to Madras and was appointed Secretary to the Revenue Department and from 22 November he was on special duty as Director of Industries and in 1920 he was put in charge of the office of the Director of Fisheries (presumably while the latter was on leave). In 1922 he was involved in an inquiry into the excessive costs of government in Coorg and made the third member of the Board of Revenue. He became the second member in 1925 and on 3 March 1925 was appointed Chief Secretary to the Government. He had by that time spent half his life in India. He was 52 years old. In 1928, he succeeded T. R. Venkatarama Sastri as the acting law member in the Governor's executive council. and a permanent member in 1930. He remained Chief Secretary until 1935, not returning to England at all for the last 7 years. He received the Companion of the Star of India on 1 January 1927 and on 1 January 1932 in the new year‚Äôs honours list he was made Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire (K.C.I.E). He was by then 60 years old and would normally have retired but there was no-one able to take his place and his retirement was deferred for a further three years. Madras Province in the British Raj was larger than Tamil Nadu covering and having a population of 38 million people. On retirement XYZ finally left India. He had been married there and one of his children had been born there. He had spent 34 years in India when leave was taken into account. Retirement and legacy Archibald Campbell retired to England and spent a brief period during the Second World War in Jamaica winding down the plantations there. He died on 30 October 1957. His children had children of their own. His life had been recorded in Who's Who and he was buried in a small grave in Lochgair, Scotland. There is another memorial. During the 1930s, he had been invited by a group Muslim people for the opening ceremony of their new village when he stayed in Mylapore, Chennai. and the village was named as \\"Campbellabad\\" which is located in Tuticorin district, Tamil Nadu, India. His name was added to their village name as a tribute.

Since its creation in 2003, the group has performed at numerous music festivals, at times in collaboration with some well-known contemporary Cuban rock musicians.Red Tree Collective- Popeye‚Äôs Golden Theory  Founders  Two of the founders, Josuhe Pagliery and Noel Serrano, both started by studying painting at the San Alejandro Fine Arts Academy, and then both completed their MFA degrees at the ISA (Higher Arts Institute) of Havana, Cuba. In 2003, Pagliery and Serrano joined with Dom√≠nguez and created the performance collective ‚ÄúLa Teor√≠a Dorada de Popeye‚Äù (Popeye's Golden Theory) in Havana.  History  La Teor√≠a Dorada de Popeye (Popeye's Golden Theory) was created in 2003 in Havana. Their sound, which could be described as Cuban grunge, aims at fusioning art and music and it's evident in their music videos and their live performances. The artists‚Äô identities have remained anonymous since they each hide behind their cartoon character masks. They refer to G. K. Chesterton, an English writer known as ¬´ the prince of paradox ¬ª ; claiming that their masks reveal more of their identity than they conceal. The band both critiques pop culture and accepts their status of rock stars and they therefore play two roles : youth idols and infiltrators. The band's name refers to Popeye the Sailor Man's motto : ‚ÄúI Yam What I Yam‚Äù. Music lovers have accepted PGT as a punk band.About Popeye‚Äôs Golden Theory None of the group's members are trained musicians, increasing the public's admiration towards their unique fusion of music and art. Critics of PGT, such as authorities in Cuba and to seekers of ‚Äòauthentic‚Äô Cuban music, say their music is ¬´ too North American ¬ª. PGT also rejected because of their hard core lyrics. Pagliery's training in animation at the ICAIC (Cuban Cinema Institute) has resulted in some of their music videos to win awards, including the Lucas best rock video for 2007.Premios Lucas/Lucas Award Winners by Year Another major characteristic of this band is that they sing in English. The reason for this choice, they argue, is that each language has a specific style and that the music they sing would not work with the Spanish language.

They include branches or subsidiaries of nearly all the world's largest international insurance and reinsurance companies. The exact size of IUA members‚Äô contribution to the London market is not known. They wrote a total of at least ¬£10 billion premium during 2009, a figure that does not include income processed outside the London market bureau. This business is wholesale, the bulk being made up of insurance for large multinational companies or reinsurance. Most of it is international, brought into London by brokers. The IUA provides a forum for discussing market issues and providing technical support to practitioners. IUA members collectively own a 25% share of Xchanging Ins-sure Services (XIS), the provider of back office processing services to the London market. History The IUA was formed in January 1998 from the merger of the London International Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA) and the Institute of London Underwriters (ILU). The main stated reason for the merger was the desire to give the London company market a single voice in dealings with government, regulators and other insurance bodies. Since the ILU had been formed in 1884, the IUA can claim to go back more than a century. The association has always made reform of the London market a top priority, especially the replacement of out-of-date processes and increased use of technology to conduct business. This led in 1999 to the creation of the IUA-Lloyd's Forum. This soon expanded to include brokers and eventually evolved into the London Market Group, which is still active today. Aims and priorities The IUA's mission is ‚ÄúTo promote and enhance the business environment for international insurance and reinsurance companies operating in or through London‚Äù. How this mission is interpreted has evolved over the years. From being a mainly strategic and lobbying organisation, it has become more concerned with activities that provide direct support to market professionals in their work. In 2009, the association set itself four strategic priorities: *Improving the efficiency of doing business in London; *Advancing the development of market expertise and innovation; *Influencing public policy and compliance developments; *Fostering relationships with the broking community and other client-related stakeholders. Committee structure The IUA board is elected by the membership. Reporting to the board are the committees, sub-committees and working parties, which provide the backbone of the association. These are populated overwhelmingly by market practitioners with the full-time IUA secretariat providing administrative support and implementing decisions (see chart). These committees responsibilities include for overseeing and supporting: the IUA's contribution to the London market modernisation programme; discussion with regulators and legislators and communicating the implications of regulatory changes to the membership; education, training and research; and technical matters relating to underwriting and claims, including specialist classes of insurance and reinsurance. IUA committees co-operate regularly with their counterparts at the Lloyd's Market Association and the two organisations jointly run a number of marine insurance committees. Although most of its committees and sub- committees are populated by people working for IUA companies, some such as Digital Risk and Rehabilitation have cross-market membership. Other activities The IUA holds regular lunchtime briefings and organises a number of events, most notably an annual catastrophe modelling conference, which normally attracts an international cast of speakers and delegates. It also supports an annual marine claims conference in Dublin. Its website has become an important communications tool and a repository of market statistics and other information. IUA membership IUA member companies come overwhelmingly from overseas, reflecting the globalisation of the insurance and reinsurance industries. As of March 2011 thirty eight of the IUA's forty members were based overseas or part of larger overseas groups. This external influence is reflected in the nationality of many of its board members. Around a third of IUA members also have operations at the Lloyd's as part of the growing inter- relationship of the two main parts of the London market. As well as Ordinary Membership, there are two other categories: Associate (for active insurance companies that do not operate in London but wish to have an association with the IUA); and Affiliate (for other organisations with an interest in the insurance and reinsurance market). Membership is always granted on a corporate rather than individual basis. The number of Ordinary member companies dropped by around 50% in the first five years of the association's existence even as their aggregate premium income increased, reflecting the consolidation of the company insurance market into fewer, larger players. Numbers have remained stable for several years with departures from the market being balanced by new arrivals.

For safety-critical applications, it is anticipated that cars will also be connected using dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) radios, operating in the FCC-granted 5.9 GHz band with very low latency. Both the U.S. and EU scenarios concentrate on 5.9 GHz communications, however, the EU scenario has a clearer path towards the use of hybrid communications (through the proposed CALM approach) than does the U.S. scenario. As such, the EU scenario is considered more integrated and scalable.  History of connected cars, 1996‚Äìpresent  General Motors was the first automaker to bring the first connected car features to market with OnStar in 1996 in Cadillac DeVille, Seville and Eldorado. OnStar was created by GM working with Motorola Automotive (that was later bought by Continental). The primary purpose was safety and to get emergency help to a vehicle when there was an accident. The sooner medical helps arrives the more likely the drivers and passengers would survive. A cellular telephone call would be routed to a call center where the agent sent help. At first, OnStar only worked with voice but when cellular systems added data the system was able to send the GPS location to the call center. After the success of OnStar, many automakers followed with similar safety programs that usually come with a free trial for a new car and then a paid subscription after the trial is over. Remote diagnostics were introduced in 2001. By 2003 connected car services included vehicle health reports, turn-by-turn directions and a network access device. Data-only telematics were first offered in 2007. In the summer of 2014, Audi was the first automaker to offer 4G LTE Wi-Fi Hotspots access and the first mass deployment of 4G LTE was by General Motors. By 2015, OnStar had processed 1 billion requests from customers. AA plc (formerly known as The Automobile Association) introduced Car Genie, the first piece of connected car technology in the UK that connects directly to a breakdown service, not only warning of issues with car health, but intervening directly with a phone call to customers to help them prevent a breakdown. In 2017, European technology start-up Stratio Automotive provides over 10,000 vehicles predictive intelligence enabling fleet operators to better manage and maintain their vehicles.  Types of connectivity  There are 5 ways a vehicle can be connected to its surroundings and communicate with them: # V2I \\"Vehicle to Infrastructure\\": The technology captures data generated by the vehicle and provides information about the infrastructure to the driver. The V2I technology communicates information about safety, mobility or environment- related conditions. # V2V \\"Vehicle to Vehicle\\": The technology communicates information about speed and position of surrounding vehicles through a wireless exchange of information. The goal is to avoid accidents, ease traffic congestions and have a positive impact on the environment. # V2C \\"Vehicle to Cloud\\": The technology exchanges information about and for applications of the vehicle with a cloud system. This allows the vehicle to use information from other, though the cloud connected industries like energy, transportation and smart homes and make use of IoT. # V2P \\"Vehicle to Pedestrian\\": The technology senses information about its environment and communicates it to other vehicles, infrastructure and personal mobile devices. This enables the vehicle to communicate with pedestrians and is intended to improve safety and mobility on the road. # V2X \\"Vehicle to Everything\\": The technology interconnects all types of vehicles and infrastructure systems with another. This connectivity includes cars, highways, ships, trains and airplanes.  Categories of applications  Applications can be separated into two categories: # Single vehicle applications: In-car content and service applications implemented by a single vehicle in connection with a cloud or backoffice. # Cooperative safety and efficiency applications: they provide connectivity between vehicles (or infrastructure) directly have to work cross-brand and cross-borders and require standards and regulation. Some may be convenience applications, others safety, which may require regulation. Examples include, amongst others: # Single-vehicle applications: concierge features provided by automakers or apps alert the driver of the time to leave to arrive on time from a calendar and send text message alerts to friends or business associates to alert them of arrival times such as BMW Connected NA that also helps find parking or gas stations. The European eCall would be an example of a single vehicle safety application that is mandatory in the EU.EU eCall (https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ecall-all-new-cars- april-2018) # Cooperative safety-of-life and cooperative efficiency: forward collision warning, lane change warning/blind spot warning, emergency brake light warning, intersection movement assist, emergency vehicle approaching, road works warning, automatic notification of crashes, notification of speeding and safety alerts. The connected car segment can be further classified into eight categories.PwC Strategy& 2014. \\"In the fast lane. The bright future of connected cars\\". https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/file/Strategyand_In-the-Fast-Lane.pdf * Mobility management: functions that allow the driver to reach a destination quickly, safely, and in a cost-efficient manner (e.g.: Current traffic information, Parking lot or garage assistance, Optimised fuel consumption) * Commerce: functions enabling users to purchase good or services while on-the- go (e.g., fuel, food & beverage, parking, tolls) * Vehicle management: functions that aid the driver in reducing operating costs and improving ease of use (e.g., vehicle condition and service reminders, remote operation, transfer of usage data) * Breakdown prevention: connected to a breakdown service, with a back end algorithm predicting breakdowns and an outbound service intervening via phone, SMS or push notification * Safety: functions that warn the driver of external hazards and internal responses of the vehicle to hazards (e.g., emergency breaking, lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, blind spot object identification) * Entertainment: functions involving the entertainment of the driver and passengers (e.g., smartphone interface, WLAN hotspot, music, video, Internet, social media, mobile office) * Driver assistance: functions involving partially or fully automatic driving (e.g., operational assistance or autopilot in heavy traffic, in parking, or on highways) * Well-being: functions involving the driver's comfort and ability and fitness to drive (e.g., fatigue detection, automatic environment adjustments to keep drivers alert, medical assistance)  Single-vehicle applications  Current automobiles entail embedded navigation systems, smartphone integration and multimedia packages. Typically, a connected car made after 2010 has a head-unit, in car entertainment unit, in-dash system with a screen from which the operations of the connections can be seen or managed by the driver. Types of functions that can be made include music/audio playing, smartphone apps, navigation, roadside assistance, voice commands, contextual help/offers, parking apps, engine controls and car diagnosis. On January 6, 2014, Google announced the formation of the Open Automotive Alliance (OAA) a global alliance of technology and auto industry leaders committed to bringing the Android platform to cars starting in 2014. The OAA includes Audi, GM, Google, Honda, Hyundai and Nvidia. On March 3, 2014, Apple announced a new system to connect iPhone 5/5c/5S to car infotainment units using iOS 7 to cars via a Lightning connector, called CarPlay. Android Auto was announced on June 25, 2014 to provide a way for Android smartphones to connect to car infotainment systems. Increasingly, connected cars (and especially electric cars) are taking advantage of the rise of smartphones, and apps are available to interact with the car from any distance. Users can unlock their cars, check the status of batteries on electric cars, find the location of the car, or remotely activate the climate control system. Innovations to be introduced until 2020 include the full integration of smartphone applications, such as the linkage of the smartphone calendar, displaying it on the car's windshield and automatic address searches in the navigation system for calendar entries. In the longer term, navigation systems will be integrated in the windshield and through augmented reality project digital information, like alerts and traffic information, onto real images from the driver's perspective. Near-term innovations regarding Vehicle Relationship Management (VRM) entail advanced remote services, such as GPS tracking and personalized usage restrictions. Further, maintenance services like over-the-air tune-ups, requiring the collaboration of car dealers, OEMs and service centers, are under development. Despite various market drivers there are also barriers that have prevented the ultimate breakthrough of the connected car in the past few years. One of these is the fact that customers are reluctant to pay the extra costs associated with embedded connectivity and instead use their smartphones as solution for their in-car connectivity needs. Because this barrier is likely to continue, at least in the short-term, car manufacturers are turning to smartphone integration in an effort to satisfy consumer demand for connectivity.  Cooperative safety-of-life and efficiency These services relate to Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), that depend on the sensory input of more than one vehicle and enable instant reaction through automatic monitoring, alerting, braking and steering activities. They depend on instant vehicle-to-vehicle communication, as well as infrastructure, functioning across brands and national borders and offering cross-brand and cross-border levels of privacy and security. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for that reason has argued for regulation in its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on V2V CommunicationFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communications, Docket No. NHTSA‚Äì2014‚Äì0022 (http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/V2V/V2V-ANPRM_081514.pdf) and argued the case in US Congress.Hearing in US Congress (https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings-and-votes/hearings/vehicle-vehicle- communications-and-connected-roadways-future ) NHTSA began the rule-making process on December 13, 2016, proposing to mandate dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) technology in new light vehicles. Under this proposed rule, vehicles would broadcast a defined data packet, the \\"basic safety message\\" (BSM) up to ten times per second, indicating vehicle location, heading, and speed. In March, 2017, GM became the first US automaker to provide DSRC as standard equipment on a production automobile, the Cadillac CTS. The US also has appropriate standards ‚Äì IEEE 802.11p ‚Äì and frequency rulesFederal Communication Commission ‚Äì Amendment of Parts 2 and 90 of the Commission's Rules to Allocate the 5.850-5.925 GHz Band to the Mobile Service for Dedicated Short Range Communications of Intelligent Transportation Services ET Docket No. 98-95 (https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-99-305A1.doc) in place.

In the EU there is no push to oblige vehicle manufacturers to introduce connect. Discussions about a regulatory framework for privacy and security are ongoing.C-ITS Deployment Platform ‚Äì Final Report, January 2016 (http://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/its/doc/c-its-platform-final-report- january-2016.pdf) Technologically speaking cooperative applications can be implemented.NHTSA: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications: Readiness of V2V Technology for Application (http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/V2V/Readiness- of-V2V-Technology-for-Application-812014.pdf) Here the regulatory framework is the main obstacle to implementation, questions like privacy and security need to be addressed. British weekly \\"The Economist\\" even argues that the matter is regulatory driven.  Hardware  The necessary hardware can be divided into built-in or brought-in connection systems. The built-in telematics boxes most commonly have a proprietary Internet connection via a GSM module and are integrated in the car IT system. Although most connected cars in the United States use the GSM operator AT&T; with a GSM SIM such as the case with Volvo, some cars such as the Hyundai Blue Link system utilizes Verizon Wireless Enterprise, a non-GSM CDMA operator. Most brought-in devices are plugged in the OBD (on-board diagnostics) port for electrification and access to vehicle data and can further be divided into two types of connection: * Hardware relies on customers smartphone for the Internet connection or * Hardware establishes proprietary internet connection via GSM module. All forms of hardware have typical use cases as drivers. The built-in solutions were mostly driven by safety regulations in Europe for an automated Emergency Call (abbr. eCall). The brought-in devices usually focus on one customer segment and one specific use case.  Insurance  The data provided by greater vehicle connectivity is impacting the car insurance industry. Predictive-modeling and machine-learning technologies, as well as real-time data streaming, providing among others information on driving speed, routes and time, are changing insurers' doing-of-business. Early adopters have begun to adjust their offering to the developments in the automotive industry, leading them to transition from being pure insurance product provider to becoming insurance- service hybrids. Progressive, for example, has introduced its usage-based- insurance program, Snapshot, in 2008, which takes into account driving times and ability. The data gathered through an onboard diagnostics device allows the company to perform further personal and regional risk assessments. Another innovation being tested in the insurance industry regards telematics devices, which transmit vehicle and driver data through wide-area networks and are subsequently used to influence driving behavior, for legal purposes and the identification of fraudulent insurance claims. Further applications are dynamic risk profiles and improved customer segmentation. Future services include coaching on driving skills for fuel efficiency and safety reasons, the prediction of maintenance needs and providing advise to car owners regarding the best time to sell their car.  Trends  The following trends are strengthening the shift towards a fully developed connected cars industry, changing the concept of what is understood as a car and what are its functions. Technological innovation in the field of connectivity is accelerating. High-speed computers help make the car aware of its surroundings, which can transform manoeuvring a self-driving vehicle an increasing reality. There are initiatives to use ethernet technology to connect the sensors that allow for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Through the ethernet, network speed inside the vehicle can increase from one megabit to gigabits. Further, ethernet uses switches that allow connections to any number of devices, reducing the amount of cabling required and thus the overall weight of the car. Moreover, it is more scalable, allowing devices and sensors to connect at different speeds and has the benefit of components being available off the shelf. In fact, research also shows that customers are willing to switch manufacturers just to be able to use mobile devices and connectivity. In 2014 there were 21% who were willing to do so whereas in 2015 this number climbed up to 37%. On top of that 32% of those customers would also be ready to pay for a service related to connectivity on top on a base model. This figure has been at 21% in 2014, one year before. The increase of customers willing to switch manufacturers and to pay for such services shows the increase in importance for connected cars. The Internet of Things will be used to provide mobile services in the car with high-speed Internet. This feature will enable real time traffic control, interaction with the car manufacturer service for remote diagnostics and improved company logistics automation. Moreover, in the beginning of the self-driven car era, internet will be used for information exchange between the cars for better route selection and accident reports.  Criticism  = Drawbacks and Challenges = Although the connected car offers both benefits and excitement to the drivers, it also faces drawbacks and challenges; * A major issue with the connected cars is hackability. The more it is connected to the Internet and to the system, it becomes more exposed to being penetrated from the outside. If the service and help can be provided from distance by car-makers, through that channel, hackers can access and control the car as well. In Germany and Brazil, 59% of car drivers are afraid to be hacked into their car if it is connected to the Internet. In the U.S there are 43% and in China 53% whereas the average lies at 54%. * Reliability is also a major concern. Cars, sensor, and network hardware will malfunction. The system has to deal with incorrect data, as well as faulty communications, such as denial of service attacks. * Privacy is another dimension, both with hacking and with other uses. Sensitive data gathered from the car such as the location, driver's daily route, apps that are used, etc. are all susceptible to be hacked and used for unauthorised purposes,https://www.tomsguide.com/us/car-hacking-markey- report,news-20424.html as well as being used by businesses and government. In Germany for example 51% of car drivers do not want to use car-related connected services because they want to keep their privacy. In the U.S it is 45%, in Brazil 37% and in China 21% of the car drivers that think so. The average lies at 37%. * A simple failure in the system, whether in the connected car, or elsewhere in the network, while on the autonomous drive can cause fatal consequences. = Fighting the challenges = * Changing the design of products: the way that the product is developed and the \\"maintenance-respond-architecture\\" play a crucial role. Companies have to focus on long term solutions in terms of design security because quick changes are costly and easy to circumvent. Integrating this sphere at the earliest stage possible when developing the product can be the right approach for the companies. * Internal cooperation between departments of the company: product- security teams and corporate IT-security teams will have to work closely together in order to prevent the hackability of their devices. To do so, companies may create guidelines that minimize probabilities of bugs, and security gaps (software). Making modifying and patching systems easier can be another effect driven from that. * Over-the-air updates: As short term solutions are also easy to solve problems a technology called OTA (over-the- air) becomes more and more important to OEMs. These OTA updates allow companies to quickly detect problems/attacks and prevent the malefactors to become active and attack the system. However, this is a very costly approach and companies have to know the architecture of their systems in detail to directly attack the issue not to lose money on inefficiency. * Value chain security: As companies are the final integrators of security systems they also have to control security all along the value chain. Also suppliers have to make sure that security plays the most important role for the mobile device. Taking the example of the procurement department, it has to make sure that the cybersecurity features of the final product are negotiated and available. The whole security issue starts at the beginning of the value chain. This approach can be used to actually define and shape future security standards in the industry and make sure that every player in the industry has the same understanding of the importance of security.

Its plot follows Amelia, a moonshiner in rural 1930s Georgia who is visited by her former husband, recently released from prison. A co-production between the United States and Canada, the film's screenplay was written by Michael Hirst, adapted from the Edward Albee play, which in turn was based on a novella in a collection of short stories of the same title by American writer Carson McCullers. The film was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. Plot A lonely moonshiner named Miss Amelia dominates a small Georgia town. She changes in attitude and kindness as two men, Cousin Lymon (a small, hunchbacked man claiming to be Miss Amelia's cousin) and Marvin Macy (Miss Amelia's ex-husband) enter her life. Cast Production =Development= Actress Vanessa Redgrave championed screenwriter Michael Hirst's adaptation of the Edward Albee play (which itself was based on the novella by Carson McCullers), and her involvement in the project was integral to it receiving funding. Director Simon Callow found Albee's original play \\"too talkative\\" for the medium of film, and as a result, Hirst's screen adaptation features less dialogue. =Casting= Redgrave was cast in the role of Amelia from the production's outset. In preparing for the part, Redgrave made certain alterations to the character's appearance and manner: Willem Dafoe was considered for the part of Marvin, but demanded a salary too high for the film's budget. Keith Carradine was cast in the role instead. =Filming= Principal photography took place in the summer of 1990 in Spicewood, Texas, near Austin, as well as in Seguin, on a budget of $3 million. In order to perfect a Southern American accent from her native English accent, Redgrave studied with George Burns, an English professor at the University of Texas at Austin. She added, \\"Not only that, [George] knew how to wiggle and flap his ears, and he made an electrical device that, placed behind Cork Hubbert's ears, produced a wiggle for the camera that convinced all spectators that Cousin Lymon could flap his ears.\\" Release The film had its premiere at the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York City on March 28, 1991, before being released in the United States on May 8 of that year. =Critical reception= The Ballad of the Sad Caf√© was met with mixed reviews from critics. Roger Ebert praised the film, awarding it three out of four stars and writing: \\"All of this is about as believable as those breathless \\"Dateline America\\" reports you read in the British trash press about snake-worshipping cults in Louisiana Sunday schools. But it plays well, if you can dismiss from your mind any remote expectation that the behavior in the film will mirror life as we know it. And Vanessa Redgrave, imperious and vibrating with passion, makes a proud, sad Miss Amelia.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times was less enthusiastic about the film, writing: \\"Miss Redgrave was, is and will always remain one of the greatest actresses in what's generally referred to as the English-speaking theater. She is so great, in fact, that when she goes off the track, as she does here, she continues to barrel forward with the momentum of a transcontinental express train that will not be stopped.

It was listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties on November 15, 2000. In 2020 it was included as a contributing property in the Davenport Downtown Commercial Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. History The stone building in the back. The building was built in 1881 for the Davenport Plow Works. The property was formerly the location for First Presbyterian Church. The Classified Business Directory of August 1881 indicates the company was located at 310-324 W. 3rd Street. The 1886 Sanborn Fire Insurance map indicates that the building at 312 W. Third Street housed a machine shop, \\"setting up\\" and storage on all three floors of the front section. The stone structure attached to the rear of the building, built in 1857, housed polishing and grinding on the first floor and storage on the second floor. The rest of the Davenport Plow Works was in the building immediately to the west. After the plow works failed, Davenport attorney and real estate investor C.A. Ficke bought the building in 1889 and renovated it to lease to tenants. Various businesses have occupied the building. Peter A. Reimers and James Larkin occupied the building from 1898‚Äì1910, with P.A. Reimers, who manufactured cornices, skylights, slate, and metal roofs, occupying it for a further year. The Benner Tea Co. (1915‚Äì1918), Federal System of Bakeries (1920), the Chicago Butchers Market Co. (1925), Safe-Way Markets (1930), and Atlas Cigar (1940) all occupied the building. A nightclub by the name of the Carriage Haus now occupies the building. Architecture The building is three stories and constructed of brick in a restrained Italianate style. Its foundation is likely constructed of stone. There is a two-story structure attached to the rear. The brick portion of the building is rectangular in shape with a flat roof. The fa√ßade is divided into three parts: the storefront, the upper wall, and the cornice. The building retains its original dual entrances, which were not always recessed, and the exposed steel beam that separates the storefront from the top two stories. The windows on the upper floors are organized in two sets of three on both floors. It emphasizes the two sides of the building. Each window features a segmentally arched header and a stone sill. The cornice is composed of patterned brickwork. The stone structure in the back is a rectangular vernacular structure that features a hipped roof. The double-hung windows are the dominant feature of the structure. Company The Woeber Brothers Carriage Works was formed when Adam Woeber acquired his brothers' Davenport-based wagon manufacturing firm in 1872, which had been operating since the 1850s. The company specialized in building commercial wagons as well as other vehicles and heavy equipment.

Among these projects was the Mus√©e-Maison de la culture du Havre, an innovative museum built between 1955 and 1960. Career outline Born in 1926, Dimitrijevic joined the French army during World War II (1939‚Äì1945). After the war, he began working as an apprentice architect in 1947, and became a junior partner at the Atelier LWD, an architectural firm created by Guy Lagneau and Michel Weill in 1952. He studied under Guy Lagneau at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, graduating as an architect planner in 1957. In 1959 he studied for a year at the Department of Architecture at MIT in the United States. During the thirty years of activity at LWD, the studio won many awards, serving private firms and the state with a complete process of design and implementation of architecture and overall urban planning. The studio was recognized as highly innovative. Work in Africa Houses at Cansado, Mauritania. Dimitrijevic was involved in several projects in Africa, including the LWD's first project, the 1953 design of the H√¥tel de France in Conakry, Guinea. In this building the architects created a frame building with concrete walls lined with precast granite, with rooms designed to promote natural ventilation. Other projects including planning the mineral port of Bok√© in Guinea (1955), the city of Ta√Øba Mbaye in Senegal (1957), the Sandgarejdi mine in Guinea (1957), the development plan for Abidjan in C√¥te d'Ivoire (1959) and a program for industrial expansion in Cameroon (1964). Dimitrijevic was in charge of design, planning and construction of the mining town of Cansado in Mauritania between 1959 and 1963, with 750 furnished houses. For the sake of economy, there were few French workers, mostly Moors, Canary Islanders and Senegalese. The project was logistically and technically demanding. Construction used precast lightweight concrete blocks imported from Senegal, and other concrete forms such as joists and railings that were manufactured on the site. Import of manufactured goods was kept to the minimum. The city, built quickly, gave an impression of strength and architectural cohesion. Work in France Dimitrijevic worked with Lagneau, Weill and Raymond Audigler on the design of the Museum of Modern Art at Le Havre, a box of glass, steel and aluminum with light, flexible spaces. The building was awarded the Prix Reynolds in 1962. It marked the start of a long collaboration with Jean Prouv√© and Charlotte Perriand. Lagneau, Weill, Dimitrijevic, Prouv√© and Perriand collaborated on the Maison de Sahara in 1958, a prototype developed in Paris in 1958 showing an innovative approach to solving the problem of extreme heat. The prototype building included cabins that were air-conditioned in the daytime and open to the desert at night, contained within a tent that provided the central living space. Later work included the Prefecture and the Palace of Justice of √âvry, Essonne, with Weill and Lagneau in 1975. He designed the Marinas of Cogolin in the Var department, a new departure for Dimitrijevic, and collaboration on the 120,000 square metres (1,300,000 sq ft) Quatre-Temps shopping center in La D√©fense, a business district of Paris, which opened in 1981.

This product introduced the Birthright campaign setting. Contents The Birthright Campaign Setting contains three books, a ref screen, two maps, over 100 cards to use for playing out large battles, and a dozen reference cards, all in full color. The set includes a new system for resolving large battles between fantasy armies, using cards to represent various regiments and a position sheet to indicate things such as which side is holding the line and which is on the flank. The set includes the concept of bloodlines, hereditary magical powers which tie a family line to various domains in the form of land, temples, or political organizations. People with strong bloodlines make natural leaders, and while great, valorous deeds can enhance a character's bloodline and increase the character's power, failure can cause a character's bloodline to wane. These powerful characters have powerful foes, known as the awnsheghlien, the champions of the world's evil bloodlines. Also described are \\"domain turns\\", three months periods of time for a domain during which background events occur. The campaign was later recognised as the first setting to support player characters as rulers, providing players with a game based on \\"diplomacy, politics, trade, construction and (of course) war\\".Pook, Matthew.

Contents Pages from the Mages features incantations for the Forgotten Realms campaign. The book's general format consists of describing a number of spell books currently in existence in the campaign world. Pages from the Mages gives brief histories of each of these books, along with the backgrounds behind their creators and hints as to where the books may now be found. While most of these books also contain commonly known spells, those spells detailed here are for the most part unique, with many of them bearing their inventor's names. Many of these tomes have been highly sought after and contested for some time. Also in the book are a few priest spells; instructions for creating a handful of magic items; and details of new monsters. Publication history Pages from the Mages was the 8th prestige-format \\"FOR\\" (Forgotten Realms) sourcebook published between 1990 and 1995, however, it did not have a module code and it was the first in the series that did not have the traditional black-bordered gloss-on-matte cover. Pages from the Mages was a soft-bound volume published by TSR. It was designed by Ed Greenwood and Tim Beach, and was published in 1995. The cover design was by Renee Ciske, black and white art by Valerie Valusek and interior four color art by Ned Dameron and Erik Olson. The content of the book originated in Dragon magazine ‚Äî Greenwood had been intrigued by named spells \\"because, he has stated, they made him wonder about their origins: why they'd been created, who their creator was, and how they'd gained their name. He knew the meta-game reason, of course: They matched Jack Vance's naming convention for spells. However, he wanted to know more about their in- game history. This led Greenwood to write 'Pages from the Mages' for Dragon #62 (June 1982). It described four spellbooks, including notes on their appearance and their history. Greenwood purposefully revealed mysterious lore within these histories that would lead players to glimpse a larger world. [...] All told, everything about the books was detailed, so that a GM could pick one up and drop it straight into a dungeon\\". Greenwood wrote \\"a total of five articles running through Dragon #100 (August 1985)\\" with several encore articles in Dragon #164 (December 1990) and Dragon #181 (May 1992). Then in the 1990s, Beach took on TSR's project of turning the series of articles and additional work Greenwood had done for The Magister (1988) into a new book for the 2nd Edition. This included converting spells and other mechanics to work in the newer edition. \\"Greenwood wasn't aware of the Pages from the Mages book until shortly before it was published, at which time he was asked to write the introduction\\". Reception Cliff Ramshaw reviewed Pages from the Mages for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. He felt that there is \\"no reason why, in most cases, you can't adapt the new spells it provides to suit your own campaign, but much of the background material - and in many case this is the best stuff - will of course have to be changed\\". He cautions, after explaining about the background information on the books and their creators: \\"If you needed further convincing that the life of a wizard is a dangerous one, liable to be terminated quickly and violently, then you'll find it here.\\" He suggests that tracking down one of these spell books \\"should involve a fair amount of adventuring by the players\\", and that a character using spells from these books \\"is bound to create a stir\\". Ramshaw concludes the review: \\"Some spells are more useful than others [...] and some can most kindly be described as space-fillers. [...] Not as inspiring as most releases, Pages from the Mages can only be recommended to those who've thoroughly exhausted the existing spell lists.\\" Shannon Appelcline, the author of Designers & Dragons, wrote \\"Pages from the Mages contains lots of Realms history, though most of it had previously appeared in Dragon magazine. [...] Elminster's Traveling Spellbook provides a detailed look at the spells of F√¢erun's chief mage\\". Appelcline also highlighted that the book's origins in the 'Pages from the Mages' article series was important because the articles \\"brought Ed Greenwood's Forgotten Realms into the limelight. Greenwood sometimes referenced his campaign world in his Dragon articles, but the 'Pages from the Mages' articles took that tendency to the next level. They were introduced by a never-before-seen wizard named Elminster, and the histories of the spell books gave more details of Realms history than ever before. When TSR was looking for a new campaign world in the mid-80s, Jeff Grubb remembered Greenwood's 'Pages from the Mages' articles, and that's how the Forgotten Realms came to TSR\\". On the 'Pages from the Mages' series, Jesse Decker, editor-in-chief of Dragon from 1999 to 2003, said in an interview \\"It's hard to impart how powerfully I reacted to those articles. I was overwhelmed with the idea that you could make new spells. The realization that you could actually implement your own ideas in the game was just amazing to me. Up until that point, everything I knew about games said that the rules all came from the box. 'Pages from the Mages' changed my world a little bit\\".

Beam waveguide antennas are used in large radio telescopes and satellite communication stations as an alternative to the most common parabolic antenna design, the conventional \\"front fed\\" parabolic antenna. In front feed, the antenna feed, the small antenna that transmits or receives the radio waves reflected by the dish, is suspended at the focus, in front of the dish. However, this location causes a number of practical difficulties. In high performance systems, complex transmitter and receiver electronics must be located at the feed antenna. This feed equipment usually requires high maintenance; some examples are water cooling for transmitters and cryogenic cooling for sensitive receivers. With the large dishes used in these systems, the focus is high off the ground, and servicing requires cranes or scaffolds, and outdoor work with delicate equipment high off the ground. Furthermore, the feeds themselves have to be designed to handle outdoor conditions such as rain and large temperature swings, and to work while tipped at any angle. The beam waveguide antenna addresses these problems by locating the feed antenna in a \\"feed house\\" at the base of the antenna, instead of in front of the dish. The radio waves collected by the dish are focused into a beam and reflected by metal surfaces in a path through the supporting structure to the stationary feed antenna at the base. The path is complicated because the beam must pass through both axes of the altazimuth mount of the antenna, so turning the antenna does not disturb the beam. History An example one of the practical difficulties that led to the introduction of beam waveguide antennas. Here a cherry picker type truck is needed to allow workers to re-load liquid helium into a pre-amplifier mounted at the prime focus of a radio telescope.Chapter 3 of Low-Noise Systems in the Deep Space Network Beam waveguides, which propagate a microwave beam using a series of reflectors, were proposed as early as 1964. By 1968, there were proposals to handle some of the signal path in pointable antennas by these techniques.MILLIMETER-WAVE PROPAGATION AND SYSTEMS CONSIDERATIONS Aerospace report TR-0200(4230-46)-1, L.A. Hoffman, Electronics Research Lab, October 1968, page 69. By 1970, a fully beam- waveguide approach was proposed for satellite communication antennas. At first, it was believed the complicated signal path with its multiple reflecting surfaces would result in unacceptable signal loss but further analysis showed the waveguide system could be built with very low losses. The first full scale beam waveguide antenna was the 64 meter antenna at the Usuda Deep Space Center, Japan, built in 1984 by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. After the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) tested this antenna and found it better than their conventional 64-meter antennas, they too switched to this method of construction for all subsequent antennas of their Deep Space Network (DSN).

Contents The mist-shrouded netherworld of the Nightmare Lands lies on the borders of Ravenloft's Demiplane of Dread. Here, the Nightmare Court seeks out and traps dreamers in \\"dreamscapes\\", where their secret feelings are amplified to intolerable proportions so that the Court can feed on their fears. Such dreamers are mentally assaulted nightly, and rapidly become insane unless the Nightmare being conducting the torture can be defeated. The Nightmare Lands includes four books: \\"Book One: Journal of Doctor Illhousen\\", \\"Book Two: Rules of Dreams and Nightmares\\", \\"Book Three: Book of Nightmares\\" and the \\"Monstrous Supplement\\". The \\"Journal of Doctor Illhousen\\" introduced players to the concept of Nightmare adventures, and tells them how to reach the Nightmare Lands - both physically and as dream beings - in order to aid those held by the Nightmare Court. The journal outlines the reality shifting nature of this world. The \\"Rules of Dreams and Nightmares\\" fully explains the complexities of Nightmare adventures, as well as the key principle of Mental Fortitude, which is a character's self-confidence in the character's \\"dreamself\\"; Mental Fortitude is increased by facing the character's worst nightmare, eventually allowing the character to break free of the Court. The \\"Book of Nightmares\\" and \\"Monstrous Supplement\\" combine to provide an off-the-shelf scenario for parties adventuring in the Nightmare Lands.

The box cover artist was Den Beauvais, and the book cover and interior artist was John Snyder. Reception Trenton Webb reviewed The Nightmare Lands for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. He refers to the \\"Journal of Doctor Illhousen\\" as \\"sketchy and theoretical\\", and felt that the \\"Book of Nightmares\\" and the \\"Monstrous Supplement\\" together \\"flesh out the Nightmare Lands into a truly horrific place to explore (and to DM)\\". He comments on the set as a whole: \\"The ideas behind the Nightmare Lands are intriguing and exciting. They provide an arena in which a party of any level can truly be tested.\\" He felt that the appeal of the Nightmare Court was \\"limited by its inevitable association with the gothic Ravenloft\\", but that in this setting \\"it works well and all Ravenloft DMs should be encouraged to give their parties a bad night's sleep every once in a while\\". He cautions that the ready-to-run scenario Nightmares \\"may not sit readily with heroes from other places and planes in the multiverse\\". Webb outlines his concerns with the running of a Nightmare Lands campaign, where \\"the worst problems can arise. Mental Fortitude is a good system, but it requires better examples, better explanation and easy-access tables or checklists before it can function effectively. Further, the very plumed nature of Nightmare reality causes continued questions for the DM and impairs the necessary suspension of disbelief for the players.\\" He concludes the review by saying: The Nightmare Lands is a brave attempt to add another element to D&D; adventures. It conjures a scary new world where absolutely anything and everything can happen.

Background  It is not known when Gu Yanlang was born. According to his biography in the New Book of Tang, he was from Feng Prefecture (Ë±êÂ∑û, in modern Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia). Both he and his younger brother Gu Yanhui served as junior officers at Tiande (Â§©Âæ∑, in modern Bayan Nur). The defender of Tiande, Cai Jing (Ëî°‰∫¨), considered both of them to have appearances that indicated that they would be later successful, and therefore had his son give them money. During the subsequent major agrarian rebellion led by Huang Chao, Gu Yanlang and Gu Yanhui served in the campaign against Huang and participated in Tang's recapture of the capital Chang'an from Huang. Gu Yanlang was subsequently made a general of the imperial guards.New Book of Tang, vol. 186.  As military governor  In 887, then-reigning Emperor Xizong made Gu Yanlang the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. When he reached Jianmen (ÂäçÈñÄ, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan) on the way to his post, the subordinates of Chen Jingxuan the military governor of neighboring Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) seized the staff that Emperor Xizong bestowed on him and refused him entry toward Dongchuan, and he was forced to stay at Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan) for some time. Only after further negotiations by imperial emissaries did Chen allow Gu to report to Dongchuan. Once he got there, he made his brother Gu Yanhui the prefect of Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan). Meanwhile, a former colleague of Gu Yanlang's in the imperial guards corps, Wang Jian, had seized Lang Prefecture (Èñ¨Â∑û, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan) and claimed the title of prefect, and was sending the troops under him to raid the nearby regions. Gu feared Wang's potential raids, and therefore frequently sent emissaries to Wang to affirm their friendship and to give Wang gifts; as a result, Wang did not raid Dongchuan. Chen became apprehensive that Gu and Wang might join their forces and attack Xichuan. Chen's brother, the former paramount eunuch Tian Lingzi, who had previously adopted Wang as a son, suggested that he would be able to summon Wang to serve under Chen. Chen agreed, and Tian subsequently wrote a letter inviting Wang to serve under Chen. Wang, receiving Tian's summons, initially indicated that he agreed, and he left his family at Dongchuan's capital Zi Prefecture (Ê¢ìÂ∑û) with Gu, while he himself headed toward Xichuan's capital Chengdu. However, while Wang was on his way, Chen's subordinate Li Ai (Êùé‰πÇ) persuaded Chen that Wang could not be trusted, and Chen tried to stop Wang. Wang, however, would not stop, and he defeated officers Chen sent to stop him and proceeded to Chengdu. Gu then launched an army under Gu Yanhui's command to aid Wang. They put Chengdu under siege, but could not capture it, so they lifted the siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. Wang, however, continued the campaign against Chen, and he raided and seized a number of prefectures of Xichuan Circuit. After Emperor Xizong died in 888 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Zhaozong‚Äîwho had despised Tian‚ÄîWang submitted a petition to Emperor Zhaozong that argued that Chen and Tian were renegades against imperial rule and that the imperial government should launch a campaign against them, and Gu joined Wang's petition as well. Emperor Zhaozong thereafter commissioned the chancellor Wei Zhaodu as the new military governor of Xichuan and summoned Chen back to Chang'an to serve as a general of the imperial guards. When Chen refused, Emperor Zhaozong declared a general campaign against Chen, with Wei in command and Gu, Wang, and Yang Shouliang the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) serving as Wei's deputies. The campaign lasted for years. By 891, Chen was in a desperate state, but the imperial government's resources had become drained due to a recent defeat in a campaign against another warlord, Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Emperor Zhaozong decided to end the campaign against Chen; he issued an edict restoring Chen's offices and ordering Gu and Wang to withdraw their troops. Wang, however, saw that Chen was near defeat, and he intimidated Wei into returning to Chang'an and leaving him in command of the operations. Chen and Tian surrendered, and Wang became the military governor of Xichuan. Soon thereafter, Gu died, and Gu Yanhui took over as the acting military governor of Dongchuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258.

It is located in Beaver Creek Township and was once a small lumbering town. Pere Cheney was the first community in Crawford County, Michigan and was established by lumberjacks who trailed the Jackson, Lansing and Saginaw Railroad north headed for Mackinaw City.

It had a station on the Michigan Central Railroad called the Cheney depot, and a post office. The post office closed in 1912, and the village was abandoned in the early Twentieth century. It has since taken on the reputation of a ghost town. History Pere Cheney was established in 1873, as founder George Cheney received a land grant from the Michigan Central Railroad company to establish a stop along the railroad. A general store was established along with sawmills, carpenters, a doctor, hotel with a telegraph service and a post office. In the mid-1870s, the population was approximately 1,500 people. In 1893, diphtheria spread through the town, wiping out a great deal of the town's population. Diphtheria recurred in 1897, by 1901 the town's population fell to only 25 people and in 1917 there were only 18 people left in this once booming town. At that time, the land was sold off in a public auction and the town was declared a ghost town. In more recent news about Pere Cheney, on Friday, October 16, 2009 a group of teens who had gathered at the Pere Cheney Cemetery were confronted by a white male in his 50s. The man brandished and fired a shotgun at the teens. \\"We have had a ton of complaints over the years,\\" said Crawford County Sheriff Kirk Wakefield, who encouraged people to stay out of the cemetery. \\"There's always something going in the Pere Cheney Cemetery.\\" http://www.crawfordcountyavalanche.com/articles/2009/10/21/news/doc4adf40ade927f381451957.txt In March 2015, it was announced that there are plans to restore the cemetery to its former glory.http://www.crawfordcountyavalanche.com/articles/2015/03/19/news/doc550974285b5f7444189390.txt To this day, Pere Cheney remains Number 2 on the Top 10 Witch Graves in the Midwest, topped only by Bloody Mary of Indiana. The cemetery is owned by Beaver Creek Township, Michigan and is maintained by the township. Reputation as 'ghost town' There are many stories surrounding the ghost town of Pere Cheney as well as the cemetery itself. Ghosts, witches, strange figures, glowing orbs, and mysterious lights in the trees all feature. People have said to have heard children laughing while there and returning to their cars having handprints on them. Some say that Pere Cheney was a cursed town from the start, as it was built on Native American land. The cemetery is down a two track road and runs along some railroad tracks, hidden in the woods. There is no sign at the cemetery, and no signs indicating that it exists. A little farther north is the town of Pere Cheney, which is to be considered a Ghost Town. At least 90 people were buried in the Pere Cheney Cemetery, but, due to vandalism, very few headstones remain. Some sort of disease; cholera, or diphtheria was said to have wiped out the entire town in the early 20th century. According to local legends, a witch cursed the village of Pere Cheney after being banished to the woods, hence the reasoning behind the mass outbreaks of disease in the area.Top 10 Witch Graves in the Midwest ‚Äì Mysterious Heartland The only thing that grows in the town is a green mossy grass. And according to some accounts, the entire town is haunted. Most of the information about Pere Cheney states that people from nearby towns had tried to burn the town down to stop the disease from reaching them, but there is no information to support it. The disease came twice two years apart. The remaining people dragged their belongings to what we know now as Grayling.

It is a cabinet of mineralogy which was assembled by Nathaniel Gottfried Leske. History =Purchase= Early in 1792 a committee of the Royal Dublin Society was appointed to bid for the purchase of the cabinet of mineralogy assembled by Nathaniel Gottfried Leske and known as the Leskean Cabinet, then for sale. A sum of ¬£1200 was voted for this purpose, but the total cost was about ¬£1250. 1 On 8 November 1792 Dr. Richard Kirwan, who had negotiated the purchase of this cabinet, reported that it was then lodged at the Society‚Äôs warehouse at Poolbeg Street, then at Hawkins Street. Also curated there were the Society‚Äôs collections of art, archaeology, zoological and botanical specimens. The collection After Leske‚Äôs death in 1786 his collection was systematically revised and described by Dietrich Ludwig Gustav Karsten in 1789. Richard Kirwan made further revisions in the 1790s. The collection of 7331 mineral specimens was divided into five separate parts : ‚Äî 1. External character of minerals. 2. Classification of minerals. 3. Earth's internal structure (or geological). 4. Mineralogical geography. 5. Economical mineralogy. In addition the collection contained zoological specimens including many type specimens from the collection of Johann Friedrich Gmelin In 1795 William Higgins was made professor of chemistry and mineralogy to the Dublin Society and the Leskean cabinet was placed under his care. It was open to students, and rules regulating admission were printed. A chemical laboratory was established, and Higgins was instructed to make experiments. Public exhibition Part of the collection was on display along with additions in the Museum of the Dublin Society.

DIANE was a grassroots driven regional videoconferencing consortium which promoted and supported cooperative electronic alliances in education, community service, and economic development. Created in 1992 in Nashville, Tennessee, Project DIANE was in active operation as a centrally managed public service network until 2006. Portions of the network still remain in service, however, though no longer under the Project DIANE moniker. Peak network membership consisted of more than 200 participating organizations and more than 350 program and technical coordinators, supporting live interactive video programming over a service region consisting of twelve U.S. states and five countries. History Project DIANE was first proposed by Dr. Stephen P. Shao, Jr. in 1992 as a regional diversity development project collaboration between the U.S. Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and a small consortium of public and private universities located within TVA's six state service region. At the time, Dr. Shao was employed as a business research center director at Tennessee State University in Nashville, Tennessee. After a year of deliberations and two successful community based field pilots, Project DIANE was given startup funding by the TVA. The two field pilots, named the Nashville Pilot and the City Share Pilot were instrumental in demonstrating that videoconferencing technology was a viable and highly flexible mechanism through which to deliver a broad array of educational, economic development and public service resources to the general public. Both pilots were carried out with the participation of several dozen community service organizations, governmental agencies and corporations. Primary sponsors and underwriters of the two pilots included TVA, BellSouth, IBM led by Steven Wilkinson, and PictureTel (later purchased by Polycom). The Nashville Pilot was an intracity test of desktop videoconferencing technology with application test sites in Nashville, Tennessee constructed at Tennessee State University, Cumberland Science Museum (later renamed the Adventure Science Center) and the Looby Public Library. One month after conclusion of the Nashville Pilot, the City Share Pilot testbed was created by connecting the three Nashville video test locations to additional video sites constructed in Huntsville, Alabama. A large portfolio of community oriented and educational test applications between Nashville and Huntsville were launched with a 40-minute discussion of intercity cooperation between the mayors of the cities. It is believed that the City Share pilot was the first ever intercity videoconference link ever constructed for non-commercial purposes. In the years following the project's pilot startup, many public and private organizations participated in the network's public service programming and donated both in-kind and financial resources. Network participants and supporters were also successful in securing a wide bevy of public and private grants to pay for different types of community applications which utilized the project.  Overview  = Project objectives = Project DIANE's primary objectives were to: # develop a successful electronic community service network that could be expanded and/or replicated by all interested members of the community, # bring education institutions, business development agencies, and community service organizations closer together for cooperative sharing of scarce public and private resources and # provide needy individuals and groups with free, or low cost, digital access to useful information, assistance and professional expertise. There were two notable aspects about the network. First, the project was designed as a broad-based, rather than niche-focused, community telecollaboration. DIANE membership reflected a wide spectrum of community organizations which came together online to jointly plan and carry out public programs and services. The project was represented by most segments of the community, both in an organizational context (e.g., schools, community centers, libraries, business agencies, etc.) and individually (child through senior adult, families, handicapped, urban and rural, etc.) DIANE was inherently a \\"project of projects\\" with teleconferencing applications in the three target areas of education, community service and economic development. A second key aspect of this project was that, from its inception, DIANE members worked diligently to include disadvantaged or neglected members of society in consortium program development activities. The avoidance of a two-tier cyber- society of \\"haves\\" vs. \\"have-nots\\" was a high priority. DIANE members took special care to include low income inner city residents, developmentally disabled children, senior citizens, speech and hearing impaired individuals, and other potential information highway have-nots in program development activities. = Participants = Online members of the consortium included family and community centers, speech & hearing treatment centers, K-12 schools, zoos, museums, public libraries, universities, language institutes, skill training centers, chambers of commerce, economic development agencies, healthcare groups, overseas military bases & dependents schools, and other service organizations. Specific notable members of the project included the Small Business Administration sponsored Small Business Development Centers, the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, the Adventure Science Center, Vanderbilt University, the Tennessee Foreign Language Institute, Tennessee League for the Deaf & Hard of Hearing, the Nashville Zoo, the Metropolitan Action Commission, Urban League of Nashville, the Boys & Girls Club, the Girl Scouts of Middle Tennessee, the Catholic Diocese of Nashville, the Tennessee State Library & Archives, the Elephant Sanctuary of Hohenwald, the Nashville Public Library System, the Bank of America Small Business Resource Centers, and the U.S. Department of Defense Overseas Dependents School System. = Real-time telecollaboration = Telecollaboration was inherently the method by which DIANE organizations educated and assisted one another. Real-time telecollaboration took place in all project activities through two-way electronic exchanges between a resource provider (such as a K-12 teacher, college professor, business counselor, social worker, therapist, or other expert professional) and a person in need (e.g., student, small/minority business entrepreneur, researcher, family member, handicapped person, senior citizen, etc.). Real-time multimedia information exchanges occurred during videoconferences via electronic whiteboards, remote application sharing, electronic messaging, hi-speed file transfer and other means.  Programs and applications  DIANE's program portfolio included various independent and inter-dependent telecollaborations, offering resources and assistance to both mainstream and disadvantaged community segments. In addition to the general program descriptions given in this section, interested parties were able to click to the Project DIANE Directory and read the \\"DIANE Program & Resource Profile\\" for each individual organization. General teleconference based program areas established by the project included: the Economic Development Partnership, Tennessee Child Development Partnership, Teachers' Teleconferencing Curriculum Forum, Internet Distance Training, Global Community Project, and others. Examples of specific program activities within these general program areas included the following: The Tennessee League for the Hearing Impaired offered videoconferencing-based Deaf culture workshops, sign language instruction, and translation services. Looby Metro Public Library supported a distance mentorship program called \\"Adopt-a-Grandparent\\" in which senior citizen library volunteers provide guidance and counseling to disadvantaged youth who called in from DIANE's community center locations. Therapists and physicians at the Bill Wilkerson Speech & Hearing Center and the Vanderbilt Child Development Center electronically assisted disabled children, including adolescents with autism and related communication disorders. High school students and teachers regularly consulted online with the project's educational resources such as the Cumberland Science Museum (e.g., for science information, environmental workshops, etc.) and to Meharry Medical College (e.g., to learn about viruses), etc. = Electronic field trips = The use of videoconferencing technology to electronically and interactively take students to exotic and faraway places was pioneered by Project DIANE. An important supplement to in-class instruction, schoolchildren frequently were able to go on electronic field trips through the DIANE network for meaningful interactive real-world learning experiences. The Nashville Zoo conducted videoconferences with area schools to bring students safe interactive experiences with rare snow leopards and other wild animals. Animal conservationists from the Elephant Sanctuary in Lewis County, TN provided teleconference-based seminars on elephants and the need for animal preservation, even connecting video callers to remote cameras located in the elephant grazing pasture. Radnor Lake State Natural Area offered students a wide range of teleconference activities involving environmental conservation, water ecology, and wireless video/underwater camera views of its wildlife residents. Often, Project DIANE electronic field trips took the children to international locations such as France, England, Japan, or to meet interesting people such as jet pilots, film actors and corporate executives. The Tennessee Foreign Language Institute conducted world culture seminars and foreign language instruction to DIANE participants, also providing students remote playback access to its 250+ international tape library. Tennessee's state information repository, the Tennessee State Library & Archives, provided interactive teleconference-based history seminars, library reference assistance, and live curator based video access to its rare manuscript collection, includes original American Civil War photographs, historic architectural drawings, original letters of President Andrew Jackson, the 1796 Tennessee State Constitution, etc. = Connecting students to experts outside the classroom = Connected schools and community centers teleconferenced with the local public library for story telling hour and puppet shows, with NationsBank's Small Business Resource Center and the Nashville Area Chamber for youth career planning and entrepreneurship programs, and with Meharry Medical College for health and hygiene workshops. An advanced placement (AP) course shared curriculum was being developed for use by area high schools. Current AP course development included environmental science and biology. Regarding business development programs, any area business with compatible technologies could access Project DIANE's online economic development member agencies, including SBRC business experts, SBRC library resources, SBDC business counselors, area chamber of commerce program personnel, university business faculty, etc. = Awards and recognitions = International recognitions of Project DIANE included: Polycom Corporation‚Äôs Exceptional Content Provider Award (8/03), a Top 5 Rating by the European Commission's Global Bangemann Challenge (Stockholm, 6/99); 6 NII Global Information Infrastructure award citations (12/96-2/98) including an AT&T; Special Telecollaboration Award; a \\"national success story\\" citation by the President's National Information Advisory Council (2/96), and an Awards Laureate designation by the Smithsonian Institution Information Technology Awards Program (6/95). Key invited presentations and demonstrations of Project DIANE programming include national conferences and forums hosted by the American Library Association (Atlanta, GA, 6/02), National Science Foundation (Berkeley, CA, 12/00), U.S. Dept of Commerce (Washington DC, 4/98) and the White House (Philadelphia PA, 4/97).  Technology evolution  Project DIANE began as an all Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) BRA based community network using desktop personal computers deploying an H.320 codec, which later evolved into a hybrid switched digital and Internet IP based H.320/H.324 platform. The videoconferencing equipment used by Project DIANE in the Nashville and City Share startup field pilots were all OS/2 based videoconference units (PCS/1s) provided through a joint development partnership at the time between PictureTel and the IBM Corporation. These early video units were replaced during the startup phase with Windows OS-based PC desktop units. In later years, the project's infrastructure also included a large number of set top videoconference units, as well as several dozen videoconferencing units for conference rooms. In the late 1990s, a large corporate donation of more than a hundred new videoconference units more than doubled the size of DIANE to more than two hundred video locations. Project DIANE also later acquired a Tandberg Multipoint Control Unit (MCU), sometimes referred to as a video bridge or gateway, which allowed the network to deliver its interactive programming to up to 16 separate locations simultaneously. Funding for the MCU's required network connections (a Primary Rate Access high speed digital telephone line and an IP broadband access line) was provided by Tennessee State University and the Tennessee Department of Human Services, Rehabilitation Services Division.

Disposable towels are primarily used for drying and sanitation purposes. They were first popularised by the hospital supply industry, but are now relatively common in resorts, hotels, beauty salons, day cares and similar fields. The main advantage that disposable towels offer is the hygiene and cleanliness that they guarantee for each user. Often, they are made from recycled content, and can be used to produce new towels after use. Disposable towels are essential in hospitals for providing a sterile drape for minor medical procedures and for their ability to quickly remedy spills. Disposable towels also save hotel and salon owners time and money by preventing the necessity of washing and drying using slower traditional methods. Some hairdressers implement the use of ordinary towels on consumers which they then re-use for their next clients and this has the potential to spread a variety of skin and hair diseases. Health professionals recommend the use of disposable towels to minimise the risk of contamination and the spread of harmful contagions. Through the use of one-time disposable towels, we are able to minimise the unpleasant repercussions of reusing old and unsanitary towels.The advantages disposable towels presents are manifold and are applicable to a wide range of setting from medical to domestic and cosmetic uses.

Contents Treasure Tales is a collection of 16 short adventure scenarios for AD&D.; Each adventure is split between player information, DM's notes, map, and a picture for setting the scene. The player's page introduces the adventure's setting and its pertinent legends and characters, while the DM's page walks through each map and details the main enemies and what treasure can be found where. Publication history Reception Trenton Webb reviewed Treasure Tales for Arcane magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. He comments that \\"brevity is the order of the day here. Each scenario builds upon a single simple concept, primarily a horde of cash and what the party needs to do to get hold of it. There's no room for cosmetics, so each potential adventure stands or falls solely on the strength of its core idea.\\" He identifies \\"Dragon And The Lady\\" as the best of the 16 adventures, as it \\"works because it is simply a great twist on the oldest of D&D; premises\\" and points out \\"The Lair of the Pirate King\\" as it \\"packs a delightful kick-yourself-for-not-spotting-it- secret\\", noting that scenarios such as these \\"are just what burnt out referees need to rekindle their imagination. Fast, to the point, and fun to run as well as play.\\" However, he considers these the exceptions, positing that \\"it's obvious why so many of the hordes in Treasure Tales lay peacefully undisturbed - it's not that they are too dangerous to recover, it's just that they're far too dull to bother with. Adventures should be about heroic victory against massive odds, not gradual attrition of yet another randomly placed Lizard Man tribe.\\" Webb concludes the review by saying: \\"En masse, the Treasure Tales are bland and lack subtlety. The best adventures are restricted by their necessarily potent foes, while in the lower levels there are more mapping exercises than legends waiting to happen. The good ones may prove useful for one-nighters while your Paladin's on holiday in Benidorm, but that's about the limit of Treasure Tales' appeal.\\" Reviews *Dragon #232 References Dungeons & Dragons books ","title":"Treasure Tales"},{"id":"31250851","text":"Mike Jones (born 1971) is an American screenwriter and journalist.

The head is strongly rounded, the thorax is elongated in a sort of long neck (propleura), which separates the head from the body. Also the abdomen is strongly stretched, broader at the posterior end and placed on the upper chest (propodeum). The colour of the abdomen is black, with reddish-orange rings. The tibiae of the hind legs are club shaped. In the female the ovipositor is usually very long with a white tip. In resting position, these wasps slowly and rhythmically raise and lower the abdomen. Life cycle  The females of this parasitic wasp lays its eggs by its long ovipositor on the body of larvae of solitary bees or wasps. On hatching its young larvae will devour grubs and supplies of pollen and nectar of its victim. The adults grow up to long and can mostly be encountered from May through September feeding on Apiaceae species. Habitat Gasteruption jaculator has been found visiting various flowers, or hovering around the nests of solitary bees and wasps in gardens and meadows.

He became known as \\"The Irving of the music halls\\".  Early years  Williams in about 1909 Born in Hackney, London, the son of William Meshech Pharez and Margaret Giles (n√©e Booth), Bransby Williams began his working life as a tea taster in Mincing Lane before working in the design department of a wallpaper manufacturer.Williams, Bransby Bransby Williams by Himself Hutchinson, London (1954) p. 18 He appeared as an amateur actor before turning professional doing impersonations of Dan Leno, Gus Elen, Joe Elvin, Albert Chevalier and other music hall stars in working men's clubs. His first appearance in a music hall was at The London Music Hall in Shoreditch on 26 August 1896, during which he gave impersonations of the leading actors of that time, including Henry Irving in The Bells, Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Svengali from the popular play Trilby, adapted from George Du Maurier's novel of the same name. In 1897 Williams first created a variety of characters, including many from the works of Dickens such as Mr Micawber, Uriah Heep, Bill Sikes and Fagin. In 1898 he appeared as Sydney Carton in The Noble Deed, based on A Tale of Two Cities at the Oxford Theatre.Williams (1954) p. 42 He performed in monologues, recitations and sketches, including the Lounger and The Green Eye of the Yellow God.Profile of Bransby Williams on 'Footlight Notes'  Actor-manager  Williams became a great success, and he appeared before King Edward VII at Sandringham House in a Royal Command Performance on 3 December 1903, when he performed the characters from Dickens as well as his impersonations of famous actors and comedians of the day. In 1905 and 1907 he toured in the United States. In 1922 Williams toured the UK with his own company as actor-manager, performing in a series of plays based on Dickens, including David Copperfield, Oliver Twist and Barnaby Rudge. In 1923 he purchased the stock of the late Sir Henry Irving, which he used in his tour of The Lyons Mail and in March of that year he played Hamlet for the first time at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Birmingham. Later he also bought the stock of Laurence and H.B.

It was located west of Fairbanks, Alaska. History Unalakleet AFS was a continental defence radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. In 1957, 622 acres were acquired approximately 3 miles northeast of Unalakleet, Alaska for construction of the station. Using the existing port facilities at the settlement, Naval LST's and towed barges were able to land of construction equipment and material, which was transported along a gravel road to the construction site. The completed station consisted of about 25 buildings and miscellaneous support structures . on a hilly site to the west of the radar station, which was located on top of a hill at 900' elevation. The station buildings were, except for the civil engineering building connected by heated hallways. As a result, personnel stationed there, with only very few exceptions, were able to wear \\"summer\\" uniforms year round, unless they had a need to go outside during the winter season. The coverings of the station's three radar towers were heated from within to keep the covering from becoming brittle from extreme cold, and thus subject to being damaged or destroyed by high winds. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. The 718th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, activated in April 1958 and operated AN/FPS-8; AN/TPS-10D, AN/FPS-4; AN/FPS-20A, and AN/FPS-6 radars. As a surveillance station, its mission was to monitor the airspace for aircraft activity and provide information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at Murphy Dome AFS near Fairbanks, where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Communications were initially provided by a high frequency radio system which proved unreliable because of atmospheric disturbances. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, decided to build the White Alice Communications System, a system of Air Force-owned tropospheric scatter and microwave radio relay sites operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Unalakleet site was activated in 1957. Unalakleet Air Force Station was very expensive to maintain, and was inactivated due to budget reductions on 30 September 1969, its mission being taken over by other AAC surveillance radar sites with upgraded and more capable equipment. After the station's closure, the buildings, radars and communications antennas sat derelict and abandoned for decades. In 1998 Pacific Air Forces initiated \\"Operation Clean Sweep\\", in which abandoned Cold War stations in Alaska were remediated and the land restored to its previous state. After years of neglect the facilities at the station had lost any value they had when the site was closed. The site remediation of the radar, support and White Alice communication station was carried out by the 611th Civil Engineering Squadron at Elmendorf AFB, and remediation work was completed by 2005.

It is located at 9 Union Street, at the edge of the city's business district, in an architecturally distinguished Richardsonian Romanesque building designed by Arthur H. Vinal and completed in 1893, with a major addition in 1984-85. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also home to an art gallery. Architecture and history The Calais Free Library is located at the eastern end of Union Street in downtown Calais, and is set between the street and the St. Croix River. It is a single-story brick building with brownstone trim, topped by a hip roof. The right side of its front (southwest- facing) facade has a tall gable section with a projecting rounded bay on its left and the main entrance recessed under a large round arch. The left side of the main facade consists of a bank of round-arch windows. At the center of the roof an octagonal cupola with louvered sides rises to a bellcast pyramidal roof and finial. Set behind this original building, at a lower elevation due to the sloping lot, is a modern addition, joined to this building's basement by a narrow hyphen. The basic form of the original building is echoed in the addition. Library services in Calais began with a private subscription service in the 1830s, whose collection was significantly damaged by a fire in 1870. The impetus for the Calais Free Library came from James Shepherd Pike, one of the city's leading citizens, who died in the early 1880s, bequeathing his house to the city for use as a library. Due to the fire in the previous library, the new library's trustees opted to build a new stone building, selling Pike's house and having it moved off the lot. Boston architect Arthur H. Vinal was awarded the contract in 1892, and the new building opened its doors in 1893; it is one of only three of Vinal's commissions in Maine to survive. The 1984-85 addition was designed by WBRC Architects/Engineers of Bangor.

He was the patriarch of one of the prominent founding families of early Texas. De Le√≥n and his wife Patricia de la Garza established De Le√≥n's Colony, the only predominantly Mexican colony in Texas. They founded the town of Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe Victoria Nombre de Jes√∫s (now known as Victoria) on the Guadalupe River. The name referred both to the river and to Mexico's president Guadalupe Victoria. De Le√≥n was a merchant who originally supplied basic necessities to mine workers at Real de San Nicol√°s. In 1790 he joined the Fieles de Burgos regiment, where he was promoted to Captain. The De Le√≥n E‚ÄìJ (Esp√≠ritu de Jes√∫s) cattle brand became the first registered brand in what was to become Texas. The extended De Le√≥n family included politicians and freedom fighters who helped alter the course of history both in Texas and in Mexico. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6542, placed at Evergreen Cemetery in 1936, acknowledges Don Martin de Le√≥n's contribution to Texas. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6543, placed at Church and Bridge Streets in 1936, denotes Don Martin de Le√≥n's home in Victoria.  Early life  Mart√≠n De Le√≥n was born in 1765 in Burgos, Tamaulipas, Mexico to Jos√© Bernardo de Le√≥n y Garc√≠a and Mar√≠a Antonia Galv√°n y de las Rivas from Burgos, Spain who were wealthy and well-connected aristocratic immigrants. He first worked as a supplier of basic necessities to Real de San Nicol√°s mine workers. He joined the Fieles de Burgos regiment in 1790, being promoted to Captain.  De Leon's colony  De Le√≥n and his wife Patricia de la Garza began ranching in Cruillas following their marriage. In 1799, De Le√≥n moved northward and established Rancho Chiltipiquin, a cattle ranch in the vicinity of San Patricio County, Texas. Their cattle brand, with a connected E and J (standing for Esp√≠ritu de Jes√∫s), became the first registered cattle brand in what was to become Texas. The brand had been modeled after one used by the Jesuits, and brought from Spain when the De Le√≥n family emigrated. Mart√≠n officially registered it in Texas under the family name in 1807. De Le√≥n's 1807 and 1809 petitions to act as an empresario for colonization in Texas were denied by the Spanish government. After Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, colonization possibilities looked more favorable. The provisional Mexican government approved a contract on April 13, 1824 for De Le√≥n to settle forty- one Mexican families on the lower Guadalupe and Lavaca rivers, in the vicinity of Coleto, Garcitas, Arenosa, and Zorillo (Placido) creeks. The settlement's original name was Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe Victoria Nombre de Jes√∫s, for both the river and Mexico's president Guadalupe Victoria. It is now known as Victoria. This was the only predominantly Mexican colony in Texas, where the eastern areas were settled primarily by immigrants from the United States. The Mexico legislature passed the General Colonization Law on August 18, and enacted on March 25, 1825, allowing foreigners to gain title to land that was not within 20 leagues of the border of another country or within 10 leagues of the coast.  Family  In 1795, Mart√≠n De Le√≥n married Patricia de la Garza. Her financial inheritance contributed to the foundation of De Le√≥n's Colony. Upon her husband's death, de la Garza assumed the role of head of the De Le√≥n family. She kept the family together during exile in Louisiana. After their return to Victoria, she became a leading figure who helped shape and nurture the community. Their extended family colonized Texas, and included politicians whose deeds affected the course of history both in Texas and in Mexico. The couple had four sons: Fernando, Silvestre, F√©lix and Agapito. Fernando helped trade livestock for munitions to help Stephen F. Austin, and later became aide-de-camp to provisional Texas governor James W. Robinson. Silvestre fought beside his brother-in-law Pl√°cido at the 1835 Siege of B√©xar to drive Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos out of Texas. The couple also had six daughters, who were overshadowed by the men they married. Candelaria married Jos√© Miguel Aldrete, who was 1835 state land commissioner of Coahuila y Tejas. Aldrete joined several Texas insurgent groups to resist President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. Guadalupe married Desiderio Garc√≠a, of whom nothing is known. Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s (Mar√≠a) married politician Rafael Manchola, who was elected to the state legislature in 1830. Mar√≠a del Refugio (Refugio) married Mexican freedom fighter Jos√© Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Carbajal, who waged guerrilla warfare in Mexico against L√≥pez de Santa Anna's political machine. Agustina married Pl√°cido Benavides, who opposed Santa Anna's dictatorship, but believed that Texas should remain part of Mexico. Benavides led a unit of Tejano fighters at the Battle of Goliad. He was recruited by Stephen F. Austin for the Battle of Bexar. Benavides became known as the \\"Texas Paul Revere\\" for his 1836 journey from San Patricio to Goliad to Victoria, warning residents of the approaching Mexican army. Francisca married Vicente Dosal, of whom nothing is known.  Death and legacy Mart√≠n De Le√≥n died of cholera in 1833, a year of epidemics that swept North America along its waterways. His estate was worth $500,000. De Le√≥n is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Victoria, Texas.

The city, whose garrison was absent at the time, was sacked and plundered, yielding not only many captives but also large quantities of weapons and supplies intended for the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantine attack, which was repeated in the subsequent years, shocked the Abbasid authorities, and urgent measures were taken to refortify the coasts and strengthen the local fleet, beginning a revival of the Egyptian navy that culminated in the Tulunid and Fatimid periods. Background During the 820s, the Byzantine Empire suffered two great losses that destroyed their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean: the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Sicily and the fall of Crete to Andalusian exiles. These losses ushered in an era where Saracen pirates raided the Christian northern shores of the Mediterranean almost at will. The establishment of the Emirate of Crete, which became a haven for Muslim ships, opened the Aegean Sea up for raids, while their‚Äîalbeit partial‚Äîcontrol of Sicily allowed the Arabs to raid and even settle in Italy and the Adriatic shores. Several Byzantine attempts to retake Crete in the immediate aftermath of the Andalusian conquest, as well as a large-scale invasion in 842/43, failed with heavy losses. Byzantine expedition against Damietta In 853 the Byzantine government tried a new approach: instead of attacking Crete directly, they tried to sever the island's lines of supply, principally from Egypt, which was, in the words of Alexander Vasiliev, \\"the arsenal of the Cretan pirates\\". The Arab historian al-Tabari reports that three fleets, totalling almost 300 ships, were prepared and sent on simultaneous raids of Muslim naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean. The precise targets of the first two fleets are unknown, but the third, comprising 85 ships and 5,000 men under a commander known from Arab sources only as \\"Ibn Qa·π≠≈´nƒÅ\\", headed for the Egyptian coast. Various identifications have been proposed by modern scholars for \\"Ibn Qa·π≠≈´nƒÅ\\", but without any firm evidence. Based on the similarity of consonants in their names, Henri Gr√©goire variously suggested an identification with Sergios Niketiates, who however probably died in 843, and with Constantine Kontomytes. In a later work in 1952 he suggested that he might be identified with the parakoimomenos Damian, considering the Arabic name a rendering of the Byzantine title epi tou koitonos (\\"in charge of the imperial bedchamber\\"). Previously, in 1913, the Syriac scholar E. W. Brooks had suggested an identification with the strategos Photeinos. Egyptian naval defences were weak. The Egyptian fleet had declined from its Umayyad-era peak and was mostly employed in the Nile rather than in the Mediterranean. Fortifications along the coastal marshes, which had been manned by volunteer garrisons, had been abandoned in the later 8th century. The Byzantines had exploited this in 811/12 and again in , launching raids against the coasts of Egypt. The Byzantine fleet arrived at Damietta on 22 May 853. The city garrison were absent at a feast for the Day of Arafah, organized by the governor Anbasah ibn Ishaq al-Dabbi in Fustat. Damietta's inhabitants fled the undefended city, which was plundered for two days and then torched by the Byzantine troops. The Byzantines carried off some six hundred Arab and Coptic women, as well as large quantities of arms and other supplies intended for Crete. The fleet then sailed east and attacked the strong fortress of Ushtun. Upon taking it, they burned the many artillery and siege engines found there before returning home. Aftermath and impact Although the raid at Damietta was, according to historian Vassilios Christides, \\"one of the brightest military operations\\" undertaken by the Byzantine military, it is completely ignored in Byzantine sources, probably because most accounts are warped by their hostile attitude to Michael III () and his reign. As a result, the raid is known only through two Arab accounts, by al-Tabari and Ya'qubi. The Byzantines returned and raided Damietta again in 854. Another raid possibly took place in 855, as the Arabic sources indicate that the arrival of a Byzantine fleet in Egypt was anticipated by the Abbasid authorities. In 859, the Byzantine fleet attacked Farama. Despite these successes, Saracen piracy in the Aegean continued unabated, and reached its height in the early 900s, with the sack of Thessalonica, the Byzantine Empire's second city, in 904, and the activities of the renegades Leo of Tripoli and Damian of Tarsus. It would not be until 961 that the Byzantines reconquered Crete, and secured control of the Aegean. In the more immediate aftermath, according to the Arab chroniclers, the raid led to the realization of Egypt's vulnerability from the sea. After a long period of neglect, Egypt's maritime defences were urgently strengthened by Governor Anbasah. Within nine months of the raid, Damietta was refortified, along with Tinnis and Alexandria. Various works were undertaken at Rosetta, Borollos, Ashmun, at-Tina, and Nastarawwa, while ships were constructed and new crews raised. Most seamen were forcibly conscripted from among the Copts and the Arabs of the interior, which earned Anbasah a bad reputation in contemporary sources, and complaints against him were directed to Caliph al- Mutawakkil. Later Arabic sources like al-Maqrizi and Coptic sources confirm that the new fleet was used in raids against the Byzantines in subsequent years, although no details are recorded. This activity is generally held to have marked the rebirth of the Egyptian navy, which came to number 100 ships under the Tulunid dynasty (868‚Äì905) and reached its peak later under the Fatimids (969‚Äì1171).For the activities of the Egyptian fleets in the later 9th century, cf. .

Its aim is to provide women in poor rural villages with the opportunity to start, grow and maintain sustainable income-generating micro-enterprises, build assets through saving as well as finance home improvements and childhood education. SPBD also provides its clients with a range of training, financial services and ongoing motivation so that they can climb permanently out of poverty. History South Pacific Business Development began in the small, rural island of Samoa in 2000. This microfinance organization was created by Gregory F. Casagrande to provide economic opportunities to women in poor communities in Samoa in order to improve their lifestyle as well as their families. Several years later, in July 2009 SPBD established a replication of SPBD (Samoa) in the Kingdom of Tonga named SPBD Microfinance (Tonga) Ltd. At the end of 2010, another replication was launched in Fiji, SPBD Microfinance (Fiji) Ltd, meeting the same success as SPBD (Samoa) and SPBD (Tonga). A third replication is in the works and is planning on being launched towards the end of 2012 in the Solomon Islands. Network At the end of 2010, South Pacific Business Development created a holding company called South Pacific Business Development Microfinance Holdings limited liability company (Delaware) in United States of America and placed underneath it another holding company named South Pacific Business Development Microfinance Holdings Pte. Limited in Singapore. The Delaware-based entity serves as the gateway for United States investors to put their money into the SPBD Network, while the Singapore-based company plans to operate as a regional microfinance platform in the Pacific. The South Pacific Business Development Microfinance Holdings Pte. Limited in Singapore owns SPBD Samoa, SPBD Tonga, and SPBD Fiji and is responsible for launching other greenfield microfinance operations in other Pacific Island countries such as in the Solomon Islands at the end of 2012. All of SPBD's microfinance institutions are registered as non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), with SPBD Samoa recently having made the transformation from a non- governmental organization (NGO) status. Statistics Since distributing its first micro-enterprise loan in January 2000, SPBD has provided over 31,000 loans (approx.

It was installed in 1874, but relocated several times between 1880 and 1931. The statue was sculpted by French-American artist Joseph A. Bailly, whose best known work is the statue of George Washington in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The bronze sculpture, which rests on a granite base, is one of the city's eighteen Civil War monuments that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The monument and park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department. The statue is considered by historians to be one of the better portrait statues in Washington, D.C. History =Background= John Aaron Rawlins (1831‚Äì1869) was a lawyer and native of Illinois who organized the 45th Illinois Infantry for the Union Army during the Civil War. He served as a confidant and the closest advisor to General Ulysses S. Grant during the war and served as Grant's Secretary of War after Grant was elected president of the United States. Rawlins died of tuberculosis five months into his term as secretary. During his short term in office, Rawlins spoke passionately about the plight of recently freed slaves and tried to protect Native Americans from military officers who were cruel to them. He also tried to protect Grant from men who would \\"lead him away from the straight and true.\\" One of Rawlins' colleagues said \\"he had blunt, wrathful words of objurgation for those who put in Grant's way temptations that he knew to be dangerous.\\" John Aaron Rawlins Soon after Rawlins' death in 1869, efforts were under way to erect a statue honoring him. Interest in the project waned until 1872 when Grant wrote a letter to Congress to address the delay. On June 10, 1872, a congressional bill sponsored by Illinois Senator John A. Logan, who had served under Grant and admired Rawlins, was approved with $10,000 appropriated for the erection of the statue. The legislation included instructions for a committee to be created that would solicit models and select an artist. The committee consisted of General Orville E. Babcock, Architect of the Capitol Edward Clark, and Librarian of Congress Ainsworth Rand Spofford. Sculptors that submitted designs included Theophilus Fisk Mills, son of Clark Mills, and Lot Flannery, sculptor of the 1868 Abraham Lincoln statue. The artist chosen was Joseph A. Bailly (1825‚Äì1883), a French- born American sculptor whose best known work is the 1869 statue of George Washington in Philadelphia. Bailly's other works in Washington, D.C. include sculptures of Benjamin Hallowell and Alexander \\"Boss\\" Shepherd. The statue was founded by Robert Wood & Company. The bronze used for the statue was cast from Confederate cannons captured during the Civil War. The total cost of the statue and its installation was $13,000. The original planned site for the statue was Franklin Square, though the site where it was installed was Rawlins Park, a small park in what was then an unkept and remote area. There was no formal dedication ceremony when it was installed in November 1874. The following year, the statue was placed atop a granite base constructed by the Westham Granite Company of Richmond, Virginia. =Later history= The sculpture in 2013 In 1880, members of the Grand Army of the Republic visited the statue and were dismayed by the park and its surroundings. They petitioned to have the statue moved to a more prominent location, 10th and D Streets NW, where it stood until a newspaper plant was built on that site. It was then moved to the north side of Pennsylvania Avenue between 7th Street and 9th Street NW, but a public restroom was built on the site in 1886 and the statue was moved across the street. In 1931, construction began on the National Archives Building and the statue was moved for the last time to its original location, Rawlins Park. Rawlins Park was greatly improved with the addition of walkways and a reflecting pool in 1938. In 1963, Wyoming Representative William H. Harrison unsuccessfully attempted to have the statue moved to Rawlins, a town named after the general. The statue is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington, D.C. that were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 20, 1978, and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3, 1979. It is one of the few Civil War monuments that is a not an equestrian sculpture. The others are the Dupont Circle Fountain, Stephenson Grand Army of the Republic Memorial, Nuns of the Battlefield, the Peace Monument, and statues of Admiral David G. Farragut and Brigadier General Albert Pike. The statue and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department. Historian James M. Goode, author of Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C., considers it one of the better portrait statues in Washington, D.C., and thinks the statue has a \\"certain elegance and spirit.\\" Design and location The statue in Rawlins Park, 2008 The statue is sited on the eastern end of Rawlins Park, a small public park located between 18th Street, 19th Street, E Street and New York Avenue NW in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The Main Interior Building lies to the south of the park, General Services Administration Building is on the north side of the park, and The Octagon House is on the northeast corner of the park. The bronze statue measures tall and the light gray, pedestal-style granite base measures high and wide. The statue depicts Rawlins standing while wearing his Civil War military uniform: a hat, long belted jacket, tall boots, and gloves. His left leg is slightly forward and his right hand is holding a pair of field glasses by his side. He left hand is holding the sword handle which rests at his side. Rawlins is depicted with a beard and moustache. The inscription \\"RAWLINS\\" is on the front of the base. The inscriptions \\"R. WOOD & CO / BRONZE FOUNDERS / PHILA\\" and \\"A. BAILLY, sculpt / 1873\\" are on the sculpture. See also * List of public art in Washington, D.C., Ward 2 * Outdoor sculpture in Washington, D.C.

By design, the Yellowstone was the first powered boat to reach above Council Bluffs, Iowa, on the Missouri River achieving, on her maiden voyage, Fort Tecumseh, South Dakota, on June 19, 1831. The Yellowstone also played an important role in the Texas Revolution of 1836, crossing the Texas Army under Sam Houston over the swollen Brazos River ahead of Santa Anna's pursuing Mexican Army. Early career on the Missouri River The Yellowstone was built between 1830 and 1831 in Louisville, Kentucky, for the American Fur Company to service the fur trade between Saint Louis, Missouri, and the trading camps along the Missouri River up to the mouth of the Yellowstone River in western North Dakota in support of their Montana fur trade. Prior to the Yellowstone, fur traders beyond Council Bluff relied on un-powered keelboats which had to be dragged up-river for supply and then floated downstream with their furs. Beginning in St. Louis, The Yellowstone made her maiden voyage on April 16, 1831 and reached Pierre, South Dakota, on June 19, 1831, six hundred miles farther than any other steamboat,Jackson, Donald, Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1985. p. 24. dramatically opening the way for regular travel and trade along the upper stretches of the Missouri River. She returned, fully loaded, to Saint Louis on July 15, 1831.Jackson, Donald, Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1985. p. 24. The following year, 1832, the Yellowstone reached the mouth of the river for which she was named. That voyage was chronicled by George Catlin. In 1833, German naturalist Prince Alexander Philipp Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied, together with Swiss artist Karl Bodmer traveled the Missouri River on board the Yellowstone. That journey was also chronicled in Maximilian's Reise in das Innere Nord-Amerikas. Karl Bodmer's depiction of the Yellowstone struggling over a sand bar may be the most accurate depiction of the steamboat in existence. In July 1833, the crew and passengers of the Yellowstone was overcome by cholera. Many of the crew and passengers, including the firemen and assistant Indian Agent Robinson Pemberton Beauchamp, died, and the boat was under threat of being burned by locals in both Iowa and Nebraska who were afraid of contagion. Leaving famed steamboat captain, then a clerk and pilot, Joseph LaBarge, to hold and protect the boat and its ailing crew, the Yellowstone's captain, Anson G. Bennett, ventured downstream to St. Louis, and soon returned with a new crew.Chittenden, H. M. History of Early Steamboat Navigation on the Missouri River. New York: Harper., 1903. p. 32. From 1831 through 1833, regular runs of the steamboat took advantage of the higher river due to April snow melts and again in June and July by favor of snow melt from the Rocky Mountains. During the winters when ice prevented such travel and late summer when water levels were insufficient for the six foot draft of the vessel, the Yellowstone served the cotton and sugar cane markets along the lower Mississippi River.Jackson, Donald, Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1985. p. 27. After the final July 1833 run up the Missouri River, the steamboat continued the work along the Mississippi River with Captain John P. Phillips, under new ownership.Jackson, Donald, Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1985. p. 112. In November 1835, the Yellowstone steamed to New Orleans for a significant refit,Jackson, Donald, Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1985, p. 115. a second boiler was added and much of the wooden components replaced with newer wood. Meanwhile, she was sold yet again and registered by the new owners for trade runs in foreign (specifically, the then Mexican Texas) waters. Career in Texas Revolution A December 1836 advertisement for packet service on the Brazos River, Republic of Texas, between Quintana and Washington. The steamboat was purchased by Thomas Toby & Brother to focus upon the cotton trade along the Brazos River in Texas, carrying bales from the growers down to Quintana on the Gulf Coast. Departing New Orleans on New Year's Eve, 1835, she was loaded with arms, ammunition and forty-seven volunteers of the Mobile GreysPuryear, Pamela Ashworth and Nath Winfield Jr., Sandbars and Sternwheelers, Steam Navigation on the Brazos; Texas A&M; University Press, College Station, 1976.p. 46. destined to support the Texans in their fight for Independence against Santa Anna. In late March and early April 1836, despite three Mexican forces under Generals Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, Antonio Gaona and Jose Urrea all searching for the Texas army along the right bank of the Brazos River, the Yellowstone steamed upstream to continue collecting cotton from the growers. In early April, Santa Anna was camped at San Felipe de Austin, fifteen miles below the yet undiscovered Texas camp near Groce's Landing, while General Gaona was marching southward down the Brazos from the San Antonio Road, leaving the Texans caught between. On April 2, Sam Houston sent word to the Yellowstone to remain at Groce's Landing, and prepare to assist in crossing the Texas Army. The captain and crew complied. On April 12, the Yellowstone began crossing the entire Texas Army, completing the crossing with multiple trips by mid-afternoon the following day. On April 14, as the Texans marched toward San Jacinto, the Yellowstone, still armored in cotton bales, began her sprint downstream to pass the Mexican camps on her way to the Gulf.Jackson, Donald, Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1985. p. 131. With her bell clanging and smoke billowing, the Yellowstone sent many of the Mexican soldiers running in fear, having never known the existence of such a craft as a steamboat.Pena, Jose Enrique de la, With Santa Anna in Texas, Texas A&M; University Press, College Station, 1975, p. 105. One Mexican soldier is reported to have attempted to lasso her by her smoke stack as others fired on the craft heeding Santa Anna's order to capture the boat for his own crossing.Santa Anna had already crossed to the left bank, moving toward Harrisburg and had left General Ram√≠rez y Sesma on the right bank to attempt capture of the boat. The bullet-ridden stacks represented the only damage the steamboat incurred as she quickly outran her pursuers.Sowell, Andrew J. History of Fort Bend County. W. H. Coyle &, 1964. p. 110. Soon after the Texans' victory at San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, the Yellowstone was waiting nearby and received the wounded Commander in Chief, Sam Houston, the new republic's interim president David G. Burnet, the captured Santa Anna and forty-seven Mexican prisoners. She was held for a time for the purpose of returning the captive Santa Anna to Mexico, but Santa Anna's return would be delayed many months.Jackson, Donald, Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1985. p. 135. Later that year and still in service (then as a packet boat along Buffalo Bayou), the Yellowstone was called upon to take the body of Texas hero Stephen F. Austin to burial, and then return mourners along the Brazos River afterward.Puryear, Pamela Ashworth and Nath Winfield Jr., Sandbars and Sternwheelers, Steam Navigation on the Brazos; Texas A&M; University Press, College Station, 1976. p. 48. Final disposition The ultimate fate of the Yellowstone is not recorded. Texas legend is that she sank in Buffalo Bayou in 1837; however, no record of such an end exists. A record does exist stating that a steamboat by that name passed through the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Ohio River, in the summer of 1837.Jackson, Donald, Voyages of the Steamboat Yellow Stone, New York: Ticknor & Fields, 1985. p. 147.

Characteristics Generally, humans have the ability to hear musical beat and rhythm beginning in infancy. Some people, however, are unable to identify beat and rhythm of music, suffering from what is known as beat deafness. Beat deafness is a newly discovered form of congenital amusia, in which people lack the ability to identify or ‚Äúhear‚Äù the beat in a piece of music. Unlike most hearing impairments in which an individual is unable to hear any sort of sound stimuli, those with beat deafness are generally able to hear normally, but unable to identify beat and rhythm in music. Those with beat deafness are also unable to dance in step to any type of music. Even people who do not dance well can at least coordinate their movements to the song they are listening to, because they can easily keep time to the beat. Rarity The first reported case of beat deafness was of a Canadian graduate student, whom researchers have identified as ‚ÄúMathieu‚Äù. Phillips-Silver et al. (2011) examined the human ability to recognize musical beat in a sample of individuals who had had no previous musical training in their lives. The researchers presented a series of songs from different genres and the participants were instructed to simply bounce up and down to the beat of the music. Results indicated that all participants except for Mathieu were able to move in sync with the beat of the music. The researchers also presented video clips which showed a person dancing to music. Mathieu could not identify when the person was or was not dancing in time to the music. Other participants demonstrated no problem with this task. Neural basis When sound waves reach the ears, the energy they contain is converted into electrical signals, which are sent via the auditory nerves to the brain. Sound processing begins when these electrical signals reach the primary auditory receiving area in the core part of the temporal lobe.Goldstein, E. B. (2010). Sensation and perception. California: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning Signals then travel to the area surrounding the core, known as the belt area, and are then transmitted to the parabelt area, which is located next to the belt. Simple sounds such as pure tones are able to activate the core area of the brain, but both the belt and parabelt areas are activated by only complex sounds, such as those found in speech and music. The auditory cortex in the left hemisphere of the brain is responsible for processing beat and rhythm in music. The right auditory cortex is primarily used in distinguishing between different harmonics, which are simple pure tones that combine to create complex tones.Jourdain, R. (1997). Music, the brain, and ecstasy: How music captures our imagination. New York: William Morrow and Company Phillips-Silver et al. (2011) propose that beat deafness is the result of neurological problems in the areas of the brain that are used for recognizing musical beat, rhythm, and time. The main area responsible for processing musical rhythm is the left auditory cortex, however other areas are most likely involved as well. According to the hypothesis of Phillips-Silver and coworkers, it should therefore be functional abnormalities in the left auditory cortex that cause beat deafness.Honing, H. (2011). A case of congenital beat deafness? Amsterdam: Music Matters  A blog on music cognition. Other areas of Mathieu's brain appeared to be functioning normally, including the areas responsible for hearing in general and for motor control, which is used in performing the moves in dancing. Mathieu's deficiencies are therefore not caused by the inability to hear efficiently or control the movement of his body while dancing. Beat deafness has also not been shown to affect other areas of cognitive function such as language, which does not involve any sort of underlying beat or sporadic rhythm changes that are associated with music. Given the normal functioning of Mathieu's brain, the hypothesis about the beat perception deficit occurring in the brain area for rhythm processing in particular is most likely correct. Beat deafness is however, a very recent discovery and further research is necessary in gaining complete understanding of the phenomenon and its underlying brain processes. In 2016 a study was published that examined the neural correlates of beat perception in two beat-deaf individuals, Mathieu and Marjorie, and a group of control participants. It provided partial support for abnormalities in later cognitive stages of beat processing, reflected in an unreliable P3b component exhibited by Mathieu‚Äîbut not Marjorie‚Äîcompared to control participants. Comparison to tone deafness Tone deafness is characterized by the inability to discriminate between different pitches, which are directly related to the frequencies of sound waves. Tone deafness is a related, but distinct disorder from beat deafness. People with tone deafness can recognize beat and can move in time to music, but they cannot perceive pitch. People with beat deafness on the other hand, can recognize and distinguish between different tones as well as the average person and can usually sing in tune, so musical pitch is not the issue. Different areas of the brain in the auditory cortex are involved in the perception of musical pitch and melody, and researchers theorize that tone deafness can potentially be from any of these sections. Both beat deafness and tone deafness are derived from these same areas within the brain. Beat perception in animals Sulphur-crested cockatoos can detect the beat in music. A research team led by Aniruddh D. Patel of The Neurosciences Institute concluded that sulphur-crested cockatoos have the ability to perceive the beat in music and are able to rhythmically move to the tempo of the music as it changes. Only vocal learning species such as dolphins and parrots are hypothesized to have the ability to perceive beat. This is because beat perception and movement rely on complex vocal learning which require motor and auditory circuits in the brain. Vocal learning and beat perception do some overlapping in the parts of the brain that account auditory and motor areas. There is no significant evidence for beat perception in nonvocal learning species such as dogs and cats. However, California sea lions, a nonvocal learning animal, have demonstrated the ability to perceive beats in music.

Existence Amorphous sets cannot exist if the axiom of choice is assumed. Fraenkel constructed a permutation model of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel with Atoms in which the set of atoms is an amorphous set. After Cohen's initial work on forcing in 1963, proofs of the consistency of amorphous sets with Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel were obtained. Additional properties Every amorphous set is Dedekind-finite, meaning that it has no bijection to a proper subset of itself. To see this, suppose that S is a set that does have a bijection f to a proper subset. For each i ‚â• 0 define Si to be the set of elements that belong to the image of the i-fold composition of f with itself but not to the image of the (i + 1)-fold composition. Then each Si is non- empty, so the union of the sets Si with even indices would be an infinite set whose complement is also infinite, showing that S cannot be amorphous. However, the converse is not necessarily true: it is consistent for there to exist infinite Dedekind-finite sets that are not amorphous.. No amorphous set can be linearly ordered... In particular this is the combination of the implications Ia ‚Üí II ‚Üí Œî3 which de la Cruz et al. credit respectively to and . Because the image of an amorphous set is itself either amorphous or finite, it follows that every function from an amorphous set to a linearly ordered set has only a finite image. The cofinite filter on an amorphous set is an ultrafilter. This is because the complement of each infinite subset must not be infinite, so every subset is either finite or cofinite. Variations If œÄ is a partition of an amorphous set into finite subsets, then there must be exactly one integer n(œÄ) such that œÄ has infinitely many subsets of size n; for, if every size was used finitely many times, or if more than one size was used infinitely many times, this information could be used to coarsen the partition and split œÄ into two infinite subsets. If an amorphous set has the additional property that, for every partition œÄ, n(œÄ) = 1, then it is called strictly amorphous or strongly amorphous, and if there is a finite upper bound on n(œÄ) then the set is called bounded amorphous. It is consistent with ZF that amorphous sets exist and are all bounded, or that they exist and are all unbounded.

Television =X-Men= X-Men animated series Rogue appeared in the X-Men television series, where she was one of the main characters. Rogue was voiced by Lenore Zann. In this series, she had her absorption powers, Ms. Marvel powers, and a copy of Ms. Marvel's psyche trapped inside her own. She is somewhat liberal in her use of her powers, but it is sometimes shown how the psyches affect her mind, such as when she absorbed the powers/minds of particularly dark or evil characters, like Archangel while he was a Horseman or the Juggernaut. Rogue shares a close friendship with Storm and has a relationship with Gambit throughout most of the series, similar to the comics, even referring to herself as Mrs. LeBeau in \\"Hidden Agenda\\". However, Rogue also displays a more flirtatious attitude towards numerous other characters, such as Cyclops, Archangel, Colossus, and during the X-Men's appearance on Spider-Man: The Animated Series, she flirted with Spider-Man. During the series, Rogue is one of the characters affected by the news of the \\"cure\\", which Apocalypse and Mystique used to make mutants into slaves. She is also revisited by Cody, her first boyfriend, and almost runs away with him. However, Rogue discovers that he was part of a plot for her to become the new ruler of the Brood, or \\"the Colony\\". This particular version of Rogue also appeared in the Animated Series' two tie in comics: X-Men Adventures and The Adventures of the X-Men, with the former being based on the animated series and the latter including the same characters but with original storylines. Rogue appeared to be a regular in the first three volumes of this series, but appeared only in the final issue of The Adventures of the X-Men. =X-Men: Evolution= Rogue in X-Men: Evolution, while under Mesmero's Mind Control. In this series, X-Men: Evolution, Rogue is re-imagined as a rebellious, yet deeply insecure, teenager with a goth/punk appearance. Her powers make her cynical and reclusive, but truthfully, she is consumed by the need for closeness and intimacy with others. She was voiced by Meghan Black, using a heavy Dixie accent. Rogue was adopted by Mystique and raised by Destiny (Irene Adler). She initially joined the Brotherhood of Mutants, but left after finding out that they recruited her to be a potential weapon. Rogue develops a romantic interest in Cyclops for most of the series, though her feelings for him fade soon after he and Jean start dating. She is later seen having an interest in Gambit when they first meet in \\"Day of Reckoning\\", in \\"Dark Horizon: Pt- 1\\" when she kissed him to absorb his powers when she was under Mesmero's hypnosis (albeit subconsciously aware of the kiss via a sly smile) and again when he kidnapped her in the \\"Cajun Spice\\" episode. Rogue quietly disliked Jean, despite Jean's efforts to show her kindness and friendship, partly due to jealousy over Jean having Cyclops as her boyfriend, and also because Jean represented everything Rogue was not - Jean was friendly, popular, and had a power that did not keep her from having physical contact with others. Though after helping Jean with her power problems in \\"Power Surge\\" she admits to Cyclops when asked about her good deed towards her romantic rival that despite their differences, she knows Jean does care about her and that Jean would have done the same for her if she was in trouble. As she watches Jean get close to Scott, she knows she may never be able to get close to him, which exacerbates her feelings on her inability to develop a close relationship with anyone. After learning the truth about her relationship with Mystique, she shares a bond with her \\"little brother\\" Nightcrawler, but still lacks the intimate relationship she wants. Rogue's absorption abilities are very strong in this series, which nearly drive her insane, but prove vital in the final attack against Apocalypse. Unlike in other versions of Rogue in X-Men media, the powers she absorbs never totally fade, and at times, she can still use a mutant's power long after she has first absorbed them. Although Rogue did not have super strength or flight abilities as in the comics, she displays skill in hand-to-hand combat. Though she is never shown gaining Ms. Marvel's abilities, in Xavier's vision of the future, Rogue is seen flying and not wearing gloves, the latter indicating that she does eventually gain the ability to activate her power at will. =Wolverine and the X-Men= Wolverine and the X-Men Rogue appears in Wolverine and the X-Men voiced by Kieren van den Blink. In this version, she appears as both a member of the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants as a double agent. In the early episodes, her personality is similar to that of the X-Men: Evolution version of the character. She has a strong bond with Logan, shown as he was leaving on the day of the explosion in \\"Hindsight (Part 1)\\". However, the two reconcile their grudges by the end of the season.For the first part of the season, Rogue is portrayed as a double-crosser, setting up the X-Men to look like they were attacking Senator Kelly. However, it is discovered that Rogue joined the Brotherhood to find out more information about Magneto as a spy. She rejoins the X-Men soon after discovering Magneto's plans to attack the MRD. Unlike her other animated adaptations, this Rogue does not have any romantic interest in Gambit. In fact the two, in this series, did not even meet. Rogue displays a fairly liberal use of her abilities and is shown absorbing numerous mutants for a variety of reasons; for example, she absorbs Quicksilver, Domino, Blob, Juggernaut, and Shadowcat all in one episode either to use their abilities, extract information, or to knock them out. There were no seeming ramifications from her absorptions. Her X-Men uniform is similar to her 1990s era comics uniform and the outfit she wore in X-Men: The Animated Series. Her casual clothing is reminiscent of one of her 1980s uniforms, which consisted of a green shirt and gloves over an all black outfit. She is also seen wearing a brown cloak with the hood up, similar to the one worn by Anna Paquin in the X-Men films. =Marvel Anime: X-Men= During the final episode of Marvel Anime: X-Men, Rogue can be briefly seen next to Colossus before leaping into action. She is shown flying, and presumably possesses her original mutant powers in addition to her Ms. Marvel powers. =Ultimate Spider-Man= In the Ultimate Spider-Man episode \\"I Am Spider-Man\\", a Daily Bugle news crawl mentions Rogue shaking hands with the Mayor for funding a new Library, the Mayor suffers the effects of her abilities and but is expected to fully recover. =Wolverine versus Sabretooth= Rogue appears in the Wolverine versus Sabretooth motion comic, voiced by Kazumi Evans. Films Rogue was portrayed by Anna Paquin in the X-Men film series. In the films, her relationship with Wolverine echoes his relationships with both Shadowcat and Jubilee in the comics; that of a protective surrogate father. Like her Ultimate Marvel counterpart, her love interest is Iceman. =X-Men= Marie D'Ancanto runs away from home after her power manifests itself by accidentally draining the life from her boyfriend while she is kissing him. She adopts the alias \\"Rogue\\" and wanders into a bar in Canada, where she meets Wolverine/Logan. On the road, they are attacked by Sabretooth, Magneto's henchman, but are rescued by Storm and Cyclops. Then, Rogue becomes a student of Charles Xavier in his school of mutant children, and friends with Bobby Drake/Iceman and John Allerdyce/Pyro. One night, when Logan accidentally stabs Rogue, she uses her powers to steal his healing ability in front of many other students. Mystique, disguised as Bobby, tells Rogue that Xavier is angry with her, so she flees. Magneto kidnaps Rogue, locks her in a machine that can turn humans into mutants, and transfers his powers to her. The X-Men destroy the machine before it activates, yet the experience leaves Rogue with a permanent white streak through her hair, and Logan intentionally transfers his healing powers to her. He later gives her his dog tags before leaving. =X2= In X2, Rogue begins dating Iceman, despite her continued difficulties making direct physical contact. Rogue, Iceman, Pyro, and Wolverine escape William Stryker who sends agents into the X-Mansion to kidnap the mutants and hide in Iceman's family home in Boston. However, Iceman's younger brother, angered by the \\"gifts\\" of his older brother, calls the police on them. When they arrive, Wolverine is shot in the head by a policeman, and an enraged Pyro burns many of the cops and their vehicles. Rogue touches Pyro's skin and absorbs his powers, enabling her to calm the flames, then the X-Men teams up with their former enemy Magneto to save Xavier from Stryker. Both Rogue and Iceman are promoted to the front line X-Men team and given uniforms similar to the other X-Men at the conclusion of the film, when Xavier and the team meet the President in the White House. =X-Men: The Last Stand= Anna Paquin as Rogue in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) In X-Men: The Last Stand, a pharmaceutical company announces that they have a cure for the mutant gene. Rogue expresses interest, longing to touch someone. When Iceman begins to develop a friendship with Kitty Pryde, Rogue leaves to seek out the cure; Iceman follows her to the pharmaceutical company, but cannot find her. At the end, she returns to the school, revealing she had taken the cure, to Iceman's disappointment, but they hold hands, Rogue bare handed. An alternate ending reveals Rogue decided against taking the cure and holds Iceman's hand with gloves on. =X-Men: Days of Future Past= Paquin reprised her role in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Bryan Singer initially announced that the character had been cut as her subplot in the film \\"became extraneous\\", but later clarified that while the bulk of her footage had been cut, she would still appear in the film. In July 2014, producer Lauren Shuler Donner confirmed that Paquin's deleted scenes would be included in an \\"director's cut\\" version of the film. Under the title X-Men: Days of Future Past - The Rogue Cut, this version was released on July 14, 2015.Fox to Add Anna Paquin Back to ‚ÄòX-Men: Days of Future Past‚Äô Variety, Retrieved September 24, 2014 Rogue's status is unknown during the theatrical version of the film, since Bobby Drake is shown to be in a relationship with Kitty Pryde. Although Rogue makes a brief cameo near the end of the film, in the new timeline, together with Bobby. The Rogue Cut A subplot in the alternate version of the film involves Xavier, Magneto, and Bobby going on a mission to rescue Rogue after Kitty is stabbed by Wolverine, so Rogue could take over Kitty's role in sending Logan back to the past while Kitty rests due to the strain from maintaining the temporal link. Although Xavier believed that Rogue was dead, Bobby reveals that she had been captured by the Sentinels' human agents and was being experimented on in Cerebro - the only location where Xavier's mind couldn't reach - to try and duplicate her powers, with Bobby mentioning that he and other mutants have tried to rescue her, but the mansion was too heavily guarded. With Xavier's guidance, Bobby and Magneto manage to penetrate the mansion and rescue her, but Bobby is killed while holding off three Sentinels to allow Magneto and Rogue to escape. When Rogue arrives at the hideout, she absorbs Kitty's powers and takes over the role of holding Wolverine's mind in the past, with a suggestion that Logan is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. Once the timeline is altered by Wolverine, like in the theatrical version of the film, Rogue is shown to be alive and well, and back with Bobby. =Other film appearances= The Wolverine co-writer Mark Bomback revealed that Rogue was originally intended to appear in the film, but was written out. Paquin stated that she would enjoy playing Rogue again, as long as the character is shown with the power of flight. Paquin confirmed that she wouldn't have appeared in the unproduced film Gambit. However, Paquin later clarified that what she meant was that she did not know whether or not the character would be in the film. Video games * Rogue appears in many X-Men video games.

A fourth station, Amsterdam Aletta Jacobslaan, was planned but it was never opened; today, the Metro station Henk Sneevlietweg is situated on the proposed site. In 1997 the Metro line 50 opened, running parallel with the line between Isolatorweg (between Amsterdam Centraal and Sloterdijk) and Henk Sneevlietweg (south of Amsterdam Lelylaan). De Vlugtlaan station was closed in 2000 as part of the project to open the Hemboog which would link Schiphol with North Holland.

I was a thrower and not a pitcher, she admitted. In that season, she collected a 3.38 earned run average in eight innings of work while playing 25 games at outfield. Fort Wayne advanced again to the playoffs, losing to the Grand Rapids Chicks in the best-of-three first round series.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book Smith opened 1950 with the Peoria Redwings. She finished with a 2‚Äì0 record and a 1.80 ERA in four relief appearances. As a hitter, she went 58‚Äìfor‚Äì267 (.217) with 36 runs and 14 RBI in 89 games, including 10 doubles and three triples, while stealing 12 bases. Smith had her first good season in 1951, collecting a .233 average with 10 doubles and 38 stolen bases, driving in 30 runs while scoring 50 times in 93 games. She made 18 appearances on the mound, posting a 7‚Äì7 record and a 2.92 ERA in a career-high 111 innings. For the next three years Smith played for the Grand Rapids Chicks, a strong team managed by Woody English, which included talented players as Jean Geissinger, Pepper Paire, Doris Satterfield, Dorothy Stolze, Connie Wisniewski and Alma Ziegler. Smith shared outfield duties with Geissinger, Satterfield and Wisniewski, hitting .196 in 46 games while going 1‚Äì2 as a reliever. Grand Rapids advanced to the playoffs, but was swept by the South Bend Blue Sox in the best-of-three series on strong pitching by Jean Faut. Smith had a solid season in 1953, hitting .227 with 73 stolen bases and a .343 OBP in a career-high 114 games, being surpassed only by Fort Wayne's Betty Foss for the most stolen bases (80). She also posted career numbers in hits (91), runs (86), doubles (20), triples (5) and steals, while walking 71 times and tying for third in doubles. In the best-of-three first round series, third place Kalamazoo Lassies disposed of first place Fort Wayne, and second place Grand Rapids drew fourth place Rockford. In the best- of-three final series, Grand Rapids swept Kalamazoo behind complete game victories by Mary Lou Studnicka and Earlene Risinger. In Game 1, Studnicka limited the Lassies to seven hits in a 7‚Äì2 victory, while Risinger drove in two runs and struck out nine to whip Kalamazoo, 4‚Äì3, in a cold weather, shortened seven-inning game. Smith went 3‚Äìfor‚Äì10 and scored a run in the finals. In her final season of 1954, Smith batted .252 (78‚Äìfor‚Äì309) with nine triples, three home runs 56 RBI and 88 walks, all career numbers. She also scored 74 runs and stole 28 bases, while collecting a notable .397 on-base percentage in 88 game appearances. Fort Wayne repeated the regular season title and faced Grand Rapids in the first round of the playoffs, while second place South Bend played fourth place Kalamazoo. As a member of the champion team, Davis played in the All-Star Game against an All-Stars team selected by the league's managers. Fort Wayne and Kalamazoo defeated their respective opponents and advanced to the best-of-five final series. 1954 Championship Title In Game 1 of the best-of-five series, the Kalamazoo Lassies defeated the Fort Wayne Daisies 17‚Äì9 behind a four-hit, seven strong innings from June Peppas, who also helped herself by hitting 2‚Äìfor‚Äì4, including one home run. Her teammates Carol Habben and Fern Shollenberger also slugged one each, and Chris Ballingall belted a grand slam. Pitching star Maxine Kline, who had posted an 18‚Äì7 record with 3.23 ERA for the Daisies during the regular season, gave up 11 runs in six innings and was credited with the loss. Katie Horstman connected two home runs for the Daisies in a lost cause, and her teammate Joanne Weaver slugged one. The Daisies bounced back in Game 2, hitting five home runs against the Lassies to win, 11‚Äì4. Horstman started the feat with a two-run home run to open the score in the first inning. In the rest of the game, Betty Weaver Foss added two homers with five RBI, while her sister Joanne and Geissinger added solo shots. Peppas, Nancy Mudge and Dorothy Schroeder homered for Kalamazoo. In Game 3, the Daisies won the Lassies, 8‚Äì7, fueled again by a heavy hitting by Joanne Weaver, who hit a double, a triple and a three-run home run in five at bats, driving in four runs. In Game 4, starter Gloria Cordes helped Kalamazoo to tie the series, pitching a complete game victory over the Daisies, 6‚Äì5. Habben drove in two runs who marked the difference, while Kline suffered her second loss of the Series. In decisive Game 5, Peppas pitched a clutch complete game and went 3‚Äìfor‚Äì5 with an RBI against her former Daisies team, winning by an 8‚Äì5 margin to give the Lassies the Championship title in the AAGPBL's last ever game. She received support from Balingall (3‚Äìfor‚Äì4) and Schroeder, who drove in the winning run in the bottom of the eight inning. Peppas finished with a .450 average in the Series and collected two of the three Lassies victories, to become the winning pitcher of the last game in the twelve-year history of the league.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League History Bill Allington All-Stars When the league was unable to continue in 1955, Smith joined several other players selected by former Daisies manager Bill Allington to play in the national touring team known as the All-Americans All-Stars. The team played 100 games, each booked in a different town, against male teams, while traveling over 10,000 miles in the manager's station wagon and a Ford Country Sedan. Besides Smith, the Allington All-Stars included players as Joan Berger, Gloria Cordes, Jeanie Descombes, Gertrude Dunn, Betty Foss, Mary Froning, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Maxine Kline, Dolores Lee, Magdalen Redman, Ruth Richard, Dorothy Schroeder, Dolly Vanderlip and Joanne Weaver, among others.The Patriotic Pinch Hitter: Bill Allington's All-American TeamWomen in Baseball: The Forgotten History ‚Äì Gai Ingham Berlage, Charley Gerard.

Life after baseball Following her baseball career, Smith settled down in Harbor Springs, Michigan, where she worked as a secretary at the Harbor Springs IGA and as a bookkeeper for Woodland Buildersand. She also mowed the meadows at Barnyard Golf on her John Deere tractor until retirement in 1992. Since 1980, Peppas and a group of friends began assembling a list of names and addresses of former AAGPBL players. Her work turned into a newsletter that resulted in the league‚Äôs first-ever reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed five years later and many former AAGPBL players continued to enjoy reunions, which became annual events in 1998. Smith attended the first reunion and regained communication with her teammates and old friends. Of the approximately 560 women who had played in the league, most had lost touch with the others, at least not until the reunion held in Chicago. The association was largely responsible for the opening of an AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, opened in , which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personalities. Smith, along with the rest of the league's girls, is now enshrined in the Hall. Jean Smith died in Harbor Springs, Michigan at the age of 82, following a brief illness.

The history of electricity sector in Canada has played a significant role in the economic and political life of the country since wide-scale industrial and commercial power services spread across the country in the 1880s.Electric power at The Canadian Encyclopedia, accessed September 1, 2019 The development of hydropower in the early 20th century has profoundly affected the economy and the political life in Canada and has come to symbolize the transition from \\"old \\" industrialism of the 19th century to a \\"new\\", modern and diversified, Canadian economy. As early as 1873, an electric arc light was demonstrated in Winnipeg Manitoba. But Canada's use of electricity as mass-market service began in earnest in 1881, when Ottawa entrepreneur Thomas Ahearn installed Canada's first water- powered generator at the Chaudiere Falls, and later that year a steam generator lit a public skating rink in downtown Toronto. By 1883, the Houses of Parliament and Toronto's Central National Exhibition were illuminated by electric lights. And by 1885, public street lighting had been introduced in many Canadian Cities, including Hamilton, Quebec, Montreal, and Ottawa - which became the first city in the world to electrically light all of its streets. In the 1890s, three competing firms in Ontario engaged in a competition to develop the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. After several years of delays, construction began on the two sites in 1902 and on a third in 1904. At the same time, a group of municipalities in southern Ontario set up utilities joined their efforts to obtain a stable supply of hydropower. Despite his initial reluctance, Ontario Premier George William Ross organized the Ontario Power Commission in 1903 to coordinate efforts. After the private companies refused to negotiate power deals, the government responded by setting up an enquiry headed by Adam Beck, who recommended the establishment of a publicly owned distribution system. The province established the Hydro Electric Commission of Ontario in 1906 and voters approved municipalization of power distribution a year later. The Commission began delivering power to cities and towns in October 1910. By World War I, 59,000 customers were connected to the grid in Ontario. In Manitoba and British Columbia, private companies were also quick to develop hydropower. The Nelson Electric Light Company was the first company to build a hydro site in British Columbia. February 1, 1896 it commenced operation producing power for the City of Nelson. The Sandon plant was second in March 1897. In Winnipeg, railroad tycoon William Mackenzie built the first plant built on the Winnipeg River to supply the Ogilvie mill. Mackenzie soon faced competition from the city of Winnipeg, after voters backed the construction of a $3.25 million publicly funded dam on the Winnipeg River in 1906. State control and rural electrification Construction of the first phase of the Beauharnois generating station, in 1930. A 1946 postage stamp, featuring hydroelectricity. Development of the electric sector accelerated after the First World War with the creation of provincial utilities in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, in the 1920s. Publicly owned electric companies put a strong focus on rural electrification and hydroelectric development. The Quebec government was a latecomer as far as its involvement in the electricity sector is concerned. After an anarchic period, the industry consolidated into a duopoly of investor-owned utilities. In Quebec's largest city, Montreal Light, Heat & Power (MLH&P;) became the dominant player through mergers with competitors.; see also In the rest of the province, Shawinigan Water & Power Company (SW&P;) attracted large industrial customers, aluminium smelters, carbide plants and pulp and paper mills, with an hydroelectric complex built on the Saint-Maurice River. In 1930, SW&P; had grown to become the leading power company in Quebec, and one of the largest hydroelectric companies in the world. Calls for nationalization of the industry began during the Great Depression, after a political scandal surrounded the construction of the Beauharnois Hydroelectric Power Station, on the Saint Lawrence River, west of Montreal.; Critics attacked the \\"electricity trust\\" for their abusive rates and excessive profits. The campaign, masterminded by Philippe Hamel and T.-D. Bouchard, led to the nationalization of MLH&P; and the creation of Hydro- Qu√©bec by the liberal government of Ad√©lard Godbout in 1944. The other electric companies were taken over by Hydro-Qu√©bec in 1963, following a snap election on the issue of electricity spearheaded by Ren√© L√©vesque, the provincial minister in charge of Natural Resources in the Jean Lesage government. Hydroelectric developments The Hugh Keenleyside Dam was built in the 1960s to fulfil Canada's obligations under the Columbia River Treaty. A 185-MW generating station was added in 2002. Hydro-Qu√©bec's Daniel-Johnson Dam (1968) is the largest multiple-arch buttress dam in the world. Under government leadership, provincial power companies invested heavily in the power sector to stimulate economic development. Premiers Joey Smallwood in Newfoundland, W. A. C. Bennett in British Columbia, Ed Schreyer in Manitoba and Robert Bourassa in Quebec shared this vision of hydropower as a major part of their provinces' industrial development policies. Hydroelectric mega- projects were undertaken by most provinces during the 1960s and 1970s. BC Hydro developed power stations along the Peace and Columbia Rivers. Manitoba Hydro undertook the Nelson River Hydroelectric Project. In Labrador, the controversial Churchill Falls Generating Station was built after 20 years of negotiations, and NB Power undertook the construction of the Mactaquac Dam, near Fredericton. But hydroelectric development was most active in Quebec. Between 1965 and 1984, Hydro-Qu√©bec built 7 large power stations on the Manicouagan and Outardes rivers and the first 3 plants of the 16,000-MW James Bay Project on La Grande River. The 5 plants of the second phase were built between 1987 and 1996. But ample supply and increased opposition to large hydroelectric projects by environmentalists and First Nations forced the postponement or cancellation of several proposed developments during the 1980s and 1990s, such as the Site C dam on the Peace River in British Columbia or the Great Whale project in Quebec. Nuclear energy Chalk River Laboratories, on the Ottawa River, in Chalk River, Ontario. The Pickering Nuclear Generating Station became operational in 1971.Canada has a long and storied nuclear history. The area of Great Bear Lake has provided uranium for the Manhattan Project and the first Canadian nuclear reactor, the ZEEP, was built in 1945. Two years later, the National Research Council of Canada began operations on the NRX (National Research Experimental) heavy-water reactor at Chalk River Laboratories, near Ottawa. In 1957, it was followed by the National Research Universal Reactor (NRU). In the meantime, Ontario Hydro, Canadian General Electric and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited began working on an experimental nuclear power plant, the Nuclear Power Demonstration, in Rolphton, Ontario, not far from Chalk River. The 22 MW reactor generated Canada's first nuclear energy to the grid on June 4, 1962. The first full- scale nuclear power plant, the Douglas Point Nuclear Generating Station, entered commercial service on September 26, 1968. Douglas Point generated 220 MW and was built for $91 million. The CANDU reactor was then built at three locations in Ontario in the next 25 years, in Pickering, Bruce County and Clarington. On the 20 nuclear reactors operational in Canada, only two are located outside Ontario: Gentilly-2, near Trois-Rivi√®res, Quebec, and Point Lepreau, west of Saint John, New Brunswick. Both became operational in 1983.

Spondulicks, spondoolicks, spondulacks, spondulics, and spondoolics are alternative spellings, and spondoolies is a modern variant. Etymology There are two views on the origin of the word. The most likely is from the Greek spondulox, which refers to a type of seashell from bivalves of the genus Spondylus. The Spondylus shell was used as neolithic jewelry and also as an early form of currency.The United States Service Magazine, vol 3. June, 1865. p. 539. \\"A Word About Slang.\\" \\"'Spondulix' is suggestive. It recalls the wampum of the poor Indian, the cowrie of the Ethiopian, and resuscitates the ancient blackmail man, who, as his kinsman, the dun, does today, called upon his victim to 'shell out.' For 'Spondulix' is conchological. The spondylus (from Greek spondulos,) is a shell inequivalve . . .\\" The interior of two fossil valves of Spondylus from the Pliocene of Cyprus There is global evidence of the importance of the spondylus shell. Archaeological evidencefor example, see Archaeology in Bulgaria, 2007-2009 by Ivo D. Cholakov & Krastyu Chulakev, published in the American Journal of Archaeology (2011) shows that people in Europe were trading the shells as jewelry as long as 5,000 years ago. Spondylus shells from the Aegean Sea were harvested and then worked into bracelets, bangles and ornaments and transported throughout the continent. It is thought that the shells were also traded as an early form of currency due to their mother-of-pearl-like appearance. There may also be a connection with spondylo-, a prefix which means spine or vertebrae, based on the similarity between a stack of coins and a spine. This is referenced in an 1867 book by John Mitchell BonnellJohn Mutchell Bonnell, A Manual of the Art of Prose Composition: for the Use of Colleges and Schools, J.P. Morton and Co.

Alternatively - it could come from the Latin verb spondƒìre, meaning \\"to promise.\\" Bank notes in England and elsewhere in the 19th Century stated \\"I promise to pay the bearer ....\\" (the equivalent of the value of the note). Bank notes today continue with this promise. Early written use The earliest recorded occurrence of the word as slang for money appears to have been in the late 19th century in the United States. The New Oxford Dictionary of English marks the origin as US slang. However, according to the Cassell Dictionary of Slang,Cassell Dictionary of Slang, Weidenfeld & Nicolson (2000) the term can be traced back to the mid-19th century in England. Other sources also suggest a mid-19th- century origin.

History The Meysembourg family is first mentioned in the 12th century when Dame de Meysembourg was in the service of Ermesinde, Countess of Luxembourg. Historic references show that Walter de Meysembourg was the propretor in 1176 and Eberhart de Maysembourg in 1296. In 1443, the castle was destroyed by Philip the Good but was rebuilt before 1500. It was again destroyed by Mar√©chal de Boufflers troops in 1683‚Äì84. All that remains of the former castle are the chapel, the moat and part of the outer wall. Custine de Wiltz, the last in line to inherit the property, fled during the French invasion in 1794.

Walker is the inventor of more than 20 different knife mechanisms including the Walker Linerlock for which he secured a trademark in 1980.Walker, Greg (1993). Battle Blades: A Professional's Guide to Combat/Fighting Knives (Hardcover), pages 37‚Äì38 Early life Walker began his career as a jeweler, until 1975 when his wife, Patricia Walker, gave him a Gerber knife and a copy of American Blade magazine. Walker noted similarities between his jewelry and custom art knives and decided he would try his hand at knifemaking. Knife making Walker began making knives full-time in 1980 with fixed-blade art knives. When a customer asked him to make sheaths for these knives, Walker found the task more labor-intensive and less enjoyable than making the knives. As a result, he decided from then on to make folding knives which would not require a sheath, which led to his development of the Walker Linerlock. In 1981, Walker began a limited partnership with knifemaker Ron Lake. The two makers have collaborated on numerous designs including the LAWKS. In 1985, Walker became a voting member of the Knifemakers' Guild. In 2004, Walker was inducted into the Blade magazine's Cutlery Hall of Fame. Inventions Closeup image of Linerlock (TM) Walker has patented or trademarked more than 20 different mechanisms related to locks and composite cutting blades on pocketknives. Most notably, Walker is known for the invention of the Walker Linerlock in 1981, which has since become the industry standard in folding knife mechanisms. What sets Walker's design apart is a long split in one of the liners which acts as a leaf-spring in the liner of the knife accompanied. This feature cuts down on mechanical stress. An additional feature of the Linerlock is the addition of a ball detent. This additional feature eliminates rubbing and scratch-marks when the knife is opened and closed. Other inventions include the \\"Lake and Walker Safety System\\" or LAWKS, BLADELock, Linerlock, Ball bearing lock, and Tough Lock. Walker has collaborated with numerous companies in efforts to make his designs more accessible to the public as his original hand made knives are in demand and sell in the thousands. Some of the production companies he has partnered with include Spyderco, Columbia River Knife and Tool, Schrade, B√∂ker, and Klotzli. Walker's knives and designs have inspired many other custom knifemakers, notably Bob Terzuola and Ernest Emerson. Terzuola credits Walker with teaching him how to make a linerlock folder and Emerson has said that seeing a Walker knife at a gun show gave him the inspiration to become a custom knifemaker. Walker's knives can be found at Artifex Gallery in Taos, and in galleries and shows around the world.

He currently serves as the Chancellor of Kampala International University, Uganda. He is the director of the Makerere Institute of Social Research (MISR), the Herbert Lehman Professor of Government at the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University and the Professor of Anthropology, Political Science and African Studies at Columbia University. Early life and education Mamdani is a third generation Ugandan of Indian ancestry. He was born in Mumbai and grew up in Kampala. Both his parents were born in the neighbouring Tanganyika Territory (present day Tanzania). He was educated at the Government Primary School in Dar es Salaam, Government Primary School in Masaka, K.S.I. Primary School in Kampala, Shimoni and Nakivubo Government Primary Schools in Kampala, and Old Kampala Senior Secondary School. He received a scholarship along with 26 other Ugandan students to study in the United States. He was part of the 1963 group of the Kennedy Airlift, a scholarship program that brought hundreds of East Africans to universities in the United States and Canada between 1959 and 1963. Airlift to America. How Barack Obama Sr, John F. Kennedy, Tom Mboya, and 800 East African Students Changed Their World and Ours by Tom Shachtman. St. Martins Press. 2009 The scholarships were part of the independence gift that the new nation had received. Mamdani joined the University of Pittsburgh in 1963 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1967. He was among the many students in the northern US who made the bus journey south to Birmingham, Alabama organised by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to participate in the civil rights movement. He was jailed during the march and was allowed to make a phone call. Mamdani called the Ugandan Ambassador in Washington, D.C., for assistance. The ambassador asked him why he was \\"interfering in the internal affairs of a foreign country\\", to which he responded by saying that this was not an internal affair but a freedom struggle and that they too had gotten their freedom only last year. Soon after he learnt about Karl Marx's work from an FBI visit. He then joined The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and graduated in 1968 with a Master of Arts in political science and Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy in 1969. He attained his Doctor of Philosophy in government from Harvard University in 1974. His thesis was titled Politics and Class Formation in Uganda. Career Mamdani returned to Uganda in early 1972 and joined Makerere University as a teaching assistant at the same time conducting his doctoral research; only to be expelled later that year by Idi Amin due to his ethnicity. He left Uganda for a refugee camp in the United Kingdom in early November just as the three- month deadline was approaching for people of Asian heritage to leave the country. He left England in mid-1973 after being recruited to the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. In Dar es Salaam, he completed writing his thesis and was active with anti-Amin groups. In 1979, he attended the Moshi Conference as an observer and returned to Uganda after Amin was overthrown following the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War as a Frontier Interne of the World Council of Churches. He was posted with the Church of Uganda offices in Mengo and was assigned to research the former regime's foreign relations. His report was published as a book: Imperialism and Fascism in Uganda. In 1984, while attending a conference in Dakar, Senegal, he became stateless after his citizenship was withdrawn by the government under Milton Obote due to his criticism of its policies. He returned to Dar es Salaam and was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor for the spring semester in 1986. After Obote was deposed for the second time, Mamdani once again returned to Uganda in June 1986. He was the founding director of the Centre for Basic Research (CBR), Uganda's first research non-governmental organisation from 1987 to 2006. He was also a visiting professor at the University of Durban- Westville in South Africa (January to June in 1993), at the Nehru Memorial Museum & Library in New Delhi (January to June in 1995) and at Princeton University (1995‚Äì96). In 1996, he was appointed as the inaugural holder of the AC Jordan chair of African studies at the University of Cape Town. He left after having disagreements with the administration on his draft syllabus of a foundation course on Africa called \\"Problematizing Africa\\". This was dubbed the \\"Mamdani Affair\\". From 1998 to 2002, he served as president of the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa. In December 2001, he gave a speech on \\"Making Sense of Violence in Postcolonial Africa\\" at the Nobel Centennial Symposia in Oslo, Norway. In 2008, in an open online poll, Mamdani was voted as the ninth \\"top public intellectual\\" in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by Prospect Magazine (UK) and Foreign Policy (US). His essays have appeared in the London Review of Books, among other journals.  Work  Mamdani specialises in the study of African and international politics, colonialism and post‚Äêcolonialism, and the politics of knowledge production. His works explore the intersection between politics and culture, a comparative study of colonialism since 1452, the history of civil war and genocide in Africa, the Cold War and the War on Terror, and the history and theory of human rights. His current research \\"takes as its point of departure his 1996 book, Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Colonialism\\". In Citizen and Subject, Mamdani argues that the post- colonial state cannot be understood without a clear analysis of the institutional colonial state. The nature of the colonial state in Africa was a response to the dilemma of the 'native question' and argued that it took on the form of a 'Bifurcated State'. This was characterised by 'direct rule' on the one hand which was a form of 'urban civil power' and focused on the exclusion of natives from civil freedoms guaranteed to citizens in civil society. Whilst on the other it was characterised by 'indirect rule' which was rural in nature and involved the incorporation of 'natives' into a 'state enforced customary order' enforced by a 'rural tribal authority' which he termed as 'decentralised despotism'. This state was 'Janus faced' and 'contained a duality: two forms of power under a single hegemonic authority'. In the post-colonial realm, the urban sphere was to an extent deracialised but the rural one remained subject to quasi colonial control whether at the hands of conservative rulers for whom it provided their own power base or those of radical ones with centralised authoritarian projects of their own. In this way both experiences reproduced 'one part of the dual legacy of the bifurcated state and created their own distinctive version of despotism'. Mamdani analyses extensive historical case studies in South Africa and Uganda to argue that colonial rule tapped into authoritarian possibilities whose legacies often persist after independence. Challenging conventional perceptions of apartheid in South Africa as exceptional, he argues that apartheid was the generic form of the colonial state in Africa, encompassing both British 'indirect rule' and French 'association' strategies.

It was located west of Anchorage, Alaska. History Bethel AFS was a continental defense radar station constructed to provide the United States Air Force early warning of an attack by the Soviet Union on Alaska. A radar site was initially activated in September 1951 at Bethel, Alaska, manned by Federalized Alaska Air National Guardsmen and equipped with a World War II AN/TPS-1B radar as a result of the Korean War and the threat of a communist attack on Alaska. The guardsmen were designated as Detachment \\"C-3\\", 626th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, and commanded by the 10th Air Division at Fire Island AFS near Anchorage. The guardsmen were returned to state control in March 1952 and the provisional station was closed. Plans were made for a permanent radar site beginning in late 1956. In 1957, acreage was acquired approximately 5 miles west of Bethel, Alaska for construction of the station. Using the existing port facilities at Bethel on the Kuskokwim River, Towed barges were able to land construction equipment and material at the town, which was transported along a gravel road to the construction site. In addition, an airstrip was constructed near the site, about halfway between the station and Bethel, allowing cargo transports and personnel to fly into and out of the area. The station and radar site was constructed on a flat area just to the west of some hills. The buildings were, except for the civil engineering building connected by heated hallways. As a result, personnel stationed there, with only very few exceptions, were able to wear \\"summer\\" uniforms year round, unless they had a need to go outside during the winter season. The coverings of the station's three radar towers were heated from within to keep the covering from becoming brittle from extreme cold, and thus subject to being damaged or destroyed by high winds. Tours at the station were limited to one year because of the psychological strain and physical hardships. The 713th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron operated AN/FPS-8, AN/FPS-4, AN/FPS-6, and AN/FPS-6B radars. As a surveillance station, its mission was to monitor the airspace for aircraft activity and provide information 24/7 to the air defense Direction Center at Fire Island AFS near Anchorage, where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. The Alaskan Air Command, after investigating various options, constructed a White Alice Communications System communications site at the station, operated by the Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). The Bethel site was activated in 1958. Bethel Air Force Station was very expensive to maintain, and was inactivated due to budget reductions on 15 May 1963, its mission being taken over by other AAC surveillance radar sites with upgraded and more capable equipment. Today the site remains abandoned and deteriorating. Aerial imagery clearly shows abandoned buildings, radar towers and communications antennas, all in a highly deteriorated state.

The performance of a hefsek taharah is needed to initiate the counting of seven days absent of blood discharge.  Mishnaic source  The source for a Jewish woman to perform an \\"examination\\" is quoted implicitly in the Mishnah; There is a difference of opinion amongst halakhic sources whether the self-examination is D'Oraita (required by Torah law) or D'Rabbanan (rabbinical requirement).  Methodology  Bedikah example In the Orthodox Jewish community, women may test whether menstruation has ceased; this ritual is known as the hefsek tahara. The ritual requires that the cloth used to perform this test is first checked carefully to ensure that it is clean of any marks, colored threads, or specks; the cloth itself can be any clean white cloth, although there are small cloths designed for this ritual, known as bedikah (meaning checking). In the Orthodox Jewish community, further rituals are practices toward assurance regarding the cessation of the menstrual flow. After the hefsek tahara, some women insert a cloth (or, in modern times, a tampon), consequently known as a moch dachuk, for between 18 minutes and an hour, to ensure that there is no uterine blood; this must be done carefully, as it could otherwise irritate the mucous membrane, causing bleeding unrelated to menstruation. If there is any fear of irritation causing bleeding, a rabbi may waive this practice. Some women also repeat the \\"bedikah\\" each morning and evening of the seven days subsequent to the end of menstruation. Another tradition is the wearing of white underwear and use of white bedding during this period; conversely, the rest of the time, when not counting the \\"seven clean days\\", some women who suffer from spotting deliberately use coloured underwear and coloured toilet paper, since it is only when blood is seen on white material that it has tumah status in Jewish law. When not during their seven \\"clean\\" days, all women are advised to wear colored undergarments. = The cloth = The bedikah cloth or \\"checking cloth,\\" called an id [\\"cloth\\"] or an \\"eid\\"[\\"witness\\"] in Hebrew, is a clean piece of white cloth used in the process of purifying a niddah. It is used by observant Jewish women to determine whether they have finished menstruation. The cloth is inserted into the vagina, and if no blood is found, the woman may start counting the seven blood-free days. On each of these days, she performs this examination in the morning and in the later afternoon before sunset. If no blood is found, she may go to the mikveh on the eighth evening after nightfall, and then engage in relations with her husband.Mishneh Torah Kedushah Laws of forbidden relations 4:6 This practice is also occasionally used by Jewish men to check if he has gotten blood on himself from his wife after relations to determine whether she menstruates during relations.Mishneh Torah Kedushah Laws of forbidden relations 4:14 Such cloths are about two by four inches, and are available at local Judaica stores, the local mikveh, stores in Orthodox neighborhoods in Israel and pharmacies and some supermarkets in Israel, or may be cut from clean all-white soft cotton or linen fabric.Mishneh Torah Kedushah Laws of forbidden relations 4:15 = Newlywed = According to Orthodox authorities, a bride who experiences bleeding from the hymen upon her marriage's consummation counts only four days before performing a hefsek tahara, instead of the usual five.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands in an isolated position at the end of a private drive overlooking the River Lambourn, to the southeast of the village of Great Shefford. History The church has its origins in the pre-Norman era, but the earliest fabric in the present church dates from the later part of the 11th century. The chancel was added in the 13th century, a south chapel in the 16th century, and a south porch in the 18th century. Worship ceased in the church in 1870, and its congregation went to a new church dedicated to the Holy Innocents, which has since been demolished. The church was restored in 1887. The parish of East Shefford amalgamated with the parish of West Shefford in 1926, becoming the parish of Great Shefford. In 1958 there were plans to demolish St Thomas' but this was prevented by the Friends of Friendless Churches. The church was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund, the forerunner of the Churches Conservation Trust in 1972. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in flint and stone, with stone dressings. Parts of the walls are rendered. The roofs are tiled. Its plan is simple and consists of a nave with a brick south porch, and a chancel with a south chapel. At the west end is a wooden bellcote with a lead roof. The nave has a Norman north window and, to its west, a three-light window. In the south wall of the nave is a two-light and a single-light window. The chancel has a four-light window in its north wall and a three-light east window. Cutting through the roof of the chapel is a dormer window. =Interior= The major feature inside the church is the alabaster effigial monument of Thomas Fettiplace, who died in 1447, and his wife, Beatrice, who died in 1442. Beatrice was supposedly a member of the royal family of Portugal. On the north wall of the chancel is an altar tomb to John Fettiplace, who died in 1524, and his wife Dorothy. The tomb is plain but it is surrounded by canopy containing brasses. On the floor of the chancel are 16th-century tiles. The font is Norman and has a cylindrical limestone bowl. On the south side of the chancel is a Norman limestone pillar piscina. On the wall above the chancel arch are 12th-century paintings, and on other walls are painted texts.

Developed at CESBIO since 1992, DART model was patented in 2003. It is freeware for scientific activities.  General Description  DART model simulates, simultaneously in several wavelengths of the optical domain (e.g., visible and thermal infrared), the radiative budget and remotely sensed images of any Earth scene (natural / urban with /without relief), for any sun direction, any atmosphere, any view direction and any sensor FTM. It was designed to be precise, easy to use and adapted for operational use. For that, it simulates: *Terrestrial landscape. *The atmosphere (optional simulation). *The space or airborne radiometric sensor (optional simulation). It simulates any landscape as a 3D matrice of cells that contain turbid material and triangles. Turbid material is used for simulating vegetation (e.g., tree crowns, grass, agricultural crops,...) and the atmosphere. Triangles are used for simulating translucent and opaque surfaces that makes up topography, urban elements and 3D vegetation. DART can use structural and spectral data bases (atmosphere, vegetation, soil,...). It includes a LIDAR simulation mode. = General Information On Radiative Transfer = The approaches used to simulate radiative transfer differ on 2 levels: mathematical method of resolution and mode of representation of the propagation medium. These two levels are in general dependent. The models of radiative transfer are often divided into 2 categories associated with the 2 principal modes of representation of the landscape: homogeneous or heterogeneous representation. For the models known as homogeneous (Idso and of Wit, 1970; Ross, 1981; Verhoef, 1984; Myneni et al., 1989), the landscape is represented by a constant horizontal distribution of absorbing and scattering elements (sheets, branches, etc...). On the other hand, for the models known as heterogeneous, the landscape is represented by a no uniform space distribution of unspecified elements of the landscape (North, 1996; Govaerts, 1998). = Simulation of the \\"Earth ‚Äì Atmosphere\\" scene = DART simulates radiative transfer in the \\"Earth-Atmosphere\\" system, for any wavelength in the optical domain (shortwaves : visible, thermal infrared,...). Its approach combines the ray tracing and the discrete ordinate methods. It works with natural and urban landscapes (forests with different types of trees, buildings, rivers,...), with topography and atmosphere above and within the landscape. It simulates light propagation from solar irradiance (Top of Atmosphere) and/or thermal emission within the scene.  Context  The study of the functioning of Continental surfaces requires the understanding of the various energetic and physiologic mechanisms that influence these surfaces. For example, the radiation absorbed in the visible spectral domain is the major energy source for vegetation photosynthesis. Moreover, energy and mass fluxes at the \\"Earth ‚Äì Atmosphere\\" interface affect surface functioning, and consequently climatology. In this context, Earth observation from space (i.e., space remote sensing) is an indispensable tool, due to its unique potential to provide synoptic and continuous surveys of the Earth, at different time and space scales. The difficulty in studying continental surfaces arises from the complexity of the energetic and physiologic processes involved and also from the different time and space scales concerned. It comes also from the complexity of satellite remote sensing space and from its links to quantities that characterize Earth functioning. These remarks underline the need of models, because only these can couple and gather within a single scheme all concerned processes.

History The North London Railway (NLR) was founded in 1850 with the intention of operating a network of railway lines throughout north London that connected to the East India and West India Docks. The company's main headquarters was at Bow, and from there a connection to the London and Blackwall Railway's route allowed the NLR's trains access to a terminus in the City of London, in this case Fenchurch Street. However, this meant that, in order to reach the City, the NLR's trains had to take a fairly circuitous route, and so the company decided to build its own central terminus. In 1861, the North London Railway Act was passed giving permission to the NLR to build an extension from its main line through Hackney to a site at Old Broad Street. The majority of the route was built on a viaduct from Dalston, with a triangular junction allowing access to the main line in both directions. The extension had four new stations: *Dalston Junction - the closest station to the main line, with the junction heading both east and west just north of it, *Haggerston *Shoreditch *Broad Street - the NLR's new terminus Passenger services along the Kingsland Viaduct to Broad Street began in November 1865. Initially, the branch had three running lines; a fourth line was added in 1874. The route was electrified in 1916 using the 600 V DC third and fourth rail system, with the purchase of new electric rolling stock. However, only the western five platforms at Broad Street were electrified. Both Haggerston and Shoreditch stations, as well as the rest of the branch, received heavy damage in the Second World War, and were closed in 1940, leaving Dalston Junction as the only intermediate station between Broad Street and the main line. At this time, passenger numbers on the branch were declining. The eastern route to Poplar was closed in 1944, while services from the rest of London declined. The route was earmarked for closure under the Beeching Axe in 1963, but remained open due to local pressure. However, the opening of other routes led to further services being withdrawn until it was decided in 1985 that the route would be mothballed. By then had opened to serve the Dalston area, and both Dalston Junction and Broad Street were closed. Today Although the route was mothballed following the closure of Broad Street in 1986, the trackbed along the Kingsland Viaduct remained intact. As a consequence, much of the route was restored when Transport for London took possession of it to construct the East London Line extension. This has seen the reopening of Dalston Junction and Haggerston stations, as well as the construction of a new station at Hoxton. This follows the old route until it reaches Shoreditch High Street, where it then connects to a new build route towards Whitechapel.

Looney Tunes cartoon written by Mike Maltese and directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on December 9, 1953. Plot The short begins with a narrator (voiced by an uncredited Robert C. Bruce) who introduces a 5 inch tall dwarf elephant. Its huge roar causes a dock worker to faint. In the next scene, the elephant is hogging the bird bath in a yard. The owner of the house phones the police about it, but is merely taken to a mental hospital because they believe he's crazy. Next, a woman hanging up the laundry in another yard is handed clothes pins by the elephant. When she notices, she screams in horror and runs inside, taking refuge in a washer. Next, a man exits an optometry clinic with new glasses, but when he sees the tiny elephant, he marches back inside, punches the optometrist, and leaves, because he thought the doctor made him see things that aren't there. Next, in a high rise apartment, a mother is informed by her daughter that an elephant is in her room. The skeptical mother puts her back to bed. Later, the daughter is bringing a piece of cake to the elephant. This time, the mother goes into her room to look in the dollhouse. When the tiny elephant roars at her, the mother faints in shock. Later, a drunk man leaves a bar, and sees the tiny elephant (who gets the man's attention by roaring). He checks his watch and then simply says: \\"You're late.\\" As he wanders off, he mutters to himself: \\"He always used to be pink!\\" After that, a line of elephants at a circus includes the tiny elephant, which freaks out one of the other elephants. A cat chases a mouse under a tent, only to grab the tiny elephant instead. When it roars, the cat turns into a monkey. Later, at a psychiatrist's office, a woman is talking about her life and when the psychiatrist sees the tiny elephant (who had just drank all the water from his drinking glass), he switches places with the woman. Then, the cartoon cuts to a man painting a flag pole. A crowd is watching below. The elephant approaches and roars, causing the spectators to join the flag pole painter. After this, various newspaper headlines describe the panic in the city: \\"Mass hallucination grips city\\", \\"Hundreds Claim to Have Seen Tiny Elephant\\", \\"I Seen It.\\", \\"Picayune Pachyderm Panics Populace\\", \\"Noted Scientist to Take to Air to Calm Alarmed Citizenry\\". The last headline leads into the final set piece: Robert Bruce Cameron, said scientist, says the elephant is just a figment of everyone's imagination. The tiny elephant walks into view, moving the microphone from the oblivious scientist as he reads his statement to the moderator who is petrified at the bizarre sight. The moderator says that Cameron's views don't necessarily represent the views of the station, and faints. The tiny elephant roars as the cartoon ends. (The moderator is named \\"Mr. Pratt\\", a nod to Warner Bros. layout artist Hawley Pratt, who would go on to create the Pink Panther character for DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises). Legacy The tiny elephant makes a cameo in 1959's Unnatural History. The cartoon was edited into Daffy Duck's Quackbusters. Here, it begins from the bird bath scene and leaves out the scenes in the high-rise apartment, the circus scene, the cat, and the flagpole. Also the newspaper headlines had swapped round so they are shown in this order; \\"Mass Hallucination Grips City\\", \\"Picayune Pachyderm Panics Populace\\", \\"Hundreds Claim To Have Seen Tiny Elephant\\" and \\"I Seen It\\". The last headline had been changed from \\"Noted Scientist to Take to Air to Calm Alarmed Citizenry\\" to \\"Sightings of Tiny Elephant Continue\\" to tie in with the story; Daffy Duck, having read about the mass panic through the last headline, was interviewed on Frightline with Zed Toppel and dismissed the elephant sighting as mere nonsense, but was then left publicly disgraced when the elephant walked past his desk (Daffy not noticing until the elephant roared at him).

WAM is a technique where several ground receiving stations listen to signals transmitted from an aircraft; then the aircraft's location is mathematically calculated -- typically in two dimensions, with the aircraft providing its altitude.\\"Eurocontrol Promoting Wide Area Multilateration Surveillance\\", Flt Tech Online, January 07, 2007. Aircraft position, altitude and other data are ultimately transmitted, through an Air Traffic Control automation system, to screens viewed by air traffic controllers for separation of aircraft.\\"FAA Fact Sheet, Wide Area Multilateration in Colorado,\\" www.faa.gov. It can and has been interfaced to terminal or en-route automation systems.  System performance  WAM provides performance that is comparable to secondary surveillance radar (SSR) in terms of accuracy, probability of detection, update rate and availability/ reliability. Performance varies as a function of the location of aircraft in relation to the ground sensors. WAM is adaptable to interrogation rates, output modes and output periods. Update rates and probability of detection can be tailored to various applications such as precision runway monitoring (PRM), terminal maneuvering area (TMA) and En-route surveillance. Interrogation rates can be reduced by passively processing replies to SSR or traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS) interrogations.  Avionics  WAM operates with SSR Mode A/C, Mode S, and Mode S ES messages; no aircraft equipage change or mandate is necessary. For ADS-B equipped aircraft, WAM provides an ADS-B target report as well as a multilateration target report. WAM can complement ADS-B by providing transitional surveillance for non ADS-B equipped targets, and can be used for ADS-B validation.  Integration into automation systems  WAM incorporates new ground station output formats specifically designed for WAM and ADS-B: * ASTERIX CAT19 for WAM system status * ASTERIX CAT20 for WAM reports * ASTERIX CAT21 for ADS-B reports = Implementation considerations = The primary advantage of WAM is that it can be installed in mountainous terrain, where the line-of-sight propagation paths required for SSRs would be blocked. A second advantage is that, in many situations, its cost is lower than that of SSRs. Operational implementations include the U.S. Western Colorado and Juneau, Alaska areas and the Innsbruck, Austria region. It is reported that a WAM system has been installed in the Czech Republic. WAM systems are also used to verify aircraft altimeter accuracy in the U.S. and Europe. Siting and installation The design of a WAM system is dependent upon proper site selections. Below are some issues to consider when selecting sites: * Accessibility (limited by terrain, weather, availability of power and communications, etc.) * Availability of power/backup power, communications * Site ownership: customer or local/state government owned sites may be preferred to commercial sites * Environmental impact * Available space * Interference with other site equipment * Site acquisition and preparation: leasing, permits, required construction, etc. * Installation season (extreme weather, high snows, high seas) * Accessibility during installation * Special training (survival training for oil platforms, tower climbing) Communications  Availability of communications is an important factor in site selection. Bandwidth, latency and reliability all need to be considered. In many cases, a dedicated network is not available. The system needs to rely on third party commercial communications such as local microwave networks, telecommunications provider, or satellite communications.

The camp was the training grounds for recruits and a hospital for the wounded. In 1863 it became a prison camp called Camp Kearney for members of the Sioux, or Dakota, tribe that were involved in raids in Minnesota. The camp was decommissioned after the release of the prisoners in 1866. Camp McClellan The land the camp was built on belonged to Thomas Russel Allen of St. Louis, Missouri and consisted of over . The property was directly across the Mississippi River from the Rock Island Arsenal, that was also the site of a prisoner of war camp that held Confederate soldiers. Iowa's Adjutant General Nathaniel B. Baker moved his offices to Davenport and established Camp McClellan as a training camp for the volunteer soldiers. Lieutenant Colonel William Hall was responsible for organizing and running the camp. The camp was named in honor of General George B. McClellan. It was the largest of the five camps that were in and around the city of Davenport. 40,000 of the nearly 80,000 Iowa troops that fought the war passed through its gates. They were also treated in the camp's hospital and mustered out from the camp when the war was over. J. W. Willard was given the contract to construct the necessary buildings and a local company, French & Davis, provided the lumber. They built a dozen frame buildings with 52 double berths for bunks, a mess hall, a commissary, a canteen, a granary and officers quarters. There were enough stalls for over 100 horses. More barracks were completed as quickly as possible because of the large number of recruits that were coming into the camp. A thousand recruits would have been at Camp McClellan at one time after it first opened. Because of the haste, the quarters were poorly constructed and started to leak. Lieutenant Colonel Hall was put in charge to bring the camp up to military standards, maximize security and training efficiency. Colonel Hare of Muscatine, Iowa took over for Hall on October 11, 1861. Camp McClellan was the rendezvous of the Eighth, Eleventh, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Sixteenth regiments of infantry, and also of recruits for the older regiments. The number of troops at the camp was diminished by April 1862 and the Relief Association of Davenport began to refit the camp for an army hospital. However, it was thought the war would soon be over and it was decided that the camp was needed as a prison camp and so walls were built. Despite these plans the war raged on and the number of recruits increased, especially after the draft was instituted. As the sick and wounded returned from the war, they were brought to the camp's hospital. It contained a pharmacy, clean rooms, and a dietary kitchen that were influenced by Iowa Sanitary Agent Annie Wittenmyer. Camp Kearney Boundaries of Camp McClellan shown over a map of present-day Davenport, Iowa Camp McClellan became a prison camp of a different kind in 1863. The federal government imprisoned 277 male members of the Sioux tribe, 16 women and two children and one member of the Ho-Chunk tribe, also known as the Winnebago. The men were involved in the Dakota War of 1862 in Minnesota and were held in the camp as prisoners because President Abraham Lincoln commuted their death sentences. It was felt that Davenport was far enough away from Minnesota to protect the Native Americans from lynch mobs. The steamboat Favorite arrived from Mankato, Minnesota on April 25. The prisoners were taken to their quarters without incident. They were given beef and four bushels of corn per day, and ten of the women were assigned to cook. They were also given bread, which they did not like. A wall was built in December 1863 along the western road that traveled through the camp so as to separate the Native Americans from the recruits. The prison camp portion was renamed Camp Kearney and it was reconfigured to house the guards and the officers. Conditions in the camp became unsanitary and there was some hostility on the part of local citizens that the native Americans were there. The hostile sentiments died down enough that labor parties were taken to work in the nearby farm fields. Major Ten Broeck and Captain Judd, who were in charge of the prison, assured the community that they would be kept safe. President Lincoln pardoned and freed 27 of the Sioux in August 1864. and they were sent to the Dakota Territories. On April 10, 1866 President Andrew Johnson released the 177 remaining prisoners from the camp to a reservation in Santee, Nebraska. The rest of the Native Americans who were held prisoner died in the camp and were buried in unmarked graves in the vicinity. Scientists from the Davenport Academy of Natural Science opened four graves on July 25, 1878. They removed several skulls for study and the Putnam Museum, as the Academy is now called, retained the skulls in their collection until the state of Iowa enacted burial site protection and reburial laws. In 1986 the Putnam Museum transferred the skeletal remains in its collection to the Office of the State Archeologist of Iowa. The 23 skulls in the collection were given to the Dakota tribe at Morton, Minnesota for burial. In 2005 the Dakota held a memorial ceremony on the former site of Camp Kearney. Aftermath After General Robert E. Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865, the War Department ordered that the camp fire one hundred guns and turn out the military in full regalia. As the Gazette, a local paper, commented, ‚ÄúThere being no cannon here and but little military, (Major Miller) did the best he could.‚Äù The following week the camp held a special meeting and ceremony to mourn the death of President Lincoln. The camp then received and mustered out the remaining troops. In August 1865 a fire destroyed the headquarters building. The hospital was closed on October 5, 1865. The camp was decommissioned and the buildings were torn down after the Native Americans left Camp Kearney. The land was returned to Ann R. Allen, Thomas Russel Allen‚Äôs widow. In June 1900 the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) held an encampment on the site. A proposal was submitted to the Iowa General Assembly to turn the former camp into a state park. It had the support of Iowa‚Äôs Civil War veterans groups, the GAR, and local citizens, but it was not accepted by the legislature. The area became a residential area, named McClellan Heights, and the southwest portion became Lindsay Park. In 1928 a plaque was placed in the park by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The plaque reads: CAMP Mc CLELLAN HERE WAS LOCATED A MILITARY CAMP DURING THE CIVIL WAR, AT WHICH WERE TRAINED MORE THAN HALF OF THE RECRUITS FROM IOWA. IN 1862 SEVERAL HUNDRED SIOUX INDIANS WERE IMPRISONED HERE FOLLOWING THE MINNESOTA MASSACRE.

The Orange Order is an Ulster Protestant and unionist brotherhood. Five Orangemen were killed and seven wounded in the shooting. The \\"South Armagh Republican Action Force\\" claimed responsibility, saying it was retaliation for a string of attacks on Catholic civilians by Loyalists. It is believed members of the Provisional IRA carried out the attack, despite the organisation being on ceasefire. Background On 10 February 1975, the Provisional IRA and British government entered into a truce and restarted negotiations. The IRA agreed to halt attacks on the British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended their raids and searches.Extracts from The Longest War: Northern Ireland and the IRA by Kevin J.

London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.142 increased their attacks on Irish Catholics/nationalists.Taylor, Peter. Brits: The War Against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001. p.182 They hoped to force the IRA to retaliate and thus end the truce. Some IRA units concentrated on tackling the loyalists. The fall-off of regular operations had caused unruliness within the IRA and some members, with or without permission from higher up, engaged in tit-for- tat killings. On 22 August, loyalists killed three Catholic civilians in a gun and bomb attack on a pub in Armagh. Two days later, loyalists shot dead two Catholic civilians after stopping their car at a fake British Army checkpoint in the Tullyvallen area. Both of these attacks have been linked to the Glenanne gang. On 30 August, loyalists killed two more Catholic civilians in a gun and bomb attack on a pub in Belfast. Orange Hall attack On the night of 1 September, a group of Orangemen were holding a meeting in their isolated Orange hall in the rural area of Tullyvallen. At about 10pm, two masked gunmen burst into the hall armed with assault rifles and sprayed it with bullets while others stood outside and fired through the windows.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives. Mainstream Publishing, 1999. p.572 The Orangemen scrambled for cover. One of them was an off-duty Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer.

In response to the attack, the Orange Order called for the creation of a legal militia (or \\"Home Guard\\") to deal with republican paramilitaries. Some of the rifles used in the attack were later used in the Kingsmill massacre in January 1976, when ten Protestant workmen were killed. Like the Tullyvallen massacre, it was claimed by the \\"South Armagh Reaction Force\\" (a cover name for IRA operatives in some operations at the time) as retaliation for the killing of Catholics elsewhere. In November 1977, 22-year-old Cullyhanna man John Anthony McCooey was convicted of driving the gunmen to and from the scene and of IRA membership.
