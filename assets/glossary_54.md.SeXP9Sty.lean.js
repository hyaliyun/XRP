This prison was built in 1893 and continued to be used until the end of apartheid. Beginning During the late 1800s, when the railway lines reached Bloemfontein, there was a high influx into the town. The town was expanding and with it came an increase in criminal activity. At this time, crime increased by about 66%. Most prosecutions were in line with pass laws, theft, drunkenness, and disturbance of peace and the forgery of alcohol slips. At the time, Bloemfontein housed a prison on St George Street and due to the increased criminal activity, needed a new one. In 1829, this prison housed 70 criminals (black and white) with 8 cells, two of which were for whites and one for women. This increase even caused the District physician ‚Äì Dr J Kraise ‚Äì to request an increase in salary as more than half of the prison population required his services. In 1878, Dr Krause compiled a report to the Volksraad (The parliament of the former Free State Republic, which existed from 1857 to 1902, which ceased to exist after the British victory in the South African War); stressing the inhumane living conditions at the prison. He termed these conditions ‚Äúa screaming injustice‚Äù. The cells were overcrowded with no source of light and/or ventilation. It was also reported that there were a lot of rats and mice in those cells. This prison was also used as a makeshift hospital and this received a huge outcry from the community. De Tijd newspaper reported that the prison was ‚Äúalmost too bad for a negro to live in‚Äù. Establishment of Ramkraal Prison The construction of the new prison began in 1893 and the cost of the building amounted to ¬£16 000. Initially, prosecutions in Bloemfontein were performed on an open space; although they were eventually moved to a place away from the city centre. With the completion of Ramkraal prison, the gallows were then moved there and they were near the circular wall enclosure. The gallows were described as ‚Äú‚Ä¶immense, sturdy and square, erected with thick black beams and ironwork with 22 steps leading to a platform halfway to the top. Then there is the cloak of black material covering the body of the sentenced in which he or she was dressed prior to the hanging. Further up the framework was the cross-beam from which the rope hung‚Äù. The treatment of the prisoners was still dire and although the conditions had improved from the previous prison, they were still unfavourable living conditions. Corporal punishment was still freely applied ‚Äì at least to black prisoners because the Magistrate declared that he \\"did not like a white man to be flogged\\". The scourging area at the new prison was used regularly, where the black prisoners would be whipped, as punishment. All prisoners still had to wear foot shackles (often causing painful chafing) with which they had to sleep as well. Mixed working groups with black and white prisoners with a white or black supervisor were a common sight in the town. Authorities decided to keep prisoners in chains so that they would not escape as they went to work in town. The supervisors were asked to lead their groups around the outskirts of the town to their working areas rather than through the streets. This was so much so that there would be no mingling with the community which they feared would cause the prisoners to escape. Architecture The building was completed in 1895. The following are its architectural character: *Ring wall with two watchtowers and symmetrical design *Entrance foyer had a height of 8.5m but was well provided with sunlight due to large window openings *Interior height was 55m *Prison cells were 3.5m x 2m *Corridors were 3m *Building was made of sandstone and the wall thickness varied from 300mm to 500mm *Roof was constructed with wooden trusses and corrugates iron sheeting.

Definition Like 3-satisfiability, an instance of the problem consists of a collection of Boolean variables and a collection of clauses, each of which combines three variables or negations of variables. However, unlike 3-satisfiability, which requires each clause to have at least one true Boolean value, NAE3SAT requires that the three values in each clause are not all equal to each other (in other words, at least one is true, and at least one is false). Hardness The NP-completeness of NAE3SAT can be proven by a reduction from 3-satisfiability. The problem remains NP-complete when all clauses are monotone (meaning that variables are never negated), by Schaefer's dichotomy theorem. Monotone NAE3SAT can also be interpreted as an instance of the set splitting problem, or as a generalization of graph bipartiteness testing to 3-uniform hypergraphs: it asks whether the vertices of a hypergraph can be colored with two colors so that no hyperedge is monochromatic. More strongly, it is NP-hard to find colorings of 3-uniform hypergraphs with any constant number of colors, even when a 2-coloring exists. Easy cases Unlike 3SAT, some variants of NAE3SAT in which graphs representing the structure of variables and clauses are planar graphs can be solved in polynomial time. In particular this is true when there exists a planar graph with one vertex per variable, one vertex per clause, an edge for each variable-clause incidence, and a cycle of edges connecting all the variable vertices.

Early life Cecilia Calder√≥n was born in Guayaquil on 5 December 1949, the daughter of Abdon Calderon Mu√±oz and Rosita Prieto. Even in her youth, Calder√≥n leaned towards politics, actively volunteering for the presidential campaign of Andr√©s C√≥rdova, the Liberal candidate for the 1968 Ecuadorian general election. She attended and graduated from the Catholic University of Guayaquil as an economist. Leadership of the FRA During the Ecuadorian general election of 1978-79, Calder√≥n actively participated in the campaign of , her father and head and founder of the FRA. Shortly after the first round of the election, Calderon Mu√±oz was murdered on the orders of the military dictatorship on 29 November 1978, leaving Calder√≥n as leader of the party, making Calderon the first woman in Ecuador to assume leadership of a political party. Calder√≥n fought for justice for her father, which was granted when President Jaime Rold√≥s Aguilera declared former government minister Bol√≠var Jarr√≠n Cahue√±as guilty of the murder, marking the first time in Ecuador's history that a political crime had been sanctioned by a government of Ecuador. In the provincial elections for Guayas Province of 1980, Calder√≥n was elected the first female member of the Provincial Council and because of the high number of votes for her, she won the Vice President's seat in the Council. Calder√≥n was then in 1986 elected to the National Congress of Ecuador, becoming the only woman to sit on that congress.

Ridge-and-swale landscapes are most commonly formed by the gradual movement of a beach, for example as a result of gradually fluctuating water levels, or the shifting meanders of a river. In the river context, ridge-and-swale landscapes are commonly formed by scroll bars. They are also found along ocean coasts, for example on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Great Lakes ridge and swale Freshwater ridge-and-swale ecosystems are globally rare and found only in parts of the Great Lakes of North America. They were formed as a result of the gradual retreat of beaches due to falling water levels and post-glacial rebound. The swales and the adjoining lake or river commonly form a single hydrological unit, so that rising or falling lake levels will cause water levels in the swales to rise or fall as well. Most ridge-and-swale landscapes have been destroyed as a result of the massive industrial development found in many former ridge-and-swale areas, such as the Calumet Region of Northwest Indiana. However, some extensive dune-and-swale complexes persist in Michigan, such as at the Michigan Wilderness State Park. The remaining dune-and-swale complexes along the Great Lakes are often home to extremely rare plants and animals, such as the endangered Karner Blue butterfly. In the Calumet Region, the difficulty of moving equipment through dune-and-swale topography greatly slowed industrial development, but could not stop it after the turn of the 20th century. The few remnants are preserved as nature preserves, including the Gibson Woods county park in Hessville, Indiana, the Miller Woods section of the Indiana Dunes National Park, and additional preserves operated by The Nature Conservancy and Shirley Heinze Land Trust.

Examples of the situations featured in such videos can be seen above, such as injections, mutilation, childbirth and chemical burning. Elsagate is a neologism referring to the controversy surrounding videos on YouTube and YouTube Kids that are categorized as \\"child-friendly\\", but which contain themes that are inappropriate for children. Most videos under this classification are notable for presenting content such as graphic violence, sexual situations, fetishes, drugs, alcohol, injections, toilet humor and dangerous or upsetting situations and activities. These videos often feature popular characters from family-oriented media, sometimes via crossovers, used without legal permission. The term itself is composed of \\"Elsa\\" (a character from Disney animated film Frozen, who is frequently depicted in such videos) and \\"-gate\\" (a suffix for scandals). However, the Elsagate controversy has also included channels such as Toy Freaks that do not feature child/family- friendly characters, but real children and have raised concern about possible child abuse. Most videos in this category are either live action films or crude 2D animations, although a few channels have been using more elaborate techniques such as clay animation, or 3D animation.Ben Popper, Adults dressed as superheroes is YouTube‚Äôs new, strange, and massively popular genre , The Verge, 4 February 2017. Despite YouTube's age restriction policies, these videos are sometimes tagged in such a way to circumvent the inbuilt child safety algorithms, even making their way into YouTube Kids, and are thus difficult to moderate due to the large scale of the platform. In order to capture search results and attract attention from users, their titles and descriptions feature names of famous characters, as well as keywords like \\"education\\", \\"learn colors\\", \\"nursery rhymes\\", etc.Sapna Maheshwari, On YouTube Kids, Startling Videos Slip Past Filters , The New York Times, 4 November 2017.James Bridle, Something is wrong on the internet , Medium, 6 November 2017. They also include automatically placed ads, making them lucrative to their owners and YouTube. Despite the objectionable and often confusing nature of these videos, many attract millions of views. While criticism of the channels themselves has existed since at least 2014, public awareness of the phenomenon grew in 2017, as mainstream media started to report about child safety on YouTube. That year, after reports by several media outlets, YouTube adopted stricter guidelines regarding children's content. In late November, the company started to mass-delete channels and videos falling into the Elsagate category, as well as large amounts of other inappropriate videos or user's comments relating to children.Johanna Wright, 5 ways we‚Äôre toughening our approach to protect families on YouTube and YouTube Kids , Official YouTube Blog, 22 November 2017. History =Early history (2014‚Äì2017)= Elsagate channels have existed since at least 2014. In June 2016, The Guardian published an article about the channel Webs and Tiaras, which had been created in March of the same year. Apparently based in Canada, Webs and Tiaras had become in two months YouTube's third most-viewed channel with about 1.7 billion views. The channel showed people dressed as characters like Spider-Man, Elsa, and the Joker engaging in bizarre or nonsensical actions. The videos themselves had background music but no dialogue. Having no script, there was no language barrier on the videos which would normally hinder worldwide distribution. The article also reported that several nearly identical channels named Toy Monster, The Superheroes Life, and The Kids Club had appeared on YouTube.YouTube's latest hit: neon superheroes, giant ducks and plenty of lycra , The Guardian, 29 June 2016.

The channel's owner was later fined by Vietnamese authorities.Vietnam man fined for suggestive YouTube parody channel , Tuoi Tre News, 19 January 2017. The high number of views have led some to voice concerns that such channels are gaming the system by using bots or click farms to inflate viewing figures to higher proportions; however, there is no evidence for this. In February 2017, The Verge commented that \\"adults dressing up in costume and acting out weird, wordless skits has become a booming industry on the world's biggest video platform\\" and that while many videos were \\"puerile but benign\\", others featured more questionable content such as scatological humor and violent or sexual situations. The article noted that most videos were made with a very limited budget and \\"a few Halloween costumes\\", which made them easy to produce and contributed to their multiplication. It also attributed their success to the frequent use of \\"Freudian concerns\\", which young children may find fascinating, amusing, or frightening, such as \\"peeing, pooping, kissing, pregnancy, and the terrifying notion of going to the doctor and getting a shot\\". Also in February, The Awl published an article on Webs and Tiaras and similar channels, describing their content as \\"nonsensically nightmarish\\" with titles like \\"Frozen Elsa gets CHICKEN FEET!\\", \\"Frozen Elsa gets BRAIN BELLY!\\", \\"Frozen Elsa & Anna TEAR SPIDERMAN APART!\\", \\"EVIL SANTA KIDNAPS Frozen Elsa & Spiderman!\\", or \\"Frozen Elsa FLUSHES Spiderman in Toilet!\\". The website commented that the videos were \\"pretty twisted for children's content: some videos involve Elsa giving birth, and in some others, Spider-Man injects Elsa with a brightly colored liquid. You half expect the scenarios to be porn setups.\\" In most videos, the like and dislike options were disabled, making it impossible to know how many users were actually engaging with them. Many videos featured hundreds of comments in gibberish, some being written by similar channels in an apparent attempt to attract more clicks.Rachel Deal, The Ballad Of Elsa And Spiderman , TheAwl.com, 23 February 2017. In March, the BBC ran a piece titled \\"The disturbing YouTube videos that are tricking children\\". The article focused on a Peppa Pig imitation where the titular character's teeth are painfully pulled out by a dentist, and a video featuring said character burning down an occupied house. The article also mentioned the existence of \\"hundreds\\" of similar videos, ranging from unauthorized but otherwise harmless copies of authentic cartoons to frightening and gory content. CTV News also reported in March about YouTube's \\"fake toons problem\\", with adult-themed imitations of popular children's shows frequently appearing on YouTube Kids: \\"In some cases, the video will feature a kid-friendly thumbnail, while the video itself might be entirely different\\" and be very unsuitable for small children. The network commented that such videos were \\"often nightmares to behold, with lots of frightening scenes involving monsters and blood. Many of these videos venture into dark territory, with the characters often being chased, attacked, or injured in a bloody manner.\\"Fake toons: Kids falling prey to adult parodies of popular children's shows , CTV News, 28 March 2017.

During the summer of that year, it became a popular hashtag on Twitter as users called attention to the presence of such material on YouTube and YouTube Kids.'ElsaGate' hashtag calling attention to disturbing YouTube content , WGN9, 26 July 2017. On Reddit, an Elsagate subreddit (r/ElsaGate) was created on June 23 to discuss the phenomenon, soon attracting tens of thousands of users.Elsagate: The disturbing YouTube trend that might be terrifying your children , Newshub, 24 November 2017. =Discovery of Elsagate videos (2017)= November 2017 In November 2017, several newspapers published articles about the YouTube channel Toy Freaks, which had been created two years earlier by a single father named Greg Chism. Toy Freaks had a total of 8.53 million subscribers and was among the top 100 most viewed, before it was shut down that month. The channel often featured Chism's daughters and in most cases showed them scared or crying. These videos could also be found in local video platforms in China, where YouTube is blocked, including Tencent, Youku, and iQiyi. Tencent have set up a specific team to monitor its video platform and permanently shut down 121 accounts and blocked more than 4,000 search keywords by January 2011. The Ministry of Public Security of China suggested that netizens should report these videos once found. Several celebrities, including rapper B.o.B and comedians Joe Rogan and Philip DeFranco discussed Elsagate on social media during this time. On November 4, The New York Times published an article about the \\"startling\\" videos slipping past YouTube's filters and disturbing children, \\"either by mistake or because bad actors have found ways to fool the YouTube Kids algorithms\\". On November 6, author James Bridle published on Medium a piece titled Something is wrong on the internet, in which he commented about the \\"thousands and thousands of these videos\\": \\"Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatize, and abuse children, automatically and at scale\\". Bridle also observed that the confusing content of many videos seemed to result from the constant \\"overlaying and intermixing\\" of various popular tropes, characters, or keywords. As a result, even videos with actual humans started resembling automated content, while \\"obvious parodies and even the shadier knock-offs\\" interacted with \\"the legions of algorithmic content producers\\" until it became \\"completely impossible to know what is going on\\". On November 17, Internet commentator Philip DeFranco posted a video addressing \\"the insane YouTube Kids problem\\".Why We Need To Talk About The Insane YouTube Kids Problem , 17 November 2017. The New York Times found that one of the channels featuring counterfeit cartoons, Super Zeus TV, was linked to a website called SuperKidsShop.com, registered in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. A man working for SuperKidsShop.com confirmed that his partners were responsible for the videos, on which \\"a team of about 100 people\\" were producing.

On November 23, French-Canadian outlet Tablo√Ød released a video investigation about Toy Monster, a channel linked to Webs and Tiaras. They confronted the videos' creators ‚Äì based out of the south shore of Quebec City ‚Äì who refused to be interviewed.

Effect on children Several parents, teenagers, or peers posting on the /r/ElsaGate subreddit expressed fears that the videos were traumatizing to children. The New York Times quoted pediatrics professor Michael Rich, who stated that these videos were potentially harmful to children who could find them even more upsetting, as \\"characters they thought they knew and trusted\\" were shown behaving in an improper or violent manner. Response from YouTube In August 2017, YouTube announced its new guidelines on content and monetization. In an ongoing series of efforts to demonetize controversial and offensive videos, it was announced that creators would no longer be able to monetize videos that \\"made inappropriate use of family friendly characters\\". In November of the same year, it announced that it would implement \\"a new policy that age restricts this content in the YouTube main app when flagged\\". The controversy extended to channels that featured not necessarily children's characters but actual children, who sometimes performed inappropriate or dangerous activities under the guidance of adults. As part of a broader action, YouTube deleted the channel Toy Freaks, which featured a father (Greg Chism) and his two daughters in potentially abusive situations.Todd Spangler, YouTube Terminates Toy Freaks Channel Amid Broader Crackdown on Disturbing Kids‚Äô Content , Variety, 17 November 2017.Sarah Templeton, Disturbing 'ElsaGate', 'Toy Freaks' videos removed from YouTube after abuse allegations , Newshub, 22 November 2017.Charlie Warzel, YouTube Is Addressing Its Massive Child Exploitation Problem , BuzzFeed, 22 November 2017. Chism was subsequently investigated by child-protection officials in Illinois and Missouri for alleged child abuse. In December 2017, authorities announced that Chism would not face criminal charges. Before its removal, the channel had over 8.5 million subscribers. It was also revealed in the media that many videos featuring minors ‚Äì frequently uploaded by the children themselves and showing innocent content ‚Äì had attracted comments from pedophiles and other groups. Some of these videos were monetized. As a result of the controversy, several major advertisers froze spending on YouTube, forcing YouTube to ban children from their site, citing legal obligations.Todd Spangler, YouTube Faces Advertiser Boycott Over Videos With Kids That Attracted Sexual Predators , Variety, 25 November 2017.

Forbes contributor Dani Di Placido wrote that many problematic videos could still be seen on the platform, and that \\"the sheer volume of videos hastily deleted from the site prove that YouTube's algorithms were utterly ineffective at protecting young children\\". Motives The motives behind these videos are unknown, although The Verge pointed out that the contents may be fascinating to children. As many of the videos have millions of views and include advertisements, The New York Times suggested the videos are financially lucrative. Elsagate also became the subject of several conspiracy theories, including one that states that the videos are attempting to normalize pedophilia or sexual abuse against minors.

She is currently a professor of Native American studies at the University of Manitoba. She is also a published poet, writing brief, imagist poems about her ancestral land and culture. LaRocque's works have critically engaged topics such as Indigenous identities, contemporary Indigenous literature, postcolonial literary criticism, decolonization and resistance, and Indigenous representation in Canadian history, literature, and popular culture. The professor has published works in numerous fields, making her work relevant to a diverse array of scholars. For instance, LaRocque's work offers a nuanced conception of Indigenous literatures as resistance, and brings misrepresentation of Indigenous Peoples in Canada to light. Such contributions have had reverberations in Native Studies, sociology, education, and poetry alike. LaRocque is also known for her deconstruction of the \\"civilized/savage\\" dichotomy, which she problematizes in relation to her own M√©tis identity.  Early life  LaRocque was born in the remote community of Big Bay, Alberta, near the town of Lac La Biche. She came from a family of fur trappers, and was one of the first in her family to receive a formal education. Despite her parents' uneasiness toward their daughter's enthusiasm for education, the author-to-be \\"howled [her] way into school\\". Though English was not LaRocque's first language, this did not impede her from excelling in her early education. After she completed high school, LoRocque worked as a counsellor for juvenile criminal offenders. LaRocque also worked as a teacher at the Janvier 194 reserve until 1971, when she moved to the United States to attend Goshen College, Indiana.LAROCQUE, EMMA (b. 1949), Encyclopedia of the Great Plains. Retrieved 21 November 2017.  Education  In 1973, LaRocque graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Communications and English from Goshen College, and later attended the Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary, graduating with a Masters of Arts in peace studies in 1976.Dr. Emma LaRocque, Department of Native Studies, University of Manitoba. Retrieved 21 November 2017. Before entering academia herself, she briefly worked as a reporter and editor for Native People, a newspaper published by the Alberta Native Communications Society. LaRocque joined the University of Manitoba faculty in 1976, and received a second M.A. in 1980, in Canadian history.

Lepenski Vir consists of one large settlement with around 10 satellite villages. Numerous piscine sculptures and peculiar architecture have been found at the site. Genetics A February 2018 study published in Nature included an analysis of a large number of individuals from the Iron Gates Mesolithic dating from 9500 BC to 5000 BC. They were most closely related to Western European hunter-gatherers, but with some additional affinity toward Eastern European hunter-gatherers and Anatolian Neolithic farmers. Their most common maternal haplogroup was U5, typical of European hunter-gatherers, but they also carried haplogroups U4, K1, and a single case of H13. Their paternal haplogroups were I and R, which predominated in other European hunter- gatherers as well. Where a finer classification was possible, the R was specifically R1b1a-L754 (not belonging to subclade R1b1a1a-P297), and the I belonged to I2a-L460.

Monument at Godal Temple, showing dragon-tortoise hybrid. The dragon's head and wind chime is an elaborate type of gilt bronze Korean wind chime and Korean dragon sculpture of later Silla / early Goryeo art, probably serving as a roof end tile figure on a Korean Buddhist temple or Korean palace. There are two similar near-complete examples, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, and at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art in Seoul, which is designated National Treasure No. 781. Belonging to the 10th century AD, this work would originally have been attached to a corner rafter of a royal palace building or a Buddhist temple hall. The artifact, made of guilt bronze consists of two major parts: the lower wind chime and upper rafter finial with the shape of a dragon head. The dragon head contains various intricate designs and its eyes, closed mouth, horns, ears and elaborate scales convey the fierceness of the mythical creature. A hook in the upper part of the chime might have used to hang the chime in the rafter, as loops can be seen in the chin of the dragon head. The lower part of the wind chime contains decorative panels of a circular platform with lotus motifs in either side. A swastika symbol can be observed in the middle of the platform. This is considered as an ancient symbol related with Buddha. As the dragon is considered as a symbol of protection and fierceness in Asian tradition, it is speculated that this chime would have attached as a roof end tile figure to a royal palace or a Buddhist temple hall. Dragon finials are significant in Korean art. The dragon face resembles that at Godal Temple, which is dated to 975. Introduction  Korean peninsula has a long history of art.

From 7th to 17th century AD, metal crafting was developed and fine metal works can be observed. Also Korean porcelain and painting was developed with its distinctive style. This Rafter finial in the shape of a dragon's head and wind chime is one of the finest metal works of Goryeo period. In the Korean art and culture, dragon figure holds a significant place. Specially, dragon is considered as the protector of humans as well as warding off evil spirits. This figure, displaying the fierceness of a dragon, shows how advanced metal work Goryeo craftsmen had. The bell, which functioned as a punggyeong (), originally had a metal-plated clapped inside. Another similar example for the dragon's head and wind chime set can be seen at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul, and the dragon's head element is designated National Treasure No. 781.

His nephew was Agostino Giustiniani, bishop and intellectual of Genoa. He was the son of Niccol√≤ Giustiniani and Brancaleona Grimaldi Banca, both members of the Genoese nobility. Through his mother, he was a member of the Banca noble family. Giustianiani was a member of the Maona of Chios and Phocaea.  Collecting and patronage  Giustianiani was an avid collector of ancient marble sculpture and amassed a substantial library, reportedly of over 2000 works (although Basso suggests that this figure is probably inflated). Giustiniani was a patron of Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli and a number of Flemish artists. His friends and correspondents included Ambrogio Traversari, , Poggio Bracciolini and Niccol√≤ Niccoli.

It is usually present in crystal systems lacking inversion symmetry. The effect is named after Gene Dresselhaus, husband of Mildred Dresselhaus, who discovered this splitting in 1955. Spin‚Äìorbit interaction is a relativistic coupling between the electric field produced by an ion-core and the resulting dipole moment arising from the relative motion of the electron, and its intrinsic magnetic dipole proportional to the electron spin. In an atom, the coupling weakly splits an orbital energy state into two states: one state with the spin aligned to the orbital field and one anti-aligned. In a solid crystalline material, the motion of the conduction electrons in the lattice can be altered by a complementary effect due to the coupling between the potential of the lattice and the electron spin. If the crystalline material is not centro-symmetric, the asymmetry in the potential can favour one spin orientation over the opposite and split the energy bands into spin aligned and anti-aligned subbands. The Rashba spin‚Äìorbit coupling has a similar energy band splitting, but the asymmetry comes either from the bulk asymmetry of uniaxial crystals (e.g. of wurtzite typeE. I. Rashba and V. I. Sheka, Symmetry of Energy Bands in Crystals of Wurtzite Type II. Symmetry of Bands with Spin‚ÄìOrbit Interaction Included, Fiz. Tverd. Tela: Collected Papers, v. 2, 162, 1959. English translation: http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/17/5/050202/media/njp050202_suppdata.pdf) or the spatial inhomogeneity of an interface or surface. Dresselhaus and Rashba effects are often of similar strength in the band splitting of GaAs nanostructures.  Zincblende Hamiltonian  Materials with zincblende structure are non-centrosymmetric (i.e., they lack inversion symmetry). This bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) forces the perturbative Hamiltonian to contain only odd powers of the linear momentum. The bulk Dresselhaus Hamiltonian or BIA term is usually written in this form: :H_{rm D}propto p_x(p_y^2-p_z^2)sigma_x + p_y(p_z^2-p_x^2)sigma_y+p_z(p_x^2-p_y^2)sigma_z, where sigma_x, sigma_y and sigma_z are the Pauli matrices related to the spin mathbf{S} of the electrons as mathbf{S}=tfrac{1}{2}hbarsigma (here hbar is the reduced Planck constant), and p_x, p_y and p_z are the components of the momentum in the crystallographic directions [100], [010] and [001], respectively. When treating 2D nanostructures where the width direction z or [001] is finite, the Dresselhaus Hamiltonian can be separated into a linear and a cubic term. The linear Dresselhaus Hamiltonian H_{rm D}^{(1)} is usually written as :H_{rm D}^{(1)}=frac{beta}{hbar}(sigma_xp_x-sigma_yp_y), where beta is a coupling constant. The cubic Dresselhaus term H_{rm D}^{(3)} is written as :H_{rm D}^{(3)}=-frac{beta}{hbar^3}left(frac{d}{pi}right)^2 p_xp_y(p_ysigma_x-p_xsigma_y), where d is the width of the material.

In 1973, Gast responded to a newspaper job advertisement purportedly placed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. On 1 November 1973, she started work with the West German intelligence service (the Bundesnachrichtendienst/BND). Any background vetting undertaken by the BND had failed to pick up on the fact that, since 1968, Gast had been on the books of the East German HVA, the branch of the East German Ministry for State Security (Stasi) concerned with \\"foreign\\" intelligence. For whatever reason, it was not till 1990 (when she was \\"betrayed by a defector\\") that the West German Intelligence Service learned that she was \\"working for the other side\\". People who passed information from the west to the East German intelligence services were normally paid something. Gabriele Gast refused to accept any payment. With regard to the espionage, she did what she did, she said, for love. It is clear that after some time the love was matched and then replaced as the driving force for her espionage work by a deep political commitment. Regardless of her changing circumstances, she never accepted payment from her East German spy chiefs. After it was all over, and she had served her sentence, she was able to present herself perfectly convincingly as a spy \\"from conviction\\" (\\"aus √úberzeugung\\"). The prevailing assessment is that Heinz Felfe was East Germany's most effective spy. Not very far down the list, however, a recent (light-hearted) contribution from Sven Felix Kellerhoff ranked Gast as East Germany's fourth most damaging spy, one place ahead of G√ºnter Guillaume.  Life  = Early years = Gast was born in Remscheid during the Second World War and slightly more than three months before most of the town was destroyed in a fire storm caused by aerial bombing. Her father, who died while she was still very young, was a driving instructor. The youngest of three siblings, she grew up in a conservative catholic household in what became, in May 1949, the German Federal Republic (West Germany). Intelligent and diligent in her studies, she became politically engaged and evidently inherited her parents' political conservatism, joining the Association of Christian Democratic (i.e. conservative) Students (\\"Ring Christlich-Demokratischer Studenten\\" / RCDS) and the mainstream centre-right CDU (party). Like many people in western (and central) Europe, she was, according to her own later testimony, opposed to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. By that year she was working on a doctorate in political sciences, supervised by Klaus Mehnert at the university in Aachen. Her chosen topic focused on the role of women in the German Democratic Republic. Her dissertation would be submitted and her doctorate received in 1972. = Espionage = In the summer of 1968 Gabriele Gast visited Plauen, in the extreme south of what was then the German Democratic Republic, in order to undertake research for her doctorate on \\"the political role of women in the German Democratic Republic\\". The necessary permissions had been obtained by cousins in Plauen whom she had contacted in order to organise the trip. By this time she had already been a card carrying CDU member for three years, but it is nevertheless apparent that the local Ministry for State Security (MfS) office had also been undertaking preparations of their own in anticipation of her visit. Sources are inconsistent regarding the sequence of events as to how and when Gast met Karl-Heinz Schneider, the man she came to know as Karl-Heinz Schmidt. She appears to have met him first in Karl-Marx-Stadt (as Chemnitz was known at this time) where she had travelled to interview members of the Democratic Women's League of Germany (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD). It would have been remarkable for her to have travelled unescorted under these circumstances, and she was indeed accompanied to Karl-Marx-Stadt by an MfS \\"minder\\". who introduced her to \\"Karl-Heinz Schmidt\\", who was also visiting the city. It turned out that he knew her MfS escort and, on learning that the man was planning to drive to nearby Dresden, asked if he could cadge a lift. Gast, as she testified many years later, had been planning to stay in Karl- Marx-Stadt that afternoon, presumably to write up notes of her meetings with the DFD ladies, but on learning that there was an afternoon trip to Dresden in the offing, she asked if she might come along. That evening, to thank him for including her in his little expedition, she bought Karl-Heinz him a glass of wine at the \\"Kosmos Bar\\". \\"Karliszek\\", as he invited her to call him was a good looking fair haired man of considerable charm, eight years her senior. He said he was a car mechanic. She liked him, although after sharing a glass of wine it seems they went to their separate hotel rooms. Soon, she became aware that they had fallen in love. Sources are silent over the extent of \\"Karliszek's\\" skills as a car mechanic. He was \\"tactful, charming, a good dancer and jovial\\". He was a highly trained MfS agent: his task was to seduce women who might be persuaded to work for his employers. Karliszek's long- running relationship with Gabriele Gast would become ‚Äì at least until 1990 ‚Äì a textbook case of how these exercises could play out when everything went well, from the perspective of the spy-masters. Encouraged by her supervisor, Mehnert, Gast decided it would be useful to return to Karl-Marx-Stadt a few months later, in order to broaden the range of her contacts with politically active women. She conducted more interviews, visited libraries and undertook further additional research in the region. She also met up again with \\"Karliszek\\". Realising that they needed to spend more time together, he nevertheless suggested that they should in future meet up in East Berlin, which she could visit on the train from the west using a simple \\"day visa\\". That idea tied in remarkably well with Gast's own study plans, which included a series of visits to archive repositories in West Berlin. However, she could not undertake unlimited ad hoc visits across to East Berlin simply on the pretext of undertaking research or visiting relatives. Schmidt's reaction was both sympathetic and practical: he had a friend who might be able to help. \\"Karl-Heinz Schmidt's\\" friend was introduced to her as \\"Gotthard Schiefer\\". He was actually Gotthard Schramm, a department head with the Ministry for State Security in the Karl-Marx-Stadt region. The names by which they identified themselves to Gabriele Gast were false. In other respects, at a meeting held between the three of them at the \\"Hotel Unter den Linden\\" in East Berlin, the two men were shockingly honest. \\"Karl-Heinz Schmidt\\" was not a car mechanic with abundant free time: they told her they both worked for the East German security services (Stasi), and that their bosses believed that Gabriele Gast had been sent by the West German intelligence services in order to report back on her friend, \\"Karl-Heinz Schmidt\\". She was badly shaken by the series of unexpected disclosures, but she knew she loved \\"Schmidt\\". While she was taking it all in, \\"Schiefer\\" added that of course the Stasi suspicions might be tempered if she were able to display an \\"open-minded willingness to assist them\\" (\\"eine aufgeschlossene Bereitschaft zur Mithilfe gegen√ºber dem MfS\\"). It did not seem so very terrible: \\"help us out, and you can go on seeing each other\\". What was involved seemed to be not treachery, but just a little bit of cooperation. She had no critical information to share. She was just a student. \\"Schiefer\\" just wanted a few names of students who might be helpful, or snippets of casual gossip on the professors back at the university in Aachen. And did she know anyone serving in the West German army ...? After agreeing to help, Gast very soon found herself sent on an intensive spycraft course, including hands-on training with the latest in covert communications equipment. She was given a Stasi code name, \\"Gisela\\", which came with a false passport and a new handbag, incorporating a well concealed secret compartment. Back home in Aachen, every Tuesday evening at the same time she tuned into a shortwave radio station from East Germany and carefully wrote down a long line of numbers, read out in a monotone, without further elaboration, by a \\"radio presenter\\". When she decrypted the messages from Schmidt she found some were instructions while others were simply encouraging love messages. An arrangement was set in place whereby she should visit East Berlin every three months. A more specific early assignment involved contacting a fellow-student and getting him to meet up with a Stasi agent masquerading as a financial consultant. There is speculation that this seemingly inconsequential challenge was an early \\"test\\" (which evidently she passed). In 1970, Gast and \\"Schmidt\\" became engaged. They celebrated in a Stasi hostelry. None of their parents knew. The only friend who participated in the celebration was \\"Gotthard Schiefer\\" (Gotthard Schramm). There was also a taped message of goodwill from the men's head of department in Karl-Marx-Stadt, Colonel Egon Lorenz. After her unmasking in 1990, Gast encountered evident incredulity from an investigating judge, that she and her fianc√© had never married. Might she not have obtained work in East Germany, married and had children with her man? From her emotionally charged reaction in court it became clear that Gast would have loved to have done just that. There would certainly have been no difficulty in obtaining work in East Germany. Yet, somehow, something had always got in the way of the lovers becoming husband and wife. It could and was argued that Gast's own actions contributed to the indefinite deferral of that marriage. After earning her doctorate, which marked the end of her time as a student, it was she who took a research job in Munich with the Forschungsinstitut f√ºr Sicherheit und internationale Zusammenarbeit e.V. (\\"Research Institute for Security and International Collaboration\\"), a right- wing political pressure group. It was a reasonable career move for an intellectual CDU member with a newly earned doctorate in political sciences, but it was not an obvious route to a life as an East German housewife. At the Research Institute she solemnly photographed anything that could possibly be of interest to her HVA (ie Stasi) handlers, who organised the necessary \\"courier\\" arrangements. By the end of 1973 she had allowed herself to be headhunted for work in the West German intelligence service (\\"Federal Intelligence Service\\" / \\"Bundesnachrichtendienst\\" / BND), located at Pullach (still in the Munich area). Upon joining the BND she was given an additional cover name to remember: for the BND she was Dr. Gabriele Leinfelder. Within a year she had been assigned to the intelligence analysis section that dealt with the Soviet Union. Not a flamboyant character, but clearly extremely intelligent, she achieved steady promotion, surveying and analysing all the information that arrived in the department concerning Eastern Europe on behalf of her employers in both western and eastern intelligence. As the decade wore on the relationship with \\"Karl-Heinz Schmidt\\" became a little less intense, but several sources insist that they remained close as friends and colleagues. Regular meetings continued, combining the personal and professional needs and requirements of the lovers. There were weekend breaks together in Austria or northern Italy, away from the surveillance of West German intelligence and beyond the comfortable surveillance range of Gast's HVA controllers in East Berlin. They could dine in intimate restaurants and attend the opera in Vienna just like any other couple. Meanwhile a dedicated communications channel was set up. Every few weeks Gast coincided casually with her contact, usually in a public restroom/toilet, and they swapped identically hollowed deodorant spray canisters. The one destined for the east was filled with reels of microfilmed documents from the desks of the West German intelligence operatives. The contact then took a train journey towards Berlin, but before she left the train she would conceal the canister behind a wall panel in a train toilet, using a discrete chalk mark to indicate the wall panel behind which the Stasi employee among staff responsible for cleaning the train toilets should expect to retrieve the canister. Over the years tactics for transferring microfilmed documents were varied in order to reduce the risk of detection. The ultimate head of East Germany's spy network in West Germany was the remarkable Markus Wolf. Novelist John le Carr√© denied for more than forty years that the fictional East German spy chief, Karla, was modeled on Wolf. Wolf became sufficiently intrigued by the quality and quantity of intelligence provided by \\"IM Gisela\\" to arrange a meeting. In 1975 Gast and \\"Schmidt\\" enjoyed one of their brief holiday breaks at Rabac, a resort on the Adriatic coast of what was then Jugoslavia, where they were joined at their rented seaside bungalow by the improbably slim and elegant spy chief. By her own account, Gast was impressed not merely by Wolf's charms, but also by his seeming openness, and willingness to accept that \\"the Communist countries had a long way to go before they could profit from socialism's inherent advantages\\". A form of friendship developed between Wolf and Gast. In the end they had seven lengthy meetings over the years, each time carefully arranged with a combination of false and diplomatic passports, in comfortable out-of-the-way holiday spots where they could prepare their own meals ‚Äì filled Russian-style pelmeni dumplings were said to be a favourite ‚Äì and engage in detailed and very open discussions on politics, a topic on which, it seems, they were both fascinated and extremely well informed. Further promotion within the BND followed the first meeting with Wolf. In her personal life, however, changes were afoot. She later told a court that around 1980 she became convinced that she would never marry and never have children of her own. She also decided to take into her own home her sister's five year old adopted child, in order to spare him from having to grow up in an orphanage. The challenge of bringing up the boy was increased because he suffered from what is now known as Cerebral palsy (... nimmt sie \\"einen damals f√ºnf Jahre alten, spastisch gel√§hmten Jungen an\\"). The adoption represented an acknowledgement that there would never be a marriage with \\"Schmidt\\", and because she was sure she would never be able to leave the child behind it meant that the implicit option of escaping to the German Democratic Republic, should her espionage ever be uncovered in the west, was effectively closed off to her. She was, however, earning well, and was able to buy a small house near Munich in which she could look after her elder sister's child. In January 1980, while on holiday with \\"Schmidt\\" in Innsbruck, Gast told her lover about her plans to take on care of her sister's child and her intention, accordingly, to step back from her work for the HVA. However, the message came through from the top that pulling back from providing information from her desk at the BND would also mean pulling back from the regular meetings with \\"Karliszek\\". That, evidently, was something that she was still not prepared to countenance and she agreed to continue passing information. The more senior she became in the West German intelligence services the more valuable the information that she was able to provide became. Between 1980 and 1989 she made several further attempts to reduce or eliminate her spying activities for the east, but she was always persuaded to persist with her stressful double life. There are suggestions that one of the objectives of the discrete but friendly face to face meetings with her friend Markus Wolf was to cajole and charm her into continuing her contributions. There is also evidence that her political convictions had been shifting. In 1980 she applied to join the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), the ruling party in the highly centralised East German one-party dictatorship. There is little indication that she had become a convinced Marxist, but she was committed to the belief, encouraged by her ultimate spy chief, Markus Wolf, that by acting as an information channel between the intelligence services of west and east Germany, she could see herself as a \\"scout for peace\\" (\\"Kundschafterin des Friedens \\"). He encouraged her to understand the extent to which her activities supported east-west detente. Applications for party membership from middle class professionals living in West Germany were not frequently submitted to the SED which goes some way to explaining why the party took six years to process her membership application. During the six year wait she enjoyed the status of a \\"candidate for party membership\\". By the later 1980s \\"Dr. Gabriele Leinfelder\\" had become extremely senior within her department at the BND. She had responsibility for reports sent to the Chancellor's office, the Foreign Ministry and the Defence Ministry. By 1986, as deputy head of the Soviet section, it was she who prepared the agency report on the possible participation of German firms in the construction of a major chemicals plant in Libya. Overall, Gast was able to pass copies of 49 detailed western intelligence reports to Wolf, covering topics that ranged from West Germany's internal economic challenges to analyses of Soviet politics and the impact of the Soviet space programme. Something else on which she Gast was able to share the analysis of the western intelligence services with her eastern employers was the summit meeting between Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev. In East Berlin her HVA handlers trusted her completely to identify which documents should be copied: there was no attempt or need to guide her selections. = Exposure and arrest = Karl-Christoph Gro√ümann was a colonel in the East German HVA. He was retired from the service in 1987 because his immoral life-style and propensity to gossip made him a security risk. In autumn 1989 Gro√ümann had a meeting at the Grand Hotel in East Berlin with a former US presidential press secretary, John O. Koehler, whom he had known decades before when the two men were children, at school together in Dresden. It is believed that over several months, starting in January 1990 (or earlier), Gro√ümann caused consternation in the West German intelligence service by disclosing the extent to which it had been penetrated by HVA moles. Most sources are vague on the details of which spies he identified to precisely whom and when, though there are suggestions that Gabriele Gast would have known the details and timings of his disclosures more precisely than most people because of the extent to which relevant reports crossed her desk. One source states that Gro√ümann disclosed \\"Agent Gisela's\\" identity and espionage role in September in 1990. He later denied accusations that he had been paid for the information. Following months of growing civil unrest, street protesters broke through the Berlin Wall in November 1989. There was no sign of Soviet tanks coming onto the streets, as they had in 1953, in order forcibly to crush the emerging popular pressure for social, economic and democratic reforms. Four months of seemingly unstoppable changes ensued, culminating, in March 1990, in East Germany's first (and only) free parliamentary election. The Ministry for State Security which had enforced the East German dictatorship, no longer universally feared, faded away. As an agent of the HVA, the Ministry's \\"foreign\\" espionage wing, it would have been clear to Gast that, regardless of Comrade Gro√ümann's loose tongue, there were changes underway that would impact her regular meetings with \\"Karliszek\\". In September 1990 she got into her car and drove south for a final meeting with him in Austria, which was not then part of the European Union and there were accordingly passport and customs formalities to be negotiated at the frontier. She was arrested as she reached the border crossing. It was also at the start of October 1990 that reunification came into effect. The next year she faced trial and was sentenced by the \\"third Strafsenat\\" of the Bavarian High Court to six years and nine months in jail, along with forfeiture of certain statutory civil rights. She served most of her sentence between 1990 and 1994 in Munich's Stadelheim Prison and Aichach penitentiary. The monotony of prison life was interrupted by the requirement to appear at the trials of other former East German agent. As one report of the trial of Markus Wolf noted, she had been \\"let out [of the prison in Munich] so as to appear here\\". Wolf's well-publicised trial finally opened on 4 May 1993, and was the venue to which a succession of his reluctantly high- profile \\"top moles\\" were invited. As they entered court to testify, each shook Wolf's hand or nodded in greeting as they passed him apart from Gabriele Gast. She avoided even looking at him. \\"The pain was still too great.\\" After her interrogators had told her that Karl-Heinz Schmidt was actually Karl-Heinz Schneider, she had written Wolf a long letter, imploring that he tell her that there had been more to the affair with \\"Karliszek\\" than seventeen years as the victim of a professional Stasi seducer, mandated to do what was necessary to make sure she carried on providing her valuable intelligence information. Wolf never replied. Gast was one of the first of the former East German spies to be sentenced after 1990, and the sentence she received was one of the harshest. Partly that might have reflected a perception that she was particularly dangerous, on account of her technical competence, political insight, and formidable analytical skills. However, by 1994 the idea was gaining traction that the East German spies had simply worked for their country in precisely the same way that West German spies might have been expected to work for theirs. That case was forcefully (and successfully) argued at the trial of Wolf himself. Gast's own sentence, by 1994, had included fifteen months in \\"intensified solitary confinement\\" (in \\"versch√§rfter Einzelhaft\\"). That year she benefitted from \\"early release\\", albeit still \\"on probation\\". The probationary term originally set expired in 1998 and there was no move extend it. She was at liberty. = After prison = On her release she set about working on her remarkable personal story. She made contact with the representatives of East German state power who had influenced her life, including Markus Wolf, \\"Karlicek\\" Schneider (the old HVA spy chief who had \\"recruited\\" her) and Gro√ümann, whose betrayal had uncovered and ended her career as a double agent. She combined the resulting discussions and her own experiences into a volume entitled \\"Kundschafterin des Friedens\\" (\\"Scouts for Peace\\"), which was published in 1999. The title came from a phrase that Wolf had liked to use, when he referred to his network of overseas HVA informers. The book having been published, Gast moved on relatively quickly to the next chapter in her life, taking a job with an engineering firm. The changes which led to reunification did nothing to reclaim Gast for the political centre- right. After her experiences of prison she has remained a communist, albeit a thoughtful one. She serves as deputy chair of the \\"Kundschafter des Friedens fordern Recht\\" initiative group. The group, founded in 1995, comprises people who served the German Democratic Republic intelligence services before 1989, and who reject the idea that they have any reason to be apologetic for their contributions: * \\"The task of the East German spies was the protection of our country and its allies. Our task was not to win a war but to help prevent any such war. ... After the defeat of Socialism in Europe we continue to strive for peace ... [Our theme] is war and peace and the role of the secret services. ... After the Cold War ended the \\"peace dividend\\" failed to materialise. More wars were waged and the idiocies of the arms race continued while the secret services apply surveillance methods which technically they continue to perfect. Hubristic capitalism turns out to be not merely the scourge of the third world, but is dividing rich from poor ever more starkly even in the societies of the rich countries. It may well be that this capitalism has itself already passed its peak.\\" * \\"Die Kundschafter der DDR hatten die Aufgabe, das Land und ihre Verb√ºndeten zu sch√ºtzen.

He was honoured with a state funeral. His mortal remains are buried in his home town of Malavalli, Mandya District, Karnataka. The bye- elections resulting from Chandrashekara Murthy's death was won by H. D. Deve Gowda of the Janata Dal (Secular), with D. K. Shivakumar of the Indian National Congress losing. Shivakumar was first encouraged in politics by Chandrashekara Murthy. It has been suggested that the by-election could have easily been won by Umadevi Murthy, who was surprisingly denied the party ticket to contest since it was generally the convention of the party to consider a near relative of deceased incumbents where possible. S. M. Krishna was blamed for this, as he was Chandrashekara Murthy's b√™te noire, both being powerful Vokkaliga leaders from the same region and party. It has also been suggested that S. M. Krishna had a tacit understanding with H. D. Deve Gowda. Notably, H. D. Deve Gowda had gone on record that he would not have contested if Umadevi Murthy was fielded.

Political life Lord Commey was the National Youth Organizer of the New Patriotic Party from 1999 to 2003. Lord Commey was appointed the Operations Director for the Nana Akufo-Addo campaign prior to the 2012 Ghanaian general election. It was after his appointment that members of the opposition National Democratic Congress accused him of engaging in acts that cause confusion at political rallies through the use of thugs.

Esseku had claimed that the 1966 Coup d'√©tat that ousted the Kwame Nkrumah administration had restored multiparty democracy to Ghana.

His appointment was hailed by many New Patriotic Party members who believed that due to his constant engagement with the grassroots supporters, he would be a conduit between them and the president. Some also believed that he was being rewarded for all the work he did to ensure that the party won the 2016 Ghanaian general election. He has been forced to dunk several rumours that he had been sacked in June 2017 for being strong willed and unwilling to accept opposing views to his.

This 15th-century mosque with its obvious Hindu architecture typical of Java is one of the oldest mosque in Indonesia. History The Mosque of Panjunan was first established in 1480 by Syarif Abdurrahman, also known as the Pangeran Panjunan (\\"The Prince of Panjunan\\"). Syarif Abdurrahman was an Arab who led a group of immigrants from Baghdad. Later, Syarif Abdurrahman became the student of Sunan Gunung Jati, one of the Wali Songo, or nine saints of Islam revered in Indonesia. The Mosque of Panjunan is instrumental in the Islamization of Cirebon. In the beginning, the Red Mosque of Panjunan was named al-Athya Musalla. Because of its surrounding red brick perimeter wall, the mosque was also known as the Red Mosque or Masjid Abang. In the beginning, the mosque was a small-sized Musalla with an area of . The mosque was established in the neighborhood of Panjunan which at the time of its construction was a junction for travelers near the town of Cirebon. The village of Panjunan where the mosque is located is known for its earthenware pottery. Architecture The older musalla building had a total area of . After it was expanded into a mosque, the mosque has the size of . The architecture of the Mosque of Panjunan is a combination of Hindu, Chinese, and Islamic culture. The perimeter of the mosque looks more like an Indonesian Hindu temple found in Bali. The perimeter is constructed out of red bricks, with a split gate candi bentar marking the main entrance into the mosque. The candi bentar is a relic which originate from the 13th-14th century Hindu period of Singhasari and Majapahit. The mosque is relatively small in both size and proportion. The door is short, forcing people to bow while entering the building. The building is topped with a pyramidal roof known as the tajug. In Javanese architecture, the tajug roof type is only used for sacred buildings e.g. Hindu temples or mosques. The layout of the mosque is rectangular, with 12 posts supporting the tajug roof. The wall which encloses the main room of the mosque do not have any structural function; the entire roof was supported by the posts, typical of Javanese architecture. The mihrab of the mosque is a few elements of the building which indicates that the building is a mosque, as well as a couple of Arabic writings on the wall. Chinese plate ceramics are attached to the perimeter wall. It is said that the Chinese plate ceramics were wedding gifts when Sunan Gunung Jati married to Ong Tien Nio. The mihrab of the mosque is decorated with ceramics decoration. The mihrab is shaped like the paduraksa, another influence from earlier Hindu period. Reliefs showing a candi bentar and paduraksa have been discovered in 13th-century Candi Jago in East Java. In the Javanese Hindu architecture, the paduraksa marks the sacred-most area of a temple.

In the north the line will be connected to the Chinese rail system in Mohan, through the Yuxi‚ÄìMohan railway. In the south it meets the existing metre-gauge railway in Thanaleng, linking it via Nhong Khai in Thailand to Bangkok. A high-speed, standard gauge extension to Bangkok is also under construction. When finished, the Vientiane‚ÄìBoten railway will form an important part of the Kunming‚ÄìSingapore railway. China aims to build a 5,500-km trans-Asia railway, which begins in Yunnan's provincial capital Kunming and travels through Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, before ending in Singapore, according to Ding He, a deputy project manager for the China‚ÄìLaos railway project. Background Laos is the only landlocked country in Southeast Asia, which hinders trade of goods. During the French rule, the French failed to materialize a possible plan to build railway in Laos. A railway link through Laos would greatly reduce cargo transit times and transportation costs between Laos and China. The railway would also be a link in the Kunming‚ÄìSingapore railway network, as well as a program within the One Belt One Road Initiative. History The first talks about the railway linking Laos and China were in 2001, Laotian and Chinese politicians both confirmed the plans in 2009. After the corruption scandal of China's minister of railways Liu Zhijun, the start of construction was delayed until early 2016. Construction began at Luang Prabang on December 25, 2016. At the end of 2017, the construction phase was 20% completed, and in September 2019 progress was reported as 80% completed. Unexploded bombs that have been dropped during the Vietnam War will also be removed along the route. , Chinese state media reported that the US$6 billion project was 90% done. Work crews started laying track in Laos in March 2020, five years after breaking ground. With all of the many dozen tunnels and bridges completed, service is set to start in December 2021.http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-09/29/c_139406173.htm Financing The cost of the project is estimated at 6 billion US dollars. Lao government borrows 60% (3.6 billion US$) from the Export-Import Bank of China and the remaining 40% (2.4 billion US$) is funded by a joint venture company between the two countries. China holds 70% of the stake of the company. Of the rest of the stake, Lao government disburses 250 million US$ from its national budget and borrows 480 million US$ further from the Export-Import Bank of China. Infrastructure Viaduct under construction near Vientiane. Forty-seven percent of the railway will be in 75 tunnels and 15% will pass over viaducts spread over 167 bridges. There are 32 planned stations along the route. The final station would be Thanaleng station, not Vientiane Station. Xay Village in Xaythany District is to be the site of Vientiane Station, the largest station on the railway. The station will consist of four platforms with seven track lines and two additional platforms with three lines reserved. It is expected to connect with other railway lines planned for Laos. The station will accommodate up to 2,500 passengers with a total area of 14,543 square meters. The railway is to be built to China's GB Grade 1 standard (suitable for 160 km/h passenger and 120 km/h freight trains). A new bridge will be constructed by 2023 from Thanaleng to Nong khai to connect the high speed rail network into Thailand.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. History What is now Marine City was laid out in 1820 by Captain Samuel Ward, a shipbuilder from Vermont. During the next 25 years, over 30 shipyards were established in the area. These, and the discovery of salt deposits in 1882, led to a substantial growth in Marine City. The influx of residents in the 1870s and 1880s led to concerns over public health, and Marine City's first public water works system was constructed in 1885. However, by the late 1920s, the 1885 facility was clearly no longer adequate at supplying clean water to the community. However, three special elections to raise money for a new facility all were defeated. A sharp increase in water-borne disease, including typhoid fever, in the area led the Michigan State Health Department to mandate a new treatment facility be constructed. In 1935, the city applied to the Public Works Administration for a $45,000 grant to cover 45% of the cost of the new facility. The grant was approved, and voters approved the raising of the remaining funds soon thereafter. The city hired Pate & Hirn Engineers of Detroit to prepare plans for the new facility, and the Bass Engineering & Construction Company to build the plant. Construction began in December 1935, and was completed in August 1936. An addition was constructed in 1968, and substantial rehabilitation was done in 2005. Description The Marine City Water Works is located at the edge of downtown Marine City, on the bank of the St. Clair River. It consists of two structures: a main building and a nearby sedimentation basin with wash water tank tower. An underground clear water reservoir is located below grade. The main building faces west toward Water Street, and the buildings are surrounded on all sides by grass lawn. The main building is a small one-story, rectangular Art Deco building with walls of load-bearing brick on a concrete block foundation. It measures roughly 53 feet by 50 feet. It has a flat roof and low parapet walls with stone coping. Two corners of the building contain filtration tanks, which project beyond the walls; the top of the projection end beneath the windowsill line. The front has an asymmetrical facade, four bays wide, with a projecting off-center entry bay. A small stairway leads to a landing in front of the entryway, which is through a modern steel door. Beside the door are four commemorative plaques and an original light fixture. There are two secondary entrances, one on the side, and one on the rear. The original windows are single-hung wood sash units with four horizontal lights. Many of these have been replaced in 2005 with modern one-over-one light, triple-track vinyl sash units. The interior contains a lobby, small office, laboratory space, and a filter room. The sedimentation basin is a freestanding rectangular structure, located approximately five feet behind the main building. It is constructed of brick, with the original footprint measuring 60 feet by 37 feet. A 20-foot wide addition was constructed in 1968.

It was formed in September 1943 and spent the next several months training in the Moscow Military District. In the spring of 1944 it provided air defense to facilities in the rear of the front, and from the summer fought in the fighting for the Narew bridgehead. In early 1945 the division fought in the East Prussian Offensive and the East Pomeranian Offensive before providing air defense for the Oder crossing in April. For its actions, the 65th was awarded the honorific Pomerania, the Order of Kutuzov, and the Order of Alexander Nevsky. It was disbanded after the end of the war by the end of the 1950s.  World War II  37 mm AA gun of the type used by the division during World War II The 65th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK) began forming in late September 1943 at the Moscow Anti-Aircraft Artillery Training Camp in the military town of Aminiyevo. Lieutenant Colonel (promoted to Colonel on 17 November) Alexander Sakin was assigned as commander on 28 September; he led the division for the rest of the war. It included the 1980th, 1984th, 1988th, and the 1992nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments, formed as part of the division, and was part of the Moscow Military District. The 65th finished forming on 30 October. It remained there, conducting training, for the next several months. In February 1944, the division was transferred to the RVGK. It was directly subordinated to the 2nd Belorussian Front in March, but transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front in April. During April and May 1944, the division provided air defense for the railroad stations at Sarny and Manevychi, as well as facilities of the 1st Belorussian Front. In difficult conditions the 65th claimed to have downed 22 enemy aircraft conducting night raids. It then rejoined the 2nd Belorussian Front, with which it served for the rest of the war. The division fought in the fighting to capture and expanded the Narew bridgehead from the summer onwards. From September it was part of the 48th Army. Between 14 January and 10 February 1945, it served with the 48th Army in the East Prussian Offensive, with elements supporting the 8th Mechanized Corps' breakthrough of German lines. The 65th claimed 25 enemy aircraft downed during the offensive, as well as three ammunition and fuel depots, 20 halftracks and automobiles, eleven pillboxes, 45 wagons destroyed, and up to 400 enemy soldiers killed when it used its guns for artillery bombardments and counterattacks. Additionally, the division was credited with suppressing the fire of eight artillery and mortar batteries and capturing up to 30 settlements without the support of infantry units. During the offensive, it advanced into the cities of M≈Çawa and Osterode. The division was transferred to the 19th Army in February. In the subsequent East Pomeranian Offensive, during the elimination of German troops around Danzig, the 65th claimed ten German aircraft downed, more than 1,500 German soldiers killed, and up to 50 vehicles with cargo destroyed. For its \\"successful completion of command tasks\\" at Danzig, the 65th received the Order of Kutuzov, 2nd class, on 17 May. From April, initially as part of the 19th Army, and then directly subordinated to the front, the division provided air defense for the crossing of the Oder during the Battle of Berlin. For \\"successful completion of command tasks\\", the division received the honorific Pomerania and was awarded the Order of Alexander Nevsky.  Postwar  Following the end of the war, the division became part of the Northern Group of Forces. Sakin transferred to command another anti-aircraft artillery division in December 1946, and was replaced by Colonel Nikolay Kaminsky in January 1947, still part of the Northern Group of Forces.

It is locally known as Oberburg (upper castle) in relation to the near and slightly lower Br√∂mserburg. It has been part of the Rhine Gorge World Heritage Site from 2002.  History  The castle was probably built at the end of the 12th century as the family seat for the knight, Lord Fuchs of R√ºdesheim, as a square building surrounding a very high, double stepped bergfried, protected by a rampart and moat. In late medieval times, additional living quarters were added. In 1407, the castle was left to the Br√∂mser von R√ºdesheim noble family. From 1474 to 1830, it belonged to the noble family. After the counts of Sch√∂nborn-Wiesntheid became owners in 1830, they tore down in 1836 all the buildings apart from the bergfried, which they built even higher, adding Gothic Revival merlons. The next owner, wine merchant Baptist Sturm, transformed the moat to a vaulted wine cellar. His widow erected a Gothic Revival villa, designed by Philipp Hoffmann, and completed in 1872. The castle has belonged to a winery, Weinkellerei Carl Jung, from 1938. The musical family has arranged chamber music concerts in their residence. Carl's son, Hans Otto Jung, a founding member of the jazz group in the 1940s, played there with notable musicians on two Steinway pianos. His son, Edu Jung, also active as a jazz musician, opened the venue also for concerts of the Volkshochschule (VHS, folk high school).

A supporter of the Portuguese in their war against Oman, she sent supplies to the Europeans at the Siege of Fort Jesus. She was captured during the subsequent Omani occupation of Zanzibar and exiled to Oman. Allowed to return in 1709 she ruled the island as a client state of Oman for the rest of her life.  Life  Fatuma binti Yusuf al-Alawi (also called Fatima) was born in about 1650. She was of Sayyid descent and her ancestors were from Hadhramaut, Yemen but she claimed Persian ancestry as well. The daughter of King Yusuf of Zanzibar her father's territory of Unguja was split into two, a southern kingdom ruled by her brother Bakari bin Yusuf from Kizimkazi and a northern kingdom ruled by Fatuma from the site of modern- day Zanzibar City. Fatuma married her cousin Abdullah, King of the Utondwe, a Swahili kingdom on the African coast opposite Zanzibar. They had a son, Hasan. Queen Fatuma ruled in a period of transition in East Africa from the colonial Portuguese to the rising power of Oman. Fatuma remained loyal to the Portuguese, attempting to resupply Fort Jesus, in Mombasa (modern Kenya) before its fall to the Omanis in the 1696-98 siege. The three dhows of food she sent were captured and burnt by Omani forces. Another account states that she sent ships to fight the Omani vessels. Fatuma was also said to have travelled to Portuguese Goa to seek reinforcements for the beleaguered garrison. Zanzibar was subsequently raided by the Omanis who destroyed the Portuguese settlement there and constructed the Old Fort of Zanzibar on the site of the Portuguese chapel and the house of a merchant. Fatuma and Hasan were taken prisoner and sent into exile in Oman. They were allowed to return in 1709 and Fatuma ruled Zanzibar as a client state of Oman from her palace, on the site of the House of Wonders (the palace of the later Sultanate of Zanzibar). The Omanis kept one of the three cannons in the Old Fort trained on Fatuma's palace to enforce her compliance and prevent her from communicating with the Portuguese in Mozambique. Fatuma died in 1715 and was buried in a family plot to the immediate south of the fort. Fatuma was succeeded by Hasan. Her grandson, Hasan's son, was the penultimate independent ruler of Zanzibar before the establishment of the Omani Sultanate.

It was unveiled on 21 November 2017. Deliveries of the new Vantage began in June 2018. Specifications and performance Rear view The M177 twin-turbocharged V8 engine The Vantage uses the powertrain and infotainment technology from Mercedes-Benz, like the DB11. The Vantage uses Mercedes-AMG's M177 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine that has a power output of and of torque as is equipped with the Mercedes COMAND system. The Vantage is capable of accelerating from in 3.6 seconds, and attaining a top speed of . The Vantage uses a rear-mounted 8-speed automatic gearbox manufactured by ZF Friedrichshafen, and will be the only vehicle that pairs the Mercedes-AMG V8 with a manual transmission when the combination is made available. The engine is positioned as far back with the chassis as possible, and a 50/50 front/rear weight distribution has been achieved with the car. The Vantage is also the first Aston Martin production car to feature an electronically controlled differential with torque vectoring, and is built around the same all-new bonded-aluminium platform as the DB11, although around 70% of its components are said to be unique to the Vantage. Variants =Vantage AMR= The Vantage AMR is a track focused variant of the Vantage. The main highlight of the model is the replacement of the ZF 8-speed automatic transmission with a dog-leg Graziano Trasmissioni 7-speed manual transmission previously used on the V12 Vantage S. The AMR also comes with a driver selectable AMSHIFT system which controls the throttle during gear shifting. A new limited-slip differential ensures linear delivery of power. The power-band of the engine is wider and the unit is designed to deliver of torque from. 2,000 rpm to 5,000 rpm. The use of a manual transmission and carbon ceramic brakes reduce the weight by . New adaptive dampers with the section of Sport, Sport + and Track modes improve handling. Performance figures include a 0- acceleration time of 3.9 seconds, half a second more than the standard Vantage while the top speed remains the same as the standard model. Visual changes include 20-inch forged wheels as available on the Rapide AMR, new carbon fibre side vents and cooling vents present on the hood a sports exhaust system with quad tail pipes and racing bucket seats. Production of the AMR will be limited to 200 units worldwide. Available exterior colours for the AMR include Sabiro Blue, Pnyx Black, China Grey and White Stone. The final 59 cars will be finished in a Sterling Green exterior colour with Lime accents and will pay homage to the 1959 24 Hours of LeMans victory of Aston Martin. Once the production of the AMR ceases, the 7-speed manual transmission will become available on the standard Vantage. =Vantage Roadster= The Vantage Roadster was revealed in February 2020 with a fabric roof. The roof, claimed to be the fastest of any automotive automatic convertible system, takes 6.7 seconds to lower and 6.8 seconds to raise and can be operated at speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph). =Vantage 007 Edition= The Vantage 007 Edition was revealed in August 2020. Inspired by the Aston Martin V8 Vantage from the 1987 James Bond film The Living Daylights, the Vantage 007 Edition comes equipped with a unique mesh grille and chrome bezel, as well as Cumberland Grey exterior paint over an obsidian black leather interior. Production is limited to 100 units.  Design  Interior The design of the new Vantage is inspired by the track-only Vulcan and the purpose made DB10 that appeared in the James Bond film Spectre. The front grille, specifically inspired by the Vulcan, helps in efficient engine cooling. The Vantage's interior configuration also differs from the DB11 in various ways apart from seating capacity, such as the center console design. Whereas the DB11's center stack controls are quite intuitive and more spatial in terms of button/switch arrangement, the Vantage's appears more cluttered and lacks an optical disc drive, as well as separate temperature displays for the automatic climate control. For purpose of weight saving, the Vantage also forfeits the passenger glove compartment and maintains a simple center console design (as opposed to the DB11's deluxe power-sliding variant).

This Hundred was one of just 6 Hundreds in the County of Gladstone (located in the Roper River area) which was gazetted 09/01/1873. It was named after Captain Bloomfield Douglas, who visited the Roper River in 1872, as Government Resident of the Northern Territory. Although today the area is predominantly covered by the Limmen National Park, the Roper River at the time of the foundation of the hundred was experiencing a rapid expansion of economic activity, and great prospects for the river valley were anticipated by the government in Adelaide. Pastoral leases were being taken up, gold had been discovered at Pine Creek to the north and in 1872 a store deport for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was established at Roper Bar being the furthest point up river that was navigable to ships. Roper Bar, The Sydney Morning Herald. February 8, 2004. The hundred was anticipated to be the seat of a prosperous port. In the 1890s the area was a favorite stop over for drovers bringing cattle between Queensland and the Kimberley region and it had a very wild reputation. Roper Bar, The Sydney Morning Herald.

Situated 68 miles (109 km) from Glasgow it served the industrial and agricultural requirements for transportation in the vicinity of Mennock and the surrounding rural area, originally on behalf of the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway. The goods depot was located on a section of line with a falling southbound gradient of 1 in 160.Sou' West. G&SWR; Association. Number 190. Autumn 2020. p.5 No passenger railway station has been recorded for Mennock. Although a remote location today the facility would have served freight transport requirements in the form of such items as lime for the fields, cattle, horse and sheep movements, milk delivery, coal transport movements and related items, etc. The Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway opened sidings at Mennock for the Leadhills and Wanlockhead mines on 28 October 1850. The lead mines lay about 5 miles (8 km) to the northeast via the steep Mennock Pass. The siding is listed as a public goods station + F for furniture vans and any other road vehicle needing a flat wagon, implying that the siding had an end loading dock.Sou' West. G&SWR; Association. Number 191. Summer 2020. p.3 Bill Lockhart was an occasional signalman at the Mennock box as traffic required in the late 1920s and recalled an occasion when lambs to be loaded into cattle trucks from the pens, however they bolted onto the tracks and had to be rounded up by the farmer and his sheep dogs. Thankfully traffic was quiet.  Infrastructure and working The OS maps of 1898 shows on the eastern side or old 'Up line' a signal box and signals at the location with a rectangular building on the western side or old 'Down line'. From 3 October 1983 all 'Up lines' became 'Down Lines' and vice versa. Road access was a 'T' junction off the main road running past the school to the depot, secured by a gate. In 1856 no signal box or signals are shown although the building on the western side exists that was most likely the goods depot office. Only minor infrastructure was present as might be expected at such a remote location with the double track main line, one siding running off and branching to two loading docks to the west and an access to the depot off the main road. A second short siding ran off on the western side in 1856, lifted by 1898. A track layout diagram of Mennock in 1935 shows the signal box and eleven signals of one sort or another. On the old 'Down Line' a siding running up to the Mennock Burn has been lifted. In LMS days a crossover was present. The two cottages at the entrance have a path running directly into the depot and were likely to have been accommodation for railway workers. The combined cottages are known as 'Mennock Lye'. A road over bridge lies a little way to the south carrying the B797 Mennock Pass road to Leadhills and Wanlockhead. A toll house at that date stood just to the north of the junction on the western side, entered by an unusual walled path and standing on a large masonry base that still exists. A weighing machine was located near this toll house, set into the road surface. By 1898 the toll house had closed and the weighing machine was no longer present. The depot stood close to the Mennock Water and the five arch viaduct that carries the line across, just downstream from the old Mennock Mill ruins. Mennock was served by the 10.00 'Goods' from New Cumnock to Dumfries and the 5.10am Dumfries to New Cumnock in 1913. A 'minerals' from Dumfries to New Cumnock also called. In 1898 the Mennock Lye signal box was open 'Day & Night' and had the call sign on the cabin speaking circuit of 'M K'. If a train was approaching, stopping or leaving on the opposite line when shunting operations were in progress then the train whistle was sounded at Mennock Lye in the form of 2 whistles if the activity was at the sidings. Mennock signal box lay 2 miles and 41 chains from the Sanquhar box, was closed from 6am on Sundays to 6am on Mondays and had a 'switching out' facility. It was 67 miles and 68 chains from Glasgow Bridge Street railway station as measured via Dalry and Kilmarnock. The signal box closed on 10/09/1944 to be replaced by intemediate block signals IBS) operated by a ground frame. It was controlled from Carronbridge. The IBS were abolished from 17/10/1982. The signal box had been a G&SWR; type 1, opened in 1881.  History  The goods depot at Mennock Lye was originally opened by the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway in 1850. Its construction originally related to the requirements of the Leadhills and Wanlockhead mines. It was listed as providing facilities for goods, furniture vans, carriages and portable engines. The line was opened by the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway that joined with the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway to become the Glasgow and South-Western Railway. It became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) during the Grouping of 1923 and finally part of British Railways in 1948. On 7 Dec 1882 an accident took place at 'Mennock Siding' resulting in a passenger fatality. The sidings had been closed on 19 February 1949. The site today The sidings have long been removed as has the signal box, track cross-over, etc., leaving plain double track. The ruins of the old goods depot office building still stands on the western side of the site. An engineers track access point and materials storage area exists slightly to the south of the old depot's location. The present day running line designations are as stated to be the original format above, in that the easternmost or southbound line is the Up line, with the westernmost or northbound line being the Down line. This has been the case since at least early 1995.

It is probably the second oldest mosque that is still standing in Kalimantan. History Kyai Gede Mosque (also spelled Kiai Gede, or Kiyai Gede) was established around 1675. The name Kyai Gede (Javanese for \\"great kyai\\") refers to the name of a kyai who had left the Demak Sultanate in Java after a conflict with the Sultan of Demak. He reached the Sultanate of Banjar in the southern part of Kalimantan where he was told by the ruling Sultan, Mustain Billah, to expand the Sultanate of Banjar to the west. Kyai Gede began his voyage through the upstream of Lamandau River. He arrived in a settlement in what is now the town of Kotawaringin. The small settlement was led by the seven brothers of Demang. With the help of the locals, Kyai Gede managed to solve the problem of the townpeople, and following that he settled in the area to teach Islam. Later, it was recorded that Kyai Gede, together with Prince Adipati Antakesuma decided to establish a Sultanate in Kotawaringin. Together they establish a kraton/palace as well as a mosque for the new kingdom. This mosque was assumed to be established after 1675, the year Pangeran Antakusuma became the new leader of his own kingdom. Because of Kyai Gede's great services in spreading Islam as well as establishing the Sultanate of Kotawaringin, Sultan Mustain Billah entitled him the regent (adipati) of Kotawaringin under the title Patih Hamengubumi and Adipati Gede Ing Kotawaringing. In 1951, Kyai Gede Mosque was restored with the help of funding by the people surrounding the area. A new terrace was added, and the roof shingles were restored. In 1968, the minbar was restored by adding a roof over the outward protruding minbar. Today, however, the addition has been removed to restore the appearance of the mosque to its original form. In 1980-1981, the river bank of Lamandau River was paved to protect the mosque. Another series of restorations of the mosque was done in 1982-1983 and 1985-1986. Today, the Kyai Gede Mosque still stands firm and well-maintained. Maintenance of the mosque was done by the people of the Kotawaringin town. The mosque is still used as a place of worship and as a place for Islamic learning in the area. Architecture The Kyai Gede Mosque was built in the Banjarese variation of the Javanese mosque architecture. The architectural style of the Banjarese mosque shares similarities with the mosques of the Demak sultanates, especially the Great Mosque of Demak. During the course of history, the Banjar develops its own architectural style. One of the main characteristics of Banjarese mosque is the three- or five-tiered roof with a steep top roof, compared to the relatively low-angled roof of Javanese mosque. Another characteristic is the absence of serambi (roofed porch), a traditional feature in Javanese mosques. The Banjarese mosque style is similar with the mosques of West Sumatra and are possibly related to other examples from peninsular Malaysia. Kyai Gede Mosque was constructed out of ulin wood, a type of hardwood which was used for building construction across the Indonesian archipelago. The ulin wood is applied to all parts of the mosque, including the floor, walls, roof frames, and roof shingles. The mosque proper is square shaped about 15.5 x 15.5 meter. The mosque stood on a wooden platform. The Kyai Gede Mosque is built with three tiers of wooden pyramidal roofs supported by four saka guru main posts. The uppermost tier of roof is steeper than the lower roof tiers. The roof of the mosque contains foliage- like finials at the corner of the roofs and on top of the uppermost roof. The wooden posts of the mosque stand over a wooden base instead of set up into the ground.

As a two-year-old in 2016 she won three of her eight races including the Grangecon Stud Stakes and the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes as well as finishing second in the Cheveley Park Stakes and the Lowther Stakes. In the following year she proved herself to be a top-class performer over one mile, recording Group 1 victories in the Falmouth Stakes, Prix Rothschild and Sun Chariot Stakes and running second in both the Irish 1,000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes. Background Roly Poly is a bay mare with a white blaze bred in Kentucky by the Misty For Me Syndicate. As a yearling in September 2015 she was offered for sale at Keeneland but failed to reach her reserve price of $575,000. She was then sent to Europe and entered training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. She is owned by John Magnier's Coolmore Stud partnership (officially Michael Tabor, Susan Magnier and Derrick Smith). She was sired by War Front who won the Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap in 2006. Since retiring War Front has also sired War Command, Declaration of War, and Air Force Blue. Roly Poly's dam Misty For Me was an outstanding racemare whose wins included the Moyglare Stud Stakes, Prix Marcel Boussac, Irish 1,000 Guineas and Pretty Polly Stakes. As a broodmare, she has also produced Roly Poly's full brother U S Navy Flag. Misty For Me's dam Butterfly Cove was a half-sister to Fasliyev. Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Roly Poly made a successful racecourse debut on 25 April when she won a maiden race over five furlongs at Naas Racecourse, starting at odds of 10/1 and prevailing by a short head from the David Wachman-trained Gone To Russia. The filly was immediately stepped up in class and matched against male opposition for the Listed Marble Hill Stakes at the Curragh in which she finished fourth behind her stablemate Caravaggio. She was then sent to England for the Group 2 Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot on 15 June but proved no threat to the American filly Lady Aurelia and came home in eighth place. Eleven days after her run at Ascot Roly Poly was made 3/1 favourite for the Grangecon Stud Stakes over six furlongs on yielding ground at the Curragh. Ridden by Ryan Moore she settled behind the leaders before making steady progress in the last quarter mile, gaining the advantage in the final strides and winning by a neck from the English challenger Seafront. On 8 July Roly Poly was back in England for the Group 2 Duchess of Cambridge Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 6/1 third choice in the betting behind Bletchley (runner-up in the Albany Stakes) and the Godolphin representative Nasimi. With Moore again in the saddle she was among the leaders from the start and went to the front inside the final furlong despite hanging left under pressure. She kept on well in the final strides to win by half a length, a head and a short head from Magical Fire, Nations Alexander and Kilmah. After the race Moore said \\"I‚Äôm delighted with her. It was too soft for her at Ascot and it was a fast race. She was very brave at the Curragh and she's backed up in under two weeks. She's very tough and genuine and has plenty of pace\\". The filly's busy schedule continued in August when she was sent to York Racecourse for the Lowther Stakes and finished second to Queen Kindly having led until well inside the final furlong. In the Group 1 Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Roly Poly started third favourite behind Lady Aurelia and Queen Kindly in a six-runner field. After tracking the front-running Lady Aurelia she overhauled the American filly 50 yards from the finish but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by her unfancied stablemate Brave Anna. Roly Poly ended her season with a trip to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf at Santa Anita Park on 4 November. She started but never looked likely to win and finished ninth of the fourteen runners behind Good Money Honey. =2017: three-year-old season= Spring On her three-year-old debut Roly Poly started favourite for the Nell Gwyn Stakes (a trial race for the 1000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newmarket but finished only seventh behind Daban. In the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches run that year at Deauville Racecourse on 13 May, Roly Poly briefly took the lead 300 metres from the finish but was outpaced in the closing stages and came home sixth behind Precieuse. Two weeks later in the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh she produced a better effort as she stayed on well in the closing stages to take second place, four and three quarter lengths behind her stablemate Winter with Hydrangea in third place. Summer The filly continued her progress in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot in June as she finished two and a quarter lengths second to Winter with Hydrangea in third and Precieuse in seventh. On 14 July Roly Poly started 6/4 favourite for the Group 1 Falmouth Stakes over one mile at Newmarket. Her six rivals were Wuheida (Prix Marcel Boussac), Sea of Grace (runner-up in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Arabian Hope (Ganton Stakes), Delectation (Schwarzgold-Rennen), Opal Tiara (Balanchine) and the Argentinian Grade I winner Greta G. In a tactical change, Moore sent the favourite into the lead from the start and Roly Poly was never seriously challenged, establishing a clear advantage in the final furlong and winning \\"comfortably\\" by one and a quarter lengths from Wuheida. After the race her co-owner Michael Tabor commented \\"It was pretty straightforward. She loves this ground, that's for sure. Ryan said when he came into the paddock that he thought the best thing would be to take her to the front, and she did it well. She's a tough, hardy filly; she's small but she battles well and this surface really suits her\\". Sixteen days after her win in the Falmouth, Roly Poly was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix Rothschild over 1600 metres at Deauville and started the 3.2/1 second favourite behind Qemah. The other eight runners included Usherette (Duke of Cambridge Stakes), Persuasive, Dame du Roi (Prix Miesque), Via Ravenna (Prix Imprudence), Siyoushake (Prix Perth) and Furia Cruzada (Al Maktoum Challenge, Round 2). Roly Poly was up with the leaders from the start and took the advantage 500 metres out. She kept on strongly in the closing stages and held on to win in a four-way photo-finish from Via Ravenna, Siyoushake and Qemah. Ryan Moore commented \\"All through the season she has continued to progress and this was her best-ever performance. She tries so hard and is a high-class filly who seems to thrive on her racing\\". Autumn On 9 September Roly Poly started 13/2 fourth choice in a strongly contested edition of the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown. After leading for most of the way she was overtaken approaching the final furlong and faded in the closing stages to finish sixth behind Hydrangea, Winter, Persuasive, Wuheida and Qemah. Four weeks after her run in the Matron the filly had her eighth run in England when she started 4/1 second favourite behind Persuasive in the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket. The other eleven fillies and mares included Qemah, Usherette, Siyoushake, Aljazzi (Atalanta Stakes) and Muffri'Ha (Darley Stakes). After leading for most of the way she was overtaken by the outsider Dawn of Hope but rallied to regain the advantage inside the final furlong. She drew away from her rivals in the last strides and won by one and quarter lengths from Persuasive. Her win brought took Aidan O'Brien's total of Group 1 wins for the season to 23, two behind Bobby Frankel's record. The trainer commented \\"She's a great filly, with a great heart. She's tactical and tough, amazing really\\". As in the previous year, Roly Poly produced a disappointing run in the Breeders Cup. On this occasion she started third favourite for the Breeders' Cup Mile at Del Mar Racetrack on 4 November but finished unplaced behind World Approval. She ended the season with a trip to Hong Kong for the Hong Kong Mile at Sha Tin Racecourse on 10 December but came home last of the fourteen runners. Assessment and awards In the Cartier Racing Awards for 2016, Roly Poly was nominated for the Champion Two-year-old Filly award.

(image) She was particularly known for her interpretations of Italian verismo works of the late 19th century, and was described as one of the most important figures in opera of the 20th century. Anne Midgette of The New York Times once suggested that she \\"might have had a far bigger career had she been a man\\". Early life and education Fiora d'Itala Rosa Corradetti was born in 1925 on Long Island in Lynbrook to Italian immigrant parents. Her mother was Anna Contino (n√©e Lisarelli), a seamstress; her father, , had been a noted baritone singer at La Scala and other European venues. Fiora Corradetti had no strong singing voice, and said later that she \\"had no voice but learned as a conductor to sing vicariously\\". She studied piano and later conducting. She had an older half sister, Iris, who was an opera singer and vocal coach. At the age of 12, she was appointed as the church organist at the parish of St. Ignatius Martyr in Long Beach. Her father died when she was 14. Corradetti graduated from Long Beach High School and then studied piano performance at Oberlin College, Ohio, receiving a Bachelor of Music degree in piano in 1947. She married Joseph Contino, a fellow Oberlin graduate, changing her name. From 1958, she studied conducting at the Conservatoire Americain in Fontainebleau, France, at the √âcole Normale in Paris, and the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in Austria. She studied with teachers such as Nadia Boulanger and Hans Swarowsky. She received a masters and a doctorate degree in conducting from the Indiana University School of Music (now the Jacobs School of Music) in Bloomington in 1964. While at Jacobs, she made her conducting debut, presenting Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. Conducting In her late 20s, Contino founded the Amherst Community Opera in Massachusetts. She went on to serve as director of organizations including Opera Illinois in Peoria, Illinois, from 1986 to 2005, and the Aspen Choral Institute. She was a professor and choral department chair at Indiana University. In 1998 she made her New York conducting debut with Mascagni's Iris performed by the Teatro Grattacielo at Alice Tully Hall. Paul Griffiths wrote in The New York Times that her debut was a \\"luscious and exultant orchestral performance\\". She worked as a guest conductor with several notable opera companies, orchestras. and music festivals including the Aspen Music Festival, the Anchorage Opera, Chicago Opera Theater, the Pittsburgh Symphony, and the San Francisco Opera. She also conducted frequently at the Temple University Music Festival in Ambler, Pennsylvania. A review of her performance of Puccini's Madama Butterfly in 1973, with Dorothy Kirsten, stated \\"[Contino] held everything together with a baton that was sharp and in clear control of a magnificently coordinated performance\\". Peter G. Davis wrote in 2001 of her performance of Alfano's Risurrezione, based on Leo Tolstoy's last novel, that she \\"may be the last conductor on earth with the music of Alfano and his generation in her bloodstream\\". She considered Italian verismo opera to be her most favored music to conduct, stating in The New York Times in 2001 that it was \\"visceral\\", and she \\"just knew how to do it\\".  Teaching  Contino held faculty positions at Bowling Green State University from 1963‚Äì1966, the Peabody Institute from 1978‚Äì1979, and the University of Texas at Austin. She ran a studio in New York City, where she trained opera singers and conductors. Among her students were Melinda O'Neal, Kenneth Kiesler, and E. Wayne Abercrombie. Personal life and death Contino's marriage to Joseph Contino ended in divorce. She had four children; three daughters (Lisa, Adriana, who was at one time principal cellist for the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra, and Francesca), and one son (Frederic). At the time of her death she had nine grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. Her long-term companion, Jeraldine Baumgartner, died in 2012.

Interchange with the Crossrail station will be determined by the design of the new Old Oak Common station. Under the Transport and Works Act 1992, the project will be subject to a Transport and Works Act Order (TWAO) and governmental funding if construction is to proceed. The scheme would also be examined at a public inquiry before it could be approved by the Secretary of State for Transport. In October 2017, Transport for London began a public consultation on the construction of two new Overground stations, Hythe Road on the West London line and Old Oak Common Lane on the North London line. In December 2018, TfL stated that the construction of the two stations would be heavily dependent on securing government funding. Old Oak Common Lane would be served by London Overground trains running on the North London Line. Additionally, it has been proposed to run trains from and via Old Oak Common Lane to by re-opening the Dudding Hill freight line to passenger services. This scheme, known as the West London Orbital, is currently at public consultation stage with TfL.

Above left: the base of the bergfried The Br√∂mserburg (also called the Niederburg) is located near the banks of the Rhine in the town of R√ºdesheim am Rhein in Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis in the German state of Hesse. Its original structure was probably one of the first stone castles in the Rhine Gorge, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Construction  The older literature (from the 19th century to the 1980s) suggested the Br√∂mserburg was built on the foundations of a Roman fort. However, no antique building fabric has been confirmed and, in particular, it remains unproven that, as previously assumed, it was a watchtower or the bridgehead of a crossing opposite Bingium (Bingen am Rhein) on the left bank of the Rhine. Since this fort was only built in the 4th century, the thesis is not conclusive, because the Romans had already withdrawn from the right bank of the Rhine after the fall of the limes. Two construction phases are identifiable. Researchers do not agree on the dating of the first phase, theories ranging from an early medieval, royal Salhof, dating to before 980, to a mid-12th century castle complex. Examination of an alder post from the foundation of the southeast tower, which is considered to be the oldest part of the castle, showed that the tower could not have been built before 1044 and not after 1216.Proceedings of the General Assembly of the Rheingau Wine Museum, 29 September 2008; Result of the Investigation of a Pile made of Alder Wood from the Foundation of the Tower based on the C-14 Method. Unfortunately, a dendrochronological examination of the wood was not possible because it was a side shoot with only 11 annual rings The end of the 12th century (1186-1190) was the final period of construction for the second castle. The shape of the castle, even during its first construction phase, corresponded largely to its present dimensions. It was protected by an enceinte and moats; in those days the Rhine flowed, according to historical engravings, immediately past its southern front - unlike today, where there is a road and wide riverbank zone between the castle and the river. However, the enceinte was thinner (1.6-1.7 metres) and lower than it is today. In the southeast corner there used to be a tower house (donjon), now gone. The tower diagonally opposite, which has survived, also originates from this first phase and served to defend the gate (gate tower) as well as acting as a bergfried. At that time, its height reached up to the upper edge of the present fighting platform. During the second construction phase, the outer wall was reinforced, cladded with brick and raised. Other buildings were built onto the donjon up to the same height, and completely vaulted in up to four storeys (a unique design for a castle on the Rhine); thus a quadrangular structure was created. At the same time the courtyard was raised in height and, in the centre, a massive, new bergfried was erected which was joined onto adjacent elements of the second phase without any joints. Originally it had a wall thickness of more than 4 metres in the lower section and was estimated to be about 35 metres high. Due to the location of the entrance of the new bergfried - the elevated entrance is on the highest surviving floor) it is clear that the tower must have been much higher than it is today; it clearly rose above the adjoining buildings and thus gave the castle a much less \\"squat\\" appearance than it has today.  History  Tombleson In the 13th century, the family of Br√∂mser from the Wisper valley are recorded as castellans (Burgherren) of the castle within the territory of the archbishops of Mainz. In 1640, the south-eastern corner, facing the Rhine, was blown up by French troops of Duke Henry II of Orleans during the Thirty Years' War, at the same time destroying the upper part of the bergfried and the donjon. A mine passageway was driven into the bergfried, but there was no explosion. It is still visible today. The popular assertion that the Br√∂mser von R√ºdesheim family lived in the castle from 1548 until they died out in 1668, is wrong. What really happened is that, after the main line of the R√ºdesheim family died out on the death of Melchior von R√ºdesheim in 1538, the Br√∂msers gradually took over the R√ºdesheim fief. The Br√∂msers never actually lived there, but always resided in their own house, the Br√∂mserhof in Oberstra√üe 29 in R√ºdesheim. After the Br√∂msers died out, the Archbishop of Mainz granted the fiefdom to Emmerich of Metternich, an heir of the Br√∂mser von R√ºdesheim family, in 1678. As the castle remained uninhabited, it fell into ruin in the 18th century and was initially nicknamed \\"Br√∂mser's dog house\\", and, later, \\"Metternich's dog house\\". After 1811, the new owners - the counts of Ingelheim - undertook a romanticised expansion of the castle into a country house. In the south wing, these features were removed again in the 1950s during a renovation. The castle was lived in until 1937. In 1941 it was bought by the town of R√ºdesheim. Since 1950, it has housed the Rheingau Wine Museum with exhibits of wine culture from antiquity to the present day. In 1961, the destroyed south-east corner was reconstructed and, in 1969, the keep was raised to a height of 27 metres.

Career and life  Law was born on 4 February 1807 in Sheffield, to John Law (silversmith). He married Hannah Ellen Hilliard in October 1834, just prior to their emigration to Australia on the ship Sarah, arriving in Hobart Town on 15 February 1835. The Laws were Master and Mistress of the Infant School in Hobart Town, and it was during their work there, circa 1835‚Äì1836, that Law completed the portrait busts of Woureddy (also written as Wouraddy, a Tasmanian Aboriginal chief of the Brune Island) and his wife, Trucaninny. Copies of the busts were sold overseas and the sculptures were exhibited by Launceston resident Henry Dowling at the 1866-67 Intercolonial Exhibition in Melbourne. They have been described as the most outstanding sculpture of the 19th century in Australia. The busts were purchased by Judah Solomon (a convict turned businessman), and there could be as many as 30 casts made, with 20 known to be held in private and public collections. There are copies in the Dumoutier's collection in the Mus√©e de l'Homme, Paris. Plomley has suggested that other busts of Aboriginal people within this collection are also by Law. Law was commissioned to create a bust of George Augustus Robinson in August 1835, and that same year, a posthumous bust of Dr James Ross for the Land Mechanics' Institute. The Laws separated and were living apart in 1844, then in October 1850, Hannah died of consumption. In June 1851, Law remarried to Anne Beaton, a Scottish dressmaker. In November 1855, their almost-two-year- old son Joseph died of dysentery, and 8 days later, 24-day-old Benjamin junior died of the same condition. On 22 November 1855, Anne also died of dysentery. The remaining twin child of Benjamin junior, James Beaton, died at four months old from pneumonia on 16 February 1856. Martha Law was the only surviving child. Law died of bladder disease and bronchitis on 5 July 1882 in Moonee Ponds. His death date has previously been erroneously listed in Glover's 1985 article, as 1 October 1890 in Westbury, but this was a different Benjamin Law. = Sculpture controversy = In 1981, Mary Mackay made a case for the busts being part of the portrait tradition, rather than as anthropological curiosities. The bust of Woureddy was modelled from a number of sittings, and both busts were considered to be commissioned by George Augustus Robinson. In October 1988, Joanna Mendelssohn described the portrait busts as \\"countering the historical whitewash\\" within the Art Gallery of New South Wales' Great Australian Art exhibition. She notes that while the portrait busts were considered as anthropological records for many years, that their merit as analytical portraits as genocide survivors, has not been considered. In 2001, artist Julie Gough asked for the portrait busts to be excluded from the Collection Focus exhibition at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. In 2012, the portrait busts were included in the exhibition \\"Controversy: the power of art\\", at the Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery.  Removal from TMAG's display  In August 2006, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) removed the two Aboriginal portrait busts from display, pending advice from their Aboriginal Advisory Council. In 2009, the busts had been on loan from the Solomon family to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery for 26 years, prior to an attempted auction by Sotheby's and a display at the National Portrait Gallery. However, it was noted that the busts were on display in TMAG's upstairs Colonial Gallery in 2010. In May 2010, David Hansen (former TMAG curator and then working for Sotheby's) was the joint winner of the annual Calibre Prize for an Outstanding Essay for his piece, \\"Seeing Truganini\\". The piece included reflection on the significance of the portrait bust.  Bust after Law  A wooden model after of one of the busts (created by artist John Vink in 1990, inspired by Law) was removed from an international exhibition, The Beaded Links. It was planned to be used to display a shell necklace by artist Lola Greeno, but it was decided to exclude it from display to avoid offence.  Removal requests  In 2009, Aboriginal community leaders in Tasmania wrote to museums and galleries, asking for any copies of the portrait busts of Woureddy and Trucaninny, to be removed from display. Pending further meetings, representatives of the community advised that the images of their ancestors should not be displayed without permission, as well as registering dismay at the description of Trucaninny as the last \\"full blood\\" Tasmanian aboriginal. The cultural institutions contacted by letter, included the Melbourne Museum, the University of Melbourne, the British Museum and Chicago's Field Museum. Campaigners included Aboriginal activist, Michael Mansell, Greens leader, Nick McKim, and Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre secretary Nala Mansell. The campaign began in response to a planned sale of the paired busts by Sotheby's in August 2009, with estimates between $500,000 and $700,000 and included protests outside the auction house in Melbourne. The vendors removed the sculptures from the sale hours before the auction. = Articles = * Glover, Margaret (1985). Benjamin Law 1807‚Äì1890. Early Tasmanian sculptor.

The concept was introduced into the field of orthodontics in the late 1950s by Moorrees and Kean. A horizontal line related to the natural head position has been recommended as the most reliable plane to study cephalometric analysis.  History  Anthropologists and craniologists when studying skulls faced a dilemma which was related to the head position of the skulls relative to the head position of the living human beings. In order to take care of this problem a horizontal axis line outside the skull was used to approximate a natural head position of the skull. However, a linkage between an outside horizontal plane and a horizontal plane on the skull still had to be done. Thus, after several meetings, in 1882 at a craniometric conference in Frankfort, Germany a plane known as the Frankfort horizontal plane was proposed through left and right porion and left orbitale as a horizontal plane that can be used to study skulls. In the meeting of 1884, this plane was finally accepted. = Drawbacks of other planes = Planes such as the Frankfort horizontal plane or sella-nasion plane have their own drawbacks. The anatomical points that these planes are based on are not known to be stable over time, which may lead to variability and error in studying the cephalometric analysis of a patient. For example, the nasion-sella line which part of our anterior skull is used as a reference line for lateral cephalometric radiographs. The nasion point is known to be move anteriorly and inferiorly over time and thus can lead to an error in the values that are used to study the maxillo-mandibular relationship to the cranial base in lateral cephalometrics. Frankfurt Horizontal plane itself has been known to show an error of anywhere between +9 and -7 degrees. This plane is compromised by two points: Porion and Orbitale. Identifying the porion by itself is shown high variability, especially due to the point machine porion sometimes overlapping the anatomical porion.  Registration  Registration of natural head position was defined by Solow and Tallgren in 1970s. They used the term 'orthoposition' in which a person is asked to stand in front of a mirror and look into their own eyes after a set of neck exercises. Other ways of registering natural head position have been described by Lundstrom who used an operator-based natural head position. Other methods such as use of inclinometer, fluid device or looking at a small light have also been described.  Reproducibility  Ideally, a cephalometric plane should have good reliability, good individual reproducibility, and be as close to true horizontal plane and true vertical plane as possible. Many studies over time have discussed the reproducibility of the natural head position in patients. Cooenrad and Morees in 1958, performed a study where they looked at two groups of 20-year-old female students at the Forsyth School for Dental Hygienists were radiographed in their natural head position.

It was designed in the Federation Free Classical style based on original designs by Colonial Architect, James Barnet and his assistant Edward Rumsey. It was built from 1885 to 1887 by David Jones. The property is owned by the New South Wales Department of Justice. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Goulburn has had four courthouses. The first was built around 1830 and was a rough hewn timber building. A drawing for a second courthouse designed by the architect William Buchanan is dated 1834. It is not clear whether this building was intended for the first or second township nor whether it was built. The colonial architect Mortimer Lewis designed the third courthouse in 1835 but it was not built until 1847 after the first permanent gaol and lock up were built on the siteConservation Plan, Heritage Group, 1993 Nothing is known of the grounds prior to the building of the present courthouse. This, the fourth courthouse, was designed by the colonial architect James Barnet. The building of it was delayed by the completion of Goulburn's new gaol on the northern outskirts of the town. A second permanent lock up, designed by Barnet, was also completed prior to the building of the fourth courthouse. It was linked to the Lewis courthouse after the new courthouse was completed in 1887, and the third courthouse subsequently became the Lands Office in 1888. The builder of the courthouse was David Jones, a contractor from Bathurst (who had just completed Bathurst Courthouse). The building took 30 months to complete and cost 24, 593 pounds to construct. It provided separate rooms for the Circuit Court (District Court and Quarter Sessions) and Magistrates Court (Petty Sessions), functions dating back respectively to 1847 and 1832. The stone dwarf wall and iron picket fence was not constructed until 1900 with the Goulburn Herald reporting that tenders were invited until 16 October 1899. The planting of the grounds were also carried out at this time.  Description  The Goulburn Court House and Residence is an impressive and monumental building designed by Colonial Architect James Barnet in the Victorian Free Classical style. It is symmetrically planned about a central copper dome set on an octagonal base flanked on either side by wing buildings with arched colonnades on the ground floor and setback arched window openings on the first floor (Schwager Brooks and Partners). The main entrance has an arched porch with pedimented roof flanked either side by long arched colonnades with baulstered parapets. These colonnades are terminated by pediments bearing the New South Wales Coat of Arms. Construction is of distinct rust-red colour polychrome brick with decorative sandstone facing relief work. The two court rooms are each approximately 15m x 9m wide with public galleries reached by stone stairways on either side of the curved pendentives supporting the dome. The building's walls, floors and ceilings are richly decorated using plaster and cedar joinery, all of which is in very good condition. The main elevation is approached via a formal garden of mature, exotic trees, lawns and shrubs being enclosed by a tall iron picket fence . This fence contains a fine set of gates and stone gate piers. The building has a high degree of integrity with few alterations and it is well maintains its historical and aesthetic integrity with surviving early plantings and hard elements and largely sympathetic recent changes and plantings.Heritage Group 1993 = Modifications and dates = * 1830-32 - First court house built at Goulburn Plains, exact site unknown. * 1833 - Site for permanent gaol and court house reserved at crossing of main streets. * 1834 - Second court house designed and possibly built. * 1835 - Third court house designed by Mortimer Lewis. * 1847-8 - Third court house built by James Sinclair * 1857 - Alterations to Third court house - gallery, two porches and kitchen added * 1866 - Jury room added to court house * 1872 - unspecified alterations to the court house * 1884-7 - Fourth court house built, architect Barnet/Rumsey, builder David Jones * 1888 - Third courthouse became Crown Lands Office * 1898 - Drawings prepared for court house fence * 1971 - Government architect minor alterations to court house * 1982-5 - Petty Sessions became Local Court * 1991 - Government Architect minor alterations * 1993 - Proposed linking of court house gardens to Belmore Park via chicanes.  Heritage listing  The Goulburn Court house is significant as it is part of an intact Victorian civic precinct in a NSW regional centre together with Bathurst Court house, Goulburn reflects the development of the state in the late 19th century. Comparable developments include being at the end of an important rail line and the change in character of the towns from penal settlements to regional government administrative centres. The Goulburn courthouse and its setting is an expression of a cultural and developmental phase, embodying the confidence of the late Victorian era and is associated with the coming of age of the town, the lobbying for civic improvement and demonstrates an important phase in the town's evolution and development. The design is associated with and is a climactic work of the architect Barnet and his team at the Government Architects Office. The extravagance of the grand courthouses at Goulburn and Bathurst was never to be repeated after the 1890s depression and restructure of the Government Architects Office. It is both a representative and a rare example of an important Victorian courthouse with related garden. Other courthouses either never had substantial gardens or such gardens do not retain their Victorian character. The building is an accomplished example of Victorian Free Classical design demonstrating Palladian concepts and Mannerist influences. The architectural design shows academic excellence. The building demonstrates exceptional standards of construction in both materials and workmanship. The building contains the highest quality stone carving, bricklaying, metal and timberwork. The exceptional quality extends even to details such as ventilation and door furniture and to the fine structure which forms the dome. The Goulburn Courthouse garden enhances and is enhanced by the courthouse buildings and Belmore Park opposite. The courthouse garden is related to but, importantly, distinct from Belmore Park. Its formal character is emphasised by its separation from the street by fences and gates. The place has been in continual use for its original purpose for the last 100 years and for the foreseeable future.

Early life She was born on 29 April 1917 at Old Court, Hanger Hill, Ealing, London, the second of five children of Richard Herbert Vercoe (1884‚Äì1930), a doctor, and his wife, (Elizabeth) Selina Vercoe, n√©e Skinner (1881‚Äì1960). Vercoe was educated at Chelmsford County High School for Girls, followed by Chelsea School of Art, where her teachers included Graham Sutherland and Henry Moore. Career She first worked for the London District Theatre Unit as an actress and costume designer, before joining the Players' Theatre costume department during the Second World War. After the war, Vercoe worked in Stratford-upon-Avon's Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, where she was the costume designer for The Taming of the Shrew, and toured with the company in Australia in 1949‚Äì50 as a costume designer, and as an actress understudy. After this, she essentially became a costume designer full-time, and stopped acting. Vercoe was a regular collaborator with Jonathan Miller on his opera and theatre productions. She was known for her meticulous historical research, and for using ordinary everyday clothes of the period, rather than \\"costumes\\". Miller's 1982 production of Verdi's opera Rigoletto for English National Opera, set in 1950s New York, was set designed by Patrick Robertson and costume designed by Vercoe. It was most recently revived in 2017, using Vercoe's costume design, which reviewers still comment on, \\"the mafia concept, although prolific in opera stagings these days, is still a perfect fit for Rigoletto\\". London's Victoria and Albert Museum includes Vercoe's costumes from the 1979 English National Opera production of The Turn of the Screw. The V&A; also houses her extensive archives.

The film was released on Netflix on November 17, 2017. A sequel, titled A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding, was released in 2018 and another one in 2019, A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby. Plot Just before Christmas, an aspiring young American magazine journalist, Amber Moore, is sent to the foreign nation of Aldovia to cover a press conference given by Prince Richard, who is set to take the throne following his father's recent death. Richard has been portrayed in the press as an irresponsible playboy and he is also rumored to be planning to abdicate. Amber hopes her work in Aldovia will lead to a big break and she heads to the royal family's palace for the press conference, but the prince fails to appear. Rather than leave with the press pack, Amber decides to snoop around the palace and while doing so is mistaken for young Princess Emily's new American tutor, Martha Anderson. Amber plays along and assumes Martha's identity in order to investigate the rumors of abdication. Emily, who has spina bifida, tries to prank Amber into quitting, but warms up to her after Amber treats her like a normal student rather than an invalid. As Emily's tutor, Amber meets the royal family, including Richard, who she realizes is the man she insulted earlier at the Aldovian airport after he stole the taxi she was about to get into. Amber becomes attracted to Richard after learning that contrary to rumors he is a compassionate and responsible man, though he is indeed reluctant to take the throne. During this time Amber learns from Emily that Richard's scheming and jealous cousin Simon is next in line for the throne, which he sorely wants; Amber also encounters Richard's beautiful ex-girlfriend Sophia, who Richard suspects was only interested in him for his future title. Emily learns the truth about Amber's identity but agrees to keep it secret so long as Amber writes a story that exposes Prince Richard for the good man that he is. In pursuit of her story, Amber follows Richard on horseback through the woods, but her horse throws her off and she is nearly attacked by a wolf, only to be saved by the prince. Richard takes Amber to his father's old hunting cabin, where he reveals that after he told his father he was going to renounce the throne they had a fight and that the king died soon after. Richard then shows Amber a mysterious poem written by his father, and the two almost kiss but are interrupted by the sound of neighing horses. After Richard leaves to check on the animals, Amber searches the late king's desk and discovers a hidden compartment holding documents proving that the Prince was secretly adopted; she hides the documents and takes them back to the palace. Amber is reluctant to reveal the truth as it would deeply hurt Richard but decides to tell him during a walk. Richard interrupts her confession with a kiss, and Amber realizes she is in love with him. At the same time, a suspicious Sophia and Simon search Amber's room and discover her true identity and Richard's adoption certificate. At the Christmas Eve Ball, as Richard prepares to be crowned, Sophia reveals his adoption certificate and Amber's true identity. Simon asserts himself as next in line for the throne as Richard storms off and rebuffs a repentant Amber's apologies, and she tearfully leaves the palace. Later, the queen reveals to Richard that she adopted him after being told she could not have children, and that she regretted not telling him sooner, but that she and the king considered him their true son. Richard forgives his mother for her deception and promises to not let Simon win the throne so easily. Simon marries Sophia but learns he cannot be crowned until the queen is available to preside over the ceremony. Meanwhile, Amber suspects that she can prove Richard is the rightful king based on clues from his father's poem. She is allowed back into the palace and in a Christmas ornament made by the late king, finds a secret proclamation that declares Richard as the rightful heir. Amber takes the document to the official chamber where Simon is being crowned and arrives in time for Richard to be crowned instead; she quietly leaves Aldovia after the ceremony. Back home, the magazine Amber works for refuses to publish her story on Richard, calling it a 'puff piece'. In anger, she quits the magazine, deciding to blog about the true Richard instead. Her blog becomes popular and eventually gains the attention of Richard himself. Amber is spending New Year's Eve at her father's New York City diner when Richard surprises her. He tells Amber that he is truly in love with her and proposes, which she happily accepts. Cast Location The trilogy was filmed at Pele»ô Castle, Sinaia, Romania.

Rhodes spent most of his life as an attorney in Mississippi. After serving a tenure in the United States Patent Office in Washington, D.C., he was appointed as first and only Commissioner of Confederate States Patents from 1861-1865 based in Richmond, Virginia.  Early life  Rufus Rhodes was the first child born to Capt. Thomas Rhodes (1774-1865) and his third wife, Jemima Williamson Rhodes (1797-1867) in Wilcox County, Alabama. His father was a US government land surveyor for the Louisiana Purchase who had left his wife, children, and home in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana to survey recently ceded Indian lands in south Mississippi and south Alabama. While there, he met Jemima, the daughter of wealthy planter, George Williamson, and the two were married. His father was captain of engineers for Andrew Jackson. While surveying he saw a business opportunity using the new technology of steamboats to get sugar to market, becoming a pioneering steamboat captain who was said to have operated the first steamboat on the Alabama River He also transported mail between New Orleans and Mobile. At an early age, Rufus moved with his family to Mobile, where Thomas Rhodes purchased a home prior to 1829. While in Mobile, Thomas Rhodes dabbled as an attorney, dealing mainly with estate settlements, but he began to set his sights on the richly timbered lands in nearby Jackson County, Mississippi. The Rhodes family bought a summer house in East Pascagoula, Mississippi in 1834. This site later became the site of the East Pascagoula Hotel opened there in 1836. The Rhodes family held a residence in Mobile, Alabama but put down roots in Jackson County as early as 1840, and Rufus' father began operating a sawmill there. Rufus Rhodes later said that he had been a resident of Jackson County since about 1828.  Marriages  Rufus Rhodes married Jane Myers in Jackson County, Mississippi on January 15, 1846. She was the daughter of William Myers, an early settler of Jackson County and inhabitant of Griffin Point in present day Moss Point. Jane Rhodes died on March 19, 1852, aged 22 years, two months, and 13 days. Rufus and Jane Rhodes had two daughters. Rufus married, second, Martha Anne Fisher in New Orleans, Louisiana on May 13, 1854. She was the daughter of Samuel Fisher, native of Newborne, North Carolina. They had a son Rufus Napoleon Rhodes who was the founder, editor and owner of the Birmingham News. and member of the Tennessee legislature from 1881-1882.  Education and career  Rufus Rhodes was working as an attorney as early as 1846 when he applied for a position as District Attorney of Lauderdale County, Mississippi. He was listed as a lawyer in the 1850 Jackson County, Mississippi census and on Mississippi Law Registers of 1851, 1852, 1853, and 1856. In the January-February 1854 session of the Mississippi House of Representatives, Rufus served as a member-elect from Jackson County and brought forth ideas such as reqlinquishing a plot of land in Jackson County to the United States for the erection of a military asylum. He proposed the incorporation of Ocean Springs, Mississippi and connecting the Mississippi Gulf Coast by rail via New Orleans or Mobile. The latter passed in the later formation of the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad. Rufus Rhodes' home at East Pascagoula, Mississippi was burned by an arsonist during the night of August 27, 1856. The family barely escaped alive, and Rhodes' infant, Rufus Napoleon Rhodes, was badly burned when an ember ignited his night gown. About this time, Rufus accepted a position as an examiner in the United States Patent office in Washington, D. C. and moved there with his family after June, 1857. Soon after, he gained a seat on the Patent Office's Board of Appeals. Some idea of Rufus‚Äô work in the patent office can be attained from a rejected appeal dated December 22, 1858, in which a report was written to the commissioner of patents and signed by the three board members, DeWitt C. Lawrence, Rufus R. Rhodes, and A. B. Little . The rejected patent was submitted by George B. Simpson for a patent of insulating telegraph wires by coating them with gutta percha. The application was rejected by the examiner on the grounds that the idea of coating telegraph wires with gutta percha was well known and had been in use in America, England, and France as early as 1839. Simpson objected, stating that he had first filed application for a patent on the idea in 1847. The objection being before the Board of Appeals, it came upon these three men to decide. Rufus Rhodes and his two counter-parts agreed that the idea had been in existence for many years prior to Simpson‚Äôs initial claim, and they derived, further, that since Simpson had made no attempt to appeal since his first rejection in 1851, that the idea of insulating telegraph wires with gutta percha was now abandoned to the public. The Board of Appeals denied Simpson‚Äôs claim to the idea and moved to recommend that the application be finally rejected. The Board of Appeal‚Äôs recommendation was then forwarded to the Commissioner of Patents, J. Holt, who confirmed and rejected the application on February 2, 1859. Rufus' nephew, Thomas Rhodes Duval, moved to Washington, D. C. to study law under Rhodes. He was enumerated on the 1860 Washginton, D. C. census with Rufus, Martha, their children, and a domestic servant named Nancy on June 12, 1860. At this time, Rufus was a Master Mason at Dawson's Lodge (#16) of the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia. The family lived at 461 E Street North, after moving there from a boarding house on Louisiana Avenue in 1858. Its neighboring structure, 463 E Street North was described in 1859 as a four story brick house with a back building, a bathroom, and gas [lighting] throughout. The home sat just four blocks east of Ford's Theater.  Civil War  Abraham Lincoln won the presidential vote on November 6, 1860. Four days later, Rufus Rhodes wrote a letter from Washington, D.C. to Mississippi Governor John J. Pettus, leaving no question as to where his loyalties lay. \\"I cannot with my views hold office under a Republican President a single instance of time without a total sacrifice of my self-respect. To do it would involve not only a loss of my own self-respect, but brand me as a disgraced and dishonored man in the estimation of all for whose good opinion I am anxious, namely the Southern people. I regard the election of Lincoln as a verdict against the equality of the southern states on the part of the sectional majority of the north‚Ä¶.‚Äù ‚ÄúInfatuated by a spell which love of the Union and a veneration for the works of our Father‚Äôs hands cast over our own perceptions,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúwe have hitherto refused to see and hear, or, seeing and hearing, to take heed of the lurid glare which lighted up and the muttering thunder which resonated from the northern skies with increasing spread and volume‚Ä¶.Not altogether unnaturally we permitted this Delilah by her blandishments to steal away our judgment and persuade us to cling to the fond delusion that a sense of justice and of the right only slumbered among the northern people and would yet be awakened to gladden us by renewed demonstrations of fraternity and affection as in bye gone days when our fathers lived, until lo! The Philistine hosts are upon us‚Ä¶.‚Äù Rufus concluded his letter to Governor Pettus with this offer: ‚ÄúNot doubting that all Mississippians entertain the views I have thus hastily expressed I must believe that Mississippi will secede from the Union‚Ä¶.My object therefore in writing this is to tender through you her honored chief magistrate my humble services in that event in any sphere in which they can be of use.‚Äù In Washington D. C., forty-two year old Rufus Rhodes put his name to a letter, on November 15, 1860, that was being circulated amongst the friends of B. F. DeBow . DeBow sent the letter to the editor of the Charleston Mercury to show support to those friends there and elsewhere who were expressing ‚Äútheir opinions in regard to the incoming black republican administration.‚Äù The letter, to which Rufus and eighteen other signed, read ‚ÄúThe undersigned, occupying offices under the Federal Government at Washington, deem that it is due to their Southern friends to say that under no circumstances will they consent to hold office under Abraham Lincoln.‚Äù The Cleveland Leader of December 17, 1860 reported in disgust that Rufus R. Rhodes, a clerk in the Patent office had been approved six weeks of leave to visit Mississippi. Rhodes, a secessionist, was to continue receiving his $2,500.00 salary while taking concerting measures to break up the Union as a member of the Mississippi [secession] Convention. Some three weeks later, the Mississippi Convention in Jackson convened with a vote on January 9, 1861 that was in favor of secession and removal of the state of Mississippi from the Union. Rufus appears to have moved his family back to Mississippi during this time, as his son Samuel was born at [East] Pascagoula on February 6, 1861. Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and a personal friemd of Rhodes, appointed Rhodes as Commissioner of the Confederate States Patent Office in May 1861. The office was then in Montgomery, Alabama, but when the Confederate capital was moved to Richmond, Virginia a month later, Rhodes traveled there to set up the new office. Rufus Rhodes opened his patent office in Richmond's former Customs House building, which was shared with the offices of the Confederate War Department and the office of the Attorney General. The Patent office was located in the south front room on the third floor, and large room in the rear of the office was used for exhibition of models of inventions. During the war, Rufus served on committees that raised relief for the wounded soldiers of Mississippi and for the relief and aid of the exiled citizens of New Orleans. Of the exiled citizens of New Orleans, one was Rhodes' sister, Mrs. Theodore Duval, and her family and also his father-in-law, Samuel Fisher. Rhodes wrote a letter to Mississippi Governor John J. Pettus on March 12, 1863 on behalf of Mr. Fisher. ‚ÄúMy Dear Sir,‚Äù he began, ‚ÄúAs an old friend I venture to invoke your services on behalf of my father-in-law Mr. Sam‚Äôl C. Fisher who is a fugitive from New Orleans where he resided and who is by the chance of war cut off from all of his resources. He has no funds or resources that he can now command and the necessity of procuring employment presses upon him with a sternness that admits of neither delay or escape. I ask you to find some employment for him as a favor I can never forget. You know well were our positions relatively the converse of what they are I would strain every nerve to serve a friend of yours, and I do not doubt that you will grant the favor I ask if it be within your powers. Mr. Fisher is an accomplished book keeper and business man generally and I am sure he would fill any place you might procure for him with ability. He desires to be as near to New Orleans as possible to increase the chances of occasionally hearing from his wife and children. His sons that are old enough to bear arms are in our army or already dead upon the field of Shiloh and hence he does not wish to come to Richmond where I could find a place for him. I take it that among all your kind friends I have troubled you as little if not less than any other and it appears to me therefore that I have some small right to ask you for this small favor. Rufus signed the letter, ‚ÄúVery faithfully & truly, your friend, Rufus R. Rhodes.‚Äù As the war intensified, Rufus sent his wife Martha and their children to live at Cluster Springs, Virginia, away from the front lines. Rufus fled Richmond with the rest of the Confederate Government on April 2, 1865 (\\"Evacuation Sunday\\"). He was captured by Federal forces at Danville, Virginia, in May 1865 just as the war was drawing to a close.  Post War  When the Civil War ended, Rufus signed an Oath of Allegiance to the United States on May 23, 1865 shortly after his capture at Danville. Due to his affiliation with the Confederate Government, Rhodes had to apply for amnesty and seek a presidential pardon. Rhodes went to Washington, D.C. and signed, on July 24, 1865, the oath prescribed by President Andrew Johnson's proclamation of May 29, 1865. While in Washington, Rhodes visited his old friend Charles Mason. The two had worked together in the Patent Office before the war. Mason wrote in his diary that day, \\"He [Rhodes] gives a sad account of the condition of things south.\\" Rufus Rhodes received his pardon in September, 1865. Rhodes returned briefly to Jackson County, Mississippi but then moved to New Orleans, Louisiana to practice law prior to April, 1866. In January, 1867, he and fifteen other men in New Orleans were allowed to resume their law practices after taking the Constitutional Oath. Rufus settled in as a patent attorney on the third floor of 23 Commercial Place in New Orleans. He held this position until his death, or at least as late as the summer of 1869.  Death  Rufus Rhodes died of a stroke in New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 16, 1870. Two weeks later, the Second District Judicial Court of Orleans Parish appointed Martha Rhodes, his widow, as executor to the estate. On December 5, 1870, all furniture and personal items belonging to Rufus at his 319 Second Street residence and his Commercial Place business office. The estate was valued at $8,830.30. Martha Rhodes moved her children to Clarksville, Tennessee where she taught school for many years. Rufus Rhodes' son, Rufus Napoleon Rhodes, became the celebrated editor of the Birmingham Times.

She was part of a delegation to the Prime Minister in 1914. She later became a councillor and in 1937 she was West Ham's first woman mayor. Life Parsons was born in Poplar in London in 1890. Her father Alfred Albert Millo dealt in jewellery when he was well and her mother Elizabeth worked as a charlady. She had five younger brothers and she left school early so that she could care for them. At fourteen she was a maid working for the local librarian. Parsons took piecework in a tobacco factory and she was surprised to find how little she earned compared to the men, who also had comfortable restroom for breaks, women only had toilets. She brought up an orphaned niece and three daughters with her husband Robert Stanley (Tom) Parsons, who was a driver for the Stepney Borough Council and a union activist. They married on 19 December 1908 in the Congregational Chapel, Barking Road, Plaistow. When Parson's eldest child became due for a vaccination she applied to have an exemption but she was told that only fathers could apply. The 1914 deputation - Parsons is on the right Parsons was inspired by Minnie Baldock in Canning Town and so she joined Sylvia Pankhurst's East London Federation of Suffragettes and became the secretary of the branch in South West Ham. In 1914 Sylvia Pankhurst went on hunger strike and refused to stop until the Prime minister received women so that they could present their case for the vote. Asquith agreed and Parsons was able to tell him of her problems as she was one of the six women chosen including Jessie Payne, led by Mrs Julia Scurr. She told Asquith that she gave birth to children but she had little say in deciding \\"what is good for them.\\" During world war one the East London Federation of Suffragettes opened a baby clinic and Parsons was the manager. She was remembered as assertive and persuasive, After the war she was asked to help the local council distribute help for mothers. She joined the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee in 1919. In 1922 she was elected as a socialist borough councillor on the West Ham Council. In 1931 she was deputy Mayor, a Justice of the Peace in 1933, and then in 1935 she was made an Alderman and the following year she became West Ham's first female Mayor. As a result she opened the local lido, got to drive the first local trolleybus and returned to the youth club in Canning Town which had inspired her. During World War Two, Parsons organised children's evacuation locally and helped organise the Women's Voluntary Service. Her brother and a niece were killed in the Blitz. Parsons was awarded the honour of the Freedom of West Ham in 1939, and MBE in the New Year Honours of 1951 and she died in Stratford in London in 1957.Tim Wales, ‚ÄòParsons , Marguerite Lena (1890‚Äì1957)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 21 November 2017 There is a mural made as communal art at Hermit Road Park, a testament to how well she was regarded in this area.

The terrane is located at the junction between the Western Blue Ridge and the Eastern Blue Ridge Mountains. The unique lithology., age, and metamorphic history of the MHT suggest an exotic terrane origin, unrelated to either the Laurentian or peri-Gondwanan terranes that make up most of the Appalachian Mountains. Whole-rock Rb-Sr dating suggests an age of 1.8 Ga for the MHT, making it the oldest terrane in the southern Appalachians by 600 million years.  Characteristics  The main outcrops of the Mars Hill Terrane occur in far western North Carolina, between Mars Hill and Roan Mountain. There are additional associated Mesoproterozoic outcrops that may also be a part of the terrane. The MHT is unique in the southern Appalachians, for several reasons: # Lithology. The MHT comprises a more diverse set of rocks than any other basement exposure in the southern Appalachians, including mafics/ultramafics interspersed with granitic gneisses. In contrast: #* The Western Blue Ridge show no mafics/ultramafics at all. These metasedimentary rocks were likely originally deposited as sedimentary sequences on the margin of Laurentia before the various terrane accretions starting forcing up the Appalachians #* The Eastern Blue Ridge Mountains do show some mafic rocks, but always in contact with metasedimentary rocks. This is likely because the Eastern Blue Ridge comprises island arc(s) and their accompanying sedimentary sequences that docked onto Laurentia during the Phanerozoic. Additionally, the Eastern Blue Ridge mafics are rarely migmatitic; the MHT mafics are often migmatitic. # Metamorphic Grade. The MHT has been metamorphosed to granulite facies. In contrast, Western and Eastern Blue Ridge rocks rarely experienced metamorphism above amphibolite facies. # Age. Whole-rock Rb-Sr dating suggests crystallization from magma at 1.8 Ga. This is significantly earlier than most Western/Eastern Blue Ridge rocks, which are consistently age-dated at less than 750 Ma. In terms of lithology, age, and metamorphic history, the MHT appears to be related to Paleoproterozoic terranes in the Great Lakes region of the U.S. and Canada.  Origins and evolution  * 1.8 Ga - Crystallization from magma. Whole-rock Rb-Sr dating suggests that initial protolith crystallization occurred near 1.8 Ga. The original tectonic environment is now difficult to discern, because these rocks have been metamorphosed repeatedly since their original crystallization. However, it is likely that they formed as igneous rocks in a subduction-related island arc system. Subsequent or co- eval sedimentation added clastic deposits to the terrane. Where this happened is uncertain. It's possible that the terrane formed as a portion of Laurentia, then rifted off and was re-attached during a subsequent orogeny. Alternatively, it may have formed adjacent to a different Paleoproterozoic landmass (e.g., West Africa or Amazonia), then rifted off and collided with Laurentia. * 1.2 Ga - Metamorphic and magmatic event. Zircon analysis suggests that the MHT underwent a metamorphic event near 1.2 Ga, possibly related to the Grenville Orogeny that assembled the supercontinent Rodinia. This event brought the MHT rocks up to granulite facies. The event likely also emplaced large volumes of felsic and mafic igneous rocks in the MHT. * 730 Ma - Magmatic event. The MHT was intruded again by mafic magmas approximately 730 Ma, possibly as a result of Rodinia rifting. * 470 Ma - Metamorphic event, likely the Taconic Orogeny.  Mapping  The Mars Hill Terrane comprises several units, variously named: * Pumpkin Patch Metamorphic Suite / Fries Thrust Sheet  Northern high metamorphic grade portion of Mars Hill Terrane.

The mosque is located within the complex of Istana al-Mukarrammah, the main palace of the Sultanate of Sintang, a kingdom in Sintang which existed since the 13th-century. History The mosque was instrumental in the spread of Islam in Sintang. During the reign of Pangeran Agung, the 17th Raja of Sintang, Islam has become the official religion of the kingdom, replacing the former official religion of Hinduism. However, at that time, Sintang did not have a mosque. The learning of Islam was still held in the palace complex balai kerajaan. Pangeran Tunggal, the son of Pangeran Agung, decided to build a small-sized mosque with a capacity of 50 people. This small mosque is the forerunner of the Jami Mosque of Sintang. During the reign of Sultan Nata Muhammad Syamsudin (19th Sultan of Sintang, the first ruler to use sultan as his title), this small mosque was expanded to become the main mosque of the Sintang Sultanate. The mosque was inaugurated on Muharram 12, 1083 AH (corresponds to May 9, 1672). During the reign of Sultan Abdurrasyid Muhammad Jamaludin (21st Raja of Sintang), the mosque was renovated and expanded. The Jami Mosque of Sintang has become an official place of religious activities in the Sultanate of Sintang. During the reign of Raden Abdul Bahri Danu Perdana al-Mukaram (1935), two minarets were added to the left and right of the mosque. In 1987, the mosque was officially named Jami Mosque Sultan Nata Sintang after the founder of the mosque. Architecture The architecture of the Jami Mosque of Sintang was typical of the river region of West Kalimantan. The mosque is constructed out of the ulin or belian wood, a type of very good quality hardwood native to Borneo. The foundation, the frame of the buildings, the beams, the roof cover, and the floorboards were made of the belian wood. The mosque consists of three tiers of roofs; the first and the second lowest tier are pyramidals in shape, the third uppermost tier has an octagonal base. The two minarets flanking the mosque have a square base but topped with an octagonal room with an octagonal based conical roofs. The minaret on the right-side of the mosque is shorter than the one on the left. The wall of the mosque is painted white and green. The eight saka guru main posts in the center of the building are the only part that is never replaced or renewed. Myths surround the existence of these main posts.

Deborah Churchill was born in Norfolk to a respectable family in 1677. Her first marriage was with John Churchill, an Army Ensign who died of alcoholism. She had two children from him. Churchill cohabited with a Richard Hunt in London, became a prostitute and picked pockets of her own customers. Hunt extracted money from her wealthy clients by blackmailing them and whenever Churchill was arrested, he ensured her release by bribing officials. One account stated that she had been to the Clerkenwell Bridewell 28 times and was once sentenced to New Prison for the theft of 104 guineas. On another occasion, she received a large debt and to escape it duped a soldier into marrying her and on their wedding night escaped; her husband thus became responsible for her debt and she could not be prosecuted. In 1708, she was moving through Drury Lane closely followed by Hunt and his two friends, William Lewis and John Boy. She tried to pick a merchant Martin Were's pocket but he pushed her to the ground instead. Immediately the three men reached the spot and on Churchill's insistence stabbed Were. The three fled to Holland and only Churchill was apprehended. On 26 February 1708, she was ordered to be executed for being an accessory. However, to escape the sentence, Churchill falsely informed the court that she was pregnant. This delayed her execution by seven months. When the court came to know about her lie, it ordered for the sentence to be carried out immediately and she was executed in Tyburn on 17 December 1708 before a large audience whom she asked to pray for her. An entry on her is included in The Newgate Calendar.

She was known for her modesty, grace and decency. Life Marie Delaporte was born in Paris on 27 September 1838. Her parents were shopkeepers. She entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1853. She studied under Joseph Isidore Samson and obtained the first place in 1854. She made her debut at the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase in Paris on 6 May 1855 with the Mariage de Victorine, as Victorine. She was intelligent, cheerful and sentimental, and performed for 13 years at this theatre, with a piquant naivety, grace and decency. Her last role at the Gymnase was in the Roman d'une honn√™te Femme which opened on 16 November 1867. She played in works by George Sand, Eug√®ne Scribe, Alexandre Dumas fils, Octave Feuillet, Victorien Sardou and Th√©odore Barri√®re throughout the Second French Empire. In 1867 she co-starred with Madame Pasca (Alix-Marie-Ang√®le S√©on) in the play Les Id√©es de Madame Aubray by Dumas fils. In 1867 the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise offered Marie Delaporte the position of soci√©taire. She declined that but accepted the position of pensionnaire (paid actor). She fell ill and had to stay away from the stage for a year. She then received a magnificent offer from Russia of 55,000 francs per year with five months off. The director of the Gymnase released her from her contract. In Saint Petersburg Delaporte found her compatriots Dupais and Dieudonn√©. Marie Delaporte spent seven years at the Mikhailovsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg during that theatre's apogee. She was accepted by the society of that city, and by literary men such as Count Vladimir Sollogub. There is a story that at one time Madame Pasca was to play Mathilde in the Supplice d'une femme, but she was sick and unable to appear. Delaporte played the part in her place. She learned the part in three days, and performed it wonderfully. Marie Delaporte did not return to the Gymnase until 22 September 1874, when she created the role of Gilberle. After another year in Russia she returned to star at the boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle on 25 August 1875 in a reprise of Froufrou, a role that was originally created for Mme Descl√©e. In June 1876 Marie Delaporte was in London with M. Andrieu, and appeared in private performances of L'Autre Motif by √âdouard Pailleron and various pieces suitable for one or two performers. Her last appearances seem to have been at the Vaudeville from 23-30 December 1877 in Une S√©paration and on 1 March 1878 in the Bourgeois de Pont-Arcy. She later taught diction at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. She lived in Paris from 1884 to 1904.

Until then, there was no specific legislation regarding outsourcing, but decisions of the Labor Justice determined that outsourcing should only be allowed for secondary activities. In the Chamber of Deputies, the bill 4,302 of 1998 was approved on March 22 of that same year. The main proposal (outsourcing for primary activities) was kept. The bill also determined that, in cases of labor actions, the outsourced company ought to pay for the rights questioned in justice, if there is condemnation. The main vetoed part allowed the extension of the 270-day term of temporary employment.

It is situated in the Botevgrad valley in the western section of the Balkan Mountains. ‚ÄùMuhalnitsa‚Äù was established in 1992 to protect a unique breeding migration of the common frog (Rana temporaria).  History of the site On 14 February 1968 zoologist Vladimir Beshkov discovered several hundred common frogs (Rana temporaria) in a small swamp at an altitude of 360 m near the town of Botevgrad which was very unusual for this species at such a low altitude. On 1 March and 4 March 1971 he marked several hundred specimens and released them back into the swamp. On 4 June 1971 one of the marked frogs was found on the slopes of the Bilo mountain at a distance of 4925 m on a straight line from the swamp and at 875 m.a.s.l. After a hiatus of several years, Beshkov renewed his studies in 1979, when between 31 January and 3 March, 457 common frogs were marked in the swamp. Frogs were also marked while moving down the rivers in February and March 1980 at 5.5 and 6 km above the swamp, high in the Bilo mountain. On 11 March 1980 two of them were found in the ‚ÄúMuhalnitsa‚Äù swamp (one 4, the other 11 days after marking).

Roman digits indicate the months of the year. A pair of common frogs among deposited eggs in ‚ÄúMuhalnitsa‚Äù. In the height of the breeding season almost all of the water surface is covered with eggs. The mass arrival of thousands of frogs in the swamp in the area of ‚ÄúMuhalnitsa‚Äù has probably began in the end of the last glacial period, i.e. around 8000 years ago. During this annual breeding migration from their hibernation habitats (rivers and streams in the high parts of the mountain) to the ‚ÄúMuhalnitsa‚Äù swamp, the common frogs cover distances of up to 6 km, and some of them probably over 10 km. The breeding season lasts only about two weeks, usually in the end of February or the beginning of March, depending on ambient temperature. Pairs of breeding frogs and deposited eggs among the still melting ice is a common sight. The frogs move down the Zelin River and instinctively know when to leave it in order to reach the swamp. After the end of the breeding season, adult frogs return to the high parts of the mountain by land, covering approximately the same distances. Tadpoles hatch from the fertilized eggs, metamorphose into froglets and leave the swamp by the end of May and the beginning of June.–ë–µ—à–∫–æ–≤, –í., –ë. –ê–Ω–≥–µ–ª–æ–≤–∞. 1981. –ï–¥–Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–æ–±–∏–∫–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–º–Ω–æ–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª–Ω–∞ –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –≤–æ–¥–Ω–∞ –∂–∞–±–∞ (Rana temporaria L.). ‚Äì –ï–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è, 8: 34-42–ë–µ—à–∫–æ–≤ –í. 1988. –ù–∞–π-–≥–æ–ª—è–º–∞—Ç–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω–∞ –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –≤ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞ –∑–µ–º–Ω–æ–≤–æ–¥–Ω–∏—Ç–µ. ‚Äì –ü—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–∞, 37(1): 34-39 This breeding migration is unique for the species and is among the longest known migrations in the world of amphibians.Russell, A., Bauer, A., Johnson, K. 2005.

There is also a single registration of European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis).Lukanov, S. Unpublished data, 2012 This relatively rich biodiversity in a rather small area confirms the significance of protected area ‚ÄúMuhalnitsa‚Äù for the conservation of the local fauna.  Threats and counter-measures In the last 10 years there is a marked increase in the swamp size as well as overgrowing with bulrush (Typha sp.). This is due to a prolonged leakage from the pipes of the local water and sanitation facility and has a pronounced negative effect on the frogs, which need open water in order to breed. This leakage has probably influenced the water regime of the swamp, changing it from a temporary pond into a permanent one (with better conditions for the bulrush). The progressive growth of the bulrush will probably lead to another change, with the entire swamp drying off. This would mean that in the following years the local common frog population will lose its main breeding site, and the unique migration will cease. This threat would also affect all other amphibian and reptile species in the protected area. Another significant threat to the frogs is the mass mortality on the asphalt road running along the north- eastern bank of the swamp. Migrating frogs that come from the river must cross the road to reach the swamp (except the few individuals that pass through the drainage pipe under the road). Vehicle traffic is not intensive, but nevertheless during the breeding season, the road is covered with ran-over dead frogs. In 2017 the municipality of Botevgrad, together with zoologists from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, undertook a series of measures aimed at overcoming these threats by uprooting the bulrush and safe-proofing the road with animal passage pipes.

With the following years, the Andorran honours system was expanded in 2011 by the Inter-Parish Commission with the creation of the medals and awards for the City Guards of the country, adopted by Decree by all the Parishes. This system, with many mistakes committed during its application, was reformed by the Andorran phalerist Adri√† Espineta Arias through a technical report that was implemented in 2015 and changed the protocol and designs of most of the awards.

It was first described by the Scottish neurologist John Alexander Simpson. Procedure In myaesthenia gravis, there is a variable weakness of skeletal muscles, which is exacerbated by repeated contraction. To cause sustained contraction of levator palpebrae superioris muscle, the patient is asked to gaze upward for an extended period of time, without lifting the head. After a few minutes, the patient with myasthenia gravis starts to show drooping of upper eyelids, while normal individuals do not show any drooping.http://www.lipteh.com/Study-Notes/Eyelids/myasthenia- clinical%20eye%20signs.pdf Thus, this test can be used to clinically differentiate between ocular myasthenia gravis and normal individuals. Since myasthenia gravis affects all skeletal muscles, eyelid drooping is often bilateral. It is sometimes done in conjunction with tensilon test, where edrophonium is injected to look for reversibility of eyelid drooping. In myaesthenia gravis, eyelid drooping is no longer detectable after tensilon test. This test is less sensitive than anti-AChR antibody titers and electromyography, and hence is used only as a screening test in clinical setup.

Completed in 1934, the structure is part of Rockefeller Center, and was built in the Art Deco style. Construction Fifth Avenue facade The building was part of the original construction of the Rockefeller Center, with an oval- shaped retail building originally planned for the block. The oval building was scrapped in early 1931, and an updated plan proposed a tall 41-story tower and two smaller 6-story retail buildings on the site of the oval building. Because the canceled oval building had contained rooftop gardens, Raymond Hood suggested the idea for rooftop gardens across the complex, including on all of the retail buildings. These gardens would be curated by Ralph Hancock. As American tenants were reluctant to rent in these retail buildings, Rockefeller Center's manager Hugh Robertson, formerly of Todd, Robertson and Todd, suggested foreign tenants for the buildings. French tenants agreed to occupy the building in February 1932. This made La Maison Francaise the second themed building to be agreed on, after the British Empire Building to its north. Description La Maison Francaise is the southernmost of five buildings in Rockefeller Center's International Complex. It is located south of its architectural twin, the British Empire Building. The other three buildings in the International Complex are the International Building, Palazzo d'Italia, and International Building North, located one block north. It is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback, as well as a partial -story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof. France's economy was relatively stable at the time of the building's construction, but French prime minister Herriot praised Rockefeller Center building as embodying \\"prosperity, freedom and peace of the world\\". La Maison Francaise contains ground-level storefronts on all four sides and a cornerstone inscribed with the building's name. The Channel, a , planted pedestrian esplanade, separates the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise. The building's art was mostly designed by artists designing in the French architectural style. Alfred Janniot's bronze engraving above the entrance depicts personifications of France and New York holding hands above the ocean and the heads of the personifications of poetry, beauty, and elegance. Above this bronze engraving, Janniot also sculpted a cartouche of a female personification of French freedom, proclaiming \\"Libert√©, Egalit√©, Fraternit√©\\" (Liberty, Equality, Fraternity). In 1934, Rene Chambellan created four bronze bas-reliefs on the sixth floor, which symbolize historical eras of France: Charlemagne's Empire, New France, Louis XIV's Absolute Monarchy, and the French Republic. The one non-French artist was Lee Lawrie, who decorated the secondary entrances with scalloped and triangle-patterned lintels, gold-covered fleurs-de-lis, and a woman wearing a Phrygian cap. The building's lobby also contains a model airplane created by Cartier & Co, which signifies the transatlantic flight that Dieudonn√© Costes and Maurice Bellonte made from France to New York in 1930. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission added landmark status to the exteriors of all the original Rockefeller Center's buildings in 1985. In its approval of the complex's status, the commission wrote, \\"Rockefeller Center ranks among the grandest architectural projects ever undertaken in the United States\\". The roof gardens of the wings were restored in 1986 for $48,000 each.

The leisure park with a total area of approximately 100,000 square meters is centered around an artificial lake. Lago Marti√°nez includes several islands, gardens, restaurants, bars, and terraces. Architect C√©sar Manrique designed the swimming pool complex with many volcanic rocks. Lago Marti√°nez is a mix of Manrique‚Äôs vision and local elements, such as bartizans, palisades and ocean views. In addition to the architectural structure, it also comprises a range of Manrique‚Äôs sculptures. Lago Marti√°nez, commonly known as \\"el Lago\\", was built in the so-called \\"Llanos de Marti√°nez\\" area, which was home to several natural pools (such as \\"la Coronela\\" and \\"la Soga\\"). The first tourists visited Llanos de Marti√°nez at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century.  First stage  Lago Marti√°nez children's pool The project‚Äôs first stage involved the area of the municipal pools, formerly known as \\"los Alisios\\". Engineer Juan Alfredo was responsible for the technical aspects, while C√©sar Manrique was in charge of the creative and artistic elements. Manrique combined his architectural spirit with the traditional architecture of the Canary Islands, incorporating flora and fauna elements, alongside authentic and innovative sculptures. ‚ÄòLos Alisios‚Äô and \\"la Jibia\\" (cuttlefish) are two examples of such sculptures. Lago Marti√°nez was inaugurated in 1971, when its total area covered 8,000 square meters, and included two adult swimming pools, one children‚Äôs pool, and two bars (‚Äòlos Alisios‚Äô and ‚Äòla Isla‚Äô). The leisure park is equipped with technical- mechanical installations that are used for multiple purposes, such as filling the pools with sea water. Those facilities are incorporated in accordance with Lago Marti√°nez‚Äô artistic character.  Second stage  Lago Marti√°nez artificial lake After completion of the first stage, the same technical and artistic team continued with the next phase in 1975, which ended on 30 April 1977. The second stage included construction of an artificial lake, shaped like a huge, green emerald, filled with sea water and surrounded by beaches, gardens and solariums. The artificial lake and its islands cover 33,000 square meters, including 15,000 square meters of water.  Renovation and improvements  Between 2004 and 2006, Lago Marti√°nez underwent extensive renovations and improvements, including illumination of the pools and promenades. The Fundaci√≥n C√©sar Manrique, which protects the artist‚Äôs works, supervised the works. The renewed park was inaugurated in July 2006.

Her first book was a popularization of mineralogy for a general audience, but her two later books were more technically oriented. Life and work Delvalle Eliza Rebekah Lowry was born on 22 September 1800 in London, England, to the engraver Wilson Lowry, FRS, and his second wife, Rebekah Delvalle, a mineralogist and scientific lecturer. She was educated at home, growing up exposed to her parents' circle of artistic and scientific friends, such as John Henry Heuland, William Phillips, John Mawe, and Charles Konig, to name just those mentioned in the acknowledgements of her first book, Conversations on Mineralogy, published in 1822. Lowry and her father engraved the illustrations for the book from original sketches. Presented in the popular format of a conversation between two (female) students and their instructor, the book was generally well received and went through three editions in Britain and an American edition. Lowry appears to have been mostly concerned with conveying her information clearly to those with a bare knowledge of mineralogy and her prose has been criticized for its stilted dialog and lack of character development. It was notable, however, for avoiding any religious references common at that time.Larsen, pp. 107, 112‚Äì13, 116‚Äì17 Lowry married the much older painter and astrologist John Varley in 1825 and they did not have any children. Varley was spendthrift by nature and had very little business sense; he died of a kidney infection hiding from his creditors in 1842. She was awarded a pension from the Royal Academy after his death. Lowry subsequently published two books using her married name, The Engineer‚Äôs Manual of Mineralogy and Geology in 1846 and Rudimentary Geology in 1848. The Engineer's Manual was intended for professionals in the field and Rudimentary Geology was published by John Weale in his 'Rudimentary Series' of scientific books. It went through at least four editions, the last two of which were entitled Rudimentary Treatise on Mineralogy and included a section by the American geologist James Dana.

Background The long- standing national Militia of the United Kingdom was revived by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Litchfield, pp. 1‚Äì7.Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 27‚Äì8.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. The 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. History The unit was raised in Kent in May 1853 with six batteries under the title of Kent Militia Artillery with headquarters at Dover. The colonel was John Townshend, 3rd Viscount Sydney and the first commandant was Lieutenant-Colonel John Farnaby Cator, a Half-pay Captain in the RA, who later changed his surname to Lennard and was created a Baronet. Several of the other early officers were half-pay or retired officers of the Royal Engineers or Brigade of Guards or were prominent personages in Kent, including Major the Hon. Charles Stewart Hardinge, MP, son of the Commander- in-Chief.Litchfield, pp. 102‚Äì4.Hart's Army List, 1855.Army List, various dates.Burke's, Hardinge', 'Lennard', 'Townshend'. Captain Walter G. Stirling, RA, (later 3rd Baronet Stirling, was appointed Lt-Col on 24 April 1876, having been the major since 5 December 1871. The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 divisions of garrison artillery in 1882, and the Antrim unit became the 2nd Brigade, Cinque Ports Division, RA. When the Cinque Ports Division was abolished in 1889 the title was altered to Kent Artillery (Eastern Division) RA.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63‚Äì4. From 1902 most units of the Militia artillery formally became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery, the Dover unit taking the title of 'Kent RGA (M). Embodiments The unit was embodied for home defence twice: * Crimean War: 3 January 1855 to 10 June 1856 * Second Boer War: 3 May to 13 October 1900 Although the Kent Artillery volunteered for overseas service during the Boer War, this offer was not accepted. However, two officers of the regiment did serve as individuals, and both were Mentioned in dispatches: Capt C.E. Schlesinger was attached to 8th Division Ammunition Column,Lord Roberts' dispatch of 4 September London Gazette, 10 September 1901. and Capt R. De B. Hassell was attached to the Remount Department. On 8 December 1900 he was in charge of a train of remounts that was derailed and shelled between Kokomere and Klerkensdorp. Hassell personally uncoupled the engine and sent it for help while he and 11 others held off 100 attackers and saved the train. Disbandment After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. Some batteries of Militia Artillery were to be converted to field artillery. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131‚Äì40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243‚Äì2, 254. Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi-professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime. Although the majority of the officers and men of the Kent RGA (M) accepted transfer to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery, all these units were disbanded in March 1909.Dunlop, pp. 270‚Äì2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275‚Äì7.Litchfield, Appendix 8. Uniform and insignia In 1853 the officers of the Kent Militia Artillery wore badges that were unique to the unit. Their black leather helmet carried a plate consisting of an ornate silver shield surmounted by a crown. The shield bore a gilt grenade, on the ball of which was the Royal 'VR' Cypher. Below the grenade were crossed gilt cannons. A separate silver scroll beneath the plate was inscribed 'KENT'. The officers' black leather pouch belt bore a white metal plate comprising a simple shield with the White horse of Kent stamped in the centre. Below the shield was a scroll inscribed with the Kent motto 'INVICTA', and either side of the shield was a spray of leaves. After 1882 the officers wore the standard gilt Cinque Ports Division helmet plate. An 1896 photographs shows that the Kent was one of the few artillery militia corps to issue all ranks with the standard British Army blue cloth helmet of the period. Colonels * John Townshend, 3rd Viscount Sydney, later 1st Earl Sydney, was appointed Colonel of the Regiment on 4 May 1853 and held the position until his death in 1890. * Sir William Stirling, 3rd Bt, former CO, was appointed Honorary Colonel on 8 March 1890 and held the post until its disbandment.

She was one of the group of researchers known as \\"the magnificent seven of (Mexican) anthropology\\". She was awarded the Ignacio Manuel Altamirano Medal as well as the National Prize for Arts and Sciences for her work in history and philosophy. Early life Mar√≠a Margarita Nolasco Armas was born on 20 November 1932 in Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico to Margarita Armas Hern√°ndez, a Canary Islander and Ricardo Nolasco Aguilar, from Veracruz. In her childhood, her family relocated to Mexico City. In high school, she met Carlos Melesio and the two dreamed of becoming medical doctors. They married when Nolasco was seventeen and after the trauma of working with burn victims, she changed her course of study to anthropology. Enrolling in the National School of Anthropology and History () in 1957, she studied under Barbro Dahigren. She graduated with a degree as an ethnologist from ENAH and went on to earn a master's degree and PhD in anthropology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Career Nolasco began her career working at the National Museum of Anthropology in the old building located at #13 Calle de Moneda, as a cataloger and was quickly promoted to a research position at Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (INAH), working her way up the ladder to become the Director of the graduate and post-graduate studies of anthropology at INAH. Throughout her career, besides teaching at ENAH, Nolasco taught at UNAM, the Universidad Iberoamericana Ciudad de M√©xico, the University of California, San Diego, and the Complutense University of Madrid. She was awarded the Ignacio Manuel Altamirano Medal from the Secretariat of Public Education in 2000 for her instruction career. One of Nolasco's first publications was a thorough analysis of land tenure in San Juan Teotihuac√°n, in Edomex, which she released in 1961. She evaluated the claims of rural agricultural workers and their demands for their land rights to be protected. She was a participant in the aftermath of the student movement known as Mexico 68, going from building to building in search of her son, Juan Carlos. Nolasco focused her studies on peoples which had been little researched before in Mexico, including the Tohono O'odham and Pima and other northern border communities. Nolasco also performed investigations on southern border migrations, working with researchers in Guatemala and Belize. She traveled the country to examine migration patterns of indigenous peoples in Guatemala and expanded her research to include agricultural workers. One of her most noted works, explored coffee production in Mexico. Caf√© y sociedad en M√©xico (Coffee and Society in Mexico, 1985), published with a group of researchers she led, is the most complete study of the topic and classically evaluated the production and environmental impact, as well as the socio-economic impact of coffee as an agricultural product of Mexico. Nolasco belonged to a group of anthropologists collectively known as Los siete magn√≠ficos de la anthropolog√≠a (The magnificent seven of anthropology), which included besides herself: Guillermo Bonfil Batalla, Mercedes Olivera Bustamante, , Rodolfo Stavenhagen, Enrique Valencia, and Arturo Warman. They were the first group working in Mexico to focus their attention away from the assimilated national identity of the varied peoples in the country and instead critically evaluate the differences of the cultures that made up the whole. Rather than evaluate a homogeneous Mestizo population, as had been done in the past, this group of researchers pioneered evaluating the cultural contributions of indigenous people and led the way for recognition of the value of indigenous cultures, but also questioning colonialism from the impact on the conquered communities, rather than as a glorification of colonial expansion. Her research specialties focused on ethnography and migration, analyzing the political and human rights issues impacting indigenous peoples and throughout her career published more than 100 articles on these topics. Nolasco was a founder of the new facility for the National Museum of Anthropology and served as curator of the Ethnography Room of that facility. Nolasco was an honorary member of the Mexican Society of Geography and Statistics and a member of the Mexican Anthropology Society and Mexican Academy of Sciences. Between 2004 and 2006, she served as president of the Mexican Academy of Anthropological Sciences and was a founder of the College of Ethnologists and Social Anthropologists, the governing board of professionals working in the field. Death and legacy Nolasco died unexpectedly on 23 September 2008 in Mexico City. She had numerous project which had not yet been completed. That same year, she won the National Prize for Arts and Sciences for her work in history and philosophy, but died before its presentation. She was posthumously honored with the award and was honored in Queretaro with an altar during the Day of the Dead remembrances.

Built in 1907, it was the principal manufacturing facility of the Royal Typewriter Company, a major local employer, until 1972. Most of the building was destroyed by fire in 1992; the remainder was subsequently razed and the site now houses a shopping center, where a commemorative plaque is located. The building, which was one of the city's largest examples of late 19th-century mill construction, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The site of the Royal Typewriter factory was on the east side of New Park Avenue, roughly between Kane Street and Francis Avenue. It consisted of a long axis running parallel to the road, from which seven broad pavilions projected toward the road. Despite its 20th-century construction dates, the building was built using 19th-century mill construction methods, including load-bearing brick walls. Stylistically the building was an eclectic mix of Victorian elements, including Gothic crenellations and elaborately decorated towers. Commemorative plaque at the site A Royal typewriter on display at the pharmacy of the Stop & Shop that now sits on the factory's site. A sign honoring the company. The oldest portion of the building, its northeastern end, was built in 1907, and the structure gradually grew, achieving its largest size around 1947. At its height, it was the centerpiece of Hartford's leading role in the global production of typewriters, along with the competing Underwood Typewriter Company. Royal Typewriter was founded in Brooklyn, New York in 1906, but rapidly outgrew a small facility there. Charles Cook acquired a controlling interest in the company, and was instrumental in the relocation of its manufacturing operations to Hartford in 1909. After a series of corporate mergers, the Hartford production facility was closed down in 1972. Various efforts to adapt the complex to other uses failed over the following years, and about two-thirds of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1992. The surviving remnants of the factory were subsequently demolished, and a supermarket was put up in its place.

Life Frye was born in North Kensington. Her father, Frederick Frye, was a businessperson and, in time, a member of parliament and her mother was Jane Kezia Frye (born Crosbie). Katherine was born above one of her father's Leverett & Frye grocer shops. By the time she was eight, she had started a diary which she would continue for the next seventy years. In 1892 her father was elected to parliament and he also became the sole owner of Leverett & Frye. Her father's achievements were recorded in the fourteen year old Katherine's diary.Elizabeth Crawford, ‚ÄòFrye , Katharine Parry (1878‚Äì1959)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2014 accessed 21 Nov 2017 In 1902 she attended the Shakespearean actor Ben Greet's Acting Academy where she learnt about the stage. She had been trained by governesses which she later realised was an inadequate education. She obtained work in the play Quality Street by J.M.Barrie which was touring England and Ireland. She learnt how to fend for herself, how to speak to a crowd and that acting was a poorly paid profession. She did however meet John Robert Collins and they started a long engagement. She joined the London Society for Women's Suffrage and the Actresses' Franchise League. The latter supplied art work and posters that supported the suffrage causes using volunteer artists. Frye continued her diary and lead a life of ease until 1911. In that year her family faced financial problems. In 1912 their home and all its contents were auctioned. Katharine's diary records the changes that became essential given her lack of money and she blamed her father for their misfortune. I In 1911 she took a paid job with the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage as an organiser. She toured south east England using her skills to find new recruits. Frye's diaries are particularly useful as she would attend the big suffrage events. She campaigned for George Lansbury when he resigned his seat in parliament in 1912 to create a bi-election. He wanted to confirm that the voters really did want women to have the vote. He lost by 700 votes. Frye's diary gave a report of the Emily Wilding Davison's funeral noting the matching outfits and the special pallbearers. Davison had given her life when she was trampled to death by a horse during a protest at the Derby. In 1914 Frye was secretary of the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage and with the outbreak of war the charity redirected their efforts to helping women rather than campaigning. By 1915 her fiance was no longer an actor but a soldier. Moreover he was now a captain in the Royal Garrison Artillery and he could afford to have a wife. They married on 9 January. In the 1930 Frye returned briefly to acting when she appeared in a walk on part under her stage name of Katherine Parry. Frye was continuing to write, but she only had one play published in 1920. Her writing was heard later during the second world war when their amateur productions in their garden theatre at Berghers Hill in Buckinghamshire raised funds for charity. Death and legacy Frye died in Beaconsfield in 1959. Frye's diaries were discovered by a writer and book dealer, Elizabeth Crawford, who decided to edit rather than sell the diaries. She created a book from the part of Frye's diaries that cover the period of 1911 to 1915. Works * Cease Fire!

A former model and actor, he made a significant amount of money running and selling the data service company Gopher Courier. He became involved in politics after the election of Evan Mecham as Governor of Arizona in 1986; Buck, an Arizona native, led the effort to recall him from office due to Mecham's perceived racism and corruption, which ended in Mecham's impeachment by the Arizona Senate in 1988 on the basis of various charges, including misusing government funds, before a recall election could occur. The experience led Buck to change his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat, and he has since donated heavily to Democratic politicians. In 2007, he ran an unsuccessful campaign for the city council of West Hollywood, California. Two African-American men have been discovered dead in Buck's West Hollywood home since 2017 due to drug overdoses. Several reports indicated that Buck had a history of bringing African-American men to his house, where he would reportedly inject them with crystal methamphetamine for sexual gratification. In January 2019, a coalition of 50 civil rights organizations called for law enforcement to investigate the matter. On September 17, 2019, Buck was arrested and charged with three counts of battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house.

He announced the campaign on December 21, 1986, before Mecham had even been sworn in, and was the \\"leader\\" of a protest on the day of Mecham's inauguration. In particular, Buck highlighted Mecham's \\"opposition to a King holiday, his proposal for voluntary drug testing and his plan to reduce the state police force by up to 300 officers\\". Buck distributed bumper stickers that read \\"Mecham for Ex- Governor\\", and Arizona Attorney General Robert K. Corbin ruled that state employees were allowed to use them on their cars. The anti-Mecham campaign \\"made Buck a household name in Arizona\\" according to The Arizona Republic. In retaliation, Buck was attacked by Julian Sanders, the chairman of Arizonans for Traditional Family Values, over his homosexuality. Buck switched his registration from Republican to Democrat because of homophobia in 1988. After moving to West Hollywood, California, Buck ran unsuccessfully for city council in 2007. He formerly served on the steering committee of the Stonewall Democratic Club. He has donated more than a total of $500,000 to political candidates and causes, almost all of them linked to the Democratic Party, including contributions to candidates like Hillary Clinton, Ted Lieu, Pete Aguilar, Adam B. Schiff, and Raja Krishnamoorthi as well as the Getting Things Done PAC. Criminal investigations On July 27, 2017, a young African- American man named Gemmel Moore died in Buck's apartment. Paramedics found Moore, who had worked as an escort, naked on a mattress in the living room with a \\"male pornography movie playing on the television\\", according to a Los Angeles County coroner's report. A spokesman for the coroner's office, Ed Winter, said Buck was inside his Laurel Avenue home at the time of Moore's death and that drug paraphernalia was recovered from the scene. Police found sex toys, syringes, and \\"clear plastic bags with suspected methamphetamine in a tool box roll-cabinet in the living room\\", 24 syringes with brown residue, five glass pipes with white residue and burn marks, a plastic straw with possible white residue, clear plastic bags with white powdery residue, and a clear plastic bag with a \\"piece of crystal-like substance\\". The death was investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and District Attorney Jackie Lacey declined to charge Buck on July 26, 2018. Since the death of Gemmel Moore, multiple reports have indicated that Buck had a history of luring young, black gay men to his apartment, where he would inject them with crystal methamphetamine for sexual gratification. Jasmyne Cannick, a local writer, activist, and political candidate who investigated Gemmel Moore's death, predicted on Twitter on July 28, 2018, that any further deaths at Ed's residence would be the responsibility of the Los Angeles County District Attorney, Jackie Lacey, for failing to bring charges. On January 7, 2019, another African-American man, 55-year-old Timothy Michael Dean (known professionally as Hole HunterMan Who Died in Buck's Home ID'd: Retail Worker, Adult Film ActorThe Story Behind the Man Found Dead in Ed Buck's Laurel Avenue Apartment - WEHOville), died at Buck's home. Following Dean's death, a coalition of 50 civil rights organizations released a statement calling on local law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation of Buck's role in the incident and calling on elected officials to return all contributions received from Buck. Buck was arrested on September 17, 2019, and charged with three counts of battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney‚Äôs office. He is accused of having injected a 37-year-old man, who overdosed but survived, with methamphetamine on September 11. On September 19, 2019, a federal charge of \\"one count of distribution of methamphetamine resulting in death\\" was added by the United States for the death of Gemmel Moore who died on July 27, 2017. That death had originally been ruled an accidental methamphetamine overdose by the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner. On August 4, 2020, a federal grand jury charged Buck with four additional felonies, bringing the total number of federal charges to nine counts. Buck is currently scheduled to go to trial on January 19, 2021. Personal life Buck came out to his parents as gay at the age of 16. He changed his surname from Buckmelter to Buck in 1981 or 1983. He was the Grand Marshal of the 1989 International Gay Rodeo. Buck formerly lived near Piestewa Peak in Phoenix, Arizona. He has lived in West Hollywood, California, since 1991.

Built between 1877 and 1878, it is a significant early work of the American architect J. Cleaveland Cady, also known for designing several buildings of great repute in the late 19th century, including sections of New York's Museum of Natural History and the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in November, 1985. Description and history Saint Anthony Hall is located on Gallows Hill, topographically the highest elevation Hartford, just north of the Trinity College campus, on the corner of Summit Avenue and Allen Place. It is a two-story French Gothic Revival building finished with a facade made of quarried New Hampshire granite laid in random courses. Externally, it appears to be rectangular structure with a rounded apse at one end and a steeply pitched hip roof. Prominent features include round towers, one tall and the other short, at two corners of the building, each topped by a conical roof with flared eave. On one long side a gabled section projects, with a pair of arched stained glass windows surmounted by a round window, also of stained glass. Trinity College's Delta Psi, known as the Epsilon chapter within the fraternity, was founded on October 17, 1850. Its members have played significant roles throughout the college's history. The chapter house was built between 1877-1878 to a design by architect J. Cleaveland Cady, himself was a Trinity College graduate, class of 1860, and a Delta Psi member. The building was completed at a cost of $68,00, $40,000 of which was donated by Robert Habersham Coleman, an 1877 Trinity graduate and Delta Psi fraternity member, the son of a wealthy industrialist who would one day become, albeit briefly, the wealthiest man in the United States. Other fraternity members donated as well toward construction and land acquisition, and the building was completed free of debt. Historical Characteristics At the time of its construction, the Delta Psi fraternity was present in several prominent colleges and universities such as Columbia University (where it was founded in 1847), University of Pennsylvania, University of Virginia, and Yale University. In 1879, Baird's Manual (see Wikisource, the free library of source texts), contained an extensive Delta Psi/St. Anthony Hall chapter list. Baird's characterized the organization at that time as having \\"the reputation of being the most secret of all the college societies.\\" However, Cady's design for the building at Trinity was a departure from many collegiate secret society buildings of the time, particularly the ones at Yale; its large windows, both front and back, as well as its prominent oak front doors with carved glyphs were seen as a welcoming feature, yet its imposing architecture did not fail to communicate a strong element of secretiveness that continued to mark the character of the organization. The Epsilon Chapter House is the first building constructed in the United States for the sole purpose of being a college fraternity house. Furthermore, it continues to serve strictly as a meeting hall with no dormitories or sleeping facilities, a characteristic of secret societies. Prominent features include an ample foyer at the entrance, an octagonal living room, a library which at the time of the house's construction served as the fraternity dining room, and recreational facilities in the basement, including a pool table room, a bar room, and a reception area. Today, it is the oldest of the Saint Anthony Hall fraternity's houses still in use. Renovation and Addition in 2003 With the 2001 inspection failure of an external metal fire-escape that had been grandfathered in by the City of Hartford years before, alumni members led a campaign to bring the building's fire exit door into compliance through the addition of a smaller second tower on the left rear side of the building. A fundraising campaign was launched to complete the structure within a year. Careful measures had to be taken to harmonize this addition with the rest of the building, so a design was chosen that would blend harmoniously with the tower. The granite on the exterior of the addition came from the same New Hampshire quarry that provided the exterior for the original building. Precautions were taken to improve the entrance and exit into the basement area, as well as convert the old hatch door fire escape into a full size door. The new addition was inaugurated in 2003.

History The Association for the Study of Play emerged from a meeting of scholars of play held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on April 14, 1973. The meeting was organized and chaired by Alyce Taylor Cheska (1921-2012), who was Head of the Department of Women's Physical Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (then the University of Illinois) and an affiliate professor in the Department of Anthropology. The scholars who met there formed the Cultural Anthropology of Play Reprint Society. The next year, Michael Salter organized the first formal meeting of the new organization at the University of Western Ontario during the North American Society for Sport History (NASSH) convention. Participants renamed the organization \\"The Association for the Anthropological Study of Play\\" and elected B. Allan Tindall as president. In 1987, the organization changed its name to The Association for the Study of Play (TASP). The proceedings of the Association's first conference were published in The Anthropological study of play : problems and prospects, a collection edited by edited by David F. Lancy and B.

Life and works Rosina Zornlin was born on 6 December 1795 in Walthamstow, Essex, England to a literary family. Her father was John Jacob Zornlin, a London merchant of Swiss background. Her mother, Elizabeth Alsager, was the sister of Thomas Massa Alsager and had published some poetry. Her sister, Georgiana Zornlin, was an author and an artist. An invalid, Rosina spent most of her life living with her family in Clapham, Surrey. She was involved with the Clapham Microscopical Society. An amateur astronomer, she published two articles in The Philosophical Magazine on meteor showers in 1839 and 1841 and was interested enough in physics to have a paper read to the British Association for the Advancement of Science entitled On Heat and on the Indestructibility of Elementary Bodies in 1858. Zornlin also published two non-fiction books on the Bible narrative and an anti-Catholic novel entitled, The Roman Catholic Chapel, or, Lindenhurst Parish in 1837.Larsen, p. 178 Many of her earlier works, such as What Is a Comet, Papa? (1835, James Ridgway & Sons), The Solar Eclipse (1836, James Ridgway & Sons), and What Is a Voltaic Battery? (1842, John Parker), were written for children. In order to make scientific ideas accessible to this younger audience, Zornlin adopted the ‚Äòfamiliar format‚Äô, a fictional literary format that used letters, dialogues, and conversations, customarily situated in a domestic setting. Zornlin's earliest scientific books took advantage of astronomical phenomena like the 1835 approach of Halley's Comet and the 1836 solar eclipse visible in England. One reviewer criticized Zornlin because she \\"unconsciously takes for granted that the pupil is [already] familiar with the phenomena which she undertakes to explain.\\"Dr. Charles Morgan, quoted in Larsen, p. 180 Zornlin's other scientific books used a clear, textbook style of prose.Larsen, p. 180 Zornlin's other books were geared towards adults and to school use. Several of them sold well enough to go into multiple editions, including Recreations in Geology, The World of Waters, Recreations in Physical Geography. All of them reached third editions. Her first book on geology, Recreations in Geology, was published in 1839 and she was heavily influenced by the Natural Theology of William Paley.  The Voltaic Battery  One of Rosina Zornlin's very well known work is her writing What is the Voltaic Battery? which was honored in the British Periodicals in 1842. Rosina's writing sets her apart from many because she used different styles, like in What is the Voltaic Battery _?_ she writes in a dialogue between two people. One person (E) asks Mr. C various questions about a voltaic battery including how it works, what its made of, and how much power it can generate. She helped educate people about the voltaic battery by including questions often thought of about the voltaic battery.  Continued Works of Rosina Zornlin  Rosina Zornlin wrote many popular books including The World of Waters and The Earth as It Is in which she compares the earth before and after mankind. Rosina Zornlin initially wrote for juvenile readers but eventually wrote more works for adult audiences ranging in many different scientific topics often using dialogues to explain the subject she was writing about. Her style of writing became very popular among many different groups of people, giving them an entertaining way to learn about geology and various other physical sciences.

It was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. At the time of its nomination it contained 21 resources, which included three contributing buildings, one contributing site, five structures, seven non-contributing buildings, and five non-contributing structures. It contains of land along the Winnebago River. The park features picnic areas, a 9-hole disc golf course, three tennis courts, volleyball court, basketball courts, fishing, a sledding hill, playgrounds including the Prairie Playground, a hard surface trail system, a band shell and a gazebo. History East Park was established in 1909 as the second recreational park in Mason City. Its original were designed by Des Moines landscape architect Frank E. Pease. He laid out the park's curvilinear street system (contributing structure), which emphasizes its landscape of flat prairie and rolling hills. Pease is also responsible for designing the park's water system (contributing structure), which includes Willow Creek and a duck pond created in a marshy area on the east side of the park. In 1937 the Works Progress Administration (WPA) added concrete edges to Willow Creek and concrete spillways to control and contain the water during floods. The size of the park expanded over the years until it reached its current 57.6 acres in 1957. The East Park Band Shell (1924), which is individually listed on the National Register, is located near the center of the park. Other park amenities that contribute to the historic nature of the park include the two picnic shelters, Shelter #1 (WPA; 1937) and Shelter #4 (1965), tennis courts (WPA; 1937), a stone footbridge (WPA; c. 1937), and the Parks Department maintenance building (1956). The tennis courts were part of Pease's original plan but were not added until later. There is also a Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway steam engine (1912) that was placed in the park near the railroad tracks in 1957. The non-contributing resources are park amenities that were built, or significantly altered, between 1970 and about 2000.

Biography  Liu was born in Yueyang, Hunan in 1871. From 1904 to 1907 he served as the Tarbagatay prefect. He was then appointed the prefect of √úr√ºmqi, where he served between 1907 and 1910. After that, he served as the prefect of Yarkant. The same year he was accused of corruption. Liu served as a commissioner for education under Governor Jin Shuren. In April 1931, before the Kumul Rebellion fully escalated, Liu, along with Yen Yu-Shan, the commissioner for reconstruction, advised Jin the policy of conciliation. However, Jin, overestimating his military power, ordered his troops to deal with the rebelling Muslims. In December 1932, Ma Zhongying's forces of started the sieg of √úr√ºmqi, but the White Russians and Sheng Shicai's troops successfully defended the city. In March 1933, the Manchurian Salvation Army, part of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA), came to their aid through the Soviet territory. During these events, Jin's prestige declined and correspondingly Sheng became increasingly popular. The culmination was the coup staged by the White Russians and a group of the provincial bureaucrats led by Chen Zhong, Tao Mingyue and Li Xiaotian on 12 April 1933, who overthrew Jin, who escaped to China proper via Siberia. Without conferring the Central government, the coup leaders appointed Sheng the Commissioner of the Sinkiang Border Defence, i. e., Military Governor or duban on 14 April 1933, resurrecting the old title. Liu, a powerless provincial bureaucrat was installed the Civil Governor. Without clearly stating whether it recognises the changes in Sinkiang, the government appointed Huang Musong, then a Deputy Chief of General Staff, a \\"pacification commissioner\\" in May 1933. He arrived in √úr√ºmqi on 10 June. Sheng expected that the Central government would recognise him as duban, and that Huang's visit would affect that decision. Huang was ignorant of the frontier problems and his arrogant behavior offended some of the provincial leaders. The rumors spread that Huang was already named a new governor or that Chiang Kai-Shek decided to split Sinkiang into several smaller provinces. However, the true Huang's task was to secure the cooperation between the coup leaders and establish a new provincial mechanism with pro-Nanking stance. Sheng exploited the rumors, and charged that Huang, an agent of Wang Jingwei had plotted with Liu, Zhang and Ma to overthrow the provincial government. On 26 June Huang was placed under house arrest, and the three coup leaders were also arrested and immediately executed. Huang recommended the Central government to recognise Liu as Civil Governor and Sheng as a duban. After the Central government apologised and promised the recognition, Huang was allowed to return to Nanking three weeks after the arrest. Liu was finally confirmed into office on 1 August 1933. Shortly afterwards, in August Chiang sent Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, as a sign of good will, to preside over Sheng's inauguration ceremony as a Commissioner of the Sinkiang Border Defence. However, at the same time, the Central government used Luo's visit to contact the two of Sheng's rivals, Ma in Turpan and Zhang in Yining. They were encouraged to launch an attack against Sheng. As soon as Luo left the province, the war broke out between Sheng on one side, and Ma and Zhang on the other. Sheng accused Luo not only for plotting, but also for an assassination attempt. Luo's left Sinkiang in early October. In September 1933, Sheng accused Liu of plotting with Ma and Zhang through Luo with Nanking in order to overthrow him. He was forced to resign and was replaced by Zhu Ruichi, a more controllable official.

Although Agnes was never styled as Queen consort, she became politically influential. Following the death of Robert, King of Naples in 1343, she organised a marriage for her eldest son to Robert's granddaughter, who was second-in-line to the Neapolitan throne. Agnes's ambition was to bring her family closer to the line of succession. Early life and marriage Agnes was born into the French nobility, a daughter of Helie VII, Count of P√©rigord and his second wife, Brunissende of Foix. Through her mother, she was granddaughter of Roger-Bernard III, Count of Foix. A date of birth for Agnes is not recorded, though it can certainly be placed in the window of 1298-1311, the years that her parents married and the death of her father.Cawley, Medieval LandsZacour,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.5 It is likely that Agnes was born around 1304/1305 due to her mother having four children between 1299 and 1303 and Agnes herself marrying in 1321, making her between fifteen and seventeen years of age at that time. Amongst her siblings was H√©lie de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, a Cardinal who would become a major figure in the Avignon Papacy. The marriage between Agnes and John was likely arranged by King Robert due to his favour for the Avignon Papacy. The King had anti-Ghibelline ambitions in Northern Italy and desired support from the Papacy and the French in achieving them.Zacour,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.31 Agnes's family had marital ties to Pope John XXII as her sister Rosemburge was married to Jacques de Lavie, the Pope's grand-nephew. Acting upon this during his visit to Avignon, Robert arranged for his brother to marry Jacques's sister-in-law.Zacour,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.31 The marriage contract is dated 14 November 1321.Cawley, Medieval Lands The couple were married shy of fourteen years and had three sons: *Charles, Duke of Durazzo (1323‚Äì1348) *Louis of Durazzo (1324‚Äì1362), Count of Gravina *Robert of Durazzo (1326‚Äì1356) Agnes likely had first-hand experience of the quarrels that occurred within her new family. Her husband was just one of King Robert's brothers and he often came into conflict with another, Philip I, Prince of Taranto. The brothers were at odds in Morea, where John ruled under the suzerainty of Philip, an arrangement which did nothing to dispel their mutual distrust. Philip was married to Catherine II, Latin Empress, making him titular Latin Emperor. John too desired more titles and territory. Attempting to diffuse the tensions between his brothers, Robert made John give up his claims in the Morea in exchange for the duchy of Durazzo, which he received in 1332. This made Agnes a Duchess. However, this did little to remove the jealousy and suspicion separating the brothers; this ill-feeling would characterise the relationship between their wives.Zacour,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.31 Agnes's husband died in 1335 and he was succeeded by their son, Charles. Political intrigues Any plans that the Durazzo family may have had of marrying Joanna, heiress to Robert's throne, were thwarted in 1333 when Robert arranged for her to marry Andrew of Hungary. However, in his final will and testament, Robert instructed that if Joanna were to die without issue, the Neapolitan throne should pass to her sister, Maria, who was unmarried.Musto, Medieval Naples: A Documentary History pp. 234‚Äì98 Whilst the monarch was spoken for, the heir was not. Agnes did her best to make her family appear favourable towards the royals, in the hope that Robert would consider a Durazzo match for Maria.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.41 In 1338, she supported her son's position at the head of Robert's armada to conquer Sicily.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.41 However, the campaign failed due to the outbreak of typhus. Agnes used her own position at court to her advantage, making friendly overtures towards Queen Sancha and the young princesses.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.50 This too did not result in any marriage plans. King Robert died in January 1343. Agnes's tactics during his final years had proven unsuccessful therefore, she took matters into her own hands. Immediately after Robert's death, she orchestrated the marriage between her eldest son and Maria. The timing of this marriage was crucial as Joanna strongly favoured the Taranto faction, having an affair with Prince Robert, son of Catherine, and Maria was promised in marriage to one of Andrew's brothers.Edwin Lawrence Godkin, The History of Hungary, p.77 The two matters would only have politically isolated the Durazzo clan and thwarted their chances of reaching the throne. Agnes used her connection to her influential brother, Cardinal Talleyrand, to put aside the Hungarian match for Maria and obtain the Pope's permission for the ambitious marriage.Edwin Lawrence Godkin, The History of Hungary, p.76 Not relying on family feeling alone, Agnes bribed her brother with 22,000 florins left over from her dowry in order to ensure absolute support.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.51 Building up a friendship with Queen Sancha also appears to have paid off as the dowager queen supported the match.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.51 On the other hand, the Taranto clan were horrified when they discovered Agnes's scheme and used their influence over Joanna to put an end to it. Catherine instructed the young queen to oppose the match, hoping that the lack of royal favour would act as a deterrent.Edwin Lawrence Godkin, The History of Hungary, p.76 Much to the dismay of the Tarantos, their control over Joanna was not enough to prevent Agnes, who responded by abducting Maria one night in April 1343 and marrying her off to Charles.Edwin Lawrence Godkin, The History of Hungary, p.76 The marriage was a great insult to Joanna and Andrew as their royal authority was defied and the latter's family lost out on their chance for total control of the succession. The Tarantos were ready for armed warfare against their Durazzo cousins, Naples stood on the brink of civil war.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.52 To remedy the matter, the Pope wrote letters to both Joanna and Agnes, confirming the validity of the papal dispensation, asking them to put aside their differences and to urge Joanna to allow an official marriage ceremony.Zacour,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.33 The letter to Agnes also informs that the Pope was sending Talleyrand's chamberlain, Roger of Vintrono, who had experience in the Papal service in Italy, to mend the breach amongst the Neapolitans.Zacour,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.33 Roger's efforts clearly worked as Andrew pardoned Agnes and her family and the marriage was officially recognised on 14 July.Edwin Lawrence Godkin, The History of Hungary, p.77Zacour,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.34 The fact that Maria was pregnant probably also helped resolve the issue, no more scandals were desired.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.52 Agnes then became involved in the marital disputes between Joanna and Andrew. As the latter was initially refused joint authority with his wife, he wrote to his mother Elisabeth, announcing plans to flee Naples. Elisabeth decided to make a state visit and threatened to take Andrew with her when she returned home. For the first time, Agnes, Catherine and Joanna worked together to persuade Elisabeth not to do so. All three women were aware that Andrew would only return with a Hungarian army; according to Domenico de Gravina, Joanna and Catherine were motivated purely by this threat however, Agnes was genuinely concerned with the welfare of Andrew.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.63 The appeals worked and Andrew remained. Despite her assistance in this matter, Joanna did not forgive Agnes for her marital scheming.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.68 Death Much like her life, Agnes's death was also surrounded by political intrigue. During the early months of 1345, the duchess had managed to make herself even more unpopular with Joanna by meddling in diplomacy linked to the Papacy.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.70 In addition, she had attempted to have one of her sons married to Catherine's daughter, in the hope of penetrating the Taranto clan.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.70 In May, she fell ill. Allegedly, the doctor asked for a urine sample and when this was taken that evening, it was switched with that of a pregnant lady-in-waiting, who was a friend of Joanna's. When the doctor discovered that Agnes was supposedly pregnant, it caused a scandal and led to her son, Charles, keeping his distance from her. This made for perfect conditions for the ladies-in-waiting to poison Agnes.Zacour,Transactions of the American Philosophical Society (1960), p.36 Although, it is quite possible that these events are fictional, they are accounted by Domenico de Gravina, whom as noted from the encounter with Elisabeth, appeared sympathetic to Agnes rather than Joanna and Catherine. It is just as possible that Agnes succumbed to a bacterial infection, worsened by the hot climate.Nancy Goldstone, Joanna, The Notorious Queen of Naples, Jerusalem and Sicily, p.70 Charles and Maria never ascended the throne, the former was executed three years after the death of his mother for his own political intrigues involving Joanna and the Hungarians. Despite this, Charles, a grandson of Agnes through her son, Louis, succeeded to the throne in 1382. Much like his family, he clashed with Joanna but he managed to depose her and had her strangled. He was married to Margaret, a daughter of Charles and Maria.

He studies the development of novel agents for the treatment of hormone-responsive and non- responsive breast and prostate cancers and the design of estrogens and antiestrogens that have a favorable balance of beneficial versus detrimental effects.  Early life  John Katzenellenbogen was born May 10, 1944, in Poughkeepsie, New York. His parents taught at Vassar College, his father a professor of Art History and his mother a pianist. In 1958, his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where his father became Head of the Department of Art History at Johns Hopkins University and his mother joined the faculty at Peabody Conservatory and Goucher College. Though he began playing the cello at age 10, his passion was for science. Katzenellenbogen attended Gilman School and held various summer jobs: in 1960, he worked at the Research Institute for Advanced Studies in the photosynthesis lab of Dr. Bessel Kok, and, in 1961, he was a General Electric Student Research Fellow at Union College in Schenectady, New York. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he majored in Chemistry, going on to complete a PhD in Chemistry in 1969 at Harvard under the direction of Dr. E. J. Corey.  Career  Katzenellenbogen began his academic career as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1969 and was promoted to Associate Professor in 1975 and to Full Professor in 1979. He was named the Roger Adams Professor and subsequently the chaired Swanlund Professor of Chemistry. He was one of the first academic chemists to work in the field of chemical biology. His major research efforts have focused on the study of steroid hormones and their biological receptors, the estrogen receptor in particular. Katzenellenbogen's research is highly collaborative, and he works with other scientists locally, nationally, and internationally. He has published more than 550 articles and has trained over 130 PhD's and Postdoctoral Associates. He is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, on whose National Council he served for many years. He has received numerous awards from scientific societies, including the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award, the E. B. Hershberg Award for Important Discoveries in Medicinally Active Substances from the American Chemical Society, the Endocrine Society's Fred Conrad Koch Lifetime Achievement Award, which he shared with Dr. Benita Katzenellenbogen, and the Award for Outstanding Achievements in Chemistry in Cancer Research from the American Association for Cancer Research In 2018, Katzenellenbogen was inducted into the Medicinal Chemistry Hall of Fame of the American Chemical Society.  Research  Katzenellenbogen developed the first affinity label for the estrogen receptor that was widely used to characterize its physical and biochemical properties, and he elucidated the metabolic activation of antiestrogens and characterized their sites of action. He also pioneered the development of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents for estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors. The PET imaging agents he developed, FES, FDHT, and FFNP, continue to be utilized to improve the prediction of patient response to endocrine therapy agents and to assist in the development of new cancer therapeutics. His more recent work is focused on developing novel antiestrogens effective against endocrine therapy-resistant forms of breast cancer and dissecting the mechanisms and signaling pathways that underlie the selective actions of estrogens in different target tissues.

Toothette is a trademark owned by Sage Products, part of Stryker Corporation, and registered in the United States. Toothettes are disposable, single-use oral care sponge swabs attached to a stick. They are used for oral care in the hospital and long-term care setting. Disposable oral care swabs may also be known by other various names, such as sponge swab, swabs for oral care, foam swab, mouth swab, and oral swabstick.  Types  Some, but not all, major companies that manufacture oral care swabs include SAGE Products, Dynarex, Medline Industries, and Halyard Health. There are a diverse range of oral care swabs on the market, including flavoured oral care swabs with dentrifice (toothpaste), oral care swabs combined with sodium bicarbonate, oral care swabs with a suction swab system, untreated oral care swabs, and lemon glycerine swabsticks. Oral care swabs have also been combined with additional oral care products such as mouth moisturizers (example: biotene), perox-a-mint solution, and antiseptic oral rinses. Two Toothettes and their packaging.  Intended use  The Toothette is meant to moisten and clear the oral cavity of food debris and thickened saliva associated with xerostomia (dry mouth). Most importantly, the Toothette's intended use is as an adjunct to other oral care tools (toothbrush and interdental cleaners) in the hospital and long-term care setting. It is especially useful when caring for the oral health of intubated and palliative care patients, and is recommended for individuals who are receiving radiation therapy, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, or are immunosuppressed. The American Dental Association, approved the Toothette Plus Oral Swab with Sodium Bicarbonate and the Toothette Oral Care Single Use System in May 2002, stating the ‚ÄúToothette Oral Care Single Use System/Toothette Plus Oral Swab is accepted as an effective oral cleansing device for individuals who have difficulty practicing normal oral hygiene‚Äù. Toothettes and other foam swabs are effective at stimulating the tissue between oral care, and are used for patients who are unable to care for their own oral health. Oral swabs are especially helpful when a patient suffers from gross mucositis, potentially arising from chemotherapy. This is because the oral swabs can apply moisture to the oral cavity, therefore soothing the tissues. Additionally, oral care swabs are indicated when toothbrushing is contraindicated, particularly when an individual's platelet counts are below 40000-50000 and when there are issues accessing the oral cavity. It is also necessary to use oral swabs for oral care when an individual has thrombocytopenia in order to reduce risk of exacerbated bleeding.  Misuse  Often oral health education and training is limited for healthcare aids and nurses, leading to suboptimal oral care for dependent patients in long-term care and hospital settings. The oral care swab is inaccurately used in the long-term care and hospital setting as the predominant tool for oral care, and toothbrushes are rarely used Grap et al. found that nursing staff in an intensive care unit most commonly use oral care swabs and mouthwash as the predominant tool for oral care, especially for intubated patients. This is concerning because it is well-established that the oral care swab does not effectively remove oral biofilm, and the toothbrush is significantly better at promoting health of the gums and controlling oral biofilm. When the efficacy of the toothbrush and oral care swab are compared, the toothbrush is better at removing plaque from the oral cavity. The current oral care practices of nursing staff in the long-term care and hospital setting do not reflect evidence-based recommendations present in the literature. The American Dental Association cautioned ‚Äú[the oral care swab] does not substitute for daily brushing and flossing for effective plaque removal from teeth and, when possible, should be used in conjunction with brushing and flossing.‚Äù Additionally, nursing mouth care policy for the Health Care Corporation of St. Johns reflects a similar perspective with a nursing alert stating: ‚Äútoothettes are not recommended as a substitute for a toothbrush‚Äù. Dalhousie University‚Äôs report, Brushing up on mouth care: An oral health resource for those who provide care to older adults, further cautioned that the sponge end of oral care swabs does not have the ability to mechanical remove oral biofilm from the teeth and gums because it is too soft. They further elaborate on how the toothbrush performs significantly better in promoting healing of the gums, and state that ‚Äútoothbrushes are safe and effective for removing debris and plaque from all oral tissues, including the tongue, palate, cheeks and teeth‚Äù. Effective oral biofilm control on a regular basis is a therapeutic intervention to reduce the risk of developing numerous systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and aspiration pneumonia due to poor oral health. Therefore, it is essential that oral care policies of hospitals and long-term care settings discourage the use of oral care swabs as the sole tool for oral biofilm control. When used properly, toothbrushing and devices for interdental cleaning are well- established tools for regular plaque removal, and should be the predominant oral care tools used in the hospital and long-term care setting. The oral care swab can be used as an adjunct to toothbrushing and flossing to moisten and clear the oral cavity of food debris and thickened saliva associated with dry mouth.  Health risks  Oral care swabs, when used improperly, pose significant health risks. They are a choking hazard because the sponge end can dislodge and be aspirated during use. On September 22, 2015 Health England Education Board banned sponge swabs from being used in the hospital and long- term care setting due to 800 safety incidents associated with their use, even causing the death of a patient in one case.  Issues surrounding lemon glycerine swabsticks  Initially lemon glycerine swabs were used to aid in saliva production. However, it was noted that they caused irritation and enamel decalcification due to the acidity of the lemon. The combination of these factors lead to recurring dry mouth, counteracting the initial reason for its use. Due to their drying effect, the swabs were also ineffective in preventing dry lips. Therefore, the nursing mouth care policy for the Health Care Corporation of St. Johns recommended discontinuing use of lemon glycerine swabs for oral care due to its adverse effects. The evidence contraindicates the use of lemon glycerine swabstick for individuals suffering from dry mouth.

Early years Born Louise Friederike Auguste von Barckhaus of Wiesenh√ºtten in Frankfurt, she was the sixth child of Charlene von Barckhaus of Wiesenh√ºtten (1736-1804), and Heinrich Carl von Barckhaus of Wiesenh√ºtten (1725-1793), who was later made a baron. She received artistic training from her mother, who was an amateur painter, and from a relative, Christian Georg Sch√ºtz the Elder. Through family connections, she made the acquaintance of the poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe early in life and they later corresponded. She moved to Darmstadt, probably after the death of her father, and lived with one of her brothers. Between 1802 and 1805 she took two long trips to England with her brother, where she made contact with English naturalists and botanical illustrators in order to continue her education as a painter. It appears that during this period she took private lessons with the well-known botanical painter James Sowerby. Marriage Waterclor painting from her Suriname period (1812) In 1805, she married a widowed Dutch officer, Willem Benjamin van Panhuys (1764-1816). In 1811, they traveled to Suriname, where he had a coffee plantation inherited from his deceased first wife. They later acquired a sugar cane plantation there as well. In early 1816, Suriname‚Äîwhich has been occupied by the English since 1804‚Äîreturned to Dutch rule. Willem was appointed Governor-General by King William I of the Netherlands, but his tenure in office lasted only a few months as he died in July 1816. Louise then moved back to Frankfurt, where she lived in a house that had once belonged to Matth√§us Merian the Younger. Art Louise von Panhuys mainly painted watercolors of plant specimens, with attention to scientific accuracy. She was influenced by the botanical art of Maria Sibylla Merian and the travel writings of Alexander von Humboldt. During her years in Suriname, she painted some 90 watercolors, now housed Frankfurt University Library. In 1898, her work was shown publicly for the first time by the Senckenberg Nature Research Society. More recently, exhibitions showcasing her work have been mounted by the Frankfurt University Library (1991) and the Frankfurter Sparkasse (2009).

Thibault wanted The 3ND to sound like if Bullet for My Valentine and Sum 41 wrote a song together. Drown In My Mind is a song Thibault wrote about based on his alcoholism, low self-esteem, and tending to over think things. Delete is a song that was supposed to have been for 5 Seconds of Summer. Dreams That We Don't Share is a song about people not agreeing with certain situations as confirmed by Thibault.

It will land near the lunar south pole at the Boguslavsky crater. It was renamed from Luna-Glob lander to Luna 25 to emphasize the continuity of the Soviet Luna programme from the 1970s, though it is still part of what was at one point conceptualized as the Luna-Glob lunar exploration program. The launch is scheduled for October 2021.  History  Nascent plans for what is now Luna 25 began in the late 1990s, with the evaluation of two spacecraft designs having taken place by 1998. Attempts to revive and complete the project continued throughout the 2000s and were punctuated by an aborted attempt at international cooperation via a merger with JAXA's now-cancelled Lunar-A orbiter, and pressure from another attempted cooperative lunar mission with ISRO (which continued without Russia's involvement). Delays in the 2010s came first from the significant rework and delay brought on by the failure of Phobos-Grunt in 2011. This is the point at which the modern Luna 25 design was developed. Later, work on the lander was slowed by resource pressures being placed upon spacecraft developer NPO Lavochkin, such as the weather satellite Elektro-L No.2 and the Spektr-RG observatory as well the landing platform Russia is contributing to ExoMars 2020. By 2017, the propulsion system for the spacecraft was in assembly.  Mission  Initial mission plans called for a lander and orbiter, with the latter also deploying impact penetrators. In its current form, Luna 25 is a lander only, with a primary mission of proving out the landing technology. The mission will carry of scientific instruments, including a robotic arm for soil samples and possible drilling hardware. The launch is currently planned for October 2021 on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket with Fregat-M upper stage, from Baikonur or Vostochny. Science payload The lander will feature a payload composed by 9 notional science instruments: * ADRON-LR, active neutron and gamma-ray analysis of regolith * ARIES-L, measurement of plasma in the exosphere * LASMA-LR, laser mass-spectrometer * LIS-TV-RPM, infrared spectrometry of minerals and imaging * PmL, measurement of dust and micro-meteorites * THERMO-L, measurement of the thermal properties of regolith * STS-L, panoramic and local imaging * Laser retroreflector, Moon libration and ranging experiments * BUNI, power and science data support LINA-XSAN, a Swedish payload, was to fly with Luna 25, but delays to the launch date caused Sweden to cancel this plan. Instead, LINA-XSAN flew on Chang'e 4 in 2019.

Child marriage is an increasing problem within many African countries. In South Sudan, child marriage is a growing epidemic. Child Marriage is a violation of women's and children's rights. The age range for these children to marry is between the age of twelve and eighteen. Although, 18 is the legal age to marry, many cultural practices are placed higher that the actual law in underrepresented countries. Marriages are granted approval with a parental consent. Underage marriage is an uncomfortable topic, yet it is practiced widely by the Fathers of the families, in countries that experience poverty. This happens in order to have financial stability through dowry, the increase in bride price, and the alleviation out of poverty. Child marriage does not only to pertain to young girls, it also has its affects on young boys. In many African Countries, like South Sudan, child marriage is related to girls. Child marriage usually pertains to the bond between a child and an adult. Current figures In 2017 in South Sudan, 52% of girls are married off before the age of 18. 9% are married before they turn 15. South Sudan is the 5th highest nation in the world for child marriage.  Age and initiation  The common age range of children who are forced into marriage is from fifteen years old to eighteen years old. Many children are married off under the age of fifteen. In South Sudan, a child is someone who is not capable of having children. Therefore, a child who has begun her menstrual cycle, puberty, and can produce children is an adult. The discrepancy of what a child is, considered to be is a problem today. Families in South Sudan do not allow their children to marry men from other tribes, due to the significance of the symbolism and traditional aspects of the culture. A girls value depends on her age. This means that the younger in age the women is the, higher her value increases. This makes it easier for the girl to be married off. The older the women is the more difficult it is for her to find marriage. The older a women gets the less value she is to a marriage. Child Marriage in South Sudan is commonly seem in rural parts of the country and not in urban areas. In these parts, traditional law has power over legislative law. The decision of a child to get married is put into action by the Father. The Mother does not have any say in regards with decisions that are supposed to benefit the family. A child that is married off is solely for economic reasons. This increases the Families status in the society. When girls are married to the man that is courting them, the family is generously awarded with gifts in the form of Dowry. Dowry is one of the most important factors that coincide with child marriage. Dowry is given out in the form of cattle which shows great respect to the family. The man that the child is being married off to supplies the family with cattle and riches to show his appreciation. In many cases, these rewards alleviates the family of hardships in the form of poverty. The idea of dowry is also related to the women's education. The more educated the women is, the more value she has and the more dowry her family gets. An educated women is said to be a suitable marriage partner by many men in South Sudan. Yet, when a woman‚Äôs education is taken from her, she has no other option. A girl can also be seen a problem or burden to her family if she is not married off. The more dowry a family has, the more wealth and status they hold. Girls who have had many years of higher education are not as likely to get married as children.  Bride price  Child Marriages are some of the most expensive marriages. Bride price is similar to that of Dowry. The more value that a child has, the more money a man has to pay for her. Bride price is related to a man's status. When a man does not find wife, his value and standing in society goes down. When bride price inflation happens, young men will not be able to afford marriage. Without an income, young men are not worth anything and cannot purchase a wife.  Health  Many health problems are related to children who are forced into a marriage. Health problems in rural places are not treated sanitarily which results in infections and death. Early pregnancies are not treated as they should. The toll on the girls body is not taken into consideration because of the status that women in South Sudan hold. They are inferior to men. Sanitation is a major problem. When girls go into labor, they are only taken to the hospital if strenuous problems arise. If not, they are expected to deliver their children in unsterilized places. Maternal health care services is very limited in underrepresented countries. A women's labor can be stretched out if she has been found to be unfaithful to the man that she forced to marry. The child will not be allowed to be born unless the women tells her husband who she has had relations with.  Causes  The cause of child marriage is for the family of the child pride to remain good social standing and to have financial prosperity. This tradition is upheld by the families in order to keep their children safe and to prevent their daughter from conceiving children without being married. This idea protects the families pride and honor. Families who do not give their children up for marriage are usually criticized by the neighboring communities and are shown scrutiny. It is easier for the families to follow what everyone else is participating in. Families also marry their children off at a young age to make sure that their daughters have protection and security.  Consequences  There are many health consequences that spiral from a child giving birth at a young age. Children who are younger than the age of 18 are more likely to die due to aggressive birth whereas an older women will be okay. Young children who deliver babies are subject to diseases and many health related problems that can prevent them from conceiving another child. Furthermore, children who marry at a young age are typically not educated. They cannot use their education as an outlet to get out of abusive relationships. These children grow up taking the inferior role in the household and are forced to obey their husbands. Child brides are sheltered from their community and are not allowed to participate in communal events. Child brides who run away from their husbands are subject to violence in the form of physical beatings, sexual assault, and marriage.

IPC TM-650 2.6.25 Conductive Anodic Filament (CAF) Resistance Test: X-Y Axis https://www.ipc.org/4.0_Knowledge/4.1_Standards/test/2-6-25.pdf CAF is influenced by electric field strength, temperature (including soldering temperatures), humidity, laminate material, and the presence of manufacturing defects. The occurrence of CAF failures has been primarily driven by the electronics industry pushing for higher density circuit boards and the use of electronics in harsher environments for high reliability applications.

CAF failures can manifest as current leakage, intermittent electrical shorts, and even dielectric breakdown between conductors in printed circuit boards.C. Tulkoff. ‚ÄúDesign for Reliability: PCBs‚Äù North Texas IPC Designers Council. https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Design_for_Reliability_PCBs.pdf?t=1514473946162 This often makes CAF very difficult to detect, especially when it occurs as an intermittent issue. There are a few things that can be done to isolate the fault location and confirm CAF as a root cause of a failure. If the issue is intermittent then putting the sample of interest under combined temperature- humidity-bias (THB) may help recreate the failure mode. In addition, techniques such as cross sectioning or superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) can be used to identify the failure. C.

Certain material selection (i.e. laminate) and design rules (i.e. via spacing) can help reduce CAF risk. Poor adhesion between the resin and glass fibers in the PCB can create a path for CAF to occur. This may depend on parameters of the silane finish applied to the glass fibers, which is used to promote adhesion to the resin.S. Binfield, C. Hillman, T. Johnston, and N. Blattau, ‚ÄùConductive Anodic Filaments: The Role of Epoxy-Glass Adhesion‚Äù, DfR Solutions White Paper There are also testing standards that can be performed to assess CAF risk. IPC TM-650 2.6.25 provides a test method to assess CAF susceptibility. Additionally, IPC TM-650 2.6.16 provides a pressure vessel test method to rapidly evaluate glass epoxy laminate integrity.

Family background E.N. Njaka was born in Okwaejiaku, Umukegwu, Akokwa on 23 June 1921. His father, Mazi George Maduneme Njaka, was one of the earliest Christian converts of the Catholic Denomination in Orlu province. His mother, Mrs. Mary Nwaku Njaka (nee Egbebu), also from Umukegwu, was one of the earliest seamstresses to come from Mbanasaa clan. Elechukwu was their second child. Education Elechukwu started his education at St. Barnabas Catholic Primary School, Akokwa. On the advice of his missionary friend, Rev. Father Liddan, his father sent Elechukwu to Adazi in the present Anambra State to complete his primary education. In 1937, following the establishment of St. Michael's Catholic Parish, Urualla, he was sent there to teach. Thus he became the first primary school teacher in Mbanasaa clan. A year later (1938), he gained admission into the Christ the King College (CKC), Onitsha, for his secondary education. After Elechukwu's wedding to Ulunwa R. ·ªåji, he was sponsored by his father, in collaboration with his brother-in-law Dr. Nwafor Orizu (who later became Nigeria's second Senate President and later acting President of Nigeria), to continue his education in the United States of America. While in the US, congresswoman and philanthropist, Frances P. Bolton, became his mentor. He obtained a bachelor's degree in History and Political Science from Xavier University and a master's degree in the same topic from University of California, Los Angeles. During his undergraduate years, Elechukwu wrote to W.E.B. Du Bois, challenging him on his use of the word \\"negro\\". Du Bois replied, \\"If black people were called epilogimistes instead of Negroes they would still be the same people with the same problems, with the same past and future.\\" Community development work Elechukwu returned home in 1958 to collect materials for his doctoral studies thesis and decided to stay for some years, having seen the high rate of local illiteracy and hardship. He founded the Earnest Gems Grammar School (EGGS) in Akokwa and co- founded the Community Secondary School, Nsirimo in Umuahia South L.G.A of Abia State. Mazi Njaka was elected as an Honorable Member of the Eastern Nigeria House of Assembly and in this capacity both pursued community development and resolved ensuing political disputes. Njaka described the importance of negotiation in Igbo politics as follows: :Deny an Igbo food but allow him to speak, and he will never forget the good you have done him. Through language, he believes, he can not only achieve an immediate result but also win the acquiescence of those whose lasting support is needed. In addition, it is talk and the response to it that measure political potency, not the amount of force that is exerted. Force portends weakness in politics as racism does in reason. Confirmed in this belief, the Igbo normally prefers negotiating to fighting. However, when fighting becomes unavoidable, he utilizes the symbols of his ancestors to strengthen his desire to live and survive. Returning to the United States in 1968, Njaka raised money for a family member to come to school in the US and escape the Nigerian Civil War.

We need to understand why the white man has been doing what he has been doing to us. This will enable us to reach a better compromise between races and an opportunity to live together as human beings.\\" Igbo Political Culture not only explored Igbo political wisdom but also its broader application in the Pan-African project. For example: :The Igbo have a vivid saying that what is learned from the land (that is, from the root of the culture) is far more helpful and lasting than whatever is acquired through imitation. The Africa of today does not provide grounds for optimism for the future of the continent. We must attempt to seek the factors that made Africa the mother of world civilizations. The biblical prodigal son returned to survive. For Africa to regain its glory and leadership by redeeming itself and reengaging in the humanization of mankind, it is paramount important for Africa to reach for roots.

This modern mosque in the University of Indonesia with its multi-tiered roofs follows the traditional architecture of a mosque found in the Indonesian archipelago. Indonesian mosques refer to the architectural traditions of mosques build in the archipelago of Indonesia. Initial forms of the mosque, for example, were predominantly built in the vernacular Indonesian architectural style which employs Hindu, Buddhist or Chinese architectural elements, and notably didn't equip orthodox form of Islamic architectural elements such as dome and minaret. Vernacular architectural style varies depending on the island and region. Since the 19th century the mosques began incorporating more orthodox styles which were imported during the Dutch colonial era. Architectural style during this era is characterized by Indo- Islamic or Moorish Revival architectural elements, with onion-shaped dome and arched vault. Minaret was not introduced to full extent until the 19th century, and its introduction was accompanied by the importation of architectural styles of Persian and Ottoman origin with the prominent usage of calligraphy and geometric patterns. During this time, many of the older mosques built in traditional style were renovated, and small domes were added to their square hipped roofs. History Islam spread gradually in Indonesia from the 12th century onwards, and especially during the 14th and 15th century. The advent of Islam did not lead to the introduction of a new building tradition, but saw the appropriation of existing architectural forms, which were reinterpreted to suit Muslim requirements. =Early Islamic architecture= This multi-tiered pavilion in Bali is similar in form with some of the earliest mosques in Indonesia. Masjid Tuo Kayu in West Sumatra. Early Islamic architecture resembles a Majapahit era candi or gates. Most of the early Islamic mosques can still be found in Java, and the architectural style follows the existing building tradition in Java, in which four central posts support a soaring pyramidal roofs. None of the earliest Islamic structures in Sumatra survived. The characteristic of Islamic architecture include multi-tiered roofs, ceremonial gateways, and a variety of decorative elements such as elaborate clay finials for roof peaks. The multi-tiered roofs are derived from the tiered meru roof found in Balinese temple. The oldest surviving Indonesian mosques are quite large and in most cases were closely associated with palaces. The oldest surviving mosque in Indonesia is the Great Mosque of Demak which is the royal mosque of the Sultanate of Demak, although this is not the oldest Islamic structure. The oldest Islamic structure in Indonesia are parts of the royal palace in Sultanate of Cirebon, Cirebon. The palace complex contains a chronogram which can be read as the Saka equivalent of 1454 CE. Early Islamic palaces retain many features of pre-Islamic architecture which is apparent in the gates or drum towers. The Kasepuhan Palace was probably begun in the late pre-Islamic period, and continued to grow during the Hinduism-to-Islam transitional period. The complex contains clues to the stages of the process of the gradual changes as Islam become incorporated into Indonesian architecture. Two of the Hindu features adopted into Islam in the Palace is the two types of gateways - the split portal (candi bentar) which provides access to the public audience pavilion and the lintel gate (paduraksa) which leads to the front court. Kudus Mosque in Central Java was built in the 16th century following the Hindu-Buddhist style of the Majapahit era. Masjid Agung Kotagede Mosque Minarets was not originally an integral part in Indonesian mosque. The Menara Kudus Mosque's tower was built in a Javanese Hindu brick temple style, This tower is not used as a minaret, but as a place for bedug, a huge drum which is beaten to the summons to prayer in Indonesia. This tower is similar to the Drumtowers of Hindu Balinese temples called kul-kul. These suggest a continuation of an earlier Hindu-Buddhist period into the Islamic era in Indonesia. Intensive spice trade had strong influence on the Indonesian archipelago. As a result, the multi-storied roof architecture of mosques can be found from Aceh to Ambon. The spread of Islam through the Indonesian archipelago can be divided into three distinct historical processes. In Sumatra, the establishment of early Islamic states reflected the emergence of new polities rather than the subjugation of existing kingdoms. In Java, Muslim rulers succeeded to the political power base of Hindu kings; instead of eliminating the earlier ideology, they maintained a high degree of continuity with the past while extending their dominion. In eastern Indonesia (Borneo, Celebes, and Maluku) established rulers simply converted to Islam. These three distinct processes are reflected in the architecture of mosques in different part of the Indonesian Archipelago. In Sumatra, mosques do not occupy a significant position in terms of their spatial relation to the palace of the ruler, rather provides the focus for a wider area which includes the palace complex. In Java, there is a strong relationship between mosque and the ruler's palace, even when they are located far away from each other. This is particularly significant in the case of Masjid Agung (Great Mosques) of Java which are situated within the palace complex. In eastern Indonesia, conversion to Islam simply involved the appropriation of existing religious buildings to serve as mosques. Traditionally, mosque establishment in Indonesia began with the opening or purchase of land for the mosque. Next is the first construction of the mosque, often using traditional material such as bamboo and thatched roof. The mosque will eventually be made into a permanent mosque and later gradually extended to accommodate the increasing population. =Colonial period= Domes and pointed arches, a well-known features in central, south and southwest Asia did not appear in Indonesia until the 19th century, when they were introduced by Dutch influence over local rulers. Indonesian scholars became familiar with the Near Eastern influence as they began to visit Islamic centers in Egypt and India. Domes in Indonesia follows the form of the Indian and Persian's onion- shaped dome. These domes first appear in Sumatra. The Grand Mosque of Riau Sultanate in Penyengat Island is the oldest surviving mosque in Indonesia with a dome. There is an indication that the Rao Rao Mosque of West Sumatra employs a dome in its early design. The adoption of dome in mosques of Java was slower than it is in Sumatra. The oldest domed mosque in Java is probably Jami Mosque of Tuban (1928), followed by Great Mosque of Kediri and Al Makmur Mosque of Tanah Abang in Jakarta. =Post-independence= Al Azhar Mosque (1958) in Kebayoran Baru, Jakarta is influenced by the Near East more strongly than the vernacular style. A modern mosque in Central Java. After the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia, many older mosques built in traditional style were renovated and small domes were added to their square hipped roofs. Probably it was built in imitation of similar modifications made to the main mosque in the regional capital nearby. Since the 1970s, the appropriateness of traditional buildings has been politically acknowledged, and some layered hipped forms have been reinstated. President Suharto contributed to this trend during the 1980s by instigating the Amal Bakti Muslim Pancasila Foundation which subsidized the erection of small mosques in less prosperous communities. The standardized design of these mosques includes three hipped roofs above a square prayer hall, reminiscent of the Great Mosque of Demak. Today, mosque architecture in Indonesia breaks apart from the multi-tiered traditions of traditional Javanese mosque. Most mosques in Indonesia today follows the Near Eastern influence e.g. Persian, Arabic, or Ottoman style architecture. By region =Java= The mosque of Demak, the oldest surviving mosque in Indonesia, shows the typical Javanese architecture for mosque with its multi- tiered roof, a style which will be emulated across the Indonesian archipelago. The earliest mosques in Java were built in the mid-15th century onwards, although there is an earlier reference to mosques in the 14th-century Majapahit capital. Most of the earliest mosques in Java typically include multi-tiered roof. A serambi (roofed porch) attached to the front of the mosque. The minimum number of tiers is two whilst the maximum is five. The top of the roof is decorated with a clay decoration called the mustoko or memolo. Sometimes the roof tiers represent a division into separate floors each of which is used for a different function: the lower floor for prayer, middle floor for study, and top floor for the call to prayer. Minarets were not introduced into Java until the 19th century so that in a one-storeyed mosque, the call to prayer is made from the attached serambi. The highest roof tier is supported by four main pillars, called soko guru. In several of the oldest mosques, one of these pillars is made of wooden splinters held together by metal bands (the significant of which is unknown). Inside the mosque there is a mihrab in the qibla wall and a wooden minbar. The mihrab niche is made of brick and are highly decorated with deep wood-carving derived from the pre- Islamic art of the area. The enclosure walls are fairly low and decorated with inset bowls and plates from China, Vietnam and elsewhere. In the middle of the east side there is a monumental gate. Some mosques, such as the mosque in Yogyakarta, is further enclosed by a moat. Other characteristics of these early mosques are a peristyle, courtyard, and gates. =Sumatra= Similar to the mosques of Java, Sumatran mosques share the attributes of Javanese mosque, although it is unfortunate that none of the earliest Islamic structures in Sumatra survived. The 17th century Jami Mosque of Indrapuri in Aceh stands on a former Hindu temple of Indrapuri. In Aceh, royal mosque was a center of armed resistance to the Dutch in the 1870s, and therefore was destroyed in battle. Early prints show it as a structure with wide hipped roofs similar to those of a mosque still standing in the 17th century citadel of Sultan Iskandar Muda. In West Sumatra, mosques, known as surau, conform the local style with the similar three- or five-tiered roofs as the Javanese mosque, but with the characteristic Minangkabau 'horned' roof profile. The roof is supported on ranks of concentric columns, often focusing on a towering central support which reaches the apex of the building. Some mosques are built on islands in artificial ponds. Traditional Minangkabau woodcarvings may be implemented in the facade. Many mosques in Pekanbaru and Riau adopts a three- or five-tiered roofs similar to West Sumatra, but with lack of prominent 'horned' roof profile. This gives them appearance of a Javanese-style mosque but with a taller profile. =Kalimantan= A typical Banjarese mosque with its steep peak roof and stilts. The kingdom of Banjar in South Kalimantan was the first Hindu Kingdom in Borneo to convert into Islam after receiving influence from the Sultanate of Demak of Java. The architectural style of the Banjarese mosque shares similarities with the mosques of the Demak sultanates, especially the Great Mosque of Demak. During the course of history, the Banjar develops its own architectural style. One of the main characteristics of Banjar mosque is the three- or five-tiered roof with a steep top roof, compared to the relatively low-angled roof of Javanese mosque. Another characteristic is the absence of serambi (roofed porch) in Banjarese mosques, a traditional feature in Javanese mosques. The Banjarese mosque style is similar with the mosques of West Sumatra and are possibly related to other examples from peninsular Malaysia. Other characteristics are the employment of stilts in some mosques, a separate roof on the mihrab, the peaks of the roof are decorated with finials called pataka (the mustoko/memolo of Demak Sultanates) made of Borneo ironwood, ornaments on the corner of the roofs called jamang, and fences within the perimeter of the mosque area called kandang rasi. Other differences with the mosques of Java is that the Banjarese mosques contain no serambi (roofed porch), a traditional feature in Javanese mosques. Banjar-style mosques can be found in Banjarmasin and Pontianak. The mosque Masjid Tinggi in Bagan Serai, Malaysia, is a Banjar-style mosque. =Sulawesi= Mosques in Sulawesi follows the architectural style of Javanese mosque with multiple (usually three) tiered roofs. =Maluku and Papua= Islam came to Maluku in the late 15th century via Java, with the strongest impact was felt in the spice islands of Ternate and Tidore. Features in the oldest mosque in the islands, such as the Sultan's Mosque of Ternate, imitate feature in the oldest Javanese mosques. However, mosques in Maluku lack a peristyle, terrace, courtyard and gate, but retain the multi-tiered roof and centralized ground plan of Javanese mosques. The region of Papua contains few significant mosques, as the region is largely Christian.

Aftermath  Frederick died on August 19, 1493. As per custom, Maximilian took the title King of the Romans on his father's death; the title Holy Roman Emperor was traditionally bestowed by the pope in Rome. In 1489, Pope Innocent VIII, in conflict with Ferdinand I of Naples, king of Naples, over Ferdinand's refusal to pay feudal dues to the papacy, had excommunicated and deposed him by a papal bull of September 11. Innocent then offered Naples to the king of France Charles VIII of France, who had a remote claim to its throne because his grandfather, Charles VII of France, had married Marie of Anjou of the House of Valois-Anjou, the ruling family of Naples at the time of their marriage in 1422. Innocent later settled his quarrel with Ferdinand and revoked the bans before dying in 1492, but the offer to Charles remained an apple of discord in Italian politics. Ferdinand died on January 25, 1494, and was succeeded by his son Alfonso II of Naples.Mallett and Shaw (2012), p. 14 On March 16, 1494, Maximilian married Bianca Maria Sforza. In October he granted her uncle, Ludovico Sforza, the ducal title in Milan. Ludovico Sforza's title was immediately challenged by Alfonso, who also had a claim to it. To answer this threat, Ludovico Sforza invited Charles to take up Innocent's offer. The French invasion sparked a series of conflicts, the Italian Wars, among the states in Italy which made it impossible for Maximilian to travel to Rome. On February 4, 1508 at Trento, he claimed for himself the title of Electus Romanorum Imperator, Elected Roman Emperor, which was subsequently accepted on February 12 by Pope Julius II. Subsequent electees retained the right to call themselves Holy Roman Emperor without being crowned by the pope.

It took place in Frankfurt on the 28th of June.  Background  The election followed the death of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor on January 12, 1519. There was no German contender; the two main candidates were Charles, duke of Burgundy, king of Spain and archduke of Austria, and Francis I of France, king of France. Henry VIII of England, king of England, entered himself as a candidate as well. Although Charles was head of the House of Habsburg after the death of his grandfather Maximilian, he had grown up in the Burgundian low countries, stayed in Spain at the time of the election, and spoke French rather than German. He was thus felt to be as much of a foreigner as Francis. While electing an emperor who was also the ruler of a foreign power had not happened since the king of Sicily Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor was elected in 1212, France and the Empire had not been joined since the days of the Carolingian dynasty. The seven prince-electors called to elect Maximilian's successor were: * Albert of Brandenburg, elector of Mainz * Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads, elector of Trier * Hermann of Wied, elector of Cologne * Louis II of Hungary, king of Bohemia * Louis V, Elector Palatine, elector of the Electoral Palatinate * Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, elector of Electorate of Saxony * Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg, elector of Brandenburg Charles could count on the vote of Louis II, who was married to his younger sister Mary of Hungary. He and Francis competed to exceed one another in their bribery of the remaining electors.  Elected  Charles in the end had deeper pockets. Francis had bought the elector of Trier; up for grabs were the electors of Mainz, Brandenburg and the Palatinate. Although full details of the election were never revealed, it is possible that the electors sought a way out of their dilemma by electing Frederick III as emperor, but that he turned them down. In the end, Charles was elected unanimously, though with some misgivings by the elector of Brandenburg. He was crowned at Aachen on October 26, 1520. Charles was also able to win, as he used the threat of military force from the Swabian League- formed in 1488, that was sympathetic towards Charles' Habsburg background. Charles underwent a relentless propaganda campaign in which he shifted the narrative to claim his heritage as a German, as well as being the grandson of Maximilian (previous Holy Roman Emperor), was of substantial reason to elect him as Holy Roman Emperor. Coining the phrase:'German by blood and stock.' Consequentially presenting him as obtaining 'German sympathies', making his election more attractive. At the same time, Charles' superiority caused his competitor Francis, to become nothing more than a 'foreign adventurer', fostering fears of foreign interference in German affairs. In contingency with this notion, Charles was also the ruler of other states in Spain and the Netherlands, therefore, it was less likely that he would impose his personal ambitions as he would be pre-occupied on his other affairs. Such displacement, made election that much more attractive than his competition.  Aftermath  Charles was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Clement VII in Bologna on February 22, 1530. He was the last emperor to accept the papal coronation. 1519 1519 in Europe ","title":"1519 Imperial election"},{"id":"55856065","text":"The imperial election of 1531 was an imperial election held to select the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.

On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther, a professor of moral theology at the University of Wittenberg, now part of the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, had delivered the Ninety-five Theses to Albert of Brandenburg, the elector of Mainz. This list of propositions criticized the practice of selling indulgences, remissions of the punishment meted out for sin in Purgatory. Luther's criticism snowballed into a massive schism in the church. In 1527, John, Elector of Saxony, the elector of Saxony, established a Lutheran state church in Saxony with the elector as chief bishop. The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor called for the election of his successor. The prince-electors called to Cologne for this occasion were: * Albert of Brandenburg, elector of Mainz * Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads, elector of Trier * Hermann of Wied, elector of Cologne * Ferdinand, younger brother of Charles and king of Bohemia * Louis V, Elector Palatine, elector of the Electoral Palatinate * John, Elector of Saxony, elector of Saxony * Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg, elector of Brandenburg John remained the only Protestant. Hermann, though a bishop, showed reforming tendencies, and would eventually be deposed from his episcopate in 1546. The remaining electors were strongly pro-Catholic. Charles had called the election by the terms of the Habsburg compact of 1521-1522 signed with his younger brother Ferdinand, according to which he was expected to call for an Imperial election after he was crowned by the Pope. The coronation took place in 1530, and Charles convoked the seven princes to elect Ferdinand. Election and aftermath  Ferdinand was elected King of the Romans in the city of Cologne. Charles continued to be Holy Roman Emperor for over 25 years. In 1550, he regretted the election as he realized that it would have led to the division of the House of Austria between his son Philip II of Spain and Ferdinand. He therefore pacted with his family in 1551 that Philip was the successor of Ferdinand. Charles also tried to arrange political marriages to maintain the unity of the Habsburgs. However, Charles V abdicated on August 27, 1556. The Imperial Diet accepted his abdication on May 3, 1558. Ferdinand was crowned at Frankfurt. Philip did not succeed Ferdinand. His successor, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor and son of Ferdinand, was chosen during his reign in the imperial election of 1562. The electors, fearing the instability that would have resulted in having an absentee Spanish-speaking emperor born in Valladolid, had lobbied instead for Maximilian.

In 1527, John, Elector of Saxony, the elector of Saxony, established a Lutheran state church in Saxony with the elector as chief bishop. On February 27, 1531, John joined Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, the landgrave of Hesse, in establishing the Schmalkaldic League, a defensive military alliance of Lutheran principalities in which each pledged to support the other in the event of an attack by the forces of the Holy Roman Empire. In time Anhalt, W√ºrttemberg, Pomerania, Augsburg, Frankfurt, Kempten, Brandenburg and the Electoral Palatinate were added to the League. In view of the preparations of the emperor, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor to suppress them, the members of the League launched a preemptive attack on his forces at the Catholic city of F√ºssen on July 10, 1546. The ensuing war led to the defeat and dissolution of the Schmalkaldic League. It led also to the 1547 Capitulation of Wittenberg, according to which John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony was compelled to cede the electorate to his cousin Maurice, Elector of Saxony, the first member of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin to hold it. = Cuius regio, eius religio = On May 15, 1548, Charles issued the Augsburg Interim. Intended as a compromise between the Catholic empire and its Protestant princes and subjects, it permitted the marriage of Protestant clergy and the receipt by the laity of communion under both kinds. However, it also ordered the readoption among Protestants of Catholic practices including the seven sacraments. Domestic pressure from the Protestant subjects of the empire led to the offer of additional concessions in the Leipzig Interim in December, and finally to more violence. On January 15, 1552 a coalition of Protestant princes of the Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Chambord with the French king Henry II of France, inviting him to occupy the Three Bishoprics of Metz, Verdun and Toul in exchange for military assistance against Charles. The renewed conflict was ended by the Peace of Passau of August 1552, which revoked the Augsburg Interim, and by the Peace of Augsburg of September 1555, which permitted princes of the empire to establish Lutheranism or Catholicism as their state religions. = Election of 1562 = Charles was succeeded by his brother Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor upon his official abdication in 1558.

By 1600, the elector of the Electoral Palatinate was Calvinist and the electors of Saxony and Brandenburg were Lutheran. = Bohemian Revolt = Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Hungary and Bohemia, was Catholic. In 1600 he was engaged in the Long Turkish War, which had drained the resources of his kingdoms and of the empire since 1593. On December 28, 1604, following military reverses and an economic crisis in Hungary, the Hungarian nobleman Stephen Bocskai launched a revolt. The Bocskai uprising lasted until 1606 and put additional pressure on Rudolf's resources. It was in this situation that Rudolf was forced to grant the Letter of Majesty in 1609, allowing the free practice of Protestant religions in Bohemia and creating a Bohemian Protestant state church run by the Protestant estates. In 1617, Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor, by now Holy Roman Emperor and king of Hungary and Bohemia, arranged for the election of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor as his successor in Bohemia under the terms of the O√±ate treaty. The fiercely Catholic Ferdinand II had suppressed Protestantism on his lands in Styria and had repudiated the Letter of Majesty. When, in 1618, Ferdinand II sent his representatives, Vil√©m Slavata of Chlum and Jaroslav Bo≈ôita of Martinice, to Prague to administer the government, they were thrown from the third floor of Prague Castle by members of the dissolved Protestant estates. = Election of 1619 = On August 26, 1619, the estates of Bohemia deposed Ferdinand II and elected Frederick V of the Palatinate, elector of the Electoral Palatinate, as king. Frederick accepted. Nonetheless, the other electors refused to hear an embassy of the Bohemian estates and confirmed Ferdinand II as Bohemian king and elector, with only the Palatine delegation objecting.

On August 26, 1619, the full Bohemian estates declared Ferdinand II deposed. They offered the throne to Frederick V of the Palatinate, elector of the Electoral Palatinate, who accepted. Ferdinand II called on Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, duke of Bavaria and leader of the Catholic League, a political confederation-cum-military alliance, for help suppressing the Bohemian Revolt and removing Frederick.

He was opposed in these efforts by Charles Albert, elector of Bavaria. Charles Albert believed that he had a better claim, as he was a son-in-law of Charles VI's older brother Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor and a great-great-great grandson of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. Nevertheless, Francis tended to have greater support. Charles VI died on October 20, 1740. Maria Theresa, his daughter and Francis of Lorraine's wife, inherited his royal titles in Austria, Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, Transylvania, Mantua, Milan, Galicia and Lodomeria, the Austrian Netherlands and Parma, according to the terms of the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. = War of the Austrian Succession = Although Prussia had accepted the Pragmatic Sanction, it now repudiated Maria Theresa's inheritance as a violation of Salic law.

Background  Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor died on March 1, 1792. = French Revolution = Following the Seven Years' War and its support of the United States in the American Revolutionary War, the French government was deeply in debt. Its main source of income was a burdensome tax on its peasants which could not be much increased. As 1789 dawned, after years of bad harvests, it stood at the brink of a financial and social crisis. In order to resolve the crisis, the king, Louis XVI of France, called the Estates General of 1789 on January 24. The Estates General quickly became mired in disputes over the representation of the various estates. On June 17, after months of such disputes, the Third Estate, representing the common people, declared itself the National Assembly. On June 20, the National Assembly swore not to disperse until they had established a constitution. The dismissal of the Controller- General of Finances Jacques Necker, seen as sympathetic to the Third Estate, and the gathering of the army outside Paris led to fears that the National Assembly and its supporters among the people were soon to be crushed. In response, a bourgeois militia, the National Guard, was spontaneously established on July 13. On July 14, the National Guard stormed the Bastille, a prison and armory, and killed its defenders. On July 15, the army outside Paris withdrew to its garrisons. The capital would never return to effective royal control. During the night of June 20, 1791, the king and his wife, Leopold's sister Marie Antoinette, fled Paris in an attempt to meet counterrevolutionary troops at Montm√©dy. They were recognized and arrested on June 21 at Varennes-en-Argonne. On August 27, Leopold and Frederick William II of Prussia, king of Prussia, issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, calling for the release of Louis and Marie Antoinette and promising that, if his safety was threatened, and with the support of the other monarchs of Europe, they would go to war to restore him. The National Assembly interpreted the declaration as a declaration of war against the revolutionary government. On April 20, 1792, it declared war on Leopold's son Francis, his successor as king of Hungary, Croatia, and Bohemia. = Election of 1792 = The prince- electors called to choose Leopold's successor were: * Friedrich Karl Joseph von Erthal, elector of Mainz * Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, elector of Trier * Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria, elector of Cologne * Francis, king of Bohemia * Charles Theodore, elector of Bavaria * Frederick Augustus I, elector of Saxony * Frederick William II of Prussia, elector of Brandenburg * George III of the United Kingdom, elector of Brunswick-L√ºneburg  Elected  Francis was elected. He was crowned as Francis II in Frankfurt on July 14.  Aftermath  On September 20, a Prussian army advancing on Paris was stopped at the Battle of Valmy, the first significant victory for the French revolutionary government. On August 23, 1793, that government issued a decree calling for a lev√©e en masse, the conscription of all able-bodied men between eighteen and twenty-five years of age. The dramatic increase in French manpower and the tactical brilliance of the brigadier general Napoleon, who saw his first major action as an artillery commander in the Siege of Toulon that same year, led to increasing military success. By the end of 1794, France had conquered the territories of the Holy Roman Empire west of the Rhine. Prussia recognized these conquests and withdrew from the first coalition against France in the secret Peace of Basel of April 5, 1795. On February 9, 1801, France and the Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Lun√©ville, under which the latter recognized French conquests up to the Rhine as well as the independence of a number of French client states. The Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, passed by the Imperial Diet on March 24, 1803 and ratified by Francis on April 27, reorganized the Empire in recognition of the territorial changes under the treaty. The electorates of Mainz, Trier and Cologne were abolished. Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg, archbishop and prince-elector of Mainz, was created archbishop and prince-elector of Regensburg. Mainz's territory east of the Rhine was divided among Regensburg, Hesse-Darmstadt, Prussia and the counties of what would become the Duchy of Nassau. Trier's territory east of the Rhine was also divided among the counties of Nassau. Cologne's territory east of the Rhine was divided between Hesse-Darmstadt and Arenberg. Francis's younger brother Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, deprived of Tuscany in the course of the French Revolutionary Wars, was created elector of Salzburg. The Duchy of W√ºrttemberg, the Margraviate of Baden and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel were raised to the electorates of W√ºrttemberg, Baden and Hesse, respectively. Hostilities between France and Francis II broke out again in 1805. Following Napoleon's historic victory over Russia and the Holy Roman Empire at the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, the latter was forced to conclude the Peace of Pressburg on December 26. Under the terms of this treaty, Francis II recognized the royal titles of the kings of Bavaria and W√ºrttemberg, and ceded to Napoleon's allies in Bavaria, W√ºrttemberg and Baden substantial Austrian territories in Germany. He also ceded some Austrian land south of the Alps to Italy, a client of Napoleon. On July 12, 1806, Baden, Bavaria, Berg, Hesse, Regensburg and W√ºrttemberg established the Confederation of the Rhine, with Napoleon as its protector. On August 1, they seceded from the Holy Roman Empire. On August 6, Francis resigned as emperor and declared the Empire dissolved. 1792 1792 elections 1792 in Europe ","title":"1792 Imperial election"},{"id":"55856093","text":"Bohum√≠r Zh√°≈àal (17 October 1931 - 16 April 2020) was a Czech middle-distance runner.

Description Prasophyllum incompositum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped, dark green leaf which is long and wide near its reddish base. Between five and thirty fragrant, greenish-brown and white flowers are untidily arranged along a flowering spike which is long. The flowers are wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, about wide and the lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and white with a dark central stripe. The labellum is oblong to egg-shaped, long, about wide, turns sharply upwards near its middle. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum are very ruffled and there is a thin, green, fleshy callus in its centre. Flowering occurs in August and September. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum incompositum was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Carnarvon National Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research.

While the name \\"Ebora\\" indicates a Celtiberian hill top fortification in the area of the later municipia or in its vicinity the first archaeological evidence of a settlement is from the Early Roman Empire. Early Roman activities on the Iberian peninsula were limited to the areas previously partially populated by Greeks and Punic areas along the south and east coast. The area of today's Alentejo probably did not come under Roman control until the middle of the 2nd century BC. The name addition \\"Iulia\\" in the Roman name √âvoras infers the emergence of the municipium under the Julians and their representative Gaius Iulius Caesar. But since clear traces of extensive infrastructures from this time and in the surrounding area are missing, it is considered more probable that √âvora only came into being as a municipium after the Pax Romana under Octavian in 30 BC. The suffix \\"Liberalitas Iulia\\" should be interpreted in this context as an indication of peace. The first reference to √âvora as a municipium is found in a list of cities in Hispania in the Historia Naturalis of Pliny the Elder to the year 77 A.D. Plan of Ebora Liberalitas Julia  Temple of √âvora See Roman Temple of √âvora Thermes Part of the Roman thermal baths is located in the basement of today's town hall. They are located about 100 meters west of Forum Square and about 10 meters below its level. Today, about 250 m¬≤ of the original building complex are covered. The preserved floor plans of the premises suggest a north/south orientation of the building. Among other things preserved is the laconicum. This round room with a diameter of 9 m has four semicircular apse extensions for hot baths and steam baths. In the centre of the room is a circular basin with a diameter of 5 m, which could be entered via three steps, which are embedded in the ground. For the walls of the laconicum two different building methods were used. From the foundation to the height of the floor, heat- resistant opus incertum was used to build the hypocaust. Opus latericium was used for the masonry rising from the floor. The central basin was probably lined with marble slabs on the wall side and the floor was sealed with opus signinum. City walls The Portas de Mouro rests on the foundations of a Roman city gate The Roman walls were probably built in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD. In this period parts of the country were retreating to a shrinking urban area as the Empire declined. This is evident in the overbuilding of parts of the former Roman residential buildings by the wall in the southwest of the municipia on today's Rua de Burgos. Raids of Germanic tribes on Roman territory probably led to an increased need for security and the construction of defenses. The lower parts of the still preserved wall consist of opus quadratum, from hewn granite blocks. The edge length of some still recognizable, square tower foundations corresponds with 4.5 m length or ten times a Roman cubitus. Even parts of the granite cuboid used correspond in height to a cubitus. An origin in Roman times is therefore shown. The wall had a total length of between 1.1 and 1.2 km and covered the central part of the city hill. The built-up area was about 10 hectares and included important public buildings such as the Forum and the thermal baths. Even after the disintegration of the Roman Empire and the seizure of power in the region, first by the Visigoths and after 711 the Moors, the wall probably continued. In 913, the already damaged city wall was partially destroyed and rebuilt in 914 on the remaining parts. Later in the Middle Ages, the wall was still used as a city wall or inner walls and adapted several times and rebuilt. Especially good are parts of the original wall are visible in the area of today's Rua do Col√©gio in which the wall is adjacent to a park. Economy Pliny refers to Ebora Cerealis in reference to Alentejo being a region of vast open countryside with undulating plains and rich fertile soil producing wheat and other Roman staples, including wine. The Sao Domingos Mine produced gold and silver and copper. (Iberia or modern Spain and Portugal, was one of if not the richest Roman province in the case of mineral ore from around the first century BC).

M., K. M. G.). He was also a translator and educator, as well as a Catholic priest. A long-term chairman of the ≈Ωiburys Society, Gustaitis worked to establish Lithuanian schools and advocated girls' education. He worked as principal of girls' pro-gymnasium in Marijampolƒó and coed gymnasium in Lazdijai. Biography Gustaitis was born Pajiesys near Garliava, but grew up in Rokai near Panemunƒó, Kaunas. He studied at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium (1881‚Äì1886) and Sejny Priest Seminary. In 1893, he was ordained priest and worked in Marijampolƒó. He continued studies at the , Pontifical Gregorian University and Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare in Rome. At the University of Fribourg he defended his PhD thesis on orientalist influences in works, particularly The Crimean Sonnets, of poet Adam Mickiewicz. Gustaitis returned to Lithuania in 1904 and worked as teacher of religious studies at the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium. After the Russian Revolution of 1905, various Russification policies were relaxed and it became possible to establish Lithuanian societies. In January 1906, priest Justinas Staugaitis organized the ≈Ωiburys Society to establish and maintain various Lithuanian schools in the Suwa≈Çki Governorate (Suvalkija). However, Staugaitis was soon reassigned to Lekƒóƒçiai and Gustaitis became the long-term chairman of ≈Ωiburys. One of the major achievements of the society was establishment of the girls' pro-gymnasium in Marijampolƒó in 1907 of which Gustaitis was principal. He was a vocal advocate of girls' education. Twice Gustaitis petitioned the government of the Congress Poland for a permission to elevate the school to the gymnasium status but was refused. In 1914, he traveled to United States to collect donations from Lithuanian Americans for a construction of school buildings in Marijampolƒó, but the plans failed due to the outbreak of World War I. His first poetry books were printed in United States at that time. At the start of the war, Gustaitis evacuated to Yaroslavl together with the Marijampolƒó Gymnasium. There, he helped organizing seven primary schools and a coed pro-gymnasium. He returned to Lithuania in 1918 to become the principal of the newly established gymnasium in Sejny. However, the town was at the center of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War and the gymnasium evacuated to Lazdijai. He continued to head the gymnasium until his sudden death in 1927. Since 1995, the gymnasium bears his name. In 1990, his former home was turned into a memorial museum. Works Cover of The Conversion of Lithuania by Alexander Navrotsky translated by Gustaitis (1927) Gustaitis's published works could be divided into three general categories: original poetry, translations, and non- fiction texts on issues of literature and culture. His poetry and articles were published in numerous Lithuanian-language periodicals, including Ateitis, Tƒóvynƒós sargas, Vairas, Viltis, Vilniaus ≈æinios. He also edited and published five issues of the ≈Ωiburys magazine which reported on the activities of the ≈Ωiburys Society and discussed issues of Lithuanian education. Gustaitis started writing poetry in 1893. His first book of poetry Tƒóvynƒós a≈°aros (Tears of the Motherland) came out in 1914 in Chicago. It was followed by Er≈°kƒóƒçi≈≥ taku (On the Path of Thorns, 1916), Sielos akordai (Chords of the Soul, 1917), and Varpeliai (Little Bells, 1925). He also wrote cantata Broliai (Brothers; music by ƒåeslovas Sasnauskas), oratorio Aureolƒó (Aureola; combines patriotic feelings with religious mysticism), poem Meilƒó (Love; an allegoric tale of self-sacrifice), and four-part musical drama Gaustas ir Zapsƒó (unpublished). A comprehensive collection of his works was prepared in 1940, but it was not published due to World War II. Literary critics often found his poetry to be heavy, cold, lacking emotions, and struggling with metre. His poetry is a deep reflection on abstract idealism (represented as heaven, cosmos, sky, abstract references to the divine) and harsh reality as well as a reflection of patriotic love for the homeland. Gustaitis was fond of classical Greek and Roman texts and translated some of them into the Lithuanian language, including various works by Virgil (second book of Aeneid), Cicero (Catiline Orations), Horace (several poems), Ovid, Demosthenes. He also translated Latin poetry of Italian Renaissance poet Petrarch and Polish Baroque poet Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski. He translated works by Adam Mickiewicz (The Crimean Sonnets and Dziady) and Juliusz S≈Çowacki (Anhelli) from Polish, and works by Alexander Navrotsky (The Conversion of Lithuania) and Jurgis Baltru≈°aitis from Russian. The first translations of Charles Baudelaire's poetry into Lithuanian also belong to Gustaitis. His acclaimed textbook on the theory of literature Stilistika came out in 1923. In 1919, he published a book on his observations of the American education system that he made during his trip in 1914. He also published biographical works on Lithuanian priests Antanas Tatarƒó, Juozapas Galeckas, Petras Kriauƒçi≈´nas, Latin poet Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, Lithuanian patriarch Jonas Basanaviƒçius, Roman Emperor Julius Caesar.

Background and Siege Zorsines had been aiding Mithridates III in his war against his brother Cotys I since 40 AD. The Mithridatic faction had been losing, having lost Artezian to the Roman forces sometime in 45 AD. The siege began after Aorsi commander Eunones crossed the river Panda and noticed that the stronghold had weak defenses that he could use in his favor. Eunones constructed towers to harass the people of the city with darts and arrows to soften their defenses and force them to expedite their surrender. After not being able to take no more, the people of Uspe offered a capitulation of 10,000 hostages, to which the Aorsi declined. The siege in total would have begun and finished within one day if nightfall had not stopped the conflict. Not being able to hold out against the Aorsi for too long, Zorsines sued for peace and acknowledge the superiority of Claudius. After Mithridates learned of his ally's defeat, he also sued for peace as he found his troop numbers not sufficient to continue the war.

He was consecrated on February 6, 2018. The Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City has 81,000 Catholics, 95 parishes and 15 missions.  Science in the Seminary  Bishop McKnight is part of the planning team for a project funded by the John Templeton Foundation at John Carroll University to re- engage science in the seminary. The team states their efforts will ‚Äúallow Roman Catholic seminarians and clergy to engage the bigger questions of science that are naturally a part of theological inquiry and pertinent to contemporary Christians who live in a world deeply influenced, if not dominated, by science and technology.‚Äù  Diaconate Knowledge: Author, Teacher, Speaker  McKnight wrote a dissertation on the permanent diaconate under the guidance of Father James Puglisi, a Franciscan Friar of the Atonement and the director of the Ecumenical Center in Rome studying sacramental theology. The Deacon Reader and The Newman Review have published some of McKnight‚Äôs diaconate writings. The NADD, the National Diaconate Institute for Continuing Education and other diaconate programs have invited McKnight to be a speaker at their gatherings. In 2005, McKnight taught a class at the Pontifical College Josephinum in Ohio called ‚ÄúThe Latin Rite Deacon‚Äù. St. Meinrad Permanent Deacon Formation Program in Indiana had a class called ‚ÄúTheology of the Deacon‚Äù instructed by McKnight from 2005 to 2010. He is the author of Understanding the Diaconate.Understanding the Diaconate: Historical, Theological, and Sociological Foundations (Washington DC: The Catholic University of America Press, 2018) The book is published by the Catholic University of America Press and states, ‚ÄúUnderstanding the diaconate adds the resources of sociology and anthropology to the theological sources of scripture, liturgy, patristic era texts, theologians, and magisterial teachings to conclude that the deacon can be understood as \\"social intermediary and symbol of communities\\" who serves the participation of the laity in the life and mission of the Church. This research proposes the deacon as a servant of the bond of communion within the Church (facilitating the relationship between the bishop or priest and his people), and between the People of God and the individual in need.‚Äù * Catholic Church hierarchy * Catholic Church in the United States * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States * List of Catholic bishops of the United States * Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops References External links *Profile on Roman Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City 1968 births Living people People from Wichita, Kansas American Roman Catholic bishops Roman Catholic bishops of Jefferson City Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita Catholics from Kansas 21st-century Roman Catholic bishops ","title":"Shawn McKnight"},{"id":"55856606","title":"Aleksandar Seksan"},{"id":"55856615","text":"Zinaida Krutikhovskaia (16 October 1916 ‚Äì 28 December 1986) was a Russian-born Ukrainian geophysicist who specialized in geomagnetism.

The park features picnic areas, three tennis courts, volleyball court, basketball courts, playgrounds, and fishing in Willow Creek. History Prior to being a park, this land had been a part of A.T. Parker's farm since 1874. It was utilized as pasture land and because of its proximity to the Union Pacific railroad tracks, Parker allowed it to be used as a circus grounds. His widow and a daughter, Martha J. Parker and Belle Parker Jackson, donated the land to Mason City for a park in 1939. It has been used for that purpose ever since. The park was developed from 1939 to 1941 by the National Youth Administration (NYA), a Depression-era relief program that provided part-time work and job training to young men and women. It is a rare example of a park that was developed in its entirety by the NYA in Iowa. The plan for the park's development was created by Cedar Rapids landscape architect Floyd W. Sapp. Development was limited as the Parker's wanted the park to be kept in a natural state. The NYA began by clearing brush and poison ivy from the park.

Raised in Honduras, she moved with her husband to the United States in 1882 and assisted him with the bi- lingual school he established in Central Valley, New York. When her husband was elected as the first president of Cuba, after the country gained independence from Spain, she served as the inaugural First Lady. During her husband's second term in office, he resigned and she moved with him to the Cuban countryside to run an agricultural estate. Upon his death, she returned to the United States. Her image was depicted on a 1956 postage stamp issued by the Honduran Postal Service. Early life Mar√≠a Genoveva de Jes√∫s Guardiola Arbiz√∫, called Veva, was born on 30 July 1858, in Comayagua, Honduras to Ana Mateo Arbiz√∫ Flores and Honduran President Jos√© Santos Guardiola Bustillo. In 1878, she met Tom√°s Estrada Palma, who had been invited to come to Honduras and serve as postmaster general. Estrada, a Cuban national, was a participant in the independence struggle of Cuba from Spain and was arrested and sent to prison in Spain in 1877, he was released and sent to the United States. Estrada, took up residence with his cousin, the poet Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Palma in Tegucigalpa, across the street from the widow Arbiz√∫ de Guardiola and her five daughters. The widow often hosted musical evenings with her daughter, Galatea playing the piano. A romance developed between 45-year-old Estrada and 23-year-old Veva and they were married on 15 May 1881 and had their first child, Jos√© Manuel, the following year. The band of Cuban exiles who had been living in Honduras began going their separate ways at this time, and the young family left the country in 1882, settling in Central Valley, New York. Career Arriving in New York, Estrada found backers and began a Spanish language/English language school, the Estrada Palma Institute. The school taught primarily Argentine, Cuban, Honduran and Mexican immigrants, but also had American students. Estrada ran the school and Guardiola took care of their growing family, which included Tomas Jr. (born ca. 1884), Candelaria (born ca. 1888), twins Carlos and Luz (born ca. 1894) and Raphael (born ca. 1896). Because Estrada was near New York City, where Jos√© Mart√≠ was continuing activities to gain Cuban independence from Spain, Estrada was often absent, consulting with Mart√≠. When Mart√≠ was killed in 1895, Estrada became the leader of the independence movement, leaving Guardiola to manage their affairs in Central Valley. At the end of the war in 1899, Estrada returned to the Central Valley to take over the reins of the school from his wife. Through encouragement of other generals in the war, Estrada was convinced to run for President of Cuba in the 1901 election. Despite his long residence in New York, he was elected, and Guardiola became the inaugural first lady of an independent Cuba. Accompanying Estrada to Cuba, the family attended his inauguration on 20 May 1902 and Guardiola hosted a massive ball with around 2,000 guests on 13 November 1902. Unless needed for state functions, Guardiola and the family lived separately at a residence in Cambria, a neighborhood two blocks from the Presidential Palace, where Estrada worked daily except on Sundays. He was elected for a second term of office in 1905 and served until his resignation on 28 September 1906. On 2 October 1906, the family left Havana by boat headed to Matanzas. They remained in Matanzas until mid-1907, when the family relocated to eastern Cuba to a farm Estrada owned in Bayamo. Selling the home in Central Valley, the entire family worked on the Valmar Plantation, with Guardiola and the daughters doing domestic chores, while the sons managed the farm production. Near the end of 1908, Estrada developed pneumonia and died on 4 November. Guardiola returned to the United States after his death. Death and legacy De Estrada Palma died on 30 December 1926, New York City, New York. Her image was depicted on a 1956 postage stamp issued by the Honduran Postal Service.

Biography  Alessandro Bonsanti, writer, was born in Florence. Very young, after completing his studies, he moved to work in Milan, where he worked for three years as an employee at a local bank, collaborating in the magazine La Fiera Literaria, where he published his first Brigants story in Maremma. Returning to Florence, he came into contact with the literary environment that animated Solaria (the European magazine, which existed from 1926 to 1936), who was a collaborator and director, publishing military narrative (1927) The loving servant (1929) and the whims of 'Adriana (1934), republished in distant Racconti 1962, texts of the past that have to do with a distant social history. In 1937 Bonsanti founded and assumed the direction of publishing at a magazine that collected the inheritance of Solaria, currently shutdown. In 1941 he took over as la direzione del Gabinetto scientif√¨co-letterario Vieusseux (Director of the Vieusseux Scientific-Literature Cabinet), left vacant by Eugenio Montale. This was a prestigious assignment that Bonsanti held with great willingness and firmness, making for almost forty years an untiring promoter of various cultural initiatives. During the war, he published two books: Dialoghi e altre prose (Dialogues and Other Prose) (1940) and Introduzione al gran viaggio (Introduction to the Great Trip) ( 1944 ). The following year he assumed the position of Director of Il Mondo, which he himself founded with Eugenio Montale and Arturo Loria. Other books to remember are: La vipera e il toro (1955) and cavalli di bronzo (1956). In recent years Bonsanti's interests were also addressed to active politics; in this period he was approaching the Republican Party of Spadolini and in 1983 was elected mayor of Florence, head of a pentapartito junta, which was not completed due to his death in 1984. His daughter Sandra, a journalist, was a member of the Republic. Alessandro Bonsanti is buried in the Cimitero delle Porte Sante in Florence. He was nominated for the Strega Prize.

It has a single tubular, dark green leaf and up to twenty scented, yellowish-green and reddish-brown flowers. The largest population occurs on a golf course. Description Prasophyllum incorrectum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped, dark green leaf which is long and wide near its reddish-purple base. Between ten and twenty fragrant, yellowish-green and reddish-brown flowers are arranged along a flowering spike which is long. The flowers are wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is linear to egg-shaped, long, about wide and the lateral sepals are linear to lance- shaped, long, about wide and sometimes joined, other times free from each other. The petals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and green with brown streaks. The labellum is broadly egg-shaped, long, about wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle, often reaching between the lateral sepals. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum are slightly wavy and there is a raised,fleshy green callus in its centre. Flowering occurs in October and November. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum incorrectum was first formally described in 2003 by David Jones from a specimen collected on the Campbell Town golf course and the description was published in Muelleria. The specific epithet (incorrectum) refers to the species having been previously described as included in Prasophyllum correctum. Distribution and habitat The golfer's leek orchid grows in moist grassland and in grassy places in woodland. It is only known from three populations in Campbell Town, the largest of which occurs on the local golf course. Conservation Prasophyllum incorrectum is listed as \\"Critically Endangered\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. The main threats to the population are land clearing and the conversion of native grassland to exotic species.

Edward Champlin includes him, along with Gaius Aufidius Victorinus and Gaius Arrius Antoninus, as \\"marked out as a special intimate of Fronto's.\\" Champlin notes that while Victorinus received five of the surviving letters of the rhetor Fronto, Julianus received four, adding that \\"in a fit of despair Fronto could consider Iulianus to be his only remaining friend\\".Champlin, Fronto and Antonine Rome (Cambridge: Harvard, 1980), pp. 34f Three of Fronto's surviving letters to him provide information about Julianus. The first (Ad Am. I.5) ostensibly is a letter of commendation on behalf of a young man named Calvisius Faustinianus for a post in Julianus' provincial army; but as Champlin notes, Fronto brushes aside all matters of Faustinianus' military skills to praise the young man's eloquence, challenging Julianus to test the man's judicial ability, and his literary taste. The next (Ad Am. I.19), which Champlin notes is difficult to read, \\"appears to treat of a literary quarrel with that eternal disciple, Aulus Gellius\\".Champlin, Fronto, p. 36 The third (Ad Am. I.20) concerns a provincial lawsuit, where Julianus has asked for Fronto's intervention; the letter mentions one Valerianus, whom Champlin identifies with a grammaticus who was the teaching colleague of Pertinax. Champlin offers other possible connections for Julianus.Champlin, Fronto, p. 154 n. 30 The Suda mentions that the sophist Damophilius was patronized by one Julianus who might be Claudius Julianus, although he has been identified with Didius Julianus.\\"ŒîŒ±ŒºœåœÜŒπŒªŒøœÇ\\", Suda website Another possible connection is with Herodes Atticus: in his Lives of the Sophists Philostratus mentions a letter Herodes wrote to a Julianus wherein he describes his slave nicknamed \\"Hercules of Herodes\\",Vita Sophistae, 552 although this Julianus has also been identified with an Antoninus Julianus from Hispania, whom Aulus Gellius recounts got the better of his opponents in a contest at a literary banquet over the quality of Greek versus Latin poetry.Attic Nights, xix.9  Imperial career  His cursus honorum is only imperfectly known.

The previous King of the Romans, Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, died on April 2, 1272 in Berkhamsted following a stroke he had suffered in December 1271. The seven prince-electors called to Frankfurt were: * Archbishop Werner II von Eppstein, Elector of Mainz * Archbishop Engelbert II von Falkenburg, Elector of Cologne * Archbishop Heinrich I von Finstingen, Elector of Trier * John and Albert II, co-dukes of Saxony as Saxon elector * Louis II, Elector Palatine * Ottokar II, King of Czechia and \\"usurper\\" duke of Austria * Otto V, Markgrave of Brandenburg To Frankfurt arrived the three archbishops and Elector Louis and * Albert of Saxony also as representative of his brother * Frederick III of Nuremberg as representative for Margraviate of Brandenburg However, strictly taken, Ottokar's marriage with the heiress of the Arch-Pincerna dynasty has already ended in annulment, Ottokar was holding as usurper her duchies the Carantanian territories, duchy of Styria and Austria.

There were 4 candidates: the favourites Rudolf, Count of Habsburg and Ottakar II of Bohemia (an elector himself), and lesser candidates Siegfried I, Prince of Anhalt and Frederick I, Margrave of Meissen.

Early Life TenBroek was born in Alberta, Canada in 1911. He was partially blind at the age of 7 due to an accident with a bow and arrow. His remaining eyesight deteriorated and he was completely blind by age 14. His mother decided to move the family to California so tenBroek could attend a state school for the blind. In 1934, tenBroek graduated from the University of California with a degree in history. He graduated with the highest honors. He went on to earn a master's degree in political science and a Bachelor of Laws and Doctor of Juridical Science degree from University of California Berkeley School of Law. He continued to review honors after graduation. He was on the California Law Review, a member of the Order of the Coif, and earned a Brandeis Research Fellowship with Harvard University. Career TenBroek served on the faculty of the Chicago Law School. California Governor Earl Warren appointed tenBroek to the California Social Welfare Board. During 1960-63 of his tenure on the Board, he was chairman. During his career, he published over fifty articles. His book, Prejudice, War and the Constitution, received the Woodrow Wilson Award. He was with the University of California at Berkeley for 25 years, from 1942 until his death. During that time, he became full professor in 1953 and chairman of the department of speech in 1955. Activism During his career, he focused on subjects that were not yet being written about by scholars. He brought attention to the field of welfare and raised awareness to the deprived citizens in society. He wrote scholarly material about the origins of the Thirteenth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. His book, The Antislavery Origins of the Fourteenth Amendment was cited by Thurgood Marshall in the Brown v. Board of Education case and regularly cited by the United States Department of Justice. His writings affected much scholarship and attention around civil rights law and welfare rights law. In 1934, he worked with a few others to organize the California Council of the Blind. In 1940 he began organizing the National Federation of the Blind. He later began organizing the International Federation of the Blind in 1964. He stood for academic freedom and opposed the loyalty oath in the 1950s. His 1958 book, critiqued the Supreme Court's decision regarding the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II. TenBroek was supportive of the Free Speech Movement, which was a student protest taking place on the University of California Berkeley campus, to support the freedom of students to protest or host other political activities on campus. TenBroek wrote in his 1966 article \\"The Right to Live in the World: The Disabled in the Law of Torts\\", that the doctrines in the law of torts be reviewed and revised to address the modern societal integration of disabled people into society. tenBroek Papers Throughout his life, tenBroek collected documentation about the early history of the National Federation of the Blind and the blind civil rights movement. After his death, his wife continued collecting papers for the collection, which is now housed at the Jacobus tenBroek Library within the Jernigan Institute. Research specialist at the Jacobus tenBroek Library, Lou Ann Blake, catalogued the collection. Printed, the collection took up thirty-five four-drawer file cabinets and four two-drawer file cabinets. Some of the more important documents are now archived in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room within the Jernigan Institute. Scholars have visited the collection to research activists in the blind civil rights movement, including Isabelle Grant and the first executive director of the National Federation of the Blind, Raymond Henderson. Some of the papers are personal correspondence of tenBroek with family, friends, jurists, authors, politicians, and members of Congress. Personal Life In 1937, tenBroek married Hazel Feldheym. Later, Feldheym served as associate editor of the journal the Braille Monitor. Together tenBroek and Feldheym had three children: Jacobus Zivnuska, Anna Carlotta (Hammond), and Nicolaas Perry.

He began his music career in 1942 at the age of eleven when he won a talent contest at the Community Theater in New Auburn, ME. He got his first guitar at this time and spent 75 years of his life entertaining throughout the South and Northeast.  Early years and military service  When Slim was six months old, his family moved to Auburn, ME, and he remained there until his mother died. In 1946, he then moved back to Dorchester, MA. After graduating from high school in 1948, Slim joined the U.S. Army and spent three years and three months in Germany where, in addition to his military service which included participating in the Berlin Airlift during the Blockade, he entertained the troops periodically on special assignments. After his honorable discharge from the Army, Slim married his high school sweetheart, fathered five sons and one daughter, and moved forward with his career as a country music performer with several groups in the southeastern Massachusetts area. One of his first gigs was in 1954 at \\"Nick's Place\\" on Nantasket beach in Hull, MA. From 1952 to 1954, Slim played at several churches with his friend and \\"button\\" accordionist, Victor Jenkins.  Career growth  In 1958 Slim formed the Berkshire Mountain Boys based in Brockton, MA. After 13 years there, he returned to Maine in 1971 and formed the Cumberland Valley Boys. In 1976 Slim established the State of Maine Country Music Awards Show with Gini Eaton of the Single Spur in Windham, ME. Together they started the Slim Andrews Enterprises Booking Agency. After the divorce from Slim's first wife, Pearl, Slim married Gini in 1979 and they continued to run the Single Spur and the booking agency together. The booking agency brought many Nashville acts to venues throughout New England and upstate New York, including clubs, fairs, and TV and radio shows. Some of the well known acts that Slim booked during this period included; Nat Stuckey, Grandpa Jones, Johnny Russell, Lee Golden of the Oak Ridge Boys, and Barbara Fairchild. It was also during this time that Slim put together an annual State of Maine Country Music All Star Review of Top Maine Talent that included other New England award-winning performers. In 1980, Slim was cited by the Maine Sunday Telegram as one of the most influential drivers of country music in Maine, along with two other Maine country music pioneers, Dick Curless and Al Hawkes. In the 1980s Single Spur was reinvented and reintroduced as the Silver Spur, a full-service restaurant, bar and club. In 1977, Slim and Gini, along with Barry Deane, founded the Maine Country Music Association with Slim becoming the acting president until regular officers were elected in July of that year. In early 1979, Slim approached Windham's representative to the state legislature, William Diamond, and asked him to sponsor a bill that would exempt club owners from having to pay an unemployment tax for part-time musicians that the musicians would never be able to collect. Slim's efforts in this matter paid off when the governor of Maine, Joseph E. Brennan, signed into law on April 13 legislation that ended this practice. On February 4, 1980, on Maine's NBC affiliate WCSH 6, Maine country music made its debut on the Tangents show hosted by Lew Colby. The Tangents show ran on Sundays at 11:15 p.m. In the fall of 1980, Slim Andrews and Bud Bailey helped to produce a one-hour show consisting of performances by the top four country bands appearing in Maine at the time. This show has been archived and is now available digitally. In 1985 the responsibilities of Slim's \\"day job\\" required that Slim and Gini and the kids move to Kalamazoo, MI, where they stayed until 1990. Slim went to Kalamazoo to open a general agency there through contacts he made as Director of Agencies for Texas-based American Income Life in Portland, ME (Day job hat). In a partnership with Harvey and Myrna Knapp, Slim was able to build a general agency in the Senior Insurance Market of Medicare Supplemental and Long Term Care Insurance. During this time in Kalamazoo, Slim's wife, Gini, got breast cancer and the move to a warmer climate in Savannah, GA in 1990 was made for Gini's sake. Savannah was chosen as their home for the next ten years because Gini loved it, and the demographics for senior citizens was ideal for Slim's continued service to the senior insurance market. While living in Michigan, Slim continued to appear with various country groups as a single entertainer, quite frequently with an old friend from Maine, Dale Bennett. They, in fact, performed for the Executive Board of the Michigan AFL/CIO in Harrison, MI. 1990 found the family relocating to Savannah, GA where Slim continued his music career. He created the American Legion Band in Savannah known as the \\"Country Vets,\\" which was an outreach program aimed at veterans in nursing homes and retirement communities. They returned to Maine in 2000, and in May 2001, Gini passed away after 14 years of fighting cancer.  Later years  In 2002, Slim was inducted into the Maine Country Music Hall of Fame and in this year he also married his present wife, Carole Ann. In 2004, Slim reprised \\"The Cumberland Valley Boys\\" with Vicki James. In May 2005, after 63 years in the country music business, Slim recorded and released his first album, \\"Favorites For A Lifetime,\\" consisting of eleven songs. Six of these songs are original songs written by Slim and his son, Jamie. The three songs that Slim wrote by himself deal with the changing seasons in his life; the birth of his son, Jamie, his marriage to Gini and her subsequent death, and his signature song, \\"The Autumn of Our Lives,\\" which tells of his marriage to his third wife, Carole Ann. Slim has recorded several albums and over 200 songs. In 2017 at the age of 86, Slim Andrews set an all time airplay record for a Maine country music artist. In addition to that, he also set a record for chart appearances by a Maine country music artist on the International Mainstream Country Music Charts. Slim is, and continues to be, the Chairman of the Induction Committee for the Maine Country Music Hall of Fame. He also serves on the Board of Directors for this organization. He continues to be a major spokesperson for the Maine Country Music Hall of Fame Museum which he helped to establish. The Maine Country Music Hall of Fame Museum is one of only a few museums of this nature in the entire country.

Several years ago he battled throat cancer. This condition altered Slim's voice and gave him a light rasp, but did not deter him from performing. He was recently diagnosed with colon cancer which at this time is not considered to be terminal. He currently performs between 75 and 100 shows a year.

Hon was the only member of Cambodian team for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, leading to criticism in the media as Cambodia has one of the highest proportions of disabled people worldwide at 8.9%. In previous years, the International Paralympic Committee had granted two wildcard places at the Paralympics to Cambodia, but for 2012 this was reduced to a place for a single woman. Hon's trainer, Phay Sok was frustrated at the level of equipment available to other nations. At the 2015 ASEAN Para Games in Singapore, Hon took part in both the T43/44 100 metres and the 200 metres. Although she took the lead initially in the 200 metres, she finished in fourth position. In the 100 metres, she took second place and the silver medal. She was running on blades designed for long distance running rather than sprinting. Personal life In 2011, Hon moved to Melbourne, Australia, where she has permanent residency. She works at an orchid nursery.

It was described as a new species in 2015. The IUCN evaluates it as a vulnerable species. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a result of a taxonomic split in the large-eared free-tailed bat, Otomops martiensseni. It was split from O martiensseni based on morphological and genetic data. It has a genetic distance from O. martiensseni of 2.10%. The authors chose the species name \\"harrisoni\\" after the late mammalogist David L. Harrison. Of Harrison, they wrote: \\"[his] numerous publications on Afro-Arabian Chiroptera, in particular the Molossidae, have significantly improved our knowledge of this poorly known family.\\" Description It is the largest member of its genus, and possesses the most robust skull. Males weigh between , while females weigh between . Its forearm length is . Its total body length is . Its tail is long; its hind foot is long; its ear is . Its dental formula is , for a total of 30 teeth. Its ears project over its face, meeting in the middle over its nose. It has a minute tragus. Around its lips are loose folds of skin. Males have a gular gland located at the base of their throats. Its hind feet are broad, with long white hairs. It can be differentiated from other members of its genus based on its long cranium and exceptionally high braincase. Its fur is short and velvety. On its back, the fur is dark chocolate brown; it has a \\"distinct cream-coloured collar\\" around its neck. Fur on its ventral side is lighter than its back. The edges of its body and of its wing membranes have a thin, but distinct, band of white fur. Biology It is insectivorous, feeding primarily on moths. Moth species in the Saturniidae, Noctuidae, and Geometridae families seem to be preferred. Males and females both reach sexual maturity at around one year of age and a body mass of . Females are monoestrous, with one breeding season per year. Pregnant females have been documented from October to January, though parturition occurs in December for the majority of females. Its litter size is one pup, born hairless and altricial. It is a colonial species, forming colonies consisting of hundreds or thousands of individuals; a colony of 15,000 once roosted in a cave in Mount Suswa, though they are now almost entirely gone from the cave. Range and habitat Its range includes Yemen, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya. It is most likely to occur in the eastern portion of Sub-Saharan Africa, also including Eritrea. Distribution modeling predicts that it prefers areas that receive at least of rain in the driest month, altitudes greater than above sea level, and locations with a total annual rainfall of less than . They have been documented in woodlands, shrublands, montane grasslands, xeric grasslands, and thickets. During the day, they roost in mountain caves or lava caves. Conservation It is currently evaluated as vulnerable by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because there have been extreme population declines located at two of its roosts from 1997-2017 (Mount Suswa cave and Ithundu cave). Disturbance of the caves that it uses as roosts is a major threat to the continued existence of this species. Caves are disturbed via mining for guano, tourism, caving, and blocking cave entrances.
