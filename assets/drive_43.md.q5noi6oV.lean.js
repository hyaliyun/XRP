Bingham (December 29, 1841 - February 18, 1877) was a 19th- century American writer, editor, and preceptress. She succeeded Phebe Ann Coffin Hanaford as the editor of the Ladies' Repository and the Myrtle, and was the last editor of the Ladies' Repository. Bingham was born in 1841. On January 1, 1843, her mother died, leaving the children to the care of their elder half-sister, Rosalie. Bingham was precocious, easily mastering her school studies. The summer she was fourteen, she taught school in the Belden district and at sixteen, attended school at South Woodstock, Vermont. Many of her school compositions were written in verse, \\"Farewell Sixteen,\\" \\"The Island of Dreams,\\" and \\"My Mother,\\" being of special mention. On leaving the academy, she spent three years in Boston, and in 1864, went to St. Lawrence University as preceptress. The next year, she wrote the prize story \\"Mignonette,\\" competing with such writers as Caroline Mehitable Fisher Sawyer and Jane Lippitt Patterson. In the spring of 1866, she married Rev. Henry Bingham, of Columbus, Wisconsin, who died the following autumn. In 1869, Bingham became editor of the Ladies' Repository, of the Universalist Publishing House of Boston. She was marked for succession with Sawyer, Julia Kinney Scott, Sarah Carter Edgarton Mayo, Eliza Ann Bacon Lathrop, and Nancy T. Munroe. During the five years that she conducted that magazine, she developed a notable literary record. Her specialty was verse, but she also demonstrated ability with essay, editorial, short story, and sketch. One of her best poems was \\"L'Envoi,\\" a midnight meditation on the passing year; \\"The Human Side\\" and \\"The Divine Side,\\" were her greatest work, easily placing her in the front rank with writers of her time. In 1875, her failing health compelled her to give up writing and return to her old home town, where she died in 1877. Early years Henrietta Adelaide Burrington was born in December 29, 1841. She was the youngest daughter of the second wife of Asahel Burrington of Caledonia County, Vermont. By the first marriage of the father there were three children, Rosalie Martha (Hall); Lindley Murray, a Universalist clergyman; and John Quincy Adams. By the second marriage, with Louisa Chapin Rice, there were four children, Howard Rice; Lorenzo Lester, Professor at Dean Academy; Solon Orville, a physician, who was the nearest brother in age; and Henrietta, the youngest. One year old when her mother died, Bingham became close to her half- sister. She was gentle and easily managed, and all went well for eight years, after which the father married. Soon after, the half-sister married and left home. Bingham never ceased pining for this sister. Education Bingham was a precocious child. She learned to read before she was five. She was always classed with those older than herself, and invariably stood at the head of her class. It was quite often, galling to her older brothers, who prided themselves on good scholarship, to have Bingham in their classes, and especially so when she had succeeded in solving some difficult problem, or unraveling some knotty construction in John Milton's Paradise Lost, which they had failed to fathom. When a child, she was a great reader, and eagerly read every book available to her. Indeed, reading was her greatest fault in those days, and she probably received more correction for reading while at work than for all other offenses put together; the greatest complaint of her step-mother was that \\"her head was always in a book.\\" Her opportunities for reading were not great. Her father, being a farmer, had but few books, and there was no public library in the town; so her only resort was borrowing from her neighbors, which she indulged in quite freely. At the age of 14, she taught at the Belden School. She was quite fond of teaching at this time in her life, and devoted a part of every year (the summer) to that work, until her school education was finished. It was during these years that she began to develop a literary talent. She amused herself during her leisure hours by writing little stories and sending them to her schoolmates to read, and occasionally wrote a little poem for their amusement. She was very shy in regard to these productions, and would never let any member of the family see them. At 16, she left home to attend Green Mountain College, at South Woodstock, Vermont. Her oldest brother, as he became of age, had taken a portion of his first year's earnings and gone there to school. He sent home such glowing accounts of the school, and entertained such high hopes of a liberal education, that Henrietta began to lay similar plans for her future. When the second brother was making arrangements to go to South Woodstock, she urged him to take her with him; and as she was not happy at home, and her father thought he could not help her any, her brothers determined to educate her, and she was sent to South Woodstock. Here she spent the happiest days of her life. She was a careful and earnest student, and took great delight in her work. Her early love for reading was here allowed full scope. Her progress was rapid and thorough, and she often astonished her teachers by the ease with which she could master the higher mathematics and the French language. She soon began to show unmistakable signs of literary ability. Here she wrote many pieces, both in prose and in verse, intended for school essays, but which afterward found their way into the public prints. Here also she formed the strongest attachments of her life. Being mature in thought, though young in years, she early became the intimate friend of her teachers, and came to be regarded by them as an equal, rather than a pupil. Career Henrietta A. Burrington Vermont After having completed the full course of study at the school in South Woodstock, she became its preceptress. During these terms, however, she began to feel that her line of duty did not lie in this direction. She had imbibed such a strong love for purely literary work that she determined to make that her occupation. Massachusetts Accordingly, in the Fall of 1862 she set out for Boston, determined to spend the following Winter there in some sort of literary occupation. She soon found employment in the Universalist Publishing House for a part of her time, and occupied the remainder in study. That Winter she was wont to consider the most profitable of her early life, because it gave to her the best opportunities. She embraced every occasion that came within her means to hear lectures, concerts, readings, and to attend gatherings of every type. She was very kindly received into Boston society. Ohio In Spring 1863, she received news from her half-sister, Mrs. Rosalie Hall, then living in Ohio, that her family was sick and needed her assistance. Upon reaching the sister's home, she found two of her four children very sick with typhoid fever, and their father in the Army of Tennessee, fighting battles during the American Civil War. Before the children had passed beyond the danger-point of their sickness, their mother became ill. Bingham, with the aid of neighbors and friends, nursed them to health. When Rosalie was convalescent, Binham was stricken with typhoid fever herself. Her illness was long and painful, her recovery was very slow, and her health was broken, never after becoming the strong and healthy woman that she was before. St. Lawrence University When the family had recovered, and her services were no longer needed, Bingham began to look around for some employment, as her sickness had greatly reduced her savings. She was very soon employed as preceptress of the preparatory department of St. Lawrence University, in which place she was a successful teacher. It was here that she formed the acquaintance which resulted in her marriage with Henry Lucius Bingham (1842-1866), March 29, 1866, a theological student in St. Lawrence University. Her husband was in feeble health at the time, and after five brief months, he died September 5, 1866. Her principal story, \\"Mignonette\\", was written in 1865. \\"The True Immortality\\", read at the first anniversary of the Zetagathean (seekers after truth) Society, of the Civinity School at Tufts College, was considered very able. Some time in the fall of 1868, the office of The Universalist and ladies' repository (later, Ladies' Repository), Boston, received the manuscript of a poem read before one of the literary societies of St. Lawrence University. When the poem was read, it was judged as having merit of uncommon sort. The interest awakened by this poem led to inquiries about the author, of whom the journal had heard little. The agent of the Publishing House informed the periodical's publisher that the author of the poem, Mrs. H. A. Bingham, was also the author of \\"Mignonette\\", one of the 'Prize Series' of stories published by the house. The publisher took up that little book for the first time, and found in it the same strong lines of power traced in the poem. Ladies' Repository Ladies' Repository (1870) Ladies' Repository (1872) Toward the close of 1868, Bingham, by invitation of the agent of the Publishing House, came to Boston, and in the January 1869, became editor of the Ladies' Repository. During the five years that she conducted that magazine, she made for herself a strong literary record. To a wide and high range of thought, she added delicacy, warmth and graceful humor. Her work on that periodical was of the best quality throughout. She was too conscientious to slight any part of it. The aggregate of her editorial labor was large. She resorted to no devices to fill space and save honest labor. It was during the comparatively brief period of her editorship that she made her record as a writer. Bingham was long acquiring the art and mastery which at length marked her out for succession in the line with Scott, Mayo, Bacon, Sawyer and Munroe. A manuscript volume, containing pieces written at intervals from the age of sixteen until she took charge of the 'Depository,' bears witness to the long and diligent preparation to which her powers were subjected. Mind history and heart history are here photographed by an unconscious artist, and we see, as we turn the leaves of the little book chosen for her girlhood rhymes, how her intellect opened and her faculty grew. The two marked traits of her maturest literary work, thoughtfulness and grace, appear very early. It was her good fortune that she did not make rhymes easily. Had she possessed the fatal facility of some young persons in emitting jingle, she might, like them, have been tempted into pouring out profusely a weak wash of metrical prattle, which can he called poetry only by the same license which allows sound to be called music or words eloquence. But her sense of precision and proportion kept back the flood. Like Lowell, most accurate and idiomatic of out poets, Mrs. Binghani never permitted her muse to run wild, but held it rigorously under the rein of understanding and disciplined taste. Thus it came to pass that her work bore the stamp of quality, and when at length professional duty exacted of her a large amount of literary labor, its uniform high merit provoked general surprise. During Bingham's years with the Ladies' Repository, she wrote much poetry which yet was not verse. Examples were \\"Autumnal Rain\\", \\"Spring\\", and \\"Under the Snow\\". In each of her longer poems there are strokes of power and strains of melody, prophetic of loftier achievement. Her poetic works included \\"The Human Side\\" and \\"The Divine Side\\". \\"On the Edge of the Sea\\", is a sample of her healthier mood. Such poems as \\"Compensation\\", \\"Divided\\", \\"Out of the Depths\\", and \\"Sunset\\", because the element of personal feeling compels sympathy. She was herself aware that so strong a tincture of personal moods, especially when they incline to melancholy, is an alloy of the true poetic quality. Referring to the volumes of the Ladies' Repository between 1869 and 1875 for full memorials of her work, her most characteristic and perfectly finished poem, \\"L'Envoi\\" was a midnight meditation on the passing year. Myrtle In two other departments of prose writing, newspaper correspondence and in story-telling for children, Bingham showed versatility. The charm and naturalness of both her stories and verses in the Myrtle a Universalist publication, during the period that she edited that juvenile, attracted the attention, and elicited the warm praise of hundreds of readers. Final years and death Representing Massachusetts, in October 1873, she was a member of the Executive Committee of the First Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Women. Bingham was enfeebled long before any outward sign appeared, but she persisted in her literary work until her strength was nearly spent, before she decided to go to the home of the parents of her husband, in Columbus, Wisconsin. She reached it March 12, 1875. No sudden change came, but a gradual decay commenced. Bingham grew weaker and weaker and died on February 18, 1877.

The college is affiliated to the University of Madras. It was established in the year 1972.  History  The birth of Dr. Ambedkar Government Arts College could be traced to the aspiring masses, an understanding state and a co-operative community. In the late sixties the clamour for an institution of higher education for the children of North Chennai was steadily increasing. So the Government of Tamilnadu, individual and corporate philanthropists and film stars joined hands with the common people of North Chennai to give a concrete shape to their dreams. Efforts commenced in 1971 when the Government of Tamilnadu located a huge lake lying South of Madras-Calcutta National Highway as the site for the proposed College. The significance of the role this College was going to play in future, is seen in the sharp contrast that marks its arrival from the birth of grandiose institutions. Though land was located, money needed to be raised. Now the Government set up a Fundraising Committee with the Madras District Collector at the helm. The Committee organized Benefit Matches where film- stars wielded the willow for the cause. Company philanthropy and common people together mobilized the Government stipulated sum of ‚Çπ5 lakhs (Rupees five lakhs only) and the first brick was laid on clayey soil on 01/08/1972. The then Hon'ble Minister for Harijan Welfare played a noteworthy role consistently. It must be recorded that the same aspirations of the people, which helped found the College in 1973, continue to inspire and guide the teachers and supporting staff of the College to this day.

He served as Minister of Agriculture in the Congolese government from August 1961 until July 1962 and then as Minister of Justice until December 1962. Weregemere later held prominent positions in parastatals and sat on the central committee of the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution from 1980 until 1985. Weregemere was born in Kivu Province, Belgian Congo. After studying with various Catholic institutions and taking courses in medicine, he entered the workforce, but frequently ran afoul of the colonial authorities for engaging in political activities. In 1958 he cofounded the Centre du Regroupement Africain (CEREA), a political party. He successfully expanded its influence and became its secretary-general, but continued to face challenges from the Belgian administration. In early 1960 he accused the leadership of CEREA of communist sympathies and created a splinter party. In the Congo's first free elections later that year Weregemere won a seat in the Chamber of Deputies. In August 1961 he was appointed Minister of Agriculture. In July 1962 Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula reorganised his government and Weregemere was made Minister of Justice. The appointment was not well received by the public, and following attempts by the Adoula Government to arrest members of Parliament, Weregemere was removed from his office by a motion of censure in the Chamber in December. During President Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu's tenure, Weregemere was given many board positions on various parastatals. In September 1980 he was inducted into the central committee of the state-sponsored party, the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution, where he served until his expulsion in 1985, allegedly for opposing a government appointment. He was thereafter banished to a remote farm in his home region and was restricted to leave to seek treatment for glaucoma. Following a measure of political liberalisation in the early 1990s, he reestablished CEREA and took part in the Conference Nationale Souveraine to discuss the restoration of democracy.  Biography   Early life  Jean-Chrysostome Weregemere was born on 5 September 1919 to a Muhavu family in Katana (near Kabar√©), Kivu, Belgian Congo. He received his primary education in Bukavu from Catholic missionaries until he was twelve. He then studied via correspondence at a minor seminary in Katanga for four years. He studied medicine for two years and at the age of 21 took up work as a clerk in the Bukavu court of justice. He remained there until he was drafted by the administration for service during World War II. Since he had engaged in political activity, the Force Publique refused to enlist him; he was assigned a role in the war production effort. In 1948 Werengemere was fired from his job for involvement in politics. Unable to find to work in the Congo, he moved his family to Ruanda-Urundi where he was hired by a small accounting firm. He eventually became the president of a small sports and cultural organisation. In 1956 Werengemere was expelled from Ruanda-Urundi for political activity and returned to Kivu. He threatened to turn his family (including seven children; he would have nine in total) over to the care of the colonial authorities unless they allowed him to find work. The administration in turn asked him to promise to abstain from politics. Weregemere gave them an ambivalent answer but nevertheless was able to become an accountant. In 1958 Bralima Brewery in Bukavu hired him as an agent.  Leader of CEREA  On 23 August 1958 Weregemere joined 11 other Congolese in forming the Centre du Regroupement Africain (CEREA) party. Party members nominated him as chairman of the sectional committee for Bukavu and as a member of the political bureau, and he was appointed secretary of peasant affairs. He then successfully established a CEREA chapter in Kasongo. In 1959 Weregemere became secretary-general of the party, and in that capacity he led CEREA's delegation to the Pan-African Movement for Eastern and Central Africa conference in Dar es Salaam. That year all 12 founders of CEREA were arrested but eventually released. In late October a nationalist party congress was convened in Stanleyville. Weregemere led the CEREA delegation and was elected vice-president of the conference. Civil unrest followed the congress and he was arrested and imprisoned. He was released in Stanleyville, where he was closely monitored for six weeks. In late 1959 municipal elections took place across the Congo and Weregemere's name was inserted into the lists for the Bukavu council election. He encouraged the public to boycott the elections, but his wife‚Äîtaking his place on the ballot‚Äîwas elected in December by a wide margin in his place. Weregemere attended the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in early 1960, but appeared later than the rest of the CEREA delegation. Upon his arrival he was disappointed to learn that the other delegates had employed a Communist adviser and endorsed federalism (contrary to the official party plank supporting a unitary system). In April Werengemere accused the president and vice-president of CEREA of harbouring Communist sympathies and organised his own moderate branch of the party, CEREA-Werengemere. It failed to secure the endorsement of CEREA's central committee and did not amass substantial popular support.  Government career  In the Congo's first elections later that year Weregemere earned a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, representing the South Kivu District on the Rassemblement de l'Est du Congo (RECO/REKO) party ticket with 2,721 preferential votes. He accompanied Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba on his trip to the United Nations Headquarters in July as his appointed Commissioner of Public Relations. In August he led Lumumba's economic delegation to the United States. He spent four weeks in the country, meeting with dozens of representatives of private organisations, foundations, banks, business firms, as well as United States government officials and delegates of the International Monetary Fund. In September 1960 relations between Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu broke down, creating a political impasse. Werengemere was placed on the parliamentary commission created to try and reconcile the two and acted as its spokesperson. In October he was made a member of a commission assembled by Lumumba tasked with managing his relations with the United Nations Operation in the Congo. Fearing for his life in the capital, L√©opoldville, amidst the declining political atmosphere, Weregemere fled to Bukavu on 9 January 1961. He was then detained, tortured by the local authorities, and imprisoned in Stanleyville. When Weregemere returned to L√©opoldville he was arrested. Shortly thereafter he was released to testify before a UN conciliation commission. He then went back to Stanleyville and became Minister of Information in the government of the rebellious Free Republic of the Congo, which tasked him with restoring order in Kivu in June. Following the Lovanium Conclave in July, a measure of reconciliation was reached between some of the Congo's major factions. On 2 August 1961 Weregemere was made Minister of Agriculture in Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula's new coalition government. From 23 September to 5 October he led an agricultural fact-finding mission to the Republic of China. In November he attended the 11th session of the Food and Agriculture Organization Conference in Rome. On 11 July 1962 Adoula reorganised his government and made Weregemere Minister of Justice. The appointment proved unpopular throughout the country, and there were fears in Bukavu that it would lead to the reemergence of a radical polity. In November the Adoula Government decreed a state of military rule and arrested four deputies on charges of plotting rebellion. The Chamber was furious; on 23 November the body forced the government to rescind its actions. Seven days later Weregemere submitted a request to the Chamber Bureau for authorisation to indict Deputy Christophe Gbenye on charges of subversion for allegedly appealing to President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana to send him troops to support his political activities. On 4 December a parliamentary committee was formed to investigate the claim. On 7 December it delivered its report to the Chamber, its members unanimously rejecting the allegation. That same day the Chamber called upon Weregemere to face a motion of censure for conducting arbitrary arrests of parliamentarians contrary to the constitution and thereby generating tension between Parliament and the government. Though he pointed out that the November arrests had been conducted by the Ministry of Interior, the motion was passed, 76 votes to four with four abstentions, and he was dismissed. The following year he led the Belgian delegation in negotiations on the Belgo-Congolese contentieux‚Äîlitigation concerning outstanding financial matters following decolonisation. On 30 May 1964 he was appointed the central government's Minister-Resident in Stanleyville to oversee the activities of the Orientale provincial government. He was relieved of his duties in July 1964.  Later life  Under President Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu's rule, Weregemere was appointed Administrator of Parastatal Companies, and Government Representative on the board of directors of Joint Ventures. He successively served as a member of the board of directors of the Office des Mines de Kilo Moto, managing director of the Office des Mines de Kilo Moto, managing director of the Office des transports au Congo, vice-chairman of the board of directors of the Institut de Gestion du Portefeuille in charge of the mining sector, and director general of the Soci√©t√© Africaine d'Explosifs. Weregemere joined the central committee of the state-sponsored party, the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution, on 2 September 1980. He served in its premier bureau as second vice-president. On 30 September 1985 he was expelled from the central committee. According to Weregemere, this was because he opposed the government's choice for a new mwami in Kabar√©. He was subsequently banished to a remote farm in Katana. Though by then he suffered from glaucoma, the government refused to allow him to undergo eye surgery. As a result, Amnesty International adopted him as a prisoner of conscience and called for his release. In the early 1990s Mobutu, after years of totalitarian rule, agreed to institute political reforms in the Congo. With the possibility of renewed elections in Kivu, Weregemere joined a former colleague in reestablishing CEREA. He also became president of the national committee of the Union des Sociaux Nationalistes. He participated in the subsequent Conference Nationale Souveraine as a member of the commission to oversee the national political transition towards democracy.

Different forms of treatment for children experiencing bereavement and or grief can help to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression, social adjustment, and posttraumatic stress. Research has shown that it is important to be aware of the difficulties in predicting how losing a closed one can impact a child‚Äôs emotionality and how their coping abilities will differ across ages and cultures.  Background  Across cultures the loss of a parent is consistently rated as one of the most difficult experiences that a child will endure.Yamamoto, K., Davis, O.L., Dylak, S., Whittaker, J., Marsh, C., & Westhuizen, P. C. van der. (1996). Across six nations: Stressful events in the lives of children. Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 26(3), 139-150.

Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 36(2), 253‚Äì259US Bureau of Census. Suicide Deaths and Rates. Washington, DC: National Center for Health Statistics; 2012:87-97 Across the world, the loss of a parent is seen as a significant life event for a child. However, the process of grieving can look different for each child based on their age, the quality of the relationship with the deceased parent, and the characteristics of the death. An individual‚Äôs culture is an important factor that will influence the bereavement process. What one culture believes to be maladaptive, another culture may view as healthy; there is no universally accepted view of the bereavement process Carter, S. L. (1989). Themes of Grief. Nursing Research, 38(6), 354  Bereavement  There are two categories of bereavement that children experience after the loss of a parent; complex bereavement and uncomplicated bereavement. Uncomplicated bereavement is the normal process that most children will experience. Children who experience uncomplicated bereavement and receive adequate parenting following the death of a parent appear to not be at risk of developing a mental health condition in the future.Worden, J. W. (1996). Children and grief: When a parent dies. Complicated bereavement occurs when an individual fails to return to their pre-bereavement emotional and behavioral functioning Cutcliffe, J. R.1998. Hope, counselling and complicated bereavement reactions. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 28(4), 754-761 The precise definition and duration of the bereavement process has been a source of controversy over the decades.Wakefield, J. C., & First, M. B. (2012). Validity of the bereavement exclusion to major depression: does the empirical evidence support the proposal to eliminate the exclusion in DSM-5? World Psychiatry, 11(1), 3‚Äì10Kendler, K. S., Myers, J., & Zisook, S. (2008). Does Bereavement-Related Major Depression Differ From Major Depression Associated With Other Stressful Life Events? American Journal of Psychiatry, 165(11), 1449‚Äì1455 According to the DSM-V, Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder, requires that the child lost someone that they had a close relationship with; and during a 6 month period the child must experience on more days than not, one of the following symptoms: a yearning for the deceased individual, sorrow or emotional pain for the dead, preoccupation with the death, or preoccupation surrounding the circumstances around the death.American Psychiatric Association. (2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5(5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association Additionally, six more symptoms must be experienced on more days than not that are related to reactive distress to death or social/identity disruption.  Development considerations  Children can be vulnerable to life events following loss. The vulnerability is due to developmental immaturity and the lack of developed coping abilities. It is common to assume children will grieve in a similar fashion to adults, but their symptoms and duration of grief following loss appears differently. This may include children repeatedly asking questions about death for reassurance that nothing has changed and reenacting the death or funeral activities. Additionally, children‚Äôs emotions may be expressed differently than adults; adults may express their grief through sadness, but children may misbehave or have outbursts. Research emphasizes the importance of being cognizant of and not to expect children to display their emotions outwardly like adults, but rather that their behaviors could indicate their internal distress.  Treatment  A large portion of children may experience loss and bereavement at some point during their childhood. After these losses occur, there are a variety of types of treatment techniques that can be implemented, including Play Therapy, Group Therapy, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Play therapy for loss during childhood uses activities like drawing or games that aid in having the children talk about their feelings. Another effective form of therapy is Group Therapy tailored for loss during childhood, where a group of peers, similar in age, share and talk about their feelings and the bereavement process with a facilitator leading the group. Lastly, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for loss during childhood includes using cognitive techniques to assist the child in changing their behavior and using more effective coping techniques. The different forms of treatment aiming to assist children in coping with loss and bereavement also help to reduce their symptoms of anxiety, depression, adjustment issues, and posttraumatic stress. By using empirically driven forms of therapy for children who have experienced loss, children can reduce their symptoms and will be less likely to drop out of treatment by focusing on the feelings and reaction they have to the death or suicide of someone close.

In 1988, the facility was renamed Eaker Air Force Base in honor of World War II General of the Eighth Air Force, Ira C. Eaker. It was located northwest of Blytheville, Arkansas. The facility now operates as the Arkansas Aeroplex and Arkansas International Airport. History Constructed on former agricultural land, the site was originally activated as the Blytheville Army Airfield in 1942. During World War II, the site served as a training airfield as part of the 70,000 Pilot Training Program. It was one of many air fields created in the country‚Äôs interior during the war for this purpose. Blytheville, Arkansas was selected as a training location due to its proximity to the Mississippi River, where supplies could easily be shipped to and from the site. The airfield was used as the Southeastern Training Command‚Äôs flight training school, which closed in October 1945 after the Second World War ended. Then the airfield briefly became a processing center for the rapid demobilization of military personnel being discharged. The War Assets Administration officially closed down the installation in 1946, at which point control and responsibility for the land was transferred to the city of Blytheville. A Cold War-era image of a B-52 being refueled by a KC-135 On 15 July 1955, the facility was reopened as Blytheville Air Force Base (AFB), when the 461st Bombardment Wing was moved from Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Blytheville AFB became fully operational when it was equipped with a wing of three squadrons of B-57 bomber on 19 July 1955. Other aircraft stationed at Blytheville AFB included: KC-97 refueler, B-52G bomber, KC-135A tanker, T-33 jet fighter, and the T-37 trainer‚Äîamong others. In July 1959, the 97th Bombardment Wing subsequently assumed control of the base and brought with it the long-range B-52G bomber and the KC-135A Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft to support bomber operations. Blytheville AFB experienced a great deal of activity throughout the Cold War era, when for instance, the 97th Bombardment Wing went on airborne alert in 22 October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Two B-52G bombers were readied to strike the Soviet Union with nuclear weapons if necessary‚Äîfor which the wing received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its performance during the crisis. During the Vietnam War the 97th Bomber Wing at Blytheville supported strike operations throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. A bomber crew from Blytheville were among the first shot down during Operation Linebacker II, a December 1972 mission targeting complexes in North Vietnam. Three crewmen died in the crash. Six more men from the 97th were also lost in Vietnam, whose names are recognized on a memorial placard at the former base. In 1972, all of the bombers were temporarily moved to Guam before being returned to Blytheville AFB, at which time the installation resumed normal functions. It launched rescue missions from the base to Grenada in 1983 and in August 1990, the pilots of the 97th Bomber Wing began practicing for missions in the Middle East and eventually supported Operation Desert Storm. B-52 releasing its payload over Vietnam Renamed Eaker AFB and base closure In 1988, the U.S. Air Force officially renamed Blytheville AFB to Eaker AFB in commemoration of World War II General Ira Eaker, the former commander of the 8th Air Force. Officials had hoped, after hearing rumors of the base's possible closure, that the name would endear the base among military leaders and be enough to incentivize its continued existence. Unfortunately, Eaker Air Force Base topped the Strategic Air Command‚Äôs list of base closures in 1991 and with the Cold War coming to an end, the installation was officially chosen; in March 1992, the last aircraft left the base. Extensive efforts to offset the negative economic effects on the community of Blytheville were undertaken by local and federal officials, who cleaned up the site and then distributed the land to various organizations, including the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Some of the land has since been declared a National Historic Landmark. The base closure cost the community over 700 civilian jobs, but half of these were recovered through the adaptive reuse of the former base, such as United States Post Office's utilization of the base in the late 1990s as an airport hub during the holidays, some of the base housing being converted by Westminster Village of the Mid-South for a retirement community, the construction of a $2.5 million sports complex by the local community, and the private investment of some $3 million for the creation of the Thunder Bayou Golf Course.

History and taxonomy Ulocladium chartarum was discovered in 1848. It was originally called Alternaria chartarum, but was given its current name by E. G. Simmons in 1967. Ulocladium chartarum is a mold commonly found in indoor environments. Members of the genus Ulocladium are often found in water damaged materials, and can even be found on paper if conditions are right. It is often found together with species Stachybotrys.(Frisvad and Gravesen 1994, Gravesen et al. 1997) The presence of Ulocladium is a good indicator of wet environments or water damage. This genus is morphologically similar to Alternaria and possesses the same major allergen. It appears to live in the same places as S. chartarum although with more frequency, as it is able to grow under the same humidity range as Alternaria. Almost no secondary metabolites have been isolated from the mold. All four isolates inoculated on materials(Neilsen et al. 1999) grew well but did not produce any metabolic quantities of secondary metabolites, which is in accordance with the literature where few metabolites from this genus have been described. Analyses of natural samples with excessive growth have not revealed any metabolites in the polarity range. Growth and morphology The teleomorph of U. chartarum is unknown. The colonies can range from velvety to floccose with coloration ranging from olivaceous brown to black. They grow rapidly. Conidia can range from obovoid to short ellipsoidal, with colors of golden brown to blackish brown, roughened with 1‚Äì5 oblique or longitudinal septa and 1‚Äì5 lateral septa. It can be born singly or in short chains from sympodial conidiophores. The colonies grow rapidly, and range from powdery to lanose and black or olivaceous black. Conidiophores are erect, straight or flexuose; often somewhat geniculate, but mostly unbranched. They can be up to 50 x 4‚Äì5 um, golden brown, smooth-walled, conidial scars brown. The conidia commonly form in chains of 2‚Äì10, with ellipsoidal or obovoidal shapes and often with short peaks. Its colors can range from medium brown to olivaceous, or black and verrucose. It is 18‚Äì38 x 11‚Äì20 um, with 1‚Äì5 (commonly 3) transfers and several oblique or longitudinal septa. Secondary conidiophores are often present on conidia. Conidiophores septate can be simple or branched, straight, flexuous. They often geniculate with 1‚Äì8 pores up to 40‚Äì50 x 5‚Äì7 um that are golden brown and smooth-walled. Conidia are solitary or in chains of 2‚Äì10, obovoid to short ellipsoidal, 18‚Äì38 x 11‚Äì20 um, with 1‚Äì5 (commonly 3) transfers and 1‚Äì5 longitudinal or oblique septa, medium brown to olivaceous, smooth walled or verrucose, base conical at first (becoming round with age), apex broadly rounded before \\"false beak\\" production. Each \\"false beak\\" is in form and function a conidiophore forming secondary conidia and is therefore distinct from the gradually tapering true beaks of Alternaria. Good sporulation can be obtained by growing cultures on potato-carrot or hay-infusion agar under near- UV (black) light. Incubation temperature alone can alter the size, color, and shape of spores in U. chartarum. U. chartarum is heterokaryotic, so over different temperature ranges, spore morphogenesis is directed by different nuclei. Physiology Cellulase activities of U. chartarum were found to be influenced by the mode of incubation as well as by the age of the fungal culture. Habitat and ecology U. chartarum has been reported in Canada, Europe (Great Britain), India, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. It has been isolated from soil, dung, emulsion paint, grasses, fibers, wood, paper, and fibres. A necrosis of leaves of Quercus pubescens caused by the fungus U. chartarum has been reported. This fungus causes leaf spots under natural conditions and also following artificial inoculation of unwounded attached leaves. Medical significance A cutaneous mycosis caused by U. chartarum in a heart transplant recipient has been reported. The infection cleared after complete surgical excision and six months of oral itraconazole therapy. In vitro activity of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ravuconazole and terbinafine against the clinical isolate is shown. The low production of the metabolites indicates, however, that Ulocladium is not a major toxicological problem. This may be confirmed by testing its in vitro pulmonary toxicity and inflammatory potentials. U. chartarum is well known to be involved in biodeterioration of organic and inorganic substrates covered with organic deposits and is expected to be a possible contaminant in space vehicles. It and other fungal species could find a favourable environment to grow invasively unnoticed in the depth of surfaces containing very small amount of substrate, posing a risk factor for biodegradation of structural components, as well as a direct threat for crew health. Cutaneous granulomas due to the mold fungus U. chartarum has been reported.

There is also a pick for loosening dirt in the background as well as two jumping weights hanging up. While this is not the kylix described, the basic elements of the iconography and decorations are similar. The kylix depicting pentathletes is an example of pottery and decoration from the late Archaic period. This piece is decorated both around the outside of the vessel and on the tondo inside with images of different events from the pentathlon. The drinking kylix is decorated in the red figure style and is credited to the Proto-Panaitian group. It is currently at the Boston Museum for Fine Arts as part of their Ancient Greek collection.  Description of Kylix  This drinking kylix depicting pentathletes is from Attica around 510-500 BC. The vessel itself is 7.6 x 29.8 cm and decorated with red-figure painting. This kylix is believed to have been made by the Proto-Panaitian Group. The Pioneer Group was the predecessor of this new group of red-figure artists who are said to have focused on \\"more elaborate features and anatomy\\" in their images. The group as a whole focused more on the depiction of male athletes as the focus of their decoration. The characteristics of this kylix support this theme. This kylix has a lot of decoration. The tondo inside shows an image of an young, male athlete holding jumping weights. He is in a running pose much like the knielauf used in many other art forms to display movement. His body is twisted in preparation but since he is looking back it is unclear if he is preparing to jump. Behind him there are two javelins, presumably leaning against a wall. There is not much detail in the athletes features but the simplicity keeps the images clean and easy to see. In addition, there is an inscription around the youth reading \\"Athenodotos is handsome\\". The athlete now has a name and the inscription emphasizes the high regard the Ancient Greeks held their athletes. The sides of the kylix also show images from the pentathlon including javelin throwing and long jump. On Side A there are three figures shown. From left to right there is an athlete picking up a javelin, and other athlete holding two javelins, and a third figure holding a pick. Picks were used to loosen the dirt so that when a javelin landed it would go into the ground. The images on this side do not show the movement of throwing the javelin but instead show all the parts in preparation for the event. On Side B there are three other athletes as well as an inscription. Again from left to right there are two athletes each holding two javelins moving to the right while a third athlete has a jumping weight in his left hand and he seems to be making a hand motion at the others. In the background there is another pick. There is also an inscription that reads \\"The boy is handsome\\". It is unclear if this is referencing one athlete or describing all figures in the images. However, either way it is clear the artist wants the athletes to be praised.  Discovery  This vessel was said to be found in a tomb in Ancient Capua. This tomb was in southern Italy and could be evidence of trade or of the Greek colonization in southern Italy. It had a series of owners after its discovery but was eventually bought by the Museum for Fine Art in 1898 after its last owner passed away.  History of the Pentathlon  The pentathlon is a series of five athletic events where the victor is decided by the highest overall performance. The five events were discus-throwing, javelin, long jump, running, and wrestling. The pentathlon itself was introduced to the games at Olympia in 708 BC which was also the first year wrestling was a part of the Olympic games. Pentathletes were admired by the ancient Greek society because they had to possess speed, strength, and power in order to win. All the events were held on the same day and while the order of the events is unclear, it is known that wrestling was held last. The scoring of the Pentathlon is also still under discussion. There is not written evidence on how each event was ranked or how athletes were judged in their performance like there is for the athletic pentathlon now. While this is slightly problematic, scholars have determined some models that could potentially reflect what was used. These models are not perfect but they display a certain record each athlete must achieved in order to be the victor. Athletics was an important part of Greek culture because it highlighted power and beauty in youths. The spectrum of athletic events included in the pentathlon led people to consider those who participated to be some of the best ever. The respect and praise pentathletes received was enough that their images were used as decorations for pottery vessels many times over; their depiction and ever present image of the perfect human form.  Respect for Pentathetes  It is known that athletes in Ancient Greece were highly praised but pentathletes specifically were highly regarded. In Aristotle's Rhetoric he writes two times why pentathletes are the most handsome and best athletes culminating it with \\"he who excels in all [is] for the pentathlon\\". These athletes had to be very versatile and flexible in their abilities in order to win the event overall and that is what made them so special. Since the five events required different muscles and strength to succeed, someone that could master all of them to a point of victory was impressive and therefore deserved respect. In addition, the victors of athletic events gained elite status and were sometimes invited to engage in special activity like sitting in the front row or prohedria of a theatrical production. These added benefits along with the frequent depiction of athletes in Greek art shows the high regard the society held for athletes.

The concept originally introduced by Jennifer Freyd in 1994, betrayal trauma theory (BTT), addresses situations when people or institutions on which a person relies for protection, resources, and survival violate the trust or well-being of that person. BTT emphasized the importance of betrayal as a core antecedent of dissociation implicitly aimed at preserving the relationship with the caregiver. BTT suggests that a child, being dependent on their caregiver for support, will have a higher need to dissociate traumatic experiences from conscious awareness.  Background  Betrayal trauma theory emerged to integrate evolutionary processes, mental modules, social cognitions, and developmental needs with the extent to which the fundamental ethic of human relationships are violated. A foundational component of the dissociative aspect of BTT postulated that all humans possess an inherent mental mechanism to detect violations of social contracts (i.e., \\"cheater detectors\\"). BTT posits that in the context of abusive relationships in which escape is not a viable option, the cheater-detecting mechanism may be suppressed for the higher goal of survival. Thus, betrayal trauma offered a theory of psychogenic amnesia designed to evaluate both the role of attachment in human survival and the significance of blocking the painful experience.  Types   Child sexual abuse  Child sexual abuse (CSA) can involve molestation by one or more caregivers or close relatives. While physical and emotional abuse during childhood is present in the context of BTT, research has found that CSA leads to more significant disruption in capacities and is more characteristic of a substantial violation of fundamental human ethics. Notably, the degree to which one is violated by a caregiver or close relationship can influence the nature of and response to trauma. BTT suggests that CSA is closely linked with psychogenic amnesia or other dissociative processes occurring as a means to maintain an attachment with the caregiver and promote survival. For the victim to acknowledge the violation of CSA could increase their risk of impaired attachment provided by the caregiver and increase the potential of danger to the child. Such trauma has direct links to eliciting the process of \\"betrayal blindness\\". Similarly, evidence suggests that such trauma is more likely to be forgotten as compared to non-sexual childhood abuse.  Institutional betrayal  Institutional betrayal (IB) refers to wrongdoings perpetrated when an institution fails to prevent or appropriately respond to wrongdoings by other individuals. In instances when individuals experiencing traumatic events place a great deal of trust in the legal, medical, and mental health systems to address their wrongs they risk disbelief, blame, and refusal of help. Priorities of the institution, such as protecting their reputation, may increase the likelihood that institutions fail to respond appropriately. Institutions may strenuously attempt to prevent knowledge of sexual assaults from surfacing, which can take the form of attempting to silence the individual. Lack of validation and interpersonal trauma from institutional betrayal can be examined through a BTT lens and have been described as a \\"second assault,\\" which can exacerbate the effects of the initial trauma incurred. = Academic institutions = Betrayal trauma via institutional betrayal can be particularly pervasive in environments that normalize abusive contexts, adopt procedures and policies that are unclear and potentially stigmatising, support cover-ups and misinformation, and punish victims and whistle blowers. Sexual assaults which take place on college campuses in which the system is unhelpful and unresponsive constitute BT. Similarly, sexual assault committed by close others in the context that the betrayal is implicit and challenging to detect has received increased attention in the media through campaigns oriented to highlight the prevalence of abuse in professional and academic institutions. In the 2010s literature has expanded in this area to evaluate minority populations such as gender and sexual minorities (GSM), who may be at increased risk of experiencing institutional betrayal in academic institutions. = Military = In effort to directly measure institutional betrayal, results from comparisons of female veterans who experienced civilian sexual assault and those who experienced sexual assault in the United States military indicated that institutional betrayal was higher in military contexts when members were highly dependent upon the military for safety, protection, and employment. Although research investigating military sexual trauma (MST) is still in its infancy, literature has identified the perpetrator-victim relationship as a primary impediment to reporting the assault which could impact job status and contribute to disruptions in unit cohesion, ostracization, inability to leave or transfer duty stations. Evidence evaluating the impact of assault or harassment during military service, and medical care fraught with victim blaming and implicit policies of disrespectful treatment. Additionally emerging research has found that institutions (e.g., occupational settings, religious organizations, and schools) have the potential to worsen posttraumatic outcomes or be a source of social harm and injustice. = Law enforcement = Literature indicates that the U.S. police force has a demonstrably long history of using coercive force. However, recent deaths suspected to be the result of police officers using excessive force (e.g., shooting of Stephon Clark, shooting of Philando Castile) have shone light upon the issue of police brutality as a form of institutional betrayal. Research has identified that cultural minorities tend to experience police brutality more frequently than their European American counterparts due to stereotypes associating criminal activity with race/ethnicity, particularly in urban areas where crime rates are high and the presence of cultural minorities is more prevalent. Additionally, recent studies have identified mentally ill individuals as being at a higher risk for experiencing police brutality, especially with regard to suicide by cop. = Healthcare system = Emerging literature has articulated a need for furthering research that evaluates the prevalence and impact of institutional betrayal in healthcare settings, with an emphasis on understanding the relationship between the level of trust patients place in physicians, associated expectations that physicians will prioritize protections to patients' welfare, and incurred adverse medical experiences which are conceptualized as institutional betrayal.Smith, C. P. (2016). First, do no harm: Institutional betrayal in healthcare (Doctoral dissertation, University of Oregon).  Romantic betrayal  When evaluating betrayal trauma in romantic relationships, earlier literature focused on the impact of infidelity in monogamous relationships. Within this context, the betrayal is present in the relationship as a breach of an unspoken agreement. More recent literature exploring BTT in romantic partnerships has focused on the inclusion of domestic violence (DV). DV involves a betrayal of trust when one partner is repeatedly beaten, degraded, and violated and has been shown to constitute BTT, particularly in instances when the victim remains with or returns to the abuser, does not report the abuse, or underreports the severity of ongoing abuse which have been linked to deep feelings of shame and anxiety in the victim. Attachment injury has been indicated as an additional component of BTT in romantic contexts, characterized by abandonment or betrayal of trust during moments of need. In the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), vulnerability/fear, relationship expectations, shame/low self-esteem, and communication issues are suggested to be ways exposure to betrayal trauma manifests and subsequently serves as a barrier to forming new romantic relationships.  Key features   Attachment theory  John Bowlby in 1969 was the first to identify the link between attachment processes and dissociative psychopathology. He referred to internal representations as Internal Working Models (IWM) with which one can discern which internal content is dominant and warrants attention and that which can be segregated into one's unconscious awareness. Once the attachment system is activated, the IWM is identified as a guide to the formation of both the attachment behavior and the appraisal of attachment emotions in self and others. Bowlby emphasizes that traumatizing experiences with one's caregiver which is likely to result in negative impacts a child's attachment security, stress, coping strategies, and the sense of self. Securely organized IWM: Evidence indicates that secure attachment is associated with positive appraisals of one's own attachment emotions and expectations that the child's request will be experienced as significant and legitimate by their caregiver. Insecurely organized IWM (avoidant or resistant): Associated with a negative appraisal of attachment emotions and expectations that one's request for attention and attachment will be received as a nuisance or an intrusion to the caregiver. Disorganized IWM: Linked to unresolved traumas and losses experienced by the caregiver and the effect had on the subsequent attachment style with their offspring. Main and Hesse in 1990 theorized that in the context of BTT disorganized attachment develops when the caregiver is both a source of the child's solution and a source of fright. This form of attachment is proposed to more frequently experience altered consciousness akin to dissociation.  Dissociation  Dissociation is described as the disruption of conscious memory, identity, or perception of one's immediate environment. Freyd and colleagues (2007) identified \\"knowledge isolation\\" or the extent to which information is hidden from awareness. From a neurological perspective, dissociation during times of extreme stress or trauma can invoke neural mechanisms resulting in long-term alterations in brain functioning. Additional evidence has implicated the effect of childhood trauma as an etiological factor of dissociation. Research suggests that the level of betrayal trauma experienced (e.g., high, moderate, low) can influence the degree of dissociation. Low betrayal trauma (LBT) are conceptualized as no less severe than high betrayal trauma (HBT), yet are posited to lack the violation of trust which characterizes HBT. Additionally, consolidated empirical evidence has indicated that exposure to HBT is linked to increased levels of dissociation and impaired memory of trauma-related words as compared to low dissociators. Trauma and stressor-related disorders frequently include dissociative experiences. Evidence suggests that dissociation during trauma enables affected individuals to compartmentalize the traumatic experience from their conscious awareness. In the context of BTT, dissociation is conceptualized as an adaptive process aimed to maintain self-preservation and serve as protection against psychological pain. Perspectives from the development of psychopathology paired with attachment theory cite the mechanism of dissociation as a core feature in understanding environmentally produced psychiatric disorders. Evidence has indicated that dissociation can occur in extreme cases, when an alternative personality state can emerge (i.e. altered), as frequently implicated in the dissociative identity disorder (DID).  Loss of the assumptive world  The assumptive world refers to a core belief system reflecting that individuals perceive the world as secure and fair. Janoff-Bulman (1992) identified three assumptions (e.g. the world as benevolent, meaningful, and worthy), which can be shattered by distortions in social behavior. In the context of BTT, violations perpetrated by caregivers or close relationships have been implicated to impair views of the assumptive world and contribute to avoidance of the trauma experienced.  Presence in psychopathology  Models of attachment-based dissociative disorders and trauma-related disorders involving betrayal trauma have been indicated in diagnostic groups such as posttraumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, trauma and stress-related disorders, dissociative disorders, schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders and substance-related and addictive disorders. Many of these disorders can be disposed to experiencing betrayal trauma and betrayal trauma should be explored as a contributor to symptoms.  Posttraumatic stress disorder  BTT includes an individual who may experience little or no conscious awareness of their trauma. If the trauma does have no conscious knowledge, the effects of the abuse instead can manifest with physical and psychological symptoms such as dissociation. Many have found that dissociation can be a predictor of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after the trauma has occurred.  Dissociative identity disorder  Some trauma victims deploy a protective response such as dissociation or repression to block awareness of the trauma. BTT indicates that childhood sexual abuse and other interpersonal injuries create the dissociative reaction. Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is commonly connected with prolonged overwhelming trauma such as childhood sexual abuse. This trauma can create a disruption in identity where there are two or more distinct personalities in one person where perception, cognition, and sense of self and agency is different. The person may experience gaps in the recall of everyday events or traumatic events.  Substance use disorders  There have been suggestions that interpersonal trauma such as betrayal trauma can in some cases have links to substance use. This substance use may be episodic binge drinking or chronic substance use that can meet diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder. Research found that childhood physical or sexual abuse is at increased risk for substance abuse. Some postulate that because betrayal trauma can create a loss of control that loss of control incorporates into substance use. Others think substance use is a way to cope with posttraumatic negative affect traits such as avoidance, tension reduction or self-medication.  Personality disorders  The development of borderline personality disorder (BPD) may have links to early maltreatment and attachment difficulties. The maltreatment is sometimes because of the emotional, physical, verbal or sexual abuse by caregivers. BTT incorporates both attachment and damage from a caregiver in the definition of the theory. BTT includes dissociation as a diagnostic criterion for BPD. Some postulate that BTT may explain dissociation that BPD experience because dissociation is a defense mechanism against childhood trauma. High betrayal traumas have been implicated in the development of traits indicative of borderline personality disorder.  Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders  Dissociation is a severe symptom of betrayal trauma, and recently hallucinations have been linked to extreme cases of betrayal trauma. Research found that childhood adversity such as interpersonal trauma like betrayal trauma, bullying, and a parent‚Äôs death is at increased risk for psychosis and hallucinations. There is research suggesting that individually, the betrayal trauma of childhood abuse is related to hallucinations. The long-standing intervention for the treatment of hallucinations has been medication, but new research suggests that the treatment of betrayal trauma may reduce hallucinations when childhood sexual abuse is present in the person's past.  Intergenerational effects  Individuals' levels of dissociation have been found to correlate with betrayal trauma experienced by the individual, but also with betrayal trauma experienced by the mother. As a possible mechanism for such intergenerational transmission, it has been proposed that mothers with betrayal traumas or dissociative symptoms may have more difficulty in creating a safe environment for their children. p. 80.  Treatment   Betrayal assessments  The Betrayal Trauma Inventory (BTI) was created to assess for BTT in patients. The inventory assesses physical, emotional and sexual abuse in childhood and/or adulthood traumas. Many of the questions have behaviorally defined events such as \\"did someone hold your head under water or tried to drown you before you were the age of 16\\". The response to these questions with \\"yes\\" can start the follow-up questions that may include age, relationship, the severity of injuries and memory of the event. These items were adapted from the Abuse and Perpetration Inventory (API). The BTI takes around 45-minutes to administer and only assesses trauma before age 16. The Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey (BBTS) was adapted from the BTI in order to quickly assess for BTT. This survey includes 11 separate items for traumatic experiences such as sexual, physical and emotional abuse. It includes if the person was a someone close to them or an interpersonal event. This survey looks at events prior to age 18. The Institutional Betrayal Questionnaire (IBQ), created by Smith and Freyd (2011), is a 10-item questionnaire that assesses institutional betrayal in the context of sexual assault on college campus' and identifies the level of involvement of the institution in the unwanted sexual experience and associated experiences (e.g., normalizing sexual assault, creating environments which facilitate sexual assault, and covering up incidents of sexual assault).  Interventions  Treatment for betrayal trauma is relatively new to psychology. Many believe that the proper treatment is evidence-based treatments for a particular diagnosis others feel that betrayal trauma is unique and should be treated with an individual treatment. In an article by Jennifer M. G√≥mez in 2016 postulated that relational-cultural therapy is a match for treating betrayal trauma. This therapy established by Jean Miller following the emerging feminist therapies suggested that the therapist should focus on the relational disconnections a client is experiencing as opposed to symptoms. Working through decontextualizing the betrayal trauma and separating self-decision making is postulated to work better for the treatment of betrayal trauma.

He is the author of Corporations Are Not People: Reclaiming Democracy From Big Money And Global Corporations. Since 2010, he has been one of the chief advocates for a 28th Amendment to overturn Citizens United v. FEC and allow the U.S. Congress and states to set reasonable limits on campaign spending in U.S. Elections. Early life and education Clements majored in Government at Colby College, graduating in 1984, he obtained his J.D. from Cornell Law School in 1988, graduating Magna Cum Laude. Legal career Hired by Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger in 1996, Clements served as Assistant Attorney General of Massachusetts from 1996 to 2000 where he worked on Investigations and enforcement of deceptive trade practices, antitrust, and consumer protection laws. Starting in 2006, Clements served as the Assistant Attorney General and Chief of the Public Protection Bureau in Massachusetts. In private practice, Jeff has been a partner at Mintz Levin in Boston, and in his own firm. Advocacy work In 2009, as a private attorney, Clements represented several public interest organizations with a U.S. Supreme Court amicus brief in the Citizens United case. Clements argued: \\"[w]hether or not the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United explicitly addresses 'corporate rights' under the Constitution, a holding that overrules Austin and McConnell would rest on the remarkable - and erroneous - assumption that the Constitution provides corporations with First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights equivalent to those of people for purposes of political expenditures.\\" Following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, Clements and John Bonifaz founded Free Speech For People in 2010 to advocate for a 28th Amendment to overturn the Courts controversial 5-4 ruling. In 2012, Jeff co-founded Whaleback Partners LLC, provides accessible start-up funding for farmers and businesses engaged in local, sustainable agriculture. In 2016, Clements founded American Promise to accelerate the movement to win a 28th amendment by building cross partisan, grassroots infrastructure across the United States.

It is located 6 miles north of the Ojai Valley, within Los Padres National Forest. It is named for Wheeler Blumberg, who founded the town in 1891, and the many natural hot springs.Hill, Mason L. (1987). Cordilleran Section of the Geological Society of America: Decade of North American Geology, Centennial Field Guide Volume 1. Geological Society of America. Page 227. . Wheeler Springs is most known for its former resort, natural hot springs and for previously being home to the smallest post office in the U.S. It is also where TV personality Art Linkletter opened the theme park Kiddyland Park. Wheeler Springs is home to numerous campgrounds, including Wheeler Gorge Campground by Matilija Creek, as well as multiple hiking trails and open-space nature areas. Etymology Wheeler Springs is named for Wheeler C. Blumberg, who acquired government land surrounding the hot springs.Sheridan, Edwin M. (1917). History of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura Counties, California, Volume 2. Lewis Publishing Company. Page 847. Blumberg discovered the hot springs here in 1890 when he was out on a hunting trip. He shot a deer which fell into a ravine. When Blumberg climbed into the canyon, he discovered hot sulphur springs and cold mountain water springs.Leadabrand, Russ (1967). Exploring California byways: trips for a day or a weekend, Volume 5. W. Ritchie Press. Page 94. History Wheeler Springs was home to America's smallest post office. The first people to inhabit Wheeler Springs was the Chumash. Wheeler Springs was home to a Chumash village - known as Sisxulkuy - during the Mission period. It is often assumed that hot springs in Wheeler Springs were sacred to the Chumash people, although there are no archeological evidence to confirm this. Resort Wheeler Springs was the location of Ojai Hot Springs (Wheeler's Hot Springs), later known as Matlija Hot Springs. This resort operated throughout the 1900s, but closed in 1997. The resort offered fishing, hunting, swimming, camping, trail riding and dancing. It was often visited by Johnny Cash during the 1960s, when Cash resided in nearby Casitas Springs. The owner of the resort, Wheeler Blumberg, established the resort in 1891. It had 14 rental cabins, a swimming pool, bar, and more. On a day in May 1907, Wheeler Blumberg locked himself in a room and also shot through the walls. Blumberg was arrested by a posse and placed in a straitjacket in a padded cell in Ventura. He died the following day at age 43. Webb Wilcox became the new owner and renamed it Wheeler Hot Springs. Post office Wheeler Springs Post Office was established by Webb Wilcox next door to Webb Wilcox Cafe in the mid-1930s. The shack, no larger than a phone booth, was designated by Ripley's Believe it or Not as the smallest post office in America. It was opened after the completion of the Maricopa Highway, which connected the Ojai Valley to the town of Maricopa in Kern County. The community lost its post office status in 1962. The post office was located at 16850 Maricopa Highway. It burned down in December 2017 during the Thomas Fire. Geography Ojala. Wheeler Springs is located 5.5 miles north of the Ojai Valley and is situated within Los Padres National Forest. It is located next to Maricopa Highway. Tall mountain peaks, including Nordhoff Ridge, border the village in all directions. It is a mountain community which sits along the North Fork of Matilija Creek. During rainy winters, a waterfall near the highway splashes down into the creek. Creekbeds which cross the highway may contain deep water, making crossing difficult.Palmer, Norma E. (1994). Santa Barbara & Ventura Counties. Automobile Club of Southern California. Page 189. .

Geology Wheeler Springs is located in a narrow, deeply incised canyon known as Wheeler Gorge, which is eroded by the North Fork of Matilija Creek and cuts through the Santa Ynez-Topatopa Range in northern Ventura County. The canyon is so narrow that three tunnels and an additional three bridges had to be constructed for Maricopa Highway to be built. The North Fork of Matilija Creek joins the main river (Matilija Creek) just south of Wheeler Springs in nearby Ojala, California. From Ojala it drains southward via the Ventura River to the coast.

Keene was born in Ireland, the son of Captain Gilbert Keene and his wife Alice Whitshed, daughter of Thomas Whitshed of Dublin, serjeant-at-law. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and was awarded BA in 1750. He joined the army and was lieutenant in the 5th Foot in 1754, captain in 1756 and major in 1762. He served as lieutenant colonel and then colonel in the Portuguese army. He then went to Paris, and attached himself to Stephen Fox the brother of Charles James Fox. He soon became acquainted with Lord Hertford, then ambassador, and became his master of the horse and gradually his intimate dependant. He retired from the army in 1768. He married Elizabeth Legge, daughter of George, Viscount Lewisham on 1 August 1771. Keene was elected Member of Parliament for Wareham at a by-election in November 1768. In 1772 he became Secretary to the Lord Chamberlain, a post he held until March 1782. In 1774, when he was appointed to the Board of Trade, he was required to undergo re-election but having resigned at Wareham, he was then re-elected at Ludgershall where he sat for 6 months. He seems never to have spoken in the Parliament of 1768‚Äì1774. At the 1774 general election Keene was returned unopposed at Montgomery on the Powis interest He was returned there for a total of 44 years by three successive members of the Powis-Clive family. In June 1777 he was removed from the Board of Trade to succeed Thomas Worsley as surveyor general at the Board of Works. It was believed that Worsley could scarcely outlive the day, but he lived on until December 1778. Keene took up hs post in January 1779 and was paid ¬£2,000 from secret service funds for his loss of salary etc. of the Board of Trade and election expenses. In 1780 an opposition to Keene was intended at Montgomery but the neighbouring country gentleman who was proposed never materialized, and Keene's election was once more unopposed. He made his first speech on record on 28 April 1780 when he was on his legs three quarters of an hour, giving a full account of the Board of Works, and a detail of works done by it. On the fall of Lord North in March 1782 he lost his positions but was re-appointed secretary to the Lord Chamberlain and made a Lord of the Admiralty in the Coalition Government in April 1783. He lost both places when the coalition was dismissed in December 1783. The few interventions by him in the 1784-1790 parliament all refer to the work of that Board or of the Lord Chamberlain's office. Keene continued to sit for Montgomery for the rest of his parliamentary life on the interest of the Earls of Powis and was returned unopposed in 1784, 1790 and 1796. They could count on his loyalty and ensured his return in the only contest he faced in 1802. He took a very active part in parliament in his later years speaking on various topics until 1816. From then he made no mark in the House and retired in 1818. He died on 27 February 1822 aged 90.

One of Colonel Craig's brothers, Presley Hamilton Craig (1789‚Äì1848) was senior surgeon with General Zachary Taylor's army in Mexico before being transferred to the staff of General Winfield Scott.Sterling, Keir B. Serving the Line with Excellence 1775‚Äì1991. Aberdeen, MD: U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command Historical Studies, 1991. . Another brother was Neville B. Craig, editor of the Pittsburgh Gazette.  Military career  Craig entered the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant assigned to the 2nd Artillery Regiment in March 1812, was promoted captain in December 1813, and served for a time near the end of the War of 1812 as commander of Fort Niagara. New York. Later in the war, he was involved in actions against the British at both Fort George and Stony Point, New York. He was transferred to the corps of artillery in May 1814, and to the light artillery in May 1815, completing a variety of assignments. In June 1821, Craig was transferred to the 3rd Artillery Regiment, and in December 1823, received his brevet majority for ten years' faithful service in one grade. During the early 1820s, Craig supervised several lead mines in Missouri and in Illinois, and in May 1832, was promoted to the rank of major. At some point thereafter, he was assigned to the Ordnance Corps, and during the War with Mexico, served as Chief of Ordnance for General Taylor. For his services in the Battle of Monterrey, he was brevetted lieutenant colonel in September 1846. Following that battle, he and a small group of officers and men moved a group of twelve pounder cannon from the Monterrey battlefield to the town of Buena Vista, 67 miles away. This was accomplished between dusk and dawn on a rough road within a period of seven hours, despite the fact that the axle on the gun carriage supporting one of the cannon snapped and had to be replaced. Although General Santa Anna, the Mexican commander, had abruptly withdrawn from the battlefield before Craig and his men arrived, his action nevertheless won him and his staff a cordial mention in general orders. He also gave an excellent account of himself during the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. From 1848 until 1851, Craig served as an inspector of arsenals. On 10 July 1851, Craig was appointed Chief of Ordnance with the rank of full colonel. During the ten years before the Civil War, budget allocations for the army were cut back considerably, and Craig did as much as he could to ensure that adequate funding was available for the production and procurement of the necessary weapons and munitions for peacetime activity. He encouraged studies of foreign ordnance and supported efforts to keep a good supply of proven models of rifles, cannon, and similar equipment on hand. Breechloading rifles were extensively tested during his tenure as Chief of Ordnance, but were not adopted because of problems with the cartridges of that time. In 1855, however, the Ordnance Board decided to convert existing stocks of smoothbore muzzleloading muskets to .58-cal. rifled muskets, and the days of the smoothbore were numbered. Finally, a modified 12-pounder Napoleon was tested and went into production. Craig was regarded as an experienced, conscientious, and dedicated officer, although he held strong views and was sometimes acerbic with his subordinates. In the spring of 1861, at the age of 70 and after nearly 48 years of army service, Craig was relieved of his duties at the direction of the new Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, on the grounds that the Ordnance Department needed more vigorous leadership in light of the national emergency. Craig protested this action, but Cameron, who had consulted with General Winfield Scott, the army's commanding general, stood firm. Craig then took the matter up with President Lincoln, but the harried new Chief Executive chose not to intervene. Craig nevertheless remained on duty for another two years in an advisory capacity, and retired on 1 June 1863 after nearly fifty years of service. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Craig for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general in the Regular Army of the United States for his service of over half a century to the army and ordnance department, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on July 26, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 733. After his retirement from the army, Craig lived in Washington, D.C., where he died on 7 December 1869, aged 78.  Notes   References  * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands.

Its construction began in the late 17th century and was completed in the 1750s, likely in 1754. The church was listed as a historic structure by National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN) in 1939. The church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary and is constructed in the Baroque style. History Construction of Parish Church of Our Lady of the Rosary began at the end of the late 17th century and continued into the next century. Funding for the church came from the local population and the Portuguese crown. King John V of Portugal donated eight thousand cruzados for the construction of the main chapel, sacristy, and an administrative office, the casa de f√°brica for its administrator, Francisco Amorim da Silva. Tile panels were installed in 1750. A commission, which consisted of an engineer, bricklayer, and carpenter, surveyed the building in 1754 and found the construction of the church to be satisfactory, but at a cost that exceeded the donation of the crown. Francisco Amorim da Silva's request for reimbursement by the Treasury was granted in the same year, implying that construction of the church was completed per instructions of the Portuguese colonial government. The church was the scene of bloody struggles by groups divided over its administration in 1842. Location The Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary forms a small block between Ana Nery Street and 13 de Maio Square in the lower part of the city. It was built in close proximity to the much smaller Chapel of Our Lady of Help (Capela de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda), which sits above the church on the Ladeira da Ajuda. The church is located close to the banks of the Paragua√ßu River and has been subject to flooding. Its main fa√ßade faces Ana Nery Street to the east and provides a clear view to the interior of the city. The church tower provides a view of the city of Cachoeira and parts of S√£o Felix, which is located on opposite bank of the Paragua√ßu River. The church is part of the Historical Center of Cachoeira. Structure The church has a rectangular plan with a single nave. It has two side aisles superposed by tribunes and a cross sacristy; these are features common to churches of the period. It has walls of mixed masonry of stone and brick. The design of the frontispiece was inspired by two churches: that of the Church of Saint Bartolomeu in neighboring Maragogipe and the Church of Santo Ant√¥nio da Barra in Salvador. The portal of the church is of richly carved lioz stone with within three arches. The frontispiece is flanked by two towers with pyramidal towers; they are glazed in tile in a distinctive zig-zag pattern, an element common to the Seminary of Bel√©m, also in Cachoeira; the churches of Boa Viagem and Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia both in Salvador, and the Convent of Saint Antonio in the municipality of S√£o Francisco do Conde. The church interior is richly decorated with numerous azulejos measuring 4 meter high. They are among the most important in Brazil and are typical of those produced in Lisbon in the 1750s. The ceiling of the nave is of wood and painted in the Italian trompe-l'oeil illusionist style; they were executed by Jos√© Joaquim da Rocha. Medallions are also painted in choir and sacristy areas. Carving work in the church from the 18th century is seen in the sacristy, pulpits, and tribunes. Other carvings date to a 19th-century renovation of the church in the Neoclassical style. Carvings of lioz, a stone imported from Portugal, covers parts of the interior; this is an element common to 18th-century churches in Salvador, notably the churches of Pilar, Concei√ß√£o da Praia and Lapa. Lioz carvings are found in the baptismal font, two seashell basins, and the stairway of the presbytery, and a lavabo with carvings of dolphins. Protected status The Mother Church of Our Lady of the Rosary was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1939. It was listed in the Book of Historical Works no 198.

He was born in June 1795 at Horsehay, Great Dawley, Shropshire where he would live for his whole life. His exact date of birth is unrecorded, but he was baptised on 8 July. He was the first son of five children born to Thomas and Elizabeth Ball of Horsehay. As an adult he was tall and weighed more than forty stones. It was said that his \\"waistcoat was so big that three men could be buttoned into it\\". In September 1819, aged 24, he married Mary Bailey. They had two children, Eliza (1823‚Äì1824) and Thomas (1824‚Äì1839). In that same year, both his wife and daughter died. Thomas also died young, at fifteen. Next year, 1825, he married Margaret Wood (1790-c.1850), who bore him no children. He was known locally as a cheerful man with a very pleasing disposition.  Ironworker  From the age of eight he was employed in the Coalbrookdale Company's Horsehay Ironworks, where he continued for forty years (1843). He worked mostly as a puddler and later as a shingler. Puddling is a skilled and extremely strenuous job, requiring great physical strength. 'Big Billy Ball' was immensely strong, on one occasion reputedly lifting a piece of iron weighing nearly to place under the forge hammer. In the 1841 census he gave his occupation as a forgeman. In 1843 he was accidentally blinded in one eye when it was struck by a piece of molten iron. After this he always wore a pair of glass goggles. He also ceased working in the ironworks.  John Bull  After he left the ironworks he exhibited himself around county fairs as \\"The Largest Man in Britain\\", appearing under the pseudonym 'John Bull'. 1850 saw the birth of Alfred Darby II, a descendant of the Darby family, which was to be celebrated by a procession. He was chosen to lead this procession on horseback, along with 'Little Bennie Poole', the smallest man working at the Coalbrookdale Company, riding a pony. Because of his size, he had to be hoisted onto his horse with a block and tackle, with a cry of, \\"Dunno yo drop me!\\". Afterwards the horse was so injured that it had to be destroyed. In the 1851 census of 30 April, he is listed but without specifying an occupation.  The Great Exhibition  He was invited, as both a guest and a celebrity exhibit, to The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. As no passenger seat on the train to London was big enough for him, he travelled in the guard's van. This was to be his last major public appearance. Some Birmingham businessmen were said to have teased him about his size: they asked him how much material would be needed and what the cost would be to make him a suit, but after he quipped that if they would take him to a tailor, have him measured and pay for a suit, he would give them the information they wanted, they troubled him no more! He did not enjoy his experience of London and was the target of thieves. He left wishing never to return and had no wish to travel from Horsehay again.  Death  He died the year after his appearance at The Great Exhibition, in June 1852, aged 57. On his death, he had to be taken from his home in Sandy Bank Row, Horsehay by removing a window and the surrounding brickwork. It took ten strong men to carry the coffin, with straps and poles. It was said to be so large that \\"ten lads were able to lie in it\\". Although the funeral at St Luke's Church in Doseley was attended by a large crowd, he was buried in an unmarked grave.

During the period of 1834-43, it was published in Boston by Benjamin B. Mussey as Universalist and Ladies' Repository. In 1844 and through 1873, it was published in Boston by Abel Tompkins as Ladies' Repository. History Encouraged by past success, the Proprietor was induced to issue proposals for the third volume of The Universalist. In order that it would not interfere with other publications advocating the doctrine of Universal Salvation, he was, in compliance with the advice of his friends, concluded to make an addition to its name and character. It would continue to advocate the doctrine of a world's salvation by Jesus Christ. Moral, practical, experimental and consolatory subjects would receive a due share of attention. Notices of passing events, interesting to the religious public; brief reviews of rare and popular works; poetical effusions, and everything which would tend to render a publication of the kind entertaining and useful, would continue to be included in its columns. Its tone was mild, generous and charitable; but at the same time, distinct, manly and firm. The proprietor stated there would be an aim to make its style chaste, and its literary character generally such as shall command respect. It would advocate the rights of women, and earnestly contend for female education. In a word, no pains would be spared to render The Universalist and Ladies' Repository a welcome visitor at the dwelling of every female Universalist. The third volume of the periodical commenced on Saturday June, 1834. It was published in Boston every week, quarto size 3. Subscribers could purchase it at US$1.25 in advance, $1.50 in six months, and $1.75 at the close of the year. Henry Bacon, on issuing the Prospectus of a new volume of the Universalist and Ladies‚Äô Repository, presented a brief statement of the object in conducting this periodical, and the reasons that caused him to confidently expect a liberal patronage. He purposed in the continuation of the labors, to advance the cause of religious truth, Christian morality, and human improvement and happiness. To this he dedicated his work; and in the furtherance of the object, endeavored to lay before the readers such a variety of subjects, as would tend to enlighten the mind in the knowledge of the great truths of Universalism. He would avoid the two extremes of too grave and too gay, and aimed to preserve a cheerful character, without descending to frivolity, believing that moral and religious truths could be presented in a pleasing garb and attractive form. To woo youth from thoughtless indifference, and win the young mind to the proper culture of its moral powers and religious feelings would be a prominent part of the plan. The periodical would continue to be the constant advocate of female education, and the proper dignity of woman; and it would devote a large portion of its pages to the especial benefit of women. In time, he intended the work to be useful, moral, entertaining, polite literature, embracing a wide range of subjects; and by the assistance promised by able writers, and the publisher's own knowledge gleaned from the past in reference to the proper manner of conducting the work, it would far exceed its value. He expected a generous patronage because he meant to merit it within the Universalist community. Going forward, The Universalist and Ladies' Repository would be published in Boston regularly on the 15th of every month, in royal octavo form, 40 pages, printed on fine paper, with clear, handsome type, stitched and neatly covered, at the price of $2.00 per annum in advance. Published by the Universalist Publishing House, Volume XXVI of The Ladies Repository commenced July 1857 with Eliza Ann Munroe Bacon, editor; Nancy T. Munroe, assistant editor; Caroline Soule, corresponding editor. Henrietta A. Bingham succeeded Phebe Ann Coffin Hanaford as the last editor of Ladies' Repository.

Life Paddon was the son of Henry Wadham Locke Paddon (1839‚Äì1933) and his wife Catherine Van Sommer; his father was son of the Rev. (Thomas) Henry Paddon and his wife Anne Locke, a daughter of Wadham Locke. He was born in Thornton Heath on 9 August 1881. There were four children in the family: their mother died four days after his birth, of what was known as milk fever (a postpartum infection). For a period after her death they were brought up by their paternal grandparents, the Paddons. In 1883, however, their father suffered a breakdown that saw him permanently confined to an asylum. They were then fostered by their maternal grandparents, the Van Sommers, in Wimbledon Park: first the two eldest girls moved there in 1883, and then Harry and his other sister joined them in 1888, having stayed with the Paddons in Eastbourne lodgings (Henry Paddon died in 1887). Paddon was educated at Woodbridge Grammar School, and Repton School under William Mordaunt Furneaux. He entered University College, Oxford in 1900; his grandfather James Van Sommer died in 1901. A troubled student, he graduated in 1906. Through the Fishermen's Mission (RNMDSF), he encountered again Wilfred Grenfell, who had visited Repton. He studied at St Thomas's Hospital, qualifying in early 1911, and taking a position at the Guest Hospital in the Midlands. In 1912 Paddon moved to the hospital at Indian Harbour, Newfoundland and Labrador founded by Grenfell, for the RNMDSF. He also took on duties at Lake Melville. He married Mina Gilchrist, a nurse from New Brunswick, in 1913. In 1915 he moved to the hospital at North West River. In 1924 the hospital burned down: Paddon saw it rebuilt in a matter of months. He addressed malnutrition in the local population. In 1927, Paddon wrote the Ode to Labrador, which would eventually be adopted as regional anthem. Paddon had a better relationship with Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador's Moravian mission than Grenfell, and was in 1930 able to bring a medical cruise in the Maraval there. His preoccupations included tuberculosis and education. He died in 1939 of a bacterial infection.

The schools were coordinated by Sister Gloria Gallardo and Tina Reyes. Curriculum for the schools was developed by committee with professor Edward Gonz√°les acting as the head. Students learned basic skills such as reading and writing as well as history and culture.  Background  The Houston Independent School District (HISD) in the late 1960s and early 1970s refused to consider Chicano students as a minority for the purposes of desegregating schools. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) opened a case against HISD, alleging that the district was illegally segregating black and Chicano students from white students. In addition, a group called the Mexican American Education Council (MAEC) was formed to coordinate efforts to protest school segregation. Some people were critical of the actions taken by huelga schools and felt that the issue was motivated by racism against African Americans. When school started in 1970, around 3,500 Chicano students boycotted schools run by HISD and instead attended huelga schools. Some of the students protested outside of their schools.  About  Huelga schools were staffed by teachers who volunteered their time. The schools served all ages of students and were located in churches and community centers. Members of the Mexican American Youth Organization (MAYO) also volunteered to teach history and culture. Sister Gloria Gallardo coordinated the schools. Tina Reyes ensured that the schools had enough resources to function. Curriculum was planned by a committee headed by Edward Gonz√°les, a professor at the University of Houston. In September 1970, there were around 14 huelga schools available to Chicano students. Around 2,000 students were registered to attend the schools. The number of schools rose to sixteen by September 10. The huelga schools were disbanded in October 1970 when HISD agreed to a busing plan to integrate the schools. This lasted until early in 1971. The huelga schools opened again early in 1971 when segregation once again became an issue. The schools were poorly funded until April 1971 when the Department of Health, Education and Welfare provided a $65,000 grant to fund them through the summer. Attendance waned at the huelga schools between 1971 and 1972. The boycott continued on and off until the end of the 1972 school year.

His military career spanned the period from the War of Independence through to his retirement as a senior intelligence officer in 1959. During this time he wrote and narrated various historical features for different media. His Civil War memoirs were developed into a book, Kerry Landing, which was extended and published posthumously.  Early life  He was born at 6 Cavendish Row, Dublin, home of his grandfather Dr. Edward O'Neill. His parents were Elizabeth O'Neill, daughter of Dr.O'Neill, and Timothy Charles Harrington, a Nationalist MP, barrister-at-law and Lord Mayor of Dublin from 1901 to 1903. When he was 9 his father died so he moved to Nelson Street [now Ashe Street], Tralee, Co. Kerry to live with his uncle Dan, Timothy Harrington's brother. Dan Harrington was the printer and publisher of The Kerry Sentinel, a weekly paper which had been founded by Timothy Harrington in 1877. He attended the Christian Brothers' school in Edward Street, Tralee, and later Rockwell College in Co. Tipperary.  Military career  After being apprenticed in 1918 to James Barry's pharmacy in Boyle, Co. Roscommon, Harrington joined the IRA and the IRB. He became 1st Lieutenant in A Company, 1st (Boyle) Battalion, North Roscommon Brigade IRA. A beating and threats from RIC members encouraged his departure from the area. He was ordered to Dublin to deliver a dispatch and remained there on advice after a secret meeting with Cathal Brugha and Austin Stack, and later a note from Michael Collins. He lived at different addresses and did different jobs before transferring to C Company, 2nd Battalion Dublin Brigade IRA. After the Anglo- Irish Treaty he became a private in the Medical Corps of the Irish Army in March 1922, reprising his pharmacy practice. He was on duty in Dublin when the Provisional Government launched an assault against anti-Treaty IRA 'Irregulars' who had captured the Four Courts. Allowed a posting aboard the Lady Wicklow, he transferred to the Dublin Guard en route. The ship landed at Fenit, Co. Kerry, on 2 August 1922 as part of an attempt to overcome the anti- Treaty forces controlling the county. His intimate knowledge of the area was utilised in the planning and execution of the landing and the capture of Fenit and Tralee. He received a field-promotion to 2nd Lieutenant for bravery. In 1923 he became captain and gained experience through the ranks in different roles and counties. He graduated from the Military College's Infantry School in 1931, and the Command and Staff School in 1939 becoming Commandant, in roles attached to military archives and intelligence. His final military post was as Deputy Director of Intelligence at General Headquarters from 1952 to 1959, in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.  Union representative  Upon retiring from his military role, Harrington was appointed National Organiser of the Federated Union of Employers [now part of Ibec], remaining until 1973.  Parnell Commemoration Association  Harrington was secretary, then president of the Parnell Commemoration Association, which existed in honour of Charles Stewart Parnell, the late 19th Century Irish nationalist, land reform agitator and leader of the Home Rule League. Harrington's father, Timothy Harrington, was a close confidant and supporter of Parnell. Harrington senior's Kerry Sentinel newspaper firmly supported the Irish Land League. Parnell offered him the secretaryship of the Irish National Land League and following that the Irish National League. Niall Harrington was the principal supporter of the memorial to Parnell now set in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin, and of granting public access to Avondale House in Co. Wicklow ‚Äì Parnell's birthplace and home ‚Äì as an Irish heritage centre.  Writing and broadcasting  Harrington wrote and presented a number of different items on 2RN (later Radio √âireann) from the 1930s onwards, and his play, Resurgence ‚Äì A Cavalcade of the Easter Insurrection, was broadcast in 1937. He also did pieces promoting the army. Amongst his many works for print, he sometimes wrote under the pseudonyms of Niall O'Neill and Brian Mulhern. His memoirs, entitled A fine day to die in Ireland, meant originally for the military archives, were expanded into the book Kerry Landing under the auspices of his friend, Dan Nolan, of Anvil Books. Nolan appealed for additional information from readers of the Kerryman. The book was eventually published in 1992, after Harrington's death in 1981 and Nolan's in 1989. In the book, Harrington referred to murders on both sides in the Civil War, including the notorious incidents at Ballyseedy Cross, Countess Bridge, and Bahags, all in Co.Kerry, where captured Republicans were brutally killed using landmines, bombs and bullets by Free State soldiers of the Dublin Guard. The soldiers were later officially cleared of any wrongdoing. Harrington, who was in the county having recently joined the Dublin Guard, said, \\"The facts are that the mines used in the slaughter of the prisoners were constructed in Tralee under the supervision of two senior Dublin Guards officers. \\"An alleged military court of inquiry into the occurrences was held in Tralee on 7 April 1923; the submissions made to the court and the findings brought in are, to my personal knowledge, totally untrue.\\" This conclusion was supported by other accounts, some only released in the 21st century.

It is faintly visible to the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 5.70. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 14.61 mas as measured from Earth, it is located around 223 light years from the Sun. The system is moving away from the Sun with a radial velocity of about +10 km/s. Primary star The primary is a chemically peculiar Ap star with a stellar classification of , where the suffix notation indicating the spectrum shows very strong lines of Strontium and Chromium. The star has about double the solar radius and is radiating 17 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 8,300 K. Stellar evolution models indicate its properties are consistent with a mass of 1.91 times the solar mass and an age of 680 million years. Xi Phoenicis has a strong magnetic field that varies with the stellar rotation period. It can be modeled as a dipolar field with a polar strength of , inclined by 88¬∞ in relation to the rotation axis of the star. The reconstruction of the stellar surface by Doppler imaging showed it is heterogenous with regions of different chemical abundances, which seem to be associated to the geometry of the magnetic field. For instance, lithium and oxygen have high abundances in the magnetic poles and low abundances in the magnetic equator, while elements like silicon and lanthanum are concentrated in a region between the magnetic equator and poles. However, these results have been contested, and it is possible the abundance maps are spurious due to the strong magnetic field. An Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable, Xi Phoenicis's visual magnitude varies between 5.68 and 5.78 with a period of 3.9516 days, which is the rotation period of the star and is also associated with changes in the spectrum and the magnetic field. The brightness variation is maximum in the v band, with an amplitude of 0.13 magnitudes. The light curve in this band is symmetrical and has two distinct minima separated by half a rotation period, while the two maxima are igual. In other bands the variability is smaller or even absent, and doesn't show a regular pattern like in v. The star is similar in many aspects to rapidly oscillating Ap stars, but does not display the rapid pulsations typical of these stars. Secondary star Xi Phoenicis is known as a double star since 1834, the date of the first registered observation in the Washington Double Star Catalogue. The relative position of the two components has remained constant to this day, confirming they have a common proper motion and form a physical binary system. The secondary star has a visual apparent magnitude of 9.95 and in 2007 was located at an angular separation of 13.06 arcseconds and position angle of 252.5¬∞, in relation to the primary. Considering the distance to the system, this corresponds to a projected separation of 875 AU between the stars. The mass of the secondary is estimated at 0.81 times the solar mass. This star is in the second catalogue of the Gaia spacecraft, which measured independently a distance equal to that of the primary, and estimated a radius of 0.76 , luminosity of 0.33 , and effective temperature of 5,000 K.

He served as Alauddin Khalji's governor of Malwa and Devagiri, and after Alauddin's death, suppressed a revolt in Gujarat.  Early life  There is negligible information on the early life of Ayn al-Mulk Multani. His actual name is unknown: \\"\`Ayn Al-Mulk\\" is a title (also transliterated as \`Ain ul- Mulk), while Multani is a nisba indicating his association with the city of Multan. The 15th century chronicler Yahya bin Ahmad Sirhindi calls him \\"\`Ayn Al-Mulk-i Shihab\\", which suggests that his father's name was Shihab.  Career   In Alauddin's service  Multani started his career during the reign of Alauddin Khalji (), as a secretary (dabir) to Alauddin's brother Ulugh Khan. According to Alauddin's courtier Amir Khusrau, he was a learned statesman and a veteran military general. The later chronicler Ziauddin Barani describes him as a widely-travelled well-experienced man, who was known for his wise counsel and his ability to tackle complex problems. Barani also mentions that, like Khusrau, he was skilled with both the sword and the pen. In 1305, an army sent by Alauddin invaded Malwa, and defeated the Paramara forces headed by prime minister Koka. It is not clear who commanded this army, but he might have been Multani, as Alauddin later appointed him as the governor of Malwa. Multani played an important role in consolidating Alauddin's rule in Malwa. He raided the former Paramara capital Dhara, where he broke the Dhar iron pillar. He forced the Paramara vassals of Ujjain, Dhar, and Chanderi to acknowledge Alauddin's suzerainty. Subsequently, he invaded Mandu, where the Paramara king Mahalakadeva had taken shelter. His army defeated the Paramaras, and killed Mahalakadeva and his son. When the Devagiri governor Malik Kafur was recalled to Delhi as the viceroy during Alauddin's sickness, Multani was made the governor of Devagiri.  In Mubarak Shah's service  After Alauddin's death, Kafur asked him to come to Delhi, but while he was en route, Kafur directed him to Gujarat. Kafur had executed Alp Khan, the governor of Gujarat, leading to a revolt in the province, and another general Kamal al-Din Gurg had been killed while trying to suppress the revolt. While Multani was on the way to Gujarat, Kafur was killed and Alauddin's son Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah () seized the throne of Delhi. As a result, the nobles accompanying Multani refused to proceed further, and his entourage had to halt at Chittor. After a few days, Mubarak Shah ordered them to proceed to Gujarat and end the rebellion, and Multani resumed his march. In Gujarat, Multani tried to resolve the situation diplomatically. He wrote letters to the rebel leaders, pointing out that Alp Khan's murder had been avenged with Kafur's murder. He asked them to end the rebellion, and warned them of serious consequences if they refused to do so. Most of the rebels agreed to join his camp. Two of the rebels -- Haydar and Zirak -- refused to oblige, and were easily defeated. Multani returned to Delhi after establishing peace and order in Gujarat. In 1318, the Devagiri governor Yak Lakhi staged a rebellion, and Multani was send to subjugate him. Around this time, he was appointed as the wazir.  In Khusrau Khan's service  After Mubarak Shah was killed in 1320, the new Sultan Khusrau Khan honoured Multani with the title \\"Alam Khan\\" to win him over. Subsequently, Ghazi Malik Tughluq, the muqta of Depalpur, tried to persuade Multani and other nobles to rebel against Khusrau Khan and avenge Mubarak Shah's death. When Multani received Tughluq's letter, he was concerned about the presence of Khusrau Khan's agents. Therefore, he took the letter to Khusrau Khan and assured the Sultan of his loyalty. However, when Tughuq wrote a second letter to him, he expressed sympathy with Tughluq's cause. Multani stated that he was surrounded by Khusrau's allies, and therefore, would not take sides in the upcoming battle.  In Tughluq's service  Ghazi Malik Tughluq killed Khusrau after a battle, and ascended the throne of Delhi with the title \\"Ghiyath al-Din\\" (). He appears to have retained Multani in the royal service. According to the chronicler Isami, Multani joined Ulugh Khan (who later ascended the throne of Delhi as Muhammad bin Tughluq, ) on the 1322 expedition to Warangal. Several of Ulugh Khan's officers revolted against him during the prolonged siege, but Multani remained loyal to him. No information about Multani's later life is available. Some medieval chronicles attempt to provide such information, but they have confused Multani with another noble \`Ayn al-Mulk Mahru (called \`Ayn al-Din by Isami). Isami and Barani clearly distinguish between the two men.

The unit was founded in 1976 as the Grupo Especializado de Seguridad (GES; Specialized Security Group). The unit has been involved in confronting numerous protests and civil disturbances, and provides security around the principal government buildings in La Paz, Bolivia's seat of government. Initially, the GES was based in the La Paz's wealthy Zona Sur, in a site currently occupied by the command center of Police District 4. Its current headquarters is in La Paz, on Junin Street just northeast of the Plaza Murillo between Indaburo and Ingavi. GES troops engaged in mutinies during times of social protest in April 2000 and February 2003. UTOP troops have also led police mutinies in June 2012, November 2013, and July 2014. History The Grupo Especializado de Seguridad was created in 1976. During the late 1980s, the GES temporarily assumed counterterrorist functions. In March 1987, French police advisers and Bolivian experts began giving a three-month antiterrorism course ‚Äî consisting of technical and psychological training ‚Äî to 400 GES members. The purpose of the training was to form a special group for responding to hostage-taking incidents.

In April 2000, President Hugo Banzer declared a state of siege in response to the Cochabamba Water War and a general strike by the CSUTCB Peasant Confederation. GES troops refused to participate in policing during the crisis and the government agreed to increases in salary for the police. Amid protests in February 2003 over a proposed tax on salaries and wages, GES troops mutinied on February 11 and left the city center of La Paz unpoliced. The military was mobilized to the central Plaza Murillo, where they exchanged fire with the GES. As of 2003, the GES had 21 officers and 235 troops. In 2013, the government announced the creation of an UTOP unit for El Alto, to consist of 200 troops headquartered in the Huayna Potos√≠ district.

The elements that constitute important nutrient cycles include macronutrients such as nitrogen (as ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate), silicate, phosphorus, and micronutrients, which are found in trace amounts, such as iron. Their cycling within a system is controlled by many biological, chemical, and physical processes. The Columbia River Basin is the largest freshwater system of the Pacific Northwest, and due to its complexity, size, and modification by humans, nutrient cycling within the system is affected by many different components. Both natural and anthropogenic processes are involved in the cycling of nutrients. Natural processes in the system include estuarine mixing of fresh and ocean waters, and climate variability patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (both climatic cycles that affect the amount of regional snowpack and river discharge). Natural sources of nutrients in the Columbia River include weathering, leaf litter, salmon carcasses, runoff from its tributaries, and ocean estuary exchange. Major anthropogenic impacts to nutrients in the basin are due to fertilizers from agriculture, sewage systems, logging, and the construction of dams. Nutrients dynamics vary in the river basin from the headwaters to the main river and dams, to finally reaching the Columbia River estuary and ocean. Upstream in the headwaters, salmon runs are the main source of nutrients. Dams along the river impact nutrient cycling by increasing residence time of nutrients, and reducing the transport of silicate to the estuary, which directly impacts diatoms, a type of phytoplankton. The dams are also a barrier to salmon migration, and can increase the amount of methane locally produced. The Columbia River estuary exports high rates of nutrients into the Pacific Ocean; with the exception of nitrogen, which is delivered into the estuary by ocean upwelling sources.  Description  Columbia Basin The Columbia River basin is a major watershed and the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Extending from southern British Columbia to northern Nevada, the watershed includes seven American states and two Canadian provinces and drains an area of about 260,000 square miles. The Columbia River stretches 1,620 miles in length until its discharge into the Pacific Ocean near Astoria, Oregon. The average annual discharge rate of the Columbia River changes due to climate and land-use variability, but generally ranges from 120,000 to 260,000 cubic feet per second. Finally, the population of the Columbia River Basin within the United States is about 4.6 million people (per the 2000 census). The water cycle in the Columbia River is dependent on the relation between water flow and topography in the basin. Within the United States, only the Missouri-Mississippi River system has annual runoff greater than that of the Columbia River. The amount of water that the river carries each year is determined by the precipitation, sunlight, and air temperature in the basin, which varies from year to year. West of the Cascade Range, most of the winter precipitation falls as rain, but in the Cascade Mountains and eastward, precipitation through winter is snow. Snowmelt in the mountains begins to reach the river during early to mid-spring. About 30 percent of the streamflow in the Columbia River occurs between January and March (primarily from rainfall) and about 30 percent occurs between April and June (from a combination of rainfall and snowmelt).  Natural processes  Coastal upwelling, river discharge, tidal mixing, estuarine circulation, climate oscillation, and remineralization, are sources or sinks for the Columbia River basin nutrient budget. Due to these transport processes the Columbia River Estuary provides large nutrient sources to the adjacent sub-arctic Northeast Pacific coastal surface water. Nitrogen is added to rivers through many natural processes, such as the decomposition of leaf litter and organic matter. Nitrogen gas is the most abundant molecule in earth's atmosphere, comprising about 78 percent of the total composition of air, however not typically a large source of nitrogen to the river. This form of nitrogen, dinitrogen gas (N2), is inert and biologically unavailable to most living organisms. However, some bacteria and archaea can utilize nitrogen fixation to convert dinitrogen into ammonia or other compounds accessible to organisms. Finally, nitrogen load at the Columbia River mouth is about 2-20 times larger than that at the Canadian border. This gradient in nitrogen distribution is partly a result of the inputs of the Columbia's major tributaries, the Snake River and the Willamette River. The Snake and Willamette rivers together contribute about 50-80 percent of the nitrogen load in a given year, coming from activities within those respective watersheds.  Weathering and runoff  Weathering is the break down of rocks, soil, and minerals through contact with water, the atmosphere, and biological organisms, converting solid phase minerals to dissolved phase compounds. This process can introduce nutrients, most notably phosphorus, into the Columbia watershed. Both chemical and physical weathering occur, usually together, and this coupling tends to accelerate the other. Precipitation varies across the basin, influencing the amount of weathering and subsequent runoff that transports this material into the basin. Organic matter such as leaves may also naturally fall into the waterways through runoff. Over time, this material is respired, releasing assimilated nutrients into the environment.  Salmon impacts on nutrient cycling  An important source of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, for rivers in the Pacific Northwest is the spawning of salmon and subsequent death and decomposition of fish up-river. Every fall, ocean salmon at the end of their life cycle swim upriver to spawn before they die. The remineralization of their organic matter releases significant nitrogen loads into the river, although recent decades have observed decreased salmon runs and subsequently less impact on the total nitrogen budget. Salmon are an anadromous family of fish that rear in freshwater, migrate to the ocean as juveniles, and then return to the freshwater as adults to lay their eggs and die in what is called a salmon run. Their death and subsequent decomposition releases substantial amounts of nitrogen and lower amounts of phosphorus into the system, boosting the productivity of local headwaters and serving as a vector of material transport across the ocean to watershed interface. Studies have estimated salmon in some parts of the Columbia river contribute up to 60 percent of nitrogen to other trophic levels. The regional ubiquity of salmon as a recreational and commercial fishery has led to increased attention on local populations within the Columbia River system. Annual salmon harvests are among the highest-earners of the Pacific Northwest fishery economy; in the lower Columbia River specifically, salmon account for over 84 percent of commercial fish landings. While areas accessible to salmon have been reduced over the past century through the construction of dams and the modification of river channels, this group of fish historically inhabited almost 13,000 miles of the Columbia River basin. Efforts from fishery management and state agencies, as well as the listing of several resident salmon stocks under the protection of the Endangered Species Act, has led to the re-establishment of accessibility to some parts of the Columbia River system for salmon. The regional return of salmon runs restores an important segment of local nutrient cycles, particularly that of nitrogen and phosphorus, to the system.  Estuarine and ocean exchange  The Columbia River Estuary is the most downstream portion of the river that experiences ocean tides, generally defined as the furthest reach of the Columbia River plume to the Bonneville Dam. Here, a transition zone occurs where freshwater discharge from the river meets and mixes with Pacific Ocean saltwater. In this region, physical processes that affect nutrients are the circulation (entrance/exit, movement) of specific water masses with their nutrient load, the magnitude of tidal flow distributing ocean waters inland, and bottom sediment exchange affecting nutrient particle mobility. With the exception of nitrogen, the Columbia River estuary nutrient budget tends to be dominated by nutrient transport out of the system. During periods of high river flow, generally April to June, the estuary has a daily average residence time of less than a day. Meanwhile, at times of lowest river discharge, typically September to October, this turnover time lengthens to about three days. The turnover time can also vary due to the tidal cycle, and affect the amount of oceanic exchange in the estuary; on the whole the residence time is fairly short. Through a more rapid transit time of waters within the river, local primary production tends to be lower as autotrophic communities are quickly flushed out of the system. Since there is less subsequent biological uptake of nutrients, there is a high rate of nutrient transport out of the Columbia River and into coastal waters. The upwelled waters of the Pacific Ocean have very high concentrations of dissolved nutrients due to the history of biological respiration that has occurred throughout the water masses' time in circulation through the deep ocean. Biological respiration is the consumption of organic matter and concurrent release of nutrients contained in that biomass. This process is an important source for nutrients that other organisms require. Examples of these organisms include phytoplankton and algae, whose communities are often limited in growth by the availability of specific nutrients, most commonly nitrogen which is the primary limiting nutrient the Columbia River. In addition, to nitrogen, iron, and silicate cycling in the estuary can impact local and coastal ocean phytoplankton communities. = Nitrate = Due to coastal upwelling, ocean sources of nitrate (an oxidized form of nitrogen) exceed river sources by a magnitude of roughly 3 to 1, and is a primary source of nitrogen for the Columbia River Estuary. This is evident within the estuary by the positively correlated relationship of nitrate availability and salinity, the latter an identifying characteristic of highly saline marine waters. As a result of differences in delivery to the system, nitrate is the primary limiting nutrient in the estuary. Consequently, during seasonal periods of downwelling when less ocean water is mixed into the estuary, local nitrate concentrations may be very low. Thus, nutrient cycling and primary production in the estuary are heavily linked with the seasonal winds off the Oregon and Washington coasts that control local ocean upwelling and downwelling. = Phosphate = Although phosphorus is of interest in the mid-river, especially in and around reservoirs throughout the Columbia River Basin as discussed below, it is not typically a limiting nutrient for biological communities within the estuary. As a result, there is little available literature on phosphate cycling within the estuary. Aerial view of Columbia River and Bonneville Dam = Iron = The primary source of iron into the estuary is from geologic rock weathering and subsequent runoff delivery to the system. In addition, some iron may come from the Pacific Ocean and is transported into the estuary during tidal oscillation, enhanced seasonally during periods of upwelling. Iron inputs derived from riverine and oceanic origins are typically on the magnitude of 14-30 nM and 6 nM in concentration respectively. These sources of iron are generally sufficient to meet biological demands, including those of primary production, in the estuary and upriver. Consequently, iron is commonly not the limiting nutrient in the system; rather, the river depending on season and flow may serve as a net source of iron to iron-deficient coastal regions of the Northeast Pacific, sometimes referred to as areas of High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll. = Silicate = As discussed in more detail below, dams can cause large scale hydrological changes by forming reservoirs. These reservoirs can act as nutrient traps altering nutrient ratios and reducing silicate transport through rivers and into the estuary. Since mid twentieth-century dam construction on the Columbia river, seasonal silicate transport out of the Columbia River Estuary has shifted in magnitude since the historical, pre-alteration of the river hydrology. Outside the estuary, the Columbia river is a source of silicate for the sub-arctic Northeast Pacific coast. Silicate is a required nutrient for diatoms, which form siliceous shells, within the surface waters of this coastal region. The observed shift in silicate transport out of the Columbia River estuary since 1970 has resulted in the development of seasonal silicate limited regions of diatom production in coastal waters near the estuary.  PDO and ENSO  Nutrient dynamics are also affected on a long-term scale by human and climate influences. Specifically, the Columbia River discharge rates, which govern bulk nutrient transport, follow Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This is because of how these oscillations affect regional air temperature, precipitation patterns, and off shore wind, which in turn affect annual snowpack, sea surface temperatures, and upwelling and downwelling trends. Changes in these trends can alter the magnitude of runoff from land incorporated into the Columbia River system as well as coastal ocean inflow, which ultimately alter nutrient loading by either bringing in additional nutrients or washing them out. Research indicates dam construction on the river has affected the strength of PDO and ENSO's influence through alteration of runoff residence times, but to date these effects have not been well described. Since 1858, total silicate transport has decreased by 50 percent, with 10 percent of that decrease directly linked to these climate oscillations. This alteration of net nutrient transport is critical to determining nutrient distribution and availability throughout the basin. Silicate, for example, may direct nutrient cycling by altering environmental parameters implicated in primary production by organisms, including river depth, flood frequency, and turbidity.  Greening of the estuary  It has been observed that the Columbia River estuary is \\"greening\\". \\"Greening\\" of the estuary describes the movement of phytoplankton blooms that historically occurred outside the mouth of the river, and are now blooming much more frequently inside the estuary, effectively \\"greening\\" the river surface with colored microscopic organisms. Primary production in this region is often dominated by diatom species such as Skeletomema costatum, Chaetoceros spp. and Thalassiosira spp. which bloom seasonally in spring and summer. Large blooms of these species consume the available nitrogen in the region, eventually hindering the furthering blooming by creating a nitrate-limited growth period. Exacerbating this nitrogen depletion, high estuarine turnover times in the Columbia River Estuary displace these diatoms communities out into the ocean. This export reduces rates of nitrogen remineralization as the available nitrogen consumed by the diatom blooms is removed from the estuary system. The nitrogen-deplete conditions created by these blooms are improved as natural and anthroprogenic macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients are transported into the system by river discharge. The spring-summer seasonality of these diatom blooms is affected by climate, variable with both Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices, and human influences such as dam construction in the watershed. As discussed previously, both climate oscillation and human interaction in the Columbia watershed have been shown decrease transport of nutrients into the estuary. As an example of human impacts on this system, the increased footprint of water reservoirs caused by damning of the Columbia River has resulted in a standing pools of nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus. These nutrients mostly stay within the watershed during winter months instead of discharging to the ocean, as river discharge rates are controlled by dam release schedules. As a result, these nutrients and organic matter are locally biochemically processed by plankton communities, increasing the biomass of life within the system, and resulting in high nutrient releases in spring and summer months when dam flow through is increased. As a result, this anthroprogenic discharge cycle contributes to the seasonality of diatom blooms in the estuary. Unlike other large estuaries, such as the Chesapeake Bay Estuary, the Columbia River supplies little nitrate to the estuary relative to the overall local nitrogen budget. Rather, the primary source of nitrate into the estuary is from ocean exchange caused by wind-driven seasonal upwelling off the Oregon and Washington coasts. This influx of nitrate, generally the primary limiting nutrient to biological communities in the estuary, is an important driver of primary productivity in estuarine plumes of river discharge. Moreover, large scale upwelling on the Oregon-Washington coast typically occurs in spring and summer, and as discussed previously, is coupled with the PDO and ENSO, this seasonal upwelling further contributes to diatom bloom in the estuary. Finally, without this source of nitrogen through upwelling, the estuary quickly becomes nitrate limited and hinders further facilitation of biological activity.  Red blooms  Red bloom in a harbor. The vibrant color of the blooms attracts attention from scientists and local community members. Red blooms, a type of plankton bloom with a characteristic scarlet pigment, occur every year in the Columbia River estuary, lasting several months during late summer to early fall. The marine ciliate Myrionecta rubra is responsible for this annual discoloration. Research has found that while not toxic, dense blooms of M. rubra can impact estuaries, fjords, and upwelling areas and have been associated with high rates of local primary production. M. rubra gets its red color from consuming cryptophytes, or algae, that contain a red pigment called phycoerythrin in their chloroplasts.Sherry, Elisabeth J. (2015). \\"A Model of Mesodinium Rubrum Blooms in the Columbia River Estuary.\\" (Doctoral dissertation). In the Columbia River estuary, M. rubra commonly preys on the cryptophyte Teleaulax amphioxeia. From its prey, M. rubra also acquires specialty cellular organs in order to photosynthesize and effectively absorbs these compounds into its own body. This process is referred to as \\"acquired phototrophy\\", and for M. rubra includes the assimilation of chloroplasts, nuclei, and mitochondria During the day, the ciliates stay near the surface of the water to photosynthesize, which is how the red blooms are easily observed. One question of interest associated with M. rubra is its ability to spread within the Columbia River estuary in spite of the short residence time of the water. The red blooms have been observed initiating near the river mouth, then establishing throughout the entire lower estuary. M. rubra is quite motile and can swim (1.2 cm / second) and jump (as much as 160 ¬µm in 20 milliseconds), which could explain how they are able to stay within the estuary for months at a time. The blooms have a dramatic impact on the local ecosystem and nutrient levels. Globally, studies have shown that M. rubra blooms are associated with higher levels of bacteria, dissolved organic nutrients, oxygen saturation, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen. Specifically in the Columbia River estuary, red blooms correspond with increased secondary production by microbes and decreased ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon levels. A further study in the Columbia River estuary found that high concentrations of organic nutrients and low amounts of inorganic nitrogen were associated with the red waters. M. rubra blooms also created areas characterized by high primary production and increased levels of particulate organic matter during this period, thus shifting the trophic status in red water areas from net heterotrophy towards autotrophy, making M. rubra's red blooms a seasonal biogeochemical hotspot of the Columbia River estuary.  Anthropogenic impacts on processes  Nutrient cycling is affected by human alteration referred to as anthropogenic impacts. The Columbia River Basin is home to nearly five million residents, and the rapid alteration of land in the past several centuries has shifted many aspects of nutrient dynamics within this environment. Human processes such as construction (such as for dams), logging, and mining can impact sediment transport, resulting in decreased accumulation and/or the enhancement or removal of nutrients. The cycling of nutrients within the Columbia River Basin is also affected by differences in land-use through variability in human development and vegetation. Land use of the basin within the United States is primarily forested (87 percent), with 11 percent of land used for agriculture, and 2 percent for urban areas.  Agriculture  Human-related activity has contributed over 50 percent of the available global reactive nitrogen. The Haber-Bosch process is an artificial means of nitrogen fixation, producing over 450 million tons of ammonia per year. Much of this yield is used for agricultural purposes through fertilizers. Agricultural sources of nitrogen reach rivers primarily through the erosion of soil sediments, but also through airborne dust and gaseous transport of volatilized NH3 from livestock manure and fertilizers. At the beginning of the twentieth century, agriculture began to exceed mining and became the Columbia River Basin's primary economic industry. The Columbia River has been subject to cultural eutrophication in part due to the use of the river and its tributaries to irrigate over seven million acres of farmland, an extraction that comprises an average of 93 percent of daily water use in the basin. Natural run-off caused by precipitation and snowpack melt across agricultural lands further transports more of these nutrients into the river. In the late 1990s, the nitrogen load in the Columbia river was over twice the concentration historically observed.  Logging  Forests are important terrestrial sinks for nutrients due to the ability of vegetation to sequester excess nutrients into their biomass. Additionally, plant roots stabilize soils and consequently prevent a large portion of the nutrient pool to be transferred via runoff into rivers and other waterways. Studies of nearby Pacific Northwest forests have found that logged forests lose 1.6 to 3 times the amount of nutrients over several years times compared to undisturbed areas. By 1992, 35 percent of the total harvestable forest in the Columbia River Basin had been logged. Consequently, though direct quantification of these processes within the Columbia River watershed have not yet occurred, the ubiquitous changes in land-use by the logging industry have changed the delivery of nutrients into the system.  Sewage and septic inputs  A significant nutrient source from developed areas into aquatic ecosystems is through sewage and septic systems. Municipal waste, high in nitrogen and phosphorus, is sometimes treated by wastewater facilities or through soil filtration, but often some excess nutrients leak and contribute to eutrophication. Human sewage waste in the United States accounts for about 12 percent of average annual nitrogen input into rivers. Often, there are many small-scale sources of this discharge and no one input is clearly dominating nutrient loading. However, occasionally unexpected events, usually through sewer systems or at wastewater plants, occur that result in a significant singular emission. In the fall of 2017 for example, a power failure at a treatment facility in Vancouver, Washington led to the discharge of over 510,000 gallons of wholly untreated and partially treatment effluent. The continuing background discharge along with larger-scale, periodic emission events comprise a large input of human-derived nutrient loading.  Effects of dams  Map of Columbia River Basin showing locations of dams throughout the basin. The large number of dams has had measurable and lasting impact on the nutrient cycling thought the basin  dams shown in red and yellow.Beginning in the 1930s with the construction of the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams, the Columbia River has experienced significant modification to its flow. Today, the US Army Corps of Engineers recognize over 250 reservoirs, 150 hydroelectric projects, and 18 mainstem dams on the Columbia and its main tributary, the Snake River. Dams have been shown to directly impact nutrient cycling within the Columbia river basin through the formation of reservoirs which dramatically alter river hydrology and discharge rates and as a result constitute a major anthroprogenic impact on nutrient cycling in the river. Due to its size and the large number of dams within the basin, the Columbia River basin is often used as representative case study on how dams an impact nutrient cycling of watersheds in general. Notably, dam construction in the Columbia River Basin has impacted relative nutrient ratios, methane production, and salmon migration. Cascades Rapids prior to construction of the Bonneville Dam. To provide context for the scale of change that dams can effect, the construction of the Bonneville dam in the late 1930s completely submerged the Cascades Rapids, permanently changing the local river hydrology and subsequently altering local nutrient transport and processes in the region. The restriction of flow as well as the creation of standing water upriver of the dams have been linked to deleterious effects on nutrient cycling in similar ecosystems, such as the Murray River Basin in Australia and the Danube River Basin in Europe, through processes such as the alteration of particle residence times and nutrient loading. Arial image of Bonneville dam showing reservoir. Notice the widening of the river and calm water upstream of the dam as compared to the pre-dam photo of the Cascades Rapids. = Nutrient ratios = Macronutrients, such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicate are strongly impacted by increased residence times in reservoirs created by dam construction throughout the Columbia River Basin. Exact nutrient retention rates can vary between 16 and 98 percent depending on local hydrology, reservoir design, and location in the basin. However, this increase in nutrient retention rates in the Columbia River basin has generally modified the relative ratios of available nutrients from their natural state, which has subsequently altered the efficiency of compound usage by primary producers such as diatoms. Diatoms are directly affected by the hydrodynamic changes that reservoirs create. The slow moving, fresh water in reservoirs facilitates high settling rates for siliceous diatom shells, which can both bloom in the reservoir or be carried into the river from upstream. Diatom shells are negatively buoyant and have a natural tenancy to settle, this coupled with the reduced forward momentum of standing water in a reservoir, and the physical barrier a dam increase the settling rate of diatom shells within the reservoir. This high settling rate, coupled with slow dissolution of silicate in freshwater, leads to a net decrease in silicate recycling and reduced silicate transport through the Columbia River Basin and export out of the estuary resulting in a net decrease in the overall silicate budget. These same hydrodynamic changes also result in a net increase in phosphorus and nitrogen recycling in reservoirs. Settling rates for algae, other than diatoms, are slow. Slow settling rates allow for algae to remain in the water column longer, allowing for increased release for organically bound phosphorus and nitrogen into the water column through remineralization. The combine impact of increased silicate retention and increased remineralization of phosphorus and nitrogen can result in high N/Si and P/Si ratios within and below reservoirs; these increased rations can be further compounded by increase nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from eutrophication. The high N/Si and P/Si rations caused by these processes can be harmful to the local ecosystem in the basin; for example, N/Si ratios greater than 1 can result in excess nitrogen relative to diatom requirements, this can promote the growth of other phytoplankton species, negatively affecting diatom communities. This impact of reservoirs on the transport and recycling of silicate, phosphorus, and nitrogen, is not unique to the Columbia River Basin, but has had a measurable impact on the export of these nutrients through the basin and out of the estuary. As discussed in context with the PDO and ENSO, since 1858, total silicate export out of the Columbia river basin through the estuary has decreased over 50 percent with about 40 percent of that reduction liked directly to dam construction. Finally, as discussed above, these changed in nutrient ratios have largely contributed to the greening of the Columbia river estuary. = Methane = Reservoirs often serve as a catchment basin for organic matter such as vegetation, and waste transferred into the river via rainwater runoff. Initially, this organic matter provides a nutrient source; however, as it continues to accumulate and begins to decompose, the respiration of this organic matter can quickly deplete oxygen levels leading to anoxia. Under anoxic conditions, the large amount of organic matter are further broken down through anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis into carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). These decomposition processes can occur rapidly after flooding, when large amount of fresh organic matter are transported into the river, and as a result methane and carbon dioxide release can be large. Anaerobic respiration, which occurs in the absence of highly oxidizing molecular oxygen, utilizes less-oxidized electron acceptors such as nitrate (NO3‚àí). As a result, high levels of anaerobic respiration can result in denitrification. This process of denitrification removes nitrogen from the Columbia River Basin, by converting available nitrogen, important for primary production, from its usable dissolved forms (i.e. NO3‚àí and NO2‚àí) to its gaseous form (N2). = Salmon migration = Dams provide a barrier for migrating fish such as salmon, limiting their abilities to swim upstream. As discussed above, studies in the Pacific Northwest and Scandinavia have demonstrated that migratory fish can provide 30 percent or more of the phosphorus input to oligotrophic lakes. These rates of phosphorus fertilization, as well as similarly high rates of nitrogen fertilization, come from the decomposition of adult carcasses after mating and can be significantly affected by reduced migration caused by dam construction. Research estimates as much as 7 to 15 percent of the migrating salmon stock perish as they cross each consecutive dam. Lower rates of successful salmon migration redistribute the remineralization of nitrogen and phosphorus by reducing nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization upstream of dams, as a result there is a successive reduction in nutrients upstream of each consecutive dam. The redistribution of nutrients in the Columbia River Basin is currently a popular area of research; however, additional data is needed to determine the lasting implications of these changes.  Water quality  The complexity of nutrient cycles is an enduring challenge to understanding ecosystem function. Particularly, in areas of significant habitation and modification by humans, these systems are experiencing rapid periods of alteration from historical precedents within the Columbia river Basin. These shifts in human habitation and impact have further complicated and obscured insights into the behavior of nutrient cycling. As the dominant water system in the Pacific Northwest and the home to nearly five million people, the Columbia River Basin integrates these numerous natural and anthropogenic biogeochemical processes. Consequently, the watershed is a foundational environmental resource, providing the region with many goods and services including jobs, natural materials (timber, fresh water), and recreation at a capital worth recently estimated to be $198 billion annually. However, the efficacy and ability of the system to provide these assets largely hinges upon the function of such essential ecosystem components like nutrient cycling. Perturbations to nutrient cycling may result in deleterious effects to both the environment and to resident human populations, possibly through the emergence of toxic plankton blooms, decreased aesthetic value, dissolved oxygen depletion, and reduced fish stocks. Ultimately, the sustainability of the Columbia River Basin ecosystem and its impact on residents are firmly connected by the function of nutrient cycles.

Prior to it, he had served a total of over 15 years in prison for multiple offenses including drug distribution, burglary, armed robbery, and assault. Early life and career At the age of 9, Dahl began working at the family bakery which was founded by his father James A. \\"Jim\\" Dahl in 1955. Dave often fought with his father because he did not like working there and began smoking cigarettes and using other drugs in his teens. He dropped out of high school in 1980. In 1987, Dahl was incarcerated for the first time after burglarizing a house. He rejoined the bakery in 1989 after accepting a job offer from his brother Glenn before quitting again and moving to Massachusetts, where he served more time in prison for armed robbery. In 1997, Dahl was arrested again in Portland, Oregon, after which he was incarcerated at the Snake River Correctional Institution near Ontario, Oregon. In 2001, he was placed on a drug treatment program and vocational training in computer-aided drafting and design, which he began to teach other prisoners after excelling at the course. Dahl was released from prison on December 27, 2004, after which he rejoined his brother Glenn at the family bakery for the third time. While working at the bakery, Dahl came up with a cornmeal-crusted loaf which he and his brother named \\"Dave's Killer Bread\\" and formed the basis of the new brand. After initial success at local farmers' markets, stores began carrying the brand's products and by 2013, the company had employed over 300 people (approximately one third of whom were ex-felons) at its headquarters in Milwaukie, Oregon. In August 2015, Dave's Killer Bread was acquired by Flowers Foods for $275 million. In 2016, Dahl started an organization known as Discover African Art, for which he opened a flagship showroom in Clackamas, Oregon and a boutique in Portland's Pearl District the following year. In June 2017, the organization contributed to grain shipments bound for a village in Mali. Legal problems In November 2013, Dahl suffered a mental health crisis, after which he reportedly collided with three police cars, sending three officers to the hospital, and fighting with deputies as they arrested him. In October 2014, after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Dahl was found guilty except for insanity on two counts of third-degree assault and one count of unlawful use of a weapon by a Washington County judge, who placed him within the jurisdiction of the state's Psychiatric Security Review Board. In January 2015, Dahl was kept on conditional release under the Board's supervision, with requirements including bans on driving and visiting bars.

She is among the earliest female painters to depict the state. She later patented a photo-finishing process called Pearletta Pictures. Biography Hardinge (n√©e Bumstead) was born March 23, 1824 in New England. She was the youngest child in a middle-class family of nineteen children. Hardinge married Dr. George Hardinge on November 14, 1851. After settling briefly in Brooklyn, the newlyweds left for Texas on January 29, 1852 to secure property Sarah inherited from her brother, Edward (d. May 29, 1850). Hardinge's letters to her family chronicled her life in Houston, Austin, Seguin, and San Antonio and travels around the state. During her time in Texas, she taught school, wrote, and painted. She and George had three sons, Edward (b. July 20, 1852), George (b. February 8, 1854) and Henry (b. 1855). She called the boys \\"our Trio Texans.\\" Hardinge was motivated to bring \\"civilization\\" to Texas. In March 1856, the Hardinge family left Texas, having failed in their efforts to sell the inherited property and been frightened by Indian raids. Hardinge kept a journal of the overland trip from Cibolo to Matagorda Bay, whence they embarked for Boston. Sarah Ann divorced George in 1865. She married the Reverend Harrison Daniels in 1875. In 1869, Hardinge patented a photo-finishing process she named Pearletta Pictures. A wax layer applied to the surface of a photograph softened the image and permitted the addition of color and other special effects. Hardinge died in East Orange, New Jersey in 1913. Works 320x320px Hardinge's watercolors provide some of the earliest images of the Texas territory, which had become part of the United States with the Treaty of Guadalupe ending the Mexican- American war in 1848.

It is performed in patients that would be surgical candidates for resection, but cannot undergo surgery due to insufficient remaining liver tissue. It consists of injecting small radioactive beads loaded with yttrium-90 into the hepatic artery feeding the hepatic lobe in which the tumor is located. This is done with the intent of inducing growth in the contralateral hepatic lobe, not dissimilarly from portal vein embolization (PVE). Medical uses RL is performed in people with liver cancer, both primary such as hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic such as from colon adenocarcinoma. Surgical resection is considered the only curative treatment for liver cancer (other than liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma) but it can only be performed in patients with sufficient remnant liver after resection (amongst other criteria). Both PVE and RL are performed in patients who are not be surgical candidates due to insufficient future liver remnant (FLR), which is advised to be between 20-30% and 30-40% of the native liver volume in healthy and cirrhotic livers, respectively.  Results  Radiation lobectomy is a relatively new application of radioembolization and results are mainly reported in the form of retrospective chart review studies and case reports, without any prospective validation. Most authors report a comparable future liver remnant hypertrophy between portal vein embolization and RL, ranging between 10 and 47% with cases reaching up to 119% with RL. The main difference between the two is the time interval necessary for appropriate hypertrophy, greater for RL. PVE requires a shorter time frame to achieve comparable results, ranging between 2‚Äì6 weeks, while the hypertrophy kinetics of RL are slower but more constant, without significant plateau (some studies report continued hypertrophy up to 9 months). Some authors have even raised concerns regarding PVE and the potential interval disease progression in the embolized and treatment naive lobes while allowing hypertrophy, which is of less concern with RL due to its added tumoricidal effect. Additionally, RL has been demonstrated to aid surgical resection in some cases by inducing a ‚Äúvascular shift‚Äù of tumor masses via necrosis and contraction away from major vascular pedicles, converting patients to resectable status. One study has shown preliminary 600-day survival in 12 out of 13 patients who received RL and subsequent resection. Ultimately, further studies are needed to prospectively compare survival and recurrence outcomes in patients receiving RL versus PVE.  Side effects  Common side effects include fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and anorexia, usually self-limiting. Post-radioembolization syndrome occurs in 20-70% of patients that undergo traditional radioembolization, presenting with shakes, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain/discomfort, and/or cachexia and possibly hemodynamic changes, rarely requiring admission. Unfortunately, most data, if not all, is derived from traditional radioembolization outcomes studies and more will be needed to assess the actual incidence and risk of post-radioembolization syndrome in RL. Complications are abscess formation, biliary complications (biloma, radiation induced cholecystitis and cholangitis, biliary necrosis), gastrointestinal complications (diarrhea, radiation induced gastritis and gastrointestinal ulceration), radiation induced pancreatitis, dermatitis, pneumonitis and lymphopenia.  Procedure  RL is performed by an interventional radiologist in the angiography suite, in a fashion similar to radioembolization. The procedure is composed of two different portions, a planning phase and the actual radiation lobectomy, usually performed in two different sessions: # Planning phase: the patient undergoes planning angiography of the abdominal aorta and its major vessels. The interventional radiologist accesses the femoral artery via Seldinger technique and advances a wire and catheter to the level of the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac axis, injecting contrast in order to delineate the patient‚Äôs anatomy. Utilizing smaller catheters and wires, he does the same thing evaluating the common hepatic artery, gastroduodenal, proper hepatic, left hepatic, right hepatic and phrenic arteries. The purpose of this planning angiogram is to evaluate for anatomical variants and collaterals that need to be coil embolized, in order to minimize the risk of non-target radioembolization. At this point, once the vascular anatomy has been delineated and necessary vessels have been embolized, the physician will inject 4-5 mCi of tc-99m macroaggregated albumin (MAA) in order to evaluate hepatopulmonary shunting, which serves as a proxy in assessing the risk of developing radiation pneumonitis. The dose of yttrium-90 to be infused is calculated with the manufacturer‚Äôs formula based on lung shunting, body surface area, liver and tumor volume. # Radiation lobectomy: after gaining femoral artery access and advancing a catheter in the right hepatic artery (most often), 90Y microspheres are infused in a lobar fashion, optimizing tumor and parenchymal coverage. Once the procedure has been completed, the patient is usually sent to the nuclear medicine department where a Bremsstrahlung scan will demonstrate the distribution of the radioactive material and assess for non-target embolization. Often, patients are started on proton pump inhibitors (with the addition of ursodeoxycholic acid - based on each center‚Äôs protocol) for gastro-hepatic protection with or without a low-dose corticosteroid for prevention of post radioembolization syndrome and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic when the gallbladder is present (both per center protocol).  Follow-up  Patients undergo cross-sectional imaging at approximately 30‚Äì60 days from the procedure for evaluation of the degree of hypertrophy undergone by the contralateral side (as assessed by future liver remnant) and to assess tumor burden. At this time, the surgeons and/or a multi-specialty tumor board will convene to determine if the patient can/should undergo safe surgical resection.

Root joined Fraternity Lodge of Gloucester, Massachusetts, May 22, 1862, at the institution of the Lodge, and joined the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, February 22, 1865. For over 50 years, Root gave her influence and energies for the principles of Good Templary and the cause of temperance. Early years and education Amanda Lane, daughter of Samuel and Martha Lane, was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts, July 9, 1889. She was educated in the public schools of her native town. Career For several years, she worked as a book-keeper for her father, who was largely engaged in the fishing trade. In her public career, she rendered eminent service to the Universalist church and to the temperance cause. For many years a member of the Universalist church in Gloucester, she has ably represented that body in the local and State bodies, and the State in the General Convention. Identified with the Woman's Centenary Association from its organization in 1871, at which time she became its Recording Secretary, she was subsequently chosen Vice-President for Massachusetts, having oversight of the woman's work in that State, a position which she most acceptably filled till the pressure of other duties compelled her to resign. She is best known to the public at large in connection with her position and influence in the temperance reform. Gloucester, the headquarters of the salt-water fisheries, was, because of the peculiar character of the men who went on the fishing fleet, greatly demoralized at times by the excessive use of intoxicants. These special occasions are when the more than 5,000 fishermen are, at the close of the fishing season, thrown upon the place with plenty of money, and too often under the sway of evil passions. Her first public work as associated with others in the temperance cause, was in connection with a division of the Sons of Temperance, in which she occupied a prominent position, and was untiring in her efforts to secure the results at which it aimed. In 1862, when Good Templars, distinguished by its fundamental principle that woman is equally entitled with man to the labors and honors of temperance workers, began to establish its Lodges in Massachusetts, Root, seeing in such an organization an indication of justice and of wisdom, and an opportunity for the best results, united with several of her friends in seeking a charter for Fraternity Lodge, which was instituted in Gloucester in May, of that year. The second highest place in the organization was assigned to her, and at the close of the first term, her manifest abilities created the demand for her becoming the executive and highest officer in the Lodge. Subsequently her services were unanimously sought, and cheerfully rendered, in other positions of responsibility and trust. During her connection with the Lodge, and mainly by her devotion and fidelity to its work, it became the largest Lodge in the State, and was noted for its high rank in usefulness. In 1865, Root became a member of the Grand Lodge of the State, and such was her reputation in the Order that she was at once elected to one of the highest and most responsible positions in that body. In 1866 and again in 1874, she was a member of the committee to receive, in behalf of the Grand Lodge, the Right Worthy Grand Lodge, and was at each of these sessions a delegate to the supreme body of the Order. At the first of these sessions of the supreme body, she was chosen Right Worthy Grand Vice-Templar, receiving 49 of the 51 votes cast; and on the following year was unanimously re-elected. Her services were acceptably rendered on Committees on Constitutions and on the State of the Order, two of the most important committees of the Order. At the session of the Right Worthy Grand Lodge, in Bloomington, Illinois, she was again elected to the office of Right Worthy Grand Vice-Templar, and was chosen by the New England Representatives to speak for New England at the Public Reception Meeting. She was in attendance at many sessions of the Right Worthy Grand Lodge, a body composed of the leading temperance men and women of all sections of the world. In 1878, she was elected Grand Worthy Secretary of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, an office imposing arduous duty, and a difficult position to fill with the approval of such a large and mixed membership; but such was her fidelity, promptness, courtesy and great ability, that she was twice unanimously re-elected. Of her temperance work as a whole, and especially of her labors as a Good Templar, it is not too much to say that her eloquent appeals on the public platform, and her magnetic power in the Lodge- room have been more widely recognized, and brought her into greater prominence than has fallen to the lot of any other woman in New England. While she has avoided, so far as was consistent with her official duties, the notoriety of public life, her earnest speech and her whole-hearted devotion to the temperance cause made for her a reputation which brought constant invitations for her services in the public platform. Personal life In 1876, she married Solomon F. Boot, then of Hinsdale, Massachusetts. They made their home in East Douglas, Massachusetts. She had two children.

The Awesomes Professor Dr. Jeremy \\"Prock\\" Awesome Professor Dr. Jeremy \\"Prock\\" Awesome (voiced by Seth Meyers) - The son of Mr. Awesome. Jeremy Awesome is the young new leader of the Awesomes. Known as Prock (a portmanteau of Professor and Doctor, since Prock has a JD and an MD) he has always wanted to be a superhero like his father, Mr. Awesome. Prock disappointingly doesn't have any of his father's impressive physical powers: indeed, he is unimposing and injury-prone. However, he's the smartest on the team and a natural leader: in a crisis he comes up with excellent plans and assigns jobs to everyone on the team. For some reason, Prock has so far chosen to keep his other powers hidden from his teammates, likely because they may want to use it for personal gain: he has low-level chronokinesis i.e. can stop time for ten-second increments (he can stop it for longer, but he revealed in \\"Euro-Awesomes\\" that doing so really hurts, often in the form of nosebleeds or cranial trauma), and he is also immune to mind control as his father was. Prock lied to his father that he no longer uses his time power, as doctors told him continuing to use it would kill him. His blind spot is that he has a huge crush on Hotwire, which is why she's on the team and it sometimes gets in the way. Prock wears a blue jumpsuit with a black utility belt and has a golden \\"A\\" on his chest similar to his father. Harry \\"Muscleman\\" Strong Harry \\"Muscleman\\" Strong (voiced by Ike Barinholtz) - Prock's best friend from childhood since their fathers were teammates in the original Awesomes. He inherited his superhero name - along with superhuman strength (up to two thousand tons with effort) and invulnerability - from his father and grandfather before him. Muscleman likes to stay on the positive side of everything, which can get a little annoying. He wears a red singlet with black tights and black cuffs and also has an extremely large amount of chest hair. It was revealed in a season 2 episode that he is Jewish. In the first episode of season 3 it is revealed that although he lacks intellect, he has a natural talent for picking up foreign languages. He was able to fluently talk to dolphins just by spending a couple of hours with one. Connie \\"Concierge\\" Connie \\"Concierge\\" (voiced by Emily Spivey) - The secretary of the new Awesomes, who helped Prock and Muscleman recruit the others (mostly from an old reject pile). While not seen by the others as a superhero, she is very intelligent and organized. Concierge is present on most missions, often seen with a tablet computer, filling in with needed resources that others often lack. Concierge ended up with the job only because she was the last of the old staff to say \\"Not it,\\" though now she likes it. In the episode People vs Perfect Man, she officially becomes a superhero and member of the Awesomes. Zip \\"Frantic\\" Danger Zip \\"Frantic\\" Danger (voiced by Taran Killam) - His power is superhuman speed. It's said that he's the third fastest in the world and he can run 500 miles an hour. It's currently unknown how he acquired his powers, but his parents, who run a circus in the southern United States and are verbally and psychologically abusive towards Frantic, think he's a failure since his abilities have little use in their work. He's hyperactive (to the point that he was rejected by the Awesomes during Mr. Awesome's tenure as leader for that reason) and in a hurry to do the right thing. He looks up to Prock. His quirky personality often butts heads with the other members, as he often desires attention and fame. His standardized superpower level is 7. He wears yellow and white tights that resemble lightning. It was also revealed in \\"The Awesomes' Awesome Show,\\" that he is gay. Arlene \\"Gadget Gal\\" Arlene \\"Gadget Gal\\" (voiced by Paula Pell) - The only active original member of The Awesomes. She aged and decided to retire, but Prock convinced her to return when a rejuvenation ray made her 25 again. Her superpower is her reflexes and physical prowess, often with improvised objects from her purse; Gadget Gal can turn anything within her grasp into a weapon. She is also known for her frequent 1940s anachronisms and her unintended racial or sexual slurs. In the Season 3 episode 'Villain-Tine's Day' her first name is revealed to be Arlene. Austin \\"Impresario\\" Sullivan Austin \\"Impresario\\" Sullivan (voiced by Kenan Thompson) - A \\"mama's boy\\" whose power is the conjuring of anything he can imagine using a mysterious jewel he found in the woods. Unfortunately, everything he conjures has his mother's face and voice; this was the reason he was once rejected by the Awesomes. He wears a purple and pink tuxedo and a jeweled turban. In the episode, \\"Baby Got Backstory\\" his mother reveals that his powers don't come from his gem and that she lied to him to help him realize his potential and that the gem is actually one of her earrings. In the episode \\"Made Man\\" he became able to create constructs without his mom's face. The removal of this limitation, combined with his standardized superpower level of 8 (superheroes of level 8 and up being scarce), has made him one of the most powerful superheroes in the world. But, at the end of the episode, he catches his mother having sex with Made Man, causing his constructs to have his mother's face and voice again. His credit card, much to his chagrin, is constantly used by other people. Tim 'Timothy' \\"Sumo\\" Tim 'Timothy' \\"Sumo\\" (voiced by Bobby Lee) - Initially known only by his first name, he's only 11 years old but extremely powerful; he was only rejected earlier because of his age. In a manner similar to The Incredible Hulk, he can transform into a sumo wrestler when injured or angered, and in this form he appears to be even stronger than Muscleman. His standardized superpower level is 9, making him even more powerful than Impresario. Tim wears no costume. His Sumo form is the embodiment of his rage, it is established in 'Robo-Therapy' that if he works out his anger issues, the best he can do is a mildly dissatisfied Japanese man. His parents are in hiding from their past conflicts from the villain group, the IT Department, and have entrusted The Awesomes with Tim's care. He is part Korean from his mother and part Japanese from his father. Katherine \\"Hotwire\\" Malocchio Katherine \\"Hotwire\\" Malocchio (voiced by Rashida Jones) - Her power is manipulating electricity, hence her superhero name. It is unknown to the rest of the team when she first joins, but she is Dr. Malocchio's daughter, who was the one who had her try out in the first place. It is revealed in the second season that she and her brother, Giuseppe Malocchio Jr., enjoyed an especially close relationship when they were younger. Concierge doesn't trust her at first because she cannot find anything about her background. Prock is oblivious to these concerns because of his almost childish crush on her. Hotwire is revealed to already be dating Perfect Man when she is introduced on the show in the second episode. Despite this, he seems to know very little about her, including the fact that she has an engineering degree from MIT. After faking her own death at the end of season one, she returned in season two wearing an armored battle suit of her own design and manufacturing (similar to Iron Man), powered by her own electrical output, and fighting crime under the alias Metal Fella. The name, the design of the suit, and a manipulated voice lead everyone to believe that Metal Fella is a man. In \\"Euro-Awesomes,\\" she revealed her true identity and rejoined the Awesomes. In season three, she has a different appearance with her hair much shorter and wears pink gauntlets and rocket boots that are similar to the ones on her Metal Fella suit. As of season three, Prock and Hotwire are dating and in the episode \\"The Dames of Danger\\" she is revealed to be pregnant. In the season three finale, she and Prock are shown at the end of the episode holding their infant daughter who bears a resemblance to Hotwire but with Prock's eye colour. Perfect Man Awesome Perfect Man Awesome (voiced by Josh Meyers) - Arrogant, publicity-seeking but lovable Perfect Man is a former member of the original Awesomes, who has gone solo. At the beginning of the series, he's dating Hotwire although he considers it a casual relationship. Perfect Man can fly and has telescopic vision and x-ray vision. He has awesome hair and an extremely muscular physique. He wears red tights with a gold cape and a cursive \\"P\\" on his chest. Dr. Malocchio has hypnotized him not to interfere with the Awesomes or Hotwire's involvement with them. His personality is similar to Booster Gold's when he first appeared in the DC Universe. When he is convicted of high treason, he is imprisoned. After being rescued by The Awesomes, he hides in Awesome Mountain for most of the second season until his name is cleared. As of season three, he's officially a member of The Awesomes, first under Prock, then as Mr. Awesomes' reformed team when they retake Awesome Mountain. In \\"The Gayfather\\", it is revealed that he is in fact Mr. Awesomes illegitimate son, thus making him and Prock half-brothers. His mind was wiped of his past by Dr. Turfenpeltz to ensure this information of his father and mother stays secret. In the season 3 finale, he starts dating Silent But Deadly after he found that she is actually a woman. Unlike his father and half-brother, he doesn't have immunity to mind control. Supervillains Dr. Giuseppe Malocchio Dr. Giuseppe Malocchio (voiced by Bill Hader) - Founder of Malocchio Laboratories in the 1940s, he was the first doctor to study superheroes and was the confidante of many of the world's leading heroes in his quest to understand and isolate the super-gene. Among his partnerships were the original 1940s lineup of The Awesomes, and Mr. Awesome soon became his best friend. Together they worked in the laboratory and co-discovered the super-gene. But Malocchio and Mr. Awesome had different ideas as to how best use their new discovery. Malocchio wanted to use it to make ordinary humans super, and injected himself with the serum. Although originally good, the terrible side effects of the formula turned him monstrously evil. He gained the ability to control human or superhero minds at will. He then used the serum to create an evil army of super-villains, who have battled superheroes for decades, each villain identifiable as one of Malocchio's by the characteristic red eyes; Malocchio means 'evil eye' in Italian. Considered the world's most dangerous super-villain, he was imprisoned. Once the original Awesomes disbanded, he easily escaped from prison by using his mind control on the guards, and even forced them to become his minions. His goal is to convince everyone to surrender their superpowers, ostensibly to protect bystanders from collateral damage. He has a passion for gourmet cooking and is Hotwire's father. Dr. Malocchio is believed to be deceased but is actually living in a secret base with Mr. Awesome, who is attempting to find the cure for the evil super-gene formula. In the season two finale, thanks to the blood transfusion from Mr. Awesome he finally becomes good again but a mishap in the lab resulted in his evil-genes entering into Mr. Awesome's bloodstream making him evil as a result. He agreed to return to Earth to warn the Awesomes about what happened, but was locked out of the escape capsule when he stepped outside to urinate and it drifted away. Suffering from oxygen deprivation and severely amnesiac, Malocchio was rescued by a troupe of space hippies in a psychedelically-painted craft. Unable to recall his mission or even his own name, yet still possessing his culinary skills, he agreed to be the band's chef. But thanks to Perfect Man reminding him who he is by telling he used to sleep with his daughter and saying the word awesome jogged his memory and remembered everything and his mission, he decides to return to earth once more to stop Mr. Awesome's diabolical plan to destroy all of humanity before it is too late. In the episode \\"The Gayfather\\" he finally returns to Earth and warns the Awesomes about Mr. Awesome being evil and happy also knowing he is going be a grandfather when his daughter is pregnant, much to her and the team's shock to see he is alive. Whiskey 'Richard' Dick Whiskey 'Richard' Dick (voiced by Taran Killam) - Appeared in the episode \\"Euro-Awesomes\\" to steal high tech parts from three different labs (one in America and two in Europe) but was killed shortly after revealing that he had been hired to do so (it turned out to be Prock's old mentor Dr. Turfenpeltz). He has the power to render anyone (even robots) drunk so long as they're within a certain range. Dr. Turfenpeltz Dr. Turfenpeltz (voiced by Bobby Moynihan) - He was formerly the chief scientist for the Awesomes and was Prock's mentor and helped Prock to believe in himself and his intellect, after leaving the Awesomes he went to work at a high tech lab. After it was revealed that he had hired Wiskey Dick to steal a high tech part (including one from his own lab) and had tricked both the Awesomes and Euro-Awesomes into gathering in one place, he used a giant robot to start replicating their powers, when he found out that Prock had another power beside his intellect he replicated it and called Prock a fool for never using it, declaring the power to stop time to be the greatest of them all. He ended up defeating himself by stopping time for too long (not knowing that you shouldn't do it for more than 10 seconds). It is shown from Dr. Turfenpeltz's process of weakening that stopping time can cause what appears to be brain hemorrhaging as blood leaks from his ears and eyes. Tomboy Tomboy (voiced by Rachel Dratch) - Female arch-enemy of Gadget Gal, she has battled her for decades and also uses gadgets. In the first episode she--along with Gadget Gal--is affected by a rejuvenation ray that reverses aging. Later during a partially off-screen confrontation, she reveals she is a lesbian and sexually attracted to Gadget Gal but fought her as an enemy for decades as an awkward way of avoiding having to deal with her feelings. The Animal Kingdom The Animal Kingdom - A group of 5 adorable anthropomorphic animals, they're actually violent villains with greater strength than their small size suggests. Seaman Seaman (voiced by Andy Samberg) - An ocean themed superhero turned supervillain who resides in the ocean after leaving the Awesomes due to a conflict with Mr. Awesome. He has a habit of making fish puns, much to the annoyance of Gadget Gal, who pronounces his name as \\"Semen.\\" He became evil out of frustration that ocean life gets no respect and captured the Awesomes to use them as sideshow attractions similar to that of SeaWorld, dubbed LandWorld. Villain-Tine Villain-Tine (voiced by Jack McBrayer) - A supervillain who usually invades every Valentine's Day to steal the world's roses in order to sell them for high prices. The Gay Mafia The Gay Mafia - The world's first openly gay supervillain mafia team, led by the GayFather, who blackmail closeted homosexual celebrities for money in addition to counterfeiting antiques. Their plan was to release a radioactive substance into the city's water supply to induce every gay person to come out of the closet, until Frantic and the Awesomes managed to prevent it. One of the villains, Christopher, starts dating Frantic at the beginning of the episode. However, Christopher ended up agreeing with Frantic that gay people should be able to come out of the closet without being forced, knocks out his boss and betrays the Gay Mafia. The Astoundings A villainous super-team on Earth-4, also known as Opposite Earth, and are the evil counterparts of the Awesomes. Professor Astounding Professor Astounding (voiced by Seth Meyers) - Prock's evil counterpart and leader of the Astoundings. He doesn't appear to have any of Prock's powers, but wears a giant exo-suit that gives him super- strength, shoot laser blasts, control and fire electrical blasts, and flight and is just as intelligent as Prock. He also has greased hair with a blonde streak and speaks with 90s slang. He's revealed to be eviller than his father, Mr. Astounding, the evil counterpart of Mr. Awesome and had a loving relationship with him, the opposite of Prock's relationship with his father. The Beast The Beast - Muscle Man's evil counterpart, but is a giant evil bulldog. He has the same hairstyle as Muscle Man, but is a brown-furred bulldog with sharp fangs and wears a black and red spiked collar. Infobitch Infobitch (voiced by Emily Spivey) - Concierge's evil counterpart, who has spiky blond hair and wears big oval-shaped sunglasses, a green fur coat and black high-heeled boots and wields 2 machine guns. According to Concierge, she looks \\"whorish,\\" but also has style. Kid Meth Kid Meth (voiced by Taran Killam) - Frantic's evil counterpart, who has super-speed as well, but also has green pyrokinetic powers. He has black hair, with a pink streak and wears a spiked collar and a skull T-shirt with the sleeves ripped off. He also wears a silver belt, blue gloves, blue pants, and blue boots. Like Frantic, he's also hyperactive and wears yellow goggles. Unlike Frantic, when he runs, he leaves a purple and green vapor trail, as opposed to Frantic's yellow and white vapor trails. Mercenary Moll Mercenary Moll (voiced by Paula Pell) - Gadget Gal's evil counterpart, who has a spiked hairdo and wears a black jumpsuit with black straps and a yellow and red M emblem, red gloves, red boots, and a yellow utility belt. Unlike Gadget Gal, she wields laser and net guns. Like Gadget Gal, she talks 40s slang. The Conjurer The Conjurer (voiced by Kenan Thompson) - Impresario's evil counterpart, who can also conjure up anything he imagines, but his conjurings are red and don't have his mom's face or voice, unlike the real Impresario. He wears a purple helmet with a purple visor, purple gloves, purple boots, a purple singlet, and a purple cape. Like Impresario, he wears the feather and gem on his helmet. Bad Dragon Bad Dragon (voiced by Bobby Lee) - Sumo's evil counterpart, who has the ability to transform into a sumo dragon with green scales, wings, and a tail. Unlike Sumo, he can breathe fire and can fly. His skin is green with a green dragon symbol on his chest and green horns on his head. Other Hotwire Other Hotwire (voiced by Rashida Jones) - Hotwire's supposedly evil counterpart, who is the most similar to her good counterpart. Other Hotwire was used by Professor Astounding for electrical purposes and had even caused her to become incredibly weak, so he kidnapped Hotwire to replace her. However, Other Hotwire betrayed him and assisted Hotwire in defeating him. She has strawberry blonde hair and wears a blue version of Hotwire's uniform. While the real Hotwire's electricity is blue, Other Hotwire's electricity is pink. Due to constant use of the super weapon, she was drained to the point of death. She uses her last bit of her electricity to help Hotwire before dying. The P.R.I.C.K.S. A super villain team formed by Malocchio Jr and Elliot Levy-Apelstien for the sole purpose of destroying the Awesomes during the episode 'Tim Goes to School' and since then they have been getting a new member every episode i.e. the main villain of that episode. The acronym stands for Primates Really Into Crime and Killing Sprees. Giuseppe Malocchio Jr. Giuseppe Malocchio Jr. (voiced by Will Forte) - The son of renowned supervillain Dr. Malocchio, Jr. was just an accountant. However, after his father \\"dies\\", he inherits a vial of the very serum that turned his father evil. He decides to use the serum on himself, giving him the power of supersonic screams. After this, he decides to commit his life to destroy the Awesomes. In the season 3 finale, he was released from prison thanks to Prock and his family. He is happy knowing his father is alive and became good for while, even though the serum kicked back in and became evil again; he still loves his family and they are enjoying their new lives in Italy since he and his father have been banned from the United States for their crimes. Elliot \\"Jeff Apelstein\\" Levy-Apelstein Elliot \\"Jeff Apelstein\\" Levy-Apelstein (voiced by Colin Quinn) - A talking ape-man from Apesylvania and an acquaintance of Malocchio Jr.; the use of the word \\"Primates\\" in the team's name is presumably due to his membership. Apelstein has an intense hatred for humans and plotted to kill his nephew and his fianc√©e Abby Strong, Muscleman's sister, to prevent them from getting married as well as kill the Awesomes, guests at the wedding, as part of a deal he made with Malocchio Jr. After the plot is foiled by the Awesomes, Jr. injects him with his father's serum and he gains elastic powers. Pablo Pablo (voiced by Bobby Moynihan) - A bully from Tim/Sumo's school who became a member of the P.R.I.C.K.S. after he impressed them by driving Sumo into such a rage that he destroyed the local school and turned against his own team. His powers are geokinesis. Lola \\"The Agravator\\" Gold Lola \\"The Agravator\\" Gold (voiced by Kate McKinnon) - A supervillain with the power to turn people against each other. She used to drive bank tellers crazy so she could rob their banks while they were arguing. That is until she realized there was more money in reality TV, sometime after this she talked the Awesomes into letting her produce their own show and after a while turned them against each other purely for ratings. When she uses her superpowers, she removes her sunglasses revealing she has black and grey eyes and her brain becomes quite visible. She is defeated when Prock convinces a group of actors known as \\"The Fishsticks\\" who wanted their own show to kidnap her, after she is saved by the P.R.I.C.K.S. she joins them. Impresario Clone Impresario Clone (also voiced by Kenan Thompson) - An exact construct copy of Impresario except for a small lump of Impresario's mom and Made Man having sex on his shoulder that he covers with a scarf. Was originally one of many Impresario clones until the original saw his mom and Made Man having sex which triggered a psychological reaction that made the image appear on all of Impresario's constructs which all of the clones saw appear on them which made all but one commit suicide from sheer horror, the last one is determined to destroy Impresario and the rest of the Awesomes for trying to destroy him and forever leaving the lump on his shoulder and thus joined the P.R.I.C.K.S. Fake Santa Claus/Animal Control Fake Santa Claus/Animal Control (voiced by Bobby Moynihan) - Not the real Santa Claus but has the power to mind control animals and humans. He locked up the real Santa Claus and forced everyone at the North Pole to work for him then he used his small amount of control over humans to make parents tell their kids that their Christmas presents came from him and waited 80 years until kids all over the world admired him and would give him their complete loyalty then tried to take over the world. He was then betrayed by Rudolph (whom everyone regards as a total dick) and was \\"killed\\" by the Awesomes. He woke up in a hospital where Malocchio Jr. has fixed him up and made him a new robotic body (which he resents). Fake Santa Claus later joined the P.R.I.C.K.S so he can take revenge on the Awesomes for destroying his body and ruining his plan of taking over the world with kids. Although he was soundly defeated in their final battle, Prock didn't wish to \\"kill\\" Santa twice, so he used his medical know-how to graft Animal Control's head onto the body of a giant slug-like alien. The Replacement Awesomes After Prock's team is kicked off the Awesomes after the city is in ruins, Mr. Awesome (who has turned evil and caused the carnage in secret) takes over with Perfect Man and enlists a new team. They are apparently older members of the Awesomes, but all is not what it seems. Frank \\"Mr. Awesome\\" Awesome Frank \\"Mr. Awesome\\" Awesome (voiced by Steve Higgins) - The founder of the original Awesomes and its leader for the past 60 years, and Prock and Perfect Man's father. Although his powers slow his aging, he announced on his 90th birthday that he was retiring (to outer space, so that he wouldn't be bothered). He wanted Perfect Man to take over - \\"the son I never had\\" - but his actual son Prock volunteered when Perfect Man turned down the offer. Mr. Awesome thinks Prock will never be a superhero because he doesn't have any powers (Prock told his dad that he doesn't use his Time ability anymore). Mr. Awesome's powers are similar to Superman's: superhuman strength, speed, flight, super breath, laser vision, and invulnerability. He wears a red, white, and blue outfit with a red cape and a 100-ton metal \\"A\\" on his crest.

In season 3, he had disbanded Prock's team of Awesomes and is currently running for President of the U.S. as a part of his evil plan to destroy all of humanity. He was well ahead in the polls but that fell apart after a disastrous debate at the town hall for insulting the general public so he made Prock his campaign manager to help him get back in the lead and retrieve evidence that may end his candidacy which reveals he has an illegitimate son who was revealed to be Perfect Man. In the season 3 finale, he finally returns to being good again after Prock injected the antidote in him after he thought he killed Perfect Man.

In season 3 finale, he is revealed to a 47 year old black woman and starts dating Perfect Man. Rocket Boobs Rocket Boobs (voiced by Michelle Wolf) - An African- American woman who looks very similar to RoboCop (metallic body) and Anton Zeck (tech bodysuit with mohawk and visor). Speaks with a valley girl accent and has cybernetic tentacles in her boobs.

Centaur Centaur (voiced by Fred Armisen) - A centaur who make horse puns and gets slapped on the butt by Mr. Awesome to get rid of him. Wields a sword. He is not very bright and self-conscious about his body. Codebraker Codebraker (voiced by Charlie Adler) - The team's computer expert and hacker.

Prock is constantly trying to get it permanently restored, but Joyce won't make it easy on him. Joyce often walks into Awesome mountain unannounced due to the fact that they don't lock the tower. She has also been shown to be rather incompetent, such as when Dr. Malocchio escaped prison she seemed more concerned with shutting down the Awesomes than catching Malocchio, showed no signs of trying to arrest him or prove that he was lying to the public and when he broke into her office she failed to call security. In episode 6 of season 3 (Dames of Danger) she is revealed to have the power to become an unstoppable human battering ram and is also highly sexually aggressive. In \\"The Gayfather\\", it is revealed that she knew Perfect Man was Mr. Awesome's son and Prock's half brother since he was a child.

When seeing the photos, she went into a psychotic rage, trashed her office, broke up with Prock and accepted the offer to join the P.R.I.C.K.S. After joining the P.R.I.C.K.S. she demonstrated enough strength to pick up a large metal table and throw it through a wall despite not being given any of Malocchio's super serum. She admits she can be very focused when angry. Prock calmed Jaclyn with a long, boring story, defusing her jealous rage and turning her righteous anger on Malocchio Jr. She is the only person to join the P.R.I.C.K.S. to not be the main villain of an episode. She later joins the Dames of Danger, using her anger-fueled super strength in combat.

She claimed to despise him (though she admitted she likes the shoes he gave her) but at the end of the episode she admitted she liked him, too and agreed to have sex four times with him and have one awkward phone call.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The building, on a hillside, is a shed-roofed rectangular building constructed in 1936 which housed machinery for amalgamation and concentration of gold ore. It was deemed significant \\"because it reflects the 1930s boom in lode mining in Idaho County caused by higher prices of gold and improved transportation [and] because of its architectural design and its extraordinarily well-preserved interior. Still intact inside the mill are the jaw crusher, ball mill, rake classifier, bucket elevator, and shaker tables, plus drive shafts, water pipes, launders, and miscellaneous other machinery. The flow of ore inside the mill can be followed from the coarse ore bin at the top to the troughs for concentrates at the bottom. The mill only processed ore for a very short period before the company ran out of cash and of gold-bearing ore, but this is typical of many Idaho County lode mines of this period. Gold Point Mines owned the mill and associated claims and other improvements from 1934 until 1957; they sold to the property to Floyd Patrin, who owned it until 1996. The mill itself has excellent integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association.

League of Freedom Titanium Rex Titanium Rex (voiced by Bryan Cranston) is the aged leader of the League of Freedom and main character. Mirroring Superman and his Golden Age counterpart, he is a superpowered man who wears a cape and happens to be the \\"last of his kind\\" which were simply humans who lived underground in the Hollow Earth location of Subtopia. Titanium Rex considered himself the only survivor of a mission to the \\"fabled\\" surface world. Active since the late 1930s, his leadership stems from his super strength, flight, adaptability, and great wisdom. Due to time being fast on the surface of Earth, Titanium aged faster than the Subtopians that are still underground. In his old age, Titanium Rex is hindered by different elderly problems (i.e. back pain, bladder issues, erectile dysfunction) and many people have pressured him to retire. In addition, Titanium Rex and his kind have a weakness to the Anti- Magno Rod. He has affairs with multiple women leading to consequences that affect the plot where he had an affair with the villain Frau Mantis (who mothered Lex Lightning). Titanium Rex's right hand is naturally composed of titanium and it can fire devastating plasma beams. In \\"The Gurman Files,\\" it is revealed that Titanium Rex once used the alter ego of photographer Mel Gurman back in the 1970s until he faked that identity's death in a fire. Since then, Titanium Rex tries to resist working a camera. It was also revealed during the time he operated as Mel Gurman that he once had sex with Jancy Wheelihan much to Black Saturn's disgust. Cooch Cooch (voiced by Heidi Gardner) is an anthropomorphic female tabby cat with a southern accent who is a spoof of Tigra and Rex's pet cat. Crude, filthy, promiscuous, and very distractible, Cooch, however, proves useful when the need arises. She has an on again, off again relationship with Brad. Cooch was once an ordinary tabby cat owned by a woman named Charlotte until she was hit accidentally by Dr. Devizo's Evo-Ray during his fight with Titanium Rex which resulted in her humanoid form and intelligence due to her switching its settings unintentionally from Devo to Evo. Titanium Rex took her in after seeing her attack Dr. Devizo for killing the mouse that she was going to eat Brad Brad (voiced by Tom Root) is an unreliable, colossal pink man with blue hair who is a spoof of Hulk. His strength and large stature come from a pink super serum, and he is powered up by cocaine and heroin. Despite his heroic nature, Brad makes illicit drug deals over the phone. By the end of Season One, Brad sacrifices his life to stop the mainframe that would launch nuclear missiles all over Earth by digging into the lava tunnels underneath the SuperMansion. Black Saturn Black Saturn (voiced by Tucker Gilmore) is a brooding black and purple-clad vigilante spoofing Batman. He has a wide array of gadgets and large chakram-shaped boomerangs are his weapon of choice (though they are never referred to as such and the word \\"ring\\" is used). Unlike Batman, Black Saturn's wealthy parents Cliff and Jancy Wheelihan are still alive and are annoyed with his immaturity, over-dependence, and refusal to get an actual job. He easily gets jealous and throws tantrums much like a teenager. In \\"Black to the Future\\", an overweight Black Saturn travels back in time to stop American Ranger and Zenith from having sex as it results in the conception of their half-god child Gomorrah who grows up to become a supervillain threaten the world. It is revealed that Black Saturn inadvertently caused the death of Rex when he stepped in during Rex's battle with Gomorrah causing Rex to take a blow from Gomorrah that killed Rex who jumped in the way to save Saturn. The Future Black Saturn succeeds in stopping Gomorrah's conception only and returns to his future which has been altered, unfortunately, present Black Saturn messes up the future when he tells American Ranger he could become President, which results in a new future with a power-mad Future American Ranger. Before returning to his future Black Saturn maturely attempts to tell Rex to get rid of his present self before reverting to his former personality on realizing he just saved the future by preventing Gomorrah's existence. However, his warning causes Rex to contemplate kicking him off the team. It is also implied that Future Black Saturn and Future Groaner are a married couple. In \\"The Gurman Files\\", it is revealed that Black Saturn gets his fighting skills from his mother. His real name was also revealed to be C.J. Wheelihan. During a conversation with his sidekick Ringler, he wishes that his parents had been killed in front of him, indicating he wishes he had a darker past. Robobot Robobot (voiced by Zeb Wells) is an introspective and soft- spoken robot man spoofing Red Tornado who is the brains of the group. He renames himself Jewbot after discovering his creator was Jewish and after befriending a rabbi who gives him a hat. It is revealed that he is actually a defective war-bot created by the government and dumped on Rex and the League by Sgt. Agony to save money. This revelation causes him to briefly become Emo and he ends up confronting some fellow war bots that were sold to the League's pizza parlor and turned into animatrons modeled after the league, who original programming he accidentally restored when he repaired them and was inadvertently activated by Courtney. While he attempted to reason with his so- called brothers, Robo-Titanium Rex pointed out that he was defective for being too compassionate and empathetic. He manages to stop his fellow war bots but Robo-Titanium Rex self-destructs destroying the Pizza Parlor but the League manages to get everyone out safely. Jewbot later goes back to using the Robobot name in the episode \\"I Don't Even Have to Use My J.K.\\" confessing that he has given up on Judaism after discovering that his creator was not really Jewish as he previously thought. American Ranger American Ranger (voiced by Keegan-Michael Key) is an exceedingly patriotic superhero (analogous to Captain America) who served in the original League along with Titanium Rex and Omega Ted. Introduced in Season One, American Ranger was placed in a time tunnel after serving in World War II. 70 years later, he rejoins the League of Freedom after being defrosted by a garbageman. Unlike his wife and Titanium Rex, American Ranger hasn't aged due to his preservation. A running gag is that American Ranger has a \\"stuck in a 1940s\\" mindset where he is even unable to grasp the concept of a black president. In Season Two, American Ranger divorces his wife and becomes attracted to Portia Jones after he discovers he is aroused by being dominated by her. He also has an existential crisis after finding out that his pastor had convinced his parents to give up on finding him and encountering the Asteros in \\"Blazarmageddon\\" though he recovers after Asteros is revealed to be fake god. In \\"Black to the Future\\", Zenith seeks to mate with him though he is reluctant until she starts dominating him. This results in a future timeline where Zenith becomes pregnant with his half-god child Gomorrah who becomes a supervillain after being corrupted by her godly powers. But Future Black Saturn prevents Gomorrah's conception. Unfortunately, Black Saturn's present self gives him the idea he could become president, resulting in a power-mad President American Ranger to appear in his daughter's place in the future. In addition to competing with Portia's boyfriend Courtney, he also competes with Sgt. Agony for Portia's attention, though she grows tired of Agony and Ranger fighting over her causing her to choose Courtney over the both of them and leaves the team. Zenith Zenith (voiced by Yvette Nicole Brown) is an original member of the League of Freedom spoofing Thor though also with aspects similar to Storm, Captain Marvel, and Wonder Woman. She left the League of Freedom to host a popular television talk show called \\"A Talk in the Clouds\\" under her real name Portia Jones (a spoof of Oprah Winfrey) where she has a relationship with Courtney. Though Zenith and Rex got along well, Portia herself felt underappreciated despite her attempts to assist Rex as Portia, which later caused her to quit the team. Years later, she was convinced by Titanium Rex to rejoin the League of Freedom to take the place of Brad who was killed during a heroic act of saving the world. Upon Portia becoming the god-like Zenith, she can fly and wields a staff that shoots beams in battle. Zenith is a goddess and a separate identity from Portia who apparently lives with her mother in a heavenly realm. Portia is pursued romantically by American Ranger and Sgt. Agony, but eventually rejects both of them to rekindle her relationship with Courtney by the end of Season Two. In \\"Black to the Future\\", Zenith's mother convinced her to seek out a human mate or her rage caused by not having sex would destroy mankind, though unbeknownst to Zenith, her mother had tricked her so she give her a grandchild. This causes her to seek to mate with Ranger in a misguided attempted to protect the Earth from herself, which results in the conception of their half-god daughter Gomorrah in the future. Unfortunately, Gomorrah was corrupted by being half-god and became a supervillain who joined the Injustice Gang and ended up killing Rex before turning on the other supervillains. Using Robobot's schematics to build an army of robot enforcers she rules Storm City in the future, forcing Black Saturn to travel back in time to stop Gomorrah's conception which he succeeded in doing, foiling her mother's plan to have a grandchild. However, this resulted Zenith being grounded in the Gods' Realm by her mother, preventing Portia from turning into her causing her to think about leaving the League due to her lack of super powers and the trouble her attempts to help the team as Portia had caused. Following the Subtopians' defeat, Portia leaves the League of Freedom much to the dismay of American Ranger and Sgt. Agony. In \\"Home is Where the Shart Is\\", it was mentioned by Courtney that Portia lost her job after her beating up a gimp went viral and she has broken up with Courtney. American Ranger takes the opportunity to reconnect with Portia only for Sgt. Agony to answer the phone. Ringler Ringler (voiced by Breckin Meyer) is the sidekick (spoofing Bucky and Robin) of Black Saturn. Introduced in Season Two, his true identity is Courtney, the dimwitted boyfriend of Portia Jones. He and Black Saturn get along well due to their shared immaturity. The two break up, but Portia ends up taking him back claiming as a complicated woman that she wants an uncomplicated man. But this forces Courtney to give up his superhero alter-ego after Portia quits the team. In \\"Home is Where the Shart Is\\", Ringler reunites with Black Saturn after Portia broke up with him due to him posting the video of her torturing a gimp in Flesh Fest which cost her reputation and her job. Though Groaner warns Ringler to stay out of his way of dealing with Black Saturn. Titanium Lex Titanium Lex (voiced by Jillian Bell) is a beautiful red-haired young woman who is Titanium Rex's illegitimate daughter (spoofing Supergirl). Introduced in Season One, originally Lex Lightning, she visits the League of Freedom to catch up with her father and become a member of the League of Freedom, but is denied multiple times. Although Titanium Rex wants nothing to do with her at first, he later accepts responsibility and becomes a parent to her, though his lingering suspicions lead him to avoid teaching her the full extent of her powers. It is revealed that her mother was Frau Mantis, Titanium Rex's sworn enemy and was left in the care of Dr. Devizo. As a result of Lex having mantis DNA, she has the ability to transform her body physically and biologically from a female to a male and vice versa. She is defeated by Rex in Season One's finale, who blinds her with a point-blank plasma beam after disowning her. By Season Two, Lex has recovered from her blindness and takes over leadership of the Injustice Club that she helped Dr. Devizo to form after she became frustrated with his leadership style and manages to steal the Anti- Magno Rod. As she is only half-Subtopian, she is only partially affected by the Anti-Magno Rod, as exposure to it does cause her to lose control of her bladder however the effect is somewhat delayed allowing her to be near it or hold it for only short periods, though after discovering the embarrassing effect it had on her she wisely elected to keep it contained. But during the Subtopian invasion, she discovers that Dr. Devizo had stolen it from the Injustice Club's safe, which allows him to retake control of the Injustice Club though he ends up joining forces with the league Lex, and Rex to take down her uncle Titanium Dax and the invading Subtopians. While working together with her father to steal a device to release Anti-Magno Rod radiation, she attempts to kill her father but finds herself unable to do so and inadvertently reveals her intended betrayal when her uncle Dax appears. Ultimately her father chooses to stay and battle Dax alone knowing he will likely die. But Lex refuses to leave Rex to die and fights Dax who is disgusted to learn she is Rex's half-Subtopian daughter due surface dweller heritage causing Dax focus on killing her instead. Dax assumes that Rex raised her and taught her only her to reveal she had figured out how to use her Titanium hand on her own and blasts Dax through a wall. Lex implies that the abilities she inherited from her mother allowed her to learn how to use it on her own as Rex had never taught her how to use it. Ultimately, she has a change of heart and rejoins the League of Freedom under the name Titanium Lex name while reconciling with her father following the Subtopian invasion. Though she was the one responsible for saving her father, Dr. Devizo took the credit for his rescue when she fell unconscious after saving Rex, thus she asks her father to speak for her at her upcoming trial as she is still considered a supervillain by the general public who are unaware of her role in saving Rex. Omega Ted Omega Ted (voiced by Tom Root) is a superhero that wields Omega Bands, is the owner of the Omega Pets, and is a member of the original League of Freedom back in World War II.

Many years later, a retired War Bond became neighbors of Swine Kampf. Due to getting hooked on the killing, he blamed American Ranger for it and framed Swine Kampf until the League of Freedom and the Injustice Club subduing Swine Kampf unintentionally exposed him. Villains Dr. Devizo Dr. Devizo (voiced by Chris Pine) is a mad scientist who is a former member of the League of Freedom and the primary antagonist of the series. Dr. Devizo became incensed with anger after learning that Titanium Rex was sleeping with his wife and vowed vengeance against the League of Freedom and the world. It is revealed in Season One that, at some point in his life, he was approached by Frau Mantis to watch over Lex Lightning following a brief fling with Titanium Rex. In addition, he also played a part in the origin of Cooch when he accidentally evolved her with his Evo-Ray gun during a fight with Titanium Rex. In Season Two, Dr. Devizo and Lex Lightning become founders of the latest incarnation of the Injustice Club. However, Lex Lightning makes herself leader upon claiming the Anti-Magno Rod making Dr. Devizo jealous of her.

Titanium Dax Titanium Dax (voiced by Dax Shepard) is a Subtopian warrior who is Titanium Rex's older brother (a spoof of General Zod and Black Adam with some elements of Ocean Master). He appears younger than Titanium Rex due to the aging differences between those who live on the surface and those who live in Subtopia. In Season Two, he comes to the surface in search of his lost younger brother whom he at first assumes has conquered the surface world for Subtopia. Though he is shown to care for his younger brother, he is appalled by his brother's aged appearance and looks down on non-Subtopians. A Subtopian warrior due to being the House of Titanium's eldest son, he invades other lands and enslaves people which causes him to come in conflict with Rex who had left a life in Subtopia behind and is disgusted to learn that Rex had sexual relations with dirt walkers (surface dwellers). But due to being younger and stronger, he easily defeats Rex and the League and attempts to force Rex to activate a Subtopian war beacon but Rex challenges him to fight to the death which forces Dax to swear to kill Rex to preserve his honor according to Subtopian tradition, though Rex defeats him but refuses to kill his own brother. Dax is imprisoned under SuperMansion but his actions make the government believe that Rex is a double agent forcing Rex to abandon the League out of protection. While imprisoned, Dax foils Sgt. Agony's attempts to sell SuperMansion due to him being imprisoned in the basement and threatening that his people will come, which comes true when a female Subtopian comes and frees him. With an army of Subtopians he conquers most of Storm City, forcing the League and Injustice Gang to join forces. Rex's betrayal seems to have caused him to develop an even more deep-seated loathing for surface dwellers as shown when his female underling displays an interest in the surface dweller TV series 2 Broke Girls, the stars of which he orders should be found and executed rejecting the notion of allowing any aspects of the surface dwellers culture to survive, under the pretense that it would give them hope. In addition to seeking to kill his brother, Dax also seeks to kill Lex due to his illegitimate niece being a Subtopian hybrid (which he refers to as a Titanium bastard).

Born in the Congo Free State, she was educated in England and then moved with her mother to Kingston, Jamaica. Marrying at 16, she immigrated with her husband to New York City in 1914. Struggling with racism and her husband's mental illness, she supported her children by working as a domestic and waitress. Through contacts in the theater district, she made the acquaintance of writer Elsa Gidlow, becoming her partner for more than ten years. While living in California, the women worked with builder and jazz musician Roger Somers, and his wife Mary, to create the bohemian community, which would attract many of those involved in the countercultural movements, active in the United States between 1950 and 1970. Early life Grace Isabel Grenfell was born on 4 April 1893 in L√©opoldville in the Congo Free State to Patience Rosanna Edgerley and George Grenfell. Grenfell's father was a missionary and explorer, who mapped the territory of the Congo Basin, including Mount Cameroon and the Lungasi, Mungo, Sanga Yabiang, and Wouri Rivers, opening it up to mission work. After his first wife died, Grenfell began an affair with his housekeeper, Patience, who he soon married. Her mother, was the daughter of Jamaican missionaries who had come to West Africa to establish a Baptist mission in 1843. She was born in Fernando Po, Equatorial Guinea. After her marriage in Victoria, Cameroon, Patience had eight children with Grenfell. \\"Isabel\\", as she was known, was the youngest daughter of the four sisters who survived. She began her education in Bolobo in 1898, but by 1903 had joined her older sisters Carrie and Gertrude, who were attending school at Walthamstow Hall in Sevenoaks, Kent. Her teacher at Walthamstow, was Emily Mary Watts, mother of the writer Alan Watts. Their older sister Patience had already graduated and returned to the Congo in 1897, but died two years later. George Grenfell died on 1 July 1906 in Basoko in the Congo Free State and the family lived briefly in Cornwall near George's family, until it was suggested that they relocate. In 1908, his widow moved to Kingston, Jamaica with Isabel. Both Carrie and Gertrude followed the family and joined them later in Jamaica. On 15 August 1909, Isabel married Arthur Hubert Quallo, in Saint Catherine Parish, Jamaica. Her husband was of African, Jewish, and Spanish descent and operated a hotel. The couple had two daughters, Yolanda (born 1910) and Patience (born 1911) and a set of twin daughters (born 1912) before moving to New York City, in 1914. Four more children followed in New York: Grace Olivia (1915‚Äì1917), George (1917), Phyllis (1919), and Arthur (1922). The marriage was not a happy one for Quallo, and by 1928, her husband was confined in the Dannemora State Hospital, suffering from mental illness. Career Quallo's education, focused on preparation to become a wife, needlework, and dancing, had not given her the skills to support her children adequately. Her husband had spent largely and left no savings. Needing to provide for her large family, she took a position as a domestic worker in the home of a clergyman. She eventually left the job for a better-paying position as a waitress in the theater district and had a fifteen-year relationship with another woman beginning in the early 1930s. Her mother died in 1928, her last living sibling died in 1930, and her husband died in 1935. In 1946, through mutual friends, Quallo was introduced to the writer, Elsa Gidlow, but because Gidlow lived in California and Quallo lived in New York, the two women's relationship began by correspondence. Quallo wrote the first letter and explained in her correspondences, her background, her difficult adjustment to life in the United States because of the prevalent segregation policies, and her relationships. Gidlow soon invited Quallo to come visit and by the middle of 1947, Quallo had come to California, unsure of how long her stay would be. She was concerned about difficulties that might arise because of their association and expressed them to Gidlow saying, \\"A woman who discovers she is a lesbian and is a visible member of a minority has three strikes against her\\". Gidlow assured Quallo that her community was open-minded and there would not be problems. Their friendship quickly turned into a romance, which would last for the next ten years. Quallo moved in to Gidlow's home in Fairfax, Marin County, California. She joined in intellectual evenings hosted there with students and faculty from the American Academy of Asian Studies. The couple came under scrutiny of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities for their interracial association, as well as their contacts with Chinese friends. When Gidlow's mother, Alice May, suffered a stroke and needed permanent care, Quallo agreed to assist her, as she had previously worked as a nurse's aid. They moved Alice in to their home and installed her in a downstairs room fitted with a hospital bed. Quallo provided the constant care Alice needed for the last 9 months of her life, while Gidlow worked as a journalist to provide their support. In 1954, hoping to escape from the increasing urbanization of Fairfax, Gidlow bought a 5-acre property in rural Marin County near Muir Woods. Gidlow wanted to create a community for her varied friends and felt that the atmosphere in Fairfax had shifted. The property had been found by Roger Somers and his wife Mary, but they did not have the funds to make the purchase. Despite the inability of single women to obtain credit at the time, Gidlow was able to borrow funds, after her friend Dorothy Erskine collateralized the loan. The two couples shared the property, naming it Druid Heights, and moved in shortly before the summer solstice. The group renovated the two houses on the property, converted the barns, and piped water for the buildings and gardens. For the first few years, Quallo helped develop the property, which had become a mecca for counter-cultural figures and feminists, but in 1957, she returned to Manhattan to care for two of her daughters who were having health issues. Death and legacy Quallo died on 21 September 1985 in New York City. The letters she wrote to Gidlow are maintained in the archives of the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco.

She was most noted for her taxonomic work on the biodiversity of New Zealand and was recognised as the foremost authority on nomenclature and description of the country's plants. Early life Edgar was born on 27 December 1929 in Christchurch, New Zealand, and grew up in Spreydon with her two sisters. Her family were some of the first European settlers of New Zealand and her aunt, Marion Liddell Fyfe, was the first female lecturer in zoology at the University of Otago. She was educated at Rangi Ruru Girls' School in Merivale, and, encouraged by her mother, then attended Canterbury University College. Edgar graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in classics in 1950 and continued her studies while working as a library assistant for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) earning a Bachelor of Science in botany in 1953. Taking unpaid leave from DSIR, Edgar earned a master's degree with her thesis, The Special Characteristics of Some New Zealand cotulas with Particular Reference to their Breeding Systems in 1957 and then finished her PhD. Her doctoral thesis was The Cytology of the Shoot Apex in some Dicotyledons and was completed in 1960 at Canterbury University College. Career Edgar returned to DSIR in 1959 working in the Botany Division at the Lincoln facility. She worked with Dr Lucy Moore to revise the naming conventions of New Zealand's monocotyledons, particularly working on the varied and extensive rushes and sedges of the country. Their work was published in 1970 as Volume II of the Flora of New Zealand, which catalogued all types of monocotyledons in New Zealand except the grasses. Continuing her work on monocotyledons, Edgar worked on the Flora of New Zealand Volume III with Arthur Healy to identify both the naturalised and native species within each genus. In addition to her forty-nine research papers and four books concerning her taxonomic research, Edgar assembled a compendium of all of the taxonomy publications of the plants of New Zealand. Edgar coordinated and supervised the publication of David J. Galloway's volume Flora of New Zealand: Lichens and then worked with Henry E. Connor to compile the extensive taxonomy of New Zealand's grasses. She retired from DSIR in 1988, but continued to work on the grasses project until it was published in 2000 as Volume V of the Flora of New Zealand series. Edgar was for the first time listed at the senior author for a volume of the Flora. Working as a research fellow for Landcare Research, with Connor, also retired but a research fellow at Canterbury University, the two compiled a study of all currently known grasses in the country's biogeographical region. As grasses are the most important flora in terms of economic and ecologic value to the country, the volume was an important contribution to evaluating the biodiversity of the New Zealand. Edgar described 54 new species and subspecies, mostly of grasses, sedges, and rushes, including 11 species in the genus Poa. She was also recognised as an expert in nomenclature and skilled in both Greek and Latin. Edgar received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and in 1993 the New Zealand Botanical Societies Allan Mere Award. Both Edgar and Connor were recognised with the Royal Society Te ApƒÅrangi's Hutton Medal in 2000 for their work. In 2010, the duo published a revision of Volume V. The Flora of New Zealand series are unique, as all of the descriptions are taken from measurements and notes collected in New Zealand, garnering international recognition. Death and legacy Edgar died on 1 January 2019, in Christchurch, at the age of 89. She was considered the \\"foremost authority on naming and describing plants\\" in New Zealand. Botanist Brian Molloy stated she would be remembered as one of New Zealand's greatest botanists. Three New Zealand species ‚Äî Carex edgariae, Juncus edgariae and Libertia edgariae ‚Äî have been named in her honour.

He went with the American Expeditionary Force during World War 1 and worked as an assistant to the chief surgeon.  Personal life  James Magee was born on January 23, 1883 in County Donegal, Ireland to Edward Carre Magee and Elizabeth Armstrong Magee. He was the fourth son of a Pennsylvania businessman who was working in Ireland. The Magees returned to Pennsylvania where James Magee spent his youth. He attended Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, and received his M.D. in 1905. After graduating he joined the Medical Department as a contract surgeon in 1907 and was commissioned in the Medical Reserve Corps in 1908. He graduated from the Army Medical school in 1909 and joined the medical corps as a first lieutenant. He was part of the American Expeditionary force and went to France from 1917-1919.  World War 1  Magee, who was promoted to Major on May 15, 1917 and traveled to Base Hospital No. 12 in France. In August 1918, he was assigned as assistant to the chief surgeon Colonel Alexander Stark. While working with Stark, he participated in the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives from September - November 1918. He was awarded the Purple Heart for meritorious services in these operations. During World war I, Magee achieved the rank of captain and chief surgeon.  Interwar period  He returned to the United States in June 1919 and commanded the base hospital at McGuire Air Force Base until he was transferred to Fort Sam Houston in December. While at Fort Sam Huston he worked as an instructor for the National Guard Medical Department. In June 1922, he went to Washington, D. C., for the Advanced Course in Preventive Medicine at the Army Medical School. Upon completion, he returned to Fort Sam Houston where he served as the division surgeon for the 2nd Division and commanding officer of the 2nd Medical Regiment.  Death  He died at age 92 at Walter Reed General Hospital and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.  Surgeon general  New Surgeon General James C. Magee Washington, D.C., May 8 On June 1, 1939 he was appointed by President Roosevelt to replace Major General Charles R. Reynolds as Surgeon General of the United States Army. The outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939 and the declaration of a limited national emergency by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that month confronted the new Surgeon General with enormous difficulties as the Army slowly began preparing for war. Magee had to confront the huge problems in preparing the Army Medical Department for its wartime expansion. General Magee's tenure was marked by both successes and criticism. Magee was not a favorite of Army Chief of Staff, General George Marshall and Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, commander of the Services of Supply. This eventually resulted in a major investigation by the War Department's Wadhams Committee from August through November 1942. The committee's final report was issued in November 1942 and outlined recommendations to improve the efficiency of the Army Medical Services. Many of the recommendations were never implemented until early in 1943. Magee's adversaries may have encouraged the Wadhams Committee investigation of the Medical Department in an attempt to remove him from his position but failed. George Marshall was able to convince president Franklin D. Roosevelt to not reappoint him to the position after his four-year term as surgeon general was over. He retired from the position on May 31, 1943.

Dunne and Seven formed the group in the Progress Wrestling (Progress) promotion in July 2016 as a tag team, before adding Bate, who had been Seven's tag team partner as part of Moustache Mountain since April 2015, in November 2016. The group dominated Progress over the following year with Dunne holding the Progress World Championship and Bate and Seven the Progress Tag Team Championship. Though primarily appearing in Progress, the stable has also worked for several other promotions in the United Kingdom, including Chikara, where they won the 2017 King of Trios tournament. Through a partnership between Progress and WWE, all three members of British Strong Style have also appeared for WWE since 2017, with Bate defeating Dunne in the finals of the first United Kingdom Championship Tournament to become the inaugural WWE United Kingdom Champion. Dunne won the title from Bate later that year. During Dunne's UK Title reign, Seven and Bate were for a short time NXT Tag Team Champions in June 2018, making all three members champions in WWE for a short period. The group takes its name from a style of professional wrestling that is a mixture of Japanese strong style and traditional British catch wrestling. The three have been a prominent part of the NXT UK roster since its creation, and were central figures of the NXT UK programme when it premiered in October 2018; They are nicknamed \\"the founding fathers of NXT UK\\" by WWE, due to their crucial part in the creation and growth of the brand. History Progress Wrestling (2016‚Äìpresent) Pete Dunne (left) and Trent Seven (right), who formed the group in July 2016 On 31 July 2016, the Dunne Brothers (Damian Dunne and Pete Dunne) were set to take on Moustache Mountain (Trent Seven and Tyler Bate) at Progress Wrestling's event in London, England. The match ended with Pete and Seven turning on their partners and walking off together, signaling the start of a new partnership, which they subsequently dubbed \\"British Strong Style\\". On 25 September, Dunne and Seven defeated the London Riots (James Davis and Rob Lynch) for the Progress Tag Team Championship. On 27 November, Dunne and Seven took part in a seven-man elimination match for the vacant Progress World Championship. The match came down to Dunne, Seven and Jimmy Havoc. After Havoc managed to eliminate Seven from the match, he was attacked by both Seven and Dunne, which brought out Tyler Bate, seemingly to exact revenge on Seven. Bate, however, turned on Havoc, helping Dunne become the new Progress World Champion and turning British Strong Style into a trio. Bate and Dunne were positioned as the spotlight wrestlers of the group, while Seven became its mouthpiece. After capturing the Progress World Championship, Dunne attempted to pass his half of the Progress Tag Team Championship to Bate, which led to Progress management stripping British Strong Style of the tag team title. They, however, allowed Bate and Seven to wrestle for the vacant title, leading to a match on 30 December, where the two defeated the London Riots and LDRS (Marty Scurll and Zack Sabre Jr.) to become the new champions. Tyler Bate after winning the WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament In January 2017, all three members of British Strong Style took part in a tournament held by WWE to crown the inaugural WWE United Kingdom Championship. The trio were not acknowledged by WWE, instead Bate and Seven were referred to by the Moustache Mountain name, with Dunne being positioned opposite the two as the main villain of the tournament. The tournament eventually came down to Bate and Dunne in the finals with Bate emerging victorious to become the first WWE United Kingdom Champion. After a four-month reign, Bate lost the title to Dunne at NXT TakeOver: Chicago. While WWE did not recognize British Strong Style as a stable, the WWE United Kingdom Championship was entered into storylines involving the group in Progress. The trio's participation in the tournament was also added to their villainous act in Progress with the members wearing NXT jackets, playing up the fact that they were under WWE contracts and promising they were going to leave Progress with the promotion's two championships. On 23 April, British Strong Style faced off against the Ringkampf stable of Axel Dieter Jr., Timothy Thatcher and Walter from the German Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw) promotion in a six-man tag team match, where both of their Progress titles were on the line. The match ended with Seven pinning Walter for the win, meaning that British Strong Style continued both of their title reigns. The following month, British Strong Style found themselves new rivals in the #CCK stable of Chris Brookes, Kid Lykos and Travis Banks, who debuted by interrupting their attack on Matt Riddle. This led to a match on 25 June, where Bate and Seven lost the Progress Tag Team Championship to Brookes and Lykos. On 9 July, British Strong Style and #CCK faced off in a six-man tag team match, where Brookes and Lykos agreed to put the Progress Tag Team Championship on the line with the added stipulation that if British Strong Style did not win the match, they could never again challenge for the title. British Strong Style ended up cheating their way to a victory, making Bate and Seven the new Progress Tag Team Champions. On 10 September, British Strong Style lost both of their Progress titles to members of #CCK with Bate and Seven losing the Tag Team Championship to Brookes and Lykos in a ladder match, while Dunne lost the World Championship to Travis Banks, ending the group's ten-month domination over Progress. Following the loss of their titles, British Strong Style turned face with Dunne apologising for some of his actions as champion. At Chapter 76, Seven defeated Doug Williams to win the Progress Atlas Championship. At Chapter 82, a rematch of the WWE United Kingdom Championship match from NXT TakeOver: Chicago between Dunne and Bate was the main event. Dunne defeated Bate in what ring announcer and co-owner Jim Smallman said was the duos farewell match, implying both seemingly were going full-time with NXT UK and WWE. Chikara (2017) On 1 September 2017, British Strong Style, billed as \\"House Strong Style\\", entered the 2017 King of Trios tournament, hosted by the American Chikara promotion in Wolverhampton, England. After defeating House Whitewolf (A-Kid, Adam Chase and Zayas) in their first round match, House Throwbacks (Dasher Hatfield, Mark Angelosetti and Simon Grimm) in the quarterfinals, and House Rot (Frightmare, Hallowicked and Kobald) via forfeit in the semifinals, House Strong Style advanced to the finals of the tournament, where, on 3 September, they defeated House Sendai Girls (Cassandra Miyagi, Dash Chisako and Meiko Satomura) to become the 2017 King of Trios. WWE (2018‚Äìpresent) After Roderick Strong turned on Pete Dunne at NXT TakeOver: New Orleans, Dunne teased a return of the stable in WWE on Instagram days later.=https://www.instagram.com/p/BhSyG6SBxSC/ In April during WrestleMania Axxess weekend, Bate and Seven lost an NXT Tag Team Championship match to Strong and Kyle O'Reilly. After the match, they were attacked by The Undisputed Era until Dunne made the save, thus reuniting for the first time in WWE. It was later announced that Dunne, Bate and Seven would take on The Undisputed Era on the first night of the second annual United Kingdom Championship Tournament in June 2018. British Strong Style won their match against The Undisputed Era on 18 June. The following night, Bate and Seven defeated O'Reilly and Strong to win the NXT Tag Team Championship for the first time, whilst Dunne retained his WWE United Kingdom Championship against tournament winner Zack Gibson, meaning that all members of British Strong Style were now champions in WWE. However, Bate and Seven lost the titles back to O'Reilly and Strong two days later. At NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn 4, Bate and Seven failed to regain their titles against The Undisputed Era while Dunne retained his title against Gibson once again.

From 1944 until his death in 1986, he was an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Bogot√°. Born in Ch√≠a, Cundinamarca, he entered the Major Seminary of Bogot√° as a child and was ordained a priest in 1911. He studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University, returning to Colombia in 1918. He served the Archdiocese of Bogot√° in varied capacities, including as a chaplain for clergy, and a school chaplain. In 1944, he was ordained a bishop and was appointed auxiliary bishop of Bogot√°. In 1950, he became the vicar general for the archdiocese. In the 1960s, he was made a titular archbishop and participated in the Second Vatican Council.  Early life and education  Emilio de Brigard Ortiz was born on 15 May 1888, in Ch√≠a, Cundinamarca, Colombia. He was of Spanish, French, and Polish descent. His great-great- grandfather was Antonio Nari√±o, the Colombian independence fighter and statesman. His parents, Lu√≠s de Brigard Sa√≠z and Mar√≠a Josefa Ortiz √Ålvarez, both came from prominent families, and were dignified but simple people. They instilled in Brigard humanitarian principles and a devout Catholic faith. He had three siblings: Julio, Arturo, and Mar√≠a Luisa. Brigard was admitted as a child to the Major Seminary of Bogot√° to study. He was ordained to the priesthood on 28 October 1911, at the age of 23, by the Archbishop of Bogot√°, Bernardo Herrera Restrepo. A few months later he was appointed chaplain of the San Antonio Asylum. Soon after, he was sent to Rome, Italy, and entered the Pontifical Pio Latino American College. He earned two advanced degrees from the Pontifical Gregorian University, graduating with his Doctor of Theology in 1915 and his Doctor of Canon Law in 1917.  Priesthood  After completing his education in Rome, he returned to Colombia in 1918 and began a long and varied career in service of the Archdiocese of Bogot√°. His work was often focused especially on care for children, the poor and the sick, and took up the cause of striving to gain better working conditions for laborers. He provided support to poorly-funded charity homes and provided charity to those in need. He was revered by the many he served and worked with, and was affectionately nicknamed \\"el Doctorcito\\" (diminutive of \\"the Doctor\\"). Officially, he served in various offices throughout his priesthood: as a chaplain to fellow priests, director of the \\"Home for Homeless Children,\\" and the chaplain of the Visitation Order monastery in Bogot√°. However, he was best known for serving as the chaplain of the Gimnasio Moderno, Gimnasio Nuevo, Gimnasio Femenino, and the Colegio de la Presentaci√≥n Centro schools in Bogot√°. He was also on the faculty of the Major Seminary of Bogot√°, his alma mater, and the Pontifical Xavierian University, among others. He also served as the chancellor of the archdiocese.  Auxiliary bishop  On 29 July 1944, Brigard was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Bogot√° and Titular Bishop of Coracesium by Pope Pius XII. His episcopal consecration took place on 3 September 1944 at the Primatial Cathedral of Bogot√°, with the Archbishop of Bogot√° Ismael Perdomo Borrero, as principal consecrator. The Bishop of Manizales, Luis Concha C√≥rdoba, and the Bishop of Antioqu√≠a, Luis Andrade Valderrama, served as co-consecrators. As auxiliary bishop, Brigard grew very close to Archbishop Perdomo. By the mid-1940s, the archbishop was in his 70s, and Brigard assisted him in leading the archdiocese. Brigard often represented the archdiocese at international events, such as the Second National Eucharistic Congress in Ecuador in 1949, and the Quinquennial visit ad limina in the Vatican City in 1950. When Archbishop Perdomo died on 3 June 1950, Brigard was appointed vicar capitular, in which capacity he administered the archdiocese until 8 September 1950, when Crisanto Luque S√°nchez was installed as archbishop. He then became the vicar general of the archdiocese. Throughout his episcopacy, Brigard ordained many priests and co-consecrated multiple bishops. He ordained Father Jos√© Miguel L√≥pez Hurtado in 1946, and ordained two priests who went on to become bishops: H√©ctor Luis Guti√©rrez Pab√≥n in 1962 and Fabio Suesc√∫n Mutis in 1966. The bishops he co-consecrated were: Vicente Roig y Villalba in 1945, Luis P√©rez Hern√°ndez in 1946, Camilo Pl√°cido Crous y Salichs in 1947, Baltasar √Ålvarez Restrepo in 1949, Antonio Torasso in 1952, Pedro Grau y Arola in 1953, and Pablo Correa Le√≥n in 1957. On 11 October 1961, Brigard celebrated his Golden Jubilee, the 50th anniversary of his ordination to the priesthood. The occasion was a very important social event in Bogot√°, with many prominent people attending the ceremonies. He was even honored by the pope, who elevated him to Titular Archbishop of Dysti two days before the anniversary. Beginning in 1962, he attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council. For his 90th birthday in 1978, he directed his many friends to, instead of giving him gifts, help him start a charitable foundation. Upon the death of Bishop Pierre Kamel Medawar on 27 April 1985, Brigard, at age 96, became the oldest living Catholic bishop, a title he held for less than a year before his death.  Death and legacy  Brigard died on March 6 1986 in Bogot√°. He is buried in the Primatial Cathedral of Bogot√°. His legacy lives on in the charitable foundation he started, which now bears his name, and the school Gimnasio Emilio de Brigard in Bogot√°, also named for him. The Fundaci√≥n Emilio de Brigard is based in the Gimnasio Moderno, where Brigard was chaplain.

Although it was outlawed during the communist period but was reinstated in 1998, this function was moved to 9 September, the national day of Bulgaria under communist rule.

The celebrations officially begin at 9am with the laying of flowers at the Monument to the Unknown Soldier by President of Bulgaria and members of government. The celebrations then continue as the parade commander (The commander is usually a Major General or Rear Admiral of the Armed Forces) arrives to take his place in the parade and receives the salutes of the Commandant, Georgi Rakovski Military Academy, reporting on the readiness of the formations at the Prince Alexander of Battenberg Square. At 10am, after a fanfare is sounded by the Guards Band of the National Guards Unit or/and the other bands within the Massed Bands of the Sofia Garrison, the President arrives and the parade commander marches towards him, informing that the parade is now ready for inspection. He then inspects the band and upon reaching the color guard of the National Guards Unit, he then pays compliments to the Flag of Bulgaria and to the massed military colours. He then inspects each of the participating parade contingents, stopping each time to greet each of the formed troops and as the inspection ends, he then approaches a makeshift saluting base at the National Art Gallery where after a fanfare has been sounded, he then makes his holiday address to the nation. As the address concludes the parade commander shouts While the entire parade responses with a long Oorah!, the Band then sounds the final measures of the Armed Forces Hymn Great are our Soldiers, and as the parade presents arms, Mila Rodino is then played with a 21-gun salute. The parade is then ordered to order arms and to stand at ease, and afterward the parade marches off the square in preparation for the march past as a Bulgarian Air Force helicopter commences the flypast carrying the national flag.http://www.cross.bg/armiya-bulgarskata-sili-1574037.html#.WxRHYMtOkez The drummers of the massed bands beat a cadence as the parade marches off the square, reforming at its southern end for the march past to begin later on led by the parade commander.

O. pseudobauri is one of two species in the ant genus Odontomachus to have been described from fossils found in Dominican amber and is one of a number of Odontomachus species found in the Greater Antilles. History and classification Odontomachus pseudobauri is known from a solitary fossil insect which, along with a coleopteran and a dipteran, is an inclusion in a transparent yellow chunk of Dominican amber purchased from an amber dealer in Basel, Switzerland. The amber was produced by the extinct Hymenaea protera, which formerly grew on Hispaniola, across northern South America, and up to southern Mexico. The specimen was collected from an undetermined amber mine in fossil-bearing rocks of the Cordillera Septentrional mountains of northern Dominican Republic. The amber dates from the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene, based on studying the associated fossil foraminifera, and may be as old as the Middle Eocene, based on the associated fossil coccoliths. This age range is due to the host rock being secondary deposits for the amber, and the Miocene as the age range is only the youngest that it might be. At the time of description, the holotype specimen, number \\"BMNHP-II32\\", was preserved in the Natural History Museum, London amber collections in London, England. The holotype fossil was first studied by entomologist Maria L. De Andrade of the University of Basle with her 1994 type description of the new species being published in the journal Stuttgarter Beitr√§ge zur Naturkunde. Serie B (Geologie und Pal√§ontologie). The specific epithet pseudobauri is derived from the Greek Latin word pseudo which means \\"false\\", and bauri from the modern species Odontomachus bauri. head of the O. pseudobauri holotype Based on the head structure, O. pseudobauri was suggested to be part of the O. haematodus species group, closely placed with the species O. bauri. The modern species is found in the Galapagos islands, tropical regions of South and Central America, and most of the West Indies except the Bahamas and Cuba. O. bauri is one of two modern species found on the island of Hispaniola, and based on the similarities to O. pseudobauri De Andrade suggested the latter species might have been ancestral to the modern species. When first described, O. pseudobauri was one of two Odontomachus species that had been described from fossils. It and Odontomachus spinifer were both described by De Andrade from Dominican amber in the same paper. A third species Odontomachus paleomyagra, the first compression fossil species, was described in 2014 from a worker found in Priabonian age lignite deposits of the Most Basin, Czech Republic. Description The O. pseudobauri worker is approximately in length, and has a shining exoskeleton of orange along the body, reddish head and mandibles, and brownish tones on the gaster. The smooth exoskeleton has tiny punctuation found across the rear and sides of the head, in the front areas of the antennae depressions, and over the gaster. In contrast the frons back across the rear areas of the antennae sockets are striated, with the striae becoming finer towards the rear of the depressions. The head has a rectangular outline, being 1/3 longer than wide, with the rear margin of the head wider than the maximum width of the pronotum. The mandibles are 3/4 as long as the head is wide and the chewing margin of the right mandible having 14 teeth, while there are 13 teeth in the left. The teeth of both margins increase in size towards the tip, while the apex of each has three teeth, a preapical, intercalary, and an apical tooth. The antennae have notably long scapes that extend past the rear margin of the head capsule. The first funicular segments of the antennae are 3/4 the length of the second segment. The pronotum and propodeum each have convex upper profiles, with approximately 25 concentric striae circling the pronotum. There is a large backward curving spine formed from the upper domed surface of the petiole, being a little narrower than the width of the petiole, and a smaller process is positioned on the forward underside area of the petiole. The worker is incomplete, missing the legs and antenna of the left side plus tip sections of the right legs. The third through end segments of the gaster are shrunken and missing.

Breitkopf und H√§rtel, 1888 The Three Equals for four trombones, WoO 30 (German: Drei Equale f√ºr vier Posaunen), are three short equals for trombones by Ludwig van Beethoven. They were commissioned in the autumn of 1812 by the Stadtkapellmeister of Linz, Franz Xaver Gl√∂ggl, for performance as tower music on All Souls' Day. They were first performed at the Old Cathedral, Linz on 2 November 1812. Two of the equals (nos. 1 & 3) were performed at Beethoven's funeral on 29 March 1827, both by a trombone quartet and also in vocal arrangements by Ignaz Seyfried. The arrangements of Nos. 1 and 3 by Seyfried are settings for men's voices of two verses from the 'Miserere'. These were sung at the funeral, alternating with the trombones. The remaining Equal, no. 2 (again arranged by Seyfried for male voice choir) was sung at the dedication of Beethoven's gravestone on the first anniversary of his death in March 1828. A clean manuscript copy, checked by Beethoven, was made of the original manuscript as part of a complete edition of his work ('Gesamtausgabe') by his Vienna publisher Tobias Haslinger. Although Seyfried's arrangements, published in 1827 and 1829, received public performances and were reprinted in 19th-century books about Beethoven, the original score for trombones wasn't published until 1888 as part of Breitkopf and H√§rtel's 'old' Beethoven Edition. All three equals were played at the state funerals of W. E. Gladstone and King Edward VII, where one writer remarked on their \\"tones of weird simplicity and exquisite pathos\\", and they have become part of the standard trombone repertory. Etymology The title of Beethoven's work, 'Drei Equale f√ºr vier Posaunen' is derived from the mediaeval Latin musical term ad equales or a voce (or a parte) equali. It designates two or more performers who sustain an equally difficult and important part ('equal voices') in either vocal or instrumental music, written for a particular range of voice parts. The term gained popularity during the 16th century among writers on music theory. Equal-voiced music is contrasted with pieces written 'a voce piena, or for a 'full range of voices'. The singular and plural forms in various languages are confusingly similar: *Mediaeval Latin: 'aequale' (plural 'tres aequali') *English: 'equal' (plural 'three equals') *German: 'Equal' (plural 'drei Equale') *Italian 'uguale' (plural 'tre uguali') Although the German word 'Posaune' is usually rendered as 'trombone' in English, it has also been used historically to refer to slide trumpets, deriving from Middle High German busƒ´ne, bus≈´ne, 'trumpet', from Old French buisine, busine, from Latin bucina, Italian buccina.\\"posaune\\". Merriam- Webster online Dictionary. Retrieved 25 September 2017. 'Posaune' can be generally applied to brass instruments, as in 'Posaunenchor' (brass band). Equal voices Johannes Ockeghem. Detail of 16th century painting. Equal- voiced music, written for a specific restricted range of voices was developed through the Middle Ages and continues to be composed. The names used during the 14th to 16th centuries to describe the various voice parts have become part of the modern vocabulary of music, both vocal and instrumental. Music written during the Middle Ages for a full range of voices, including treble, mid-range and bass parts, was described by music theoreticians who used the term 'a voce piena (\\"for full voice\\" or \\"full range\\"). As well as writing pieces a voce piena, composers used more restricted ranges throughout the sixteenth century, in all major genres, and for a number of reasons. Various terms were used by writers on music to describe this type of music under headings such as ad aequales, a voci pari, the \\"grammatically peculiar\\" a voce paribus, or the related term, a voci mutate. Pietro Aaron, with an example from Lucidario in musica ('Clarity in Music'), 1545 Such designations have often been translated and understood as \\"equal voices\\", but the wide variety of music answering to this description shows that these labels are often inadequate or even quite misleading. The multiplicity of Latin phrases used to describe the various voice parts of polyphonic medieval music became associated with modern voice types of treble, alto, tenor and bass. The terms mentioned above came into use during the development of plainchant, which was sung to a single melody or cantus held by the tenor (from Lat. tenere, 'to hold'.) As polyphonic music developed, a second voice above the cantus was termed the contratenor. The third part was the triplum (the 'third' voice up from the tenor part, the modern 'treble'). By the 15th century the highest musical line was named discantus (whence modern 'descant'), From dis- \\"asunder, apart\\" + cantus, \\"song\\": Originally \\"counterpoint\\". or superius, 'highest': and the contratenor developed into the medium-high contratenor altus (hence modern 'countertenor' and 'alto') and the lower contratenor bassus, or modern bass. These terms are applied to music for any mix or range of voices, both a voce piena and a voce equale. Aurelio Virgiliano (\\"Il Dolcimeo\\"): Nuova Intravolatura di Tromboni per Sonarli in Concerto (c. 1600). The first diagrammatic representation of trombone positions. For music written for e.g. men's voices, or trombones, a certain amount of re-distribution of the full-range harmony was necessary. For most of the early fifteenth-century, French chanson repertory for equal voices -- whether in two, three or four voices -- the discantus and tenor occupy ranges separated by about a fifth. The contratenor will then be in the same range as the tenor; and the triplum, if there is one, will be in the same range as the discantus. In the sixteenth century a self-conscious and systematic distinction began to be drawn between conventional, full-range musical textures and those with equal-voiced textures. Treatises by music theoreticians such as Pietro Aron, Nicola Vicentino, Gioseffo Zarlino, Thomas Morley, and not least the \\"monstrous\\" El melopeo y maestro by Pietro Cerone all contain remarks on writing for equal voices. Town pipers Stadtpfeifer band with trombones playing tower music. 19th century engraving. One of the most popular forms of outdoors public music-making in the 17th century in Germany and central Europe was tower music (German: Turmmusik), organised by the town piper (Stadtpfeifer) or tower master (Turmmeister). He and his band of musicians, also called Stadtpfeifer (the German plural is the same as the singular) played music for loud and penetrating wind or brass instruments (alta cappella) from church towers and town hall balconies.Hofer, Achim (1992). Blasmusikforschung (in German). Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1992, p. 101. These civic wind bands of town pipers had been a feature of larger German towns and cities since well before the beginning of the sixteenth century, similar to the employment of waits with their sackbuts and shawms in England. Martin Luther, one of the chief figures of the Reformation, encouraged music-making in the service of God, and by around 1570 town councils were employing musicians specifically to take part in church services to supplement the organ playing. Generations of the Bach family in Erfurt filled the office of Stadtpfeifer or Ratsmusiker (German: 'town council musician'). By 1600 Halle, Dresden, Berlin, Cologne, Stettin, Nordhausen and even Eisenach (J. S. Bach's birthplace) with only 6,000 inhabitants, all had 'Stadpfeifers', whose job it was to sound the hours ('Stundenblasen') in the days before striking clocks were common in towers and churches. They started around 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning to start the working day, sounded (German: blasen, lit. 'blew') the mid-morning break around 10 o'clock (Latin: decima hora) and the afternoon break around three or four o'clock in the afternoon. Finally, at around 9 or 10 o'clock, there was an Abendsegen, or evening blessing. Well known pieces by and for 'Stadtpfeifer' include Johann Schein's Banchetto musicale (1617) and Samuel Scheidt's Ludi Musici (1621). Neukirche (New Church), Leipzig in 1749 In Nuremberg and Leipzig and there was a particular penchant for antiphonal tower music: three verses of a hymn would be echoed back and forth three times between the bands stationed in the towers of the Neukirche, St. Thomas Church and St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig. The Leipzig Stadtpfeifer and tower master ('Turmmeister') of St. Nicholas Church from 1669 was Johann Pezel (or Petzold, etc.) whose Hora decima musicorum Lipsiensium ('Leipzig 10 o'clock music') was published the following year,Petzel, Johann (1670). Hora decima musicorum Lipsiensium. Leipzig: G. H. Frommann. IMSLP. Retrieved 26 September 2017. as well as F√ºnff-stimmigte blasende Music (1685) with five-part intradas and dance pieces for brass instruments. Another Leipzig Stadtpfeifer and virtuoso trumpet player Gottfried Reiche (1667-1734) described tower music in his preface to Vier und zwanzig Neue Quatricinia (1696) for cornett and three trombones, as \\"a sign of joy and peace\\", an embodiment of the spiritual- cultural life of the city \\"certainly whenever the whole country is in mourning, or in war, or when other misfortune is to be lamented.\\" Although the revival of music in churches was a particularly Lutheran initiative, Catholic areas like Vienna and Salzburg were just as keen to promote tower music. Among the most popular of tunes were the Heilig-Leider, paraphrases in German of the Sanctus from the Latin Mass, which came into fashion after the enlightened reforms of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I promoted the use of the vernacular in church services. According to one Stadtpfeifer named Hornbock, quoted in Johann Kuhnau's Quack-Salber: \\"We know from experience that when our city pipers in the festive season play a religious song with nothing but trombones from the tower, then we are greatly moved, and imagine that we hear the angels singing.\\". Fountain of a Stadtpfeifer in the atrium of the Neues Gewandhaus, Leipzig There was a distinct difference between the town or city bands who played cornetts and trombones, and the guilds ('Kameradschaften') of Imperial trumpeters and kettle-drummers, who played fanfares and other ceremonial duties for the emperor, kings, imperial princes, counts and other nobles. From around 1630 to the end of the 18th century these guilds jealously guarded their Imperial Privilege which allowed them exclusive use of trumpets and drums. Court cases were common in which Statdpfeifers and ordinary musicians had their instruments confiscated, and violence was not uncommon. Trumpeters were not allowed to mix with the town pipers, and the playing of trumpets in processions, dances or sounding an alarm was strictly forbidden. Johann Schein, the Leipzig Stadtpfeifer mentioned above, was prosecuted for using trumpets in a performance in the Thomaskirche, and admonished to use cornetts in future. The art of trombone-playing was also kept a trade secret by musicians' guilds who feared the loss of their livelihood, one reason why there are few early treatises on the subject. This lack was addressed by Daniel Speer, Stadpfeifer of Stuttgart during the 1660s, whose Grund-Richter (1687, 2nd expanded ed. 1697)Speer, Daniel (1687): Grund- richtiger/kurtz/leicht und noethiger Unterricht der Musicalischen Kunst (in German, blackletter font). Ulm: G. W. K√ºhnen. 2nd, much enlarged edition: Grund-richtiger... Unterricht... oder Vierfaches musicalisches Kleeblatt. Ulm: G. W. K√ºhnen (1697). was one of the first books written specifically for teachers and students of wind and brass instruments and kettle-drums. In Germany and Austria, brass music became generally associated with all sorts of events: at parish/community festivals, at burials in funeral processions, as spiritual company during confirmations; dedications at churches, harvest festivals etc.; playing in the New Year; at Epiphany (Dreik√∂nigsblasen), Christmas and Easter; children's bands playing for the sick, the aged, anniversaries, birthdays etc.; and serenades of all kinds. In Austria, trombones were typically played from church towers (German Turmblasen, lit 'tower blowing') or in cemeteries on All Souls' Day and the previous day (Hallowe'en in England). Their use is mentioned in a handbook explaining the multitude of church music regulations, Kirchenmusik-Ordnung (1828), by the Linz Stadtpfeifer Franz Gl√∂ggl. Gl√∂ggl commissioned the Three Equals from Beethoven in 1812. They were both pupils of Johann Albrechtsberger (d. 1807), who wrote one of the first trombone concertos. Tower music reached a peak in around 1750, and thereafter declined towards the end of the 18th century. From around 1800 official civic concerts began to replace those given by the nobility, and what has been termed \\"Saint Culture\\" ('St.-Kultur') suffered a split, leading on one side to the growth of professional symphony orchestras, and on the other to amateur Stadtkapellen conducted by professional or semi- professional town music directors. Composition and first performance Tobias Haslinger. Posthumous? lithograph by Joseph Kriehuber, 1842 Background Beethoven completed his seventh symphony in the summer of 1812, later published as Op. 92. He began work straight away on the eighth symphony, but continued to suffer the same headaches and high fever from the year before. His doctor again ordered Beethoven to rest in the Bohemian spa town of Teplitz, where he wrote the well-known letter to his \\"Immortal Beloved\\", whose identity is still unknown.Brandenburg, Sieghard, ed. (1996). Ludwig van Beethoven: Briefwechsel. Gesamtausgabe. Munich: Henle. He also finally met Johann von Goethe in Teplitz in July 1812, a somewhat equivocal meeting of minds. Beethoven, out walking in the company of Goethe, deliberately walked straight through the midst of some royalties with his hands in his pockets, and rebuked Goethe for being too deferential. Furthermore, Beethoven's youngest brother, (Nikolaus) Johann, had begun cohabiting during 1812 with Therese Obermayer, who already had a 5-year-old illegitimate daughter (Amalie Waldmann) from a previous relationship. Beethoven journeyed to Linz in late September 1812, primarily to convince Johann to end the relationship. Although he finished the eighth symphony after only four months in Linz in October, Johann remained obdurate, and Beethoven appealed instead to the bishop, to the civic authorities and to the police. Composition The Schmidtor-Turm, Linz, demolished in 1828. Pen and ink drawing with watercolour by Franz Laudacher. The Stadtpfeifer in Linz at the time was Franz Xaver Gl√∂ggl (also Gloeggl), whose full title was Stadtcapell- und Turmmeister (i.e. 'director of city music and tower master'). Gl√∂ggl had been appointed as Tonk√ºnstler und Musik- Commissioneur in 1789, living at Schmidtor 41. The following year he was Stadt- und Dommusikdirektor und Casininounternehmer ('director of city and cathedral music, and casino manager'). He may have been the world's first basset-horn teacher. Gl√∂ggl lived in the Schmidtor-Turm (Schmidt gate tower), provided for the Stadtpfeifer's use by the city: \\"A narrow staircase led from the street into the tower, where the tower master lived with his fellows.\\" Gl√∂ggl, as tower master, asked Beethoven for some trombone music to be played at the cathedral on All Souls' Day (2 November). According to an anonymous account (probably by Haslinger) printed in the introduction to Ignaz Seyfried's choral settings of the equals: :\\"L. van Beethoven [...] was asked by the local cathedral Kapellmeister, Mr Gl√∂ggl, to compose for him so-called Equale for four trombones for All Souls' Day (November 2nd), which he would then have his musicians play, as was usual, on this feast. Beethoven declared himself willing; he actually wrote three movements for this purpose, which are indeed short, but which, through the excellence of their design, attest to the master's hand; and the current publisher of these same [works] was later so fortunate to be able to enrich his collection, which through the many autographs of this great composer had acquired such estimable worth, with this original manuscript.\\" Beethoven may have written more than the three equals which have come down to us. 1838 Gl√∂ggl himself reported in a letter to Robert Schumann that ‚Äúhe [Beethoven] also wrote me some mourning pieces for trombones, of which I gave two to my friend Haslinger in Vienna, and one of them was played at his funeral. He wrote them in my room, and I kept one back for myself alone‚Äù According to the memoirs of Gl√∂ggl‚Äôs son Franz (though these were not written until 1872): ‚ÄúMy father asked Beethoven to write him an Equale for 6 trombones, since in his collection of old instruments he still owned a soprano trombone and a quart trombone [presumably a bass trombone in F], whereas usually only alto, tenor, and bass trombones were used. But Beethoven wanted to hear an Equale as played at funerals in Linz, so it came about that my father one afternoon summoned three trombonists, since Beethoven was eating with us at that time, and had them play an Equale of this sort; following which Beethoven sat down and wrote one for 6 trombones, which my father also had his trombonists play.‚Äù However, there is no evidence in the manuscript itself that he composed a fourth piece that was subsequently separated from it. Beethoven's manuscript was acquired by Tobias Haslinger, Beethoven's publisher, to add to his collection of Beethoven MSS. \\"The original MS of this curious production is in the possession of Mr. Haslinger, and prized as a relic of no common kind.\\" Not long after the solemn music was performed on Sunday 2 November, Johann van Beethoven and Therese Obermayer finally got married on 8 November 1812 and Beethoven returned to Vienna. Beethoven's funeral Sackbuts, an early form of trombone (Posaune) still use in the late 17th century Fifteen years later, as Beethoven was dying, Haslinger approached Ignaz von Seyfried with the manuscript on the morning of 26 March 1827 to discuss the possibility of forming a choral anthem out of these Equals to the words of the Miserere'. Beethoven died that afternoon, and the arrangement was finished that same night. Beethoven's funeral took place in the afternoon of 29 March 1827. The music was played in accordance with the regulations of the Catholic Church governing the use of music in church, including at funerals. These assorted rules were only gathered together the following year with the publication of Kirchenmusik-Ordnung (1828), ('Church music regulations') by Franz Xaver Gl√∂ggl, director of music in Linz and its cathedral (Stadt- und Domkapellmeister'): > \\"For first-class funerals, the arrival of the clergy will be announced by a > short mourning-music (Equale) played on trombones or other wind instruments. > This will mark the beginning of the funeral service. After this, the funeral > procession will set out, again suitably announced by mourning music played > on wind instruments. During the procession, this shall be played alternately > with a three- or four-voice choral Miserere until arrival at the entrance of > the church or graveyard, where the benediction of the Requiem aeternam is > sung. After the benediction and common prayer, a mourning motet is sung.\\" The Alser Kirche in 1724 This corresponds fairly closely to the order in which events took place at the funeral. During the funeral procession from Beethoven's house in the Schwarzspanierhaus to the , nos. 1 & 3 were played alternately, stanza by stanza, first by the four trombones and then sung by the choir. No. 2 was sung at Beethoven's grave on 26 March 1828, the first anniversary of his death, in another arrangement by Seyfried, setting words by the poet Franz Grillparzer. Publication history Tobias Haslinger, Beethoven's publisher, acquired the MS after they were first played. \\"The original MS of this curious production is in the possession of Mr. Haslinger, and prized as a relic of no common kind.\\" - Haslinger died in 1842. The MS was used in the preparation of the Haslinger-Rudolphine edition of 1817, in which they appeared as 'Short funeral pieces'. This Haslinger-Rudolphine edition was used in the preparation of the 1888 Breitkopf and H√§rtel edition of the 'Drei Equale f√ºr vier Posaunen, WoO 30. The score of the 'New Beethoven edition' was prepared exclusively from the original manuscript.Beethoven Werke, series VI, vol. 1, Kammermusik mit Blasinstrumenten, ed. by Egon Voss (Munich, 2008). Source: Voss, Egon: Henle Seyfried's arrangements for 4-part male chorus were published in Vienna by Haslinger, Nos. 1 & 3 in June 1827, and No. 2 in March 1829. See below. Seyfried's arrangements An alto trombone Ignaz Seyfried was a pupil of Mozart, and along with F. X. Gl√∂ggl and Beethoven, was a pupil of Mozart and Johann Albrechtsberger, whose complete works he edited after his death. A prolific composer of stage works and wind band arranger, he was the musical director (Kapellmeister) from 1797 of the Emanuel Schickaneder's Theater auf der Wieden where the first performance of Mozart's The Magic Flute took place, and its successor, Theater an der Wien from 1797 to 1826. Seyfried arranged two of Beethoven's three equals (nos. 1 & 3) for four-part male voice chorus, setting the words of verses 1 and 3 of Psalm 51, Miserere mei, Domine and Amplius. This involved some re-writing in order to give the words the right note-values. The music was transposed a tone lower to make it easier for the vocalists. His arrangements of WoO 30 Nos. 1 and 3 for male voices and piano, were published in June 1827, prefaced by a lengthy description of the funeral and the music. The choral version has many changes from the original trombone music, necessary to accommodate the text and range of the male voices. Seyfried's arrangement of WoO 30, No. 2, in a setting of words by Franz Grillparzer ('Du, dem nie im Leben Ruhstatt ward') was played at the dedication of the gravestone 29 March 1828. Printed as a supplement to Allgemeiner Musikalischer Anzeiger, No. 12 (21 March 1829). These choral arrangements were performed at a Beethoven memorial concert in Nuremberg on 26 March 1828, and appeared in the appendix of Beethoven's Thorough-bass studies, edited by Seyfried. As late as 1806 Nuremberg had a tradition of playing 'Statdpfeiler' antiphonal tower music, consisting of verses of a hymn echoed back and forth from church to church. Performance history Interior, Old Cathedral, Linz * All three Equals were first performed at Linz cathedral, 2 November 1812 * Nos. 1 & 3 were played at Beethoven's funeral on 29 March 1827, alternating with the choral arrangements by Ignaz Seyfried. * No. 2 was sung at the dedication of Beethoven's headstone on 26 March 1828, in the choral arrangement by Seyfried of Franz Grillparzer's poem. * The first performance in England was probably 70 years later, at W. E. Gladstone's funeral on 28 May 1898. by the London Trombone Quartet, at the suggestion of their alto player, George Case. The four trombone players‚Äîtwo altos, a tenor and a bass‚Äîwere stationed in the chantry of Henry V, above the high altar. According to one witness, \\"The hushed stillness which pervaded the noble fane was broken with indescribable tenderness as the sustained chord of D minor fell upon the ears of the great congregation in tones of weird simplicity and exquisite pathos.\\" Other music played during the service included arrangements for organ, trombones and timpani. * The Three Equals were also played at King Edward VII's funeral on May 20, 1910. On both occasions, \\"musicians agreed that there was nothing more impressive.\\" * They were performed at the Royal College of Music on 26 March 2001 (the 174th anniversary of Beethoven's death) at an RCM Brass Day by trombone students of Peter Bassano, and a choir of men's voices from RCM and other London conservatories.

The plant was proposed by Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Resources in January 2006. Construction was to begin on a 750-megawatt power unit in 2007, with completion by 2011. A second 750-megawatt unit was to be built within a few years after the first one, with a total cost of $3.8 billion. The companies also planned to ultimately add two 500-megawatt coal gasification plants to the project as soon as such technology became commercially viable. The total cost, upon full completion, would amount to $5 billion. The Ely Energy Center would have been the largest power plant in Nevada, and the state's largest energy project since the construction of Hoover Dam. The project faced opposition from environmental groups and senator Harry Reid, but was supported by Nevada governor Jim Gibbons, the Ely Shoshone Tribe, and some Ely city officials. The project was postponed for three and a half years in November 2007, due to delays from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in issuing an environmental impact statement (EIS). In February 2009, the project was delayed for approximately 10 years, until the technology to capture and store carbon dioxide pollution would become commercially feasible. The decision was made due to the possibility of the United States Congress enacting carbon emission tax laws, which would increase the project's cost and make it unfeasible. Rising construction costs were also a factor in delaying the project. History Announcement and overview On January 10, 2006, utility company Sierra Pacific Resources ‚Äì the parent company of Nevada Power Company ‚Äì announced plans to construct the Ely Energy Center, a $5 billion coal plant, in White Pine County's Steptoe Valley, north of the city of Ely. The project was to be built on land that was controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The project was part of the company's plan to lower its reliance on natural gas. The Ely Energy Center would be the largest power plant in the state, and the largest energy project in the state since the construction of Hoover Dam. The first power unit, capable of producing 750 megawatts, was to be operational by 2011. A 250-mile transmission line would accompany the energy center, to bring electricity from the plant to northern and southern Nevada. A second 750-megawatt plant would be completed within a few years after the first one. Both units, to be built at a total cost of $3 billion, were to utilize water-conserving technology and \\"supercritical\\" technology capable of burning coal efficiently at high temperatures. The company would also use clean coal technology as a way of minimizing environmental effects, while hybrid cooling would be used to reduce the amount of water required to keep the plants cool. Additionally, the company had plans to ultimately build two 500-megawatt coal gasification plants at the Ely Energy Center, as soon as such technology became commercially viable. The gasification plants would cost $2 billion to construct. The four plants would be capable of producing up to 2,500 megawatts, enough to provide electricity to 1.7 million households. Sierra Pacific Resources had previously declined to be a long-term customer of LS Power's White Pine Energy Station (also proposed for the Steptoe Valley) and Sithe Global's Toquop Energy Project (proposed near Mesquite, Nevada) as bond rating agencies perceive long-term power contracts to be a liability for utility companies, while company-owned plants are treated as assets. Sierra Pacific Resources planned to finance the project through stocks and bonds. Construction was expected to begin in 2007. The project would provide up to 2,000 construction jobs, and 300 permanent jobs upon completion. Sierra Pacific Resources stated that the project could make the company an additional $90 million in its first year. Officials of Utah's Hill Air Force Base had concerns that the coal plant could interfere with training flights in the Ely area. The project was presented to the White Pine County Commission on March 8, 2006. In May 2006, LS Power stated that consumers of electrical power in Nevada would save $600 million over a three- year period if Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power would purchase power from the White Pine Energy Station rather than building their own coal plant. Progress In September 2006, environmental groups testified that the companies should delay the Ely Energy Center for a year to conduct further research, as the current version of the plant would produce large amounts of carbon dioxide. In November 2006, the Public Utilities Commission gave the companies permission to spend $300 million to begin developing the transmission line and the $3.7 billion Ely Energy Center. Nevada Power Company was to pay 80 percent of the cost for the 1,500-megawatt energy center, while Sierra Pacific Resources would pay the remainder. Later that month, the companies applied for an air permit with the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. In March 2007, Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to help the city of Ely purchase the Nevada Northern Railway by providing a $375,000 loan. The company intended to use the railroad to transport coal to the energy center from Montana and from Wyoming's Powder River Basin. The company planned to spend $40 million of a $3.8 billion budget to rebuild 100 miles of the railway so it could connect with an existing Union Pacific rail line. LS Power, which also helped cover the cost to purchase the railway, also planned to use it for transporting coal to its White Pine Energy Station. By April 2007, analysts believed that only one coal plant would be built in White Pine County, with the Ely Energy Center being considered as more likely to proceed. In June 2007, a spokesman for the companies said they did not expect to receive opposition from the National Park Service, which had recently voiced opposition to the White Pine Energy Station for its possible environmental effects on the nearby Great Basin National Park. David Sims, project director of development for the Ely Energy Center, said the project would use superior air quality controls that would result in significantly lower sulfur dioxide emissions compared to the White Pine Energy Station. Environmental opposition and delay In July 2007, Harry Reid said he would fight the development of the two coal projects. Ely city officials expressed disappointment with Reid's position. Nevada governor Jim Gibbons, a supporter of the two coal plants, reaffirmed his support for the projects after Reid's comment. At the end of the month, seven groups submitted a petition to the Nevada Environmental Commission requesting that permits for the two coal plants be delayed until the commission enacted new limits on the amount of pollution allowed by such plants. A hearing on the matter was set for September 7, 2007. On November 28, 2007, Nevada Power announced that the project would be delayed for three and a half years because of regulatory review, while Sierra Pacific Resources planned to build a new natural gas- fired power plant near Las Vegas to keep up with demand in southern Nevada. Sierra Pacific Resources attributed the delay to the BLM, which had yet to issue an environmental impact statement (EIS). The BLM had expected to issue the EIS by summer 2008, but no longer expected to meet the deadline as it was also busy reviewing other projects. The company no longer expected to complete the first 750-megawatt unit by 2011, and did not set a new deadline for its completion. Reid praised the decision to delay construction of the project. In January 2008, the National Park Service stated that plans to build the energy center near Ely were \\"unacceptable\\" as it would harm the quality of the air and water at Great Basin National Park, as well as disrupt scenic views. That month, the Ely Shoshone Tribe announced support for both coal plants, considering them to be an economic necessity. In February 2008, the companies were expected to delay their application for the project for two years. In May 2008, the National Parks Conservation Association stated that the two coal plants would cause Great Basin National Park to suffer from acid rain pollution over time, ultimately harming the park's plants, fish, and other wildlife. The association also stated that the coal plants would affect air quality at the nearby Zion National Park in Utah. In August 2008, analysts for an environmental group, as well as the Public Utilities Commission staff and the attorney general's Bureau of Consumer Protection, recommended that Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Resources end development of the project, which had increased in cost from $3.8 billion to $5 billion. In September 2008, the attorney general and Nevadans for a Clean, Affordable, Reliable Energy, an environmental group, believed that Nevada Power should do a complete review of project and study other possible power alternatives. Nevada Power suggested waiting until 2010 to do a full study, as new laws regarding carbon dioxide pollution were expected to be enacted by then. In November 2008, Reid requested that Gibbons \\"join with me in putting Nevada quickly on a cleaner plat toward a renewable energy and efficiency driven economy and safer future.\\" In December 2008, the BLM issued a draft EIS for the project, while NV Energy suspected that a final decision from the BLM was another year away. The project was also still awaiting a final air permit from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. The first power unit was expected to become operational by 2015, followed by the second unit a year later. On February 3, 2009, NV Energy chief executive officer Michael Yackira said the project \\"is going to be very difficult to build.\\" On February 9, 2009, NV Energy announced that the project would be postponed for approximately 10 years, until the technology to capture and store carbon dioxide pollution would become commercially feasible. Yackira said the decision was due to rising construction costs and the possibility of the United States Congress enacting carbon emission tax laws, which would increase the project's cost and make it unfeasible. The company planned to continue building the One Nevada transmission line, which was expected to be operational by late 2012 but became operational in 2014. Reid said, \\"I applaud NV Energy's decision to speed up the development of an important transmission line and to postpone construction of its Ely Energy Center coal plant.\\" A July 2009 report from the Government Accountability Office confirmed that air quality and visibility at Great Basin National Park would be affected if either of the coal plants were built.

The plant was to be built in the county's Steptoe Valley, and would be located 34 miles north of the city of Ely. White Pine Energy Associates, LLC, a subsidiary of LS Power, announced the project in February 2004, with plans to begin construction in 2006, with the possibility of having it operational in 2010. The 1,590-megawatt project would consist of three units, each producing 530 megawatts. The project went through several delays and faced opposition from senator Harry Reid, as well as concerned environmental groups and the National Park Service, which believed that the plant would diminish air quality and affect the wildlife at the nearby Great Basin National Park. Supporters of the project included Nevada governor Jim Gibbons, the Ely Shoshone Tribe, and some Ely city officials. LS Power postponed the project indefinitely in March 2009, due to a declining economy and increasing uncertainty regarding regulations. History Announcement and overview The White Pine Energy Station was announced in February 2004, and was proposed by White Pine Energy Associates, LLC, a privately held subsidiary of LS Power. The company had previously developed nine natural-gas fired power plants. The new project would be a coal-fired power generation station, initially with the ability to produce 500 to 800 megawatts of capacity, with the potential to be expanded to 1,600 megawatts. Construction was scheduled to begin in 2006, with the possibility of the project being operational in 2010. Approximately 600 construction workers were expected to work on the project, and 100 workers would be employed at the station upon its completion. The project would be built at a cost of $600 million to $1 billion. The project was to be built in White Pine County, Nevada, north of the Ely area. Permits and approval for the project had not yet been obtained at the time of the announcement, as several sites north of Ely were still being considered. The Ely area had been chosen after a statewide search. The company liked Ely for its \\"progressive attitude,\\" as well as the availability of water for cooling the coal-powered plant. Upon initially being proposed, the project was to use up to of groundwater each year. The close proximity of transmission lines was also considered beneficial. Also taken into consideration were plans by the city of Ely to own and operate the Nevada Northern Railroad, as the plant would need a way to receive low-sulfur coal from Wyoming's Powder River Basin. LS Power ultimately helped the city of Ely to purchase the railroad line by providing a payment. Development director Lawrence Willick said White Pine County officials were enthusiastic about the power plant, saying, \\"Their economy has been so dependent on mining and the ups and downs of mining.\\" Willick noted the potential for the plant to be linked to Sierra Pacific Power Company's nearby transmission grid, allowing the plant to serve utilities and cooperatives in northern Nevada and Utah, although discussions had not yet been held with Sierra Pacific Power. Beginning in June 2004, project manager Eric W. Crawford spent five weeks meeting with numerous agencies, people, and politicians to progress the project. Site location and project permits Several factors were taken into consideration when choosing a suitable site for the plant. In July 2004, LS Power chose a site for the plant, located 21 miles north of McGill, Nevada, near Cherry Creek. The chosen site was located 34 miles north of Ely, in Steptoe Valley. A possible alternate site was also chosen for the project. Environmental impact statements (EIS) were underway in August 2004, after LS Power hired CH2M Hill as the main contractor, with EDAW as a subcontractor. The plant was estimated, by the Nevada State Commission on Economic Development, to generate over $100 million in tax revenue during construction and the first six years of its operation. In December 2004, Crawford said the power plant was on schedule as the company was preparing the EIS and focusing on obtaining right-of-ways from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The EIS was still being worked on in March 2005, while LS Power remained focused on the same site despite concerns about air quality being affected by the plant. In April 2005, Crawford said construction could cost up to $2 billion, depending on the size of the project. Construction was to begin in phases beginning in 2006, with the first phase possibly operational by 2010. Up to 1,200 construction workers would be employed on the project, which would ultimately employ between 100 and 130 plant workers. LS Power said it would begin construction only after wholesale customers signed long-term contracts to buy the power generated by the plant. In May 2005, the Ely City Council unanimously approved a resolution to support the project. The project's construction schedule remained on track as of June 2005, with permits, approvals, and project agreements expected to be obtained the following year. In August 2005, Crawford said state permit applications would be filed within several months, while work on the EIS was also ongoing. In December 2005, LS Power filed for an air permit with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, as it was required for the plant. The BLM was expected to release an EIS for the power plant in 2006. In January 2006, Crawford said the project would proceed despite the recent announcement of another coal plant, the Ely Energy Center, proposed by Sierra Pacific Resources. By May 2006, the White Pine Energy Station was expected to cost $3 billion. That month, LS Power stated that consumers of electrical power in Nevada would save $600 million over a three-year period if Nevada Power Company and its affiliate, Sierra Pacific Power, would purchase power from the White Pine Energy Station rather than building their own coal plant; the two companies rejected LS Power's proposal. In July 2006, LS Power expected to have permits for the plant by early 2007. In October 2006, LS Power announced a joint venture with energy producer Dynegy to combine the two companies. LS Power acquired 40 percent of Dynegy in early 2007. Environmental concerns In March 2007, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that LS Power should provide additional documentation about technology the company planned to use to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. The EPA also requested further analysis of the proposed plant's effect on visibility. By April 2007, analysts believed that only one coal plant would be built in the county, with the Ely Energy Center being considered as more likely to proceed. By May 2007, after receiving public comments on the project, LS Power had reduced the amount of water the proposed plant would use, from 25,000 acre-feet to 5,000 acre-feet. The reduction was made possible with the utilization of a hybrid cooling system. That month, in response to LS Power's application for an air quality permit, the National Park Service warned state environmental officials that the power plant would hamper views and kill trout at the nearby Great Basin National Park, located 60 miles southeast of the proposed plant. The National Park Service stated that LS Power should \\"assume a burden of protecting the resources in that park from the effects of its operations. That may mean 'going the extra mile' to employ advanced ... pollution control technology. If (the builder) is not willing to do so, it should consider an alternate location.\\" Crawford said, \\"This will be one of the cleanest coal plants in the country. The community is very supportive and actually desires a project like this in (the) region.\\" One of the National Park Service's primary concerns was LS Power's intention to use dry scrubbers at the plant to reduce sulfur dioxide pollution rather than wet scrubbers, which are preferred by the park service. Crawford said dry scrubbers were more advantageous. Another concern was that acid rain could destroy the park's limestone caves. Crawford hoped for construction to begin in 2008, after the regulatory process was expected to be completed. By that time, the plant was to consist of three units, each one producing 530 megawatts. In June 2007, the EPA wrote to the BLM that its draft EIS for the proposed project was lacking information that would help the EPA fully determine the impacts that the plant would have on the nearby area. In July 2007, senator Harry Reid said he would fight the development of the two coal projects. Ely city officials expressed disappointment with Reid's position. Nevada governor Jim Gibbons, a supporter of the two coal plants, reaffirmed his support for the projects after Reid's comment. At the end of the month, seven groups submitted a petition to the Nevada Environmental Commission requesting that permits for the two coal plants be delayed until the commission enacted new limits on the amount of pollution allowed by such plants. A hearing on the matter was set for September 7, 2007. In August 2007, the BLM was revising the project's EIS. At the time, Crawford said the project did not yet have a customer to purchase the power that would be generated by the 1,590-megawatt plant, which would provide enough power for nearly 1.2 million households. Crawford said the power would be sold to \\"investor-owned utilities, rural electric cooperatives and municipal electric utilities.\\" In September 2007, Dynegy was among five companies that received subpoenas from New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who stated that Dynegy failed to disclose risks involved in the development of coal-fired plants, including the White Pine Energy Station. By November 2007, construction costs for a scaled- down version of the plant had increased from an estimated $600 million to more than $1 billion, while the facility in its fully developed form could cost over $3 billion. In December 2007, LS Power was awaiting final approval of a draft air permit, which was delayed while the EPA reviewed concerns from an environmental group about the project threatening endangered species. EPA spokesman Dante Pistone said, \\"It involves a question about the impact (of additional carbon dioxide) on coral in the Gulf of Mexico.\\" In January 2008, the Ely Shoshone Tribe announced support for both coal plants, considering them to be an economic necessity. In February 2008, LS Power offered to compensate White Pine County for the amount of water it would use for the plant. In May 2008, the National Parks Conservation Association stated that the two coal plants would cause Great Basin National Park to suffer from acid rain pollution over time, ultimately harming the park's plants, fish, and other wildlife. The association also stated that the coal plants would affect air quality at the nearby Zion National Park in Utah. Further developments and postponement In August 2008, the BLM approved LS Power to build a transmission line that would connect electrical grids located in northern and southern Nevada. The transmission line would carry power from the White Pine Energy Station to Las Vegas, although LS Power planned to build the transmission line regardless of whether the coal plant got built. The BLM's final EIS, originally expected to be released in August 2008, was instead released that October. LS Power had yet to receive a final air permit, as the EPA was busy determining whether the plant complied with the Endangered Species Act. LS Power stated that construction of the first 720-megawatt phase of the project could begin in late 2009, as long as the company received the air permit and other necessary government approvals. As of November 2008, LS Power was awaiting a record of decision from the BLM and a final permit from the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. Later that month, Reid requested that Gibbons \\"join with me in putting Nevada quickly on a cleaner plat toward a renewable energy and efficiency driven economy and safer future.\\" On December 17, 2008, Dynegy denied that the White Pine Energy Station was in jeopardy after an earlier report stated that the company was reevaluating its development of new power plants. On December 22, 2008, the BLM approved the project to be built on the land. However, Mark Milburn, director of project development at LS Power, expected the decision to be appealed by environmental groups. Jon Summers, spokesman for Reid, said, \\"LS Power would be wiser and more helpful to its own investors to withdraw the proposal to build an enormous coal plant to import millions of tons of coal, pollute Nevada's skies and sell its power to other states, and instead focus on developing clean renewable power in our state as rapidly as possible.\\" On January 2, 2009, Dynegy and LS Power announced the end of their partnership in developing the White Pine Energy Station, as well as other new projects, including the proposed transmission line, known as the Southwest Intertie Project. LS Power planned to continue both projects, of which they would have full ownership and development rights. Milburn expected the project to receive a final air permit early in the year, as well as approval from the Public Utilities Commission by April 2009. On January 21, 2009, environmental groups filed an appeal of the BLM's approval of the project. On February 27, 2009, after the Ely Energy Center was indefinitely delayed, Milburn said the White Pine Energy Station was \\"moving full speed ahead\\", stating, \\"We're at the final steps.\\" On March 5, 2009, LS Power announced that it was indefinitely postponing construction on the White Pine Energy Station due to a declining economy and increasing uncertainty regarding regulations. Reaction from local residents to the postponement was mixed. A July 2009 report from the Government Accountability Office confirmed that air quality and visibility at Great Basin National Park would be affected if either of the coal plants were built.

NGC 4429 is tilted at an inclination of about 75¬∞ which means that the galaxy is tilted almost edge-on as seen from Earth. NGC 4429 was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on March 15, 1784. The galaxy is a member of the Virgo Cluster. Physical characteristics NGC 4429 has a small dust disk. There is also possibly a cold circumnuclear stellar disk. The cold circumnuclear stellar disk may have formed due to the infall of gas to center caused by a merger. However, since NGC 4429 does not show any signs of a recent gravitational disturbance, the merger must have happened a long time ago in the past. The dust disk and the cold circumnuclear stellar disk are embedded in a bright, hexagonal shaped bulge that resembles that of NGC 7020. The zone has bright arcs near its major axis but no \\"spots\\" or extensions as in NGC 7020. The zone is also somewhat ring-like. Interstellar medium NGC 4429 may lose a significant fraction of its gas due to ram pressure stripping. Metallicity The central regions of NGC 4429 are overabundant in the element magnesium.

Background  Lozikeyi was one of the favorite wives of Lobengula, and a senior queen, until 1893. She had no sons, only daughters, yet even so was influential in the attempt to have the son of a co-wife serve as her husband's successor. She was known for her outspokenness and for her defiance of the white settlers in what would later become Rhodesia. When her husband disappeared, she served for a time as de facto regent of the kingdom. Her place of retirement in the Bembezi River was an island which came to be known as the \\"Queen's Location\\". Lozikeyi died at Nkosikazi in Bubi District of influenza; her grave in the vicinity may still be visited, although its condition has been described as \\"neglected\\". Nearby is a school for which she lobbied and which she opened; it still serves students, although it has not been modernized. She was the subject of a biography, Lozikeyi Dlodlo Queen of the Ndebele: \\"A Very Dangerous and Intriguing Woman\\" by Marieke Faber Clarke and Pathisa Nyathi, published in 2013. Four photographs of her are in the collection of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, which featured her in an exhibit during the construction of a new wing.  Queen of the Ndebele  Queen Lozikeyi took over leadership of the Ndebele nation due to the constitutional precedent among the Nguni people. Queen Lozikeyi was not the first woman to lead in this capacity. But rather was a part of a collection of strong influential royal woman in Nguni society. Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli was queen mother of Swaziland from 1889 to her death in 1925.  Anglo-Matabele war of 1896  Lozikeyi Dlodlo played an important role in the Anglo-Matabele war of 1896. She was in charge of the King's army, thanks to her Dlodlo powers. Together with her twin brother, Muntuwani, she ensured that the army had enough ammunition ahead of the 1896 war by using the weaponry her husband did not use in the first Anglo-Matabele war of 1893.

Dilling (1869‚ÄìSeptember 14, 1951) was an American businessman and politician. He served as mayor of Seattle, Washington, from 1911 to 1912, and was also elected to the Washington State Legislature. Dilling was born on his parents' farm near Urbana, Illinois in 1869, leaving at the age of 14 to manage his own farm. He moved on to selling shoes at a retail store and arrived in Seattle in 1898 to handle the estate of his uncle, John H. Nagle. Dilling's real estate investments in Seattle prospered during the Klondike Gold Rush, making him among the wealthiest men in the city. Dilling entered politics in 1902, being elected to the Washington House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. He ran for mayor in 1910, as a Progressive reformer, but was defeated in the primary by Hiram C. Gill and William Hickman Moore. Gill went on to be elected mayor, but was recalled in a special election on February 7, 1911. Dilling was elected by a large margin, carried by the first female electorate in the city's history and the support of the Public Welfare League, and began sweeping reforms to undo many of Gill's controversial decisions. Dilling served out the rest of Gill's term and declined to run for re-election in March 1912, endorsing George F. Cotterill. After his tenure as mayor, Dilling moved to California to continue his real estate business. He returned to Seattle in 1928 as head of the Economic Investing Corporation. He died on September 14, 1951, at the age of 82, a year after suffering from a stroke.

Headquartered in San Diego, California, Classy was founded by CEO Scot Chisholm, Pat Walsh, and Marshall Peden in 2006, originally to host fundraising events that benefit charities. The firm transitioned to a software and services company in 2010. Its software as a service products launched in 2011 and focus on peer-to-peer fundraising, crowdfunding, events, supporter management and marketing automation. In September 2016, Classy closed $30 million in Series C funding from JMI Equity, Peter Thiel's Mithril Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and Bullpen Capital. History Founder Scot Chisholm graduated from college with a degree in mechanical and industrial engineering and moved to San Diego the next day, eventually going to work for Booz Allen Hamilton. Because his mother had had cancer when he was a child, and a number of his friends had similar family experiences, they organized a charity pub crawl to raise money for the American Cancer Society. The event raised $1,000. At one of the planning sessions for the pub crawl, the movie Anchorman was on in the background. The sign-off of Will Ferrell's character, Ron Burgundy, \\"You stay classy, San Diego\\", inspired the name for pub crawl and continued as the company name. Chisholm continued organizing events for a variety of organizations. He became frustrated with offline methods so in 2006 he cobbled together a system that was \\"a combination of Evite, PayPal, and Myspace.\\" This system could not meet performance requirements as the pace and size of events grew to include a 5,000 attendee music festival. Eventually Chisholm hired a local software developer through a Craigslist advertisement to build a customized application. In 2011 Chisholm relaunched Classy as a technology company, with original co-founders Pat Walsh and Marshall Peden, and newly added software developer Peter Nystrom and designer Joe Callahan. To continue its development, Classy worked with CONNECT incubator. In June 2015 Classy secured its Series B round of venture capital funding from Mithril Capital Management and Salesforce Ventures. At that time the company had 80 employees. The main purpose for the funding was to triple the size of its 15-person engineering team and expand its international functionality. In September 2016, Classy closed $30 million in Series C funding from JMI Equity, Mithril Capital, Salesforce Ventures, and Bullpen Capital. Classy has over 2,500 clients, including Shriners Hospitals for Children, City of Hope National Medical Center, Malala Fund, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Teach for America, Girls Who Code, Ushahidi, Oxfam, World Food Programme and National Geographic.

Biography  Rossi was born in Paterson, New Jersey, in 1959 to an Irish-American mother and an Italian-American father. She earned a bachelor's degree at Rutgers University and an M. A. degree in English from New York University. Her first book, a collection of short stories titled Athletes and Artists, won the New York University Prize for Fiction in 1987. In her 1992 collection, The Quick: A Novella and Stories, characters search for human connection to escape from the anonymity and solitude to which they seem doomed. In her novella, The Quick, she explores Italian-American themes, albeit evasively, according to one reviewer. Another writes, \\"For Agnes Rossi, the Italian American background is attenuated into accents of detail and character.\\" The protagonist in The Quick rises to the middle class by way of marriage, only to sink back into the economic instability of the working class she came from. Her first full-length novel, Split Skirt (1994), explores the relationship between two women who, despite differences in age, social class, and ethnicity, develop a friendship while incarcerated for three days in the Hackensack county jail. The Houseguest (1999), is set in 1934, and the protagonist is Irish. Rossi's work has been well received, particularly The Quick.

Representatives of 3,700 communes in the regions of the Northern Syria Federation were selected in the election, involving 12,421 candidates. The communal elections on 22 September were followed by elections of local councils in December and a federal parliamentary election of the People's Democratic Council, the region's highest governing body, in 2018. Some areas controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces were not included in the election, including the city of Manbij. Preparations Between 27 and 28 July 2017, a conference of the Syrian Democratic Council was held in the town of Rmelan. During the conference, the three-canton system in Rojava was changed to three federal regions, the Jazira, the Euphrates, and Afrin Regions. Dates of elections were also decided at the meeting, with 22 September being the date for communal elections, 3 November for municipal elections, and 19 January 2018 for the People's Assembly of Federal Regions and the People's Democratic Council, the highest governing body for the Federation of Northern Syria. Officials who organized the elections included Hediya Yousef and √élham Ehmed, two senior officials in the government of the de facto federal region. The election was mostly organized by the High Electoral Commission (; ; ) of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria which launched a promotional campaign in order to encourage voting in the election which included online promotional advertisement on Facebook and Twitter and the release of a promotional song in Kurdish, Arabic and Syriac. al-Ghamar Arabs (lit. \\"Arabs of the Flood\\"), who were settled by the Syrian regime in the Hasakah Governorate in the 1960s and '70s on appropriated (mostly Kurdish-owned) land, were allowed to participate in the communal elections and subsequent regional elections to establish local services for them, but weren't allowed to participate in the third round in January 2018 to elect the Syrian Democratic Council. The cities of Manbij and Raqqa were excluded, as they had local councils independent from the Northern Syria Federation, and Raqqa was only fully captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces after the first local elections. Both men and women ran in the elections, with the SDC planning to have women hold 50% of positions. Elections The elections officially began at 8 a.m. in the morning of 22 September, with hundreds of thousands of people participating. Security during the elections was maintained by the Asayish police, the Anti-Terror Forces (HAT) and the Society Protection Forces (HPC). In cities and towns with Assyrian populations, such as Qamishli, the Sutoro police also provided security. The elections in the Jazeera and Euphrates regions ended on 8 p.m. that day, while elections in the Afrin Region were extended by two hours. Results 728,450 votes representing 70% of eligible voters were reported to have been cast in total, with 437,142 from the Jazira Region, 135,611 from the Euphrates Region and 155,697 from the Afrin Region. Recognition, support, and opposition On 6 August 2017, Faisal Mekdad, the deputy foreign minister of Syria, dismissed the elections as a \\"joke\\". The Raqqa Civil Council and leaders of 5 tribes in and around Raqqa announced their support for the elections. On 20 September, the Kurdish National Council in Syria announced a boycott of the election and called it a \\"flagrant violation of the will of the Kurdish people\\".

Lopes' work displays a deep African sensibility with saturated colours and bold compositions of mask-like figures and geometric forms. She has been acknowledged for highlighting 'the social criticism and nationalistic fervour that influenced other Mozambican artists of her time'.  Personal life  Lopes was born in Maputo, Mozambique, on July 11, 1924 to an African mother, whose family was locally known, and a Portuguese father, who was a fieldworker. She was educated in Maputo, but after her second year of senior high school, she relocated to Lisbon to complete secondary school, where she studied painting and drawing with Lino Ant√≥nio and Celestino Alves and earned a degree in painting and sculpture. Around that time she met artists such as Marcelino Vespeira, Carlos Botelho, Albertina Mantua, Costa Pinheiro, J√∫lio Pomar and Nuno Sampayo. In 1943 Lopes returned to Mozambique, where she married poet Virgilio de Lemos, with whom she had twin sons. Lopes taught Artistic Drawing at General Machado Girls‚Äô Technical School for nine years. Although she was appreciated for her innovative teaching skills, these would occasionally enter in conflict with the school ruling system. In 1955 de Lemos published an anticolonial poem that resulted in a trial for desecration of the Portuguese flag. He subsequently joined the Mozambican Resistance (1954-61) and was arrested for subversion. The events reinforced Lopes' sympathy for the weak and oppressed fringes of the population ‚Äì a subject that would often recur in her art. In 1956, Lopes painted a mural called \\"Pavilh√£o da Evoca√ß√£o Hist√≤rica\\" which was inaugurated on the occasion of an official visit of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar to Maputo. Three years later, she was nominated president of the ‚ÄúN√πcleo de Arte‚Äù of Maputo and Vice President of ‚ÄúDirec√ß√£o‚Äù of ‚ÄúN√πcleo de Arte‚Äù. Due to her association with de Lemos, and with the outbreak of the Mozambican War of Independence in sight, Lopes was forced to leave Mozambique in 1961. After a short period of time in Lisbon, she moved to Rome. In 1964 she married Francesco Confaloni, a computer engineer and art lover. During those times she befriended some of the protagonsits of the Italian art scene, including Marino Marini, Renato Guttuso, Carlo Levi and Antonio Scordia. In 1965 Lopes obtained Italian citizenship. In 1979 Lopes paid a visit to Mozambique for the first time since her departure, and in 1982 her work was the subject of a large exhibition at the Museu Nacional de Arte Moderna in Maputo. In 1986 her first retrospective opened at Palazzo Venezia in Rome. In 1993 she was honoured as Commander for Merits by the President of the Republic of Portugal Mario Soares in Lisbon. In 1995 Lopes was the winner of the Gabriele D'Annunzio Prize in Rome. In 2002 she was honoured by Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi for her contributions to the art. Lopes' last public appearance was at the Venice Biennale in 2011. She died in Rome in 2012 at the age of 86. Mozambican President Armando Guebuza described Lopes as 'a humble, creative, combative and generous woman, who always demanded of herself that she surpass her previous achievements'.https://allafrica.com/stories/201202130118.html  Work  Lopes' work was influenced by multiple sources, including Mozambican art and Portuguese modernism. Between 1946 and 1956, she embraced the art of Western painters and South American graffiti artist. Following Picasso's death in 1970, Lopes paid tribute to him with an intense painting that symbolized political repression in Spain. Once Lopes became grew closer to antifascist circles, she started opposing the idea of \\"arte negra (black art) and found inspiration in the poetry of No√©mia de Sousa, incorporating social themes into her work. Lopes‚Äô work was also deeply influenced by the political events that affected her home country, in particular during the period that followed the independence and the civil war between FRELIMO and RENAMO.

These are The Cybercrimes Act, 2015, The Statistics Act, 2013, The Media Services Act, 2015, and The Access to Information Act, 2015. The Government of the Republic of Tanzania on one side claims that the four Acts were highly needed to facilitate access to information and control the media sector. Political analysts, activists and normal people on the other side criticized that the Acts will pessimistically affect the freedom of media and eventually the freedom of speech of citizens. The Acts give the Minister responsible for information the power to ban any media which may seems to report, publish, print or broadcast information contrary to the code of conducts or threaten peace in the state.  Brief history  The Media Services Act, 2016, was enacted in 2016 by the parliament of the united republic of Tanzania on 5 November 2016 and signed by President John Pombe Magufuli just two weeks later. The Act replaced the then restrictive Newspaper Act of 1976. The Expectation to many people was that, the Act would to become an updated media law that will obey to international conventions like United Nation Declaration of Human rights (UNDHR), East African Community Treaty and others on citizen liberty to access information but unexpectedly the Acts seems to many as depriving of civil constitutional rights like freedom of expression and freedom of getting information.  Reaction from press  The Media Council of Tanzania (MCT), Legal and Human Right Centre (LHRC), and Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC) on 11th of January 2017 filed a petition at the East African Court of Justice (EACJ) to challenge the newly passed Media Service Act, 2016.

A resident of Cleveland, Ohio, he purchased a small, struggling iron foundry which became the Cleveland Rolling Mill, one of the largest steel firms in the nation. He is known as the \\"father of the Cleveland steel trade\\". Early life Henry Chisholm was born in Lochgelly, Fife, Scotland, on April 22, 1822. His father, Stewart Chisholm, was a mining engineer. The Chisholms were a respectable, lower-middle-class family, and Henry was educated in the local public schools. His father died when he was ten years old, and he left school at the age of 12 to take a position as an apprentice carpenter. He was elevated to journeyman carpenter at the age of 17, and moved to Glasgow. When he was 20 years old, Chisholm emigrated to Montr√©al, Qu√©bec, Canada. He arrived in the city practically penniless. He worked in Montr√©al as a carpenter and construction contractor until 1849, constructing various buildings and other works up and down the St. Lawrence River. He established his own construction business, which in time became one of the largest in the city. Cleveland and the steel industry In 1850, Chisholm won a contract to build a breakwater for docks of the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad, which was in the process of completing its line into Cleveland and through the city to its rail yard on the shores of Lake Erie. The breakwater was completed in 1853, and Chisholm won several more contracts to build docks and piers in the city. By 1857, he had amassed a fortune worth $25,000 ($ in dollars). Cleveland Rolling Mill Drawing depicting the Cleveland Rolling Mill's Newburgh Works in 1885. What would, in time, become the Cleveland Rolling Mill was established by brothers and Welsh immigrants David and John Jones in 1856 to manufacture flat bottomed railway rails. The brothers ran out of money that same year, and shut down. Henry Chisholm and his brother, William, made a major investment in the Jones plant in 1857, and the company was renamed Chisholm, Jones and Co. The plant was expanded and began rerolling iron flanged railway rails into flat bottomed rails. In 1860, Amasa Stone and his brother, Andros, made a further investment in the company, which took the name Stone, Chisholm & Jones. The new capital enabled to firm to add a blast furnace and puddling plant, which opened in 1859. A second blast furnace was added in 1860. It was the first blast furnace to operate in the Cleveland region. On November 9, 1862, Stone, Chisholm & Jones reorganized and became the Cleveland Rolling Mill after receiving investments from Henry B. Payne, Jeptha Wade, and Stillman Witt. The company built a high, wide blast furnace in 1864 near the west end of what is now Saxe Avenue, and the following year erected its first Bessemer converter. This made the Cleveland Rolling Mill only the second Bessemer steel works in the United States. Cleveland Rolling Mill expanded its presence in 1868 with the construction of the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an open hearth Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous open hearth Bessemer furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. By the end of 1872, the combined Cleveland plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state. Cleveland Rolling Mill continued to expand in the last two decades of the century. In April 1880, the firm issued new stock to double its capitalization, purchased the \\"Canal Tract\\" from John D. Rockefeller, built the Central Furnaces on the site from 1881 to 1882 In 1882, the firm erected a Garrett rod mill, the first of its kind anywhere in the world. Other steel interests In 1864, Chisholm purchased the Lake Shore Rolling Mill, an iron and steel works which had been constructed on the shore of Lake Erie at Wason Street (now E. 38th Street). In 1871, Chisholm, Charles Crumb Jr., and five other investors, co-founded the King Iron Bridge Company. That same year, Chisholm founded the Union Rolling Mill of Chicago, and put his son, William, in charge of the plant. He also erected a rolling mill at Decatur, Illinois, which included two blast furnaces to furnish the Chicago plant with pig iron. Chisholm sold his interest in the Chicago firm in 1879. To supply his mills with iron ore, Chisholm also invested in iron mines in Michigan, which in time employed more than 300 workers. His companies eventually controlled much of the raw material the mills used. Steel legacy The Chisholm mausoleum at Lake View Cemetery. Unlike fellow Scottish American immigrant and steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, whose career and Chisholm's mirrored one another, Henry Chisholm focused on eliminating waste in iron and steel manufacturing rather than lowering the cost of production. Chisholm pioneered the reuse of scrap in steel production. His plants were the first to successfully roll rods and wire from steel, and in 1871 his plants produced the first steel screws. At the time of his death, Chisholm's companies employed more than 8,000 people and were generating about $25 million ($ in dollars) a year in revenue. During his life and since, Chisholm was called the \\"father of the Cleveland steel trade\\", and historians consider him the most prominent person in the history of the Cleveland iron and steel industry. Historian William E. Van Vugt has called Chisholm one of the most \\"outstanding\\" Scottish immigrants in American history both for his \\"historical significance\\" and for being one of the most successful at business. Other interests Henry Chisholm also invested heavily in bank and manufacturing stocks. He was elected a director at three of Cleveland's largest banks, including the Second National Bank. Chisholm was active in both religious and charitable affairs, and was a director of four charitable institutions in Cleveland. Personal life Chilsholm married Jean Allen of Dunfermline, Scotland, when he was about 17 years old.http://www.benarty.org.uk/source/Newspapers/LHIST1.pdf The couple had several children: William (born May 22, 1843);; Catharine Arnot (born June 30, 1845); Stewart H. (born December 21, 1846);; Wilson B. (born July 26, 1848); and Janet (born January 1, 1851). Two sons, Henry and Stewart, died in infancy; a daughter, Christina, died at the age of four. Chisholm was a lifelong Baptist. He was a member of the Second Baptist Church of Cleveland (later known as the Euclid Avenue Baptist Church). He and his friend and fellow church member, John D. Rockefeller, made the largest contributions when the church erected its new building in 1871. Death Henry Chisholm memorial at Lake View Cemetery. After a three week long unspecified illness, Henry Chisholm died at his home in Cleveland on May 9, 1881. Several hundred of the city's most important citizens attended the funeral, which was held at Chisholm's home. More than 4,000 employees of the Cleveland Rolling Mill filed past the home during the funeral. Chisholm was temporarily interred at Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland. A family mausoleum was constructed at Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery. The Chisholm family vault, which has 45 crypts, was (as of 2016) the largest mausoleum at the cemetery. Legacy Henry Chisholm erected a Tuscan Villa style mansion at 408 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland. The mansion ranked among the city's finest homes. His neighbors included Samuel Livingston Mather Sr., John D. Rockefeller, Amasa Stone, and Jeptha Wade. This and other magnificent homes helped Euclid Avenue earn the nicknames \\"Prosperity Row\\" and \\"Millionaires' Row\\" for the large number of extremely wealthy people who lived on the street. In 1880, Alva Bradley commissioned a wooden, screw-driven freighter, which was named the SS Henry Chisholm in Chisholm's honor. The ship was lost on October 20, 1898, after hitting a reef near Rock of Ages Light off Isle Royale in Lake Superior.; The wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In November 1881, workers at the Cleveland Rolling Mill and citizens of Cleveland's 18th Ward (in which the mill was located) began an effort to erect a statue in Chisholm's honor. A fundraising committee, led by local industrialists Jeptha Wade, John Walker, Joseph Perkins, William F. Thompson, and W.E. Way, raised more than $8,800 ($ in dollars) from 5,000 workers and citizens to build the monument. Cincinnati sculptor Charles Henry Niehaus was selected to design and sculpt the piece. Niehaus completed his work fairly swiftly, and exhibited a model in Cleveland in May 1882. The statue and bas- relief panels were cast by a Cincinnati foundry. The work was erected just inside the Euclid Avenue entrance of Lake View Cemetery on December 6, 1884. Senator Henry B. Payne and Ohio railroad executive John H. Devereux spoke at the unveiling. The memorial depicts a larger-than-life size statue of Henry Chisholm, his left hand resting on a small-scale model of a steel rolling mechanism. Bas-relief panels on three sides of the pedestal depict the conversion of iron ore into steel.

Geography Zinkyaik Mountain is located in Mon State in the northern part of the Tenasserim coast. It can be driven up to by truck due to road construction complete by the late Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw. The range is part of the of Eastern Arakan Yoma Mountains. It is at a distance of from Yangon and 45 kilometers north of Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State. The summit is above 3,000 ft. Near the foot of the mountain and located near the main road and rail line of Yangon-Dawei, near by Zinkyaik Village, is Zinkyaik Waterfall. The waterfall is frequented by locals, especially during the Fullmoon Day of Waso and rainy season. During dry season there is no water to supply the falls and it dries up. History Tissa and Thiha Before the Buddha attained enlightenment, there was a kingdom situated near Gisa Gi Yi, now known as Zinkyaik Mountain. The king of this region was Tissa Dama Gyaik and his queen was Thi Yi Kappar Dawi. They ruled the kingdom well, therefore it was calm, rich, and well-developed. The pair had two sons, who had been mentioned before in prophecy by wise men. The oldest son resembled his father in build and appearance. A Brahman had prophesied to King Tissa Dama Yaza that the prince would \\"have the traits of a moral principles, good character, politeness, cleverness, and great skill.\\" When the king heard this, he was pleased and gave the prince the name Tissa Kumaya, after himself. When the youngest son was born, he was a beautiful child. On both of the soles of his feet, he had markings that looked like lions. So, the king named him Thiha Kumaya. The two princes loved each other very much. They were raised with access to every kind of sensual pleasure and luxury. The king and queen guarded them against unpleasant dangers such as gnats, mosquitoes, houseflies, and insects. When they reached the ages of 23 and 21 years old, the eldest brother, Tissa Kumaya, who had strong moral principles, had mastered the skill in meditation of remorse. He realized that no being was free from suffering old age, pain, and death. He decided to retire to the forest and become a recluse. He met with his younger brother and discussed his plans for abdicating the throne. He asked his brother to assume the position of king instead of himself and to take care of their parents. The youngest brother decided instead to follow his brother into the forest and also live as a hermit. They agreed to wait for a suitable time to retire to the forest. When King Tissa Dama Yaza and Queen Thiyi Kappar Dawi reached old age, they decided to retire into meditation and give the throne to their eldest son and the royal title of Crown Prince to their youngest son. They gathered their lawmakers and made legal arrangements for their sons to assume their new positions. The princes denied their inheritances and asked permission to retreat to the jungle as hermits. They requested their parents' blessing many times. The king and queen did not think that their sons were suitable for forest life, since they had been raised in a palace. The two sons became depressed and would not eat. They became very thin. Finally, the king and queen relented and agreed to allow them to go into the forest. The princes were pleased and began to eat again. After a week, they went to the jungle in a grand procession followed by the king, queen, and public. A monastery was built where there was fresh water and natural food sources for them. This monastery was at the bottom of Zinkyaik Mountain. The two brothers stayed there and were then referred to as \\"Tissa Hermit\\" and \\"Thiha Hermit\\". Tissa and Thiha were not satisfied to stay together, since there was temptation to waste meditation time in conversing with each other. Therefore, Tissa decide to stay at Zinkyaik while Thiha decided to transfer to Mount Zwegabin, which could be seen from Zinkyaik Mountain. The Twins Local legend has it that two twin brothers, the children of a weizza from the Himalayas and a naga (dragon) princess were abandoned by their mother as eggs on the western base of Zinkyaik Mountain, where there was an island not far from the beach. Tissa, while walking and meditating, found the eggs and carried them back to his monastery at Zinkyaik Mountain. That night, Tissa saw a signal light from Mount Zwegabin from his brother, Thiha. Thiha met Tissa and Tissa gave him one of the eggs. Thiha took one egg to Mount Zwegabin, and one remained with Tissa. Tissa's egg hatched first on top of Zinkyaik Mountain, and later, Thiha's egg on Mount Zwegabin. Tissa named the baby under his care Thuriaya Kumaya because he was born at sunrise. The youngest brother died at the age of ten due to smallpox. Thiha came to raise Thuriaya Kumaya together with Tissa at Zinkyaik Mountain. The hermits became well-known and the area surrounding the mountain became crowded. Therefore, Tissa moved away from Zinkyaik to Kyaikhtiyo Mountain. Thuriaya Kumaya, who was taught meditation and the art of ruling from Tissa, eventually became the first king of Thaton. Buddha Hair Relic The Chakesadhatuvamsa, or chronicle of the six hair relics of the Buddha, was written in Myanmar. The text says that Buddha gave six hairs to disciples at Venuvana in Rajagrha. These were given to 6 bordering countries who had never seen the Buddha. The stories say that when the Buddha came to Mon State to give sermons, he gave six of his hairs to hermits from Kyaiktiyo, Zinkyaik (to Tissa, Mount Zwegabin (to Thiha), Kaylartha, Kuthaerayone and Melan. A pair of belu brothers from Kyaikhtisaung also received a hair. All the hermits and belus enshrined the hair in great stones. Tissa brought his hair to the top of Zinkyaik Mountain and built a pagoda there. Restoration The Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw restored nine Buddha hair relic pagodas during his lifetime, with Zinkyaik Pagoda being one of them. He built a compound around the pagoda and paved a road up to the top. It is now a popular spot for tourists and locals and had a resident abbot and monastery at the summit of the mountain.

For years, her work celebrated the emotive power of land and seascapes; however, it currently focuses on her anger and disapproval of the destruction of the environment, particularly by the oil and gas industry and the recent controversy surrounding fracking and the Keystone Pipeline. Early life and career Hodgson earned a B.A. in Liberal Studies at Oberlin College and an M.A. in Anthropology at New York University. Her background in anthropology was highly influential because it seemed to better address the relationship between art and culture than more traditional academic art curricula. Hodgson was fascinated by the impermanent materials used to create artifacts in pre- literate societies, and by how much care went into the creation of such ephemeral art objects. She is similarly unconcerned with the impermanence of many of her works; they are intended to weather and rot, and remind the viewer of the brevity of life.Blassingame,Tia. \\"Sticks and Shingles: In Conversation with Lucy Hodgson.\\" Espace, no. 70 (Winter 2004-05): 45. Early in her career, Hodgson taught printmaking and drawing at Franklin and Marshall College, and at the PrintMaking Workshop in New York City. She is affiliated with SOHO 20, has had fourteen solo exhibitions, and participated in numerous group exhibitions in New England and around the world. Her work is in a number of public and private collections, including the Neuberger Museum of Art, Biblioteque Nationale, and the New York University Print Collection, as well as AT&T;, Long Lines, Seiko, the Manufacturers Hanover Bank, Citicorp, Atlantic Richfield Co. and Chase Manhattan Bank. Work Media and materials Hodgson often uses found materials and reconstituted building materials (shingles, vinyl roofing, etc.), in addition to natural materials such a wooden stumps, twigs, and reeds. These are combined to address the \\"conversion of natural elements into ones that will destroy the world as we know it,\\" as in the juxtaposition of dying trees laden with industrial steel pipes and other human-made material. The tension between human intention and natural forces is a repeated motif in her body of work. In printmaking, Hodgson's works are limited to small editions, as she is opposed to mass production; her prints are not concerned with repetition. Site-specific works and assemblages Lucy Hodgson's work is heavily influenced by nature. For Standing Remains: Remains Standing (1992), a site-specific work in West Kingston, Rhode Island at the South County Center for the Arts, Hodgson utilized a thirteen-foot-high maple tree trunk that was damaged by a hurricane. The piece was abstract, and she worked organically while carving into it with only hand tools, following the tree's natural shape, as opposed to having a fixed form in her mind.Bousquet, Karen. \\"SK artist takes her biggest job yet at the SC Center for the Arts.\\" Narragansett Times, Standard- Times, East Greenwich Pendulum (Rhode Island), 3 June 1992: 6-C. The trunk was still rooted and alive, which provided extra challenges in the work, but was characteristic of her interest in organic forms and natural forces. She acknowledged that the trunk was impermanent, and certainly subject to change through the passage of time, but rejected the idea that art must be permanent. Hodgson has remarked that she is interested in trees \\"for their very anthropomorphic qualities.\\" Rhyming the River (2006), an assemblage exhibited in Summer Show at the Tamarack Gallery, is a wall-mounted, horizontal triptych of cutout, interlocking wooden designs. As described by one reviewer, \\"While the negative spaces of the cutouts, and their overlapping shadows, create three-dimensional rhythms, the short, straight wood-grain lines offer a two- dimensional counterpoint.\\"Awodey, Mark.

Shingle sculptures River's Revenge (2004) was part of the Sculpture In & By the River exhibition on the banks of the Housatonic River in Massachusetts on the grounds of the Norman Rockwell Museum.

Recent work Her recent work, Pipelines and Power Stations (2013), concerns the destruction of the natural environment, specifically caused by hydraulic fracturing, through a series of pump-like forms made of twisting welded pipes. Her more playful series, Last Stand (2017), consists of similar constructions but are made of boxes, cages, poured concrete, pipes, animal skulls, antlers, and other objects found in nature, which are intended to prompt the viewer to question \\"whether they are an industrial imitation of nature, or, through the evolution of the anthropocene, if this is what nature has become.\\" Awards and honors Hodgson has been awarded residencies in South Korea and Hungary, as well as funding from The Netherlands America Foundation (2003). In 2004, she was a fellow at the MacDowell Colony.

Equivalently, it is a convex polygon whose sides can be grouped into parallel pairs with equal lengths and opposite orientations. Examples A regular polygon is a zonogon if and only if it has an even number of sides. Thus, the square, regular hexagon, and regular octagon are all zonogons. The four-sided zonogons are the square, the rectangles, the rhombi, and the parallelograms. Tiling and equidissection The four-sided and six-sided zonogons are parallelogons, able to tile the plane by translated copies of themselves, and all convex parallelogons have this form. Every 2n-sided zonogon can be tiled by tbinom{n}{2} four-sided zonogons. In this tiling, there is one four-sided zonogon for each pair of slopes of sides in the 2n-sided zonogon. At least three of the zonogon's vertices must be vertices of only one of the four-sided zonogons in any such tiling. For instance, the regular octagon can be tiled by two squares and four 45¬∞ rhombi. In a generalization of Monsky's theorem, proved that no zonogon has an equidissection into an odd number of equal-area triangles. Other properties In an n-sided zonogon, at most 2n-3 pairs of vertices can be at unit distance from each other. There exist n-sided zonogons with 2n-O(sqrt{n}) unit-distance pairs. Related shapes Zonogons are the two- dimensional analogues of three-dimensional zonohedra and higher-dimensional zonotopes. As such, each zonogon can be generated as the Minkowski sum of a collection of line segments in the plane. If no two of the generating line segments are parallel, there will be one pair of parallel edges for each line segment. Every face of a zonohedron is a zonogon, and every zonogon is the face of at least one zonohedron, the prism over that zonogon. Additionally, every planar cross-section through the center of a centrally-symmetric polyhedron (such as a zonohedron) is a zonogon.

History  The foundations of the MPL were set by Smile Vojdanov in Pontiac, Michigan in 1929. In 1930, the first conference of the League was held in Toledo, Ohio, with Smile Vojdanov being elected as a chairman of the Central Committee and Georgi Pirinski Sr. as a secretary. The first regular congress of MPL was held in Gary, Indiana in 1931, and since then the Macedonian People's League has been formed. Immediately after its formation, the MPL was associated with various left-wing organizations in the United States and Europe, as well as with the Comintern. It established relations with the Comintern's leader Georgi Dimitrov. Dimitrov praised the work of Georgi Pirinski publicized in Daily Worker in August 1935. Pirinski appealed to Bulgarian Americans to heed the call for action by their countryman Dimitrov.George J. Prpic, John Carroll University, South South immigration in America, Twayne Publishers, 1971, G. K. Hall & Co., Boston, p. 236. In 1938, the MPL was renamed the Macedonian-American People's League, and its branch - the Macedonian-Canadian People's League was founded in the Canada. The League published in Bulgarian language the Weekly \\"People's Will\\" (Narodna Volja). The organization supported the creation of an independent Macedonia within a Balkan Federation. It was the first organization in the United States to support the idea that Macedonian Slavs constitute a separate nationality. MPL acted aggressively against the Macedonian Patriotic Organization, that it believed, was a Bulgarian agent. During 1940s MPL supported the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia within Communist Yugoslavia and favored the establishment of Communist regimes throughout Eastern Europe. Finally, because of its pro-Communist stance, the League was disbanded in 1948. The leaders of MPL either chose to leave the country or were deported. Some of them went back to Socialist Bulgaria and became highly placed officials there.

Fought during the War of the First Coalition, the campaign was primarily contested in the Western Mediterranean between the French Navy's Mediterranean Fleet, based at Toulon in Southern France, and the British Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet, supported by the Spanish Navy and the smaller navies of several Italian states. Major fighting was concentrated in the Ligurian Sea, and focused on British maintenance of and French resistance to a British close blockade of the French Mediterranean coast. Additional conflict spread along Mediterranean trade routes, contested by individual warships and small squadrons. The campaign began early in the War of the First Coalition, with an unsuccessful French attack on the neutral island of Sardinia in December 1792. In February 1793, France declared war on Great Britain, and Britain dispatched a fleet to the Mediterranean under Admiral Lord Hood to protect its trade routes in the region. The French Navy was in a state of disorder due to the ongoing social upheaval, and was initially unable to oppose the British and their allies. In August 1793, Hood and his Spanish and Italian allies were able to seize Toulon and the entire French fleet after a Royalist uprising in the town, followed by a four month siege by French Republican armies which included a young Napoleon Bonaparte. The allies were eventually driven out and the French fleet recaptured, although nearly half had been destroyed by the retreating British. While the French repaired, Hood devoted 1794 to capturing the island of Corsica, intending to use it as a forward base for the blockade of Toulon. This took longer than expected, and by 1795 Hood had retired, replaced by William Hotham. Hotham faced the repaired French fleet under Pierre Martin, who led several sorties from Toulon, leading to two inconclusive British victories at the battles of Genoa and the Hy√®res Islands. Martin then deployed smaller squadrons on destructive operations against British commerce. Due to military success in Italy and diplomatic negotiations with Spain, by 1796 Britain's allies had broken away; Spain declared war on Britain in September, leaving the British fleet exposed between two powerful enemies. Unwilling to risk destruction of their fleet in the Mediterranean, the Admiralty withdrew the British, now under the command of Sir John Jervis, to the Tagus, abandoning the Mediterranean. Background Modern map of the Western Mediterranean. Most of the campaign was fought in the Ligurian Sea. In the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1789, the newly formed French Republic had gone to war with the Austrian Empire and Prussia 1792,Ireland, p.39 and these enemies formed a coalition with other nations following the execution of the deposed French king Louis XVI on 21 January 1793.Chandler, p.xxiv The Kingdom of Great Britain joined the War of the First Coalition on 1 February 1793, and laid plans to open a new front in the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean of 1793 was dominated on its eastern shores by the Ottoman Empire, which controlled Greece and Anatolia, the Levant and, through client states, the important North African nations of Tunis, Algiers and Egypt. The Ottoman Empire was ostensibly neutral in the conflict, but it had importance as a major international trading partner, while its North African cities maintained large pirate fleets which preyed on ships of all nations.Mostert, p.279 In the Adriatic Sea the only opposition to the Ottomans came from the small navy of the Republic of Venice, while elsewhere the Italian peninsula was divided between a number of independent states, dominated in the north by the Austrian Empire, and controlled in the south by the Kingdom of Naples. On the northwestern coast there were the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Republic of Genoa and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Although Naples retained a small fleet, none of the Italian states were notable sea powers; their importance lay in their ports and commercial strength in the Western Mediterranean.Mostert, p.97 The regional powers in the west were France, which maintained a large fleet at the fortified port of Toulon, and the Kingdom of Spain.James, Vol.1, p.51 Within this region the islands of Corsica, French-held but with a rebellious population, and Spanish Minorca, were significant naval assets.Ireland, p.145 The Spanish maintained a large fleet, which in 1793 was in a high-state of readiness for operations, but had allowed organisation and infrastructure to deteriorate in the preceding years through a lack of investment.Ireland, p.119 The Spanish were reluctant allies of Britain, with resentment over the recent Nootka Crisis still widespread.Mostert, p.97 The French fleet was in a state of disorder at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars. Although successful in the American Revolutionary War of 1775‚Äì1783,Ireland, p.58 there had been little investment in the intervening decade; one of the causes of the Revolution were efforts to raise naval taxes by the French crown.Ireland, p.60 Toulon had been a political flashpoint during the Revolution, including a strike and riot by dockyard workers in November 1789.Ireland, p.66 Directives from the French National Convention targeting the professional officer class, mainly drawn from the aristocracy, led to widespread desertion by experienced officers while waves of revolutionary sentiment swept though the seamen of the fleet;Ireland, p.77 the Atlantic fleet at Brest experienced a series of mutinies between 1790 and 1792.Ireland, p.70 In Toulon the fleet and the town dissolved into factional infighting,Ireland, p.78 and in September 1792 the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet Joseph, Marquis de Flotte was dragged from his home and beaten to death by a revolutionary mob.Ireland, p.79 Britain maintained no colonies or naval bases in the Mediterranean at the start of the Revolutionary Wars, with the exception of Gibraltar, a fortified port on the southern coast of Spain which had been captured in 1704.Musteen, p.5 For most of the eighteenth century Minorca had also been under British control, but it was recaptured by the Spanish in the American Revolutionary War, leaving the British with few assets in the region.Ireland, p.118 Britain did however have significant commercial interests in the Mediterranean and had, for more than a century, routinely deployed fleets to the sea in times of war to protect British trade routes.Gregory, p.29 Unlike the French Navy, the Royal Navy was in a state of high readiness, having been effectively modernised since the American war,Mostert, p.52 and partially mobilised in the Spanish Armament of 1790 and the Russian Armament of 1791.Mostert, p.91 At the outbreak of war the British had only a small frigate squadron, led by the 50-gun HMS Romney under Rear-Admiral Samuel Goodall, stationed in the Mediterranean.Ireland, p.140 Deployment The first operation in the Mediterranean campaign was a large- scale French attack on the island of Sardinia, part of the neutral Kingdom of Sardinia, ruled from Piemont in Northwestern Italy. A French fleet and army under Vice-amiral Laurent Truguet, Flotte's replacement, attacked Cagliari in January 1793 but was driven off with heavy casualties.Smyth, p.57 A second attack on the island of La Maddalena was equally unsuccessful.McLynn, p.60 The French fleet retired to Toulon in disorder and Truguet was replaced by Trogoff de Kerlessy,Ireland, p.81 commanding 30 ships of the line and 21 frigates in various states of repair.James, Vol.1, p.66 With the French in confusion, the British government sought alliances with the other enemies of France, including an attempt to gain Spanish agreement to place a British commander in overall command of the allied fleets in the Mediterranean. The Spanish, suspicious that the British would seek to engineer a mutually destructive engagement between the French and Spanish fleets and dominate the region in the aftermath, refused.Ireland, p.144 As negotiations continued, the British assembled a fleet for operations in the Mediterranean, despite severe manpower shortages.Mostert, p.99 Command of this fleet was awarded to the veteran Vice- Admiral Lord Hood, and ships were sent out by division as they were ready; two sailed under Rear-Admiral John Gell on 1 April, five on 15 April under Rear- Admiral Philip Cosby and five more under Vice-Admiral William Hotham in early May. Hood followed with his final division on 12 May with seven ships of the line, led by his flagship HMS Victory.James, Vol.1, p.65Ireland, p.142 As Hood's fleet worked its way to the Straits of Gibraltar and then northeast to the Ligurian Sea, a Spanish squadron cruised off Southern France, although it was forced to withdraw in June with substantial numbers of sailors absent from duty due to sickness.Bradford, p.90 During this time the French remained at anchor in Toulon; 17 ships of the line were ready for sea, with another 13 refitting or under repair in the town's Arsenal.Clowes, p.204 In June, in response to the spreading Reign of Terror, the town council at Toulon had expelled the radical Jacobins from the city, declaring for the more moderate Girondists.Ireland, p.161 Trogoff had refused to align himself with either party, but his deputy Contre-amiral was an adherent of the revolutionary cause, backed by a substantial proportion of the sailors of the French fleet.Mostert, p.103 Siege of Toulon Destruction of the French fleet at Toulon Hood's fleet reached the waters off Toulon in mid-August, and within days emissaries from the rebellious Royalists in the South of France had reached his flagship offering an alliance. Hood agreed, but only if they could guarantee the surrender of Toulon and the fleet within.Mostert, p. 105 Following negotiations and a confrontation with rebellious sailors under Julien, Hood's fleet, supported by a Spanish force under Admiral Juan de L√°ngara, entered the city on 27 August and seized the entire French fleet.Clowes, p.206 In September French Republican armies approached Toulon from the east and west, while thousands of rebellious sailors remained in the port. To solve the latter problem, Hood disarmed four French ships of the line and sent them as cartels to Brest with the mutinous seamen,James, Vol.1, p.70 but the allied army defending Toulon was far from cohesive, comprising British, Spanish, Neapolitan and French Royalist troops.Gardiner, p. 86 By late September the French had captured some of the heights over the town, the assaults led in part by a young artillery officer named Napoleon Bonaparte.Ireland, p.197 In September Hood sent HMS Agamemnon, commanded by Captain Horatio Nelson, on a diplomatic mission to Palermo, where he liaised with the ambassador Sir William Hamilton and persuaded King Ferdinand of Naples to supply troops for the siege.Bennett, p.32 In October these Neapolitan units staged a counterattack,Rose, p.55 but by this time the relationship between Hood and L√°ngara had broken down completely, their flagships openly threatening one another in the anchorage.Mostert, p. 113 After Hood sent a squadron under John Gell to raid Genoa on 5 October and seize a French frigate anchored there,Rose, p. 48 the Genoese, sympathetic to the French, refused to allow any Austrian reinforcements to embark for Toulon from the port, weakening the position at Toulon.Gardiner, p. 99 A second French frigate was taken from La Spezia shortly afterward.James, Vol.1, p. 88 The following month the French Royalist ship of the line Scipion was lost with heavy loss of life at Leghorn in a possible arson attack.Grocott, p.4 Hood detached squadrons from the fleet at Toulon to engage other French forces in the Mediterranean, including one under Robert Linzee which attempted to persuade French garrisons on Corsica to surrender.James, Vol.1, p.85 When this failed, Linzee attacked San Fiorenzo in the north of the island in late September but was driven off by shore defences.Clowes, p.212 Linzee was joined by Agamemnon at Caligari in late October after the latter had fought a brief and inconclusive engagement with a French frigate squadron.Bennett, p.33 He sailed for Tunis, where a French merchant convoy had anchored. Linzee attempted to persuade Bey Hammuda ibn Ali to permit a British attack on the French,but was rebuffed.Bradford, p.99 Nelson urged that the attack go ahead anyway, but Linzee declined.Rose, p. 54 At Toulon a major Republican attack was driven back on 15 November, but an allied attack two weeks later failed.Rose, p. 62 General Dugommier launched a major assault on 14 December, which broke through the Neapolitan lines.McLynn, p.74 Three days later the Spanish held fortifications were lost and French artillery was in a position to bombard the allied fleet.Mostert, p. 115 Hood ordered his ships to withdraw to open water, and evacuate Toulon . As allied troops were removed from the docks, British and Spanish boat parties led by Captain Sir Sidney Smith entered the Arsenal with instructions to burn the disarmed French fleet.Ireland, p.275 Smith's crews destroyed eight ships of the line and two frigates.Clowes, p.552 Three ships of the line, six frigates and eight corvettes were removed by the allies and distributed to their navies, most going to the British.James, Vol.1, p.83 The remaining 15 ships of the line and several smaller ships were damaged to a greater or lesser degree but were subsequently salvaged and repaired by the French. Significant parts of the French dockyard stores remained intact,Ireland, p.280 although the timber stores were destroyed.Rodger, p.427 Accusations were made against the Spanish; one historian accused them of \\"jealousy and treachery\\" in preserving the French fleet to prevent British supremacy in the region.Clowes, p.212 The allied soldiers were successfully removed, as well as more than 7,000 Royalist refugees.Ireland, p.284 In the aftermath of the siege 6,000 Toulonaise inhabitants were massacred by the Republicans, and there was a plan, later abandoned, to demolish the town entirely as punishment for rebellion.James, Vol.1, p.81 Corsica NMM. At the start of 1794 Hood's fleet was anchored off the √éles d'Hy√®res. Hood gave orders for landings to be made on Corsica in preparation for seizing the island from the French and making use of the Bay of San Fiorenzo as a fleet anchorage;Ireland, p.145 Corsica had been in open rebellion against France since July 1793, under the command of Pasquale Paoli.Gregory, p.25 Landings were made at San Fiorenzo in early February, and despite effective resistance British land forces, working in conjunction with Corsican irregulars, had seized the town's main defences by 18 February, forcing the French garrison to abandon the two frigates in the bay and retreat across the Serra Mountains to Bastia.Gregory, p.54 Bastia was a much larger town with a significant garrison, and a bitter argument between Hood and army commander David Dundas delayed operations, until Dundas resigned.Gregory, p.56 The attack was led by Nelson and Colonel William Villettes, who staged landings near Bastia on 4 April.Bennett, p.35 An attack from the sea was driven off by heated shot, and the strength of the town's gun batteries resulted in a lengthy siege through May.James, Vol.1, p.190 Bastia surrendered on 22 May when food supplies ran out.Gardiner, p.110 Cheered by successive British victories, Paoli staged elections among the Corsican population on 1 June, and by 16 June had ratified a new constitution that confirmed the Anglo- Corsican Kingdom as a self-governing part of the British Empire.Gregory, p.68 The final operation was at Calvi, where two large forts blocked the approaches to the town. Substantial British reinforcements had arrived from Gibraltar, led by Charles Stuart, and he and Nelson landed an expeditionary force near Calvi on 17 June.Bennett, p.37 After British batteries were established on commanding positions, the French forts came under attack. Fort Mollinochesco was abandoned by 6 July, while Fort Mozello was stormed and captured on 18 July by forces under John Moore. British casualties were significant; Nelson lost an eye during the fighting,Bennett, p.40 and more than a thousand British soldiers were reported sick with dysentery and malaria.Gregory, p.59Bennett, p.39 Over several weeks the town was battered into surrender, taking heavy damage and capitulating following extended negotiations on 10 August.Gregory, p.63 The British sent their prisoners to Toulon on seven cartel ships, including . The French initially detained the vessels there, but later released them. Hood and his fleet were absent for the siege of Calvi as the French fleet, following extensive repairs, had finally emerged from Toulon under Contre-amiral Pierre Martin on 5 June.Troude, p.367 On 11 June the fleets were within sight of one another, the French retreating into Gourjean Bay.Clowes, p.246 Hood planned an attack, but the operation was deemed too dangerous. Hood withdrew, leaving a large squadron under Vice-Admiral William Hotham to blockade the bay, although Hotham's force was driven off by a storm and Martin succeeded in returning to Toulon in November.Troude, p.369 Elsewhere in the Mediterranean, the ship of the line disappeared on patrol off Villefranche-sur-Mer in April, presumed lost in an explosion with all hands.Grocott, p.7 On convoy protection in the Eastern Mediterranean, Romney encountered the in Mykonos harbour. Captain William Paget attacked the frigate and in the ensuing Battle of Mykonos forced the French captain to surrender.Clowes, p.486 In the early autumn the 70-year old Hood was recalled to Britain in Victory, Hotham taking command of the fleet and blockade.Mostert, p.158 In December there was a minor mutiny at San Fiorenzo on that Hotham resolved peacefully.James, Vol.1, p.194 In the last weeks of the year, Martin sent a frigate squadron on a raiding cruise in the Mediterranean under Commodore Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e, capturing 25 merchant vessels and 600 prisoners before returning on 7 January 1795.James, Vol.1, p.254 Battles in the Ligurian Sea Hotham had spent the winter patrolling from San Fiorenzo, where HMS Berwick was damaged in a gale.Clowes, p.267 While Captain Littlejohn was still effecting repairs, Hotham sailed the fleet to Leghorn, leaving Berwick behind with only jury masts. When Berwick followed, Littlejohn ran directly into Martin's fleet, which had sailed for an operation in the Gulf of Genoa.Troude, p.425 Littlejohn's crippled ship tried to run from the French but was overrun by Martin's frigates. At the ensuing Action of 7 March 1795 Littlejohn was decapitated by cannonfire and Berwick overwhelmed and captured.James, Vol.1, p.255 The following day Hotham learned that Martin was at sea and sailed in search. On 13 March he caught the French off Cape Noli and as Martin fled back towards Toulon, Hotham's ships attacked the French rearguard in a series of running engagements known as the Battle of Genoa.Gardiner, p.117 Two French ships were overhauled and defeated with heavy casualties,Clowes, p.271 but three days after the battle the damaged British ship HMS Illustrious was driven ashore in a storm and wrecked.Grocott, p.11 Martin withdrew to the √éles d'Hy√®res, sending his most damaged ships and Berwick back to Toulon for repairs,James, Vol.1, p.266 while Hotham anchored at San Fiorenzo to refit his own fleet.Clowes, p.273 Both fleets received reinforcements in the spring, a force under Contre-amiral Jean Fran√ßois Renaudin arriving at Toulon to find the fleet there in a state of mutiny, which was resolved by Repr√©sentant Joseph Niou. Hotham meanwhile was joined off Menorca by reinforcements under Rear-Admiral Robert Mann. British and French scouting frigate squadrons clashed at the Action of 24 June 1795,James, Vol.1, p.289 and that month Martin sailed once more. Hotham initially declined to pursue, but a detached squadron under Nelson was operating off Cap Corse.Clowes, p.274 Nelson led Martin to Hotham and the British fleet chased the French to the √éles d'Hy√®res, where in the Battle of the Hy√®res Islands the rearmost French ship was cut off and destroyed. Hotham discontinued the action with the French fleeing and vulnerable to the fury of his subordinates, and Martin was able to retire to Fr√©jus and then Toulon.Forester, p.78 Raiding cruises Antoine Maurin, 1836. Martin did not take the French fleet to sea again during the campaign. Instead, he detached raiding squadrons against British commerce. Firstly he sent Richery's expedition into the Atlantic,James, Vol.1, p.273 where it attacked and badly damaged a valuable British convoy from the Levant before sheltering in the Spanish port of C√°diz.Troude, p.437 Spain, under pressure from French victories in the War of the Pyrenees, had agreed a peace treaty with France on 19 August.Gardiner, p.89 A British force under Mann sent in pursuit of Richery instituted a blockade of the port.Clowes, p.277 A second squadron, Ganteaume's expedition, attacked British commerce in the Aegean Sea before returning to Toulon ahead of a pursuit squadron under Captain Thomas Troubridge.Troude, p.439 Hotham remained with his main fleet at San Fiorenzo and Leghorn, sending forces to harass French coastal convoys supporting the Italian campaign; a squadron under Nelson destroyed large French supply convoy at Alassio on 26 August,Bradford, p.120 and HMS Southampton fought an inconclusive engagement with a French convoy off Genoa on 29 September.Clowes, p.494 On 1 November 1795 Hotham was replaced by Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis, commanding 18 ships of the line, and towards the end of the year Martin was replaced by Vice- amiral Fran√ßois-Paul Brueys, commanding 15 ships of the line.James, Vol.1, p.308 Jervis was also concerned by the presence of seven Spanish ships of the line at Cartagena; the Spanish were still neutral, but their relationship with France was becoming closer. In early 1796 Jervis sent a number of detached squadrons to sea in the spring; Vice-Admiral William Waldegrave took a squadron to Tunis and violated Tunisian neutrality by seizing three small French ships in the harbour.Clowes, p.284 A squadron under Nelson was sent to the Italian coast,Forester, p.81 where the Montenotte Campaign, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, was inflicting severe defeats on the Austrian and Sardinian armies. On 10 April Nelson's force was positioned to provide artillery support for the Battle of Voltri, only to witness an Austrian failure to inflict serious damage on the retreating French.Mostert, p.179 On 25 April a supply convoy was destroyed at Finale Ligure, and on 31 April Napoleon's siege train was captured on board a coastal convoy at Oneglia, the loss of which later had a major impact on French efficiency at the Siege of Mantua.James, Vol.1, p.309 Jervis remained off Toulon; on 11 April HMS was accidentally burned off San Fiorenzo,Grocott, p.33 and in June Jervis sent Southampton on a successful attack on a French corvette off the √éles d'Hy√®res.Clowes, p.499 Nelson's operations were unable to check Bonaparte's advance inland, and on 15 May Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia signed a treaty ceding large tracts of land to France.Mostert, p.179 Naples sought peace soon afterwards. Napoleon's army advanced and defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Lodi, allowing French forces to spread across Northern Italy, threatening Leghorn.Mostert, p.182 On 27 June Jervis ordered a hasty evacuation of personnel, stores and shipping from the harbour, and HMS Inconstant came under heavy fire from advance French troops as it withdrew.James, Vol.1, p.310 Jervis responded by seizing the Tuscan island of Elba to prevent the French occupying the island in preparation for an attack on Corsica.Gardiner, p.119 In Corsica anti-British sentiment, initially provoked by British efforts to protect French-supporting Corsicans from reprisals,Gregory, p.72 had spread. Bitter infighting between supporters of Paoli and of the new president Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo drove Paoli into exile in October 1795,Gregory, p.107 and British efforts to impose taxation on the populace led to an armed uprising centred on Corte in early 1796.Gregory, p.114 British troops initially moved against the rebels, before Viceroy Sir Gilbert Elliot managed to negotiate a truce.Gregory, p.118 Evacuation of the Mediterranean On 12 September 1796 the Treaty of San Ildefonso was signed in Paris between France and Spain. Britain immediately embargoed Spanish merchant shipping from British ports in anticipation of a Spanish declaration of war, which came on 5 October.Mostert, p.184 Orders were sent by Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas to Jervis, now operating at the end of a lengthy and vulnerable supply route in a region in which every British ally had been eliminated, to evacuate Corsica and retire to Gibraltar.Rodger, p.436 In anticipation of the Spanish reversal, Jervis had recalled the squadron off C√°diz under Mann on 29 July, but Mann sailed without restocking his ships and Jervis was forced to send him back to Gibraltar to collect supplies. In the week before the declaration of war, L√°ngara sailed from C√°diz with the main Spanish fleet and encountered the returning squadron under Mann at sea; the British admiral abandoned two transports in a precipitate retreat to Gibraltar.Clowes, p.286 The Spanish sailed past Gibraltar into the Mediterranean and joined with the squadron at Cartagena, forming a fleet of 26 ships of the line.James, Vol.1, p.311 This fleet cruised in the Ligurian Sea, passing Cap Corse and sighting scouts from Jervis' fleet at San Fiorenzo. Jervis had only 14 ships of the line and might have been overwhelmed, but L√°ngara declined to attack, retiring to Toulon and uniting with Brueys.Clowes, p.287 Jervis was now hugely outnumbered by the 38 ships of the combined fleet, and anxiously awaited Mann's return, unaware that the junior admiral had decided to return to Britain on his own initiative and against orders.Mostert, p.185 By mid-October it was clear that Mann would not return and Jervis gave orders for a complete British withdrawal from the Mediterranean.Mostert, p.186 British frigates had already clashed with Spanish scouts; at the Action of 13 October 1796 HMS Terpsichore captured the Spanish frigate Mahonesa off Cartagena.Clowes, p.504 French forces landed in Corsica unopposed on 19 October, enthusiastically supported by Corsican rebels,Gregory, p.154 and Jervis detached Nelson to evacuate British personnel and sympathisers from Bastia.Bennett, p.93 Threatening to destroy the town if opposed, Nelson removed almost all British troops and stores by 21 October, when French troops appeared on the heights overlooking the town.James, Vol.1, p.312 The French, commanded by , then drove through Corsican defences to San Fiorenzo, already evacuated by the British, followed shortly afterwards by an advance on Ajaccio.Gregory, p.159 By 4 November the entire island was in French hands once more.Gregory, p.160 The same day Jervis readied his fleet, accompanied by a large convoy of transports and merchant ships, and sailed westwards, arriving at anchor in Rosia Bay at Gibraltar on 11 December.Mostert, p.186 The Spanish fleet set out in pursuit, accompanied by a French squadron under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, but was delayed at Cartagena and Villeneuve continued alone, passing Jervis and heading westwards into the Atlantic on 10 December during a storm.James, Vol.1, p.315 The same storm wrecked the British ship HMS Courageux on the Moroccan coast at Monte Hacho with the loss of 464 lives.Grocott, p.41 On 16 December Jervis took his fleet out of the Straits of Gibraltar to the mouth of the Tagus near Lisbon, where he could more easily procure supplies and receive reinforcements from Britain;Mostert, p.186 during this operation another ship, HMS Bombay Castle, was wrecked on a sandbar.Grocott, p.42 With Jervis at Gibraltar, the only remaining British force still in the Mediterranean was a small squadron under Nelson sent to retrieve the garrison on Elba. On 19 December Nelson, in the frigate HMS Minerve was attacked by the Spanish frigate Santa Sabina. The Spanish ship was defeated at the Action of 19 December 1796, but Nelson was forced to abandon the prize as Spanish reinforcements arrived.Bradford, p.128 Nelson reached Portoferraio shortly afterwards and took the remaining British troops and supplies on the island on board, sailing back to Gibraltar in convoy on 29 January 1797.James, Vol.1, p.318 The last operation of the campaign was by Minerve and HMS Romulus, which reconnoitered Toulon, Barcelona and Cartagena on passage back to Gibraltar, arriving on 10 February as the last British forces in the Mediterranean.Mostert, p.189 Aftermath Jervis was forced to the Tagus, from where he rebuilt his fleet with reinforcements from Britain. He focused operations on the C√°diz blockade, patrolling in search of the Spanish fleet. On 14 February 1797 he encountered a much larger Spanish force in fog off Cape St. Vincent and inflicted a severe defeat on the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, who retreated to C√°diz and did not re-emerge until the Croisi√®re de Bruix campaign in 1799.Clowes, p. 320 With British dominance at the Atlantic entrance to the Mediterranean established, Jervis awaited an opportunity to return to the Sea, while his blockading squadrons under Nelson harassed the Spanish, including a failed assault on C√°diz in June,Clowes, p. 321 and the disastrous Battle of Santa Cruz in July at which Nelson lost an arm.Bradford, p.157 It was not until the spring of 1798 and the attempt by a French army under Bonaparte to invade Egypt that a British fleet was able once more to enter the Mediterranean.Mostert, p. 257 In the Mediterranean campaign of 1798 a recovered Nelson tracked the French fleet and destroyed it at the Battle of the Nile,Clowes, p.353 reasserting British naval supremacy in the region and initiating the War of the Second Coalition.Rodger, p. 461 Blame for the failure of the British Mediterranean campaign of 1793‚Äì1796 has been apportioned by historians to Hotham, in his failure to inflict decisive defeats on the French Navy in 1795,Mostert, p.172 and Mann for deserting Jervis. Sir William Hamilton, British ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples, wrote that \\"I can, entre nous, perceive that my old friend Hotham is not quite awake enough for such a command as that of the King's fleet in the Mediterranean.\\"Bennett, p.44 Historian C. S. Forester criticised \\"the lack of energy and diligence on the part of [the] British Admiral\\", and Noel Mostert wrote that \\"Man's actions were beyond all reason. [John] Byng was shot for less.\\"Mostert, p.188 French victory in the campaign was due to the prowess of their armies on land, particularly Bonaparte's campaigns in Italy, and their diplomatic manoeuvering which left Britain isolated and outnumbered in the prosecution of the Toulon blockade.

During the engagement a lone British Royal Navy ship of the line, the 64-gun HMS Agamemnon, attacked the French Navy large frigate Melpom√®ne, part of a larger squadron, off the coast of Sardinia. Although Agamemnon chased Melpom√®ne some distance through the night and inflicted significant damage, the French frigate was able to escape following the arrival of the rest of its squadron under Commodore Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e. The French ships later anchored in Corsican harbours to land reinforcements for the French garrison on the island, where the population was in open revolt. The engagement is notable for being the first action of the war fought by Captain Horatio Nelson, then a junior captain in the Mediterranean Fleet. Nelson would go on to lead naval shore parties in the Invasion of Corsica the following year, during which the entire French squadron was captured or destroyed. He later achieved notable successes in a number of crucial battles during the war and is remembered as one of Britain's greatest military heroes. Background The new French Republic had declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain on 1 February 1793, following years of rising tension.Gardiner, p.14 The British immediately laid preparations for the deployment of a large fleet to the Mediterranean Sea, in order to enact a blockade on the French Mediterranean Fleet based at Toulon. The British Mediterranean fleet was dispatched in a series of divisions during the spring, led by Vice-Admiral Lord Hood, and numbered 21 ships of the line and associated frigates.James, p.65 Among this force was the 64-gun small ship of the line HMS Agamemnon, under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson.Bradford, p.90 Hood's fleet entered the Mediterranean at the end of June 1793, and on arriving off Toulon found the French naval base in open revolt against the Jacobin National Convention. Hood negotiated the surrender of the port and the French fleet, landing substantial troops and stores to defend it from French Republican counterattack.Ireland, p.178 Hood was aware of the vulnerability of his position and sought a nearby safe harbour, settling on the island of Corsica. Corsica had been invaded and annexed by the French in 1768 and its inhabitants were still rebellious; shortly before Hood's arrival an attempt by the French to arrest the island's leader Pasquale Paoli had led to an uprising which had driven the French garrison into a three fortified towns on the northern coast.Gregory, p.26 Hood sent a squadron under Commodore Robert Linzee to attempt to negotiate the surrender of these strategically important positions, with orders that if these overtures failed, Linzee was to attack the port of San Fiorenzo.James, p.85 The attack failed, and Linzee withdrew to Cagliari on the allied island of Sardinia. In early October, Agamemnon was sent to join Linzee for an operation against a French convoy anchored in the neutral port of Tunis; Nelson's crew was substantially under-strength at 345 sailors. A number of French ships had been absent from Toulon when the uprising occurred and remained active at sea while Hood's forces occupied the city. One such squadron was under the command of Commodore Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e, comprising 40-gun frigates Melpom√®ne, under Lieutenant Gay, and Minerve, under Zacharie Allemand, the 36-gun frigate Fortun√©e, under D√©sir√© Maistral, the 28-gun frigate Mignonne and the 18-gun brig Fl√®che, under Joseph Allemand. In October these ships had sailed to Tunis with a larger squadron before detaching on a mission to land reinforcements for the garrison on Corsica.Gregory, p.41 Battle In the early hours of 22 October, as Agamemnon sailed southwards down the Sardinian coast, sails were sighted leeward. At 02:00 the strange ships fired rocket signals and tacked eastwards away from the British ship.Bradford, p.97 Nelson closed with the squadron under the assumption that they may be from the allied navies of Naples or Sardinia. At 04:00 he attempted to hail the rearmost ship, a large frigate, but received no answer. Nelson then fired a single shot ahead of the ship, which pulled away to windward, confirming that it was an enemy vessel. All sails were raised on Agamemnon in pursuit, the rest of the French squadron trailing behind the French and British front-runners. The leading ship was the 40-gun frigate Melpom√®ne, and propelled by a fresh breeze she hoisted the French Tricolour at dawn and opened fire with stern-chaser guns, cannon situated in the stern to fire on a pursuer. Periodically the frigate gained enough distance to turn and fire a broadside at the British ship of the line, to which Nelson could only respond with a handful of his forward guns. The rest of the French squadron had been left behind in the night, but by 09:00 the battling ships had been becalmed and the pursuit squadron came into sight once more. Melpom√®ne, badly damaged by the British fire, issued flag signals to the new arrivals, and Nelson was unable to prevent the frigate rejoining its companions. Agamemnon had suffered severe damage to its rigging and sails from the French fire, and should the French have attempted a united attack, Nelson would have had difficulty manoeuvering in the battle. Nelson called together his officers and held a council of war to decide whether the action should be renewed in this state or whether Agamemnon should withdraw. This consultation was unusual in the Royal Navy, but provided Nelson with support from his crew should he be questioned on the point when he returned to the fleet.Forester, p.61 The council decided to pause and allow the crew to eat a meal before reengaging the French, but the conclusion was moot as Perr√©e also declined to renew the action.Bradford, p.98 By 12:00 repairs on Melpom√®ne were sufficient to allow the French to withdraw. Losses on Agamemnon were one sailor killed and six wounded, much lower than reported casualties of 24 killed and 50 wounded on Melpom√®ne.Bennett, p.33 Nelson himself later estimated that the combined French force mustered 170 guns and 1,600 sailors and could easily have overwhelmed his disabled ship had they counterattacked. He wrote that \\"Had they [the French frigates] been English, a 64 could never have got [away] from them.\\" The engagement has been cited as typifying naval tactics of the period; the Royal Navy, as the more aggressive service, preferred the weather gage, from which they could bear down on an enemy ship in a frontal attack. The French, trained in defensive tactics, took the leeward position that allowed them the opportunity of escape and the ability to target the attacker as they closed. The French tactics allowed them to direct their fire against the attackers masts, sails and rigging from long range, as with the Agamemnon, disabling the enemy and preventing them from pressing their attack. The British preferred point-blank range, around , and targeted the hull and crew of the enemy ship, seeking to batter it into surrender.Bennett, p.89 Aftermath Following the engagement, Nelson joined with Linzee on 24 October and completed the ultimately unsuccessful negotiations at Tunis.Bradford, p.99 Perr√©e was able to reach Corsica, landing reinforcements for the garrison and anchoring his frigates at San Fiorenzo and Calvi. The bolstered French forces on the island were able to conduct limited offenses around Bastia, recapturing the town of Farinole from the Corsican irregulars. Corsican irregular forces had held the bay at San Fiorenzo and might have opposed the French landings, but Linzee had recently disarmed the Corsican- manned Torra di Mortella, which was recaptured.James, p.107 In December 1793 the French army recaptured Toulon and Hood was forced to withdraw.Gardiner, p.95 An invasion of Corsica was planned in 1794, with successful sieges at San Fiorenzo in February, Bastia in April and Calvi in July‚ÄìAugust.Clowes, p.245 During these operations, during which Nelson led the naval detachments ashore and lost an eye to cannon-fire at Calvi,Bennett, p.40 all of Perr√©e's squadron, except Hazard, was captured or destroyed. Nelson remained with the Mediterranean Fleet for several years; he fought in Agamemnon at the Battle of Genoa in 1795, was instrumental in the defeat of the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797,Forester, p.91 and in 1798 led the British fleet which destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at the Battle of the Nile.Bennett, p.141 In 1800, during the Siege of Malta, he encountered Perr√©e again at the Battle of the Malta Convoy, in which Perr√©e was killed in action and his ship captured by Nelson.Forester, p.146 Nelson himself was killed in action five years later at the Battle of Trafalgar, in which a combined French and Spanish fleet was destroyed.Bradford, p.345 He is remembered as one of Britain's greatest and most successful naval commanders.Bennett, p.291 Citations and references  Notes Citations References   * Naval battles involving France Naval battles involving Great Britain Conflicts in 1793 Naval battles of the French Revolutionary Wars ","title":"Action of 22 October 1793"},{"id":"55312142","text":"The Lolas' Beautiful Show () is a Philippine television comedy talk show broadcast by GMA Network.

As Head of the Nineveh Antiquities section in the Iraq State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, she has been responsible for the monitoring, rescue, and documentation of Ancient Near Eastern art and architecture following its destruction by ISIS. She is known for her discovery of one of Esarhaddon's palaces in Nineveh. Early life Layla Salih was born in Mosul in 1975 in the family of an ex-soldier. She was the fourth of seven sons and six daughters. She obtained her undergraduate degree in archaeology from the University of Baghdad. During the Iraq War, she completed a master's degree in archaeology. Later, she obtained a PhD from the University of Mosul. Salih's oldest brother, Nadhim, was killed during the First Battle of al-Faw in 1986. She lost a brother to an al-Qaeda bomb in 2007. In 2011, her sister Khawlah, who was working for the Iraqi government, was shot by militants. When the militant group ISIS occupied Mosul, Salih and her family first evacuated to Kirkuk. She lived in Baghdad for a period, before moving to Erbil. There she joined the office of the provincial governor of Nineveh. Career Mosul Following her graduation, Salih obtained a role as curator at the Mosul Museum. Just before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, anticipating the destruction of the museum's artifacts, she was tasked with transferring the collections to Baghdad. Salih was with Mosul Museum till 2009. After ISIS occupied the region in 2014, they emptied much of the museum and began a campaign of destruction of the area's pre-Islamic heritage. Two Assyrian lamassu and a winged lion, each nearly 2 metres tall, which had been the centrepieces of the museum, were destroyed. Ninety-four precious objects of Assyrian history as well as Hellenic works were plundered or wrecked. Salih and others begged ISIS to destroy the tombs and to leave the buildings intact, but the militants did not spare either the tombs or the buildings. Nimrud ISIS was driven out of Nineveh province in November 2016. Salih and a colleague, Faisal Jaber, investigated and reported on the destruction of Christian sites in the province. Next, Salih was tasked with examining the scale of the damage wrought on the monuments in Nimrud. At the time, she was the only antiquities official able to survey the scene, as nearly 50 other Iraqi archaeologists remained trapped in ISIS-controlled Mosul. Salih estimated that about 60 percent of the site was irredeemable, but she also felt that because a lot of the wreckage remained on location, much could be restored. A joint committee of Unesco and the governor of Nineveh agreed to reinstate funding for a rebuilding of the site. But the monuments and ruins remained unprotected, and open to looters. Salih asked the Iraqi militias to preserve as much of Nimrud as possible. Nineveh In 2017, Salih began to document the destruction to the monuments in Nineveh. Beneath the Nabi Yunus shrine, her team found that ISIS had dug tunnels and broken into a hitherto unknown palace in search of antiquities to plunder and sell. Worried about the structural integrity of the walls, ISIS had left the area untouched. Salih discovered a cuneiform inscription of Esarhaddon, dating back to about 672 BC. The king's name does not appear in the inscription, but phrases separately identified with him do, and it describes his reconstruction of Babylon, previously destroyed by Sennacherib, his father. The team also found statues of an Assyrian goddess sprinkling the \\"water of life\\" on her devotees. In contrast to previously known reliefs in which figures were depicted in profile, these were in frontal pose. Salih also discovered two alabaster lamassu. Salih reported that more than a hundred items of pottery, which were likely taken from the Nabi Yunus tunnels by ISIS, were recovered from a house in Mosul.

It is his last theological text before he was executed on 9 April 1945. It became a frequently sung hymn, with different melodies, which has appeared in current German hymnals. The incipit is Von guten M√§chten treu und still umgeben (By loving forces silently surrounded). The seventh and last stanza, Von guten M√§chten wunderbar geborgen (By loving forces wonderfully sheltered), has been used as a refrain in a popular version.  History  Bonhoeffer was arrested as a prominent opponent of the Nazi regime on 5 April 1943, and was kept at different prisons. His writings in prison showed a new dimension in his theology. From mid-1944, around the time of the 20 July plot, he began to also write poems. He was transferred to the Reich Main Security Office in Berlin on 8 October 1944. From there he wrote on 19 December 1944 to his betrothed Maria von Wedemeyer, adding the poem with the comments \\"ein paar Verse, die mir in den letzten Abenden einfielen\\" (a few verses that occurred to me the last evenings) and \\"als ein Weihnachtsgru√ü f√ºr Dich und die Eltern und Geschwister\\" (as a Christmas greeting for you and the parents and siblings). The poem refers both to his own situation and that of his family: he had to face possible execution, his brother Klaus and his brothers-in-law Hans von Dohnanyi and R√ºdiger Schleicher were in prison, his brother Walter had died as a soldier, and his twin sister had left the country with her Jewish husband . Typed version of 1945, which was believed to be authentic until 1988 Bonhoeffer's letters to Maria were not intended to be published. She made a copy for relatives for Christmas 1944.Abschrift Maria von Wedemeyers A derived typed copy appeared first in Geneva in 1945 in the ecumenical Gedenkschrift (memorial writing) Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Das Zeugnis eines Boten.√ñkumenische Kommission f√ºr die Pastoration der Kriegsgefangenen (ed.): Das Zeugnis eines Boten: Zum Ged√§chtnis von Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Genf 1945, p. 47. This version was believed to be authentic when included it in his collection of Bonhoeffer's letters, Widerstand und Ergebung ('Resistance and Resignation'), in 1951. It differs from the original in four instances and served as the basis for hymn versions. When the original letter was published in 1988, it was printed then in the critical edition, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Werke, vol. 8 (1998).Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Widerstand und Ergebung (= Dietrich Bonhoeffer Werke, 8). Chr. Kaiser, M√ºnchen 1998, , p. 607ff. The Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch of 1993 used the original text, followed by other hymnals and song books.  Form and text  The poem is in seven even stanzas, different from Bonhoeffer's other poetic texts from the period, such as \\"Gl√ºck und Ungl√ºck\\", \\"Wer bin ich?\\", \\"Der Freund\\", \\"Vergangenheit\\". The seven stanzas are numbered as in a hymnal, possibly to clarify their order. The text of the Evangelisches Gesangbuch follows Bonhoeffer's original:  Melodies  The meter of the poem does not match any hymn tune of the time. The personal beginning is not well suited to singing as a congregation. The earliest setting to music by Otto Abel in 1959 used originally only the final stanza. His melody was used for the Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 65, in the section Zur Jahreswende, and in the as MG 272 in the section Durch das Jahr ‚Äì Jahreswende und Epiphanias. The text has been set to music more than 70 times, including a 1971 version by Joseph Gelineau,Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden, Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden (Hrsg.): Gemeindelieder.

Ancestry and family Majority of the historians, including M√≥r Wertner, Zolt√°n Kord√© and Attila Zsoldos considered, Bogomer (or Bohum√≠r) was born into the gens (clan) Lud√°ny, which owned landed properties primarily in Nyitra County. According to the Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum written by chronicler Simon of K√©za, the Lud√°ny kindred originated from Bohemia, which claim is strengthened by the frequency of Slavic-origin personal names within the kinship. Bogomer was one of the two known sons of Szoboszl√≥ I (or Sob√©slav), who served as isp√°n of Sempte isp√°nate (today ≈†intava, Slovakia) in the territory of Nyitra County in 1221. His brother was Wytk I, ancestor of the Lud√°nyi family. Bogomer had at least two sons from his unidentified marriage: Peter I (fl. 1277‚Äì97) and Szoboszl√≥ II (fl. 1283‚Äì95). Based on a brief comment by a charter issued in 1296, regarding Peter (who became a familiaris of the powerful local lord Matthew Cs√°k by then), it is presumable that Paska, Bishop of Nyitra was also Bogomer's son. Through Szoboszl√≥ II, Bogomer was the forefather of the Em≈ëkei and Szobonya noble families.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Lud√°ny 1., Szobonya branch) B√©la's partisan Bogomer belonged to Duke B√©la's confidants, who strongly opposed his father King Andrew II \\"useless and superfluous perpetual grants\\" which caused the derogation of the royal power in the realm. B√©la was made Duke of Slavonia in 1220, and Bogomer was member of his ducal court, along with other young courtiers, for instance Denis T√ºrje, Paul Geregye and Pousa, son of S√≥lyom. Bogomer was mentioned as Master of the cupbearers for Duke B√©la by several charters throughout 1225. In the next year, B√©la was transferred to Transylvania, he governed the province with the title Duke too. Bogomer followed his lord to Transylvania. The earliest royal charter mentioning a \\"count and commander of the Sz√©kelys\\" () was issued in 1235, which refers to a military campaign launched against Bulgaria in 1228. Accordingly, Bogomer, then Count of the Sz√©kelys, participated in the war, when he was captured by the army of Ivan Asen II's brother Alexander. Bogomer is the first known holder of the dignity, albeit Bishop Otto of Freising already mentioned that \\"two counts\\" commanded the archers in the vanguard of the Hungarian army in the Battle of the Fischa in 1146, while the Hungarian chronicles recorded that Sz√©kelys and Pechenegs formed the vanguard of the Hungarian army in that battle, thus the bishop's report may contain the first reference to a count of the Sz√©kelys, according to Attila Zsoldos, Gyula Krist√≥, and other historians. On the other hand, as historian Zolt√°n Kord√© emphasizes, 13th-century royal charters mentioned other royal officials who ruled Sz√©kely groups, suggesting that the office had not been established in the previous century. For instance, a royal charter narrated of an army of Saxon, Vlach, Sz√©kely, and Pecheneg troops fighting in Bulgaria under the command of Joachim, Count of Hermannstadt, in the early 1210s, which suggests Bogomer could be the first-ever office-holder, who possibly became count already in 1226. Kord√© argued Andrew II granted autonomy to colonial Saxons of Hermannstadt region in Southern Transylvania, when issued Diploma Andreanum (1224), just before the following year, when he launched a campaign against the Teutonic Knights, who had attempted to eliminate his suzerainty. According to Kord√©, the standardization of the Sz√©kelys' status took place in the same time. Bogomer next appeared in sources one and a half decades later, even after B√©la's accession to the Hungarian throne in 1235 and the Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1241. After the Mongols' unexpected withdrawal in March 1242, Bogomer was appointed isp√°n of Nyitra and Trencs√©n Counties. In that capacity, Bogomer was responsible for restore law and order in the region, while managed to resettle the dispersed and fleeing population. Soon he was replaced as head of Nyitra County by Roland R√°t√≥t around November 1242, but he was able to retain his dignity in Trencs√©n County at least until April 1243. During his tenure, Frederick II, Duke of Austria invaded the country. Bogomer played an important role in the suppression of Austrian units, shortly thereafter he led a royal army send to help Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste (son-in-law of B√©la IV, the Hungarian king) attacked by Konrad I of Masovia. For his loyalty and military successes, Bogomer was granted the lands of Kiszuca (Jeszeszin), Pruska and Mortund (in Trencs√©n and Hont Counties) by B√©la in May 1244. He was transferred to the position of isp√°n of Zala County by December 1245. Bogomer died by 24 October 1254, when Jeszeszin, his previously owned land was donated to members of the Z√≥lyom kinship.

First described in 1602 by the explorer Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no, it stood next to a creek in what is now Monterey State Historic Park. The tree was declared dead in 1904 and cut down in 1905. The preserved trunk and lower branches were erected in the grounds of the Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo where they remained for most of the 20th century. Although the remains of the tree have since been removed, pieces of it are on display in local museums. History The tree once stood in a ravine whose creek flowed into the southern end of Monterey Bay. It was there that the Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no expedition drew fresh water after entering the bay on December 3, 1602. On December 17, 1602 the Carmelite friars of the Vizca√≠no expedition held a mass under the tree and Vizca√≠no claimed Monterey for Spain. Vizca√≠no also noted the tree in his descriptions of the bay for future expeditions. In 1769 Gaspar de Portol√† led an expedition to find the bay and establish Monterey as a Spanish settlement. After initially failing to find it, he was successful in May 1770 after following Jun√≠pero Serra's suggestion to look for the large oak tree described by Vizca√≠no. On June 3, 1770 bells were hung from the tree.

It became a flop at the box office due to lack of interest in moviegoers. Critical Reception The film got mixed to poor reviews at the box office. The Times of India gave it 2.5 stars and wrote, \\"Lakshman Karya falters a bit with his screenplay in parts, inserting unwanted sequences that don‚Äôt move the story forward in any manner. Nor does he deliver a satisfying enough conclusion for Akshara to suddenly realise her folly. However, he must be lauded for attempting to deliver something more than usual gloss. Shaktikath Karthik is a delight, with his music not blocking the flow of the film in any manner, S Thaman‚Äôs BGM‚Äôs on the other hand falters in certain scenes.\\" GreatAndhra gave it two stars and wrote, \\"All in all, ‚ÄúHappy Wedding‚Äù is a simple love story of a confused girl that is told with some bright visuals, some nice jokes but turns out to be dreary and nagging.\\" 123telugu gave the film three stars and stated, \\"On the whole, Happy Wedding is a passable family drama which showcases a contemporary theme which is synonymous with the current generation. The emotions work well but the film takes its own time to register as it is based on urban relationships and bonding. Because of this, some might really like it and a few other sections may disown it right away giving the film a limited appeal this weekend.\\" Sify gave the film 2.5 stars and said, \\"Happy Wedding is all about plastic romance, plastic emotions. It is much like extended short film with wafer thin plot of a young woman with insecurities that come from her past relationship. It drags on post interval.\\" Idlebrain's Jeevi said, \\"Though it‚Äôs a remake of a Marathi blockbuster Mumbai Pune Mumbai 2, Happy Wedding is a risky film to make despite being in salable genres like romance and family drama because the entire film revolves around a wafer-thin subject. The director has succeeded in getting few moments right, but couldn‚Äôt give a racy narration and a convincing second half. The entire film is class and glossy and will be liked the ultra class audiences. The lack of logic (heroine‚Äôs foolishness in second half and hero‚Äôs lethargy in first half (not going to bus station when his fiance is waiting all alone)) which form the basic conflict point might make you squirm!\\".

Types of Setapa Music Dance  Setapa music dance exists in three different types, which are: * Setapa sa dipitse : this is a kind of dance which is performed and produces the sound of a galloping horse in the ground. * Setapa sa phathisi : Setapa which is performed whilst the lower part of the trouser is tied with a peg or the use of short pants made of animal skin usually referred to as tshega. This kind of influence of tying a knot in a trouser using a peg was adopted from the Bakwena tribe dance known as Phathisi. * Setapa sa go goga maoto: The kind of Bangwaketse dance is performed by dragging feet on the ground. Go goga maoto is a Tswana phrase which means to drag feet. The dance is adopted from the neighbourhood tribe Basarwa dance called tsutsube. The cause of dance adoption in the three types mentioned is sharing of borders between districts.  Setapa Costume  Setapa troupes wear flip flops called diphamphathana made of tyres, and knee shin guard like made of animal skins including the hare and antelope, spring boks and duikers. The trousers used by men are called motseto and also made of antelope skin, they are usually cut short or rolled up to the knee level to allow for the shin and diphamphathana. Traditionally, ladies put on the traditional skirts made of animal skin known as Diphaeyana. The skin is usually selected from animals such as phuti (duiker), phuduhudu and tshepe. The females never used diphamphathana like males instead they used some sandals made from an oxen head skin. The females sandals were called Dikhube in Tswana.Setapa Costume ended in the olden days, nowadays the Setapa generation put on some fashion clothes such as some prints by Germans, whilst males put on some fashion blazers and formal trousers and they use their leg rattles to produce rattling sound as they dance.

The group consists of members Tyler Randall and Rob Keenan. Dawg Yawp‚Äôs music is known for melding intricate harmonies and unique instrumentation, including Randall‚Äôs sitar, which is amplified and played while standing, and the use of electronic synthesis, samples and drum beats. History 2006‚Äì2014: Beginning, College In 2006, Tyler Randall and Rob Keenan became friends while both attending Turpin High School. After graduating, Keenan spent three years at Indiana University while Randall finished high school. During their time apart, Randall and Keenan would collaborate on music over the weekends. After Randall graduated from high school, he attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. Keenan soon joined Randall as a student at Berklee, although both eventually dropped out to focus on their musical careers. While attending Berklee, Randall was the first student to have sitar as their principal instrument. During his time at Berklee, Randall experimented with the sitar in genres such as free improvisation, Middle Eastern fusion, jazz, and American roots. He began busking in the subways and on the streets. Randall also became active in the electronic underground music scene and hosted events. Randall cofounded an underground electronic music collective known as ElecSonic, for which Keenan helped produce events. Keenan departed ElecSonic to focus on songwriting. Randall eventually departed ElecSonic to focus on his own music, and has collaborated with Phonoride, Sonnymoon, Time Wharp, Teebs, The Gaslamp Killer, Gonjasufi and Kaytranada. After leaving Berklee, Randall and Keenan relocated to Chicago, IL, then Nederland, CO to focus on writing music. The two eventually found their way back to Newport, KY, located directly across the river from their native Cincinnati, OH. During this time the members would conceive Dawg Yawp. 2015: Dawg Yawp Formation, Two Hearted EP In Cincinnati, Randall and Keenan worked together at a local waffle restaurant, Taste of Belgium.

Despite an intense search and rescue operation, no trace of the family was discovered and the search was called off. In 2009, the presumed remains of the adult members of the family were discovered by hikers who were searching for evidence of the fate of the tourists, and conclusive proof of the fate of the male adult was later established. Background The family consisted of 34-year-old German architect Egbert Rimkus, his 11-year-old son Georg Weber, Rimkus's 27-year-old girlfriend Cornelia Meyer and her 4-year-old son Max Meyer, all of whom were from Dresden, Germany. The group arrived in the United States on 8 July 1996 at Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, immediately flying on to Los Angeles International Airport, where they rented a green 1996 Plymouth Voyager minivan. They spent some time in the San Clemente area of Southern California, then drove to Las Vegas, Nevada, where they stayed at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino. The family then drove to Death Valley National Park on 22 July, where they bought two copies of the \\"Death Valley National Monument Museum Text\\" (in German) at the Furnace Creek Visitors Center and spent their first night camping out in a canyon near Telescope Peak. The next day, the group traveled to various tourist sites, with Cornelia signing the names of all the family members on a visitors' log at an abandoned mining camp and stopping at the Geologist's Cabin in Warm Springs Canyon.  Disappearance and search  The family had booked a flight from Los Angeles to return to Germany on 27 July 1996, but there was no evidence that they boarded the flight or departed the United States. Rimkus's ex-wife Heike Weber became concerned when her ex-husband and son did not return from their vacation, and she began to inquire about their whereabouts. On 21 October 1996, the family's rental minivan was discovered in an extremely remote part of the park () known as Anvil Canyon by a Death Valley National Park (DVNP) ranger aboard a helicopter conducting a routine aerial surveillance mission looking for illegal drug manufacturing labs. Subsequent inspection found three of the four tires were flat and the wheels damaged by driving over rocky terrain, and the vehicle had been driven on them for over . Over 200 search and rescue workers performed an extensive search of the area near the minivan. The search failed to yield any clues to the whereabouts of the family except for a single beer bottle that was discovered under a bush over a mile away from the stranded vehicle (). On 26 October 1996 the authorities called off the search for the missing tourists. Discovery of remains On November 12, 2009, Les Walker and Tom Mahood, two hikers who were off-duty search and rescue personnel looking for traces of the family, discovered the skeletal remains of two adults (), one male and one female, with identification belonging to the missing tourists found near the bodies. Although DNA was recovered only from the bones of Rimkus, authorities claimed they were fairly certain that the bones belonged to the missing Germans. The remains of the children were never officially discovered, although the sole of a shoe, possibly from one of the children, was found. Supposedly, bones resembling those of children were found by searchers near where the adults' remains were found, but no official report was made following up on this discovery. Mahood speculated that, while vacationing in Death Valley on 23 July 1996, the family, short on time and wanting to visit Yosemite National Park on their way back to Los Angeles, attempted to take a shortcut to Yosemite on a route the difficulty of which they underestimated. Once their vehicle became stranded in a wash, the family traveled on foot southwards to seek help at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, where they may have expected to find a well-patrolled fenced perimeter, a common feature of military bases in Germany but not of military bases in the desert areas of the Southwestern United States. The family likely succumbed to heat stroke (average high temperature of 116.5 ¬∞F / 46.9 ¬∞C in July), dehydration and lack of shelter halfway to the base perimeter.

It was discovered by James Dunlop in 1826. It is located approximately 5,000 light years away from Earth, in the Carina-Sagittarius arm.  Characteristics  Location within the constellation NGC 4103 is a young open cluster. Its age has been determined to be 30 Myr by Sagar & Cannon (1997), 20 ¬± 5 Myr by Sanner et al. (2001) and 6 Myr by Piskunov et al. (2004). The metallicity of NGC 4103 is subsolar (‚àí0.47). The tidal radius of the cluster is 12.1 - 15.9 parsecs (39 - 51 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 4103, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core.  Members  There are 421 probable member stars within the angular radius of the cluster and 199 within the central part of the cluster. No blue straggler has been detected in the cluster. The cluster is not very richly populated and is dominated by moderately bright stars of 10th magnitude and fainter. The hottest stars of the cluster are of spectral type B2. No red giants have been found to be members of the cluster. One member of the cluster is a Be star. Among the members of the cluster is AI Crucis, a short-period semi-detached massive close binary star, with orbit period 1.41771 days.

He took part in oceanographic research aboard the icebreaker A. Sibiryakov (1932) and Chelyuskin (1933‚Äì1934), the latter expedition ended in disaster with the ship being crushed by ice and the rescue involved the survivors building a runway on ice for the rescue aircraft to land.

In early 1950 Belopolsky's brother was held on trial allegedly for spying for England and shot dead. Both his parents were arrested and sent to labour camps and in 1952 he too was sentenced for five years to Siberia. He had to return his awards and it was only after Stalin's death that Belopolsky was released from prison camp. He was rehabilitated and joined the Zoological Institute at Leningrad. The director Professor Yevgeny Pavlovsky allowed him to continue his research in the Baltic.

From 1992 to 1998, he served at the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch. In 1998, he returned to Fujian to serve as the assistant to the Mayor of Xiamen and other bureaux when Xi Jinping, later becoming General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, was the Governor of Fujian.

The Euphrates Crossing offensive, conducted by government troops, was done with the aim of denying US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and the US itself leverage over the Syrian government. The offensive was concurrent with the two SDF offensives, the Battle of Raqqa and the northern Deir ez-Zor offensive, as well the Hawija Offensive in Iraq. Background 2011‚Äì14 Protests against the Syrian government and violence in the Syrian city Deir ez-Zor took place since March 2011, but large-scale fighting began in late November 2011, in order for the rebels to take control of the eastern part of Syria. By the end of 2013, rebels took over most of the province, leaving only a small pocket of government control in and around the city of Deir ez-Zor. 2014‚Äì17 Following the expansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant in late 2013 and early 2014, ISIL forces launched a major offensive against the rebels in the province and the city of Deir Ez-Zor, pushing out rebel forces and besieging government troops in Deir ez-Zory city. For more than three years, the Syrian Arab Army managed to keep control of the western half of the city, while ISIL was in control of the entire eastern side of the city. During this time ISIL launched several offensives to capture the remaining parts of the city with limited gains. Summer 2017 On 27 August, as part of a wider campaign in central Syria against ISIL, the Syrian Arab Army, launched a major offensive against the city of Deir ez-Zor in an attempt to break the siege. On 3 September, pro-government forces broke through to the city's first lines of defense around 10 pm. Two days later, the siege was broken. Soon after, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) launched an offensive on ISIL positions east of the Euphrates River on 8 September, with US and Kurd officials announcing they would not allow the Syrian Arab Army to descend across the Euphrates. Meanwhile, on 10 September, the Syrian Arab Army broke the siege of the Deir ez-Zor military airport, after which they pushed to the south. Concurrently the SDF broke through to the outskirts of the city on the other side of the Euphrates and occupied the industrial zone and the main road. On 11 September, the Syrian Arab Army and the pro-government media announced the beginning of an offensive and amphibious landing over the Euphrates River, beginning with the installation of pontoon bridges and amphibians. The announcement in the pro-government media was that the military operation would be called the Assad's jump on the occasion of the birthday of Syrian President Bashar al- Assad. On 15 September, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced the beginning of an army offensive across the Euphrates River, and a day later the Russian air force bombed the positions of the SDF northeast of Deir ez-Zor. Elsewhere, pro-government forces, with the support of Russian air strikes, launched operations against Deir ez-Zor city's northwestern district. The same day, the Syrian government announced the start of an offensive on Al- Bukamal and the complete closure of the border with Iraq.Pro-Damascus alliance declares Syria offensive near Iraq border, Reuters The offensive On 18 September, pro-government forces crossed the Euphrates River using makeshift bridges, and launched an offensive on the east bank of the city of Deir ez- Zor, advancing within 3 miles (5 km) of positions held by the SDF. The next day, the SAA said that pro-government forces continued to advance on the east bank of the Euphrates, including an assault against al-Sabah village. On 20 September, the Russian Defense Ministry accused the US-backed SDF of assisting ISIL in East Deir Ez-Zor in various ways in an attempt to prevent the Syrian army and its paramilitaries from capturing the region. Russian General Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the Ministry, noted that the strongest ISIL counter-attacks and artillery shelling on the Syrian Army bridge on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River came from the north where the US and Kurdish forces hold positions, not from the south where most ISIL forces were. The Russian general accused the US Coalition of other acts of sabotage against the forces of the Syrian army. US denied complicity with ISIS. On 21 September, ISIL released video appearing to show it was deploying armed drones to prevent the SAA from expanding its positions on the east coast of Deir ez- Zor. ISIS opened fire on the Syrian army, but the army did not report any losses. Meanwhile, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) continued its march along the east coast of the Euphrates River, capturing a new town located near the strategic Al-'Omar's oil fields after fierce clashes with ISIS members. With the support of heavy artillery from the 113th and 137th Brigades of the 17th Division, the 5th Legion of the Syrian Arab Army reported it had overcome the positions of the ISIS east of the recently captured al-Marat in order to advance to Mazloum.

To the right is the monastic kitchen where nuns cook and serve breakfast and lunch to the monks and visitors.

It is at a distance of from Yangon and 136 kilometers north of Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State. The summit is above . Monkeys live atop the mountain and are fed by pilgrims. History Canopy of ancient Bodhi Tree atop Kaylartha Mountain in Mon State, Myanmar Monkey searching for food near the Kaylartha Monastery, December 2018 At the top of Mount Kaylartha stands a pagoda said to house a hair of the Buddha. It is believed that in the Tharthanar Era (111), the Gautama Buddha arrived at the Kaylartha Mountain, Thuwunna Bonmi. He stayed at a monastery built by King Tissa Dama Thiha Yaza. The Buddha preached sermons to the public for seven days. During that time, he became close with the Hermits Tissa and Thiha and the local hermit of Kaylartha Mountain. They requested that he leave behind some relic to be revered by the people in his place after he left to return home. Buddha agreed and gave six of his hairs to hermits from Kyaiktiyo, Zinkyaik (to Tissa), Mount Zwegabin (to Thiha), Kaylartha, Kuthaerayone and Melan. A pair of belu brothers from Kyaikhtisaung also received a hair. All the hermits and belus enshrined the hair in great stones. The Hermit of Kaylartha, whose name was Tila of Dokkhalun, discussed how to go about enshrining the hairs and building pagodas around them with Hermits Tissa and Thiha and Indra Sakka, who had supported Thiha in constructing a pagoda on Mount Zwegabin. He enshrined the hair relic in the pagoda atop Kaylartha Mountain, and was advised by Indra Sakka. The hermits communicated with each other by shining lights atop their respective mountains at nighttime. Tissa, who stayed atop Zinkyaik Mountain, did not see light coming from Mountain Kaylartha and wondered what might have occurred. He went to Kaylartha Mountain and found the body of the Kaylartha Hermit. The body was burnt and buried, while the head, which was not burnt nor decomposed, held one of Buddha's hairs in its braid. It was returned to Mok Soe Taung Pagoda and joined the original two hair relics there. Restoration The Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw restored nine Buddha hair relic pagodas during his lifetime, with Kaylartha Pagoda being one of them. He built a compound around the pagoda and paved a road up to the top. It is now a popular spot for tourists and locals and had a resident abbot and monastery at the summit of the mountain. Mining In 2016, a rock and quarry project aimed at producing rock suitable for road paving was suspended on Kaylatha Mountain. On October 19, the Hluttaw state representative of Belin Township Constituency No. 1, Dr. Khin Naing Oo, sent a letter of opposition regarding the preparation for a mining project on the forest reserve to the President and various other respective government departments. The project was headed by Rock Well Mining Co., Ltd.. U Ohn Win, minister of the Natural Resource and Environmental Conservation Ministry, visited the area nine days later on October 28. He witnessed the field work taking place and decided to suspend the work. A temporary ban was placed from mining on the historic site. Eventually, quarry projects were permitted to operate only along the boundaries of the Kaylatha Mountain nature conservation area (45 acres of land) as they had historically been quarry sites.

It dates to around 1515 and is now displayed in the East Closet of Hampton Court Palace as part of the Royal Collection. It has similarities with the Holy Family with the Infant Saint John the Baptist and so it probably dates to around the time Correggio painted the frescoes in the Camera di San Paolo or possibly slightly earlier. It shows the Holy Family and saint Jerome. History It can be identified with the \\"canvas ... painted with the Madonna with the [Christ] Child in her arms, saint Jerome and saint Joseph, with a carved golden frame 72 V[incenzo]\\" mentioned on a list of paintings owned by Vincenzo I Gonzaga as of 23 January 1627. It is unknown whether or not it entered the Gonzaga collection thanks to Vincenzo I, but given his interest in Correggio it seems the most plausible hypothesis - he definitely acquired the same artist's Madonna and Child with Saint Francis and the Rest on the Flight into Egypt, for example. The Flemish art dealer Daniel Nys was tasked by Charles I with acquiring the Gonzaga collection and easily recognised it as a work by Correggio despite its lack of a signature. His correspondence mentions a Madonna by Correggio with the head of St. Joseph which for unknown reasons was one of the works which had not reached Nys at Venice - this seems to be The Holy Family with Saint Jerome. The fact that Nys wrote in 1628 lamenting the work's absence and stating \\"it must be found\\" shows the high value he placed on it. The painting eventually reached Britain and entered Charles' collection - his coat of arms is on its reverse, though it is not mentioned as being by Correggio in the inventory of Charles' collection. It was re-identified as a work by Correggio in 1870 by Jean Paul Richter and his attribution has been followed by all subsequent art historians.

While living in New York, Stern took art classes at the New York School for Social Research, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1965 the Sterns moved across the United States and settled in Santa Monica, California, a relocation that would lead to their breakthroughs as artists. The couple shared a symbiotic artistic relationship and exhibited together throughout their careers. Career Stern enjoyed early success in her watercolors, the techniques of which would heavily influence her later, more prolific acrylic works. During the 1970s she exhibited extensively on the east and west coasts, her work frequently drawing comparisons to that of contemporary Color Field artists Morris Louis and Helen Frankenthaler. On the relationship between Stern and Morris, one critic wrote: \\"‚Ä¶ technique is all they share; the statements both artists make about the nature of paint differ. Louis' stains and pours often follow the force of gravity, so that paint appears to be drawn by its own pull towards the periphery of the canvas. Stern, on the other hand, makes acrylic seem weightless. It floats on white pristine canvas. It masses into rich areas with a spatial depth that Louis' works lack. It is forced onto the surface in many directions by an energy source beyond the paintings' edges.\\" Stern is identified with pure abstract forms of semi-translucent color on large, unprimed canvases. Commentators have recurrently suggested her subject matter is floral, despite no affirmation of such from the artist. In 1974 Stern partook in the \\"Childe Hassam Purchase Award Exhibition\\" at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York. Her first solo exhibition, Irene Monat Stern: Paintings, took place at The Downtown Gallery in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1975. In 1981 the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden acquired three of her large-scale paintings. Stern's painting activity significantly declined in the 1980s as she became her husband's primary caregiver following his diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In 2011 Stern contributed a chapter to the volume How We Survived‚Äì 52 Personal Stories by Child Survivors of the Holocaust. Stern is represented by Hollis Taggart Galleries, New York City.

He was the longtime companion of Virgil Thomson. Biography Maurice Grosser was born on October 23, 1903, in Huntsville, Alabama. Grosser attended Harvard University where he studied mathematics, graduating with honors in 1924. While at university, a friend brought Grosser to a life painting class at the Boston Architectural School. From then on he continued life drawing there and at the South Boston Art School. While at Harvard, Grosser also took painting classes from Denman Ross. While still a student, Grosser's paintings were displayed at the Fogg Art Museum. Grosser was awarded Harvard's Sheldon Fellowship which allowed him to study painting in France. He designed the scenery for two operas by Virgil Thomson: Four Saints in Three Acts (1934) and The Mother of Us All (1947). In 1985 he created 18 Portraits, and each lithograph was accompanied by a musical portrait composed by Thomson. Grosser wrote four books on painting and art criticism: Painting in Public/Painting in Our Time (Alfred A. Knoff, 1948/Chater Books, 1964), The Painter's Eye (Rinehart and Co., 1951), Critic's Eye (The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc., 1962), and Painter's Progress (Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., 1971). At the time of his death, Grosser was writing a memoir entitled Visiting Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas which was posthumously published in The Company They Kept: Writers on Unforgettable Friendships (New York Review Books, 2006). From 1956 to 1967 he served as art critic for The Nation. From 1969-1970 he was a Visiting Professor of Art at the University of Ife, Nigeria. Grosser died on December 22, 1986, in Manhattan and his ashes are interred at Maple Hill Cemetery, Huntsville. Relationship with Virgil Thomson Maurice and Virgil met in 1920 while both were attending meetings of The Liberal Club at Harvard but the intimate relationship between the two would not fully blossom until they met by chance in 1925 at Deux Magots, a cafe in Paris. The pair would continue their relationship as lovers and then as best friends for the rest of their lives.

This was the setting for the largest pro-Francoist demonstrations both during the dictator's life and after his death. Francoists who remain nostalgic of the regime still commemorate his death here every 20 November (known in Spanish as 20-N). Sociological Francoism () is an expression used in Spain which attests to the social characteristics typical of Francoism that survived in Spanish society after the death of Francisco Franco in 1975 and continue to the present day. The root causes of sociological Francoism are found in the prolonged state of repression that existed during the forty years of the Franco dictatorship (1936‚Äì1975), and the fear of a repetition of the Spanish Civil War and a clashing of the so-called two Spains. A further reason for its durability is the positive role attributed to Francoism in the Spanish economic boom (the Spanish miracle, 1959‚Äì1975), while avoiding reference to the mass Spanish emigration or the period of economic recession that prevailed during the ten years following the Transition (1975‚Äì1985). All of this led the Spanish social majority, including even those identified with the anti-Francoist opposition, to perpetuate the conservative and survivalist behaviours that were learned and transmitted from generation to generation since the 1940s. These include self-censorship and the voluntary submission and conformity to authority ‚Äì which in extreme cases could even be classified as servility (most commonly identified with the \\"silent majority\\") ‚Äì which provided the regime with its cheapest, most effective and most ubiquitous form of repression. In an interview with Xavier Moret, the writer Manuel V√°zquez Montalb√°n described the phenomenon in the following way: > There was a sociological Francoism which existed before and still exists to > a greater or lesser extent today, coupled with Francoist rhetoric in which > only the best years ‚Äì those of 1962 or 1963 and the first part of the 1970s > ‚Äì are remembered, omitting the years of misery and the economic recession > that existed prior to the Spanish Civil War and continued to grow under > Francoism. The economically prosperous years have been mythologized within > sociological Francoism; however, we should remind ourselves that this > success was based on exporting the unemployed first to Catalonia and the > Basque Country and then later to Europe. In a similar vein, the philosopher Jos√© Luis L√≥pez Aranguren has written that \\"Francoism, while originally a political system, transformed into a way of life for the Spanish people\\".  Sociological Francoism and political culture  In the exercise of political power, sociological Francoism is defined as \\"the political culture of identification with the [Francoist] regime\\". However, the journalist Antonio Maestre adds a definition that goes beyond the political sphere, describing sociological Francoism as: > The collection of citizens and politicians that, having lived well under > Francoism and supported its ideas, were in favour of opening up the regime > to a certain degree to ensure that the Transition would proceed in a > tolerable direction. The popularity of Franco during his dictatorship was not measured in opinion polls, but in the legitimacy of the army and the charismatic legitimacy of his person (caudillismo), as well as the widespread social binding that took place through the Movimiento nacional (all of which are typical elements of fascism). Together, these ensured massive public demonstrations of support and the practically unanimous results in sporadically held national referenda (such as the Spanish organic law referendum of 1966). In 1969, in one of his last televised Christmas addresses, Franco spoke of Spain's future, saying that all was atado y bien atado (literally \\"tied and well tied\\", referring to the institutionalization of his regime), which became a popular saying in Spain. Any clues to his personal health were carefully scrutinized, as were his cryptically-expressed intentions, such as the phrase no hay mal que por bien no venga (roughly equivalent to \\"every cloud has a silver lining\\"), which he used in reference to the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco in 1973 by the Basque separatist group ETA, and whose meaning was the subject of endless speculation. In a secret 1971 interview with Vernon Walters, envoy of Richard Nixon, Franco expressed his opinion that upon his death, Spanish society would carry out a political evolution that would not break with his legacy, as the now larger and more well-off Spanish middle class would avoid risking another civil war. In the regime change that followed Franco's death in 1975, however, those that remained most loyal to Francoism were relegated to far-right movements that failed to gain a single seat in 1977 (and only elected a single MP, Blas Pi√±ar, in the second general elections in 1979 under the coalitionist Uni√≥n nacional banner). The political right, represented by a coalition of former Francoist administrators under the banner of the Alianza Popular (referred to as aperturistas, those in favour of social reform), attempted to strike a balance between the need to connect with the social majority while at the same time minimizing associations with the past, though with very little electoral success. During the 1970s and 1980s, the social majority tended to vote for parties from the centre (such as the UCD, led by Adolfo Su√°rez) or the left (PSOE). In a book about the Transition, Alfonso Osorio, a member of the 1977 Adolfo Su√°rez government, describes the reasons behind Alianza Popular's failure to capitalize on sociological Francoism: > What the Alianza Popular intended for, in essence, was to use sociological > francoism to their advantage. But as it worked out, what they actually > capitalized on was the lingering, and less significant, political > Francoism...In the meantime, this sociological Francoism...favoured other > democratic options closer to the centre. Yet the political system continued to show elements inherited from Francoism. The debate between a post-Franco reforma o ruptura (political reform or rupture) ended in a compromise reform established by constitutional consensus, as left-wing parties were conscious that their own weakness prevented a full rupture with the old regime. From 1976 onwards, King Juan Carlos I (designated by Franco as his successor in 1969) and his team of close advisors (essentially Torcuato Fern√°ndez-Miranda and Adolfo Su√°rez) implemented the agreed-upon reform, which left both the inmovilistas (ultraconservatives) and the best-known aperturistas (progressives such as Manuel Fraga and Jos√© Mar√≠a de Areilza) sidelined from the process. The degree of democracy thus achieved is questioned by some writers, including Armando L√≥pez Salinas, who considers it essentially controlled reform, in some sense similar to Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's characterization of the Italian unification in his novel The Leopard: The ruling classes need to change something so that everything remains the same\\".  Con Franco viv√≠amos mejor  A sign of the survival of Francoist sentiment in a large segment of the population was, among other things, the widespread success of far-right sympathiser Fernando Vizca√≠no Casas' satirical novels (Al tercer a√±o resucit√≥, De camisa vieja a chaqueta nueva), which express viewpoints associated with the then-popular saying \\"Con Franco viv√≠amos mejor\\" (literally, \\"We lived better with Franco\\"). Even in 2007, in the context of the debates surrounding the Historical Memory Law, there was still resistance among large segments of society and the political establishment to condemn Francoism, as demonstrated by Spanish right-wing politician Jaime Mayor Oreja: > Why should I have to condemn Francoism when there were many families that > lived it with naturalness and normality? In my Basque lands there were > endless myths. The [Spanish Civil] war was much worse than Francoism. Some > say that the persecutions in Basque towns were terrible, but it can't have > been the case if all the Civil Guards from Galicia were asking to be sent to > the Basque Country. It was a situation of extraordinary tranquility. Let's > leave the commentaries on Francoism to the historians. The so-called \\"traditional values\\" also remained identified with Francoism: country, religion, and family. As such, \\"Francoism\\" is used, in some respects, as synonymous with conservatism, patriarchy, traditionalist conservatism, or authoritarianism; all long-standing phenomena that predate Franco. Indeed, some even reverse the cause and effect between Franco and sociologicial Francoism, positing Franco as the effect of a pre-existing sociological Francoism, as described by former El Pa√≠s editor-in-chief Juan Luis Cebri√°n: > I don't believe that Franco was the cause, but rather the consequence. I > don't think that Franco or Francoism were a sort of military group that > seized power, but rather the physical manifestation, or result, of a way of > understanding Spain. And a large part of that way of understanding Spain has > been transmitted from generation to generation among the sectors of the > Spanish right-wing which former president Aznar belongs to, and in which I > was educated. I went to the same school as Aznar; my family is, > sociologically, like Aznar's; I studied where he studied, which is to say, > the Salamanca neighbourhood of Madrid. That is the sociological Francoism to > which I belonged, and thus know so well. The Spanish journalist Enrique Gil Calvo adds desarrollismo ‚Äì the quick and unscrupulous economic growth that brought about the so-called Spanish Miracle ‚Äì as another area that has remained identified with Francoism, describing Madrid as having changed from the \\"red breakwater of all the Spains\\" to an \\"ostentatious showcase of upstart sociological neo-Francoism\\". The writer Manuel V√°zquez Montalb√°n has been attributed with penning the satirical derivative phrase \\"contra Franco viv√≠amos mejor\\" (literally \\"We lived better against Franco\\").  Esto con Franco no pasaba  Another saying that remains present in Spanish society is \\"Esto con Franco no pasaba\\" (literally \\"This never used to happen with Franco\\"). It was initially used as a way of denouncing behaviours, arising soon after the death of Franco, that contradicted the norms of the then-pervasive ultra-Catholic morality (see: the destape (literally \\"uncovering\\") period of Spanish cinema that followed the abolition of censorship, or the Movida Madrile√±a). Currently it is only used in a rhetorical way to point out the irony that, despite living in a liberal democracy, some freedoms that were permitted by the Francoist regime, such as smoking in public places or barbecuing in the mountains or the beach, have been taken away. Similarly, it is used to criticize current problems in society that did not exist in the Franco era, like the Spanish property bubble, and the consequent delay in young adults leaving the family home.  Moncloa syndrome  The Palace of Moncloa has been the official residence of the Prime Minister since Adolfo Su√°rez moved it from the former, traditional, location at 3 Paseo de la Castellana next to the Plaza de Col√≥n in Madrid. The isolation attributed to the new location, in a palace whose setting in the northeastern part of the capital brings to mind Franco's residence in the Royal Palace of El Pardo, is reflected in the expression \\"Moncloa syndrome\\", which is used to describe the haughtiness or detachment from reality that has supposedly affected all successive Prime Ministers. Debates have continued as to whether, in a democratic sense, the lasting effects of Francoism were greater or lesser than the actual changes. One aspect described as an inheritance from the Francoist past is the notable individualism of Spain's leadership (e.g. Adolfo Suarez, Felipe Gonz√°lez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, Mariano Rajoy and Pedro S√°nchez) coupled with the extraordinary sway that the government holds over the parliament, much greater than in other European democracies. Although the 1978 Constitution cannot be described as a presidential system, the powers held by the Prime Minister are ample. On the other hand, the investiture of the Prime Minister has always occurred without too many issues until the inconclusive 2015 general election, especially compared to other parliamentary democracies (such as Italy); government mandates have been stable (except for the failed coup d'√©tat of 1981, or perhaps precisely because of it) and lengthy (except the government of Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, due to that same circumstance), and had never resorted to coalition government, until the second S√°nchez Government in 2020. A final aspect is the fact that the Spanish government has traditionally been a two-party system with smaller, peripheral nationalist/regionalist parties, although the recent rise of Podemos and Ciudadanos has produced a more fragmented parliament.  Criticism of the concept  In an essay, the Spanish academic Carlos Ollero expressed the following reservations about the concept of sociological Francoism: > I think that this expression is imprecise and can lend itself to > misunderstandings. It is necessary to distinguish between two interrelated, > yet different, meanings, with varying degrees of effectiveness. The first, > stricter, meaning refers to the complex of socioeconomic structures and > concrete interests that are created, maintained and strengthened by the > Francoist system. The second, too broad, includes under the umbrella term of > \\"sociological Francoism\\" what, in general terms, can be understood as the > ensemble of sociopolitical attitudes, consistencies in personal and > collective behaviour, and passive or indecisive inertia prompted by forty > years of steadfast exercise of personal power.

The Danish ambassador to Britain Jens WolffByron, Sully, and the Power of Portraiture visited the oratory in 1785 and mentioned \\"the absurd effect provoked by the zeal of some ignorant fanatic who in the church of Madonna della Scala nailed a silver crown onto the Virgin painted by Correggio and thus disfigured an incomparable work by an act of the grossest barbarity\\".http://www.correggioarthome.it/SchedaOpera.jsp?idDocumentoArchivio=2522 Germaine de Sta√´l, in her 1807 novel Corinne, also described the fresco as \\"perhaps the only painting which knows how to give to lowered eyes a raised and penetrating expression as if they were raised to heaven.

He debuted in sumo wrestling in March 2016 and made his makuuchi debut in September 2017. His highest rank has been ≈çzeki. He has earned six special prizes, and one gold star for defeating a yokozuna. In May 2019 he won his first top division y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship, the first of the Reiwa era. He was also runner up in November 2019 and finished the calendar year with more top division wins than any other wrestler. He wrestles for Takasago stable. Background After initially showing more interest and aptitude for handball, Ishibashi began to concentrate on sumo in Junior High School. He took part in the national championships in his third year but sustained an elbow injury which led to him considering quitting the sport. He then attended Toyama Commercial High School and was persuaded to persevere by the school's sumo director.Êúù‰πÉÂ±± ÂøúÊè¥„Çà„Çç„Åó„Åè Êñ∞ÂçÅ‰∏°ÊòáÈÄ≤„ÅßÁúåÂ∫ÅË®™Âïè ‰∏≠Êó•Êñ∞ËÅû 2017Âπ¥1Êúà28Êó• After competing successfully in High School tournaments he won a place at Kindai University where he studied Economics. He won seven college titles and reached the top four in all-Japan Sumo Championships.„Éô„Éº„Çπ„Éú„Éº„É´„Éª„Éû„Ç¨„Ç∏„É≥Á§æÂàä „ÄéÁõ∏Êí≤„Äè 2016Âπ¥2ÊúàÂè∑ÔºàÂàùÂ†¥ÊâÄÁ∑èÊ±∫ÁÆóÂè∑Ôºâ 95È†Å Career Early career In 2016 Ishibashi joined the professional Takasago stable, bringing him under the tutelage of the former ≈çzeki Asashio. Like most new wrestlers he began his career under his family name. As a University champion, Ishibashi was allowed to bypass the two lowest tiers of professional sumo and begin his career in the fourth sandanme division in March 2016. Three kachi-koshi (winning records) in his first three basho (tournaments) saw him promoted to the makushita division for September. Winning records in September and November were followed by a perfect 7-0 in January 2017 which earned him the divisional championship and promotion to the second division (j≈´ry≈ç). At this point he took the shikona (ring name) of Asanoyama. His promotion ensured that Takasago stable would once again have a sekitori, following the demotions of Asasekiry≈´ and to makushita which had left the stable with no wrestlers in the top two divisions for the first time since 1878. Asanoyama revealed his determination to reach j≈´ry≈ç to honour the memory of his sumo coach at high school who had recently died of cancer, and that his resolve did not falter even though he lost two matches in November and had to wait for one more tournament to earn promotion. In his j≈´ry≈ç debut in March 2017 Asanoyama recorded 10 wins to tie for the lead on the final day of the tournament but was beaten in a play-off by the much more experienced Toyohibiki. After 8 wins in May he tied for the championship with 11 wins in July but again lost a play-off, this time to his near contemporary Daiamami. His efforts were enough to secure promotion to the top makuuchi division for the next tournament. He was the second sandanme tsukedashi entrant to reach makuuchi following Yutakayama. Makuuchi career In his first tournament in the top division Asanoyama was assigned the rank of maegashira 16. He stood at only 3‚Äì3 after Day 6 but then went on a five-match winning streak and was on the leaderboard towards the end of the tournament, trailing G≈çeid≈ç by just one win on Day 13. He finished with a 10‚Äì5 record and was awarded the Fighting Spirit Prize. After his final match Asanoyama commented, \\"I have fought with the spirit of a challenger over the 15 days and that has led to my finishing with double figures in wins. I am really happy about that.\\" He was less successful in his second top division tournament, scoring only five wins against ten losses and barely avoiding demotion back to j≈´ry≈ç. In January 2018 he produced a 9‚Äì6 record from the rank of maegashira 16. In July he was on the leaderboard for much of the tournament and finished with an 11‚Äì4 record and a share of the Fighting Spirit prize. For the next few tournaments he remained in the middle of the maegashira ranks, mostly alternating between 8‚Äì7 and 7‚Äì8 records. Asanoyama receives the President's Cup from Donald Trump In the May 2019 tournament, the first to be held in the Reiwa era, he was the sole leader with ten wins and just one loss on Day 11. He lost his second bout of the tournament on Day 12, but regained the sole lead on Day 13 with a controversial win over Tochinoshin. He appeared to have hit the ground first, but the judges ruled that Tochinoshin‚Äôs heel had touched out of bounds. By defeating G≈çeid≈ç on Day 14 he won the tournament after his only challenger Kakury≈´ was defeated by Tochinoshin, leaving Asanoyama two wins ahead with only one day to go. He was the first wrestler without previous sanyaku experience to win a y≈´sh≈ç since Sadanoyama in 1961. He lost his final day match to Mitakeumi to finish on a 12‚Äì3 record. In addition to the tournament championship he won special prizes for Outstanding Performance and Fighting Spirit and received the inaugural US President‚Äôs Cup from President Donald Trump. Speaking to reporters the day after his victory Asanoyama said that he never imagined he could win the championship within three years of his professional debut but that the next tournament would be different and he would be seeking a winning record. He was the first wrestler from Toyama Prefecture to win a top division championship in 103 years, and 25,000 people attended a parade in his hometown on June 16. In the July 2019 tournament he just missed out on a sanyaku debut, instead being ranked at maegashira 1. He fell one win short of his goal of kachi-koshi with a 7‚Äì8 record. On the fifth day of the September tournament he earned his first kinboshi or gold star for a win over a yokozuna, against Kakury≈´. He held a share of the tournament lead after Day 10, but lost both his bouts on Days 11 and 12 and finished with a 10‚Äì5 record. He was awarded his second Outstanding Performance Prize, for defeating Kakury≈´ and two ≈çzeki. He made his sanyaku debut in November 2019, one of four komusubi on the banzuke in that tournament. He is the first komusubi from Takasago stable since Asasekiry≈´ in 2006, the third post-World War II from Toyama Prefecture after Wakamiyama and Kotogaume, and the third from Kindai University after his stablemaster Asashio and Takarafuji. He was runner-up to Hakuh≈ç with an 11‚Äì4 record, and won his first Technique Prize. He also finished 2019 with 55 top division wins, more than any other wrestler that year. He is the first ranked below yokozuna or ≈çzeki to achieve the most wins in a calendar year. =Promotion to ≈çzeki= In the January 2020 tournament Asanoyama made his debut at sekiwake and produced a 10‚Äì5 record. The demotion of Takayasu and the retirement of G≈çeid≈ç left only one ≈çzeki on the March banzuke for the first time in 38 years, and Asanoyama told a press conference on 24 February, \\"There is another spot available for ≈çzeki. I want to make the most of this opportunity.\\" Asanoyama finished with an 11-4 record in the March tournament, good enough for a sumo advisory board to recommend his promotion to the ≈çzeki rank. The Japan Sumo Association officially promoted him on 25 March. He is the first ≈çzeki from Toyama Prefecture since the 22nd Yokozuna Tachiyama made the rank 111 years earlier; Asanoyama said he hoped to reach his level, and also inspire youngsters from his prefecture to join professional sumo. ≈åzeki career In his ≈çzeki debut in July 2020 Asanoyama was the tournament leader until Day 13 when he was defeated by former ≈çzeki Terunofuji. Asanoyama was unable to take advantage of Terunofuji's defeat the following day to Shodai when he lost for the second day in a row, falling victim to Terutsuyoshi's ashitori leg grab. He finished the tournament runner-up on 12‚Äì3. He made a poor start to his September campaign, losing his first three matches, which led to him being criticized by former yokozuna and Takasago stable member Asash≈çry≈´. He then won ten in a row before being defeated by Shodai and Takakeisho on the last two days to finish on 10-5. Fighting style Asanoyama has shown a preference for yotsu techniques which involve grasping his opponent's mawashi or belt. His most common kimarite or winning move is yorikiri, the force-out. His preferred grip is migi-yotsu, a right arm inside and left hand outside position, although in the run-up to the March 2020 tournament he worked on obtaining a left hand inside grip as well.

Instead of using wires to bend them, the branches keep being clipped as they grow. Every clip creates a new twist and a new session on the said branch, and in every session grows new branches. At last, as the tree keeps growing and being pruned in this way, it will taper from the base to apex. The result is that the proportions between the trunk and branches will be highly developed, with branches full of turns and twists.

Their traditional occupation is carpentry The great majority of Hindu sutradhars belong to the Vaishnava sect. Vishwakarma is regarded as their patron deity.  Origin  Sutradhar caste predominantly engaged in carpentry works The word Sutradhar literally means thread-holder. Sutra in sanskrit means thread (which is used to mark the course of a saw), and dhara means to hold. The names Sutar and Suthar are abbreviated versions of Sutrahadar. Sutradhars, according to legend, are the carpenters descended from Maya, son of Vishwakarma. From the Rigveda, Vishwakarma is the divine engineer of the universe. In the Skanda Purana he had five children ‚Äî Manu(child of Vishwakarma), Maya(child of Vishwakarma), Tvastar, Shilpi and Visvajna ‚Äî and these are believed by the Vishwakarma community to have been the forebears of their five sub-groups, being respectively the gotras (clans) of blacksmiths, carpenters, bell metalworkers (metal casters), stonemasons and goldsmiths. Together, these sons are known as Rathakar, or builders of Chariots. There is evidence that Sutradhars were performing other tasks besides carpentry in ancient times. A stanza from Chandimangal notes them puffing and frying rice, as well as painting. Agricultural tasks were historically done by castes of Austric origins, so the stanza may refer to a period of transition as the Sutradhar caste was forming and still performing other tasks. They were also engaged in making monuments, temples, palaces, chariots and sculpting rock structures. They are believed to have built the Konark Sun Temple, Jagannath Temples, and the terracotta temples of Bengal. Demography While some Sutradhars practice Shaktism, the vast majority are members of the Vaishnava sect. They worship Vishwakarma and offer sacrifices to him on Vishwakarma Day and Vasant Panchami. The Sutradhar caste is subdivided into a number of subcastes including Bardhamenya, Mandaranya, Khadipeda, Astakul, and Airy. The Bardhamenya, Mandaranya, and Astakul are best known as carpenters but are also known as painters, clay image makers, stone carvers as well as constructors of buildings and temples. The Khadipeda were essentially architects, known as designers of temples, palaces, mosques, and building. Sutradhars are also subdivided into various clans, or gotras. These gotras include Alishya, Sanilya, Kanakrishi, Sandilya, and Kashyap. All these clans are totemic. Common Sutradhar surnames include Dutta, Chanda, De, Pal, Sil, Kundu, Mena, Manna, Maharana, Rana, Bandra, Rakhsit, Sutradhar, Sutar, Bhandari, Fouzdar, Das, Kar, and Sharma. Fouzdar would appear to have a royal origin, while Sharma is also a surname of them.

Its aim was to dismantle the framework of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, that was suspended on 6 September 2017 by the Constitutional Court of Spain as breaching the 1978 Constitution. Different headquarters of the Generalitat de Catalunya were searched and 14 people were arrested, including high ranking administrative staff, and company CEO's involved in the preparation of the referendum. Simultaneously, several printing and media companies were searched looking for ballot papers and boxes. More than 140 websites were shut down by the Spanish justice and police. Crowds gathered around Catalan regional ministries to support those arrested and protest against the searches. About 40,000 demonstrators surrounded the Catalan economy department heeding a call made by pro-independence groups √ímnium Cultural and ANC. One vehicle of the Civil Guard was damaged. The autonomous police force of Catalonia, Mossos d'Esquadra, recognized that there was a risk situation. Jordi S√†nchez and Jordi Cuixart‚Äîleaders of ANC and √ímnium Cultural‚Äî and the Mossos d'Esquadra Major Josep Llu√≠s Trapero √Ålvarez have been accused of sedition, a felony regulated by the article 544 and subsequents of the Spanish Criminal Code, for allegedly encouraging protesters to hinder the Spanish police raids to dismantle the framework of the referendum. On 16 October 2017, S√†nchez and Cuixart were provisionally put into jail without bail pending the investigation. On 14 October 2019, the Spanish Supreme Court condemned S√†nchez and Cuixart to a nine-year sentence after considering them guilty of sedition.Catalan separatist leaders handed jail terms for independence bidSentencia del ‚Äòproc√©s‚Äô: penas de 9 a 13 a√±os para Junqueras y los otros l√≠deres por sedici√≥n y malversaci√≥n Amnesty International believes their detention and sentence constitutes a disproportionate restriction on his rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, and urges Spain to free them.  Background  The investigation started due a complaint presented by the far- right political party Vox and an anonymous complainant, in response to a claim from Catalan judge and politician Santiago Vidal assuring that preparations for the referendum were underway. The investigation was assigned to the trial court number 13 of Barcelona, which had a conservative judge, Ram√≠rez Sunyer, close to the General Council of the Judiciary. According to the defense, the assignment was against the rules and was done arbitrarily to get a hard anti- independence judge to investigate the case. On 9 September, Spanish Civil Guard raided the headquarters of the weekly newspaper El Vallenc for being allegedly linked to the preparation of the independence referendum, about 200 people gathered in front of the building to support the journalists being investigated. On the same day, the Civil Guard also raided the printing office Indugraf Offset in Constant√≠ searching for ballots and material related to the Catalan referendum. Over 45,000 notifications for the polling station members were confiscated on 19 September by the Civil Guard after raiding the offices of the posting service Unipost. Hundreds of protesters practiced nonviolent resistance sitting in front of the offices in order to block the access, delaying the action of the judicial committee for hours.  20 September  Following a judge's orders, on the morning of 20 September 2017 several units of the Spanish Civil Guard raided 41 locations, including: the headquarters of the Vice President of Catalonia, the regional ministries of economy, foreign affairs, social affairs and family, the tax agency of Catalonia, the consortium of open administration of Catalonia, the Catalan Institute of Finance, the dotCAT Foundation, private houses of Catalan government officials and one printing company. Spanish officers claimed to have seized 9.6 million ballot papers in the raids. During these raids the Spanish Civil Guard arrested 14 people, most of them high-ranking members from the Generalitat of Catalonia, but also CEOs of private companies or just administrative staff. After hours of watching it, officers of the National Police Corps circled the headquarters of the Popular Unity Candidacy party (CUP) at 1:00pm, in Casp street, Barcelona, but were prevented from searching inside by party members and supporters due to not having a court order. The party made several calls to the citizenship to \\"go to protect our headquarters\\" and organized a sit-in protest in order to block Spanish police access to their offices which gathered thousands of people. The police deployment lasted eight hours until they finally left without searching the building or arresting anyone. David Fern√†ndez, member of CUP, defined the intend to enter their headquarters without a court order as a \\"flagrant crime against fundamental, civil and political rights\\". On the same day, the Spanish government announced that they were sending two ships to Barcelona and one to Tarragona to allocate Spanish police reinforcements deployed from other places of Spain. The first ship to arrive in Barcelona was the Rhapsody, from an Italian shipping company, followed by the MS Moby Dada, also Italian. The ship that docked in Tarragona was named GNV Azzurra. The three ships had a capacity of 6,600. Days later, these reinforcements tried to prevent the referendum on independence, injuring over 900 voters and panic scenes that were broadcast on news stations worldwide.  Protests  Crowd in front of the Department of Economy after the arrests. As the searches began, crowds spontaneously gathered outside the buildings being raided by the Spanish Civil Guard; namely the headquarters of the Department of Economy, in Rambla Catalunya, and the Department of External Affairs, in Via Laietana. Some minutes later, √ímnium Cultural and ANC called for a mobilization to avoid demonstrators being prosecuted given that Spanish Citizen's Security Law sets very high penalties for unauthorized demonstrations. Civil pro-independence organizations called for \\"peaceful resistance\\" in front of some of the buildings being searched. The Mayor of Barcelona Ada Colau also called all citizens to take the streets in protest for the raids. Soon after people started gathering in front of the Economy Department, crowds forced the closure of the Gran Via. According to several sources, at some moment there were more than 40,000 people in the demonstration in front of the Catalan economy department. In the afternoon, various volunteers offered food and water to demonstrators. Several concerts were held in the junction between Rambla de Catalunya and Gran Via, like Companyia El√®ctrica Dharma and Judit Neddermann as well as castells. Even though the police operations were not notified in advance to the autonomous police force of Catalonia, Mossos d'Esquadra, as soon as people started gathering around the Catalan economy department, Civil Guard requested the intervention of Mossos. The Civil Guard agents involved in the raid made 6 calls for help to Mossos during the day. The first request for help was at 9:14 am with the subject: \\"Urgent - Request for support to Mossos\\" with the goal to force people to move 40 meters away from the building. Mossos did not intervene alleging that might cause public disorders and that the demonstration was being peaceful and authorized. Instead, ANC volunteers created a human corridor so the access to the building would not get blocked. Workers of the Department of Economy hung Catalan and European Union flags in the balconies of the building as long as the raid lasted. Mossos alleged they were not notified in advance about the raids, so they couldn't prepare a police operation to keep demonstrators far from the building. At midday, the Civil Guard notified Mossos they would end the registries around 20.15, but later stated they would be delayed for hours due to computer problems. Mossos considered there was a situation of risk, but discarded using crowd-controls units until later in the night when most demonstrators already left. According to the court clerk, she remained trapped until midnight inside the building and had to flee by the roof terrace, while several agents were trapped throughout the night as demonstrators shouted outside \\"You won't get out!\\" and \\"They shall not pass\\". The solution to leave through the roof terrace of the neighbouring building was proposed by Mossos after the court clerk rejected to use the human corridor created by the police. Civil Guard stayed inside the building until the demonstration was called off and Mossos cleared the zone, so they could get access to the three cars that were parked in front of the Catalan economy department. Those cars were damaged by journalists in the morning and later vandalized up by demonstrators. According to the Civil Guard, the damages in the vehicles (3 Nissan Patrol) accounted for 135,632 ‚Ç¨. Civil Guard officers left unguarded weapons and ammunition inside the cars, which were left with the doors unlocked and were later surrounded by demonstrators. The Mossos were not informed that the cars contained weapons until the afternoon, at that point, the Mossos used a helicopter to verify that no demonstrator entered inside the cars. Eventually, the leaders of ANC and √ímnium, Jordi S√†nchez and Jordi Cuixart, were notified there were weapons inside the cars too. At that point, ANC volunteers expanded the human corridor and left the cars inside the corridor, so demonstrators had no access to them. An investigation from the newspaper El M√≥n in 2019, reported that none of the Civil Guard officers that left unguarded weapons inside the cars was sanctioned by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior. Jordi S√†nchez and Jordi Cuixart ‚Äîleaders of ANC and √ímnium Cultural‚Äî and the Mossos d'Esquadra Major Josep Llu√≠s Trapero √Ålvarez have been accused of sedition, a felony regulated by the article 544 and subsequents of the Spanish Criminal Code, for allegedly encouraging protesters to hinder the Spanish police raids to dismantle the framework of the referendum. S√†nchez and Cuixart have been provisionally put into jail without bail pending the investigation. Besides the demonstration in Barcelona, multiple protests took place in other cities across Catalonia; including cacerolazo during the night. Several Spanish cities also organised demonstrations against the police operations. In Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona an audience at the representation of Il Viaggio a Reims sang the Catalan anthem, Els Segadors, and shouted pro-Catalan independence slogans.  Reactions  Dozens of Catalan organizations and entities condemned the jailing of Catalan officials and made calls to respect \\"democracy and freedom of speech\\" in Catalonia and asked all citizens to \\"defend Catalan institutions\\". Those entities included all Catalan public universities (UB, UAB, UdG, UPF, UdL, URV, UPC, UOC), the biggest Catalan workers and students unions including CCOO and UGT, sport clubs like FC Barcelona and Girona FC, more than 20 professional associations, the Confederation of Neighborhood Associations of Catalonia, NGO's like Fundipau, music festivals like Primavera Sound and cultural organizations like Fundaci√≥ Antoni T√†pies. Carles Puigdemont, President of Catalonia, described the raids as a \\"de facto suspension of Catalonia's self-rule\\". Ada Colau, Mayor of Barcelona, called the raids \\"a democratic scandal\\". Xavier Dom√®nech, from En Com√∫ Podem expressed \\"all red lines have been crossed\\". Pablo Iglesias, leader of Spanish Podemos, defined the arrested officials as \\"political prisoners\\". Dimitrios Papadimoulis MEP considered the situation was a \\"very worrying drift\\" for Spain. M√≥nica Oltra, co-spokesperson of Valencian Comprom√≠s, defined it as \\"forbidding acts of freedom of expression\\". That day, En Com√∫ Podem, ERC and PDeCAT walked out from Spanish Congress as a protest against the police operation. File:Manifestation in favor of the right to decide in Catalonia.jpgDemonstration in front of the Department of Economy in Barcelona File:20S Berga1.jpgDemonstration in Berga File:Mani 20S Val√®ncia (5).jpgDemonstration in Val√®ncia  21 September  On 21 September 2017, the President of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, publicly announced on Twitter the referendum information webpage had been re-uploaded and gave polling station information and directions. The previous webpage shut down six days after launching, after being declared illegal in court. Demonstration on 21 September 2017 in front of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia in support of individuals arrested by during police raids. The Catalan National Assembly and √ímnium Cultural organised a demonstration in Passeig de Llu√≠s Companys in front of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia calling for the release of those, while carrying signs reading \\"Stop dictatorship\\" and \\"We want to vote\\". During the demonstrations several politicians and public figures spoke and asked the people to continue in permanent mobilisation to defend the institutions of Catalonia. On the same day, the stevedores and dockworkers of the Port of Barcelona and Port of Tarragona refused to work for the ships that housed the Spanish police after a trade union vote that morning. University students in some areas abandoned their classes and disrupted traffic on Avinguda Diagonal and joined demonstrations in front of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. In a separate protest by students traffic on Gran Via, at the old building of the University of Barcelona, was disrupted. Around 150 people chanting slogans in favour of the police operation or in favour of remaining part of Spain. In front of the headquarters of the Spanish Civil Guard in Passeig de Gr√†cia a demonstration of 150 people shouted slogans in favour of the police operation, in favour of remaining unified with Spain, or against the independence referendum. During the demonstration there were clashes with the Mossos d'Esquadra when the protesters tried to stop the traffic. An open letter from several members of all parties in the UK parliament expressed their concern \\"by the measures taken by the Spanish government to prevent the referendum\\". An additional open letter from over a hundred academics of law, human rights and related subjects from the UK and Ireland expressed the same level of concern about the fact \\"that the level of political repression in Catalonia is of a severity and arbitrary character not experienced since the Franco dictatorship\\". The Regional Council of Sardinia also unanimously approved a motion on 21 September 2017 expressing solidarity with Catalonia and offering to print and store the necessary ballots for the referendum while asking the international community to intervene and ensure that Catalans could vote and decide on their self-determination.  22 September  On Friday 22 September, Spanish State Attorney General's office filed a complaint for sedition against the leaders of Catalan National Assembly and √ímnium Cultural, Jordi S√†nchez and Jordi Cuixart, accused of having played central roles in orchestrating massive protests aimed at hindering Civil Guard activity. This offence can be punished with sentences of up to 15 years of prison. The investigating judge stated that the leaders did not call for \\"peaceful demonstration but to the protection of Catalan officials through 'massive citizens' mobilisations\\" and that Jordi S√†nchez, on top of a vehicle, encouraged the demonstrators with expressions such as \\"no one goes home, it will be a long and intense night\\". According to the judge the actions of S√†nchez and Cruixat are within the scope of sedition, a felony regulated by the article 544 and subsequents of the Spanish Criminal Code: Photo of the students occupying the historical building of the University of Barcelona. Footage from that night shows Cuixart and S√†nchez at 11pm calling off the protests, contradicting the part where the judicial order imprisoning them says that \\"they did not use at any time the control they had over the people to call off the demonstration they had summoned\\". Pro-referendum students from the University of Barcelona occupied the historical building of the university, which is currently used by the faculties of mathematics and philology. In Girona, Tarragona and Lleida there were more student demonstrations in defence of democracy organised by the local Universities. Later that day, the trial court number 13 finally released all the remaining politicians arrested on 20 September 2017. They were freed being charged with disobedience to the Constitutional Court, perverting the course of justice and embezzlement of public funds but were not accused of sedition. Even though they were released, due to a public prosecutor petition, they will have to appear before the court every week while the probe continues. Around 2,000 people were waiting outside and received them with slogans and chants. At 6pm a new demonstration in front of the High Court of Justice was organised to celebrate their release.  Digital censorship  In the days previous to the referendum, more than 140 websites were shut down by the Spanish justice and police, including the official one from the Catalan government with information about the referendum and dozens of clones made after the first one was blocked. The main site of the biggest civil organization which supports independence, Assemblea Nacional Catalana, was also blocked. In some cases, only a judiciary request was sent but in some others Guardia Civil was sent to major Spanish telecom operators offices, domain providers, the dotCat Foundation and Google, in this particular case to remove an app from Google Play which included information about the polling stations. This situation was defined as \\"censorship\\" by many and was denounced by Internet-related organizations from around the world including Internet Society, APC, EFF, The Tor Project and Xnet.  Accusations of sedition  Finally, on October 16 both Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S√†nchez were imprisoned accused of sedition and sent to Soto del Real Prison. Both Mossos d'Esquadra Major Josep Llu√≠s Trapero √Ålvarez and Barcelona Intendant Teresa Laplana Cocera were also charged with sedition because of the role played by the regional police.  Reactions  Amnesty International issued an official statement considering the charge of sedition and the preventive imprisonment \\"excessive\\" and called for their immediate release. On 7 March 2018, the High Commissioner of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reminded Spanish authorities that \\"pre-trial detention should be considered a measure of last resort\\" in reference, between others, to Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S√†nchez. In July 2018, several international personalities including Jody Williams, Noam Chomsky, Angela Davis, Ben Emmerson, Bill Shipsey and Mart√≠n Caparr√≥s joined in a video produced by √ímnium and demanded the release of the Catalan leaders. On 8 August 2018, PEN International made another statement asking Spanish authorities to release Cuixart and S√†nchez and considered their detentions to be \\"an excessive and disproportionate restriction on their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly\\". The World Organisation Against Torture sent an open letter to the President of the Government of Spain Pedro S√°nchez as well as the Spanish Attorney General and Spanish Ombudsman on 22 November 2018 demanding the end of the \\"arbitrary pre-trial detention and judicial harassment of Jordi Cuixart and Jordi S√†nchez\\" and concluded \\"OMCT considers that the charges against them are unfounded and must therefore be dropped.\\" After S√†nchez and Cuixart were sentenced to a nine-year sentence, Amnesty International reiterated his petition to immediately release them and denounced that the \\"vague\\" and \\"overly broad\\" interpretation of sedition done by the Spanish Supreme Court could have negative effects on the freedom of protest in Spain.

C: (2016) Veganisms. In Castricano, J. & Simonsen, R. R. Critical Perspectives on Veganism. Palgrave Macmillan. p. 25 It is in the 21st century that it began to frame the phenomenon in the sociological sphere and makes its appearance \\"vegaphobia\\". In 2007, a survey called \\"Vegaphobia: disproportionate talk about veganism in British national newspapers\\" took place in the United Kingdom, which examined 397 articles containing the terms \\"vegan\\", \\"vegans\\" and \\"veganism\\". The researchers found that 74.3% of the items are classified as \\"negatives\\"; 20.2% \\"neutral\\" and only 5.5% \\"positive\\". Negative items were in order of frequency: ridiculing veganism; characterize veganism as asceticism; affirming that veganism is difficult or impossible to sustain; describe veganism as a fashion; portray vegans as sentimentalists; defining vegans as hostile. Laura Wright claims that media organisations and wider discourse routinely mischaracterise vegan diets and highlights situations where media outlets report the death of children from a 'vegan diet' rather than the neglect that was the actual cause. However, Christophe Tra√Øni writes that some vegan activists may present themselves \\"as members of an oppressed minority rebelling against 'vegephobia. However, the application of the term \\"vegaphobia\\"‚Äîand the extent to which it can be compared to other forms of discrimination‚Äîremains a divisive issue, with Sophie Wilkinson of Grazia opining that \\"...discrimination is about being treated differently for who you are, not for what you choose to do.\\" and that discrimination against vegans (unlike sexism, racism, homophobia, etc.) doesn't tend to go beyond the level of microaggressions. At the 2013 International Animal Rights Conference, actress and producer Jola Cora, discussed the topic in a presentation called \\"Vegaphobia, what is it?\\" In 2018, a survey of British and American vegans from the weight-loss application Lifesum found eight out of ten respondents to have experienced some form of anti-vegan prejudice.

She is a member of the Academy of Russian Television and a laureate of TEFI ‚Äî Russian National TV award.  Biography   Early years, education  Larisa Sinelshchikova was born on February 10, 1963 in the village of Psebay in Mostovsky District in Krasnodar Krai. After finishing secondary school #4 in 1979, she left for Moscow and entered the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts (GITIS). She graduated with a specialty of ‚Äòdirector‚Äô in 1984  TV-6 and VID  From 1993 to 1998, Larisa Sinelshchikova held the post of vice-president of the TV-6 channel, and from 1994 she was the general director of the TV-6 Media agency, which is the first Russian television advertising sales agency. In 1998, at Alexander Lyubimov‚Äôs invitation, she took the position of general director of VID television company, a major supplier of television programs and shows for ORT channel (Channel One Russia). In 2000 Sinelshchikova left the position of general director and headed the board of directors of VID and held this position until 2007. In 2001 Sinelshchikova became a member of the Academy of Russian Television.  Red Square  In July 2007 Sinelshchikova founded her own television company, Red Square, which became Russia's first full-cycle television holding company, which was engaged in the production of television programs, technical support of filming, copyright distribution, advertising, sponsorship contracts, Internet projects and projects in the field of show business. The company worked mainly with Channel One and produced the most important and top-rated projects for it. Red Square was also responsible for filming the 54th Eurovision Song Contest, which was held in Moscow in 2009. By the beginning of 2010, Red Square became the largest producer of television content in Russia. According to KVG Research, in 2012 there were 58 shows, television films and series produced by Red Square, which went on air, and that made one tenth of the total premiere time of Russian television - a quarter more than the nearest competitor. Many projects of Red Square were shown to the evening prime time of Channel One. Among them are The Voice, Kto khochet stat' millionerom? (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?), Minuta slavy (Minute of Glory), Let's Get Married, Fashion Verdict, Posner and others. According to Interfax, the revenue of Red Square in 2013 amounted to 4.64 billion rubles, with 2.63 billion of net profit. According to Vedomosti newspaper, Sinelshchikova had been planning to sell Red Square since 2012. In mid-2013, Red Square was joined by a number of subsidiaries of legal entities. In April 2014 it became known that Sinelshchikova agreed to sell 51% of registered capital of the Red Square companies to Arkady Rotenberg. Andrei Baturin, the official representative of the businessman, explained that Rotenberg‚Äôs interest in the company is connected to the growing importance of content for modern media and the need to rely on ‚Äòthe first and the best‚Äô. The parties did not disclose the terms of the transaction, but they noted that the company was evaluated higher than the market. It was known before that Sinelshchikova directly owned small shares in the companies that made up Red Square, while the main ones were owned by offshore structures. During the transaction, the ownership structure of the television company was disclosed for the first time, and Sinelshchikova was named the ultimate beneficiary of all the companies. With the new shareholder, personnel changes took place in the management of Red Square, and the company itself began to cooperate with VGTRK, the main competitor of Channel One. Vedomosti, referring to a high- ranking employee of Channel One, noted that this led to a remarkable alienation between the TV channel and the TV company. In July 2015, during the second transaction, Rotenberg bought the remaining 49% of the company from Sinelshchikova and became the only owner of Red Square.  First Music Publishing  In 2015, after the sale of Red Square, Sinelshchikova agreed to withdraw from the First Music Publishing, in which she directly owned a share of 60%, and before that - through a share in the recording studio REAL Records. 1MP was founded in 2003, and by the mid-2010s it became one of the largest music publishers in the country. In 2014 the 1MP revenue amounted to 403 mln rubles with 54 mln of net profit. The deal became known in September 2016. Sinelshchikova‚Äôs share was distributed among producers Viktor Drobysh, Vladimir Dubovitsky, Igor Matvienko, Konstantin Meladze and Maxim Fadeyev, with whom she had worked for many years. The amount of the agreement was not disclosed.

Early life Before Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment, there was a kingdom situated near Gisa Gi Yi, now known as Zinkyaik Mountain. The king of this region was Tissa Dama Gyaik (and his queen was Thi Yi Kappar Dawi. They ruled the kingdom well, therefore it was calm, rich, and well-developed. The pair had two sons, who had been mentioned before in prophecy by wise men. The oldest son resembled his father in build and appearance. A Brahman had prophesied to King Tissa Dama Yaza that the prince would \\"have the traits of a moral principles, good character, politeness, cleverness, and great skill.\\" When the king heard this, he was pleased and gave the prince the name Tissa Kumaya, after himself. When the youngest son was born, he was a beautiful child. On both of the soles of his feet, he had markings that looked like lions. So, the king named him Thiha Kumaya. The two princes loved each other very much. They were raised with access to every kind of sensual pleasure and luxury.

Decision to become hermits When the brothers reached the ages of 23 and 21 years old, the eldest brother, Tissa Kumaya, who had strong moral principles, had mastered the skill in meditation of remorse. He realized that no being was free from suffering old age, pain, and death. He decided to retire to the forest and become a recluse. He met with his younger brother and discussed his plans for abdicating the throne. He asked his brother to assume the position of king instead of himself and to take care of their parents. The youngest brother decided instead to follow his brother into the forest and also live as a hermit. They agreed to wait for a suitable time to retire to the forest. When King Tissa Dama Yaza and Queen Thiyi Kappar Dawi reached old age, they decided to retire into meditation and give the throne to their eldest son and the royal title of Crown Prince to their youngest son. They gathered their lawmakers and made legal arrangements for their sons to assume their new positions. The princes denied their inheritances and asked permission to retreat to the jungle as hermits. They requested their parents' blessing many times. The king and queen did not think that their sons were suitable for forest life, since they had been raised in a palace. The two sons became depressed and would not eat. They became very thin. Finally, the king and queen relented and agreed to allow them to go into the forest. The princes were pleased and began to eat again. After a week, they went to the jungle in a grand procession followed by the king, queen, and public. A monastery was built where there was fresh water and natural food sources for them. This monastery was at the bottom of Zinkyaik Mountain. The two brothers stayed there and were then referred to as \\"Tissa Hermit\\" and \\"Thiha Hermit\\". Tissa and Thiha were not satisfied to stay together, since there was temptation to waste meditation time in conversing with each other. Therefore, Tissa decide to stay at Zinkyaik while Thiha decided to transfer to Mount Zwegabin, which could be seen from Zinkyaik Mountain. Finding the twin eggs Two twin brothers, the children of a weizza from the Himalayas and a naga (dragon) princess were abandoned by their mother as eggs on the western base of Zinkyaik Mountain, where there was an island not far from the beach. Tissa, while walking and meditating, found the eggs and carried them back to his monastery at Zinkyaik Mountain. That night, Tissa saw a signal light from Mount Zwegabin from his brother, Thiha. Thiha met Tissa and Tissa gave him one of the eggs. Thiha took one egg to Mount Zwegabin, and one remained with Tissa. Tissa's egg hatched first on top of Zinkyaik Mountain, and later, Thiha's egg on Mount Zwegabin. Tissa named the baby under his care Thuriaya Kumaya because he was born at sunrise. The youngest twin brother passed away at the age of ten due to smallpox. So, Thiha came to raise Thuriaya Kumaya together with Tissa at Zinkyaik Mountain. Tissa leaves Zinkyaik Mountain The hermits became well-known and the area surrounding the mountain became crowded. Therefore, Tissa moved away from Zinkyaik to Kyaikhtiyo Mountain to find seclusion once again. The area appealed to him because it was surrounded by fresh water, hills, valleys, mountain torrents, trees, fruits, flowers, and stones. He lived in the Hunter's Cave and lost touch with all of civilization, except Thuriaya Kumaya, who went to live with his adopted father and Thiha, who occasionally travelled to visit him. Tissa and Thuriaya Kumaya Tissa grew attached to his adopted son and taught him about strategies for ruling a kingdom when they were not meditating. Since Thuriaya Kumaya was born from the egg of a weizza and dragon, he was called the \\"Naga Weizza\\". Tissa began to worry about his adopted son being left alone in the jungle after his death. One Sabbath day, Indra Sakka, a Thagyarmin, asked Tissa why he looked concerned. Tissa replied that he was worried about his son. The Indra Sakka said that when he reached 21 years old, the boy would become the emperor of Thu Bina Nagaya City, which the Tha Gyarmin would create. Tissa was satisfied after that. Death of King Tissa Dama Yaza and move of kingdom When their sons, Tissa and Thiha, had left, King Tissa Dama Yaza and Queen Thi Yi Kuppar suffered greatly. Their mental and physical health deteriorated, and they became thin. The king finally succumbed to his grief in the Maha Era 110. There was no one to inherit the throne, so the court officials went to the hermits to notify them of their father's death and ask them to take over in his place. They replied that they disliked the thought of ruling even more in their old age than when they were young. They stated that they preferred the wealth of mediation and mind than the wealth of the kingdom. In their place, they offered their adopted son, Thuriaya Kumaya, who had been trained in courtly affairs. This pleased the court and was made to pass. The two hermits arrived back to their kingdom to cremate and bury their father's remains. They discussed the kingdom with the officials and whether to move the kingdom or stay in their current location. Indra Sakka arrived and suggested Thaton. Thus, the kingdom was moved to Thaton and Thuriaya Kumaya became the first king of Thaton. The Naga Weizza was given the title Tissa Dama Thiya Yazar. The arrival of the Buddha In the Tharthanar Era (111), Gautama Buddha arrived at Kaylartha Mountain, Thuwunna Bonmi. He stayed at a monastery built by King Tissa Dama Thiya Yazar. The Buddha preached sermons to the public for seven days. During that time, he became close with the Hermits Tissa and Thiha and the local hermit of Kaylartha Mountain. They requested that he leave behind some relic to be revered by the people in his place after he left to return home. Buddha agreed and gave six of his hairs to hermits from Kyaiktiyo, Zinkyaik (to Tissa), Mount Zwegabin (to Thiha), Kaylartha, Kuthaerayone and Melan. A pair of belu brothers from Kyaikhtisaung also received a hair. All the hermits and belus enshrined the hair in great stones.

This allows ferry commuters to choose between bus and train transportation modes to various destinations within Seberang Perai, as well as Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.  History  The Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal was constructed to replace Mitchell's Pier, which had been built at the start of the 20th century. In the past, Mitchell's Pier was the landing point for the cross-strait ferries that linked Butterworth with George Town. The present-day ferry terminal was named after the then Sultan of neighbouring Kedah, Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim.

It features previously unreleased or hard to find recordings originating from the early 90s to 2017, and as such features both current and former members of Glass Hammer. It is also the last release of the band with guitarist Kamran Alan Shikoh as band member. The album features six original songs which had never been released or performed before, a re- recording of a previous Glass Hammer song, three covers, two tracks previously released as part of little-known collaborative albums, and the recording of a live performance. All thirteen tracks are listed based on the year of their original recording.  Production  Glass Hammer announced Untold Tales on August 21, 2017, with a planned \\"fall 2017\\" release. The mastering process was about to be completed on August 25. Some of Untold Tales' songs date back to the band's beginnings; according to Steve Babb, he and co-bandleader and founder Fred Schendel realized they were \\"sitting on a hoard of unreleased material spanning the life of the band. We thought Glass Hammer‚Äôs twenty-fifth anniversary was a good time to release much of it.\\" The album's first track is a re-recording of \\"Shadows of the Past\\", the first track of the band's first album Journey of the Dunadan, originally released in 1993. This version was made by Schendel, originally as a part of a planned entire re-recording of the album, to celebrate the band's fifteenth anniversary. Although this new version of the album never came to be, Schendel had already completed the new version of the first track, using orchestral sounds that were not available to the band back in 1993. The song \\"Infusion\\" was originally released as a part of Love Changes, a 1995 collaborative album credited to \\"Tracy Cloud featuring Glass Hammer\\". Cloud was the first artist produced by Glass Hammer at their studio, Sound Resources; she was also featured as a backing vocalist on the Glass Hammer albums Perelandra and On to Evermore. Babb considers the sound of the song to be similar to Perelandras. \\"Identity Principle\\", which Babb called \\"one of our best epics\\", was originally recorded in the \\"early 90s\\" for an abandoned project, featuring Walter Moore on vocals. According to Babb, the song had \\"some sonic issues\\" in its finale, and the band was never quite satisfied with the mixing. A new ending was written and recorded for Untold Tales, while the rest of the song consists of the original recording. Babb \\"literally found [the recording] hiding on a backup drive\\". The album features two cover songs. The first, \\"Hold Your Head Up\\" (originally by Argent), was first performed by Glass Hammer in 1996 during the festival Progscape. Babb estimates that the studio version was recorded \\"around that time, probably in 1997\\". The other cover is \\"It's All Too Much\\" (originally by The Beatles, although this version was also inspired by Steve Hillage's cover in his 1976 album L), which was recorded in 2009 during the sessions for Three Cheers for the Broken-Hearted, and performed \\"as an encore piece for a few live shows\\". For Untold Tales, Glass Hammer replaced their original recording's pipe organ with a Hammond organ, and created a new bass line. \\"Babb's Bach\\" is a recording from 2008 in which Babb performs a re-arranged instrumental version of an excerpt of the 1731 church cantata Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140 by Johann Sebastian Bach, namely the fourth movement, Zion h√∂rt die W√§chter singen. He was inspired to record the song by Wendy Carlos' 1968 album Switched-On Bach, which was Babb's introduction to synthesizer. The sixth track, \\"And Then She Sighed\\", was recorded in 2009 for a cancelled J. R. R. Tolkien-themed album. It features singer Laura Lindstrom Davis, who appeared on previous Glass Hammer works, including 2005's The Inconsolable Secret. \\"Eiger Dreams\\" served as the opening track of Glass Hammer's 2008 live album Live at the Tivoli, but its studio recording produced the same year had never been released. The title is a reference to the eponymous book by Jon Krakauer. Babb stated that the track \\"Troll\\" was conceived around 2008 and was \\"inspired by some of the posts we've seen through the years on certain prog-rock websites\\", referring to internet trolling. The instrumental \\"A Grain of Sand\\" was written by guitarist Kamran Alan Shikoh and recorded in 2010 as a possible track for If. Although it was not ultimately featured, the vocals by Jon Davison recorded for the track were ultimately used in \\"If the Stars\\". \\"Cool Air\\", a song based on the eponymous short story by H. P. Lovecraft and also featuring Davison, was originally released as a part of The Stories of H.P. Lovecraft, a 2012 collaborative album by different artists. It was recorded that year, from lyrics by Babb and music by Schendel. \\"The Impulsive Type\\" features \\"live drum tracks\\" performed by Neil Peart of Rush, originally recorded for the sound library Sonic Reality. After being asked to by Sonic Reality founder Dave Kerzner, Glass Hammer wrote and recorded a song based on this pre-existing drum track, although the resulting song had ultimately been left unreleased. Babb stated about the song \\"It is not possible to use [Peart's] drums and have it not sound like Rush.\\" \\"No Man‚Äôs Land Live\\" was recorded on May 6, 2017 during a concert at Camp House in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where the band performed the album Valkyrie in its entirety.

It was discovered by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1752. It is located approximately 3,700 light years away from Earth.  Observation history  IC 2488 was discovered by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille on January 25, 1752, during his trip to South Africa. He added it to his catalogue as Lacaille III.4. The cluster was also observed by James Dunlop in 1826. He described it as \\"a faint cluster of [faint] stars of mixed magnitudes, with two or three stars pretty bright stars in it\\" and listed it as number 330 in his catalogue. He also noted that it could be 485 Argus, described by Bode. John Louis Emil Dreyer added it in 1908 in the Second Index Catalogue. For the catalogue, Dreyer used the coordinates obtained by Solon Bailey, who used photographic plates with the 24 inches Bruce telescope in Arequipa.  Observation  IC 2488 lies 30 arcminutes west of N Velorum, a 3rd magnitude star located near the False Cross asterism. Stephen James O'Meara estimates the overall apparent magnitude of the cluster to be 6.0. The cluster is coarse. The cluster can be spotted with 7x50 binoculars and with a 4 inches telescope the cluster can be resolved in 30 stars in a northwest-southeast direction. The planetary nebula RCW 44 (also known as WRAY 17-31 or ESO 166-21) lies 51 arcminutes to northeast and is probably not related with the cluster. The brightest members of the cluster are of 10th magnitude.  Characteristics  IC 2488 is an intermediate- richness, intermediate-brightness, detached cluster with Trumpler class II2m. There are 372 probable member stars within the angular radius of the cluster and 115 within the central part of the cluster. The tidal radius of the cluster is 9.0 - 11.6 parsecs (29 - 38 light years) and represents the average outer limit of IC 2488, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. The core of the cluster is estimated to be 9.3 light years across. Three blue stragglers have been detected in the cluster and at least three red giants are indisputable members of the cluster, one of which being a spectroscopic binary star.

The project was started in 2013 by Dave Hakkens and is now in its fourth iteration. It relies on a series of machines and tools which grind, melt, and inject recycled plastic, allowing for the creation of new products out of recycled plastic on a small scale.  History  In 2012, Dave Hakkens started working on Precious Plastic as a part of his studies at the Design Academy in Eindhoven. The project was released in 2013 as Version 1.0. The work on version 2 was started in 2015 and was released in March 2016. In 2016, Precious Plastic also created a marketplace called Bazar for selling machines and products targeted to DIY designers to recycle plastic. The team started working on version 3.0 from early 2017 and was launched in October 2017. In May 2018, Precious Plastic received the Famae award of ‚Ç¨300,000 to further develop the project. The city of Eindhoven also provided them a big workspace free of charge. In October 2018, Precious Plastic project officially opened its doors at the VDMA building in Eindhoven. The work on Version 4.0 was started in September 2018. In 2019 Hakkens and Precious Plastic were involved in disagreement over whether to burn or recycle plastics collected from the oceans. The version 4, which includes business models and starter kits for creating recycling systems, was announced in January 2020. Description Precious Plastic is an open hardware plastic recycling project and is a type of open source digital commons project. It relies on a series of machines and tools which grind, melt, and inject recycled plastic, allowing for the creation of new products out of recycled plastic on a small scale. The project allows individual consumers to set up \\"their own miniature recycling company\\". The project is composed of more than 40,000 people in over 400 work spaces, either remotely or on site in the Netherlands. All the information produced by the project such as codes, drawings, and source materials are available for free online under the Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike International 4.0 license.  Related projects  Precious Plastic Fiji was formed in 2017 as a NGO dedicated to eliminating plastic waste. In 2018 after a workshop in China, a company, Plastplan, grew out of the Precious Plastic project in Iceland to promote an alternative to shipping plastic to Sweden to be burned for electricity. In Hawaii in 2019, Puna Precious Plastic, with more than 1,000 members as a part of the Precious Plastic worldwide movement, collected about 1,000 pounds, which it planned to sort, shred and melt into plastic bricks and lumber for construction. In Thailand, Precious Plastic Bangkok collects plastic bottle caps to shred, melt, and reshape into new products, including monk's robes. With a grant from Dane County Arts and partnered with Community GroundWorks, the nonprofit that oversees Troy Kids‚Äô Garden, and hackerspace Sector 67, a branch of Precious Plastic was launched in Madison, Wisconsin.  University involvement  In 2018, a group called Precious Plastic Texas was formed by students at the University of Texas after learning about what was being done in Thailand. In 2019 students in the Environmental Fellows Program's gateway seminar at DePauw University in Indiana began work on a Precious Plastic project, and received funding from the Joseph and Carol Danks Centers Council Fund for Multidisciplinary Projects. The project will continue in a gateway seminar and three art classes, and they may add an off-campus trip to a Precious Plastic site. In Australia, UNSW business school students, working closely with Precious Plastic, won the 2019 Big Idea competition in the postgraduate category with their start-up idea called Closed Loop ‚Äì a local-level plastic waste recycling business.

Taxonomy The holotype of Agorophius pygmaeus, MCZ 8761, was first mentioned in an 1848 report on the geology of South Carolina by Michael Tuomey.M. Tuomey. 1848. Report on the Geology of South Carolina 1-293. It was eventually described as Zeuglodon pygmaeus by Johannes Peter M√ºller in 1849.J. Muller. 1849. Uber die fossilen Reste der Zeuglodonten von Nordamerica 1-38. Louis Agassiz coined the name Phocodon holmesii for the same specimen, classifying it as an odontocete. Later authors considered Zeuglodon pygmaeus a species of either Dorudon or Squalodon,E. D. Cope. 1868. [Extinct Cetacea from the Miocene bed of Maryland]. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences Philadelphia 20(3):159-160.J. Leidy. 1869. The extinct mammalian fauna of Dakota and Nebraska, including an account of some allied forms from other localities, together with a synopsis of the mammalian remains of North America. Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia 2:1-472. and in 1895 Edward Drinker Cope eventually recognized it as being a distinct genus, which he named Agorophius.E. D. Cope. 1895. Fourth contribution to the marine fauna of the Miocene Period of the United States. Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 34:135-155. Although the skull is lost and the tooth is the only extant part of MCZ 8761, Fordyce (1981) was able to diagnose Agorophius based on existing descriptions of the skull by Muller, Cope, and Agassiz.R. E. Fordyce. 1981. Systematics of the odontocete whale Agorophius pygmaeus and the Family Agorophiidae (Mammalia: Cetacea). Journal of Paleontology 55(5):1028-1045. New specimens from the Ashley Formation and Chandler Bridge Formation have provided new data on Agorophius, distinguishing it from other Oligocene odontocetes from the US Eastern Seaboard by the condition of its intertemporal condition.S. Godfrey, M. D. Uhen, J. E. Osborne and L. E. Edwards. 2016. A new specimen of Agorophius pygmaeus (Agorophiidae, Odontoceti, Cetacea) from the early Oligocene Ashley Formation of South Carolina, USA. Journal of Paleontology 90(1):154-169. Classification Agorophius is the type genus of Agorophiidae, named by Abel in 1914. A number of archaic odontocetes (e.g. Archaeodelphis, Microzeuglodon, and Xenorophus) were previously assigned to this family, but are now recognized as belonging to distinct families (Xenorophidae).
