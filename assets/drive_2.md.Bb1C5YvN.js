The Morris Baronetcy, of Clasemont in the County of Glamorgan, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 12 May 1806 for the copper and coal magnate, John Morris. The 1st baronet had founded Morriston, the industrial suburb of Swansea, which was overlooked by the family seat at Clasemont. This residence was later knocked down and the stones were incorporated into a new family house at Sketty Park. Various lines died out, and the baronetcy eventually came to the 8th baronet, George Lockwood Morris, who succeeded at the age of 88, three months before his death. The 8th baronet had been a local industrialist and a Welsh international rugby player.

Vanity Fair, 16 August 1879 The Sassoon baronetcy of Kensington Gore was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 22 March 1890 for the Anglo-Iraqi businessman Albert (formerly Abdullah) Sassoon, whose family hailed from Baghdad. The second Baronet, Sir Edward Sassoon, represented Hythe as a Liberal Unionist Party Member of Parliament from May 1899 to his death in 1912. The third Baronet, Sir Philip Sassoon, was a Conservative British politician, art collector and social host, who represented Hythe in the House of Commons from 1912. He served as Under- Secretary of State for Air from 1924 to 1929 and again from 1931 to 1937, and First Commissioner of Public Works in 1937. He was appointed Privy Councillor in 1929. On his death in 1939, the baronetcy became extinct. The Sassoon baronetcy of Bombay was created on 9 February 1909 for Sir Albert's nephew, Jacob Elias Sassoon. He had no children, so a special remainder enabled his younger brother to inherit. The third Baronet was also childless, thus the title became extinct upon his death in 1961. The special remainder is as follows: The special remainder to the baronetcy of Sassoon created in 1909 From the \\"London Gazette\\" of 2 February 1909 (issue 28220, page 826):- 'The King has been pleased to give directions for the preparation of a Warrant for His Majesty's Royal Sign Manual, authorizing Letters Patent to be passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, conferring the dignity of a Baronet of the said United Kingdom upon Jacob Elias Sassoon, of the City of Bombay, in the Empire of India, Esquire, and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten, with remainder to Edward Elias Sassoon, of Grosvenor-place, in the City of Westminster, Esquire, and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten.'

The creative nucleus of the project comprised vocalist and composer Daniel Vahnke and keyboardist Victor Wulf. Daniel Vahnke was primarily influenced by 20th-century classical and avant-garde music, whereas Wulf drew from new age, ambient and synth-driven pop music. Their work also dabbled in big band, bebop, musique concr√®te, industrial, electro, Indian classical and Greek music. Vampire Rodents debuted with War Music (1991), an album that showcased their knack for dark humor and experimentation with the pop and industrial music format. Premonition (1992), recorded with violinist and cellist Andrea Akastia, revealed the band's artistic ambitious and interest in electroacoustic and ambient music. Considered by some to be the group's magnum opus, Lullaby Land (1993) further expanded the sound with the inclusion of additional musicians, house beats, swing rhythms and world music. In 1993 Akastia and Wulf ceased to make direct contributions to Vampire Rodents and it became Vahnke's solo project, although he continued to utilize music his former bandmates had recorded previous to their departure. Vampire Rodents embraced an electro-industrial sound informed by orchestral music on Clockseed (1995) with the help of producer Chase and the contributions of numerous musicians already established in the 90s industrial rock scene. The final album, Gravity's Rim (1996), returned to the more aggressive and sardonic nature of past work while emphasizing dense string and horn arrangements backed by drum machine rhythms. Vampire Rodents' last recodings were made in 1996 when Vahnke was preparing the follow-up to Gravity's Rim. Legal issues with Fifth Colvmn Records unexpectedly halted activity and the project was put on hiatus. After over a decade of inactivity, Daniel Vahnke officially announced his musical retirement and the project's abandonment in 2009. In 2016, Vahnke established an official YouTube page titled Rodentia Productions and began issuing unreleased material with the suggestion that it would be made available for purchase. On November 11, 2017, Vampire Rodents' sixth album, Noises in the Wall, was issued digitally on their official Bandcamp page. History =Early years in Toronto (1987‚Äì89)= Composers Daniel Vahnke and Victor Wulf met while studying anthropology at the university of Toronto. Victor had been composing film music under pseudonyms since 1977 and was composing experimental pop track with samplers during the 80s. Daniel had been working on player piano pieces based on Chinese character stroke analysis since 1986. They began collaborating in 1987 and composed several independent films scores together. In June 1989, they began a project that incorporated elements of industrial rock and sound collage, which was conceived as a form of self-entertainment and as a way to play a joke on the music industry. They named the project Vampire Rodents after an animal skull with two large incisors that Vahnke discovered on an Anthropological dig in Arizona. = War Music and move to Arizona (1989‚Äì90)= By 1989, the duo had relocated to Phoenix, Arizona and enlisted the aid of Karl Geist on bass guitar and keyboards, Ivan Koci on guitar and Jing Laoshu on percussion. Recording for War Music was completed in January 1990. Vahnke chose to compose and record under an alias, and was credited as Anton Rathausen on every Vampire Rodent release. He would use the alias when being interviewed and would ask that the interviewer address Vahnke and Rathausen as separate people. Like other industrial rock at the time, the compositions of War Music made heavy use of sampled movie and television dialogue. Because of this, coupled with Vahnke's vocal technique, publications drew comparisons between the Rodents' music and that of early Skinny Puppy. The album also received attention for the lyrics, which utilized dark humor to sardonically critique Western culture. = Premonition and experimental phase (1990‚Äì92) = Geist left the band after the release of War Music, opting to seek employment with the Bristol-based label Words of Warning. Vahnke and Wulf realized the artistic merit of their project and began moving away from the mock industrial rock of War Music to draw inspiration from electroacoustic and ambient music. In 1991 the duo issued a thirty-minute cassette tape titled Premonition, which would serve as the foundation for their second full-length album. Premonition was expanded and completed in 1992 with violinist and cellist Andrea Akastia. The album garnered further praise from critics and the band began to receive wider notice, with tracks such as \\"Sitio\\" receiving airplay on the college radio stations. = Lullaby Land and critical acclaim (1992‚Äì93) = Premonition caught the attention of industrial music label Re-Constriction Records , who adopted the band into its roster. Lullaby Land was released in 1993 and marked a musical maturity for Vampire Rodents. The music boasted house beats, swing rhythms and world music influences while continuing to explore avant-garde and industrial music. It also marked the first time Vampire Rodents collaborated with guest musicians, utilizing the singing talents of Dan Grotta of Babyland; Jared Hendrickson of Chemlab; and Pall Jenkins of Three Mile Pilot. After the album's release, Akastia and Wulf scaled back their involvement with Vampire Rodents to pursue other interests. Their final in-studio collaboration was the track \\"Lizardman\\", which was released on the Masked Beauty in a Sea of Sadness various artists compilation. Lullaby Land was well received by critics upon its release. Exclaim! called it their best work, saying \\"these folks can turn collage into counterpoint the way only masters of the avant-garde have done; Zappa comes to mind for those old enough to remember the delirious metamorphoses on Absolutely Free.\\" Gear credited the band with creating a cinematic experience with their music, saying they \\"want to create classic horror movies and are using music, not film, as their medium.\\" Much was also said concerning the eclecticism of the music, with RIP and i/e crediting the band for pushing the boundaries of industrial music, the latter saying \\"with no repeated chorus rhymes and musical riffs, they forge ahead, staying away from stale techno and industrial treachery\\" and that \\"nobody creates the different moods and emotional states that the Vampires create.\\" = Clockseed and mainstream sound (1992‚Äì95) = With Vampire Rodents essentially becoming his solo project, Vahnke decided to take the music in a different direction. He began moving away from the dissonant industrial sound that characterized his earlier work to focus on composing lush arrangements comprising clarinets, bassoons, trumpets, trombones, flutes, oboes and saxophones. The music became more dependent on dance beats and informed by electro and even hip hop music. 1995's Clockseed introduced this new sound, with heavy emphasis placed on dance beats and vocals. Guest involvement had been increased to feature a new vocalist on every song, with Vahnke providing vocals for only four of the twenty-two tracks. Because of this, the lyrics contain social commentary more typical of industrial rock and electronica and less of Vahnke's grotesque humor. In an interview with Under the Volcano, Vahnke explained the reasoning behind the collaborative process: \\"We've always felt that it was important to have as much vocal diversity as possible. Clockseed finally brings the whole concept together, thanks to all the great singers who volunteered their effort and ingenuity. Chase [head of Re-Constriction] was instrumental in orchestrating the whole process. We're continuing to work with nearly 25 vocalists and following a similar approach. I think the experimental \\"hands off\\" policy seems to bring excellent results. It gives us new challenges to create for these artists.\\" He further stated \\"We try to give a vocalist a challenging task. Often we intentionally offer a track totally unlike what the artist is used to working with.\\" Besides connecting Vahnke with the contributing artists, Chase also provided loops for the music. = Gravity's Rim and hiatus (1995‚Äì2016) = At the advice of Chase and Jared Hendrickson, Vahnke decided to continue issuing his work under Fifth Colvmn Records. In 1996, Gravity's Rim was released and marked a return to the more aggressive and sardonic nature of past work while emphasizing dense string and horn arrangements backed by drum machine rhythms. Returning collaborators included Maria Azevedo, Dave Creadeau, Mark Edwards, Jared Hendrickson and Boom chr Paige. The album also predominantly featured Spahn Ranch and future Black Tape for a Blue Girl vocalist Athan Maroulis, who contributed to four tracks. Vahnke was especially prolific at this point and was interested in touring the band and launching several musical projects across several genres. This included a new Vampire Rodents album, slated for release in 1997. It was intended to be an entirely instrumental double disc album titled Noises in the Wall and would have comprised music recorded between 1993 and 1996. A re-imagining of Franz Schubert's Piano Trio No. 2, op. 100, D. 929 that was recorded for the album appeared on a Cleopatra Records compilation and five tracks that would have been part of the first disc were made available through the band's official Myspace page in January 2008. Plans to remaster and re-issue the entire Rodent catalog were also made. Vahnke was unable to find a record label to issue his work and was lacked the means necessary to release compositions himself. In 2002, he had expressed his desire to establish an mpg. site to make his work accessible to the public. Vahnke and officially announced his retirement from music in 2009. He mentioned in an interview that he had in his possession three hours of completed Vampire Rodents tracks as well as another three hours of other compositions that he has been unable to find an outlet for. =Hiatus and Project Revival (2016‚Äìpresent)= In 2016, Vahnke established official YouTube and Facebook pages that serve as outlets for unreleased compositions, including Vampire Rodents compositions. An abridged version of Noises in the Wall as well as \\"Smartass\\", the intended final track of Gravity's Rim, have been made available to the public for the first time since they were recorded. In 2017, the band started its official bandcamp page and began digitally issuing their back catalog along with unreleased material. Vampire Rodents' sixth album Noises in the Wall was officially released for the first time on November 11, 2017. Ostensibly a double album, Noises in the Wall is the band's longest release to date and, in the spirit of Vahnke's Ether Bunny project, is Vampire Rodents' only entirely instrumental album. The album well received critically, with reviewer's praising the wide scope of musical genres and styles. The ten part suite \\"Zombie Dolls\\", the frantic industrial collage of \\"Good Humour\\", the eight-minute composition \\"Cyborghostsex\\", the electroacoustic \\"Itume\\" and Vahnke's interpretation of Schubert's \\"Piano Trio No. 2\\" were referenced as being among the album's high points. Musical style =Vocals and lyrics= Maria Azevedo of Battery provided vocals for several songs on Clockseed and Gravity's Rim. Based on A Modest Proposal, \\"Abortion Clinic Deli\\" is one of their more raunchy songs, with lyrics championing the consuming of aborted fetuses for both protein and pleasure. Songs like \\"Dumme Weisse Menschen\\", which translates to \\"stupid white people\\", critique of Western culture while \\"Tatoo\\" is critical of hollow vogues. The collaborating artists who contributed the vocals to songs on Lullaby Land, Clockseed and Gravity's Rim also penned their own lyrics. For example, Jared Hendrickson's \\"Low Orbit\\" is about two of his deceased friends appearing to him in his sleep and \\"Revisioned\\" by Sounds of Mass Production concerns systemic oppression at the hands of the government and establishment. =Composition technique= The music of Vampire Rodents is entirely created by sampled music. Vahnke takes sections of previously recorded improvised or composed music and edits, notates and catalogues it in his sample database for later use. Shying away from using modern or high-end equipment, Vahnke prefers utilizing two Roland S-50s and a Commodore 64 for sequencing the samples. He usually begins composing by structuring the piece with drum beats, the percussion is mostly structured around several interlocking loops. The melodic content enters the picture secondly, with the sampled sections sequenced in order of instrumental dominance. Vahnke previously worked in modern classical music but became frustrated because, \\"Most music in your head cannot be realized by instruments because of the octave's twelve-interval restrictions.\\" More in keeping with real sounds, quarter tones expand the piano's octave from 12 to 28 keys. Vahnke felt sampling allowed more freedom when composing his pieces. Not intended for replication in a live setting, Vahnke constructed sample-based pieces on linear time graphs in a manner similar to Conlon Nancarrow's player-piano roll compositions. Other projects Besides Vampire Rodents, both Daniel Vahnke and Victor Wulf have been involved in separate musical projects. After Wulf parted from the band in 1993, after which he began composing and releasing solo work under the name Dilate. Influenced by ambient and new-age music, Dilate released two albums, Cyclos in 1996 and Octagon the following year. Both were issued by Hypnotic Records, a sublabel of Cleopatra Records, and mostly well received by critics. Vahnke began writing and recording music for his big band-influenced project Ether Bunny in 1993. Ether Bunny's debut studio album, titled Papa Woody, was released on Fifth Colvmn Records in 1996. Vahnke has pointed to Papa Woody as containing the music he is most proud of and he intended to follow up that release with a second album titled Toy Box, which was eventually released in 2017 as Attention Please. In the years between the release of Gravity's Rim and his retirement from music, Vahnke composed for several composition projects with the intention of collaborating with artists he had work with previously. This included an ambient music album called Obsidian with Maria Azevedo and her band Battery, an adult contemporary pop music oriented project with Athan Maroulis called Alchemia and a collaboration with vocalist Eric Powell of 16Volt called Pillow. An album titled Axon Tremolo, collecting music that was originally recorded for Alchemia, made its debut on Vahnke's official Bandcamp. The album ElevatorMan, a collaboration between Daniel Vahnke Vahnke and Phoenix musician Otis Francis, was released in 2020 and included half original songs and half cover versions of Roy Acuff, Johnny Cash, Leonard Cohen, Dick Jurgens and Elvis Presley.

Projected uses A major use of the bridge will be to transport iron ore from the Kimkan open-pit mine in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast that is owned by IRC Limited, which is partly owned by Petropavlovsk plc. Petropavlovsk plc will participate in financing the bridge's construction. The bridge is expected to transport more than 3 million metric tons of cargo and 1.5 million passengers per year. History The bridge was first proposed in 2007 by Valery Solomonovich Gurevich, the vice-chairman of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. Gurevich said that the proposal to construct a bridge across the river was first suggested by the Russian side, in view of growing cargo transportation demands. In 2013, the transport ministries of Russia and China signed a general construction agreement.\\"–°—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–µ—Ä–≤–æ–≥–æ –∂–µ–ª–µ–∑–Ω–æ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–æ—Å—Ç–∞ —Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω—è—é—â–µ–≥–æ –ö–∏—Ç–∞–π –∏ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—é –Ω–∞—á–Ω–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤ 2009 –≥–æ–¥—É\\" (Construction of the first railway bridge connecting Russia and China will start in 2009) China.org.cn, 2008-11-27.

In November 2014, the local Russian media reported that a significant amount of the construction work had been carried out on the Chinese part of the bridge, but hardly anything had been done on the Russian part. In June 2016, the Russian government selected SK Most Group, a well-connected private Russian company led by Ruslan Baisarov, to work on the project. By July 2016, the Chinese portion of the bridge was finished but work had not started on the much shorter Russian portion. In December 2016, work began on the Russian portion of the bridge. Completion of structural link between the two sides of the bridge was completed in March 2019. Opening to rail traffic has been repeatedly delayed, with the December 2019 estimate being \\"the end of 2020\\", and then 3rd quarter of 2021https://www.dvnovosti.ru/eao/2020/02/17/110702/. Design The bridge was designed by Russia's Giprostroymost institute, satisfying both Russian and Chinese standards. In 2014, it was reported that the main structure over the Amur River runs north-south and will consist of 20 110-meter steel through-truss spans. The bridge will have both a standard gauge (1435 mm) track and a Russian gauge (1520 mm) track. However, the two tracks will be offset by only 800 mm, so that only one track can be used at any given time.

Established in the year 1970, the circulation of the paper is mainly through post, a method that its founder resorted to when news vendors refused to stock his paper. As of 2018, the newspaper was struggling to survive due to a paucity of funds. History Kalale Nadadur Varadaraja Iyengar, a Sanskrit scholar, launched the paper in 1970 with a goal of propagating the language. He was also a publisher of Sanskrit books, and the Sanskrit movable types that were sometimes lying idle with him were another motivation for starting the newspaper. When he discussed his venture with others, he had to face the wrath of skeptics who warned him of his 'misadventure' and predicted the newspaper's doom, because not many people believed that the Sanskrit language had a vocabulary sufficient to cover contemporary and complex day-to-day activities and developments. He was, however, supported in his venture by Agaram Rangaiah, who was an editor of a Kannada newspaper and also by P. Nagachar, who was a former Joint Director of Information. Ignoring the skeptics, Varadaraja Iyengar published the first issue of Sudharma on July 14, 1970, from a location called 'Ganapathi Totti' in Maharaja's Sanskrit College. He was also instrumental in starting a Sanskrit news bulletin on All India Radio by convincing I. K. Gujral, the then Minister of Information and Broadcasting in the Government of India. Varadaraja Iyengar died in 1990. The paper is published out of a press in the Ramachandra Agrahara locality of Mysore. Circulation The majority of the subscribers of the newspaper are Sanskrit scholars and students. The paper has a daily circulation of about 3500 copies. It has an annual subscription fee of Rs. 500 (about $7.50) and is circulated via post to academic institutions, public libraries and to readers throughout India. The paper is also subscribed to by readers in countries like Japan and the United States of America with an annual overseas subscription fee of $50. Current scenario The profit gained by circulating the newspaper is negligible but Sampath Kumar wants to continue publishing the newspaper because of his passion for journalism and the Sanskrit language. He has had to struggle to keep the publication afloat. The paper has also helped its readers to learn and improve their knowledge of the language. On 15 July 2011, the 42nd anniversary of the paper's publication was celebrated in Mysore. A unique feature of the celebration was that all speeches were in Sanskrit, which is a rarity, and two Sanskrit scholars were honored on that occasion. This newspaper is available online as well. The current editors Sri K.V.Sampathkumar and his wife Smt. Jayalakshmi KS are selected for the prestigious Padma Shri award for their contribution to journalism (under the category Literature and Education) by the Government of India in 2020. ePaper and Subscription  Sudharma was the first Sanskrit daily e-paper in the world. Its ePaper is available for free reading at http://sudharma.epapertoday.com/. Additionally, its print edition features a Sanskrit crossword puzzle and similar novelties.

His visual work has appeared in exhibitions at the International Center of Photography in New York, The Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, Mus√©e d'Art Contemporain in Marseille (France) and S√£o Paulo Museum of Image and Sound (Brazil). Pappas was born and raised in Southern California, but later established himself in Japan, Greece, Portugal, Brazil and Mexico. The artist currently resides in California. Career In Lisbon, he recorded his first two hip hop albums, Flowers And The Color Of Paint and Stellafly. His song, \\"Escape From The City Of Angels\\" (featuring Marta Dias) appeared on the soundtrack for Columbia Pictures' feature release, The Replacement Killers. He is also the lyricist/vocalist of the 1992 vocal-poem \\"So Get Up\\", which has been remixed by several international electronic music artists such as Armin Van Buuren, Cosmic Gate, Danny Tenaglia, DJ Vibe, Fatboy Slim, and Meat Katie. During his active years in Portugal, the artist's musical projects were nominated for a total of nine Pemios Blitz (the Portuguese equivalent of the Grammy Awards) including; Best Album (for Flowers And The Color Of Paint in 1995 and Stellafly in 1997) and Best Male Vocalist (in 1995 and 1997). In addition, the prestigious national newspaper, Publico, awarded his 1997 release Stellafly as \\"Album Of The Year\\" and considered a song from the record Seabra Is Mad as both the \\"Song Of The Year\\" and \\"Video Of The Year\\". Publico also cited his debut release Flowers And The Color Of Paint as one of the country's Ten Most Influential Albums Of The 1990s. In 1994, \\"So Get Up\\" was nominated for \\"Song Of The Year\\" at that year's Blitz Awards, and later climbed to 8th place on Billboard UK Independent Dance Charts (and 52nd on Billboard U.S. Independent Dance Charts). More than twenty years after its original release (with at leased 1,029 released remixes of the original vocal), \\"So Get Up\\" was deemed by Guinness World Records as being the most remixed vocal a cappella in musical history. In 1998, after over six years in Portugal, Pappas returned to California where he recorded his third album called Somewhere South Of Somalia with producer Conley Abrams III. The lyrics from this album were written on a two-month journey into East Africa. Later, in Rio de Janeiro he recorded two more albums, Recorded In Rio and Saltwater Nomad. In 2007, he briefly returned to Portugal to record with former Underground Sound of Lisbon member DJ Vibe, providing vocals and lyrics for the track \\"You\\". In 2011, indie label Sweatlodge Records released Fishdaddy Flashbacks highlighting some of the artist's songs from the beginning of his career in 1994 until 2011. In early 2013, Pappas produced his first all- instrumental album, Voiceless Blue Raven. He also collaborated with the trip hop vocalist Cyncy. In addition to creating music, his short story series entitled Fishdaddy Chronicles has appeared in international surfing magazines including Surfer, The Surfer's Journal, Water, and Transworld Surf. In 2009, his short story \\"Miracle At Malibu\\" was published in the book entitled Surf Story, a collective volume of stories and surf culture compiled by Robb Havassy. His abstract photographic art and body of sculpture work known as The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard have been exhibited globally, by The Camp in Costa Mesa, California in June 2010, Gallery Alma Do Mar in S√£o Paulo, Brazil in October 2010, WOA-Way Of Arts in Lisbon, Portugal in December 2012, Hurley International in Orange County, California in October 2013, and F+ Gallery in Santa Ana, California from February to March 2015. Between 2010 and 2015, the artist created most of his musical, photographic and sculptural works at Recanto Akahti, his small ranch in rural South America located on the edge of the Atlantic Forest (Mata Atl√¢ntica) in AkahtiL√¢ndia. The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard Bucerius Palus Tinea a reincarnated surfboard sculpture by Ithaka Darin Pappas from the series Aliens Of AkahtiLandia 2015Amanari a reincarnated surfboard sculpture by artist Ithaka Darin Pappas from the series Jurema 2009 In 1989, while living in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, Pappas began one of his major art projects, The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard, a large body of contemporary sculpture work created using recycled surfboards as raw building material and repurposing them into contemporary wall-mounted art pieces. The series to date, which is said to contain an estimated three hundred full-sized sculptures, has been exhibited on four continents and featured in hundreds of magazines and on many TV features. The most recent solo exhibitions of these works were hosted by Hurley Clothing in Costa Mesa, California in October 2013 and WOA: Way Of Arts in Cascais, Portugal in December 2012. He has been active with this medium since its inception; with additional individual pieces made in Mexico. In December 2012, during an interview piece regarding his solo showing of surfboard sculptures at Gallery WOA in Lisbon, Fuel TV Europe declared that Pappas was \\"The Godfather of Contemporary Surf Art\\". Works from this project appear in the private collections of international surfing celebrities and Hollywood production companies. In Oscar-winning actress Marlee Matlin's non-fictional book entitled, I'll Scream Later, she says of Ithaka's work with The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard project, \\"He turns surfboards into art, seriously\\". Photographer Pappas began experimenting with his father's 35mm and medium format film cameras as early as age five. He started assisting professional photographers immediately after high school and within a year began publishing much of his own work. His primary early focus was on portraiture, mostly musicians and actors. As a regular free-lancer for hip hop labels Priority Records, Ruthless Records and Quality Records, he helped document the early West Coast urban music scene. He has also worked sporadically in the fashion world, mostly for Fairchild Publications' Women's Wear Daily and Daily News Record. In addition, his photographs have appeared in Essence, Elle, Glamour, Surf Portugal, Fluir (Brazil), Deja-Vu (Japan), Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles North Shore Magazine, Publico (Portugal), Speak Magazine, Revista Super Som (Portugal), Rolling Stone, Shape, Switch (Japan), Teen Vogue, Orange County Register, The Beach Reporter, Thrasher, OnFire (Portugal), Vibe and Water. Musician Brian Wilson in a West Los Angeles recording studio, 1990 (photographed by Ithaka Darin Pappas). His celebrity subjects have included Bebe Moore Campbell, Brian Wilson, Chuck Liddell, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Gabrielle Anwar, Giancarlo Esposito, Lea Thompson, A Lighter Shade of Brown, Marlee Matlin, N.W.A., Oliver Sacks, Richard Tyler, Robert Anton Wilson, Rudy Rucker, Scott Weiland, Takashi Murakami, Teddy Riley, Terence McKenna, WC, and William Travilla. His advertising clients have included Young Chang Pianos, Independent Truck Company, Priority Records, Quality Records, EMI Records, Polygram Records, Redley Shoes (Brazil) and Ocean Pacific clothing. Perhaps the most well-known commercial photographic works by Pappas are his early images of the influential Los Angeles Gangsta rap group N.W.A.. Pappas worked for their West Coast record label Priority Records between 1988 and 1991 and documented almost the entire lifespan of the group, from their South Central beginnings, stardom, and eventual disassembly. The pictures from these early sessions, particularly The Miracle Mile Shot, which features all five members of the project photographed on a white backdrop at Pappas' own apartment in Los Angeles, has been printed in Rolling Stone, Q magazine (UK), The Hundreds, Blitz Magazine (Portugal) etc., and was used as the primary backdrop for the entire NWA segment of the 2016 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Brooklyn, New York. That same image also appears in the 2017 HBO documentary, The Defiant Ones, about Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine directed by Allen Hughes. In 2018, images from Ithaka's catalogue of Eazy E and NWA (and Fab Five Freddy hosting their first interview on Yo! MTV Raps) appeared in the book Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop and subsequent 2019 exhibit hosted by The Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles and in 2020 another showing in New York at the International Center of Photography. Both the book and exhibits were created by culture journalist Vikki Tobak. The images feature a bullet-proof vested Eazy E skateboarding with locals in Venice Beach. These are the only known images of Eazy E skateboarding. In a May 2019 interview with VladTV, Fab 5 Freddy stated regarding the day, \\"When I did that first show with NWA‚Äîand we ended up at Venice Beach‚ÄîEazy E sees these kids skateboarding. And Easy goes and jumps on a skateboard. And he‚Äôs holding his own skating around in Venice Beach‚Ä¶ You just wouldn‚Äôt think of the quintessential architect of a lot of the gangster rap energy being able to get on a skateboard and do his thing at that point in time. This was like ‚Äô89.\\" Aliens Of AkahtiL√¢ndia In February 2015, the F+ Gallery in Santa Ana, California (founded by Micah Kersh) hosted an all-insect art exhibit entitled \\"Aliens Of AkahtiL√¢ndia\\". The exhibit featured over forty original sculptures, photo, and mixed-media works by Pappas; entirely inspired by insects he had observed and photographed on his small art ranch called AkahtiL√¢ndia located in the rural, jungle area of the municipality of Mongagu√°, Brazil. Six guest creators were invited to do individual interpretations of some of the insects: David Clyde Kersh, Erica L. Ellingson, Ian Morris, Nathan Paul Gibbs, Will Thompson, and Steven R. Kutcher. The opening event also included a live presentation by actress/insect handler Diana Terranova who encouraged attendees to participate by petting and even holding exotic arachnids such as tarantulas and Thelyphonida. \\"So Get Up\\" controversies In December of 1992, Pappas wrote and recited a poem called \\"So Get Up\\" for his weekly segment on a radio program called \\"Quatro Bairro\\" on R√°dio Comercial in Lisbon, Portugal. In February of 1993 he made an electronic musical version in Manchester, UK. Nine months later, he re-recorded it as a 'guest performer' to be the primary vocal of a B-Side single for the Portuguese dance music group called the \\"Underground Sound of Lisbon.\\" The USL remix of \\"So Get Up\\" became an instant national hit and was later released internationally as a ten-mix, double vinyl set on New York's Tribal Records (a subsidiary of I.R.S. Records/EMI). The song climbed to 8th place on the Billboard Independent Dance Music Chart for the UK‚Äîand number 52nd in the United States. Since 1995, the song has been remixed by many artists such as Fat Boy Slim, Junior Vasquez, Danny Tenaglia, Miss Kittin, Armin Van Buuren, and Cosmic Gate, and has appeared on over 350 compilations with combined sales/downloads in the tens of millions. Ironically, the song which was considered the first modern \\"Portuguese\\" musical export was released without even crediting Pappas, even though he was the primary publishing rights owner of the track and never a member of the Underground Sound of Lisbon project. Reportedly no actual record royalties were ever paid to Ithaka. In 1999, Samsung used a version of So Get Up (remixed by the UK Breakbeat duo Stretch N Vern) for a printer advertising campaign featuring Jun Ji-Hyun. According to most media sources the commercial transformed Jun into a teen icon in Korea (today Jun is one of the most highly paid and most awarded actresses in all of Asia). The commercial, produced by Cheil Worldwide in Seoul, reportedly did not credit or pay either Pappas or Stretch N Vern.

She is played by Canadian actress Jewel Staite, who previously played the Wraith Ellia in season two episode \\"Instinct\\". She was created by the producers, who wanted someone to fill in for Carson Beckett after Paul McGillion's departure from regular status in the series. Keller had a recurring role in the fourth season, and was later promoted to a regular in Season 5.Blog of Joseph Mallozzi, Stargate Atlantis producer (February 5, 2008). Retrieved on 2008-02-06. Dr. Keller was introduced in the third season finale, \\"First Strike\\". She is a brilliant young doctor and becomes a member of the Atlantis Expedition, and has taken charge as Atlantis' Chief Medical Officer, after the death of Dr. Carson Beckett. At first, she appears as a non-assertive character, but has proven to be courageous over time. Towards the end of the fifth season, she starts a relationship with fellow expedition member Rodney McKay. In 2008, Staite was nominated for a Gemini Award in \\"Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role\\" for her role as Keller, and in 2009, she was also nominated for a Leo Award in \\"Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series.\\" Role in Stargate Atlantis =Character arc= Dr. Keller was born and raised in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. A few years before joining the Atlantis Expedition her mother dies and she becomes all her father has left. She has vertigo. During her schooling years, she is three years ahead of her class, having graduated high school at the age of 15 and earns a bachelor's degree before she becomes 18. She is then trained to be a doctor, where she soon becomes Atlantis' Chief Medical Officer, with some reluctance, after the death of former Chief Medical Officer Dr. Carson Beckett. She also says that she is no Carson, but Dr. Weir assures her she will do just fine. One of her first duties is to try and save Dr Weir's life, after she is critically injured due to the Asuran beam grazing the tower before the city can escape from the Asurans. She talks with McKay and tells him that he could save her life with Replicator nanites that once infected her. She is one of many people affected by nightmares in Atlantis after Colonel John Sheppard touches a crystal life form that invades people's nightmares. In hers, she dreams that Teyla Emmagan suffers severe abdominal pain and dies when an alien insect bursts out of her stomach. She and Teyla both went to New Athos on a medical check up. After discovering the Athosians were missing, she helps Teyla through the night, and even overcomes some of her fears and drawbacks from her early years, after injuring Nabel, who is later revealed to have worked for Michael. When she gets back to Atlantis, she is the one who discovers that Teyla is pregnant. After finding the clone of Beckett, she realises that Michael made an injection to keep his cells from deteriorating. When she is unable to find a band-aid measure, she places him in stasis to give her and a team enough time to solve the problem. Two months later, she was able to wake up Beckett's clone from the stasis pod, after she found the solution from Michael's database from M2S-445. Unfortunately, she is exposed to a compound that would turn her into a Hive Ship, and threatened the base. Cloned Beckett is able to find a cure and stops the process before the IOA considers killing her. Later on, she finds a gene therapy from Michael's database that would eliminate the Wraith's dependence on feeding on humans. =Love triangle= She develops a romantic interest in Ronon - an interest that appears to be mutual - while the two are locked in the Infirmary during a malfunction of Atlantis' automated lockdown procedures. They almost kissed until the lockdown ended. She later appears to have some romantic interest or maybe only fondness regarding McKay, who saves her life when trapped in an abandoned Genii mine with him and Carter. In an alternate timeline, she develops a romantic interest in McKay after they both leave the Atlantis Project, although later in this time line she dies from complications which are caused by repeated exposure to the Hoffan Drug which causes Rodney to set out to correct the error and send Sheppard back to his timeline which essentially destroys the alternate timeline. In the proper timeline, McKay admits to her that he loves her, and has for some time. Ronon also reveals a romantic interest in Keller. However, when Dr. Keller realizes his intentions, she tells Ronon that she is interested in someone else. Later on a trip back to Earth, McKay and Dr. Keller are among the people locked down in a facility while they are on a date together. After McKay revives her from a hypothermic shock, McKay and Dr. Keller share a passionate kiss. Then Dr. Keller openly professes her love for McKay and says that she has \\"loved him for some time now\\". Conceptual history Jewel Staite in the 2005 Serenity convention. Jewel Staite, who plays Dr. Keller, previously played Ellia in the Stargate Atlantis episode \\"Instinct\\". Staite was well-known among sci-fi fans for playing Kaylee Frye in the cult series Firefly, and is the third regular Firefly actor to go on to appear in the Stargate franchise. The others were Adam Baldwin (Jayne Cobb in Firefly) who played Colonel Dave Dixon, and Morena Baccarin (Inara Serra in Firefly) who played Adria. Executive producer Martin Gero created the character of Jennifer Keller while writing \\"First Strike\\". The producers decided to cast Jewel Staite for the role as Keller after they enjoyed working with her previously as Ellia in \\"Instinct\\". After Paul McGillion departed from the series as Carson Beckett, Gero wanted Keller not to replace Beckett, but rather fill in for him. Gero also wanted to make Keller's situation endearing if she was uncomfortable in her new position, and didn't want it in the first place. She was also originally created to be a Canadian character, and while filming the episode, she held a Canadian flag patch. However, because Paul Mullie thought there were already enough Canadian characters in the series (which include Rodney McKay and Chuck), she was turned into an American instead, after filming was completed, so the visual effects team wiped away the Canadian flag and replaced it with a CGI flag of the US. She was given a recurring status for the fourth season, though the number of episodes she would appear in varied. In October 2006, it was revealed that she would appear in 13 to 15 episodes. However, by February 2007, it was revealed she would appear in eight episodes. By the time the season aired, she appeared in eleven episodes in total. She was promoted to a regular for the fifth season. Reportedly, Staite was eager for her new role as a regular. One of her first roles for the fifth season was \\"The Seed\\", where Staite had to be up at 4:00am for an extensive three to four hours with prosthetics. Reception For her role as Dr. Keller in the episode \\"Missing\\", Staite was nominated for \\"Best Performance by an Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role\\" for the 23rd annual Gemini Awards, 2008. However, she lost to Helene Joy from her role in Durham County. Staite's acting for the season five episode \\"Tracker\\" was also nominated for the \\"Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series\\" for the 2009 Leo Awards.

Although the Great Intelligence has no physical form, it is capable of communicating, both by itself and through possession, with other characters within the series. The Great Intelligence was originally created by Henry Lincoln and Mervyn Haisman and first appeared in the 1967 serial The Abominable Snowmen where it encountered the Second Doctor and his companions Jamie and Victoria. The Great Intelligence tries to form a physical body so as to conquer the Earth, making use of Yeti robots that resemble the cryptozoological creatures. Initially the Great Intelligence used the Yeti robots to scare off curiosity seekers, only later using them as an army. Both the Intelligence and the Yeti returned in its sequel The Web of Fear. After disagreements arose between Lincoln and Haisman with the BBC in 1968 over their rights to the Great Intelligence and Quarks, the writers departed from the series and both the Great Intelligence and Yeti were retired. The Great Intelligence and its Yeti minions have since appeared in the 1990s Virgin Missing Adventures range of novels and the 1995 Reeltime spin-off production Downtime. The Great Intelligence returned in the 2012 Christmas Special \\"The Snowmen\\", where it is voiced by Sir Ian McKellen, which details the entity's origins. Richard E Grant assumed the role in subsequent appearances in the seventh series of the revived show. Appearances Both the Great Intelligence and the Yeti appeared twice in the fifth season of the series as adversaries of the Doctor's second incarnation (Patrick Troughton). The 1967 serial The Abominable Snowmen depicts the Great Intelligence as having possessed the body of the High Lama Padmasamabhava (Wolfe Morris), ever since encountering the man on the astral plane some centuries ago. Using Padmasambhava the Great Intelligence moves small Yeti pieces around a chess- like map of the monastery and mountainside, with the Yeti protecting a cave hiding a pyramid of spheres that house the Great Intelligence. The Great Intelligence intends to create a physical body for itself, but these plans are foiled by the Doctor and his companions. In the sequel The Web of Fear, aired in 1968 and set forty years after The Abominable Snowmen, the Great Intelligence returns when a control sphere is activated and enters a Yeti. The Great Intelligence uses an army of Yeti to take over the London Underground and begins filling London with a Web. The Great Intelligence primarily possesses the mind of Staff-Sergeant Arnold (Jack Woolgar) to sabotage the military resistance to the Yeti invasion. The invasion is revealed as a trap designed to draw in the Doctor so that the Great Intelligence can drain the Doctor‚Äôs mind, but it is again defeated and banished. The 2012 Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) episode \\"The Snowmen\\" provides an origin for the Great Intelligence, whose voice is provided by Sir Ian McKellen. It reveals that the Intelligence originated as a crystalline organism that looks like snow and responds to the thoughts of others. The snow-like organism became influenced by the thoughts of a young boy, Walter Simeon, during the 1800s, forming a mental symbiosis. From there, the Great Intelligence had the adult Dr. Simeon (Richard E Grant) create \\"The Great Intelligence Institute\\" and orchestrate a scheme to obtain the DNA of a governess who froze to death in the Latimer family's pond. He intends to use her DNA to create ice-based lifeforms incapable of melting to take over the world. After the ice creature is destroyed, the Doctor uses a \\"memory worm\\" on Dr Simeon to erase his memories, expecting this to destroy the Intelligence. However, the Great Intelligence has existed long enough to become an independent entity and uses Simeon's brain-dead husk to attack the Doctor before withdrawing from his vessel when the Latimer family cries for the dying Clara, triggering his snow to melt. It is implied these events lead to The Web of Fear as the Doctor shows a map of the London Underground from 1966 to the Great Intelligence. The Great Intelligence appears in the 2013 episode \\"The Bells of Saint John\\", set in the present day. The Great Intelligence uses a woman called Miss Kizlet (Celia Imrie) to aid him in creating an organization based at the Shard to collect and harvest the minds of people using Wi-Fi for it to feed on. The Eleventh Doctor manages to upload Miss Kizlet into this \\"data cloud\\", forcing the workers to free the minds trapped in the data cloud and return them to their bodies. To preserve its secrecy and hinder UNIT's investigation, the Great Intelligence has Miss Kizlet wipe all memories of its existence from her and the other employees's memories. It communicated with humans on video screens using the likeness of Simeon. In the Series 7 finale, \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", the Great Intelligence manifests through and manipulates dark creatures called the Whisper Men, changing the one it inhabits into the form of Dr Simeon. The Whispermen kidnap the Paternoster Gang, close associates of the Eleventh Doctor, taking them to Trenzalore, the site of the Doctor's future grave. Having thereby lured the Doctor to his own grave, the Great Intelligence gains access to Doctor's tomb (his future dead TARDIS), by threatening the lives of the Gang. It is revealed the Doctor's travels through time have created a temporal rift \\"body\\" inside the dead husk of the future TARDIS. The Great Intelligence claims that it plans on getting revenge on the Doctor for foiling its schemes by scattering itself along the Doctor's timeline. Through scattering itself, the Great Intelligence intends to overturn all of the Doctor's various victories and destroy him, even though this would destroy the Great Intelligence itself. After it has entered the rift, however, the Doctor's companion Clara Oswald follows him, likewise scattering herself along the timeline, saving the Doctor, who in turn enters his own timeline to rescue Clara. The Intelligence is presumed destroyed, though multiple versions of it are laced in the Doctor's timeline. =Spin-off appearances= The Great Intelligence and its Yeti servants are featured in the 1995 spin-off video film Downtime, produced by Reeltime and featuring Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling), the Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney) and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) with a now deceased Professor Travers (Jack Watling) serving as a vessel for the Intelligence. Here the Great Intelligence plans on infecting the Internet so as to use it as a new body, using control spheres to transform humans into Yeti servants. Downtime was novelised by Marc Platt as part of Virgin's Missing Adventures range in 1996. The Great Intelligence also features in several New Adventure novels (All- Consuming Fire, Millennial Rites, Business Unusual, The Quantum Archangel and Divided Loyalties) in which it is identified with H. P. Lovecraft's Yog- Sothoth, a being from the universe before this one. The Great Intelligence also appeared in a back-up comic strip in Doctor Who Weekly Nos. 31‚Äì34.  Powers  The Great Intelligence had no physical form and thus relied on possession of living creatures to manipulate its environment. It existed on the astral plane and could enter the people it encountered. It allowed Padmasambhava to live over 300 years while he created the Robot Yeti and it also reanimated dead bodies like Staff Sergeant Arnold. It had considerable mental powers such as mind control and could even mentally attack the Doctor, causing him great pain, and travel through time and space. The Great Intelligence could also manifest itself in simple forms such as a slime that glowed brightly, a dense fog that consumed anything that entered it, and a poisonous web/fungus that could trap the Doctor's TARDIS and could not be destroyed by chemicals, explosives or flamethrowers. Physical servants =Yeti= The Yeti were an effort by the production team to create more recurring antagonists for the Doctor in lieu of the Daleks, whose creator and part-copyright owner Terry Nation desired to have appear in an American spin- off series. Writers Henry Lincoln and Mervyn Haisman chose the stories of the yeti to base their new monster upon. The Yeti are controlled by the Great Intelligence through control spheres. These are depicted as capable of seeking out inactive Yeti, emitting a series of whistle-like beeps whilst doing so. The Web of Fear shows the characters experimenting upon one of the spheres and eventually able to control the Yeti it is stored within by using a short-range remote control. =Snowmen= The Snowmen, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. In \\"The Snowmen\\", the Great Intelligence's first appearance in the internal chronology of the series, the Great Intelligence in the form of psychic snowflakes ‚Äì animated snowmen across Victorian London to fight for it. In the course of the episode, it also reanimates and takes control of a woman who died by freezing to death in a pond, and later still possesses the brain- dead body of its aide Dr. Walter Simeon (Richard E Grant) after he was bitten by a Memory Worm that wipes out all his memories. =Spoonheads= The Spoonheads are robots used by the Great Intelligence's operatives in \\"The Bells of Saint John\\" to harvest human minds for him to feast upon. They are also referred to as \\"Servers\\" by Miss Kizlet (Celia Imrie) and as walking Wi- Fi base stations by the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith). They have a spoon-shaped head through which they absorb a person's soul, and are able to disguise themselves as figures from the target's subconscious. Steven Moffat said that he wrote \\"The Bells of Saint John\\" as an \\"action rollercoaster\\", with the Spoonhead robots devised in contrast to other monsters he had created such as the Weeping Angels and Silence with a focus on scares. He has also said that the Spoonheads are not a critique on contemporary obsessions with technology and that the Wi-Fi concept was more of an invasion method new to Doctor Who. =Whisper Men= In \\"The Name of the Doctor\\", the Great Intelligence is assisted by the Whisper Men, invulnerable manifestations that whisper in rhymes. They appear as Victorian gentlemen, with no facial features other than mouths with sharp teeth. The Great Intelligence is able to physically manifest in place of any of the individual Whisper Men, taking the form of his last human host, Walter Simeon (Richard E Grant). Their whispers are implied to be prophetic, when chasing the Doctor on Trenzalore, whispering rhymes such as: \\"the man who lies will lie no more, when this man lies at Trenzalore,\\" and \\"This man must fall as all men must, the fate of all is always dust.\\" The rhymes often cryptically refer to past or future events that the Whisper Men had no obvious way of having knowing about. Reception Sir Ian McKellen was praised for his performance of the Great Intelligence in 2012's \\"The Snowmen\\". Critic Graham Sleight commented in an analysis of Doctor Who monsters that the use of Yeti robots by the Great Intelligence was uninteresting as they provided merely a physical and voiceless threat. Some reviewers have seen this as a strength, with Nick Page felt that the Yeti being controlled by the Great Intelligence gave them greater menace, arguing that because \\"the Great Intelligence... always turned off their power when it was not required\\", this creates suspense when the characters interacted with a dormant Yeti. Ian McKellen's performance of the Great Intelligence's voice for its return in the 2012 Christmas Special was generally well received. Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, said \\"hats off to Steven Moffat\\" for reintroducing the character and described the casting of Ian McKellen as \\"a coup\\" and \\"wizardly\\".\\"Radio Times\\" The character was seen by some reviewers as being underdeveloped, with Kyle Anderson of the Nerdist feeling that although McKellen and Richard E Grant, who portrayed its human minion Dr Simeon, were excellent casting choices the Great Intelligence's plan was \\"the least fleshed out part of the script\\". Matt Risley's review on IGN similarly praised the acting of McKellen and Grant, but felt the story was \\"stuffed with ideas\\" and the Great Intelligence's return was overshadowed by the \\"fully formed and utterly unpredictable\\" performance of Jenna-Louise Coleman as Clara Oswald. The character's appearance, portrayed by Richard E Grant, in \\"The Bells of Saint John\\", was perceived as establishing the Great Intelligence as a prominent antagonist for Series 7. Simon Brew felt that the Great Intelligence's appearance was \\"very welcome\\" and compared the character's use to that of Moriarty in Steven Moffat's series Sherlock. Mark Snow described the Great Intelligence in his review as a \\"Big Bad\\" and felt that the character's involvement tied nicely into the Spoonhead plot. Neela Debnath of The Independent, despite feeling that the episode was a \\"rehash\\" of elements of \\"Blink\\" and Sherlock, commented that it appeared to be establishing the groundwork for a battle between the Doctor and Great Intelligence.

As an artist, Brown specialized in traditional songs of the Southern Appalachians. He was influenced by old-time banjo players such as Uncle Dave Macon and Dock Boggs. Brown supported himself as a graphic artist and as such never performed widely outside of Chicago. Brown learned the banjo from Doc Hopkins, an old-time singer who hosted a morning radio show on WLS in Chicago. He would have his lesson at the studio after the show daily. As a banjo player Brown traveled much learning technique from other banjo players like Doc Hopkins, Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Grandpa Jones, Hobart Smith, Frank Proffitt. In 1963 Brown recorded the banjo player Hobart Smith for a record released as The 1963 Fleming Brown Tapes. In 1953 he joined the \\"I Come for to Sing\\" group with Studs Terkel, Larry Lane, Chet Roble and Big Bill Broonzy. Also in that year, he hosted a folk music radio show on Chicago's WFMT which was entitled \\"The Midnight Special\\" since it began at midnight on Saturdays. At the Old Town School, Brown mentored banjoist Stephen Wade who eventually took over teaching Fleming's class in 1974. Fleming has performed at the Asheville, North Carolina, Festival, the Newport Folk Festival, and the University of Chicago Folk Festival.

He is best known for his series of more than a dozen public statues of Sir Winston Churchill. Biography Nemon was born into a close Jewish family in Osijek. He was the second child, and elder son, of Mavro Neumann, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and his wife, Eugenia Adler. He was an accomplished artist from an early age, and began modelling with clay at a local brickworks. He exhibited early works locally in 1923 and 1924, while still at school. He obtained his baccalaureate in Osijek. He was encouraged by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá to study in Paris, but he moved to Vienna instead. He applied to join the Akademie der bildenden K√ºnste but failed to secure a place, and spent some time working at his uncle's bronze foundry in Vienna. While in Vienna, he met Sigmund Freud and made a sculpture of Freud's dog Topsy. He also made a sculpture of Princess Marie Bonaparte. Later in his life, Nemon changed his surname from Neumann. After a short period studying in Paris, he moved to Brussels in 1925 to study at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts, where he won a gold medal for his sculpture. Brussels became his home until 1939; he shared a house there with the painter Ren√© Magritte for much of the 1930s. He made the monument \\"June Victims\\" for his home city of Osijek in 1928, commemorating the murders of Pavle Radiƒá, ƒêuro Basariƒçek and Stjepan Radiƒá in Belgrade in 1928; all three were Croatian members of the Yugoslav Parliament who were fatally shot in the debating chamber by a Montenegrin Serb, Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá. Nemon returned to Vienna in 1931, to create a large seated sculpture of Freud, now in Hampstead. He staged a one-man exhibition of portrait heads at the Acad√©mie, including his Freud and a bust of Paul-Henri Spaak. He made portraits of King Albert I, Queen Astrid of the Belgians, Emile Vandervelde and August Vermeylen, and also exhibited at the Galerie Monteau in December 1934 and January 1939. Concerned by the approaching threat of Nazi Germany, he escaped to England in 1938, a year before the outbreak of the Second World War. He abandoned over a decade of work in progress in his studio, including a clay model, \\"Le Pont\\". Most of his family remained in Europe and were murdered in the Holocaust. He married Patricia Villiers- Stuart, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Villiers-Stuart, in 1939 and they lived firstly in Holywell Street in Oxford, and then Sandfield Road in Headington, before settling in Boars Hill. They had a son, Falcon and two daughters, Aurelia and Electra. Falcon had a varied career, first as a photographer, then as a film maker, and finally as a music promoter. Aurelia married the Conservative MP Sir George Young, and Electra married rock musician Phil May. He made a bust of Max Beerbohm in 1941 (now at Merton College, Oxford); Beerbohm taught him English. The growing family moved to Boars Hill, near Oxford, in 1941, first living in rented rooms, and then Nissen huts on land bought from Robert Graves which he named \\"Pleasant Land\\", after the words of the hymn Jerusalem. He designed and built a combined house and studio on the site in the 1960s. He exhibited some portraits at Regent's Park College in Oxford in 1942, and made portraits John Rothenstein, director of the Tate Gallery, and Sir Karl Parker of the Ashmolean Museum. He became a naturalised British subject in 1948. After the war, he made sculptures of a spectacular list of high-profile figures. He made portraits of the members of British Royal Family, including Elizabeth II, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen Mother, and the Earl Mountbatten of Burma, at a studio in St James's Palace. He also sculpted war leaders such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Earl Alexander of Tunis, Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, Lord Freyberg, Lord Portal of Hungerford, Lord Beaverbrook, and other political figures including Harold Macmillan, Harry S. Truman and Margaret Thatcher. He is best known for his series of more than a dozen public statues of Winston Churchill, including examples in the House of Commons, at Westerham (near Churchill's home at Chartwell), and in Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto. His last major piece, a monumental memorial to the Royal Canadian Air Force in Toronto, was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in 1984. Meanwhile, in the 1940s and 1950s, he also created a series of lesser-known relief works, which he called \\"Les Fleurs de mon Coeur\\" (The Flowers of my Heart). He was made an Honorary Doctor of Letters at the University of St. Andrews in 1977, and a retrospective was held at the Ashmolean Museum in 1982. He was honoured by the tenth Biennale Slavonaca. He died on 13 April 1985 at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. The same year, a memorial exhibition was held at the Galerija Likovnih Umjetnosti in Osijek. Technique and legacy Graves of Oscar Nemon (left) and his son Falcon Stuart (right) at Wootton, Vale of White Horse, Oxfordshire His technique depended on modelling from life directly in clay, quickly making many small studies with no preliminary drawings. He produced works in clay (often fired into terracotta), plaster, and stone, but most of his finished works were cast bronze, often at the Morris Singer art foundry or occasionally at the Burleighfield art foundry (now merged). His house and studio, Pleasant Land, remained closed for 17 years after his death. It reopened in 2003 as a museum of his life's work, exhibiting many studies and models for his finished works. It also houses the archive of his papers. Other papers, relating to his sculptures of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher, are held by the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge.

Efforts in tackling video infringement in Singapore Up to date, the AVPAS has only been known to have created a website which features the Odex Clarification Article on their homepage, has pictures of bootlegged anime and Japanese video CDs and contains a list of authorised titles. According to the \\"Odex Clarification Article\\" on the AVPAS website, the AVPAS has also been said to have authorised Odex to carry out demands of money from anime downloaders. However, the AVPAS has not publicly announced its authorisation and has not commented on whether this claim by Odex is true or false.

The attraction officially opened on June 9, 2007 as part of an expansion project in Toon Studio, an area within Walt Disney Studios Park formerly known as Animation Courtyard. It is themed to the Disney-Pixar film Finding Nemo and named after Crush, a green sea turtle voiced by (Andrew Stanton) from the film. Most of the roller coaster is enclosed and features dark ride special effects. History Disneyland Paris ‚Äì known as Disneyland Resort Paris at the time ‚Äì began a placemaking project as early as 2006 to improve and expand the Animation Courtyard area within Walt Disney Studios Park. The project was completed in 2007, and the area was renamed Toon Studio. No true official press announcement was given until the launch of the resort's 15th Anniversary Celebration on April 1, 2007.Article - Press Release & Concepts: 15th Grows with new attractions, entertainment Crush's Coaster is one of the feature attractions in Toon Studio. The ride debuted on June 9, 2007 and is the first and only ride at Disneyland Paris to be themed to Finding Nemo. Synopsis Guests enter the Toon Backlot of Toon Studio and stumble upon the beached sound stage and film set of Disney¬∑Pixar's Finding Nemo, themed as Sydney Harbour, where Crush and his sea friends invite guests to climb aboard turtle shells for a ride through memorable scenes from the movie.Attraction Guide - Ride scenes listing The ride starts off with shells \\"diving\\" into the ocean. The first part of the attraction is a dark ride taking guests to the Great Barrier Reef, where they meet Nemo and Squirt, then to the darkness of the depths, which the sunlight cannot reach and where they encounter the voracious glowfish, and finally to the Sunken Submarine surrounded by an army of jellyfish where they meet the sharks and their chief, Bruce. The second part of the ride is a coaster in the dark, representing the spiraling, churning East Australian Current itself. The ride ends up with shells returning to Sydney Harbour, with cheers from Crush and his friends. Technology The attraction employs several instances of new technology developed by Walt Disney Imagineering, the key being two large digital video projection effects in the early dark ride scenesArticle - 'Making Of' the dark ride scenes, effects description of the ride, which place Nemo, the clownfish, and Squirt, Crush's son, seamlessly within the 'underwater' environment. The technology was developed for Crush's Coaster in conjunction with Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage and The Seas with Nemo and Friends. Crush's Coaster marks the only second Disney-themed spinning roller coaster (following Primeval Whirl), and the first ever collaboration between German roller coaster engineers Maurer S√∂hne and Walt Disney Imagineering. Fastpass In a bid to decrease the long queues that frequently plague the ride, Disney conducted preliminary tests during July 2008 at the Crush's Coaster site to investigate the possibility of installing a Fastpass system at the attraction.Article Detailing the Fastpass Plans Fastpass was ultimately not implemented at the ride, though a single riders line subsequently was. Fastpass was again trialed in January 2018 Re-theming * On Halloween Night in 2010, the whole park was turned into a horror-based park, meaning most popular attractions were horror-re-themed. As such, the same happened to Crush's Coaster, which became Crush's Coaster : Avis de Temp√™te for this night.

It was named after the northern city of Panƒçevo (in Vojvodina) which is connected to Belgrade by the road continuing from the bridge. It was the only bridge over the Danube in Belgrade until December 2014, when the Pupin Bridge opened further upstream in the municipality of Zemun connecting it to the Banat side of Belgrade.  Location  The bridge is located in the Belgrade municipality of Palilula, which is the only municipality in the city that lies on both banks of the Danube. Geographically, it connects two large regions of Serbia, ≈†umadija and Banat (Panƒçevaƒçki Rit). The bridge approaches begin well back from the bridge itself in the neighborhoods of Bogoslovija (roundabout at Mije Kovaƒçeviƒáa street) and Ada Huja (Vi≈°njiƒçka street) and direct approach begins from the Boulevard of Despot Stefan.Beograd - plan i vodiƒç, 3rd edition, \\"Geokarta\\", 2007, The bridge spans the neighborhood of Viline Vode, the Danube (at approximately kilometre 1,166 of the riverTuristiƒçko podruƒçje Beograda, \\"Geokarta\\", 2007, ) and reaches the Banat side in the neighbourhood of Krnjaƒça, between the sub- neighborhoods of Blok Braƒáa Mariƒá and Blok Branko Momirov.  History  Construction of the original bridge began in 1933. On 27 October 1935 it was inaugurated by the Prince regent of Yugoslavia, Pavle KaraƒëorƒëeviƒáGlas Javnosti - Panƒçevaƒçki most u oƒçajnom stanju and named after the still minor King of Yugoslavia, Petar II (Most Kralja Petra II). After the German attack on Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 in the course of the World War II, the Yugoslav army command decided to blow up all three existing bridges in Belgrade (two over the Sava and one over the Danube) in a vain attempt to slow down the German Army advancement. Military commander of Belgrade, general Vojislav Nikolajeviƒá, was ordered to demolish them, and the order for the King Peter II Bridge was executed by major Velimir Piletiƒá. The Bridge of King Petar II was destroyed on the night between 10 and 11 April 1941. The Germans repaired the bridge for their purposes during the period of occupation. It became operational again in October 1942. In the spring of 1944, the Allied Anglo- American bombing of Belgrade began. The bridge was hit and damaged in the bombings of April 16 and 3 September 1944. When the Germans began to withdraw from Belgrade in October 1944, they destroyed the bridge themselves. Reconstruction of the bridge began in 1945, upstream from the remnants of the destroyed supporting piers. Plans were drawn up by the 50 Soviet engineers headed by Vladimir Aleksandrovich Golovko (1897‚Äì1956), lieutenant general of the Red Army's technical troops. Joseph Stalin's orders were that they should build a provisory crossing rather than an expensive railway bridge, but Josip Broz Tito convinced him that a proper bridge should be built. On 7 November 1946, the first train passed over the new bridge and regular road traffic started three weeks later, on 29 November. Originally, Tito named it the Bridge of the Red Army (Most Crvene Armije). In 2020 it was discovered that, despite the popular use by the citizens and official use of the city administration of the name Panƒçevo Bridge, the name was never officially changed from the Bridge of the Red Army, or the paper trail was lost in time. On 23 March 1963, a Soviet ship \\"Leningrad\\" was towing five, allegedly empty oil tankers. Passing under the bridge in the downstream direction, towards Smederevo, one of the tankers in the convoy hit one of the pillars of the bridge and immediately exploded. Few minutes later, when \\"Leningrad\\" towed all the tankers under the bridge, two smaller explosions were heard. By the time \\"Leningrad\\" reached several hundred meters away from the bridge, three tankers completely sank while two were cut in half by the explosions and protruded from the water. The debris from the explosion were scattered all over the area, while the bridge itself was damaged. In 1965, the bridge had a last major renovation. Not counting the ƒêerdap dams on the Romanian border, Panƒçevo Bridge was the only bridge over the Danube in Serbia that was not destroyed by NATO forces during the bombing of Serbia from 24 March to 12 June 1999.  Technical characteristics  The original bridge was built by a group of large German steel producers supplying the steel and by Siemens-Bauunion GmbH from Berlin doing all other works such as the piers for the bridge. The work of these companies was part of the reparations Germany had to pay to Serbia for the damage inflicted during World War I.Martin Metzler: Die Stahlbauwerke f√ºr die Br√ºcken im Zuge der neuen Bahnstrecke Belgrad‚ÄìPancevo, ausgef√ºhrt im Auftrage der jugoslawischen Regierung von den Werken Hein, Lehmann & Co.

Julius Springer, Berlin 1932 (reprint by Springer Book Archive, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-31615-3). In 1946, the bridge was originally intended to be just a railway bridge but later it was opened for road traffic, too. Today, it has two lanes in both directions for road traffic, and even though it was designed to have two rail tracks as well, at the moment there is only one rail track on the bridge. Total length of the steel bridge is 1,526.4 meters, of which 1,134,7 meters is over the river bed. The height of the main supporting piers is 18 meters.  Importance  Due to being the only bridge over the Danube in Belgrade for a long time, the bridge became very congested. At its peak Panƒçevo Bridge had between 150,000 to 200,000 vehicles crossing it daily. At the time when the bridge was rebuilt in 1946 (as of 1948 census), Panƒçevaƒçki Rit (section of Belgrade across the Danube) had a population of 7,998 inhabitants, Panƒçevo had 26,423 inhabitants and Belgrade itself had 388,246 inhabitants. As of 2011 census, Panƒçevo had 76,203 inhabitants (2.88 times higher) and Belgrade has 1,233,796 inhabitants (3.18 times higher). Also, number of motor vehicles between these two periods increased in much higher rate. After crossing into Krnjaƒça, the bridge continues as a road that splits in two directions: * Panƒçevo road, 16 kilometers to the east, which leads to the industrial town of Panƒçevo (after which both the bridge and the road are named) in the province of Vojvodina. * Zrenjanin road, 77 kilometers to the north, which leads to the town of Zrenjanin, also in Vojvodina. There are railway stations, \\"Panƒçevaƒçki most\\" on the Belgrade side of the bridge, and \\"Krnjaƒça\\", on the Krnjaƒça side. Both stations are part of Beovoz commuter rail which connects the area between the town of Stara Pazova in Syrmia region of Vojvodina, Belgrade and Panƒçevo as this entire area forms a greater metropolitan area of Belgrade. Planned reconstruction A view of the bridge from the Danube. After 2000, a general consensus was reached that new bridges in Belgrade are a necessity. Belgrade almost doubled after 1974 when the last bridge (Gazela) was built. As for the Panƒçevaƒçki Rit area, which has experienced a tenfold population growth since Panƒçevo Bridge was built, things are getting even more serious as city government has plans (though distant ones) to move Belgrade Port to the left bank and to begin a project of \\"Third Belgrade\\" in this area with 300,000‚Äì400,000 inhabitants (the first one is \\"Old\\" Belgrade in ≈†umadija; the second is \\"New\\" Belgrade, Novi Beograd-Zemun in Syrmia).Raƒëanje \\"treƒáeg Beograda\\" At the moment, even this one bridge is considered to be in a fairly bad shape, as a result of lack of maintenance and overuse. Public debate grew (not just about this bridge) in both expert and lay circles, to the point of publicly expressing views in the mass media on a daily basis about future Belgrade bridges. City government plans to do a complete reconstruction of Panƒçevo Bridge and build three more bridges over the Danube, to alleviate the traffic pressure on it. One bridge is supposed to be built downstream, to connect the Belgrade suburb of Vinƒça to Omoljica in the Panƒçevo municipality. The second bridge is projected for just 1.5 kilometers downstream from Panƒçevo Bridge and it will connect Ada Huja and Krnjaƒça. The third bridge is to be built upstream and will connect the neighborhoods of Zemun and Borƒça. Until this last bridge is finished, the city government has proposed a ferry line instead. However, as of December 2012, only the works on the Zemun-Borƒça Bridge have begun, which was finished in 2014 and renamed the Pupin Bridge. Reconstruction of Panƒçevo Bridge has been scheduled and postponed several times since 2006. So far, it as only been announced how the reconstruction will be handled.Doneto re≈°enje za Panƒçevaƒçki most It is supposed to last for 12 months. The rail traffic will be closed during that time. \\"Beovoz\\" would stop on the approaches to the bridge and buses would take passengers to the other side. But the bridge will never be fully closed to road traffic, because it would cut Belgrade's only connection across the Danube. Rail tracks will be temporary turned into traffic lanes, which would mean the bridge will have six lanes in this period and two will always be closed for reconstruction. Freight traffic will be allowed only at night. Panƒçevo Bridge itself was partially renovated in 2008‚Äì2010. The main steel grid-like construction beneath the carriageways was repaired, while some parts were replaced or strengthened. The main girders were sandblasted and painted. Since then, commuters (drivers, cyclists, pedestrians) posted numerous photos of neglect and abundant damages of the bridge. In 2014, the cyclists hanged a large placard, pointing to the bad shape of the paths and guard rails, general neglect of the bridge and abundant weeds growing on it. In November 2017 the state road company posted a warning and a protective tape on the bridge, alarming the commuters on caution because of the \\"chipping off of the bridge construction\\". The company later clarified that only parts of the concrete parapet were cracking, which is a \\"damage of aesthetic nature\\". In December 2017, Minister for transportation Zorana Mihajloviƒá announced the complete reconstruction of the bridge, without giving the starting date but setting the deadline for the finished works at the end of 2018. The carriageways will be repaired, the bridge will be protected from corrosion and the decorative lights will be posted. It is not known whether the project from 2008 can still be used due to the passed time and further deterioration of the bridge since then. Also, she announced that the illegal gravel facilities in the vicinity of the bridge will be dislocated. It is estimated that the entire project would cost 3.5 billion dinars (‚Ç¨30 million). Confronted later with her claims, minister Mihajloviƒá denied ever saying that, even though she was filmed, saying that she was talking only about the bicycle paths, which didn't happen either. However, the deputy mayor Goran Vesiƒá said in July 2018 that the reconstruction of the bridge can't be done until the new bridge over the Danube, across the Ada Huja is finished. Vesiƒá stated that the construction of this bridge should start in 2020, which was later moved to 2021, meaning it can't be finished before 2024. But the traffic incidents on the bridge continued, especially regarding bridge fences, which are not proper, motor traffic fences, which are metallic, firm and capable of bouncing back a car going at . Instead they are much weaker, pedestrian ones and are, additionally, rusty and covered in the overgrowth of weeds. In 2013, a truck broke the bridge fence, falling down in the yard of the construction company, but without fatalities. In the winter of 2017, parts of the bridge construction fell down, not hurting anyone. In October 2018 a car broke the fence and fell down, killing father and daughter inside the car. In August 2019 another car broke the fence, but without fatalities. Still, the authorities refuse to place even the proper fences, waiting for the full reconstruction and claiming that the current maintenance works are adequate.

All characters were introduced by the show's co-creator Julia Smith. The first character to be introduced during the year is John Fisher (Dave Dale), a drag queen hired for The Queen Victoria pub. Jan Hammond (Jane How), the long-term mistress of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), was introduced in January. March sees the first appearances of The Firm mobster Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt), Dot Cotton's (June Brown) husband Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) and new brewery area manager James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde). The newborn daughter of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry), was introduced in May.

Rezaul Kabir (Tanveer Ghani), the cousin of Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh), is introduced in December. Additionally, multiple other characters appear throughout the year. John Fisher John Fisher, played by Dave Dale, is a drag queen who is hired by publican Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) in January 1986 to perform for the premier drag night at The Queen Victoria public house. Following the publicity over Angie's drink driving case, she and her husband, Den (Leslie Grantham), worry that the brewery who owns the pub might find cause to cancel their tenancy, and 'free entertainment' is seen as a way to bolster the evening trade. The first drag night is a success until Pete Beale (Peter Dean) starts heckling the performer. John mistakes Pete's intent, thinking he wants to join in with the act. John playfully takes Pete's pint on-stage and Pete leaps after it, causing a tussle to ensue. Seconds later, Den finds himself on the floor breaking up the pair. The surprise arrival of Den's mistress, Jan Hammond (Jane How), prompts Den to close the pub early, so the act is halted prematurely. Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) is quite impressed with the drag artiste and thinks him to be a caring and sensitive person. When he mentions that his other job is delivering 'kiss-o-grams', she hatches a plan for starting her own business. John performs several more drag evenings in The Vic. His last appearance is on 27 February 1986. Jan Hammond Jan Hammond, played by Jane How, appears in 1986 as the long-term mistress of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Jan is considered by the locals as a posh upper-class sort of woman and works at an art gallery. Den has an affair with her while he is still married to Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). She is always hated by Angie and Den's adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) but she tries her best to get along with her. She moves into The Queen Victoria at one point on Den's insistence, but is not much of a landlady so moves out soon after. Den tries to leave Angie for Jan so he tells Angie he is leaving her. Angie grows desperate and to stop him from leaving her she tells him that she only has six months to live. Den believes her but discovers many months later that she is lying while they are on holiday in Venice. Den serves Angie divorce papers on Christmas Day 1986. Eventually, Jan grows tired of Den not having a proper relationship with her, so she ends their affair after he refuses to leave Walford with her. She leaves Walford in 1987 and goes on to marry a man called Dario Chimisso (Marino Mase) on a gondola in Venice. She makes a brief return in 2002 for Angie's funeral. She returns to give Sharon a portrait that Den had left with her many years earlier. She briefly returns again in 2003 in a lead-up to Den's return 14 years since he has been shot and presumed dead by an employee of the gangland organisation The Firm. Den's long lost son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) tracks Jan down and she reveals that Den had survived the shooting and came to her for help. With her help, Den was able to flee to Spain to protect himself and his family. Brad Williams Brad Williams, played by Jonathan Stratt, is a mobster heavy for the East End gangster organisation known as The Firm. He is of low importance within the organisation and is generally used as an errand boy. He is first seen in March 1986 and over the next two years he appears occasionally to inform Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) of his bosses' orders. Den works in league with the Firm on a variety of dodgy dealings. Towards the end of 1987 Brad is instructed to scare graphic designer, Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), who is a jury member in a trial for an associate of the Firm. Brad and Den put pressure on Colin to give a verdict of 'not guilty' at the trial, and when he refuses Brad steals his keys and vandalises his flat, causing all sorts of problems for Colin. During 1988 Brad is seen more frequently, turning up to aid the running of the Firm's business in Walford, Strokes winebar, which is being managed by Den and is really a front for an illegal gambling den. The petty criminal Darren Roberts (Gary McDonald) manages to get on the wrong side of Brad when he tries to play him off against the owner of The Dagmar, James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde). The Firm's money lending business, 'Walford Investments', are in the process of securing the takeover of James' ailing winebar, albeit against his wishes. Darren, sensing an opportunity, promises to provide James protection against the Firm, whilst all the while attempting to get onto the Firm's payroll via Brad. Incensed by Darren's audacity, Brad takes him aside and gives him a severe beating, and Darren leaves Walford shortly after. In July 1988, Den discovers Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) after she had been raped by James Wilmott-Brown, and instantly seeks revenge. He demands retribution from his contacts within the Firm, Brad and Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), and is enraged when they refused to act. Den manages to persuade Brad to help him anyway by conning him into thinking that James' downfall will please his bosses and Den watches with glee as the Dagmar burns down in flames. However the resulting police investigation puts the Firm's business in serious jeopardy. They then decide that to put a halt to the investigation either Brad or Den have to take the blame for the arson attack. Neither Brad nor Den is willing to take the blame, and both are then involved in a personal war to persuade the other to take the rap. Brad immediately calls on the services of Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem), via threats, and forces him to give the police a tip off about Den. The police begin questioning Den and realising that he has gotten in way over his head, he decides that he will accept the blame for the arson, but instead of serving time in prison, he decides to flee the country to avoid arrest. The Firm agree to this and Den is taken into hiding. However the Firm subsequently set up a hit on Den, which fails when he escapes from hiding and turns himself into the police to avoid the Firm's heavies. As the Firm busy themselves with ways in which to silence Den from inside, Brad causes more grief by doing a bit of moonlighting; breaking into several people's houses on the Square with an accomplice who works as a cab driver for Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih). The burglaries result in a greater police presence in the area. The Firm are not impressed and Gregory Mantel (Pavel Douglas) ‚Äì a superior member of the Firm ‚Äì threatens Brad with serious repercussions should his deviance continue. Brad stops the burglaries, but his accomplice continues without him and is eventually caught by the police and is quick to implicate Brad. The investigating officer, D.I. Ashley, decides to use this piece of information to manipulate the dimwitted Brad. He threatens to put him in prison unless he acts as an informant. Brad is forced to relay information on The Firm. Strokes is closed down as a result and various members of the Firm are arrested. With the Firm under threat from the police, Gregory Mantel decides that Den has to be the informant and makes arrangements to have him eliminated. On the day of Den's trial, Mantel's heavies break Den out of custody and take him to the Firm's headquarters, where he is greeted by Brad. Brad imprisons him in a room to await the arrival of Mantel. However, Den is not about to go down without a fight and knowing how easily influenced Brad is, he makes one last attempt to secure his freedom. He plays upon Brad's fears, relaying that he had heard that Brad is to be the next victim on the Firm's hit-list. Brad is easily swayed and he decides to help Den escape. He lures the other gang member, Marco, into the cell where an awaiting Den jumps him and throws him to the floor, whilst Brad locks him up in Den's place. The two then escape from the headquarters, and Brad speeds off in his car, leaving Den to fend for himself. Brad immediately goes to the police and hands himself in. He promises to confess everything he knows regarding the arson, Den, and the Firm. Meanwhile, Mantel, who is furious with Brad's betrayal, tracks Den down, he is shot and presumed dead for over 14 years. However he returns to Walford in 2003, revealing that he had faked his own death to secure his survival. It is also revealed that a man named Brad has been charged for the arson attack of the Dagmar. Subsequently, Den is no longer wanted by the police. Charlie Cotton Charlie Cotton, played by Christopher Hancock, is a recurring character, introduced in March 1986 as the estranged husband of Dot Cotton (June Brown). He appears in stints until producers made the decision to kill the character off-screen in 1991, to aid development of characters connected to him. June Brown was openly against the killing of Charlie. Charlie appears one last time, in October 2000, as an apparition, warning his son Nick to change his ways. Charlie comes and goes throughout his duration in the show; he is first seen 13 months after the soap's launch in 1986. Depicted as bigamous and a conman, Charlie typically reappears in the show whenever he needs money or temporary accommodation and, because of Dot's Christian ideals regarding forgiveness, Charlie always is permitted to return. According to Christopher Hancock, Charlie is \\"a truly revolting character, a loser\\" and the character has been described as a \\"despicable small-time villain [...] lazy and pathetic\\". Author Kate Lock has described Charlie as a \\"sly, shifty, weaselly man\\". To become the character of Charlie, Hancock wore stick-on sideburns. James Willmott-Brown James Willmott-Brown, played by William Boyde, is an ex-army officer, arriving in Albert Square in March 1986 as the area manager for 'Luxford and Copley', the brewery that owns The Queen Victoria. By December, he decides to move to the square and buys Debbie Wilkins's (Shirley Cheriton) house at 43 Albert Square when she sells it following her fianc√©, Andy's (Ross Davidson), death. He and Debbie later have a fling, but it doesn't progress into anything serious. Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) takes a shine to him and tries seducing him on several occasions, but is rebuffed each time. During the early years, he is friendly with Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). Vicki Fowler Vicki Fowler, played by Emma Herry from the character's birth in 1986 to 1988, Samantha Leigh Martin from 1988 to 1995, and Scarlett Johnson from 2003 to 2004, is the daughter of Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). The character is born in the serial, and was conceived in a controversial storyline about teenage pregnancy. Exploiting a whodunnit angle, at the time of the first showing, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted to guess. The audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 in episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. 4 possible suspects are seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). As Michelle waits by their rendezvous point, a car pulls up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leap out of a car and give it all away: Den Watts is the father Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream. The character of Vicki was written out in 1995, after the actress who played Vicki's mother decided to leave the soap. After an 8-year absence, she was reintroduced by Executive Producer Louise Berridge in 2003 as a rebellious teenager. Carmel Jackson Carmel Jackson (also Roberts), played by Judith Jacob, is a health visitor, introduced in a recurring, minor role in 1986. Producers saw potential in the character. Script writers were asked to develop more prominent storylines, and Carmel became a regular character. She is portrayed as a well-meaning, caring individual who is forever getting everyone's problems dumped on her. She is featured in storylines about domestic violence and various family and career upsets. Jacob remained in the role until 1989, when she opted to leave. Off- screen, the character has been the subject of criticism regarding the portrayal of her profession from the Health Visitors Association. In July 1984, before EastEnders went to air, the show's creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, attended an opening evening at the Anna Scher Theatre School in North London, to find actors for roles in their upcoming serial. According to Holland and Smith, Anna Scher's school was unlike many other drama schools, where students were \\"ironed out\\", all looking and sounding the same. At Anna Scher's school, students' natural personalities and accents were encouraged, \\"her students aren't taught how to act, they're helped to dig inside themselves and be.\\" In Holland and Smith's own words, this was \\"just the sort of non-acting that [EastEnders] was looking for\\". Harry Reynolds Harry Reynolds, played by Gareth Potter, is a college friend of Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford) who first appears along with Tessa Parker (Josephine Melville) in June 1986. Both Harry and Tessa have radical Marxist beliefs and it isn't long before they manage to recruit Kelvin to the same way of thinking.

Pat is the third-longest-running character in the soap, coming after Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who has featured in the soap since it first aired, and Dot Branning (June Brown). The character of Pat was conceived by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, in 1984. Although not one of the serial's original protagonists, Pat is referred to in the character outline of Pete Beale, who appeared on- screen in EastEnders first episode, as written by Smith and Holland in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story: \\"[Pete] married very young to Pat ‚Äì it turned out to be a total disaster. They were too young, rushing into a difficult life for all the wrong reasons, and truthfully, [Pat] was a vicious shrew...[Pete] divorced [Pat] and married Kathy when he was 24...His two sons by his first marriage are nineteen and twenty and he hardly sees them...\\" On 7 July 2011, it was announced that St. Clement had quit EastEnders. The actress revealed that she wanted to try other things, saying \\"I have enjoyed 25 and a half wonderful years in EastEnders creating the character of Pat but feel it's time to hang up her earrings. Leaving the EastEnders 'family' will be akin to a bereavement. But I'm looking forward to the other work and life opportunities that I will have the time to pursue.\\" Pat left later in the year and executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said her departure was a \\"fitting\\" storyline.

He is Walford's first on-screen gay resident and when his sexuality is eventually revealed it causes shockwaves around the Square. Colin is EastEnders first homosexual character. Introduced in August 1986, Colin was one of the more popular characters in the early years of the programme. At first the audience and the residents of Walford were kept in the dark about the fact that Colin was gay. This changed by the end of the year, at which time Colin acquired a young boyfriend named Barry Clark (Gary Hailes). Colin was one of the most controversial characters of his time ‚Äì mainly because gay- orientated content was still relatively rare on prime-time television during the mid-1980s. Gay characters that existed were usually farcical, camp parodies, created purely for comic relief, such as Mr Humphries in the situation comedy, Are You Being Served?.\\"Gay TV Characters\\", RainbowNetwork.com.

Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh) shows a romantic interest in Jaggat and they go on several dates. Naima's cousin Rezaul Kabir (Tanveer Ghani) is furious as Jaggat is a Sikh and Naima is Muslim, and he tries to provoke Jaggat into a fight in The Queen Victoria one night. However, Jaggat just laughs off Rezaul's aggression and they eventually become friends. In the end nothing serious ever develops between Jaggat and Naima anyway, as Naima ends the relationship to marry Farrukh ‚Äì a suitor from Bangladesh. Having Lou Beale (Anna Wing), Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) as patients sharpens his interest in the elderly and Jaggat leaves the Square in December 1987 for full-time work with old people in a Northern home. Shortly before leaving, he persuades Ethel to move into sheltered housing at Prosper Estate. Barry Clark Barry Clark, played by Gary Hailes, is a cockney barrow-boy, and an unlikely partner for the gay, middle-class yuppie, Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). He is much younger than his middle-aged boyfriend and as such Colin's role is almost paternal. Barry is open about his sexuality to everyone except his volatile father ‚Äì and when he is finally told he takes the news so badly that Barry turns straight just to appease him ‚Äì although he is never very successful at it. Barry is one half of Walford's first homosexual couple. His boyfriend, Colin, had already been introduced to the show several months prior to Barry's arrival and he had proven to be an extremely popular addition to the cast. Both the audience and the residents of Walford had been kept in the dark about the fact that Colin was gay. This changed upon Barry's first scene on-screen, whereby the audience learnt that he had spent the night with Colin after picking him up the night before (off-screen) at a gay club. Colin and Barry were two of the most controversial characters of their time ‚Äì mainly because gay-orientated content was still relatively rare on prime time television during the mid-1980s. Gay characters that existed were usually farcical camp parodies, created purely for comic relief, such as Mr. Humphries in the situation comedy, Are You Being Served?. Rezaul Kabir Rezaul Kabir, played by Tanveer Ghani, arrives in Albert Square in December 1986. He is Naima Jeffery's (Shreela Ghosh) cousin and had been sent by Naima's family to help her run her grocery store, First Til Last. Naima is extremely angry about Rezaul's arrival, but her family are adamant that he has to stay, so she begrudgingly puts up with his presence. Rezaul is rather bossy, pretentious, chauvinistic and arrogant, and instantly tries to take over the running of the shop. On his first night, Rezaul puts forth a scheme to increase the shop's profits and asks for a month's trial. Naima agrees to the trial. Rezaul then proceeds to mark up the shop's items to unreasonably high prices as well as steal money from the till. Naima is furious and to make matters worse it soon becomes clear that Rezaul has amorous intentions towards her. Naima isn't remotely interested in Rezaul so she sets about finding herself a new boyfriend to put him off. She starts dating the Square's new doctor, Jaggat Singh (Amerjit Deu). Rezaul, a Muslim, becomes very envious when he sees them together and tells Naima that she is making a fool of herself, smiling and fawning over a Sikh. This culminates in Rezaul trying to pick a fight with Dr. Singh in The Queen Victoria one night, almost getting himself barred in the process. In April 1987, Naima and Rezaul get into a shouting match when he tells her that her family have decided she has to marry him. He is furious when she flatly refuses, but later admits that he is actually relieved and tells her he doesn't want to marry her either. Naima's defiance displeases her family and they subsequently break off all ties with her. Rezaul, it seems, is rather impressed with Naima and tells her that she is no ordinary Bengali girl as he'd first thought. Things between Naima and Rezaul improve after this, and when Naima's family eventually send over another of her cousins for her to marry, he goes out of his way to help their blossoming romance. After Naima leaves England to live in Bangladesh, Rezaul runs The First Til Last in her place for a while. Whilst managing the shop, he catches Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) shoplifting and makes a citizen's arrest. Charlie then has to appear at the Magistrates' Court and is given a ¬£50 fine. When Naima's family sell the shop to Ashraf Karim (Aftab Sachak) at the end of the year, Rezaul leaves Walford to resume his studies. His last appearance is in January 1988.

Franke has about 10,500 employees working in 68 companies in Europe, South and North America, Africa, Australia and Asia. In 2012, the Franke Group had a total turnover of CHF 2,012.4 million. Franke History = Founding years = Hermann Franke founded a sheet metal business in his name in Rorschach, Switzerland, in 1911. In the late 1920s the economic upturn in the industry and construction sector led to the incorporation of a sanitary installations department. Franke began with the production of oven tops, skylights and dormer windows. In the 1930s Franke started production of the first sink units in nickeline, monel-metal and later in stainless steel. Franke built a new factory with offices and residential building, and the company's ten employees relocated to Aarburg, Switzerland. Franke initiated the first production series and the first fully welded, smooth sink unit. Hermann Franke died on January 25, 1939, and his son Walter took over the business. The Second World War led to great difficulties in obtaining materials. During the years after the war the company's factory facilities expanded and the production of complete kitchens began. Franke started to export products to European countries. = Expansion years = The construction sector developed encouragingly. Business expanded rapidly. Franke sold kitchen sinks. In 1950 the Washroom and Sanitary Equipment product group was established as part of Franke with products for communal washrooms and WCs. Production of components for propulsion systems began. Franke saw its first foreign investment in Germany and by 1955 had 500 employees. In the late 1950s, Franke's production doubled. Factory facilities were expanded further. A \\"Commercial Kitchens\\" division was founded. By 1961 Franke had 750 employees. Over the next twelve years Franke experienced rapid growth: 13 new subsidiaries were established and two companies began manufacturing under license. In 1972, Franke built and installed the first kitchen for McDonald's in Munich. By 1974 the company had 2,600 employees. In 1975 Franke ownership changes: Walter Franke's friend and business partner Willi Pieper took over. Four subsidiaries and two licensees were added to the group. In 1979 the Franke compact sink system was introduced. In the late 1980s the divisional organization was established. = Today = Michael Pieper joined Group Management in 1989. Rapid and consistent expansion transformed Franke into a corporate group with worldwide operations. Today Franke consists of approx. 10,500 employees in over 70 companies in Europe, South America, North America, Africa, Australia and Asia. =Franke Companies= Switzerland Franke Artemis Group has its headquarters in Aarburg/Switzerland.

He has worked for many years as Assistant Director of The Wilds Christian Camp/Conference Center in Brevard, North Carolina and in 2007, he was named Director of THE WILDS of New England in Deering, New Hampshire. Biography Rand Hummel was raised in Orangeville, Pennsylvania and became a Christian at the age of 6. He came from a broken family and for many years lived with his Grandparents. Despite growing up with a lot of anger problems, Rand continued to attend church. He became unimpressed with what he perceived as a casual attitude toward God among many Christians. This led him eventually to Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina. Rand received his B.A. from Bob Jones in 1978. Immediately after graduation, he went to work at The Wilds, a Christian camp in Brevard, North Carolina specializing in teen ministry. He was the Program Director there for 25 years. Describing his work, he said \\"a lot of my job is simply the teens. I preach to them, counsel them, hang out with them, run the games... We actually have the best job on the campsite.\\" Every summer Rand speaks to around 15,000 teenagers who come to the Wilds. He later became the Assistant Director, and in 2007 was appointed Director of The Wilds of New England. Maintaining a busy itinerary throughout the year, Rand preaches about 350 times annually. He has also written several books and Bible study guides. Much of his speaking and writing focuses on evangelism, the knowledge of God through personal daily devotions, and moral purity. He has also been part of the BJU Seminary's adjunct faculty since 1999. He received an honorary doctorate from the school in 2004. Rand and his wife Amber have had two miscarriages and one stillborn. He said that these experiences drew them closer to God. The Hummels also have two grown children. In early March 2012, Rand suffered a mild heart attack and spent several days in the hospital. He has since recovered and is reported to have returned home in full health. Controversy Rand's actions during Bob Jones Univesity's sexual abuse controversy have been subject to controversy. Bob Jones University was accused of mishandling sexual assault reports and blaming victims for their abuse. In a 2009 sermon at BJU, Hummel recounted a story in which he instructed a woman to seek forgiveness from her abuser for what he referred to as \\"bitterness.\\"http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america- tonight/articles/2014/6/18/bob-jones-universitysexualabuse.html This clip circulated on the internet as an example of the allegations against BJU, where Hummel has been an adjunct professor and counselor. Hummel has also been personally accused of misconduct including denial of medical care for campers at the WILDS and emotional manipulation.https://medium.com/@justinkalebgraves/my-independent- fundamentalist-baptist-abuse-story-d92f21023915 Quotes * \\"Make it hard to sin and easy to do right!\\" (Romans 13:14) * \\"You can be as close to God as you want to be!\\" (James 4:8) * \\"Why do we throw a pair of Levi‚Äôs on Christ and bring Him down to our level?

Having had a good scientific education, Van Kinsbergen was a proponent of fleet modernization and wrote many books about naval organization, discipline and tactics. In 1773, he twice defeated an Ottoman fleet while in Russian service. Returning to the Dutch Republic in 1775, he became a Dutch naval hero in 1781, fighting the Royal Navy, and gradually attained the position of commander-in-chief as a lieutenant-admiral. When France conquered the Republic in 1795 he was fired by the new revolutionary regime and prevented from becoming Danish commander-in- chief, but the Kingdom of Holland reinstated him in 1806, in the rank of fleet marshal, and made him a count. He was again degraded by the French Empire in 1810; after the liberation the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1814 honoured him with his old rank of lieutenant-admiral. Van Kinsbergen, in his later life a very wealthy man, was also noted for his philanthropy, supporting poor relief, naval education, the arts and the sciences. Life =Early career= Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen Van Kinsbergen was born in Doesburg as the eldest son of the non-commissioned officer Johann Henrich van Kinsbergen, who had been born in Neunkirchen, Germany, in 1706, started his military career in Austrian service, and originally spelled his family name as \\"Ginsberg\\". When he was six, he moved with his parents in 1741 to Elburg. Three years later he left with his father for the Southern Netherlands and at the age of nine enlisted as a soldier of the Dutch field army during the War of the Austrian Succession, returning in 1748. Reading the biography of Gerard Brandt about the life of Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, he decided to become a naval hero as well and went to the naval academy of Groningen, where he was trained as an engineer between 1751 and 1755. In 1756, he became a midshipman on the Weststellingerwerf and on 16 March 1758 a lieutenant, in the Admiralty of Amsterdam, on the Maarssen. Van Kinsbergen had three younger brothers; two enlisted in the army of Prussia; the youngest, Jan Hermanus, worked for the Dutch East India Company (VOC), but in 1770 was cashiered as a captain, when his ship the Leimuiden got stuck on the rocks of the Cape Verde island Boa Vista and he brought himself and a chosen few off the wreck in safety via a sloop, leaving behind the rest of the crew. Jan Hermanus would be later appointed a naval captain through the influence of Jan Hendrik, embarrassing the latter by becoming involved in a few serious accidents. Jan Hendrik served on the Amazone in 1761; from 13 October 1763 he commanded the frigate Swieten. =Russian service= In the late 1760s, due to severe financial difficulties, few Dutch ships were active and Van Kinsbergen used his free time to write a large series of publications about naval modernisation. He is seen as a typical example of the new generation of Dutch naval officers of the era who longer owed their position to either a merchant fleet career or a noble background but to a thorough scientific education. In 1769, Van Kinsbergen despaired of ever being promoted and obtained leave to enter the service of the VOC and depart for the Dutch Indies for four years. However, in the previous years he had already established a minor international reputation as a naval thinker, enthusiastically corresponding with many influential foreign contacts. He was informed by Prince Henry of Prussia that due to the Russo- Turkish War (1768‚Äì1774) the Russian navy was in search of naval experts. Henry immediately could obtain him a position there. On 15 August 1770, Van Kinsbergen got permission from the Dutch admiral-general, stadholder William V, Prince of Orange, to depart for Russia. However, William V would not free him completely from his obligations. Van Kinsbergen was promised that one year later, on 15 August 1771, he would in his absence be appointed captain. In exchange again three years after that date he would return to the fatherland should it have need of his services and this cycle of temporary appointments would be repeated every three years. In the summer of 1771, Jan Hendrik travelled via Berlin, where he visited Prince Henry, to Saint Petersburg where he on 29 September was appointed acting captain in the Imperial Russian Navy; on 2 October he was promoted to captain second class. He immediately left for the Black Sea; on arrival he was charged with commanding a troop of cossacks and fought, meanwhile learning Russian, on land during the winter campaign. In a fight he was shot through the knee and saved from under a heap of corpses by a cossack, whom he would later get an appointment at the Amsterdam naval wharf. From 9 February 1772 at Ia≈üi he repaired river vessels captured from the Turkish Danube fleet. On 12 June he got his first naval command in Russian service, bringing dispatches on a galiot to Azov. From 13 November he brought dispatches from the southern army to Saint Petersburg. He was on that occasion introduced to the empress and made a favourable impression on her with his enthusiastic plans for the Black Sea fleet. Accordingly, on 23 April 1773 he became flotilla-commander in the Black Sea. His force was rather insignificant consisting of just two ketches of twelve cannon each and two yachts. Van Kinsbergen decided nevertheless that the moment had arrived to make a name for himself and acted as aggressively as his limited powers allowed. He entered the Sea of Marmara through the Bosporus, charted it as the first Western European ever, then entered the Dardanelles and finally returned to the Black Sea after duelling with a coastal fortress of Istanbul. Twice that year he defeated a Turkish fleet and won the title 'Hero of the Black Sea'. On 23 June, he encountered a Turkish flotilla of three frigates of 52 cannon and a ship-of-the-line of 75 and despite the disparity in firepower at once attacked it and wiped it out, the first major \\"Christian\\" naval victory in the Black Sea in four centuries. His superiors were very pleased and gave him permission to raid Sinope, but this was soon changed into a mission to intercept a transport fleet headed for the Crimea. In the morning of 2 September he spotted the enemy fleet off Novorossiysk but at the same time a messenger brought him the order to abandon the attack in view of the force imbalance: Van Kinsbergen's original two ketches had only been reinforced by a single frigate of 32 cannon and a fireship, while the Turkish fleet numbered four ships-of-the-line, seven frigates and six transports with five thousand men infantry. Determined to give battle anyway, van Kinsbergen declared in front of his officers that such an order could not possibly be authentic, arrested the messenger and pursued the attack. Conforming to the standard tactics of the day, the Turkish fleet sailed in a formal line-of-battle. Van Kinsbergen realized that doing likewise would only result in the quick annihilation of his flotilla and therefore applied a modern concentration of forces: using the weather gauge he frontally attacked the leading Turkish vessel, causing the following Turkish ships to break formation. During the ensuing melee the Turkish fleet got so damaged and confused that it abandoned the landing attempt and withdrew. Van Kinsbergen's insubordination was soon forgiven and he was on 22 September rewarded with the Order of St. George, be it only in the fourth degree, which rather disappointed him. After the war, Van Kinsbergen feared he would not be promoted and in November 1774 obtained a temporary discharge from Russian service. Although Catherine the Great would gladly have kept him on in the Russian navy, promoted him to captain first class and knight in the third degree (from 1776 even second degree) he asked to be accepted into Dutch service in May 1775, from August travelled via Saint Petersburg and Berlin to the Republic, obtained a final honourable discharge from Russian service in December, and early 1776 was back in the service of the Dutch. =Return to the Dutch Republic= In 1776 Van Kinsbergen was readmitted into the Admiralty of Amsterdam as a full captain, which raised quite a few eyebrows as the deal with stadtholder William had been kept a secret. In this period tensions between the United Kingdom and the Dutch Republic, caused by the American Revolution, led to Dutch efforts to build up the fleet and therefore to increased career opportunities for Dutch officers. From 17 May 1776 Van Kinsbergen was sent on an international expedition, as captain of the Amphitrite, against Morocco to enforce a treaty upon Mohammed ben Abdallah to limit the privateering activities of the Barbary corsairs; on 27 June he was as an envoy present at the signing of the treaty at Sal√©, returning to the Republic in October. In 1778 he was captain of the frigate Argo; in October he went again to Sal√© to deliver the treaty document ratified by the States-General of the Netherlands. After returning he and his Argo were part of the convoy temporarily detained by a superior British fleet on 31 December 1779 in search of contraband for France, the Affair of Fielding and Bylandt. The Dutch populace was outraged by this event, refusing to further cooperate with measures directed at blockading America and war with Britain became inevitable, even though the Dutch were ill-prepared for it. In 1780 Van Kinbergen became a member of a commission that should strengthen the Dutch coastal defences. Meanwhile, he had published a great number of articles and booklets regarding naval reorganisation; in 1780 his Sailor's Compendium appeared, written with cooperation of the religious author Joannes Florentius Martinet and aimed at improving discipline. Officers should themselves be an exemplary role model and abstain from gambling, boozing, whoring and swearing ‚Äî except in the latter case when giving orders, as in Van Kinsbergen's experience they tended to be followed much better if containing a few curses. =Late Republican navy= Early 1781, the British started a series of surprise attacks on Dutch ships and colonies and thereby the Fourth Anglo- Dutch War. The inferior Dutch home fleet mostly avoided a direct confrontation but Van Kinsbergen, on 12 February having been appointed temporary rear- admiral, played an important role in the only major naval fight of the war, the Battle of Dogger Bank, as flotilla commander, second in command to Rear- Admiral Johan Zoutman. Van Kinsbergen on the Admiraal-Generaal escorted a merchant convoy when he by accident encountered a British squadron superior in firepower and managed to ensure the survival of the convoy. The Dutch were jubilant and Van Kinsbergen acquired the status of naval hero. He was honoured by stadholder William V by being awarded a special Dogger Bank Medal, as the Dutch Republic had no honorary military orders. William was in need of a popular figurehead to bolster his regime and on 14 August 1781 appointed Van Kinsbergen as his adjutant-general and used him as his permanent naval advisor. This way van Kinsbergen soon became the de facto supreme naval commander and also gained a wider political influence, having regular talks with the Orangist leaders on how best to counter the Patriots. On 10 May 1782 he also became a major, commanding a newly raised marine unit. The same year he published general instructions regarding the naval service and a Fundamentals of Naval Tactics, that would be translated into Russian in 1792. In October he commanded a squadron headed for Norway to escort a VOC return fleet; in his absence he was on 10 October appointed a member of the new Secret Council for Naval Affairs. In 1783, wearied by the endless criticism of the Dutch naval policy, he considered to return to Russian service but was persuaded by the stadtholder to remain. In 1784 and 1785 he went to the Mediterranean on the Jupiter, partly to deter a possible attack from Venice. At Toulon he received the news that an investigating commission had concluded that he was to blame for the so-called \\"Brest affair\\", the failure of the attempt in the summer of 1782 to form a combined Spanish-French-Dutch fleet in the English Channel. In reaction he sent his resignation to William, but again the stadtholder managed to change his admiral's mind. In February 1786 he returned with part of his squadron. On 23 July 1786 he married for the first time, with Hester Hooft, the very wealthy daughter of an Amsterdam burgomaster and widow of schepen George Clifford IV. In 1787 the relationship with the stadtholder became strained when the latter used a Prussian military intervention to repress the Patriots. Van Kinsbergen's house in Amsterdam was even searched by soldiers for evidence of secret dealings with William's enemies, though nothing more incriminating was found than some sabres and pistols. At that time Van Kinsbergen had already left the Republic however: he was on a honeymoon in Germany, being received in Vienna by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. Again, envoys of Catharina tried to make him re-enter Russian service, offering him the rank of vice-admiral and the command of the Black Sea fleet, but after some consideration he refused in March 1788, even though the stadtholder had consented to a change of service in February. On 8 April 1789 he also refused to become Danish commander-in-chief; on 16 December he was appointed Dutch vice-admiral. In 1790 he commanded an auxiliary squadron, joining the English fleet for a possible conflict with Spain. In 1791 and 1792, revolutionary France attacked the Republic and Van Kinsbergen stayed on land, writing a number of publications. On 3 March 1793, he became admiral- commander-in-chief of the Hollandic and Zealandic fleet and commander of the naval-artillery corps, in the summer beating off a French invasion attempt to cross the Hollands Diep. On 11 August 1793 he was appointed lieutenant- admiral. In 1794 the allied Rhine defences collapsed and the French could in early 1795 march unopposed over the frozen Dutch Water Line, bringing the Patriots to power. =In disgrace with the Batavian Republic= On 17 January 1795 at Scheveningen he took leave from the departing stadtholder, who fled for England, never to return. In the absence of the admiral-general Van Kinbergen was now supreme commander; England apparently being the new enemy he took measures to prevent Dutch ships and ports falling into English hands. On 29 January and again on 9 February he bade the States-General to be relieved from his duty. However, these themselves were at this moment being replaced by a new revolutionary regime, instated by the French: The Batavian Republic. On 24 February he was arrested on orders of the Provisional Representatives of the province of Holland, revolutionaries who had appointed themselves as a provisional government. Soon he was again released, only to be cashiered together with the entire naval officer corps on 27 February. Although some urged him to ask the new regime to be reinstated, Van Kinsbergen, confused and depressed, simply did not bother. On 26 April his wife died and in June he accepted a Danish offer to become vice-admiral and commander-in-chief. However, the revolutionary regime refused to give him permission to leave the country and in 1796 pressured Denmark to withdraw his appointment, though he nominally stayed in Danish service until 1806. In 1796 Van Kinsbergen returned to the old house of his deceased parents in Elburg, dedicating his life to philanthropy. He created a naval academy in Elburg and an orphanage in Apeldoorn; in 1799 for his health he moved to an estate near the latter town, Welgelegen, a former property of a deceased younger brother. Gradually the Batavian Republic, in need of popular men to legitimise its power, began to make overtures to Van Kinsbergen: in 1797 it was suggested he become supreme commander; in 1801 even a formal offer was made. This failed however because he demanded that all officers be reinstated. Early 1806 Grand Pensionary Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck, a man well acquainted to him, made a personal and emotional appeal, but the admiral again refused. =Kingdom of Holland= However, in the summer of 1806, on orders of Emperor Napoleon I the Kingdom of Holland was created and his brother, the new King Louis Bonaparte, on 16 July appointed Van Kinsbergen member of the Dutch Council of State and First Chamberlain ‚Äî and these were only the first of a long list of honours bestowed on the old admiral: e.g. on 26 December he was made marshal, on 15 May 1808 Marshal of the Hollandic Naval Forces and on 4 February 1810, when on French orders all Dutch marshals had to be degraded, he was appointed full admiral. On 4 May 1810 he was made Count of the Dogger Bank. On 11 October 1808 Alexander I of Russia had awarded him the star of the Order of St. Andrew which entailed the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, the Order of the White Eagle, the Order of St. Anne, first degree, and the Order of St. Stanislaus. In 1810 though, the Kingdom of Holland was annexed by the French Empire and Van Kinsbergen degraded to a French vice-admiral. However, on 18 December 1810 he was made a French count and on 2 January 1811 appointed French senator. Van Kinsbergen wrote to Napoleon on 11 January that he was too old to move to Paris ‚Äî knowing quite well the emperor had not intended him to ‚Äî and asked that his salary might be redirected to the navy, causing an annoyed Napoleon to react: \\"Does this proud Holland sailor think he can use me to dole out his alms?\\". Meanwhile, Van Kinsbergen continued his charitable works: e.g. in 1811 he donated a fire engine to the municipality of Elburg. =Continued appreciation from the Kingdom of the Netherlands= Late 1813 cossacks liberated the territory of the Northern Netherlands; Van Kinsbergen used his knowledge of Russian to negotiate an armistice between the French forces occupying Het Loo and the Russian troops, preventing this royal palace from being plundered. Also, he raised two regiments of Dutch volunteers to besiege the French garrison holding out in Deventer. On 28 March 1814 he was appointed one of the six hundred electors to approve the new Dutch Constitution. On 12 June 1814, he was appointed by the new sovereign prince, William VI of Orange, titular lieutenant-admiral and on 11 July a full lieutenant-admiral: in the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands this was to be a purely honorary rank, bestowed for great merit, in the case of Van Kinsbergen for his \\"excellent merits and constant Patriotism\\". In 1815 he became, on 8 July, Knight Grand Cross of the Order of William. Cenotaph of Van KinsbergenThe same year he offered a prize of seven hundred guilder for the best commemorative volume about the events of 1813, won by Johannes van der Palm. Hendrik Tollens won Van Kinsbergen's prize of five hundred guilder for a Dutch national anthem, with \\"Wien Ne√™rlands Bloed\\". In 1817 he also donated marble busts of Christiaan Huygens, Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, Hugo de Groot, Herman Boerhaave and Peter Paul Rubens to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in the Trippenhuis, works by Paulus Joseph Gabri√´l; another bust by the same, of De Ruyter, was given to the Amsterdam Naval Academy, festively carried by a fleet of boats through the canals. The wealthy merchant Jan Kluppel was so touched by the sight that he ordered also a bust of the modest Van Kinsbergen himself to be sculpted by Gabri√´l, to be placed below that of De Ruyter. On 20 November 1816 van Kinsbergen received the royal writ by the new King William I of the Netherlands that he was promoted to jonkheer. He died three years later shortly after his 84th birthday at Apeldoorn, from a chronic lung disease, where he was buried on 27 May. In 1821 a marble grave monument was finished by Gabri√´l in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam, but this is a cenotaph.

Beatrice was a full sister to Boniface, Count of Savoy, as well as two sisters Eleanor and Constance. She had two older half-sisters from her father's first marriage, an elder Beatrice and Margaret. Upon the death of her father in 1253, Beatrice received an amount of money as an inheritance.Wurstenberger (1858), Vol. IV, 331, p. 171.

Sandy (October 12, 1977 ‚Äì October 13, 2006) was a man from Brooklyn, New York, who died after being hit by a car while trying to escape four attackers who attempted to rob him because he was gay.  Background  Michael Sandy, 29, was a native of Bellport, New York, and lived in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He worked as a display designer at the IKEA store in Hicksville, New York. On the night of October 8, 2006, Sandy met Anthony Fortunato, 20, in an online chatroom and engaged in a chat with him. With Fortunato was John Fox, 19. After exchanging emails about having sex, Fortunato arranged to meet Sandy at Plumb Beach, a rest stop and popular cruising location on Belt Parkway in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. The meeting took about an hour to arrange. Fox and Fortunato then departed for Plumb Beach with friends Ilya Shurov, 20, and Gary Timmons, 17.  Attack  Sandy drove his 2004 Mazda to the location, and met Fox first, near Emmons Avenue. They then drove to Howard Beach, where Fortunato, Shurov, and Timmons were waiting. Shortly after Sandy arrived, witnesses saw two young white men approaching his car. At that time, Sandy was confronted by two of the young men, who began looking through his vehicle. Shurov pulled Sandy from the car and began punching him. At about 9:45 p.m., at least four witnesses saw one white man assaulting another man. Attempting to escape, Sandy ran toward the highway. He appeared to be calling for help on his cell phone. Two of his attackers caught up with him in the right lane of the highway. Shurov pursued Sandy across the guard rail, caught up with him in the right lane, and punched him. Sandy backpedaled into the middle lane, and was struck. One of the attackers dragged Sandy back to the side of the road. Shurov was seen rifling through Sandy's pockets after he was struck.  Arrests  Following the attack, police got their first lead in the case from Sandy's computer, which was still running the day after. Investigators examined the hard drive. The found exchanges with the AOL screen name \\"fisheyefox,\\" traced the IP address, and learned that the screen name belonged to Fox. Investigators visited Fox's home at 11:00 p.m., and Fox's father directed them to SUNY Maritime College, where Fox was a sophomore. Investigators arrived at the college at 2:00 a.m. and asked Fox to come to the 61st Precinct, where they began interviewing him at 2:52 a.m. During his interview, Fox made statements implicating himself, Shurov, Fortunato, and Timmons in the attack on Sandy. Fox also gave two videotaped statements. He identified Shurov as \\"that Russian kid,\\" but identified him when police took a picture of Shurov from Fox's MySpace page. A detective compared Shurov's picture to mug shots of young men arrested in the 61st precinct, and found a match. Detectives went to Shurov's home and asked him to come to the 60th Precinct police station for an interview. Shurov arrived at the 60th Precinct station at about 8:00 p.m. on October 10. He was read his Miranda rights and later gave statements implicating himself in the crime. Shown a news report about the attack, Shurov disputed the details of the report. At 1:00 a.m. on October 11, Shurov dictated a written statement, and made a videotaped statement at 10:20 p.m. on the same day. Witnesses picked Fox and Shurov out of line-ups and identified them as having been at the scene, attempting to grab Sandy. Timmons was arrested on October 11. Fortunato was implicated by statements from Shurov and Fox, and surrendered to police on October 25. Fortunato's family raised $1.3 million in hopes he would be granted bail. Bail, however was denied. The suspects were held at Rikers Island without bail.  Death  Unconscious and suffering possible brain injuries, Sandy was taken to Brookdale Hospital, where he was placed on a respirator and remained in a vegetative state. Sandy remained on life support for five days, without regaining consciousness. He died on October 13, 2006, one day after his 29th birthday, when his family made the decision to remove life support. Following Sandy's death, Fox, Fortunato and Shurov were indicted on October 25, 2006 on charges of second degree murder as a hate crime and attempted robbery as a hate crime. The three also faced possible charges of manslaughter as a hate crime, and faced potential sentences of 25 years to life in prison. On October 25, 2006 Timmons pled guilty to one count of attempted robbery in the second degree as a hate crime.  Motive  During questioning after arrest, the suspects made statements indicating that they had used the internet to lure gay men in the past. On April 24, 2007, the taped statements by Fox and Timmons were played in court, in order to determine their admissibility at trial.  Trial and sentencing  In a New York State trial courtroom, the Brooklyn Supreme Court (located in Brooklyn, NY), jury selection started on September 10, 2007 for the trial of Anthony Fortunato and John Fox, two of the four men accused of chasing Michael Sandy to his death in October 2006. They were charged with two counts of second- degree murder, one as a hate crime, four counts of attempted robbery with two as hate crimes, two manslaughter counts, one as a hate crime, and two assault counts, one as a hate crime. The third man, Ilya Shurov, was to be tried separately at a future date on the same charges. The fourth, Gary Timmons, had already pleaded guilty in 2006 to the reduced crime of attempted robbery as a hate crime in return for testifying as a prosecution witness. On Friday, October 5, 2007, a jury came back with a verdict of guilty against John Fox, Jr. on the charges of manslaughter, attempted robbery in the second degree, and attempted robbery in the first degree. All counts were as hate crimes. The prison times Fox faced ranged from 5 to 50 years. On October 11, 2007, Anthony Fortunato, the third defendant, was found guilty of manslaughter as a hate crime for his role in the death of Michael Sandy. He was also convicted of attempted petty larceny, but acquitted of attempted robbery. On November 5, 2007, Ilya Shurov, 21, the fourth and last defendant in the Michael Sandy case, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and attempted robbery as hate crimes on the day his trial was to have started. As part of the plea bargain, the charge of felony murder as a hate crime was dropped. Shurov agreed to serve 17.5 years for his guilty plea. If he had been found guilty of felony murder as a hate crime, it could have resulted in a life sentence. Shurov was the only defendant accused of physical violence against Michael Sandy. Three of the four men were sentenced on November 20, 2007, for their role in causing the death of Michael Sandy in 2006. They received the following sentences from Justice Jill Konviser-Levine of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, New York: Anthony Fortunato (21), 7 to 21 years. John Fox (20), 13 to 21 years. Ilya Shurov (21), 17¬Ω years. Each of those received slightly less than the maximum sentence. Gary Timmons (17), who in a plea bargain made the previous year, testified as a prosecution witnesses during the trial against John Fox and Anthony Fortunato, and he was to be sentenced to four years at a later date. Michael Sandy's attorney was Tarsha C. Smith.  Aftermath  On August 3, 2007, Judge Konviser ruled that Fox, Fortunato, and Shurov could be charged with hate crimes in Sandy's death. In her written statement, Judge Konsiver said that prosecutors only need to show that Sandy was chosen because of his sexual orientation, under the state's Hate Crimes Act of 2000. On February 27, 2008, openly gay singer-songwriter and community activist Anye Elite released \\"Just In Case\\", a tribute to Sandy and other gay violence victims. Sandy's death also brought back to public attention the death of Michael Griffith, an African American man who was killed after being hit by a car in Howard Beach, Queens, New York, while trying to escape a group of attackers. Fortunato and Fox have both served their sentences and are also now out on parole. Shurov, the only one convicted of physical violence against the victim, is still imprisoned.

During their stay, they become friendly with Emine Osman (Pelin Ahmet), Rayif Osman (Billy Hassan) and Murat Osman (Eddie Izzet). They return for a guest appearance following James's release from prison in January 1992. In April 2017, she returns to Walford under the alias Fi Browning as a business consultant employed by Grafton Hill, the new freeholders of The Queen Victoria, in an attempt to understand and improve the business. Upon arriving at Albert Square, she finds Lady Di wandering the square alone and whilst trying to locate her owner is accused by Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) of dognapping. Fi and Shirley meet again shortly later when Fi enters The Vic just as Shirley opens a bottle of champagne, which accidentally soaks Fi. Fi dries herself and introduces herself to the workforce, immediately telling Shirley and Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) they have too many staff and need to cut back. The Carters think Woody should leave, Fi insists that Grafton Hill want him to remain, so acting bar manager Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) and barmaid Tracey (Jane Slaughter) are ultimately sacked, leaving Tracey devastated. Fi returns to The Vic during a celebration of Tracey's time working there, but she wonders why they are prolonging Tracey's agony, though Shirley says it is bringing in customers. Tracey does not turn up, though, and the customers decide to boycott the pub until she is reinstated. Fi meets The Vic landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), when he returns from Bulgaria. Mick later has a meeting with Fi and she tells him that The Vic is a good pub and that it has charm, just like him, and she says that they need a permanent replacement for Whitney Carter (Shona McGarty), who has left. Fi later suggests to Mick that they should have more younger staff to boost customers and suggests a two-for-one Father's Day meal for the Vic. Fi and Shirley clash over their ideas for the Father's Day meal. Fi arrives when Mick is preparing for his wife Linda Carter's (Kellie Bright) 40th birthday party, and is serving customers when Linda arrives. Linda does not know who she is, but when she finds out, Linda accuses Fi of sacking Tracey but Fi tells Linda that she wants to improve the pub. Linda tells Mick that she does not trust Fi. The following day, Fi brings in craft ale beers for a special event later in the week, which Fi and Mick sample. Fi, Mick and Shirley then conduct interviews for a new staff member, and although Tracey applies, Mick chooses Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner), which Fi agrees with. Fi tells Mick that Shirley should be sacked as she is stealing from the till and taking drinks without paying. Mick reluctantly agrees and when Fi leaves the Vic, it is revealed that she and Max Branning (Jake Wood) are in a relationship and she is in on his revenge plan, allowing him to have sex with council worker Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) to access council documents. Fi overhears Carmel talking to Linda about the council. She then watches Max get more information about the council from Carmel and Denise Fox (Diane Parish). She then follows Max to the bathroom where they have sex in a toilet stall which was overheard by Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell). When Max tells Fi that he feels guilty about using Carmel, Fi tells him that he needs a backbone. Fi accuses Shirley of taking ¬£200 from the till but Mick confesses that it was him who had taken ¬£200 to pay Whitney. When Linda gives Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) a trial shift, Fi is not impressed and she sends him home. Linda then confronts Fi and she confides in Fi about the breakdown of her relationship with Mick. Fi tells Linda that she hopes that her and Linda would be friends and that she knows what Linda is going through. Fi becomes annoyed with the Carters when they begin to undermine her by giving Tracey her job back, bringing back Ladies night, and refusing to get rid of the piano. When Fi decides to attend Ladies night she questions Carmel about her relationship with Max, and attempts to bond with the other ladies by buying them all Champagne, and later congratulates Linda on the evening. Fi helps to plan for the Walford in Bloom event on the square, and later becomes upset when Max chooses to cancel plans with her in order to go to a council party with Carmel instead. Mick is suspicious when Fi begins acting strangely and ordering wine in the middle of the day. After being questioned, she reveals that it is the anniversary of her mother's death which she later explains was a suicide. She tells Mick about the day that she went home and found her mother's body and he applauds her for being brave enough to share such a personal story with him. Fi misreads the signals and attempts to kiss Mick who gently rebuffs her. She then calls Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre) to arrange a meet-up. When Fi makes a speech at Walford In Bloom, she is drunk and she stumbles through her speech. Fi continues to open up about her past with Mick at her home and they have a heart to heart but despite telling Mick that her father has died, she secretly calls him. 25 years later, James anonymously lays flowers addressed to Kathy at a memorial for her step-grandson Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell). The following day, James meets with his children ‚Äî Fi, who turns out to be Sophie, Luke (now Adam Astill) and Josh ‚Äî and Fi's uncle Hugo Browning (Simon Williams), before introducing himself to Fi's partner, Max. The Carters are given a ¬£60,000 repair bill for The Vic and Fi pretends to defend the Carters in front of Luke. Fi promises James that she will get the sealed bids from Max and Luke promises to persuade Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) to sell the car lot land, though Luke doubts Fi's abilities. When Max contemplates getting the sealed bids from Carmel's work laptop, he phones James, refusing to go through with it. Max meets up with James, Fi and Luke and tells them that he doesn't want Carmel to be involved in their plan any longer. Fi turns up to see Max at Carmel's house, where they have sex. However, unbeknownst to Max, Fi accesses Carmel's computer and steals the sealed bids. When James finds out about Max and Fi's relationship, Fi presents him with the sealed bids to earn James's approval, declaring her and Max are a fling. A disappointed Max ends his relationship with Fi, despite her telling him she wants to be with him. When the Carters are given a 5-week deadline to pay the bill, Fi gives the Carter's the option of selling the leasehold, but they refuse. After Hugo insults them about their personal lives and handling of the business over the course of the year, the Carters realise only Fi could have told him the information, realising she's been lying to them about her intentions for months. Linda throws a drink in Fi's face before her and Hugo are ejected from the pub. When Carmel is suspended from her job pending investigation because of sealed bids being accessed by an unknown person, Max contacts Fi and tells her what has happened. Fi and Max make amends and suggests to her that she takes ¬£10,000 off the repairs bill to get the Carters on her side. The Carters accept her help to raise the money. Fi catches Luke throttling Josh and breaks them up and Josh is hurt that Fi is in on Project Dagmar whilst he is excluded. When Carmel finds a ring at her house left behind by Max, she thinks Max will propose and invites people to The Vic. Fi finds out that the Carters have raised ¬£50,000 and when Max arrive, the pair kiss and Carmel is devastated whilst people turn on Max. James, Luke and Hugo later arrive and James tells them they own Grafton Hill. They serve the Carters with an eviction notice, putting up the money owed to the original amount ¬£60,000.

Fi is described as a \\"no-nonsense but sophisticated business woman with strength and vulnerability.\\" Executive producer Sean O'Connor said, \\"I'm really thrilled that we have been able to tempt Lisa Faulkner back to TV drama and back to the BBC. She's an extremely accomplished and hugely popular actress and we're very excited to have her in Albert Square. Fi Browning is something of a departure for EastEnders; a no-nonsense but sophisticated business woman with strength and vulnerability. But does she have an agenda? And who‚Äîor what‚Äîhas she set her sights on?\\" In August 2017, Faulkner was longlisted for Best Bad Girl at the Inside Soap Awards, while the revelation that Fi is associated with Max was longlisted for Best Shock Twist. She did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. William Boyde reprised his role as James Willmott-Brown after a 25-year absence in September 2017 and Fi was revealed to be his daughter Sophie. Faulkner enjoyed working with Boyde and described him as \\"lovely\\". Faulkner was told about Fi's real identity upon meeting the show bosses and found the story and Fi's background \\"so exciting\\". She felt she could not reject the role, although she was ordered not to inform anyone about Fi's identity. The actress revealed that at the conclusion of the storyline, which she said had \\"a beginning, middle and end\\", Fi would be leaving the serial.

Luke phones James and tells him that Phil is unaware. Kathy confides in Ian that James is back and Ian tells Phil. Phil visits James and realises Luke is James's son when he sees a photo of them. Phil tells Kathy that Luke is James's son and Phil fails to warn Luke off Ben. Ben is angry with Phil for what he did and when Kathy tries to get Ben and Phil to make up, Kathy tells Ben that Phil was protecting him as James raped her. After struggling to process what he is told, Ben is determined to hurt James, but Kathy orders Ben to keep out of it as it happened to her and not him. The next day, Ben confronts Luke with what he has been told and Luke tells Ben that James wants to meet him. Ben come face to face with James in his office and threatens him with a crowbar but Luke stops Ben from hurting James.

Luke gives Max his belongings from work and Kathy is angry with Ian when Luke reveals Weyland owns the caf√©. Luke sacks Lauren for refusing to serve an eviction notice on Ian. After Phil asks Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin) to get rid of Luke, Luke is bundled into the back of a van by Aidan's thugs while Phil watches on.

The Vic's profits are floundering following Den's separation from his wife, Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Reg comes to Walford to assess the problem. He wants the money that Den owes the brewery and demands to see the pub's invoices. Den tries to avoid this by steering clear of the pub all day and leaving his bar staff to put Reg off. This plan fails due to Angie, who happily informs Reg where Den keeps all the pub's bookwork, just to spite her husband. Den is forced to sell his car to pay off some of his debt. Later in the year, Sparrow joins Den in one of Ali (Nejdet Salih) and Mehmet Osman's (Haluk Bilginer) notorious after-hours card games. Den fleeces him and manages to win a vast sum of his money, although he later gives him back half in return for a future favour.

However, their relationship does not go smoothly. Magda is a bit older than Simon, and his immature tendencies often infuriate her, whilst her complaining infuriates him. Simon has some family upsets over the coming months and Magda fails to support him adequately, so he turns to his former boss, Den, for counsel. On Den's advice, Simon proceeds to pursue other women, and then starts seeing the barmaid Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) behind Magda's back.

The Roberts clan come to live with Junior's aunt, Carmel (Judith Jacob), at number 3b Albert Square. Junior proceeds to cause havoc around the Square, getting into trouble for stealing, graffitiing the square, playing truant, and gives everyone a fright when he runs away from home and almost gets into a car with a stranger. Junior finds himself a girlfriend in 1988, Melody (Lyanne Compton), who is equally as troublesome. The two begin a scam where they steal dogs from people and then return them for a reward. They also manage to spark up a feud with the Karim children, with both sides swapping racist insults at each other. Darren, a petty criminal, is not the best role-model for his impressionable son, and he is often unable to curtail his deviance. Junior idolises Darren and so he is devastated in July 1988 when his father abandons him and his sister and disappears without a word to anyone. Junior is forced to move away from Walford and go and live with his Grandparents, but he shows up regularly to visit Carmel and gets into more trouble, such as stealing Colin Russell's (Michael Cashman) CD collection and then selling them on to Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem) for a profit. This act even leads to him getting arrested after Colin's boyfriend, Guido (Nicholas Donovan), decides to teach him a lesson and informs the police. He gets off with a warning, but continues to make trouble for himself when he persuades Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) to buy him alcohol, and is witnessed drinking by Dot Cotton (June Brown). Dot is appalled to see an underage boy getting drunk, and she promptly informs Carmel. By 1989 Junior has become so troublesome that his elderly, sickly grandparents can no longer cope and Carmel is instructed to take both her brother's children in again. This is met unfavourably by Carmel's new husband Matthew Jackson (Steven Hartley), who freely admits that he dislikes Junior immensely. Matthew and Junior argue regularly and this puts a severe strain on Carmel's marital relationship. Junior's dislike for Matthew stems from the fact that he rightly suspects him of abusing his aunt. Junior tries to put a stop to Matthew's violence by informing various members of his family about the abuse he'd witnessed, but despite their best efforts Carmel refuses to take their help and denies that anything untoward is occurring. Things reach a head in July 1989, when Junior, in an attempt to protect his aunt from Matthew's rage, stabs him with a kitchen knife. Matthew is rushed to hospital, and Junior finds it difficult to come to terms with what he has done. Carmel eventually manages to reassure him that what he did was in self-defence and he is not to blame. The following month Carmel's father dies, and so the Robertses all leave Walford to tend to Junior's grieving grandmother. Junior is not pleased with this and makes an ill-fated attempt to run away from home with Melody, but he only manages to get as far as the front door before Carmel discovers his plan and forces him to leave with her instead.

Over the following months, Sharon finds herself leaning on Duncan more and more and she soon begins to feel attracted towards him, feelings that are reciprocated by Duncan. By the end of the year, the two start a relationship, much to the shock of Sharon's parents, Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie (Anita Dobson). Sharon seems to have fallen in love and in December she asks Duncan if they can get engaged. Duncan tries to win Den over by informing him of his admirable intentions towards Sharon, and hinting that marriage is a definite possibility in the not too distant future.

This eventually leads to Lofty's departure when Duncan sets him up with a job as a handyman in a children's home away from the Square. In late 1988, cracks starts to show in Duncan and Sharon's relationship, mainly because Sharon starts to begrudge the amount of time Duncan spends on his Christian duties and the many Bible readings he attends with the devout Christian, Dot Cotton (June Brown). She also begins to grow tired of Duncan's inability to have fun and she starts to ponder whether they are really suited to each other after all. Things reach a climax after Duncan persuades Sharon and her best friend Michelle (Susan Tully) to house a homeless Donna in their flat. Malicious Donna subsequently tries to come between the friends, and when asked to leave, she refuses and claims tenants rights. Sharon blames Duncan for the whole mess, and when he is offered a parish in Wiltshire and wants to proceed with their wedding immediately, Sharon has second thoughts and calls off their engagement. Duncan is heartbroken and proceeds to ask her to marry him several more times, before he finally accepts it is over. Duncan remains in Walford until July 1989, performing priestly duties, including being the priest at Den's memorial service in April, after which he is not seen again. Gerry Fairweather Gerry Fairweather, played by Jason Watkins, is a yuppie estate agent who frequents the Dagmar Winebar. Magda Czajkowski (Kathryn Apanowicz) asks him to help her find a property in Walford, but the manager of the Dagmar, Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), blames him and his type for the gentrification of the East End. Gerry often infuriates Angie with sexist and rude remarks, and when he, his brother, and his friends are having their Christmas party in the Dagmar, she snaps and punches Gerry in the face, knocking him to the floor. Gerry threatens to sue the Dagmar, until Angie's daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) makes him see how humiliated he would feel to stand up in court and confess to being beaten by a woman. Gerry never returns to the Dagmar again. Alan McIntyre Alan McIntyre, played by Pip Miller, first appears in December 1987 as the downstairs neighbour to Sue (Sandy Ratcliff) and Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih). Alan plays his music extremely loudly at all hours, and holds unruly parties. The Osmans are left exhausted and irritable from severe lack of sleep. After much pressuring from Sue, Ali is forced to reason with Alan, but Alan refuses to take their complaints on board. When the noise continues, the Osmans go down to Alan's flat and threaten to complain to the landlord to make him stop, only to find out that Alan is their landlord and that he'd bought their flat. Things then proceed to get infinitely worse for the Osmans at the hands of Alan, when their flat is broken into and their carpet is defecated on. Ali and Alan have several fights and Alan often resorts to racial insults. During one such argument, Roly, Den Watts' (Leslie Grantham) poodle slips his leash and bites Alan in the arm. In 1988, Alan manages to patch up his differences with Ali and he also purchases James Willmott-Brown's (William Boyde) house and converts it into flats. He allows Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) to have first choice of one of the flats in exchange for sex. In October 1989 Ali is going through some money problems, so as always, he turns to gambling to get himself out of debt. However, he picks the wrong opponent in Alan, and after he has a bad loss and is unable to pay his rent, Alan kicks him out of his flat, forcing Ali to return to Cyprus. This is Alan's last appearance.

Beam Piper, about a Pennsylvania police officer who is transported to an alternate world. The series is part of Piper's Paratime series and features many of the characters from that series. The police officer, Calvin Morrison, is picked up by a \\"cross-time flying saucer\\" (really a Paratime conveyor) and dropped off in an alternate Pennsylvania where \\"Aryans\\" (speakers of Indo-European languages) migrated east across Asia and the Pacific Ocean and arrived in North America. This is different from the real world, where they moved west into Europe. Books The Kalvan series consists of eight books, one by Piper (Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen), one by John F. Carr and Roland J. Green (Great Kings' War), one by John F. Carr and Wolfgang Diehr (The Hos-Blethan Affair), and five by John F. Carr alone (Kalvan Kingmaker, Siege of Tarr-Hostigos, Fireseed War, Gunpowder God and Down Styphon!). Races and cultures =Zarthani= The Zarthani are a group of Indo-European descendants who speak a language which belongs to a branch of Indo-European unattested in our timeline, but which has some superficial resemblances to ancient Greek in sounds and word-endings (but not in grammar). The words for \\"father\\" and \\"mother\\" in Zarthani are phadros and mavra (from Proto-Indo-European ' and '). The Zarthani are the inhabitants of the five Great Kingdoms. =Urgothi= The Urgothi are a race of proto-Germans. A thousand years after the arrival of the Ros-Zarthani, the Urgothi arrived from the Cold Lands. They found the coastal areas settled by the Ros-Zarthani and so they moved east and south into the Sea of Grass (the Great Plains) and near the Great River (the Mississippi River). The Urgothi created the Middle Kingdoms, including Grefftscharr. =Ruthani= The Ruthani are the real world Native Americans. They are considered barbarians by the Zarthani, who virtually exterminated the Eastern Ruthani when they arrived in the area to become the Great Kingdoms. Great Kingdoms The North American Atlantic coast is the location of the Great Kingdoms. These kingdoms are inhabited by the Zarthani and are the main location of the series. Originally there were five Great Kingdoms (Hos-Zygros, Hos-Agrys, Hos-Harphax, Hos-Ktemnos, and Hos-Bletha), but at the end of Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen, the new Great Kingdom of Hos-Hostigos is formed. Part way through the series, Kalvan also recognizes a seventh Great Kingdom, Hos- Rathon. Neither Hos-Hostigos nor Hos-Rathon are recognized by any of the other Great Kingdoms. Another Zarthani political entity outside the framework of the Great Kingdoms is Trygath, in the Ohio valley. The Ohio River was not along the Zarthani eastwards migration routes, and Trygath is a semi-barbarous area known for its horse-breeding, and not considered Hos or \\"Great\\". Symbols described in Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen, including the flag of newly established Hos-Hostigos (middle), and the flag of the principality of Hostigos (bottom). =Hos-Hostigos= Hos-Hostigos was formed from the princedoms of Hostigos (also known as Old Hostigos), Nostor, Sask, Beshta, Nyklos, and Ulthor, which were all former princedoms of Hos-Harphax, as well as the new princedom of Sashta. Since Hos-Hostigos was formed out of the territory of the Great Kingdom of Hos-Harphax, it was therefore not recognised as a Great Kingdom by any of the other kingdoms. It was founded after the arrival of Kalvan, who became its first king while dramatically improving the armies of Hos-Hostigos, attempting to eliminate pikemen altogether from the Royal Army (and replace them with musketeers). Kalvan also has started construction of the Great Kings' Highway, which is a two-lane stone road running through the kingdom. The flag of Hos-Hostigos is decreed to be a red keystone (i.e. the symbol of Calvin Morrison's native Pennsylvania) on a dark green field. Hostigos The princedom of Hostigos, also known as Old Hostigos, is the first princedom of the kingdom of Hos-Hostigos founded by Kalvan. At the time of Kalvan's arrival, Hostigos consisted of all of Centre County, southern Clinton County, and Lycoming County, Pennsylvania south of the Bald Eagle Mountains and was ruled by Prince Ptosphes. Its flag is a blue halberd-head on a red field. After Kalvan married Ptosphes' daughter Rylla, Kalvan became heir to Old Hostigos. Hostigos' capital (and the capital of Hos-Hostigos) is Hostigos Town (soon to become Hostigos City, built on the site of real-world Bellefonte, Pennsylvania). Notable castles include Tarr-Hostigos, the home of Prince Ptosphes, which defends Hostigos Town. Sask Sask, consisting of Blair and parts of Clearfield, Huntington, and Bedford Counties in Pennsylvania, is one of Old Hostigos' former enemies ruled by the gluttonous Prince Sarrask. After the extremely bloody Battle of Fyk and the capture of Sarrask, Sask becomes an important tool in Kalvan's war against Styphon's House. Sask's capital is Sask Town (on the site of real-world Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania), and its flag is a golden-rayed sun on a green field. Nostor To the north-east of Hostigos, Nostor‚Äîconsisting of Tioga and parts of Northumberland, Lycoming and Montour Counties to the forks of the Susquehanna‚Äîis another one of Old Hostigos' former enemies. At the time of Kalvan's arrival, Nostor was ruled by the cruel Prince Gormoth and was to be the main arm of the Styphon's House attack on Hostigos. After the defeats at the siege of Tarr-Dombra and the Battle of Fitra (aka \\"that Dralm-damned battle,\\" fought in heavy fog), Hostigi troops invaded and burned much of southern Nostor, leading to an free-for-all civil war in Nostor. Soon after the formation of Hos-Hostigos, the civil war ended when Gormoth was killed and replaced by Prince Pheblon, who agreed to join Hos-Hostigos. Nostor's capital is Nostor Town (near real-world Hughesville, Pennsylvania), and its flag is an orange lily on a black field. Beshta Beshta is located in the Besh (Juniata) River Valley, south-east of Old Hostigos and was ruled by Prince Baltar when Kalvan arrived in Hostigos. Its colors are black and pale yellow. Beshta was set to scavenge plunder from the Nostori and Saski invasion of Hostigos when Kalvan arrived, and Balthar sent his brother Balthames to aid Sarrask at the Battle of Fyk. After Balthames' tactical blunder led to victory for Hostigos, Balthar was forced to accept the lordship of King Kalvan and enter into the new kingdom of Hos-Hostigos. After Balthar's betrayal at the Battle of Tenebra, Balthar was executed and replaced by Prince Phrames. Sashta The princedom of Sashta was created out of eastern Sask, western Beshta, and southern Hostigos by order of King Kalvan as a means of keeping Balthar's brother, Balthames from causing any trouble or from wielding any real power. Nyklos Nyklos is located north-west of Old Hostigos and consists of Potter and McKean County, Pennsylvania. Nyklos is ruled by Prince Armanes and a truly voluntarily princedom of the new kingdom of Hos- Hostigos. Ulthor Ulthor is a voluntary princedom of Hos-Hostigos and is located in the north-western corner of Hos-Hostigos and contains the only port in the kingdom (real world Erie). =Hos-Harphax= Hos-Harphax is the original Great Kingdom of the princedoms that joined to form Hos-Hostigos. Hos-Harphax is one of the older Great Kingdoms and was created when the trading city of Harphax City at the mouth of the Susquehanna River began to exert its influence on the other cities, towns, and villages upstream from Harphax City. At the beginning of the Kalvan series, Hos-Harphax includes the territory of real-world Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and southern New Jersey, and is ruled by Great King Kaiphranos, who dies in Kalvan Kingmaker. =Hos-Ktemnos= Hos-Ktemnos has one of the best militaries in the Great Kingdoms, consisting of the Sacred Squares. Hos-Ktemnos is located in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina and is the site of the city of Balph, the headquarters of Styphon's House. =Hos-Bletha= Hos-Bletha is the southernmost Great Kingdom (consisting of real world Florida and Georgia) and was originally a part of Hos-Ktemnos. =Hos-Agrys= Hos Agrys is based in New York state, northern New Jersey, and southwestern Quebec, with its capital at Agrys City (Manhattan Island). =Hos-Zygros= Includes New England, most of Quebec, and part of eastern Ontario. The capital, Zygros City, is on the site of the real-world city of Quebec. Middle Kingdoms The Middle Kingdoms are located in central North America. They include Grefftscharr, a major trading city, Rathon, and Dorg. Rathon was later recognized by Great King Kalvan as the seventh Great Kingdom of Hos-Rathon. =Grefftscharr= Grefftscharr is a Kingdom centered around a major trading city in the location of our Chicago and strongest of the Middle Kingdoms. In the Kalvan series, Paratime Police Chief Verkan Vall establishes a cover of being from Grefftscharr when he helps Kalvan. Grefftscharr covers the area of Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Western Ohio and Southern Ontario around the Great Lakes. Styphon's House Styphon's House is the temple of the god Styphon, originally a minor healer god, but who rose to prominence when his priests gained a monopoly control on the manufacture of gunpowder, and began to actively intervene in politics and finance. The main temple of Styphon's House is in the city of Balph, located in the Great Kingdom of Hos-Ktemnos. =Holy Order of the Zarthani Knights= The Holy Order of the Zarthani Knights is one of the two military arms of Styphon's House. The Knights defend the Great Kingdoms of Hos-Ktemnos and Hos-Bletha from the barbarians of the Sastragath. The Knights are similar to the real world's crusading orders. The Knights are divided up into Lances, which are then combined into Wedges. =Styphon's Own Guard= Styphon's Own Guard is the other military branch of Styphon's House. The soldiers in this military wear red armor and have been known to kill friendly soldiers who try to flee the battlefield. The Great Kings' War The Great Kings' War is the war between Great King Kalvan and Styphon's House. The war also involves the pro-Styphon Great Kingdoms of Hos- Harphax and Hos-Ktemnos and the Pro-Kalvan/Anti-Styphon forces of Hos-Rathon and the Urgothi \\"barbarians\\" led by Warlord Ranjar Sargos. The war is to some extent a continuation of the Hostigos War of Unification (shown in Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen). The war begins in the book Great Kings' War. =Battles and Campaigns= Great Kings' War * The Battle of Chothros Heights (Kalvan victory) -- The battle where Kalvan utterly defeated the Harphaxi Royal Army and destroyed three lances of Zarthani Knights. * The Battle of Tenebra (Styphon's House victory) -- The battle where the Styphoni (led by Grand Master Soton), defeated the Hostigi army led by Prince Ptosphes because of the treachery of Balthar of Beshta * The Battle of Phyrax (Kalvan victory) -- The extremely bloody battle in which Kalvan repulsed the Styphoni Holy Host from Hostigos after the Battle of Tenebra.

One type of origin myth is the cosmogonic myth, which describes the creation of the world. However, many cultures have stories set after the cosmogonic myth, which describe the origin of natural phenomena and human institutions within a preexisting universe. In Graeco- Roman scholarship, the terms etiological myth and aition (from the Ancient Greek Œ±·º¥œÑŒπŒøŒΩ, \\"cause\\") are sometimes used for a myth that explains an origin, particularly how an object or custom came into existence. Nature of origin myths Every origin myth is a tale of creation: origin myths describe how some reality came into existence.Eliade, p. 21 In many cases, origin myths also justify the established order by explaining that it was established by sacred forces (see section on \\"Social function\\" below). The distinction between cosmogonic myths and origin myths is not clear-cut. A myth about the origin of some part of the world necessarily presupposes the existence of the world‚Äîwhich, for many cultures, presupposes a cosmogonic myth. In this sense, one can think of origin myths as building upon and extending their cultures' cosmogonic myths. In fact, in traditional cultures, the recitation of an origin myth is often prefaced with the recitation of the cosmogonic myth.Eliade, pp. 21-24 In some academic circles, the term \\"myth\\" properly refers only to origin and cosmogonic myths. For example, many folklorists reserve the label \\"myth\\" for stories about creation. Traditional stories that do not focus on origins fall into the categories of \\"legend\\" and \\"folk tale\\", which folklorists distinguish from myth.Segal, p. 5 According to historian Mircea Eliade, for many traditional cultures, nearly every sacred story qualifies as an origin myth. Traditional humans tend to model their behavior after sacred events, seeing their life as an \\"eternal return\\" to the mythical age. Because of this conception, nearly every sacred story describes events that established a new paradigm for human behavior, and thus nearly every sacred story is a story about a creation.See, for example, Eliade, pp. 17-19 Social function An origin myth often functions to justify the current state of affairs. In traditional cultures, the entities and forces described in origin myths are often considered sacred. Thus, by attributing the state of the universe to the actions of these entities and forces, origin myths give the current order an aura of sacredness: \\"Myths reveal that the World, man, and life have a supernatural origin and history, and that this history is significant, precious, and exemplary.\\"Eliade, p. 19 Many cultures instil the expectation that people take mythical gods and heroes as their role models, imitating their deeds and upholding the customs they established: > When the missionary and ethnologist C. Strehlow asked the Australian Arunta > why they performed certain ceremonies, the answer was always: \\"Because the > ancestors so commanded it.\\" The Kai of New Guinea refused to change their > way of living and working, and they explained: \\"It was thus that the Nemu > (the Mythical Ancestors) did, and we do likewise.\\" Asked the reason for a > particular detail in a ceremony, a Navaho chanter answered: \\"Because the > Holy People did it that way in the first place.\\" We find exactly the same > justification in the prayer that accompanies a primitive Tibetan ritual: \\"As > it has been handed down from the beginning of the earth‚Äôs creation, so must > we sacrifice. ‚Ä¶ As our ancestors in ancient times did‚Äîso do we now.\\" Eliade, > pp. 6‚Äì7 Founding myths unite people and tend to include mystical events along the way to make \\"founders\\" seem more desirable and heroic. Ruling monarchs or aristocracies may allege descent from mythical founders/gods/heroes in order to legitimate their control. For example: Julius Caesar and his relatives claimed Aeneas (and through Aeneas, the goddess Venus) as an ancestor. Founding myth The Dispute of Minerva and Neptune ( 1689 or 1706) by Ren√©- Antoine Houasse, depicting the founding myth of Athens A \\"founding myth\\" or etiological myth (Greek aition) explains either: * the origins of a ritual or of the founding of a city * the ethnogenesis of a group presented as a genealogyHerwig Wolfram, The History of the Goths, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr., especially \\"Gothic history as historical ethnography\\", 1988:1-18. with a founding father and thus of a nation (natio, \\"birth\\") * the spiritual origins of a belief, philosophy, discipline, or idea - presented as a narrative A founding myth may serve as the primary exemplum, as the myth of Ixion was the original Greek example of a murderer rendered unclean by his crime, who needed cleansing (catharsis) of his impurity. Founding myths feature prominently in Greek mythology. \\"Ancient Greek rituals were bound to prominent local groups and hence to specific localities\\", Walter Burkert has observed,Burkert, Homo Necans (1972) 1983:83. \\"i.e. the sanctuaries and altars that had been set up for all time\\". Thus Greek and Hebrew founding myths established the special relationship between a deity and local people, who traced their origins from a hero and authenticated their ancestral rights through the founding myth. Greek founding myths often embody a justification for the ancient overturning of an older, archaic order, reformulating a historical event anchored in the social and natural world to valorize current community practices, creating symbolic narratives of \\"collective importance\\"Myth as \\"narratives of collective importance\\" is often part of the definition of myth, both Greek and other; see Walter Burkert, Structure and history in Greek mythology and ritual, 1982:23; Jan N. Bremmer, Interpretations of Greek mythology, \\"What is a Greek myth?\\" 1987:1; Mark P. O. Morford and Robert J. Lenardon, Classical Mythology 1999:12. enriched with metaphor in order to account for traditional chronologies, and constructing an etiology considered to be plausible among those with a cultural investment.These structures of Greek foundation myths within their historical and cultural contexts, and the particular example of the founding of Cyrene, are analysed, in terms first laid out by Georges Dum√©zil, by Claude Calame, Myth and History in Ancient Greece: the symbolic creation of a colony rev. tr. of Mythe et histoire dans l'antiquit√© grecque, 2003. In the Greek view, the mythic past had deep roots in historic time, its legends treated as facts, as Carlo Brillante has noted,Brillante, \\"Myth and history: the historical interpretation of myth\\" in L. Edmunds, Approaches to Greek Myth (1991, pp. 91-140. its heroic protagonists seen as links between the \\"age of origins\\" and the mortal, everyday world that succeeded it. A modern translator of Apollonius' Argonautica has noted, of the many aitia embedded as digressions in that Hellenistic epic, that \\"crucial to social stability had to be the function of myths in providing explanations, authorization or empowerment for the present in terms of origins: this could apply, not only to foundations or charter myths and genealogical trees (thus supporting family or territorial claims) but also to personal moral choices.\\"Peter Green, Introduction to Argonautika, expanded ed. 2007, p. 15. In the period after Alexander the Great expanded the Hellenistic world, Greek poetry‚ÄîCallimachus wrote a whole work simply titled Aitia‚Äîis replete with founding myths. Simon Goldhill employs the metaphor of sedimentation in describing Apollonius' laying down of layers \\"where each object, cult, ritual, name, may be opened... into a narrative of origination, and where each narrative, each event, may lead to a cult, ritual, name, monument.\\"Goldhill, \\"The paradigms of epic: Apollonius Rhodius and the examples of the past\\", in The Poet's Voice: Essays on Poetics and Greek Literature (1991), ch. 5, pp. 284-333, noted in Peter Green 2007, note on Argonautica I.1070-77, p. 226. A notable example is the myth of the foundation of Rome‚Äîthe tale of Romulus and Remus, which Virgil in turn broadens in his Aeneid with the odyssey of Aeneas and his razing of Lavinium, and his son Iulus's later relocation and rule of the famous twins' birthplace Alba Longa, and their descent from his royal line, thus fitting perfectly into the already established canon of events. Similarly, the Old Testament's story of the Exodus serves as the founding myth for the community of Israel, telling how God delivered the Israelites from slavery and how they therefore belonged to him through the Covenant of Mount Sinai.Kenton L. Sparkes, Genre Criticism, in Thomas Dozeman (ed), \\"Methods for Exodus\\", CUP, 2010, p.73. During the Middle Ages, founding myths of the medieval communes of northern Italy manifested the increasing self-confidence of the urban population and the will to find a Roman origin, however tenuous and legendary. In 13th-century Padua, when each commune looked for a Roman founder - and if one was not available, invented one‚Äîa legend had been current in the city, attributing its foundation to the Trojan Antenor. Roberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:18. Larger-than-life heroes continue to bolster the origin-myths of many newer nations and societies. In modern-era colonial contexts, waves of individuals and groups come to the fore in popular history as shaping and exemplifying the ideals of a group: explorers followed by conquerors followed by developers/exploiters. Note for example the conquistadors of the Iberian empires, the bandeirantes in Brazil, the coureurs des bois in Canada, the Cossacks and the promyshlenniki in Siberia and in Alaska, the bands of pioneers in the central and western United States, and the voortrekkers in Southern Africa. Foundation stories Foundational stories are accounts of the development of cities and nations. A foundational story represents the view that the creation of the city is a human achievement. Human control and the removal of wild, uncontrolled nature is underlined. There are two versions of foundational stories: civilization story and degradation story.Allen, John; Doreen B. Massey, Michael Pryke, Unsettling Cities Routledge 1999 p. 141 Civilization stories take a view of nature as dangerous and wild. The development of the city is seen as a successful distancing of humans from nature. Nature is locked out, and humans take pride in doing so successfully. In 1984 the geographer Yi-Fu Tuan suggested ranking cities according to their distance to natural rhythms and cycles. Degradation stories (also called pollution stories) take a different stance. The city is seen as spoiling the landscape of the ecological relations that existed before the city was established. There is a sense of guilt for degrading the intact system of nature. In degradation stories true nature only exists outside the city.

He was shot and killed in Salt River on 13 December 2019, in Cape Town, South Africa. His twin brother, Rashaad Staggie, the initial leader of the Hard Livings gang, was killed after being shot and burned alive in Salt River in 1996 by members of the vigilante group PAGAD. The Staggie brothers were killed in the same street, London Road. In 2003, Rashied Staggie was sentenced to jail after he was convicted for ordering the gang rape of a 17-year-old girl who had turned state witness against him. Staggie was sentenced to 15 years for kidnapping and rape. In 2004, he was convicted of burglary from the Faure police armoury and sentenced to 13 years in prison. The two sentences were served concurrently. In May 2013 the Western Cape department of correctional services announced that Staggie would be released on parole for good behaviour in late September 2013. Staggie has been called \\"one of the last of the Cape Flats' OG's (old gangsters)\\" and through his tenure, the Hard Livings gang had grown internationally, even being interviewed by the BBC. The Staggie brothers were the main subjects in a BBC documentary called Beloved Country - Cape of Fear. It is through this documentary that the brothers got international attention. Early years Rashied was born in the Cape Town suburb of Mooirivier in 1961. The Group Areas Act created forced removals of coloured peoples from so called white areas to a less desirable part of town. The Cape Flats became a place where more than a million displaced coloured and black people were relocated. Rashied's family were moved to Manenberg, poverty stricken and without access to proper infrastructure and services. Due to the pressures of this poverty and hard living, Rashied and his brother Rashaad resorted to petty crime for survival. After 1994 he stayed in Boston, Bellville, in the Western Cape South Africa.  Criminal career By the time the twins were teenagers they were active drug dealers and were able to make some money. As they got older they became more aggressive and influential in the Cape Town underworld. By the 1990s the twins were notorious gang leaders and their gang the Hard Livings had members all around the Cape Peninsula. The Hard Livings gang participated in a range of crimes such as armed robbery, dealing of guns and drug distribution. The Hard Livings had clashes with rival gangs the Americans and the Mongrols. Under the rule of Rashied Staggie, the Hard Livings took part in violent gang wars that led to a bloodbath in the streets of Cape Town. Death On the morning of Friday, 13 December 2019, Rashied Staggie was sitting in a friend's Toyota Corolla sedan outside his home in the area of Salt River, Cape Town when two assailants approached the vehicle and shot at him numerous times. He was confirmed dead on arrival at the nearby Groote Schuur Hospital. Staggie was 58 years old. According to an unnamed officer at the scene, the car was \\"riddled with bullets\\", but the driver of the car escaped unharmed after fleeing for safety. Staggie's daughter, Ingrid Carolus, came out of their house two hours after the shooting, screaming: \\"He's dead, he's dead!\\" The shooting occurred after another Hard Livings leader, Ballie Tips, was shot and killed in Mitchells Plain the previous night. Staggie was killed in the same street, London Road, where his twin brother and fellow gangster, Rashaad Staggie was shot and burned alive by People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) members in 1996.

When World War II occurred, she was again re- commissioned into service, providing goods to units in the various oceans of the world. Calamares (No. 3662) was built in 1913 by Workman, Clark and Co., Belfast, Northern Ireland; chartered by the U.S. Army from United Fruit Co.; transferred to the navy 1 April 1918; outfitted at New York; commissioned 10 April 1918, Commander C. L. Arnold in command; and reported to the U.S. Cruiser and Transport Force.  World War I North Atlantic operations  Between April and October 1918 Calamares made five voyages to France as her part of the Navy's vast responsibility to transport to the American Expeditionary Force reinforcements, munitions, and supplies. On 11 October 1918 she was transferred to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service at New York, and converted to a refrigerator ship.  End-of-war activity  Calamares carried perishable provisions on three voyages to France from 8 November 1918 to 12 March 1919, and then was reassigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force for service as a troop carrier. On five transatlantic voyages between 25 March and 17 August Calamares brought home more than 10,000 troops from St. Nazaire and Brest. Calamares was decommissioned 18 September 1919, and returned to her civilian peacetime operations.  Reactivation for duty in World War II  World War II required the services of every available ship, and Calamares was once more called. On 12 December 1941 the veteran ship was reacquired by the navy, classified AF-18, and converted to a provisions storeship. She was recommissioned on 10 April 1943, Lieutenant Commander D. R. Phoebus, USNR, in command, and reported to the U.S. Pacific Fleet.  Pacific Theatre operations  Destined for a dual role as food carrier and issuing ship, Calamares cleared San Francisco, California, 23 April 1943 for Noumea, New Caledonia, where from 13 May to 11 June she issued provisions to the fleet units operating from this headquarters of the South Pacific. In June, she sailed to Auckland, New Zealand, for fresh stores, and from Noumea Calamares made a cruise of the South Pacific bases, supplying navy and army forces ashore. Returning to San Francisco in August, the storeship operated between the west coast and Pearl Harbor until 22 November, when she sailed for the South Pacific again, carrying Christmas delicacies as well as the usual stores for ships based on Funafuti, Ellice Islands, and Noum√©a. On 1 January 1944 Calamares reported to Commander, Service Force U.S. 7th Fleet, at Sydney, Australia, and until June 1945, provided vital logistic support for operations in New Guinea and the Philippines, carrying provisions from Australia, and on two occasions from San Francisco, to the operation areas.

Astwith is in the parish of Ault Hucknall. For many decades it was a part of the manor of Stainsby, which was known as Steinesbei in the Domesday survey (1087). Apparently there is no mention of Astwith, otherwise spelt Estewayt, Est(th)wayt, Estweit and Eswheyt, by name until the 13th century. This extract was taken from a small book found in the Chesterfield library written by J.E.Milner a local schoolmaster: \\"There is no mention of it (Astwith) until the 1200s when Adeluga, widow of Robert le Sauvage, released among other bequests, one messuage and one bovate of land at Estewyte to John de Sauvage and his heirs. It would also suggest that between the two claims for the name's meaning: a. the ford by the ash trees b. The East ford the latter seems the more likely. The ford, now a bridge, is on the lane from Stainsby, but east of where, remains a puzzle.\\" The Savage family are believed to have held Astwith among other local lands until 1593, when Bess of Hardwick purchased them from the Lord Chancellor and Auditor for the sum of ¬£9,500. Following her death, her son William 1st Lord Cavendish, had a survey of all his lands carried out by William Senior in 1609/1610. At this time Astwith is recorded with a total acreage of and seven named residents. These were Matthewe Foxe, Richard Carman, Henrie Frithe, John Tacie, John Turner, Robert Wainwrighte, Humphrie Fretwell. These residents had holdings varying in size from to just over . The common extended to , and the cunygre to a further . Unlike other local villages which were built along a main street with tofts on either side, Astwith was ranged along the edge of the common. By the time of the 1839 Tithe Awards, the village had grown to 17 households, although the acreage farmed had remained the same in total. Communications to local towns had been improved by the development of the turnpike road between Tibshelf and Temple Normanton in the 1820s. Access roads into the village from the turnpike were improved and the housing centre of the village moved to this access road. The village remained in the ownership of the Dukes of Devonshire until 1959, when it was passed to the National Trust as part of the death duty settlement of the 10th Duke. Most of the village is now in private ownership, after the National Trust began to dispose of its holding of residential buildings in the 1970s. The Trust retains much of the land which is farmed by the one working farm in the village or by the farm at Hardwick Park within the grounds of Hardwick Hall which they run in partnership with the farmer. Many of the properties in the village remain under building covenants held by the Trust. The photograph looks east and shows Manor Farm Cottage on the right and parts of Manor Farm and The Swallows on the left. There are around 20 homes in Astwith today. There is no room for six bedroom Swiss cottages. Astwith is one of 27 conservation areas within the council area of Bolsover District Council. In October 2010 the Local Conservation Plan for Astwith was approved by Bolsover District Council and a copy of the report can be viewed on their website www.bolsover.gov.uk.

The film tells the story of three women in Tel Aviv whose intersecting lives paint a pessimistic portrait of Israeli secular life. Batya, a waitress at weddings, comes across a mute child who seemingly emerges from the sea. Keren, a bride whose wedding Batya worked at, breaks her leg climbing out of bathroom stall and ruins her dream honeymoon in the process. And Joy, a Filipina domestic, attends to her employer with whom she struggles to communicate. Poetic imagery draws connections between the lives of these women, all of whom find solace in the sea. Jellyfish was the winner of the 2007 Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, an official selection of the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and an official selection of the 2008 Telluride Film Festival. The film stars Sarah Adler and Gera Sandler. The DVD release date was September 30, 2008. Themes The film begins and ends with the little girl in the presence of the film's main character, Batya, at sea. Batya is a young woman who carries herself with an extremely independent nature. She works as a waitress at a wedding catering company. The film jumps from past to present day, showing flashbacks to Batya's childhood amidst her parents‚Äô divorce and father's infidelity at the beach. Batya seems to identify with the toddler she finds coming out of the sea, although it is unclear whether or not the toddler is real, or a figment of Batya's imagination. However, this is not a crucial element of the film. The film ends with her following the tot into the sea, almost drowning. Instead her friend Malka pulls her out. She is revived, appearing relieved to find that she still has her friend. Another character, Keren, is a new bride whose wedding Batya works at. Although the film follows the story lines of both Batya and Keren, they never intertwine. As the film develops, Keren navigates through feelings of mistrust and containment during her honeymoon. After breaking her leg at her wedding, she is unable to walk and relies on her new husband to carry her when leaving the hotel room. He smokes on the stairwell near their hotel room and meets a mysterious women who changes his perspective and causes argument between him and Keren. Critical reception The film received generally positive reviews from Western critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 88% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 49 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 68 out of 100, based on 11 reviews.

History  Upon his death in 1810 at Fairview, Duckett left the estate to his son-in-law, Captain William Duckett Bowie. The will stipulated that William Duckett Bowie and his sons should have Fairview as long as they did not cut down certain trees standing near the house but \\"if the said Bowie, or any of his children should fell the trees, then the property shall go to my brother, Isaac Duckett.\\" Bowie's son, Governor of Maryland Oden Bowie, was born at Fairview in 1826 and was buried on the grounds in 1894. Fairview in 1936 Fairview was one of the larger slave-holding plantations in the county, having 47 slaves during Oden Bowie's ownership. In the 1980s, land that made up the plantation consisted of a turf farm and woods. The owners of the estate sold most of the land to The Rouse Company who built a housing development that bears the name Fairwood on the site.

History ;Etymology The original village of Auchinairn is derived from Scottish Gaelic * Achadh an Fhe√†rna (silent \\"fh\\") - field of the alders. * Achadh an E√≤rna - field of barley * Achadh an Iarainn - field of iron (it is believed that iron ore was once mined there). ;The village Map of Auchinairn and Bishopbriggs in the early 1900s Auchinairn village originally developed as two distinct areas: Old Auchinairn (The Auld Toon) and New Auchinairn. Old Auchinairn lay to the north side of Auchinairn Road, between what is now Woodhill Road and Letham Drive. It had a school which was built about 1760. New Auchinairn lay approximately between what is now Montrose Terrace and Springfield Avenue. It had a primary school which opened in 1876 and is now the Auchinairn Community Centre. The current primary school building stands on what was Auchinairn United football field. The village was founded by weavers and has housed workers from many different industries around the area, such as the mines, the railway and the quarry. In 1836 Auchinairn Village‚Äôs population stood at 284 compared with neighbouring Bishopbriggs population which stood at 175, but the opening of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in 1842 brought new industries to the area and as a result of this, housing was required for the workers. For many years Auchinairn was a vibrant community with a co- operative, a post office, several small shops, a public house, a community hall and a mission hall. The Free Church mission which met in that hall was granted full church status in 1865. The members built a church on Springfield Road, Bishopbriggs. It is now part of Springfield Cambridge Church. Auchinairn had a brass band and a football team. Quoits was another popular activity. Littlehill Golf Course was designed by James Braid and opened in 1923. Harry Varden played there in 1925. Club professional, Tom Wilson, was once overnight leader in the British Open.

Although viewed today as part of the town of Bishopbriggs, Auchinairn still has a strong sense of community and its own identity. There were five villages: Auchinairn; Bishopbriggs; Cadder; Jellyhill; and Mavis Valley. All were separated from one another by farmland. In 1938 residents were moved from Auchinairn to council housing in Bishopbriggs. Post Second World War housing development resulted the farmland being built on. In 1964 the district was granted burgh status, and the name ‚ÄòBishopbriggs‚Äô was adopted. Present day Auchinairn has several shops, public houses and restaurants, a primary school and a bowling club. A wide range of activities is offered in the community centre and in the community hall.

Biography At age 21, he became a pilot for a new air taxi company known as TAM ‚Äì T√°xi A√©reo Mar√≠lia. The company began its operation in 1961 with the alliance of 10 young pilots. At the time, they transported cargo and charter passengers between Paran√°, S√£o Paulo, and Mato Grosso. After six years in the company, Amaro left Taxi A√©reo Mar√≠lia. At the same time, it was sold to businessman Orlando Ometto, its headquarters moved to S√£o Paulo, and the company profile changed when it became a courrier company. Upon leaving the company, Amaro, being at ease with personalized service, became an independent pilot. He bought his first airplane, a Cessna 170, and moved with his family to S√£o F√©lix do Araguaia, where he began his first business project and founded Araguaia Transportes A√©reos (ATA). Two years later, the company had 15 airplanes. Captain Amaro‚Äôs reconciliation with TAM took place in 1971, when Ometto asked him to become a minority partner owning 33% of the stocks. At the time, the company was going through a difficult financial period and was only transporting 3000 passengers. The following year, Amaro acquired half of the TAM stock and took over management of the company. He introduced his trademark and began practicing his primary philosophy: ‚ÄúFocus on the client by offering quality service‚Äù. In 1976, TAM - Transportes A√©reos Regionais emerges as a scheduled regional airline, which learned from the experience of TAM - T√°xi A√©reo Mar√≠lia. By then, Amaro owned 67% of the new company.

It is the only township to survive substantially unaltered from amongst the many hundreds that existed across the Scottish Highlands before the Highland Clearances of the late 18th and 19th centuries. The major feature of the museum is the 22 buildings and building remains of the township. Twelve of these buildings are mainly complete, with the remains of the other 10 either needing or undergoing restoration work. Much of this work is carried out by volunteers and enthusiasts like the West of Scotland Dry Stone Walling Association. Also within the of museum grounds are other man-made structures in various condition of repair, including stone dykes, stackyards, stack bases, kailyards, middens, pathways, roads, a corn kiln and evidence of run rig farming methods. The site is open to the public as the Auchindrain Township Open Air Museum between April and September each year. Restored blackhouse Evolution Achadh an Droighinn/Auchindrain is first found in documentary references from the early 16th century. At this time the settlement was clearly an established one. It is not known precisely when the township was initially established, but because of its location on the relatively high and poor ground of the watershed between two rivers, the ‚Äúfield of‚Ä¶.‚Äù in its name, and its nearness to the former township site of Braleckan ‚Äì Br√†igh Leacann, it is suggested that it may very well have been founded through ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù of the Braleckan township as a result of population growth in the late medieval period. From the early 1500s to the 1770s Auchindrain was just another township, one of thousands spread across Scotland. Almost nothing is known about this period other than the identities of successive owners or principal tenants, and the appearance of some of the township‚Äôs people‚Äôs names where they appear in legal documents. In 1776 the Duke of Argyll reacquired the township, the Duke and his Chamberlain (factor) were early enthusiasts for the principles of agricultural improvement. Auchindrain is included in a list from 1779 of all those living on the Duke‚Äôs land. A plan was made in 1789, by the surveyor George Langlands, for the township to be rebuilt and reorganised into crofts as many of the other townships in were. In Auchindrain this was never implemented, possibly because the investment required would not have justified the financial return. In 1875, when Queen Victoria was staying at Inveraray Castle, she visited what she called the ‚Äúprimitive villages‚Äù of Auchindrain and Achnagoul (between here and Inveraray). Management Auchindrain is owned and operated by an independent Scottish Charity known as The Auchindrain Trust. Thirty five years ago the Trustees of Auchindrain in Mid Argyll built a Visitor Centre after its last resident family moved out in the mid 1960s. Until 2010 the township was kept on tick over, with nature mostly prevented from encroaching, the paths kept open but the vast majority of potential visitors driving past. A previous curator, Joanne Howdle, succeeded in getting the museum added to the list of Recognised Collections of national significance, a scheme administered by Museums Galleries Scotland. In 2010 Bob Clark the current Development Manager raised ¬£106,820 in funding given to be applied to the development project. Designations The site is designated as a Conservation Area; it is Category A Listed in its entirety, and its buildings are a Recognised Collection ‚Äì one of only a few collections not held by National Museums and National Galleries of Scotland.

Notable sights Entrance to Auchleven The Gadie Burn runs through Auchleven (Premnay.) Lickleyhead Castle Lickleyhead Castle is thought to have been built in 1560 by William Leith, quite possibly on the site of an earlier structure. It was bought by the Forbes family in 1625: John Forbes added a stair tower on the SW corner, and the 1629 date stone above the main entrance. The castle was sold to the Duff family in 1723, and later to the Lumsdens. In 1922 the castle was sold to Don Guillermo de Landa y Escamdon, the Governor of Mexico City, for his daughter Maria Luz who had married into the Arbuthnott-Leslie family. The castle remains a residence of Clan Leslie.

Sufia Karim Sufia Karim is played by Rani Singh. Sufia makes her first appearance in Walford in 1988, when she moves to Walford with her husband Ashraf (Aftab Sachak) and their children Shireen (Nisha Kapur) and Sohail (Ronnie Jhutti). In 1989 she discovers that Ashraf is having an affair with a woman named Stella (Cindy O'Callaghan). This affair is eventually exposed to the community, leading to the family leaving Walford for Bristol in June 1990. Melody Melody (initially credited as Junior's Girlfiend), played by Lyanne Compton, is introduced in 1988 as the troublesome school friend of Junior Roberts (Aaron Carrington), on whom she has a crush. They are mischievous, doing things such as stealing dogs from their owners and then claiming rewards when they return the dogs, professing to have found them, or charging children to see a free Punch and Judy show. Melody attends the local Brownies, where she is particularly troublesome for the Brown Owl, Marge Green (Pat Coombs). During her time in Walford, Melody is approached by a potential paedophile, who offers her sweets and a ride in his car; Melody responds by biting his hand. She reports the man to the police, but subsequently, her father prohibits her from seeing Junior for a while, though this does not last. Melody is upset when Junior and his family move away in August 1989; they think about running away together, but are unable to set their plan in motion. Junior still visits Melody occasionally and on Halloween 1989, she and Junior dress as ghosts and throw eggs at Dot Cotton (June Brown) for refusing to offer anything desirable during their game of Trick or Treat. Following a chastising from Dot for this, Melody disappears with no explanation. Off- screen, the show acquired a new executive producer, Michael Ferguson, and many characters were dropped. According to writer Colin Brake, the storyline involving Melody and the unruly Brownies was intended to be fun, but references to Brownies behaving badly caused great offence to the Brownie movement, and an official complaint was made and upheld. The broadcasting commission said the EastEnders Brownie episodes \\"came near to parody,\\" were unfair to the Brownies and harmed the Girl Guides' image. The BBC had to make a public apology for the misinterpretation of the movement. Brake has suggested that the mishap was a \\"salutary lesson to those [...] in the script department to be very vigilant in ensuring, as far as possible, that no group or individual was offended by an unintentional slight in a script.\\" Kenny Beale Kenny Beale, played by Michael Attwell, is the older brother of Pauline (Wendy Richard) and Pete Beale (Peter Dean). He was born and raised in Walford, 1941, to Albert and Lou Beale (Anna Wing), where he lived with his family at number 45 Albert Square. Kenny was banished from Walford in 1965, at the age of 24, when his mother caught him in bed with his brother's wife Pat (Pam St. Clement). He went to live in New Zealand, set up a business selling swimming pools, and married a New Zealander named Barbara. He didn't speak to any of his family for five years after emigrating, and after that it was only Pauline who corresponded with him. He returns to Walford in 1988 with his daughter Elizabeth (Lucy Bayler), after his marriage has hit a rocky patch. He visits his ill mother and finds out that he has been named as the father of Pat's younger son, Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). After a month in Walford, he returns to New Zealand, saying goodbye to Simon, whose paternity has come into doubt again. He tells Simon that he hopes he is his father, although it is later revealed that Pat believes Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield) is Simon's father. Kenny remains off-screen following his 1988 departure, suffering a car accident in June 1992, prompting Pauline to travel to New Zealand and care for him. Upon Pauline‚Äôs death in 2006, he sends a wreath to commemorate. It is revealed in CivvyStreet that Kenny is named after his paternal grandfather, Kenneth Beale. Elizabeth Beale Elizabeth Beale, played by Lucy Bayler, was born in New Zealand to Kenny (Michael Attwell) and Barbara Beale, and comes to Walford with Kenny when they visit her sick grandmother Lou (Anna Wing). Elizabeth arrives in Walford with Kenny when Kenny's brother, Pete Beale (Peter Dean), finds out he is not the biological father of Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). Kenny had an affair with Pete's ex-wife, Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement), and could be Simon's father, however, neither of them are Simon's father. Elizabeth begins an unlikely, but brief liaison with her cousin Ian (Adam Woodyatt). She stays with Pete and her aunt, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), when her father returns to New Zealand. She soon angers Ian by flirting with other men, and Pete, who is in a bad mood after arguing with Kathy, throws her out of his house when she tries to bring a friend home to stay. She returns to New Zealand and Kathy contacts Elizabeth and Kenny when Lou dies. Little Ali Osman \\"Little\\" Ali Osman, played by Omer Mustafa Salih, is the second son born to caf√© owners Sue and Ali Osman (Sandy Ratcliff and Nejdet Salih). He is born in March 1988 and is delivered in his parents' flat, 47B Albert Square, by Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Following his parents' split, he and his mother leave Walford in April 1989 but Ali snatches him in May, causing Sue to have a breakdown and be sectioned. Little Ali lives with his father, who struggles as a single parent and employs an unregistered child minder to look after Little Ali while he works. When health visitor Carmel Jackson (Judith Jacob) notices that Little Ali is not being looked after properly, she investigates and finds that the child minder is neglecting the children in her care, leaving them alone all day. Unable to look after his son, Ali sends Little Ali to live with relatives. Ali's financial problems continue and he leaves Walford in October 1989 when he loses his home and business. Little Ali now lives in Northern Cyprus with his father. Brian Wicks Brian Wicks, played by Leslie Schofield, is the second husband of Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement). He only appears twice on-screen, but the character's history is heavily intertwined with several other key characters within the series, and he is mentioned regularly for the first three to four years. The character is involved in one of EastEnders most complicated storylines, the paternity of Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). Brian began an affair with Pat around 20 years earlier, while she was married to her first husband, Pete Beale (Peter Dean). During this time Pat became pregnant with her second son Simon, and claimed that Pete was the father. When Pat and Pete eventually divorced, Pat latched on to Brian. They married and Brian adopted Simon, and he and Pat's older child David Wicks (Michael French) both took on Brian's surname. They moved from Walford to Romford, after David was beaten up by Derek Branning (Terence Beesley), for getting his sister Carol (Lindsey Coulson) pregnant resulting in the birth of David and Carol's daughter, Bianca (Patsy Palmer). Brian was mostly absent and used to beat Pat and her children, so she eventually left him after several years and returns to Walford. Pat causes havoc by revealing to Simon that Pete is not his father. Several other men are put in the frame, including Brian, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) and Pete's brother Kenny Beale (Michael Attwell). Furious rows erupt between all concerned, but Pat ominously refuses to divulge the father's true identity. Brian first appears in April 1988. He has been informed that Pat has settled down with Frank Butcher, and is running The Queen Vic pub. Brian is interested in Pat's monetary affairs and their brief reunion is not pleasant. After calling Pat a slag and almost getting into a fight with Frank, Brian leaves. It isn't until a dying Lou Beale (Anna Wing) pressurises Pat in July 1988 to give Simon peace of mind regarding his paternity, that Pat finally reveals that Simon's biological father is Brian, the mentally unstable man Simon grew up assuming was his stepfather. Simon and Brian never appear on-screen together, although later plots imply that they do correspond with each other, despite Simon (who left Walford in December 1990) claiming regularly that he hates him and describing to Frank that growing up with Brian was like \\"living with a nutter\\". Aside from this plot, Brian continues to remain a menacing off-screen presence, continuously pestering Pat for money. Brian isn't seen again until May 1989. Pat has decided that she wants to marry Frank, and to do this she needs to divorce Brian. She meets Brian and asks for the divorce, but he makes it clear that he will only divorce her if she gives him either ¬£1000 or one of Frank's cars as pay-off. Pat has no choice but to get Brian the car. She deceives Frank by claiming that her aunt Mabel's car has been written off and asks if he can provide one for her. Frank agrees to get her the car free of charge. He manages to get hold of a mini, and Pat telephones Brian to tell him of her success. Although he is slightly annoyed that the car he is getting is only a mini, he nevertheless agrees to give Pat a divorce. In 2006, Brian‚Äôs nephew Kevin Wicks (Phil Daniels) and his stepchildren Deano (Matt Di Angelo) and Carly (Kellie Shirley) come to live with Pat. David Samuels Dr David Samuels is played by Christopher Reich. David first appears in April 1988 as Dr. Legg's (Leonard Fenton) nephew who is visiting from Israel. David has fallen on hard times in Israel. He was being shunned by the locals because he had treated a wounded terrorist, who was guilty of bombing a bus that had killed his best friend. He had also split from his fianc√©e Ruth (Nitza Saul), and wanted a new start. When his mother Hester (Barbara Shelley) comes to visit Harold she asks him if it would be possible for David to join him in England for a while. Harold thinks it is a great idea, and David comes over the following month. On his arrival, he tends to Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) when he is attacked. David helps his uncle out with the practice and lives in the flat above the surgery. Despite being extremely fond of each other, the new partners argue about almost everything. David wants to modernise the surgery and bring in computers, but Harold is set in his ways and is opposed to any obvious changes. Harold also disagrees with David's friendship with their secretary, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Particularly when the two get drunk one night at a Christmas party, leave together and end up in the same bed. David awakes the next day not remembering a thing, but is reassured when Michelle informs him that he had been too drunk to do anything untoward anyway. Harold is not convinced however, and berates David for the degradation he'd brought upon himself and the surgery. Later David and Harold fall out over Harold's treatment of patients. David is appalled that Harold has decided to lie to Colin and withhold vital information from him about his depleting health. He is also angry over Harold's lack of persistence concerning Donna Ludlow's (Matilda Ziegler) drug problem, and later blames himself for not providing sufficient help following her suicide in May 1989. Soon after David has stern words for Harold when he fails to diagnose Vicki Fowler with meningitis. Their altercation leads to Harold retiring and leaving the running of the surgery to David. However, David's contemporary methods alienate the older residents of Walford and after much protesting Harold eventually decides to rethink his retirement. David initially tries to fight this, but in August 1989, Ruth, arrives in the Square to reconcile with David, and she makes David and Harold realise how petty their arguing has become. The two doctors manage to patch up their differences, whilst David and Ruth put their past behind them and get back together. The following month they decide to marry and return to Israel together. It is revealed in January 1990 that David and Ruth got married in Israel and Doctor Legg attended the wedding. In 2019, David contacts Dot Branning (June Brown) from Israel to say that he cannot make it back to England for his uncle's funeral. Matthew Jackson Matthew Jackson, played by Steven Hartley, is the manager of the local music store. He is first seen on screen in May 1988 as a new love interest for the social worker, Carmel Roberts (Judith Jacob). Matthew had had an unhappy childhood. His mother Lynne Jackson (Patricia Ford) had become pregnant at 16 and after bringing him up for 15 years, she had been forced to put him into custody. Matthew was fostered by another family and he had subsequently refused all contact with his mother and rather resented her for abandoning him. Actor Steven Hartley (pictured in 2009) was cast in the role of Matthew. Matthew is initially a kind, easy-going man. Everyone loves him, except Carmel's brother, Darren (Gary McDonald), who objects to his sister dating him because he is white. His racial hatred eventually leads to Carmel kicking him out of her flat and Matthew later moves in instead. Darren subsequently flees Walford, leaving Carmel and Matthew to look after his two children, Junior (Aaron Carrington) and Aisha (Aisha Jacob). Carmel is really besotted with Matthew, so when he proposes marriage in November that year, she gleefully accepts. Carmel wants to invite Lynne to the wedding, but Matthew is totally opposed to the idea. His ire rises at her mere mention, but Carmel pursues it, which causes Matthew to blow his top and viciously scream at her. Carmel is left dumbstruck at the sudden outburst, but this is only a small taster of what is to come in the following months. The two marry in January 1989, but the day is ruined when Matthew sees his mother is in attendance. Carmel had got in contact with her, thinking that Matthew would be pleased to have her at the wedding. She is wrong and Matthew is furious. After shunning their reception party, he threatens to pack his things and leave. Carmel cannot understand his reaction and when she attempts to stop him leaving he grabs her by the throat, holds her up against a wall and berates her for her interference. Carmel is petrified, and upon seeing her fear Matthew immediately releases her and begins apologising profusely for his violent outburst. Carmel is shaken, but is convinced that his apology is sincere, so she drops the matter. Things do not go much better for the newly weds in the following months. Matthew is finding it increasingly difficult to put up with Junior's presence in his life. The two regularly clash and this in turn causes major animosity between him and Carmel. This eventually evokes Matthew back into violence and he punches Carmel in the face one night during an argument about Junior. Carmel is left with a heavily bruised face, but yet again a tearful Matthew manages to convince her to forgive him. Matthew's behaviour continues to alternate from contrite and caring to hot-tempered and violent, for seemingly no reason. Nevertheless, Carmel remains with him as she believes she can help him combat and contain his rage. Despite his despicable behaviour, she still deeply loves him. It isn't long before Junior had works out why his aunt is constantly covered in bruises. He tries to put a stop to it by informing various people about the abuse, which doesn't impress Matthew and this only makes his temper worse. Matthew begins to grow irrationally jealous over Carmel's friendship with Dr. David Samuels (Christopher Reich), and during a family meal one night, he begins to get violent towards her in front of Junior. In a desperate bid to protect his petrified aunt, Junior stabs Matthew with a kitchen knife. Matthew spends time in hospital, but once again he manages to convince Carmel that he has changed and she allows him to come home when he recovers. She tries to get Matthew to seek professional help, but Matthew is appalled by the idea, and true to form, he begins smashing up the house and threatening her with more violence. This is the last straw for Carmel and she wisely decides to end their relationship. She throws Matthew out and he leaves Walford in July 1989. Cindy Beale Cindy Beale (also Williams) is played by Michelle Collins from 1988 to 1990 and again from 1992 to 1998. Cindy has an eye for the lotharios of Walford and despite trying to settle down repeatedly with the more reliable Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), she is unable to remain faithful to him. She has a selfish streak, and is often more concerned about her own needs than her family's. She often lies and schemes, particularly where men are concerned. Ricky Butcher Ricky Butcher is played by Sid Owen. Introduced as a school boy in 1988, Ricky is one of the longest-running, male protagonists to feature in EastEnders. Owen originally left the role in 2000 to pursue a music career. However, he reprised the role in 2002 before being axed by producer Louise Berridge in 2004. In 2008, producer Diederick Santer reintroduced the character for a third time, along with his wife Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Ricky is portrayed as unintelligent, simplistic, easily led and bossed around by dominant personalities. On 26 February 2011, it was announced that Owen would take a temporary break from the show. The character exited on 19 July 2011, returning five months later on 13 December 2011. Ricky left EastEnders on 17 January 2012. Ricky made a brief return to EastEnders in June 2012. Diane Butcher Diane Butcher is played by Sophie Lawrence. Diane appears as a regular character between 1988 and 1991, when Lawrence decided to leave. The character makes several brief returns in 1993, 1994, and 1997. In 2008, Diane returns for the funeral of her father Frank (Mike Reid), and at the end of June 2012 for the wedding of her sister, Janine (Charlie Brooks). Over the years, Diane develops from a rebellious teenager who runs away from home, to a free-spirited single mother having difficulty looking after her young son. In her most recent stint on EastEnders Diane is portrayed as a more mature character than previously seen, settled in France and, in a departure from a character previously depicted as heterosexual, she is stated to be in a long-term relationship with another woman. Gregory Mantel Gregory Mantel is played by Pavel Douglas. Mantel is a well-spoken, sharp-suited gangster, an employee of The Firm. He is introduced in June 1988, as a character claiming to be from \\"Walford Investments\\", who tries to persuade James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde) to let him buy into The Dagmar. When Willmott-Brown refuses, he soon finds that his suppliers are refusing to do business with him. The bar's business suffers dramatically as a result. The Firm financially ruin The Dagmar for the purpose of drawing in its custom for their own wine bar, Strokes, which is in fact a front for illegal gambling reluctantly run by Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Den later uses his Firm connections to arrange for The Dagmar to be firebombed in retaliation to Wilmott-Brown raping Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), which angers Mantel and The Firm's bosses, the unseen Mr. Vinnicombe and Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett). Mantel and Vinnicombe are good friends, and Mantel reports directly to him. Mantel later establishes the Portakabin office on Albert Square as a base of operations for \\"Walford Investments\\". Mantel is also responsible for leading the operation to kill Den, after it is thought that he had grassed up The Firm for the Dagmar fire. Gregory is an intelligent man, and is able to work out the connection between Den and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), and that she might be the key to finding him. He orders that Michelle be tailed, and she was followed to the Walford canal. Mantel then co-ordinates the assassination via a walkie-talkie. Mantel gives the order to shoot Den, but 14 years later it is revealed that his attempt to kill Den was unsuccessful and he promptly returns to Walford in September 2003, and that the body found in the canal in May 1990 was that of Mr Vinnicombe, who had been killed on the orders of Jack Dalton after discovering that Den had survived.

As Benny and Ethel spend more time together, their friendship blossoms into a romance. A very drunk Benny later propositions Ethel, asking her to move in with him. Ethel initially thinks the offer is for a proposal of marriage, but when she realises that his motives are less than honourable she is furious and smashes his Issy Bonn records over his head. When relaying her concerns to her friend Dot Cotton (June Brown), Ethel confesses that she does love Benny, which angers Dot as she feels that Benny is an old pervert and she tells Ethel to stay well clear of him. Ethel and Benny reconcile, and over lunch Benny decides to propose to Ethel, this time for marriage. However, Dot has heard that Benny plans to propose and in a bid to prevent her best friend from accepting, she turns up at their luncheon and brands Ethel stupid for considering marriage, saying she could never be happy with a Jew, as they were \\"different\\". Ethel accuses Dot of anti-Semitism and just to spite Dot, she agrees to marry Benny. However, Ethel becomes unsure when Benny relays all the domestic duties he expects from her. The final straw comes when Benny informs Ethel that her pug Willy will not be able to stay at the manor where he lives, due to a \\"no pets\\" rule. Ethel cannot consider parting with her dog, so the engagement is called off. This is Benny's last appearance on the Square, but a few months later the residents hear news that Benny has died and he has left Ethel ¬£2000 in his will.

A body is wrongly identified as Den's the following year, and Barnes attends the funeral in May 1990. Queenie Price Queenie Price, played by John Labanowski, is an inmate in Dickens Hill prison along with Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). It is revealed that Queenie is on The Firm's payroll, and The Firm believed that Den is trying to frame them. However, after The Firm discover Den is not the informant, Den discovers that it is Queenie. Den stuns Queenie with his discovery, but instead of turning him in to The Firm he uses him to provide information on them. Trevor Kellow Trevor Kellow, played by Peter Doran, is an inmate at Dickens Hill prison. He has been imprisoned on remand for the mugging of an old lady, and though he claims to be innocent, the other prisoners take against him and bully him mercilessly. His solicitor instructs him to plead guilty to the crime to ensure a shorter sentence, but Trevor feels he cannot cope with imprisonment for a crime he didn't commit. His mental health swiftly deteriorates, and shortly after, he is found dead in his cell, having hanged himself on the morning of his trial. Victor Hampton Victor Hampton, played by Michael Brogan, is an inmate at Dickens Hill prison. He is married to Gillie, but the marriage has come under strain due to Vic's continuous infidelities. He becomes severely depressed and is segregated from the other prisoners when he is tested and told that he is HIV positive. However Gillie is supportive, and promises to stay with him. Victor is the first character in EastEnders to be diagnosed as HIV positive, paving the way for the controversial virus to feature in a storyline surrounding a much higher profile character ‚Äì Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) ‚Äì a couple of years later. Gillie Hampton Gillie Hampton, played by Clare James, is the wife of prisoner Victor Hampton (Michael Brogan). Their marriage has come under strain due to Vic's adulteries. Gillie visits and asks him to get tested for any STDs he may have. Vic eventually does and it turns out he is HIV positive. Gillie (who tests negative for the virus) is supportive, and promises to stay with him no matter what. Guido Smith Guido Smith, played by Nicholas Donovan, is first seen in October 1988 as a business contact of the graphic designer, Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). Over subsequent meetings, allegedly to discuss business, it becomes clear that Colin and Guido are attracted to each other. Eventually Colin plucks up the courage to make a pass at him, but has his hopes dashed when he discovers that Guido is already involved with another man named Des. After seeking the advice of his friends in Walford, Colin decides to play things cool with Guido, by not actively chasing him and instead becoming the chased. The plan works and it isn't long before Guido has invited himself back to Colin's to spend the night. Soon after, Guido splits with his boyfriend and moves in with Colin. Colin has been scarred by past relationships, so he is adamant that he is not going to be used by Guido as a mere stop gap. He wants assurances that the relationship has a future and he begins to demand more commitment from Guido. Guido on the other hand, is far more relaxed and wants to take the relationship one stage at a time. Petty arguments erupt between the pair, instigated by Colin, whose demeanour is constantly changing from mild-mannered to belligerent, for no apparent reason. Guido is left bemused by this, but eventually Colin divulges that he is suffering from poor health and the worry is having a negative effect on his behaviour. Guido manages to persuade Colin to get a check up, after which it is revealed that he has been suffering from the early symptoms of multiple sclerosis. The following weeks are tough for Guido, as he tries to help his boyfriend come to terms with his illness. Colin assumes that Guido will now want nothing more to do with him, but Guido assures him that he is there for the long haul. However, over the following months, major differences in the pair's political view points begin to surface. Colin's liberal opinions clash with Guido's more conservative ones. Colin is furious when Guido reports Junior Roberts (Aaron Carrington) to the police for stealing some of his CDs. He feels that police involvement will only worsen any anti-social behaviour, whilst Guido feels that punishment is the only way to curtail the problem. Meanwhile, Guido is becoming annoyed with Colin's tendency to worry more for others than himself, namely Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), the unappreciative heroin addict who Colin is trying to reform. Their opposing opinions bring to the fore how little they share in common. In addition, Colin cannot shake the feeling that Guido is only staying with him out of pity and so in February 1989 he decides to leave Walford to stay with his brother in Bristol. Colin decides not to tell Guido he is going, but a surprise visit from his ex, Barry Clark (Gary Hailes), stalls his departure, and Guido arrives home to see Colin packed and ready to leave. Guido is furious that Colin was planning on leaving without saying goodbye, but Colin says that he needs some space and he asks Guido to look after his flat while he sorts his head out. He then leaves a perplexed Guido to ponder on where he went wrong, and despite claiming that he will return, he never does. After Colin's departure Guido leaves as well but rather mysteriously. Guido allows Donna to stay in his flat for one night, only to throw her out for overstaying her welcome. In the following episode his only appearance is when he encounters Donna outside Dot Cotton's front door, after Dot took Donna in. He last appears in the episode after this when he has an argument with Donna in the Vic. Guido storms out and is never seen again. Guido's exit scenes were filmed and planned to air. However, due to time constraints, the scenes were cut and his exit was never shown. Writer Colin Brake has joked that when Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Cindy (Michelle Collins) moved into the flat some time later, many viewers expected them to find Guido still inside. Colin and Guido's gay relationship was the cause of much controversy in January 1989 when EastEnders aired the first homosexual mouth-to-mouth kiss on British television. The chaste peck on the lips between Colin and Guido resulted in a front page denunciation in The Sun newspaper, who described it as \\"a homosexual love scene between yuppie poofs [...] when millions of children were watching\\". The kiss was watched by twenty million people and came at a time when Margaret Thatcher's government had set forward a moral agenda that urged a return to traditional family values.

He was born in G√©rardmer in France and was ordained a priest in 1831. He was appointed Bishop of Lu√ßon in 1861 and the Archbishop of Tours in 1874. He is noted for permitting and encouraging the Devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus which had been started by sister Marie of St Peter in Tours from 1844 to 1847. Prior to his appointment as the Bishop of Tours, the documents about the life of sister Marie of St Peter and the Holy Face Devotion were not released to the public. The Venerable Leo Dupont had prayed and campaigned for the release of the documents for about 30 years. Archbishop Colet examined the documents and in 1876 gave permission for them to be published shortly before Dupont died. The Devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus was eventually approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885. Archbishop Colet also founded the Oratory of the Holy Face by purchasing the house of Leo Dupont in Tours, upon Dupont's death, and approved of an order of priests called the Priests of the Holy Face to administer to the chapel. The order was canonically erected in 1876 and Father Peter Javier, a friend of Dupont, was appointed as its director.  References  Sources  Joan Carroll Cruz, OCDS. Saintly Men of Modern Times.

Design Although known for three- engine heavy bombers, Caproni had a long history with fighters, starting in 1914 with an interceptor monoplane with a single machine gun, and a monoplane. This was innovative for its time, but it had also no success, as had almost all the fighters proposed in the next decades. Many types of machines were developed by Italian industries prior to World War II, and some were produced at least in limited numbers, but this would not be the case with the Ca.165, a biplane fighter proposed for a fighter contest. In February 1938, it flew for the first time as prototype. The Ca.165 had a mixed construction. The fuselage was framed in steel with a skin of light alloys, while the wing was built out of wood with fabric skin. Finally, the tail was metallic, also covered in fabric. The Ca.165 had a narrow fuselage featuring an enclosed cockpit. The undercarriage was fixed with spatted wheels. A unique feature of the Ca.165 was the retractable radiator, which the pilot could deploy for optimum performance, or retract depending on the flight conditions: completely open in climbs, or closed in level flight and dives. In this way, it was similar to the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406. When deployed, the radiator significantly increased the drag on the aircraft, but increased engine performance and reliability. The engine was a V-12 671 kW (900 hp) Isotta Fraschini L.121 R.C.40 driving a three-bladed Alfa Romeo electric propeller. Top speed was around 465 km/h (289 mph) at 5,350 m (17,550 ft) with a 10,000 m (32,810 ft) ceiling. The range was relatively small, around 672 km (418 mi). Dimensions were 8.1 m (26.6 ft) length, 9.3 m (30.5 ft) height, 2.8 m (9.2 ft) wingspan, 21.4 m2 (230.3 ft2) wing surface. The weight was 1,855/2,435 kg (4,090/5,368 lb), with 570 kg ( lb) of payload. After several modifications, the Ca.165 had the tail surface augmented and the aft fuselage lowered to fit a canopy with 360¬∞ visibility. Testing and evaluation At Guidonia, the aircraft was tested like the many other fighters present for evaluation. However, it was only tested against the Fiat CR.42 Falco, the only other biplane. In mock fights the Ca.165 outperformed the CR.42, thanks to the superior aerodynamics and available power. Despite this, the aircraft was rated inferior as the CR. 42 was more maneuverable and employed a reliable powerplant while the Caproni engine was experimental and had poor reliability. However, the Ca.165 was declared the \\"winner\\" of the mock fights, so General Valle ordered 12 examples on 2 September 1939, although the order was cancelled on 11 October 1939 and changed to 12 Caproni F.5s. This production shift was made even though it involved the payment of a penalty. The Ca.165 was comparable in useful load (570 kg/1,257 lb vs. 575 kg/1,268 lb) and weapons (2 √ó 12.7 mm/0.5 in, 1 √ó 7.7 mm/0.303 in) to the CR.42, but it was 200 kg (441 lb) heavier with less wing surface, so it had wing loading of 113 kg/m compared to 99 for the CR.42; and that, coupled with the less effective controls, made the Ca.165 less agile. Despite these shortcomings, the Ca. 165's minimum speed was lower (114 km/h/71 mph vs 122 km/h/76 mph), allowing for shorter takeoff runs and slightly better low-speed performance. The Ca.165 had a very slim and small fuselage, but was heavier than the CR.42, which was due, arguably, to the different engine and construction. The Caproni was not really a 'turning fighter', but given the limits of biplanes, was more of an 'energy fighter' with more pronounced capabilities in speed than turning (as was emphasized by the test pilots). An improved version was designed to address the maneuverability limitations, but the development was interrupted. It was built with non-strategic materials (steel and wood mainly), so it could have been at an advantage in the war in terms of strain on the materials industry, but given the type of engine, it is unclear if it was an economically practical aircraft. Caproni tried other ways to improve this powerful biplane, first with the 746 kW (1,000 hp) Piaggio P.XI radial engine, then with a 746 kW (1,000 hp) Isotta Fraschini L.170 liquid-cooled powerplant, and the redesigned sesquiplane wings as the Ca.173. None of these proposals were successful, at least not enough to pique the interest of the Regia Aeronautica. In any case, both engines were far from being sufficiently reliable and were never adopted in large numbers by the Italian air force. Cancellation Perhaps the influence of Fiat contributed to the selection of the CR.42 Falco over the Ca.165, although Caproni was an influential company itself at the time. Apparently the bottom line was that the Ca.165's engine was much less reliable and only 44 kW (60 hp) more powerful, while the aircraft itself was 200 kg (440 lb) heavier. The Ca.165, despite being considered the winner in the mock fights, lost the final evaluation. Apparently, test pilots flying the Ca.165 managed to outperform the Falco but disliked the aircraft itself. The faster speed was a more modern concept for a new generation fighter (especially in the interception of fast bombers such as the Bristol Blenheim, which often proved too fast for the Falco), and speed was an increasingly important design consideration in World War II-era aircraft. The engine's poor reliability was also apparent, and when considering which aircraft to produce, this could have been a disadvantage as well. In any case, the Ca.165 was produced in only a single prototype and so vanished from history; instead the Fiat CR.42 became the most produced Italian fighter, despite its overall obsolescence, with almost 1,800 examples built until 1944.

Rod learns that he was once the boyfriend of Lou Beale's (Anna Wing) sister, Doris. Lou died in 1988 but Harry is persuaded to pay her daughter, Pauline (Wendy Richard), a visit to find out about Doris. He knocks on her door but fearfully flees before she answers. It soon becomes clear that Harry's past isn't the only thing troubling him, he is also suffering from ill health and is seen clutching his chest in obvious pain. One cold, rainy afternoon, Harry sits in pain on a bench in Albert Square gardens, where he dies. His body is found by Willy, Ethel Skinner's (Gretchen Franklin) dog. Ethel recognises Harry and seems to know a lot about his history. She reveals that Harry grew up at number 29 Albert Square and when he was 15, he fell in love with Doris and vowed to marry her. However, when the Second World War broke out, he was conscripted into the army and sent to war. Doris promised to wait until Harry returned but he was later reported missing in action and presumed dead. Doris subsequently married Morris Miller. When Harry returned, he managed to find employment working on the docks, where he occasionally got his hands on scarce food items, which he smuggled out and shared with his neighbours. On one occasion, he gave some meat to a nine-year-old girl. However, the meat turned out to be unsanitary and it accidentally poisoned her. She died and Harry fled the country in shame, amidst accusations of murder. He spent over 40 years in self-imposed exile and it seemed that Harry had come back to his childhood home to die.\\"Harry Osborne\\", Walford.net. Retrieved 25 March 2007.

Retrieved 7 February 2007. however from 1998 the character is renamed to Bev (the same occurs with Cindy's father, who is referred to as \\"Edwin\\" in 1989, and \\"Tom\\" thereafter). During the 1980s, she owns a hat stall on Turpin Road market, which Cindy runs for her in 1988. Bev and her husband then move to Devon and her pitch on the market is taken over by Laurie Bates (Gary Powell) in 1989. Bev remains unseen until February 1990, when she and her husband attend their grandson Steven Beale's (Edward Farrell) christening. At the end of 1990, Cindy, Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and Steven move away from London to stay with Bev in Devon. Bev is not seen again until November 1998, when Cindy's former husband, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), meets her at the coroner's office following Cindy's death. She had been estranged from her daughter until a few months before she died, when Cindy contacted her asking for money. She could not give Cindy any money however, as her husband, Tom, had left her that year. Ian gives her a lift to the hospital to see Cindy's newborn baby, Cindy (Ella Wortley), and she tries to get him to take the child in as his own, threatening to put the baby into care. However, custody of the baby is eventually given to Bev's other daughter Gina Williams (Nicola Cowper), who lives with her mother in Devon. Bev appears at Cindy's funeral, and later in August 1999 when Ian visits her and Gina to watch the eclipse. She persuades Melanie Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) to propose to Ian, as Gina is trying to split them up. In 2007, Gina and Cindy Jr appear without Bev. In August 2010, her granddaughter Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield) moves to Devon to live with Bev. Four months later, her grandson Peter Beale (Thomas Law) goes to live with her. Phil Mitchell Phil Mitchell, played by Steve McFadden, first arrives in Albert Square on 20 February 1990, and is soon joined by his brother, Grant (Ross Kemp), sister Sam (Danniella Westbrook) and mother Peggy (Jo Warne/Barbara Windsor). He has become one of the soap's most popular characters and is the second longest-running male protagonist to appear in the serial. He is first introduced as the lesser of two thugs, but becomes a darker character after Grant leaves. More recent storylines, such as the return of his son Ben, have shown a softer side to the character. In 2010, McFadden was given six weeks off EastEnders, so he could appear in pantomime. He has, at various times, owned many businesses in the Square. He has been married three times and featured in numerous high-profile storylines, including the much-hyped whodunnit, dubbed \\"Who Shot Phil?\\"‚Äîwhen the character is gunned down outside his home ‚Äì and an affair with his brother's wife, dubbed \\"Sharongate\\". Grant Mitchell Grant Mitchell, played by Ross Kemp, first appears in 1990, introduced by producer Michael Ferguson to revamp the show. Kemp remained until 1999 when he opted to leave. In 2005 and 2006, Kemp was persuaded to return to the role for brief stints during a period of heavy media criticism aimed at EastEnders. The return proved to be a ratings success, though Kemp has since been sceptical about the possibility of another return. A popular character, prominent in the series, Grant is portrayed as a tough persona, known for his fiery temper and his tendency to resort to violence. Family is important to him, particularly his relationship with his brother, Phil (Steve McFadden). Grant and Phil known as the \\"Mitchell brothers\\" have become household names in the United Kingdom. They have been parodied even in adverts where their gruff, tough talking, cockney accents have been impersonated. One of EastEnders most popular and highly rated storylines was Sharongate, where Grant discovers that his wife Sharon (Letitia Dean) has been having an affair with his brother. In the latter part of 1989 EastEnders acquired a new executive producer named Michael Ferguson, who took over from Mike Gibbon. Ferguson had previously been a producer on ITV's The Bill ‚Äì a hard-hitting, gritty and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging EastEnders in providing a realistic vision of modern life in London. Due to his success on The Bill, Peter Cregeen, the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of EastEnders. Jackie Stone Jackie Stone, played by Richard Beale, is a market trader who is elected as the Chairman of the Bridge Street Market Traders Association. He is asked to liaise with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), who have purchased land that has been used by traders previously. However, Jackie finds himself in an awkward position when he realises that he has been a friend of the Phil and Grant's late father, Eric; they boxed together and some traders believe that Jackie was showing favouritism to the Mitchell brothers. When the council attempts to close part of the market for a possible development, Jackie, along with the other traders, petitions and protests against it. Fruit and veg trader Pete Beale (Peter Dean) is not impressed with his efforts and usurps his post as chairman. The councilman in charge of the development, Stuart Kendle, attempts to bribe Pete and Jackie to drop their opposition. Impressed by Pete's determination, Phil and Grant break into Kendle's office and find evidence that proves he is corrupt. The market is saved. In March 1991, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) decides that he wants to take over the lease of the Dagmar winebar, where Jackie is squatting. He plants a computer that Phil and Grant stole from the council in the wine bar so that Jackie will be evicted. Disa O'Brien Disa O'Brien, portrayed by Jan Graveson, first appears in episode 536. She is introduced as a tough seeming Wearside runaway, who helps Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence) to survive when she lives rough on the streets. Disa first appeared in flashback sequences involving Diane on 27 and 29 March 1990, before returning from 18 December. The character was written out of the series the following year and departs in episode 633, first broadcast on 28 February 1991. The character is portrayed by Jan Graveson, pictured. Disa is first seen in March 1990, in flashback scenes set from January. Diane Butcher has run away from home and is fending for herself living on the streets of London, where she befriends Disa, a fellow teenage runaway. Disa is working as a prostitute and tries to convince Diane to follow the same path with the hope that they can raise the funds to share a flat together. Diane cannot bring herself to do this however, but takes up nude modelling for an artist instead. Eventually Diane contacts her father Frank (Mike Reid) and returns to Walford, whilst a bedraggled Disa remains living on the streets, begging and selling sex. Disa had become pregnant in 1990, and she is still living rough in London just before the birth of her child. Knowing this, Diane spends days searching the streets of London for Disa, hoping to provide her and her soon to be born baby with accommodation. After a series of leads result in nothing, Diane is about to give up hope when her friend Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) spots Disa arguing with an unknown man about her baby. However, when Mark makes his presence known she and the man flee, and Disa disappears. The following day, on Christmas Eve, Diane is approached by a homeless man who agrees to bring Disa to her in exchange for money. Diane finally gets a chance to speak to her friend, but Disa refuses to take her help, and orders Diane to stay out of her life and leaves. On Christmas Day Disa goes into labour, alone in a derelict building near Walford, and gives birth to a little girl. Disa knows that a life living rough on the streets is no place for a new born baby, so that same day she decides to leave her baby in a cardboard box on the Butcher's doorstep, with the hope that Diane will take her in. Diane and her boyfriend Mark once again search the streets of London and eventually find Disa. They manage to bring her back to Albert Square (under protest) to live in Mo Butcher's (Edna Dor√©) empty flat, in the hope that she will become attached to her child, who is originally called Billie, but is later renamed Jasmine. It is a rough ride for Disa, as she is severely lacking parenting skills. She also finds it difficult to bond with her baby initially, but with the help of Diane and Mark she begins to settle into life in the Square, and she soon grows to love her baby. Dot Cotton (June Brown), who often attracts waifs and strays, looks after the child when Disa won't or can't. On one occasion, she unwittingly lets a stranger called Ken Raynor (Ian Redford) into the flat, who claims to be Disa's uncle. However, Ken is actually Disa's stepfather, and he is also the father of baby Jasmine. Whilst Disa was living with him and her mother, she had been the victim of his sexual abuse and rape, which had left her pregnant and driven her onto the streets. In an attempt to get Disa back within his power, Ken kidnaps Jasmine, leaving Disa frantic with worry. With the help of the police, Dot manages to trap him. Ken is arrested and imprisoned, and the baby is returned to Disa unharmed. Disa refuses to admit to the sexual abuse she has been subjected to, even when she is told that Ken would be imprisoned for a long time if she did. However, she does confide in Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) through the Samaritans. Kathy helps Disa to find the courage to tell her mother, Sandra, that Ken had forced both her and her younger half sister to have sex with him, and that he is the father of her child. Sandra refuses to believe her daughter at first. She hits Disa and accuses her of lying, before breaking down and accepting the truth. Sandra makes Disa visit Ken in prison so she can see his response to her accusations. While there, a repulsed Disa confronts Ken about the sexual abuse she had endured since the age of 12. Disgusted, Sandra informs Ken that she and her children will be testifying to this in court, to ensure that he is locked away for a very long time. Sandra then takes Disa and Jasmine back to Sunderland, Tyne and Wear to live with her. Disa's last appearance is in February 1991. Carol Hanley Carol Hanley, played by Sheila White, is the biological mother of Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), whom she had with Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) before she was adopted. Carol is tracked down by Sharon, and Sharon's best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) visits Carol, who is now married to Ron (Dean Harris) and heavily pregnant with a daughter. Michelle speaks to them about contacting Sharon after years of absence. Sharon later visits Carol after her baby is born. Carol and Sharon get on well, but Carol is anxious about introducing Sharon to her two half-brothers, Kristopher and Jonathan. After Carol's confession that she only thinks of her as a good friend, Sharon realises there will never be a parental bond between them and stops seeing her. Carol sends Sharon a letter nearly 25 years later. After a few weeks of hesitation, Sharon decides to visit her, accompanied by her friend Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), only to be greeted by Kristopher (Jonathan Broadbent), who informs her that Carol has died and her funeral is taking place. Kristopher invites Sharon inside to the wake and she tells him that she was a friend of his mother. Sharon signs a condolence book for Carol and leaves. When Sharon discovers Gavin is her birth father, he says that Carol suffered a breakdown after Sharon's birth. Celestine Tavernier Celestine Tavernier, played by Leroy Golding, appears primarily in the serial between 1990 and 1992. Celestine makes a further guest appearance in 1993. Celestine is portrayed as a strict disciplinarian and a devout Christian who expects everyone in his family to show similar dedication to the church and abide by his rules. His unwavering demand for respect often alienates his children and almost causes the breakdown of his marriage. Eddie Royle Eddie Royle is played by Michael Melia from 1990 until 1991. Born in Ireland, Eddie came to Britain with his parents as a boy. Bright and energetic, he couldn't wait to join the police force and when he did, he loved his job, priding himself on being an honest copper. However Eddie encountered corrupt practices in the force, so he took early retirement and decided to start afresh in Walford. Eddie arrives in Walford in July 1990, as the new landlord of The Queen Victoria public house, which he buys from Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). He is a serious minded landlord, far different from his predecessors Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Frank. Not everyone takes to him, particularly when they discover his prior profession. Eddie doesn't really have any real friends in Albert Square, but his father John (Paddy Joyce), often turns up in Walford to keep his son company. Whilst being landlord at the pub, Eddie rents a room to his barmaid Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Although he never approves of her relationship with the local thug, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), and this often makes things awkward between the pair. Eddie never married as a policeman, however, in Walford, he decides he needs a mate. He patiently pursues Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), but she sees him kissing Eibhlin O'Donnell (Mary Conlon), who is his former girlfriend visiting from Ireland. Kathy refuses to accept his explanations and so their lukewarm romance ends. In April 1991, when Sharon seems to be opening her heart to him and is fed up with Grant, he rashly offers himself as a replacement, but is rejected. When Grant finds out, he beats him up so badly that he is hospitalised and needs brain surgery. Whilst recovering, he receives another visit from Eibhlin. He ends up proposing marriage and she accepts. Eddie cannot forgive Grant for his violent assault and so he contacts an old police colleague to check up on Grant's dodgy dealings. However, Sharon discovers what is going on and manages to remove some dodgy packages from Grant's garage before the police arrive. Eddie is furious, and is even more enraged when he discovers that she'd agreed to marry Grant, so he sacks her. Although Sharon successfully sues him for unfair dismissal, Eddie refuses to give her job back to her. In August 1991 Eibhlin moves in with Eddie. Meanwhile, Eddie begins coaching Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock) in boxing and that same month he is approached by an old friend, who is coaching Clyde's upcoming opponent. He and Eddie try to bribe Clyde to purposefully lose the fight in a betting scam, which causes a blazing row between Clyde and Eddie. Grant's rage towards Eddie also resurfaces when he discovers that it was he who had tipped him off to the police about his shady dealings. This further alienates the community and it seems that everyone in Walford has something against Eddie. In September 1991, while Eddie is taking his pet poodle, Roly, for an evening walk he is stabbed to death. Clyde Tavernier discovers his bloody body in the Square, and after foolishly picking up the murder weapon, he flees in panic. Unfortunately for Clyde, there is a witness who had seen him standing over Eddie's body and fleeing the scene ‚Äì Nick Cotton (John Altman). Clyde is arrested for Eddie's murder and imprisoned. However, a second witness, Joe Wallace (Jason Rush), later comes forward to attest that he had seen Nick Cotton in the vicinity on the night of the murder. It turns out that Nick was attempting a robbery when Eddie saw him, and to silence him, Nick stabbed him. Clyde is released and Nick is arrested for the murder, but surprisingly he is found 'not guilty' at the trial in 1993, as there is not enough evidence to convict. Clyde Tavernier Clyde Tavernier, played by Steven Woodcock, is introduced in the summer of 1990. Clyde is featured in various prominent storylines including an inter- racial relationship with Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), and being framed for the murder of publican Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). The character was written out in 1993 and was given a happy ending. Etta Tavernier Etta Tavernier, played by Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence, appears between 1990 and 1992. Etta also makes a guest appearance in 1994, visiting members of the Tavernier family who remain in the serial. Also religious like her husband, Etta is portrayed as a career woman; her most prominent storylines concern marital problems and crises of faith. Etta was Gordon-Lawrence's first television role. Leroy Golding who was awarded the part of Celestine Tavernier claims that his inexperience helped rather than hindered the Tavernier family to gel together as it created a sense of \\"camaraderie\\" among them; he suggests that he and his screen wife Gordon-Lawrence \\"played very well off each other\\". Hattie Tavernier Hattie Tavernier, played by Michelle Gayle between 1990 and 1993, was introduced in July 1990 with her family by producer Michael Ferguson. The Taverniers were the first collective black family to join the soap at the same time. Portrayed as an intelligent, independent young woman, Hattie remains in the serial after the departures of many of her screen family, covering issues such as miscarriage and sexual harassment. Michelle Gayle quit the role in 1993 to embark on a pop career. Gayle filmed no official exit storyline for Hattie. Her last scene aired on 21 December 1993, with Hattie departing to visit her parents off-screen in Norwich for the Christmas holidays. Dialogue between characters at this time suggests that is a temporary departure; however, Gayle did not return to the role. The character was hastily written out, appearing briefly one last time in February 1994 to show that Hattie has decided to remain in Norwich. In the scene, Hattie's former lover Steve Elliot (Mark Monero) witnesses Hattie in the distance with another man. This fleeting appearance was played by a non-speaking and uncredited extra. Jules Tavernier Jules Tavernier, played by Tommy Eytle between 1990 and 1997, is depicted as a flirtatious older gentleman. He is introduced in 1990 and remains in the show after the departures of all of his on-screen family. He is largely semi-regular during the latter part of his stint, and is not featured again after December 1997. Jules Tavernier appears in more than 150 episodes over his seven-year tenure.\\"Tommy Eytle: Calypso musician who found fame in EastEnders\\", The Times. Retrieved 14 June 2012. Lloyd Tavernier Lloyd Tavernier, played by Garey Bridges, arrives in Albert Square in July 1990 with the rest of the Tavernier clan: father Celestine (Leroy Golding), mother Etta (Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence), grandfather Jules (Tommy Eytle), older brother Clyde (Steven Woodcock) and twin sister Hattie (Michelle Gayle). Lloyd suffers with sickle-cell anaemia and because of this his entire family tend to 'wrap him up in cotton-wool', which often leaves him feeling smothered. His father's strict rules only seek to alienate him further so he spends most of his time on the square attempting to rebel against them. His condition means that he becomes easily tired so he is forbidden from getting a job as his parents fear that he would over-exert himself. Lloyd ignores his family's wishes and secretly gets a job as a paper boy. He regrets his defiance however, as he collapses in the playground with sickle cell crisis, and is rushed to hospital frightening his family with a near death experience. The incident underlines the seriousness of his condition and only increases his parents overbearing concern. Lloyd soon grows sick of his 'limited existence' and he eventually begins to turn his back on education and the 'sanctimonious preachings' of the church that his parents hold with such high regard. In an attempt to rebel he neglects his studies and turns to petty crime. He and his friends hi-jack a car in April 1992 and take it for a joy-ride, which culminates in him getting caught and arrested by the police. His expedition earns him a suspended sentence, much to his father's shame. His older brother Clyde takes him under his wing, however, and helps him straighten his life out. Lloyd eventually moves to Norwich with his mother and father. His last appearance is in June 1992. George Lawler George Lawler, played by Edmund Kente, is a business associate of Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), whose catering business has failed, so he sells his client base and equipment to Ian for his catering business, The Meal Machine. He recognises The Meal Machine's chef Joe Wallace (Jason Rush), as he had previously sacked Joe when he found out that he had HIV. He demands that Joe quits his job, but when he fails to do so, George informs Ian about Joe's HIV, and Ian sacks Joe. Sam Mitchell Sam Mitchell is the third member of the Mitchell family to be introduced, Sam first appears as a 15-year-old school girl in July 1990, played by Danniella Westbrook. Westbrook quit in 1993, but was reintroduced from 1995‚Äì1996 and from 1999‚Äì2000. In 2002, the character is reintroduced for a fourth time, but the role was recast to another actress, Kim Medcalf. Medcalf left the role in 2005. However, in September 2009, Westbrook reprised her role as Sam for several months, departing in January 2010. She returns again from August until September 2010 and again from 30 June to 8 July 2016. Portrayed as headstrong, flirty and manipulative, early storylines featuring Sam concentrate on her teen elopement with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen). She goes on to be involved with topless modelling, various family crises, relationships, feuds, and a short-lived marriage to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs). Her exit in 2005 is the culmination of a storyline that sees Sam wrongly imprisoned for Den Watts' (Leslie Grantham) murder. Sam is cleared of murder and released, but she flees the country to escape another prison sentence for perverting the course of justice. Her brief return in 2009 sees Sam resurrect her relationship with Ricky whilst having an on-off affair with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), being manipulated by her uncle Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) and causing her family to lose a number of their businesses again before finally going to prison. Her latest return sees her struggle with motherhood after giving birth to Jack's baby. John Royle John Royle, played by Paddy Joyce, is the widowed father of Eddie Royle (Michael Melia) ‚Äì the publican of The Queen Victoria public house. He first appears in Walford in August 1990 when he comes to visit his son. John is a wily Irishman and a retired metal worker. In his youth, he was a talented footballer and could have played professionally if he'd wanted to leave Dublin, which he didn't. He is often the life and soul of the party in Walford, and is known to like a pint of Guinness or two. He is a perfect pal for the other seniors on the Square ‚Äì Jules Tavernier (Tommy Eytle) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). He is often seen engaging in a game of poker with Jules. On one occasion Jules manages to thrash John, but is mortified when John pays the winnings in chickens instead of money. Mo Butcher (Edna Dor√©) ends up taking them back to her family's Bed and Breakfast. John is very proud of his son and will not get mixed up in anything that will have earn his disapproval. John shows up periodically to visit Eddie, and on one occasion he brings Eddie's ex- girlfriend, Eibhlin O'Donnell (Mary Conlon), with him. Unfortunately, John's timing couldn't have been worse, as her arrival spells the end of his son's relationship with Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). However, within a few months, Eddie has changed his mind and asks Eibhlin to marry him. Eddie is murdered by Nick Cotton (John Altman) in September 1991, and John is devastated to lose his pride and joy, especially in such horrific circumstances. After this time, John is not seen in Walford until January 1993, when he attends the trial of Nick Cotton. He has found the death of his son hard to get over and he hopes that seeing justice served to his son's killer will bring closure. He is horrified and inconsolable, however, when the verdict comes back as not guilty. Joan Garwood Joan Garwood, played by Mary Miller, is the older sister of Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), and the first child of Mo (Edna Dor√©) and Chike Butcher. Joan was far brighter than Frank and, after graduating from school with 7 O-levels and an A-level, she married a chief accountant, Graham (Ian Thompson). Following their marriage, Joan and Graham moved to Colchester, and kept little contact with Joan's family in Walford. After Mo is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1990, she starts speaking of and referring to people (mostly Diane (Sophie Lawrence), her granddaughter) as Joan, which gives some light into their relationship: Mo believes that Joan sees herself in a higher standing than the rest of her family, which earns Mo's dislike and disapproval. As her mental state deteriorates, Mo causes a fire in her flat after dropping a cigarette in her linen, which leads to Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) rescuing her, and Mo being hospitalised overnight. After this, Frank contacts Joan and she visits Walford to assess the situation, calling a truce with Frank; the siblings had not spoken since the funeral of Frank's first wife, June. Joan also meets Janine properly for the first time, and, when questioned by her, reveals that she has no children because of fertility issues. Throughout the day, Frank and Joan snipe at each other about their lack of contact, until Pat (Pam St. Clement) intervenes. When Joan goes to leave, using her job at an Oxfam as an excuse, Mo suddenly becomes lucid and begs her to stay overnight. Later, Joan argues with Frank over her involvement in the Butcher family, accusing Frank of not knowing her at all, and also revealing that Mo never wanted a daughter and thus ignored Joan in favour of Frank. After the argument, the two read a letter Mo wrote to Frank before her condition deteriorated, in which Mo asks Frank to put her \\"out of her pain\\". The next day, Frank and Joan have tea with Mo, who seems to have become more lucid and reminisces with them about their childhoods. However, Mo believes that Frank wants to kill her, having forgotten about the letter she wrote to him. In a heated confrontation, she smashes a teapot. Joan leaves Walford that evening, and agrees with Frank that they should keep in contact for Mo's sake, although her departure is marred by Mo's insistence on leaving with her - she is still afraid that Frank wants to kill her. Joan placates her by saying she will talk to Graham first. Unable to cope with his mother's illness, Frank begins talking about fulfilling the wish in Mo's letter, worrying Joan. The next day, in more lucid moments, Mo phones for minicabs to take her to Colchester, calls which Frank and Dot Cotton (June Brown) have to cancel afterwards. Joan and Graham visit Walford that day and Joan suggests that she and Graham take Mo to stay with them temporarily, saying that the break may do Mo's memory some good and give both Frank and Pat a chance to relax. However, when Frank points out that Mo's memory will never get better, Joan accuses him of not wanting Mo to get better. She and Frank then argue, with Frank accusing Joan of only getting involved out of guilt, due to her estrangement from the family and ignoring Mo after the death of their father. Joan and Graham then take Mo to a restaurant, as Mo believes that Pat and Frank are trying to poison her and refuses to eat another meal served there. Afterwards, when Joan leaves, Mo begs her not to and hides from Frank when he comes into the room, bursting into tears, believing he will kill her. After a brief talk with Dot, it is decided that it is better for Mo to go to Colchester with Graham and Joan, and Dot explains to Frank that it will be better to let her go than to keep watching her decline. The three leave that night, and Mo lives with them until she dies on 31 December 1992. Following Frank's disappearance in 1994, his family start up a search for him that continues into the next year. Over Christmas that year, Pat visits Joan to see if Frank is staying with her. Joan tells Pat she has not seen Frank for several years. Marcus Christie Marcus Christie, played by Stephen Churchett, is a solicitor employed by Phil and Grant Mitchell (Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp), and appears sporadically to represent them both in numerous criminal matters. Marcus often gets Phil and Grant out of trouble and is never afraid to bend the rules. Marcus first appears in November 1990, to represent Phil on some handling and receiving charges which he beats the following summer. Marcus is summoned once again to assist Phil when he asks him to see if he can get Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) sectioned in order to stop him marrying his teenage sister, Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook). Marcus is present when Grant is questioned over the murder of Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). Phil contacts Marcus on Christmas Day 1999 in order to legalize the sale of his half of The Queen Victoria public house to Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for ¬£5, in order to spite his mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Marcus reappears in the summer of 2000 when he helps Phil con Dan into selling back his share of the pub back to him during a poker game, where Phil smugly refunds Dan's money. In December 2004, Marcus cons Sam (now Kim Medcalf) by telling her that Phil, who is on the run, needs all the money he can get. Sam sells all of the Mitchell empire, including The Queen Vic pub to Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), and gives Marcus the money. Marcus then flees Walford to start a new life abroad with all the money. It is revealed that Marcus was in on the con with Den Watts, because Den wanted to regain his position as the landlord of The Queen Vic 16 years after he had first sold it. Ritchie Scott (Sian Webber) becomes the Mitchells' lawyer after Marcus' betrayal. Marcus returns on 25 July 2014 after Sharon Rickman (Letitia Dean) tracks him down. Marcus has been using a different name and working for a new company, but still as a lawyer. Sharon tells him she now lives with Phil and wants help to gain access to Phil's finances otherwise she will expose his whereabouts to Phil. Marcus reluctantly agrees to help Sharon and although she later has a change of heart and calls off the con, Marcus is spotted by Phil leaving The Albert. Phil later lures Marcus back to The Albert and confronts him and a scared Marcus confesses Sharon's plan to scam Phil. Marcus returns again in August 2015, when Max Branning (Jake Wood) hires him to represent him after he is accused of the murder of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater). Phil tries to threaten him into dropping the case, while Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), who wants to see Max found innocent, contacts him and formulates a fake alibi for Max, claiming she slept with him on the night of Lucy's death. Marcus points the blame towards Max's daughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), who is furious with her father for allowing this. Max asks Marcus to stop this line of questioning towards Abi but Marcus insists it is necessary to help clear his name and that it will raise the question of reasonable doubt in the jury's eyes. Despite Marcus's best efforts, Max is found guilty of murder because the jury foreman is bribed by Phil. However, Max's conviction is later quashed when the real killer, Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington), confesses to Lucy's murder. Kofi Tavernier Kofi Tavernier, played by Marcel Smith from 1990 to 1993, is the son of Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock) and he initially lives with his maternal grandparents in Bristol following the death of his mother, Abigail. After Clyde discovers that Kofi's grandparents are planning on emigrating to Jamaica with his son, he follows them to the airport and brings Kofi back to Walford on Christmas Day 1990. Kofi becomes friendly with Vicki Fowler (Samantha Leigh Martin) at a toddler group, and as a result of their friendship Clyde grows close to Vicki's mother, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). In 1991, Kofi's father is wrongly accused of the murder of Eddie Royle (Michael Melia) and so Clyde and Michelle go on the run and take Vicki and Kofi with them in an ill-fated attempt to start a new life together in France. However, Clyde is arrested before he can escape and is subsequently imprisoned. During this time Kofi is looked after by the rest of the Taverniers until Clyde is cleared of all charges and released three months later. In July 1993, Clyde and Kofi emigrate to Trinidad to live with Clyde's girlfriend Gidea Thompson (Sian Martin), who is also his cousin. =Development= The Tavernier family were introduced in 1990 by the newly appointed executive producer Michael Ferguson. The introduction of the Tavernier family heralded the first time that an entire family had joined EastEnders all at the same time‚Äîall except Kofi, who first appeared several months after the core family's introduction. The Taverniers were also a well- intentioned attempt to portray a wider range of black characters than had previously been achieved on the show. It took a long time to cast the complete Tavernier family. Once EastEnders became a success, the producers had no difficulties in finding \\"good actors\\" who wanted to join the cast; however, what became hard was finding families‚Äîcombinations of performers who \\"look and sound as though they could be related.\\" According to producers Corinne Hollingworth and Pat Sandys, the Taveriner family were especially difficult, as upon Kofi's arrival, four male generations of the family were being featured, great grandfather Jules (Tommy Eytle), grandfather Celestine (Leroy Golding), father Clyde (Steven Woodcock) and son Kofi. Hollingworth has commented \\"The most difficult job we've had was finding‚Ä¶black actors who fitted the bill for the Tavernier family.\\" Kofi's backstory is told through Clyde before he makes an appearance‚Äîhe was a result of a relationship between Clyde and a girl named Abigail (unseen in the serial). Until December 1990, Kofi lived outside of the area that the soap is set‚Äîremaining with his maternal grandparents in Bristol following the death of his mother. Clyde accepts this as he is unable to provide financially for his child, a fact that he is seen to agonise over, and a source of friction between him and his father Celestine. Clyde eventually brings Kofi to live with him in Walford when Abigail's parents threaten to take Kofi to live in the West Indies. Kofi is often in scenes with another child actress, Samantha Leigh Martin, who played Vicki Fowler. Their friendship is part of the reason that Clyde and Vicki's mother, Michelle (Susan Tully), form a relationship. He is also featured in a special set of offset episodes, written by Tony Jordan and first airing in November 1991. The episodes are the climax of a \\"mini-storyline\\" that sees Clyde and Michelle go \\"on the run\\" from the police with Kofi and Vicki, after Clyde is falsely accused of murder. Directed by Mike Dormer, the episode has been described as one \\"of the most exciting thriller episodes of EastEnders.\\" Kofi remains in the programme until July 1993, when he and his father Clyde were written out of the serial. On-screen Clyde leaves Walford with Kofi to explore his roots in Trinidad.  Pearl Chadwick  Ellen Thomas' (pictured in 2016) four roles in the series. Pearl Chadwick, played by Ellen Thomas, appears between episode 606 and episode 613, first broadcast on 27 November and 20 December 1990 respectively. Pearl is introduced alongside her husband, Henry Chadwick (Thomas Baptiste), as the grandmother of Kofi Tavernier (Marcel Smith). Pearl is the grandmother of Kofi, who has been living with Pearl and Henry in Bristol following their daughter, Abigal Chadwick's, death. Kofi's father, Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock), visits occasionally, but he desperately misses his son and is furious to discover that Pearl and Henry are planning to emigrate with Kofi to Jamaica. Clyde cannot persuade Pearl to leave Kofi, but Clyde's mother, Etta Tavernier (Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence), asks if Clyde can spend time with Kofi in Walford before they leave. Clyde struggles to part with Kofi and follows the family to the airport, where he persuades Pearl and Henry that he can provide Kofi support. He then returns home with Kofi.  Henry Chadwick  Henry Chadwick, played by Thomas Baptiste, is the father of Abigail, who had been killed in a motor accident and her son, Kofi (Marcel Smith), was left in his care. He resides with Henry and his wife Pearl (Ellen Thomas) in Bristol. Kofi's father, Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock), visits occasionally, but he desperately misses his son and he is furious to discover that Henry and Pearl are planning to emigrate with Kofi to Jamaica in December 1990. Clyde is unable to talk them out of taking Kofi, but Clyde's mother steps in and they allow Clyde to spend some time with Kofi in Walford before departing for the airport. Clyde cannot bear to lose his son, and he follows the Chadwicks to the airport and persuades them that he can give Kofi the stability he needs. Clyde brings Kofi home to Walford in time for Christmas.  Ken Raynor  Ken Raynor, played by Ian Redford, married Sandra O'Brien in Sunderland and became stepfather to her two children Disa (Jan Graveson) and Ginny. Unbeknown to Sandra, Ken sexually abused both her girls. Disa ran away from home to live rough on the streets of London, turning to prostitution to survive. However, Disa had fallen pregnant with Ken's child, and he followed her there. Ken is first seen on-screen in December 1990, when Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) witnesses him harassing Disa and scares him away. Disa gives birth to Ken's daughter on Christmas Day 1990 in a derelict building. She abandons the baby ‚Äì initially named Billie, later renamed Jasmine ‚Äì on Diane Butcher's (Sophie Lawrence) doorstep, until Diane convinces her to stay in an empty flat in Walford, and helps her to bond with the child. Ken traces Disa there in January 1991. He tricks Disa's childminder, Dot Cotton (June Brown), into letting him see the baby by pretending to be Disa's concerned uncle. He then kidnaps Jasmine. Ken wants Disa back under his control, but Dot, with police assistance, tricks him into meeting her, and leads him straight into the hands of the police. The baby is returned to Disa, and Ken is imprisoned. With the possibility that Ken could be released, Disa is forced to admit to the sexual abuse he had subjected her to. Disa and her mother Sandra visit Ken in prison to confront him. Disgusted, Sandra informs Ken that she and her children will be testifying in court to ensure that he is imprisoned for a very long time.  Jasmine O'Brien  Jasmine O'Brien (also Billie O'Brien) is the daughter of Disa O'Brien (Jan Graveson). Disa gives birth to Jasmine alone in a derelict building on Christmas Day 1990. She leaves the child in a cardboard box on Diane Butcher's (Sophie Lawrence) doorstep. Diane and her friend Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) name the baby Billie and look after her until they find Disa and threaten to give the baby to Social Services unless she returns to Walford with them. Disa does, under protest, and lives in Mo Butcher's (Edna Dor√©) flat on Albert Square. With the help of Diane and Dot Cotton (June Brown), Disa begins to bond with her daughter, who she renames Jasmine. Disa does not tell anyone that her stepfather Ken Raynor (Ian Redford) is Jasmine's father. He had been abusing her for some time and her mother did not believe Disa when she tried to tell her so she ran away from home. Ken comes to Walford and tricks Dot into letting him see Jasmine by claiming to be Disa's concerned uncle and kidnaps her. Ken wants Disa back under his control but Dot, with police assistance, tricks him into meeting her and hands him over to the police. Jasmine is returned to Disa and Ken is imprisoned. With the possibility that Ken could be released, Disa tells her mother about the sexual abuse he subjected her to. Disa and her mother, Sandra, visit Ken in prison to confront him. Disgusted, Sandra informs Ken that she and her children will be testifying in court to ensure that he is imprisoned for a very long time. Reunited with her mother, Disa takes Jasmine home to Sunderland.

Eibhlin O'Donnell Eibhlin O'Donnell, played by Mary Conlon, is an Irish woman who met and dated Eddie Royle (Michael Melia) in the early 80s, when her job for the Irish tourist board in Dublin took her to a London office for a six-month stint. Eibhlin was committed to her close-knit Catholic family (especially her widowed father and her marijuana-smoking sister Maureen), so when her work placement ended, she returned to Dublin and her relationship with Eddie ended. Eibhlin visits Eddie in Walford in January 1991. In her mid thirties, Eibhlin is thinking about settling down. She hopes to rekindle a romance with Eddie. When Eddie's current girlfriend, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), sees how close Eddie and Eibhlin are, she breaks up with Eddie. Instead of reuniting with Eibhlin, Eddie opts to try and win Kathy back, so Eibhlin returns to Ireland. When Eddie is badly beaten by Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) in April 1991, Eibhlin returns to Walford to visit him in hospital. Eddie's brush with death makes him rethink marriage, and he proposes to Eibhlin. She accepts and in August 1991, she moves in with Eddie at The Queen Victoria public house, of which Eddie is landlord. A part of Eibhlin is not convinced that marriage to Eddie will work; they do not get the opportunity to find out as Eddie is murdered by Nick Cotton (John Altman) in September that year. A devastated and heartbroken Eibhlin then returns to Ireland. Rachel Kominski Rachel Kominski, played by Jacquetta May, owns number 55 Victoria Road. She befriends Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) and is initially keen for her to become her lodger, but when she learns Michelle has a young daughter, she rents the bedroom to singer Karen (Adjoa Andoh). Rachel later befriends Michelle's uncle Pete Beale (Peter Dean), and agrees to have a drink with him sometime. Pete mistakes this for a date and is disappointed when she does not show up. Rachel apologises to him the following day and supports him when she discovers his flat has been trashed. Rachel helps Michelle get her wages from a timeshare company that tried to withhold it. Rachel's former boyfriend Russell Nash (Ray Ashcroft) arrives at number 55 when she unknowingly hires his friend to put some shelves up for her. Russell tries to convince her to get back together with him, until Rachel tells him that she had hated the three years they were together. Rachel becomes fed up with Karen's loud music, untidyness and boyfriend Clyde Tavernier's (Steven Woodcock) presence in the house. Just as Rachel confronts her, Karen tells her that she is moving out, as she has accepted a job in Manchester. Rachel invites Michelle to be her lodger. Rachel sees potential in Michelle, and encourages her to apply to college, which she does. She dates Michelle's brother, Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and he confides in her that he is HIV-positive. She later supports him when he tells his parents, who do not react well. Rachel reluctantly helps Michelle hide Clyde in the spare room when he goes on the run from the police, having been accused of murdering Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). She also supports Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) when Kathy learns her rapist James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde) is planning on returning to the Square. She accompanies Kathy when she meets Wilmott-Brown at a hotel to hear him out, and continues to be a confidante when Wilmott-Brown sends Kathy cassette tapes. Mark moves in with Rachel and Michelle, but this soon leads to the end of the relationship, as he and Rachel argue. When one of the university courses she teaches is dropped, Rachel begins looking for part-time work. Her mother also informs her that she and Rachel's father will no longer be sending her money to help with the mortgage. Rachel's mother later comes to stay and reveals several of Rachel's secrets to her friends. After the rest of her courses are dropped, Rachel finds work at the Bridge Street caf√© and has a bric-a-brac market stall, where she meets market inspector Richard Cole (Ian Reddington). Rachel has sex with Richard, but he soon begins pursuing Kathy. Richard later gives her pitch to Sanjay Kapoor (Deepak Verma). Rachel leaves Walford after she receives a job offer at a publishing house in Leeds. Peggy Mitchell Peggy Mitchell, initially played by Jo Warne when she first appears on 30 April 1991, features in the series on a recurring basis over several weeks. Peggy is reintroduced in 1994, recast and played by Barbara Windsor. Peggy becomes a regular character, and Windsor played the role for 16 years. She announced in October 2009 that she would be leaving the show, and departs in September 2010. The character has made annual returns from 2013 onwards for singular episode stints, however, in January 2016, it was revealed that Peggy would be killed off as her cancer would return. Peggy returned to Albert Square for one week in May 2016 for her death, with her character finally committing suicide on 17 May 2016. Peggy is fiercely protective of her family and the Mitchell name, and has become famous for her catchphrase \\"Get outta my pub!\\", used when ejecting people from The Queen Victoria, of which she is the landlady. Her storylines have seen her embark on a series of failed romances, including marriages to Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) and Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb). She has been central to several plot strands revolving around health issues, launching a hate campaign against the HIV positive character Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and going on to make amends with him when she is later diagnosed with breast cancer. Russell Nash Russell Nash, played by Ray Ashcroft, is the ex-boyfriend of Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who arrives in Walford after she unknowingly hires one of his friends to put some bookshelves up for her. He attempts to reconcile with her, but she does not want to get back together with him, and ends up telling him that she had hated their three years together, especially the sex. Kevin Masters Kevin Masters, played by Colin McCormack, owns a minicab firm. Peggy Mitchell (Jo Warne) starts work for him and they begin an affair; however, Peggy is forced to end it when her husband Eric develops cancer. Kevin comes back into Peggy's life promptly after Eric's death, but her children take against him, particularly her daughter Sam (Danniella Westbrook). Kevin attends a family meal at the B&B; where Sam and her boyfriend Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) announce their engagement much to Peggy's shock and anger. Peggy then tells Kevin to warn Ricky off, which he does. When Ricky and Sam are found parked in a van in a graveyard, Kevin and Peggy drag Sam home. He is also present when the Mitchells and Butchers set off to Scotland to find Ricky and Sam in order to stop them marrying. Both families are ultimately unsuccessful. Kevin attends Ricky and Sam's blessing in Walford with Peggy, after he persuades Peggy to attend. Following the blessing Kevin is not seen again. Off-screen, Peggy and Kevin remain together until 1994, when Peggy discovers that he has been cheating on her with another woman. Kevin is later retconned out of existence when Peggy gets together with George Palmer (Paul Moriarty), as she states she hasn't been in a serious relationship since Eric died. Gill Fowler Gill Fowler (also Robinson), played by Susanna Dawson from 1991 to 1992, is the first wife of Mark Fowler (Todd Carty). Gill met Mark in Newcastle during 1989 and they lived together until 1990 when Gill tested positive for HIV and moved to London. Mark discovered that he was HIV positive as well and returned to Walford. The following year, Gill was diagnosed as having AIDS and visits Mark to ask if he has been tested for HIV. At first Mark denies that he has the virus but later admits to her that he is HIV positive. They are never certain which of them had contracted the virus first. They soon rekindle their relationship and Gill marry Mark on 23 June 1992, but she dies in a hospice the following day. Susanna Dawson who played Gill found the experience of playing a person living with and dying from AIDS so intense that she co-produced an educational video based on the subject for use in schools and wrote a book, The Gill and Mark Story, to accompany it. In October 1999, All About Soap magazine placed Mark and Gill's wedding at number six on their twenty greatest soap weddings list. The magazine said \\"Knowing Gill was so close to dying from AIDS, Mark decided his final act of commitment would be to marry her. Sadly, she died in his arms later that afternoon in what remains one of soap's most tear-jerking weddings of all time.\\" Joe Wallace Joe Wallace, played by Jason Rush, is a young, gay chef who is HIV-positive. He arrives in Walford in July 1991 looking for labouring work at the Dagmar renovation. He befriends Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) when he helps him move some freezers, and Ian gets Joe some work on the site and a room at the local B&B.; Joe recognises Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) from the Terrence Higgins Trust, but Mark initially denies that it was him. Ian later gives Joe a job at his restaurant, The Meal Machine. Joe encourages Mark to tell his parents that he is HIV-positive. When Ian discovers that Joe has HIV, he sacks him and disinfects his whole kitchen. Joe then leaves Walford to live with his parents in Cowley and is the last person to see Eddie Royle (Michael Melia) alive before Eddie is murdered in September that year by Nick Cotton Joe saves Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock) from being convicted of the crime, by testifying that he saw Nick climb down his drainpipe the night Eddie was murdered. This implicates Nick as a suspect and provides enough reasonable doubt to secure Clyde's release from custody and Nick is remanded for thirteen months. At Nick's trial in January 1993, Joe briefly returns as a witness. In spite of Joe's testimony, Nick is found not guilty of murder. Joe's mother Jackie (Ann Lynn), writes to Mark telling him he is dying in a hospice in 1994. Joe's death of HIV shocks Mark, but it is visiting the hospice that leads him to meet his future wife, Ruth Aitken (Caroline Paterson). Dave and Irene Carter Dave and Irene Carter want to buy Dot Cotton's (June Brown) house which her son Nick (John Altman) has put up for sale to collect deposits from prospective buyers and keep them to fund his heroin addiction. The Carters give Nick ¬£300, and two days later, Dave arrives with some furniture for the flat, which Nick disposes of. On the day they are due to move in, Dot discovers what Nick has been up to and tells the Carters they will get their money back. Jackie Wallace Jackie Wallace, played by Ann Lynn, is the mother of Joe Wallace (Jason Rush), who is originally seen picking him up from the Fowlers' house to take him home in 1991. When Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) arrives in Cowley to track down Joe two months later in order to exonerate Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock) who is remanded in custody for the murder of Eddie Royle (Michael Melia), Jackie tells him that he is not there and tells him to go back to London. Before Mark leaves, Jackie asks him to keep in touch if he sees Joe. In 1994, she writes a letter to Mark telling him that her son is dying of HIV. Mark goes to visit Joe in a hospice, but arrives too late, and Jackie informs him that Joe had died shortly before he arrived. Steve Elliot Steve Elliot, played by Mark Monero, is first seen in Albert Square in October 1991 as an old school friend of Hattie Tavernier (Michelle Gayle) and Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook). He has a relationship with Hattie, which breaks down after he leaves her to take a job as a chef on an ocean liner, and when he returns, Hattie has moved on. He also falls for his business partner, Della Alexander (Michelle Joseph), however she is a lesbian and rejects his advances. Steve agrees to host an illegal gambling night at his caf√© by a criminal firm, but when he is later asked to testify in court about the event, the firm kidnap Steve's girlfriend Lydia (Marlaine Gordon). when he eventually finds her, the firm threaten to kill Lydia if Steve does not back out of testifying. Fearful for their lives, Steve packs his things and he and Lydia leave Walford in February 1996. Lorraine Stevens Lorraine Stevens (also Salter), originally played by Linda Henry (1991‚Äì1992) and later played by Victoria Alcock (2012), makes her first appearance in November 1991. The character was brought in as part of a storyline focusing on Pat (Pam St Clement) and Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) marital problems. In the storyline, Pat goes to a bar, intending to pick up another man for sex, and meets Lorraine. Pat helps Lorraine when a man starts to harass her, claiming to have spent money on her the night before and implying Lorraine is a prostitute. Shortly after, Lorraine turns up at the Butchers' house, requesting a place to stay. She outstays her welcome and when she is asked to leave, she threatens to tell Frank that Pat has been cruising for other men in bars, causing some difficulty in the Butchers' marriage. Seeing Lorraine's existence makes Pat realise that she has left her promiscuous lifestyle behind her. The following year, in March 1992, Lorraine contacts Pat from hospital. She has been severely beaten by her boyfriend Gary (Thomas Craig) and needs Pat to take care of her 15-year-old daughter Mandy (Nicola Stapleton). Having had her daughter taken into care by the social services in the past, Lorraine wants to prevent this from happening again. Pat is initially unwilling to help, but she eventually relents and Mandy stays at the Butchers'. Lorraine is released from hospital the following week, and she abandons her daughter. Mandy ends up homeless and sleeping on the streets. On Christmas Eve 1992, Lorraine contacts Mandy and tells her she is coming to visit. She does not arrive, so Mandy travels to her flat on Christmas Day to reunite. Lorraine is not there and Mandy is instead greeted by Gary. After getting into a fight with Gary, Mandy flees from her mother's tower block with Mark Fowler (Todd Carty). On 23 January 2012, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy reported Lorraine would be returning to EastEnders the following month. Actress Victoria Alcock was recast in the role, taking over from Henry (who was also on the cast of EastEnders playing a different character, Shirley Carter). Of her casting, Alcock said, \\"I am absolutely thrilled to be joining the cast of EastEnders and am looking forward to working with my good friends Linda Henry and Nicola Stapleton again. I can't wait to see people's reaction when Lorraine arrives on the Square!\\" Kilkelly said Lorraine has remained \\"a brash character and certainly hasn't grown up.\\" Alcock predicted that viewers would be \\"shocked\\" by the actions of Lorraine. Speaking of Lorraine's arrival, Alcock told TV Choice: \\"There will be a collective intake of breath from viewers because just when you think she couldn't stoop any lower, she goes full-steam ahead.\\" Alcock added that the residents of Albert Square will discover why Mandy is such a leech as she gets it from Lorraine. Alcock added: \\"Allegedly she let some awful things happen to Mandy, which may come out in time. I think viewers are interested in the broken shells of a character and she's definitely a broken shell.\\" Alcock also said she wanted Lorraine to be more than just a villain. She said that people are not made this way, something happens to make people the abuser, and that's from being abused. Alcock thought that Lorraine was abused as a child. Returning on 1 March 2012 after 20 years of absence, Lorraine appears in The Queen Victoria public house after Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) contacts her to come to Walford, assuming she is a man that Mandy is having an affair with. Mandy does not want her around, but she bonds with Mandy's partner Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), who invites her to stay with them. When they are alone, Lorraine is verbally and physically abusive to Mandy. Lucy is shocked to overhear Lorraine telling Mandy that nobody cares about her and men do not fall in love with girls like her. During a meal at a restaurant, where Lorraine convinces Ian to order champagne, Lucy reveals that Lorraine has stolen Ian's money and that she is an alcoholic. In retaliation, Lorraine accuses Mandy of using Ian for money and making him work for sex, upon which Ian banishes Lorraine on 9 March 2012. Off-screen, Lorraine causes problems for Mandy by informing Mandy's ex-boyfriend, Alex Foster (Michael Vivian), where she lives, causing Ian to become insecure. Lorraine reappears on 30 April 2012, nearly two months later, claiming that her years of alcohol abuse has left her very ill, and that she is dying. Although Mandy does not believe her initially, she eventually agrees to look after her. Ian forbids this, so Mandy leaves Lorraine outside the tube station, telling her she cannot disobey Ian's wishes. Lorraine, who is doubled over in pain, collapses. Mandy later visits Lorraine in hospital, where they start to bond. However, Lorraine soon turns nasty again and tells Mandy she never loved her. Several weeks later, just before her wedding, Mandy goes to visit Lorraine in hospital but is devastated to learn that she has died. Lorraine's death is not screened. Nobody except Mandy attends Lorraine's funeral, mirroring what Lorraine said to Mandy that nobody would care if she died.

Eight miles (13 km) from the town of Middleburg, the area is home to a number of prominent Thoroughbred-breeding farms and a large country estates. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. History Llangollen, which means \\"land's end\\" in the Welsh language, was originally part of a land grant on which a two-story manor house was built in the late 1770s. Over the years, portions of the Llangollen estate were sold off and in the first part of the 19th century it was owned by Cuthbert Powell who died there in 1849. By 1930, only remained when it was purchased by John Hay \\"Jock\\" Whitney as a wedding gift for his fianc√©e, Mary Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Altemus. Involved with show horses from a young age, Liz Whitney spent a great deal of money turning Llangollen into a major breeding and training center for hunt horses as well as for Thoroughbreds for flat racing and steeplechase events. She renovated and expanded the manor house and built tack rooms, six barns, including a large horseshoe-shaped barn, a stud barn and broodmare sheds. She had paddocks and a training track built on the property and eight employee and guest cottages. Under the name \\"Llangollen Farm\\", Liz Whitney was successfully involved for many years in the sport of Thoroughbred horse racing. Liz and Jock Whitney divorced in June 1940 but she retained the estate and lived there for almost six decades until her death in 1988. During her latter years, the elderly Liz Whitney allowed the property to become run down. She died in 1988, and the property was sold in 1989. =Recent owners= In 1989 the then property was bought by Roy L. Ash and his wife, Lila who saved it from developers who wanted to tear down the buildings and replace them with a multi-home housing complex. Mr. and Mrs. Ash undertook a major restoration of the property and created a large cow-calf operation, raising upward of 300 Angus and Angus- cross cows. They earned wide recognition and received major awards for implementing environmental conservation methods that protected the water on the land through hardened low-water crossings and the creation of acres of riparian buffers that also provided habitat for wildlife. Approaching his ninetieth birthday, in 2007 Roy Ash sold the Llangollen estate sold for $22 million to a corporation controlled by American businessman Donald P. Brennan and his wife, Patricia. Daughter Maureen oversees the property and has formed the VIPolo Club training facility. As of September 2019, the property is again for sale.

Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994. Among them were the Jackson family: mother Carol (Lindsey Coulson), her four children, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Robbie (Dean Gaffney), Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), and Billie (Devon Anderson), as well as Carol's partner Alan Jackson (Howard Antony). Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. The family was created by writer Tony McHale. None of the actors cast as the Jackson family were matched for appearance or screen compatibility. Cassidy has commented, \\"it was all decided without doing that. I don't think it particularly mattered that none of us Jackson kids looked like each other because all our characters had different dads!\\" Carol was Coulson's first major television role. Various members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of Albert Square. Their slow introduction was a deliberate attempt by the programme makers to introduce the whole family over a long period. The Jacksons have been described by EastEnders scriptwriter Colin Brake as a \\"classic problem family\\". Danny Taurus Danny Taurus (real name Danny Travis), played by Billy Boyle, first appears on 5 January 1993 and leaves on 1 June 1993. Danny, an East End rock and roll singer, uses the stage name Danny Taurus, and was nearly famous locally when Pete (Peter Dean) and Pauline Beale (Wendy Richard) were teenagers. In 1993, Danny visits Pete and invites him to a gig. He is more than a pub singer, who dreams of making a comeback. Danny is pleased to meet Pauline again, as he always fancied her when they were at school. Pauline is flattered by the attention and she and Danny go on a few platonic dates‚ÄîPauline's motive being to see if Arthur might respond to a bit of competition‚Äîbut Danny takes it seriously and asks Pauline to go away with him. Pauline is tempted, but she eventually turns Danny down and he goes off in search of his big break. Rose Chapman Rose Chapman, played by Petra Markham, is an old friend of Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) from school. Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Rose get on well, particularly when Rose reveals that she once had a crush on him while they were at school together. Over the weeks a romance develops. Despite professing to be very happy with Pete, Rose frequently lets him down, standing him up on dates and disappearing for days without word. Eventually Pete confronts her and she reveals that not only is she married, but she was married to a local gangster named Alfie Chapman, who had a reputation for extreme violence. Although Alfie is in prison, his family are not and they make it clear that they do not approve of Rose seeing Pete. Pete mulls over what to do but eventually decides to brave the Chapmans and remain with Rose. Alfie's sister Annie warns Rose to finish with Pete, or face severe repercussions from his two brothers. Rose remains defiant and goes to visit Alfie in prison, demanding a divorce. This is curtailed when she discovers that Alfie is suffering from terminal cancer and after a period of contemplation she decides to stop seeing Pete so that she can nurse Alfie through his remaining months. However, Rose cannot keep away from Pete and in May she re-enters his life, telling him that she misses him. When Alfie's brothers discover she was seeing Pete again, they beat her badly, causing her to be hospitalised. Pete goes to visit Rose in hospital and they make plans to go into hiding to escape the wrath of the Chapmans. The following day, Pete smuggles Rose out of hospital with Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) help and they then make their getaway to start a new life. In December, news of Alfie Chapman's death reaches Walford. Pauline places an advert in a newspaper, pleading for Pete and Rose to return. They reply, and the residents of Walford plan a party to celebrate their homecoming. However, on the day they are due back, Pauline is contacted by the police with the news that Pete and Rose have been killed by a car accident arranged by the Chapman family. Aidan Brosnan Aidan Brosnan, played by Sean Maguire, appears between January and December 1993. A popular character, Aidan is involved in storylines about homelessness, drug-abuse and suicide. His relationship with the character Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) is a dominant storyline in the serial throughout 1993. The character of Aidan was introduced on-screen in January 1993 by executive producer, Leonard Lewis. The role was cast to actor Sean Maguire. Having been a familiar face on children's television for many years, Maguire was previously most famous for playing Tegs in BBC's school drama, Grange Hill. At his audition, Maguire had to show off his football skills and talk in a convincing Irish accent. Although the character's duration was relatively short ‚Äì he appeared in only 63 episodes of the soap ‚Äì Aidan became \\"a very popular\\" character, particularly with the young audience. EastEnders scriptwriter Colin Brake has suggested that by the end of his stint in the soap, Sean Maguire's status as a teen pin-up \\"put him in the Take That league\\". Sean Maguire's departure upset his fans, though the actor attempted to develop his appeal towards the young audience by becoming a television presenter and a pop singer. Sanjay Kapoor Sanjay Kapoor, played by Deepak Verma, is a market trader who has an eye for the ladies and a weakness for gambling. He is always full of big ideas and get-rich-quick schemes, which never work. In 1998, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Matthew Robinson. Robinson was dubbed \\"the axeman\\" in the British press, after a large proportion of the EastEnders cast either quit, or were culled, shortly after Robinson's introduction. It was reported that Robinson hoped the changes would attract more viewers and \\"spice up [the soap's fictional setting of] Walford\\". Among the departing characters were long-running Asian family the Kapoors, including Sanjay, Gita (Shobu Kapoor) and Neelam Kapoor (Jamila Massey). As they were the only Asian characters in the show, EastEnders received criticism for axing them from MPs including Oona King, MP for East End constituency Bethnal Green and Dr Ashok Kumar. Gita Kapoor Gita Kapoor, played by Shobu Kapoor, has a fierce temper, which is needed to keep her troublesome husband in check. Any success they achieve is down to her. She is the brains behind the Kapoor's clothes business. Gita played by Shobu Kapoor and her husband Sanjay (Deepak Verma) were introduced early in 1993 by producer Leonard Lewis. They were the first characters of Asian descent to be introduced since the Karim family, who departed from the serial in 1990. The Kapoors are the programme's first attempt to portray non-Muslim Asian characters; the Kapoors are practising Hindus, descending from India. Shobu Kapoor auditioned for the role of Gita along with actress Nina Wadia. Both had been working together on a play prior to auditioning, and neither knew that the other would be attending the audition until they bumped into each other at the casting call. It was Kapoor who was offered the part; Wadia would later go on to play another character years later, Zainab Masood. Snip Gibbons Clive \\"Snip\\" Gibbons, played by Steve Sweeney, is a friend of Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp). He begins frequenting The Queen Victoria pub at the invitation of the Mitchells in February 1993, along with several of their other friends. Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) shows obvious dislike for Snip, mainly because he is frequently teased and tormented by him. Bar manager, Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock), also has several run-ins with him. Snip orders him around, acts in a rowdy manner and antagonises him. Clyde becomes too annoyed so he throws Snip and his friends out of The Vic one night, much to the anger of Phil and Grant, who are trying to secure a business deal with Snip. When Snip and his friends refuse to vacate the pub after closing time one evening, Clyde threatens to quit his job unless they leave. They don't, so Clyde quits but he contacts his boss, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), who is holidaying in America. Sharon returns to find that many of her regulars are refusing to drink at The Vic, mainly because of Snip. She takes control and bars Grant's friends (including Snip), causing him much humiliation, and he ends up hitting her. Audrey Whittingham Audrey Whittingham, played by Shirley Dixon, kidnaps Vicki Fowler (Samantha Leigh Martin) while she is waiting to be collected outside Walford Primary School. A police investigation is launched. Prime suspect is Jack Woodman (James Gilbey), who is infatuated with Vicki's mother Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), however Audrey and Vicki are identified by the shopkeeper of a toy store several days later. Audrey had used a cheque to pay for Vicki's toys and the police were able to trace her to her home. Vicki is returned to her mother unharmed and Audrey is arrested. Michelle becomes very emotional and protective over Vicki for a while after, refusing to let her outside or attend school. She think she can see glimpses of Audrey everywhere she goes, which everyone tells her is impossible, as Audrey has been imprisoned. However, Michelle isn't being paranoid as Audrey turns up on her doorstep shortly after hoping to explain her actions. She has endured a series of tragedies, starting with the death of her baby daughter many years earlier, and later in life the death of one of her sons and her husband. Her other son lives abroad and she has become lonely and desperate. She began to wonder what her daughter would have turned out like and when she saw Vicki alone she decided to take her, although she claims that she intended to bring her back eventually. Michelle is furious and can not forgive Audrey for the trauma she put her and Vicki through. Sharmilla Kapoor Sharmilla Kapoor, played by Priya Bilkhu, is the daughter of Sanjay and Gita Kapoor (Deepak Verma and Shobu Kapoor), born a month after they arrive in Walford in 1993. In October 1997, she leaves with her mother to stay with relatives. They are due to return in January 1998, but Sanjay is late to collect them from the station. When he arrives Gita is nowhere to be seen. When there was no sign of Gita or Sharmilla days later, Sanjay contacts the police. Months later, they are still missing and coincidental evidence has led the police to think that Sanjay may have been responsible for their disappearance. He is even arrested and accused of murder, although he is later released without charge. Everyone assumes that Gita and Sharmilla are dead. But in July 1998 Sanjay finds Gita in Birmingham with a new baby boy, Arjun, conceived during a one-night stand. He takes his family home, vowing to raise Arjun as his own. Sanjay and Gita are happy until local reporter Polly Becker (Victoria Gould) discovers their recent scandal and gets it published in the Walford Gazette. Suddenly all of Walford know what had transpired in Gita's absence. Reporters make their lives miserable and Sharmilla is even bullied at school, so they finally decide to leave Walford. Sharmilla's last appearance is in September 1998.  Sylvia Weng-Chung  Sylvia Weng-Chung, played by Rachel Hiew, is introduced on 1 April as Kathy Mitchell's (Gillian Taylforth) waitress in her caf√©. When Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) catering business is closed down, his wife Cindy (Michelle Collins) turns to Kathy for help. Kathy employs Ian to work in her caf√©, but as a result, she becomes overstaffed and is forced to fire Sylvia in November 1993. Sylvia is extremely angry and says several unpleasant things about Kathy and her caf√© before departing. Sylvia's surname is never mentioned on screen, and only stated on her official cast card. This has caused some confusion as another character named Mrs Weng-Chung worked in the caf√© prior to her appearance. Gidea Thompson Gidea Thompson, played by Sian Martin, made her first appearance on 18 May 1993. Martin recalled that her mother's cleaning lady prayed for her when she auditioned for the role, so when she got it, she immediately went to see her and gave her a hug. Martin admitted that nerves led her to appear awkward and clumsy during her first days on set, so someone had to tell her to correct the way she walked, as she looked ungainly. Martin's character Gidea was introduced as a \\"mysterious long-lost relative of the Taverniers\\". An Inside Soap writer observed that her short stint would impact the family for years to come. Martin said Gidea's presence \\"blows up some of the other problems within the family. Things are going to change. People will be coming back and people will be leaving.\\" She also said that things between Gidea and her cousin Clyde Tavernier (Steven Woodcock) would \\"get pretty steamy\\", but Gidea initially sees their relationship as just a holiday romance, so Cylde could be hurt if he takes things too seriously. Gidea comes to Walford from Trinidad to visit her grandfather, Jules Tavernier (Tommy Eytle). Gidea's mother was the result of an affair Jules had in his early 20s and Jules had previously been unaware of her existence. Jules is apprehensive about pursuing a relationship with Gidea at first, and Gidea's arrival upsets the 'status quo' in the Tavernier family. Hattie Tavernier (Michelle Gayle) takes an instant dislike to her. Gidea decides to leave Walford in the same month, however, her cousin Clyde Tavernier has grown close to her, so he sets about searching London to track her down. The following month, Clyde manages to find her, and after much persuading, Gidea decides to return to Walford so she can get to know her family. She meets her uncle Celestine Tavernier (Leroy Golding) when he returns for Hattie's cancelled wedding, and tells him Jules is her grandfather. She also supports a pregnant Hattie, who considers having an abortion and later changes her mind. Gidea and Clyde grow a lot closer, and even though they are half-cousins, they embark on a relationship. Clyde tries to convince Gidea to extend her visa, but she tells him that she is only in England for a holiday and her life is back in Trinidad. Jules is opposed to their relationship and tries to put a stop to it, but Gidea and Clyde ignore his protests and they eventually decide to leave Walford for a new life together in Trinidad with Clyde's son Kofi Tavernier (Marcel Smith). Debbie Bates Debbie Bates, played by Nicola Duffett, appears from 1993 to 1995. She was introduced as a love-interest for Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley), but was killed off in 1995 on Duffett's request. Duffett grew weary of playing Debbie saying she became too boring and drippy, and asked the producers of EastEnders to kill her character off in 1995, which they did; Debbie was killed in a hit-and-run motor accident. Duffett has commented, \\"I left EastEnders of my own accord, without a shadow of a doubt. I begged to be killed. I ran to the script editor's office. Every time I see him at a party he says, 'I'll never forget you.' Because I ran in crying, 'Kill me NOW! I can't stand it.' Because the part was so boring. I played this simpering wimp, Debbie. All I did was walk into the Vic and say, 'Where's Nigel?'\\" Duffett has stated that she has no regrets about leaving the role, and that she wanted her character killed so she had no opportunity to ever return as she worried about being typecast. Nadia Mitchell Nadia Mitchell (also Borovac), played by Anna Barkan, is Phil Mitchell's (Steve McFadden) first wife. They have a marriage of convenience so Nadia can stay in the country but Phil soon regrets his decision. Nadia is first seen in June 1993. Phil gives Hattie Tavernier (Michelle Gayle) a lift to Southampton so she can stop her boyfriend, Steve Elliot (Mark Monero), from leaving the country. Phil waits for her in a nearby bar and meets Nadia. Nadia is a Romanian refugee who came over to England to be with her boyfriend, Marku (Ravil Isyanov) ‚Äì another immigrant, who has been able to stay in the UK due to a marriage of convenience with an English woman. Nadia is sure that she will be deported. Feeling sorry for her, Phil agrees to marry her so she can stay in the country. He brings her to Walford and they marry on 8 July 1993. Nadia then leaves to live with her boyfriend. Nadia returns in November, needing Phil to play her husband in more realistic ways to prevent her from being deported. While she has been away, Phil has started dating Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) and has not told Kathy about Nadia. When he does tell Kathy, she takes an instant dislike to Nadia. Nadia persuades Phil to allow her to move in with him while the home office investigate and convinces the representative that the relationship is legitimate. However, she does not tell Phil this so he feels that he has no choice but to let her live with him. Feeling jealous of her husband's real girlfriend, Nadia makes things as difficult as possible for them and finally seduces Phil at Christmas 1993 and sleeps with him. Phil regrets it instantly, but Nadia refuses to give up and after getting drunk, she tells Kathy about their tryst. Phil denies it and throws Nadia out in January 1994. She disappears after Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) threatens to kill her if he ever sees her again.\\"EastEnders TUE 04-JAN-94 episode description\\", Walford.net. Retrieved 3 December 2006. Phil and Kathy decide to get married later that year and consequently he goes looking for Nadia as he needs to find her but is unsuccessful. However, Phil visits Marku and finds Nadia with him. She is still angry about the way Phil and Grant had treated her and when Phil asks for a divorce, she refuses. Phil threatens to report her to the authorities, but she promises that if he does, she will disappear and he will then have to wait another two years for a divorce without her consent. However, the following week, Nadia returns to Walford and tells Phil she will divorce him and move to Germany if he gives her ¬£1,000. Phil is angry about her blackmail but has no choice so he gives her the money, after which Nadia leaves and is not seen again.

However, in August he leaves Walford with his family to move to Gravesend. Writing for The People in July 2000, Sharon Marshall revealed Ashley would be returning to EastEnders now played by Frankie Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was appearing in a variety show when he was spotted by a talent scout who suggested he send some photos to the BBC's casting department. A few months later, Fitzgerald was asked to audition for the role of Ashley. While on his way home from the audition, Fitzgerald was told he had won the part. Marshall revealed Fitzgerald was hired after producers noted his resemblance to John Altman, who plays his on screen father, Nick. An EastEnders spokesperson said \\"They could easily be father and son. They've got the same brooding dark-haired looks.\\" Marshall said Fitzgerald was set to \\"steal the show ‚Äì as well as a few young Walford hearts\\" as Ashley. She also stated the character would be a chip off the old block, spelling trouble for the residents of Albert Square. Of his casting, Fitzgerald said \\"I am thrilled and honoured to be playing Nick Cotton's son and can't wait to work with John. People keep asking me what the storylines are but I am as eager as everyone to know.\\" Fitzgerald made his debut as Ashley on 27 July 2000, and appeared until June 2001.

Coulson decided to quit the role in 1997, but she returned temporarily in 1999 as part of a storyline that marked Carol's daughter Bianca's (Patsy Palmer exit. On 25 October 2009 it was confirmed that she would return along with other members of the Jackson family, Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), Robbie (Dean Gaffney) and Billie (Devon Anderson), on 15 February 2010, although her first appearance in 2010 is in EastEnders: Last Tango in Walford, an episode released exclusively to DVD on 8 February 2010. 1994 was a historic year for EastEnders, as in April, a third weekly episode was introduced. Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994. Among them were the Jackson family: mother Carol, her four children, Bianca, Robbie, Sonia and Billie, as well as Carol's partner Alan Jackson (Howard Antony). Though Carol and Alan are not initially married in the serial, and though Alan is only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. The family was created by writer Tony McHale. None of the actors cast as the Jackson family were matched for appearance or screen compatibility. Cassidy has commented, \\"it was all decided without doing that. I don't think it particularly mattered that none of us Jackson kids looked like each other because all our characters had different dads!\\" Carol was Coulson's first major television role. Alan Jackson Alan Jackson is played by Howard Antony. He originally appears between 1993 and 1997, and returns on 12 October 2010 for three episodes. Kind-hearted Alan gives the Jackson family some much needed stability. He loves and cares for Carol's (Lindsey Coulson) children as if they are his own. Their relationship does not go so smoothly however. Carol's stubborn and nagging nature eventually drives him into the arms of another woman. Alan has been described as a good, reliable, hard-working father and well integrated into his community. Alan's main storyline during his initial four years in EastEnders surrounds his interracial marriage to Carol Jackson and being a paternal figure to Carol's children, three of whom were fathered by other men. Antony has revealed that his portrayal was partly based on his own life experiences, as he had grown up with siblings with different fathers to his own. Antony told author Larry Jaffee, \\"Alan was so family oriented, but I liked that a young black guy who was very responsible, mature ‚Äì that was something that I was very comfortable with because it was something I grew up with to a point. To me, if you love someone you love everything about them. It's not 'I love you, but I don't love your kids'. It was something I was very glad to do. The whole black-and-white thing, I think we're at a stage now that people are more informed.\\" Bianca Jackson Bianca Butcher (also Jackson) is played by Patsy Palmer. The character was introduced by executive producer Leonard Lewis and appeared initially from 1993 to 1999, when Palmer opted to leave. In 2002 executive producer John Yorke brought the character back for a special spin-off show. She returned to EastEnders as a full-time character in April 2008, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer. Palmer took maternity leave in 2010, and Bianca was temporarily written out on 21 January 2011. She announced her return on 19 July and made her return on 15 December 2011. During her first run on the show during the 1990s, she is known for her bizarre sense of style, her sharp tongue and fiery temper and for screaming \\"Rickaaaaaaay!\\"\\" at her husband. Bianca has been featured in storylines including affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, spina bifida and abortion, a problematic marriage to Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and the revelation of her 15-year-old adoptive daughter Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) being sexually abused by her fianc√© Tony King (Chris Coghill) and his subsequent arrest for paedophilia. Sonia Fowler Sonia Fowler,\\"Helpdesk\\", BBC'.' Retrieved 3 March 2007. played by Natalie Cassidy, is the youngest daughter of Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson). Her first appearance is on 2 December 1993 and she leaves on 2 February 2007. However, she returns brieflyNatalie: I left over lesbian plot MSN TV UK in 2010 along with other members of the Jackson family and re-appears on the soap from 8 to 18 February 2010. She returns again for a single episode on 21 January 2011. Natalie Cassidy won the award for \\"Best Actress\\" for the role of Sonia, at the 2001 British Soap Awards. Additionally, in 2004, Cassidy was awarded \\"best dramatic performance by a young actor or actress\\" for the role. Referencing Sonia's foray into lesbianism in 2005, TV critic Grace Dent branded the character \\"the worst lesbian ever\\", adding, \\"The only lesbians with less lesbian tendencies than you are the women on the front cover of the Horny Triple-X Lesbian Specials which they keep at eye level by the sweets in my corner shop. Time to make a u-turn.\\" Lesbian website AfterEllen.com was also critical of the storyline that saw Sonia experimenting with her sexuality and then returning to her heterosexual orientation shortly after. Lucy Beale Lucy Beale, played by Eva Brittin-Snell from 1993 to 1996, Casey Anne Rothery from 1996 until 2004, Melissa Suffield from 2004 to 2010 and Hetti Bywater from 2012 to 2015 is the daughter of Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins). She is the twin sister of Peter (Thomas Law), and has three half siblings, older brother Steven (Edward Savage, Aaron Sidwell), younger sister Cindy (Eva Sayer) and younger brother Bobby (Alex Francis). Apart from her on- screen birth, the character has few storylines of her own until 2004 when the role was recast to an older actress. Storylines featuring Lucy have since focused upon her teenage rebellion. In 2010, Suffield left EastEnders, after she was allegedly axed due to \\"unruly behaviour.\\" On 14 November 2011, it was announced Lucy would be returning in 2012 with Bywater taking over the role. She returned on 12 January 2012. In February 2014 it was announced that the character would be killed off. She made her final appearance on 22 April 2014 when her father goes to identify her body. In July 2007, Gareth McLean of The Guardian lamented the lack of strong female characters in EastEnders, noting that Lucy \\"is yet to come into her own\\". Fellow Guardian critic Grace Dent commented on the repetitive nature of EastEnders storylines by comparing Lucy's relationship with Jane (Laurie Brett) to the fraught mother-daughter bond between Kat (Jessie Wallace) and Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan). Peter Beale Peter Beale, played by Francis Brittin-Snell from 1993 to 1996, Alex Stevens from 1997 to 1998, Joseph Shade from 1998 to 2004, James Martin from 2004 to 2006, Thomas Law from 2006 until 2010 and Ben Hardy from 2013 onwards, is the son of Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins). He is the twin brother of Lucy (Hetti Bywater), and has three half siblings, older brother Steven (Edward Savage, Aaron Sidwell), younger sister Cindy (Eva Sayer) and younger brother Bobby (Alex Francis). Peter left EastEnders on 24 December 2010, with a return not ruled out but unconfirmed. Peter was introduced in 1993 along with his twin sister Lucy, and was originally played by Francis Brittin-Snell as a baby and toddler from 1993 to 1996. In 1997, the role was given to Alex Stevens and he played Peter until 1998. Joseph Shade took over until 2004 and James Martin played him from 2004 until 2006. It was announced on 17 August 2006 that actor Thomas Law had been cast as Peter. Law said of the role: \\"I couldn't believe it when I heard that I got the part, I'm really excited as I am a big fan of EastEnders.\\" He made his first appearance on 31 August 2006. He is described on the EastEnders website as being laid back, and Ian's \\"golden boy\\". In May 2009, Executive producer Diederick Santer praised the younger cast of EastEnders, including Law. Stuart Heritage from The Guardian expressed a dislike for Peter in April 2010, saying he should be written out, \\"before his increasingly spectacular haircut goes power mad and starts to colonise the entire set. Also, his voice has been breaking for what seems like seven full years, so he could probably use his new-found free time to consult a doctor or something.\\" Kevin Kevin, played by John Pickard, is a recurring character appearing from 1993 to 1996. He is the teenage friend of Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney), who first appears along with Robbie in December 1993. He and Robbie frequently get into trouble doing such things as stealing alcohol from The Queen Victoria public house. They joyride Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) car and crash it into Michelle Fowler's (Susan Tully) wall on Albert Square in April 1994. Robbie is left unconscious in the wreckage, while Kevin flees home, fearing the repercussions. Robbie isn't seriously harmed, and manages to avoid trouble from the police because he is a minor. Kevin eventually pays for the damage in July 1994, after inheriting money from his recently deceased grandmother. Kevin is with Robbie in October 1994, when they find Wellard the dog, who becomes Robbie's inseparable sidekick. Kevin also attends the Jacksons' house party in January 1995, where he gets extremely drunk and tries unsuccessfully to seduce all of Bianca Jackson's (Patsy Palmer) friends. He is forced to help clear the mess the following day after a riot breaks out at the party and the police are called in. Later in the year, Robbie is fired from his paper round, for dumping all the newspapers without delivering them. Kevin goes behind his back and takes the job, then proceeds to call on Robbie's old customers for a Christmas bonus. Kevin and Robbie try another money making scheme in December 1995, when they go carol singing under the guise that they are collecting money for the widow of a deceased scoutmaster. Robbie's sister, Bianca, finds out about the scam and blackmails them into giving her a cut of their proceeds. This eventually leads to further scamming, when they attend a pensioners bingo night at an old people's home. However, they are caught out when one of the residents turns out to be the widow of the deceased scoutmaster and they are forced to hand over all their profits to her. Kevin last appears in February 1996, where he and Robbie get a free haircut from a trainee hairdresser. Robbie is given highlights, which turn out disastrously, much to Kevin's amusement. Robbie Jackson Robbie Jackson, played by Dean Gaffney from 1993 to 2003, is the eldest son of Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson). The character was axed in 2003 by executive producer Louise Berridge. He makes brief returns in 2004 and 2010 for two family weddings, and in 2015 for Carol's exit storyline. Introduced as a 15-year-old school boy, Robbie is initially portrayed as troublesome; frequently playing truant, occasionally shoplifting and, as author Kate Lock suggests, \\"generally making a nuisance of himself\\". However, Lock observes that this aspect of the character was toned down eventually, and \\"the unfortunate Robbie became less of a lout and more of a [...] prat, forever mucking things up and being the fall guy.\\" Gaffney reprised the role briefly in 2004, when he returned as Robbie to attend his sister Sonia's (Natalie Cassidy) wedding. The character's return was only scripted for a couple of episodes. Gaffney has expressed an interest in returning, commenting in 2006. On 25 October 2009, it was announced that Gaffney would once again reprise his role. The family return for Bianca's (Patsy Palmer) second wedding to Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) as part of the show's 25th anniversary.

After initially leaving in 1997, Billie returns in 2010, along with other members of the Jackson family.

She makes a further guest appearance in 2000 for the funeral of Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). Nellie has been described as a \\"pantomime baddie\\". Her name precedes her in the soap before her initial appearance as she is frequently used as an excuse for Pauline to leave the soap's setting to visit her. Author Kate Lock described Nellie as stingy and an interfering old busybody. She stated, \\"When stingy Nellie wasn't giving Arthur (Bill Treacher) grief, she was flirting in a button-up sort of way with Jules Tavernier (Tommy Eytle).\\" David Wicks David Wicks, played by Michael French, originally appears between 1993 and 1996. He returns on 1 January 2012, for the departure storyline of his mother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement), and departs again on 13 January 2012. In September 2011, it was rumoured that David and Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) were to return to EastEnders for Pat's departure storyline. The Sun reported producers were working to get French and Berry on board. A BBC spokesperson declined to comment on the report, saying \\"There has been a lot of speculation surrounding Pat's departure, however we are not going to comment on rumours at this stage as we don't want to spoil the storyline for viewers.\\" On 13 November 2011, it was confirmed French would be reprising his role as David after an absence of 15 years. In All About Soap Awards 2012, Michael French won the Best Comeback award for his brief return as David Wicks. It was confirmed in July 2013 that David will return to EastEnders later in the year.

Natalie Evans Natalie Evans (also Price) is played by Lucy Speed between 1994 and 2004. Natalie first appears in January 1994, depicted initially as an unhappy, insecure teenager; she was among various regular characters brought in to increase the cast following the BBC's decision to increase episode output to 3 per week. She features most often with the characters Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer); Natalie's affair with Ricky ending his relationship with Bianca was one of the prominent storylines aired in the Winter of 1995. Despite producers offering to extend Speed's contract, she opted to leave the serial in 1995. Executive producer Matthew Robinson reintroduced the character in 1999 as a business woman and a love interest for Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson). Speed left once again in 2004, with Natalie departing in the wake of Barry's murder by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Carmen Actress Amanda Holden appeared as Carmen for nearly two months. Carmen, played by Amanda Holden, is introduced as a market trader on Bridge Street market. She appears between episode 942, first broadcast on 8 February, and episode 954, first broadcast on 22 March. Carmen first appears when she is employed by Richard Cole (Ian Reddington) to work on Sanjay Kapoor (Deepak Verma)'s clothing stall on Bridge Street market. Carmen begins to pester Richard to give her the licence for the pitch on a permanent basis. However, later that month Sanjay returns, having failed to trace the whereabouts of his estranged wife, Gita (Shobu Kapoor), scuppering Carmen's plan. Following this, Carmen begins selling heart-patterned boxer-shorts on the market and a pair are sent anonymously to Richard. Richard assumes they were from a secret admirer, until he sees Carmen selling them the following day. She tells him that they aren't a popular line and that she'd only had one buyer, Sanjay. Sanjay had bought them to prank Richard, but as Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and Natalie Price (Lucy Speed) had spent the last few weeks winding him up in a similar way, he does not find the prank amusing. Carmen is not seen again after this. Della Alexander Della Alexander is played by Michelle Joseph. First seen in March 1994, Della becomes a potential love interest for her business partner, Steve Elliot (Mark Monero). However, it is soon revealed that Della is a lesbian, and Steve (along with some other residents of Albert Square) struggles to accept this. Della and her girlfriend Binnie Roberts (Sophie Langham) are the first lesbian couple to be featured in EastEnders. Their inclusion was an attempt to portray positive examples of homosexual characters. Della and Binnie soon grow disillusioned with Walford, and the couple leave for Ibiza in May 1995. Dougie Briggs Dougie Briggs, played by Max Gold, appears for several weeks over the spring of 1994, and is actively involved in the storyline that marked the introduction of EastEnders' third weekly episode, The Queen Vic Siege. Dougie had been a paratrooper alongside Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) in the Falklands War, and meets up with him again more than 10 years later, by which time Grant is the landlord of The Queen Victoria public house. Grant allows Dougie to stay at The Vic, despite his wife Sharon (Letitia Dean)'s objections. Sharon begins to feel uncomfortable around Dougie after noticing him leering at her on several occasions, but Grant refuses to ask him to leave. Dougie persuades Grant to help him out with a raid on a supermarket, promising him a vast financial return, but Grant starts to have second thoughts when he finds Dougie's sawn-off shotgun. After doing some investigating, Grant discovers that Dougie had been discharged from the paratroopers because psychological tests had revealed that he was psychopathic. Dougie tried to stop the Medical Officer from filing the results, and when he refused Dougie shot him in the head and then raped his wife. Realising that he has left Sharon alone in the Vic with a convicted murderer and rapist, Grant flees home and arrives just as Dougie is attempting to sexually assault Sharon. A fight ensues and Grant is knocked unconscious, after which Dougie holds Grant, Sharon and barmaid Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) hostage with his shotgun, and demands money. The gun goes off when Grant tries to claim it and Michelle gets in the way of a stray bullet and ends up in a pool of blood on the Vic's floor. Grant overpowers Dougie, and beats him unconscious, but he is forced to leave him in the Vic while he takes Michelle to hospital. He contacts his brother Phil (Steve McFadden) to get rid of Dougie's body and gun, but by the time Phil arrives at the Vic, Dougie has escaped. Grant is convinced that Dougie will return for revenge, however he is apprehended by the police before he can get to the Vic. Elizabeth Willmott- Brown Elizabeth Willmott-Brown, played by Helena Breck, is the ex-wife of rapist James Willmott-Brown (William Boyde). One of James's victims, Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), begins to have a recurring nightmare about her rape in 1994. Her boyfriend, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), decides to go in search of James to scare him away. He traces him to Elizabeth's home, but she tells him that James is not in and she is unsure when he will be back. Phil refuses to give up and when Elizabeth leaves her house many hours later, he demands that she tell him where James is because he has raped his girlfriend. Elizabeth gets angry and tells Phil she is well aware that James is a rapist, but she is trying to protect her two children from it. She also reveals that James has been imprisoned for the rape of another woman. In 1987, during a conversation with Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), James refers to his wife as \\"Clare\\", from whom he has been divorced for some months. In 1988, James refers to his wife as \\"Anne\\" over the telephone. In September 2017, Elizabeth's daughter Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), tells Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) that her mother killed herself after falling into depression, and that she found her in the bath. Geoff Barnes Geoff Barnes is played by David Roper. Geoff is introduced as a love interest for the long running character, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), in 1994. He is much older than Michelle, and their age difference causes most of the major problems in their relationship. They plan to marry, but in the end Geoff realises that Michelle doesn't really love him. He ends the relationship and moves to Scotland in April 1995, but returns in September as part of Michelle's exit storyline. His last appearance is in October 1995. Blossom Jackson Blossom Jackson is played by Mona Hammond. Blossom is the grandmother of Alan Jackson (Howard Antony), and the character originally appears from 1994 to 1997. Blossom was installed as a matriarchal figure of the Jackson clan, but Hammond quit the role in 1997, reportedly because she was suffering from nervous exhaustion. She reprised the role on 25 October 2010 for two episodes. Binnie Roberts Binnie Roberts is played by Sophie Langham. Binnie is an out and proud lesbian, which is in stark contrast to her shy and retiring girlfriend, Della Alexander (Michelle Joseph). After facing prejudice from their neighbours, and Della struggling to admit her sexuality to her family, the pair decide to leave Walford for Ibiza in 1995. Binnie and Della are the first lesbian couple to be featured in EastEnders. Their inclusion was an attempt to portray positive examples of homosexual characters.

Diane claims that Jacques has refused to attend the funeral of his grandfather, Frank in April 2008. Maxine Palmer Maxine Palmer, played by Dilys Laye, is the mother of Debbie Tyler (Nicola Duffett), who appears during Debbie and Nigel (Paul Bradley)'s courtship. She gets on well with Nigel, and he likes her. She returns in 1995 after Debbie's death, to help Nigel look after Debbie's daughter Clare (Gemma Bissix), and to support him in his custody battle against Clare's biological father, Liam Tyler (Francis Magee). Ruth Fowler Ruth Fowler (also Aitken) is played by Caroline Paterson from 1994 to 1999. Ruth is Mark Fowler (Todd Carty)'s second wife and she is far more comfortable with his HIV status than many of his other girlfriends. However their marriage eventually disintegrates due to Mark's inability to provide Ruth with a child. They split and she strays with Mark's cousin, Conor Flaherty (Se√°n Gleeson). Her betrayal deeply hurts Mark, but it also gives her the chance to be a mother, as she becomes pregnant with Conor's child. Wellard Wellard is a fictional dog from the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Wellard is a Belgian Tervuren, and first appears on 18 October 1994, and becomes EastEnders longest-serving pet, before being killed off on 15 August 2008. Although the character is male, he has been played primarily by three female dogs: Zenna, her daughter Chancer, and her granddaughter Kyte. A fourth dog briefly served as a replacement for Zenna in 1996, when she was given time off from the show to have a litter of puppies. Wellard was briefly written out of the series under executive producer Matthew Robinson, but returned when Robinson was succeeded by John Yorke. Wellard's owners for the majority of his duration in the soap are Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney) and Gus Smith (Mohammed George). He was voted \\"Best Pet\\" at the 2008 Digital Spy Soap Awards, and named the UK's favourite soap opera pet in a 2009 Inside Soap poll. Wellard was a fan favourite, and although a storyline that saw him threatened with euthanasia for biting local caf√© owner Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) was poorly received by critics, his death drew generally favourable reviews. Reg Simpson Reg Simpson, played by Philip Manikum, owns the bed and breakfast in Eastbourne where Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) and Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly) stay in November 1994. When Reg notices Arthur's contempt for Nellie, he sympathises with him about interfering in-laws. On the day of their departure, Nellie goes missing, and Reg informs Arthur that he had seen her heading for the beach in a sombre mood. The Fowlers fear for her safety, but she is only having a paddle in the ocean. Stanley Bridge Stanley Bridge, played by Godfrey Jackman, attends the funeral and wake of Nellie Ellis (Elizabeth Kelly)'s former husband, George, in November 1994. Stanley is a wheelchair-bound amputee, having lost both of his legs. Stanley reveals to Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) that he and George had been best friends. When he discovers that Nellie is living with Arthur, Stanley offers his commiserations, saying he'd rather have no legs than put up with her. Stanley reveals that he had been the best man at George and Nellie's wedding, and that he had warned George that Nellie would make his life a misery on his stag night. He is full of praise for George's mistress and long-term partner, Doreen (Olga Lowe). Nellie overhears everything and finds his comments hard to take. Roy Evans Roy Evans is played by Tony Caunter. Introduced by Series Producer Barbara Emile in 1994, Roy was scripted as a love interest for Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). He remained a screen regular until 2003, when Executive Producer Louise Berridge axed him. Barry Evans Barry Evans is played by Shaun Williamson. He appears between 1994 and 2004. The character is portrayed as a \\"buffoon.\\"Barry Evans played by Shaun Williamson Williamson controversially left the serial after ten years in 2003 after executive producer Louise Berridge refused to allow him time off to star in a seasonal pantomime. Barry is killed off in an episode that first aired early in January 2004.

The procedures and technologies required to collect these cues are non-invasive (like surveillance cameras and body heat sensors) and amenable to integration into busy operational contexts, like airports. In addition to detecting these cues, this project examines whether this process can be automated through the use of sensors and detection algorithms and, subsequently, integrated with other technologies aimed at identifying individuals who pose threats to the U.S.A., e.g., biometric tools and databases.

A former member of parliament specializing in defense matters, R√∏sjorde has resigned from active politics and served as County Governor of Oslo and Akershus from 2001 to 2011. Early life and education Born in Brunlanes, Vestfold, R√∏sjorde was the son of Josef A. R√∏sjorde (1917‚Äì1993) and Torborg Haugene (1915‚Äì1953). When he was in his early teen years his father who was an architect got employment as buildings manager for Oslo's forestry administration and the family moved to Midtstuen in the prestigious Holmenkollen part of the capital. His father has designed many of the popular public cabins in the Oslo forests. Probably the most astonishing event in R√∏sjorde's life took place when 19 years old, straight out of Ris Upper Secondary School, was assigned the job as headmaster at Senjahopen in Troms. Besides his administrative chores this position also taught him to appreciate the teaching vocation. R√∏sjorde has both a civilian and a military education. In 1970 he graduated cand.real. from the University of Oslo having majored in marine biology. He then worked as a lector from 1970 through 1987. From 1970 to 1972 at Breidablikk School in Sandefjord, Vestfold, and from 1972 to 1987 at Stord Upper Secondary School in Hordaland where he also was school counselor. Hans J. R√∏sjorde has a military education (befalskole) and was in the service during the period 1962-1990. In 1982 he attained to the rank of captain. He has been a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (1989‚Äì2001) and in conjunction with this has held miscellaneous NATO positions. Between 1974 and 1990 he was local commander of the Norwegian Home Guard for Stord. Between 2002 and 2006 he served as president of the Norwegian Reserve Officers' Association. Political career Having previously served in the position of deputy representative from Hordaland during the term 1981-1985 and 1985-1989, R√∏sjorde first became a parliamentarian in 1987, midway through the second term when he permanently replaced the deceased Bj√∏rn Erling Ytterhorn. He was then elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1989, and he was re-elected on two occasions. R√∏sjorde was a prominent member of Parliament, serving as President of the Lagting (1989-1993), as chair of the defense committee (1989-2001), and finally becoming Vice President of the Storting (1997-2001). Before entering the national political scene R√∏sjorde was a member of Stord municipal council from 1979 to 1989. In 2001 he became the County Governor of Oslo and Akershus, succeeding K√•re Willoch. He was the first County Governor for the Progress Party. He retired in 2011. He joined the Norwegian Parliamentary Intelligence Oversight Committee in 2011. His role as a prominent politician from the Norwegian Progress Party has, unlike for most of his party comrades, not been stained by involvement in intrigue and the many conflicts that is associated with that party. In an interview with the newspaper Aftenposten in connection with his 60th birthday and his start as County Governor he himself describes his role as \\"rather that of a mediator and advisor\\". Hans R√∏sjorde currently lives in Oslo, having moved there from Stord when he took up his post as County Governor. As a hobby, he takes care of his antique Willy's Jeep. References # * # Hans J.

Comprising over of exhibit space, Discovery Gateway is located at 444 West 100 South in The Gateway. History The Children's Museum of Utah was founded in 1978 and opened its doors in 1983. For most of its history, TCMU was located in the former Wasatch Warm Springs building two miles north of downtown Salt Lake City. The museum started with only eight exhibits. Some of these original exhibits included the paleontology dig of a mammoth dinosaur bones, a Western Airline's 737 cockpit, the artificial heart demonstration, the frozen bubble box using dry ice, and the KSL news station for children. By 1998, TCMU had grown to 140 permanent exhibits and over of public space. That year, it had become evident that TCMU had reached the physical limits imposed by its current building, and the decision was made to relocate and expand to better serve the community. In 2002, a bond issue was approved by Salt Lake County voters to fund the relocation of TCMU to a new, larger building in the Gateway District of Salt Lake City. Ground was broken on the new Museum on 22 September 2005. Less than one year later, on 16 September 2006, TCMU opened to the public at its current location and officially became Discovery Gateway. Exhibits Everything at Discovery Gateway is designed with kids in mind. The exhibits are all interactive and hands-on. Exhibits on the second floor of the museum include the Garden, where kids can play music together on a giant marimba, keep an enormous machine humming, or peer into a ‚Äúpenny drop‚Äù to see how every little bit adds up. Just behind the Garden is Kid's Eye View, a kid- sized town where kids can shop in the Market, build structures in the Construction Zone, or feed the animals on the Utah Family Farm. Within Kid's Eye View is Hatch, Waddle, and Fly, an area dedicated just to children under the age of three. The third floor of the museum features the Story Factory, where kids direct the action by putting on a play, drawing a comic strip, or making a stop-motion animated film. Also located on the third floor is the Studio, where the worlds of science, invention, and art meet. The museum's outdoor terrace houses Saving Lives From The Sky, which includes a real Intermountain Healthcare Life Flight helicopter for visitors to learn about rescue operations. Special exhibits A special exhibits gallery hosts rotating exhibits from museums around the nation. Previous exhibits have included Robots: The Interactive Exhibition, Sesame Street Presents: The Body, and Invention at Play. Programs Discovery Gateway's programs explore science, art, and the humanities. Workshops and classes are geared to meet the needs of children ages birth - 12. Early Childhood Education classes take place daily in the Curiosity Shop and let kids practice fine and gross motor skills. Programs and workshops for older kids take place in the Workshop Room and often focus on the exhibits at the museum. Discovery Gateway prints a calendar of classes every month. Outreach Discovery Gateway offers a chemistry program, Reaction Time, to every 5th grade class in the state of Utah. Over 55,000 children from every county in Utah have participated in this program. Junior Achievement city Discovery Gateway, in conjunction with Junior Achievement of Utah, operates Junior Achievement City, the only JA Enterprise Village/Finance Park program facility within of Salt Lake City.

Doug Block was taught how to create a blog by Justin Hall, the subject of Block's 1999 feature documentary, Home Page. Scenes of Hall showing Block how to create the D-word are shown in the film. The site evolved from online journal to a virtual community for documentary filmmakers and fans in the fall of 1999. Early topics included Festivals, Events & Happenings, DV Production, Fundraising, Rights and Clearances, Marketing Through the Internet, Distribution and Shameless Self-Promotion. There were also more social topics called the ‚ÄúBar & Grill‚Äù and the ‚ÄúRant Room‚Äù. It started as a private space within Howard Rheingold's Brainstorms community.

The agreed to rate was not restored until 1958 after a Supreme Court judgement and Congressional action. African Reefer had operated as a commercial refrigerated fruit carrier until seizure. After July 1942 the vessel operated in the Pacific as part of Service Force, Pacific Fleet. The vessel was returned to post war owners 14 June 1946 at San Francisco. Commercial service The motorship was built by Helsing√∏r Jernskibs og Maskinbyggeri, Helsing√∏r (Elsinore), Denmark. The ship was launched 14 September 1935 as Pacific Reefer, but performed trials as Yrsa and in 1936 was renamed for the refrigerated fruit trade for Denmark's J. Lauritzen shipping line as African Reefer, IMO 5004362. In 1938 the ship transported one of the first refrigerated fruit cargoes from Puerto Armuelles, Panama to San Francisco after the U.S. shipping lines ceased operation on the route. Wartime seizure African Reefer was enroute from the United States to the Mediterranean on 9 April 1940 when Germany occupied Denmark. The ship was directed by the company to put into Funchal, Madeira. African Reefer was laid up there until August 1941 when the ship left Funchal for New York. On 6 June 1941 the ship, which had sailed to a U.S. port on specific promises of equal treatment to U.S. vessels, was one of forty Danish vessels seized by the United States Maritime Commission. On 5 September 1941 the ship, renamed Roamer, was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for operation by its agent, Marine Operating Company, Inc., under the Panamanian flag until delivered on 3 December 1941 for operation by the War Department under bareboat charter as an Army transport. The ship was returned to WSA and Marine Operating Company service on 18 March 1942 at New York. The Navy and WSA were negotiating charter arrangements for the ship, again allocated to Army requirements, with the result that WSA, Navy, and Army agreed to allocate the ship to Service Force, Pacific Fleet as a stores provision ship. The ship had sailed in July for New Zealand so that the Navy sent a naval crew to the ship at Auckland, New Zealand which was turned over to the Navy on bareboat charter on 22 July 1942. Roamer was commissioned at Auckland on 30 August 1942, Comdr. Maximillian B. De Leshe in command.  Service career  The storeship arrived at New Caledonia on 15 September, returned to Auckland, New Zealand, 8 October, and reached Espiritu Santo 27 December. She continued runs from Auckland to the New Hebrides, and to Guadalcanal, until April 1944. She then stopped at Pago Pago, Tongatapu, Funafuti, Wallis, Tutuila, and Efate. Returning to Noum√©a on 2 May, she touched at Suva, Funafuti, Tutuila, and Tongatapu before returning to Auckland. She then proceeded north again to Tutuila, Tongatapu, and Guadalcanal. Returning to Auckland on 2 November, she continued to make runs north from New Zealand for the rest of the war. On 5 September 1945, she departed Auckland for Pearl Harbor and San Francisco. Returning to the South Pacific in February 1946, Roamer touched at Tutuila, Noum√©a, Guadalcanal, and Guam, then proceeded on to Tokyo arriving 16 April. Departing Japan 6 days later, Roamer arrived at San Francisco, California, on 7 May 1946, decommissioned and was redelivered to WSA on 14 June 1946 and was struck from the Navy List on 3 July 1946. = Military awards and honors = Roamer's crew members were authorized the following medals: * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal Return to Danish control On 14 June 1946 African Reefer was returned to owners Rederiet Ocean Aktieselskab (then a subsidiary of J. Lauritzen), Copenhagen, Denmark under Public Law 101 at San Francisco. African Reefer had been seized with the Danish Minister consenting under the condition that the ship's title remain with Denmark and the seizure only for use. Further, that the payment for use be equal for that of U.S. ships under charter. Both the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of State had affirmed to Congress that the ships would be justly compensated at full value. African Reefer had sailed from Madeira to the United States under that specific understanding. Instead the titles to the ships had been seized and they had been hired at a rate 50% below the U.S. vessel charter rate. The case, upon failure of negotiations, went to the Supreme Court which affirmed that the vessel should be paid at the full value yet only by Congressional action in 1958 was the settlement for full payment made. In 1963 the ship was sold to breakers in Rotterdam. A part of the hull was used as a floating Chinese restaurant in Lobith, Netherlands.  See also  * USS Pontiac (AF-20) (J.

Fay Fueller hosted a romantic music show consisting of poetry and music in 1958. In 1968, the station switched from a country music format to country/gospel.Atlanta Radio Time Warp 1968 The station aired a \\"Town and Country\\" radio format by 1970.Atlanta Area AM Radio Stations During the early 1970s the station flipped to an all-news radio format for a time, one of the first in the Atlanta radio market. In 1980, WYZE changed to a gospel format relying mainly on brokered programming. WYZE went silent in November 2018 due to technical problems that would have required cost-prohibitive repairs. It was reported that then-owner GHB Broadcasting intended to sell WYZE's existing property and relocate, and had also received offers for the station's license and equipment. Effective May 30, 2019, GHB Broadcasting consummated the sale of WYZE to New Ground Broadcasting, LLC for $20,000.

Usually, the annunciator panel includes a main warning lamp or audible signal to draw the attention of operating personnel to the annunciator panel for abnormal events or condition. Aviation In the aircraft industry, annunciator panels are groupings of annunciator lights that indicate status of the aircraft's subsystems. The lights are usually accompanied with a test switch, which when pressed illuminates all the lights to confirm they are in working order. More advanced modern aircraft replaces these with the integrated electronic Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System or Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor. An aviation annunciator panel will have a test switch to check for burned out lamps. Indicator lights are grouped together by their associated systems into various panels of lights.Photos: British Aerospace BAe-146-200A Aircraft Pictures  Airliners.net Lamp colours are normally given the following meanings: * Red: Warning, this systems condition is critical and requires immediate attention (such as an engine fire, hydraulic pump failure) * Amber: Caution, this system requires timely attention or may do so in the future (ice detected, fuel imbalance) * Green: Advisory/Indication, a system is in use or ready for operation (such as landing gear down and locked, APU operating) * White/blue: Advisory/Indication, a system is in use (seatbelt signs on, anti-ice system in-use, landing lights on) The annunciator panel may display warnings or cautions that are not necessarily indicative of a problem; for example, a Cessna 172 on its after-landing roll will often flicker the \\"Volts\\" warning simply due to the idle throttle position and therefore the lower voltage output of the alternator to the aircraft's electrical system. More complicated aircraft will feature Master Warning and Master Caution lights/switches. In the event of any red or yellow annunciator being activated, the yellow or red master light, usually located elsewhere in the pilot's line of sight, will illuminate. In most installations they will flash and an audible alert will accompany them. These \\"masters\\" will not stop flashing until they have been acknowledged, usually by pressing the light itself, and in some cases the audible alert will also continue until this acknowledgement. On some aircraft (most Boeing airliners, for example) the \\"masters\\" will also flash briefly and the audible alert will sound whenever the autopilot is disconnected, as an additional reminder to the pilots that manual control is now required. Process control In industrial process control, an annunciator panel is a system to alert operators of alarm conditions in the plant. Multiple back-lit windows are provided, each engraved with the name of a process alarm. Lamps in each window are controlled by hard- wired switches in the plant, arranged to operate when a process condition enters an abnormal state (such as high temperature, low pressure, loss of cooling water flow, or many others). Single point or multipoint alarm logic modules operate the window lights based on a preselected ISA 18.1 or custom sequence. In one common alarm sequence, the light in a window will flash and a bell or horn will sound to attract the operator's attention when the alarm condition is detected. The operator can silence the alarm with a button, and the window will remain lit as long as the process is in the alarm state. When the alarm clears (process condition returns to normal), the lamps in the window go out. Alarm Annunciator used for process controls Alarm Annunciators being used in electricity distribution substations Example of an Alarm Annunciator that would be used in a variety of different plants Annunciator panels were relatively costly to install in a plant because they had dedicated wiring to the alarm initiating devices in the process plant. Since incandescent lamps were used, a lamp test button was always provided to allow early detection of failed lamps. Modern electronic distributed control systems usually require less wiring since the process signals can be monitored within the control system, and the engraved windows are replaced by alphanumeric displays on a computer monitor. B√©la G. Lipt√°k (ed), Instrument engineers' handbook: Process software and digital networks, Volume 3, CRC Press, 2002 , page 289 Behavior of alarm systems, and colors used to indicate alarms, are standardized. Standards such as ISA 18.1 or EN 60073 simplify purchase of systems and training of operators by giving standard alarm sequences. =Obsolescence and revival= The introduction of computer monitor based control systems during the 1980s and 1990s saw a wholesale absorption of alarm window displays onto the computer screen. This created a downturn in the sales of the conventional Alarm Annunciator systems, and many of the companies manufacturing these alarm annunciator products were either sold off or went out of business. This has left today a major obsolescence support problem for customers who are still using these Alarm Annunciator systems as part of their safety systems. Over the last five years the Alarm Annunciator has seen a resurgence in popularity especially for use in IEC 61508 SIL 1 and SHE (Safety Health and Environmental) alarm monitoring applications. The modern trend is to identify critical alarms and return them from the computer screen to discrete alarm windows. This is being done for two reasons. Firstly, alarm annunciators offer pattern recognition to the operators in the form of LED alarm fascias instead of just providing an exhaustive list of alarms and events which the operators have to scroll through and in some instances alarms can be overlooked. Secondly, the analysis of plant failure modes is leading to the separation of critical alarm monitoring and process control systems for safety reasons. =Discrete annunciators vs SCADA alarm systems= SCADA systems were formerly considered the preferred alternative to discrete annunciators. A software-based solution, with almost endless ability to analyze, present and process alarms, has the potential for replacing discrete alarms switches altogether. However, software carries its own reliability risks. Reliance on a software program to trigger an alarm assumes that the analog signal, the programmer's logic code and HMI, the PLC or PC running the programs, and the interaction between all of the above, are all entirely trustworthy. This is exacerbated by frequently changing computer hardware & firmware platforms and the need to modify existing software. Alternatively new annunciator panels are utilizing long lasting and bright LEDs that significantly reduce the cost and maintenance of the panels. These new versions of the traditional system are still preferred over computer based systems especially in critical plants like nuclear power generation, oil and gas. In addition to the above, the latest annunciator designs now feature clever electronics to give them very high immunity to noise, and can therefore reduce the amount of false alarms due to noise. Fire alarm panel In large buildings, a central fire alarm annunciator panel is located where it is accessible to fire-fighting crews. The annunciator panel will indicate the zone and approximate physical location of the source of a fire alarm in the building. The annunciator will also include lamps and audible warning devices to indicate failures of alarm circuits. In a large building such as an office tower or hotel, the fire annunciator may also be associated with a control panel for building ventilation systems, and may also include emergency communication systems for the building.

Twelve of his fourteen albums contain them; his self-titled debut and Even Worse omit them. The medleys are composed of various popular songs, each one reinterpreted as a polka (generally an instrumentation of accordion, banjo, tuba, clarinet, and muted brass interspersed with sound effects) with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect and profane lyrics are covered with cartoon sound effects. Yankovic has been known to say that converting these songs to polka was \\"...the way God intended.\\" Yankovic said that the medleys were something he did \\"even before I had a record deal\\" in live performances, and that many of the songs are included due to not receiving a full parody version - \\"if there‚Äôs a song that I think is really ripe for parody but I just can‚Äôt think of a clever enough idea, sometimes it‚Äôll end up in the polka medley.\\" Regarding their popularity, Yankovic has said, \\"At this point, it's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley. Fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley.\\" Yankovic has always asked permission from every artist whose songs compose a medley due to royalties issues. He acknowledged some influence of Spike Jones in the medleys, such as the sound effects. Three of Yankovic's polka medleys\\"Hooked on Polkas\\", \\"Polka Power!\\", and \\"The Hamilton Polka\\"have been released as singles (either in international markets or domestically). \\"Polka Your Eyes Out\\" and \\"Polkas on 45\\" were also the only polkas to appear on a greatest hits album and \\"Polka Face\\" is the only polka to have an official video released for it. \\"Polkas on 45\\" \\"Polkas on 45\\" is Yankovic's first polka medley.

He played hurling with his local club James Stephens and the Kilkenny senior inter-county team in the 1970s, and between 1977 and 1978 represented Ireland at rugby union.  Early life  Ned Byrne was born in Kilkenny in 1948. He was educated locally at Kilkenny CBS where he first became interested in the game of hurling. Byrne later attended the Cistercian College in Roscrea where he continued hurling but also started playing rugby union. This was at a time when Gaelic Athletic Association members were not allowed to play non-Gaelic games and Byrne was duly banned from being a member of the college hurling team in fifth year. In his final year at school Byrne left the college rugby team and played hurling instead.  Hurling career  = Club = Byrne played his club hurling and football with his local St. Canice's club. He won county minor titles in both codes in 1964, however, the club disbanded shortly after and Byrne joined the famous James Stephens club. Here he won a senior county title in 1969. Byrne captured a second county medal in 1975, however, he later left the team to concentrate on his rugby career. In doing this he missed out on the greatest day in James Stephens‚Äô history as the club defeated the mighty Blackrock in the All-Ireland club final in 1976. In the early 1990s Byrne returned to James Stephens as trainer of the club‚Äôs senior hurling team. = Inter-county = Byrne first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the unsuccessful Kilkenny minor hurling team in 1964. He later joined the senior team, however, it would be 1971 before he became a regular on the team, making his debut in the National Hurling League. That year Byrne won a Leinster title, however, Kilkenny were later beaten by Tipperary in a thrilling All- Ireland final. The following year he captured a second Leinster medal before later lining out in his second All-Ireland final. Arch-rivals Cork provided the opposition and, for a while, it looked as if the Leesiders were cruising to victory. Kilkenny fought back to win the game and Byrne collected an All- Ireland medal.  Rugby career  Byrne had played rugby union since his secondary school days. He later played with the Kilkenny and Wanderers in the 1960s. Immediately following the 1972 All-Ireland hurling final victory Byrne joined Blackrock College and he soon started to make the Leinster team for representative matches. His talent was quickly noted and he later made his debut for Ireland in a 1977 Five Nations Championship game against Scotland. Byrne won five more caps in the front row but never finished on a winning team. In 1979 he was the first-choice tight-head prop in the Ireland team that went on a tour to Australia. That tour remains famous for Ollie Campbell taking over Tony Ward‚Äôs out-half spot, however, for Byrne it was memorable for quite a different reason. A group of players were coming back from a race meeting one night when, standing on a path waiting to cross the road, he was hit by a car which didn‚Äôt stop. His leg was broken in three places and he wasn‚Äôt able to play rugby again until early 1982. Byrne, however, recovered sufficiently to help Blackrock win the Leinster Senior Cup and Leinster Senior League in 1983.

Character history Professor Travers first appears in The Abominable Snowmen tracking Yeti in Tibet. His companion is killed and Travers flees his camp after seeing a creature standing over his friend's body. He seeks refuge in the Detsen Monastery where he meets the Doctor later whom he initially suspects of being responsible for his friend's death and takes to be a sabotaging journalist. After meeting the Doctor's companions Jamie and Victoria, Travers is convinced of the Doctor's innocence. Upon the discovery of killer, robotic Yeti, Travers fears for the real Yeti but is temporarily suspected of controlling the robotic Yeti himself. Travers assists the Doctor in defeating the Great Intelligence, the true controllers of the robotic Yeti. He pursues what he believes to be a real Yeti after glimpsing it as the Doctor and his companions depart. Professor Travers reappears in The Web of Fear. A robotic Yeti he brought back from Tibet is being exhibited in a museum in England. A Yeti control sphere that the Professor has reactivated is missing and he believes the Yeti now poses a threat. He summons his daughter, Anne, back from America and tries to persuade the museum owner, Julius Silverstein, to part with his exhibit. Silverstein refuses, even turning down the Professor's offer of money. However the sphere re-activates the Yeti. At his daughter's request, Professor Travers becomes attached to the military to aid them in solving the London crisis ‚Äì a mysterious, spreading web that is engulfing the city. Later, the Professor is reunited with Jamie and Victoria at the military's headquarters set up in the London Underground, but is puzzled as to why they have not aged significantly in the time between their meetings. Travers persuades the military to find the Doctor who has been separated from his companions. The Professor is captured by robotic Yeti and becomes a conduit for the voice of the Great Intelligence that takes control of his body. After using him to capture Victoria, the Great Intelligence surrenders its control of Professor Travers. He is reunited with the Doctor and once more assists him in defeating the Great Intelligence. In The Invasion, the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe seek out Professor Travers after landing in late twentieth-century London to help them fix the TARDIS's damaged visual stabiliser. However, Professor Travers has left for America, leaving his house in the care of Professor Watkins and his niece, Isobel Watkins. Behind the scenes Professor Travers actor Jack Watling is the real life father of his Doctor Who co-star Deborah Watling, who played Victoria. Professor Travers was originally to make a third appearance in The Invasion but was replaced by the character of Professor Watkins owing to Jack Watling's unavailability for filming and the limited screen time the character would have featured in that story.

It was designed to ease their transition from military into civilian life and to keep them under military control until they were fully adjusted to British life. It was mainly run by the British Army. The PRC was disbanded after fulfilling its purpose in 1949. Background The Polish Armed Forces in the West had fought alongside the Western Allies (primarily the United Kingdom) since 1939. However, in the aftermath of the \\"Western betrayal\\" - the decisions reached at the Yalta conference and subsequent agreements between the Big Three - the Polish government in exile found itself no longer recognised by the allies; instead the Soviet puppet government, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, assumed control of Poland. With the communist government mounting persecutions against the Polish resistance and the soldiers who fought \\"in the West\\", mostly loyal to the government-in-exile and opposed to communism, many Polish soldiers found themselves torn between returning to their homeland and facing persecution or remaining in the west. Many expected a collapse of the communist regime in Poland, and the liberation of Poland via a Third World War between the Western Allies and the Soviets, but instead by 1949 a full-blown Stalinist regime was entrenched in Poland, and showed no signs of weakening. Out of approximately 250,000 Polish soldiers in the West in 1945, 105,000 returned to Poland, but close to 160,000 were still in Western (mostly British) territory. The corps The formation of the corps was announced by Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin on 22 May 1946 and it began recruiting in September 1946. About 160,000 people were eligible to join, the majority of them (110,000) veterans of the Middle East campaigns, many of whom were members of the Polish II Corps. Of these, 22,000 were former prisoners of war. These figures also included 4,000 members of the Polish Navy, 12,000 members of the Polish Air Force, and 1,000 Polish members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF). The corps had a separate Air Wing for the air force personnel, run by the Royal Air Force. Eventually 115,000 Polish personnel would join the PRC programmes. The corps had its headquarters in Witley and was commanded by Brigadier William Bain Thomas and the Polish major-general Stanislaw Kopanski. Members of the corps were volunteers. Polish personnel were able to leave the forces and leave the United Kingdom or take up employment within the United Kingdom without joining the corps. They signed up for two years, but could leave the corps at any time, becoming members of the Corps Reserve until their two years were completed. During this time they could, however, be recalled to the corps if it was deemed necessary (e.g. if they were found to be unsuitable for the job they had taken). Members of the corps were still military personnel and subject to British military discipline and military law. They were accommodated in military camps and paid at the normal British Armed Forces rate for their rank. They were given tuition in English and either given training in trades or employed in useful projects, often on loan to private contractors, which it was hoped would increase their chances of getting a job in civilian life. A sizeable number underwent professional training, including at university level. If possible their dependents were also brought over to the United Kingdom. Due to the high number of Poles in the PRC, they were seen as significant competition by some British labour leaders. A campaign by the Trades Union Congress and leading trade unions attempted at first to turn public opinion against the Poles, but was eventually unsuccessful. By 1949 the corps had mostly ceased to function. About 150,000 Polish soldiers and their dependents settled in the United Kingdom, forming a significant part of the Polish community.

Background Following the dismissal of producer Jean Doumanian during the show's sixth season, Dick Ebersol, the program's developer, was hired as Doumanian's replacement. In March 1981, Dick Ebersol dismissed several of her cast members (repertory players Gilbert Gottfried, Ann Risley and Charles Rocket and featured players Yvonne Hudson, Matthew Laurance and Patrick Weathers). After one episode on April 11, 1981, the show was shut down for the rest of the season because of the 1981 Writers Guild of America strike. In the break, Dick Ebersol would also dismiss repertory players Denny Dillon and Gail Matthius, and featured players Laurie Metcalf and Emily Prager were not asked back as cast members. The new cast of Saturday Night Live for season7 included most of the repertory players from the final Dick Ebersol- produced episode of season6: Robin Duke, Tim Kazurinsky and Tony Rosato along with the sole surviving cast members from Jean Doumanian's era, Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo. Adding two new cast members Mary Gross and Christine Ebersole. Brian Doyle-Murray, who had been a writer for season 6, joined Dick Ebersol's new cast as a featured player (he was also a featured player during season 5). Michael O'Donoghue, who Dick Ebersol brought back to the show in March, remained as head writer for the first half of season7. Some sketches, as well as the appearances of artists like Fear and William S. Burroughs, reflected the increasingly bizarre ideas O'Donoghue had for the show. However, after developing a tense relationship with Ebersol and berating the cast in a meeting following the December 12 episode, O'Donoghue was fired, with Bob Tischler taking the role of head writer.Hill and Weingrad, p. 453-7. A new logo was introduced for this season, and was used until season 10: It consisted of the words SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE in the form of a square, with each word after it increasing in size; a modernized version of this logo was used from 2006-2014. Format changes Wanting to distance the show from its first five seasons, Ebersol cut the popular opening line Live from New York, It's Saturday Night! from the cold openings. In fact, sometimes cold openings were not even shown and the monologues were skipped over almost entirely. These changes were not permanent, as Ebersol decided to reverse them for the eighth season. Each episode began with the announcement \\"And now from New York, the most dangerous city in America, it's Saturday Night Live!\\" After the opening credits, the cast would enter together and pose with the show's host before running to their places for the first sketch. Ebersol also revamped Weekend Update. The segment went through its first name change (aside from the temporary change to \\"Saturday Night Newsline\\" in the final Doumanian episode from March 1981) and became \\"SNL Newsbreak\\". At the newsdesk was featured player Brian Doyle-Murray with Christine Ebersole and Mary Gross alternating as co-anchor. Brian Doyle-Murray also became the first Weekend Update anchor to be a featured player while serving as anchor. The only other anchors to do this were Michael Che, Tina Fey and Colin Jost. Additionally, this was the first season without Don Pardo (season 40 would become the next due to Don Pardo's death in 2014) as the show announcer. Instead the voice-overs were done by Mel Brandt, except for two episodes that aired in December 1981 when veteran NBC News announcer Bill Hanrahan handled such duties. Cast During the season, original cast member John Belushi died from an overdose of cocaine and heroin. The original airing of the episode hosted by Robert Urich had a tribute to Belushi. =Cast roster= Repertory players *Robin Duke *Christine Ebersole *Mary Gross *Tim Kazurinsky *Eddie Murphy *Joe Piscopo *Tony Rosato Featured players *Brian Doyle-Murray bold denotes Weekend Update anchor Writers This season's writers were Barry W.

The paper was called the Centinel of the Northwest Territory, and the first issue was published on Saturday, November 9, 1793. The motto of the paper was \\"Open to all parties-but influenced by none\\". He used a portable wood printing press, which he took with him to Lexington, Kentucky and set up a business. In 1793 he left for Cincinnati and began his weekly newspaper, which consisted of four pages and had a limited circulation. The printing press he used was much like the one invented by Johann Gutenberg. In 1796 he printed Laws of the Territory of the United States Northwest of the Ohio in Cincinnati, a two-hundred and twenty-five page book with one-thousand issues printed. Subsequently known as \\"Maxwell's Code\\", this was the first book printed in the Northwest Territory. Maxwell represented Hamilton County, Ohio at the first meeting of the Ohio General Assembly in Chillicothe in 1803, and there he was instrumental in the creation of Greene County, Ohio.

Oderin was originally settled by the French who considered it an important fishing post and had fortified it against the English. The name was originally Audierne, named after a town in France. In 1712, the French authorities in Placentia ordered all the buildings and fishing premises to be burned or destroyed, in part to deny to English the use of the site but also as retribution against the local French merchant Lafosse who had deserted to and collaborated with the English. This did not happen, however, as English Captain Tavener's second report indicates that Lafosse's abandoned wife was still present in May 1718 and running a prosperous operation. After the Treaty of Utrecht, the English established an outpost on the island and this became an important trade and fishing center. Shipbuilding was also an important industry on the island even though there were no local sources of wood. Wood was cut on the Mainland portion of the Burin Peninsula in places like Rushoon, Bay D'Leau and Baine Harbour and brought to Oderin. In 1802 the population had reached 235 comprising mostly English settlers. The Poole merchant firm of Spurriers had operations there but went bankrupt in 1830. By 1836 the population had dropped to 133. Spurriers' business was eventually taken over by Furlong Bros., Irish merchants from New Brunswick. During this time period to the middle of the 19th century the island saw an influx of Irish Roman Catholics. Many of the original English settlers moved to their wintering areas on the Burin Peninsula and established permanent year round communities. As a result, the Irish became a majority of the population. In 1853 the first Roman Catholic Church was established at Spoon Cove on the Island. James Furlong sold his business interests and moved to St. John's, where he became a Member of the Legislative Council but died shortly after moving there. Richard McGrath of Little Placentia who had been the Customs Officer in Lamanche Mines was elected Member of the Legislature for Placentia and St. Mary's in 1861 and appointed Justice of the Peace in 1865, relocated to Oderin. Oderin gained a Courthouse and became a point of entry of goods into the province. McGrath raised a large family there, many of whom went on to important positions in the government and clergy. Two sons, James and Richard went on to represent the district in the House of Assembly. The post office was established in 1864. The first Waymaster in 1856 was James Murphy. The first Postmistress was Mary Maddocks in 1891. In 1875 Fr. Michael Morris of St. John's arrived and built a brand new church and school in the centre of the community. His brother Edward Morris taught at the school and later became Prime Minister of Newfoundland. Oderins importance as a commercial center waned at the end of the 19th century and the community gradually declined in the 20th century. In 1898 it had a population of 395 and this had declined to 223 in 1956. It was abandoned under the Smallwood Governments controversial Resettlement Program in 1966. Residents relocated to nearby communities of Baine Harbour, Rushoon and Marystown. Today the island has no permanent population but still has many cabins that are used as summer vacation getaways by former residents.

It is usually open on Sunday afternoons from May to October inclusive, plus Wednesday afternoons during August as well as May Bank Holiday. History This gauge railway originated in 1946 when John Samuel started construction in the garden of his house, 'Greywood', on the Burwood Park estate at Walton-on-Thames. With the help of a group of volunteers the Greywood Central Railway developed into one of the foremost of its type in the country until by 1962 a run of 3/4 mile was possible. From the first the line was properly signalled and ultimately worked to a timetable. Samuel's death in October 1962 threw the railway's future into doubt but the publisher, Ian Allan, purchased the line and, with the assistance of most of the GCR volunteers, a few of whom are still involved, moved it to its present site at Hardwick Lane, Chertsey. It reopened to the public on 14 September 1968 under the new name Great Cockcrow Railway, taken from Cockcrow Hill which rises on its south side. Since that time the railway has been developed and enlarged, some two miles of track now being in the layout. Two different routes are offered to visitors, each of about 1.25 miles, a journey time of around twenty minutes.'Red Route' trains terminate at the country station, Cockcrow Hill, while 'Green Route' trains pass through that station to traverse a 350m-long loop beyond it. Return routes vary also. The most recent innovation is a proper station building, completed in 2014 after several planning, financial and constructional delays. As expected it houses a Tea Room and toilets, including disabled facilities, as well as the booking office and staff accommodation. The railway is open to the public on Sundays from the beginning of May to the end of October between 1.00pm and 4.30 pm, (booking office closes 4.00pm.) as well as Wednesdays in August. A Gala Day with visiting engines is held in September, and on the last Saturday in October Halloween is celebrated with night-time operation. Stations * Hardwick Central - the main terminus of the railway, where trains begin and finish their journeys. The railways sheds and station facilities are situated here, including Hardwick signal box, the ticket office and cafe. * Everglades Junction - the main hub of the railway, from here Everglades signal box controls movements from Hardwick Central and Cockcrow Hill, routing trains as required. * Jungle Halt - watch out for the residents of Jungle Halt, this is accessed by Red Route trains climbing The Spur. * Green Lane - the railways furthest point, and where Green Route trains begin their journey back to Hardwick Central. * Cockcrow Hill - originally the end of the line for \\"Branch\\" trains, this terminus was bypassed by the Millennium Line in the year 2000 and now trains have two different routes available to them. Red route trains still terminate at Cockcrow Hill where passengers can see the loco run round its train. Green Route trains bypass the terminus and circumnavigate the Millennium Line to send them back to Hardwick Central via Everglades Junction. Signalling A view of the interior of Everglades Junction Signalbox showing the Lever frame Prototypical working with full track circuiting and accurate signalling remains the key to the railway's operation. The two termini are controlled by semaphores while the whole of the main line is equipped with colour-lights, 10 of these being automatic. The boxes at Hardwick Central and Everglades Junction are fitted with Westinghouse 'L' type frames with, respectively, twenty-three and thirty-one miniature levers. The former was once part of the 227-lever installation at Crewe South junction while the latter is the complete frame from South Croydon Junction. The country terminus, Cockcrow Hill, has a 16-lever full-size 'knee' frame manufactured by the Railway Signal Company, probably around 1930. It came from the Waterloo terminus of the Waterloo & City line. Exactly as in full-size practice trains are offered and accepted between signal boxes by the use of Block instruments. Hardwick is configured as a Midland box, Everglades is configured as a Southern box. Because of the complication of the area it controls, and there may be as many as six trains on the track diagram at once, Everglades Junction box is also equipped with a train describer to assist the signalmen, usually two on duty together, in keeping track of movements. The train describer is also of great use in logging locomotive activity over the course of a season, and calculating average route miles. The signalling system is all-electric, including the interlocking, semaphores being worked by solenoids sealed for outdoor use. All signals are weighted to return to 'danger' when the train has passed into the next track-circuit section. Points have a mechanism powered by the very reliable Ford Escort windscreen wiper motor that moves the blades and then locks and detects them, no detection means no signal! The few sprung points in the facing direction are also electrically detected with micro- switches to ensure closure after a train has passed through in the trailing direction. Locomotives There are presently 41 steam engines and 12 instant start locomotives in the stud, all owned by the railway or individual members of the operating team. Seven or eight can usually be seen on operating days, with several other types resting, or under construction by members. Most of the steam locomotives are based on British mainline prototypes built to 1/8 scale. All four pre-Nationalisation companies are represented and locos from both pre-Grouping and BR 'Standard' eras are present, as well as some freelance types. The oldest, a North Eastern Railway class 'R1' (LNER D19) 4-4-0 was built in 1913 and is still in working order. The smallest is a Midge 0-4-0T while the largest are the 4-6-2 'Pacifics',the oldest being a freelance version built by Louis Shaw in 1927 and given the name 'Eureka' by Sir John Samuel in 1947 as he had found, in his opinion, the ideal engine for his railway. Other Pacifics represent prototypes from the LMS, LNER and Southern companies, as well as British Railways. Engines of 2-6-0 and 4-6-0 wheel arrangement feature as do 'Atlantics' from both the GNR and LBSCR alongside 0-8-0, 2-8-0 and 2-10-0 goods engines. A comprehensive list follows. Trains Rolling stock consists of 28 4-seater 'sit-in' carriages plus 4 further coaches that are articulated into twins. All passenger carriages and locomotives are fitted with vacuum brakes. Trains hauled by the smaller engines are generally made up of three carriages to accommodate 12 passengers; the more powerful locos can haul four carriages, carrying up to 16 passengers. The all-up weight of a 3-car train - without the engine - is estimated on average to be about 1 tons or 1270 kg. A varied collection of freight and engineering stock may also be seen.

He became known simply as Sam Stept or Sam H. Stept ‚Äì he rarely used his full middle name. Family Born in Odessa, Ukraine, Stept came to the United States at the age of three and grew up in Pittsburgh. Sam was the son of Solomon (1874‚Äì1969,) and Clara Stept (born 1872), who were married around 1895, in Russia. Sam Stept married Jessie E. Stept (n√©e McBride, c. 1901‚Äì1967). Jessie was the daughter of George B. McBride and Ada F. McBride of Pittsburgh. Career Early in his music career, Stept worked for a local publishing house as staff pianist (song-plugger), then in vaudeville as accompanist to performers that included Anna Chandler, Mae West, and Jack Norworth. During the early 1920s, Stept lived in Cleveland, OH, where he led a dance band. Within the next few years, he began composing with lyricist Bud Green. Their first hit came in 1928 with vocalist Helen Kane's rendition of \\"That's My Weakness Now,\\" and the duo would collaborate on tunes through the early '30s. Stept worked with many other lyricists through his career, including Sidney Mitchell and Ned Washington (while songwriting for Hollywood from the mid-1930s to mid-'40s), Lew Brown, Charles Tobias, and Eddie DeLange. Some of his popular tunes for the big screen are \\"Laughing Irish Eyes\\" for the 1936 film of the same name, \\"Sweet Hearts\\" for Hit Parade of 1937 and for the 1942 movie Private Buckaroo, \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\" and \\"Johnny Get Your Gun.\\" Stept's output slowed down in the late 1940s, and by the late 1950s, he was concentrating fully on his music-publishing business. Songs written by Stept have been recorded by many other big names in pop and jazz, including, Sarah Vaughan, Glenn Miller, Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong, as well as by Henry \\"Red\\" Allen, Bunny Berigan, Count Basie, Fletcher Henderson, and Josephine Baker.

College career Norman played high school football at Lynwood High School in Lynwood, California and attended Stanford University, where he was Stanford's starting quarterback from 1958 to 1960. Norman's tenure came at a low point in Stanford football history: the 1959 team went 3‚Äì7 and the 1960 squad was 0‚Äì10. In spite of the team's overall record, however, Norman put up incredible passing numbers in 1959, leading the nation with 1,963 yards and 2,018 yards of total offense, more than 300 yards ahead of the closest contender, and winning the first-ever Sammy Baugh Trophy, awarded to the nation's top passer. In a losing effort in the 1959 Big Game against Cal, Norman threw for 401 yards, then an NCAA record, and still a Big Game record. Norman's 1960 season was less impressive, but he still threw for more than 1,000 yards. Norman starred in the 1961 Senior Bowl, throwing for 311 yards and leading a late touchdown drive to put the North team on top before the South's Norm Snead led his own last-minute drive to win the game. Norman was nonetheless named the game's MVP and his 311 passing yards remains the fourth- highest in Senior Bowl history. Norman was inducted into the Stanford Athletic Hall of Fame in 2017. NFL career Norman was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the fourth round of the 1961 NFL Draft and by the Oakland Raiders in the fifth round of the 1961 AFL Draft. Norman opted to play with the NFL Bears, but saw action in just three games. He remained with the Bears through the 1962 season, and then was traded to the San Francisco 49ers for the 1963 season.

A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, he represents District 21B, which includes portions of Dodge, Goodhue, Wabasha and Winona counties in the southeastern part of the state. Early life, education, and career Drazkowski was born in Winona, Minnesota, and grew up on a farm in Bluff Siding, Wisconsin. He graduated from Cochrane-Fountain City High School and earned a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture in 1989 from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. In 1994, he earned a Master of Education degree from the University of Minnesota. Drazkowski is a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Firearms Safety Instructor, Wabasha County 4-H volunteer, and past president of the Minnesota Forage and Grassland Council. Political career In 2006, Drazkowski ran unsuccessfully for the District 28 seat in the Minnesota Senate. He subsequently ran for and was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in the August 7, 2007 special election held after Rep. Steve Sviggum resigned to become Minnesota's Commissioner of Labor and Industry. He was re-elected in 2008, 2010, and 2012. In May 2010, Drazokowski introduced legislation in the Minnesota House modeled after Arizona's controversial immigration law.Hoppin, Jason. Potent reaction to Minnesota immigration bill. St. Paul Pioneer Press. May 7, 2010.

It was created by Charles Edward Borden in 1952 at the University of British Columbia. How it Works AaBb-11:1234 A is the Major South-North Locator - Each block represents 2 degrees of Latitude from south to north (A - U) a is the Minor South-North Locator - Each block represents 10 minutes of Latitude from south to north (a - l) B is the Major East-West Locator - Each block represents 4 degrees of Longitude from east to west (A - W) (north of 62 degrees each major block represents 8 degrees of longitude) b is the Minor East-West Locator - Each block represents 10 minutes of Longitude from east to west (a - x) (north of 62 degrees each minor block represents 20 minutes of longitude) Therefore, a full designation: AaBb-16 represents a roughly 16 km x 16 km area and the 16th site found within that area. Since the number that follows is the number of the site within an area, assigned when the site is discovered, the whole number really only narrows the area to approximately a 16 km square. But it allows archaeologists to designate a site and to label every artefact from the site. The number after the colon is the artefact number: e.g., AaBb-16:0123 Because the distance between lines of longitude get smaller with increasing latitude, the Borden System changes at 64 degrees north latitude, from a width of 4 degrees of longitude to a width of 8 degrees in order to keep the area within each designate roughly the same.

Those four synods withdrew from that body and, together with the Georgia Synod, formed the General Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Confederate States of America at a meeting in Concord, North Carolina. In 1866, after the defeat of the Confederacy, the name of the synod was changed to the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod in North America. The Mississippi Synod became a member in 1876. That same year the organization's name was again changed, this time to the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod South. Overtures had been made to the Evangelical Lutheran Tennessee Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Holston Synod at various times, but those two synods had declined membership because they viewed the General Synod as not strictly following the Lutheran Confessions. Those concerns were eventually addressed, and in 1886 the Tennessee and Holston synods met in Roanoke, Virginia with the six synods of the General Synod South to create the United Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the South. In 1918 the United Synod of the South merged with the General Synod and General Council to form the United Lutheran Church in America (ULCA). In 1962, the ULCA became part of the new Lutheran Church in America (LCA). On January 1, 1988, the LCA ceased to exist when it, along with the American Lutheran Church and the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, joined together to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), today the largest Lutheran church body in the United States.

As publisher the Oregon Statesman newspaper, he moved the paper to Salem when the territorial capital moved to that city. A Massachusetts native, Bush became the first official printer for the state of Oregon, and his estate is now a city park. Early life Asahel Bush was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, on June 4, 1824.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. His parents, Asahel Bush, Sr. and Sally Noble Bush, were of English descent. The younger Asahel attended public school and later Westfield Academy, then at the age of 17 moved to Saratoga Springs, New York where he became an apprentice printer. Bush later worked for a newspaper before studying law. He passed the bar in 1850 in Massachusetts, but soon left for the Oregon Territory by the steamship Panama, taking the Isthmus of Panama route. Oregon Bush arrived in Oregon in late 1850 at Portland and settled in Oregon City. Once his printing press arrived, he started the Oregon Statesman newspaper in March 1851. In 1853, the capital was moved to Salem and Bush moved the newspaper there as well, where it would later become the Salem Statesman Journal. At this time newspapers were partisan instruments used to further political parties. Bush's use of his paper gave him the nickname of \\"Bushy Bush\\" and he often sparred with the rival party's newspaper The Oregonian edited by Thomas J. Dryer. Though he defended slavery, he supported the Union during the American Civil War. In 1859, Bush became the first official printer for the state of Oregon. He left the newspaper business in 1863 when he sold the newspaper. In 1867, Bush along with William S. Ladd founded the Ladd and Bush Bank in Salem. Ten years later Bush would buy out Ladd and become the sole proprietor of the financial institution. He remained active in politics and was a member of the state Democratic Party's central committee, including time as the chairperson, and in 1892 was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

Career =Early years= Raised in Stoneyburn, Glidden played for several different juvenile sides as a forward before moving to a half-back role upon joining junior side Whitburn. He earned selection for the Scottish junior international team in that role and eventually the chance to sign for a professional League side. =Hearts= He signed provisionally for Hearts in 1946 but spent two years farmed out to local junior side Newtongrange Star, where he played alongside future Hearts teammate Willie Bauld. After returning to Hearts in 1948 and playing several seasons of reserve-team football, Glidden made his debut in November 1951 against Queen of the South. Although he played as a right-back on that occasion, it was as right-half that he gained a regular role in the first team later that season. In 1954 Hearts' Bobby Dougan sustained the second serious injury of his career and required a cartlidge operation. After covering for Dougan during his enforced lengthy absence, Glidden took over the position on a permanent basis. He was part of the side that ended Hearts 48-year trophy drought by winning the 1954-55 League Cup and captained the team to Scottish Cup victory in 1955-56, a moment he recalls as the \\"sweetest\\" in his footballing career. Glidden completed his set of domestic medals as Hearts won the League title for the first time since 1897 in the 1957-58 season but a recurring back injury during the following season limited his appearances and eventually led to his departure from Tynecastle. =Dumbarton= He joined Dumbarton in 1959 and played three seasons for the Second Division club before retiring in 1962.

Activities for enVISIONing Annapolis ran from 2007 through 2008. The organization backing the process, the EnVISIONing Annapolis Foundation, was formed solely for this purpose. Important contributors and co-sponsors include the University of Maryland, Annapolis Charter 300, and St. Johns College. The primary organizers of the project included MS&R; Architects (Garth Rockcastle and Troy Urman), Miriam Gusevich, and Glenn Smith. Conversations for Change Lecture Series The EnVISIONing Annapolis project began with a series of free, public lectures held in Annapolis from September 2007 through June 2008. The speakers included leading experts in the fields of urban planning, urban design, public transportation, immigration, and historic preservation. Organized by the EnVISIONing Annapolis Foundation, MS&R; and Miriam Gusevich, these lectures were intended to stimulate civic dialogue among residents and outsiders regarding the urban sprawl and development issues facing the 21st-century American city. All lectures were held at the Maryland Hall Center for Creative Arts, with one exception held at The Boys and Girls Club of Annapolis. Speakers included: Notable author and international consultant Charles Landry; Jason Sartori from the National Center for Smart Growth; Architect/educator William Morrish, and; Preservation author and thinker Howard Mansfield. Each lecturer addressed topics of their specialty - all relevant to Annapolis' situation today. The purpose of these lectures was not to propose solutions, per se, but rather to instigate a local conversation on potential solutions from the ground up, supported by Annapolitans. Urban Design Charrette A major component of EnVISIONing Annapolis was the urban design charrette held in March 2008. During this period of intense collaborative work, four university teams - one each from the University of Maryland, Catholic University of America, Virginia Tech, and Morgan State University - converged on the city to study, brainstorm, and create. Each team conceived and presented compelling plans, narratives, and images of the city in the year 2060 - envisioning the future of Annapolis. Directing and facilitating the charrette teams were Garth Rockcastle, Principal, and Troy Urman, Intern, of architectural firm Meyer, Scherer, and Rockcastle, Ltd. The firm is noted for its many institutional projects, as well as the award-winning Washburn \\"A\\" Mill or Mill City Museum and headquarters for Urban Outfitters at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia. Also integral to the planning team was Miriam Gusevich. The products of this working session were re-presented at an open public session hosted by the Institute for the Future at Anne Arundel Community College on April 19th, 2008. The projects were illustrated with renderings, 3d models, diagrams, and policy or building proposals and feedback received by attendant surveys and discussion. A final report is posted on the IF @ ACC website for public view Post-Charrette Workshop and Report A group of Loeb Fellows (alumni of Harvard University's one year Loeb program) led by Miriam Gusevich and Glenn Smith came to Annapolis in June 2008. They held a workshop session to discuss and remark upon the work of the charrette and offer suggestions for next steps Annapolitans might take in moving this effort forward. Some local groups are continuing in pursuing some of the concepts proposed during this design effort, via feasibility studies and community activism.

The character first appeared in U.S.A. Comics No. 1 (August 1941), published by Marvel predecessor Timely Comics during the 1930s to 1940s period historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comics. As credits were not routinely given in comic books of this period, his writer and artist co- creators are unknown, although the first page of his debut story was drawn by Charles Nicholas (itself a house pen name) and the remainder by Basil Wolverton.Grand Comics Database: USA Comics #1 Publication history Rockman appeared in USA Comics #1‚Äì4 (Aug. 1941 ‚Äì May 1942), with two stories drawn by Basil Wolverton and at least one signed by writer and future Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Stan Lee. Marvel announced in July 2007 that Rockman would appear in the 2008 limited series The Twelve.Comics Book Resources (July 26, 2007): \\"Mystery Men's Dozen: Brevoort Talks The Twelve\\"Newsarama (Aug. 16, 2007): \\"12 Days of the Twelve: Rockman The first three 1940s Rockman stories were reprinted in The Twelve No. 0 (Feb. 2008) and #1/2 (Nov. 2008). Fictional character biography In his historical origin, Rockman was the leader of an underground race of beings who were the descendants of the first white colonists of North America. Their kingdom was known as Abyssmia, and was located underneath the country. Noticing the effects of war overhead, Rockman leaves Abyssmia to assist the United States in its war effort. He has super- strength and speed, has a super-tough body, and doesn't need oxygen to breathe. =The Twelve= Some time after his official introduction as a superhero, Rockman joins Captain America, the Invaders and a cadre of second- tier superheroes in the Battle of Berlin. There he is ambushed and captured along with Blue Blade, The Black Widow (unrelated to the modern character of that name), Captain Wonder, Dynamic Man, Fiery Mask, Laughing Mask, the original Master Mind Excello, Mister E, Phantom Reporter, the Witness and the telepathically controlled robot Electro. As Electro is deactivated and unable to help the other heroes, they are doused with sleeping gas and placed in cryogenic stasis by Nazi scientists, who hope to dissect them and discover the secret of their superhuman abilities. Rockman, along with the others, is \\"lost\\" when the scientists are killed during the fall of Berlin. Years later in 2008, the heroes are found. He and his teammates are brought to live in a luxurious mansion, while adjusting to modern life; a task in which he fails miserably. Still pining for his lost kingdom, Rockman never moves from the basement, futilely slamming his hands on the ground in an attempt to contact any Abyssmians. It is strongly hinted that Rockman's historical origin has simply been a delusional fantasy when Danielle Rose, a young girl from West Virginia, tells the military caretakers of Rockman that the hero may be her lost great-uncle Daniel Rose. Apparently, Rose was a miner who lived in Tarleton, West Virginia, and became well known for being the first miner to advocate unionizing. Rose lived there with his wife and daughter (whom he referred to as his \\"little princess\\"), until Boss Clete, the corrupt head of the Lufton Fuel Company, hired some thugs to silence the growing trade union. Rose accepted the fight, and brought his trade union down into the mine to confront Clete's men. At the last moment, Boss Clete attempted to flee, while exploding behind himself a hidden dynamite charge that was intended to seal off the mine and kill Daniel Rose and his men. However, Boss Clete forgot to take in account the eventual methane chain reactions. As a result, the mine collapsed around the men, killing everyone except for Rose. Exposure to hidden pockets of an \\"unknown mutagenic gas\\" gave him extended reserves of strength and durability, along with making him impervious to harm. When Rose returned to the surface, after two days of constant digging, he discovered that the resulting sinkhole had swallowed the whole Tarleton, killing everyone he held dear, included his beloved wife and his \\"little princess\\". Daniel Rose snapped, and in his stupor was left pounding the ground, calling his lost family to him. Exhausted and utterly unbalanced, Rose abandoned his town only to resurface later as \\"Rockman, King of Abyssmia\\", which may have been a psychological coping mechanism to deal with the shattered figments of his former life. Danielle presents proof of her findings, and shows the caretakers a photograph of Daniel Rose. However, they lie to Danielle and send her away, acknowledging that the hope of being reunited with his lost family is the only thing holding Rockman's remaining shreds of sanity together. Rockman's story ends ambiguously. He is caught in a collapsing building, and apparently hears his \\"princess\\" coming to get him. When his team-mates excavate, in an attempt to retrieve his body, they instead find a tunnel that goes for a mile into the earth.The Twelve trade paperback Powers and abilities Besides having access to advanced Abyssmian technology, including a \\"digger car\\" for transport and advanced monitoring equipment, Rockman has the powers of superspeed, super toughness, super strength, and super hand-to-hand combat skills. He does not need air and can withstand the extreme pressures of the bottom of the sea. After his revival in The Twelve he has not demonstrated his super-speed powers, and his physical prowess, nigh-invulnerability and durability are explained as the exposure to a still unknown underground gas. As Rockman is revealed to be a citizen of the U.S.A. named Daniel Rose, his Abyssmian technology is now retconned, or explained as enhanced digging instruments, as Daniel Rose was a professional miner. His mental state, precarious after the tragic loss of his family, continues to erode as he is brought into modern times. Rockman is in a state of constant mourning, waiting for his dead loved ones to return. Footnotes References *Rockman at Nevins, Jess, A Guide to Golden Age Marvel Characters.

In 2000, he made his debut as a poet with the collection \\"Maaaraamat\\".Maaaraamat (Kaaruka k√ºla, 2000, English; Countrybook : The Curved Village)- Retrieved 2019-02-02, . From 2001 to 2007 he worked as the editor of Arkaadia, a cultural addendum of Eesti P√§evaleht. Wimberg's (Urmet's) novel \\"Lipam√§e\\" (which was noted on 2002 Estonian novel contest and awarded Virumaa prize of literature in 2002) is a postmodernist story of a young man who moves from urban area to countryside after the death of his grandfather. The novel shows a blend of realism and phantasy: autobiographic reflections on the last decade of the Soviet era in countryside alternate with magic present (e.g. one of the characters is the devil). The events take place in a real location - the village of Kaaruka in J√§rvamaa. Wimberg's collections of poetry (\\"Maaaraamat\\" and \\"K√§rppsed\\") depict autobiographic thoughts. In his works, Wimberg uses (his own) innovative orthography of Estonian language.

The tower is located on the east side of Greenwich Street, on the eastern side of the World Trade Center site. The current 3 World Trade Center is the second building at the site to bear this name. The original building was the Marriott World Trade Center, a hotel located in the southwest corner of the World Trade Center complex. The hotel was a 22-story steel-framed structure with 825 rooms. It had a roof height of . Construction began in 1979 and it opened in July 1981 as the Vista International Hotel. The entire World Trade Center complex was destroyed during the September 11 attacks in 2001. Construction originally began in 2010, but was delayed until 2014 because of a lack of an anchor tenant. The building's concrete core was topped out to maximum height in August 2016, with the perimeter steel structure following on October 6, 2016. The building opened on June 11, 2018. The building was designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, and is managed by Silverstein Properties through a ground lease with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the landowner. It is high, with 80 stories. , it is the sixth-tallest building in the city. __TOC__ Previous building (1979‚Äì2001) The Marriott World Trade Center was a 22-story steel-framed hotel building with 825 rooms. It had a roof height of 73.7 m (242 ft) and was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Its structural engineer was Leslie E. Robertson Associates with Tishman Construction serving as the main contractor. Construction began in 1979. It opened on July 1, 1981 as the Vista International Hotel and was located at the southwest corner of the World Trade Center. It was heavily damaged in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and was subsequently closed until repairs were completed the following year. Forty people died when the hotel was destroyed during the September 11 attacks. The hotel's remains were later dismantled to make way for construction of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum. New building =Background= 3 World Trade Center was originally planned for a podium of seven stories for trading floors, with a 73-floor office tower rising from it. The diamond braces initially planned for the front and rear faces of the building have been dropped from the design and the tower is to be built without them. However, the diagonal bracing on the sides would remain. The four spires in the original design gave the tower a pinnacle height of 1,240 feet (378 m), meaning it would have become the third-tallest building in New York City by pinnacle height, but the spires were later removed from the design, thus reducing the height by about 88 feet (approximately 26.8 m). The total floor space of the building is planned to include of office and retail space. The building's groundbreaking took place in January 2008, and at that time it was scheduled to be completed by 2014. Unusual for a high-rise, the building's concrete core would be built before the rest of the structure was completed. The structural engineer for the building was WSP.\\"Ground Zero Office Designs Hailed as Hopeful Symbols\\" Engineering News-Record, September 18, 2006, pg. 12 Pritzker Prize-winning architect Richard Rogers, of Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, was awarded the contract to design the building. On May 11, 2009, it was announced that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was seeking to reduce 175 Greenwich Street to a \\"stump\\" building of approximately four stories. The overall plan, which also called for a similar reduction in height for 2 World Trade Center and the indefinite postponement of 5 World Trade Center, would halve the amount of office space available in the fully reconstructed World Trade Center to . The agency cited the recession and disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein as reasons for the proposed reduction. Silverstein opposed the plan, filing a notice of dispute on July 7, 2009. By doing so, the development firm began a two-week period during which renegotiated settlements and a binding arbitration regarding the construction of the four World Trade Center towers could be made. Silverstein Properties, which has paid the Port Authority over in financing, noted the organization's inability to meet construction obligations in its official complaint. In November 2010, three PureCell fuel cells were delivered at the World Trade Center site which together will provide about 30% of the tower's power. =Delays= Preliminary site plans for the World Trade Center rebuild. By the beginning of 2012, Silverstein Properties and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reached an agreement to only build 3 World Trade Center to seven stories, unless tenants can be found to fund the building. According to a March 2010 agreement between Silverstein Properties and the Port Authority, Silverstein Properties must find tenants to lease 400,000 square feet of the building and it must raise in private financing in order to receive additional funding. If Silverstein Properties meets those triggers, then the Port Authority, City of New York, and New York State will provide an additional towards the tower's completion. Silverstein Properties also needs to provide financing for the remaining cost of the tower before it can be completed. The existing foundation of the tower was built entirely with insurance proceeds, and until Silverstein Properties meets the requirements. The agreement also implemented a \\"cash trap\\" to make sure that public investments are paid off before Silverstein Properties makes any profits from the tower. The tower portion of 3 World Trade Center was to be fully built after meeting the requirements. A spokesperson speaking on the issue of rebuilding the site commented: \\"Three WTC should be up by 2015; although; we do have one milestone to hit: We need to get a 400,000-square-foot tenant in order to get a financing backstop that makes sure we will complete that building. So, that's a question mark, and it's a major priority of Silverstein Properties\\". The Port Authority believes that the 2010 agreement will allow market demand to drive the construction of the towers and help to limit public investment since the Port Authority has other projects that need attention in the region. By February 2012, the ground floor concrete was almost done and the lower podium had reached the 5th floor. On May 18, 2012 a construction update was released which stated that the superstructure work was continuing, and that forms, rebar, and concrete placement work was also continuing. Additionally, utilities for the site were being installed. The construction agency expected the lower podium to reach a capped height of 7 stories by September 2012. In late June 2012, David Zalesne, president of Owen Steel, confirmed that construction of the tower would continue and that Owen Steel has been selected to provide the structural steel for the building. On October 2, 2012, the large advertising and media company GroupM was confirmed by several sources to be in the preliminary negotiations to anchor 3 World Trade Center in a deal that would allow construction to begin on the planned 80-story office tower. The lease would be about 550,000 square feet in size, a large enough commitment to qualify the project for up to $600 million in public benefits in the form of a mix of equity and loan guarantees from the city, the state, and the Port Authority. In December 2013, GroupM was signed on as anchor tenant. This allowed the tower to resume construction in late 2013. In January 2014, Senator Chuck Schumer negotiated a $340 million round of financing through federal Recovery Zone bonds to finance the project's construction. A subsidy, which would have doubled the loan given to the construction of 3 World Trade Center, was postponed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in April 2014 until June 2014. =Resumption of construction= On June 25, 2014, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reached an agreement with Larry Silverstein to finance the completion of 3 World Trade Center, and construction of the tower resumed. The financing included the sale of $1.6 billion of tax-exempt bonds, the largest-ever unrated bond deal in the municipal bond market. Other sources of funding included $600 million in insurance proceeds, $210 million in cash contributions from the New York City and State governments, and $55 million in cash from Silverstein Properties itself. Following the financing, the tower crane returned and a new anticipated completion of late 2017 was announced. In 2015, the design was modified and the height reduced by , from to its current height of . , 3 World Trade Center's core had risen to the 19th floor and steel to the 14th floor. On June 28, 2015, one more tower crane was built on the site. Another crane arrived in July, bringing the total to four cranes. On May 20, 2016, the tower's concrete core reached the symbolic height of , thus officially reaching supertall status and exceeding the roof height of neighboring 4 World Trade Center. On June 23, 2016, 3 World Trade Center's core was topped out. In a ceremony held at the base of the building, a 2-ton bucket of concrete was signed by workers, and executives, including developer Larry Silverstein, and was hoisted up with an American flag, which was also used with the topping out of 7 and 4 World Trade Center, to the top of the tower. On the evening of August 11, 2016, a construction crane struck one of 3 World Trade Center's windows. There was a heavy wind gust at the time, and construction workers were securing the crane when it veered into a 12th-story glass panel, cracking it. No one was injured. On October 6, 2016, the last steel beam was lifted and installed on top. The glass facade was completed in August 2017, at which point several retailers had signed leases for the atrium retail space. GroupM, an advertising company, had also signed a lease for some of office space in the tower. The building officially opened on June 11, 2018, with the buildings tenants so far being GroupM, McKinsey & Company, Tradenda Capital, and IEX. =Gallery= File:WTC 3-May 2012.jpgConstruction of Three World Trade Center as of May 2012.

She then made two short deliveries to Cuba before making her first transatlantic crossing in July, delivering men, mail, and stores in Algeria, North Africa. Between further Caribbean trips, Merak voyaged to both Sicily and Scotland before the end of 1943. She continued Caribbean sailings and transatlantic voyages until February 1945, including four crossings from Bayonne, New Jersey, to Italian ports. After a brief drydocking she supplied ships and bases from Iceland to Trinidad. On her last voyage to Reykjav√≠k, on 14 July 1946 a blizzard blew her ashore while anchored at Argentia, Newfoundland. She was freed by tugs and completed her voyage. She then made two more trips to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Trinidad before being released by the Navy. On 21 June 1946 Merak was decommissioned at New York and returned to United Fruit, which reinstated her pre-war name Veragua. =Military awards and honors= Merak‚Äôs crew were awarded the following medals: * American Campaign Medal * Europe-Africa-Middle East Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal Post-war civilian service In 1958 United Fruit transferred Veragua and her sisters Quirigua and to its British subsidiary Elders and Fyffes, which changed Veraguas name to SS Sinaloa.

History He was first introduced in Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz as a mysterious figure who educates Jack Pumpkinhead on the use of the Pirate Sack. Although a detailed description is included in the text, Jack Pumpkinhead of Oz includes no illustrations of the Red Jinn aside from a gruesome color plate that did not appear outside the first edition, in which he has massive piercings. He was reintroduced, drawn, and given the name Jinnicky in The Purple Prince of Oz; he also appeared in the follow-up, The Silver Princess in Oz. He makes a cameo appearance in The Wishing Horse of Oz, and he is the principal pre- existing character in Thompson's sub-canonical penultimate Oz book, Yankee in Oz. Jack Snow apparently thought the Red Jinn was a separate character, for he considered The Purple Prince of Oz Jinnicky's first appearance in Who's Who in Oz, though he did not include a separate Red Jinn entry. Jinnicky's body is housed inside a large red ginger jar, complete with lid. He speaks in a deep voice. Neill's art originally depicted him with massive piercings, but these were later omitted and are not referred to in the text. His disposition is generally jolly and friendly, and in spite of what modern readers may consider serious character faults, he is popular and well-liked and treated very sympathetically by his author. His preferred mode of transportation is a flying jinrikisha pulled only by magic. He lives in a red glass palace in the northeastThompson placed it in northwestern Ev, but she was using a reversed map. Baum was also self-contradictory on which side of Oz Ev was on. of the Land of Ev, attended by his Advizier, Alibabble, and Addie the Adding Adder. In addition to these, Jinnicky has a large number of slaves. This was apparently intended to be a joke on Thompson's part. Thompson was wont to derive material from the Arabian Nights, in which jinns are usually slaves, such as in Aladdin's lamp, so she played a simple turnaround and made the Jinn the slaveholder. All of the slaves that are described are explicitly black people. The best known of the slaves is Ginger, whose service to a magic dinner bell is an important literary device. He also makes smaller appearances in The Wishing Horse of Oz and Yankee in Oz (in which Jinnicky is instrumental in freeing Ozma and the other residents of the Emerald City palace from the giant Badmannah). Because all of his appearances except The Silver Princess in Oz are protected under U.S. copyright, he does not figure in books by post- Thompson authors, with the notable exception of Lin Carter, whose estate was able to pay to use the character in his novel, The Tired Tailor of Oz (published posthumously in 2001). Thompson refers to Jinnicky as \\"The Wizard of Ev\\" in The Silver Princess in Oz and Yankee in Oz.

Mariko was the first professional wrestler in Japan to die as a result of injuries suffered in a wrestling match. Career During her career, Mariko received many ring injuries which eventually resulted in a brain abscess. She had previously suffered several concussions, but continued to wrestle. On August 15, 1997 she teamed with Command Bolshoi against Mayumi Ozaki and Rieko Amano at the Hiroshima Sun Plaza, Hiroshima. At the matches conclusion, Ozaki used one of her regular moves, the Ligerbomb, to pin Mariko. The move was executed just as usual, but appeared to have triggered a pre-existing problem. Since other wrestlers on the card had sold their finishes that night, the fans in the arena didn't immediately realize there was a problem. It seems that this spot may not have been the planned finish of the match. In any case, Mariko was knocked out from the Ligerbomb and didn't kick out. After the match, Ozaki and the other wrestlers saw Mariko, who still hadn't budged, snoring, which was a sign that her brain was bleeding. Mariko died a few hours later on August 16, 1997. No postmortem was performed on her at the request of her father. Despite this, Mariko was said to have had head injuries and an abscess on her brain which may have contributed to the head trauma that killed her. An annual memorial show was held in her honor from 1997 to 1998. Both JWP and Mayumi Ozaki's Oz Academy have held annual memorial shows since. Mariko was posthumously inducted into the All Japan Women's Hall of Fame on November 29, 1998.

He was inextricably linked to Dateline NBC's To Catch a Predator, a TV series that conducted sting operations against suspected sexual predators who target children online. Local law enforcement conducted a sting operation that identified Conradt as a suspect attempting to solicit sex from a person he believed was a 13-year-old boy, and Dateline cameras recorded the events that followed. Conradt shot and killed himself upon encountering SWAT team members that were serving an arrest warrant at his home for his attempt to solicit a minor in sexual acts.  Personal life and career  Louis Conradt was born January 30, 1950, in Terrell, Texas. Conradt graduated from the University of Texas at Austin and received his J.D. degree at Texas Tech University School of Law. He was the Kaufman County, Texas, district attorney for more than two decades before giving up his seat to make a failed run in 2002 to be the 86th State District Judge, losing to Republican Howard Tygrett. Afterward, he became Rockwall County's chief felony assistant district attorney. Conradt lived in Terrell, about an hour southeast of Murphy, where Perverted-Justice, working in conjunction with Dateline, had set up shop to conduct its predator stings. Records show that Conradt was single and lived alone.Profile, dallasnews.com; accessed July 16, 2015. .  Interactions with Perverted-Justice  According to Perverted-Justice's logs, Conradt, posing as a 19-year-old university student, engaged in sexually charged online chats with a person using the alias of a fictional 13-year-old named Luke. Conradt solicited pictures of \\"Luke's\\" penis and sent him photos purporting to be of himself. After two weeks of these exchanges Perverted- Justice and NBC brought in an actor to play Luke over the phone. For unknown reasons, Conradt stopped responding to phone calls and instant messages. It was then that police decided to bring the operation to Conradt's home in Terrell. =Conradt's MySpace page= According to Perverted-Justice members, content from Conradt's MySpace page began to disappear, leading them to believe that Conradt was covering up his tracks. This played a part in the decision of the authorities to pursue a warrant for Conradt's arrest. Chris Hansen mentioned the disappearing page on his blog and on air.Louis Conradt profile , insidedateline.msnbc.msn.com; February 20, 2007; accessed July 16, 2015. Esquire writer Luke Dittrich implies that the disappearing page pushed the participants to make an imminent move as, under Texas law, individuals may be charged with committing a crime if they participate in sexually explicit chats with persons identifying themselves as children. Later investigation by Esquire revealed that Conradt's page had not been touched for months before the sting. Perverted-Justice members claimed that Conradt had other MySpace pages but never produced the evidence to prove the allegation. Hansen later admitted to Esquire that he did not remember actually seeing the page.Esquire Magazine \\"Interview with Chris Hansen: The Transcript\\" - Part two of a three- part report on the Conradt incident, esquire.com; accessed July 16, 2015. = Sting = The official participants in the sting included Murphy police and the Terrell Police Department, including Terrell's SWAT team. According to raw footage obtained by Esquire, at least one Dateline cameraman had hidden himself near the Conradt residence door. Chris Hansen and Dateline denied that crew members were on the private property. Also in that footage is Frag, a member of Perverted-Justice, who is seen advising police on what to do next. Chris Hansen denied that Perverted-Justice was present but recanted when Esquire was able to describe what Frag looked like. The warrants were signed shortly after 2 p.m. By this time, police and Dateline had been on the scene for hours. In fact, Dateline had shown up as long as five hours earlier, and later records showed that neighbors had phoned in suspicious persons reports. According to the Esquire account (again, contested by Dateline) Dateline crewmembers notified police that they observed that a Sunday newspaper on Conradt's doorstep had disappeared, indicating that Conradt was actually home. Later, in an interview with Esquire, Hansen would claim that he did not remember the incident, nor would he characterize anything Dateline did as surveillance for the police. Using the tip given to them by Dateline, the police made a decision to call in a SWAT team and perform a tactical entry. They feared that Conradt was aware of their presence and was now destroying evidence. The police broke the door's lock and swept through the house. They encountered Conradt in a hallway. According to the officers' account, Conradt said a variation of \\"I'm not going to hurt anyone\\". He then shot himself with a Browning .380 handgun. = Events and reaction = In most cases, To Catch a Predator lured suspected sex offenders with an actor or actress pretending to be a child, into a home that was wired with cameras and surrounded by police. Conradt's death increased criticism of the already controversial show significantly, being criticized by some in the legal and journalistic profession. A year after the incident, Rolling Stone and Esquire published articles denouncing To Catch a Predator. Esquire obtained raw footage of the incident that contradicted Dateline's and host Chris Hansen's previous denials of the show's collusion with law enforcement officials. Hansen did not respond when The Houston Chronicle asked for comment about the Esquire article but deferred to his spokeswoman, who called the idea that Hansen would dictate police action \\"preposterous\\". Perverted-Justice founder Xavier von Erck called the Esquire article fiction. He did not respond to the Esquire story's allegation or supporting evidence that Dateline and Perverted-Justice directed police actions in the Conradt case; rather, he reiterated his disgust for Conradt's behavior. In an email response to The Houston Chronicle, he wrote: > The idea that anything led to the suicide of Conradt other than his want to > avoid potential penalties for soliciting a 13-year-old boy sexually is > outlandish. We encourage all interested to read the Conradt chat-logs and > verification call recordings.

He was either known to have killed or admitted to the killings of at least eight other people, including a fellow inmate and at least seven contract killings. The crimes Anderson had been incarcerated for one count of aggravated burglary in 1971 and three counts of aggravated burglary in 1973. While incarcerated at Utah State Prison, Anderson murdered an inmate, assaulted another inmate, and assaulted a correctional officer. Anderson admitted to six other contract killings in Las Vegas, Nevada that happened prior to the crime for which he received a death sentence. On November 24, 1979, he escaped from prison, after which he worked for narcotics traffickers and committed at least one contract killing in the eastern mountains of Salt Lake County, Utah. On May 26, 1980, Anderson, then 26, burglarized the Bloomington, California house of 81-year- old Elizabeth Lyman, a retired piano teacher. In the middle of the night, Anderson cut Lyman's telephone line with a knife, and broke into her home by removing a glass pane from her French doors. He checked the house for occupants room by room. When he entered Lyman's bedroom, she awoke and screamed. Anderson shot her in the face from close range with a .45 caliber handgun, fatally wounding her. He covered her body with a blanket, recovered the expelled casing from the hollow-point bullet that killed her, and ransacked her house for money. He found less than $100. Anderson then prepared himself a meal in Lyman's kitchen. A suspicious next door neighbor called the sheriff's department. As he was eating and watching television, sheriff's deputies responded to the call and arrested him. He admitted to the murder. Trial and execution On July 24, 1981, a San Bernardino County jury sentenced Anderson to death. His last meal before the execution was two grilled cheese sandwiches with radishes, one pint of cottage cheese, a hominy/corn mixture, one slice of peach pie, and one pint of chocolate chip ice cream. On January 29, 2002, Anderson was executed by lethal injection at San Quentin State Prison. He was pronounced dead at 12:30 am Pacific Time.

It is the southern third of the Ports-to-Plains Alliance. The reason for proposed improvements to this corridor is to expedite the transportation of goods and services from Mexico in the United States and vice versa. The Ports-To-Plains Corridor starts in South Texas and traverses through Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and ends in Denver, Colorado. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 made the Ports-to-Plains Corridor National Highway System High Priority Corridor 38 in 1998. The High Priority designation, which applies to 90 routes or groups of routes nationally, does not create any additional design requirements and does not have a separate federal funding source. Route description The thumb The Ports-to-Plains Corridor starts at the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border at a bridge crossing in Laredo, Texas, where it meets and runs concurrent with I-35, a six-lane freeway. North of Laredo, the route follows US 83, a two-lane highway to Carrizo Springs, Texas, where the route follows US 277 through Eagle Pass, Del Rio, Sonora, and San Angelo, Texas. North of San Angelo, the route follows US 87, a four-lane highway, through Big Spring and Lamesa and finally to Lubbock. Additionally, the corridor connects to Midland using State Highway Route 158 between Sterling City and Midland and State Highway Route 349 between Midland and Lamesa. North of Lubbock, the route follows I-27 to Amarillo. North of Amarillo, the route is again marked as US 87 and returns to four-lane highway. At Dumas, a spur of the route extends northwest to Raton, New Mexico on mostly four-lane US 87. The route continues north from Dumas using US 287. At the Oklahoma/Texas border, the route continues along US 287. It passes through Boise City, Oklahoma in the western panhandle. Continuing north, the route follows US 287 through Springfield, Lamar, and Kit Carson, Colorado. North of Kit Carson, the route follows US 40 to Limon, Colorado, where it joins I-70 for the final leg into Denver, Colorado, where the highway ends at an interchange with I-25/US 6/US 85/US 87. The cities of Laredo, Eagle Pass, and Del Rio are each located on the U.S./Mexico Border and are gateways to trade between the two countries. Future In 2015, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) published the Initial Assessment Report: Extension of I-27/Ports-to-Plains Corridorftp://ftp.txdot.gov/pub/txdot-info/lbb/projects/ports-plains/initial- assessment-report.pdfTexas Department of Transportation, Initial Assessment Report: Extension of I-27/Ports-to-Plains Corridor. The purpose of this document is to provide a high-level overview of 1) existing conditions; 2) potential upgrade options; 3) a summary of public outreach and reaction; and, 4) potential next steps for TxDOT to consider toward further planning, public outreach and corridor development. Assessment results included: ‚ÄúOverwhelmingly, stakeholders expressed the urgency in TxDOT engaging in a new update of prior corridor studies, focusing on an extension of I-27, rather than upgrading incrementally the I-27/P2P corridor.‚Äù Further, the Assessment stated: ‚ÄúInvestments have been made within the corridor to improve safety and mobility; however, there are still sections that need to be addressed.‚Äù It found: ‚ÄúSome areas along the corridor have seen notable population growth and growth in the number of passenger cars and especially trucks and are projected to continue to grow. This translates to more demands on the transportation system.‚Äù In 2018 TxDOT completed the Texas Freight Mobility Planhttps://www.dot.state.tx.us/move-texas-freight/studies/freight- plan.htmTexas Department of Transportation, Texas Freight Mobility Plan. The stated purpose is: ‚Äúprovides the state with a blueprint for facilitating continued economic growth through a comprehensive, multimodal strategy for addressing freight transportation needs and moving goods efficiently and safely throughout the state. The Plan identified priority strategic projects and initiatives based on current and future freight volumes, trends and economic opportunities. The I-27 Extension ‚Äì from Lubbock to Laredo was identified as one of two Strategic Projects. The Plan stated that I-27 would be a catalyst to spur economic development in this part of the state and support agricultural and energy sector development, the state‚Äôs economic engine, and that the I-27 extension would provide the only major north-south corridor in Texas west of I-35, and it would intersect three major east-west routes: I-10, I-20 and I-40. It also recommended that TxDOT complete a more detailed study of the extension to determine whether an incremental improvement approach or a complete interstate facility approach would meet safety and mobility needs. In June 2019, Governor Greg Abbott signed Texas House Bill 1079https://www.txdot.gov/inside- txdot/projects/studies/statewide/ports-plains.htmlTexas Department of Transportation, Ports-to-Plains Feasibility Study (House Bill 1079) which directs TxDOT to conduct a comprehensive study of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor. The study must evaluate the feasibility of, and the costs and logistical matters associated with, improvements that create a four-lane divided highway which meets interstate highway standards to the extent possible. This study would detail improvements to extend Interstate 27 both north and south which includes the Ports-to-Plains Corridor north of Amarillo to the Texas-Oklahoma border, to the Texas-New Mexico border, and south of Lubbock to Laredo. Next, TxDOT establishes an Interstate 27 Advisory Committee which is composed of the county judge, an elected county official, or the administrator of the county‚Äôs road department, as designated by the county judge, of each county along the Ports-to-Plains Corridor along with the mayor, city manager, or assistant city manager, as designated by the mayor of Amarillo, Big Spring, Carrizo Springs, Dalhart, Del Rio, Dumas, Eagle Pass, Eldorado, Lamesa, Laredo, Lubbock, Midland, Odessa, San Angelo, Sonora, Sterling City, Stratford, and Tahoka. The advisory committee would meet at least twice each year on a rotational basis in Lubbock and San Angelo. Additionally, TxDOT, in conjunction with the Advisory Committee, establishes committees for each geographic segment along the Ports-to-Plains Corridor as determined by TxDOT. The Segment Committees consist of volunteers who represent municipalities, counties, metropolitan planning organizations, ports, chambers of commerce, and economic development organizations including the oil and gas industry, the trucking industry, TxDOT representatives, and any other interested parties. Each Segment Committee will submit a report by June 30, 2020 to the Advisory Committee providing input for the study conducted by TxDOT including priority recommendations for improvement and expansion of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor. TxDOT will also host quarterly public meetings on a rotational basis in Amarillo, Laredo, Lubbock, and San Angelo to gather public feedback on improvements or expansions to the Ports- to-Plains Corridor. Not later than January 1, 2021, TxDOT will submit a report on the results of the study to the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the house of representatives, and presiding officer of each standing committee of the legislature with jurisdiction over transportation matters. HB 1079 was patterned after a similar effort with Interstate 69 which was designated in 1998 as a Future Interstate in the TEA-21 reauthorization legislation. The Interstate 69 study was then completed in 2014.

One of the rocket's second stage engines failed to ignite, which caused the launch to be aborted and the spacecraft to separate by means of its SAS launch escape system. The descent module came down downrange. Its landing motors fired prematurely, resulting in a harder landing than expected, and the spacecraft was subsequently dragged by its parachute. It was subsequently collected by a Mil Mi-4 helicopter.

The adventure is set in the game's World of Greyhawk campaign setting, specifically in and around Castle Greyhawk and its dungeons. As such, it is an update to the 1990 adventure module WGR1 - Greyhawk Ruins. The adventure also provides updates on a number of important Greyhawk personages as well as encounters in the Free City of Greyhawk itself.  Overview  The Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk adventure puts the adventuring party on a quest into the depths of the Ruins of Castle Greyhawk to save the Free City from the forces of the foul demigod Iuz the Evil - the half-fiend son of the demon lord Graz'zt and the evil archmage Iggwilv. Iuz built a sinister empire that once held the northern lands of the Flanaess in fear and constantly threatened the surrounding kingdoms in an attempt to rule the entire world of Oerth. Iuz's empire fell apart 200 years earlier after Iuz was captured by the Free City's founding wizard, the mad Zagig Yragerne, who imprisoned Iuz in a device called the \\"godtrap\\" as part of a bizarre experiment to achieve divinity for himself. Decades after Zagig (now the Archmage Demigod called Zagyg) achieved his godhood, a powerful mage from the Free City named Mordenkainen led an expedition into the depths of Castle Greyhawk. There, two of Mordenkainen's allies, the warrior Lord Robilar, and Boccobite cleric Riggby, found the imprisoned Iuz and through Mordenkainen's manipulation, released the half- demon believing they could just kill him outright once and for all. Iuz, however, managed to escape the battle and fled back to his kingdom where he could recover his power and plot his revenge against his enemies. Afterward, Robilar, along with the archmage Rary, betrayed Mordenkainen and the Circle of Eight (a committee of wizards), by killing the great wizards Tenser and Otiluke, and leaving Bigby clinging to life. Mordenkainen had expected Rary to betray him sooner or later, but not Robilar, who was his trusted ally for decades. Forty years later, in the Greyhawk realm's Common Year of 597, the player characters take on the role of adventurers who arrive at the Free City to explore the Ruins of Greyhawk looking for riches and glory. Under an oath with Zagig, Mordenkainen vowed never to enter the depths of Castle Greyhawk, but through researching Zagig's tomes, Mordenkainen only recently found a possible clue to Robliar's betrayal hidden deep inside the ruins. Mordenkainen, barred by oath from entering the dungeons, recruits the band of adventurers to go into the chambers for him and find the secret behind Robilar's treachery. Little do they realize they have stumbled upon an epic situation where failure could mean the destruction of the world. This late Greyhawk adventure was set late enough in the timeline to accommodate events from Living Greyhawk.  Contents  Unlike most published adventure modules, the Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk is technically an incomplete \\"open ended\\" adventure. Rather than detailing every single room of the dungeons below the ruins, only key areas that affect the main plot of the adventure are detailed. In fact, entire dungeon levels are left unmapped and the DM is encouraged to improvise their own encounters to fill in areas not covered by the game with their own content. The game provides a list of random encounters for each dungeon level, generic dungeon maps left clear of content, and numerous side quests to help the DM along the way and keep the adventure flowing. *Introduction - The Introduction reviews the background history leading up to this adventure and introduces the major NPCs such as the Mad Wizard Zagig, Iuz the Evil, and the Archmage Mordenkainen. *Chapter 1: Welcome to Greyhawk - This chapter contains the initial set up encounter that hooks the player characters into the adventure. The rest is a guide to the Free City of Greyhawk and contains numerous side quests the PCs can conduct while not directly exploring the dungeons below the ruins. There is a detailed overview map of the city here as well which is based on the original map published by TSR in 1989. *Chapter 2: Castle and Dungeon - This chapter contains more background history for the ruins and has a detailed overview map to all the dungeons below the ruins and the structures on the surface level. The adventure leaves many levels of the dungeon unmapped, creating gaps in the main storyline that the Dungeon Master can fill in with their own material. Provided in this chapter are a list of random encounters for each level, and four generic dungeon maps that the DM can place anywhere in the dungeon to fill in these gaps in the action. *Chapter 3: The Tower of War - This chapter details one of the three towers that make up the Ruins of Greyhawk and is the initial entry point to the dungeon as the characters will find access to the other towers barred until they uncover how to get into them. *Chapter 4: The City of Thieves - This chapter brings the party back to the city after their first major delve into the dungeons. Here they can wrap up any side quests they started in Chapter 1, as well as get involved in more predicaments as the plot of the story thickens. *Chapter 5: Wrath of Iuz - This chapter begins with the PCs the target of Iuz's forces who now know of the party's activities to stop their master's plans. The party must return to the dungeons via the Tower of Magic ‚Äì another tower of the ruins which was previously barred to them and uncover the secrets below. *Chapter 6: In Zagig's Shadow - This chapter contains the climactic showdown between the party of heroes and the forces of darkness that linger in the depths of the ruins including a surprise plot twist where the PCs end up facing a new enemy that could be worse than Iuz. *Appendix: Monsters and Mythology ‚Äì The appendix introduces two new monsters for D&D; 3.5 edition ‚Äì the aurumvorax (a badger-like magical beast whose pelt can be melted into pure gold. This beast originally appeared in the first edition module Expedition to the Barrier Peaks), and the Cataboligne Demon (an Abyssal creature that can appear as a beautiful maiden and lure victims closer with its captivating voice). This section also provides information on the demigods Iuz, Zagyg, and Zuoken, and a few new magic items such as the blade of chaos, and the bonewand. Publication history The 224-page adventure was published by Wizards of the Coast (WotC) in August 2007 for the 3.5 edition Dungeons & Dragons rules. The work was authored by Jason Bulmahn, James Jacobs, and Erik Mona and is the first significant WotC release of new Greyhawk material since 2002. Cover art was by Michael Komarck, with interior art by Miguel Coimbra, Thomas Denmark, Brian Hagan, Jon Hodgson, Fred Hooper, Warren Mahy, Franz Vohwinkel, Ben Wooten, and James Zhang. Shannon Appelcline notes that Greyhawk Ruins (1990) was remade into the 3E-compatible Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk, and while the book was published by Wizards, it was written by Paizo staffers such as Erik Mona and James Jacobs. Reception Tim Janson of mania.com comments: \\"Literally this is an adventure which, depending on how often you play, should take players many weeks if not months to complete. It‚Äôs big‚Ä¶it‚Äôs deep‚Ä¶and it's waiting‚Ä¶I really like this book although I‚Äôm partial to the whole Greyhawk mystique. I think the writers have tried to be faithful to Gygax‚Äôs creation while adding their own unique handprints.\\" (ellipses in original) Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk received the silver ENnie Award for Best Adventure. Shannon Appelcline called this book \\"a long-awaited return to the most famous dungeon in roleplaying\\", noting that it was published as part of a series of nostalgic adventures which suggested that Wizards of the Coast's original series of 3.5e books was coming to an end.

The eleven- year-old likewise was accepted as an apprentice and later went on to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he attended painting lessons with Heinrich F√ºger. He returned to work at the factory as one of the leading painters. From 1809 he worked only on portraits, specializing in miniature painting on ivory, and small gouaches on paper. In 1812 was employed as a portraitist by the Austrian Foreign Minister Klemens von Metternich and became curator of the extensive portrait collection of Metternich's third wife Princess Melanie. In 1819 he painted a portrait of Metternich's daughter, Klementine, posed as the goddess Hebe. He was influenced by Jean-Baptiste Isabey and even more strongly by the English portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, who visited Vienna in 1819. In his late years he concentrated on the painting of flowers. Daffinger died in 1849 during a cholera epidemic in Vienna and was buried in the St. Marx Cemetery. In 1912 his mortal remains were transferred to a grave of honor () in the Vienna Zentralfriedhof. Daffinger left more than a thousand portraits, many of which were owned by the Austrian imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

Contemporary Realism is an approach that uses straightforward representation but is different from photorealism in that it does not exaggerate and is non-ironic in nature. Biography Since 1978, he has focused on painting still lifes, landscapes, and figures that are influenced by Greco-Roman antiquity. Chief among his stated influences are the aesthetic and philosophical theories of the Greek sculptor Polykleitos and the mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, as well as the work of the 17th-century classical painter Nicolas Poussin. A resident of Salinas, California, his paintings often depict the terrain of the central Californian coast in the background. \\"I think that I'm very Californian in the character of the light that I use, but I made a decision very early on in my project to try to be an invisible presence in my work. Personal expression and having a personal style are very important to many artists but I've been much more interested in how we see - what I call perceptual analysis - and the potential meanings of the objects that I've depicted.\\" - David Ligare Ligare was born in 1945 in Oak Park, Illinois.

Pre-independence The first Tanganyikan trade union, the Motor Drivers' Union, was founded in 1927. In 1937, Asian workers founded the Asiatic Labour Union, leading to the founding of numerous unions in the country. These early organizations were not, however, involved in many industrial conflicts, their primary activity being the organizing of mutual help among its members.Thomassin, Catherine: \\"Le mouvement syndical en Tanzanie\\". University of Laval. Retrieved August 16, 2007. The roots of the modern Tanzanian labor movement reach back to the 1940s. By 1947, five unions had been registered with the authorities. The colonial government reacted to the creation of unions in Tanzania by enacting laws which allowed it to keep tabs on the movement ‚Äì for example, the registration of unions become obligatory. Nonetheless, the labor movement grew, by 1956 there were 23 organizations with a total of nearly 13,000 members. In 1955, seventeen trade unions finally merged to create the Tanganyika Federation of Labour (TFL). Its original two main objectives were to gain more members and to absorb smaller unions. During the country's fight for independence, the TFL collaborated with the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), a party founded in 1954, in its fight for the nation's independence from the United Kingdom achieving this goal in 1961. Flag of the brief Sultanate of Zanzibar The first union in Zanzibar, where the Tanganyikan labor unions were not active, was the Seamen's Union, which was founded in 1955. There had been a strike by the island's dock workers in 1948, but no organized labor movement until 1955. A wave of union foundings followed that of the Seamen's Union, but these organizations did not have many members as Zanzibar was only scarcely populated and the socio-economic activities were few. In 1956, the Federation of Zanzibar and Pemba Trade Unions (ZPFL) was founded with assistance from Tanganyikan unionists. During the first half of the 1960s the Zanzibari labor movement flourished. During the 1964 revolution, the labor movement collaborated with peasants to overthrow the Sultan.Mbwana, Talib O.: \\"The History of Trade Union Movement in Zanzibar \\". Friedrich-Ebert- Stiftung. Retrieved August 17, 2007. NUTA, JUWATA, and OTTU Flag of Tanzania Although the joint efforts of the TANU and the TFL resulted in Tanzanian independence from the United Kingdom, trade unions presented what Edwin Babeiya has framed as \\"direct confrontation with the post independence TANU government over various issues such as Africanization and trade unions' autonomy.\\" In 1962, there were a total of 182,000 workers organized in the trade unions of the newly independent Tanganyika and 152 strikes involving 48,434 workers forcing the state to react. The 1964 NUTA Act disbanded the TFL and established the National Union of Tanganyika Workers (NUTA) as the sole trade union in the country. This was the end of all labor autonomy in the country as the union's main function was to propagate the government's policies and the leadership of the NUTA was appointed by the country's president. As mentioned above, the situation in the early 1960s in Zanzibar, which had merged with Tanganyika to form Tanzania in 1964, was similar. As in mainland Tanzania, the government banned the existing trade unions, namely the ZPFL, and instituted the Federation of Revolutionary Trade Unions (FRTU) as the new union federation of Zanzibar. The FRTU was heavily involved in the government's dealings including the preparation of the new constitution. But in 1966, the FRTU was no longer needed. Thus, the government dissolved it and the Department of Labour, directed by the ASP, took over labor affairs, but it was dissolved as well as soon as 1968. In 1977, the ruling parties of Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania, the TANU and the ASP merged to form Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM). Likewise, the TANU-affiliated union, the only labor organization in the country, was restructured. The Union of Tanzanian Workers or Jumuiya ya Wafanyakazi Tanzania (JUWATA) was thus founded in the following year. It continued the NUTA's tradition of complete loyalty to the ruling party, but covered all of Tanzania, including Zanzibar, although the government of the region was reluctant to allow unionist activity to resume on the island. Following an economic crisis in the early 1980s, growing pressure for trade union autonomy in conjunction with the country's transition to a multi-party system in 1990 led to the JUWATA's dissolution and the founding of the Organisation of Tanzania Trade Unions (OTTU) in 1992. The move was approved by the country's president and parliament. The main difference between the OTTU and the JUWATA was that the former consisted of sectoral unions and allowed the creation of eleven industrial unions. Moreover, the union's internal structure was more democratic than that of its predecessor. After the President broke a promise to raise salaries in the country in 1993, the OTTU conducted a successful strike from March 1 to 3 showing that the union was no longer controlled by the government. In January 1994, a strike by high school teachers led to massive government repression including the suspension of 318 teachers as well as to the creation of the Tanzania Teachers' Union. In 1995, the eleven national unions decided to form the Federation of Free Trade Unions (TFTU). Bruno Mpangala was its secretary general. The membership was approximately 348,000, but declined in the following years, mostly as a result of government staff reductions. Formally, the unions were still part of the OTTU and the TFTU did not have the power to negotiate with employers, this was done by the respective industrial unions. Trade Union Act In 1998, the Trade Union Act No. 10 made trade unions independent of the government. This move was mostly supported by the unions, although some aspects of it were criticized, especially the extent of the powers of the Registrar of Trade Unions. The act allows any twenty workers to found a trade union and any two unions to create a national center. The Registrar, which is responsible for administrating the provisions of the act may, however, cancel or refuse the registration of a union. The act does not apply to Zanzibar and Pemba. These islands have a similar law, which allows unions to be formed and registered with the Registrar of Trade Unions at Zanzibar. In general the restrictions on the labor movement on the island are much stricter than on the mainland. For example, workers are legally prohibited from striking.Tanzania: Annual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights (2006). ICFTU. Retrieved August 18, 2007. TUCTA and ZATUC Logo of the TUCTA In 2000, the Trade Union Congress of Tanzania (TUCTA) was founded as a new umbrella organization for the unions of the country. The main difference between it and its predecessor is that the TUCTA covers only mainland Tanzania, the Zanzibar Trade Union Congress being responsible for Zanzibar.

The Chinese on it mixes Simplifed Chinese and Traditional Chinese. The debate on traditional Chinese characters and simplified Chinese characters is an ongoing dispute concerning Chinese orthography among users of Chinese characters. It has stirred up heated responses from supporters of both sides in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and among overseas Chinese communities with its implications of political ideology and cultural identity.Keller, Andr√©e Tabouret. (1997). Vernacular Literacy: A Re-Evaluation. Oxford University Press. Simplified characters here exclusively refer to those characters simplified by the People's Republic of China (PRC), instead of the concept of character simplification as a whole. The effect of simplified characters on the language remains controversial, decades after their introduction. Problems The sheer difficulties posed by having two concurrent writing systems hinders communications between mainland China and other regions, although with exposure and experience a person educated in one system can quickly become familiar with the other system. For those who know both systems well, converting an entire document written using simplified characters to traditional characters, or vice versa, is a trivial but laborious task. Automated conversion, however, from simplified to traditional is not straightforward because there is not always a one-to-one mapping of a simplified character to a traditional character. One simplified character may equate to many traditional characters. As a result, a computer can be used for the bulk of the conversion but will still need final checking by a human. The writer Ba Jin, in his essay \\"Thoughts: Reform of Chinese characters\\" (), urged caution in any reforms to the written Chinese language. He cited the inability of those educated in Hong Kong or Taiwan to read material published on the mainland, and vice versa, as a great disadvantage of simplified Chinese. He also cited the ability to communicate, not just with Chinese peoples of various regions, but also with people from across the Chinese cultural sphere ‚Äî countries such as Japan, Korea, and Vietnam ‚Äî as a great advantage of the written Chinese language that should not be undermined by excessive simplification.Ba Jin. (1999) \\"ÈöèÊÉ≥ÂΩï¬∑Ê±âÂ≠óÊîπÈù©\\".„ÄäÊ±âÂ≠óÊñáÂåñ„Äã.Issue 4, 1999. Beijing. Culture =Simplified characters= Proponents say that the Chinese writing system has been changing for millennia: it passed through the Oracle Script, Bronzeware Script, Seal Script and Clerical Script stages. Moreover, the majority of simplified characters are drawn from conventional abbreviated forms that have been used in handwriting for centuries such as the use of Á§º instead of Á¶Æ, and some simplified characters are in fact restorations of ancient forms that had become more complicated over time. For instance, the character for \\"cloud\\" was originally ‰∫ë in early inscriptions, but the character was borrowed to write a homophonous word meaning \\"to say\\". To disambiguate the two uses of the character, the \\"rain\\" radical (Èõ®) was added on top when it meant \\"cloud\\", forming the current traditional character Èõ≤. The homophonous word meaning \\"to say\\", however, has become archaic in modern Chinese, though Èõ≤ continues to be used for \\"cloud\\". The simplified version simply restores ‰∫ë to its original use as \\"cloud\\". =Traditional characters= While some simplified characters were adopted from conventional abbreviated forms that have existed for a long time, those advocating the simplified forms often fail to point out that many such characters in fact had multiple vernacular forms out of which just one was chosen, arbitrarily, and then privileged by the designers of the simplified character scheme. Many of the changes can be seen as ideological, such as the removal of the \\"heart\\" (ÂøÉ) from the word \\"love\\" (ÊÑõ) into the new character (Áà±) without heart. To some, the new 'heartless' love character is an attack on Confucianism, which emphasizes the virtues of filial piety and humanity in relationships so as to maintain a harmonious society. Supporters of simplification argue that the removal of the heart radical occurred in the context of calligraphy in ancient times and was not viewed in an anti-Confucian light. A variant form without the heart radical appears in the Kangxi Dictionary under the head character ÊÑõ. Moreover, the simplified form Áà± is well-attested in the semi-cursive script calligraphy from imperial times, appearing in the work of Sui dynasty calligrapher Zhi Guo (Êô∫Êûú) and Emperor Taizong of Tang and has appeared in calligraphic works from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. Pro-traditional commentators argue that the changes through the history are almost exclusively alterations in writing styles, especially vernacular writing, and not in the fundamental structure of the characters‚Äîespecially after the Qin standardization. They have alleged that simplified characters were arbitrarily schematized and then imposed by the PRC on its people with the intention of subverting and eradicating selected elements of traditional Chinese culture, in order to carry out what the PRC viewed as necessary revolutionary modernization. These critics point out that many of the fundamental characteristics underlying Chinese characters, including radicals as well as etymological and phonetic elements, were deliberately omitted in their simplified form at least partly for this reason (i.e., disrupting continuity with traditional Chinese culture). One frequently-cited example is the character for \\"sage\\" or \\"holy\\", Âú£ in simplified and ËÅñ in traditional. The simplified character lacks the king radical (Áéã), replacing it with soil (Âúü). Supporters of simplification appeal to the fact that that Âú£ was often used, in handwriting, as a simplified variant of ËÅñ long before the PRC itself came into being. The Shuowen Jiezi (Ë™™ÊñáËß£Â≠ó) furthermore classifies ËÅñ as a x√≠ngshƒìng (ÂΩ¢ËÅ≤) character with phonetic component Âëà. Thus the origin of the character may have nothing to do with any cultural connection to kings or royalty. Even among supporters of simplification, some make the argument that Classical Chinese texts should not be printed in simplified Chinese because of the complexities involved in the use of t≈çngji«é (ÈÄöÂÅá) or phonetic loan characters. Ancient texts for instance might use the character Â•≥ (n«ö, \\"women\\") when the character Ê±ù (r«î, \\"thou\\") is intended semantically because of their similar pronunciation in Old Chinese. The interpretation of ancient texts in often complicated by the presence of these phonetic loans, for which several very different meanings could be read. Generally, the more ancient the text, the more numerous the phonetic loans, since separate characters were slowly introduced as the written language evolved, in order to disambiguate these loans. For instance, the preclassical Book of Odes and the early classical Analects always uses Â•≥ for Ê±ù, while texts from the Han dynasty or later nearly always use Ê±ù.Ironically, Ê±ù itself is also a phonetic loan, the original meaning being the name of a river. This meaning is, of course, rarely used, compared to the character's use as the second-person pronoun. The merging of several traditional characters into one simplified character (e.g., È°ò (yu√†n, \\"desire\\", commonly used) and ÊÑø (yu√†n, \\"honest\\", archaic and rare) to ÊÑø (both meanings) during the simplification process can be thought of as the modern introduction of phonetic loans. This complicates an already complex landscape of t≈çngji«é characters appearing in classical texts, introducing additional possibilities for misinterpretation, particularly for beginning students. Personal names of historical individuals are also problematic. For example, there are two Six Dynasties period generals whose names are ÁéãÊø¨ (206-286) and ÁéãÊµö (252-314), both of which are pronounced as W√°ng J√πn. However, according to the current PRC simplification scheme, the character Êø¨ is considered to be an obsolete variant of Êµö, so to conform to standard orthography, these names should be written identically using Êµö. Against this argument, proponents of simplified characters respond that simplified characters are more practical in all domains other than ancient literature and that it is uneconomical to introduce high school students, already burdened by schoolwork, to a new character set for the sole purpose of teaching the classical language. Any potentially confusing usages can be remedied by providing appropriate annotations and glosses in footnotes, which are needed anyway for student editions of classical texts. When the need arises, history and language majors in colleges and universities gradually learn to read scholarly editions of texts set in traditional characters without too much difficulty. Nevertheless, classical texts set in traditional Chinese can be hard to find in mainland Chinese bookstores. The Zhonghua Publishing House (Zh≈çnghu√° Sh≈´j√∫, ‰∏≠ËèØÊõ∏Â±Ä) and several other specialist scholastic publishers are the only ones to routinely publish works in traditional characters. Literacy =Arguments for simplified characters= *Proponents feel that simplified Chinese characters with fewer strokes make learning easier, and is evidenced by the rapid decline in illiteracy in mainland China.Gunde, Richard. (2002). Culture and Customs of China. Greenwood Press. *Although Taiwan and Hong Kong, which use traditional Chinese characters, have a higher literacy rate, proponents point out that with a population 50 times larger and landmass 260 times bigger, the illiteracy in mainland China is much more difficult to eradicate and should not be attributed to script usage. =Arguments for traditional characters= *The literacy rate of Taiwan and Hong Kong is higher than that of mainland China, compared for the same year. It is also argued that the fact that mainland China is much larger and more populous than Taiwan or Hong Kong does not excuse a lower rate of literacy, as by definition a literacy rate represents the proportion of literate people‚Äînot the sheer quantity of literate persons living in the country's territory. *There is also a false dichotomy in comparing the effect of simplified Chinese characters on an illiterate populace between two vastly different time periods. Early proponents of script reform during the period of Republican China such as Lu Xun and Lufei Kui have been mischaracterised to retrofit contemporary narratives in illiteracy reduction. This is because it was specifically functional illiteracy of adults which was rampant throughout this era, caused by a lack of systematic education, and was a major cause of concern at the time for the intelligentsia. Their now obsolete rationale also unambiguously involved the complete abandonment of the Chinese script and the full transition into an alphabetical script (such as Cyrillic or Hanyu Pinyin), which placed unprecedented emphasis on rapid modernisation and is largely unfounded in science or linguistics. *Even if it is possible to correlate the adoption of simplified Chinese characters with increases in literacy rates, given the consistently high literacy rates in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and not to mention the fact that correlation does not imply causation, such correlations do not prove that the simplification of characters alone is determinant of literacy success any more than the many other factors involved in cultural change and educational reform. The increase in the accessibility of education from the aforementioned factors is also a strong contender for the credit of increased literacy rates in mainland China. *Aside from correlational arguments the only other form of evidence offered in support of script reform success through character simplification is anecdotal. *The validity of statistics about literacy rates in mainland China is questionable. Furthermore, even assuming that the mainland statistics are valid, they still fail to match the overall consistently high rates of literacy in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Ambiguity =Clarity of simplified characters= *Proponents feel that some traditional characters are too similar in appearance, such as Êõ∏ (sh≈´) \\"book\\", Êôù (zh√≤u) \\"daytime\\" and Áï´/Áïµ (hu√†) \\"drawing\\": In contrast, the simplified forms which are ‰π¶, , and respectively are much more distinct. *Furthermore, the merging of characters in simplified chinese does not create confusion in vernacular usage. Classical Chinese mainly used one character for one word, which made it commonplace for one character to have multiple meanings and multiple pronunciations. E.g. \\"Â§©\\" means \\"sky\\" (Â§©ËãçËãç), \\"heaven\\" (Â§©Â∞ÜÈôçÂ§ß‰ªª), \\"nature\\" (ÊµëÁÑ∂Â§©Êàê), \\"weather\\" (ÂøÉÂøßÁÇ≠Ë¥±ÊÑøÂ§©ÂØí); \\"Èïø\\" means \\"length\\" (ch√°ng, Èïø‰∏ÄË∫´ÊúâÂçä), \\"specialty\\" (ch√°ng, ‰∏ÄÊäÄ‰πãÈïø), \\"grow\\" (zh«éng, ËçâÊú®ÈÅÇÈïø), \\"senior\\" (zh«éng, ‰ª•Âêõ‰∏∫ÈïøËÄÖ), etc. Context is vital to determining the meaning of a certain character in Classical Chinese. After the early 1900s' Vernacular Chinese movement, compound words were formed by multiple characters (usually two), and these words usually have only one meaning: \\"Â§©Á©∫\\" meaning \\"sky\\", \\"‰∏äÂ§©\\" meaning \\"heaven\\", \\"Â§©ÁÑ∂\\" meaning \\"nature\\", \\"Â§©Ê∞î\\" meaning \\"weather\\", \\"ÈïøÂ∫¶\\" meaning \\"length\\", \\"ÁîüÈïø\\" meaning \\"grow\\", etc. Context is not necessary to determine the meaning of a certain word. Thus, the act of merging characters which forms homophones, does not create confusion when using Vernacular Chinese. E.g. \\"Â§¥Âèë\\" (È†≠È´Æ, f√†) meaning \\"hair\\", \\"Âá∫Âèë\\" (Âá∫Áôº, fƒÅ) meaning \\"set off\\", \\"Ë∞∑Áâ©\\" (Á©ÄÁâ©, g«î) meaning \\"grain\\", \\"Â±±Ë∞∑\\" (g«î) meaning \\"valley\\". Hence, simplification reduces the number of characters one would need to learn for everyday life. =Clarity of traditional characters= *Opponents cite a similar argument where the simplification of once distinct characters have made them more difficult to discern apart. A common example is ÁÑ° (w√∫) for \\"none\\", simplified into , which appears very similar to the character Â§© (tiƒÅn) for \\"sky\\". Another example would be Ë®≠ (sh√®) for \\"designate\\", and Ê≤í (m√©i) for \\"without\\", which are quite hard to distinguish apart in their simplified forms ËÆæ and and can result in confusion in quick handwriting or calligraphic fonts. This type of confusion has happened before for the characters ËÆÄ (d√∫) for \\"read\\" and ÁÄÜ (d√∫) for \\"showing disrespect\\" which were confused for each other in their simplified forms ËØª and Ê∏é respectively. This disparity between leaving standalone characters unsimplified but taking the grass script form whenever applicable could lead to confusion with other similar looking components and contributes to the obscurity of its semantic value. *Similarly, some simplified characters create more confusion. In traditional Chinese, ÂçÉ (qiƒÅn) \\"thousand\\", and ‰πæ (gƒÅn) \\"dry\\" are very different characters. In simplified Chinese, they appear to be almost identical, being ÂçÉ and Âπ≤, respectively. *Simplified Chinese characters frequently include merged characters, which opponents view as baseless and arbitrary: Âæå (h√≤u, \\"behind\\") and Âêé (h√≤u, \\"queen\\") are both simplified into Âêé. Likewise, Èöª (zhƒ´, a measure word) and Âè™ (zh«ê, \\"only\\") are merged into Âè™; Áôº (fƒÅ, \\"happening\\") and È´Æ (f√†, \\"hair\\") are merged into Âèë; È∫µ (mi√†n, noodles/flour) and Èù¢ (mi√†n, face/side/surface) are merged into Èù¢; Á©Ä (g«î, \\"crop\\") and Ë∞∑ (g«î, \\"valley\\") are merged into Ë∞∑, and so on. *On 3 September 1993, the Board of Language Usage & Applications of China permitted and re-introduced the usage of the character ‚ÄòÈéî‚Äô and released a new policy of Resolution for the Complication in Using Character ‚ÄòÈéî‚Äô and Its Usage Re- introduction („ÄäÂÖ≥‰∫é\\"Èéî\\"Â≠ó‰ΩøÁî®ÈóÆÈ¢òÁöÑÊâπÂ§ç„Äã). The movement was an attempt in trying to resolve the controversy caused by the conflict between the lawful mergers of characters of ‚ÄòÈéî‚Äôand ‚ÄòÁÜî‚Äô and the name usage of former Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. According to earlier Chinese laws regarding Chinese Language Simplification, character ‚ÄòÈéî‚Äô should have always been written as ‚ÄòÁÜî‚Äô; however, Zhu Rongji insisted on writing ‚ÄòÈéî‚Äô when it came down to writing his name because he was originally named in the character ‚ÄòÈéî‚Äôbut not ‚ÄòÁÜî‚Äô. Thus, the Board later re- introduced the character. Proponents of traditional characters thus argue against the use of simplified chinese, especially when it comes down to mergers of characters in names of historical heroes, scholars, philosophers, and political figures. They also report trouble in flight reservations when traveling in and out of mainland China due to the mergers of characters. On top of all that has been previously mentioned, the left-side radical of Èéî (which is the left-side version of Èáë) is almost never seen in simplified characters, since it has largely been replaced by the simplified left-side radical seen in characters like Èì∂, Èìú, and Èí±. *Professor Wang, at Beijing University of Education, also the Vice President of Chinese Language Association, and an official of Ministry of Education of China, agreed and criticized that some characters were oversimplified during the simplification campaign, and thus became counterproductively more difficult to learn, apply, and use. Wang particularly pointed at merged characters borne with these problems. Speed of writing =Simplified characters= *Simplified characters have fewer strokes in general. For example, the common character ÈÇä (biƒÅn, meaning \\"side\\") has 18 strokes, while its simplified form Ëæπ has only 5. Proponents of simplification claim that this makes them faster to write. *People educated in traditional characters will often make extensive ad-hoc character simplifications in their handwriting to save time. This is similar to the practice of using abbreviations in informal written English (i.e. \\"thru\\" for \\"through\\") and proponents of traditional characters reply that this does not mean that the informal simplifications should be adopted as standard. Even in Taiwan where simplified characters are prohibited in official documents, signs can also sometimes have simplified characters. For example, È≠ØËèú is sometimes simplified as È≤ÅËèú, as the character È≤Å and its variant È≠Ø would hardly be distinguishable if they were written with large strokes. =Traditional characters= *Proponents of the counterargument posit that the speed advantage of simplified Chinese becomes less relevant in the internet age. With modern computing, entering Chinese characters is now dependent on the convenience of input method editors or IMEs. Most IMEs use phoneme-based input, such as pinyin romanization or bopomofo, while others are grapheme- based, such as cangjie and wubi. These have sidelined the speed problems in handwritten Chinese, as traditional and simplified Chinese input methods have the same input speed, especially with phoneme-based IMEs. Thus, characters like È´î/‰Ωì may be just as quick to input as the other, while the traditional form‚Äîthough more complex‚Äîmay offer a more distinctive shape that is therefore less easily confused with other common characters. (È´î would never, for instance, be mistaken for ‰ºë.) Furthermore, even when it comes to handwriting, a majority of people resort to semi-cursive script by abbreviating strokes or form to save time, thereby circumventing the problem of slower handwriting.  Phonetics =Relation with simplified characters= *Proponents point out that Chinese characters are most often made up of a pronunciation- indicating part (called the phonetic) and a part that indicates the general semantic domain (called the radical). During the process of simplification, there are some attempts to bring greater coherence to the system. For example, the shape of ÊÜÇ (y≈çu), meaning \\"anxious\\", is not a good indicator of its pronunciation, because there are no clear radical and phonetic components. The simplified version is Âøß, a straightforward combination of ÂøÑ, the \\"heart\\" radical to the left (indicating emotion) and the phonetic Â∞§ (y√≥u) to the right. *Simplification emphasizes the phonetic, rather than semantic, nature of the characters. Most Chinese speakers are familiar with Standard Chinese, which the pronunciation is based on. =Relation with traditional characters= *Opponents point out that some simplified forms undermine the phonetics of the original characters, e.g. Áõ§ (p√°n, plate) has the phonetic component Ëà¨ (bƒÅn) on top, but the simplified form is Áõò, whose upper part is now Ëàü (zh≈çu). Áõß (l√∫, a family name) and Áàê (l√∫, \\"furnace\\") shares the same component Áõß in their original forms, but they were inconsistently simplified into Âç¢ and ÁÇâ respectively, so that ÁÇâ now has the less helpful Êà∑ (h√π) as its phonetic. For the simplification to be consistent, Âç¢ should have been used instead of Êà∑ as the righthand component in ÁÇâ, as they are originally identical as Áõß.Zhengzhang, Shangfang () (2003). (Old Chinese Phonology), Shanghai: Shanghai Education Press. . Some characters were radically stripped of all phonetic elements. An example of a traditional character simplified such that its phonetic element is totally removed is Âª£ (gu«éng, meaning \\"extensive\\"), of which the internal character ÈªÉ (hu√°ng) is enclosed within a Âπø. Simplified, the character is written without its internal phonetic element, and with no replacement: Âπø. *A classic feature of the traditional Chinese writing system is its versatility in representing not only the range of spoken varieties of the Chinese language‚Äîmany of them mutually unintelligible to one another in speech‚Äîbut also certain vastly different languages outside of China. The re- phonologizing of simplified characters further jeopardizes the writing system's traditional ability to bring mutual understanding between speakers of different, especially non-Mandarin Chinese dialects. * Uncoordinated simplification policies imposed on postwar Japan have led to instances of there being three forms of the same character in widespread use, for example, traditional Èóú was simplified to Èñ¢ in postwar Japan but to ÂÖ≥ in the PRC. (In general, the new Japanese orthography made many fewer changes to the writing system than Simplified Chinese.) Radicals =Simplified radicals= *Proponents say that the radical system is imperfect in the first place. For example, Á¨ë (smile, laugh) uses the \\"bamboo\\" radical, which has no obvious relation to smiling or laughing.  =Traditional radicals= *Some argue that simplification results in a broken connection between characters, which makes it more difficult for students to expand their vocabulary in terms of perceiving both the meaning and pronunciation of a new character. For example, È¨ß, n√†o (din, fuss) is now Èóπ, with the door radical Èó® that is not indicative of its meaning. *The round of characters simplified by the Communist Party was not systematic.McBride-Chang, Catherine. Chen, Hsuan-Chih. (2003). Reading development in Chinese Children. Praeger/Greenwood publishing. . Extensive studies have been conducted among different age groups, especially children, to show that reducing the strokes loses the radical and phonetic relationships between the characters. This actually makes it more difficult for simplified character readers to distinguish the characters, since they now rely heavily on memorization. * Some traditional characters are very distinct, such as electricity/lightning Èõª di√†n, rope Áπ© sh√©ng and turtle Èæú g≈´i. After the simplification process all three characters appear to share the same component even though they have no relationship at all. Respectively: electricity Áîµ, rope Áª≥, turtle Èæü can now conceivably be mistaken for one another, while their distinctions in the traditional forms are unmistakable. The simplification of the word electricity/lightning Èõª to Áîµ also removed its semantic component. Stripped of its radical, Áîµ no longer bears any sense of semantic affinity with characters like snow Èõ™, thunder Èõ∑, and hail Èõπ, themselves all untouched in the PRC simplification scheme. The same radical was similarly removed in the simplification of \\"clouds\\" Èõ≤ to ‰∫ë. * The disparity between leaving standalone characters unsimplified but taking the grass script form whenever applicable (such as in È£ü, Èáë, Á≥∏ and Ë®Ä) has been evidenced to hinder character recognition in young children by a large degree. *Critics of the proposed replacement for the traditional system of radicals see the new system as being no less arbitrary than the existing system, it therefore only complicates matters to introduce a competing standard that as a radical departure from traditional radical arrangement might cause more confusion than simplification.The traditional system of radicals is no more arbitrary than, by analogy, the traditional order of the letters of the English alphabet, or the English names for the letters, all of these being to varying extents agreed-upon standards which have enjoyed supreme precedence in their respective orthographic traditions. Any attempt to simplify or reform established standards must demonstrate extreme utility to be worth the risk of the confusion and complications that inevitably arise when such arbitrary standards are changed to new standards, especially when the new standards are just as arbitrary as the old ones, if not more so. Aesthetics =Simplified aesthetics= *Simplified Chinese characters are more legible when small fonts are used, or if the electronic display has a low resolution. The fine details of traditional Chinese characters are easy to discern in large size calligraphy but the individual strokes of a number of complex characters are harder to distinguish when smaller fonts are used and some components are slightly altered as a solution. This problem is exacerbated by low-quality printing or usage of thicker lines. The recognition issue applies to some OCR software as well. Such software is more accurate with hanzi of simpler composition. =Traditional aesthetics= *The problem with the displaying of certain traditional Chinese characters is largely irrelevant as characters are recognisable by their shape and form as a whole and not by each individual stroke. Moreover, as one gets used to reading traditional Chinese characters, the initial discomfort from having to read them on small screens or fonts is likely to fade away. *Aesthetic continuity with China's immense heritage of art, literature, and calligraphy is diminished by the supplanting of characters that have been in standard use for centuries with an arbitrary selection of vernacular and shorthand variants along with many invented forms that are nowhere to be found in most writings, inscriptions, and art made in China before the 20th century. *Traditional Chinese characters are often used as the standard characters set in Chinese calligraphy in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and are even allowed for calligraphy in the PRC, presumably because of its aesthetic value.Advantages and Disadvantages on Traditional Characters vs Simplified Characters, 2002, published by Government of City of Taipei, Republic of China In point 3, it reads \\"Traditional characters is aesthetically pleasing, and therefore it is widely used by people who practice Chinese calligraphy throughout the world including countries such as Japan, Korea as well as mainland China. It is because traditional characters is able to express the artistic essence of calligraphy.\\" *A strong preference for the aesthetics of traditional characters among Mainland Chinese is evident in their significant usage of traditional forms in artistic work, signage, advertising, and internet screen names. *Even though about 30% of simplified Chinese characters match simplified kanji, those who understand traditional Chinese will understand a much greater proportion of Japanese Kanji, as the current standard Japanese character set is much more similar to traditional Chinese. *Simplified characters, such as Èó® for ÈñÄ (m√©n, door) look like the universal informal handwritten form, and look as improper as cursive would look in printed English. Practicality =Practicality of simplified characters= Traditional Chinese characters are only still used primarily by those in Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong and many overseas communities, comprising a small minority of the Chinese-speaking population (~50 million people). However, they also remain in use in mainland China for artistic, scholarly and advertising purposes. Simplified Chinese has come to dominate the written form of Chinese used nearly all over the world, due to the size and rising influence of mainland China. The United Nations has also used simplified Chinese since 1973. Moving back to traditional characters on the mainland has the potential to be difficult, confusing, and time-consuming. *Chinese text written before the 20th century was in Classical Chinese, which is much different from the written vernacular Chinese used today, even in traditional characters. Learning to read the older texts requires additional study, even from Chinese-speakers educated in traditional characters. Many versions of the Chinese Classics have been published in simplified characters. *Acceptance of simplified characters is increasing, mirroring acceptance of the pinyin romanization system that was once a PRC and now an international standard, although with much greater resistance and to a significantly lesser extent. In the 1960s and 1970s, Chinese as a foreign language was taught in countries like France and the United States solely in traditional characters. In the 1990s, universities in the United States were split between simplified and traditional, with simplified growing and traditional being taught mainly for the benefit of those who wish to learn Classical Chinese, or Chinese for use in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, or overseas Chinese communities. Today, in terms of teaching and learning Chinese as a foreign language outside of China, the simplified characters has \\"become the first choice because of student demand\\". Regardless, some instructors allow students the choice to write in either simplified or traditional characters. *With today's division of labor, not all students need to learn to read classical texts. Schoolchildren can learn simplified characters first, and then traditional characters later if they want to be linguists or historians. =Practicality of traditional characters= *If the PRC was able to impose its scheme of simplified characters on the majority of Chinese people, then a reversion to the use of traditional characters could hardly be any less feasible. From the pro- traditional point of view, there is as much reason, if not more, to return to the traditional orthography, as there ever was to simplify in the first place. Furthermore, it would be fatalistic and patronizing to deem Chinese people incapable of learning the older forms due merely to the sheer prevalence of simplified characters' usage in most of China today. *While written communication with the large population of mainland China and other communities requires the use of simplified Chinese, there are compelling practical reasons which require the use of traditional characters. The Republic of China (ROC) is the largest community of traditional character users and ROC President Ma Ying-jeou pushed for the removal of simplified Chinese translations which were available for use by Mainland internet users on government websites before June 15, 2011. Government documents and websites are to only use traditional characters and while simplified characters are not banned in Taiwan the president strongly encouraged the exclusive use of traditional characters, even in the tourism sector. This move to protect traditional characters ensures that visitors to the Republic of China will need to learn traditional characters if they wish to use Chinese. *Another common practical reason for the continuation of traditional characters is the expansive cultural legacy of Chinese history and art prior to simplification. The written form did evolve over the centuries but the traditional character set used today is much more closely related to the written Chinese which has been in use for thousands of years. As such the traditional characters are said to provide access to Chinese culture prior to simplification. *Those wishing to communicate or do business with overseas Chinese communities in the Western World require knowledge of traditional characters given their dominance in such communities and the negative connotations many in these communities associate with simplified characters. *Many Chinese character dictionary apps can display both traditional and simplified versions of Chinese words, so being able to switch between character systems should not pose any major issues when reading traditional characters. Politics The long history of Chinese characters and the role of the Chinese Communist Party in the design and adoption of simplified characters means that there is often a strong political aspect to the debate on the usage of traditional and simplified Chinese characters. =Communist Party and simplified characters= *While the use of simplified Chinese is often associated with the PRC and its ruling Communist party the connection today is not as simple as it once may have been. Many simplified Chinese texts are published outside of mainland China. Chinese newspapers in Singapore and Malaysia are mainly published in simplified Chinese, although overseas publications, such as in Chinese communities in the U.S., still mostly use traditional characters. Most university Chinese programs in the United States and France teach simplified characters, and the number continues to rise. The internet is also increasingly diverse, with many websites including Wikipedia offering an easy switch between simplified and traditional scripts. *Character simplification began in 1956 and had origins going back to the early 20th century before the founding of the PRC. Even the Kuomintang developed a draft plan for character simplification in 1935, and as late as 1946 made positive statements about simplified characters like \\"As long as it doesn't use [romanization] or [bopomofo], anything can be considered guoyu\\". Character simplification was not a part of the Four Olds nor the Cultural Revolution (both began in the mid 1960s). Whether traditional characters were \\"destroyed\\" or not is a matter of opinion, others might say they were \\"modified\\". Chinese culture is not static; Chinese people no longer wear Han Chinese clothing and this is not considered a big loss to Chinese culture. *Simplified Chinese characters were not entirely developed by the PRC as some of the simplified characters were taken from Japanese Shinjitai, such as Â≠¶ from Â≠∏ (xu√©, to study). *Promotion of traditional characters is sometimes characterized as a Taiwanese plot to sabotage China's language policy and to promote Sinocentrism and Chinese cultural nationalism, thereby undermining China's relation with national minorities and isolating China from the world. *Those who use simplified characters often remark that the subject is a simple one which has been made overly complicated by political considerations. They claim that the use of simplified characters or traditional characters should be decided based on pragmatic or aesthetic reasons, not political ones. =Nationalist usage of traditional characters= *In the communities where traditional characters are used, simplified characters are strongly associated with Maoism and iconoclasm and so they are viewed very negatively. By extension, continued use of traditional characters has been a conspicuous way of maintaining national cultural identity.Guo, Yingjie. (2004). Routledge. Cultural Nationalism in Contemporary China: The Search for National Identity under reform. . School children in these areas are strongly discouraged from using simplified characters. In Taiwan especially, simplified characters have been regarded as \\"Communist\\" (viz. PRC propaganda), and accordingly they are quite diligently avoided.Rogers, Henry. (2005) Writing Systems: A Linguistic Approach. Blackwell Publishing. . *More specifically, character simplification, in light of the destructive, \\"Anti-Four Olds\\" during the Cultural Revolution, is sometimes characterized a \\"Communist plot\\" to cut off traditional Chinese culture and values.Rohsenow, John S. \\"Chinese Language Use in Chicagoland\\" from Ethnolinguistic Chicago: Language and Literacy in the City's Neighborhoods. (2003). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. . p. 338. Simplified characters were banned in Taiwan until 2003,Taiwan affairs office under PRC. \\"Gwytb.gov.cn .\\" Mainland literature embraced in Taiwan. Retrieved on 2009-01-12. and only learned by specialists doing intelligence work on Communist China. Simplified characters are also branded in Taiwan as \\"bandit characters\\" (Âå™Â≠ó, literally gangster characters).Planning Chinese Characters: Reaction, Evolution Or Revolution. Zhao, Shouhui Zhao. Baldauf, Richard B. Baldauf, Richard B. Jr. Springer publishing, 2007. , . pg 216. *The use of two different writing systems has made it easier for the Communist Party of China to selectively censor the domestic reprinting of Chinese-language books first published outside the PRC, as, by requiring Chinese publishers to print a new edition in simplified characters provides an opportunity to prevent a book from being printed at all in the mainland. For example, the book Whispers and Moans was very popular in Hong Kong but a simplified character edition was blocked by Beijing's Central Bureau of Censorship, and the original edition could not be sold legally on the mainland because it was in traditional characters. The book, which is about the sex trade in Hong Kong, was said to conflict with the mainland's Marriage Law.Yang, Yishan. Whispers and Moans: Interviews with the Men and Women of Hong Kong's Sex industry. (2006). Blacksmith Books. . p. 17. Developments in the 21st century In recent years, the official Campaign of Simplification of Chinese Language has caused many controversial discussions in the general public to higher level of the government in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and amongst some international organisations. =2007= In November 2007, scholars and representatives from Japan, Korea, mainland China, and Taiwan came to Beijing and joined the Eighth Annual International Conference of Chinese Language Study. The conference was conducted and hosted by the National Office of International Promotion of Chinese Language and Board of Language Usage & Applications of the Ministry of Education of China. Immediately after, Korean media reported that the scholars and representatives reached a few conclusions after long discussion in the conference. One of those conclusions was that scholars would be using Traditional Chinese characters to standardise 5000 common Chinese characters across the countries and would continue to allow the use of Simplified Chinese characters if there happened to have one across those different areas. However, Chinese officials claimed that they did not reach such an agreement but would like to see the harmonious coexistence of Traditional and Simplified Chinese. Still, to many, that was the approval from Chinese Government because they were no longer absolutely opposed to the use of Traditional Chinese. =2008= In March 2008, a Mainland author, Wang Gan, published a review article on his personal blog about the possibility of the re-introduction of Traditional Chinese, What About Abolishing Simplified Chinese within the Next 50 Years?.Wang Gan, 2008-03-02, ‰∫îÂçÅÂπ¥ÂÜÖÔºåÂ∫üÈô§ÁÆÄÂåñÂ≠óÂ¶Ç‰Ωï Twenty-one members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delivered a proposal to add Traditional Chinese characters to the primary school curriculum. The proposal was rejected by the Minister of Education, who explained, 'Our nation has its fundamental governing principles. [One of them, by law, is] to promote the usage of Simplified Chinese and Mandarin. This is the basic condition‚Ä¶ Thus, we will not consider re-introducing Traditional Chinese education in our primary school curricula.' On 5 July 2008, on his visit to Taiwanese writer Koarn Hack Tarn's home, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou promised that he would not introduce the usage of Simplified Chinese into the territories just because of the local newly passed policy to let Mainland tourists visit Taiwan but to provide side-by-side translation so that Mainland visitors could appreciate the aesthetic nature of Traditional Chinese. And he also told journalists that he wished all Chinese people would eventually be using Traditional Chinese in the near future. =2009= In early 2009, the ROC (Taiwan) government launched a campaign to obtain World Heritage status for Traditional Chinese characters in a bid to preserve them for the future.Taipei Times - Thousands gather to set record (2 Jan 2009) At the Eleventh National People's Congress, a representative from Taiwan, Ms. Chen Jun, called for the Chinese government to support the world heritage campaign. She also suggested the introduction of Traditional Characters education into mainland primary and secondary education to improve passion for and understanding of traditional Chinese culture and language. During a March 2009 CPPCC meeting, member Pan Qinglin proposed that simplified characters should be abolished and Traditional Character usage reimplemented over the course of ten years. His proposal was widely criticized as frivolous. At the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences China Studies Forum in April 2009, it was announced that some adjustments would be made to the simplified characters. Experts acknowledged that some of the earlier character simplifications were problematic and inhibited understanding. Academics expressed support for the concept of \\"know traditional, write simplified\\" and specifically rejected the idea of reintroducing traditional characters as too costly and impractical. They cited a survey of ninety-one top-ranked senior classical Chinese literature and Chinese language students from Beijing Normal University testing their ability to write Traditional Characters, which only three students passed.

Hall and performed by country singer Jeannie C. Riley. The film starred Barbara Eden, Nanette Fabray, Ronny Cox, Louis Nye and Susan Swift, directed by Richard Bennett and Ralph Senensky (who left the production during filming, and was replaced by Bennett), and primarily released to drive-in theaters throughout the summer of 1978. The film has a cult following in fans of the original song. The film's promotional tagline is: \\"The song was scandalous. The movie is hilarious!\\" Plot Stella Johnson is a beautiful widowed single mother who lives in the town of Harper Valley, Ohio. She sells cosmetics door-to-door for the fictitious AngelGlo Cosmetics and is not afraid to enjoy life. Her fourteen- year-old daughter, Dee, is a student at Harper Valley Junior High School. After leaving school, Dee brings her mother a letter from the school's Parent Teacher Association board, which is led by the pompous and snobbish Flora Simpson-Reilly. The letter denounces her for her not following the societal mores of the day and the community and further stating that if she does not change her ways more to the board's liking, Dee will be punished for her mother's \\"sins\\" by being expelled from school. Infuriated by the board's supposed superiority and their glaring hypocrisy, Stella storms to the PTA meeting being held that day, and proceeds to tell most of the PTA members off by exposing their hidden skeletons for the town to see. After her house is toilet papered and a rock with a vile note attached is thrown through her window in retaliation, Stella prepares to get even with those who would want her driven out of town. She teams up with her friends, beautician Alice Finley and bartender Herbie Maddox, and (along with Dee's help) wreaks hilarious and justified revenge on six of the hypocritical PTA members, with methods including: (1) tricking a married male board member who has repeatedly tried to date Stella into a disastrous rendezvous, (2) embarrassing Mrs. Simpson- Reilly at one of her grand social gatherings, (3) exposing the secret antics of a supposedly prim-and-proper female board member/teacher, and (4) sending a herd of pink-painted elephants into the bedroom of an alcoholic board member. During the course of the movie, she finds out that one of the male PTA members, wealthy Willis Newton (who was not a party to the PTA letter), has fallen in love with her. Will and another male on the PTA board, Skeeter Duggan, the town's Notary public, are sympathetic to Stella and do not agree with Flora and her cronies. After being informed by Will of the current PTA Board's incompetence and mismanagement and with his help, Stella is convinced to make a run for President of the PTA, a move which infuriates Flora and her allies. After a makeover, which sees her braces removed and her hair styled, Dee also finds a boyfriend in handsome Carlyle, a popular school track star, which incurs the jealousy of Bettina Reilly, the equally snobbish granddaughter of Flora. Also shown are Edwina, Bettina's identical twin sister who is just as snobbish as Bettina, and Dee's best friend Mavis. Real estate agent Kirby Baker, a member of the PTA Board, plans to ruin Stella by foreclosing on her house (which his company owns), but is arrested for assaulting Myrna Wong, an Asian-American martial arts expert helping Stella to set up the lecherous Baker. Now things become more and more desperate. The board finally decide to resort to criminal means to maintain the power they hold, which is fast slipping away thanks to Stella's growing popularity. The board members then decide to hire a couple of kidnappers named Dutch and Tex to have Skeeter abducted so they can commit election fraud. The kidnappers snatch Skeeter as he is taking the trash out and take him in a nearby abbey, where he is imprisoned and made drunk on wine. Olive Glover, the PTA's Recording Secretary who has a hardcore gambling addiction, has stolen money from the Milk Fund Rally, one of the PTA's numerous fund raisers, and intends to having Mavis framed for the crime and arrested. Leaving Dee to stall the PTA Board meeting, Stella and Alice follow Olive to a racing stable and recover the stolen money, some of which had been marked by Will. As Stella and Alice race back to town, Will and Herbie spot the kidnappers and Skeeter outside the abbey from a helicopter and notify the girls. Disguised as nuns, Stella and Alice find Skeeter, free him and manage to escape with him after a wild car chase ending with the kidnappers crashing into a stream. Ultimately, Flora's scheme to prevent Stella's nomination fails miserably: Olive, who would have been the swing vote against Stella, is arrested for embezzlement just as the PTA Board is about to vote against Stella's candidacy. Dutch and Tex, already in custody for the Skeeter Duggan kidnapping, tell the police that Flora was behind it all to keep Stella off the PTA Board. Stella decisively wins the election and becomes the new PTA president, with the whole town voting to get rid of Flora and her snobbish friends. Will and Stella then fly off in his helicopter (which is trailing a sign saying \\"Stella Johnson for Mayor\\") to get married. Cast and characters * Barbara Eden as Stella Johnson, a widowed cosmetics salesperson with a young daughter, whose joie de vivre, her principles, and her individuality anger most of the powerful people in town and on the Parent Teachers Association board. She inevitably becomes PTA president after embarrassing Flora, the snobby former President and her equally snobby friends. * Ronny Cox as Willis \\"Will\\" Newton, a wealthy member of the PTA who doesn't agree with Flora and her snobby allies and is in love with Stella. He and Stella get married at the end of the movie. * Nanette Fabray as Alice Finley, Stella's best friend and co-conspirator against the snobs of Harper Valley. She owns and operates the La Moderne Beauty Shop. * Louis Nye as Kirby Baker, a local real estate agent who is allied with Flora and her friends. Notorious for being a lecherous playboy and infamous for impregnating his secretaries, one of whom, Gladys Wilmot, left town to see an abortionist in Cincinnati. As part of a plan to discredit Stella, he tries to foreclose on Stella's house, which infuriates her. He then gets arrested and jailed for attacking Myrna Wong, a friend of Stella's, who rebuffs his advances, throwing him by use of martial arts and destroying the office. * John Fiedler as Bobby Taylor, a man on the PTA who lusts after Stella. Overly dominated by his wife, Holly. Although open to allow Stella to speak, he is not above having a fellow PTA board member kidnapped to commit election fraud. He was arrested for indecent exposure after being set up by Stella. * Ron Masak as Herbie Maddox, the head bartender at Kelly's bar, and Stella's ally against Flora and her friends. He has a crush on Stella, and is one of her friends. * Clint Howard as Corley, a young delivery person, who works for the local florist shop, who brings Stella flowers from Will. * Susan Swift as Dee Johnson, Stella's 14-year-old daughter, who is threatened with expulsion from school if her mother doesn't conform to the way the PTA wants her to behave. She has a hand in assisting her mother and Alice with one of their revenge schemes. She loses her braces, gets a makeover, and ends up with a boyfriend, Carlyle. * Pat Paulsen as Otis Harper, the descendant of the founding family of Harper Valley. A PTA member who is allied with Flora and her friends. Has a tendency to drink all the time, which annoys his wife, Bertha. He had a stampede of elephants, painted pink, stormed through his house, destroying it. * Amzie Strickland as Shirley Thompson, a member of the PTA board who tends to drink a lot of gin. Though she is allied with Flora and her friends, she is one of four PTA members (Will, Skeeter and Holly Taylor are the others) who are spared any retribution from Stella. She was seen as the most sympathetic of the board, as she tended to be more manipulated as opposed to being manipulative. It was never revealed whether or not she retained her seat on the PTA, but it is presumed that she became more sympathetic towards Stella as she was seen waving goodbye at Olive as she was being arrested. * Bob Hastings as Skeeter Duggan, a member of the PTA board, and the town's Notary public who is sympathetic to Stella. He is kidnapped by Dutch and Tex at Flora Simpson Reilly's orders. * Audrey Christie as Flora Simpson-Reilly, The movie's main antagonist. She is the pompous and extremely snobbish president of the PTA board who thoroughly despises Stella (who defeats her for president at the end of the movie) and all she stands for. So desperate is she to retain her power and prestige in the community that she has a fellow member of the PTA (Skeeter Duggan) kidnapped so she and her allies can commit election fraud. She is embarrassed when her permanent set is destroyed by a hair depilatory at the beauty salon. * Molly Dodd as Olive Glover, the recording secretary of the PTA who is a gambling addict. Clearly the most corrupt and most vindictive member of the PTA board, she is eventually arrested for embezzlement after having a load of hay and horse manure dumped on top of her. She is the one who initially angers Stella by sending her the letter denouncing her, and tries to get Dee's friend, Mavis, arrested for embezzlement. * Fay DeWitt as Willamae Jones, a snide biology teacher at the junior high school who is also a member of the PTA. She makes no secret of the fact that she favors the Reilly twins, due to the connections between her and Flora. Notorious for being a nymphomaniac (though she hides it under a prim-and-proper fa√ßade), she is caught in flagrante delicto with Barney Crunk, the town's mailman, on film. * DeVera Marcus as Holly Taylor, Bobby's obviously overbearing wife, who tends to drink a lot when Bobby is out of town, and doesn't approve of Bobby's lusting, or of anything else he does (this is different from the character in the song, who \\"seems to use a lot of ice whenever [her husband]'s away\\", implying adultery with the iceman). However, despite her ties to Flora and her scheming friends, she, like Shirley Thompson, is spared any retribution from Stella, due to Stella refusing to date Bobby. * Louise Foley as Mavis, Dee Johnson's best friend, who is nearly framed for a crime she did not commit by the vindictive Olive Glover. * Brian Cook as Carlyle, a popular track star who chooses Dee, after she gets a makeover, and angers Bettina Reilly in the process. * Laura Teige as Bettina Reilly, One of Flora's twin granddaughters, who wants to be with Carlyle, and is jealous when he chooses Dee over her. She tends to be as snotty as her grandmother. * Jan Teige as Edwina Reilly, Bettina's twin sister, who is just as snotty. * Irene Yah-Ling Sun as Myrna Wong, a friend of Stella's who is a judo expert; she is assaulted by Kirby Baker, destroys him and his office in retaliation, and has him sent to jail for assault. * Tobias Anderson as \\"Cranky\\" Barney Crunk, the town's nosy mailman who had the bad habit of peeking in everyone's mail. He is caught in flagrante delicto on film with Willamae Jones. * Royce D. Applegate as Dutch, one of two kidnappers who abduct Skeeter Duggan at Flora Simpson-Reilly's orders. * J. J. Barry as Tex, the mastermind of the kidnap plot to get Skeeter Duggan out of the way so Flora Simpson-Reilly and her friends could commit election fraud. He and his accomplice Dutch are arrested and the two of them rat out Flora and her friends on their scheme. * Pitt Herbert as Henry Reilly, Flora's overly dominated husband and grandfather to Edwina and Bettina. Henry is wealthy, but is very weak-willed and is known for acquiescing to his wife's schemes. * Arlen Stuart as Bertha Harper, wife of Otis Harper, who gets annoyed by her husband's continual drinking. She is terrified when her house is destroyed by pink-painted elephants. * Woody Harrelson as an extra. Perhaps this launched his professional career. Production and release =Filming= Harper Valley PTA was filmed in twenty-seven days from October 1, 1977 to December 8, 1977. It was filmed on location for one week in the town of Lebanon, Ohio and then continued in Los Angeles, California. The track meet scene was filmed at Simi Valley High School St. Petersburg Times Director Ralph Senensky left the production only two weeks before the end of principal photography, and was replaced by Richard Benett. On October 31, 1977, Senensky argued with the producers about a scene featuring pink elephants in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, believing that the animals would be spooked by filming on Halloween night.

One of Minnesota's leading examples of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, it occupies an entire city block and sports a clock tower. With It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Duluth Central High School in 1972 for its state-level significance in the theme of architecture. Description The Historic Old Central High School is a massive, three-story building of Lake Superior Brownstone. Its footprint is an inverted \\"T\\" shape. The clock tower is centrally placed, with the main entrance through a massive arch at its base. The clock faces are in diameter. Two small turrets flank the clock tower. The entrance arches are echoed by arched window openings on the second floor, the dormers, and the around the clock faces. The interior originally contained 11 classrooms on the ground floor and 10 on the second floor, a library with a large fireplace, offices, and a two-story auditorium. Large double staircases of slate and iron led to the upper floors. The third floor contained laboratories, shop classrooms, a gymnasium, a music room, and a teaching museum. Much of the interior has been altered over the years due to changing needs and safety standards. A wing containing an updated gymnasium and chemistry classrooms was later added to the north. History The Historic Old Central High School was designed by the prominent East Coast architectural firm of Palmer, Hall, & Hunt, with local assistance from Duluth-based architects Oliver G. Traphagen and Francis W. Fitzpatrick. The cornerstone was laid in 1891 at a ceremony attended by roughly 7,000 people. The clock was manufactured by E. Howard & Co. of Boston and installed in 1893. Two years later, five bells, cast by the Buckeye Bell Foundry of Cincinnati, Ohio,. In this video, the inscription can clearly be seen indicating the Buckeye foundry. were added to the clock to chime the Westminster Quarters. From 1898 to 1942 a cannon stood on the high school's steps, a prize captured from the Spanish warship Oquendo during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. As America entered World War II the cannon was donated to a scrap metal drive and melted down. Recent use Upon the completion of a new Central High School in 1971, Duluth Public Schools ceased using the old high school building for classroom instruction. The Central Preservation Committee and other interested citizens worked to save it from demolition. It was officially renamed the Historic Old Central High School on October 19, 2004. Today the Old Central High School houses offices for the school district, Education Equity, Indian Education, and the St. Louis County Soil & Water District. It also contains an 1890s classroom museum. Instruction has resumed in the building via community education and Unity High School alternative education programs.

The show began following David Beckham's move to Los Angeles Galaxy, and Beckham often contributes to the show in the form of Interviews. Each week there was a special guest in the studio, usually a British sports personality, to whom Lovejoy chatted about their career and their views on Major League Soccer. A slightly different version of the show hosted by Natalie Pinkham and completely devoid of any content derived from British studio footage was broadcast in the USA on Fox Soccer Channel. Several regular features aside from MLS highlights were present in every show. One of these features was a \\"translation\\" of American commentary, called \\"How to speak U.S. Commentator\\". This provides a definition of slang used by commentators which differs from that used in Britain. Viewers were also invited to choose an MLS team to support and e-mail their choice to the show, from which polls were collected, determining the nation's favourite teams.  Running gags  The show was presented in a light-hearted manner and contains a variety of running gags which run over several weeks, such as: 1. At the beginning of each show, Lovejoy introduced himself as a Chelsea and Kansas Wizards fan, after which he said \\"Go Wizards\\". A silver curving flash then appeared across the screen and the presenter moved his hand in the direction of the flash as it moved across the screen. The flash and Lovejoy's hand were almost never co-ordinated, adding a comic element. 2. Many of the guests referred to Scottish player Paul Dalglish, who played for the Houston Dynamo, which led Lovejoy to suggest the title of the programme be changed to 'Paul Dalglish's Soccer USA'. 3. Lovejoy sometimes gave an update on one of the MLS clubs, and called it, for example, 'Houston Update' or 'New England Update'. After he is finished, he then went on to the 'Dallas update', and talks not about FC Dallas, the MLS team, but the soap opera Dallas. 4. Lovejoy would often comment on and show a clip of player Logan Pause followed by Tim pretending to have been paused by standing very still for around 5 seconds.  Differences between the British and American versions  1. The American version was hosted by Natalie Pinkham, who was traditionally out on location at various Major League Soccer related events. The British version was hosted by Tim Lovejoy in a studio. 2. The American version was presented as a serious highlight show, featuring game footage with all English highlight packages narrated by JP Dellacamera. The British version was presented as a lighthearted educational look at Major League Soccer and soccer in the United States in general. The British version contained a highlight package featuring the original broadcast commentators, sometimes in English, sometimes in Spanish, depending on the source of the original broadcast.

It was a relatively new design in Gibson's ES line which was not based on a vintage instrument, as many of Gibson's instruments are. The ES-137 is available in two models, Custom and Classic. Gibson claims the ES-137 is a combination of its traditional semi-hollow-body single-cutaway guitars with the sound of a Les Paul Classic. This is achieved by fitting the archtop with pickups and other features matching the Les Paul. The format of archtop with a single florentine cutaway has been used by Gibson previously. Notable comparisons would be the Gibson ES-175 and Gibson ES-135 models. The basic body shape of the ES-137 is very close to Gibson's fully hollow-bodied ES-175. Despite the 137 being somewhat thinner than the ES-175, it is not classed as a thinline model. However, the ES-137 does sport an internal mahogany center block inside the body. This design eliminates feedback problems common with hollow-bodied guitars. The center block also facilitates the use of a stop tailpiece alike the ES-335, therefore eliminating the use of a \\"trapeze\\"-style tailpiece found on most hollow-bodied Gibsons.

It was founded in 1711. At the beginning housed in a single room in the city hall, in 1876 the school moved to a former convent and orphanage in the Rue du Midi, rehabilitated by the architect Pierre-Victor Jamaer, where the school still operates. History The Bombardment of Brussels by French troops in 1695 was the most destructive event in the history of this town.It happened during the War of Austrian Succession and the Siege of Brussels. After the reconstruction of the Grand Place, there was a turning point for the history of art in the Netherlands. In 1711, the City of Brussels gave the artists guilds a place for training. One room in the city hall (H√¥tel de Ville) was freed. The guilds of painting, sculpture, weaving and other art areas should have its own training center. On October 16 of the same year, the establishment of a new school took place.The principle of master and apprentice was left. This new school-system ultimately led to a loss of knowledge in the respective guilds. Model was the Accademia del Designo to Florence. In 1752, they moved to the hostel d'Golden Head. In 1762, the Duke Charles Alexander of Lorraine took over the school after a long crisis. Henceforth, their line was in his hands. His attention rested mainly on the architecture. In 1768, Barnab√© Guimord established the first architecture class. Through sales and issue of shares additional funds were made available. A year later, the school returned to the town hall. In 1795, the Academy was closed after the conquest of Brussels by the French revolutionary troops.  Resurgence under Fran√ßois-Joseph Navez  In 1829 the school moved into the Granvelle Palace on. One year later Fran√ßois-Joseph Navez became director. There was new life in the Acad√©mie, while the sculpture has been strongly promoted. He organized the school and expanded it. In 1832 it went to the basement of the left wing of the Industrial Palace. From 1835 til 1836 the plans of Navez were implemented. In 1836 it was awarded the privilege to wear \\"royale\\" as part of their name. The panel painting was declared to another important department. This was based on the old painting of the first golden age of Dutch painting. However, there was some time tensions at the Academy to the yet propagated Style of Neo-Classicism. In addition to painting and sculpture architectural education became more important. Only they never achieved the status of a pioneering teaching and training facility.In 1842, the Palladio Society was founded. It emerged from the class of the then professor Tilman-Fran√ßois Suys. The aim was to promote students in their learning path. Later, she advised the architects in all professional matters. The company was oriented very academy. It doesn't exists.Since 1936 the aims and objectives of the Palladian society are represented by the SADBr. They should be considered the successor organization. In 1876 the Academy moved to the school buildings in the Rue du Midi. It is the building of the former monastery Boogaard what had meanwhile served as an orphanage. The architect Pierre-Victor Jamaer was able to link the whole school in the limited space of the existing ensemble. The facade was redesigned by the architectural style of classicism. Till today this academy is here. From 5 January 1889 women were also allowed to participate in a class for advanced students.In Europe, moved away at this point from the social point of view, that the women were assigned to the amateurism. With this opening, they gained the right to be recognized as full-fledged artist. The term can be seen in the sense of Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. At the end of the 19th century was the founding of the modern LUCA Campus Sint-Lukas Brussels a strong competition. Meanwhile, ARBA is one of the 16 art schools of the French Community of Belgium. Under the director Charles van der Stappen the doctrine came to this university to an even greater prestige. Even literature and photography were part of the training offer. In the European art scene around the turn of the century Brussels drew forth in addition to his training center in the shadow of Paris.The Salon at Paris had reached its zenith at the time and thus lost its leading role. Since 1889 Brussels was the uncrowned capital of Art Nouveau, especially in the architecture, which had its triumphal procession through Prof. Horta.In the architecture the flow of eclecticism must not be ignored, which is a combination of Neo-classicism and Art Nouveau. In Brussels the facades of new buildings got this architectural design, too. Even abroad, this style has been taken by architects and builders as a model for their projects. The far eastern building is the surviving water tower of Breslau, Schlesien. In Belgium belonged such well-known names like Paul Picquet, Jean Baes, Fernand Conrad, Henri Beyaert and Paul Hankar to the most influential architects. The Academy managed the step to another center of the avant-garde in the panel painting. From the Academy and its students went influence on the development of Realism, Symbolism, the Impressionism, Neo-Impressionism, Post Impressionism and the newly incipient Expressionism. Everything was precursor of Modern Art. In the year 1912 Victor Horta had made changes to the organisation of this school. A system of studios was created, as it was recommended by Paul Bonduelle and Lambot.The architect Paul Bonduelle lived from 1877 to 1955.Since 1954 the Paul Bonduelle PriXin architecture from the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles is awarded.√âmile Labot was one of the key architects of the architectural style of the Belgian Art Nouveau. In 1936 the Royal Order was made to the formation of the separate Department of Architecture.  Changes in organization and teaching after 1945  In 1949 the rank of a small department for planning and urban development was established, too. The architectural studies got the rank of university education. In 1972, the Department of artistic humanities was established. At last in 1977 the Department of Architecture had finally acquired its autonomy. In 1977 the Institute Sup√©rieur d'Architecture Victor Horta, named after the Art Nouveau architect and former director, was founded.In 2009, the Faculty of Architecture of the Free University of Brussels was founded. This was done after the merger of the two schools of architecture: * School of Architecture Victor Horta (ISAVH) and * The chamber of the French Community of the Higher Institute of Architecture (ISACF). In 1980, the higher education of the second degree and new courses at the Academy of Fine Arts are presented. Today programs are offered for Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in the fields of design, art and media and offered doctoral studies, too. The Academy has been an ESA (Ecole Sup√©rieure des Arts - Art College) with a university orientation. In addition, it is part of Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium RASAB which was founded in 2001. It is responsible for the task of promoting activities of the affiliated members and organizations here and coordinate. - Her tasks include projects at home and abroad.

The Foundation's mission is to promote philanthropy and improve the quality of life for the residents of Berks County, Pennsylvania. Berks County Community Foundation's platinum LEED-certified green building in Reading, Pa. Berks County Community Foundation is a member of the Council on Foundations.  History  The Community Foundation, which was founded in 1994 with grants from the Wyomissing Foundation, a local private foundation, works with people, businesses and organizations to set up charitable funds that make grants to causes they care about. For example, someone who makes a donation to a humane society every year might want to continue to make that donation every year even after they die. By setting up a fund at the Community Foundation, that person can be assured that a grant will go to the humane society in his or her name every year. The Community Foundation manages hundreds of charitable funds, each created to support a cause the donor cared about. Some people create funds while they are alive so they can see the benefits of the grants they make. Others set up a fund in their will by leaving a certain amount of money or a portion of their estate to the Community Foundation and stipulating what it should be used for. Creating a fund at the Community Foundation through one's will allows donors to put money that would otherwise be used for taxes to use in the community. After local leaders and residents did some research and determined Berks County would greatly benefit from having a community foundation, Berks County Community Foundation‚Äôs articles of incorporation were filed June 7, 1994. To get started, The Wyomissing Foundation gave the fledgling Community Foundation $1 million in initial operating funds. The United Way of Berks County housed the Community Foundation for more than two years until the Community Foundation could afford its own space. Kevin Murphy was hired as the Foundation‚Äôs first employee in 1994 and has remained president ever since. In 1999, the foundation donated several defibrillators to area police departments. Beatrice M. Shaffer, a resident of Reading, left money in her will to create a fund managed by the foundation to help Jewish programs and Jewish people in need of assistance. She died in 2006, and the creation of the fund was announced by the foundation in 2007. In 2009, Berks County Community Foundation received its largest gift ever, a bequest from Myrtle Quier, the former chairman emeritus of the Reading Eagle newspaper. The building was awarded LEED¬Æ platinum status, which is the highest level of certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. LEED stands for Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design. As part of Berks County Community Foundation's free Downtown Alive outdoor concert series, co-sponsor John Weidenhammer introduces English rock band The Struts in the 500 block of Penn Street in Reading, Pa., on July 20, 2016. In addition to housing the Community Foundation, the building is home to Jump Start Incubator, a program that helps entrepreneurs start new businesses, and a Community Conference Center. In 2014, local businesswoman June Clougher was hired as the director of Jump Start Incubator. In 2015, a $100,000 grant from the Community Foundation's Hawley and Myrtle Quier Fund to the Reading Downtown Improvement District started the free Downtown Alive outdoor concert series, which was intended to showcase how vibrant downtown Reading can be. The first season of the series had performances by Striking Matches, Andrew McMahon, and the Gin Blossoms. The series was expanded in 2016 and included performances from Brothers Osborne, The Struts, a double-billed appearance by Toad the Wet Sprocket and Rusted Root, Marc Broussard, and the Pat McGee Band. In 2017, it was announced that the lineup for the series would include Charlie Cruz, Frankie Negr√≥n, the Eli Young Band, The Cadillac Three, Sister Hazel, The Griswolds, 24 Horas, George Lamond, and Funk Salsa Urban. In 2016, several companies came on board the concert series as co-sponsors, notably John Weidenhammer, president of Weidenhammer Systems Corp. Weidenhammer made a strong commitment to downtown Reading that summer, pledging to bring part of his workforce and a retail store or restaurant to a building he had purchased at the heart of Reading near Fifth and Penn streets. The largest contribution Berks County Community Foundation received from an individual donor in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2016, was $2.1 million to establish the Richard L. Henry Memorial Fund. The fund was established by the estate of Maxine R. Henry, who died at age 88 on October 29, 2015, so that she and her late husband, Richard, could continue to support causes that mattered to them. The largest donation that fiscal year was $2.5 million in connection with BB&T;‚Äôs acquisition of National Penn. That donation set up the BB&T; Economic Growth Fund, which is intended to invest in local economic development opportunities. In 2016, VOiCEup Berks became a fund of the Community Foundation. The fund, which is really an organization, is dedicated to connecting all sectors of Berks County to volunteer opportunities through service learning.

They, along with the Lamanites and the Amulonites are credited with building the city of Jerusalem, in the land of Jerusalem, within the land of Nephi (Alma 21:2). The character of the Amalekites is described as \\"more hardened than the Lamanites\\" (Alma 21:3). In the various wars, the Amalekites are appointed captains because of their murderous dispositions (Alma 43:6). Religiously, the Amalekites were followers of the order of Nehor (Alma 21:4). When Aaron, the son of Mosiah, enters their land, the Amalekites are among those who contend with him. Though they profess to believe in God, only one Amalekite is converted (Alma 23:14). Because of them, the Lamanites are spurred on to kill their own people, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies (Alma 24:1). During the various wars between the Nephites and Lamanites, they are described as being better armed and continually inspire the Lamanites to fight (Alma 43:20, 44). Origins Unlike Amlicites and Amulonites, no origin appears to be directly stated for the Amalekites, but it is worth noting that according to the Words of Mormon 1:16, there arose \\"false prophets\\" and \\"false preachers,\\" who were punished as the law allowed, and some of them joined the ranks of the Lamanites. Additionally, some scholars, including Professor Royal Skousen, have proposed, based on textual evidence and on spelling variations in the original manuscripts, that \\"Amalekite\\" is an alternative spelling of \\"Amlicite.\\" Thus, Skousen's research into the original manuscripts used as the source for printing the Book of Mormon suggests that the \\"Amalekites\\" and the \\"Amlicites\\" are not two separate groups but the same group. The original manuscripts provide evidence that this confusion arose due to human error in transcribing the Book of Mormon into English, as unfamiliar names were at times spelled inconsistently, as the contents of the Book of Mormon were verbally dictated to the scribes. That confusion, while not having doctrinal implications for the book's contents, still exists in the Book of Mormon as of 2016. https://onoma.lib.byu.edu/onoma/index.php/Amalekite%28s%29_Amlicite%28s%29_Variant See also *Amalickiahites *People of Morianton *Zoramites References *Book of Alma, in the Book of Mormon, available online *Brief description of Amalekites on scriptures.churchofjesuschrist.org External links *Excerpts on scriptures.churchofjesuschrist.org Book of Mormon peoples ","title":"Amalekites (Book of Mormon)"},{"id":"12799835","text":"The United Nations Angola Verification Mission I (I UNAVEM) was a peacekeeping mission that existed from January 1989 to June 1991 in Angola during the civil war.Meisler, Stanley.

The Indian Army contributed to this UN mission by deploying one infantry battalion group (1000 personnel) and one Engineers company group (200 pers). There were a total of six infantry battalion groups operating in distinct regions of Angola, during this period (One each from India, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Brazil, Bangladesh and Uruguay and also one battalion from Romania). The mandate of the Indian Infantry Battalion group was to ensure ceasefire between the Angolan Army and the UNITA rebels (who had control over more than half the country at that time), and then arrange for a safe \\"quartering\\" of these UNITA rebels once they laid down their arms. Subsequently, most of the arterial routes connecting major regions of the country were physically opened to traffic after demining them.

The society promotes understanding of geochemistry through the annual Goldschmidt Conference, publication of a peer-reviewed journal and electronic newsletter, awards programs recognizing significant accomplishments in the field, and student development programs. The society's offices are located on the campus of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC. Organization and meetings The Geochemical Society was founded in 1955 at a meeting of the Geological Society of America. Its first president was Earl Ingerson and dues started at two dollars per year. In 1990 it was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 1990. In 1988, the Geochemical society created the Goldschmidt Conferences in honor of the geochemist Victor Goldschmidt (1888-1947), \\"considered to be the founder of modern geochemistry and crystal chemistry\\". It was soon joined by the European Association of Geochemistry, and at the 2014 meeting the two organizations signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the governance and trademark protection of the meeting. The conference is one of the world's largest devoted to geochemistry. The society's board of directors holds its annual meeting during the conference. Membership The Geochemical Society has nearly 4,000 members from more than 70 countries. Most members are students, researchers and faculty of geochemistry related fields, although anyone with an interest in geochemistry may join. Membership is calendar year and dues are US$35 for a Professional, US$15 for Student, and $20 for Seniors. Membership includes a subscription to Elements Magazine and also offers discounts on Geochemical Society publications, Mineralogical Society of America publications and conference registration discounts at the Goldschmidt Conference, Fall AGU, and the annual GSA conference. Publications The Geochemical Society publishes, co-publishes, or sponsors the following: * Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta (GCA) ‚Äì peer-reviewed journal with 24 issues per year, co-sponsored with the Meteoritical Society. * Elements: An International Magazine of Mineralogy, Geochemistry, and Petrology ‚Äì 6 issues per year * Geochemical News ‚Äì electronic newsletter published weekly * Special Publications Series ‚Äì published at various times * Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry (RiMG) ‚Äì peer-reviewed multi-author volumes on topics approved by the governing councils of the Geochemical Society and the Mineralogical Society of America. * Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems (G-cubed) ‚Äì online journal with peer-reviewed original research papers. 12 issues per year published in collaboration with the American Geophysical Union. Awards The Geochemical Society presents the following annual awards: *V. M. Goldschmidt Award ‚Äì the society's highest honor, it is awarded for major achievements in geochemistry or cosmochemistry. *F.W. Clarke Medal ‚Äì named after Frank Wigglesworth Clarke (1847-1931), a chemist who determined the composition of the Earth's crust, it goes to an early-career scientist for an outstanding contribution to geochemistry or cosmochemistry. *C.C. Patterson Medal ‚Äì named after Clair Cameron Patterson (1922-1995), who developed uranium‚Äìlead dating, it recognizes an innovative breakthrough in environmental geochemistry, particularly one of value to society. *Alfred Treibs Medal ‚Äì Named after Alfred E. Treibs (1899‚Äì1983), whose papers on porphyrins were the beginning of the field of organic chemistry, it is awarded by the Organic Geochemistry Division (OGD) for major achievements in organic geochemistry. The OGD also presents an annual Best Paper Award for a publication in the previous year. *Geochemical Fellows ‚Äì Starting in 1996, the Geochemical Society and the European Association of Geochemistry (EAG) bestow this honor on outstanding scientists who have made a major contribution to the field of geochemistry. Holders of the Goldschmidt and Treibs medals, as well as the Urey Medal of the EAG, are automatically inducted. The Distinguished Service Award, which recognizes outstanding service to the Society or the geochemical community, is not awarded every year. The Geochemical Society sponsors a special lecture at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. Called the F. Earl Ingerson Lecture Series, it honors the first president of the Geochemical Society. At the Goldschmidt Conference, the Paul W.

This doctrine states that a manufacturer of a product has fulfilled its duty of care when it provides all of the necessary information to a \\"learned intermediary\\" who then interacts with the consumer of a product. This doctrine is primarily used by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers in defense of tort suits. In a clear majority of states, the courts have accepted this as a liability shield for pharmaceutical companies. This doctrine was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hollis v Dow Corning Corp., 129 DLR 609 (1995). History The use of the term \\"learned intermediary\\" was first used in the Eighth Circuit decision of Sterling Drug v. Cornish (370 F.2d 82, 85), in 1966, and has now become the prevailing doctrine in the majority of jurisdictions in the United States. Dissent Recently, this doctrine has been called into question due to the increased use of direct to consumer advertising, whereby drug manufacturers market pharmaceutical products to individuals rather than to doctors. For example, in Rimbert v. Eli Lilly & Co., 577 F. Supp. 2d 1174, 1218-19 (D. N.M. 2008), the District Court of New Mexico reasoned that the \\"dramatically increased marketing directed to consumers . . . would persuade the Supreme Court of New Mexico that the justification for the learned-intermediary doctrine is quickly becoming, if not already the case, outdated.\\" However, other recent cases have declined to adopt this so-called \\"direct-to-consumer advertising\\" exception to the learned intermediary doctrine.

The CNL is a registered nurse, with a Master of Science in Nursing who has completed advanced nursing coursework, including classes in pathophysiology, clinical assessment, finance management, epidemiology, healthcare systems leadership, clinical informatics, and pharmacology. CNLs are healthcare systems specialists that oversee patient care coordination, assess health risks, develop quality improvement strategies, facilitate team communication, and implement evidence-based solutions at the unit (microsystem) level. CNLs often work with clinical nurse specialists to help plan and coordinate complex patient care.CNL FAQs Curriculum and Certification The American Association of the Colleges of Nursing (AACN) delineates revised and updated competencies, curriculum development, and required clinical experiences expected of every graduate of a CNL master's education program, along with the minimum set of clinical experiences required to attain the end of program competencies. Competencies and Curricular Expectations for Clinical Nurse Leader Education and Practice The Commission on Nurse Certification (CNC), an autonomous arm of the AACN, provides certification for the Clinical Nurse Leader. The AACN, along with nurse executives and nurse educators designed the Clinical Nurse Leader role (the first new role in nursing in 35 years) in response to the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) comprehensive report on medical errors, To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System, released in November 1999.Institute of Medicine. (2000). To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System. Washington, DC: National Academy Press. Page 1.

Among stakeholders joining the AACN on the Implementation Task Force (ITF) were the American Organization of Nurse Executives (AONE) and the Department of Veteran Affairs (DVA). Within the healthcare system, the need for nurses with the skill and knowledge set of the CNL had already been identified and nurses were completing both academic and clinical work without receiving recognition for the advanced competencies being acquired.

The island covers 27.66 km¬≤ in area and has a population of 48 people. Although the island has an airport, there are no regularly scheduled services, and access is normally by ferry to the city of Kagoshima on the mainland. The island is about nine hours by boat from the mainland. The islanders are dependent mainly on agriculture, fishing and seasonal tourism. Geography Suwanosejima is the second largest of the islands in the Tokara archipelago, and is located southwest from Nakanoshima. The highest elevation is , with a height of above sea level, which is the exposed cone of an active stratovolcano arising from the ocean floor. The local climate is classified as subtropical, with a rainy season from May through September. History Suwanosejima has been populated sporadically (depending on volcanic activity), for several thousand years. The island was once part of the Ryukyu Kingdom. During the Edo period, Suwanosejima was part of Satsuma Domain and was administered as part of Kawabe District. It was abandoned after a great 15th century eruption, until it was resettled by people of the Amami Islands in the 19th century.Snyder 1999, pg. 63 After large-scale Plinian eruptions from 1813-1814, which ejected a large amount of scoria and saw lava flows to the west coast, the island was abandoned by its inhabitants again until 1883. Further eruptions occurred in 1877, 1914-1915, 1921, 1922-1925, 1938, 1940, 1949, 1950-1954, 1957-1999, 2001-2002 and 2004-present. One of the most active volcanic islands in the world, Suwanosejima recorded 156 volcanic eruptions in 2008 and 216 in 2009. In 1896, the island was transferred to the administrative control of ≈åshima District, Kagoshima, and from 1911 was administered as part of the village of Toshima, Kagoshima. From 1946-1952, the island was administered by the United States as part of the Provisional Government of Northern Ryukyu Islands. It is the home of Buzoku, also called the Banyan Ashram, a commune founded in the 1960s by Sansei Yamao, Nanao Sakaki, and others, and home for a while to American poet and scholar Gary Snyder.

After he shot Gait√°n three times, mortally wounding him, a mob chased Roa Sierra down and killed him. The assassination of Gaitan triggered El Bogotazo, riots that partially destroyed Bogota and led to La Violencia, a period of violence that lasted until approximately 1958. Background Roa Sierra was the youngest child of Rafael Roa and Encarnaci√≥n Sierra and had 13 siblings. In his book El Crimen del Siglo (\\"The Crime of the Century\\") writer and playwright Miguel Torres reports that Juan Roa Sierra was born in the neighbourhood ‚ÄúEgipto‚Äù (Egypt) in Bogot√°, very near the humble residence where Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n was born. His father was a stonemason and died from a respiratory illness, probably caused by his work. Roa Sierra had had various jobs, primarily like his father as a stonemason. At some point he met a German astrologer named Johan Umland Gert and became a regular client. It is reported that Gert initiated Roa Sierra in Rosicrucianism, a medieval cult that adheres to the belief of reincarnation. Roa Sierra eventually confided in Gert his plans to find treasures in Facatativ√° and Monserrate. Before the events, eight of Roa Sierra's siblings had died and another one had been committed to a mental institution. It is alleged that Roa Sierra's mental health had also deteriorated to the point that he was convinced he was a reincarnation of Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada and of Francisco de Paula Santander. He would even style his hair to resemble those historical figures and stare at his own image in the mirror for hours. Torres also argues in El Crimen del Siglo that evidence shows that Roa Sierra's family were supporters of Gait√°n and that Roa Sierra himself very likely was a pro-Gait√°n activist in the elections of 1946, which would have been the reason the police reportedly found many campaign buttons with the face of the political leader in his house. Roa Sierra's former lover, Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Forero, with whom he had a daughter, was reported by newspaper El Tiempo as saying that he used to listen to Gait√°n's conferences on the radio. Relationship with Gait√°n It is claimed that at the time of the murder Roa Sierra was unemployed, and that people described him as a lazy dreamer and extremely quiet and reserved. He was living in the neighbourhood Ricaurte with his mother, who was his sole financial support. According to the assistant of Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n, Cecilia de Gonz√°lez, Roa Sierra went several times to the office two months before the assassination, but she never gave him an appointment with the lawyer. In El Crimen del Siglo Torres describes Roa Sierra's disappointment in Gait√°n after the latter refused to offer the former a job or any financial help and simply directed him to seek assistance from the government. Several accounts of the events claim that Gait√°n's apparent disregard for Roa Sierra's economic hardship could have triggered the assassination, although Torres himself expresses doubts as to Roa Sierra's authorship of the crime and instead affirms that the alleged murderer was actually coerced by political and possibly foreign forces to eliminate the man who was likely to become the next president. Roa Sierra's last visit to Gert is reported to have taken place on April 7, two days before Gait√°n's assassination. Gert declared that Roa Sierra had had a dream about treasure in two indigenous towns not too far from Bogot√°, and that he felt destiny was going to give him something important. Gert suggested that he not go alone, but Roa Sierra rejected this. On this same date Roa Sierra purchased the weapon and the next day he bought the ammunition. Brothers Luis Enrique and Jos√© Ignacio Rinc√≥n, workmates of Roa Sierra at the time of the events, testified it was from them that he had bought the defective murder weapon for 75 pesos after assuring them he needed it to go treasure-hunting with some foreigners. Two witnesses said they had heard Roa Sierra say he was going to serve as bodyguard for two foreigners who were going on a trip to a desolated land. One foreigner, Rafael del Pino, was known to have been in contact with Roa Sierra ninety minutes before the assassination, according to police reports. Del Pino was traveling with another Cuban, of whom the police also felt \\"well-grounded suspicion\\" over this assassination and who was also observed in the immediate vicinity of the assassination. These two Cubans immediately fled to the Cuban Legation just in time to avoid arrest.. Death The day of the assassination Roa Sierra visited Gait√°n's office at 9:30 AM. Gait√°n had arrived a little before 8 AM even though he had been awake until late because he attended the trial of Lieutenant Jes√∫s Mar√≠a C√≥rtez Poveda, a client of his. The building security guard saw Roa Sierra with another person (later identified as C√©sar Bernal Ord√≥√±ez ) even though he solicited the interview alone. Gait√°n was assassinated minutes after 1:00 PM and later pronounced dead around 2:00 PM. Police corporal Carlos Alberto Jim√©nez D√≠az and Sargeant Galvis Gonz√°lez arrived at the scene as soon as the shots were heard. The news spread quickly and an enraged mob developed in short time yelling \\"mataron al doctor Gait√°n\\" (\\"they killed Dr. Gait√°n\\"). It was reported that Roa Sierra begged to Jim√©nez \\"no me mate, mi cabo\\" (don't kill me, corporal). Jim√©nez is also reported to have taken him hastily to a drugstore to protect him from the incensed crowd. The angry mob grew in front of the drugstore that was sheltering Roa Sierra. Finally the situation was so menacing that the iron shutters of the drugstore were opened. Roa Sierra's body was then kicked and stabbed by the massive mob until he was \\"an almost shapeless corpse\\"; then his body was left in front of the Presidential Palace. Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez reports in his 2002 autobiography Vivir para contarla (\\"Living to Tell The Tale\\") that Encarnaci√≥n Roa first found out about the murder on the radio, and that when she was dyeing her best dress in black to mourn Gait√°n she heard the news that her own son had been the perpetrator, an accusation she reportedly always refused to believe. Other versions of the story According to a translation made by the United States embassy of an article published on April 16, 1948, by the newspaper El Tiempo , Roa was 25 years old at the time of his death. He was baptized in the church of the Egipto neighborhood in Bogot√° and was the youngest of six brothers. He lived for some time in the Ricaurte Neighborhood (also in Bogota) at Calle 17-S No.16-52, and was working as a painter. Roa then began to suffer from schizophrenia and was interned in a clinic in Sibat√©. According to a Scotland Yard report dated July 20, 1948 Roa said he was one of 14 children of the same mother, and that his father had died. He said he had not married, but had had an affair with a married woman named Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Forero with whom he had had a child. Apparently the woman denied Roa's affirmations, and after a psychological chiromancy test in front of a mirror, Roa began to act as if he were the 19th-century Colombian military and political figure Francisco de Paula Santander. Apparently, Roa ended the relationship with the woman years before the assassination. Four months later his mother noticed he had become more quiet and disturbed. Scotland Yard affirmed he was the 13th of the 14 siblings. Scotland Yard also mentioned that Roa admired Gaitan but this admiration may have changed after a commentary made by the candidate. In Vivir para contarla Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez has some issues with the Scotland Yard report with the number of siblings and mentions that in the documents found in Roa's pocket, his address was given as Calle 8 No. 30-73, differing from that given in El Tiempo. Scotland Yard's report also said that Roa had illusions of being mighty, egocentric and was usually spaced out. His behavior might have changed after getting involved with Rosicrucianism, to which he was introduced by a German named Umland Gerat eighteen months before the assassination of Gaitan. Apparently Roa's mother noticed this and went to speak to Gerat about his son's issues and told him her son believed he himself was Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, the founder of Bogot√°. She also mentioned that Roa was at Gaitan's office applying for a job. =The theory that Roa did not assassinate Jorge Eli√©cer Gait√°n= Nathaniel Weyl documents the assassination claims then made by the Colombian General Secretary, Rafael Azula Barrera, and the President of Colombia, Mariano Ospina P√©rez, that Gait√°n was assassinated as part of a Cold War conspiracy led by the USSR to increase Soviet influence in the Caribbean. The violent disruption of the 1948 Inter-American Conference and the violent deaths of a thousand people were alleged also to have been part of a Cold War conspiracy by agents of the USSR, allegedly including the then low-level Soviet agent Fidel Castro. According to police records Castro was suspected of personally assassinating Gait√°n, because his Cuban travelling companion Rafael del Pino was seen with the fascist former mental patient, Juan Roa, an hour and a half before the assassination.Nathaniel Weyl. 1960. Red Star over Cuba. page 13. Castro had attempted to recruit Gait√°n earlier to his cause, but Gait√°n had repeatedly declined and was assassinated because he was too politically influential and would have countered the Cold War objectives of the USSR in the Caribbean.Nathaniel Weyl. 1960. Red Star over Cuba. pages 24-38. Weyl documents the claim by Ospina P√©rez and others that Roa was influenced by others and perhaps did not commit any crime at all. He discusses the questions raised by Milton Bracker of The New York Times and U.S. Ambassador Willard L. Beaulac of whether Roa had acted on his own. Ambassador Beaulac then speculated that Roa was simply used to cover the identity of the real assassins.Willard L. Beaulac, Career Ambassador, Macmillan, New York. 1951. p. 243 Ospina P√©rez and Azula Barrera considered the evidence that the revolver Roa had carried was incapable of accurate fire, that Roa was not thought to have any firearms training, the assassination had been committed at some distance, and that no eyewitness saw Roa anywhere near the assassination, that he was first seen between two policemen. From this evidence the government of Colombia concluded that the impoverished Roa with his diminished mental capacities had been paid to stand near the event with a recently fired revolver.Rafael Azula Barrera, De la revolucion al orden nuevo, Editorial Kelly, Bogota, 1956. pp 372-376.

The island, 7.42 km¬≤ in area, has a population of 59 persons. The island can only be reached by boat as it has no airport; there is a ferry service twice per week to the city of Kagoshima on the mainland. Travel time is about 11 hours. The islanders are dependent mainly on fishing and seasonal tourism. Geography Akusekijima is located southwest of Nakanoshima. The island has an area of approximately with a length of about and a width of .Most of the island is surrounded by steep cliffs. The island is an andesite ‚Äì dacite stratovolcano formed by two summit crater, and . . , the highest elevation on the island, is a lava dome. Lava flows in the northern portion of the island have been dated to 80,000 years ago. There has been no volcanic activity in historic times. Its climate is classified as subtropical, with a rainy season from May through September. History Until 1624, the island was part of the Ryukyu Kingdom. During the Edo period, Takarajima was part of Satsuma Domain and was administered as part of Kawabe District. In 1896, the island was transferred to the administrative control of ≈åshima District, Kagoshima, and from 1911 was part of the village of Toshima, Kagoshima. From 1946-1952, the island was administered by the United States as part of the Provisional Government of Northern Ryukyu Islands. During World War II, on 22 August 1944, Tsushima Maru, a Japanese passenger/cargo ship, was sunk just outside Akusekijima‚Äôs northwest coast by torpedoes launched by the submarine off this island, killing 1,484 civilians including 767 schoolchildren. Annual commemorations are held on the island and there is also a memorial museum. Akusekijima drew attention during the Solar eclipse of July 22, 2009, which was the longest total solar eclipse of the twenty-first century, as the island was one of the closest inhabited areas to the location of maximum eclipse duration. Touted as was one of the best observation spots for the event, village officials and island residents were concerned about playing host to hundreds of people coming to view the solar eclipse. Akusekijima only has five small minshuku guesthouses, which can only accommodate up to 66 people, and water resources are limited as rainfall is the primary source of water. Culture Akusekijima is also famous for the masked god , the island deity. Islanders donning Boze masks come out during the annual lunar O-Bon matsuri. Protectors of the island and its natural assets, the Boze frighten small children to ensure their safety for the coming year. References *National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGIA).

He is a co-inventor of the cordance method for studying regional brain activity with electroencephalograms. Research by Cook and his colleagues has shown that past use of antidepressants can influence the brain's reaction to antidepressant placebos, that standard advice on diet and exercise for heart health can also lead to better brain health, that different types of advertisement evoke different types of brain activity, that electroencephalogram measurements could predict the outcome of antidepressant drug treatment on an individual patient long before the drugs make any observable changes to the patient's moods, and that electrical stimulation of the trigeminal nerve can be an effective alternative to drug therapy for depression.

Kessler's parents married in Paris on 10 August 1867; Kessler was born, also in Paris, in 1868. Kessler's younger sister was born in 1877, and was named Wilhelmina after Kaiser Wilhelm I, who became the child's godfather. After marriage, her name would become Wilma de Brion. There were many rumours about a supposed affair between Kaiser Wilhelm I and Countess Kessler. The swift rise of the Kessler family led to a legend that either Harry or his sister were the illegitimate offspring of the emperor and Alice Kessler, but Harry was born two years before his mother met the emperor, and the emperor was eighty years old when his sister Wilhelmina was born. Curiously, Alice Blosse-Lynch is recorded as having died unmarried in 1919 in Burke's Irish Family Records (1976). Adolf Wilhelm Kessler was ennobled in 1879 and again in 1881, Harry inheriting the titles on his father's death. Life and work Kessler grew up in France, England and Germany. Kessler was educated first in Paris and then, from 1880, in St. George's School, Ascot, an English boarding school. Following his father's wishes he enrolled in 1882 at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums in Hamburg, where he completed his Abitur (high-school education). Afterwards he joined the 3rd Garde-Ulanen regiment in Potsdam and earned the rank of an army officer. He studied law and art history in Bonn and Leipzig respectively. Kessler was familiar with many cultures, travelled widely, was active as a German diplomat, and came to be known as a man of the world and patron of the arts. He considered himself part of European society. His homosexuality, which inevitably made him a psychological outsider, undoubtedly influenced his insight and critique of Wilhelmian culture.Easton, Laird M. The Red Count: The Life and Times of Harry Kessler,University of California Press, 2002, p31 After moving to Berlin in 1893, he worked on the Art Nouveau journal PAN, which published literary work by, among others, Richard Dehmel, Theodor Fontane, Friedrich Nietzsche, Detlev von Liliencron, Julius Hart, Novalis, Paul Verlaine and Alfred Lichtwark. The short-lived journal also published graphic works by numerous artists including Henry van de Velde, Max Liebermann, Otto Eckmann and Ludwig von Hofmann. On 24 March 1903 Kessler assumed control of the \\"Museum f√ºr Kunst und Kunstgewerbe\\" in Weimar. There he worked with new exhibition concepts and the establishment of a permanent arts and crafts exhibit. In 1904, during his work in Weimar, Kessler began to publish a group of bibliophilic books containing artistic compositions of typography and illustrations. In the beginning he cooperated with the German Insel Verlag. In 1913 he founded his own company, the Cranach Press, of which he became the director. Around 1909, Kessler developed a concept for a comic opera together with Hugo von Hofmannsthal and together they wrote the scenario. Richard Strauss provided the music, and in 1911 Der Rosenkavalier premiered in Dresden under the baton of Ernst von Schuch. Around 1913 Kessler commissioned Edward Gordon Craig, an English theatrical designer and theoretician, to make woodcut illustrations for a sumptuous edition of Shakespeare's Hamlet for the Cranach Press. A German translation by Gerhart Hauptmann, with illustrations by Craig, was finally published in Weimar in 1928. The English version, edited by J. Dover Wilson, came out in 1930. This book, printed on fine paper, using different type-faces, with marginal notes with source quotations, and featuring Craig's woodcuts, is regarded by many as one of the finest examples of the printer's art to have been published in the 20th century.Price, Thomas, \\"Edward Gordon Craig and the Theatre of the Imagination\\", Stanford University Libraries Digital Image Collections, 1985. It is still sought by collectors worldwide. Kessler's ideas of reforming culture went beyond the visual arts. He developed a reformation concept for the theatre which was supported by Edward Gordon Craig, Max Reinhardt and Karl Vollm√∂ller. Kessler asserted that a so-called \\"Mustertheater\\" should be established. The Belgian architect Henry van de Velde sought to design the corresponding building. On the initiative of Kessler many prominent writers were invited to introduce a literary modernity to Weimar, but the hegemonic opinions were considered too conservative and nationalistic, and the plans for the Mustertheater failed. During his Weimar period Kessler became close friends with Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche (1846‚Äì1935), the sister of late Friedrich Nietzsche. At the suggestion of Kessler, she chose Weimar as domicile for the Nietzsche-Archiv. In 1903 Kessler launched the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund and became its vice-president. The consortium supported less acknowledged artists including Edvard Munch, Johannes R. Becher, Detlev von Liliencron and the painters of Die Br√ºcke. In 1906, an exhibition commotion gave reason to depose Kessler from his office. An exhibition of drawings at the Grand Ducal Museum by Rodin and dedicated, in error, to the Grand Duke of Sax Thuringia, was considered as a risk to the wives and daughters of Weimar. This was followed by a smear campaign that Kessler considered to be an intrigue by Aim√© Charles Vincent von Palezieux,Vita retired Prussian General and court Marshall in Weimar, but which led to Kessler's resignation. Palezieux died less than a year later on 10 February 1907 just before receipt of a challenge to a duel from Kessler. Later years Kessler saw active service on the Western Front during World War I. In 1918 he returned to his estate in Weimar, recording that although the house seemed unchanged from 1913 and his old servants and pets greeted him with affection, his collections of paintings, statues, books and mementos reflected a European intellectual and cultural community which was now \\"dead, missing, scattered .. or become enemies\\". During World War I Kessler and Karl Gustav Vollmoeller worked together at the German Embassy in Bern for the cultural department of the Foreign Office. They developed activities aimed at peace plans with France and England. In November 1918, Kessler was German Ambassador to Warsaw in the newly independent Poland (Second Polish Republic). In 1919 he wrote a \\"plan for a League of Nations on the basis of an organization of organizations (World Organisation)\\", which contains the constitution of such an international confederation of states. The purpose of this covenant was above all to prevent new wars, securing human rights and the regulation of world trade. Main body of this covenant would be the \\"World Council\\", which also elected an executive committee. Under his plan a Weltjustizhof, a World Court of Arbitration and administrative authorities would be built. This ordered by paragraphs plan had the form of a state constitution. Another plan for a supranational organisation he developed in 1920 as \\"Guidelines for a true League of Nations\\" in the form of a resolution. In 1922 he served for a short time as the President of the German Peace Society, of which he was a member from 1919 to 1929. In the 1920s, Kessler as a journalist tried to influence the political debates of the Weimar Republic. He wrote essays on different social and foreign policy issues, such as socialism, or the League of Nations. He belonged to the left-liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) and wrote a biography of his 1922 murdered friend Walther Rathenau (then Foreign minister). In 1924, he was a DDP candidate for the Reichstag. When this attempt failed, he withdrew from politics. In the twenties, Kessler was frequently a guest at the Berlin SeSiSo Club. In 1932/33, material co-edited by him appeared in the magazine Das Freie Wort (The Free Word). After the Nazis' seizure of power in 1933 Kessler resigned and emigrated to Paris, then to Mallorca and finally to the southern French provinces. He died in 1937 in Lyon. It was presumed that Kessler's earlier diaries had been lost but they were found in 1983 in a safe in Mallorca. In 2004, the first definitive nine volume edition was published in Germany and the first English edition of the 1880‚Äì1918 years was published in 2011.

The standby generator begins supplying power to the circuits. After utility power returns, the automatic transfer switch transfers the electrical load back to the utility and signals the standby generator to shut off. It then returns to standby mode where it awaits the next outage. To ensure a proper response to an outage, a standby generator runs weekly self-tests. Most units run on diesel, natural gas, or liquid propane gas. Automatic standby generator systems may be required by building codes for critical safety systems such as elevators in high-rise buildings, fire protection systems, standby lighting, or medical and life support equipment. Residential standby generators are increasingly common, providing backup electrical power to HVAC systems, security systems, and household appliances such as refrigerators, stoves, and water heaters.

Ersatz-Division) was a unit of the German Army in World War I.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army as, during the period of German unification (1866-1871), the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies. Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous and came under Prussian control only during wartime. W√ºrttemberg forces were only semi- autonomous. The division was formed on mobilization of the German Army in August 1914.8. Ersatz-Division (Chronik 1914/1917) The division was a composite division, formed from 14 brigade replacement battalions (Brigade- Ersatz-Bataillone) from the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Rhine Province, the Province of Hesse-Nassau and the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine. It became more W√ºrttemberg as the war progressed; and, in February 1917, it was officially designated a Royal W√ºrttemberg division. It was redesignated the 243rd Infantry Division in April 1917. Formation The division was formed on mobilization with 14 brigade replacement battalions. Each brigade replacement battalion was numbered after its parent infantry brigade, and was formed with two companies taken from the replacement battalion of each of the brigade's two infantry regiments. In two cases, a brigade replacement battalion drew from three regiments. Thus, collectively, the 12 brigade replacement battalions represented troop contributions from 30 different infantry regiments. Four brigade replacement battalions were from the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg; two were from the Grand Duchy of Hesse; four were from the Prussian Rhine Province; two were from the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau (one with troops from the former Duchy of Nassau, the other from the former Electorate of Hesse); and two from the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine. The infantry units were augmented with cavalry, artillery and combat engineers, also drawn from Ersatz formations.Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935); Hartwig Busche, Formationsgeschichte der deutschen Infanterie im Weltkrieg 1914/1918 (1998). Combat chronicle The division initially fought in the Battle of the Frontiers in 1914, including the battle before Nancy-Epinal. From September 1914 to October 1916, it was in the trenchlines and fought in the region between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers, especially in an area known as the Priest's Forest (German: Priesterwald, French: Bois Le Pr√™tre). In October 1916, it entered the Battle of the Somme. Afterwards, it returned to the Priesterwald, where it was converted into the 243rd Infantry Division. Allied intelligence rated the division's elements as good.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 741-743.

The 8th Ersatz Division was reorganized and triangularized in July 1915, losing its two non-W√ºrttemberg Ersatz brigades. The brigade replacement battalions were consolidated and converted into infantry regiments. Over the course of the war, units were exchanged with other divisions, cavalry was reduced, engineers increased, and an artillery command and a divisional signals command were created.

Riccards (born October 2, 1944 in Elizabeth, New Jersey) is an American political scientist, writer, administrator, and professor. Riccards has been the president of three American colleges and has written extensively on public policy, the American political process, the papacy as a leadership problem, and the history of the American presidency. His book The Ferocious Engine of Democracy was praised by Bill Clinton.Publisher's synopsis: \\"I very much enjoyed reading The Ferocious Engine of Democracy, and I'm grateful to know of Riccards' perspective on the presidency.--Bill Clinton\\" He was the founding executive director of the Hall Institute of Public Policy ‚Äì New Jersey. He now is president of the American Public Policy Institute on YouTube. Riccards grew up in New Jersey and received his bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. in political science from Rutgers University; he finished his formal studies in 1970. He was one of the youngest Ph.D.s in the university's longest history. Riccards was named a Fulbright Fellow to Japan in 1973 and a Henry Huntington Fellow in California in 1974. In 1975, he joined Princeton University as a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellow in religion. His main interests were political socialization and political behavior; he used stage theory in his research to learn how children get their political and later religious values. From that work, he authored the monograph, The Making of the American Citizenry (1973) and an article in the bilingual Belgian journal, Lumen Vitae. In 1976, at the age of 32, he was named the dean of the merged college of Arts and Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Boston. As an administrator, he increased the numbers of minority students in the arts and sciences, and helped create a minority pre-med program. Riccards created the first Ph.D. at UMB in biological sciences; UMass Boston now has 34 doctorates. Five years later, he became provost and academic vice president at Hunter College of the City University of New York. Riccards worked to re- establish sabbaticals for faculty, which had been abolished systemwide during the 1970s. He revamped the school-deaconal structure, and created the college's first doctoral programs. He also taught political science for three years. Riccards became president of St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1986. He worked to build a new library for the school, and served on the New Mexico Council for Humanities and the New Mexico Educational Assistance Program. He increased the number of Black, Hispanic, and Native American students there. In 1989, he left for the presidency of Shepherd College (now Shepherd University), a liberal arts college in the eastern panhandle of West Virginia. Riccards secured funding for a new science and technology building and planned the Senator Robert C. Byrd Center as part of a renovation of the library. Riccards also was appointed by the U.S. Senate to serve on the National Skill Standards Board. His other accomplishments during his tenure there included the creation of the Contemporary American Theater Festival, the Center for the Study of the Civil War, and the establishment of a community college which went on to become the Blue Ridge Community and Technical College in Martinsburg, WV. In 1995, Riccards became president of Fitchburg State College (now Fitchburg State University) in Massachusetts, which had difficulties with low academic standards and low dormitory occupancy rates. He raised academic standards in the school's much-criticized teacher education program and started a leadership program for students, including classes in leadership. Riccards convinced then-Governor William Weld to support construction of a new physical education building and committed it to community use. He also backed a new science complex to help re-develop the city of Fitchburg. The college named its baseball field for Riccards in 2007. After leaving Fitchburg State in 2002, Riccards became the first College Board Public Policy Scholar in Residence in Washington, D. C., and was the College Board's representative to both the National Governors Association and the National State Legislatures Association. He backed the creation of an Advanced Placement course to celebrate the anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education; the course was put on the Board‚Äôs website. Riccards also visited the assistant superintendent of the District of Columbia Public Schools to advocate Board programs aimed at high school predation; prior to Riccards' visit, the College Board had little patience and no success with the school bureaucracy. By 2020, 3,000 students were taking AP courses in the DC public schools. Riccards wrote a history of the College Board, and successfully lobbied Congress to increase its Advanced Placement subsidy to $25 million. Riccards' efforts with Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs to help veterans enroll in CLEP courses were also successful. After three years at the College Board, Riccards moved back to his native New Jersey and became the founding executive director of the Hall Institute of Public Policy - New Jersey in Trenton. At the Hall Institute, he worked on creating a website, Hallnj.org, established a television forum, a radio show, and published four volumes of essays from the website. He was named the New Jersey representative on the national Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and headed up the state commission. He published a volume of his collected plays, and one of them on Lincoln became a musical produced by Genevieve Fraser on behalf of the Drama Circle in Massachusetts (2012). He has written four volumes of fiction on Italian American life, later compressed into The Ordinary Duties of the Day and Growing Up Jersey, generally set in his hometown of Madison, NJ. He is also the author of books on papal leadership. One of his books on the early presidency was cited in an opinion by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Riccards was on the board of the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress for five years. In 2019, he co-authored Woodrow Wilson as Commander in Chief: The Presidency and the Great War. He currently is co- writing Party Politics in the Age of FDR: Making America a Global Power. He is married and has three children and five grandchildren. His wife Barbara was a master English teacher in urban and rural high schools. His youngest daughter, Abigail, is a professional jazz singer in Chicago and his daughter Catherine was a corporate lawyer for Saks Fifth Avenue and is now with Barnes & Noble. His son, Patrick, is an education reform advocate and CEO of the Driving Force Institute, having formerly served as an aide to three U.S. senators and one U.S. representative. Dr. Riccards has won the Luigi Pirandello Award and is the recipient of an Honorary Doctor of Medicine from Tie-in University. He lives in Hamilton, NJ.

The events are named for the popular effort of building and protecting barricades from 13 January until about 27 January. Latvia, which had declared restoration of independence from the Soviet Union a year earlier, anticipated that the Soviet Union might attempt to regain control over the country by force. After attacks by the Soviet OMON on Riga in early January, the government called on people to build barricades for protection of possible targets (mainly in the capital city of Riga and nearby Ulbroka, as well as Kuldƒ´ga and LiepƒÅja). Six people were killed in further attacks, several were wounded in shootings or beaten by OMON. Most victims were shot during the Soviet attack on the Latvian Ministry of the Interior on January 20, while another person died in a building accident reinforcing the barricades. The exact number of casualties among the Soviet loyalists is unknown. Around 32,000 people have received Commemorative Medal for Participants of the Barricades of 1991 for the participation or support for the event.  Background  During World War II Latvia had been occupied by USSR. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev introduced glasnost and perestroika policies, hoping to salvage the failing Soviet economy. The reforms also lessened restrictions on political freedom in the Soviet Union. This led to unintended consequences as problems within the Soviet Union and crimes of the Soviet regime, previously kept secret and denied by the government, were exposed, causing public dissatisfaction, further deepened by the war in Afghanistan and the Chernobyl disaster. Another unintended consequence of Glasnost for the Soviet central authorities was the long-suppressed nationalist sentiments that were released in the republics of the Soviet Union. Massive demonstrations against the Soviet regime began. In Latvia an independence movement started. The supporters of independence - the Popular Front of Latvia, the Latvian Green Party and the Latvian National Independence Movement - won elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR, on 18 March 1990 and formed the Popular Front of Latvia faction, leaving the pro-Soviet Equal Rights faction in opposition. On 4 May 1990, the Supreme Soviet, which afterwards became known as the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia, declared the restoration of independence of Latvia and began secession from the Soviet Union. The USSR did not recognize these actions and considered them contrary to the Soviet federal and republican constitutions. Consequently, the tension in relations between Latvia and the Soviet Union and between the independence movement and pro- Soviet forces, such as the International Front of the Working People of Latvia (Interfront) and the Communist Party of Latvia, along with its All-Latvian Public Rescue Committee, grew. Soviet military crackdown threat The pro- Soviet forces tried to provoke violence and seize power in Latvia. A series of bombings occurred in December 1990, Marshal of the Soviet Union Dmitry Yazov admitted that the military was responsible for the first four bombings, perpetrators of the other bombings remain unknown, the pro-Communist press of the time blamed Latvian nationalists. The government of the Soviet Union and other pro-Soviet groups threatened that a state of emergency would be established which would grant unlimited authority in Latvia to President Gorbachev and military force would be used to \\"implement order in the Baltic Republics\\". At the time Soviet troops, OMON units and KGB forces were stationed in Latvia. On 23 December 1990 a large combat group of KGB was exposed in J≈´rmala. It was rumored at the time that there would be a coup and a dictatorship would be established. Foreign minister of the Soviet Union Eduard Shevardnadze seemingly confirmed this when he resigned on 20 December 1990, stating that a dictatorship was coming. On 11 December 1990, the Popular Front released an announcement stating that there was no need for a climate of fear and hysteria in what was dubbed hour X - the unlimited authority of the president - would come and every person should be ready to consider what they would do if that happened. The Popular Front also made suggestions regarding what should be done until the hour X and afterwards, if Soviet forces were successful. These plans called for acts to show support for independence and attract the attention of international society, joining volunteer guard units, reasoning with Russians in Latvia explaining to them, especially military officers, that the ideas of the Popular Front are similar to those of Russian democrats. It also called for an effort to protect the economy and ensure information circulation should also be made. In case of Soviet control being successfully established, this plan called for a campaign of civil disobedience - ignoring any orders and requests of the Soviet authorities, as well as any Soviet elections and referendums, undermining the Soviet economy by going on strike and by following the absurdly elaborate Soviet manufacturing instructions to the letter in order to paralyze production, helping the independence movement to continue its work illegally and helping its supporters to get involved in the work of the Soviet institutions. Finally, carefully documenting any crimes Soviet forces might commit during the state of emergency. Attacks in early January  Some of the journalists who covered the Barricades (in 2013) On 2 January 1991 the OMON seized the Preses Nams (), the national printing house of Latvia and attacked Criminal police officers who were documenting the event. The Supreme council held a session in which it was reported that the manager of the Preses Nams was being held hostage, while other workers, although physically and verbally abused, were apparently allowed to leave the printing house. The Supreme council officially recognized the taking of the printing house as an illegal act on the part of the Communist Party of Latvia. The Popular front organised protests at the Communist party building. The printing house was partly paralysed as it continued to print only pro-Soviet press. On 4 January the OMON seized the telephone exchange in Vecmƒ´lgrƒÅvis, it is speculated that it was because the telephone lines the OMON were using were cut off. Thereafter, the OMON seized the Ministry of Internal Affairs but the phone wasn't cut off for fear that the OMON would attack the international telephone exchange. Contrary to OMON officer claims Boris Karlovich Pugo and Mikhail Gorbachev both claimed they were not informed of this attack. Meanwhile, the Soviet military was on the move - that same day an intelligence unit arrived in Riga. Then on 7 January, following the orders of Mikhail Gorbachev, Dmitriy Yazov sent commando units into several Republics of the Soviet Union including Latvia. On 11 January, the Military Council of the Baltic Military District was held. It decided to arm Soviet officers and cadets with machine guns. Open movement of Soviet troops and armored vehicles were seen in the streets of Riga. Several meetings by both pro-independence and pro-Soviet movements were held on 10 January. Interfront held a meeting calling on the government of Latvia to resign. Some 50,000 people participated and tried to break into the Cabinet of Ministers building after being asked to do so by military personnel. Construction of the Barricades The memorial marking the spot where Andris Slapi≈Ü≈°, a cameraman, was killed during the attack on the Latvian Interior Ministry on 20 January. On 11 January, the Soviet military launched an attack on Latvia's neighbour, Lithuania. On 12 January, the Popular Front announced nationwide demonstrations to be held on 13 January in support of Latvia's lawfully elected government and the guarding of strategic objectives. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR called on the Soviet government to withdraw its military forces from the Baltic States. Leaders of the Latvian government met with Gorbachev who gave assurances that force would not be used. That night the Popular Front, after learning that Soviet forces in Lithuania had attacked the Vilnius TV Tower and killed 13 civilians, called on people to gather for the defense of strategic objectives. Due to a united effort of the Baltic states to regain their independence in the previous years of the singing revolution, an attack on one of them was perceived as an attack on all of them. At 4:45 on 13 January, an announcement from the Popular Front was broadcast by Latvian radio calling people to gather in Riga Cathedral square. At 12:00 noon the Supreme Council session on defense issues was held. At 14.00 the Popular Front's demonstration began, around 700,000 people had gathered, Soviet helicopters dropped leaflets with warnings over the crowd at this point. The Popular Front called on people to build barricades. The Supreme council held another session after the demonstration, the Members of Parliament (MPs) were asked to stay at the Supreme council overnight. The evening session issued a call for Soviet soldiers asking them to disobey orders concerning the use of force against civilians. As night came, following orders from the government, agricultural and construction machines and trucks full of logs arrived in Riga to build barricades. Trucks, engineering vehicles and agricultural machinery were brought into the city to block streets. People had already been gathering during the day. Part of this crowd gathered in Riga Cathedral Square as the Popular Front had asked in its morning announcement. Others gathered after the midday demonstration. They included colleagues and students. Some were organised by their employers and alma maters. Many families arrived, including women, the elderly and children. By that time most were already morally prepared that something could happen. People had arrived from all over the country. Barricades were largely perceived as a form of nonviolent resistance, people being ready to form a human shield. However, many people did arm themselves, using whatever was available, ranging from pieces of metal to specially crafted shields and civil defence supplies. Some had also prepared Molotov cocktails, but these were confiscated to ensure fire safety. The Latvian militia was armed with sub-machine guns and handguns. The Latvian government was later criticized for not providing weapons. These they had, as was evidenced after the OMON seized the Ministry of Interior and removed a considerable number of weapons (it was asserted that there were 200 firearms in the ministry) Trucks were loaded with construction and demolition waste, logs and other cargo. Large concrete blocks, walls, wire obstacles and other materials were also used. The building work began on the evening of 13 January and took about three hours. The main objects of strategic interest were the Supreme Council buildings (Old town near St. James's Cathedral), the Council of Ministers (City center near the Nativity of Christ Cathedral), Latvian Television (on Zaƒ∑usala), Latvian Radio (Old town near Riga Cathedral), the International Telephone exchange offices (City center), Ulbroka radio and bridges. Barricades were also built in other parts of the country, including in LiepƒÅja and Kuldƒ´ga. Barricade in Jƒìkaba Street, July 1991 Care was taken to record the events, not only for accounting purposes and personal keepsakes but also to show the world what was happening. About 300 foreign journalists worked in Riga at the time. The Latvian government ensured that the foreign press was provided with constant updates. Many strategic objects were important mainly for the transfer of information. This would ensure that if the Soviets did launch an attack, the Latvian forces could hold these locations long enough to inform the rest of the world. The international telephone exchange was important to maintain connections with both foreign countries and other parts of the USSR. An often noted example is Lithuania. It was partly cut off from the rest of the world after the Soviet attack. Foreign calls to Lithuania were transferred through Riga. Latvian radio and television worked day and night to broadcast throughout the time of the barricades. The radio played an important part in life on the barricades. It was used to organize eating and sleeping arrangements, calling people together (e.g. students from the same university), for the various meetings. Artists were invited to entertain people. Foresters were asked to provide firewood for the bonfires that were widely used by the people manning the barricades. Food and drink were provided by a number of public institutions. Many well-wishers provided knit socks and gloves as well as refreshments. Places to sleep were often hard to find - schools were used where possible. Many people either slept at the barricades or went home. Some people experienced an exacerbation of their health problems which was not helped by the winter climate, exhaustion and stress. First Aid points were set up with additional medical supplies and equipment, some were based on existing locations. Beds were installed in a number and had teams composed of doctors from local hospitals. Shifts were formed by daily routine - people who went to their job, studies or home were replaced by people who returned to the barricades after their daily duties. Most workers who had been on the barricades later received their usual salary regardless of if they had or had not been to work. Prime minister Ivars Godmanis regularly held meetings with commanders of individual barricades, the Popular Front also participated to discuss tactics. It was decided to enforce protection of the most important objectives by assigning militia to their defense. The supplies for the barricades were coordinated by the Popular Front. The individual barricades were organised by regions. Thus, people from Vidzeme were assigned to barricades overseen by the Vidzeme suburb chapter of the Popular Front. The pro-Soviet forces tried to infiltrate barricades for sabotage. Rumors were spread that attacks were planned.  Fighting  On 14 January, the Commander of the Soviet army in the Baltic Military District Fyodor Kuzmin issued an ultimatum against the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia chairman Anatolijs Gorbunovs, demanding that the adopted laws are repealed. The OMON attacked Brasa and VecmilgrƒÅvis bridges. 17 cars were burned during the day. On the night of 15 January, the OMON twice attacked the Riga branch of the Minsk Militia Academy. Later that day 10,000 people gathered for an Interfront meeting, where an All-Latvian Public Rescue Committee declared that it was taking over power in Latvia. This announcement was broadcast in the Soviet media. On 16 January, the supreme council organised MPs to stay overnight at the supreme council building to ensure a quorum in case of need. At 4:45 pm, in another attack on VecmilgrƒÅvis bridge, a driver for the Latvian Ministry of Transport, Roberts M≈´rnieks was shot in the back of the head with an army battle automatic weapon and died from the injury at the Riga Hospital No. 1 intensive care unit at 6:50 pm, becoming the first fatality at the barricades. Two other people were also injured. At 6:30 pm the OMON attacked Brasa bridge, injuring one person. Another bombing took place at 8:45 pm. On 17 January, the alarm was sounded at the Barricades, the strike committee of the Communist Party of Latvia declared that fascism was being reborn in Latvia. A delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR visited Riga. Upon its return to Moscow, the delegation reported that Latvia was in favour of the establishment of unlimited authority of the USSR president. On 18 January the Supreme Soviet decided to form a national self-defense committee. The Popular Front withdrew its call to protect the barricades. Roberts M≈´rnieks' funeral On 19 January, the funeral of Roberts M≈´rnieks turned into a demonstration. That night the OMON arrested and beat up five members of a volunteer guard unit. On 20 January, about 100,000 people gathered in Moscow to show their support for the Baltic states, calling on Soviet officials to resign in connection with the events in Vilnius. That evening turned out to be the deadliest at the Barricades after the OMON and other unidentified combat groups attacked the Latvian Interior Ministry. Two policemen (Vladimirs Gomanoviƒçs and Sergejs Kono≈Üenko), camera operator and director Andris Slapi≈Ü≈° and 17-year-old schoolboy Edijs Rieksti≈Ü≈° are killed. Gvido Zvaigzne was fatally injured and died of his injuries on 5 February. Four Bauska policemen were injured, as were five participants of the barricades, a Hungarian J√°nos T√≥dor, Finnish journalist and TV operator Hannu V√§is√§nen and Russian camera operator for the TV program Vzglyad Vladimir Brezhnev. It was noted that the attackers also suffered casualties. After the battle, the OMON moved into the Latvian communist party building. By the 20 January, the government also urged the transfer of control of the barricades to government forces. This was seen by some as disaffection with the whole idea. This opinion was enforced when part of the barricades were demolished after the government took control of them. On 21 January, the Supreme council called on youths to apply for a job in the Interior ministry system. Gorbunovs left for Moscow to meet with Gorbachev to discuss the situation in Latvia. On 22 January, Pugo denied he had ordered an attack on the interior ministry. Another person was killed on the barricades. On 24 January, the Council of ministers established a public safety department to guard the barricades. On 25 January, after the funeral of the 20 January victims, defenders of the barricades left.  Aftermath and further developments The actual barricades remained on the streets of Riga for a long time; for example, those at the Supreme Council were removed only in the autumn of 1992. In March partially in response to January events and partially because of upcoming Soviet referendum on preservation of federation, which Latvia intended to boycott, a poll on independence was held with 3/4 of participants voting in favor of independence. Latvia faced further attacks of Pro-Soviet forces later in 1991 - on 23 May, when OMON launched attack on five Latvian border posts and during the Soviet coup attempt of 1991, when several strategic objectives guarded during the barricades were seized, with one civilian (driver Raimonds Salmi≈Ü≈°) killed by Soviet forces. The attempted coup prompted the Latvian government, which originally had intended gradual secession from the Soviet Union to declare full independence, which was recognized by the Soviet Union on 6 September. The Soviet Union was dissolved in December 1991.  Responsibility  Major attacks were carried out by the OMON of Riga, however, another combat unit was seen during the attack on the Ministry of Interior Affairs. It has been speculated that this unit was Alpha Group which had been seen in action during the attack on Vilnius. In an interview with film director Juris Podnieks, an OMON officer stated that originally it was planned to attack Riga, not Vilnius. At the last moment, a week before the attack on Vilnius, the plan was suddenly changed. He also claimed that the OMON of Rƒ´ga was so well prepared that there was no need for the Soviet military, which was present in Rƒ´ga at the time, to engage. The OMON did not act on their own - after the Preses Nams was seized the OMON claimed that high officials of the Soviet government - Boris Pugo and Mikhail Gorbachev knew about the attack, however, both denied their involvement and the Supreme Council blamed the Communist Party of Latvia. In December before the events, the Popular Front, in its instructions for X hour, asserted that a coup was planned by the \\"Soyuz\\" group of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR MPs. Dimitry Yuzhkov admitted that the Soviet military was responsible for the first bombings, however, no one claimed responsibility for the rest of the bombings, which the communist press blamed on Latvian nationalists. On the basis of these and subsequent events, several OMON officers were tried, although many of them were not convicted, the Communist Party of Latvia, Interfront, the All-Latvian Public Rescue Committee and a few related organizations were banned by parliament for the attempted coup d'√©tat, and two leaders of CPL and ALPRC were tried for treason. On 9 November 1999, the Riga District Court found ten former Riga OMON officers guilty for their involvement in the attacks.1999 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - Latvia US Department of State. 23 February 2000. Retrieved 2013-06-13. Viktor Alksnis transplanted a large number of the Baltic OMON forces to the Transnistrian territory of Moldova in support of the separatist regime there, where Vladimir Antyufeyev, commander of the Riga OMON forces, took on the role of Minister of Security initially under an assumed name (Vladimir Shevstov), a post he held until 2012. Antyufeyev appeared in Ukraine as the \\"deputy prime minister\\" of the Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic in July 2014.\\"The End of the Russian Fairy Tale\\" Anne Applebaum; Slate, July 18, 2014  Nonviolent resistance  The Barricades was a nonviolent resistance movement as the participants were publicly encouraged not to carry any weapons despite the Soviet Union taking brutal measures against protesters. The Popular Front of Latvia developed a plan, called ‚ÄúInstructions for X-hour‚Äù, which was published in the press in December 1990. It set out what actions should be taken by the general public in case of an act of aggression and hostility from the Soviet Union. It stated that all protest must be nonviolent and everything must be documented with photos and videos so there would be evidence to counter possible Kremlin propaganda. Notwithstanding Mikhail Gorbachev's promises not to use violent methods to change power in the Baltic states, the USSR army and the interior structures attacked local authorities and strategic sites in Lithuania and Latvia in January 1991 killing officers and civilians.  Legacy  Valdis Dombrovskis (right) and Algirdas Butkeviƒçius, prime ministers of Latvia and Lithuania, remembering those killed at the Barricades (20 January 2013) In 1995, a support fund for 'Participants of the Barricades of 1991' was created. The fund is for the families of victims. It also gathers information on participants. In 2001 the fund created the 'Museum of the Barricades of 1991' to make historical materials it had gathered available to the public. 20 January is the commemoration day of Participants of the Barricades, on this day as well as on 18 November, 4 May and 21 August. Participants of the barricades are awarded the Commemorative Medal for Participants of the Barricades of 1991. This award was established by the fund of 'Participants of the Barricades of 1991' in 1996. Since 1999 it is awarded by the state for those who had shown courage and unselfishness during the Barricades. The Barricades are also commemorated by numerous monuments in Latvia.

It was an adaptation of a 1933 Broadway musical Roberta, which in turn was based on the novel Gowns by Roberta by Alice Duer Miller. It was a solid hit, showing a net profit of more than three-quarters of a million dollars. The film kept the famous songs \\"Yesterdays\\", \\"Let's Begin\\" (with altered lyrics), and \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" from the play, along with a fourth song, \\"I'll Be Hard to Handle\\". Three songs from the play were dropped‚Äî\\"The Touch of Your Hand\\", \\"Something Had to Happen\\" and \\"You're Devastating\\". Two songs were added to this film, \\"I Won't Dance\\" (resurrected from the flop Kern show Three Sisters) and \\"Lovely to Look At\\", which both became #1 hits in 1935. The latter addition was nominated for the Best Song Oscar. The songs \\"I Won't Dance\\" and \\"Lovely to Look At\\" have remained so popular that they are now almost always included in revivals and recordings of Roberta. Roberta is the third Astaire-Rogers film, and the only one to be remade with other actors. MGM did so in 1952, entitling the new Technicolor version Lovely to Look At. Indeed, with an eye to a remake, MGM bought Roberta in 1945, keeping it out of general circulation until the 1970s. Plot John Kent (Randolph Scott), a former star football player at Harvard, goes to Paris with his friend Huck Haines (Fred Astaire) and the latter's dance band, the Wabash Indianians. Alexander Voyda (Luis Alberni) has booked the band, but refuses to let them play when he finds the musicians are not the Indians he expected, but merely from Indiana (Huck Haines and his Indianians Band). John turns to the only person he knows in Paris for help, his Aunt Minnie (Helen Westley), who owns the fashionable \\"Roberta\\" gown shop. While there, he meets her chief assistant (and secretly the head designer), Stephanie (Irene Dunne). John is quickly smitten with her. Meanwhile, Huck unexpectedly stumbles upon someone he knows very well. \\"Countess Scharwenka\\", a temperamental customer at Roberta's, turns out to be his hometown sweetheart Lizzie Gatz (Ginger Rogers). She gets Huck's band an engagement at the nightclub where she is a featured entertainer, and Huck agrees to keep her true identity a secret. Two things trouble John. One is Ladislaw (Victor Varconi), the handsome Russian deposed prince and doorman who seems too interested in Stephanie. The other is the memory of Sophie (Claire Dodd), the snobbish, conceited girlfriend he left behind after a quarrel over his lack of sophistication and polish. When Aunt Minnie dies unexpectedly without leaving a will, John inherits the shop. Knowing nothing about women's fashion and aware that his aunt intended for Stephanie to inherit the business, he persuades Stephanie to remain as his partner. Correspondents flock to hear what a football player has to say about feminine fashions. Huck gives the answers, making a lot of weird statements about the innovations John is planning to introduce. Sophie arrives in Paris, attracted by John's good fortune. She enters the shop, looking for a dress, but is dissatisfied with everything Stephanie shows her. Huck persuades her to choose a gown that John had ordered to be discarded as too vulgar. When John sees her in it, they quarrel for the final time. John reproaches Stephanie for selling Sophie the gown. Terribly hurt, Stephanie quits the shop. With Roberta's putting on a fashion show in a week, Huck takes over the design work, with predictably bad results. When Stephanie sees his awful creations, she is persuaded to return to save Roberta's reputation. The show is a triumph, helped by the entertainment provided by Huck, Countess Scharwenka, and the band. (A pre- stardom Lucille Ball, with platinum blond hair, appears uncredited in her first RKO film as a model wearing an elaborate feather cape, after the vocal by Dunne, in the fashion show.Roberta cast at Internet Movie Database) The closing sensation is a gown modeled by Stephanie herself. At the show, John overhears that she and Ladislaw are leaving Paris and mistakenly assumes that they have married. Later, he congratulates her for becoming a princess. When she informs him that Ladislaw is merely her cousin and that the title has been hers since birth, the lovers are reunited. Huck and Lizzie, who decide to get married, do a final tap dance sequel.

The Chalon Head is the name of a number of postage stamp series whose illustration was inspired by a portrait of Queen Victoria by Alfred Edward Chalon (1780‚Äì1860). These stamps, printed in New York City for the Canadian colonies, and by Perkins, Bacon and Company in London, were issued in many British colonies from the 1850s until 1912 in Queensland. In chronological order, they were released in the Province of Canada in 1851, Nova Scotia in 1853, Tasmania and New Zealand in 1855, The Bahamas and Natal in 1859, Grenada, New Brunswick and Queensland in 1860, and in 1870 in Prince Edward Island. Because these are some of the world's first stamps or the first stamps to bear these colonies' names,In the case of, chronologically, the Province of Canada, New Zealand, The Bahamas, Grenada and Queensland. the Chalon series are objects of many studies and collections.  Description  = Original portrait = Portrait of Queen Victoria in her Robes of State, 1837 by or, more likely, after Alfred Edward Chalon.Where Are the Chalon PaintingsThe Modern, Illustrated History of the New Zealand Chalons The head came from a painting by Alfred Edward Chalon, drawn for the first public appearance of Victoria as Queen on the occasion of her speech at the House of Lords where she prorogued the Parliament of the United Kingdom in July 1837. Chalon's work was intended as a gift from Victoria to her mother. In the portrait she is wearing the George IV State Diadem, created in 1820,This Diadem is visible on the Penny Black stamp. Elizabeth II's effigies wear it on Machin stamp series (since 1967) and on Raphael Maklouf's coins (1985-1997). and the State Robes, a dress and a long royal mantle. Her body is half-turned to the right side, on top of a flight of stairs. While her head is turned to the right, her left hand holds the plinth of a column on which there is a sculpted lion. At that time, this portrait was also known as the \\"Coronation portrait\\" because an engraving by Samuel Cousins was distributed to the public on the day of Victoria's coronation, June 28, 1838. Cousins made two versions of the engraving in several states.The Cousins Cornucopia = On the stamps = On the stamps, which are mainly of a small size, the effigy is reproduced inside an oval that has two main forms; the oval is either large enough to see the Queen's necklace, or too small so that only the upper part of the neck is visible, but excludes the necklace. On the New Zealand stamps the circle has a larger diameter so that the upper part of the State Robes are also visible. The engravings for many of these stamps were produced by William Humphrys.Melville, Fred J, Postage Stamps in the Making, 1916, Stanley Gibbons, p.68  History  = Canada = Diamond Jubilee series, 1897. In 1851, the province of Canada (approximatively Ontario and Quebec) was the first colony to use the Chalon head on its first stamps. The April 9, 1851, two of the six first stamps bore this portrait: the 7 and a half pence green and the 12 pence black. After the adoption of the Canadian dollar, one additional stamp was issued in July 1859 with the Chalon head, the 12 and a half cents (with its former denomination of \\"SIX PENCE STERLING\\"). Like the previous series, these stamps were printed in New York.Printer noted in Three other colonies knew Chalon head stamps before their integration to the Confederation of Canada: Nova Scotia in May 1860 (one stamp with the effigy inside a large square stamp put on its point, printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co, New Brunswick in May 1860 (three stamps printed in New York) and Prince Edward Island in June 1870 (one denomination). The last one is the only one printed in Canada, by the British-American Banknote Company.Printers noted in For the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897, the Confederation issued a commemorative stamp that employed the Chalon head and more recent portrait by Heinrich von Angeli. = New Zealand = New Zealand stamp of 1871 In New Zealand the Chalon series debuted as the country's first stamps from 1855 to 1873 and Queen Victoria remained the stamps' topic until the 1898 Pictorial series. In New Zealand philately, the effigy has been called \\"Full Face\\" because the Queen appears to be almost looking forward which was rather unusual at the time when profiles were mainly used on stamps. The one penny (carmine), two pence (blue) and one shilling (green) stamps of 1855 were initially printed in London by Perkins, Bacon & Co. These are rare and expensive (collectors should not buy without expertisation). The printing plates were shipped to New Zealand, and beginning in 1856, stamps were printed by J. Richardson in Auckland, who also printed the six pence stamp (brown) from 1858.New Zealand Stamp Images Government postage stamp printer John Davis began printing stamps in 1862.Printers noted in Prepayment of postage became compulsory in New Zealand in 1862, and so the Davis prints are much more common than the other printings. The three pence stamp (mauve) was also added in 1862. Separations appeared at the end of the 1850s. The separations were initially carried out by (or for) local postmasters, appear in many forms of perforation (points, lines or holes). The most common of the local perforations are the \\"perforated 13 at Dunedin\\" variety, appearing in 1863. Stamps were perforated by the printers beginning in 1864. These stamps were perforated 12¬Ω (so care is needed when identifying the Dunedin perfs!). The four pence stamp was added in 1865, initially in rose, and quickly changed to yellow. In 1871 colours were changed (1d brown, 2d orange, 6d blue). In 1864, a scarcity of paper with the six-pointed star watermark obliged the use of paper with \\"NZ\\" watermark. = Tasmania = Van Diemen's Land used the Chalon portrait on its second issue of 1855 and again under its new name Tasmania from 1858 to 1870. The design around the portrait is uncommon compared to other Chalon series. = Bahamas = An 1863 stamp of the Bahamas. In July 1858, the governor of the Bahamas, Charles John Bayley, wanted to replace British stamps circulating on mail in the colony. In his mail to British offices, he submitted a design of a round stamp illustrated with two main productions of the islands; a pineapple and conch but, Perkins, Bacon & Co judged that such a stamp design would be too difficult to print and to perforate. The printing company proposed a project derived from others Chalon issues: the oval of the portrait should be reduced in size and two little ovals appeared for the two Bahamian products. A banderole precised the use of the one penny stamp: \\"INTERINSULAR POSTAGE\\". The first package of stamps printed in London were put on sale in the Bahamas the June 10, 1859. Perforations appeared in September 1860 but they were perfectly mastered by Perkins Bacon after 1863 (14 holes for 2 cm). To replace British stamps on the mail sent to North America and the United Kingdom, two new values are issued; 4 pence rose and 6 pence grey. The pineapple and conch ovals were no longer used. = Queensland = When Queensland separated from New South Wales they issued the first stamps with a Chalon effigy in 1860 and replaced them in 1880. The Chalon head reappeared in 1882 on bigger stamps printed in intaglio or lithography, on high value stamps denominated from 2 shillings to one pound. This series was available until 1912 with the arrival of the Commonwealth of Australia stamps. = Natal = Stamp of 1863. In 1859 the Colony of Natal, in Southern Africa, replaced its embossed stamps with Chalons until 1867. = Grenada = Grenada's first postage stamps used one of the main Chalon design with the name and denomination horizontally printed relative on the top and bottom of the stamp. On the 1859 series the necklace was visible, but on the 1875 series the effigy was placed inside a small circle that masked the Queen's neck. A new design was issued in 1883.  Collection and studies  Because the stamps with the effigy inspired by Chalon's portrait are the first or one of the first stamps of these colonies, their study is well-developed by classical philatelists and 19th century postal historians. Concerning the Bahamian Chalons, Louis E Bradbury, treasurer of the Royal Philatelic Society London (RPSL) between 1927 and 1945, accumulated stamps, documents and correspondence between British governmental services and Perkins Bacon. After his death on 7 July 1950,Gibbons Stamp Monthly, August 1950, p145 his collection was received by the RPSL. In fine and unused condition, these series are among the most priced stamps of British colonial philately.

The site is now owned and used by a Christian organisation called Ellel Ministries Internationalhttp://ellel.org/uk/about/ellel-scotland/ as a prayer, training and healing retreat centre. History Blairmore School was established in 1947 as an independent prep school for boys aged 8‚Äì13 by Colonel D.R. Ainslie D.S.O., B.A., a keen educationalist, Cambridge graduate and retired Seaforth Highlander. The school turned co-ed in 1975. Pupil numbers peaked at 90 in 1989 but the economic recession of the early 1990s caused a decline in UK prep school subscriptions and in June 1993, with fewer than 30 pupils enrolled for the coming academic year, Blairmore became impossible to sustain financially and the school was forced to close. Culture The school was small and isolated in the country. Pupils were encouraged to spend time outdoors, taking advantage of the school's extensive grounds and rural surroundings. Daily sports were an integral part of the curriculum, while Scouting and camping were a key part of Blairmore life. Blairmore had its own riding school and stables at some stage, a woodland assault course, a ski-slope and Britain's only school ski tow. In the evenings and at weekends, the woodlands around the school provided an ideal playground for the young boys and girls. Dressed in their \\"Woods Clothes\\" (as casual clothes were known), pupils played conkers, climbed trees and constructed dens, known as \\"cols\\" (short for colonies), from which raids were launched against rival groups. Features The school was divided into four houses, named after rivers in the North-East of Scotland: Deveron (red), Dee (green), Spey (yellow) and Don (blue). Boarders slept in dormitories in the main school building, although for a period senior boys were accommodated in the neighbouring Glebe House. Dormitories were originally given simple topographical names but were later renamed with an ornithological theme. The boys' dorms included: Tower (which became Buzzard), South (Eagle), East (Harrier). The girls' dorms were: Side (Lapwing), Middle (Heron), Back (Plover). The dormitories in Glebe House were given local place names: Cairnie, Cabrach, Botriphinie. Blairmore had its own tartan. The school had a long-standing rivalry with nearby Aberlour House. Other regular sporting opponents included Drumtochty Castle, Rannoch School, Croftinloan School, Lathallan, Gordonstoun, Peterhead Academy, Ardvreck School, Aberdeen Academy, Aberdeen Grammar School and The Gordon Schools, Huntly.

Blairmore House Blairmore House, the former school's premises, is a Victorian country house set amid of park and woodland beside the River Deveron, from Huntly, from Aberdeen and from Inverness. The house was designed by the architect Alexander Marshall Mackenzie and was built in 1884 as a private house for Alexander Geddes, a wealthy businessman and great-great grandfather of the former British Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron's father, Ian Donald Cameron, was born in the house in 1932. Geddes made his fortune in Chicago in the US in the trading of grain in the 1850s, and a safe belonging to him which survived the Great Fire of Chicago was installed in the house's Billiard Room. During the Second World War it served as GHQ Home Forces for some of the Auxiliary Units based in Aberdeenshire and had a training area within the grounds of the house and nearby land. Auxunit Patrols was a special force consisting of between six and eight men trained in the utmost secrecy to a high standard. In the event of a German invasion, they would go to ground and carry out a clandestine war against the occupying forces. After the school's closure, Blairmore House was run as a private hunting lodge for several years. The building is now used as a prayer and intercession training school and retreat centre run by an evangelical Christian group called Ellel Ministries. Blairmore House is a Category C listed building.

This cemetery is located in Section 23 of Columbia Township. The entrance is on the north side of Duck Creek Road, about 1500 feet east of Kennedy Avenue. The cemetery encompasses 11.5 acres. By the middle of the twentieth century the cemetery became increasingly neglected. A group of plot owners sued the cemetery association in 1956. The courts appointed a new board to operate the cemetery but the board was unable to convince plot owners to pay for perpetual care which would generate funds for ongoing cemetery maintenance.

Some bars like the \\"disreputable Hotel Tupilak disco produces plenty of broken glass.\\" Other issues such as domestic violence and solvent abuse also plague Greenland. Most large towns of populations upwards of 1,000 and some smaller ones have a police presence with a contact number to keep on good relations with locals and tourists. Prison system The Greenlandic prison system runs with a uniquely open model. Prisoners must report to prison between 9:30pm and 6:30am each day, but may go to work, visit relatives and complete errands while in the community. They also may hunt with firearms if they are escorted by a prison guard. Prisoners have keys to their own cells, as this is regarded as a form of privacy. A failure to attend prison will result in 7 days in solitary confinement once the escapee returns. Prisoners are also subjected to drug testing, and a failed drug test will result in solitary confinement. There are presently 160 places in the Greenlandic prison system. Greenland intends to construct a secure facility to house prisoners needing continual supervision and/or psychiatric care, with a 20-bed capacity, a project on foot since 2007 which has been delayed several times until 2017. As a consequence, Greenlandic prisoners requiring a high level of supervision are sent to Denmark's Herstedvester, a prison which has the capacity to provide psychiatric care. There remains ongoing issues with care in this facility, with complaints ranging from the language barrier with Danish guards, to the Danish system de-prioritising Greenlandic inmates care and rehabilitation against the needs of Danish inmates, to the problematic means of Nuuk's judicial evaluation of the prisoners through Skype teleconferencing.

As all the main lines of Finnish railway network have been electrificied, the locomotive is designated mostly to unelectrified, less frequently used side lines. Occasionally it may still pull cargo trains on main lines. It has also been put in service as a shunter, replacing older classes Dv15 and Dv16 as they were retired. A total of 192 locomotives were built by Lokomo and Valmet between the years 1963 and 1984. As of 2019, the oldest Dv12 units are 56 years old.  Technical information  A Dv12 class diesel locomotive passes Huutokoski while pulling a regional train from Pieks√§m√§ki to Joensuu. Kolari, July 2007 The Dv12 is a general purpose locomotive which was designed for both passenger and cargo train use. Its 1000 kW power is somewhat low by current standards, but it is capable of multiple-unit operation with only one train crew and doublets and triplets are common. It has a low axle load of 15.6 tonnes, which makes it very well suited for branch lines that allow only smaller axle loads. All the axles are interconnected with shafts and universal joints to the Voith L 216 rs hydraulic transmission. Because all axles must rotate at the same speed, the individual slipping of axles is impossible. This translates into a very good tractive effort for a 62 tonne locomotive. The main engine is a Finnish- built Tampella SACM MGO V16 BSHR Diesel with two Brown Boveri-VTR 200 M turbochargers. The Dv12 has two speed ranges, for cargo use and for passenger use. This mechanical gear can only be switched with the locomotive at standstill. Variants =Sr12= Between 1965 and 1972, 60 slightly heavier variants of the Sv12 were built. These were assimilated in the same series when their nomenclature changed to Dv12. =Sv1= Dv12 number 2501 was modified between 1978 and 1980 to run on electricity instead of diesel, becoming class Sv1 number 3201. The locomotive was used first in freight traffic, later in passenger trains between Helsinki and Imatra. The Sv1 was used to test three-phase alternating current electrical engines; the results were used when developing class Dr16. The electrical components were delivered by Str√∂mberg, which was also involved in the Dr16 project. The locomotive was painted yellow with black stripes, a colour scheme known from another short- lived prototype, the Dr15. In 1984, after four years of testing, the Sv1 was refitted with a diesel engine, returning to its original nomenclature and number. Number 3201 is nowadays used on an Sr2 class locomotive. Dv12 number 2501 is currently, in 2019, still in use.  Retirement and future development  In 2009, VR abandoned some of the older units of 2700 series Dv12s. The company plans to purchase new diesel locomotives during the 2010s.

Ersatz-Division) was a unit of the German Army, in World War I.From the late 1800s, the Prussian Army was effectively the German Army, as, during the period of German unification (1866-1871), the states of the German Empire entered into conventions with Prussia regarding their armies. Only the Bavarian Army remained fully autonomous and only came under Prussian control during wartime. The division was formed in June 1915 as a temporary division known as the Division Basedow, named after its commander, Heino von Basedow.Division Basedow (Chronik 1915/1916) It was formed from two previously independent Brigades: 37th Mixed Landwehr and 2nd Reserve Ersatz. The division was converted into the 5th Ersatz Division in June 1916.5. Ersatz-Division (Chronik 1914/1917) The 5th Ersatz Division was disbanded in 1919, during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. Combat chronicle The division initially occupied defensive positions in the Yser region. In October 1916, it entered the Battle of the Somme. Thereafter, it occupied positions in the Champagne region until December 1916, when it was transferred to the Eastern Front. It fought in Lithuania until the armistice on the Eastern Front, and then carried out garrison duties in Estonia and Latvia until February 1919.

He is also a four-time Olympic Gold medalist team and individual.  Early life and competitive career  Beerbaum was born in Detmold, Germany. In school, he took Business Studies, but eventually gave it up for a career in show jumping. Beerbaum began riding on a Highland Pony at the age of 8. He had a very successful career as a young Rider which continued into his adulthood. His most notable accomplishments include winning 4 Olympic Golds (his first at age 25) and numerous European and World Championship medals. On Sunday 21 September 2008, at the Samsung Super League Final in Barcelona, Beerbaum was a member of the winning German Nations Cup team. He was awarded Leading Rider of the 2008 Super League, along with 50,000 CHF ($46,000).

However, following the competition, Goldfever tested positive for the prohibited substance betamethasone. The International Equestrian Federation found Beerbaum guilty of breaking the rules, stripping both him and his German team of their medals, dropping Germany down to bronze. Beerbaum believed the substance to have been present in an ointment administered to the horse due to a skin irritation, and the FEI agreed that the substance provided no competitive advantage.

It is a type of hypersensitivity, specifically immune complex hypersensitivity (type III). The term serum sickness‚Äìlike reaction (SSLR) is occasionally used to refer to similar illnesses that arise from the introduction of certain non-protein substances, such as penicillin. It was first characterized by Clemens von Pirquet and B√©la Schick in 1906. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms can take as long as 14 days after exposure to appear, and may include signs and symptoms commonly associated with hypersensitivity or infections. * rashes * itching * joint pain (arthralgia), especially finger and toe joints * fever, as high as 40 ¬∞C and usually appears before rash * lymphadenopathy (swelling of lymph nodes), particularly near the site of injection, head and neck * malaise * hypotension (decreased blood pressure) * splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) * glomerulonephritis * protein in the urine * blood in the urine * shock Causes When an antiserum is given, the human immune system can mistake the proteins present for harmful antigens. The body produces antibodies, which combine with these proteins to form immune complexes. These complexes precipitate, enter the walls of blood vessels, and activate the complement cascade, initiating an inflammatory response and consuming much of the available complement component 3 (C3). The result is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. This results in hypocomplementemia, a low C3 level in serum. They can also cause more reactions resulting in typical symptoms of serum sickness. =Antitoxins and antisera= Serum sickness can be developed as a result of exposure to antibodies derived from animals. These sera or antitoxins are generally administered to prevent or treat an infection or envenomation. =Drugs= Some of the drugs associated with serum sickness are: * allopurinol * barbiturates * captopril * cephalosporins * crofab * griseofulvin * penicillins * phenytoin * procainamide * quinidine * streptokinase * sulfonamides * rituximab * ibuprofen * infliximab * oxycodone =Others= Allergenic extracts, hormones and vaccines can also cause serum sickness. However, according to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, currently routinely recommended vaccinations to the general population in the U.S have not been shown to cause serum sickness. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on history given by patient, including recent medications. Prevention Avoidance of antitoxins that may cause serum sickness is the best way to prevent serum sickness. Although, sometimes, the benefits outweigh the risks in the case of a life-threatening bite or sting. Prophylactic antihistamines or corticosteroids may be used concomitant with the antitoxin. Skin testing may be done beforehand in order to identify individuals who may be at risk of a reaction. Physicians should make their patients aware of the drugs or antitoxins to which they are allergic if there is a reaction. The physician will then choose an alternate antitoxin if it's appropriate or continue with prophylactic measures. Treatment With discontinuation of the offending agent(s), symptoms usually disappear within 4‚Äì5 days. Corticosteroids, antihistamines, and analgesics are the main line of treatment. The choice depends on the severity of the reaction. Use of plasmapheresis has also been described.

It comprised 48,000 hectares of land located between the Tagus and Sado Rivers. This property was reduced to less than half by global crises such as the Great Depression and the World Wars, as well as local climatic, seismic catastrophes and political turmoil which led to extensive land transaction. Nevertheless, the company was an important infrastructure for Portuguese agriculture throughout history, its modernity and technological developments in animal and vegetable farming as in forestry were always noted in the country. After 138 years, the Lez√≠rias Company was nationalized, hence returning to public ownership status. The enterprise's economic sustainability and the policy to prevent urbanization from spreading there are the main tasks of its current administrations.

It tells of an outwardly perfect family in Bordeaux, whose seeming perfection begins to unravel when the wife involves herself in politics. A corpse surfaces just before the local election and the spectre of past family indiscretion resurfaces in mysterious deaths and other scandals. Plot In a grand house at Bordeaux lives G√©rard, owner of a pharmaceutical business. A drinker and fornicator, he disgusts his son Fran√ßois, recently returned from the USA. To G√©rard's disgust, his second wife Anne is a candidate in the municipal election. Her daughter by her first marriage, Mich√®le, is excited by the return of Fran√ßois and the two go off for a weekend at Pyla, where they become lovers. Anne's old aunt Line encourages the pair. Anne's campaign takes a jolt when she and her family are smeared in an anonymous tract. The family suspect that G√©rard is the author. Not everybody believes the slanders and the outgoing mayor, impressed by Anne's qualities, promises her his job if she wins a seat. On the night of the count everybody is at the town hall except Mich√©le, who has to finish an assignment for her university course. G√©rard sneaks home drunk and tries to rape her, but in the struggle falls and dies. Line then confesses to Mich√®le that she had loved her brother too closely, until he was executed in the Second World War as a member of the French Resistance. The man who ordered the execution was their father, a Nazi collaborator, so Line killed him. She says she will now take the blame for killing G√©rard. A cavalcade of hooting cars then sweeps into the drive and Anne's supporters throng into the house to toast her victory in champagne.

A finite set of productions P is the main component in the specification of a formal grammar (specifically a generative grammar). The other components are a finite set N of nonterminal symbols, a finite set (known as an alphabet) Sigma of terminal symbols that is disjoint from N and a distinguished symbol S in N that is the start symbol. In an unrestricted grammar, a production is of the form u to v, where u and v are arbitrary strings of terminals and nonterminals, and u may not be the empty string. If v is the empty string, this is denoted by the symbol epsilon, or lambda (rather than leave the right-hand side blank). So productions are members of the cartesian product :V^*NV^* times V^* = (V^*setminusSigma^*) times V^*, where V := N cup Sigma is the vocabulary, {}^{*} is the Kleene star operator, V^*NV^* indicates concatenation, cup denotes set union, and setminus denotes set minus or set difference. If we do not allow the start symbol to occur in v (the word on the right side), we have to replace V^* by (V setminus {S})^* on the right side of the cartesian product symbol.See Klaus Reinhardt: Prioritatszahlerautomaten und die Synchronisation von Halbspursprachen ; Fakult√§t Informatik der Universit√§t Stuttgart; 1994 (German) The other types of formal grammar in the Chomsky hierarchy impose additional restrictions on what constitutes a production. Notably in a context-free grammar, the left-hand side of a production must be a single nonterminal symbol. So productions are of the form: :N to (N cup Sigma)^* Grammar generation To generate a string in the language, one begins with a string consisting of only a single start symbol, and then successively applies the rules (any number of times, in any order) to rewrite this string. This stops when we obtain a string containing only terminals. The language consists of all the strings that can be generated in this manner. Any particular sequence of legal choices taken during this rewriting process yields one particular string in the language. If there are multiple different ways of generating this single string, then the grammar is said to be ambiguous. For example, assume the alphabet consists of a and b, with the start symbol S, and we have the following rules: : 1. S rightarrow aSb : 2. S rightarrow ba then we start with S, and can choose a rule to apply to it. If we choose rule 1, we replace S with aSb and obtain the string aSb. If we choose rule 1 again, we replace S with aSb and obtain the string aaSbb. This process is repeated until we only have symbols from the alphabet (i.e., a and b). If we now choose rule 2, we replace S with ba and obtain the string aababb, and are done. We can write this series of choices more briefly, using symbols: S Rightarrow aSb Rightarrow aaSbb Rightarrow aababb. The language of the grammar is the set of all the strings that can be generated using this process: {ba, abab, aababb, aaababbb, dotsc}.

The plane was developed from the Piel Super Emeraude and was born as the CP100. The name changed to CAP 10, CAP for 'Constructions A√©ronautiques Parisiennes'. The CAP 10 was manufactured by Mudry (name of its designer) in Bernay, France, bought by CAP Industries which then became Apex Aircraft. Following the bankruptcy of Apex in 2008, rights to produce spares were awarded to Dyn'Aviation. After the bankruptcy of DynAero in 2012, manufacture of spares was taken over by CEAPR in Darois. Design and development The prototype C.P. 100 was first flown in August 1968 and was followed by the production variants, the CAP 10 and CAP 10B which had revised tail surfaces. The CAP 10 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane of wooden construction, with the CAP 10C having a carbon sandwich wing spar. The engine is a Lycoming AEIO-360 fuel injection engine, fully lubricated in inverted flight. 300+ aircraft were built, and in 2007 the CAP 10C is still in production as the CAP 10C NG. The CAP 10 is one of the most successful aerobatic training aircraft in the world. About 200 aircraft are still flying in the late 2000s and nearly two generations of aerobatic champions made their classes with it.

A visitor's click path may start within the website or at a separate third party website, often a search engine results page, and it continues as a sequence of successive webpages visited by the user. Click paths take call data and can match it to ad sources, keywords, and/or referring domains, in order to capture data. Clickstream analysis is useful for web activity analysis,WW Moe, PS Fader (2004),\\" Capturing Evolving Visit Behavior in Clickstream Data\\" Journal of Interactive Marketing (2004) software testing, market research, and for analyzing employee productivity. Information storage While navigating the World Wide Web, a \\"user agent\\" (web browser) makes requests to another computer, known as a web server, every time the user selects a hyperlink. Most web servers store information about the sequence of links that a user \\"clicks through\\" while visiting the websites that they host in log files for the site operator's benefit. The information of interest can vary and may include: information downloaded, webpage visited previously, webpage visited afterwards, duration of time spent on page, etc. The information is most useful when the client/user is identified, which can be done through website registration or record matching through the client's Internet service provider (ISP). Storage can also occur in a router, proxy server or ad server. Data analysis Data mining, column-oriented DBMS, and integrated OLAP systems can be used in conjunction with clickstreams to better record and analyze this data. Privacy Use of clickstream data can raise privacy concerns, especially since some Internet service providers have resorted to selling users' clickstream data as a way to enhance revenue. There are 10-12 companies that purchase this data, typically for about $0.40/month per user. While this practice may not directly identify individual users, it is often possible to indirectly identify specific users, an example being the AOL search data scandal. Most consumers are unaware of this practice, and its potential for compromising their privacy. In addition, few ISPs publicly admit to this practice. As the world of online shopping grows, it is becoming easier for the privacy of individuals to become exploited. There have many cases of email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information that have been stolen illegally from shoppers, clients, and many more to be used by third parties. These third parties can range from advertisers to hackers. There are consumers who actually benefit from this by gaining more targeted advertising and deals, but most are harmed by the lack of privacy. As the world of technology grows, consumers are more and more in risk of losing privacy. Applications Clickstreams can be used to allow the user to see where they have been and allow them to easily return to a page they have already visited, a function that is already incorporated in most browsers. Clickstream can display the specific time and position that individuals browsed and closed the website, all the web pages they viewed, the duration they spent on each page and it can also show which pages are viewed most frequently. There is abundant information to be analyzed, individuals can check visitors clickstream in association with other statistical information, such as: visiting length, retrieval words, ISP, countries, explorers, etc. This process enables individuals to know their visitors deeply. Webmasters can gain insight into what visitors on their site are doing by using the clickstream. This data itself is \\"neutral\\" in the sense that any dataset is neutral. The data can be used in various scenarios, one of which is marketing. Additionally, any webmaster, researcher, blogger or person with a website can learn about how to improve their site. The growing e-commerce industry has made it necessary to tailor to the needs and preferences of consumers. Click path data can be used to personalize product offerings. By using previous click path data, websites can predict what products the user is likely to purchase. Click path data can contain information about the user's goals, interests, and knowledge and therefore can be used to predict their future actions and decisions. By using statistical models, websites can potentially increase their operating profits by streamlining results based on what the user is most likely to purchase. Analyzing the data of clients that visit a company website can be important in order to remain competitive. This analysis can be used to generate two findings for the company, the first being an analysis of a user's clickstream while using a website to reveal usage patterns, which in turn gives a heightened understanding of customer behaviour. This use of the analysis creates a user profile that aids in understanding the types of people that visit a company's website. As discussed in Van den Poel & Buckinx (2005), clickstream analysis can be used to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase from an e-commerce website. Clickstream analysis can also be used to improve customer satisfaction with the website and with the company itself. This can generate a business advantage, and be used to assess the effectiveness of advertising on a web page or site.Patrali Chatterjee, Donna L. Hoffman and Thomas P. Novak (2003),\\"Modeling the Clickstream: Implications for Web-Based Advertising Efforts\\", Marketing Science22(4), (Autumn, 2003), 520-541 Opinions Researchers who stand behind click path analysis note that \\"the path analytical method estimates a system of equations that specify all the possible causal linkages among a set of variables\\". Further click paths enable researchers to break down correlations among variables into direct or indirect and spurious components. Finally click path analysis \\"helps researchers disentangle the complex interrelationships among variables and identify the most significant pathways involved in predicting an outcome\\". But even with these advantages the technique is still critiqued by many due to its large margin of error. The model must assume that each variable is \\"an exact manifestation of the theoretical concepts underlying them and reasonably free of measurable error\\". Another \\"casualty in the hypothesized model is that the path must flow in one direction (no feedback loops or bidirectional causality), otherwise the model cannot be solved with ordinary least squares regression techniques\\". Lastly, because models are based on correlations, path analysis \\"cannot demonstrate causality or the direction of causal effects\\". Due to these limitations, many believe that click path analysis tends to be a waste of time, money, and resources. Implications Most websites store data about visitors to the site through click path.

In addition, the data results can not only be used by a designer to review, improve or redesign their website, but can also be used to model a user's browsing behaviour. In the online world of e-commerce, information collected through click path allows advertisers to construct personal profiles and use them to individually target consumers much more effectively than ever before; as a result, advertisers create more relevant advertising and efficiently spend advertising dollars. Meanwhile, in the wrong hands click path data poses a serious threat to personal privacy. Unauthorized clickstream data collection is considered to be spyware. However, authorized clickstream data collection comes from organizations that use opt-in panels to generate market research using panelists who agree to share their clickstream data with other companies by downloading and installing specialized clickstream collection agents. Challenges The number of paths a user can potentially take greatly increases depending on the number of pages on that particular website. Many tools to determine path analysis are too linear and do not account for the complexity of internet usage. In most cases, less than 5% of users follow the most common path. However, even if all users used the same path, there is still no way to tell which page is the most influential in determining behavior. Even in more linear forms of path analysis, where they can see where most customers drop off the website, the \\"why?\\" factor is still missed. The main challenge of path analysis lies in the fact that it tries to regulate and force users to follow a certain path, when in reality users are very diverse and have specific preference and opinions.

His Treatise on Physiology, reproducing and elaborating on work by William Cheselden, helped revolutionize Chinese and later Japanese medical understanding and treatment. Life Hobson was born in 1816 in Welford, Northamptonshire, in England. He graduated from London University with a MB and passed an examination as a MRCS.. Joining the London Missionary Society as a medical missionary to the Qing Empire, he departed with his wife Jane Abbey Hobson and Messrs Legge and Milne on . It left London on 28 July 1839, and reached Anyer on 12 November 12 and Macao on 18 December. Assisted by Elijah Bridgman, Hobson found a residence and joined the local Medical Missionary Society. Its hospital reopened on August 1, 1840. When William Lockhart left for Zhoushan at the end of the month and Dr Diver retired from poor health soon afterwards, Hobson was left in sole charge of its operation. In early 1843, he left to establish the Medical Missionary Hospital Hong Kong. This opened to patients on June 1 and the demand for its services so outstripped both expectations and capacity that he relied heavily on help from Chinese assistants. This led him to consider how to explain western medical training to the Chinese, then reliant on often pseudoscientific traditional medicine. In 1845, his wife's health was so poor that they left for Britain in July but she died while at anchor off Dungeness on December 22. Left with a young son and daughter, he married Rebecca Morrison, the daughter of his fellow Chinese missionary Robert, while in England. He returned with her and Mr Hirschberg on the Hugh Walker. This left Britain on March 11, 1847, and reached Hong Kong on July 27, whereupon he resumed direction of its hospital. He visited Guangzhou (then known as \\"Canton\\") with Mr Gillespie in October 1847 and moved there the next February, operating a clinic out of his residence. In April, he opened a pharmacy and, in June, purchased the house on Kum-Le-Fo. (, Jƒ´nl√¨ B√π, . \\"Golden Benefit Wharf\\") in the western suburbs for use as the Missionary Hospital or Clinic Hu√¨√†i Yƒ´gu«én).. While there, he was assisted by the Chinese ministers and missionaries Liang Fa and Zhou Xue. At the end of 1854, he traveled to Shanghai for a five-week rest for health reasons. He and his family were forced to evacuate to Hong Kong in October 1856 on account of the onset of the Second Opium War. The missionary community of Shanghai prevailed upon him to return in February 1857 and he took Dr Lockhart's place at their hospital when Lockhart returned to England at the end of that year. His eldest son took work with a merchant house, but the rest of the family returned with him to Europe, reaching England in March 1859. His health not permitting his return to China, he then resided at Clifton and Cheltenham. He died at Forest Hill near London in 1873.

It shows a struggling man hitting bottom and finding light in unexpected places, and trying a huge alternative as the solution to his problems while giving up the life he recently found.  Plot  The film darkly lampoons success, failure, and show business.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275468/ Billy Byrne is famous, the new big thing, yet the film doesn't say what's the great idea that got him there, he is just suddenly on top, everywhere and adored. Women, money, fame, then everything changes and Billy finds himself being rejected, a failure, he is not so good anymore. He turns to friends but they are busy on their own thing. Goes from enjoying luxuries to living in the streets, consuming drugs and finding homeless people giving him some sort of shelter underground, and beyond that: emotional shelter, a tribe. A new woman, a new life underground. Pay close attention to the black dog appearing on the film when something bad is about to happen, and pay close attention to Billy abilities to affect public lighting due to his \\"own energy\\". Billy totally losses his magic and can't even make one single light blink. Still obsessed with fame and success, tries hard to come up with some magic plan, strategies, communication campaigns (again not clear what's his line of work), and finds friends doing nothing while discovering the one who betrayed his trust. Billy discovers there is more than the idea, the plan, and finds himself talking about semantics, messages and content beyond the words. Seems like a clue on a personal discovery on what path to take. Here things begin to appear cryptic. Why? because the movie goes on a mission no showing you the protagonist along with more than enough metaphors that can be applied to almost anyone. Deep in drugs, dirty, stinky and a total disaster finally makes it to the big president of the company to present his great ideas (written on dirty paper) only to find out his old friend now already working with them. Billy argues, and even warns them about the danger and them being dangerous in many ways, but his friend answers \\"I already know\\", and claiming it doesn't affect him because he is aware they are using him, just like he is using them (in front of the president). Billy seems to open his eyes and being unable to explain his idea, gain attention and appearing as a dirty unhealthy drug addict goes to the bathroom to put some more drugs in. In frustration he seems to see the light. He finally comes with the plan of closing a deal with the drugs he gained access to, the deal is accepted and asks for tickets to Greenland so he can leave his dirty life behind and begin a new one on a natural paradise. The complex metaphors (but clear on screen) present a new Billy willing to give up his world for a new one, includes his new girlfriend on the plan but she appears unable to grasp the concept of freedom and fails to go on with him. Finally opens his eyes leaving everything and everyone behind as a message up to the viewer to elaborate. His new girlfriend rejects the tickets and wants drugs, he leaves on a limousine and begins to take his piercings off. Billy doesn't know, but he is back (as a human being) and while the car drives on the road: all the lights don't blink, but they shut down immediately as a message that he is way better and above from any place he has ever been in life as a person. The movie ends with him on Greenland, the place of the initial take on the film where hi gives this speech on time, and what would you do on your last minute. Clues were left on different sites on the web about interviews, comments and director hints for better understanding of the movie, difficult to find all that info in just one site.

It was written and drawn by John Findley. Initially, the series was conceived as an adult-oriented parody of horror and Old West genres, combining standard vampire, werewolf (or, in this case, \\"werecoyote\\"), and goblin characters with classic Western themes, using a format loosely based on the EC Comics horror publications of the 1950s. It strove toward a goal of combining humor with genuine horror. Plot The story is about the town of Hangman's Corners, its eccentric population and the peculiar and somewhat terrifying complications visited upon them by a variety of beings. Each episode was introduced by the deceased \\"Old Claim Jumper\\". The series is divided into three arcs. The first arc is about a vampire who seeks help from Beyond in the course of combating the disgruntled townsfolk. Due to his own incompetence, he accidentally conjures up two benevolent demons who become central characters throughout the rest of the series. The second arc concerns a rancher and the grisly fate of his chickens. The third, and longest, arc tells of a world-famous violinist who visits the town, bringing with him a hideous secret. Publication history The complete series was 271 pages long in its initial form of publication. The first two arcs were later edited together and published in paperback by Catalan Communications (1987) with an introduction by Heavy Metal editor Julie Simmons-Lynch. Tex Arcana returned to Heavy Metal in the tenth anniversary issue (July 1987). This was a self-contained ten page story titled \\"The Ballad of the Witch's Daughter\\". In 2006, the entire series was edited by the author into a single volume titled Tex Arcana: a Saga of the Old West published by BookSurge. The series was viewable online, along with a continuation of the story, at the author's website, however, as of early 2017, the links to the artistic content are not active, other than the link to the self-contained ten-page story titled \\"The Ballad Of The Witch's Daughter\\".Official Tex Arcana website See also *Weird West External links http://www.sweaz.com References Heavy Metal (magazine) titles Western (genre) comics Horror comics ","title":"Tex Arcana"},{"id":"12800998","text":"Robert Jermain Thomas Robert Jermain Thomas (1839 ‚Äì died c. 31 August 1866) was a Welsh Protestant Christian missionary who served with the London Missionary Society in late Qing Dynasty China and Korea. While serving as a missionary to China, Thomas developed a strong desire to work among the people of Korea. At the time, Korea was closed to foreigners because of the government's fear of foreign influence. Many Koreans had been converted by Catholic priests in the late 1700s, but the government killed 8,000 of those converts in 1866. First visit to Korea Thomas made his first visit to the Korean coast in 1865, making him the second known Protestant missionary to Korea (Karl Gutzlaff, a German Protestant missionary, was the first, having visited Korea in 1832 and distributed Chinese Bibles to Koreans). Thomas learned as much as he could about the people and their language during his two and a half months there, distributing tracts and New Testaments in Chinese because they were not available in Korean. During this first visit, Thomas kept a diary of which the following are the entries for 3 and 4 November 1865.Robert Jermain Thomas \\"The West Coast of Korea\\" dated June 11, 1866 Nov. 3rd.‚ÄîThis morning half-a-dozen junkmen went ashore to catch shell fish, on which three of them were cruelly beaten about the legs by a score of cowardly islanders. Our little fleet of nine junks was in a state of high indignation. We could send fifty men to fight. In their own fashion they immediately loaded their rusty matchlocks and small guns with powder only! And taking to their , flying their respective flags, amidst great beating of gongs, made for the village. All the islanders were congregated like a flock of white sheep on the top of the hill. Two or three of the fiercer ones were going through all kinds of warlike manoeuvres on a near cliff. Steadily our flotilla advanced, firing volley after volley of power‚Äîthe more prudent one fire about five hundred yards from the village. Two of the most daring boats advanced towards the shore, where, by this time, many of those from the hill had collected themselves and were engaged very vigorously in pelting stones; nothing daunted, these two boats seized a small junk lying off the beach, in a trice they had lifted the anchor, and amidst great acclamations brought away their prize. It is a small tub and will be given up tomorrow. Nov. 4th.‚ÄîYesterday, stormy. Today two islanders fixed a small stick in the ground at low water with a piece of paper attached to it. I sent my writer for it; the following is a free translation:--\\"This for all to see. You are engaged in a contraband trade, a trade severely punished by our respective countries. Your vessels that come here are too much given to disturbances. You have been here already ten days. You have dared to cut wood on a sacred islet with a temple on it, rendering us liable to tempests. Your guilt is very great indeed. As we have none who after the wood, you have taken it in a thievish manner. You are all a set of thieves. You indeed are a desperate set. One of our military officials will come with a thousand men, who will do battle with you and slay you. But now we are willing to make it up and not report it. You must believe this document. The other day you snatched away a vessel; you must return it, and then we will not entertain hostile feelings toward you. Be quick, be quick.\\" Second visit to Korea In 1866, Thomas was asked to join the French Naval force as an interpreter to go to Korea as a part of invading party. However, the French force went to Vietnam instead. So Thomas took a job as an interpreter on an armed American trading ship, the General Sherman. Thomas persuaded the captain to sail to Pyongyang to establish trade between the United States and Korea, even though uninvited trade was forbidden. Thomas's personal motivation was to spread the gospel in Korea. The General Sherman set sail on 9 August 1866 and was first spotted at the mouth of the Taedong River on 16 August. As the ship sailed up the river loaded with cotton goods, tin and glass, Thomas tossed gospel tracts onto the riverbank. Korean officials repeatedly ordered the American boat to leave immediately. On or around 25 August, the crew kidnapped Hyon-Ik Yi, a Korean government official, who was in charge of communications with the ship. An ex-military officer, Chun-Gwon Park, eventually managed to rescue Yi and reinstated him to his former position. However, Yi's two subordinates, Soon-Won Yoo and Chi-Young Park, who had also been taken hostage, perished during the scuffles. On 31 August, the crew of General Sherman fired cannons and guns at the nearby civilians, resulting 7 deaths and 5 wounded. Both the Korean government and the early Korean Christian community agreed that it was the General Sherman that had initiated hostilities. Governor Gyu-Su Park of Pyong-An Province finally declared the General Sherman as an enemy vessel and ordered his troops to prepare for battle. Death When the General Sherman ran aground on a mud- bank near Pyongyang, the Koreans saw their opportunity and attacked. The crew held off the attackers for two days. Eventually, the Koreans launched a burning boat, which set the General Sherman on fire. Among the crew, 14 were shot and killed (including one who had been shot to death two days before), four were burnt to death, and two who had jumped to shore were beaten to death by angry civilians on the shore. One of these, apparently, was Thomas. However, there are other accounts of how Thomas died. The first claim appeared on Oh Mun-hwan's \\"Christian News\\" article of 8 December 1926, reporting that Thomas was killed in retribution by the relatives of those who had been killed by the crew of the General Sherman. In the same article, the author cites a statement from Rev. Lee Jae Bong, a minister in Southern province (1000 miles away). He had a distant relative who happened to be a soldier present during the General Sherman incident. This former soldier said that one of the crew being executed by sword had a red book which he begged the soldiers to take. Mr. Oh concluded that this man must have been Thomas. A year later, this account had evolved stating that Thomas tried to hand his Bible to the executioner and that this soldier later told his family that he had killed a good man (the \\"Korea Mission Field,\\" Sept. 1927). Others claimed that Thomas's executioner was none other than Chun-Gwon Park, who had previously rescued the government official, Hyon-Ik Yi. The Korean official report of the General Sherman incident clearly states that Thomas was killed by civilians, not by Park, and this is corroborated by Oh Mun-Hwan's 1926 article. In another account, Thomas leapt to shore carrying a Bible, which he offered to his attackers while crying, \\"Jesus, Jesus!\\" in Korean. This account was also rebutted by others who stated that Thomas was waving the official signet of Hyon-Ik Yi which had probably been taken from him when he was kidnapped. Hyon- Ik Yi was later demoted for losing an important official signet. Legacy \\"One government official named Pak Yong-Sik who took home some of the Bibles thrown onto the river bank, used them to wallpaper rooms in his house, so people were able to read the gospel there for themselves.\\" This was discovered by the local Christian community in early 1900s, and people came from all over to read the words on his walls. Eventually, a church was established in the area. Certainly, Thomas's influence grew after his death. Only fifteen years later, Pyongyang had become a strong Christian center with a hundred churches. According to Sungho Choi, lecturer at the Wales Evangelical School of Theology, contemporary Korean Christians may not know that Wales is a country with its own language and history, but they do know that Thomas was Welsh. Personal life Robert Thomas was married to Caroline Godfrey during the years of 1863‚Äì1865. Caroline died of a miscarriage only four months after their arrival in Shanghai, China.

It is situated along Harry Graham Drive and upper Cordeaux Road and is part of a tourist route that runs along the Illawarra escarpment for a distance between Mount Kembla and Mount Keira. The Dendrobium Colliery (Illawara Coal, South32) is located in Kembla Heights. The entire village of Kembla Heights is a heritage conservation area under the Wollongong City Council Development Control Plan \\"Kembla Heights is the most intact mining village in the Wollongong Local Government Area with its simple, consistent late Victorian and early Federation period cottages\\". It is in fact the last remaining coal mining village that is company owned in the Illawarra today. The southern portion of Cordeaux Road, Kembla Heights, is known as Windy Gully, it is partially company owned and in private ownership and also part of the Kembla Heights Heritage Conservation Area. The historic Windy Gully Cemetery is located in this portion of Kembla Heights and is still company owned.  History  Kembla Heights is within Dharawal country linking Mt Kemba (the men's mountain) to Mt Keira (the women's mountain) and west to the Cordeaux River Valley that formed a travelling route for Aboriginal people connecting the coast areas to the inland Bargo area. Timber getters were in the area from the 1810s in search of valuable red cedar (Toona ciliata). Europeans began occupying the landscape for agriculture from the 1850s forming a rural collection of farms associated with the settlement known as American Creek. = Mining = With the discovery of oil baring shale and coal the land around Kembla Heights was purchased to become a mining settlement. The Pioneer Kerosene Works (1860‚Äì1878) Australia's first shale mining and kerosene manufacturing plant was owned by John Graham and situated at Kembla Heights. This plant was purchased by the Mt Kembla Coal and Oil Company (1878‚Äì1913) who developed a new coal mine to the north of Kerosene site, later renamed Mt Kembla Colliery Ltd (1913‚Äì1946) and finally purchased by Australian Iron and Steel, AIS (1946‚Äì1970). Nebo Colliery (1946‚Äì1993) was developed by AIS on the site of the original Kerosene works at Kembla Heights. = The Mt Kembla Mine Disaster, Kembla Heights = Mt Kembla Coal and Oil Company's mine in Kembla Heights was the site of the worst industrial accident in Australia's history, the Mt Kembla Mine Disaster. The disaster took place on Thursday 31 July 1902, at precisely three minutes past two o'clock in the afternoon. The disaster was caused by gas seeping undetected from the coal seam in a disused area of the mine that had been mined out. A rock fall pushed the gas out into the tunnels where men were working. When the gas reached the naked flame of colliery workers light, it ignited instantly and caused a series of further gas and coal dust explosions. The initial blast killed some instantly, but the majority died from Carbon monoxide poisoning which penetrated the tunnels from the incomplete combustion of fuel. Windy Gully cemetery was created on a half acre of company land to receive the bodies of the victims of the Mt Kembla Mine Disaster of 1902. In all, about a third of the victims were buried at Windy Gully, most either Presbyterian or Methodist. It was originally known as the Kembla Heights Cemetery or Presbyterian Cemetery.

His 84 wins at Purdue placed him first on the school's all-time wins list until Joe Tiller passed him in 2008, and he ranks fourth in overall winning percentage (.670). Mollenkopf's Boilermakers were nationally ranked for 80 weeks, the most under any Purdue head coach, and captured the #1 spot the first five weeks of the 1968 season. On January 2, 1967, Mollenkopf coached the school's first appearance in the Rose Bowl, leading Purdue to a 14‚Äì13 victory over USC. Against Purdue's in-state rivals, Mollenkopf tallied an 11‚Äì2‚Äì1 record versus Indiana and a 10‚Äì4 mark against Notre Dame. From 1966 to 1969, a Purdue player finished in the top three in balloting for the Heisman Trophy: quarterback Bob Griese was second in 1966, halfback Leroy Keyes placed third in 1967 and second in 1968, and quarterback Mike Phipps finished as runner-up in 1969. Mollenkopf's inaugural season in 1956 was the only losing campaign of his tenure as head coach at Purdue. A prominent figure on the sidelines of postseason all-star games, Mollenkopf served as head coach of the 1958, 1959, and 1960 Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classics; the 1962 and 1963 East‚ÄìWest Shrine Games; the 1964, 1967, and 1970 Hula Bowls; the 1968 All-American Bowl; and the 1969 North‚ÄìSouth Shrine Game. Mollenkopf was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988; the Bowling Green State University Hall of Fame in 1965 and the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1975. In 1994, Coach Mollenkopf was inducted as a member of the inaugural class of the Purdue Intercollegiate Athletic Hall of Fame.

Strauss & Co. was a distinctly upscale department store chain headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. The store was founded in 1853 and declared bankruptcy 140 years later in 1993. The store originally was named the Eagle Clothing Company. Eagle Clothing became one of the city's retailing leaders and reportedly pioneered in the use of fixed prices for customers. In 1879, Leopold Strauss acquired the store and later changed the name to L. Strauss and Company. The main store for many years was located on the southeast corner of Washington Street at Illinois (formerly the Occidental Building). In 1969, Genesco‚Äîa conglomerate based in Nashville, Tennessee, and owner of such stores as Bonwit Teller‚Äîacquired L. Strauss and hired Thad Larson as president. Seeking to return the store to local control, Larson purchased the store from Genesco in 1979. The Washington Street store was torn down in the 1980s in order to make way for Circle Centre Mall. The downtown store moved across the street to Claypool Court, atop which sits the Indianapolis Embassy Suites Downtown hotel. In the bankruptcy filing, one of the reasons listed for the bankruptcy was delays in opening of Circle Centre. L. Strauss's main competitors were L. S. Ayres, William H. Block Co., and H. P. Wasson and Company. During the store's existence, winners of the Indianapolis 500 were presented, in addition to the Borg-Warner Trophy, the L. Strauss & Co. Trophy.

It is now a private house. Sir John de Wingfield (d. circa 1361), of Wingfield, chief administrator to Edward the Black Prince (1330-1376), was the last male of his line, whose daughter and heiress Catherine Wingfield married Michael de la Pole, seated at Wingfield Castle, who in 1385 was created Earl of Suffolk. His descendant Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk (1472‚Äì1513) was forced to surrender his dukedom in 1493. It was resurrected by King Henry VIII in 1514 for his favourite Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk (1484‚Äì1545), who although he had no close connection with Wingfield Castle and the county of Suffolk, was a great-grandson of Sir Robert Wingfield (died 1454), of Letheringham in Suffolk, about 12 miles south of Wingfield. History In 1384 records show that Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk applied for royal licence to crenellate his manor house. The need for the old castle had already ceased to exist by this time and kings were not pleased to see such strongholds built, so Wingfield Castle is a cross between a fortress and a standard moated manor house. Wingfield Castle passed into the hands of the Catlin family from Norwich. In 1702, Sir Nevill Catlin died there and his widow Mary carried the manor to her second husband Sir Charles Turner, 1st Baronet, of Warham. Lord Berners sold the Castle in 1886 to the Adair family. Lady Darrell, a descendant of Lord Berners, sold the castle in 1981 to a Mr. Wingrove. Two years later it was sold to a Mr. Gerald Fairhurst, who spent time in refurbishing it prior to its sale to a London businessman in 1987; and in 1989 it was again sold, this time to a barrister with the surname Gunter. The old Manor House and part of the fortifications were dismantled in 1510 and the present domestic quarters were constructed in about 1540 in the south west corner of the remaining fortifications. At that time the existing Tudor brick merlons on top of the south curtain wall were added. The south facing battlement wall rises to a height of above the moat, and is 45 ‚Äì 50 inches thick. The entrance gateway is approached over a bridge, which still bears the grooves of the former gate, drawbridge and portcullis. The walls are built of flint cobbles with stone for the coigns and windows. The plan of the site is quadrilateral, almost square, the west side being a little longer than the east, an enclosure of about an acre and a half. Besides the almost perfect front, the foundations of the north and east walls and two more towers are traceable. A brick bridge now leads up to the noble gatehouse where the fine depressed pointed archway, deeply recessed and moulded, still shows the portcullis groove and the old oak gates. On either side of the archway are sculptured stone panels depicting the coat of arms of de Wingfield and de la Pole. The two main towers rise to a height of and the octagonal corner towers rise to . The whole castle wall was apparently intact at the beginning of the 20th century, but the north and east walls had been demolished by 1945. A drawbridge still spans the eastern side of the moat. It has been extensively reconstructed, but retains some of the original timbers.

He served as the head football coach at historically black colleges and universities in Texas and Louisiana from 1924 to 1961, compiling a career college football record of 233‚Äì85‚Äì23. His head coaching positions were at Jarvis Christian College (1924‚Äì1926), Bishop College (1927‚Äì1929), Texas College (1931‚Äì1935), and Southern University (1936‚Äì1961). He has been inducted into at least eight halls of fame for his coaching accomplishments. Background In 1924 Mumford graduated from Wilberforce University, where he served as a member of Kappa Alpha Psi social fraternity. He began coaching later that same year. After a brief stint at Jarvis Christian, he then coached football, basketball, and baseball at Bishop. He first came to the attention of Southern University officials after one of his Texas College teams soundly defeated Southern in a game; afterward, when a Southern dean accused his Texas College players of stealing from the school, Mumford forced all of his players to get off of the team bus and to display their personal belongings until the school's missing items could be located. Southern officials were impressed by both his coaching and disciplinary actions of that day. Once at Southern he was also known for emphasizing the importance of education. On the field itself he earned a reputation for perfectionism, making the team practice the same play late into the night to get it just right, even employing a white-colored football to assist visibility during late night use. He was also notably opposed to attempting field goals; at one point Southern was documented to have made just three successful kicks in the decade prior to a November 1955 game‚Äîand perhaps even extending for an undocumented period of time after that as well. A contemporary newspaper article concerning a banquet to be held to recognize Mumford for his then-twenty years of service to Southern summed up his career: In those days, long before the formal creation of the Bayou Classic, Mumford led Southern to an 8‚Äì1 record against Grambling State (including 5‚Äì1 against the famed Eddie Robinson). Southern's biggest intrastate rivalry of that era was actually with Xavier, and it quickly grew too heated to remain at on- campus venues. Mumford supported philanthropic efforts to move the game to a neutral field and convert it into a charitable fundraiser for the local chapter of the Lions Club, in its fight against the causes of visual impairment. Multiple \\"Glasses Bowl\\" classic games were held, starting in 1939. Mumford died of a heart attack at the age of 63, while directing a track meet. It is said that \\"he died in his cleats.\\" Legacy Mumford once had the third most wins among all college football coaches, behind only Pop Warner and Amos Alonzo Stagg; he still has the fourth most wins among HBCU coaches, behind Robinson, Billy Joe, and \\"Big\\" John Merritt. Mumford led Texas College to 1 black college football national championship and Southern to 5 black national championships. He also coached Texas College to 2 and Southern to 11 Southwestern Athletic Conference football championships. During one particular stretch between 1948 and 1951, his teams posted a 38-game unbeaten streak. In addition, he coached Southern to the 1941 black national championship in basketball by taking the National Intercollegiate Invitational Tournament in Cincinnati. He also served as athletic director while at Southern. Mumford's teams produced more than 40 All-Americans. In 1960 it was also estimated that \\"more than half of Louisiana's high school coaches are former Jaguars.\\" By the 1939 season Mumford's football program was so successful that it had begun turning heads even within the local white community; as a sign of the changing times, Southern had begun to advertise accommodations for white patrons on its new stadium grounds. When the stadium was completed in 1940, it included a 150-seat section for white patrons. One of the more noteworthy white fans was Ellis A. \\"Little Fuzzy\\" Brown who, along with his twin brother James (\\"Big Fuzzy\\"), coached Istrouma High School into the most successful dynasty in Louisiana's highest classification of prep football. Likewise, white coaches such as Frank Broyles and Bear Bryant were known to have visited Mumford during his coaching career to discuss football strategy. Mumford's 1948 team also further bridged the racial gap by participating in the first game between an HBCU and a predominantly white institution, at the Fruit Bowl; Southern defeated San Francisco State 30‚Äì0, and finished the year at 12‚Äì0‚Äîa single- season won‚Äìloss record that has yet to be surpassed by any HBCU team. As evidence of the respect that he retained within the HBCU coaching community, among the pallbearers and honorary pallbearers serving at his funeral were past, present, and future college football head coaches Alex Durley, T. B. Ellis, Jake Gaither, Zip Gayles, Howard Gentry, B. T. Harvey, Emory Hines, Bob Lee, Pop Long, Merritt, Billy Nicks, Alfred Priestly, Robinson, and E. E. Simmons. The funeral was officiated by Rev. Dr. T. J. Jemison. Among the honors bestowed upon Mumford include him being elected president of the SWAC and executive vice president of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. In 1958 he was inducted into the NAIA‚ÄìHelms Foundation Hall of Fame. In 1960 he was named \\"Coach of the Decade\\" for the 1950s by the 100% Wrong Club of Atlanta, an organization that fosters HBCU athletic competition. In 1961 he was given the Small College Service Award \\"for outstanding contributions to intercollegiate athletics\\" by the Football Writers Association of America. On February 25, 1962, shortly before his sudden death, Mumford was recognized by the Baton Rouge Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi \\"for outsanding achievement and social service.\\" Though he was much more closely associated with the NAIA, the National Collegiate Athletic Association even made a special point to issue a memorial resolution for Mumford at its fifty-seventh annual convention, in 1963. Southern's A. W. Mumford Stadium, which saw its original concrete grandstand constructed during his tenure, was renamed for him on September 25, 1982, following an expansion project. Mumford was subsequently posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame (1984), the Southern University Sports Hall of Fame (1988), the SWAC Hall of Fame (1992), the HBCU Heritage Museum and Hall of Fame (before or in 2000), and the College Football Hall of Fame (2001). The American Football Coaches Association, of which he was a member, also selected him posthumously for the 2006 Trailblazer Award, for his coaching accomplishments at an HBCU in the decade of the 1940s (an especially noteworthy achievement considering that, back in 1960, he had been named \\"Coach of the Decade\\" for another decade‚Äîthe 1950s). In 2011 he was inducted into the West Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In October 2016 the city of Buckhannon, West Virginia erected a plaque at the lot where his childhood home had been located. On November 4, 2016 Mumford was again acknowledged by the Southern University Sports Hall of Fame, this time with a new, life-sized statue bearing his likeness.

A profusion of alternate scientific names exists for this long-known, heavily discussed, and spectacular group. It has also been called Gymnoblastea and (with or without an emended ending -ae), Anthomedusa, Athecata, Hydromedusa, and Stylasterina. There are about 1,200 species worldwide.Schuchert, P. (2014).

The medusae, or jellyfish, are solitary animals, with tentacles arising from the bell margin, lacking statocysts but possessing radial canals. Their gonads are on the manubrium (\\"handle\\").Bouillon, J.; Gravili, C.; Pag√®s, F.; Gili, J.-M.; Boero, F. (2006). An introduction to Hydrozoa.

In hydrozoans, these are nearly always adhesive and entrapping, rather than puncturing and poisoned as in other jellys. SystematicsSchuchert (2014), World Hydrozoa database. It is not clear whether Stylaster californicus belongs in the Filifera. Upper left: blue top snail (Calliostoma ligatum). The close relationship of the orders Anthoathecata and Leptomedusae has been long known, but formerly it was also believed that these two were close to the order Limnomedusae. However, their closest relatives are the highly advanced Siphonophorae, whereas the Limnomedusae are a rather primitive group, and not very closely related to these three Leptolinae, and might instead belong to the subclass Trachylinae. Some uncertainty existed regarding the taxonomy of the order Anthoathecata. The most simple scheme, used until recently by most authors since it was proposed in 1913, divided the order into a smaller suborder (Filifera) and a second larger one (Capitata), but several unusual Anthoathecatae did not fit into this arrangement, and a considerable number did so awkwardly. The Porpitidae, for example, are highly aberrant group, and were at one time even considered a separate order \\"Chondrophora\\". However, they are currently considered to be derived from Zancleida. In the early 21st century, the well-known Hydra and its relatives - and most of the supposed filiferan infraorders Tubulariida and Moerisiida - were determined to be a very ancient lineage, recognized as suborder Aplanulata.Collins, A. G., Winkelmann, S., Hadrys, H. and Schierwater, B. (2005), Phylogeny of Capitata and Corynidae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) in light of mitochondrial 16S rDNA data. Zoologica Scripta, 34: 91‚Äì99. doi:10.1111/j.1463-6409.2005.00172.x Although not all Anthoathecatae have been firmly placed in the phylogeny, most are fairly certainly assigned at least to one of the major subdivisions. As a notable exception, a prehistoric family, the Heterastridiidae, is still highly disputed regarding its relationships to the extant taxa, as are a small number of very aberrant and/or little-known species such as the aptly named Saccohydra problematica. The family Clathrozoellidae is placed with the Filifera here; in others it is placed in the Leptomedusae and sometimes even synonymized with their family Clathrozoidae. By contrast, the supposed filiferan genus Anthohydra is in fact the leptomedusan Eugymnanthea; similarly, \\"Gammaria\\" is also a leptomedusan and properly spelled Grammaria. The supposed athecate family Monobrachiidae is apparently a close relative of the Olindiasidae, and belongs in the Limnomedusae. Halammohydridae and Otohydridae, sometimes placed here, appear to be trachyline hydrozoans of the order Actinulidae. =Infraorders and families= Hydractinia epiconcha belongs to the Margelina in the suborder Filifera.

He went on to serve as an American Civil War major who contributed notes and references to an American edition of Mathew Hale's (1609‚Äì1676) Historia placitorum coronae (History of the pleas of the crown) published by R. H. Small of Philadelphia in 1847. Between January 1863 and August 1864, he owned The Republican, one of the first local newspapers in Greensburg, PA.  Stokes Mansion and Meeting with Andrew Carnegie  In 1850, at the age of 36, Stokes was persuaded by his legal client, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, to take a residence in the southwestern portion of Pennsylvania. He took up residence in Greensburg, Pennsylvania in Westmoreland County in a hilltop dwelling that would be known as Stokes Mansion. It sat on the property of the Jennings Farm which would later be purchased by the Sisters of Charity where they would charter their new school, now known as Seton Hill University. It was during his time in Greensburg that Stokes read an article written by a young telegraph operator by the name of Andrew Carnegie on the subject of people's attitudes toward Stokes' client, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Stokes invited Carnegie to visit and spend the night at his mansion. In his autobiography, Carnegie writes of Stokes: > I had never spent a night in a strange house in my life until Mr. Stokes of > Greensburg, chief counsel of the Pennsylvania Railroad, invited me to his > beautiful home in the country to pass a Sunday. It was an odd thing for Mr. > Stokes to do, for I could little interest a brilliant and educated man like > him. The reason for my receiving such an honor was a communication I had > written for the \\"Pittsburgh Journal.\\" It was the \\"grandeur\\" of Stokes' private library, the first private library Andrew Carnegie had ever seen, that partially inspired the public libraries Carnegie established in later years. Carnegie writes: > The grandeur of Mr. Stokes's home impressed me, but the one feature of it > that eclipsed all else was a marble mantel in his library. In the center of > the arch, carved in the marble, was an open book with this inscription: \\"He > that cannot reason is a fool,He that will not a bigot,He that dare not a > slave.\\" These noble words thrilled me. I said to myself, \\"Some day, some > day, I'll have a library\\" (that was a look ahead) \\"and these words shall > grace the mantel as here.\\" And so they do in New York and Skibo to-day. After the purchase of the property by the Sisters of Charity, the mansion was used as a Mother House for the sisters. The mansion was later turned into Saint Mary's School for boys. The building still stands today on Seton Hill University's campus, though it has undergone many changes and uses, and is known as St. Mary Hall. Civil War service Stokes later served as a major in the U.S. Infantry during the American Civil War, including a period in 1861 commanding at the 18th U.S. Infantry Headquarters, Camp Thomas, Franklin County, Ohio.\\"William Axton Stokes Papers.\\" University of Delaware Library, Special Collections Department. http://www.lib.udel.edu/ud/spec/findaids/stokes.htm. His stirring speech, at the Union Convention of Westmoreland County, PA in 1861, was delivered in support of the united American Republic and in favor of the war to crush rebellion. He denied the rebel cause by systematically positing that the rebel states have no right of secession, no grounds for revolution, and no justifiable argument against Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency.Speech of Maj.

The Special Collections at Villanova University contains some of Stokes's personal papers as well as other donations of the Stokes family to the university. A small collection of Stokes documents can also be found in the Special Collections Department at the University of Delaware Library.  Personal life  Stokes was married twice, once to Mary Scanlan (b. 1815 - d. 1848) and later to Nancy Williams (b. 1821 Greensburg, PA - d. 1894). He died on May 3, 1877 in Philadelphia and is buried at Saint John the Evangelist Church Cemetery.  Inspiration in later times  In 2018, James Bosco, assistant professor of hospitality and tourism at Seton Hill University which sits on the land formerly owned by Stokes, opened a tapas restaurant in Greensburg bearing the name Major Stokes.

Most early troops were sent from France, but localization after the growth of the colony meant that, by the 1690s, many were volunteers from the settlers of New France, and by the 1750s most troops were descendants of the original French inhabitants. Additionally, many of the early troops and officers who were born in France remained in the colony after their service ended, contributing to generational service and a military elite. The French built a series of forts from Newfoundland to Louisiana and others captured from the British during the 1600s to the late 1700s. Some were a mix of military post and trading forts. Military strategy The soldiers of New France were either exceptionally well trained and very apt to the challenges of the colonial frontier, or they were dangerously inept. Most of the military consisted of habitant militia rather than actual French soldiers. Upon their arrival, the soldiers of New France learned quickly that the traditional military techniques seen on the battlefields of Europe were not at all effective in the New World. The Iroquois attacks on the French forced them to adapt to their current situation. Luckily the French were experts on forging alliances with the Native people and with the help from their allies the French adopted what they called \\"la petite guerre\\". This was essentially small-scale guerrilla warfare that allowed the French to harass and cripple targets slowly over time rather than engage in battle after battle, something that New France could not afford. The strategy consisted mostly of stealth and surprise attacks whose purpose lied in creating ambushes and raids and followed by immediate withdrawals from the battlefield. This strategy focused on the elimination of small groups of targets rather than capturing targets of strategic value.Horn, Bernd. The Canadian Way of War: Serving the National Interest. Toronto, ON, CAN: Dundurn Group, 2006. In addition this style of warfare was not only well suited to the North American wilderness but it also allowed the French troops to be at a vast numerical disadvantage (outnumbered sometimes 20 to 1) and still effectively retaliate against their enemies, primarily the British.Nester, William R. The French And Indian War And The Conquest Of New France. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2014. pp. 1‚Äì7 Ironically, the fact that most of the soldiers were in fact habitant militia men actually aided in the ability to fight using these strategies given that many of these men would have been hunters and would already be accustomed to hunting and stalking in forests. Indigenous relations  =Indigenous allies= It was the job of the military to maintain good relations with frontier Indigenous North Americans in order to preserve French interests in the colony. In fact, preserving a positive relationship between the French and Native Peoples was the most important of the duties that were given to the military. Throughout the years the French developed ties with several Native tribes, those allies consisted mainly of the Abenakis, Algonquin, Huron, Montagnais, and Outaouais and through their partnership they taught the French much more than just military strategy. They taught them how to hunt, fish and dress their catches and they taught them how to navigate and essentially survive in the unforgiving Canadian wilderness. The French soldiers relied heavily on the Native warriors but their allegiance came at a cost. The Natives were \\"self interested and attached themselves only to the one who gives them the most‚Ä¶ and if they failed to be rewarded one single time, the good that was done for them before counts for nothing\\".Charles de Raymond. and Joseph L. Peyser. and Joseph L. Peyser. On the eve of conquest: the Chevalier de Raymond's critique of New France in 1754 . East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1997. pp. 55 In addition, the Natives as tribes provided knowledge of the wilderness but the tribes themselves were not active in their wars as a whole. Native warriors participated in the French battles if they chose to do so usually under the arrangement that they would be compensated for their participation. Falling short on these agreements sometimes caused great discourse amongst the Natives and sometimes damaged French-Native relationships. =Decadence amongst the soldiers= Part of the job of the military was to create good trade relations with the Natives. New France relied heavily on the fur trade given that it was the only valuable commodity in the entire colony, which cost more to operate than it brought in, in profit.Nester, William R. The French And Indian War And The Conquest Of New France. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2014. However, much of the military hierarchy was not based on merit but rather on internal family connections, which allowed unqualified young ambitious and greedy men to take positions of high rank. This resulted in many soldiers leaving their post for weeks at a time in order to illegally trade with the Natives. The Natives had an understanding of how the trading system worked and considered the military as \\"trading-goods chiefs\\"Charles de Raymond. and Joseph L. Peyser. and Joseph L. Peyser. On the eve of conquest: the Chevalier de Raymond's critique of New France in 1754 . East Lansing: Michigan State University Press, 1997. and because of their dereliction of duty came to recognize many soldiers as dishonest people who went against their code. In addition there were even times where the presents the king would send to keep friendly relations with the Natives were often taken and sold to them for profit instead, the only presents they would give them would be mere trinkets. Therefore, the lack of discipline amongst some of the higher ups resulted in losing face amidst the natives and subsequently losing some of their business and their allegiance to the English.

She started playing the piano at an early age and switched to oboe when joining the junior high school band; because of her surname's place in alphabetical order, she was the last person able to choose an instrument, and the only other one available was the oboe. She attended high school at the North Carolina School of the Arts, received bachelor's and master's degrees from the Manhattan School of Music, and a masters in communication from Stanford University, which she attended on a full tuition fellowship. She also attended Columbia University. Career Tindall spent 23 years as a professional musician in New York City, playing with such groups as the New York Philharmonic, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, presenting a critically acclaimed solo debut at Carnegie Recital Hall, and earning a jazz Grammy nomination.

She went on to write for The New York Times, Agence France-Presse, the Los Angeles Times, Sierra, The Sydney Morning Herald, and the International Herald Tribune. In 2005, she published Mozart in the Jungle: Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music (Atlantic Monthly Press), a memoir of her experiences in the classical music world, which National Public Radio named one of the top five arts stories of the year. Her book was also lauded by musicologist Richard Taruskin in The New Republic as \\"the smartest take on [the classical music] situation\\". In 2014, the book was adapted for an Amazon Studios web video series of the same name. The pilot was written by Roman Coppola, Jason Schwartzman, and Alex Timbers, and directed by Paul Weitz. The series stars Lola Kirke, Malcolm McDowell, Saffron Burrows, Bernadette Peters, and Gael Garcia Bernal. Personal life Tindall married Bill Nye on February 3, 2006. The ceremony was performed by Rick Warren at The Entertainment Gathering at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles. Yo-Yo Ma provided the music. Nye left the relationship, having the marriage annulled, seven weeks later when the marriage license was declared invalid; he later filed for a restraining order. In 2007, Nye obtained a restraining order against Tindall after she broke into his house, stole several items including his laptop, which she used to send defamatory emails impersonating him, and damaged his garden with herbicide. Tindall acknowledged killing his plants but denied being a threat to him.https://www.tmz.com/2007/11/19/the-science-guy-wants-to- send-wife-to-the-moon/ After violating the order in 2009, Tindall was ordered to pay $57,000 of Nye's legal expenses.

'72 Live! in D√ºsseldorf is the final entirely new album released to date by krautrock band Neu!. It was recorded on 6 May 1972 at the congregation hall of St. Maria Unter Dem Kreuz. Despite the title, it is not a live album in any conventional sense, but instead is a transcription of a cassette tape recording of a rehearsal session. In the liner notes, Klaus Dinger described the recording as a \\"non-public test/self-audition with Eberhard Kranemann for a series of 6/7 concerts later in '72\\". The sound quality of the tape and the resulting CD is generally regarded as poor, with clearly audible tape hiss and distortion. Overview During the 1990s, the first three Neu! albums were available on CD on Germanafon Records, a dubious label allegedly based in Luxembourg who specialized in unauthorized and illegal reissues (bootlegs) of otherwise unavailable Krautrock albums. Germanofon managed to get a number of their releases, including the three Neu! albums, into mainstream distribution. According to Michael Rother's account, Dinger released the previous album, Neu! 4 \\"in an act of despair, so he says\\" in late 1995 as a response to the bootlegs without Rother's input, knowledge or consent. Rother, writing in March 2007, described this experience as \\"a rather painful disaster between Klaus Dinger and myself\\". The release of Neu! 4 exacerbated the disagreements between Rother and Dinger, which prevented an official CD release of the three classic Neu! albums until 2001. Despite this Dinger went ahead with the release of Neu! '72 Live in D√ºsseldorf in 1996, once again without consulting Rother, further infuriating his former partner in Neu! The CD was issued by the Japanese label Captain Trip Records. A 2000 agreement between Rother and Dinger to finally reissue the first three albums on CD on Astralwerks in the U.S. and Gr√∂nland Records in the U.K. called for Neu! '72 Live! In D√ºsseldorf to be recalled. It has been out of print since then. In 2010, the recordings were released again in the Neu! Vinyl Box released by Gr√∂nland Records. The recordings were heavily edited and remixed by Michael Rother and included as the bonus maxi-single; 6 May 72 - Non-Public Test. Reception Reviews for this album are almost unanimous in disparaging it. For example, Stewart Mason, writing for AllMusic, stated, in part: Rother and many Neu! fans who support his point of view do not consider Neu! 72 Live! In D√ºsseldorf to be a real Neu! album.

(; Pinyin: M√†i L√¨h√©; Foochow Romanized: MƒÉh L√©-hu√≤; February 7, 1824 - August 18, 1907) was an American missionary who made pioneer contributions to the Methodist Episcopal missions in China, Japan and Korea.  Life  = Early life = Robert Samuel Maclay was born on February 7, 1824 in Concord, Pennsylvania, one of nine children. His parents, Robert Maclay and Arabella Erwin Maclay, ran a tanning business in the local community. His father, a respected member of the Democratic Party, was raised up in the Presbyterian faith but became actively involved in the Methodist Episcopal Church, dedicating himself to spreading the Gospel, his mother an immigrant from the north of Ireland who shared her husband's religious devotion. Maclay entered Dickinson College in the fall of 1841 and was elected into the Belles Lettres Society. As a college student he was highly influenced by his professor Rev. John McClintock. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree on July 10, 1845, and at his graduation he presented a commencement speech entitled The Rule and End of Life. Later Maclay received his Master's degree was subsequently honored with a Doctor of Divinity. One year after his graduation, Maclay was ordained in the Baltimore Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Maclay's ministry within the United States was brief. Throughout the 1840s, many American churches experienced a growing concern for the expansion of mission work overseas, and at that time the Methodist Episcopal Church suffered a split into two conferences due to the controversial issue over slavery. Maclay avoided the internal struggle of the Church and responded to the overseas mission call. On September 10, 1847, he was appointed as a missionary to Foochow, China. = Life among the Chinese = On October 12, 1847, Maclay, together with another Methodist missionary Rev. Henry Hickok, boarded the \\"Paul Jones\\" and set sail for China. They arrived in Foochow on April 12 the next year, reinforcing the mission work that had been commenced by Revs. Moses Clark White and Judson Dwight Collins. On July 10, 1850, Maclay and Henrietta Caroline Sperry were married in Hong Kong by Bishop George Smith. The newly wedded couple returned on August 14 to the mission field in Foochow, and the next year they had their first child Eleanor Henrietta Maclay. The Maclays had five sons and three daughters in total, four of whom died at a young age. right In their first years in China the Mission was slow in progress, faced with strong enmity and plagued with health problems. For ten years after the arrival of the first Methodists to Foochow, not a single convert was won. And of the twelve missionaries that had been sent before 1851 only the Maclays remained in the field by 1854; others had either died or returned to America. While the first years were primarily preparatory, significant achievements were made, however, in the educational work. By May 1849, three days schools for boys were founded, each with an attendance of twenty pupils. In December 1850, Mrs. Maclay opened the first mission school for girls, which employed a native teacher to teacher lessons in reading, writing, singing, geography, and arithmetic, by incorporating Bible stories, Christian doctrines and hymns. These schools were successful not only in providing education, but also in improving the relationship between the Chinese and the Methodist missionaries. Shortly after the establishment of schools, Maclay and other missionaries purchased premises in and outside Foochow for use as chapels. Eventually, these missionaries acquired a level of fluency which permitted them to preach in the local vernacular. On August 3, 1856, the first Methodist church in East Asia, the Church of the True God (), was erected at Iongtau (); and on October 18 the same year, the second church was built on the south bank of River Min, the Church of Heavenly Peace (). On July 14, 1857, Maclay baptized the first Chinese convert connected with the Methodist Episcopal Mission, a 47-year-old man named Ting Ang (). While in China Maclay published two books: Life Among the Chinese with Characteristic Sketches and Incidents of Missionary Operations and Prospects in China (1861) and an Alphabetic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Foochow Dialect that he completed with Rev. C. C. Baldwin (1870). * (Original from the New York Public Library) * (Original from the University of California) * (Original from Harvard University) = Missionary work in Japan and Korea = In 1871, Maclay returned to the United States and was appointed superintendent of the newly founded mission in Japan. Maclay arrived in Yokohama on June 12, 1873 and immediately set about learning the Japanese language and seeking converts. He became an integral part of the Wesleyan mission in Japan, helping to found and serve as first president of the Anglo-Japanese College (now the Aoyama Gakuin) in Tokyo. While serving in Japan, Maclay was asked to travel to Korea to survey the possibility of a Methodist mission there. In June, 1884, Maclay made a brief visit to Seoul, where he acquired the permission of the king to begin medical and educational mission work. He declined leadership of the mission, though, and returned to Yokohama. = Retirement = Maclay retired from the mission field in 1887 and returned to San Fernando in California. He became the dean of the Maclay School of Theology (named for his brother Senator Charles Maclay), and spent the rest of his life as an educator. Maclay died on August 18, 1907 in Los Angeles, California. = Family life = Maclay had been married twice. On July 10, 1850 he was married to Henrietta Caroline Sperry in Hong Kong; on June 6, 1882 he was married secondly to Sarah Ann Barr in San Francisco. There were no children out of his second marriage. His youngest son Edgar Stanton Maclay (1863‚Äì1919) was a historian. His brother Charles Maclay was a state senator of California. His nephews included Judge Robert Maclay Widney, a founder of the University of Southern California, and Dr. Joseph Widney, the second president of the University of Southern California.

He and fellow CIM missionary, Dr. Rupert Clark, were the last foreign missionaries to leave China in 1953 following the takeover of the Communist Party of China in 1949. Their wives, Wilda Matthews and Jeanette Clarke, had been allowed to leave with other missionaries before. Rev. Robert Arthur Mathews ‚ÄúShima Liang Zhen‚Äù was born February 4, 1912 in China. He was the son of CIM missionary/ sinologist Robert Henry (Australia) and Annie Ethel (Smith) (New South Wales) Mathews. Annie Smith Mathews was also a CIM missionary. Arthur spent his childhood in China, but grew to manhood as a farm hand in Australia. His mother died on the field and he was first not accepted by China Inland Mission because of that event. He persisted and in 1936, he attended Melbourne Bible Institute in preparation for mission work. He arrived in China in 1938. From 1943 to 1946, he was a major with the 12th Frontier Force Regiment in the British Indian Army during World War II. The regimental center was in the town of Sialkot, in what is now Pakistan, but then it was known as Punjab. He was influenced by the leaders of the Punjab Prayer Union and the prayers of Praying Hyde as a revival had broken out there at the turn of the century. He married Wilda Anita Miller was born on October 29, 1909 in Compton, Los Angeles, California. She was the daughter of Alvin Washington (Kansas) and Margaret Maude (Eastman) (Wisconsin) Miller. Their daughter Lilah was named after Wilda‚Äôs younger sister. Wilda went to Biola College in California in the early ‚Äô30. After twelve years in China, the China Inland Mission assigned the Mathews ‚Äúto teach Christianity‚Äù to the Mongolian people. He studied Mongolian for a year at Lanchow. Just the year before they returned, in 1949, the Chinese Civil War ended and the People's Republic of China came into power. They knew the country was now under communist rule, but they didn't know what that would entail. The Chinese church had invited them to come, with the approval of the Communist government. ‚ÄúHwangyuan, Tsinghai is the crossroads in the north‚Äù, says Arthur, in the February 1, 1951, China‚Äôs Millions, ‚ÄúIt is the import center with Tibetans coming here from roads reaching through Lhassa and on to India. All the Mongols from the areas to the north and west of Kokonor were expansion routes for the Gospel.‚Äù He closes the article with a prayer, ‚ÄúPrayer that we may be ready to tread in the road open for us, no matter how great the cost and that Christ may be glorified in Mongols being saved.‚Äù The Chinese version of Micah 2:13 declares, ‚ÄúThe Road Opener goes before them.‚Äù They felt this was a miraculously opened door God would have them go through. At their arrival, the Chinese Christians were noticeably fearful of their political situation, and following their arrival, the Chinese pastors informed Arthur and Wilda that they would not be allowed to evangelize during their stay in Hwangyuan. As time went on, they were not allowed visit homes and preach within the city. Eventually, they were not allowed outside of the missionary complex, or even distribute of medicine. After recovering from his shock and dismay, Arthur came up with an idea to start a Mongol Gospel Inn for traveling Mongolians. The building was rented, renovated, with new floor board and complete with Gospel posters in Tibetan, Moslem, and Chinese, when just before the opening day, Arthur discovered that Chinese troops moved in, taking over the nicely cleaned and painted structure. There was nothing he could do to salvage his enterprise. Arthur protested, but soon found it would have been wiser to have said nothing. In two days a policeman came to the mission compound to announce that no one there could do village work without permission, and the white people were forbidden everything. The China Inland Mission organization advised all their missionaries to evacuate communist China (At that time there were 601 adults and 284 children participating). They finally decided that since they were more of a hindrance than a help, they would apply for exit visas. They thought, since the government did not want them, they would be allowed to leave quickly. Arthur and Wilda with daughter Lilah, applied for their exit permits on January 3, 1951, but they were denied. While hundreds of other missionaries were leaving for the safety of the China Inland Mission's headquarters in Singapore, the Mathews, their daughter, and a handful of other missionaries were detained in the North to be abused, accused, starved, and emotionally tortured. Arthur was summoned to the police station and asked to sign a statement that he was for world peace. He had heard of another missionary having to sign some document before leaving, so he signed without thinking much of it. The government official then asked what contribution Arthur was then willing to make toward world peace, outlining a plan in which Arthur would go to India and essentially be a Communist spy. Arthur realized that the Communist definition of world peace was a world dominated by communism, and of course could not consent. A government official called Arthur in and promised his exit visas if he would do something for them, like write a report of five other missionaries. At first Arthur did write glowing reports of the missionaries in question, but someone told him he dare not turn that in: the Communists would change what he had written but keep his signature. So Arthur threw his report in the fire and told the official he could not be a Judas. The official then told him that he could have given him a pass, if he had cooperated, but now a charge had been laid against him which must be investigated, and ‚Äúinvestigations take a long time.‚Äù Thus began a two and a half year ordeal. Their provisions from their mission were frozen by the government, which made Arthur submit a report of what he would need, and then they doled out to him much less than what the report said he needed. Every victory they mentioned in a letter seemed to be immediately challenged by the enemy of their souls: once when they wrote what a blessing Lilah was, she then came down with scarlet fever, and they almost lost her. All of them had turns being ill. Eventually they were told that no one could speak to them, and they could only leave home to draw water from the creek and get food. They had to trust that the Lord was in control and had them there for a reason, though it was hard to discern that reason when they were so restricted. Yet the Lord did use them even when they could not speak to the people. The few weeks they had had to minister before restrictions set in, people knew their hearts and saw their love. ‚ÄúWe have His promise,‚Äù said Arthur, ‚ÄúWe are not the prey of the terrible. We are the prisoners of the Lord Jesus Christ‚Äîjust lent to evil men to show forth the abundance of His power! Our days are on deposit with Him; let Him hand them out to use as He will.‚Äù When the Mathews could no longer speak openly, the people saw them in tattered clothes, persecuted, attacked by illness without much medical aid, laughed at, jeered, humiliated, doing menial, degrading work just to survive, tantalized by the government offering release and then not giving it or doling out money that was theirs in the first place. They saw the Lord provide miraculously for them in many ways. But the six missionaries in Hwalung, including the Clarkes and the Mathews, were not allowed to go. Eventually he was put in jail, but imagine his delight when he found a fellow missionary in the opposite cell! They were brought to trial facing strange accusations and as punishment were ‚Äúeternally and everlastingly‚Äù expelled from China forever. They were the last two missionaries to leave China Miraculously, in God's timing, all the CIM missionaries got out without a single one being martyred, the last being Arthur Mathews. They bore witness to the reality of Christ in their lives. They came through suffering so that other would learn. Not mistakes‚Äîno surprises from God‚Äôs hand. Following Arthur‚Äôs release from captivity in China in July of 1953, Arthur Mathews sailed on August 11 for Vancouver, British Columbia and was reunited with Wilda and daughter, Lilah. After their return, Arthur and Wilda ran the CIM mission home in Chicago. Many of the Moody students attended the prayer meetings and enjoyed the fellowship and invaluable teaching in their home. Arthur became the OMF/CIM United States Midwest Director from 1955-1964. The Mathews served at the headquarters from 1964-1970 as Candidate Secretary and from 1971-1974 as Public Relations Secretary. Arthur also served on the board of Colombia Bible College from 1964 to 1973. From 1969 to 1977 he was editor of the mission magazine, East Asia Millions. Arthur wrote a book entitled, Born for Battle, which is a collection of articles written originally as editorials in East Asia Millions, the Overseas Missionary Fellowship‚Äôs magazine. His book was an examination of the spiritual battle for God‚Äôs soldiers. Arthur writes, ‚ÄúThe thing that we need to be afraid of today is that the spirit that produces world trends should invade Christ‚Äôs mighty army and argue us off the offensive into a compromised coexistence with the world‚Äôs attitudes‚Äîso that we end up like the world, taking lessons in French and practicing d√©tente.‚Äù ‚ÄúI fought long and hard for my Lord, and through it all I have kept true to Him; and now the time has come for me to stop fighting and rest‚Äù (2 Timothy 4:7) The Lord trained him throughout his lifetime of experiences and tests, to face his final battle ‚Äì the suffering and wasting of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig‚Äôs disease). The Born for Battle book was released just after Arthur went home to be with his Lord. ‚ÄúArthur Mathews was indeed a man born for battle with penetrating insight,‚Äù wrote Dr. Alan Redpath, Pastor of the Moody Church. Arthur went Home to be with the Lord on July 29, 1978 at the age of 66 with ‚ÄúBorn for Battle‚Äù on his tombstone. Wilda went home to be with the Lord on September 13, 1988. Both are buried with a host of other Overseas Missionary Fellowship missionaries and workers at the Mellinger Mennonite Cemetery in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

It is one of the largest regeneration projects currently in the UK. It is a public-private funded project. The site currently has a 50-metre (164 ft) Olympic standard swimming pool, an ice rink and a white water canoeing and kayaking centre. Upon completion, an indoor snow centre with real snow for skiing and snowboarding, and a hotel were also planned. Other proposals included a 220-metre (722 ft) observation tower and a super-casino, although both these schemes are unlikely to ever be realised. The sporting facilities were used as a training venue for the London 2012 Olympics along with the Millennium Stadium, which hosted some of the football. In 2019, Cardiff Council approved a new ten year masterplan for the International Sports Village site with plans for around 1,000 new apartments, bars, restaurants and leisure facilities. History of the site 200px In the early part of the 19th century Welsh coal was in much demand throughout the world. Cardiff was the centre of this export trade, but it was under the control of the Bute family. In 1859, the Taff Vale Railway Company created a series of wharves in the mouth of the river Ely. By 1898 the site had a chain ferry (right) which gave Ferry Road its name. A subway was also created for dockers to travel to the site. The Railway public house, named because of the criss cross of tracks over the site became known as the Red House. This well known inn was used as a beacon to navigate sea going craft until its recent demolition. When the barrage was completed, the site became prime real estate again with a freshwater lake on the shore. This would eventually become the Cardiff International Sports Village.

The reason for the split was not disclosed by either party. In spite of this setback however the council remained committed to the project; in order to kick start progress they invited private companies to submit their own proposals for individual development plots, so long as these fulfil the broad aims of the council in terms of specific sport and leisure provision.Orion pull out This marks a change of direction from the top down approach that was originally envisaged for the project, in which private companies were brought in to build and operate leisure and sports facilities predetermined by the council.

He is known for his exhaustive study of the Machin stamps, the British definitive series in use since 1967. His catalogue, The Complete Deegam Machin Handbook, is one of the main reference books about this series.  Life  Myall was born in Essex on 17 December 1922. A civil servant, he finished his career at the trademark registry of the Patent Office. He became interested in stamps while working at the office of the Inspector of Foreign Dividends, where he kept stamps from the incoming mail. In the 1950s and 1960s, he collected the Wilding stamps, the first definitives of Queen Elizabeth II's reign. At the same time, he was working at the Inland Revenue and studied security printing that had been helping him in his philatelic activities. His first articles had been published in philatelic press. From their commencement, in 1967, Myall collected Machins and was a founding member of two specialised clubs; the Great Britain Decimal Stamp Book Study Circle (GB DSB SC) and the British Decimal Stamps Study Circle (BDSSC), being the founding president of the BDSSC, a position he held for 18 years. The two study circles merged to form the Modern British Philatelic Circle (MBPC) in 2006. He was not content with the way BDSSC and the Stanley Gibbons catalogue were handling the potential criteria to study Machin stamps. He therefore decided to write his own catalogue, with an aspiration to be as exhaustive and precise as possible. The Complete Deegam Machin Handbook was first published in 1993. This was followed by a second and a third edition, the latter being published in July 2003. A CD-ROM version of the third edition was introduced in 2005, and a fourth edition available on CD-ROM only was published in April 2010. It was regularly updated by the Deegam Reports sent by e-mail to book owners and printed for their members by some philatelic associations. Aside from the Machins, Douglas Myall collected British perfins on covers and practised macro photography of insects. Myall's wife, Kathleen, died in 2014. They had two daughters, Delia and Fiona.

At that time, the three original teams in the league: the Cardinals, Caseys & Odeons played out of Optimist Park before it was decided they needed to do something about the need for more playing space. In true Calgary form, volunteers from the community stepped forward and offered to construct a major league size park on City land. The main sponsor and benefactor was Jim Wilfley, with able assistance from other sports enthusiasts such as Hank Bassen, Gem-Sod, Alberta Treasury Branch, Coca-Cola, Conmac and others. The park was built on traditional ball park lines with wooden fences, stands and a press box. The project was started in the Fall of 1982 and finished in August 1984. The entire facility was built with donated labor and funding. The league opened for play, debt free, thanks to the dedicated generosity of its sponsors. The first president was Ron McCartney. Glen Hansen took over in 1982. Many people over the years have contributed their volunteer efforts to keep the league going. In 1991, the facility was partially destroyed by a fire set by vandals.

The play was a success, running for about 100 performances and enjoying tours and several revivals.

The text notes that \\"An incident in the First Act was suggested by George Eliot's Novel Silas Marner\\". Background Gilbert and Sullivan had already produced their hit one-act comic opera Trial by Jury by the time Dan'l Druce was written, but both Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan were still producing a considerable amount of work separately. The comic actor Edward Sothern had contacted Gilbert, in April 1875, noting that he was taking over the management of the Haymarket Theatre and needed a play for December, though Sothern did not plan to appear in the play. Gilbert was unable to complete the play on time and asked for an extension.Ainger, p. 117 Sothern then left to go on tour in America and wrote to Gilbert to be ready with another play by October, this time to feature him in a serious role.Ainger, pp. 119‚Äì20 That play, The Ne'er-do-Weel, was also late and did not open until 1878.Stedman, pp. 137‚Äì38 Hermann Vezin took the title role in Dan'l Druce in a cast featuring Johnston Forbes-Robertson and the 19-year-old Marion Terry as Dorothy.Ainger, pp. 123‚Äì24 The title character was originally called Jonas Marple, but Gilbert changed the name to one less closely identifiable with George Eliot's Silas Marner (published in 1861), first to Abel Druce and then to Dan'l Druce.Knapp. Gilbert retained the name Jonas Marple for Druce's earlier self before the action of the play He also changed the character's occupation from weaver to blacksmith, and altered Eliot's story to make Druce the true father of the child who is left at his house in place of his stolen gold. Bits of Dan'l Druce would echo in later operas. For instance, one of Reuben's speeches, beginning \\"I will so coll thee, coax thee, cosset thee, court thee, cajole thee, with deftly turned compliment, pleasant whimsy, delicate jest and tuneful madrigal\\" has similarities with Jack Point's speech in Act II of The Yeomen of the Guard.Stedman, p. 141 Elements of the characters of Dorothy and Geoffrey are later seen in Rose Maybud and Richard Dauntless in Ruddigore.Dan'l Druce at the G&S; Archive The play ran for 119 performances and enjoyed tours in Britain and America and revivals, achieving reasonable popularity, and even gaining a burlesque parody, Dan'l Tra-Duced, Tinker, by Arthur Clements.Stedman, pp. 142‚Äì43 Synopsis Hermann Vezin in the title role Dan'l is a miser and a drunkard whose wife has eloped. Two deserters from the Battle of Worcester seek shelter at his house. They send him to buy food and steal his money, then run off, leaving at his cottage a baby girl with a note that says that his gold has taken the form of the baby. Fourteen years later, Dan'l is a blacksmith. The villains return, but Dan'l does not want to surrender the now-teenaged girl. Ultimately, she stays with Dan'l and marries her young sweetheart.

Most of his professional life he spent in Scotland at the courts of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her son James VI. While in Scotland, he was embroiled in marriage projects and several upheavals. In 1568-1569 he was sent on a special embassy to Russia, visiting the court of Ivan the Terrible. Randolph was also a Member of Parliament: for New Romney in 1558, Maidstone 1584, 1586 and 1589, Grantham 1559 and St Ives 1558 and 1572. Exile in France Thomas Randolph was born in 1523, the son of Avery Randolph of Badlesmere, Kent. He entered Christ Church, Oxford at the time of its foundation, and graduated B.A. in October 1545, and B.C.L. in 1548. Shortly afterwards he became a public notary; and in 1549 he was made principal of Broadgates Hall (now Pembroke College), Oxford. He continued there until 1553, when the Protestant persecutions under Queen Mary compelled him to resign and retire to France. Sir James Melville refers to Randolph's indebtedness to him \\"during his banishment in France\\"; Randolph seems to have mainly resided in Paris, where he was still living as a scholar in April 1557. It was probably during his stay in Paris that he came under the influence of George Buchanan, to whom, in a letter to Peter Young, tutor of James VI, he refers in very eulogistic terms as his 'master'. Among his fellow-students and intimates in Paris was Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange. In the service of Elizabeth I Soon after the accession of Elizabeth, in 1558, Randolph was acting as an agent of the English government in Germany, but in a few months returned to England; and, probably soon afterwards, bought a farm in Kent--\\"the house where he was born\\". Doubtless his acquaintance with the Scottish Protestants in Paris suggested to Elizabeth the employment of Randolph in the task of bringing the Earl of Arran, who had been compelled to flee from France, from Geneva to England. =In Scotland= Under the name of Barnabie, and using the codename Pamphilus he was also sent in the autumn of 1559 to secretly conduct James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran into Scotland.'Zurich Letters', (1842), 56-57 citings Forbes, 'Full View', ii,(1740) He left for London on 25 November, but was again sent to Scotland in March 1560, where his representations had considerable influence in encouraging the Protestants against the queen-regent, and in effecting an understanding between them and Elizabeth. The success of his mission suggested his continuance in Scotland as the confidential agent of Elizabeth; but being an ardent Protestant, he was as well a representative of William Cecil, Elizabeth's secretary of state, as of the Queen. Although by no means a match for Maitland of Lethington as a diplomatist, the fact that he possessed the confidence of the Protestant party enabled him to exercise no small influence in Scottish politics. His numerous letters are among the most valuable sources of information for this period; they abound in interesting details regarding the Queen of Scots and her court, and the political plots and social intrigues.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5, (1907), 375, sums up his Scottish career. Mary, Queen of Scots, c.1558-1560 In the autumn of 1562 Randolph accompanied the Queen of Scots, who meanwhile professed for him a warm friendship, in the expedition to the north of Scotland which resulted in the defeat and death of George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly; and he even took part in the campaign, \\"being ashamed to sit still where so many were occupied\\". In January 1563 he went to Castle Campbell in Fife to the wedding of James Stewart, Commendator of Inchcolm and Margaret Campbell. Randolph had hoped to meet James MacConnel at the wedding.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1603, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 678. =Marriage negotiations with Mary, Queen of Scots= In June 1563 he obtained license to go to England on private business; but on 20 April 1563 he was again sent to Scotland with the special aim of entangling the Scottish queen in negotiations for an English marriage: In 1563, Elizabeth suggested Lord Robert Dudley, her own favourite, as a consort to Mary, whom she thus hoped to neutralise by a marriage to an Englishman. Ambassador Randolph tried his best to further the project, which was strongly advocated by Cecil, many of whose instructions to Randolph survive. At first Mary was not enthusiastic; however, when it became clear, that Elizabeth would declare Mary her official heir on condition that she marry Dudley, the proposal was taken very seriously on the Scottish part. In September 1564 Elizabeth bestowed on Dudley the earldom of Leicester to make him more acceptable to Mary. In the beginning of 1565, Mary accepted the proposal at last.Chamberlin pp. 151-152 To the amazement of Randfolph, however, Leicester was not to be moved to comply with the proposal: > But a man of that nature I never found any...he whom I go about to make as > happy as ever was any, to put him in possession of a kingdom, to make him > Prince of a mighty people, to lay in his naked arms a most fair and worthy > lady...nothing regardeth the good that shall ensue unto him thereby...but so > uncertainly dealeth that I know not where to find him.Chamberlin p. 158 Dudley indeed had made it clear to the Scots at the beginning of the affair, that he was not a candidate for Mary's hand, and forthwith had behaved with passive resistance. This Randolph had repeatedly tried to overcome by his letters.Chamberlin pp. 143-144, 151-152, 158 Elizabeth herself now had second thoughts regarding declarations concerning the succession. But as Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley became a serious candidate for Mary's marriage, Elizabeth wanted to prevent it. Randolph again received instructions to press for a marriage \\"with the Earl of Leicester or some other; and if he find it so far passed as it cannot be revoked, then he shall...declare, how much it shall miscontent her Majesty\\".Chamberlin p. 158-159 Randolph had time to report on a Roman antiquity discovered near Edinburgh at Musselburgh where there was an inscribed altar and a hypocaust.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1569, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 144. He was fond of Mary Beaton, one of Mary, Queen of Scots, companions. In April 1565 Beaton and Randolph teamed up to play bowls with the queen and Lord Darnley at Stirling Castle. They won, and Darnley gave Beaton a ring and a brooch with two agates worth fifty crowns.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 142. One of Randolph's Scottish contacts, Alexander Clark sent him a letter teasing him about their relationship in a joke using nonsense words; \\"And as to your mistress Marie Beton, she is both darimpus and sclenbrunit, and you in like manner without contrebaxion or kylteperante, so you are both worth little money.\\"Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1569, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), p. 148. Randolph, to his utter chagrin,Chamberlin pp. 445-447 could not prevent the marriage of Beaton to Lord Darnley, yet after the marriage, he declined to recognise Darnley's authority. His representations and promises were mainly responsible for the rebellion of James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, known as the Chaseabout Raid. On 14 February 1566 Randolph wrote to the Earl of Leicester that he was unable and unwilling to commit his opinions on Mary's actions on paper for fear of appearing \\"malicieus foolyshe and unadvised\\".V. Smith, 'Perspectives on Female Monarchy', in J. Daybell & S. Norrhem, Gender and Political Culture in Early Modern Europe (Abingdon, 2017), 152. In February 1566 he was accused by Mary of having assisted Moray and her rebellious subjects with a gift of three thousand crowns, and was required to quit the country within six days. Ultimately he retired to Berwick upon Tweed, and while there he was, after the murder of Riccio, accused by Mary of having written a book against her, called Mr. Randolph's Phantasy. =Embassy to Russia and Scotland= He was recalled to England about June 1566, and apparently it was shortly after his return that he was appointed \\"Master of the King's Post,\\" a position that later became postmaster general. On 2 November 1567 he obtained from Robert Constable an assignment of the office of constable or keeper of the Queenborough Castle and steward of the lordship or manor of Middleton and Merden in the county of Kent. In June 1568, he was sent on a special embassy to Russia in behalf of the English merchants trading in that country; and he succeeded in obtaining from Ivan IV a grant of certain privileges to the merchant adventurers, which led to the formation of the Muscovy Company. He returned from Russia in the autumn of 1569. Following representations made by Regent Moray's agent Nicolas Elphinstone in January 1570 he was sent to Scotland, although uncertain news of the Regent's assassination had reached London.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), pp. 58-61. He remained in Scotland for a year. =Again in France and Scotland= In October 1573 and April 1576 he went on special embassies to France. He was sent to Scotland in February 1578, but too late to prevent the fall of James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. After the imprisonment of Morton in 1580 he returned to Scotland to conduct negotiations on his behalf. At a convention of the estates, held on 20 February 1581, besides presenting a paper declaring the \\"Intention of the Queen's Majesty and her Offers to the King of Scotland', he, in a speech of two hours\\" duration, denounced Esme Stewart, created by the king Duke of Lennox, as an agent of Rome. If anything, however, his bold intervention only helped to seal Morton's fate. Having failed to thwart the purposes of Lennox by a public accusation, he now attempted, with Elizabeth's sanction, to concoct a plot for the seizure of him and the young king; but, the plot having been betrayed, he fled to Berwick, after he had narrowly escaped death from a shot fired into the room he occupied in the provost's house at Edinburgh. Randolph was sent on his last mission to Scotland in January 1586 with instructions for the negotiation of a treaty between the two kingdoms, to which he succeeded in obtaining the signature of James VI. He held the joint offices of Chamberlain of the Exchequer and Master of the Post till his death, which took place in his house in St. Peter's Hill, near Thames Street, London, on 8 June 1590, when he was in his sixty-seventh year. He was buried in the church of St. Peter's, Paul's Wharf. Randolph, during his embassies, was kept very short of money, and had frequent difficulty in paying his expenses. Nor, important as had been his services, did he receive any reward beyond the not very remunerative offices above mentioned. The statement of Wood that he was knighted in 1571 is not supported by any evidence. Randolph is supposed to have been the author of the original short Latin Life of George Buchanan, but this must be regarded as at least doubtful. He took a special interest in the progress of Buchanan's History, and offered his aid with money if necessary towards its completion. =Marriages= Towards the close of 1571, he married Anne Walsingham, sister of Francis Walsingham, and daughter of Thomas Walsingham of Chiselhurst. Before the marriage he received, on 1 October 1571, an assignment from Thomas Walsingham and William Crowner of letters patent of the custody of the manor and hundred of Middleton and Merden, at the rent of 100 pounds per annum, to be paid to his intended wife. In 1572 he obtained the position of Chamberlain of the Exchequer for life. By Anne Walsingham, Randolph had a son, Thomas, who succeeded him. He had also another son, Ambrose, and a daughter, Frances, who married Thomas Fitzgerald. He is said to have married, probably as second wife, Ursula Copinger. His old friend the bachelor George Buchanan teased him about his second marriage in 1572; > If you had been in your right wit, you being once escaped the tempestous > storms and naufrage (shipwreck) of marriage, had never entered again the > same dangers, for I cannot take you for a Stoic philosopher, having one head > inexpugnable (not to be captured) with the frenetic tortures of jealousy, or > a careless heart sceptic that takes cuckoldry as thing indifferent.Ellis, > Henry, ed., Original Letters illustrative of English History, 3rd series, > vol. 3 (London, 1846) pp. 373-375, Buchanan to Randolph, 6 August 1572.

It began life as Kymer's Canal in 1766, which linked pits at Pwll y Llygod to a dock near Kidwelly. Access to the dock gradually became more difficult as the estuary silted up, and an extension to Llanelli was authorised in 1812. Progress was slow, and the new canal was linked to a harbour at Pembrey built by Thomas Gaunt in the 1820s, until the company's own harbour at Burry Port was completed in 1832. Tramways served a number of collieries to the east of Burry Port. In 1832 engineer James Green advised on extending the system, and suggested a line with three inclined planes to reach Cwmmawr, further up the Gwendraeth Valley. Although Green had experience with inclined planes on other canals, he underestimated the cost and could not complete the work. He was sacked in 1836, but the canal company finished the new route the following year. The canal was moderately successful, and shareholders received dividends from 1858. In 1865 the company changed its name to become the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway, amalgamated with the company running Burry Port in the following year, and the canal became the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway in 1869. Kymer's dock at Kidwelly continued to be used for the export of coal by coasters for another 50 years. It was used as a rubbish dump during the 1950s, but together with a short section of the canal was restored in the 1980s. A few of the structures of the canal can still be traced in the landscape, and the route of the now closed railway can be followed for most of its length. History The area around Kidwelly is rich in coal reserves and contains ironstone. It was to exploit these reserves that the canal and tramway system was built. Much of the coal was good quality anthracite, although other grades were also mined. =Kymer's Canal= Thomas Kymer began mining at Pwll y Llygod and Great Forest (near Carway) in 1760, and sought parliamentary approval to construct a canal at his own expense in early 1766. The Act of Parliament was granted on 19 February 1766. The canal was to run from his coal pits at Pwll y Llygod on the banks of the Gwendraeth Fawr river to Ythyn Frenig, about half a mile (0.8 km) to the west of Kidwelly, where he built a dock on the southern bank of the Gwendraeth Fach river. The Act included powers to divert the course of the Gwendraeth Fawr from Pwll y Llygod to Pont Spwdwr, where the Kidwelly to Llanelli turnpike road crossed the river. The canal was operational by May 1768. As built, the canal was about long, and the channel was approximately wide. Wider sections were constructed at Morfa and at Muddlescombe, to allow barges to pass one another, and there was also a wider section below the terminal wharf at Pwll y Llygod, to allow the barges to be turned. From the wharf, a tramway crossed the Gwendraeth Fawr to connect with the coal pits. The canal served the mines well for almost 30 years, but the dock and river were affected by silting. A new channel across the sands was created in 1797, but this too was affected by silting, and by 1809 navigation to Kymer's dock was becoming dangerous. =Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal= A series of meetings took place in 1811 to consider how the situation could be improved. Two engineers, Edward Martin and David Davies, proposed an extension of the canal to the top of the Gwendraeth valley, and another which would cross Pinged marsh and would terminate at Llanelli. This would pass through Pembrey, providing improved access to the harbour. The proposal was adopted, and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company. The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo, and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place. It listed a total of 13 collieries which would be served in this way. Wharfs at the Llanelli terminus would be built next to the dock owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company. Special provision, including the construction of a lock and weir, was made for the point where the new canal would cross the existing Ashburnham Canal. The newly formed company was required to complete the extension from Pwll y Llygod to Pontyates and the first section of the Llanelly branch to the point where it crossed the Ashburnham Canal within six years. Anthony Bower was the engineer, and construction was contracted to Pinkerton and Allen. The canal reached the new aqueduct across the Gwendraeth Fawr in 1815, but little progress was made between then and 1817. Much of the limited capital raised had been spent on attempts to re-open the harbour, with little success. A second Act of Parliament was obtained on 28 May 1818, which extended the time limit for building the canal and removed the requirement to clear the river channels to the harbour. Pinkerton and Allen pressed on with construction, completing the routes to Pontyates and the Ashburnham Canal crossing in 1824, while the company directors asked the engineers John Rennie and Edward Bankes to examine the issue of a suitable harbour. Rennie suggested extending the canal towards what is now Burry Port, and the construction of a new harbour on the sands at Tywyn Bach. =Pembrey Canal= While Pinkerton and Allen were building the southern extension, Thomas Gaunt had been active in the area. He was extracting iron ore to be processed in new furnaces at Pembrey, had obtained Kilrhedyn colliery, and had constructed a harbour on the sands at Pembrey. Rennie and Bankes had dismissed the idea of a connection to Gaunt's harbour, as it was not felt to be adequate for the likely volumes of coal traffic, but Gaunt was keen for a canal link. Between late 1823 and April 1824 he built two miles (3.2 km) of canal, including a lock at Cross Lane cottage. At its northern end it joined the Kidwelly and Llanelly canal at Ty Gwyn, just to the north of the disused Ashburnham Canal, and at its southern end, a short tramway linked its terminus to Gaunt's harbour. The Cambrian newspaper carried reports of a ceremonial opening on 30 April 1824, and a formal opening on 26 May. By 1843, the canal had become disused, with traffic going to the new harbour at Pembrey instead. =Pembrey New Harbour= An Act of Parliament dated 10 June 1825 created the New Harbour Company, with powers to build the harbour at Tywyn Bach, on the sands near Pembrey. The Act included powers to build a short section of canal to link with the line of the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal. The new harbour was completed in 1832. The community of Burry Port did not exist in 1825, and it was not until 1835 that the name of the company was changed to the Burry Port Company by another Act of Parliament. =James Green's extensions= The bridge which carried Stanley's Tramway over the canal near Pembrey old harbour Once the construction of a new harbour had begun, the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company constructed a tramway from Llanelli to Pwll colliery. Another tramway was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a branch to Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course, so that there would be a tramway link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837. In 1832, the canal company asked the engineer James Green to advise on further extensions to the system. His first report was critical of much of the work completed by Pinkerton, and recommended completing the link from the Ashburnham Canal to the new Pembrey harbour. This would require a lock at Ty Mawr, with water supplied by the Dyvatty brook and a new reservoir to be constructed at Cwm Capel in the Dyvatty valley. A second report, supplied three months later, recommended an extension along the Gwendraeth valley, and the construction of three inclined planes to reach a terminus just above Cwmmawr. Water supply for the upper sections would be from a new reservoir to be built above Cwm y Glo. The idea of using inclined planes was an innovation that Green had pioneered elsewhere. He had been the engineer for the Bude Canal, which included six planes, five powered by water wheels and one by a descending bucket mechanism. He was at the time the engineer for the Grand Western Canal, which included seven vertical boat lifts and an inclined plane at Wellisford, again to be powered by a descending bucket mechanism. The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was , and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much less water than the alternative of 20 or more locks. The wooden Pontnewydd aqueduct, which was prone to the river flowing over its top, was replaced by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room for the river to flow under it. Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and the banks of the Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level to be raised. This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised. At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835. Above Pontyates, two more locks were built, followed by an inclined plane with a rise of at Capel Ifan, one with a rise of at Pont Henry, and a third with a rise of at Hirwaunissa, with level sections of canal in between. The upper terminus consisted of a walled basin, , reached by another aqueduct over the Gwendraeth Fawr. In October 1835 Green announced that he was unable to complete the inclined planes because of cost overruns. The company raised more capital to finish the work by calling on shareholders, and on 30 January 1836 dismissed Green as engineer. The Grand Western Canal Company had taken a similar action three days earlier, when the Wellisford inclined plane had failed to work because of a design fault in the sizing of the descending bucket. All construction was completed by 1837. =Inclines= Details of the inclined planes have been the subject of some speculation, largely because contemporary documents from the time of their construction are unknown. A local writer called Ap Huw stated that \\"the inclined planes were manipulated by hydraulic pumps which were considered to be great discoveries\\". He also noted that only two of the inclines were used, but whether this was because Hirwaunissa was unfinished or because there was no traffic on the upper section is not clear. The railway engineer W. Robinson described \\"balance caissons with hydraulic brakes apparatus to check the barges in their descent and to arrange that the full ones coming down pull the empty ones up\\".W Robinson, letter in Carmarthen Journal, 25 June 1868, quoted in The Colliery Guardian carried an eye-witness report of their operation, in which they were described as self-acting inclines, and it is stated that all three were in operation at the time.Colliery Guardian, 4 October 1867, quoted in The other main sources of information are maps, particularly those published at the time the canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal. Subsequent development No further changes were made to the canal after the extensions were completed, and satisfactory levels of traffic were carried. Fifty-two barges were operational in 1835, although their size is unknown. The canal was dredged in 1858, and shareholders began to receive dividends on their investments that same year. Most of the traffic was anthracite coal, which was shipped through Burry Port. Some culm was still shipped through Kidwelly. Major users in 1863 consisted of two collieries at Pwll y Llygod and one at Pontyberem. Success was short-lived, however, as railways started to appear in the region. Faced with the threat of the Carmarthenshire Railway building a branch to Pontyberem, the Canal Company obtained a new Act of Parliament, and became the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway Company in 1865. The following year, the Burry Port and Gwendreath Valley Railway company was formed, by amalgamating with the Burry Port Harbour Company. (The spelling of Gwendraeth was wrong in the Act of Parliament.) The new company built a railway from Burry Port to Pontyberem, along the towpath over Pinged marsh, and on the bed of the canal elsewhere. This opened in July 1869. An extension to Kidwelly harbour followed in June 1873, and one to Cwmmawr in June 1886. Although the main canal was replaced by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan. The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease on the dock in 1872, and the railway built a branch to it in 1873, which ran alongside the old canal. Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan. Legacy Kymer's dock was used as a refuse tip in the 1950s. In 1988, a two-year scheme funded by the Manpower Services Commission excavated and restored both the dock and of the canal, from the dock to the point where its course is cut by the South Wales Railway. The Gwendraeth Fawr aqueduct is still in situ, as are parts of the Hirwaunissa inclined plane and the final aqueduct below Cwmmawr.

Healthy, Ohio, in the Cincinnati area. She also worked in decorative painting and sculpture. Described by her contemporaries as \\"the first woman painter of America\\" and \\"the dean of American woman painters in France and one of the most eminent contemporary artists of her sex,\\" Nourse was the first American woman to be voted into the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. She also had the honor of having one of her paintings purchased by the French government and included in the Luxembourg Museum's permanent collection. Nourse's style was described by Los Angeles critic Henry J. Seldis as a \\"forerunner of social realist painting.\\" Some of Nourse's works are displayed at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Biography =Early life= A portrait by Nourse of Benn Pitman, under whom she studied woodcarving and decorative crafts in Cincinnati. He also married Nourse's sister. Born to the Catholic household of Caleb Elijah Nourse and Elizabeth LeBreton Rogers Nourse on October 26, 1859, Elizabeth and her twin sister, Adelaide, were the youngest of ten children. She attended the McMicken School of Design in Cincinnati (now the Art Academy of Cincinnati) at age fifteen, and was one of the first women admitted to the women's life class offered there taught by Thomas Satterwhite Noble. She also studied watercolor painting while there. She studied at the school for seven years and was even offered a teaching position, which she declined in order to focus on her painting. In 1882, both of her parents died, and with the assistance of an art patron, she went to New York City to continue her studies, briefly in the Art Students League. Here, she met William Merritt Chase and visited him in his studio. In 1883, she had returned to Cincinnati and made her living decorating home interiors and painting portraits. From 1884 ‚Äì 1886, she spent most of her summers in Tennessee in the Appalachian Mountains doing watercolor landscapes. =Paris= In 1887, she moved to Paris, France along with her older sister, Louise, who was to be her lifelong companion, business manager, housekeeper and hostess. In Paris, she attended Acad√©mie Julian, studying under Gustave Boulanger and Jules Lefebvre. While studying in Paris Nourse became acquainted with fellow painter Caroline Augusta Lord. Already having advanced skill when she arrived and having developed her style while in Cincinnati, she quickly finished with her studies and opened her own studio. In 1888, her work was featured in her first major exhibition at the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais. Her subjects were often women, mostly peasants, and depictions of France's rural countryside. Though continuing to live and work mainly in Paris, Nourse travelled extensively around Europe, Russia, and North Africa painting the people she met. =New Woman= She was one of the \\"New Women\\" of the 19th century successful, highly trained women artists who never married, like Ellen Day Hale, Mary Cassatt, Elizabeth Coffin and Cecilia Beaux.Holly Pyne Connor; Newark Museum; Frick Art & Historical Center. Off the Pedestal: New Women in the Art of Homer, Chase, and Sargent. Rutgers University Press; 2006. . p. 25. Hale, Nourse, and Coffin \\"created compelling self-portraits in which they fearlessly presented themselves as individuals willing to flout social codes and challenge accepted ideas regarding women's place in society. Indeed, the New Women portraits of the 1880s and 1890s are unforgettable interpretations of energetic, self-confident and accomplished women.\\"Holly Pyne Connor; Newark Museum; Frick Art & Historical Center. Off the Pedestal: New Women in the Art of Homer, Chase, and Sargent. Rutgers University Press; 2006. . p. 27, 39. Later life and World War I activism During the first world war, Nourse defied the tendency of most American emigres to return home and remained in Paris, where she worked to assist the war's refugees and solicited donations from her friends in the United States and Canada for the benefit of people whose lives were disrupted by the war. In 1921, she was awarded the Laetare Medal for \\"distinguished service to humanity\\" by a Catholic layperson, an annual award from Notre Dame University in Indiana. Nourse retired and when her sister died in 1927, she became ill and depressed. In 1920, she was operated on for breast cancer, and, in 1937, the cancer returned. She died on October 8, 1938.

The shows on October 16, October 23, and October 30 1976 were live from NBC's studio complex in Brooklyn, NY. NBC News used Studio 8-H for Presidential election coverage. This season was the last to feature The Muppets in The Land of Gorch, who had appeared in segments that were unpopular with fans and the SNL writers. Jim Henson was reportedly displeased with the amount of creative control he had over the scripts. Jerry Juhl called Henson \\"very frustrated\\" with his input into the scripts, and said the SNL writers \\"didn't have any real handle\\" on Henson's concept. \\"Jim would come in with ideas, and sit with them, and give them wonderful ideas, and they wouldn't know how to fly with them,\\" Juhl recalled. In a 1977 interview with Playboy, head writer/performer Michael O'Donoghue referred to the Muppets as \\"fucking Muppets... little hairy facecloths\\" made from the refuse after they cleaned up after Woodstock. He also refused to write for them, saying \\"I don't write for felt\\". O'Donoghue also had a lynched Big Bird hanging in the writer's office.

They were previously known as the Manchester Phoenix ENL (2007-2009), and the Trafford Metros (2009-2013). History =The Beginning= When the construction of the Altrincham Ice Dome was first announced, a small, but vocal number of fans expressed a desire to see the Altrincham Aces team be restarted at the rink. Manchester Phoenix were initially unable (or unwilling) to do so, as they wished to focus their energies on starting the senior EIHL side, and the hastily announced juniors. They did, however express the idea that if a third party wished to come forward and run an English National Ice Hockey League (ENL) side from the rink, then they would be only too happy to assist in any way they could (citation to follow). Rumours of an ENL team increased upon the conclusion of the 2006/2007 season when the English Ice Hockey Association made moves to the junior age boundaries at the top level from under 19 to under 18; leaving a number of promising players without a team to play for. The dream became reality in the summer of 2007 when it was announced by the Phoenix that they had formed an ENL affiliate to begin play in time for the 2007/2008 season under the name \\"Manchester Phoenix ENL\\". The creation of the ENL team was seen as being the final step for an integrated development system, taking players from under 10 level right through the junior system, onwards to the ENL and finally to the professional side.http://www.manchesterphoenix.co.uk/news/829/eiha-approve-phoenix-enihl- application =2007-2008= Manchester Phoenix ENL began their first season of play in the ENL North in September 2007. Several members on the roster had signed from nearby Flintshire Freeze, with the squad consisting of many former Altrincham Aces players who could now resume playing for a team more local to the Manchester area. The season concluded with the team going 6-15-1, claiming 9th place in the 12 team league. =2008-2009= Due to several new teams being formed, the league was split into 2 divisions for the beginning of the 2008/09 season. With Phoenix ENL failing to finish their inaugural season in the top half of the table, they joined the likes of Grimsby, Telford & Bradford in the newly formed ENL North Division 2. The team had great success in their second season of existence under head coach Mark Hobson, finishing the season with a 20-4-0 record, missing out on the league title by just three points. However, after finishing the regular season in 2nd place, success was to come in the post-season with victory in the promotion playoffs, granting the team promotion to the ENL's top tier for the 2009/10 season. =Return of the Metros= On 12 August 2009, the team was renamed the Trafford Metros, to help differentiate between the EPL Phoenix, and their ENL affiliate.http://www.manchesterphoenix.co.uk/news/s/1547_the_metros_are_back This has meant that the club now have their own jerseys, as opposed to sharing a design with the parent team which has been the case since their conception. =Re-Branded again= In August 2013, it was revealed that the team name would be changing once more, this time to the 'Manchester Minotaurs'. http://www.manchesterphoenix.co.uk/nihl/2332/new-name-trafford-metros Head Coach * Paul 'Nipper' Bayliss References Sport in Trafford Ice hockey teams in England Altrincham ","title":"Manchester Minotaurs"},{"id":"12801878","text":"Mikl√≥s Fodor (September 3, 1908 - April 30, 1997) was a Hungarian field handball player who competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics.

It was produced under the auspices of the DEFA film studio in East Germany. It began filming on 29 September 1948 and premiered in theaters on 16 September 1949.Baumert, Heinz. Grundfragen der Filmdramaturgie. Herausgeber: GDR Ministerium fuer Kultur (1956), p. 59. The film was partly shot at the Althoff Studios in Potsdam. The art directors Willy Schiller and Arthur Schwarz worked on the film's sets. Plot The film opens to scenes of Berlin during World War II, with the ongoing war depicted by bombs and explosions, both onscreen and in the background soundtrack. The film then jumps back twenty years in time, and, through a series of vignettes about worker Hans Behnke, traces the way in which a typical worker who opposes Nazi party ideology could be drawn into complying and cooperating with the Nazi regime. Significant vignettes include depictions of the high unemployment in 1920s Germany and later, the threat to Hans's job due to his failure to belong to the Nazi party. It is implied that Hans's complicity with the Nazi regime rises out of a desire to be able to provide for his family and not return to the ranks of the Arbeitslos (unemployed). Hans ultimately does join the Nazi party, but still shows signs of disagreement with their ideology. He eventually aids a resistance group in printing anti-war propaganda, and is finally turned into the authorities by his son Helmut. Hans is then put in jail, and the timeline returns to that given at the very beginning of the film. Hans is eventually freed from jail, but his wife, Charlotte, has been killed in the war. The end of the film depicts Hans's reconciliation with his son Helmut, and Helmut's beginning of a new life with his girlfriend. The ending scenes of the film echo those of the beginning in which Hans and Charlotte start their life, but with dialog and visual symbolism suggesting that Helmut will not repeat his father's mistakes and his father's complicity. Critical reception Critics noted that Hans Behnke's character represented the typical German worker, and that his reasons for cooperating with the Nazi regime resonated with viewers who had lived through the war. Viewers in 1949 saw themselves in Behnke. As one critic wrote, \\"dieser Film zeigt, wie es wirklich war\\" (this film shows how it really was).quoted in Zur Geschichte des DEFA-Spielfilms, 1946‚Äì1949. Herausgeber: Hochschule fuer Film und Fernsehen der DDR. Redaktion: Margarete Schmidt. 1976. Staudte explicitly stated that the intended message of the film was against war: in his words, his goal was to \\"show how it could come to such an unimaginable catastrophe, in order to help ensure that it will not come to a greater catastrophe in the future.\\"quoted in Baumer Heinz, and Hermann Herlinghaus. 20 Jahre DEFA-Spielfilm.

The Vladimir Highway (Russian: –í–ª–∞–¥–∏ÃÅ–º–∏—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç), familiarly known as the Vladimirka (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏ÃÅ–º–∏—Ä–∫–∞), was a road leading east from Moscow to Vladimir and Nizhny Novgorod. Its length was about 190 kilometers. The road has been mentioned in documents since the Middle Ages, when it connected the political capital of Muscovy with the ancestral seat of the Grand Dukes of Vladimir-Suzdal. It was by this road that the Muscovite merchants travelled to the Makariev Fair. In connection with the ceremonial transfer of the Theotokos of Vladimir from Vladimir to Moscow in 1395, one Russian chronicler referred to the route as \\"the greatest of roads\\". The Vladimir Highway was renovated in the mid-18th century when it became the westernmost section of the Great Siberian Road linking Siberia to Europe. There were a number of post stations with a ready supply of fresh horses. If one travelled post, it was possible to get from Moscow to Vladimir in less than 24 hours. Since Siberia was a traditional place of exile, the Vladimirka witnessed crowds of prisoners in shackles marching from Moscow to the katorga. It is in connection with the penal function that the road figures in the works of Alexander Herzen, Nikolay Nekrasov, and Fyodor Dostoevsky (e.g., Crime and Punishment). As a result, a wealth of bitter associations accrued to it over the course of the 19th century; they are embodied in Isaak Levitan's eponymous painting (1892), representing the Vladimirka as a \\"lonely track going on into the empty distance enlivened only by a church and the vast lowering sky\\".Quoted from: Murrell, Kathleen Berton. Discovering the Moscow Countryside. I.B. Tauris, 2001. . Page 172. After the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks were keen to get rid of the notorious name, rebranding the Moscow section of the road as Shosse Entuziastov (\\"Enthusiasts' Highway\\"). The modernized Soviet highway became known as the Volga Motorway.

It also covers Virginia and South Carolina. History The station began as WITN-FM, and by the late 1970s was a Top 40 station known as Rock 93, airing TM's automated \\"Stereo Rock\\" format. The station was owned by William Riley \\"Bill\\" Roberson Jr. and operated along with sister station WITN-AM as the Tar Heel Broadcasting System. Roberson also owned the local TV station, WITN- TV 7 and numerous other local properties such as the Dr. Pepper bottling plant, and Washington Square Mall. Around 1984, Roberson retired and began divesting these properties, selling some but leaving his son in law, Charles Zoph Potts and William Riley Roberson III in charge of WITN-AM and FM. Potts and Roberson took the FM station to a live format in 1985, and changed to the 93DLX moniker, also known as the Hot FM. In 1991 the station went to a soft AC format. On 2/19/96 the calls became WERO. and went to Classic Hits format as Arrow 93.3. Also in 1996, major changes took place as Potts and Roberson sold their interest in the station to Pinnacle Broadcasting, which in 1999 became NextMedia Group. In 1998 it dropped the Arrow and became known as WERO a 50-50 mix of the 80s and 90s, mixing in more of an AAA format, all during this time it had some association with WITN-TV. In 1999 it switched to Bob 93.3 and plays Top 40 music. In 2004, NextMedia consolidated its radio operations to one central location in New Bern, North Carolina, as this station left behind the building just south of Washington where it had broadcast from since the 1950s. In 2010, WERO operated on reduced power for a while as the station replaced an antenna that was 30 years old, an action which will increase the station's signal range.

Hillsboro had four Little League teams when Rutschman began coaching at Hillsboro, but by the time he left, there were 41 teams. After 13 years at Hillsboro High school, Rutschman was approached about taking over the head football coach position at Linfield College. Linfield College Rutschman was hired as the head football coach at Linfield College in 1968. During his 24 seasons as Linfield head football coach, his teams won three NAIA national championship (1982, 1984, 1986) and 15 Northwest Conference championships. One of his most memorable coached games was the 1984 national championship. Linfield trailed defending NAIA-II champion Northwestern 22-0 with just over three minutes left in the third quarter, but would come back to win 33-22. His Wildcats played in a total of 20 post-season games in 12 different seasons. He led the team to a winning season in all 24 seasons as coach, part of Linfield's current all-divisions national record streak of 62 consecutive winning seasons (as of the end of the 2017 season). After the 1991 season, Rutschman retired from coaching with a career record of 183-48-3 (.788). Rutschman also served as the head coach of the baseball program from 1971 to 1983. In his first season as the head baseball coach, he guided Linfield to the NAIA national championship. Before stepping down as head coach in 1983, he led the Wildcats to six conference championships and seven NAIA District 2 titles. Rutschman is the only college coach at any level to have won national titles in both football and baseball. He was named Division II football coach of the year three times and was honored as the state of Oregon's Slats Gill man of the year five times, more than any other individual. Rutschman was named to the NAIA Hall of Fame in 1988, the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1993 and was enshrined into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1998. During his 25-year tenure as athletic director, the college's sports facilities took major leaps forward. The spacious and modern athletic complex, including two new gymnasiums, a swimming pool and multi-purpose field house, was constructed, a new baseball stadium was erected and the tennis courts were relocated and expanded. Locker rooms were renovated and a concession stand and ticket booth was built. The field house, a multi-purpose facility completed in 1995, was named in honor of Rutschman and his wife, Joan, for their 27 years of service to the college. Rutschman retired as head coach of the football team in 1991, but returned in 2001 as kickoff return coach under head coach Jay Locey. Legacy Rutschman's grandson, Adley Rutschman, was a catcher for the Oregon State Beavers baseball team. Adley was the College World Series Most Outstanding Player on Oregon State's 2018 College World Series championship team and was selected by the Baltimore Orioles with the first overall pick in the 2019 Major League Baseball Draft.

Early life Balcaskie, Fife Anstruther was baptized on 24 September 1658, the third son of Sir Philip Anstruther of Anstruther, Fife, a member of the Scottish Parliament, and his wife Christian Lumsden, daughter of Sir James Lumsden of Innergellie, Fife. Career Anstruther had an early spell in the Parliament of Scotland as a Burgh Commissioner for Anstruther Easter from 1681 to 1682. He married Sophia Kinnear, the daughter and coheiress of David Kinnear, and adopted the additional name of Kinnear on the death of his father-in law in 1684. Sophia died in 1686 and he married as his second wife Jean Monteith, the daughter and heiress of William Monteith of Wrae, on 12 March 1687. From 1689 to 1690, unlike his brother, he served the regime of King William on various local commissions. He was caught up in a double returned for Anstruther Easter, and the result was decided against him. He was given a place as one of the general receivers of supply in 1691. He was created a baronet of Wrae, Linlithgowshire and Balcaskie, Fife and Braemore, Caithness on 28 November 1694. In 1696 he was appointed joint farmer of excise, and in 1697 was appointed clerk and keeper of cocquet seal, Firth of Forth west of Queensferry. He lost at least ¬£500 in the Darien scheme and lost money in the farm of the Scottish excise, but had married two heiresses. He was able to purchase in 1698 an estate at Balcaskie, on the Fife coast where he went on to build a house. He also served as a commissioner to the convention of royal burghs for the neighbouring burgh of Anstruther Easter. He married as his third wife, his cousin Marian Preston, the daughter of Sir William Preston, 2nd Baronet of Valleyfield, Fife. In 1702 Anstruther became Burgh Commissioner for Anstruther Wester. He opposed the Union and took part in the protests in 1705 against the treaty act. In Parliament he was frequently absent in the divisions on the Union and five of his only six votes were on the opposition side. He probably acted according to the influence of the Court Tory Lord Leven. He lost his seat and his government posts in 1707. After the union of Scotland with England, Anstruther was returned to the new Parliament of Great Britain as Member of Parliament for Fife at a by-election on 24 March 1709. There was little time for him to make any impression and he did not stand at the 1710 British general election. Death and legacy Anstruther died in March 1737. He had had five sons and two daughters by his second wife and one son and two daughters by his third wife. One of his sons was killed at the Battle of Preston in 1715 and another rose to the rank of general in the service of the Hanoverians. He was succeeded by his eldest son Philip Anstruther.

Storylines =1993‚Äì95= Stone and his sister Gina Williams were raised by their older brother Jagger Cates after their parents abandoned them. Jagger wasn't able to take care of them and they became separated and entered the foster parent rut. Stone met Karen Wexler at a party. Someone slipped something into her drink and Stone helped her. Stone did not know that she was dating his older brother Jagger. Karen felt she wasn't good enough for Jagger so she ended their relationship. Stone was living with Sonny Corinthos. Sonny was seeing Karen and got her hooked on drugs. Jagger found his little brother at his girlfriend Krystal's grave site and they began to build a relationship. Jagger became a cop and became engaged to Karen. Jagger saved his brother when he was supposed to drive the get away car to break Frank Smith out of prison. Jagger had a motorcycle accident but recovered and married Karen. Stone started to date Robin Scorpio. The pair fell deeply in love. Mac Scorpio, Robin's uncle, proved to be a big obstacle in their relationship as he did not approve of his niece dating a street kid. He came down with the flu and Robin took care of him. He told her that he had been tested for HIV and they had sex for the first time. They used protection at first, but eventually they stopped; this was a decision that would change Robin's life forever. Stone had the flu for a while and decided to get tested for HIV again. The test came back positive. He did not know how to tell Robin. Stone was shot and his blood got on Robin. He ran away from her. She found him in the same motel where they previously had sex. Stone told Robin that he was HIV positive. Dr. Alan Quartermaine ordered that they both be tested. Stone's test revealed that he now had AIDS. Robin's test came back negative. Alan started Stone on drug therapy. Mac Scorpio, Robin's uncle was furious when he found out, but he cared for Stone and even saved his life during a seizure, and later bonded with the kid. Robin later tested positive for HIV. Towards the end of his life, Stone was cared for by Robin and Sonny Corinthos at Sonny's penthouse. Stone's eyesight started to fail due to CMV retinitis worsened by his illness. Right before he died he was able to focus on Robin and see her for one last time. His last word were, \\"I see you...Oh, Robin, I see you.\\" Stone was like a brother to Sonny and Sonny took his death very hard. Brenda Barrett took his death hard as well, and the two comforted each other. Sonny, Brenda, and Robin had Stone cremated and threw his ashes over a bridge where he had gone bungee jumping to fulfill one of the wishes on his \\"wish list\\", which he made once he knew he would not live many more months. =Afterlife and legacy= In May 1996, Sonny lost his pregnant wife, Lily. He donated her inheritance to General Hospital to open the Stone Cates Memorial AIDS Wing. Sonny later named his son Morgan Stone Corinthos, after Jason Morgan and Stone. Stone's name comes up regularly on the show, unlike most soap opera characters who are quickly forgotten after being killed off. The annual Nurses Ball, ceased in 2001 for some unexplained reason, was always dedicated to Stone and featured his NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, a robin on a bridge (to commemorate not only his life, but the love he shared with Robin Scorpio) created by Mac Scorpio, at the entrance. Robin tells many characters how she contracted HIV from Stone, and even did this when she discovered her mother Anna Devane was alive on All My Children in 2001. Sometimes, Stone, or a great coincidence, messes with the lights after blackouts whenever Stone's name is mentioned, leaving Sonny and Robin to often wonder if Stone's spirit checks in on them from time to time. In 2008, Jagger returns to Port Charles in General Hospital: Night Shift. He visits Robin and later introduces her to his son, Stone, who later is determined to be autistic. Stone returns as a ghost to his former girlfriend Robin Scorpio on September 28, 2010, when Robin, kidnapped and held captive by Dr. Lisa Niles in an underground hole and urges her to have a positive attitude that she'll be rescued. Stone returns, once again, as a ghost to his former friend Sonny Corinthos on August 1, 2017, when Sonny is attacked by the sick Sam Morgan and left to die in a warehouse.

He studied the smallpipes with Old William Lamshaw, of Morpeth, and later with Joseph Turnbull, of Alnwick. His playing was highly regarded in his lifetime: Thomas Bewick, the engraver, who also lived and worked in Newcastle, wrote Some time before the American War broke out, there had been a lack of musical performers upon our streets, and in this interval, I used to engage John Peacock, our inimitable performer, to play on the Northumberland or Small-pipes; and with his old tunes, his lilts, his pauses, and his variations, I was always excessively pleased. William Green, piper to the Duke of Northumberland from 1806, considered him the best small pipes player he ever heard in his life. He is also closely associated with the first printed collection of music for smallpipes, A Favorite Collection of Tunes with Variations Adapted for the Northumberland Small Pipes, Violin, or Flute, published by William Wright, of Newcastle, probably in 1801. The book had an engraved title page in the style of Thomas Bewick, and probably from his workshop, and the 1801 date is suggested by entries in the account books of Bewick for work done for Wright, between February and June 1801;Essay by Iain Bain in Bewick's Pipe Tunes, pp. 67-76, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2010, in any case, Wright gave the address of his shop as High Bridge, so the date of publication definitely preceded the move of the business from High Bridge to Pilgrim Street, which he announced in April and May 1803.Advertisement, Newcastle Courant, 30 April 1803. As well as containing 50 tunes for smallpipes, the book also contains an engraving, also thought to have been done in Bewick's workshop, showing 2 chanters and their fingering charts; one is a simple keyless chanter with an octave range from G to g, the other is J. Peacock's New Invented Pipe Chanter with the addition of Four Keys, these keys were for the notes low D, E, F sharp, and high a. Peacock's keyed chanter Peacock was thus probably the first player of the instrument to play an extended keyed chanter. Such chanters continued to be developed in the first decades of the 19th century, by John Dunn, in association with Peacock, and slightly later by Robert Reid, and subsequently by others, including Reid's son James. Thomas Bewick encouraged Peacock to teach pupils to become masters of this kind of music; one of these pupils was Bewick's own son, Robert Eliot Bewick.  Peacock's Tunes  This, the first published book of music for Northumbrian smallpipes, contains much of the most characteristic music of the instrument, variation sets with a single-octave range. It is the main source for this body of music. Some of these tunes may be compared with earlier versions from the William Dixon manuscript, from more than 60 years earlier. Some of these are very similar - Cut and Dry Dolly is an elaboration on Dixon's Cut and Dry Dolly the new way, while I saw my Love come passing by me is also very like its precursor in Dixon. A pair which can be compared closely are Peacock's Wylam Away, and Dixon's Gingling Geordie; apart from inessential differences in key and note length, most strains in the one have close parallels with some strain in the other. However the strains occur in a different order, and melodic figures may be swapped in order between the two versions of a given strain. Evidently these versions were current over the intervening 60‚Äì70 years. Other Peacock variation sets are less closely related to the Dixon versions; in particular My Hinny sits ower late up is much shorter than, and rather different from, Dixon's Adam a Bell. Some of the Peacock variation sets such as Cuckold come out of the Amrey, based on the Scottish tune Struan Robertson's Rant, are not known from any earlier source. The collection also contains adaptations of other music, particularly some Scottish fiddle music, to smallpipes. Some of these pieces, like My Ain Kind Dearie, need the keyed chanter with its extended range; this tune in particular is notable for the detailed notation of the variation and the ornaments. This may give some idea what Bewick meant by 'his lilts, his pauses and his variations'. Some tunes in the collection, such as The Black and the Grey, are adaptations to a single-octave chanter of Border Pipe tunes with a nine note range; necessarily something of the original was lost, and this adaptation in particular is less successful, however some others, such as Over the Border, work very well in Peacock's version. The whole collection, with some notes on the tunes, may be viewed online on the FARNE archive, or at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/musicfiles/manuscripts/peacock.pdf. The music was republishedPeacock's Tunes, 2nd ed., Northumbrian Pipers' Society (1999), by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society in 1999. The manuscript tunebooks of Peacock's pupil, Robert Bewick,Bewick's Pipe Tunes, ed. Matt Seattle, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2010, contain some twenty single octave variation sets not found in the Peacock collection; it is possible that they too formed part of Peacock's repertoire, or were developed from versions of Peacock's, being stylistically very similar to those in 'A Favorite Collection'.  Peacock's pipes  A set of pipes John Peacock's Pipes, Anne Moore, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, vol. 26, 2005. with a single- octave chanter was presented by John Dunn (bagpipe maker) to John Peacock in 1797; this set now lacks the original chanter, but still carries the original engraved ferrule on the drone-stock reading: 'The Gift of John Dunn to John Peacock Newcastle 1797'. The engraved drone-ferrule on Peacock's pipes. The engraved inscription is generally thought to have been done in the workshop of Thomas Bewick. The set was acquired by the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne in 2004, and is now in the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum. An article published in 1894 The Shields Daily Gazette and Shipping Telegraph, 25 May 1894, http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000287/18940525/026/0004 states that these pipes were in the possession of John Stokoe, and had at this time a seven-keyed chanter. As the earliest keyed chanters had four keys, as shown in Peacock's tunebook, the chanter Stokoe saw, which he believed to be by Robert Reid, was not the original either.

Ski Cape Smokey offers 16 alpine runs, 2 lifts, hill grooming and snow making. Facilities include a lodge at the base and top of the mountain. The base lodge feature a restaurant, bar, ski school and hill offices. Ski Cape Smokey is known for being Nova Scotia's highest elevation ski mountain at over a 320 m, 305 m of it skiable, and for its ocean views. The mountain receives an average of 381 cm of snowfall annually. However weather is often unpredictable and above freezing. Since 2002 the ski resort has had continuing financial problems. This issue continues and affects the operation of the area. It suffers from a low population base in the local area and remoteness from major population areas. Sydney is 90 minutes away and Halifax 4.5 hours away. In 2006, the ski hill closed. Many years following that, volunteers from the Ski Cape Smokey Society, a non-profit care taker group, attempted to re- open the resort. After many unsuccessful attempts, Ski Cape Smokey was finally opened February 2011, with very limited parts of the mountain for local skiers using the lower mountain poma lift. Without snow making it cannot operate in the profitable Christmas/New Year holiday period. Facilities at the hill area are in need of much repair and deteriorating very quickly. The quad chair which has not been run or inspected in many years may require substantial repair at a high cost. The same is true in the neglect of the snow making system which may not be functional and have to be replaced. Many prospective buyers have done due diligence and inspected the hill, but none are willing to make a commitment to long term operation of the ski center. A search for a permanent solution continues. Permanent closure of the ski hill and sales of the assets is a possibility in the future.

He played football for the University of Michigan from 1915 to 1917 and 1920 under head coach Fielding H. Yost. He was a coach and administrator at Michigan from 1921 to 1929, including two years as the school's head football coach. He later served as a football coach at the University of Minnesota (1930‚Äì1931), Princeton University (1932‚Äì1942), and Columbia University (1944‚Äì1945), and as an athletic director at the University of Maine (1946‚Äì1951) and University of Denver (1951‚Äì1962). He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1956. Youth in California Wieman was born in Tulare County, California, and raised in Los Angeles. His father, William H. Wieman, was a native of Missouri and a Presbyterian minister.Census entry for William H. Wieman and family. Ancestry.com. 1910 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

Wieman was the seventh of eight children born to William and his wife Alma. At the time of the 1900 United States Census, the family lived in Orosi, California.Census entry for William H. Wieman and family. Ancestry.com. 1900 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Orosi, Tulare, California; Roll: T623_115; Page: 2B; Enumeration District: 62. By 1910, the family had moved to Los Angeles. At Los Angeles High School, Wieman followed in the footsteps of four older brothers, Henry, \\"Ink,\\" Drury and \\"Tabby\\" Wieman. All had been excellent athletes in football, track, baseball and basketball. \\"Tad\\" played at \\"breakaway\\" in rugby football for Los Angeles High and was heralded as the best athlete in a family regarded as \\"the greatest athletic one in the history of Southern California athletics.\\" Wieman had been expected to follow his older brothers who had all enrolled at Occidental College, but he broke the family tradition when he decided to attend the University of Michigan. When Wieman announced his decision to attend Michigan, the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a calamity of almost national importance.\\" The Times reported at length on Wieman's decision, noting: > \\"The fifth of the Wieman tribe has upset the most ancient tradition of > Occidental College. The mighty Tad, terror of all Rugbyites last year, while > playing for Los Angeles High, last Sunday quietly folded his tent like the > Arab and stole away. ... Tad promised to be the greatest of them all. ... > What Occidental will do without the great Tad nobody knows.\\" The expectations for Wieman were so high that Coach Featherstone of Los Angeles High, who reportedly urged Wieman to go to Michigan, said, \\"Tad Wieman will be one of the greatest athletes this country has ever seen before his college course is over.\\" University of Michigan athlete and service in World War I =Freshman season= In 1915, Wieman enrolled at Michigan. Wieman worked nights to pay for his expenses and studied into the morning to keep up with his classes. Though he had only played rugby football before coming to Michigan, Wieman played on Michigan's freshman football team. Wieman's hometown newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, followed his progress, reporting in October 1915 that he was \\"making quite a reputation for himself as tackle on the freshman eleven\\" and noting that \\"Coach Yost seems to be quite pleased with his work.\\" As Wieman progressed, the Times ran a feature story reporting that \\"the big, raw-boned freshman from Southern California\\" was stopping Michigan's top varsity players, including All-American John Maulbetsch, and leaving them piled up \\"in a squirming heap.\\" Coach Yost was reported to have bawled many varsity players for their inability to get past Wieman, with Maulbetsch complaining, \\"It can't be done, coach.\\" Each night, the varsity players reportedly swore to get Wieman, but never did. Wieman reportedly took the punishment and came up from under the pile each time smiling. Wieman also demonstrated his talent on offense: > \\"He is used by the freshmen on end-around plays. He has a peculiar way of > running with a loose hitch in his hips that shakes off tacklers. He also > handles the ball well and is the best man at catching forward passes among > the freshmen. Wieman gives Rugby (the English game he played in California) > and basketball the credit for his ability to catch the ball. On punts he is > generally waiting for his man to catch the ball.\\" If it were not for the ban on freshmen play, the Times concluded there was no doubt that he would be playing on the varsity team. =Sophomore season= As a 183-pound sophomore in 1916, Wieman played for the varsity football team and was moved from end to the line, playing seven games at left tackle. Wieman has been called \\"one of the greatest linemen ever developed\\" by Yost. =Junior season= Photograph of Wieman from the 1917 team photograph In 1917, Michigan was short of backfield talent, and Coach Yost moved Wieman again, this time from tackle to fullback. With his weight increased to 194 pounds, Wieman played eight games at fullback and one at left tackle, and \\"starred in each position.\\" An October 1917 newspaper account described Wieman's value to the team as follows: > \\"Yost's one lucky move seems to hinge on the recent change of 'Tad' Wieman > from tackle to fullback. Wieman is a giant who musters nearly 200 pounds of > actual muscle. This is only his third year in the university, but he already > was talked of a sure all-American tackle. Shifting him to fullback may have > ruined his chances of making Camp's all-American this year, but it > undoubtedly will save the Michigan team. The whole Michigan offense will be > built around Wieman. He has developed the plunging habit that results in big > gains every time he tries it in scrimmage. Wieman also is a lad who can use > his head. Nobody knows what Yost would do if Wieman got laid out, but he is > not the type of man that is likely to spend any time flat on his back. As a > kicker, Wieman is beginning to shine too, scoring from drop and place kicks > in scrimmage after only a few days of practice in the toe art.\\" After a close 17-13 win over Kalamazoo's Western State Normal School in early October 1917, the headline read \\"Wieman Saves Day for Wolverines at Close.\\" Wieman kicked a field goal early and scored the winning touchdown late in the fourth quarter. In a late October 1917 game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers, Wieman scored a touchdown, kicked two field goals and two extra points, and scored 14 of Michigan's 20 points. In all, Wieman scored 125 of Michigan's 304 points in 1917, including 76 successful point after touchdown kicks out of 80 attempts. =Service in World War I= After the conclusion of the 1917 season, Wieman was unanimously elected to be captain of the 1918 squad by the team's 18 lettermen. However, in December 1917, Wieman announced his intention of enlisting in the Aviation Corps. Wieman returned to Los Angeles for a time in January 1918, while awaiting his call to service. During Wieman's visit to Los Angeles in 1918, the Los Angeles Times reported that although \\"the strapping celebrity now wears college-cut, tailor-mades instead of whistling corduroy knickerbockers,\\" he was still the same \\"bashful, moon-faced, good- natured Tad.\\" Wieman ultimately became a lieutenant in the air service and played tackle on a championship service team. Though he did not play a single game for the University of Michigan in 1918, the team continued to recognize Wieman as captain of the 1918 team that was undefeated and recognized as a national champion. =Senior season= Elton Wieman, 1917 After completing his military service, Wieman returned to Michigan with one year of eligibility remaining. In 1920, the 24-year-old, 177-pound senior was 17 pounds lighter than he was in his junior year and played five games at right tackle. Wieman was \\"one of the best liked and respected men on the team,\\" and finished his football career playing with a badly injured knee. Wieman was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and won the Western Conference Medal for excellence in scholarship and athletics. Coaching career =Michigan= Wieman was an assistant football coach at Michigan from 1921‚Äì1926 and the head coach from 1927‚Äì1928. Assistant coach As an assistant to Fielding H. Yost, Wieman was responsible for the linemen. Wieman coached several All-American linemen, and the 1924 Michigan yearbook noted that \\"he has consistently produced lines that have ranked with the best in the country.\\" By 1924, Wieman had also been named Michigan's Assistant Athletic Director under Yost. In a show of his confidence in Wieman, Yost reportedly told Wieman in 1925, \\"Tad, you take the line as usual and I won't have to worry about that.\\" Wieman's line stopped Red Grange and the Illinois team in 1925 by a score of 3-0. 1927 season At the end of the 1926 season, Yost retired as Michigan's head coach, and Wieman was appointed as the school's new head coach. In Wieman's first year as head coach, Michigan went 6‚Äì2 with All-American Bennie Oosterbaan leading the effort. In December 1927, Wieman expressed concern about the team's prospects for 1928 without Oosterbaan: \\"We have been riding on the crest of the wave for some time, and perhaps we are due for a poor season, possibly not; who can tell?\\" 1928 season Wieman from 1948 Michiganensian In 1928, the Michigan football team finished with a record of 3‚Äì4‚Äì1. The 1928 season also saw conflict between Wieman and Yost. Before the season began, Yost became restless and announced that he would return to his head coaching responsibilities. After taking control from Wieman, Yost then announced to newspapers the night before the season opener that Wieman was once again the head football coach. Wieman told friends that Yost had failed to notify him in advance, and \\"he was the most surprised man in the country\\" when Yost made the announcement. In October 1928, newspapers across the country reported that there had been a break between Yost and Wieman. The Detroit News reported, \\"While no official word of any eruption has been issued, it is well known in inner circles that Wieman is in rebellion and thinking seriously of leaving Ann Arbor.\\" Wieman reportedly contended that he had never really been allowed to take control of the team and felt that he was being used as a scapegoat for the team's poor showing. In late October 1928, the athletic department issued a \\"joint statement\\" from Wieman and Yost denying any estrangement and noting that their relationship was too long and intimate to be jeopardized by \\"any minor misunderstandings.\\" In an apparent compromise over responsibility for the team's poor showing, the statement noted, \\"For the handling of the football team up to October 5, Mr. Yost assumes full responsibility. Since the above date Mr. Wieman has been in charge as head coach.\\" Removal as head coach Despite the public denials, the strained relations between Yost and Wieman continued. In May 1929, an unnamed member of the school's board of athletic control told reporters that Wieman and Yost had reached a parting of the ways and that \\"a reconciliation between the two was impossible.\\" Wieman was again caught by surprise and told reporters, \\"I have not resigned from my position and have no desire or intention of resigning.\\" The next day, Yost again denied any strain in his relationship with Wieman but announced, \\"Mr. Wieman will not be a member of the coaching staff of next fall's football team.\\" Wieman was replaced as head football coach by Harry Kipke and assigned to other duties for the balance of 1929. At the time of the 1930 United States Census, Wieman was living in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with his wife, Margaret, and their two children Robert A. Wieman and Helen E. Wieman. His occupation was listed as a teacher at the university.Census entry for Elton E. Wieman and family. Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Census Place: Ann Arbor, Washtenaw, Michigan; Roll: 1029; Page: 6A; Enumeration District: 15; Image: 512.0. =Minnesota= In February 1930, the University of Minnesota hired Fritz Crisler as its head football coach, and Wieman was hired as Crisler's first assistant and line coach. Crisler and Wieman remained at Minnesota for two years. =Princeton= In 1932, Crisler accepted the position of head football coach at Princeton University, and Wieman went with him as an assistant coach. In February 1938, Crisler resigned as head coach at Princeton to become the head coach at Michigan. Crisler offered Wieman a spot as an assistant coach at Michigan, but Wieman declined and became Princeton's head football coach in 1938. Wieman was the first Princeton coach to lead the Tigers to four consecutive victories over Yale. =U.S. Army and Columbia= During World War II, Wieman was the chief of physical training section of the Army's specialized training program. He was also an assistant football coach at Columbia University with Lou Little in 1944 and 1945. From January to April 1946, Wieman was the athletic adviser to the Eighth Army in occupied Japan. Athletic director career =Maine= In 1946, Wieman was hired by the University of Maine as its dean of men, director of physical education and athletic director. He served in that capacity for five years. =Denver= In August 1951, Wieman became the athletic director at the University of Denver. While at Denver, Wieman was an active participant in the NCAA football rules committee. In 1957, he led the effort to prohibit the practice of grabbing an opposing player's face mask and declaring it a personal foul penalty. Wieman noted at the time: \\"The use of the protective face mask is becoming quite general, and the practice of players grabbing opponents by the masks is also becoming all too common. Such a procedure is not a part of football. It can't be an accident and the feeling of the committee is to cut down on this type of thing before it leads to worse conditions.\\" Wieman retired from his position at the University of Denver in June 1962, after more than 40 years as a college athlete, coach and athletic administrator. Retirement and death During his retirement years, Wieman lived in Portland, Oregon and Lake Arrowhead, California. In 1962, he became the first full-time West Coast director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA), and serving as its president for a time. Wieman established the FCA's west coast headquarters in Portland. Wieman chose Portland rather than his hometown of Los Angeles, saying \\"There are too many people and too much smog down there. In Portland a man can feel good.\\" In a 1963 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Wieman said the FCA sought to \\"harness hero worship\\" and use it for evangelism and conversion to Christianity. Wieman died in December 1971 in Portland at age 75. Honors Wieman was elected as the President of the American Football Coaches Association in 1947. In 1956, he was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame. In 1962, Wieman received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award from the American Football Coaches Association.

By 1870, the one-room schoolhouse, in which a Mrs. Rice taught, had become too small. The people of Dodge Center built a wooden, L-shaped, two-story schoolhouse, costing about $15,000. The first high school commencement exercises were held in 1885.Dodge Center High School Commencement Program, 1984 When that school was also outgrown, a new brick building was built in 1898. The new building, at the corner of 1st Ave NW and 3rd Street NW, was used until 1972. A gymnasium, auditorium and two classrooms were added in 1936, part of President Franklin Roosevelt's WPA program. An addition of a library and home-economics room was added in 1950, and an elementary school building was constructed in 1958. Of the 1890s portion of the building (demolished in 1972), one stairwell and a classroom still exist. The small 1898 portion, 1936, 1950 and 1958 additions remain standing and are now owned by a private entity (as of August 2007). The entire structure is now owned by a private entity and houses apartments with several small businesses. A new high school was erected on the western edge of town in 1972 and is still in use. It is not known when the school chose a nickname or when they started participating in organized athletics. The school colors were maroon and gold until the 1930s or 1940s, when they were changed to green and white. The nickname was Dodgers. The school fight song was \\"D.C. Rouser\\", to the tune of the \\"Minnesota Rouser\\" from the University of Minnesota. In 1952, the Dodge Center football team became one of six Minnesota high school teams to not allow a single point in a season. An official school annual was first published in 1948 and called Dodger Digest. In the early 1950s, the annual was called DO CE HI, then changed to Centerite, which continued publishing each year through 1990, when the last class graduated from Dodge Center High School. Consolidation In 1990, Dodge Center's school district merged with the neighboring towns of West Concord and Claremont to form Triton High School. Triton's mascot is the Cobra and colors are maroon and gray. Dodge Center is now home to Triton Primary, Triton Middle School and Triton Senior High School. The first commencement exercises were held in 1991. The Triton athletic fields are named for former Dodge Center High School football coach, Wally Hitt.

(10 October 1871 ‚Äì 7 March 1949), more widely known as T. Gwynn Jones, was a leading Welsh poet, scholar, literary critic, novelist, translator, and journalist who did important work in Welsh literature, Welsh education, and the study of Welsh folk tales in the first half of the twentieth century. He was also an accomplished translator into Welsh of works from English, German, Greek, and Irish. Personal life Thomas Jones was born at Y Gwyndy Uchaf in Betws-yn-Rhos, Denbighshire, Wales, the eldest son of Isaac Jones and Jane Roberts. He was educated in Denbigh and Abergele. In 1899 he married Margaret Jane Davies, the daughter of Thomas Davies of Denbigh, by whom he had three children. Career In 1890 he was a sub-editor on the Welsh-language newspaper Baner ac Amserau Cymru (Y Faner). He wrote a famous biography of the great Liberal publisher Thomas Gee, whose work influenced Jones throughout his life. After many years as a journalist, Jones worked at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, and later as a lecturer in the Welsh department at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he became a professor in 1919. He won the Chair at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in Bangor in 1902 for his ode, Ymadawiad Arthur. His major work was an edition of the fifteenth-century poet, Tudur Aled. A strong opponent of the First World War, Jones walked out of the Tabernacle Chapel in Aberystwyth when the minister offered a prayer for a British victory in the war. He later wrote \\"If there's anything I understand from the New Testament, it is that Jesus Christ is not a militaristic person. He is the Saviour of the world, he is the Prince of Peace. Therefore those who say they are Christians, followers of Christ must reject war totally.\\" He was awarded CBE in the 1937 Coronation Honours. Influence T. Gwynn Jones's writings had a significant influence on Robert Graves in his mythopoeic study The White Goddess. Graves developed his suggestion of a distinction between the restricted poetry of the official Welsh bards, and the more expansive and fanciful unofficial Welsh writings: \\"The tales and Romances, on the other hand, are full of colour and incident; even characterzation is not absent from them...imagination\\".Quoted in Published works Cover of Ymadawiad Arthur a Chaniadau Eraill, a collection of poems in Welsh by T.

It was one of The New York Times Notable Fiction & Poetry books of 2003. The novel became a best-seller. The Dogs of Babel was the first book that Parkhurst wrote; it was not the first novel that Parkhurst envisioned.Parkhurst, Carolyn. \\"Ideas for Sale.\\" Powells Books. Retrieved on December 15, 2010. Plot introduction The book is narrated by Paul Iverson, a linguist who calls home one day to find out his wife is dead. He is very troubled by this and therefore for the remainder of the book he is trying to teach the only witness of her death, his dog Lorelei, to speak. Throughout the book, Paul uncovers more about his wife's last day and remembers events through their life they led up to it. =Explanation of the novel's title= The Dogs of Babel is an allusion to the Tower of Babel, the Biblical story that explains the existence of different languages. Like the builders in the story, Paul is hampered by the differences in communication between himself and Lorelei. Plot summary Paul Iverson called home to find a police officer answering the phone and suggesting him to come home. When he comes home he finds his wife, Alexandra \\"Lexy\\" Ransome, dead, fallen from an apple tree. The police declared it an accident, but Paul is bothered by the \\"anomalies\\" he finds, such as signs of someone cooking steak, a rearrangement of the book shelf, and the question as to what his wife was doing in the apple tree in the first place. The only witness to her death is their dog Lorelei, and Paul goes on a crusade to teach Lorelei to speak, in order to clear up the mystery. He cites several past attempts as evidence he will be successful, especially the case of Dog J, who was surgically altered by Wendell Hollis, \\"the Dog Butcher of Brooklyn\\", so that he could make human sounds. Paul leaves his job at the college, and dedicates his time to this single cause. As he attempts to teach Lorelei, Paul remembers how he and Lexy first met, at a yard sale where he bought a square hard-boiled egg mold from her. He recounts their week-long first date to Disney World, and to a wedding where Lexy delivered masks she made. This is the first time Paul learns about the masks she used to make for a living, and they are featured prominently throughout the rest of the book. Paul also remembers their wedding, and when he first learned of Lexy's depression, in the story she tells him about her adolescence. Unhappy with his lack of progress, Paul writes a letter to Wendell Hollis (now in prison) in hopes of getting ideas. In a response letter, he is directed to a man named Remo, who lives in Paul's neighborhood and is in charge of the Cerberus Society, a group dedicated to canine communication. At a meeting of the Cerberus Society, Paul is horrified and intrigued by the methods they use, and is especially excited about hearing Dog J, whom the society has kidnapped, speak. He is disappointed, though, when the mutilated dog is presented at the podium and is unable to say a single word; the rest of the society oblivious to this. The meeting is cut short when the police raid it and Paul flees to his house to find Lorelei gone. Finally realizing he will never be able to teach Lorelei to speak, and now left alone by both Lexy and Lorelei, Paul falls into an even greater depression. After hearing Lexy's voice on a commercial for a Psychic Hotline, he has been calling constantly, in hopes of finding the psychic Lexy talked to, Lady Arabelle. He finally reaches her, and is informed that Lexy was pregnant, a fact Paul knew but the reader did not. Lady Arabelle goes through the tarot reading she gave Lexy, and Paul is left to wonder how his wife took it. Paul eventually finds Lorelei in an animal shelter, her larynx removed by the men who kidnapped her. She is now not only unable to speak English, but to even bark. When he idly examines Lorelei's collar, he finds a subtle message from Lexy. He suddenly realizes that Lexy has sent him a message through the rearrangement of books, a quote from the story Tam Lin.\\"Had I known but yesterday what I know today, I'd have taken out your two gray eyes And put in eyes of clay; And had I known but yesterday you'd be no more my own I'd have taken out your heart of flesh And put in one of stone.\\" ‚Äì Quoted from Tam Lin, using words from the titles of the rearranged books. It is then Paul realizes what he has suspected is true, that Lexy committed suicide. Although he continues to mourn his wife's death, the closure Paul has gotten by learning of its circumstances allow him to return to the world. He goes back to his job at the college, and stops his reclusive ways. The story ends on a happy note, but it is still clear Paul is grieving for his wife.

Parkhurst packs a serious literary arsenal, which she wields to good effect. Layers of allegory, symbolism, and mythic reference add texture and tension to the plot's unfolding. The name Lexy itself can be read as a gloss on lexicon, one that Paul, a disciple as faithful as his biblical antecedent, tries to catalog. Lexy named Lorelei for the Rhine maiden who lures sailors to their deaths with her siren song, underscoring the notion that Paul's desire to hear the dog's voice could lead to his undoing. Just how far should an individual probe in the name of science and love before perversion outstrips purpose? Despite Parkhurst's flirtations with the supernatural in exploring that question, The Dogs of Babel remains at its core a humanistic parable of the heart's confusions.\\" Author Stephen King, also writing for Entertainment Weekly, wrote in a 2007 column on his likes and dislikes, \\"I believe that 70 percent of the fiction and nonfiction best-seller lists is dreck... I also believe that a book that sells a million copies--as The Dogs of Babel, by Carolyn Parkhurst, may eventually do--is not automatically trash.\\"  See also for allusions  * Tam Lin * Tower of Babel (through the title) References 2003 American novels Fiction about animal cruelty Novels about dogs 2003 debut novels ","title":"The Dogs of Babel"},{"id":"12802282","text":"Coole Pilate is a civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England, which lies to the north of Audlem and to the south of Nantwich.

History In 1974, NBC Tonight Show host Johnny Carson asked that the weekend broadcasts of \\"Best of Carson\\" (officially known as The Weekend Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson) come to an end (The Tonight Show was a 90-minute program at the time), so he could take two weeknights off; NBC would thus air those repeats on those nights rather than feed them to affiliates for broadcast on either Saturdays or Sundays. Given Johnny Carson's undisputed status as the king of late-night television, NBC heard his request as an ultimatum, fearing he might use the issue as grounds to defect to either ABC or CBS. To fill the gap, the network drew up some ideas and brought in Dick Ebersol - a prot√©g√© of legendary ABC Sports president Roone Arledge - to develop a 90-minute late-night variety show. Dick Ebersol's first order of business was hiring a young Canadian producer named Lorne Michaels to be the show-runner.SNL's Beginnings from NBC Television production in New York was already in decline in the mid-1970s (The Tonight Show had departed for Los Angeles two years prior), so NBC decided to base the show at their studios in Rockefeller Center to offset the overhead of maintaining those facilities. Lorne Michaels was given Studio 8H, a converted radio studio that prior to that point was most famous for having hosted Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra from 1937 to 1951, but was being used largely for network election coverage by the mid-1970s. When the first show aired on October 11, 1975 with George Carlin as its host, it was called NBC's Saturday Night because ABC featured a program at the same time titled Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell. After ABC cancelled the Cosell program in 1976, the NBC program changed its name to Saturday Night Live on March 26, 1977 (and subsequently picked up Bill Murray from Cosell's show in 1977, as well). Every night, Don Pardo introduced the cast, a job he'd hold for 39 years until his death in 2014. The original concept was for a comedy-variety show featuring young comedians, live musical performances, short films by Albert Brooks and segments by Jim Henson featuring atypically adult and abstract characters from The Muppets world. Rather than have one permanent host, Lorne Michaels elected to have a different guest host each week. The first episode featured two musical guests (Billy Preston and Janis Ian), and the second episode, hosted by Paul Simon on October 18, was almost entirely a musical variety show with various acts. The Not Ready For Prime Time Players did not appear in this episode at all, other than as the bees with Paul Simon telling them they were cancelled, and Chevy Chase in the opening and in \\"Weekend Update\\". Over the course of Season 1, sketch comedy would begin to dominate the show and SNL would more closely resemble its current format. Andy Kaufman made several appearances that were popular with the audience over the season, while The Muppets' Land of Gorch bits were regarded as a poor fit with the rest of the show. The Land Of Gorch sketches were essentially cancelled after episode 10, although the associated Muppet characters still made sporadic appearances after that. After one final appearance at the start of season two, the Muppet characters were permanently dropped from SNL. During the season, Lorne Michaels appeared on-camera twice, on April 24 and May 22, to make an offer to The Beatles to reunite on the show. In the first appearance, he offered a certified check of $3,000. In the second appearance, he increased his offer to $3,200 and free hotel accommodations. John Lennon and Paul McCartney later both admitted they had been watching SNL from Lennon's apartment on May8 (the episode after Lorne Michaels' first offer) and briefly toyed with actually going down to the studio, but decided to stay in the apartment because they were too tired.This Day in Music Spotlight: Live from New York{... It's The Beatles!Paul McCartney On The Beatles Almost Reuniting On 'Saturday Night Live':... Cast =Changes and notes= The first cast member hired was Gilda Radner.Gilda Radner#Saturday Night Live The rest of the cast included fellow Second City alumni Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, as well as National Lampoon \\"Lemmings\\" alumnus Chevy Chase (whose trademark became his usual falls and opening spiel that cued the show's opening) who was chosen as anchor for Weekend Update, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, and Groundlings alumnus Laraine Newman. The original head writer was Michael O'Donoghue, a writer at National Lampoon who had worked alongside several cast members while directing The National Lampoon Radio Hour. The original theme music was written by future Academy Award‚Äìwinning composer Howard Shore, who - along with his band (occasionally billed as the \\"All Nurse Band\\" or \\"Band of Angels\\") - was the original band leader on the show. Paul Shaffer, who would go on to lead David Letterman's band on Late Night and then The Late Show, was also band leader in the early years. George Coe was hired because NBC wanted to have an older person in the cast. Much of the talent pool involved in the inaugural season was recruited from the National Lampoon Radio Hour, a nationally syndicated comedy series that often satirized current events. This would be the only season for George Coe and Michael O'Donoghue as official cast members. While George Coe was billed only in the premiere, he was seen in various small roles through the season before leaving the show altogether. Michael O'Donoghue was credited through the (first) Candice Bergen episode and would continue to work for the show as a writer, as well as an occasionally featured performer (particularly as \\"Mr. Mike\\"), through season 5. =Cast roster= The Not Ready for Prime Time Players *Dan Aykroyd *John Belushi *Chevy Chase *George Coe (only episode: October 11, 1975) *Jane Curtin *Garrett Morris *Laraine Newman *Michael O'Donoghue (final episode: November 8, 1975) *Gilda Radner Bold denotes Weekend Update anchor Writers The original writing staff included Anne Beatts, Chevy Chase, Tom Davis, Al Franken, Lorne Michaels, Marilyn Suzanne Miller, Michael O'Donoghue, Herb Sargent, Tom Schiller, Rosie Shuster and Alan Zweibel.

The program enrolled over 100 students and costs run up to $4,000 a month. The program stated that it \\"...changes, reunites, and restores hope to families across the nation.\\" There has been some controversy in past years. The center is one of many facilities for troubled teens listed on the watch list on the International Survivors Action Committee (ISAC).website. For more information on the ISAC allegations, see the ISAC website here.. The facility closed in September 2009.Former Thayer Learning Center closes doors , By Andrew Bottrell, MyCameronnews.com, September 3, 2009 In October 2009, it was announced that John and Willa Bundy, of St. George, Utah had sold the grounds to Lakota John (also of St. George) for the White Buffalo Academy, which is to focus on Native American education. The campus was formerly Thayer College and a public school. Thayer College was founded in 1871 and closed in 1876. It reopened in 1877 as the Kidder Institute and operated under the auspices of the Congregational Church of Missouri. The building was used as a public school from 1934 to 1981.  Program information  The TLC offered a year- long program, and summer programs of four, eight, and twelve weeks in the summer for teenagers from the ages of thirteen to seventeen. A typical student, as described on Thayer Learning Center's website, is: *Acting defiant, disrespectful, and disobedient to authority figures at home and/or in school *Doing poorly, refusing to attend, or failing in school *Experimenting with drugs, alcohol, sex, and other risky behaviors *Having some minor legal troubles, shoplifting, taking the family car, etc. *Struggling with or showing signs of ADD/ADHD or ODD  Academics  Of the two phases of the TLC, only the second permits a student to participate in schooling. This is because TLC wants children to view education as a privilege. Thayer Learning Center employs several certified teachers and the children also have access to tutors. The self-directed study is done through Penn Foster High School, an accredited distance-learning program.  Motto  From TLC's website: > It is mastery of these simple things in life that brings true success in > life: *Spiritual Identity *Physical Fitness *Good Nutrition *Time Management > *Financial Management *Goal Setting *Service to others  Controversy  On November 3, 2004, an event took place which has sparked investigations and allegations of abuse concerning TLC's treatment of cadets. Roberto Reyes, of Santa Rosa, California, had been at Thayer Learning Center for less than a week when he died after being bitten by a spider, according to his autopsy. The Caldwell County, Missouri coroner said at the time that the autopsy concluded that the death was an accident and said Reyes could have been bitten before he arrived at the camp. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, studied the Reyes death, in late 2007, for a report released to the House of Representatives. The GAO report said Reyes had more than 30 cuts and bruises on his body when he died. The staff had interpreted Reyes‚Äô symptoms ‚Äì including falling down frequently, complaining of muscle soreness, vomiting and involuntarily urinating and defecating on himself ‚Äì as rebellion. After complaining of illness, Reyes was forced to the ground and held there on several occasions, according to the report. On one occasion, he had a 20-pound sandbag tied around his neck when he was too sick to exercise. Reyes was placed in the ‚Äúsick bay‚Äù the morning of the day he died, where a staff member checked on him mid-afternoon and found he had no pulse. The staff then called 911 and Reyes was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A state investigation found that Reyes might have survived if he had earlier medical attention and that records at the camp may have been falsified. No criminal charges were ever filed, though Reyes‚Äô parents filed a wrongful death suit that was settled out of court for about US$1 million dollars, according to the GAO.U.S. Rep wants fed probe of Mo. boot-camp death , by Megan Boehnke, STLtoday.com, October 10, 2007 (Reprint from Coalition against Institutionalized Child Abuse) In late October 2007, Representative George Miller, D-Calif., announced the GAO had referred the case to the FBI, stating, \\"In light of the seriousness of this case, in which neglect, if not outright abuse, likely contributed to the death of a child, I urge the FBI to treat this referral with urgency.\\"Missouri boot camp death referred to FBI, by The Associated Press, International Herald Tribune, October 25, 2007 Despite the allegations, as of 2009, the Thayer Learning Center had never been charged nor found to have committed any wrongdoing.

The TASER device is a less-lethal, not non-lethal, weapon, since the possibility of serious injury or death exists whenever the weapon is deployed. It is a brand of conducted electroshock weapon sold by Axon, formerly TASER International. Sharp barbed metal projectiles delivering an electric current are used, so misuse or abuse of the weapon increases the likelihood that serious injury or death may occur. In addition, the manufacturer has identified other risk factors that may increase the risks of use, including repeated, extended, or continuous exposure to the weapon. Because of this, the Police Executive Research Forum says that total exposure should not exceed 15 seconds. Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. said in 2020 that ‚Äúunder Georgia law, a taser is considered as a deadly weapon.‚Äù A 2012 study published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation found that Tasers can cause \\"ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest and even death.\\" At least 49 people died in 2018 in the US after being shocked by police with a Taser. Medical conditions or use of illegal drugs can significantly heighten such risk for subjects in an at-risk category.USA Amnesty International's concerns about Taser use, Statement to the U.S. Justice Department inquiry into deaths in custody Accessed on December 2, 2007 In some cases however, death occurred after Taser use coupled with the use of force alone, such as positional asphyxiation, with no evidence of underlying medical condition and no use of drugs.  \\"Less lethal\\" weapon Taser International used to call its devices \\"non lethal,\\" but changed and now uses the term \\"less lethal,\\" which is a term for \\"intermediate weapons\\" in the lexicon of law enforcement. While they are not technically considered lethal, some authorities and non-governmental organizations question both the degree of safety presented by the weapon and the ethical implications of using a weapon that some, such as sections of Amnesty International, allege is inhumane. As a consequence, Amnesty International Canada and other civil liberties organizations have argued that a moratorium should be placed on Taser use until research can determine a way for them to be safely used. Amnesty International has documented over 500 deaths that occurred after the use of Tasers.https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2012/02/usa-stricter-limits- urged-deaths-following-police-taser-use-reach/ Fulton County, Georgia District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. said in 2020 that ‚Äúunder Georgia law, a taser is considered as a deadly weapon.‚Äù A 2012 study published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation found that Tasers can cause \\"ventricular arrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest and even death.\\" In 2014, NAACP State Conference President Scot X. Esdaile and the Connecticut NAACP argued that Tasers cause lethal results. Reuters reported that more than 1,000 people shocked with a Taser by police died through the end of 2018 with 153 of those deaths being attributed to or related to the use of Tasers. At least 49 people died in 2018 in the US after being shocked by police with a Taser.  Other medical issues  San Francisco cardiologist and electrophysiologist Zian Tseng told the Braidwood Inquiry that a healthy individual could die from a Taser discharge, depending on electrode placement on the chest and pulse timing. He said that the risk of serious injury or death is increased by the number of activations, adrenaline or drugs in the bloodstream, and a susceptible medical history. After Tseng began researching Tasers three years ago, Taser International contacted him, asking him to reconsider his media statements and offering funding.\\"Stun guns not risk free, inquiry told\\", CBC News, May 12, 2008 Taser darts penetrate the skin, and therefore may pose a hazard for transmitting diseases via blood. U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements and the bloodborne pathogen protocols should be followed when removing a Taser probe. The removal process may also be addressed in an exposure control plan (ECP) in order to increase Taser probe removal safety. One issue often raised with the use of the Taser are the effects of Metabolic acidosis. This is a temporary condition where the body produces lactic acid within the muscles in the same way as strenuous physical exercise.https://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/features/taser_death/taser- death-tasered-to-deaths-by-tasers-2.html  Risk of fire  Tasers, like other electric devices, have been found to ignite flammable materials. For this reason Tasers come with express instructions not to use them where flammable liquids or fumes may be present, such as filling stations and methamphetamine labs. An evaluative study carried out in 2001 by the British Home Office investigated the potential for Tasers to ignite CS spray. Seven trials were conducted, in which CS gas containing methyl isobutyl ketone (a solvent in all CS sprays used by the United Kingdom police) was sprayed over mannequins wearing street clothing. The Tasers were then fired at the mannequins. In two of the seven trials, \\"the flames produced were severe and engulfed the top half of the mannequin, including the head\\". This poses a particular problem for law enforcement, as some police departments approve the use of CS before the use of a Taser.Safety flaw in police's new gun December 9, 2001 However, in the United States, a water or oil based pepper spray is more common than CS. This allows for the possibility of a Taser being used after an individual has been subjected to pepper spray without the concern for a fire.  Manufacturer's risk acknowledgments; breathing  Taser International has stated in a training bulletin that repeated blasts of a taser can \\"impair breathing and respiration\\". Also, on Taser's website it is stated that, for a subject in a state described as \\"excited delirium\\", repeated or prolonged stuns with the Taser can contribute to \\"significant and potentially fatal health risks\\". (The term \\"excited delirium\\" is not recognized by the American Medical Association or American Psychological Association. but was recently recognized by the American College of Emergency Physicians). In such a state, physical restraint by the police coupled with the exertion by the subject are considered likely to result in death or more injuries. Critics alleged that electroshock devices can damage delicate electrical equipment such as pacemakers, but tests conducted by the Cleveland Clinic found that Tasers did not interfere with pacemakers and implantable defibrillators.Cleveland Clinic Study Demonstrates TASER X26 Does Not Affect Short-Term Function of Implantable Pacemakers and Defibrillators May 16, 2007 Probe removal safety  # Taser probes (also known as Taser darts) qualify as a \\"sharp\\" according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) definition of \\"Sharps\\". This is important because the proper removal and treatment of a sharp is an OSHA issue in the US. # If an individual receives a \\"needlestick\\" during the Taser dart removal, or if an individual is exposed to bloodborne diseases during the removal, the incident is called an \\"exposure incident\\". The individual subject to the exposure incident may have or have not contracted bloodborne diseases while removing the Taser dart or while having the Taser dart removed. Extensive testing is the next step in the process. This can be an expensive and stressful event. Possible bloodborne diseases that may be contracted include HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other bloodborne pathogens\\". Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is also a bloodborne pathogen. # Current methods of removal: OSHA does not give clear guidance as to how to remove the probes, the guidelines only state that the removal must be done safely. Current methods of Taser Darts include removing the probes by hand, removing the probe with pliers or similar tools, or using the D.A.R.T. Pro and X-TRACTOR TIP Removal System made by Global Pathogen Solutions. When handling contaminated sharps OSHA guidelines should always be followed.Special precautions should be taken when a Taser dart is being removed from sensitive areas. # Disposal issues: Proper disposal of the contaminated darts includes placing the probes into a puncture-resistant, leak-proof container. # OSHA requirements and the Bloodborne Pathogen Protocols should be followed when removing a Taser probe. The removal process may also be addressed in an Exposure Control Plan in order to increase Taser probe removal safety.  Cardiac arrests, lawsuits, and effectiveness  On September 30, 2009, the manufacturer Taser International issued a warning and new targeting guidelines to law enforcement agencies to aim shots below the chest center of mass as \\"avoiding chest shots with ECDs avoids the controversy about whether ECDs do or do not affect the human heart\\"TASER Law Enforcement Warnings Calgary Police Service indicated in a news interview that the rationale for the warning was \\"new medical research that is coming out is showing that the closer probe to heart distances have a likelihood, or a possibility, that they may affect the rhythm of the heart\\". Taser \\"recommended officers avoid tasing suspects in the chest area, citing the potential for cardiac arrests, lawsuits and effectiveness of the device\\". Central Texas Constable Richard McCain, whose deputy used a Taser weapon against an unarmed 72-year-old woman (resulting in a $40,000 lawsuit settlement), describes Taser's directive as \\"not really practical\\".  Deaths and injuries related to Taser use  While their intended purpose is to avoid the use of lethal force (firearms), 180 deaths were reported to have been associated with Tasers in the US by 2006. By 2019 that figure had increased to over 1,000https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/police-killed-1000-people-tasers- since-2000Parker Waichman Alonso LLP, Associated Press, June 14, 2006.

It is unclear in each case whether the Taser was the cause of death, but several legislators in the U.S. have filed bills clamping down on them and requesting more studies on their effects.KHAMPHA BOUAPHANH, AP file, Houston & Texas News. Retrieved December 3, 2007. A study led by William Bozeman of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center of nearly 1,000 persons subjected to Taser use concluded that 99.7% of the subjects had suffered no injuries, or minor ones such as scrapes and bruises, while three persons suffered injuries severe enough to need hospital admission, and two died. Bozeman's study found that \\"...paired anterior probe impacts potentially capable of producing a transcardiac discharge vector.\\" occurred in 21.9% of all deployments. Multiple studies have since concluded that CEW use directly impacts cardiac and brain function, and can lead to cardiac arrest as well as dangerously elevated heart rate. The head of the U.S. southern regional office of Amnesty International, Jared Feuer, claimed that 277 people in the United States have died after being shocked by a Taser between June 2001 and October 2007, which has already been documented. He also claimed that about 80% of those on whom a Taser was used by U.S. police were unarmed. \\"Tasers interfere with a basic equation, which is that force must always be proportional to the threat\\", Feuer said. \\"They are being used in a situation where a firearm or even a baton would never be justified.\\"William Dunham, Reuters, October 8, 2006. retrieved December 7, 2007.

According to the UK's Defence Scientific Advisory Council's subcommittee on the Medical Implications of Less-lethal Weapons (DoMILL), \\"The possibility that other factors such as illicit drug intoxication, alcohol abuse, pre-existing heart disease, and cardioactive therapeutic drugs may modify the threshold for generation of cardiac arrhythmias cannot be excluded.\\" In addition, Taser experiments \\"do not take into account real life use of Tasers by law enforcement agencies, such as repeated or prolonged shocks and the use of restraints\\".Amnesty International‚Äôs continuing concerns about Taser use (in the USA) 2006Amnesty International 2004 report USA: Excessive and lethal force?

Accessed 26 November 2007.

Amnesty International has reported several alleged cases of excessive electroshock gun use that possibly amount to torture.USA - Amnesty International 2003 They have also raised extensive concerns about the use of other electro-shock devices by American police and in American prisons, as they can be (and according to Amnesty International, sometimes are) used to inflict cruel pain on individuals.Amnesty International‚Äôs continuing concerns about taser use 2006 Tasers may also not leave the telltale markings that a conventional beating might. The American Civil Liberties Union has also raised concerns about their use, as has the British human rights organization Resist Cardiac Arrest.  Comparison to alternatives  Critics claim that risk-averse police officers resort to using Taser in situations in which they otherwise would have used more conventional, less violent alternatives, such as trying to reason with a cornered suspect.The Taser Effect: Two years after HPD armed itself with the stun guns, questions linger over how and how often the weapon is being used, January 14, 2007 Supporters claim that electroshock weapons such as Tasers are more effective than other means including pepper-spray (an eye/breathing inflammatory agent), batons or other conventional ways of inflicting pain, even handguns, at bringing a subject down to the ground with minimum physical exertion. Supporters claim that electroshock guns are a safer alternative to devices such as firearms. Taser International now uses the term, \\"less lethal\\" instead of \\"non-lethal,\\" which does not mean the weapon cannot cause death, but that it is not intended to be fatal, and in most cases is not.Police stun- gun may be lethal, firm admits October 3, 2005 Non-lethal weapons are defined as \\"weapons that are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitate personnel or material, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the environment.\\"  \\"Excited delirium\\"  The medical community does not recognize the term \\"excited delirium\\" as a valid medical condition and it is not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. While the term and condition is used and aggressively promoted by the manufacturer and who has funded several efforts to promote and lobby for its acceptance, the medical community has largely rejected excited delirium as a valid medical condition. The term \\"less-lethal\\" versus \\"non-lethal\\" is being used more frequently when referring to weapons such as Tasers because many experts feel that no device meant to subdue a person can be completely safe. The less-lethal category also includes devices such as pepper spray, tear gas, riot guns and batons, all of which have been reported as contributing or causative factors in deaths. One problem when comparing the Taser to other forms of force is that no precise statistics are kept in the U.S. on policing related deaths or the use of excessive force. In 2001, the New York Times reported that the U.S. government is unable or unwilling to collect statistics showing the precise number of suspects killed by the police or the prevalence of the use of excessive force. =Chronology= Several incidents have received publicity. ;2003 * In November 2003 in Las Vegas, Nevada, police officer Lisa Peterson was severely injured (including traumatic internal disc disruption and persistent dizziness) during a training exercise under controlled conditions. ;2004 A 2004 CBS News report described 70 deaths believed to be caused by the Taser, including 10 in August 2004 alone.

Wray of the Martinsville Police Department. The autopsy revealed that Jones was in good health with a healthy heart and no pre-existing conditions, as well as no drugs other than alcohol in his system. The medical examiner ruled that his death was the result of a random cardiac arrhythmia, with no direct cause. However, she explicitly ruled out all direct causes of this arrhythmia except for the Taser, which she stated could not be definitively ruled out \\"as a causative or contributive factor\\" in Jones' death. Critics have pointed to cases like these to show how Taser's aggressive litigation history involving medical examiners may have affected their rulings, or prevented them from decisively citing a Taser as the cause of death, despite the fact that all other causes were definitively ruled out. http://www.martinsvillebulletin.com/article.cfm?ID=20777 Martinsville Bulletin, October 2009 * April 16, 2009, Robert Mitchell, a 5-foot 2-inch 110 lb 16-year-old with a learning disability, was tasered and died after fleeing a vehicle in which he was a passenger during a routine traffic stop.http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/05/28/michigan.taser.death/ CNN, May 2009 ;2010 * May 21, 2010, Tybee Island, Georgia, an 18-year-old man with autism is injured after being tasered by police. * July 2010, A stand-off in Rothbury between British police and armed fugitive Raoul Moat ended after two Tasers were discharged, possibly causing Moat to pull the trigger to end his own life.

Excited delirium has been questioned as a medical diagnosis.Death by Excited Delirium: Diagnosis or Coverup? February 26, 2007 * Several deaths occurred as a result of injuries sustained in struggles. In a few of these cases head injury due to falling after being shocked contributed to later death. Some police departments, like that of Clearwater, Florida, have tried to eliminate such incidents by prohibiting taser use when the suspect is in danger of falling.Another Taser Death - In Clearwater April 07, 2006 In 2015, the Washington Post reported that in the 11-month period from January to November 2015, 48 people died in the United States in incidents in which police used Tasers, according to police, court, and autopsy records. https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2015/11/26/improper- techniques-increased-risks/ A study published by the American Journal of Cardiology found that California police departments that introduced Tasers experienced significant increases in the numbers of in-custody sudden deaths and firearm deaths in the first full year following deployment. The rates declined to predeployment levels in subsequent years. No significant change in the number of officer injuries was found. A study by the Potomac Institute concluded: \\"Based on the available evidence, and on accepted criteria for defining product risk vs. efficacy, we believe that when stun technology is appropriately applied, it is relatively safe and clearly effective. The only known field data that are available suggest that the odds are, at worst, one in one thousand that a stun device would contribute to (and this does not imply \\"cause\\") death. This figure is likely not different than the odds of death when stun devices are not used, but when other multiple force measures are. A more defensible figure is one in one hundred thousand.\\" After hearing many witnesses and briefs the reportSTUDY OF THE CONDUCTIVE ENERGY WEAPON‚ÄìTASER June, 2008 by the Canadian House of Commons, Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security makes 17 recommendations as a result the death due to the repetitive tasering of a Polish immigrant at the Vancouver International airport. An investigation by the Canadian Press and Canadian Broadcasting Corporation found that one-third of those shot by a Taser by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police received injuries that required medical attention as a result. The news agencies used Freedom of Information requests to obtain the Taser-use forms filled out by RCMP officers from 2002 to 2007.One-third of people shot by Taser need medical attention: probe, CBC News, June 17, 2008 Although the TaserTASER X26E Operating Manual is a programmable device, the controlling software does not limit: a) the number of the bursts of pulses and the time between bursts while the trigger is held down continuously, or b) the number of times the shock cycles can be repeated. Thus the design does not adequately reduce the likelihood that the victim's heart enters into a deadly ventricular fibrillation. According to a study presented at the Heart Rhythm Society's 2007 Scientific Sessions, Tasers may present risks to subjects with implanted pacemakers.Study Shows Tasers Pose Potential Risks for Pacemaker Patients: Weapons May Cause Arrhythmias in Patients With Cardiac Devices May 11, 2007 However, a study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic in 2007 on a single animal determined that a standard five- second Taser X26 application \\"does not affect the short-term functional integrity of implantable pacemakers and defibrillators.... The long-term effects were not assessed.\\" A study conducted by electrical engineer James Ruggieri and published December 2005 in the Journal of the National Academy of Forensic Engineers measured a Taser's output as 39 times more powerful than specified. The study concluded that the discharge is sufficient to trigger ventricular fibrillation, a 50 percent risk according to the IEC 479-1 series of electric safety standards. Ruggieri said that high rise-time pulses breaks down skin tissue, decreasing its resistance and increasing current through the body.\\"Study raises concerns over Tasers' safety\\", Arizona Republic, February 13, 2006 Ruggieri showed that when the skin resistance drops lower than the device's region of linear operation, the current dramatically increases. A later studyAnalysis of the Quality and Safety of the Taser X26 devices tested for Radio-Canada / Canadian Broadcasting Corporation by National Technical Systems, Test Report 41196‚Äê08.SRC December 2, 2008 done by Pierre Savard, Ing., PhD., Ecole Polythechnique de Montreal, et al., for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), reproduced the results of the Ruggieri study and indicated that the threshold of energy needed to induce deadly ventricular fibrillation decreased dramatically with each successive burst of pulses. The threshold for women may be less.The Electric Shock Questions - Effects and Symptoms 2005 A 2007 study published in The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology questioned the apparent contradiction created by the claim that the Taser X26 does not stimulate the heart muscle, while clearly causing skeletal muscle contraction and stimulation. They estimated the average current pulse of the X26 at 1 ampere. They concluded that it is primarily proximity (or lack thereof) of the heart to the electrodes that prevents stimulation of the heart, along with the short duration of the pulse, which allows the heart to return to near its baseline state prior to the next pulse, due to the larger time constant for the heart muscle vs skeletal muscles. They estimated a 0.4% chance of heart muscle stimulation among the general population with optimum (or worst case) electrode placement, which would normally resolve itself with the resumption of a normal heart beat. In 2006, the US National Institute of Justice began a two-year study into Taser- related deaths in custody.Justice Department looks into deaths of people subdued by stun guns July 13, 2006 A Chicago study suggests that use of the Taser can interfere with heart function. A team of scientists and doctors at the Cook County hospital trauma center stunned 6 pigs with two 40-second Taser discharges across the chest. Every animal was left with heart rhythm problems and two of the subjects died of cardiac arrest. One of the subjects died three minutes after being shot indicating, according to researcher Bob Walker, that \\"after the Taser shock ends, there can still be effects that can be evoked and you can still see cardiac effects.\\"\\"Chicago study calls Taser's safety claims into question\\", CBC News, January 30, 2008  Other legal issues and court cases  According to Taser International, Tasers are intended \\"to incapacitate dangerous, combative, or high-risk subjects who pose a risk to law enforcement/correctional officers, innocent citizens, or themselves\\". Tasers are illegal or subject to legal restrictions on their availability and use in many jurisdictions. According to Taser International, the taser is legal for civilian use without restriction in 34 states in the United States, and legal with some form of restriction in the remaining states in the United States, with the exception of the state of Hawaii, where the Taser is illegal for civilian use.https://buy.taser.com/pages/state-requirements Police officers in at least five US states have filed lawsuits against Taser International claiming they suffered serious injuries after being shocked with the device during training classes. Summit County, Ohio Medical Examiner Lisa J. Kohler cited Taser use as a cause of death in three cases, Mark D. McCullaugh, Dennis S. Hyde, and Richard Holcomb. Taser International sued, and on May 2, 2008, visiting judge Ted Schneiderman ordered the Medical Examiner to remove all references to \\"Taser\\" in the reports and change the cause of death in McCullaugh's case from \\"Homicide\\" to \\"Undetermined.\\"Autopsy findings must be changed, judge rules.

The report is available from the RCMP under access to information, but is censored (e.g., no recommendations). The report as released by the RCMP may be found on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation website www.cbc.ca. The Report reviews how the RCMP made the decisions to introduce the conducted energy weapons, training, policies and procedures, and accountability. The report is approximately 150 pages and provides an excellent analysis on how a police force adopted the Taser. The authors of the report argued that the police did not do their due diligences, is concerned about training and the issues of accountability. The report also pointed out that the police in Canada have misclassified the Taser as a prohibited weapon whereas under the criminal code it is referred to as a prohibited firearm, and refers to excited delirium as \\"folk knowledge\\".

Work  Bailey's research interests have been in the fields of research methods, systems theory and environmental demography and ecology. = Sociology and new systems theory = In his 1994 work Sociology and new systems theory. Toward a theoretical synthesis, Bailey questioned if in those days social systems theory really existed, and if science could speak of a new social systems theory. In Bailey's opinion the works in this fields in those days did not bears much resemblance to the original action theory of Talcott Parsons since the 1950s. = Social entropy theory = One of the main focuses of Bailey was the development a macro- sociological systems theory, which he named social entropy theory. In this the concept of social entropy stood for a \\"measure of the natural decay of the structure or of the disappearance of distinctions within a social system.\\"Charles Fran√ßois ed., International Encyclopedia of Systems and Cybernetics, 2001. p. 537  See also  * Living systems theory * Sociology * Taxonomy  Publications  Bailey wrote several books, articles and papers.
