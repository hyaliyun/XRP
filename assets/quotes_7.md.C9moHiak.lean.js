Description The station occupies an area of approximately and is situated approximately west of Meekatharra. The property adjoins Nookawarra Station. The station has expanses of mulga, limestone gibber, rocky outcrops, floodplains and river and creek systems. History Landscape at Mileura Station Mileura Station was established in 1885 by Victorians Henry (Harry) Bowring Walsh (1856-1920) and his younger brother, Frederick Richard Walsh (1861-1938). With financial assistance from their father, Frederick Walsh (1831-1905) of Hawthorn, Victoria the brothers purchased about half (700,000 acres) of Nookawarra Station from the then owner, explorer Frank Wittenoom. The purchase price of ten thousand pounds included 7,000 sheep and 500 head of cattle. The brothers called their new station \\"Mileura\\" - the name of the hill from which Wittenoom had surveyed the country in 1875. A stone homestead was erected in 1890; other infrastructure, such as fences, permanent watering points and an eight-stand shearing shed soon followed. The station was held by various members of the brothers' respective families until 1947, when Godfrey Henry (Bill) Walsh, Frederick Richard Walsh's eldest son, became the sole owner. Bill Walsh died prematurely and the station became the property of his wife, Margery Walsh, in 1949. Her son Matcham Walsh took over the management of the station in 1956, becoming sole owner in 1967. At its peak Mileura ran 18,000 Merino sheep and 500 shorthorn cattle. The station was sold in 2004 to Cynthia and Gregory Stoney, who sold all the sheep in favour of increased cattle numbers. They sold it in 2013 to Michael and Anna Tierney. Science During Matcham Walsh's era (1956-2004) Mileura was the site of widespread and on-going scientific research into the ecosystem of the mulga rangeland. This was led by Dr Stephen Davies, PhD, ScD Cantab., head of CSIRO Wildlife Research in Western Australia 1969-1983 and an associate professor of Environmental Biology at Curtin University from 1989. Other scientists to lead research based at Mileura included Professor John Valley of the University of Wisconsin, Maddison USA and Professor Simon Wilde of Curtin University WA, who with their respective teams located and dated the 4.4 billion year old zircons which showed that life might have existed on Earth as much as 800 million years before the oldest known micro-fossil. In 1999 Mileura was selected as a potential site for the international Square Kilometre Array radio-telescope - the largest such project ever undertaken. Extensive radio tests were carried out at Mileura in the years 2000-2005 but in 2006, due to compromised radio quietness in the Mileura area, it was decided to move the site south-west to Boolardy Station. Indigenous occupation In the 1950s Stephen Davies and Matcham Walsh arranged radio carbon-dating of a hearth in a cave in the Ejah Breakaway, about 18 km south/west of the homestead. It placed occupation there as far back as 1100 CE. It seems likely that the cave, well positioned near a water hole and having a panoramic view over the surrounding plains, was once an Aboriginal resting place, or perhaps a ceremonial site. Scratch markings on the ceiling of the cave could be construed as maps of the area. As of 2017 Mileura falls within the Wadjarri Yamatji native title area.

The race was actually restarted with 10 laps to go but because the track was still too wet to drive on, Danica Patrick spun immediately when the green flag came out, resulting in a multiple car crash. Will Power was involved as well and was very mad about the call, like multiple other drivers and team owners were. They were mad because the race got restarted, while they all said that the track was still too wet to race on during the caution period. Oriol Servi√† took over the lead from Ryan Hunter- Reay during the last restart but because the restart heavily failed as the track was still too wet, the race would be red flagged and the order like how the drivers were running before the aborted restart, would count as the unofficial race results. This means Ryan Hunter-Reay was declared winner. Newman/Haas Racing and Chip Ganassi Racing filed protests regarding to the finish because of Servia's pass off Hunter-Reay on the aborted restart. The hearing was scheduled on August 22, which would also include Andretti Autosport. The unofficial results would not change and Ryan Hunter-Reay would become the official winner of the race.

A spin-off from the 2006 film This Is England, it is also a sequel to the series This Is England '86 and This Is England '88. This Is England '90 was originally due in late 2012, but in July 2012, Meadows announced that the production had been put on hold in order for him to complete his documentary about reunited Manchester rock band The Stone Roses,Metro, 4 July 2012: This Is England ‚Äô90 production halted for Shane Meadows' Stone Roses doc Retrieved 30 August 2012 and the actors were still waiting for confirmation as to when filming would start.Metro, 29 August 2012: This Is England star Chanel Cresswell admits 1990 update isn‚Äôt confirmed Retrieved 30 August 2012 In March 2014, Meadows confirmed that shooting would start later in the year although he had not yet finished the script. He also confirmed that this will likely be the final series of the saga. In October 2014, Channel 4 announced that filming had begun in Sheffield and the series would be made up of four episodes due to air in 2015. On 31 July 2015, the first trailer for the series was released to YouTube, on the Channel 4 channel. The series premiered on 13 September 2015. Overview This Is England '90 looks at rave culture and the 1990 FIFA World Cup.This is England '90 Facebook page Retrieved 30 August 2012 It features Shaun, Kelly, Trev, Harvey and Gadget who are involved in the rave scene. Combo is released from prison after serving his sentence for the manslaughter of Mick in This Is England '86. Flip and Higgy from the moped gang in This Is England '86 are more prominently featured in the cast in this series. Similar to the film and the two previous series, '90 featured a montage of the era at the beginning of the first episode, featuring the resignation of Margaret Thatcher in November 1990 which is set to the 1988 song \\"There She Goes\\" by The La's (which was re- released in October 1990). The music of The Stone Roses was also featured prominently. Each episode is set against a different season of the year, starting with Spring, and having significant time pass between each episode. Production Much of the filming took place in Sheffield, particularly in the Gleadless area, with the Park Hill flats serving as the location for Harvey and Gadget's flat. Episodes=Spring Milky, Woody, Lol and the gang are all reunited in the classic era of 1990s rave culture, Following on from the events of 1988, Woody and Lol are back together and have a little baby, Jimmy. Lol has a job running the local school kitchen with Chrissie, Kelly and Trev working as dinnerladies, while Woody stays at home with the kids. Gadget, Harvey, Kelly, Trev and Shaun are all following the Madchester rave scene, smoking cannabis in bongs and taking whatever drugs they have, usually provided by Harvey who appears to have become a low-level dealer on the estate. After a conversation with Cynthia about the events of '88, Shaun goes to find Smell who dumped him in '88 for cheating on her with Fay after the Christmas production at college. When he finally managed to find her ending a day at her new college course, Shaun tells Smell he has missed her and invites her to a Manchester-themed discoth√®que at the town hall but Smell is reluctant to go, then tells him she has met someone else, which hits him hard, prompting his crying. Meanwhile, Woody and Lol have gone round to Woody's parents' house where there is a certain surprise for Woody, after seeing that his ex ‚Äì Jennifer ‚Äì is staying over, after a row with her parents. A certain blast from the past bursts out of the cupboard... Mr Squires, Woody's old boss. He offers Woody a partnership but Woody gets upset and angry because he doesn't want to end up like his dad and then an argument erupts. Later Shaun is seen round at Harvey and Gadget's flat taking bong hits. Shaun tells the lads what happened when he saw Smell and then Harvey jokes about it, impersonating Smell and cheering up Shaun. Afterwards Woody, Lol and the gang are all round at Lol's mums talking about the disco, then Kelly and Trev persuade Lol to attend so the girls get ready and head off. Shaun, Harvey and Gadget are heading into the disco when Shaun suddenly starts suffering with dizziness and nausea, a reaction to the bong hits he previously took, but Harvey gives him some speed to perk him up for the night. The girls meet the lads in the disco and \\"Fools Gold\\" starts to play and everybody gets pumped up and raves. After the disco a Goth-like lad called Harrison goes over to Shaun to tell him that he is Smell's boyfriend, and he is sorry Smell can't make it, but then Shaun, feeling disrespected in front of his mates, over-reacts and a skirmish occurs. After things have calmed down everyone goes home and we see Woody asleep and Lol getting ready to go to bed. Summer Shaun, Harvey, Gadget, Kelly and Trev all pack into a small car, venturing into the countryside in search of a rave. On the way they meet Flip and Higgy, whose car has broken down, so all seven squeeze into one car. After a long day trying to find their intended venue, they give up and begin to camp out in the woods for the night. In the distance, they hear the sound of drums and assume it's the rave they've been trying to find. Walking down into a field they stumble upon a commune of new-age travellers and spontaneously join their party. Shaun finds comfort with an attractive older lady, whilst Kelly, already drunk on alcohol and high on Ecstasy, is encouraged by three older men to smoke drugs before being raped by them in a trailer. After waking, whilst watching the sunrise, a tearful Kelly confides in Gadget \\"I'm a fucking slag Gadget...I just do what I fucking want, Gadge, that's the fucking problem\\". Lol, Woody and Milky stay at home, spending the afternoon having a barbecue in their front garden. When the phone rings in the evening, Lol says it is her mother and takes the call in another room. She later tells Woody that it wasn't her mother, but it was Combo, who is about to be released from prison and needs a place to stay. Autumn Lol and Woody invite everyone round to their house for Sunday dinner. After the meal, they inform everyone that it wasn't Combo who killed Mick, but Lol. Lol also tells her sister Kelly that Mick raped Trev the night before he was killed. Kelly refuses to believe that her father was a bad person. Lol and Woody continue with the news that Combo is about to be released from prison and has nowhere to stay. Once it becomes clear that Combo will be staying with them, Milky refuses to let his daughter stay under the same roof as the racist man who beat him half to death. Shaun's place at college is reconsidered and he gains a place on the photography course, much to Cynthia and Sandhu's excitement. Woody proposes to Lol, and Combo moves in with them, meanwhile Milky prepares an attack on Combo. Winter While Lol and Woody plan their wedding, Milky plans revenge against Combo who is now about to start his first day working at a local community centre. Harvey catches Kelly smoking heroin in his bathroom and instructs her to leave immediately. When Gadget finds out he has a blazing row with Harvey before leaving to find Kelly. Shaun has started his photography course at college, making use of his new camera bought by his mother and Mr. Sandhu. He and fellow photography student Juliette begin an assignment together. While out taking photographs, the pair meet a distressed Gadget as he looks for Kelly. Shaun joins Gadget in the search. They eventually find her in an isolated spot where her father's ashes were scattered. Both offer to find her a place to stay, but she refuses their help, mocks Gadget's pity and leaves with a man friend who is unknown to Shaun and Gadget, and who Kelly is later seen living with. Combo enjoys his first day at work at the community centre. After saying he is going out for lunch, he is surprised by Milky waiting outside, wanting to go for a cup of tea and a talk \\"man to man\\" about the racist attack that Combo launched on him seven years ago that left him clinging to life. During a long drive into the countryside, anxious that several caf√©s have been left behind, Combo becomes suspicious. Sitting in a cafe, Combo tells Milky he was a coward for what he did, and that he was secretly jealous of the love Milky had from his family. Milky's relative, Rudy (played by Vauxhall Jermaine), arrives with other family members and it soon transpires that promises were made to avenge the attack. Combo apologises to Milky again, saying he hopes Milky will one day forgive him. He is then ushered into the back of a van. At some disused dockside buildings, Combo is handed over to two white men. Crying and screaming he is dragged away. He is not seen again. Two months later, at the reception after Woody and Lol's church wedding ceremony, Smell, who is with her boyfriend Harrison, tries to create a scene after meeting Shaun's new girlfriend, Juliette, whom she describes as a \\"hot mess\\". Her angry behaviour mirrors Shaun's reaction to his meeting with Harrison at the disco. 'Missing' Kelly is then seen sitting by herself in a room in a run down drugs-den. During a quiet interlude from the wedding festivities, when alone in the snooker room of the working men's club, Lol asks Milky if he has seen or heard from Combo. He evades the questions, reacting in a non-committal way, rather uneasily. Lol has noticed that Milky is subdued and not quite himself, and is suspicious that Milky was involved in the disappearance. Kelly leaves the house and walks to her sister's wedding reception. She attempts to leave a card and disappear before she is seen by anyone, but is spotted by Lol. The two sisters reconcile during a deep conversation and eventually Kelly agrees to stay and join in the wedding celebrations, becoming re-united with her family and friends. The episode ends with a wedding-dance party scene containing most of the major characters from the film and television series, such as Meggy and Pob. The happy montage is intercut with a lone Milky standing at the bar brooding over his part in Combo's disappearance.

Potential sequel set in the year 2000 Although This Is England '90 was previously expected to be the final instalment in the This Is England series, in interviews close to the May 2016 BAFTA awards, Meadows talked about the potential of one final film as a way of \\"bookending [the series] for cinema and TV\\", saying \\"I think there's a film that's left in there ... there is still one little gem in there\\". He implied this would be a future release to end the series, shown simultaneously in cinemas and on television. Planning for another film was again confirmed in 2017, although no timescale has been discussed for the project. In May 2019, while promoting The Virtues with Stephen Graham, Meadows once again talked of a final film \\"set at the millenium\\" and which would be titled This Is England '00 if it were to come to fruition. Although Meadows has not yet written a script for the film, he described the story as \\"an absolute banger\\". The idea of a sequel has been reiterated by Shane Meadows as recently as April 2020, who expressed his hope for This Is England '00 to be filmed around ten years after This Is England '90 for continuity reasons.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8OVjk6Spu0 ReferencesExternal links Shane Meadows website *Warp Films website Television series set in 1990 2010s British drama television series 2015 British television series debuts 2015 British television series endings 2010s British television miniseries Channel 4 television dramas Sequel television series English-language television shows Television shows set in Sheffield Television shows set in South Yorkshire BAFTA winners (television series) Live action television shows based on films This Is England ","title":"This Is England '90"},{"id":"35982970","text":"Zazon (born √âlisabeth Castro, 12 October 1976) is a French filmmaker and actress. She is the daughter of architect Roland Castro. Biography Elizabeth Castro was born in Paris on 12 October 1976, while her parents were living on the rue Saint-Honor√©. Her father, the architect Roland Castro, had been a radical student activist at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux- Arts during the protests of 1968. Her mother was a revolutionary feminist. She embarked on an artistic career, taking courses in acting and comedy, and obtaining a Master in Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts in France. From 2001 to 2002, she lived in Los Angeles, where she worked as a waitress and became the fianc√©e of a producer of Hollywood blockbusters. However, he broke off the engagement when he found out about her father's politics. She returned to France and began her acting career, at first producing her own videos for the web. She made her first short film √Ä la p√™che aux poules (fishing for chickens) in 2002, followed by Summertime in collaboration with Fanny Glissant. She first created the character Zazon in 2003. In 2004, she appeared in Nous ne sommes pas des anges (We are not angels) on Canal+. In 2006, she appeared on France 3 in C'est bon pour le moral (It's good for morale). She and Peter Cattan founded Otoko films and produced the series Are you Buddha. She became known for wacky skits, videos and improvisations, playing characters such as Zazon in the subway, the disruptive Toutaz (France 4 from January 2007) and the hysterical eco Miss Green (France 4 2008). In some episodes she plays the false innocent, where the reactions of passers-by are captured by a hidden camera. In others she acts out family neuroses. From February to May 2012, she appeared in the one-woman show Sous les pav√©s‚Ä¶ les pav√©s at l'Espace Saint-Honor√© in Paris.

The BFWG is affiliated to the International Federation of University Women (IFUW), of which it was a founder member, and University Women of Europe (UWE).Allan University Bodies, 1990 p. 47. History The British Federation of University Women was founded in 1907, in Manchester, \\"to afford a means of communication and of united action in matters affecting the interests of women\\". Ida Smedley, Sarah Burstall, Dr Catherine Chisholm, Dr Merry Smith and Miss Coignou were the first to set up BFUW in order to support the progress of women in medicine, academia and public life. Other notable women who were part of BFWG in its early years included Winifred Cullis, Rose Sidgwick and Caroline Spurgeon. Associations were set up across Britain to pursue these aims by lobbying government and by fulfilling the BFUW motto: \\"Let us perfect the art of friendship\\". During World War I, BFUW compiled a register of university women offering themselves for public service which was used by the Board of Trade. After the war there was still the need to work for the opening of the professions to women, though a few members gained places in local government, notably Sybil Campbell, Giekie Cobb (the first woman barrister to hold a brief), Margaret Kydd (one of the first women to take silk), and Rose Heilbron. Equal pay was an important focus between the wars, particularly with relation to teaching and the civil service; as was the abolition of the marriage bar for working women. Before and during World War II, BFUW supported refugees from fascism. In 1992 the name was changed to the British Federation of Women Graduates in response to changing times and the need to be inclusive of all who have degrees or equivalent qualifications. Structure BFWG has its headquarters in London. The Management Team is supported by an Executive Committee composed of Regional Representatives and Co-ordinators of International and European Relations. Local Associations enable members to \\"perfect the art of friendship\\" while promoting the Federation‚Äôs aims. Independent membership is available for those who do not live near an Association. Membership is open to all women graduates, irrespective of subject, university or nationality. Scholarships Since 1912, BFUW/BFWG has given scholarships to assist women in academia. Caroline Spurgeon was the first recipient and she was followed by many notable women, including Ursula Dronke, Philippa Foot, Christine Hamill and Eila Campbell. Now the BFWG Scholarship Fund annually gives scholarships to outstanding women in their final year of a PhD who are registered at a British University. In 1992, BFWG sold Crosby Hall and set up the BFWG Charitable Foundation, known as Funds for Women Graduates (FfWG), which gives grants to postgraduate women at British universities who are in financial need. International Federation of University Women In 1919, Caroline Spurgeon and Rose Sidgwick from BFUW and Virginia Gildersleeve, Dean of Barnard College and a representative of the American Association of Collegiate Alumnae, were instrumental in setting up the International Federation of University Women (IFUW). BFWG is still a vital part of IFUW and BFUW/BFWG members have served on its Board. Through its affiliation to IFUW, BFWG has consultative status at the UN; supports development in other affiliates by contributions to the IFUW Bina Roy Partners in Development programmes; and helps displaced women graduates via the Hegg- Hoffet Fund.

Suppabuddha is also the name of several other individuals mentioned briefly in the Theravada tradition. Sources According to the Mahavamsa, he was the son of king A√±jana and his wife YasodharƒÅ. He was the father of both BhaddakaccƒÅnƒÅ (Siddhartha's wife YasodharƒÅ) and Devadatta, the Buddha's rival, from his wife AmitƒÅ. He had two sisters, MƒÅyƒÅ and PajƒÅpatƒ´ and a brother, DandapƒÅni. As the mother of Buddha was Maya, that made him the uncle of the Buddha, and as his daughter was the wife of the Buddha, he became also the father-in-law to the Buddha. Western scholars note that the pattern of cross-cousin marriage described in the Mahavamsa genealogy is typical of historical marriage practices in Dravidian societies in Southern India, but not typically associated with Northeast India and the Ganges Basin of the historical Buddha. Thus, the genealogy ascribed to the Buddha by the Mahavamsa may reflect elaboration and interpretation that reflects local traditions rather than historical fact. According to the MahƒÅyƒÅna Abhini·π£krama·πáa S≈´tra (‰ΩõÊú¨Ë°åÈõÜÁ∂ì), Suprabuddha was a wealthy ShƒÅkyan who lived in Devadaha. He had eight daughters, the eldest of whom was MƒÅyƒÅ and the youngest, MahƒÅpajƒÅpatƒ´. Both of them married King Shuddhodana. The other six daughters married his three brothers, two sisters to each. Life According to the Theravada commentaries, the king was very offended because Prince Siddhartha had left his daughter Yasodhara to renounce the world and because his son Devadatta had come to regard him as his arch enemy. One day, knowing that the Buddha would be coming for almsfood, he got himself drunk and blocked the way. When the Buddha and the bhikkhus came, Suppabuddha refused to make way. Finding the road blocked, the Buddha and the bhikkhus turned back, and the Buddha remarked to Ananda that the king would be swallowed by the earth for being disrespectful towards a Buddha. Informed of this prediction, the king sealed himself up on a high floor of his palace as a precaution. However, on the seventh day predicted by the Buddha, a horse belonging to the king broke loose and the king went to attempt to calm it. He fell down the stairs and was swallowed by the earth, sharing the same eventual fate as his son, Devadatta. Others Named Suppabuddha Suppabuddha the Sakyan is one of several individuals by that given name identified in Pali literature. Others include: * Suppabuddha the Leper, a man born as a leper as punishment for having disparaged a Pratyekabuddha, who became a sotƒÅpanna after hearing Shakyamuni Buddha preach in RƒÅjagaha. He appears in the Udana and his story appears in two different variations, one including the intervention of the god Sakka, in the Udana and Dhammapada commentaries. * Suppabuddha, son of Vessabh≈´ Buddha in his last lay life. * An ancient king called Suppabuddha was a former birth of Eraka Thera, a monk mentioned in the Theragatha.

A stackfreed is a simple spring-loaded cam mechanism used in some of the earliest antique spring-driven clocks and watches to even out the force of the mainspring, to improve timekeeping accuracy. Stackfreeds were used in some German clocks and watches from the 16th to the 17th century, before they were replaced in later timepieces by the fusee. The term may have come from a compound of the German words starke (\\"strong\\") and feder (\\"spring\\"). History Drawing of 16th century watch with stackfreed Spring- driven clocks were invented around 1400 in Europe. Mainsprings allowed clocks to be portable and smaller than the previous weight-driven clocks, evolving into the first large watches around 1500. However spring-driven timepieces were much less accurate than weight-driven clocks, because the drive force (torque) exerted by a coiled spring, unlike a weight, is not constant, but is maximum when the spring is wound up and declines as the spring unwinds to turn the movement's wheels. The main cause of inaccuracy in early spring-driven timepieces was the large variation in force provided by the mainspring as it unwound during the timepiece's running period. The force of the mainspring, transmitted through the clock's gears, gives pushes to the oscillating balance wheel which keeps time. The primitive verge and foliot movement used in all early timepieces was very sensitive to the amount of force applied to it, particularly before the balance spring was added in 1658; the weaker the drive force applied by the mainspring, the slower the balance wheel would oscillate back and forth. So without some device to equalize the force of the mainspring, early clocks and watches slowed down drastically during the clock's running period as the mainspring lost force, causing inaccurate timekeeping. Two devices appeared in the first spring powered clocks to even out the power of the mainspring: the fusee and the stackfreed. The origin of the stackfreed is unknown. It is assumed it was invented in the southern Germanic states (Nuremberg and Augsburg) during the 16th century, since the early spring clocks which incorporated it came from there, but it may have been invented earlier. Drawings of stackfreeds appear in Leonardo da Vinci's Codex 1 (1492-1497) and M3 (1497-1499); possibly the device was brought to his attention by his German assistant Giulio. While the fusee went on to become the standard mainspring equalizer in European timepieces, the less satisfactory stackfreed was used exclusively in a few German timepieces; and disappeared after about a century. Surviving examples of stackfreed timepieces date from about 1530 to 1640.  How it works  Stackfreed in a watch See drawing, right. The stackfreed consists of a stiff spring arm (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an eccentric cam (D); usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the spring arm against the cam exerts a retarding force on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with the thickness of the cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the retarding force it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the retarding force gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed spring aided the weakened mainspring. Often (as shown at right) a solid uncut section in the cam's (E) gear teeth also functioned as stopwork, limiting the mainspring so it stopped before it was wound up all the way, and stopped before it unwound all the way. This restricted the mainspring to the center part of its range, further reducing force variation.  Advantages and disadvantages  The stackfreed was a very inefficient device. Since it worked by exerting an opposing friction force on the mainspring, it required more powerful mainsprings and higher gear ratios in watches, which may have introduced more variation in drive force. The fusee, the other mainspring compensation device, was much more efficient. The only advantages of the stackfreed were that it was easier to make and much thinner than the fusee, which, combined with the fact that it was located in unused space on the outside of the back plate, allowed stackfreed watches to be flatter. With the development of narrower, more compact fusees, the stackfreed disappeared from timepieces around 1630.

Most trade was on the North Saskatchewan River which was closer to the wooded beaver country. West of the Saskatchewan River Forks the two rivers run parallel to the northeast for about 100 miles. Between them there is a fair amount of forest. Shortly before 1785 Peter Pangman, an independent trader, built a place he called Fort des Isles and William Holmes of the North West Company built a post nearby. In 1785 William Tomison of the Hudson's Bay Company sent Mitchell Oman to build South Branch House at a ford later called Gardepuy's crossing. The two rival traders abandoned their posts and built new ones on the opposite side of the river 400 yards downstream. The explorer David Thompson was one of Oman's clerks here in 1786/87. In July 1794, following their destruction of Manchester House the year before, one or two hundred Gros Ventres attacked the HBC post. Only two company men were in the fort along with a handful of Indians. Two company officers, Magnus Annal and Hugh Brough, who were outside the fort were quickly killed. The two men inside barred the gate and hid in a cellar. The Gros Ventres broke in and butchered everyone inside including women and children, except for J. C. Van Dreil who managed to escape in a canoe after hiding in an abandoned cellar for eight hours. They next turned to the NWC post across the river. Duncan McGillivray's journal implies that the NWC people were unaware of what was happening at the HBC fort. An interpreter named Jacques Raphael was out riding and saw the Gros Ventres coming. He raced to the fort and got the men under arms. The first discharge from the fort drove the Indians back. They retired to cover and fired on the fort until they began to run low on ammunition. Their chief, L'Homme de Callumet, tried to lead a charge but was immediately shot by Raphael. The Gros Ventres recovered the chief's body and withdrew. Seeing the impossibility of defense or further trade, Louis Chatelain, the master, loaded all his men and goods on canoes and abandoned the fort. In 1805 both companies rebuilt their posts about 6 miles upstream. With the merger in 1821 the HBC took over and operated the post until 1870. The site is about 20 miles east of Fort Carlton on the North Saskatchewan River, about 10 miles west of Saint Louis, Saskatchewan and about 10 miles north of Batoche, Saskatchewan. It was on the right bank of the river with a hill in the background. Today the ruins are a Provincial Historic Site. There is a marker and ongoing minor archaeological work.

It was located about 4 miles west of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. It and was also called Peter Pond Fort, Fort Pond, Fort la Prairie, Fort des Prairies, Lower Settlement and Fort Sturgeon River. It was located on the north bank of the river just east of the mouth of the Sturgeon River (Saskatchewan) in the Aspen parkland country. To the south the grassland made a sort of \\"bay\\" into the forest. The woods to the north provided furs and the grassland to the south buffalo for food. About 1775 a group of \\"Pedlars\\" (independent traders from Montreal) were downriver near the old Fort de la Corne. Seeing the disadvantages of competition they formed a pool (in either 1775 or 1776) which by 1779 became the North West Company. Among them were Joseph Frobisher, Peter Pond, Peter Pangman, Nicholas Montour, William Bruce and Bartholomew Blondeau. In 1776 they moved upriver and built Fort Sturgeon. In the spring of 1778 Peter Pond set off with 5 canoes and 20 men, crossed the Methye Portage for the first time and wintered 30 miles south of Lake Athabasca. He returned next year with excellent furs, thereby opening up the Athabasca Country. In 1778 Pangman and Blondeau built a fort upstream near Silver Grove, Saskatchewan. In 1779 William Tomison of the HBC came up from Cumberland House and traded while the Pedlars were away. The post had more Indian troubles than most and there were several killings on both sides. In 1777 three men from Fort Sturgeon were killed allegedly for maltreatment of the Indians. In 1780 Indians burnt the fort to the ground when the traders were away. The Pedlars returned and built a new post \\"a little below the old House\\". Morton guesses this was on the north bank opposite Betts Island 1.5 miles above the Prince Albert bridge. Peter Fidler passed by in 1792 and saw only ruins. In 1794 David Grant had a post on the Sturgeon River but did poorly because of NWC competition and inability to control his men. The XY Company (1798‚Äì1804) had a post two miles above the Sturgeon and both the HBC and NWC built competing post on the Sturgeon River itself.

Retrieved October 17, 2019. Geography Asphalt is located west of Brownsville and it is served by Kentucky Route 655 (Segal Road) off of KY 70. It is southwest of KY 655's intersection with State Highway 70 at Windyville. Sites of interest The Mathias Willis Store House is located near Asphalt at the end of Salvage Road (formerly Cummins Road). It was a mid-19th century store building that served customers traveling along the Green River, which flows just south of the area. In 1987, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Churches Asphalt is the home to the Asphalt Church of Christ (formerly New Liberty Church), one of Edmonson County's several places of worship. Their Gospel Meetings, or revivals, are usually held in mid-June. In the week of June 7‚Äì10, 2015, the Asphalt Church celebrated their 140th anniversary, meaning that the church was believed to be established in 1875. According to the previous week's edition of the Edmonson News and the congregational members of the church, the church at its original location was burned down sometime in 1951 due to a faulty wiring. The church received its current name after being rebuilt at its current location in 1952. The church originally stood at the current location of the New Liberty Cemetery. In spite of the church's name change, Edmonson County road maps dating from the 1940s to 1977 still list it as the New Liberty Church. Education Students in Asphalt attend Edmonson County Schools, including the Edmonson County High School, in Brownsville. At one time Asphalt was served by their own school until the 1959-60 merger of all of Edmonson County's high schools in other communities. The Asphalt School building is still standing, but not in the condition to be used. Postal service Asphalt does not currently have a post office, so 42210, Brownsville's zip code is used.

History  The company was founded in 1996 by Brad Duffy, an Australian physiologist and ski enthusiast. In 1998, SKINS launched their first three product ranges: 'JetSkins' for travel, 'SportsSkins' for multi sports and 'SnowSkins' for Alpine pursuits. Australian cricket captain Steve Waugh was chosen as the public face of the new products. Initially, the range was limited to long tights only and was sold exclusively online and through telesales. By 2002, the product was still being manufactured in Sydney but was being sold through around 20 retail outlets in Australia. In the same year, Australian entrepreneur Jaimie Fuller was appointed as CEO of SKINS. In 2003, other styles were added to the SKINS range, including half-tights and tops, and the expanded manufacturing operation was moved to Fiji. The year after, SKINS lodged patents on their compression technology. In 2005, manufacturing was moved to China with a product redesign and a new range for women. SKINS were launched in the UK in 2006 with the US/global launch taking place the following year. SKINS currently sell over 160 different compression products including specific ranges for golf, cycling, triathlon and snow sports. The company currently has around 80 full-time members of staff and retails through more than 800 speciality retailers in their home territory of Australia. After filing for bankruptcy with the Swiss court in January 2019, the SKINS brand and associated intellectual property was acquired by Symphony Holdings, a public company based in Hong Kong, and placed under new management.  Advertising and controversy  SKINS has a history of bold and controversial advertising. A series of adverts that ran in 2005/6 caused the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to allege that SKINS had engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct. The adverts in question stated that \\"We don't pay sports stars to wear our product. They pay us.\\" The ACCC contested this claim and produced a list of athletes who were sponsored and paid by SKINS. In 2009 the Federal Court of Australia handed down judgment in favour of the ACCC and SKINS agreed to provide undertakings to the Court, pay costs and publish corrective advertisements. The same court also upheld an accusation of retail price maintenance against SKINS, who induced, by request, a retailer in Adelaide not to lower the retail prices of their products.. SKINS ran an advertising campaign in 2006 which featured the famous \\"Swoosh\\" logo of Nike, Inc. placed upside down across the mouths of athletes to form a grimace. Nike demanded SKINS to cease this advertising, which they did. However, the advertising campaign received praise for its creativity from the Advertising Federation of Australia.  Retail partnerships  In 2010, SKINS partnered with Chinese sportswear manufacturer Li-Ning with a range of co- branded products being produced for the Chinese market by the two companies. In 2012, SKINS has partnered with the Itochu Corporation of Japan to distribute SKINS products in Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.  Anti-doping campaigns  SKINS has been vocal opponents of blood doping in sports and were the first company to be certified by BikePure, an independent, not-for-profit organisation which advocates ethical cycling practices and conducts anti-doping research. In September 2013, SKINS launched an Anti- Doping initiative called Pure Sport, petitioning for change with the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency. Former Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson has joined the campaign; Johnson had his gold medal rescinded after the 1988 Summer Olympics after testing positive for the banned substance Stanozolol. In February 2014, Pure Sport also launched a campaign during the Sochi Winter Olympics. The aim was to showcase the inequality, discrimination and poor practices that took place before, and during the games with the hope of increasing awareness so that future mistakes are not replicated.  Other associations  The company was involved with the Mars Society Australia in the development of MarsSkin, a prototype spacesuit that was tested in the Flinders Ranges in Australia in August 2004. Their compression stockings are listed on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods as a medical device for reducing oedema.

Early life  Born Minesh Prafulchandra Mehta in Uganda, in 1957, to two teachers from India. After moving to Zambia, he completed high school, and enrolled in the pre-medical curriculum, graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Human Biology from the University of Zambia. He completed a residency at the University of Wisconsin, where he served as chief resident in radiation oncology.https://www.reuters.com/article/fl-baptist-health-s-fla- idUSnBw216457a+100+BSW20160121  Career Mehta is currently deputy director and chief of radiation oncology at Miami Cancer Institute at Baptist Health South Florida. Until January 2016, he served as medical director of the Maryland Proton Treatment Center at University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore launching, the area‚Äôs first proton treatment center. Prior to this till 2013 at Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University in Chicago, he was co-director of the Radiation Oncology Residency Training Program, mentoring many young physicians who have gone on to become prominent leaders in the field. He has designed and led numerous national and international clinical studies, receiving NIH and NCI grants and winning several honors, many for his research in brain and central nervous system tumors. In 1988, after completing his residency training at the University of Wisconsin, he joined the Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison as an Assistant Professor, eventually becoming tenured Professor and Department Chair by 1997. Among his many accomplishments were the scientific and clinical implementation of image- guided intensity modulated radiotherapy through an NIH-funded Program Project Grant, overseeing the development of robust translational programs combining radiotherapy with targeted agents integrating advanced imaging (he was the Principal Investigator for the Imaging and Radiation Sciences Program of the University of Wisconsin Cancer Center for 15 years), and providing national and international leadership in Brain Tumor Clinical Trials through his leadership of the Brain Tumor Committee of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG). The RTOG Brain Tumor Committee arguably became the most comprehensive clinical trial co-operative group committee for this disease category, completing the largest ever randomized trial in Glioblastoma, incorporating patient-specific, advanced-imaging, molecular, and cognitive/quality-of-life endpoints. Additionally, through his work in the RTOG and other clinical trial mechanisms he was instrumental in setting new standards in clinical research on Brain Metastases through a series of well- conducted multicenter, international, randomized trials, incorporating both traditional and novel endpoints, resulting in the most robust neurologic and neurocognitive dataset collection and evaluation for this condition. He developed an extensive statewide network of radiotherapy centers allied to the University, in order to robustly extend the reach of clinical research through the entire state. He also mentored the development and successful completion and re-funding of a major NIH award focusing on Cancer Disparities in Underserved Populations, and this became the benchmark for successful survey, epidemiologic, interventional, and translational research in this field. He groomed several residents and faculty who went on to major leadership and research positions, and after 10 years as Chairman. In 2007 he dedicated his efforts to further his interests in Brain and Thoracic Tumor Clinical Trials interests, as well as committing significant time to resident, national, and international education. In 2010 he resigned from his position at the University of Wisconsin, after a potential conflict of interest investigation began into his consultancy work for TomoTherapy Inc. 140px  Medical education  He completed Medical School at the University of Zambia in 1981. After completing his internship and a year of residency training, he enrolled in the Radiation Oncology Residency Program at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, which he completed in 1988. = Scientific career = His scientific career in neuro- and thoracic oncology started in 1988 and was marked by a zealous focus on evidence-based medicine through clinical and translational research, including a variety of areas such as endobronchial brachytherapy, radioimmunotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, image-guided and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, radioprotectors, radiosensitizers, altered fractionation, combination chemoradiotherapy as well as combining targeted agents with radiotherapy. = Publications = Minesh Mehta has provided leadership for over 100 clinical protocols, authored almost 100 book chapters and published more than 800 scientific papers and abstracts.

The term is new and has been applied to large social phenomena and organizations (healthcare and higher education) by advocates of higher degrees of system-like, coherent behavior for delivering value to stakeholders. In sociology, Montreal-based Romanian academic Szymon Chodak (1973) used \\"societal systemness\\" in English to describe the empirical reality that inspired Emile Durkheim.Chodak, S. Societal Developmental, New York, OUP. The healthcare-related usage of the term was as early as 1986 in a Dutch psychiatric research paper. It has recently been adapted to describe the sustainability efforts of healthcare institutions amidst budget cuts stemming from the 2008‚Äì2012 global recession. The higher educational use appears to have featured in professional discussions between sociologist Neil Smelser and University of California Chancellor and President Clark Kerr in the 1950s or 60s; in the foreword to Kerr's 2001 memoir, Smelser uses the term in inverted commas in recalling such discussions.Kerr, C. The Gold and the Blue: A Personal Memoir of the University of California, 1949-1967 Berkeley: UC Press, xxiii The term's overt operationalization, however, was instituted by The State University of New York's (SUNY) Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher in the State of the University Address on January 9, 2012. Zimpher noted systemness as \\"the coordination of multiple components that, when working together, create a network of activity that is more powerful than any action of individual parts on their own.\\"  Use in higher education  The term is widely used by the State University of New York system.  Adoption of the term by Nancy Zimpher  Chancellor Zimpher explained her initial use of the term in the January 2012 Address: > ‚ÄúThe State University of New York has so many assets, but there is not one > greater than our ‚Äòsystemness.' Beyond the individual strengths that each of > our 64 campuses possess, there is a powerful and unmatched capacity to reach > our most ambitious goals together and to realize our highest achievements. > In 2012 and beyond, SUNY will tap into that power of ‚Äòsystemness‚Äô to create > a more affordable, productive, and accessible university, while doing its > part to generate economic development, create jobs, and prepare the > workforce of tomorrow for New York State.\\" In January 2012, The Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York at Albany published an explanation of Zimpher's application of the term to the SUNY system: :\\"Acting alone, each of our 64 campuses can and has made great achievements. But think of what can be accomplished when we leverage all of our individual strengths and act as one formidable force armed with an ambitious yet disciplined set of goals that promise to create not just a stronger public university system but also a better way of life for all of New York.\\" The term was again used in an address by Zimpher at the SUNY Conference on Instruction and Technology on May 30, 2012. It highlighted the value proposition made possible through the sixty- four SUNY campuses across the state, working together to produce better results than that of all of them working apart. Zimpher likened her use of the term to Stephen Colbert's 'truthiness'. = Principles of Systemness = In August 2012, gathered leaders from across the SUNY spectrum ‚Äì crossing divisional, regional, and sector lines ‚Äì developed these guiding principles in conjunction with their coursework and exercises at the SUNY Summer Leadership Development Program. The work here was done together, and we hope this assists SUNY in its Systemness. Nelson Rockefeller's audacious vision of an educated New York led to the foundation of a 64 campus network of accessible public colleges and universities to educate the state. The time is now to extend that vision to the challenges of the modern age by drawing on the diversity of the distinct missions of the 64 campuses to collaborate, find new synergies, and to enhance and revitalize SUNY as the primary engine for New York's success. Systemness should be guided by the following five principles which, in part, owe themselves to Collins and Hanson (2011): *Vision ‚Äì The vision of SUNY is to be greater than the sum of any one of its parts. This vision embraces innovation, creativity, and growth. Systemness is a student-centered network that fosters collegiality, diversity, and economic growth for the greater New York community. *Discipline ‚Äì Discipline begins with a durable set of operating practices that leads to achieving consistently attainable and actionable goals. *Empirical creativity ‚Äì Systemness provides the opportunity to galvanize the efforts of many through evidence-based creativity for the good of the whole. *Risk-taking ‚Äì There is strength is Systemness. Calculated risk-taking by individual campuses will produce vastly superior results for the whole. This will happen in concert without the sacrifice of any campus identity. *Return on luck ‚Äì Another guiding principle of Systemness is being positioned to take advantage of our collective assets as a system and being prepared to respond to circumstances beyond our control. = Coverage by the news media = A newspaper article in the Albany Times Union (Hearst Corporation) run on January 9, 2012 calls the term \\"an overarching theme\\" of SUNY's future as outlined in Zimpher's State of the University Address. The online publication Inside Higher Ed published an opinion piece by a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on October 4, 2012 which noted the expanded usage of systemness and its application to higher education. The author states that systemness is an idea to promote \\"collaboration across campuses to coordinate program offerings and services, striving for common goals, and working together to count student successes as mutually beneficial.\\"  State University of New York system early use  On February 1, 2012, the term was used by Zimpher as she spoke before New York State Senate and Assembly Committees about the 2012-13 Executive Budget Proposal to describe SUNY's systemness to \\"make the biggest possible impact for all New Yorkers.\\" SUNY has titled its annual Critical Issues in Higher Education Conference \\"Harnessing Systemness  Delivering Performance\\" slated for November 2012. In Precipice or Crossroads?,Fogel, Daniel Mark, and Elizabeth Malson-Huddle. Precipice or Crossroads?: Where America's Great Public Universities Stand and Where They Are Going Midway through Their Second Century. Albany: State University of New York, Albany, 2012. Print. the term is highlighted in a section titled \\"Cultivating systemness to take the land- grant mission to scale\\" where the term is used in its context to describe the modernization of the principle of land grant schools: :Between and among the land grants, there is no universal or agreed-upon curriculum, no transfer pipeline or assurances of articulation, no umbrella for administrative oversight or shared administrative functions. These schools were not originally designed to function thus; they were designed as individual and separate institutions to serve local needs and to bolster local agrarian and industrial economies.  Use in healthcare  The term has been used ambiguously throughout healthcare until the 2008‚Äì2012 global recession. At that period, professionals began to use systemness to describe their combination of IT assets and services to provide efficient healthcare. The term was the centerpoint on August 20, 2007 at The Kaiser Permanente Institute for Health Policy's roundtable on ‚ÄúImproving Health Care ‚ÄòSystemness‚Äô: A Look at the Evidence and Policy Implications.\\" The conference applied the term to describe how the Kaiser Permanente consortium can consolidate medical resources to achieve higher-quality output for all parties involved. The Kaiser Permanente Institute names seven characteristics of systemness in healthcare: Governance, strong physician leadership, organizational culture, clear & shared aims, accountability & transparency, patient-centeredness and teams. Similarly, the Governance Institute of California in 2005 explored systemness in healthcare in 'Pursuing Systemness: The Evolution of Large Health Systems': :\\"...Leaders generally use the term to define looking and acting more like a single integrated organization rather than a collection of independently functioning pieces. Systemness means being more tightly- knit, shifting decision-making responsibility and authority away from the subsidiary operating units to the corporate level, and centralizing or standardizing key management systems and processes. Systemness is consistent with the corporate enterprise model of governance.\\" References Computer networking Words coined in the 1980s State University of New York ","title":"Systemness"},{"id":"35983431","text":"Acraea peetersi is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

William Noyes of Cholderton, Wiltshire, and his wife Anne,Sources differ as to whether she was the sister of Robert Parker, or the sister of his wife Dorothy Stevens. and was born at Cholderton in 1608. He was the cousin, on his mother's side, of Thomas Parker (1595-1677), who had been left to the education of William Noyes when his father Robert Parker fled into exile in the Netherlands in 1607.Cotton Mather, Magnalia Christi Americana: or, The Ecclesiastical History of New-England (Thomas Parkhurst, at the Bible and Crowns in Cheapside, London 1702), Book III: Polybius: Lives of Many Reverend, Learned and Holy Divines, Chap. XXV: 'Scholasticus. The Life of Mr Thomas Parker' pp. 143-45, and 'Appendix, containing Memoirs of Mr. James Noyes', pp. 145-48 (Internet Archive). Educated under the guidance of his father, and receiving much instruction from Parker, he entered Brasenose College, Oxford in 1627, but did not proceed to a degree.J.A. Noyes, 'Noyes Inscriptions and Memoranda', New England Historical and Genealogical Register XLVIII (1894), pp. 18-19 (Google). After studying in Dublin, Oxford and Leyden, Parker returned to teach at Newbury in Berkshire, where he was assistant preacher to William Twisse: Parker summoned James to assist him, and under their guidance James found his vocation.Mather, 'Memoirs of Mr. James Noyes' (Narrative of Nicholas Noyes). In 1633 James married Sarah, eldest daughter of Joseph Brown of Southampton and his wife Sarah Hibbert,Noyes, 'Noyes Inscriptions and Memoranda'. and on March 1634 Parker and Noyes, together with his brother Nicholas Noyes and nephew John Woodbridge,The mother of John Woodbridge was the sister of Mrs Sarah Noyes. J.L. Sibley, Biographical Sketches of Graduates of Harvard University (Charles William Seever, Cambridge 1873), I: 1642-1658, p. 21, note (Google). and their families, emigrated to New England. They sailed aboard the Mary and John of London, accompanied by the Hercules: the ship was detained in the River Thames where all passengers signed the Oath of Allegiance to the King and the Church before they were allowed to sail from London.J.J. Currier, History of Newbury, Mass., 1635-1902 (Damrell and Upham, Boston 1902), pp. 26-28 (Internet Archive). During the voyage Parker and Noyes preached or expounded every day, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon, and were \\"abundant in prayer\\".Mather, 'Memoirs of Mr. James Noyes' (Narrative of Nicholas Noyes). Arriving in May 1634, they made landfall at Nantaskut in Massachusetts Bay Colony. Thomas Parker went with around 100 others to the new plantation at Agawam (Ipswich, Massachusetts) where as Teacher he assisted Nathaniel Ward as Pastor.'Letter of James Cudworth of Scituate, 1634', (to Dr. Stoughton), in New England Historical and Genealogical Register 14 (1860), pp. 101-04. James Noyes served at first in Medford, the settlement on the north side of the Mystic River laid out for Matthew Cradock. Parker and his company remained at Agawam through the winter, and in the following spring sought permission from the General Court to settle on the Quascacunquen River (now called the Parker River). This was granted in May 1635, only weeks before the revocation of the (Plymouth Council) Great Charter of New England,'The Act of Surrender of the Great Charter of New England to His Majesty: 1635' Avalon Project, Yale Law School.H.M. Dexter, As To Roger Williams, and his \\"Banishment\\" from the Massachusetts Plantation (Congregational Publishing Society, Boston 1876), pp. 21-25 (Internet Archive). and the settlement of Newbury, Massachusetts proceeded.Currier, History of Newbury, Mass., pp. 28-36 (Internet Archive). A church (the tenth in the Colony) being gathered, Thomas Parker became their Pastor, and James Noyes, though also invited to a ministry at Watertown, preferred to join his dear friend at Newbury as Teacher.Mather, 'Memoirs of Mr. James Noyes' (Narrative of Nicholas Noyes). Both remained there for the rest of their lives. Noyes and Parker prepared students for Harvard, refusing all compensation for their services: twelve or fourteen pupils at a time were taught at the James Noyes House, where both men lived. The house at Newbury, Mass. where Thomas Parker and James Noyes dwelt The following portrait of Noyes by Thomas Parker deserves quotation in full: > \\"He was a man of singular qualifications: in piety excelling, an implacable > enemy to all heresy and schism, and a most able warrior against the same. He > was of a reaching and ready apprehension, a large invention, a most profound > judgement, a rare, tenacious, and comprehensive memory, fixed and unmoveable > in his grounded conceptions, sure in words and speech, without rashness, > gentle and mild in expression, without all passion or provocative language; > and as he was a notable disputant, so he never would provoke his adversary, > saving by the short knocks and heavy weight of argument. He was of so loving > and compassionate and humble carriage, that I believe never any were > acquainted with him, but did desire the continuance of his society and > acquaintance. He was resolute for the truth, and in defence thereof, had no > respect for any persons. He was a most excellent counsellor in doubts, and > could strike at a hair's breadth, like the Benjaminites, and expedite the > entangled out of briars. He was courageous in dangers, and still was apt to > believe the best, and made fair weather in a storm. He was much honoured and > esteemed in the country, and his death was much bewailed. I think he may be > reckoned amongst the greatest worthies of his age.\\"T. Parker, 'Epistle > Dedicatory' in J. Noyes, Moses and Aaron (1661), quoted by J.B. Felt, The > Ecclesiastical History of New England, 2 vols (Congregational Library > Association, Boston 1862) II, pp. 150-51 (Hathi Trust).

James Noyes II of Stonington, Connecticut, was one of the first trustees of Yale College, a group of ten Congregationalist ministers, now known as \\"The Founders\\". Their engraved names line the facade of Woodbridge Hall at Yale University. The building is named for Timothy Woodbridge, cousin to Rev. James Noyes II and one of the other ten founding ministers of the college. Woodbridge Hall The Noyes Family continues a long tradition at Yale with notable persons having contributed to the University. Rev. James Noyes II was the first Senior Fellow (Chair) of the Board of Trustees, and his younger brother Rev. Moses Noyes also served as a member of the Trustees. Dr. John Noyes graduated Yale 1775. Rev. Daniel Parker Noyes graduated Yale 1840, as did his two sons Edward Parish Noyes, 1880, and Frederic A. Noyes, 1862. Theodore R. Noyes receive a Yale medical degree 1867. Haskell Noyes graduated Yale 1908. Herbert MacArthur Noyes graduated Yale 1914. Newbold Noyes, Jr. graduated Yale 1941. Herbert MacArthur Noyes Jr. graduated Yale 1949. Thomas E. Noyes graduated Yale 1953. Professor Edward Simpson Noyes, PhD (1892-1967) graduated Yale 1913, was a professor of English at Yale for 40 years, and served as chairman of the Board of Admissions for 18 years, director of the Master of Arts in Teaching program, and received the Yale Medal of Honor in 1968. His son, Dr. Edward ‚ÄúTed‚Äù MacArthur Noyes II (1919-1999), graduated Yale 1940 and was also presented with the Yale Medal of Honor for his lifetime service to Yale in 1996, and served as president of the Yale Club of New Haven. His son, Dr. Edward MacArthur Noyes III and daughter Nancy Noyes Foss were the first brother and sister to graduate together from Yale in 1971. Family His son James Noyes II (born 11 March 1640, Newbury ‚Äì 30 December 1719, Stonington, Connecticut) was also a clergyman and founded Yale College. He graduated from Harvard in 1659, began to preach in 1664, and was pastor of the church in Stonington, Connecticut from 1674 until his death. A councilor in civil affairs in the critical periods of his colony, James Noyes II also practiced medicine with success. Early Noyes descendants often were ministers and teachers, and sometimes distinguished ‚Äì for example, the Salem Witch Trials (James's nephew Nicholas Noyes) and the founding of Yale College. On 14 November 1692, during the Salem Witch Trials, 17-year-old Mary Herrick accused Noyes' daughter, Sarah Noyes Hale (wife of John Hale), and the ghost of executed Mary Eastey of afflicting her, but she was never formally charged with witchcraft or arrested.No. 709: Statement of John Hale & Joseph Gerrish v. Mary Herrick, Records of the Salem Witch-Hunt, p. 703, Bernard Rosenthal, Ed. (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2009). A later commentator on the trials, Charles Upham suggests that this accusation was one that helped turn public opinion to end the prosecutions, and spurred John Hale's willingness to reconsider his support of the trials.Charles W. Upham, Salem Witchcraft, 1969 (1867), Vol. II, pp. 345‚Äì46. Rev James Noyes I is also the ancestor of John Humphrey Noyes, leader of the Perfectionist movement and founder of the Oneida Community. The daughter of Rev. James Noyes I, Sarah Noyes, is the great- grandmother of American hero Nathan Hale.

He is the founder, Chief Economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, an economic research firm located in Valhalla, NY. Weinberg was born in the Bronx and raised in Teaneck, NJ. He earned his bachelor's degree from Rutgers University. He received a doctorate in economics from the University of Pennsylvania, as a student of Nobel laureate Lawrence Klein. At the University of Pennsylvania, Weinberg also worked under prominent economists F. Gerald Adams, Robert Summers, Oliver E. Williamson and Albert Ando. Weinberg is one of the original participants in Project Link, an econometric modeling group sponsored by the U.N. He is still a contributor to the group, participating in panel discussions at Project Link conferences in New York and Beijing. Weinberg has also worked on econometric modeling projects at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates and at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Throughout his career, Weinberg has been based in Toronto, London, Paris, New York and Italy, and he has spent extended time as an advisor in Africa and Latin America. As an IBM Fellow, Weinberg spent several years in Italy in the 1970s, developing macroeconomic modeling innovations at the IBM Scientific Center, located in Pisa. Starting in 1982, while based in Toronto as an economist at the Bank of Montreal, Weinberg served on several bank advisory committees aimed at negotiating multi-year restructuring deals to keep Latin American sovereign borrowers from defaulting on their loans. He worked directly with finance ministers, central bank governors and other officials of several Latin American governments to develop sustainable restructuring programs. These experiences provided Weinberg with unique insights into the European sovereign-debt crisis. In the spring of 2010, he recommended multi-year restructuring of Greece's sovereign debt obligations, anticipating the eventual outcome two years in advance. In the late 1980s, Weinberg was based in New York, at Shearson Lehman Brothers, as the firm's Senior International Economist. During his time at Lehman, he served as an advisor for projects in Africa and Latin America, including a long-term project with the government of Cameroon. At High Frequency Economics, Weinberg serves as Managing Director and Chief Economist. Under his leadership, High Frequency Economics grew from a two-man firm distributing daily macroeconomic research by messenger service to a global company with 350 client institutions in 25 countries. In addition to his experience in practical economics, Weinberg has maintained connections throughout his career to the academic world. While living in Italy, he lectured in economics at the European University Institute in Florence. In France, he taught at the American College in Paris. He has also taught economics courses at the Wharton School. Weinberg is currently a professor in the graduate program in economics at New York University. He teaches a popular course in international finance. In the spring of 2012, he initiated the Eurocrisis Discussion Group in NYU's department of economics, a group of economists that meets regularly to analyze developments in the European sovereign-debt crisis.

It was based on a gospel song Guthrie heard on his visits to the migrant camps known variously as \\"Can't Feel at Home\\" or \\"I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore,\\" which had been made popular by the Carter Family in 1931. Guthrie wrote his version of the song in response to this version, in an attempt to capture more effectively the \\"unrelieved anger\\" of the Dust Bowl refugees. He was outraged by the song's message and the effects it had on the migrants, telling them to wait, and be meek. It was telling them to accept the hovels and the hunger and the disease and to not fight back.http://www.woodyguthrie.de/iaint.html Guthrie‚Äôs version parodies the original song‚Äôs fundamentalist religious sentiment that the poor should accept suffering in this world for rewards in the hereafter. https://www.univie.ac.at/Anglistik/easyrider/data/Aint.htm An unreleased variant of the song protests the segregation at the Beach Haven apartment complex owned by Fred Trump, the father of future president Donald Trump, which he stayed at from 1950 to 1952: \\"Beach Haven looks like heaven / Where no black ones come to roam! / No, no, no!

An E-book edition of the story was issued by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.Amazon.com entry for e-book edition The story has also appeared in the anthologies Cosmic Knights (Signet/NEL, 1985), The Mammoth Book of Classic Science Fiction: Short Novels of the 1930s (Robinson, 1988), Divide and Rule/The Sword of Rhiannon (Tor, 1990), and Great Tales of Classic Science Fiction (Galahad Books, 1990).  Plot summary  A future earth has been conquered by the extraterrestrial \\"Hoppers,\\" aliens resembling kangaroos. To secure their dominance, the Hoppers have reserved all advanced technology for their own use and resurrected the feudal society of the European Middle Ages, which they have imposed on the earthlings to prevent them from uniting against their conquerors. The story follows one such feudal lord, Sir Howard Van Slyck, a younger son of the Duke of Poughkeepsie, whose knight-errant quest leads him by degrees to question and challenge Hopper rule. After his brother Frank is executed for engaging in scientific research he joins the Wyoming knight Lyman Haas in the anti-Hopper underground, in which he becomes privy to a conspiracy to topple the alien rulers. Reception John K. Aiken, writing in Fantasy Review, rates de Camp \\"very nearly at his best\\" in this story, and his best as \\"very good indeed.\\" He considers it \\"[a]ltogether, as sprightly and enjoyable a [tale] as one might meet in a couple of years' reading.\\" He appreciates the basis of de Camp's science fiction \\"in the behaviour of real people living in unfamiliar social set-ups, logically developed from to-day's trends or from a given premise.\\" He does feel \\"that Mr. de Camp's sense of humour [can] sometimes run away with him,\\" as in \\"the extremely improbable details of the feudal regime set up by the Hoppers ... but improbability is here outweighed by entertainment value and by a certain wild consistency which is supported by the reality of the characters.\\" His primary criticism is of a \\"scientific flaw\\" he perceives in the gimmick that provides the resolution.Aiken, John K. \\"The Humour of de Camp,\\" in Fantasy Review, v. 3, no. 14, April/May 1949, p. 23. Astounding reviewer P. Schuyler Miller praised the book for \\"provid[ing] more sheer entertainment than any the fantasy publishers have yet given us,\\" noting that de Camp uses his \\"detailed knowledge of history\\" to depict \\"hypothetical future societies which ape those of the past--with differences.\\"Miller, P. Schuyler. \\"Book Reviews,\\" in Astounding Science Fiction, v. 44, no. 1, September 1949, pp. 150-151. Sam Moskowitz saw the influence of Mark Twain in the story.

Text: \\" the ejaculation of semen results in only a one-day impurity that requires laundering and ablutions (15:16-18), regardless of whether the act takes place during (legitimate) intercourse or by the self, deliberately (masturbation) or accidentally (nocturnal emission).\\" The traditional rabbinical interpretation of Leviticus 15 was that it applies to all sperm flows, including sperm flows due to masturbation. Other than this ritual impurity, no consequences or punishments are specified. The Biblical story of Onan () was interpreted by many later commentators as a source for prohibiting ejaculation outside a woman's body, including masturbation. In the story, Onan did not want to impregnate his wife (because, this being a levirate marriage, the resulting child would be considered to belong to Onan's brother Er rather than Onan), so when they had sex Onan performed coitus interruptus and caused his semen to spill on the ground. The story relates that God found Onan's behavior evil, and punished Onan with death. Nevertheless, opinions differ on whether his sin was denying a child to Er (which would have no implications for masturbation), or ejaculating outside the context of sex (implying that masturbation too is a sin). The halakhic prohibition on masturbation Traditional rabbinic sources strictly prohibit male masturbation, and even activities which can lead to sexual arousal and thus ejaculation. The Mishnah states that if a man touches his penis with his hand (in order to check for ritually impure emission), his hand \\"ought to be cut off\\".Babylonian Talmud, Niddah 13a The Babylonian Talmud prohibits \\"emitting seed in vain\\", a term generally (but not only) referring to masturbation: The same passage likens the act to murder and idolatry, and also prohibits a man from intentionally arousing himself: The Shulchan AruchShulchan Aruch, Even Ha'Ezer 23:1 and Kitzur Shulchan AruchKitzur Shulchan Aruch 151:1) state that wasting sperm is considered to be a sin greater than any sin in the Torah. However, the Beit Shmuel commentary states that this is not literal, but rather serves to frighten man into avoiding the sin. The Arizal taught that one is obligated to fast eighty-four times to repent for the discharging of semen in vain. The Tanya contends that, in current times, one can give to charity in place of fasting. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov claimed that masturbation leads to depression, and that the effects of impure ejaculation can only be nullified through the recitation of the Tikkun Haklali. According to Sefer haChinuch, one of the reasons for the prohibition on male homosexual sex is that sperm is destroyed for no constructive purpose.Sefer haHinuch, commandment 209 (parshat Acharei Mot) Female masturbation Female masturbation is not explicitly prohibited, but authorities such as Rabbi Moshe Feinstein consider female masturbation as necessarily involving forbidden \\"impure thoughts\\".Issues in Jewish Ethics: ‚ÄúKosher‚Äù SexIgros Moshe, Even Ha'ezer 1, sec. 69. However, Hida◊©◊†◊™ ◊™◊©◊¢\\"◊ñ  ◊©◊ë◊™ ◊§◊®◊©◊™ ◊ï◊ô◊©◊ë and Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank◊ê◊ï◊†◊†◊ï◊™ ◊†◊©◊ô◊™ ‚Äì ◊û◊ë◊ò ◊î◊ú◊õ◊™◊ô ◊ï◊¢◊®◊õ◊ô disagreed. Ben Ish Chai states that it is wrong because it creates evil forces (Kelipos).Od Yosef Chai p. 37, quoting the Arizal in Shaar HaKavanos, Inyan Drushei Layla, sec. 7 In any case, female masturbation does not carry the severity of male masturbation, because it does not involve the release of seed. Situations in which halakha may permit \\"wasting\\" sperm There is disagreement among the poskim (decisors of Jewish law) whether masturbation is an acceptable way of procuring semen for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation.The Use of Cryopreserved Sperm and Pre-embryos In Contemporary Jewish Law and Ethics Some poskim rule that it is possible to masturbate to avoid arayot (forbidden relationships).Rabbi Chaim Rappoport, Judaism and Homosexuality: An Authentic Orthodox View, pp. 141-42. Sefer Hasidim states that if a man's sexual desire is so great that he is afraid of committing a worse sin, then he is allowed to masturbate in order to avoid a worse sin, but must then perform penance by fasting or sitting in ice water.Sefer Hasidim, no. 50 (p. 44, Parma ed.)  Married couples  Even if a wife is unable to become pregnant (e.g. infertile, old, or currently pregnant or nursing), sexual relations between a married couple are not only permitted, but required within the framework of the commandment of onah.Mishnah Brurah, 240:10◊û◊¶◊ï◊ï◊™ ◊¢◊ï◊†◊î ‚Äì ◊ó◊ï◊ë◊™ ◊î◊ë◊¢◊ú ◊õ◊ú◊§◊ô ◊ê◊©◊™◊ï This is despite the fact that the sperm will be \\"wasted\\" in the sense of not causing pregnancy. Rabbinic authorities have in certain instances permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation in tandem with a man's wife. Rabbi Meir recommended a man perform coitus interruptus (◊ì◊© ◊û◊ë◊§◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊ñ◊ï◊®◊î ◊û◊ë◊ó◊ï◊•) with his wife while she is pregnant or nursing, for health reasons.Tosefta Niddah 2:4 For similar reasons, Rabbi Eliezer recommended coitus interruptus for a duration of 24 months after birth.Yebamot 34b Tosafot cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak (Isaac ben Samuel) who permitted an occasional exterior ejaculation with one's wife on the condition that one does not accustom himself to always doing so, as this is not considered comparable to Onan, who wished to avoid impregnating Tamar entirely.Tosafot Yebamot 34b, Tosafot Sanhedrin 58b This opinion is accepted as normative by Rabbeinu Asher,Tosafot haRosh, Yebamot 34b Arba'ah Turim,Tur, Even Ha'ezer 25 Sefer HaAguddah,Agudah, p. 115 col. 2 Maharsha,Maharsha to Talmud Nedarim 20a Bayit Chadash,Bayit Hadash, on Tur 25:3 Eliyah Rabbah,\\"Eliyah rabbah\\" to Orach Chayim, 240:10-11 and some other authorities.◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊î◊ú◊õ◊î ◊õ◊ô◊ï◊ó◊†◊ü ◊ë◊ü ◊ì◊î◊ë◊ê◊ô A more explicit permissive stance is that of the tosafist rabbi Isaiah di Trani the Elder: Rabbi Isaiah the Elder's view is likewise echoed by his descendant, rabbi Isaiah di Trani the Younger.\\"Ria\\"z\\", jerusalem 1994 Rabbi Eleazar of Worms permits any activity with one's wife necessary to \\"quiet (lit. seat)\\" his desire.Rokeach to the Torah (J. Kluggman, Bnei Brak), p. 83 (commentary to )  Non-Orthodox movements  Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis have decided on more liberal conclusions. Reconstructionist Rabbi Alexis Roberts maintains that masturbation is \\"harmless, natural and healthy. It may provide release and pleasure, as well as self-knowledge that is useful for pleasurable sex with a partner. It may make it easier for young people to have sexual release in the years when they are too young for a mature, committed, loving relationship.\\"\\"Masturbation: Is It Kosher?\\". Beliefnet. Reform Rabbi Jonathan Stein, in a proposed schema for normative Reform evaluation of different sexual activities, proposed that masturbation be considered \\"mutar\\", a term generally translated as \\"permissible\\", but which he renders as \\"tolerable\\". Rabbi Walter Jacob, writing on behalf of the Reform responsa committee, asserts, \\"Although the statements of tradition are very clear, we would take a different view of masturbation, in the light of current psychological thought.

From 1923 to 1926, she studied art and fashion illustration at the prestigious Schule Reimann for artists and designers. She initially worked mainly as a fashion illustrator and also designed costumes for Marlene Dietrich and Diseuse Margo Lion in Mischa Spoliansky's Revue Es liegt in der Luft (text by Marcellus Schiffer), which premiered in 1928. From early on, she used to sign her works as DODO or DoDo. Dodo reached the peak of her artistic career between 1927 and 1930 with caustic genre scenes of Weimar Republic's glamorous high society. More than 60 of her intensely colourful gouaches, narrating the sophisticated life of the modern urbanite and the increasing estrangement of the sexes, were published in the German satirical magazine ULK. In 1929, Dodo married the Jewish lawyer and notary Dr. Hans B√ºrgner (1882‚Äì1974); the couple had two children, Anja and Thomas Ulrich. 1933 she met Carl Gustav Jung-disciple Dr. Gerhard Adler (1904‚Äì1988) with whom she fell in love. She followed him to Z√ºrich, where she was analyzed by Toni Wolff (1888‚Äì1953), Jung's close companion, at the Psychiatrische Universit√§tsklinik Z√ºrich, also named Burgh√∂lzli Klinik. Dodo expressed her dreams in her works, a sequence of watercolors which she characterized as \\"unconscious paintings\\". As of 1934, Dodo could only work for Jewish publications, such as the J√ºdische Rundschau, who frequently published her Bible illustrations, theatre scenes or drawings for children. in 1936, Dodo emigrated to London, where she married Gerhard Adler after having been divorced from B√ºrgner. Her divorce from Adler followed in 1938Adler married Hildegard (\\"Hella\\") Fanta, born From(m)hold in the same year, both were among the founders of the Society of Analytical Psychology in 1945/1946. and Dodo and Hans B√ºrgner remarried in 1945. In her exile, Dodo illustrated children's books, designed greeting cards for Raphael Tuck & Sons and worked for Paris House London. Post war, she drew still lives, landscapes and nude studies. In addition, she completed a range of tapestries according to her own design. Dodo's work had almost faded into obscurity; its art historic significance was discovered in the autumn of 2009 by Dr. Renate Kr√ºmmer, art collector and art dealer.KR√úMMER fine art In co-operation with Dodo's estate and Kr√ºmmer, Dr. Adelheid Rasche from the National Museums of Berlin, curated the first monographic exhibition Dodo (1907-1998) - A Life in Pictures.

Mace is predominantly known for his drawings in ballpoint pen, using them to create fine artwork. He is considered a pioneer of the medium. His imagination has also served commercial purposes, appearing in print as illustrations and comic art. Art reviewers have referred to Mace as the da Vinci of doodlers and the ballpoint Picasso. Lennie Mace has resided in Japan since 1994. A hair salon in central Tokyo, belonging to a Japanese patron, doubles as the Lennie Mace VIEWseum, displaying a collection of original artwork housed within an interior hand-crafted by the artist. He remains active in art communities of both America and Japan. Background As a teenager, Mace was the Gold Key winner of a Scholastic Art Achievement Award. He passed the entry exam for New York's High School of Art and Design but did not attend. He briefly attended New York's School of Visual Arts in the early 1980s. Art career=1987-1992: Illustration & early exhibitions Lennie Mace's first professional art-related work began appearing in New York City during the mid-1980s, from which time he gained recognition as an illustrator. From the start of his career, his illustrations and artwork have been rendered solely using ballpoint pens, whether as simple black line drawings or as shaded halftones using a range of available ballpoint pen colors. Imagery depicted in his artwork touches upon aspects of so-called high-brow and low-brow aesthetics, even during the late 1980s when there was a greater divide between both art worlds. His artwork would go on to decorate the pages of a diverse range of publications, from High Times magazine to The New York Times newspaper. Lennie Mace ¬• ‚Ç¨ $ (2014) dry ballpoint pen and ballpoint pen ink on paper. \\"Invisible Ink\\" series. Mace was among a circle of emerging artists of the late 1980s whose talents were encouraged by New York-based entities providing work and exposure. His earliest illustration credits appear in High Times magazine in 1987. Notable contributions to the magazine include two cover illustrations; the first published in the November 1988 issue, and another published in 1992. Both dealt with the subject of growing marijuana in outer space. The choice of Mace's artwork for use on the cover of the magazine was a point of contention among the editorial staff at the time ‚Äî a democratic process outlined in a 1992 High Times Greatest Hits anthology ‚Äî and incited hate-mail from the magazine's readership. Mace's Pot on the Moon illustration was chosen over High Times' characteristic marijuana photography, a nude photograph of Allen Ginsberg and other designs. Mace was also among artists supporting the listener-sponsored, free-form radio station WFMU by providing artwork for the station's promotion, publications and fund-raising drives. During the same period, Mace became a prominent contributor to New York Press, a free alternative weekly, during the newspaper's peak years. He continued his involvement at New York Press even while he'd already based himself in Japan in the mid 1990s. Later work for the publication often covered Asian topics, or displayed Asian influence.Comic of the Week; New York Press, week of Dec.28,‚Äô94-Jan.3,‚Äô95, p.35 Artwork and graphics of a sexual nature contributed to Screw magazine in New York City and Hustler magazine nationally in the early 1990s gave Mace a reputation as an erotic artist which was furthered via inclusion in erotic art anthologies such as Ars Erotica: The Best Modern Erotic Art. Years of work as an illustrator continued into other commercial outlets, including cartoon work. A fan of comic books in his youth, he'd even created his own. Later, cartooning courses were among those Mace chose in lieu of a major while attending School of Visual Arts in the mid-1980s. His artwork was among those published in comic books showcasing the students of courses taught by Harvey Kurtzman (Mad; Playboy's Little Annie Fanny) and Will Eisner (The Spirit), respectively. In the mid-1990s Mace was among regular contributors to Paradox Press‚Äô award-winning Big Book series. He supplied artwork for many of the Big Books, but earned special recognition for his input to the Conspiracies book as well as the Urban Legends book. Mad magazine also employed Mace as a cartoonist. Mace had participated in group exhibitions in the 1980s, but his first solo exhibition came at the start of the 1990s. His earliest exhibitions were held annually at the I AM THE BEST ARTIST gallery of Ren√© Moncada in New York's SoHo neighborhood, at the time the city's predominant art district. In those early exhibitions many originals of his published illustrations were displayed alongside new artworks of his own. Exhibitions were publicized by publications in which the illustrations appeared, adding to the attraction of fans who‚Äôd appreciated the artwork in print. As his own original artwork flourished, illustrations were exhibited less. Lennie Mace, Mona a'la Mace (1993) ballpoint pen on paper From the start, Mace chose clever exhibition titles such as Penmanship (1991) and INKorporated (1993); conspicuous wordplay relating to his preferred medium of ballpoint pen. Exhibition titles such as Play Pen (Tokyo, 2011) and Pen Pal (USA, 2012) continue the tradition. Noted art writer Carlo McCormick dubbed Mace the da Vinci of doodlers in a preview of an early exhibition. 1993-1999: Japan, deportation, 365DAZE project In 1993, Lennie Mace attracted the interest of Pilot pen company president Ron Shaw, who then commissioned him to draw a replica of Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs Mona Lisa using only Pilot ballpoint pens. New York's Daily News reported the \\"high five-figure\\" price tag. Mona a‚Äôla Mace was subsequently the highlight of Mace's Macedonia exhibition in November 1993, and Mace was the subject of a feature interview by Morry Alter on CBS Evening News that month. Mr. Alter gave special notice to the term PENtings,CBS Evening News \\"Macedonia\\" exhibition preview (F.D.R. gallery, NYC), Lennie Mace interview segment producer Morry Alter, November 10, 1993 coined by the artist in reference to the sometime painterly quality of his more ambitious artwork in ballpoint pen, i.e. Mona a‚Äôla Mace. Video showing Mace drawing was also broadcast; a drawing of a dog later titled CBS Dog displayed at his INKorporated exhibition. The reporter also made an on-air point of joking about Mace's predilection for wearing shoes of mismatched color. Mona a‚Äôla Mace was displayed in the lobby of Pilots‚Äô offices for a time, and may have been used for corporate publicity, but the artwork's current location and usage are unconfirmed. Lennie Mace is still known to wear mis-colored footwear. A corporate commission in 1993 began Mace's connection with Japan. He was hired to draw the five-story pagoda of T≈ç-ji temple in Kyoto photorealistically in ballpoint pen. The trip to Japan to draw it on- site was considered partial payment. During his earliest time in Japan, he gained notoriety in Tokyo nightclubs applying ballpoint drawings onto customers‚Äô clothing and flesh for free drinks (pictured), which led to legitimate work, including temporary tattoos for music videos, film clients, and fashion events. Illustration work for expat publications helped introduce Mace to the international community in Tokyo. Portraiture soon became a standard element of the artist's output in Japan, rendering people and pets in ballpoint pen by commission. Exhibitions in Japan include regular showings at Isetan Department Store. Most have occurred in the flagship Shinjuku store in Tokyo, but have also been held at other branches around Japan. The artist continues to maintain a presence in Tokyo via exhibitions and collaborations. Juxtapoz art magazine reported Mace's sudden 1997 deportation from Japan, although specific reasons were not provided. Unexpectedly back in America the artist set out on the road, which became the basis for his 365DAZE project of 1998. For this project the artist spent the full year of 1998 driving around the United States, over 30,000 miles (48,280 km) by his own account, doing a drawing-per-day, embellishing whatever found-media he came across in whatever part of the country through which he happened to be traveling. The profusion of Mace's Media Graffiti during prior years peaked with his 365DAZE project. Exhibitions in 1996 titled \\"Media Graffiti\\" in both New York and Tokyo had been composed entirely of artwork from the series, but the series had its origins within the emergence of graffiti culture of the 1980s in New York City, of which Mace was a participant. The series‚Äô title refers to the artist's practice of embellishing existing printed matter with his ballpoint doodles, sometimes in the form of ironic commentary to what is already implied within the advertisement. He considers the series his artistic ‚Äúshorthand\\", able to render quickly under any circumstances. Mace began officially publicizing these works as Media Graffiti as output grew to dominate his exhibitions throughout the 1990s. He also refers to the series as Ad Libs, an acronym of \\"ADvertisement LIBeration\\" adapted by Mace as a pun of \\"ad lib,\\" to which he has compared his creative process ‚Äî improvisational, stream of conscious creation ‚Äî a process with unpredictable results in which the art effectively \\"draws itself,\\" from an instinctive visual library.

Mace spent 1999 touring with selections of completed 365DAZE artwork, beginning with New York City in January. San Francisco followed, in April, and Los Angeles thereafter. Media Graffiti from Lennie Mace's 365DAZE project has also been exhibited in other cities as part of group exhibitions in Chicago, Detroit, Tampa and Miami. As recognition of his Media Graffiti broadened, corporate interests began offering finer printings of their own products for Mace to embellish, to then be used for promotional purposes. 2000-2010: Return to Japan, Lennie Mace VIEWseum Mace was able to return to Japan, and soon became the de facto house-artist for the Febbraio Di Ales cosmetics company, whose president is a principal patron in Japan. Work for Ales included most of that which Mace had become recognized ‚Äî illustration, logo and font design, decorative fine art, et‚Äôal ‚Äî and added architectural and interior design to his credits. Many of Mace's most substantial projects in Japan were commissioned by Ales, involving full interior designs and occasionally exterior architectural design as well. The first began as simple interior modifications to the company's Ales International salon in Harajuku, to accommodate Mace artwork bought by the owner. Customer satisfaction and enthusiasm led to the expansion of the commission to include the full interior, to provide more display space ‚Äî work which would go on for nearly two years between 2000 and 2002, even as the salon remained open for business. The salon's entry walls received special attention; a ballpoint pen mural and mixed-media installation which was widely reported by both hair-make publications and general media outlets. A number of Mace's \\"365Daze\\" Media Graffiti are on permanent display at the VIEWseum. The official re-christening of the salon as the Lennie Mace VIEWseum occurred on February 2, 2002. Promotional materials describe it as an ongoing, full- interior, mixed-media, enviro-installation, with a collection of the artist's ballpoint pen originals sharing the space with site specific installations incorporating imaginative arrangements of his patron's other otaku collections. Three mannequin-like creations with elaborately fabricated hairstyles, all commissioned by Ales, were entered into a national design competition in 2004. One of them, a cyber-punk rendition very different from Mace's 2D artwork, went on to win the Grand Prize. Another mammoth Ales commission was a full interior mural done in paint for the company's Sugar salon ‚Äî a rare occasion of Mace creating figurative imagery using a medium other than ballpoint pen, at a scale he'd never before attempted. These commissions included signage, promotional artwork, and anything else per Mace's whim which would serve the client's fancy. These sometimes included the design of furnishings such as chairs and tables, and often the actual hand- manufacturing of details such as clocks, to match the overall designs.

Mace's denim \\"scrolls\\" have been appearing in greater quantities since the beginning of the 2010s. The ballpoint-on-denim creations, a contemporary interpretation of traditional Japanese sumi ink on washi paper scrolls, are fabricated from the artist's own used jeans. Woven tapestries from Japan bearing Lennie Mace's imagery started making appearances in American galleries in 2012. Mace has been creating single-panel cartoons under the title Japanglish101 since 2013 as a contributor to the japanglish.org website. The cartoons offer \\"twisted takes on Japanese culture\\". Portrait commissions continue to be a substantial component of Mace's output. His Media Graffiti series also continues, with magazine page doodles evolving over time to now include larger printed media such as Japanese subway posters. Mace annually produces New Year Card designs which adhere to the cycle of animals celebrated in the Chinese calendar. Mace used his Invisible Ink exhibition (2015, Tokyo) to formally introduce his \\"dry pen\\" technique. He had been employing the technique in some manner for some time, using \\"empty\\" ballpoint pens to draw invisible patterns, images and text into paper. No colors are added to some of these artworks; the imagery can only be seen when lit from an angle. To others, as in ¬• ‚Ç¨ $ (pictured), Mace applies ballpoint ink using his fingertips, exposing content previously drawn with a dry pen. Media in Japan and America in late-2015 began reporting about Mace building a \\"castle\\" in the Japanese Alps. Style Lennie Mace has been noted for his attention to detail; \\"intricately rendered\\" drawings showing \\"precision linework.\\" He explains his ballpoint technique as \\"layers of overlapping lines\\" dependent of \\"pressure on the pen and texture of the paper,\\" working with several colors simultaneously to achieve desired effects. Mace has described his own work as \\"non-political\\" and \\"self-indulgent,\\" but content of a surreal nature ‚Äî animal legs substituted by elaborately \\"carved\\" piano legs, for example ‚Äî has led some reviewers to read symbolism into his work. Size varies greatly, from elaborate large-scale to simpler, smaller works. Mace has often incorporated materials reflecting the same \\"proletarian\\" origins of his ballpoint pens; office supplies and stationery such as loose leaf paper, corporate letterheads or memo pads, and post-it notes have all been utilized. This, he has explained, is in line with the \\"doodle\\"-like aspects commonly associated with these materials. Media reception Lennie Mace, pictured with Lady Killer/Bull Market work-in-progress (ballpoint pen on newspaper, Media Graffiti Series) New York, 1998. New York Press supported Lennie Mace's early exhibitions by promoting his \\"superfine, surrealistic, and elegant\\" ballpoint artwork. Writer and performer David Aaron Clark, a fellow Screw magazine alumni and sometime collaborator, also promoted Mace's early exhibitions in previews describing \\"giddy, sleek masterpieces of fantasy and sensuality.\\" Mace has professed to a \\"something for everyone\\" approach to filling exhibitions with whatever artwork is available at the time, including random sketch work, which has spurred criticism. The same critics, however, favored him as \\"a draftsman of almost infinite talent.\\" He has also been called a master of ballpoint pen artwork, and his 2012 \\"Pen Pal\\" exhibition in San Francisco was championed as \\"technically exceptional and conceptually intriguing.\\" Hi Fructose art magazine commended the \\"intricate worlds\\" rendered by Mace in a review of the same exhibition. One 1996 Media Graffiti titled Thank You Calvin, Thank You Kate garnered media attention at the time of its exhibition for Mace's playful \\"manipulation.\\" The title refers to fashion designer Calvin Klein and model Kate Moss. The target of the artist's embellishment, in this case, was a risqu√© magazine ad for Calvin Klein's Obsession perfume. The black and white ad showed a nude Kate Moss from her waist up with one hand raised to her mouth coyly and one bare breast visible. A pocket-sized figure added by Mace in pink ink clings to Kate's arm, fixated and reaching for her nipple ‚Äî also subtly highlighted in pink ‚Äî as a baby's pacifier falls from his mouth, agape. The image, as presupposed by the media, implies that Mace's figure prefers the real nipple over its plastic imitation, and the title implying the artist's gratitude for being provided such ripe source material. Mace's flair for imbuing his Media Graffiti with \\"sexual and cultural double entendres\\" was again publicized during his 365DAZE project in 1998. Juxtapoz art magazine's sister publication Erotica published a set of the series' \\"dirty pictures\\" featuring another Calvin Klein ad \\"liberated\\" as the issue's centerfold pin-up spread. Onto a black and white underwear ad showing a woman being handled by a man from behind, Mace adds a few extra hands, including one cutting through her blouse with scissors, and the annotation \\"Her Wish? His? Mine? Yours?\\" A Spanish magazine in 1998 featured Mace in an interview titled El Picasso Del Boligrafo (The Ballpoint Picasso), presenting his Media Graffiti and 365DAZE project. Mace's artwork appeared on the cover and throughout the magazine. The article noted the artist's vivid imagination.Medico Interamericano; http://www.icps.org/Default.aspx?tabid=2510; Vol.18 No.7, 1999; Cover art & pgs. 352~ ReferencesExternal links * Lennie Mace official website, \\"tickertape\\" presentation of artwork * Artist's statement, \\"Pen Pal\\" exhibition 2012, San Francisco * Lennie Mace Market products website * The Ballpointer online journal covering ballpoint pen artwork 1965 births Living people American contemporary artists Artists from New York (state) American graffiti artists American illustrators ","title":"Lennie Mace"},{"id":"35983940","text":"James Mylne is a British contemporary artist known for his drawings in ballpoint pen. His technical abilities with the unorthodox art medium have earned Mylne recognition in Europe and the UK. The Ballpointer online journal called Mylne \\"Britain's premier ballpoint pen artist\\" in a 2015 feature article. The artist's photorealist likenesses of iconic celebrities attracted early media attention and continues to be one aspect of his output. Mylne also creates mixed-media works adding spray paint, magic markers and more to his ballpoint originals. Artwork expressing personal views and broader interests flourished throughout 2014. Art education James Mylne attended foundation courses at Chelsea Art College, London, in 2002. Studies there were followed by 3 years at Camberwell, where he received his BA in drawing in 2005 and his MA in 2006. College instructors were unsupportive of his ballpoint usage, and dismissed his work as \\"pretty pictures\\". Ballpoint usage As with many other bored students ‚Äî artists or not ‚Äî Mylne doodled in biro (as ballpoint pens are known in the UK) during secondary school. Although he has spoken of original aspirations to be a painter and was still painting at the age of 18, James had already begun giving ballpoint pens greater consideration as an art medium since he was 16, or \\"around 1996\\". By his college years, prior to widespread popularity of the internet, Mylne was still approaching his ballpoint pen usage as if he were the only one using them to create art, ignorant of anyone else using them. Of his choice of ballpoints as a preferred medium, Mylne credits the pen's capabilities of precision and distinct contrast. Such \\"technical\\" aspects of the medium have interested him most, in part fueling his desire \\"to master ballpoint photorealism\\". Mylne has said that biros appeal to him because of the concentration required. Separately, he adds, \\"you find them everywhere.\\" Upon completion of formal studies, he launched a website dedicated to disseminating information of ballpoint pens as an alternative art medium. Mylne was one of the earliest of artists using ballpoint pens who exploited the internet to promote their work, which in turn attracted attention to ballpoint pens as an art medium overall. He continues to run a blog with the same purposes, and his ongoing YouTube contributions have attracted a following. Polo Pony 1; 2008, ballpoint pen on paper, 20 x 30cm. Art career England's BBC London News program reported in a 2014 interview that James Mylne sold his first work of art when he was nineteen years old. Exhibitions of his ballpoint drawings began in 2001. In his photorealistic artworks, subject matter has included wildlife (shown at right), urban landscapes and the female form. Mylne's ballpoint pen replicas of iconic photos of entertainers and artists from Britain and America, including Audrey Hepburn and Jean-Michel Basquiat, were the first to attract attention. Hepburn became a recurring \\"muse\\". Kate Moss' visage has also appeared prominently in James Mylne's artwork. Two of the artist's photorealistic ballpoint likenesses of Moss were chosen as art magazine covers, the first in 2009K9 magazine, Ukraine; ISSN 1818-7552; December 2009, Alexis Olin; Cover, Biro drawing of Kate Moss; Interview, pp. 16‚Äì19 and again in 2012, which also featured an interview with Mylne. One of these Kate Moss drawings reportedly required six weeks to complete. 2010-2014: Vermeer replica, Reworked and Vintage Vogue exhibitions James Mylne participated in a 2010 Bic Challenge campaign sponsored by the pen company, for which he created a replica of Vermeer‚Äôs Girl With a Pearl Earring using a single black Bic pen as part of the challenge. He appeared on British television to discuss the artwork,ITV, UK; London Tonight; interview about Pearl Earring replica; April 18, 2010 noting the 90 hours of drawing spent toward its completion. The artist and his artwork received media coverage throughout Britain and internationally via the internet at the time. Mylne participated in the first two of an exhibition series titled Reworked produced by Rook & Raven gallery, London, his representative at the time. As suggested by the exhibition title, a select group of artists was given a choice of photographs lensed by a featured photographer, to interpret as they wished. Terry O‚ÄôNeill was the featured photographer of the inaugural Reworked exhibition in 2010. Mylne was chosen as one of six artists to collaborate with the renowned photographer for Terry O'Neill, Reworked. The artist opted for a vintage photograph of Sean Connery as his James Bond character, shot during filming of Diamonds Are Forever. Mylne used only black ballpoints, but produced a limited-edition print with additional background colour. Terry O'Neill made an appearance with the artwork (and the photograph from which it was copied) on British television, expressing amazement at the four weeks Mylne spent working on his contribution.ITV1, UK; This Morning; Terry O‚ÄôNeill speaks about the artwork & exhibition; April 14, 2012 Photographs of Mylne drawing the image also appeared in British media.Telegraph Magazine, UK: photograph of artist drawing Sean Connery from Terry O‚ÄôNeill photo. March 2010 The second installment of the Reworked exhibitions was held in March 2013, featuring the photography of Bill Wyman, the bass guitarist and founding member of The Rolling Stones who was also known as an avid photographer. He was introduced to Rook & Raven by Terry O'Neill, the previously featured photographer, who'd photographed the band since their early years. Mylne was among five artists selected for Bill Wyman, Reworked, and contributed reworkings of two Wyman photos. One of Mylne's contributions was his black and white reinterpretation of a colour photo Wyman had taken of American model Jerry Hall, a former wife of bandmate Mick Jagger. James Mylne's Vintage Vogue was his first major solo exhibition, gaining widespread publicity via the internet. The central theme of the October, 2012, exhibition drew on \\"the elegance and style\\" of celebrated icons of the 1940s, 50s and 60s. Among the celebrities illustrated in this collection were Coco Chanel and Steve McQueen. 2014-2015: Torn and Anti Con Art series, Microsoft digital pens In what would be the first of several shifts by Mylne in 2014, the artist took new steps with his photorealism by getting involved in producing his own photo references instead of using existing photos. The results became Mylne's Torn series, debuted in his Something More exhibition. Mylne combined the photos with his matching ballpoint pen drawings, torn as if exposing different layers, emulating the way torn street posters expose older layers beneath. In August, 2014, the artist worked with Microsoft to promote the company's new Surface Pro 3 tablet and digital pen. Using the new medium, Mylne recreated some of the most famous portrait paintings in Britain's National Portrait Gallery in London, including the Chandos portrait of William Shakespeare. Mylne commented on the similarities of the two seemingly disparate technologies, calling it a \\"surprisingly easy transition\\". His digital depictions were displayed at the institution as part of the promotional campaign. Mylne also began his Anti Con Art series in 2014, for the first time baring personal views through his artwork. As he explained in a \\"manifesto\\" released in December, Mylne felt that \\"contemporary art has been hijacked by an untalented, academic, self- appointed elite\\", and used the new series to take jabs at what he labels the \\"Art Mafia\\". Mylne justified openly expressing such views in an interview with The Ballpointer, stating \\"I think more people sympathize than actually condemn (such views)\\". Mylne continued expressing himself more personally through his artwork into 2015. He began the year promoting his JRM Desktop series through a variety of group and pop-up exhibitions. Artwork in this series show a blend of many alternate interests, while blending ballpoint pen heavily with mixed media. Says Mylne, \\"I think it's not the artwork that is of value but the artist in the artwork. The artist's spirit, thoughts, concerns have to shine through the work.\\" He also describes the series as \\"a nice break from the rigorously detailed portraits\\". Style & Technique James Mylne uses only black ink when working in ballpoint pen. Regardless of the many ballpoint pen brands available, he is known to prefer the Bic \\"biro\\". To add color, Mylne employs acrylics, gouache, spray paint and paint pens. The artist finds paint pens useful for filling larger areas of black. For background color, Mylne masks off the silhouette of a figure he'll be drawing, then applies flat fields of colour using spray paint. Mylne's Anti Con Art series shows ballpoint-penned characters interacting with others painted in acrylic or gouache. To achieve this trick Mylne will simply paint around previously penned areas or leave those intended areas blank while painting, then ink them afterward. Mylne admits to being \\"passionate about detail\\", adding that ballpoints allow for great detail and subtle halftones \\"if you know how to use them\\". Halftone effects are achieved by controlled spacing of parallel ballpoint lines while referencing his source material. During a live show-and- tell appearance on Britain's Blue Peter television program, Mylne explained that he works \\"very slowly\\", using pencil for preliminary outlines. He begins with what he perceives to be \\"the most difficult bit\\" ‚Äî a person's eyes, for example ‚Äî \\"because that's the most important bit to get right\\". Mylne has admitted to having to start over after making a mistake. For the most part, Mylne finds most of his source-images online. Often, he has to \\"infer\\" details into his own drawing to compensate for loss of detail which occurs when \\"scaling-up\\" small, inferior data into larger, detailed artwork, describing the process as \\"almost creating a new image\\". For his 2014 Torn series, Mylne took an active role in the production of his photographic references, working with photographers and models. James Mylne work-in-progress (UK) 2010 Media reception Reaction to James Mylne's artwork has been generally favorable. Orlando Lebron, in a 2015 article for the online trade journal The Ballpointer, observed, \\"Many other so-called hyper-realist ballpointers' artwork rely on distance or reduction to tighten loosely hatched linework. Mylne's artwork needs no such buffer\\". Other reviewers have described Mylne as a \\"master technician\\", and commended the \\"stunning likenesses\\" he portrays, which \\"gain a lifelike presence\\". Mylne's photorealist ballpoint pen artworks are so finely inked that they are often mistaken for photo prints, even when viewed up-close. Mylne has related one instance where his artwork was denied entry into a \\"notable\\" exhibition because photography was not permitted. Dylan Jones, writing about Mylne for British GQ in 2015, both complemented and questioned the attraction of his ballpoint artwork. While on one hand stating, \\"when they're good they're very good indeed\\" and calling Mylne an \\"extraordinary talent\\", Jones also comments that \\"taken from famous photographs\\", the imagery takes on \\"a cheap, second-hand flavor\\", and cites a third-party source who stated \\"you're appreciating the technique rather than artistic flair\\". In defense of occasional criticism about lack of depth in his work, James had previously countered that true fans of his work are \\"taking it at face value\\" and, as his work is not intended to serve any deeper purpose, he's 'fine with that'. At the same time, Mylne's output had been undergoing notable shifts throughout 2014 beyond the \\"straightforward\\" photorealism of several years earlier. Personal Mylne acknowledges some artistic influence from street art during the early 2000s, owing to disillusionment by the sensationalism of the YBA generation prevalent at that time. Mylne used his Anti Con Art series (2014‚Äìpresent) to begin airing views about contemporary art and art world politics, in general. Tibetan Buddhism is a continuing inspiration to the artist. In 2014 Mylne parted ways with his longtime gallery. He now lists himself as \\"independent\\" of gallery representation.

They lived during the late Lower Cambrian and species occurred on all paleocontinents.  Taxonomy  Palmer and Repina assigned Gabriellus and Callavia to the Olenelloidea, but the ocular lobes in these two genera circumscribe the entire lateral border of the frontal lobe of the glabella, and thus, do not belong to this superfamily, but to the Judomioidea. Geyer assigned Cambropallas to the Olenelloidea, but it lacks the diagnostic features and appears to be closely related to Andalusiana, and is now considered to be an advanced member of the Nevadioidea.  Distribution  In western Laurentia Fallotaspididae and Archaeaspididae proceed the first Olenelloidea. The Holmiidae occur at the late Atdabanian, and are contemporary with the Nevadioidea. They are followed by Biceratopsidae and Olenellidae.  Description  As with most early trilobites, the Olenelloidea have an almost flat exoskeleton, that is only thinly calcified, and has crescent-shaped eye ridges. As part of the Olenellina suborder, the Olenelloidea lack dorsal sutures. The superfamily can be distinguished from all other Olenellina by features of the cephalon and in particular the glabella. The backward portion of the third lateral lobe of the glabella counted from the back (L3) bulges laterally relative to the first lateral lobe (L1). The front end of the eye lobe (or ocular lobe) is connected only to the back half of the frontal lobe (AL or L4) of the glabella, and merges smoothly with it (rather than merely contacting it). The ocular lobe consists of an inner and outer band.

Fragment inedit des Memoires d‚Äôun inconnu. Tolstoy wrote it on a trip to France from Frankfurt, where he was attached to the Russian Embassy. It was translated into Russian by Boleslav Markevich, as \\"–°–µ–º—å—è –≤—É—Ä–¥–∞–ª–∞–∫–∞\\" (Semya‚Ä≤ vurdala‚Ä≤ka), published for the first time in The Russian Messenger in January, 1884. The original French text appeared in print in 1950, in Revue des Etudes Slavs, vol.26. The Reunion After Three Hundred Years (Les Rendez- vous Dans Trois Cent Ani) which was written at about the same time and which might be regarded as a sequel (for protagonist Marquis d'Urfe and Countess Grammon appear in it) first appeared in a compilation Le Poete Alexis Tolstoi by A.Lirondelle (Paris, 1912). The word vourdalak occurs first in Pushkin's work in the early 19th century, and was taken up in Russian literary language following Pushkin. It is a distortion of words referring to vampires (originally probably to werewolves) in Slavic and Balkan folklore ‚Äì cf. Slavic v«élkolak, volkodlak, volkolak, vukodlak, wurdulak, etc.; Romanian V√¢rcolac; and Greek Vrykolakas (both borrowed from the Slavic term).M. Fasmer, Etymological Dictionary Russian Language. Plot summary Marquis d'Urf√©, a young French diplomat, finds himself in a small Serbian village, in the house of an old peasant named Gorcha. The host is absent: he left the house ten days ago along with some other men to hunt for a Turk outlaw Alibek. Upon leaving he told his sons, GeorgesThe Serbian form of the name would be ƒêorƒëe. The Russian translation uses –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π (Georgiy). and Pierre,The Serbian form of the name would be Petar or Pera. The Russian translation uses –ü—ë—Ç—Ä (Pyotr). that they should wait for him for ten days sharp and, should he come a minute later, kill him by driving a stake through his heart for then he‚Äôd be not a man but a vourdalak (vampire). The day Marquis comes to the village is the tenth day of Gorcha's absence. The family awaits the hour with growing anxiety and there he is, appearing on the road at 8 o'clock in the evening, exactly on the time he left ten days ago. His sons are uncertain as to how this strange precision should be interpreted. Georges suspects his father became a vourdalak, Pierre insists otherwise. Then Georges' son dies inexplicably. The French diplomat has to leave the house and continue his travel. Half a year later on his way back from his mission, d'Urf√© returns to the village only to find it abandoned. Coming to the familiar house he stays for the night, being allured by Sdenka,The Slavic form of the name would be Zdenka (–ó–¥–µ–Ω–∫–∞), which is used in the Russian translation. Gorcha's daughter he fell for during his first visit, who appears to dwell in the empty house. The moment comes when the Frenchman realizes he's fallen under the charms of a vampire. He makes an attempt to leave, comes under a massive attack of vourdalaks, all of the Gorcha family among them, and makes a miraculous escape, having to thank his own good luck and the agility of his horse. In film The novella became the basis for \\"I Wurdulak\\", one of the three parts of Mario Bava's 1963 film Black Sabbath, featuring Boris Karloff. The 1972 Italian/Spanish film The Night of the Devils was also based on Tolstoy's story. A glancing reference to the novella occurs in Guy Wilson's 2012 film, Werewolf: The Beast Among Us; when an undead victim of a werewolf attack arises and is shot by the grandson of the Great Hunter who exclaims, \\"I hate goddamn Vourdalaks.\\" English translation *Vampires: Stories of the Supernatural, Hawthorn Books, 1973.

Business partners of Aston University Engineering Academy include E.ON, Goodrich Corporation, National Grid plc, PTC and the Royal Air Force. The new purpose-built school building of the UTC is located at the edge of the Aston University campus. Admissions Aston University Engineering Academy has an initial intake of students aged 14 and 16 (academic years 10 and 12) in 2012, but will expand to accommodate students aged 14 to 19 over the following two years. The schools catchment area covers the entirety of the Birmingham metropolitan borough. Curriculum Aston University Engineering Academy specialises in different aspects of engineering. Pupils aged 14 to 16 study a core selected number of GCSEs along with either a Higher Diploma in Engineering or BTEC First Diploma in Engineering. For sixth form education, students can choose between four study programmes: * An Advanced Diploma in Engineering and additional A Levels * BTEC National Diploma in Engineering and additional A Levels * Mathematics and Science A levels programme * Apprenticeships The building The Academy building is a new-build scheme, built on the site of a former manufacturing facility demolished many years before. It backs onto the Grand Union Canal and is opposite Faraday Wharf, and within easy walking distance of the sponsors Aston University campus. The scheme formed part of Birmingham's Building Schools for the Future programme before it was cancelled, and as such was built by Lend Lease. The Architect was Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, with civil and structural consultants Cox Turner Morse, and building services consultants Cundall. The academy comprises approximately 6,500m¬≤ of accommodation over 3 floors (excluding basements). Unusually, due to changes in ground level from front to back of the site, the main entrance is at first floor level, with the reception area opening out into a triple-height atrium and staircase at the heart of the building. Site constraints, and the proximity to the inner ring road of Dartmouth Middleway, required the building to be very compact and needed to insulate the occupants from external traffic noise and poor air quality. Consequently, the building has a high performance sealed facade and glazing system, and required a heavily serviced solution to provide the necessary heating, ventilation and comfort cooling for the occupants. To offset potentially high energy consumption and running costs, the services design incorporates a full fresh air ventilation system with free cooling and energy recovery, a basement thermal labyrinth, a small Combined Heat and Power (CHP) engine, energy efficient lighting systems, and 50kWp of photovoltaic panels. The canal elevation is more sheltered and provides for hard landscaped dining and community areas for students.

The storyline is based on a Gujarati stage-play entitled Kanji Virudh Kanji, originally written by co-writer Saumya Joshi, with Bhavesh Mandalia as an additional co-writer. The film features Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar in the lead roles, along with Mithun Chakraborty, Om Puri, Govind Namdeo, Poonam Jhawer, Puja Gupta and Mahesh Manjrekar in pivotal roles. Made on a budget of , the film released on 28 September 2012 was praised for its themes and for Rawal's performance. The film was remade in Telugu as Gopala Gopala in 2015 with Venkatesh and Pawan Kalyan in the lead roles and in Kannada with Upendra and Sudeep titled as Mukunda Murari in 2016. Plot Kanji Lalji Mehta (Paresh Rawal), a middle-class atheist Hindu owns a shop of Hindu idols and antiques in Mumbai. He makes fun of religious activities around him and one such day, a low-intensity earthquake hits the city, and Kanji's shop is the only shop that is destroyed. His family and friends blame this on his atheism. At the insurance office, Kanji learns that the disaster claim does not cover any damage caused by natural calamities classified under \\"Act of God\\". Running out of options, he decides to sue God but fails to find a lawyer for such a lawsuit. Hanif Qureshi (Om Puri), a poor Muslim lawyer, helps him file the case after Kanji decides to fight on his own. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as to religious priests, Siddheshwar Maharaj, Gopi Maiyya, and their group's founder, Leeladhar Swamy (Mithun Chakraborty), summoning them to court as representatives of God. As the court case commences and gains traction for its bizarre quality, Kanji finds himself facing armed fundamentalists and harassment, with his mortgage bank occupying the house, and his wife and kids leaving him. He is rescued from all of this by Krishna Vasudev Yadav (Akshay Kumar), who claims to be a real estate agent originally from Gokul, Uttar Pradesh, but appears to do fantastical tricks not possible for a human. The lawsuit causes a public outcry. On Krishna's advice, Kanji goes to the media and gets wide coverage. Many people in a similar situation join him in the lawsuit, causing the amount of claims to skyrocket and Catholic priests and Muslim Mullahs to also be summoned as defendants. When the court demands written proof that the earthquake was an 'Act of God,' Krishna steers Kanji toward holy books like Bhagavad Gita, The Quran and The Bible. Kanji reads them and finds a passage in each that says the world and all that happen in it, from beginning to end, is a creation of God and comes from God's will alone. This strengthens his case and increases public support. However, Kanji suffers a stroke in court and is rushed to the hospital where he goes into a coma and is paralyzed. When he opens his eyes after a month, he finds Krishna, who reveals that he is God, and proves it by curing Kanji completely. He further reveals that He created the entire world, animals and humans but religion was created by humans, and he was the one who destroyed Kanji's shop because he sought to punish the godmen who showed his fear to public, to earn money. He adds that he created the entire world and thus doesn't like to live in temples contrary to what the godmen claims and he is not interested in the offerings he gets from devotees. Instead, he created millions of humans who die of hunger and would be glad if those offerings were given to them instead. He figured out that an atheist like Kanji would end up exposing them if he destroys his Shop, and thus destroyed it by causing the disaster and started to help him with lawsuit by appearing as a human and befriending him, and revealed himself in his true form so that Kanji realises that although he does exist, he doesn't live in temples, but in every creature he created. Kanji learns that the lawsuit's verdict was in his favor and religious organizations were ordered by court to pay the compensation to all the plaintiffs; people have begun revering Kanji himself as a god. Leeladhar, Gopi Maiyya, and Siddheshwar have taken advantage of this by opening a temple dedicated to Kanji and accumulating millions in donations. Krishna explains to Kanji that his job as God is to show people right and wrong - people do with it what they will. Kanji decides to fight back. He breaks his own statue, admonishing the crowd about trusting in God-men. He advises them to search for God in themselves and in others, not in statues; that God is everywhere, not just in temples, and faith should come from within. He tells them not to believe in fraudulent God-men, as their job is to turn religion into business. Krishna looks on proudly as Kanji speaks, then vanishes when Kanji tries to reach him after. Kanji is reunited with his family and sees Krishna's key chain on the ground. When he is about to keep it, he hears Krishna's voice, telling him to get rid of the key chain as fear of God and reliance on religious objects was what he'd fought against all this time. Kanji smiles and throws it away, watching as it disappears in the sky with a flash.

It sets on Baring Island (aka Banks Island) in the Canadian Arctic. The novel was well received and longlisted for the children's Northern Ireland Book Award 2010-11. Plot Michael Monroe, a teenage orphan boy, accidentally burns down his boarding school, St Mark's Retreat, by setting a fire in one of the many disused fireplaces. As a result, he is expelled from his sixth school in as many years and leaves on the bus the next morning, to be handed over to the local education authority. During this journey, however, the driver loses control of the bus and drives into an icy lake. Monroe then proceeds, along with the head boy Vincent Armoury, to save the lives of the school's debate team, who were on their way to a competition, before they all drown. When Armoury is hit in the head during the operation, Monroe pulls him from the water, administers the kiss of life and passes out. Monroe's heroic effort in the rescue of twelve children results in him coming to the attention of Doctor Jimmy Kincaid, millionaire owner of a team named SOS, which engages in risky rescue operations on a worldwide scale. Monroe's first mission is to search for the missing \\"Eden\\" satellite, which had been measuring greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Deployment for the mission doesn't go to plan and Monroe ends up stranded in the Canadian Rockies with fellow teen-aged SOS member, Katya, who somewhat resents his presence on the mission.

Early life Jacobson was born in 1971 to a Jewish familyhttps://twitter.com/milessi/status/537217871307612160?lang=en. His father was an inventor and his mother was a teacher. Jacobson was raised in Watford. A talented musician, his childhood ambition was to become a singer, and he spent more time on music than education when at school, singing or playing at the Royal Opera House, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall, the Barbican and St Martin-in-the-Fields during this time, and appeared in Carmen alongside Jos√© Carreras. However his singing ability was affected by the voice change during puberty. He attended Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School on a scholarship - fellow pupils at the time included Matt Lucas and Sacha Baron Cohen. He also became a keen fan of Watford F.C. in his childhood, attending his first game at Vicarage Road on his seventh birthday. His interest in and love for music sowed the seeds for his early career; while working in a record shop he produced a fanzine which caught the eye of the then NME editor Steve Lamacq. Lamacq helped Jacobson to secure his first position in the music business, introducing him to Andy Ross of Food Records, who hired him as an A&R; manager. During his time in the music business (with Food and Polygram Island Music), Jacobson worked with a number of household names, including Jesus Jones, Dubstar, Shampoo, Blur, Feeder, Fatboy Slim and The Bluetones. Sports Interactive Sports Interactive was founded in 1994 by Paul and Oliver Collyer on the back of the success they had achieved with a game they had originally created in their Shropshire bedrooms in the late 1980s. That game was first published commercially in 1992 as Championship Manager. Jacobson first became involved in Sports Interactive as a fan of the game, after obtaining an advance copy of Championship Manager 2 in exchange for two Blur concert tickets, offering his services as one of the early testers. The Collyer brothers realised that Jacobson's abilities and experience would be put to better use in other areas and he became the fledgling company's unofficial business advisor. Jacobson quickly became an integral part of the team, assuming the role of part-time Managing Director in 1999 before finally taking the helm on a full-time basis in 2001. Under Jacobson's management, Sports Interactive has grown from a fledgling start-up employing five people to one of the best-known names in UK game development with a staff of almost 100 and a network of roughly 1,300 scouts across the globe. To date, the studio has sold in excess of 15 million games, has been responsible for six of the top 10 fastest-selling PC games of all time in the UK (five of which are from the Football Manager series) and has enjoyed more than 200 weeks at No.1 in the PC charts. Sports Interactive also has been responsible for five of the top 20 best-selling PC games of all time in the UK. The Football Manager catalogue has expanded in recent years and now includes versions for both iOS and Android devices as well as a forthcoming free-to-play with microtransaction online game called Football Manager Online, co-developed by the Korean company KTH. Charitable endeavours Outside Sports Interactive, Jacobson is heavily involved with the War Child charity, working as part of its entertainment committee. This committee is responsible for music-based fundraising initiatives which include record releases (including the Heroes album, the Young Soul Rebels single) and live events which have, to date, included gigs featuring Kasabian, La Roux, Al Murray, Jason Manford, Madness, Plan B, The Killers and Coldplay (the latter pair's gig also involved an encore featuring Gary Barlow and Bono). War Child also receive a donation for each copy of Football Manager sold, raising more than ¬£700,000 to date, and in 2011, Jacobson went on a trip with the charity to the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2008, Jacobson was one of the co-founders of GamesAid, a broker for charitable activity on behalf of the games industry (and sponsor of the Paddington Academy). He is also currently working on a charitable project in Mozambique, giving local villages business opportunities whilst also helping the environment by planting fruit trees which thrive in the area. He recently became involved with the Nordoff-Robbins music therapy charity, where he is part of a committee that organises the annual Football Extravaganza dinner, the most recent of which raised more than ¬£400,000 for the charity. He also recently became a vice-president for the charity Special Effect, which makes gaming accessible for people with severe disabilities. Other work and honours A former Entrepreneur of the Year (London) finalist, Jacobson serves as a Creative Business Mentor for NESTA, is a Develop conference steering committee member, and has previously been on the steering committee for the Edinburgh Interactive Festival and was on the BAFTA steering committee for video games for 6 years until June 2012. In addition to making regular appearances on national TV and radio, Jacobson has also appeared as a panellist and interviewee at festivals and conferences, not just for the games industry, but also at the Edinburgh TV festival and conferences organised by the music business strategy consultancy MusicAlly. In 2011, Jacobson was awarded the OBE in the Queen's New Year's Honours List for services to the gaming industry. On 13 July 2018 Jacobson announced that he is battling melanoma https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/1017740159725514753 .

It tells the story of a seriously wounded soldier during World War II being carried on a stretcher through the school which he left three months earlier, because the school is being used as a makeshift military hospital. The narrator slowly notices details confirming where he is, but ignores and explains them away in an internal monologue. At the end of the story, in the art room, he sees unmistakable confirmation that he is indeed in his old school: his own handwriting in chalk on the blackboard: Stranger, bear word to the Spartans we... The story was first published by Verlag Friedrich Middelhauve in 1950 as the title story in a short story collection. Today, Stranger, Bear Word to the Spartans We... is one of B√∂ll's most famous stories and is one of the best known of examples of Tr√ºmmerliteratur (\\"Rubble literature\\").  Plot  The unnamed first-person narrator begins the story in a truck and is transported through a partially burning city that he cannot identify, and is also unable to accurately gauge the amount of time spent traveling. He arrives in front of a makeshift field hospital set up inside of a school and is carried inside on a stretcher, describing the details of the corridors and staircases that he passes through. Everything seems eerily familiar to him, but he ascribes those feelings to the pain and his fever. The narrator entertains the thought that all schools use the same interior layout and decorations, which would explain why he recognizes every door sign or picture on the wall. In the art room, while waiting for the doctor to come, he asks one of his companions where he is, and learns he is actually in Bendorf, his hometown, but is still uncertain that he is indeed in his old Gymnasium, named after Frederick the Great, in which he spent eight years as a pupil. Alongside the question of his location, a second question of the severity of his wounds is raised. Both of these questions are answered directly after one another: he sees his own handwriting on the chalkboard, containing the quote \\"Stranger, bear word to the Spartans we...\\"from three months agotruncated because his lettering was too large to fit on the board. Right after this realization, he also discovers that both of his arms and one of his legs are missing. The narrator recognizes the firemanwho was looking after him while waiting for the doctor to cometo be Mr. Birgeler, the custodian of his old school, with whom the narrator drank his milk during the breaks between classes. The story ends with the arrival of the doctor and the narrator whispering \\"Milk...\\" to Birgeler. Although the story is written in the first person past tense, it is left uncertain if the narrator survives his injuries.  Title  The title is directly taken from Schiller's translation of the famous Epitaph of Simonides, commemorating the heroic Battle of Thermopylae. In German, the full distich reads: :Wanderer, kommst du nach Sparta, verk√ºndige dorten, du habest Uns hier liegen gesehn, wie das Gesetz es befahl.\\"Friedrich Schiller: Der Spaziergang, 1795, lines 97f. Accessible through Wikisource, 2012-08-25. The historic context thus praises death while defending the Vaterland and had in fact therefore been specially selected to prepare the young men for war. B√∂ll uses it to demonstrate that even the \\"humanities-oriented\\" Gymnasium had their curricula adapted to Nazi propaganda. At the same time, the German title cuts the word Sparta short to Spa..., bringing up thoughts about the municipality of Spa, Belgium, site of the German Headquarters during the previous Great War. The current World War II is thereby shown as history repeating itself.J. H. Reid: Heinrich B√∂ll, \\"Wanderer, kommst du nach Spa...\\".

It depicts a bluejeans-wearing Heracles (Roman Hercules) wrestling with the horns of a bull, a shape the protean river god Achelous was able to assume. The myth was one of the explanations offered by Greco-Roman mythology for the origin of the cornucopia, a symbol of agricultural abundance. Benton sets the scene during harvest time in the U.S. Midwest. The mural was formerly displayed at a department store in Kansas City, Missouri, and is now in the collections of the Smithsonian. It was the first of Benton's paintings on a river-related theme.Justin Wolff, Thomas Hart Benton: A Life (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2012), p. 287. Description Achelous and Heracles is displayed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, on the second floor of the north wing.Smithsonian American Art Museum, Achelous and Hercules collections information page. The painting was executed in egg tempera and oil on canvas, and affixed to a plywood panel measuring 62‚Öû by 264‚Öõ inches (159.6 by 671 cm).Charles C. Eldredge, John Steuart Curry's Hoover and the Flood: Painting and Modern History (University of North Carolina Press, 2007), p. 22, where he rounds the dimensions to 63 by 262 inches. Elizabeth Broun, director of the art museum, has described it as \\"raucous, gaudy, vibrant ... full of surging shapes and churning rhythms.\\"Elizabeth Broun, \\"Celebrating American Abundance,\\" Director's Choice tour. The central figure is the muscular, shirtless \\"Hercules\\" grappling with the horns of the bull. A second man, also wearing bluejeans and no shirt, stands by the bull's haunch and holds the end of a rope that swirls into another man's hand in the foreground, where the work of woodchopping has been interrupted. The bull's tail points into the surging, wavelike woods that rise out of the distance; a barn and silo emerge from the woods to the right. The undulating line of the rope and tail visually connect the woodlands and the timber produced from it. The right half of the panel is dominated by a giant bounty-producing cornucopia on which a dark- haired woman reclines, leaning on her elbow with her eyes closed. Above her, a standing blonde with a less voluptuous figure holds aloft a wind-blown piece of red drapery, extending her right hand to offer a laurel wreath in mid-air. This section of the mural brings together two communicative gestures: the presentation of the wreath, and the salutation of a silhouetted mule-mounted rider in the background who raises his hat in greeting or jubilation. A darker-skinned boy, dressed in overalls, sits next to the women on the cornucopia and holds a white cone. He is mirrored to the far left of the mural by an adult African-American who leans on a split-rail fence and watches the scene, head lifted in poised anticipation. Three sheaves rise up in the landscape behind him. A fourth sheaf appears in the foreground to the right, where a man kneels with a bushel of corn ears, ready to add to the harvest bounty. Finally, a paddle steamer navigates the calm river in the background, another example of how the river is tamed.The significance of the steamboat is noted in the Smithsonian's Educational Insights feature on the mural. Mythological tradition The subject matter of Achelous and Hercules derives from a telling of the myth in Thomas Bulfinch's Mythology.Eldredge, John Steuart Curry, p. 20. As a river god, Achelous normally provides \\"life-giving irrigation,\\" but takes the form of a destructive bull at floodtime: > Hercules' conquest of the river-god was meant to evoke the taking of > Missouri waterways by Kansas City pioneers; the horn that Hercules snaps > from Achelous' head symbolizes the cornucopia of midwestern > agriculture.Erika Doss, Benton, Pollock, and the Politics of Modernism: From > Regionalism to Abstract Expressionism (University of Chicago Press, 1991), > p. 365. Deianira, over whom Hercules and Achelous fought, represents fecundity. She is seated on a proleptic cornucopia‚Äîthe bull's horn has yet to be severed‚Äîfrom which fruits and vegetables spill. The timber in the foreground provides an important natural resource while clearing the land for farming. The Midwest is envisioned as \\"abundant and fertile and full of promise.\\" \\"The story is thus applicable to our own land,\\" Benton wrote in a pamphlet distributed at the store where the work was first mounted. \\"It fits our Missouri River, which yet needs the attention of a Hercules.\\"Benton as quoted by Wolff, Thomas Hart Benton, p. 287. Social context Achelous and Hercules was painted for display at Harzfeld's department store in Kansas City.Doss, Benton, Pollock, and the Politics of Modernism, p. 366. The store specialized in ready-to-wear clothing for women, and Benton later acknowledged that it was strange to see his work \\"in an atmosphere of silk nighties, pink slips and perfume.\\" It was his first mural commission since his historical murals for the Missouri State Capitol ten years before. In light of controversies over that project, Benton sought reassurance that Harzfeld's corporate president, Lester Siegel, would refrain from trying to exercise artistic control. Siegel in turn asked that Benton observe a certain degree of decorum. After the store closed in 1984, its parent company Allied Stores Corporation made a gift of it to the Smithsonian through the institution's Collections Acquisition Program.Smithsonian American Art Museum, Achelous and Hercules collections information page. The painting was among several of its time on the theme of \\"watery disaster,\\" reflecting a concern with flood and water management that was addressed through public works of the Depression and post-Depression era. The economy of Kansas City in the 1940s was largely based on agriculture, which in turn was both dependent on the water supply and vulnerable to flooding from the Missouri and Kaw rivers. The Army Corps of Engineers had begun flood-control efforts on the Missouri when Benton was creating the work, and American agricultural bounty was contributing to the post-war rebuilding of Europe through the Marshall Plan. The mural was in part Benton's response to criticism from H.W. Janson of the nationalist ideology he perceived in the art of Benton and fellow Regionalist painters.Doss, Benton, Pollock, and the Politics of Modernism, pp. 364‚Äì365. Doss characterizes Benton as \\"the last living member of the regionalist triumvirate that Janson was intent on seeing dead and buried\\" (p. 364), referring to John Steuart Curry and Grant Wood. A few weeks before Benton began work, Janson had published the second of two lengthy articles criticizing the Regionalists for \\"racial and national chauvinism.\\" The mythologizing of Midwestern themes was intended to grant them a universal significance, but for Janson this approach recalled the recasting of Greek myths in contemporary settings under Nazi Germany.C√©cile Whiting, Antifascism in American Art (Yale University Press, 1989), p. 128. Aesthetic considerations Achelous and Hercules also served as Benton's assertion of the figurative mode in contrast to the abstract expressionism of his former student Jackson Pollock. The critical reception of this effort was not always positive: \\"More often than not, ... Benton's mythic visions of the Midwest looked more lewd or awkward than eternally noble. Achelous and Hercules is unnaturally stylized, as Midwestern maids take balletic leaps through the air and farmers pose like toreadors in a bullring.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Smithsonian American Art Museum, Achelous and Hercules, Educational Insights \\"Zoom It\\" feature * Elizabeth Broun, Smithsonian American Art Museum, \\"Celebrating American Abundance,\\" Director's Choice tour Murals in the United States 20th-century allegorical paintings Allegorical paintings by American artists Paintings by Thomas Hart Benton Paintings depicting Heracles Culture of Kansas City, Missouri 1947 paintings Paintings of the Smithsonian American Art Museum Cattle in art ","title":"Achelous and Hercules"},{"id":"35984448","text":"Hasanabad (, also Romanized as ·∏®asanƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Zirkuh Rural District, Central District, Zirkuh County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

He was educated at the Moses Brown Preparatory School in Providence, Rhode Island and played in the high school jazz band. In 1926, he graduated from Yale College with a Bachelor of Arts in French literature and received a certificate from the Yale School of Music. He went to England in 1926-27 to study the piano with Tobias Matthay. Aldrich began studying piano in Paris in 1929 with Wanda Landowska. He soon thereafter switched to playing the harpsichord, despite it being an obscure and obsolete instrument at the time. Aldrich remained Landowska's student and research assistant for 5 years. After his studies with Landowska, Aldrich moved to the United States. He performed as soloist with the Boston Symphony and the San Francisco Symphony. He also performed as a recitalist and chamber music performer. Around this time, Putnam also became a student at Harvard University, receiving his M.A. in 1936 for \\"A Study of Vocal and Instrumental Ornamentation in the Music of the Middle Ages, with Particular Reference to the Relationship between the Two.\\" He later received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1942 with the dissertation \\"The Principal Agreements of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries: A Study in Musical Ornamentation.' Academic positions Putnam Aldrich held the post of visiting lecturer at Princeton University in 1939 and was lecturer and performer at the Berkshire Music Center from 1939 to 1942. Before coming to Stanford in 1950, he held professorial appointments at the University of Texas, Western Reserve University (Cleveland) and Mills College (Oakland). Aldrich joined the Stanford University faculty in 1950. At Stanford, he taught counterpoint, the history of baroque music, and harpsichord as well as founded the Ph.D. program in music at the university.Online Archive of California, Guide to the Putnam Aldrich Papers Aldrich was the exchange professor at Tokyo University of the Arts in 1964-65. Associations In 1949, Aldrich was a founding member of the \\"Society for Music in the Liberal Arts College,\\" an organization of music teachers which later became the College Music Society. He sat on the board of directors of the American Musicological Society in 1951, 1962 and 1966. Together with Alfred Zighera he founded the Boston Society of Ancient Instruments, and began to give performances on historical instruments. He wrote music criticism for Boston newspapers and articles on subjects such as Bach and Couperin for the Saturday Review (U.S. magazine).

It is taken by mouth. Quingestanol acetate is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body, with quingestanol and norethisterone acetate occurring as intermediates. Quingestanol acetate was patented in 1963 and was introduced for medical use in 1972. It was marketed in Italy. Medical uses Quingestanol acetate was used as an oral, once-a-month, or postcoital hormonal contraceptive. Side effectsPharmacology Quingestanol acetate is a progestogen, and also has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity. It is a prodrug of norethisterone, with both quingestanol and norethisterone acetate serving as intermediates in the transformation. Unlike penmesterol (methyltestosterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) and quinestrol (ethinylestradiol 3-cyclopentyl ether), quingestanol acetate is not stored in fat and does not have a prolonged duration of action. Chemistry Quingestanol acetate, also known as norethisterone 17Œ≤-acetate 3-cyclopentyl enol ether or as 17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone 17Œ≤-acetate 3-cyclopentyl enol ether (ENTACP), as well as 3-(cyclopentyloxy)-17Œ±-ethynylestra-3,5-dien-17Œ≤-yl acetate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of 19-nortestosterone and 17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone, or of norethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone), in which a cyclopentyl enol ether group has been attached at the C3 position and an acetate ester has been attached at the C17Œ≤ position. Quingestanol acetate is the C17Œ≤ acetate ester of quingestanol (norethisterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether). History Quingestanol acetate was patented in 1963 and marketed in Italy in 1972.

He is one of the top \\"heels\\" on the Southeastern independent circuit, especially in the Carolinas, and currently competes for CWF Mid- Atlantic where he is a record 6-time CWF Mid-Atlantic Champion. He has wrestled for a considerable number of other independent wrestling promotions, most notably, Count Grog's Southern Championship Wrestling, NWA Carolinas, and Pro Wrestling ZERO1-MAX. He was also a star in the short-lived AWA Superstars promotion holding both the promotion's world heavyweight title and tag team title (with Xsiris) during 2006 and 2007. Early life Converse was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In 1998, he graduated from Robert B. Glenn High School in Kernersville, North Carolina. A victim of bullying as a child, Converse was inspired after watching Hulk Hogan on television and decided on a career as a professional wrestler when he was only 8-years-old. On September 15, 1998, Converse enrolled at Ken Spence's School of Pro Wrestling and spent the next four months in training.McCarthy, Scott. \\"AWA World Champion Ric Converse Interview.\\" Declarationofindependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., Jul. 2010. Web. Jan. 27, 2012. . Professional wrestling career=Early career (1999‚Äì2002) Converse made his professional debut on January 23, 1999, wrestling a tag team match with Mr. X against Dr. Feelgood and Double Trouble at Winston-Salem's VFW Hall. He went on to wrestle for a number of local \\"indy\\" promotions during the first two years of his career: Alternative Championship Wrestling, Carolina Championship Wrestling Alliance, New Empire Wrestling, Ringside Championship Wrestling, Southern Wrestling Alliance, and the World Wrestling Alliance. He also had a brief stint in Count Grog's Southern Championship Wrestling. It was during this period that Converse developed a cocky \\"heel\\" in-ring persona, calling himself \\"Slick Ric\\" and \\"Slick Diddy\\", parodies of pro wrestler \\"The Nature Boy\\" Ric Flair and rapper P. Diddy respectively. His first major feud was with the Lumbee Warrior. Ten months into his rookie year he scored his first-ever victory by pinning the Warrior in July 1999. The two men eventually formed a tag team together, \\"Sudden Impact\\", which led to his first title victory on March 17, 2001 with an ECPW Tag Team title victory alongside his erstwhile rival. On September 7, 2001, he and Persephone teamed up a WWA show in Statesville, North Carolina to defeat Mikael Yamaha and Amber Holly in a mixed tag team match. The following summer, Converse had won the major single titles of three different promotions in a three-week period. He was named \\"Performer of the Year\\" (2002) by the pro wrestling website IndyInsiders.com that same year. FWA-Carolinas (2002‚Äì2004) Converse began wrestling for FWA-Carolinas, one of two US affiliates for the Frontier Wrestling Alliance, in early-2002 where he aligned himself with manager Brad Stutts' Hostile Youth Project (HYP) with GeeStar, Special K, and J.T. Sparxx. He and GeeStar specifically feuded with Mikael Yamaha and Amber Holly, then FWA Women's World Champion, both in FWA-Carolinas and other promotions. Their first match, on April 26, 2002 at Final Judgement in Graham, North Carolina, resulted in Converse pinning Yamaha after knocking him out with Holly's championship belt. At Spring Showdown on May 11, they were joined by J.T. Sparxx for a 6-man tag team match against The Gemini Kid, Mikael Yamaha, and Amber Holly. The match ended with a second victory for the HYP when Converse pinned Yamaha after Stutts hit his opponent with a briefcase. Converse followed this up by winning the FWA-Carolinas Cruiserweight Championship from Sexton Tyler on July 20 at Payback. A third and final mixed tag match took place at Explosive Elements on August 17, 2002, at A.L. Brown Middle School in Kannapolis, North Carolina which saw Sexton Tyler, Mikael Yamaha, and Amber Holly defeat Corey Edsel, Ric Converse, and GeeStar. The following year Converse appeared on the first episode of CWF Championship Wrestling where he lost his title to J-Money, ending his seven- month championship reign. He subsequently entered the heavyweight division and spent the next few months feuding with FWA-Carolinas Heavyweight Champion Corey Edsel who had previously left the HYP months earlier. The two finally met on August 9, 2003, in Wentworth, North Carolina. Outside interference from Brad Stutts unintentionally caused Converse to lose the match. Afterwards, Converse turned against Stutts and hit him with his finisher. He was the last of the original HYPmembers to leave the group. The Converse-Edsel feud continued throughout the year and, on December 27, 2003, Converse defeated Corey Edsel for the title at the FWA-Carolinas Anniversary Show. On January 17, 2004, he teamed with Shane West and Garry Stevens in a losing effort to Corey Edsel, Bounty Hunter, and Rob McBride. At the end of the month, Converse defeated both Edsel and ACW Heavyweight Champion Quinson Valentino to unify CWF and ACW titles. Converse was one of the wrestlers Valentino thanked upon his retirement four years later. Over the next four months, Converse successfully defended the title against Rob McBride, Bounty Hunter, Kid Justice, Trent Wylde, and Joey Silvia. He also took part in tag team matches. On March 6, he and Brad Rainz were beaten by Bounty Hunter and Otto Schwanz. He also teamed with Shane West and Garry Stevens to beat Brass Munkey, American Steel Ninja, and Corey Edsel on April 17. Converse was later awarded a new title belt by legendary announcer Bob Caudle which resembled the old NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. He also continued his rivalry with Edsel and lost to him in a non-title match on May 15. Their next meeting on July 10 ended in a double-countout. On August 28, he entered the 2004 Johnny Weaver Cup tournament in Thomasville, North Carolina and lost to Corey Edsel in the finals. Another match on September 15 ended in a time-limit draw. Converse finally lost the title to Corey Edsel on October 2. Converse was unable to regain the title from Edsel in subsequent rematches, however, he did win an impressive victory over David Flair on October 23. He formed a brief partnership with Trent Wylde and Brad Attitude at the end of the year joining them in one or two 6-man tag team bouts. On November 20, the three wrestled Orlo, Kid Justice, and Jesse Ortega. A week later, he and Trent Wylde lost a tag team match to J-Money and Will B. Smooth at an interpromotional SWA/CWF Mid-Atlantic show. On December 4, 2004, Converse and Wylde were defeated by Corey Edsel and Orlo. AWA Mid-Atlantic (2004‚Äì2006) On December 18, 2004, Converse regained the heavyweight championship from Edsel in Burlington, North Carolina. Earlier that year, the CWF had become the official AWA Superstars affiliate for the Mid-Atlantic United States and the title was renamed the AWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. His second reign as champion lasted over six months with wins over Xsiris, Brad Attitude, Otto Schwanz, The Gemini Kid, \\"Wild\\" Shane West, Jesse \\"El Fuego\\" Ortega, Donnie Dollars, and Mitch Conner. On May 21, 2005, Conner defeated Converse in a non-title match. A month later, he was also on the losing end of a 6-man tag team match with The $outh$ide Playas (J-Money and Will B. Smooth) (with Kiyia Moka) against Shane West, The Shadow, and Garry Stevens. Converse defended the title in a singles match against Stevens on June 24, which he won, but lost the title to him in a \\"King of the Road\\" match three weeks later at Friday Night Fights 2. Despite losing the title, Converse continued to be successful in the singles division defeating Bobby Ramone, Mitch Connor, and Julios Augustus during the summer. On August 19, he and Brad Attitude defeated Garry Stevens and Michael McAllister in a tag team match. The next night, however, he and The $outh$ide Playas lost a 6-man tag team match to Stevens, Mitch Conner, and The Shadow. Converse and Jesse Ortega defeated Garry Stevens and Super Spoiler in yet another tag match on September 10. A week later, he unsuccessfully challenged Steve Corino for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in a bout lasting nearly 40 minutes. Converse also made appearances in other companies during this time, Big Time Wrestling and Carolina Wrestling Association, with he and Brad Thomas defeating Beau James and Sheik of Araby on September 27 in the former promotion. On October 1, Converse won the 5th annual 30-man \\"CWF Rumble\\" to earn a title show for the championship of his choice. He and Chris Vega were the first two entrants and eliminated Alex Adonis (with GeeStar, Kamakazi Kid, and Xsiris), Donnie Dollars (with Rob McBride), Coco Rojo, Brad Attitude (with Marcellus King), and Marcellus King to win the event. He lasted a total of 36 minutes and 57 seconds setting a new record as the longest time in the CWF Rumble and, as of 2012, remains unbroken. The following month, he wrestled Shannon Moore at a November 5 CWF show in Burlington, North Carolina. He was also accompanied by Harley Race in his match against Jake Manning for a Carolina Wrestling Association show on November 17; he returned to the CWA a month later where he and Jesse Ortega lost a tag team match to Jake Manning and Jason Jones. On December 3, Converse teamed with Joey Silvia beat The Street Sweepers (Gregory Vercetti and Jay Sinn) in a Bounty match. Two weeks later, Converse defeated Garry Stevens in a \\"Winner Take All\\" Steel Cage match at BattleCade VI to regain the AWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. Due to the pre-match stipulations, Converse also received a title shot against then AWA World Heavyweight Champion Steve Corino. Corino lost the title to Shinjiro Otani only a week prior to their scheduled match, which saw Converse successfully retain the AWA Mid-Atlantic title. In early-2006, Converse formed a brief partnership with Joey Silva. On January 7, 2006, they defeated Alpha & Omega (Julius Augustus & Marcellus King). On February 4, they joined Xsiris in a 6-man tag team match to wrestle Marcellus King, Brandon Day, and Tony Kozina. A week later, he wrestled Johnny Blaze on a special \\"legends\\" show for Carolina Championship Wrestling at the sold-out Mulberry Rec Center in Lenoir, North Carolina also featuring Amber O'Neal, Krissy Vaine, The Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton), The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Robert Gibson and Ricky Morton), Total Protection (Curtis Hughes[Mr. Hughes and The Barbarian), Tom Prichard, Bob Armstrong, Brad Armstrong, George South, Ronnie Garvin, Tully Blanchard, and Dusty Rhodes. On February 18, Converse again teamed with Joey Silva and Xsiris to wrestle Alpha & Omega and Brandon Day which ended in a no-contest. Trent Wylde joined the match on the pretense of helping Converse after Silva was injured, bowing out at the last minute, and Xsiris became incapacitated. Silva later returned to ringside where he and Wylde turned on Converse. Wylde, who had previously been banned from the promotion, was reinstated by Commissioner William L. Cross at the request of Converse following the attack. Silva and Wylde subsequently formed \\"The New Dynasty\\" which was intended to mock the stable which Converse had founded. On a March 11 television taping for CWF Championship Wrestling, interference from Silva and Wylde cost Converse his match against Marcus King, losing via countout. On April 9, he defended his title in Pro-Wrestling WORLD-1 against Justin Smith. On April 22, he defeated Tracy Smothers at CWF's Carolina Sports Arena. The following week at Gate City Superclash in Greensboro, North Carolina, he faced Joey Silvia, Trent Wylde, and Steve Green in a 6-man tag team match with Xsiris and Jesse Ortega, which Converse's team lost. On May 13, a \\"best of four\\" team series was held between Team Dynasty (Joey Silva, Trent Wylde and Steve Greene) and Team Converse (Ric Converse, Jesse Ortega and Xsiris) at AC Fitness in Greensboro. Team Dynasty ended up winning the match series when Greene defeated Ric Converse in a no-submission, falls count anywhere \\"West Market Street Fight\\". This also allowed Greene to pick the opponent for Converse's next title defense. The opponent was revealed to be Converse's teammate Xsiris with their match ending in a no-contest. It was strongly hinted by The New Dynasty the Xsiris was their newest member, and while it appeared as though Xsiris was going to side with the group during their match, he ended up staying loyal to Converse. Afterwards, Converse challenged The New Dynasty to a 6-man tag match between members of the Original Dynasty versus Silva and Wyle's recent incarnation, which was accepted by his arch-rivals. The two teams met at CWF's Summer Action Series on June 10 which saw Converse, Xsiris, and Brad Attitude beat Steve Greene, Joey Silvia, and Trent Wylde. AWA Superstars (2006‚Äì2007) Converse (now dubbing himself \\"The 1st\\" Ric Converse) won the AWA World Heavyweight Championship when he defeated ZERO1 wrestler Takao Omori for the title in Indianapolis, Indiana on June 14, 2006. Converse achieved a near-7 month reign before finally being defeated by Steve Corino on January 7, 2007 including victories over WWE superstars John Heidenreich and Aaron Aguilera, and Ring of Honor's Ricky Landell. Meanwhile, in his home promotion, Converse continued feuding with The New Dynasty. At the August 5th Summer Action Series, the original Dynasty defeated Joey Silvia, Trent Wylde, and AWA World-1 Champion Ricky Landell. Less than a week later, Converse successfully defended the AWA World title against Aaron Aguilera at AWA Super Clash in Amite, Louisiana.\\"Results from AWA Superclash in Amite, Louisiana from Saturday night, August 12 in front of over 700 fans .\\" Declarationofindependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., Aug. 2007. Web. Jan. 27, 2012. . On August 21, Converse also defended his title at a CWF show against Otto Schwanz. In the fall of 2006, Converse toured the Mid-Atlantic defending the AWA World title against Ken Magnum in AWA Power Pro and Damian Wayne in NWA Virginia. On November 18, the Original Dynasty (Ric Converse, Brad Attitude and Xsiris) beat The New Dynasty (Joey Silvia, Steve Greene, and Jake Manning) (with Ty Dillenger) in Best 2-of-3 Falls match to win the rights to the Dynasty name. This match also saw the end of Converse's year-long feud with The New Dynasty, however, he did face Silvia once more in a singles match at BattleCade VII for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 30, 2006.\\"CWF MID-ATLANTIC TV TAPING THIS SATURDAY, DECEMBER 30th, IN BURLINGTON, NC FOR BATTLECADE VII!.\\" Declarationofindependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., Dec. 27, 2006. Web. Jan. 27, 2012. . One week after this match, Converse dropped the belt to Corino in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. Weeks earlier, Converse had interfered in an AWA World Tag Team Championship match between The Old School Blondes (Steve Corino and Ricky Landell) and AWA Mid-Atlantic Champions Tank Lawson and Rob McBride, counting the pinfall which awarded the belts to Lawson and McBride. Corino and Landell made an official complaint to the AWA Board of Directors, which was supported by Commissioner William L. Cross, and the belts were returned to their former owners.\\"Update on AWA World Tag Team Title Situation and upcoming anniversary event BattleCade VII.\\" Declarationofindependents.net. Ed. Sean McCaffrey. N.p., Dec. 13, 2006. Web. Jan. 27, 2012. . Three months after his world title loss Converse and Xsiris, as \\"The New Generation Dynasty\\", defeated Ricky Landell and Jonnie Stewart at AWA Power Pro Wrestling's \\"Night of Champions\\" for the AWA World Tag Team Championship at Union Pines High School in Cameron, North Carolina. Stewart was substituting for Landell's regular tag team partner Steve Corino who was touring Australia at the time. He and Xsiris successfully defended the titles in AWA Mid-Atlantic against Fatback Enterprises (Mitch Connor and Donnie Dollars) at Enter The Triad on April 14 and against Mitch Connor and Jesse Ortega in a non-title Texas Tornado match at a CWF-MAX! show a week later. At Cinco De Mayhem on May 5, Converse and Kamakazi Kid defeated AWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Champion Joey Silvia, AWA Mid-Atlantic Television Champion Steve Greene, and CWF Mid-Atlantic Commissioner Ty Dillinger in a 3-on-2 handicap match. Near the end of his tag team title reign Converse met Steve Corino, accompanied by C.W. Anderson, in a special grudge match at a show for UWF Wrestling in Greensboro, North Carolina. Converse and Xsiris were eventually stripped of the AWA World Tag Team titles which were returned to the former champions Ricky Landell and Jonnie Stewart in Indianapolis, Indiana on June 13. Converse and Xsiris were still billed as the champions when they appeared at CWF Mid-Atlantic's Absolute Justice three days later. In the main event, they wrestled The Neon Lions (Lee Valiant and Chris Collins), AWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Champion Joey Silvia and AWA Mid-Atlantic Television Champion Steve Greene, and AWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Champions Rob McBride and Tank Lawson in an \\"Everything To Lose\\" Four Corners tag team match. CWF Mid- Atlantic (2007‚Äì2010) A few weeks after losing the AWA World Tag Team title, AWA Superstars was forced to drop the CWF and other promotions as an AWA affiliate due to a court order. Converse remained with his home promotion, CWF Mid-Atlantic, where he resumed his feud with Joey Silvia. He wrestled Silvia for the CWF Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship at an August 11 CWF Championship Wrestling television taping defeating Silvia via disqualification; this was the first championship match to end in a DQ in over seven years. He followed this up with victories over Little J at the 2007 Johnny Weaver Cup tournament on August 25 and Corey Edsel at Sumner Civitan SuperClash on September 8. Despite the win over the legend, Converse still has a losing record against Edsel. Later that month, Destiny's manager Ty Dillinger \\"set up\\" Converse's brother Joseph for an attack by Silvia and Steve Greene resulting in a broken arm and an overnight stay in a local hospital. Two days after the attack, Converse \\"went berserk\\" at a TV taping for CWF Championship Wrestling interfering in a match between CWF Mid-Atlantic Rising Generation League Champion Roy Wilkins and \\"Jersey\\" Nick Richards, attacking both men with a steel chair, and knocking out the referee. He was eventually confronted by one-time rival Garry Stevens and the two agreed to join forces against Dynasty. Converse entered CWF Mid-Atlantic's \\"Lethal Lottery\\" in Greensboro a week later. Using rules similar to World Championship Wrestling's Battlebowl, the participants were chosen at random with the winning teams meeting in a 10-man \\"Battle Bowl Battle Royal\\" main event. Converse was paired with Steve Greene (with Ty Dillinger) and the two defeated Gemini Kid and Black Pegasus to advance to the battle royal. Greene later eliminated Converse to win the Battle Bowl and become the 30th entrant in the upcoming \\"CWF Rumble\\". Converse himself was the 24th entrant at the \\"CWF Rumble!\\" on October 6 and the third last participant to be eliminated. Afterwards, he and former CWF Mid-Atlantic Commissioner William L. Cross got into a brawl with Ty Dillinger and Destiny which had to be broken up by security. Converse and Cross later accepted a challenge from Dillinger to a \\"street fight\\" with Destiny at an upcoming show. At Date With Destiny on October 20, Team Cross (William L. Cross, Ric Converse and Garry Stevens) defeated Destiny (Ty Dillinger, Joey Silvia and Steve Greene) in a double pinfall with Stevens pinning Silvia for the CWF Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship and Cross pinning Ty Dillinger to regain his position as CWF Commissioner. Blamed for the loss, Silvia was attacked by his stablemates Steve Greene and The VIPs (Jesse Ortega and Gemini Kid) causing the breakup of Destiny. With the end of his feud with Destiny, Converse challenged newly crowned heavyweight champion Garry Stevens. Shortly after their victory at Date With Destiny, Converse was attacked by his former ally at an October 3 CWF Championship Wrestling television taping. At Ultimate Survivor IV on November 17, Converse and a mystery partner (revealed to be Dynasty's Brad Attitude) defeated Stevens and Steve Greene in a \\"Triathlon Survivor\\" Best 2-of-3 Falls tag team match. Converse regained the CWF Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship from Stevens in an Iron Man match at Battlecade VIII on December 15, 2007. At the end of the 60 min. time limit the score was tied (2‚Äì2) and went into overtime with Converse winning via submission when Stevens' daughter Brandi Richardson and Stevens cornerman Little Billy threw in the towel. After the match Stevens announced his retirement and shook hands with the new champion. On January 5, 2008, Converse pinned Rising Generation League Champion \\"Jersey\\" Nick Richards in a non-title match at New Year's Knockout. A few weeks later, he made his first title defense against CWF Mid-Atlantic Television Champion Steve Greene at A Cold Day in Hell on January 19, 2008. On February 2, Converse reunited with Xsiris to defeat CWF Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Champion Jesse Ortega and Marcellus King (with Sheik Lumpkin). Due to the pre-match stipulation, Xsiris and Kamakazi Kid won the right to challenge The VIPs for the tag team titles; the champions had previously stopped defefending the belts against US tag teams. At Civitans SuperBrawl II on April 19, Converse faced longtime friend Rob \\"Boogie Woogie Man\\" McBride. The following month, he joined McBride and Tank Lawson in a 6-Man Tag Team match against Gemini Kid, Jesse Ortega, and CWF Mid-Atlantic TV Champion Steve Greene at Six Man Vendetta on May 3. He also had successful title defenses against Evan Banks at Revelations and Matthew de Nero at Fallout!. It was at the latter event that Commissioner Cross, who had since \\"turned heel \\", confronted Converse demanding that he join his new \\"Aftermath\\" stable. Converse, supported by McBride and Brass Munkey, refused the offer causing Cross to make McBride his next opponent. Their match at Absolute Justice II saw McBride defeat Converse for the belt, however, a distraction by Cross and the Aftermath (in the form of a coded message on the Insiders-Tron) revealed was indeed the newest member of the Aftermath. On August 16, Converse entered the 2008 Johnny Weaver Memorial Cup tournament and lost in the finals to Brass Munkey in a Triple Threat match with Marcellus King. Over the summer he was also a guest on the Canadian internet radio show Tha O Show hosted by Big Daddy Donnie and Dan-e-o where he shared a somewhat risque road story during his early career. Converse (with Commissioner Cross and an unknown masked man) attempted to win the title back from McBride in the fall. He was unsuccessful at Sumner Civitans SuperBrawl III on September 6 but regained the belt in a \\"street fight challenge\\" at Fatback Rising! two weeks later. After a victory over Otto Schwanz at the 8th annual CWF Rumble!, Converse and stablemate Ryan O'Reilly briefly feuded with CWF Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Champions Xsiris and Mikael Yamaha. They lost to the tag team champions at CWF Mid-Atlantic's \\"200th Live Event Celebration\\" on November 1. With Soloman Spades, they also lost a best 2-of-3 falls 6-man tag team match to Xsiris, Yamaha, and Brass Munkey at Ultimate Survivor VI on November 15. Converse ended up losing the heavyweight title to Brass Munkey at BattleCade IX on December 20, 2008. Converse making his entrance in 2011 On January 3, 2009 at New Years Knockout, Alex Adonis interrupted an in-ring promo with Converse and William L. Cross to issue a challenge to the former champion. Adonis had been brought into the CWF by Converse several years earlier and pointed out that he was the only person on the active roster that Converse had never beaten. Converse responded by leading the Aftermath in a 4-on-1 attack on the young wrestler and leaving him unconscious in the ring. Two weeks later, he and O'Reilly again wrestled Xsiris and Mikael Yamaha for the CWF Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship at Night of Challenges but were unable to win the belts. He also faced former rivals Joey Silvia and Steve Greene in a tag team match with Marcellus King at End of an Era on February 7. At Fallout! on February 21, he pinned Cecil Scott. Nearly two months after New Years Knockout, Converse finally met Alex Adonis in a match at Don't Call It A Comeback! on March 7, which he won by pinfall. He and Marcellus King also defeated Adonis and Mitch Connor in a tag team match at Holding Out For A Hero! later that month. On April 4, Converse attempted to interfere in the Adonis-King match at Nowhere To Run! but was unable to prevent Adonis' victory. Afterwards Commissioner Garry Stevens ordered Converse to face Adonis, with The Kamakazi Kid as special guest referee, at the promotion's next show. Converse's match against Adonis at The Bunkhouse Stampede on April 25 ended in his defeat. On May 5, Converse defeated Chiva Kid by submission in a non-title match at Heartache Tonight. At the end of the month at Goodbye, Farewell & Amen Converse took part in a 10-man Farewell match with Steve Greene, Michael McAllister, and The VIPs (Gemini Kid and Jesse Ortega) wrestling Mikael Yamaha, Lee Valiant, Brass Munkey, Corey Edsel, and Amber O'Neal. At Absolute Justice III on June 20 Converse lost to Kamakazi Kid in a grudge match. He also entered the 2009 Johnny Weaver Memorial Cup tournament and made it to the finals in Burlington where he was eliminated by Kamakazi Kid on August 15. On September 9, Converse and King joined Joey Silvia, Steve Greene, and Ty Dillinger (with William L. Cross and Jaxson Dane) at Fatback Rising 2 to defeat CWF Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Champion Brass Munkey, Rob McBride, Kamakazi Kid, and The Neon Lions (Lee Valiant and Chris Collins) in a 10-man tag team match. Converse also defeated Tank Lawson at SuperBrawl IV on September 12 and teamed with Jaxson Dane to beat CWF Heavyweight Champion Brass Munkey and Kamakazi Kid in a tag team match at Unfinished Business a week later. At Ultimate Survivor VII, Converse was teamed with Xsiris, Alex Adonis, and Brass Munkey during the Incredible Pairs Wildcard Elimination match against Mikael Yamaha, Marcellus King, Jaxon Dane, and Kamakazi Kid. Converse's team won the match with he and Brass Munkey being the sole survivors. Converse was allowed a title shot at the heavyweight belt due to winning the event. On January 2, 2010, Converse lost a Three Way Dance with Brass Munkey and the Kamakazi Kid for the CWF Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship at Battlecade X. He also lost Brass Munkey at New Years Knockout on January 16 to decide the number-one contender for the CWF Championship. That summer, he won the 2010 Johnny Weaver Memorial Cup tournament defeating \\"High Definition\\" Steve Greene in the semi-finals and PWI International Ultra-J Crown Champion Xsiris in the finals on August 21, 2010. Recent years (2011‚Äì) On April 1, 2011, Converse was one of several CWF Mid- Atlantic stars to take part in an interpromotional show with Dragon Gate USA. He was originally scheduled to wrestle Shane \\"Hurricane\\" Helms in a qualifying match for the PWI International Heavyweight Championship, however, this was changed to an official title bout at the last minute, which Helms won. On August 20, he entered the 2011 Johnny Weaver Memorial Cup tournament but was eliminated by Arik Royal. At Ultimate Survivor IX on November 19, he was part of the semi-main event wrestling in a Wildcard Incredible Pairs 8-man elimination tag team match with Trevor Lee, \\"Arrogant\\" Aric Andrews, and Joe Black against CWF Mid Atlantic Heavyweight Champion Xsiris, Ben Tyler, Jason Miller, and Mikael Yamaha. Converse was the final man eliminated when he was pinned by Yamaha. On December 3, 2011, Converse (with William L.

She began exhibiting works in various galleries in Japan but has since settled in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. Her interest in Mexico came when she was seventeen, visiting the country two times to study culture and language before moving permanently in 2010. She has exhibited works in Mexico City, which include the painting of an old trolleybus in the Colonia Hip√≥dromo neighborhood and organizing an event called Pray for Japan in response to the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. Life Fumiko Nakashima was born in Iwate, Japan, near Miyako. As a child, she displayed interest in narrative drawing and children's literature. Her interest in Mexico came at age seventeen when she discovered a book about Mexico with illustrations at her parents‚Äô home in Iwate. She visited Mexico for the first time in 1999 studying the art of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera as well as that of the Huichol, leading to interest in other aspects of Mexican culture such as the commemorations of Day of the Dead . During her second visit in 2006, she decided to stay for almost two years to have contact with the culture and the art of Mexico as well as to learn Spanish. She states that it was not easy but she met many friends who helped her learn and adapt to life in Mexico. During this time, she exhibited at Garros Galer√≠a and the Japanese embassy in Mexico . She returned permanently to Mexico in 2010, as one of a number of Japanese artists who have found opportunities in the country such as Kenta Torii . She has since settled in Colonia Roma, due to its emerging art scene, associated with names such as Ludwig Margules, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Jos√© Vasconcelos, Carlos Fuentes and Remedios Varo, who the artist names as influences in her work. As a response to the massive earthquake in Japan, Nakashima organized Pray for Japan in July 2011, with Garros Galer√≠a and the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana member Celso Zubire at the CONACULTA gallery in Colonia Roma. The exhibition included other Japanese artists such as painters Yuro, Kenta Torii and Satoji Matoba, architect Kosque, photographer Yoshihiro Koitani and sculptor Teruaki Yamaguchi . Art Section of the trolleybus work \\"Double Life\\" One of Nakashima's works Her work is her own interpretation of Surrealism working mostly in watercolors . Her style is somewhat autobiographical with marked Mexican influence with references to Frida Kahlo and Remedios Varo. Sources of inspiration include stories, dreams, movies and images from her travels. They also include children's stories, and works by Japanese writer Kenji Miyazawa . Her first exhibition was a collection of watercolors called Fumikoten 1 at the Piglet Gallery in 2001, followed by Fumikoten 2 at the Hanjiro Gallery, and Fumikoten 3 at Fourth Floor, all in Japan. She exhibited Fumikoten 4 and Fumikoten 5 at the Garros Galler√≠a in 2006, with Fumikoten 4 also presented at the Japanese embassy in Mexico. She presented Fumikoten 6 at the Caf√© Flug in Tokyo, with Fumikoten 7 at Galer√≠a Garros in Mexico. In 2009, she had an exhibition called Happy un Birthday+ Fumiko Nakashima at the Niji Gallery with included works made with sugar as well as watercolors. In February 2012, Nakashima created a work called ‚ÄúDoble Vida‚Äù or ‚ÄúDouble Life‚Äù using one of the trolleybuses of Roma, Condesa and Hip√≥dromo, which were donated by the Japanese government to Mexico and since have been used for various art projects. Double Life was created to commemorate the one year anniversary of the Japan earthquake and tsunami, and was dedicated with a ceremony on March 11, 2012.

They are thought to be related to the living toothcombed primates, the lemurs and lorisoids (known as strepsirrhines), although paleoanthropologists such as Marc Godinot have argued that they may be early simians (monkeys and apes). It includes the genera Azibius and Algeripithecus, the latter of which was originally considered the oldest known simian, not a strepsirrhine. Originally described as a type of plesiadapiform (an extinct group of arboreal mammals considered to be a sister group to the primate clade), its fragmentary remains have been interpreted as a hyopsodontid (a type of extinct condylarth), an adapid (an extinct type of adapiform primate from Europe), and a macroscelidid (elephant shrews). Less fragmentary remains discovered between 2003 and 2009 demonstrated a close relationship between Azibius and Algeripithecus. Descriptions of the talus (ankle bone) in 2011 have helped to strengthen support for the strepsirrhine status of Azibius and Algeripithecus, which would indicate that the evolutionary history of lemurs and their kin is rooted in Africa. Likewise, if azibiids are simians, it would support the hypothesis that simians originated in Africa instead of Asia. Azibiids were small-bodied primates, with Algeripithecus minutus weighing between , Azibius trerki weighing approximately , and an unnamed species of Azibius being notably larger, weighing an estimated . Evolutionary history Although the taxonomy is disputed, morphological evidence suggests that azibiids were one of the earliest offshoots of the early primate lineage leading to living lemuriforms, which excluded other adapiform primates. According to Tabuce et al., the mandible of Algeripithecus indicates it had an inclined canine tooth, similar to that found in crown lemuriforms (extant strepsirrhines). Although the anterior dentition of azibiids is unknown, they may have possessed a toothcomb (a specialized dental structure found in lemuriforms), indicating an ancient stem lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa, possibly descended from an early Asian branch of adapiforms such as a primitive branch of cercamoniines predating Donrussellia (one of the oldest European adapiforms). However, the uncertainty about the presence or absence of a true toothcomb in azibiids makes it difficult to determine if they are stem or crown lemuriforms. According to Tabuce et al., Azibiids belong to an Afro‚ÄìArabian clade of stem lemuriform primates, including successive sister taxa such as djebelemurids (including Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri) and a group that includes Plesiopithecus and crown lemuriforms. However, if azibiids are simians, as originally suggested with Algeripithecus, then they demonstrate an ancient simian lineage and their evolutionary divergence on the continent of Africa, contrary to the competing view that simians first evolved in Asia. Taxonomy The first species, Azibius trerki, was originally described by Jean Sudre in 1975 as a possible 'paromomyiform' (a type of plesiadapiform, an extinct group of arboreal mammals considered to be a sister group to the primate clade), but was also interpreted as a hyopsodontid (a type of extinct condylarth) by paleoanthropologist Frederick S. Szalay that same year. The following year, paleoanthropologist Philip D. Gingerich reclassified it as an adapid (an extinct type of adapiform primate from Europe). Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, debates over its classification continued, with some researchers suggesting it might be related to macroscelidids (elephant shrews), while others supported initial interpretations as adapids or plesiadapiforms (particularly carpolestids). In 2006, paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot favored a relationship between Azibius and simians, but tentatively suggested Azibius may be more closely related to toothcombed primates, which include all extant strepsirrhines. This latter view has gained increasing support with the reclassification of Algeripithecus (once considered a basal simian) as a closely related azibiid. Additional fossil teeth and the maxilla (upper jaw) of both genera discovered between 2003 and 2009 helped demonstrate their relationship. Based on the same fossil finds, Tabelia‚Äîwhich was also considered to be one of the oldest known simians along with Algeripithecus‚Äîis also now considered to be a synonym of Azibius. Also, the third and fourth lower premolars (P3 and P4) distinguish azibiids from carpolestids, while the upper fourth premolar (P4) matches what was thought to be the second upper molar (M2) of Dralestes hammadaensis, another suspected plesiadapiform or genus of azibiid. Specimens of Dralestes are now recognized as being either Azibius and Algeripithecus, and Tabuce et al. claimed that Dralestes was a synonym of Azibius in 2009. However, in 2010, Godinot cautiously suggested that Dralestes may be a synonym of Algeripithecus based on a blade-like premolar. He also reasserted his view that Algeripithecus was a simian based on its upper molar morphology and hypothesized that this applied to all azibiids, favoring his earlier view that they may be early simians instead of stem lemuriforms. The argument for strepsirrhine affinities was strengthened in 2011 when Marivaux et al. published an interpretation of recently discovered talus bones found at Gour Lazib, which they claimed were more similar to those of living strepsirrhines and extinct adapiforms, not simians. The tali morphology also differed radically from those of plesiadapiforms, confirming that azibiids are true primates. Anatomy and physiology All known azibiids were small-bodied primates. The body mass of Algeripithecus minutus was estimated between , equivalent in size to a hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus trichotis) or the brown mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus). Azibius trerki was estimated to weigh between , comparable in size to a gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). An unnamed species, cf. Azibius sp., was larger, weighing between , making it similar in size to sportive lemurs (Lepilemur). Distribution Both Azibius and Algeripithecus have only been found in the Glib Zegdou Formation of the Gour Lazib area in Algeria. The Glib Zegdou Formation dates to the late early or early middle Eocene. Two upper molars found in Chambi, Tunisia, which were originally associated with Djebelemur martinezi (another suspected stem lemuriform), may instead represent another primate more closely related to Algeripithecus.

Returning to Philadelphia, he prevented the seizure of the cargo of gunpowder by British blockaders at the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet on June 29, 1776.

Engraving by John Sartain Military charter On March 1, 1776, Robert Morris of the Pennsylvania Committee of Safety chartered the newly built Nancy and Captain Hugh Montgomery to transport gunpowder and arms for the revolution. Later in March, Captain Montgomery sailed to Puerto Rico to purchase arms and ammunition. In early June, the crew loaded additional supplies in the Caribbean islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix. First American flag in a foreign port While at St. Thomas, Captain Montgomery received news that independence had been declared. An American flag was created by ensign Thomas Mendenhall and flown to replace the British one. That is, according to Elizabeth Montgomery, the captain's daughter, and Thomas C. Mendenhall, by family tradition. Her book includes a mezzotint engraving by John Sartain that shows Nancy flying an American flag with a circle of ten stars surrounding three central stars. Turtle Gut Inlet Late on the afternoon of June 28, spotted Nancy sailing toward Cape May and began chase, followed by . Captain John Barry on ordered longboats, led by Lieutenant Richard Wickes, set out to assist Nancy. In the early hours of June 29, pursued by the British Orpheus and Kingfisher and blocked from entering the Delaware Bay, Captain Montgomery sailed Nancy for nearby Turtle Gut Inlet in a heavy fog. She soon ran aground at the inlet, while the larger British ships were kept to deeper waters. Although still out of range but sailing closer, the British shelled Nancy, while the Americans attempted to salvage the cargo, especially the gunpowder kegs. Barry organized the crews into two operations. One group returned cannon fire to keep the British from boarding. The other transferred the cargo onto longboats and rowed to shore where local residents helped unload and secure it behind the dunes. By late in the morning of June 29, 265 to 286 kegs of gunpowder had been removed, and the British bombardment had heavily damaged Nancy. Barry ordered the main sail wrapped around 50 pounds of gunpowder to create a long fuse running from the nearly 100 gunpowder kegs remaining in the hold to the deck and over the side. The fuse was lit as the crew abandoned ship, while one last sailor climbed the mast to remove the American flag. The British thought the lowering of the flag was a sign of surrender and quickly boarded Nancy. By then the fuse had reached the hold. The gunpowder exploded with a huge blast felt for miles which killed many British. Captain Alexander Graeme reported the loss of his master's mate and six men on longboats from the Kingfisher.

History=Early history MCRH was founded by Priscilla Chism in 1974 just after the US Supreme Court's historic Roe v Wade decision. The clinic was originally located in a building across the street from the Greyhound bus terminal in downtown Memphis. Many patients who came for services came from small towns throughout the Mid South by bus. within 18 months a foundation loan allowed it to move to a remodeled former private home in Mid Town. It was the first women's clinic in the Mid South, opening in January 1975. In the early years following the Roe v. Wade decision there was prominent public support for the provision of quality abortion services. It was viewed even in Tennessee as a matter of women's public health, and the staff of the center included graduate students, several on internships, from the University of Tennessee Center for the Health Sciences, the University of Memphis, and Rhodes College. MCRH had a very prominent profile in the community, with an advisory committee of eminent leaders, professors, and officials. Priscilla Chism developed a wide variety of public events and innovative programs, with official endorsement of the City of Memphis and the center was not controversial, nor did it experience picketing until years later, when anti choice forces emerged and organized. The center was very actively called on by the media and had extensive speaking engagements and a high profile at public schools and universities on a wide variety of topics related to women's health and sexuality. The most prominent program it developed beyond its core medical services, which were often staffed by ob gyn residents from UTCHS, and which had prominent local gynecologists as medical directors, was the Memphis Sexual Assault Resources Center (now MSARC). This pioneered nationally the creation of the role of the SANE , Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner, whose role included on call 24/7 services for victims of sexual assault, crisis counseling, prophylactic care to avoid pregnancy and STDs, expert collection of forensic evidence, ready expert testimony in prosecutions, and ongoing counseling. Priscilla Chism and Brenda A. Brown of the Memphis Police Department conceptualized and co authored, with the endorsement of Mayor Chandler and Gen. Jay Hubbard, Chief of Police, a grant which gained funding through DHEW, and its services continue to this day. In its first year of services the rates of cases dropped for lack of prosecution declined by a whopping 60 percent. The funding was obtained with the help of Senator Howard Baker, and the support of many prominent Memphians. Post-2010 In May 2010, Choices received a $150,000 grant from the MAC AIDS Fund, and expanded its services and moved to a new and more prominent location on Poplar Avenue in Memphis.

DMA is the C17Œ± acetate ester of delmadinone, which, in contrast to DMA, was never marketed for medical use. Uses=Veterinary DMA is used to treat androgen-dependent conditions in animals. It is most commonly used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, it can also be used to treat hypersexuality in male dogs and cats, perianal gland tumors in dogs, and hormone-driven aggression in dogs. Pharmacology=Pharmacodynamics DMA is a progestogen with antigonadotropic and hence antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic effects. In addition, DMA binds to the androgen receptor, and likely acts as an antagonist of this receptor similarly to related drugs like chlormadinone acetate and osaterone acetate. Chemistry DMA, also known as 1-dehydrochlormadinone acetate, as well as 1,6-didehydro-6-chloro-17Œ±-acetoxyprogesterone or '6-chloro-17Œ±-hydroxypregna-1,4,6-triene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone with a chlorine atom at the C6 position, a double bond between the C1 and C2 positions, another double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17Œ± position. Analogues of DMA include other 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and osaterone acetate. History DMA was first described in the literature in 1959 and has been marketed since at least 1972. It was marketed by this year in Europe and the United Kingdom under the brand names Tardak and Zenadrex. It was under development for use in the United States as well but does not seem to have ultimately been marketed in this country. Society and culture=Generic names Delmadinone acetate is the generic name of the drug and its and . Delmadinone is the and of the unesterified free alcohol form. Brand names DMA is most commonly sold as Tardak, but has also been marketed under a variety of other brand names including Delmate, Estrex, Tardastren, Tardastrex, Vetadinon, and Zenadrex. Availability DMA is available in Europe and Oceania. It is specifically marketed in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Finland, Australia, and New Zealand.

Browning became the first left- handed pitcher to pitch a perfect game since Sandy Koufax's perfect game in 1965. Background Browning was in his fifth season in MLB, having made his debut in September 1984 with the Reds. Through the end of the 1987 season, he had a career record of 45‚Äì35 with a 3.95 ERA. Coming into his September 16, 1988, start at home against the Dodgers, he had a season record of 15‚Äì5 with 3.56 ERA in 32 starts. His most recent start had been an eight-inning no decision five days earlier, also against the Dodgers, in a road game at Dodger Stadium. The Reds nearly had a perfect game earlier in the season, as starting pitcher Ron Robinson retired the first 26 Montreal Expos he faced at home on May 2, 1988. With two outs in the top of the ninth inning, pinch hitter Wallace Johnson singled to left field on a full count, breaking up the bid. Tim Raines then homered, narrowing the Reds' lead to 3‚Äì2. Relief pitcher John Franco then got Johnny Paredes to ground out for the final out. Browning had a bid for a no-hitter broken up earlier in the season. On June 6, 1988, against the San Diego Padres at Jack Murphy Stadium, Browning took a no-hitter into the ninth inning. Tony Gwynn singled with one out; it was the only hit Browning allowed in defeating the Padres, 12‚Äì0. Entering the September 16 game, the Dodgers had an 84‚Äì60 record, while the Reds were at 76‚Äì69. It was the first game of a three-game series between the teams. A ticket from Browning's perfect game The game The game took place at Riverfront Stadium. A two-hour, 27 minute rain delay forced the game to start at approximately 10 PM local time. The rain delay lasted longer than the game itself, played in a brisk one hour, 51 minutes. The game's lone run came with two outs in the bottom of the sixth inning. Batting against Dodger starter Tim Belcher, himself working on a no-hitter, Reds shortstop Barry Larkin doubled and advanced to third on Chris Sabo's infield single; an error by Dodger third baseman Jeff Hamilton on the play enabled Larkin to score. In the top of the seventh inning, Dodger left fielder Kirk Gibson was ejected by home plate umpire Jim Quick after striking out. In the top of ninth inning, Browning first got Rick Dempsey to fly out to right field. Steve Sax then grounded out to the shortstop. Facing pinch hitter Tracy Woodson, Browning recorded his seventh strikeout of the evening, completing the perfect game. Browning threw 70 of his 102 pitches for strikes, and did not run the count to three balls on a single Dodger hitter. Later developments The Dodgers would go on to win the 1988 World Series‚Äîthe only time, to date, that a team has won a World Series after having a perfect game pitched against it during the season. Only one other team has since earned a postseason berth after having a perfect game pitched against it during the season: the 2010 Tampa Bay Rays, who were on the losing end of Dallas Braden's perfect game on May 9, went on to win the American League East title. Not until Sean Manaea of the Oakland Athletics no- hit the eventual World Champion Boston Red Sox on April 21, 2018, would a no- hitter again be pitched against a team that would go on to win that year's World Series. Browning's perfect game was the first of a record three that Paul O'Neill would play in as a member of the winning team. With the New York Yankees, he would be on the winning end of David Wells' and David Cone's in 1998 and 1999, respectively. On July 4, 1989, Browning narrowly missed becoming the first pitcher to throw two perfect games. Against the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium, Browning retired the first 24 batters he faced. Dickie Thon then broke up the bid with a ninth-inning leadoff double. After striking out Steve Lake, Browning gave up a single to Steve Jeltz, scoring Thon. John Franco then relieved Browning and got Len Dykstra to hit into a game-ending double play, giving the Reds a 2‚Äì1 win. Browning pitched for the Reds through 1994, and finished his career with the 1995 Kansas City Royals. His MLB totals include an overall record of 123‚Äì90, 3.94 ERA, and exactly 1,000 strikeouts in 1,921 innings pitched.

During the 18-minute filmed encounter, Eugene accused Poppo of stealing his Bible, beat him unconscious, removed Poppo's pants, and bit off most of Poppo's face above the beard (including his left eye), leaving him blind in both eyes. As a result of the incident's shocking nature and subsequent worldwide media coverage, Eugene came to be dubbed the \\"Miami Zombie\\" and the \\"Causeway Cannibal\\". The attack ended when Eugene was fatally shot by a Miami PD officer. Although friends and family filled in details of Eugene's life, the reason for the attack remains unclear. Eugene, 31, employed at a car wash at the time, was a divorced former high school football player with a series of petty criminal arrests from age 16, with the last in 2009. While police sources speculated that the use of a street drug like \\"bath salts\\" might have been a factor, experts expressed doubt, since toxicology reports were only able to identify marijuana in Eugene's system, leaving the ultimate cause of his behavior unknown. Poppo, 65, a graduate of Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School, was homeless and had long been presumed dead by his estranged family.  Attack  On the morning of May 26, 2012, 31-year-old Rudy Eugene drove to Miami Beach, Florida, to Urban Beach Week. His Haitian-flag-draped purple Chevrolet Caprice became disabled along the way. After spending 30‚Äì40 minutes at the site, as filmed on security video in and around the car, he abandoned it about noon, and began to cross the span of the MacArthur Causeway, stripping himself of his clothing and disposing of his driver's license as he advanced westward, according to eyewitnesses. His vehicle was eventually discovered and towed by Miami Beach police. Inside the car, police discovered a Bible and five empty water bottles, which they believed had been recently consumed. Eugene‚Äîwho eventually became completely naked, discarding even his shoes and his Bible at the crime scene‚Äîencountered 65-year-old Ronald Poppo at approximately 1:55 pm. Poppo had been lying underneath the elevated Metromover people mover viaduct when Eugene began to pummel him, strip him of his pants, and bite his face. The attack unfolded at the west end of the MacArthur Causeway, near the headquarters of The Miami Herald in the Arts & Entertainment District neighborhood of Downtown Miami. It was at first believed that neither Eugene nor Poppo knew the other before their encounter, until a July 2012 publication revealed that Eugene had met Poppo while working for the homeless community of Miami. A passing cyclist, Larry Vega, came upon the scene and alerted authorities via 9-1-1. A few minutes later, Miami Police Department officer Jose Ramirez arrived and, after doing a double take at the spectacle, warned Eugene to desist from attacking Poppo. Eugene ignored the officer's warnings and, instead, reportedly growled at him, then resumed biting his victim. The attack ended at 2:13 pm with Officer Ramirez shooting Eugene once at first, which proved ineffective, and then another four times. The ordeal was captured by a security camera on The Miami Herald building. Post by: CNN news blog editor Mallory Simon, CNN's Adriana Hauser, CNN's Brad Lendon Surveillance video shows that the attack continued for 18 minutes before help arrived.  Aftermath  Poppo was admitted to Jackson Memorial Hospital in critical condition, with 75‚Äì80% of his face above the beard missing and his left eye gouged out. He underwent facial reconstruction surgeries that took months to complete, but he remained permanently disfigured and blind. To help with the costs, a fund was set up and has collected $100,700 since July 17, 2012. Poppo spoke to police, whom he thanked for saving his life, on July 19, explaining that Eugene, whom he hardly knew, approached him in a friendly manner but then, complaining he couldn't \\"score\\" at the beach and \\"souped up on something\\", started to talk about how they were going to die, accused Poppo of stealing his Bible, and, suddenly and without provocation, attacked and strangled him with wrestling holds, and then \\"plucked out\\" both his eyes. Poppo lost his eyebrows, his nose, parts of his forehead and cheek, and his left eye, and was left totally blind due to the damage to his remaining right eye. He underwent numerous surgeries to repair the damage to his face. After rehabilitation, he put on 50 pounds, and relearned how to dress, feed himself, shower, and shave. He was granted permission to stay at the medical facility indefinitely.  Inconclusive toxicology investigation  Although the autopsy revealed no human flesh in Eugene's stomach, a number of undigested pills were discovered that have not been identified. Although police sources had speculated that the street drug \\"bath salts\\" might have been involved, preliminary toxicology reports were positive only for the presence of cannabis. Authorities did not necessarily find the negative results conclusive; Broward County Sheriff Al Lamberti expressed a belief that some new drug not yet tested for played a role; nationally noted toxicologist Barry Logan said Eugene's behavior was consistent with \\"bath salts\\" and that toxicologists \\"are not testing for everything that may be out there\\"; and the director of toxicology at the University of Florida, Dr. Bruce Goldberger, said, \\"We are not incompetent... We have the tools, we have the sophistication and know-how. But the field is evolving so rapidly it is hard for us to keep track. It's almost as if it is a race we can never win.\\"  Perpetrator  Rudy Eugene (February 4, 1981 ‚Äì May 26, 2012) was born at the Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida. He was of Nigerian descent through his immigrant parents, who divorced months after his birth. Eugene never made contact with his father, who died when he was six. As a child he attended the Bethel Evangelical Baptist Church with his families on most Sundays. Eugene attended North Miami Beach High School in the 10th and 11th grades, and he played on its football team in the late 1990s. At the age of 17, he transferred to North Miami High School. After graduating, Eugene acquired money from such sources as selling CDs and jobs at McDonald's and in telemarketing. His last known employment was washing cars at a local automobile dealership. Eugene had expressed interest in establishing his own mobile car wash business. Eugene's marriage, from 2005 to 2008, ended in divorce, with his wife reporting that there had been domestic violence in the relationship. The divorce was granted on January 8, 2008, and there were no children from their relationship. Eugene was estranged from his ex-wife until his death.WPLG Miami‚ÄìFt. Lauderdale \\"New video of face-eating attack released, Victim identified as 65-year-old Ronald Poppo\\" Terrell Forney, tforney@Local10.com Published On: May 29, 2012 10:43:57 AM EDT Updated On: May 30, 2012 12:53:16 PM EDT  Criminal history  Eugene had been arrested eight times since he was 16, with the first arrest being for an assault in 1997. On February 25, 2004, Eugene broke a table, smashed items around the house, and pushed his mother out of the kitchen. Afterward, his mother told officers that he had said, \\"I'll put a gun to your head and kill you.\\" This crime led to his serving probation for resisting an officer without violence. The remaining charges were mainly related to marijuana, which he had expressed a desire to quit. His final arrest was in September 2009.  Victim  Ronald Edward Poppo (born May 17, 1947) was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Manhattan's prestigious Stuyvesant High School, where he was a member of the Latin Club and worked in the guidance office. A former classmate reported that, after high school, Poppo enrolled at nearby City College but he dropped out in late 1966. Poppo would become homeless in early 1976. On May 24, 2012, two days before the attack, workers from the Miami Homeless Assistance Program discovered him and offered him the services of the Miami- Dade County Homeless Trust. Poppo declined assistance, however. At the time of the attack, Poppo's family‚Äîincluding his daughter‚Äîhad not heard from him in over 30 years. During that time, they assumed that Poppo was dead and suspected that he had killed himself. They were shocked to learn he was still alive at the time of the incident. Poppo has since completed treatment and was last residing in a Medicaid facility. He received nutritional and occupational therapy and took up the guitar.

Isaac D√≠az Pardo was the son of the painter and scenographer Camilo D√≠az Bali√±o. Several reunions related to the League of Friends of the Galician Language took place in their house as D√≠az Bali√±o was an active member. Other members who took part in these meetings include Castelao, Vicente Risco, Otero Pedrayo, Ram√≥n Cabanillas, Ant√≥n Villar Ponte, Eduardo Blanco Amor and Asorey. Sr. D√≠az Pardo's father was shot by rebels soon after the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, forcing him into hiding in La Coru√±a where he stayed with his uncle Indalecio and found work as a letterer. After the war he received a bursary from the Provincial Government of La Coru√±a, thanks to which he was able to study at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando in Madrid, between 1939 and 1942. He went on to take a professorship at The Catalan Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Saint George in Barcelona, and began to exhibit in Spain (La Coru√±a, Madrid and Vigo) and abroad (Europe and The Americas). He then left the plastic arts for ceramics, founding the Cer√°micas do Castro factory with several partners. At this point he experimented with the raw materials used in original 19th Century works by Antonio Raimundo Ib√°√±ez Llano y Vald√©s (notably from Sargadelos and Cervo). This resulted in ceramics of high quality. In 1963 Isaac D√≠az Pardo, alongside other prominent Galeguistas such as Luis Seoane, helped establish the experimental porcelain factory \\"Porcelanas de Magdalena\\", also known as Laboratorio de Formas. The factory was located in the village of Magdalena, Buenos Aires. This pioneering-venture was a precursor in several industrial and cultural activities, including the production and restoration of Sargadelos ceramics. Among their collaborators were Cer√°micas do Castro (1963), el Museo Carlos Maside (1970), la editorial Edici√≥s do Castro (1963), el restaurado Seminario de Estudos Galegos (1970) and el Instituto Galego de Informaci√≥n. Sr. D√≠az Pardo, formerly a prominent figure at Grupo Sargadelos, failed increasingly to see eye to eye with the directors and company administration at the moment of his retirement. As an essay writer and critic, Sr. D√≠az Pardo made notable contributions to Xente do meu Rueiro, O √°ngulo de pedra, Galicia Hoy (with Luis Seoane), Paco Pixi√±as (with Celso Emilio Ferreiro), El Marqu√©s de Sargadelos, and Castelao.

It was first released for Android in July 2010, followed by an iOS release in September 2014 after Apple allowed third-party keyboard support. SwiftKey learns from previous typed text and outputs predictions based on currently inputted text and what it has learned.  History  The company behind SwiftKey was founded in 2008 by Jon Reynolds, Ben Medlock and Chris Hill-Scott. Its head office is at the Microsoft offices in Paddington, London, and other offices are located in San Francisco, US, and Seoul, South Korea. In September 2013, SwiftKey announced a series B finance round totaling $17.5 million and led by Index Ventures along with Octopus Investments and Accel Partners. In May 2014, SwiftKey hired James Bromley as COO. In February 2016, SwiftKey was purchased by Microsoft, for $250 million. Overview The Prediction Engine used allows SwiftKey to learn from usage and improve predictions. This feature allows the tool to improve with usage, learning from SMS, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, and an RSS feed. Beta SwiftKey was first released as a beta in the Android Market on 14 July 2010, supporting seven languages. It included a variety of settings to adjust audio feedback volume and length of haptic feedback vibration. It was announced on SwiftKey's official website on 15 May 2014, that a Japanese version was out in beta. People registered on SwiftKey VIP were able to download the beta version. SwiftKey X On 14 July 2011, SwiftKey X was released to the Android Market as an upgrade to SwiftKey. Along with new and updated features, SwiftKey X introduced a dedicated app for tablets, called SwiftKey Tablet X. The updates included: * a new artificial intelligence engine, to predict phrases and learn the user's writing style * a cloud-based personalization service, which analyzes how the user types in Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, and text messages, to predict phrases in the user's style * a technology that continually monitors the user's typing precision and adapts the touch- sensitive area of the touch screen for each key * simultaneous use of multiple languages; this allows users to type in up to three languages at once, with auto-correction that is language-aware * split key layout on SwiftKey Tablet X, to improve thumb typing while using a larger touchscreen * additional language support SwiftKey 3 The SwiftKey 3 update was released on 21 June 2012, including: * Smart Space ‚Äì this detects spurious or missing spaces in real time * additional language support SwiftKey 4 The SwiftKey 4 update was released on 20 February 2013, including: * SwiftKey Flow ‚Äì a gesture input method with real-time predictions * Flow Through Space ‚Äì a gesture to input whole sentences, by gliding to the spacebar * an enhanced prediction engine * additional language support, raising the total to 60 * SwiftKey 4.2 introduced SwiftKey Cloud, allowing users to backup and sync their language behavior and software settings, plus Trending Phrases ‚Äì a feature adding the phrases causing a buzz on Twitter and localized news sites SwiftKey 5 The SwiftKey 5 update was released in June 2014, including: * Freemium transition ‚Äì the app dropped its price-tag to be free to download * SwiftKey Store ‚Äì Theme store of free and paid-for color schemes for the app * Emoji ‚Äì 800 emoji were added, plus Emoji Prediction feature, which learns to predict relevant emoji icons * Number Row (a row of number keys) option added, in response to customer requests * New languages, including Belarusian, Mongolian, Tatar, Uzbek and Welsh added SwiftKey 6 The SwiftKey 6 update was released in November 2015, including: * Double-Word Prediction which adds a new dimension to the predictions you see, predicting your next two words at once. * A redesign of the emoji panel. * A complete overhaul of the settings menu in the style of Material Design to make it easier to fine tune and customize the keyboard * 5 new languages added: Yoruba, Igbo, Zulu, Xhosa & Breton SwiftKey 7.0 The SwiftKey 7.0 update was released in March 2018, including: * A new Toolbar * The ability for one to use their own stickers directly within the software. * Support for 28 additional languages. SwiftKey for iOS Swiftkey released an iOS application on 30 January 2014, called Swiftkey Note, that incorporates its predictive typing technology as a custom toolbar attached to the top of the regular iOS keyboard. Starting with iOS 8, released in the second half of 2014, the operating system enables and support third party keyboards use. SwiftKey confirmed that it was working on a keyboard replacement app. Starting with iOS 13, the system keyboard comes with a built in QuickPath mechanism. Working the same say as SwiftKey. SwiftKey for iPhone SwiftKey Keyboard for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch launched in September 2014 to coincide with the launch of Apple's iOS8 update. It was unveiled at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco. The app includes the word prediction and autocorrection features, familiar to the Android product, SwiftKey Cloud backup and sync and personalization, and a choice of color themes. It reached No. 1 in the free US App Store charts and the company confirmed it had been downloaded more than 1 million times on the first day of launch.  Further development  On 27 February 2012, the SwiftKey SDK was launched. This allows developers on multiple platforms and programming languages to access SwiftKey's core language-engine technology for their own UI or virtual keyboard. In June 2012, SwiftKey released a specialized version of its keyboard called SwiftKey Healthcare. It is a virtual keyboard for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry devices that offers next-word predictions based on real-world clinical data. In October 2012, SwiftKey Healthcare won the Appsters Award for Best Enterprise App 2012. In April 2016, SwiftKey released a keyboard that emulated William Shakespeare's speech called ShakeSpeak celebrating the 400th year of the author's death. The app was co- developed with VisitLondon.com to promote more tourism to the metropolitan area of London. Microsoft released SwiftKey for Windows 10 along with Windows 10 October 2018 Update. In May 2020, the app was rebranded as Microsoft SwiftKey to reflect its present ownership.  Controversy  In 2015, NowSecure reported SwiftKey Keyboard vulnerability exclusive for pre-installed version in Samsung devices, the issue occurred when the keyboard attempts to update its language pack. Samsung has since released security and firmware update to mitigate the issue. However, TechCrunch published an article on why the issue happened because of how Samsung implemented the keyboard system on its devices. In 2016, SwiftKey users began reporting personal details given by SwiftKey as suggested words to other users whom does not have previous connections, other issue includes foreign language and obscene words. SwiftKey responded by disabling cloud sync for word suggestion and released an update to mitigate the issue.

Protosteloid amoebae, also called protostelids, are amoebae that are capable of making simple fruiting bodies consisting of a cellular stalk topped by one or a few spores. All species are microscopic and are typically found on dead plant matter where they consume bacteria, yeasts, and fungal spores. Since protostelids are amoebae that make spores they are considered to be slime molds. Ecology Protosteloid amoebae are typically found on dead plant matter, including stems and leaves of herbaceous plants, stems and leaves of grasses, bark of living trees, decaying wood and other types of dead plant matter. Protosteloid amoebae are found on dead plant matter that has fallen on the ground, on dead plant parts that are still hanging in the air and on dead parts of plants that are submerged in a pond. They have also been detected on the petals of living flowers and on living tree leaves. Since protosteloid amoebae eat bacteria, yeasts, and fungal spores in the laboratory, it is thought that they also do this in nature. They are thus thought to be predators in the decomposer community. Distribution Collections of protostelids have been made from all continents, including the Antarctic peninsula. Protostelids have also been found on isolated islands like Hawaii in the Pacific and Ascension Island in the southern Atlantic, indicating that protostelids have a worldwide distribution. Most studies of protostelid distribution have been done in the temperate zones so they are best known from these areas. However, tropical studies have turned up protostelids, often in great abundance. Collection and laboratory culture Since protosteloid amoebae are microscopic one must bring their substrates, dead plant matter, into the laboratory to find them. Dead plant matter is placed on the agar surface in a petri plate and allowed to incubate for several days to a week. Then the edges of the substrates are scanned with a compound microscope and species are identified by their fruiting body morphology and amoebal morphology. When protosteloid fruiting bodies are found they can be moved into laboratory culture onto an appropriate food organism or mix of organisms. This is done by picking up fruiting bodies or spores with a sterilised needle and moving them onto agar in a fresh petri plate that has been smeared with a bacterium or yeast upon which the protosteloid amoeba species has been known to grow. If the spores germinate then the protostelid begins eating the food organism and a culture is established. Taxonomy and relationships The formal taxonomy of protosteloid amoebae groups them all according to fruiting bodies, mostly leaving out characteristics of the amoebae. Recent studies have shown that all protosteloid amoebae studied to date are probably included in the group known as Amoebozoa or Eumycetozoa. However, protosteloid amoebae are not all closely related and some fall within groups of amoebae in which the other amoebae are nonfruiting. Therefore, it appears that the ability to make fruiting bodies may have evolved more than once.

Signature of Alexander Graham  Biography  Graham appears in the records of Scotland as the Earl of Menteith in 1493. Likely the grandson of Malise Graham, it is of some debate whether this Earl Alexander was the son of Patrick Graham (Earl Malise's second son) or was the son of Alexander Graham (Earl Malise's first son who died in 1471). Most evidence seems to show that Patrick Graham was the likely father. Prior to 1493 and after the death of Earl Malise Graham in 1490, he is referenced, but at that time he is only referenced as heir. During the 15th century in Scotland, one was often termed an heir when the age of majority had not been reached. It is therefore likely that Alexander Graham, this second earl, was born around 1475. Robbers from the Clan Gregor in the year 1533 stole 40 cows from him and his son William, Master of Menteith. He married Margaret Buchanan, daughter of Walter Buchanan of the Clan Buchanan, and had two sons and a daughter. He died between the 31st of January 1536 and the 27th of February, in 1537.

It was self-released in the UK on June 25, 2012, and received a wider release from Sony Music Sweden on the same date. The EP was highly anticipated worldwide, receiving rave reviews from music bloggers. History Collecting Sunlight - EP came when following break up's with each of their long term girlfriends, Andreas Moe and best friend Micael Paavilainen (videographer and creator of most of Moe's videos to date) moved together to the small Swedish town of Saltsjobaden in Winter 2011. Moe recalls it as a time of 'darkness, heartbreak and hibernation'--and reveals that it was only then that he found himself ready to channel his personal experiences into his music. Having tried for years previous--it was only through heartbreak and solitude that Moe truly felt that he was beginning to develop 'his sound'. He admits that it was a painful process, and states that to explore his experiences while they were still so raw meant involving three writers and friends that he held close to his heart--Hiten Bharadia, Niclas Lundin and Maria Marcus. The foursome spent just two weeks writing and producing intensively--the result of which were the bare bones of The Collecting Sunlight EP. Moe describes the final product as 'a true souvenir of his journey back to self'--and the sound as a fusion of electronic and organic sounds. The record was released on June 25, 2012. Track listingReception So far, the Collecting Sunlight EP has been received well worldwide, with several popular online blogs posting reviews and articles about the forthcoming release. Most notable perhaps, is famous US blogger Arjan Writes, who wrote '\\"Moe simply makes enchanting, emotionally honest pop music that is positioned right on the intersection of happiness and heartbreak.\\" Other fans of Moe's include So So Gay, who posted a glowing introduction article teamed with a free download of song 'Volcanoes' in May 2012, as well as other popular music sites such as SBTV, LinkUpTV, Dropout UK, Music Is My Kingsize Bed, Rukkle and I Am Music TV.

The college closed in August 2015. History Hackney UTC was the first UTC to be established in London, and opened in September 2012 in new dedicated buildings at the main campus of Hackney College. The UTC has an initial intake of students aged 14 (academic year 10) in 2012, but expanded to accommodate students aged 14 to 19 over the following years. In January 2014 Hackney UTC received its first Ofsted section 5 inspection which judged the school as \\"Requires Improvement\\" across all four key indicators: Achievement of Pupils, Quality of Teaching, Behaviour/Safety of Pupils and Leadership and Management. A \\"Grade 3\\" school requiring improvement is not yet a good school. Ofsted goes on stating that such a school will receive another full inspection within 24 months of the last inspection. In July 2014 it was announced that Hackney UTC would not receive new students and would close fully in 2015. The reason for closure was that the school received only 29 applications for September 2014 out of a target of 75. The University Technical College is now closed and has ceased to exist as an independent entity. Curriculum Hackney UTC specialised in health technologies and digital technologies, and aimed to train local children for employment in the Silicon Roundabout area of East London, working in partnership with local technology firms and educational institutions. Pupils aged 14 to 16 followed a course of 60% general education (GCSEs) and 40% specialisms. For sixth form students, this split reversed to 40% general education and 60% specialisms.

It is also a former music venue and hosts comedy events. History The Camden Head on Camden High Street is a public house and live venue which first opened towards the end of the 19th century, and has undergone several name changes: it was briefly known as \\"Liberties\\" for a period of a few years, before changing back to its former name, Camden Head, which is listed as a registered public house as far back as 1869 - run by then-publican George Soole. Nowadays, it is known for its local pub atmosphere and comedy venue, which has seen comedians such as Alan Carr, Stephen Merchant, Lee Kern and Bob Mortimer perform. It is not to be confused with The Camden Head in Islington, which is situated on Camden Passage. Architecture The Camden Head's architecture has changed little since its establishment in the 19th century, and testament to that exists in the form of a photo, dated 1903, which shows the building's appearance and similarity to that of the modern-day building. A copy of this photo can be found hanging in The Camden Head pub itself, and is archived at the Camden Local Studies and Archives Centre Cataloguehttp://adlib.camden.gov.uk Camden Local Studies & Archives centre catalogue Notable events The Camden Head was an official venue of the yearly festival Camden Crawl.

At first deeply shy, he responds by wearing extra clothes. After meeting Antoinette, a playful girl, Leo slowly becomes more relaxed and is revealed as a responsible and gentle person. He gets to know Antoinette better throughout the film and the discovery of his body, as well as the first feelings of love take on the appearance of a fairy tale with a hallucinogenic quality.

The organization was founded March 2011 by Vancouver businessman Wayne Crookes as a way to help restore accountability and integrity to BC politics. The organization is currently lobbying for electoral finance reform at the provincial level as well as working to empower British Columbians at the political level. Overview Integrity British Columbia is a non-partisan organization in Victoria, British Columbia. It was founded in 2011 by Vancouver businessman Wayne Crookes, who was also the campaign manager for the Green Party of Canada in 2004. The organization's founding executive director is Dermod Travis who served as the executive director of the Canada Tibet Committee from 2007 to 2011 and communications director for the Green Party from 2004 to 2006. He also operates PIRA Communications. Integrity British Columbia's primary goal is to \\"help restore a bond built on trust and confidence between citizens and their elected officials\\". For example, IntegrityBC has interviewed BC political party leaders, including the NDP's Adrian Dix, Conservative party leader John Cummins, the Green party leader Jane Sterk and Independent MLA Bob Simpson with questions taken directly from the organization's Facebook page and from people on the street. IntegrityBC issues news releases and also recommends news article that pertain to the topics of the day. Their website includes a resource section with relevant court judgments (like the BC Boss Power case and third-party advertising limits) and studies on election finance reform, and public opinion surveys. Current campaigns IntegrityBC is currently fighting for electoral finance reform. They want to ban corporate and union funding for BC political parties, cap personal donations and establish a citizen's assembly to make binding recommendations on a host of other reforms regarding how political parties are financed and operate. Their argument stems from a series of comparisons between BC and other Canadian provinces. Currently all provinces (except for BC, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador) have some form of restrictions. These may include the prohibition of corporate and union donations, a limit on personal or corporate donations, prohibition of non-Canadian donations or out of province donations. Not only that but corporations and unions cannot contribute at the federal level, yet in BC they account for over 60% of the BC Liberals income. Resource centre As a way of informing its citizens about British Columbia's provincial government IntegrityBC has created a resource centre for everyone to use. Some of the topics include information on the HST, the Boss Power Scandal, and Heed vs. Chief Electoral Officer.

They are thought to be related to the living toothcombed primates, the lemurs and lorisoids (known as strepsirrhines), although paleoanthropologists such as Marc Godinot have argued that they may be early simians (monkeys and apes). Originally described as a type of plesiadapiform (an extinct group of arboreal mammals considered to be a sister group to the primate clade), its fragmentary remains have been interpreted as a hyopsodontid (a type of extinct condylarth), an adapid (an extinct type of adapiform primate from Europe), and a macroscelidid (elephant shrews). Less fragmentary remains discovered between 2003 and 2009 demonstrated a close relationship between Azibius and Algeripithecus, a fossil primate once thought to be the oldest known simian. Descriptions of the talus (ankle bone) in 2011 have helped to strengthen support for the strepsirrhine status of Azibius and Algeripithecus, which would indicate that the evolutionary history of lemurs and their kin is rooted in Africa. Azibius trerki is the only named species, although a few teeth and a talus (ankle bone) of a larger, unnamed species (cf. Azibius sp.) have also been found. A. trerki is estimated to have weighed , while cf. Azibius sp. was larger, weighing approximately . Based on the fragmentary fossils, both are thought to have been nocturnal and agile arboreal quadrupeds. Evolutionary history and taxonomy For years following its discovery, Azibius was difficult to classify. Originally described by Jean Sudre in 1975 as a possible 'paromomyiform' (a type of plesiadapiform), A. trerki was also interpreted as a hyopsodontid by paleoanthropologist Frederick S. Szalay that same year. The following year, paleoanthropologist Philip D. Gingerich reclassified it as an adapid. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, debates over its classification continued, with some researchers suggesting it might be related to macroscelidids (elephant shrews), while others supported initial interpretations as adapids or plesiadapiforms (particularly carpolestids). In 2006, paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot favored a relationship between Azibius and simians, but tentatively suggested Azibius may be more closely related to toothcombed primates, which include all extant strepsirrhines. This latter view has gained increasing support with the reclassification of Algeripithecus (once considered a basal simian) as a closely related azibiid. The mandible of Algeripithecus indicates it had an inclined canine tooth, similar to that found in toothcombed primates. Although the anterior dentition of azibiids is unknown, they may have possessed a toothcomb, indicating an ancient stem lineage of lemuriform primates in Africa, possibly descended from an early Asian branch of adapiforms such as a primitive branch of cercamoniines predating Donrussellia (one of the oldest European adapiforms). Tabelia hammadae, which was also considered to be one of the oldest known simians along with Algeripithecus, was shown to be a synonym of Azibius when more complete fossils were discovered at Gour Lazib between 2003 and 2009. Likewise, the second upper molar (M2) of Dralestes hammadaensis have been reinterpreted as being the upper fourth premolar (P4) of Azibius and has been considered a synonym. However, in 2010, Godinot cautiously suggested that Dralestes may be a synonym of Algeripithecus based on a blade-like premolar. He also reasserted his view that Algeripithecus was a simian based on its upper molar morphology and hypothesized that this applied to all azibiids, favoring his earlier view that they may be early simians instead of stem lemuriforms. In 2011, Marivaux et al. published an interpretation of recently discovered talus bones found at Gour Lazib, which they claimed were more similar to those of living strepsirrhines and extinct adapiforms, not simians, thus reinforcing the strepsirrhine status favored by Tabuce et al. two years earlier. The tali morphology also differed radically from those of plesiadapiforms, confirming that azibiids are true primates. Remains of a second, unnamed species of Azibius, cf. Azibius sp., have been discovered in the HGL-50 layer at Gour Lazib. It is known for a few upper and lower teeth. These teeth are three times larger than those of A. trerki. A larger right talus has also been found, and is assumed to belong to this new species. Anatomy and physiology All known azibiids were small-bodied primates. A. trerki is estimated to have weighed between , nearly twice the weight of the only other named azibiid, Algeripithecus, and was comparable in size to a gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). The unnamed species, cf. Azibius sp., is estimated to have weighed and been comparable in size to a sportive lemur (Lepilemur). Azibius also had a short rostrum and very large orbits. Distribution Azibius has only been found in the Glib Zegdou Formation of the Gour Lazib area in southwest Algeria. The Glib Zegdou Formation dates to the late early or early middle Eocene, particularly the late Ypresian or early Lutetian. Behavior Judging from the properties of its talus, Azibius was probably an arboreal quadruped, capable of leaping and climbing in trees, very similar to living cheirogaleid lemurs. Based on what can be inferred from the maxillary remains, Azibius is thought to have had large eyes and extra vibrissae, which suggests it was nocturnal.

It competed in World Gliding Championships (WGC) between 1956 and 1968 and was placed fourth in 1956; it also set new triangular-course world speed records. Design and development The Meteor was designed by the same duo, Boris Cijan and Stanko Obad, who had produced the Orao glider which had achieved third place in the 1950 WGC. They were aided by Miho Mazovec and generously funded by the Yugoslav government. The result was \\"... without doubt the most advanced sailplane of its time.\\" In 1955 almost all gliders had wooden structures, with perhaps a few unstressed GRP parts; in contrast the Meteor was all-metal, with a large, 20 m (65 ft 7 in) span and an aspect ratio of 25, values beyond the reach of wood. The optimum glide ratio of greater than 40:1 was good, but the high inter-thermal glide speed was exceptional. The Meteor was one of a group of mid-1950s gliders to use the NACA 6 series laminar flow airfoil first adopted by the Ross-Johnson RJ-5, which required careful attention to profile control and surface finish. In plan the wings are straight tapered with unswept leading edges and forward sweep on the trailing edge. The wing tips carries small, elongated bodies termed \\"salmons\\" to dampen tip vortices, as on the slightly earlier Br√©guet Mouette and has a constant 2¬∞ of dihedral. Completely metal- skinned, the wing is built around a box spar within which the thickened skin is internally stiffened with span-wise stringers. The whole trailing edge carries control surfaces; the outer quarter with conventional ailerons, and the rest roughly equally divided between narrower inboard ailerons which droop together when the final inboard section of camber changing flaps are depressed through as much as 20¬∞ for low speed flight. These flaps can be raised by 11¬∞, reducing the camber for high speed flight. Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes are fitted at mid-chord, just aft of the box spar at about one third span. The Meteor has a pod-and-boom style fuselage, with a long, single-piece canopy above the upper fuselage line, forward of the wing, under which the pilot sits in a reclined position. The under-wing, retractable monowheel undercarriage is assisted by a short, retractable, forward skid. Retraction is manual; there is a wheel brake. Behind the wing the fuselage has a circular cross-section. There is a long, shallow fillet or sub fin between fuselage and fin, both straight edged, and both rudder and fin extend well below the lower fuselage line to form a tail bumper. The rudder is horn balanced. Later revisions slightly increased rudder area. The high aspect ratio, straight tapered tailplane is mounted above the fuselage on the fillet forward of the fin's leading edge. The elevators are also aerodynamically balanced and originally carried a ground adjustable trim tab, later removed. Operational history The Meteor was competitively long lived; its first WGC was in 1956 and its last in 1968. During that time glider construction moved decisively from wood to composites, but the open class metal Meteor was not out-classed. It was fourth in 1956 and 1958, fifth in 1965 and competed again in 1968, though only placed 27th. In 1958 the Meteor established two new international closed circuit speed records over 100 km and 300 km. Meteor 57 appears on the Croatian civil register in 2010. Meteor 60 YU-4103 is under reconstruction at the Museum of Aviation (Belgrade) in Serbia but is not on public display.

Custodio Custodio is the surname by marriage. (born 1953) is a former United States Air Force officer who became the first female Hispanic U.S. military pilot. She was the first Hispanic woman to complete U.S. Air Force military pilot training. Upon retiring from the military, she became one of the first female Hispanic commercial airline captains. Early years Custodio was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her father, a sergeant in the United States Army, was often stationed in various countries where the United States has its military installations. Custodio and the rest of the family would accompany him on his overseas assignments. Custodio began her primary education in Taiwan. She also attended schools in New Jersey, Iran and Paraguay. The family returned to Puerto Rico when she was 15 years old. She graduated high school at age 16, and was immediately accepted into the University of Puerto Rico. Custodio's father, and all the traveling she did at a young age, were key factors in her choice of career - she decided to join the military. While in college she attempted to join the university‚Äôs ROTC (Reserve Officer Training Corps), but at the time only men were admitted into the program. Military career A USAF T-38A Talon from 560th Flying Training Squadron, Randolph Air Force Base Texas Custodio earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Puerto Rico and worked for various industries before landing a job in the accounting department of Prinair (Puerto Rico International Airlines). There she met Edwin Custodio, with whom she would eventually have two children. She later worked for the US Department of Defense (DoD) in Panama. With the support of her husband, she presented herself before Headquarters, Air Force Military Personnel Center (AFMPC) to apply for the United States Air Force Officer Training School. Upon admission, Custodio was accepted as a pilot candidate to become a United States Air Force pilot. She entered the Flight Screening Pilot Officer Training School in January 1980. After successful completion of Flight Screening she entered Officer Training School and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. She qualified for Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas and graduated the following year, thus becoming the first Latina to complete the U.S. Air Force military pilot training. Her first military assignment was that of instructor pilot at Laughlin AFB. She was the first female to become a Northrop T-38 Talon (T-38) UPT flight instructor at that base. The T-38 Talon is the Air Force‚Äôs two-seat, supersonic jet trainer. On one occasion a bird struck the engine of her plane in bad weather while she was in flight. She was able to overcome the emergency and safely land her plane. Because of this she was recognized by the Air Force, and awarded the HQ AETC Aviation Safety Award for superior airmanship. Custodio was later assigned to Randolph Air Force Base where she was also the first female T-38 Instructor Pilot. During her career she also served as Pilot Instructor Training; T-41 Flight Screening - Operations Officer and Check Pilot. Custodio retired from the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant colonel in October 2003, after serving in the military for 23 years and 10 months. Her last assignment as an Air Force Reserve officer was that of accountability and readiness the Directorate of Personnel, HQ USAF. Commercial airline captain Boeing 767-300ER, one of the many types of American Airline aircraft flown by Custodio In June 1988, while she was serving in the US Air Force Reserve, she was hired by American Airlines as a commercial pilot. Custodio became one of the first Latina commercial airline captains. During her years with American, she flew various types of aircraft. She piloted the Boeing 727, Fokker 100, Boeing 757 and Boeing 767 to various countries in Europe, the Caribbean, Central America and South America. She also flew to Mexico, Canada and to various cities in the United States. Custodio retired from American Airlines in February 2008, with over 11,000 flight hours. Later years Custodio retired from the military after 24 years of service and lives in San Antonio, Texas, with her husband. There she founded \\"Dragonfly Productions LLC,\\" a production company that creates personal film documentaries. In 1992, she founded the Ballet Folklorico Borik√®n, the Puerto Rican folk ballet. Custodio is a Trustee of the Order of Daedalians Foundation, a Board Member and Treasurer for the Women in Aviation Alamo City Chapter and Board Member for the Dee Howard Foundation. Custodio also serves as vice president of the Hispanic Association of Aviation and Aerospace Professionals (HAAAP). These organizations inspire young students in the San Antonio and surrounding areas to seek civilian and military aviation careers. They hosts students to tour various airplanes and control towers and also speak to students in all grades to present career opportunities in aviation and aerospace. Memberships Among the many associations in which Custodio is a member are the following: *Charter member of the Women Military Aviators Association *The Women in Aviation, International, Inc. *Order of Daedalians *The Allied Pilots Association.

It was stablished in 2008. This inter-regional co-operative effort has been shaped and justified both by the economic potential of a reinforced co-work of nearby northern Portuguese and Galician industrial core cities as well as by the historical, cultural and ethnolinguistic past that both territories traditionally shared and whose idiosyncrasy survived, although somewhat diluted, until our times. These common economic, political, cultural and societal ties can be traced back at least to the late Bronze Age, before the Romanization of northwestern Iberia and when the Castro Culture evidenced a common identity and heritage in this geographical area. With the Romanization of these societies, their shared identity has been somewhat reflected and respected through the geo-culturally explained extension of the Roman province of Gallaecia. These far west populations tepidly and very gradually adapted to the manners and modus vivendi of the Romans, in what some historians considered to be a pacific co- habitation of different social realities. The lack of severe conflicts between the two different identities assured a relatively suitable cultural transition to the Middle Ages. After the dissolution of the Western Roman Empire, multiple geopolitical and strategical decisions impacted on one way or another in the organic continuation of this geographical and cultural region, although never as definitive as to break their historical attachment. It was during the Early and High Middle Ages that successive kingdoms, all of them related to the northwestern Christian Kingdoms that evolved during the early stages of the Reconquista, replaced one another depending on the location of the kingdom's seat, although both the North of Portugal and Galicia remained united and eventually formed the Kingdom of Galicia. Similarly, Galicia and the north of Portugal remained a cultural and social fairly well defined continuum. However, by the 9th century the political unity of both territories already started to fade out when the title of count was given to the nobleman V√≠mara Peres by Alfonso III of Asturias after his successful campaign in the reconquest of Portus Cale (Porto). This landmark turned out decisive for the political fragmentation of both territories, leading to the formation of the County of Portugal. Although originally conceived as a vassalage of the Kingdoms of Asturias, Galicia and Le√≥n, by the late 11th century it was reestablished after an increase of its counts power and finally recognized as an independent kingdom by the Kingdom of Le√≥n. Aside of this political division of interests, it was during this time period that the Galician- Portuguese language became a reality and subsequently evidenced the common cultural and linguistic heritage that both kingdoms still shared. Their vernacular language became one of the most important lyrical and literary languages of Europe and was taken in great regard by the neighboring Castilian royal court. Among the conjointly claimed literary production written on any of both sides of the Minho River there is the Cantigas de Santa Maria, the Mart√≠n Codax's Pergaminho Vindel or the Cancioneiro da Ajuda. The immersion into the Late Middle Ages signified a progressive historical and cultural deviance between the two territories that couldn't help but increase their geopolitical divergences during the Modern Period. Nevertheless, and despite the territorial expansion of Portugal up to the Algarve, located in the southwestern corner of the Iberian peninsula, both Galicia and the north of Portugal remained closely related from a sociocultural and bioclimatic point of view. Similarly, the Portuguese cities of Porto and Braga, two of the most populated and Ancient urban areas of Portugal, are located quite close to the Galician nearby cities of Vigo and Pontevedra and in a certain way they represent as well a continuation of the moderate south-north conurbation that leads up to the medieval pilgrimage destiny and quintessentially Galician city of Santiago de Compostela. The tepid industrialization of both regions during the 19th and early 20th centuries led to the prevalence of the long lasting dissemination of the rural populations, specially high in Galicia by Spanish standards. This resemblance, a somewhat unique, singular and common trademark of these two regions, has been attempted to be explained by authors of both sides of the Minho River; Galician politician and writer Alfonso Daniel Rodr√≠guez Castelao in his essay book Sempre en Galiza traced this trend back to the Celts idiosyncratic inclination towards Nature, as the already mentioned Castro Culture is considered by some authors to be the local development of Ancient Celtic tribes that settled along the Atlantic regions of northwestern Iberia. Castelao also believed to have found a direct translation and bounding of these pre-Roman settlements with the Christian northwestern parroquias, the traditional political and religious territorial configuration of these very disseminated populations. In an illustrative attempt to clarify this reality, two early to mid 20th century photographers serve as witnesses of the resemblance of these regions; on one side, Amarante- born photographer Eduardo Teixeira Pinto captured the distinctive character of the northern Portuguese people and their particular contextual environments, as American Ruth Matilda Anderson did twenty years before with the Galician homologues. By the late 20th and early 21st centuries the industrial and economic improvements of both Portugal and Spain and their membership into the European Union, have led to an increasing exchange of services and benefits between them as with the rest of the union members. In the particular case of Galicia and the north of Portugal, their prevalent social ties and cultural resemblance along with the demand for a mutual and strengthen infrastructure and city-based economy is demanding better transport services and connections between neighboring cities like Vigo or Porto as well as many other agreements of very diverse nature: cultural and educational exchanges, bilateral political strategies or ethnogastronomic accords among others. The Euroregion domain that conjoin both the North of Portugal and Galicia attempts to reinforce these desired achievements.

Asian American health disparities have only gained focus in the past 10 years, with policy initiatives geared towards promoting healthcare access to Asian Americans rising to prominence even later. Asian Americans are defined as Americans of Asian ancestry and constitute nearly 5% of American's population as of 2003, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Yet, the Asian American population can hardly be described as homogenous. The term applies to members of over 25 groups that have been classified as a single group because of similar appearances, cultural values, and common ethnic backgrounds. The Asian Americans commonly studied have been limited primarily to individuals of Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Japanese, Korean, Lao, Mien, or Vietnamese descent.  Health disparities  Asian Americans are a heterogeneous group. The racial class is composed of many different ethnicities and cultures. In addition to country of origin, individuals can differ in socioeconomic status, education level, immigration status, level of acculturation, and English proficiency. In general, ethnic groups have their own health disparities. Vietnamese and Filipino Americans tend to have poorer health outcomes compared with Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans. Self- rated health was lowest in Vietnamese Americans, while Filipino Americans have the highest rates of chronic diseases, including asthma, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Filipinos are also an ethnic group that is a risk factor for premature births and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or \\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\"). Koreans exhibit the highest psychological stress out of all ethnic groups. Thus, to classify and generalize health disparities to such a heterogeneous group may not be beneficial; however, a few health statistics can still be gleaned from general trends. Genetic inherited disorders and diseases (e.g. colorblindness, hemophilia) were reported to be uncommon in all Asian ethnic groups.  Cardiovascular disease  Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading killers in all ethnic groups and a major contributor to disability among older adults. The incidence of heart disease is known to increase with age and the majority of deaths from Coronary Artery Disease occur in people ages 65 years and older. While the rates of death from cardiovascular disease are lower for Asian Americans relative to other ethnic groups, they are still diagnosed with hypertension and heart disease. Cardiovascular Disease and associated risk factors among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, obesity, and Diabetes Mellitus. According to American Heart Association in 2016, around 19.5% of Asian Americans have high blood pressure. In 2013, 18,819 deaths among Asians and Pacific Islanders were due to Cardiovascular Disease; 8,477 due to Chronic Heart Disease; and 2,616 due to Myocardial Infarction. Cancer, the second leading cause of death, contributed to 21.3% in 2017. The prevalence of coronary heart disease among Asian Americans is estimated to be around 4.9%. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death for all Americans, and continues to disproportionally affect the Asian Americans who are disadvantageous in society due to various social determinants. These social determinants leading to health disparity include but not limit to lack of language proficiency, health illiteracy due to lower education attainment, racial discrimination, economic instability and poor community engagement. According to the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparity (NIMHD) sponsored lecture about Health Disparity Research in Diverse Asian American Populations in 2016, 70% of foreign born Asian Americans were identified as having limited English proficiency, dissimilar cultural beliefs and behaviors, as well as unfamiliarity with the Western health care system and difficulty following instructions at the doctor‚Äôs office. Addressing the health disparities requires significant awareness, comprehension, and consideration for the growing diversity of Asian population, especially for the foreign born older Asian Americans. Understanding the impact of social determinants on heath equity is crucial to health care professionals and policy makers to reduce health disparities and improve the health equality among Asian Americans and the underserved populations.  Diabetes  With the adaptation of American culture, immigrant populations can be seen to have increased risks of diseases as Western diets are being introduced into their daily food consumptions. However, there is a heightened risk of type 2 diabetes amongst Asian Americans as its presence makes up 21% of the Asian American population, twice as high as non-Hispanic whites.https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=3&lvlid;=63 Due to various genetic and environmental factors, Asian Americans are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than other racial and ethnic groups, even though their body mass index (BMI) tends to be lower. Asian Americans have a higher percentage of body fat for their BMIs which in turn elevates the risk of type 2 diabetes when BMI levels are lowered; they in fact may have a higher percentage of body fat which contributes to a greater risk of developing diabetes and other health concerns that are commonly overseen. Because of their BMIs, which are usually lower than other racial and ethnic groups, there is a common misconception that they are not at much of a risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The World Health Organization, however, has suggested a lower BMI cutoff point in order to properly diagnose obesity for Asian Americans because of such low BMI levels. Though it is expected that as there is a higher risk of type 2 diabetes within the Asian American population that much research is being done to screen for diabetes efficiently, the rate of not diagnosing type 2 diabetes for Asian Americans is three times as high as non- Hispanic whites. More than one in three people with diabetes are undiagnosed from improper screening, and this is particularly high for Asian Americans and Hispanics. A possible reason for why this may be the case is because Asian Americans are not aware of their elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes and therefore refrain from screenings. Having no access to health insurance or lack of utilization of health care due to language barriers as Asian immigrants may also contribute to the lack of screenings and increased likelihoods of undiagnosed type two diabetes. Research on language barriers showed differences in diagnoses of diabetes for Asian Americans and Hispanics particularly compared to whites in America as clinicians are lacking physician-patient communication. Another possibility is that the existence of the \\"model minority myth\\" prevents physicians from recognizing that such an elevated risk exists in Asian Americans, along with other common health issues. Based on these possibilities, Chinese and Korean Americans are also less likely than other Asian American subgroups to take part in self- management practices for their diabetes while Asian Americans as a whole are not given the physician-led management resources to treat diabetes like other racial groups. In 2015, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) changed its guidelines for testing for diabetes for all Asian American adults who have a BMI of 23 or more instead of 25., which launched campaigns like \\"Screen at 23\\". Older Asian Americans have increased odds of diabetes or hypertension that still needs to be addressed.  Hepatitis B  Hepatitis B is especially prevalent amongst Asian Americans. A study conducted between 2001 and 2006 that provided hepatitis B virus screenings to 3163 Asian Americans found that 8.9% of the population was chronically infected. Notably, 65.4% of those who were infected were unaware of their condition. Men were more likely to be infected than women, and hepatitis B infections were 19.4 times more likely in foreign born Asian Americans than in those born in the United States. Hepatitis B is one of the leading causes of the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cirrhosis and liver cancer are often interconnected, and having cirrhosis may heighten the risk in development of liver cancer. Additionally, incidences of liver cancer amongst Asian Americans are 2 to 11 times higher than that of White Americans, depending on gender and ethnic group.  Cancer  For Asian Americans, the leading cause of death is cancer, a factor unique to their racial/ethnic group. For every other racial/ethnic category, heart disease is the leading cause of death. Asian Americans exhibit the highest rates of cancers of the liver, cervix, and stomach. Additionally, Asian Americans have the highest rate of cancer for age categories 25-44 and 45-64 while it is just 45-64 for White people. The cancer burden that affects Asian Americans is unusual because of the nature of the cancers. Those with higher rates in Asian American populations are of infectious origin, such as human papillomavirus leading to cervical cancer, hepatitis B virus leading to liver cancer, and Helicobacter pylori- induced stomach cancer. As more and more Asians immigrate to the United States, they adapt American customs, a phenomenon known as acculturation. This transition in lifestyles is associated with cancers attributed to dietary changes and sedentary living. There is an increase in colon and rectal cancer in Asian Americans due to dietary changes. This may be attributed to the increase in consumption of red meat, which is consumed less in Asia than in America. This manifests itself in the Asian American population in the San Francisco Bay area, where colorectal cancer rates are higher compared with rates of cancer in mainland China. Additionally, Asians born and raised in the United States experience a greater risk of getting breast cancer. Asian American women who reside in the United States for more than 10 years have an 80% greater risk for breast cancer compared with more recent immigrants from Asia. Breast cancer is not the only cancer where this can be seen. Asian Americans also have high rates of cervical cancer. Specifically, Vietnamese women have the greatest incidence of cervical cancer, more than five times that of non-Hispanic white females. High rates of smoking also contribute to high rates of lung cancer. Lung cancer rates for Southeast Asians are 18 percent higher than for White Americans. 28.9% of all Asian Americans smoked at one point in their lives. Current rates of smoking stand at 14.8%. Smokers are more likely males (22.6%) than females (7.3%). However, high smoking prevalence is concentrated around certain areas. For example, Vietnamese men in Franklin County, Ohio, were found to have a smoking rate of 43.4%.  Mental health  The number of epidemiological and population- based studies focused on Asian American mental health is limited. Mental health problems can be measured using symptom scales rather than DSM criteria, which requires both symptoms and intensity and duration of symptoms for a more accurate diagnosis. Considerable evidence from studies that utilize varying methodologies have found that immigrant Asians and Asian Americans experience significantly high levels of distress that are consistent with depression, PTSD, and anxiety. There have been two main large-scale studies of mental health- the National Comorbidity Study (NCS) and the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study. Both investigated the prevalence of DSM-III and DSM-IIIR mental disorders among Asian Americans and found that there was a low prevalence in psychiatric disorders compared to European Americans. However, these studies only sampled English-speaking Asian Americans and did not have large sample sizes, so they are not necessarily representative of the Asian American population. The Chinese American Psychiatric Epidemiological Study (CAPES) was the first large-scale study to examine the incidence of DSM-IIIR psychiatric disorders among primarily Chinese American immigrants. It found that 6.9% of the participants reported having major depression during their lifetime, compared with the 17.1% prevalence in Americans in the NCS study and 4.9% in the ECA study. The statistics on mental disorders in Asian American populations may be lower than the actual incidence. Mental illness is highly stigmatized in many Asian cultures, so symptoms are likely underreported. Asian Americans thus express more somatic symptoms than their European American counterparts when under mental or emotional distress. An example of this is hwabyeong or ‚Äúsuppressed anger syndrome‚Äù in Korean culture. This is considered a culture-bound syndrome, as it is only manifested in Korean populations. The syndrome describes a range of psychosomatic symptoms including headache, anxiety, insomnia, heat sensation, and indigestion that arises from familial stressors like infidelity, in-law conflict, and oppressive patriarchal family structure. An inability to express frustrations due to cultural expectations of family harmony leads to a buildup of emotions and the resulting psychosomatic symptoms. Because of this kind of cultural variation in mental disorders and expression of symptoms, lack of health care access, and an underutilization of mental health resources, researchers have difficulty obtaining accurate statistics about Asian American mental health. Some of the key factors that affect mental health in Asian Americans include acculturation, language barriers among parents and children, and intergenerational conflict. Acculturation describes the physical and psychological changes that occur when two cultures meet and encompasses the changes that occur when immigrants and refugees assimilate into a new culture. Immigration to a country with a vastly different culture can be considered a stressful life event that leads to culture shock, migration shock, and acculturative stress. Frequently diagnosed disorders in recent immigrants include depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and schizophrenia, though the rate of incidence of mental health problems decreases with increased assimilation and time in a new country. Refugees from Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia and Laos also experience high rates of PTSD from war traumas and resettlement stressors. Varying English proficiency among immigrant Asian parents can be a source of conflict between parents and children. One study shows that in immigrant Chinese families, the level of English proficiency in the parental generation correlates with indicators of child and adolescent psychological well-being. Another factor that contributes to intergenerational conflict is differing cultural values between the host society and the parents. This serves as a source of stress and psychological duress for American adolescents, as they are socialized into the host culture while still expected to maintain their parents‚Äô heritage.  Mental Health Among Older Adult Asian Americans  In 2003, the Asian American Federation of New York presented a research study in which demonstrated that there are health disparities in mental health problems among older Asian Americans. It presented that the suicide rate among Asian Americans 65 years and older is double than other older ethical group. Additionally, the estimated older Asian American in USA in 2018 is 4.5% of 65 years and over. Asian Americans are experiencing higher rate of Depression comparing with the general elderly population in USA and one of the leading causes of death in USA for older Asian Americans are suicide.The study also depicted that having numbers of depressive symptoms among older Asian Americans or their mental healths are significantly associated with their general physical health, physical and social functioning and vitality. It is recommended by the study that our community should meet older Asian Americans‚Äô needs of culturally and linguistically proper Social services and mental health agencies   Drug use  Asian Americans generally have low rates of substance use, but contain disparities when disaggregated into ethnic groups, gender, and the type of drug used. Compared to other ethnic groups, research finds that Japanese and mixed-race Asian Americans have increased likelihoods of drug consumption while prescription drug abuse risk is high for Filipino Americans. Gender provides a variation in risk as well. Chinese and Vietnamese females, compared to their male counterparts, have higher probability of alcohol addiction Asian American college-aged women who have depression are found to have positive correlation with drug and alcohol consumption. Although Asian American youth substance abuse rates have increased over the years (Wong and Paul, 2005), there has not been much research conducted on this.  Self- esteem  Self-esteem, consisting of self-evaluations and judgments of one's value or self-worth, plays a significant part in Asian Americans‚Äô psychological well-being. A number of studies have revealed that Asian Americans are suffering from lower self-esteem and higher levels of depression relative to other racial/ethnic groups. The problem of low self-esteem is more prevalent among first generation immigrants and the U.S.-born Asian Americans with immigrant parents. Low self-esteem can lead to a number of negative outcomes. For example, Zhou and Bankston's (2002) research on the connection between the academic performance and self-esteem of Asian American students indicates that self-esteem is negatively linked with level of stress and angst, such that the lower their self-esteem, the higher their reported levels of stress and angst. This study also found that Asian American students are more prone to depression, insecurity, and fear of failure. Many factors contribute to the low self-esteem of Asian Americans. One such factor is the collective cultural identity derived from fundamental Asian cultures such as Confucianism. The collective culture in Asian society underscores one's membership in social groups, in contrast to the individualist culture commonly found in the United States which stresses person's uniqueness and independence. Asian Americans tend to build their self-esteem based on other people's evaluations and attitudes of themselves instead of their personal achievements and self-evaluations. Another influencing factor comes from family. Compared with white parents, Asian American parents have more control and authority over their children, while offering children less encouragements, which plays a role in the low self-esteem of many Asian American students. The influence of authoritative parenting is more notable in immigrant Asian American families. For example, many immigrant parents have high expectation for their children, trying to build their place and identity in a new environment through the achievement of their children. This parental pressure results in not only higher academic performance but greater stress and lower self-esteem. Additionally, apart from the historical racial incidents including anti-Asian movements and anti-immigration legislation, Asian Americans are also victims of racism in the United States. According to the Annual Audit of Violence Against Asian Pacific Americans conducted by the NAPALC in 2003, Asian Americans are one of the targeted groups of ‚Äúracially motivated harassment, vandalism, theft, physical assault, and in some cases, homicide‚Äù. Moreover, the discrimination in daily life are significantly injuring Asian Americans‚Äô well-being, both physically and mentally. In the face of racially motivated incidents, students are reported to have ‚Äúfeelings of helplessness, depression, psychosomatic symptoms, and a loss of face‚Äù. However, it is reported that Asian Americans‚Äô own perception of racism against them is limited and the problem and needs caused by racism are often neglected by society, masked by stereotypes such as ‚Äúmodel minority‚Äù and ‚Äúhonorary whites‚Äù. It has been reported that self-esteem is positively related to people's ethnic identity and the extent to which they explore their ethnic identity. Research conducted by Uma√±a-Taylor and Fine in 2002 shows that self- cognition from effective self-exploring and the attempt to build racial perception and ethnic identity is conductive to enhancing the self-esteem of minority population including Asian Americans.  Other  Asian Americans have a higher prevalence of tuberculosis compared with all other ethnic groups, at 22.4 per 100,000 individuals. Pacific Islanders stand at 20.8 cases per 100,000 individuals. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average tuberculosis rate is 3.9 cases per 100,000 individuals. The rate for foreign-born persons was around 11 times higher than among U.S.-born persons. While these statistics have been falling, it is important to note that tuberculosis is still a major health discrepancy issue among Asian Americans. Asian American women are at higher risk for getting osteoporosis, because of lower bone mass and smaller body frames. Lower calcium intake amplifies this risk. As many as 90% of Asian Americans are lactose intolerant, or have trouble digesting dairy products. Furthermore, less time spent outdoors means less vitamin D production, which translates to less calcium absorption. In many Asian cultures, people feel that women with lighter skin tones are more attractive. These factors are further compounded by inadequate knowledge about osteoporosis and calcium consumption among Asian women.  Barriers to health care access  At first glance, Asian Americans are far from being classified as a vulnerable population. This error has been perpetuated by many reports that classified Asian Americans as a single body, rather than as differentiated groups. As immigrants, Asian Americans are subject to barriers to accessing health care. Out of all barriers, financial, cultural, communication, and physical were the most often reported. Financial barriers exist through the lack of health insurance. Most Asian Americans receive their health insurance through work. Koreans are most likely to be uninsured, given their self-employment status. Because of the lack of health insurance, many of the most vulnerable individuals do not go for regular checkups, and do not have a regular primary care provider. Furthermore, out- of-pocket payments for care are relatively high compared with immigrant's homeland, leading to a reluctance to pay. Asian Americans tend to avoid visiting the hospital unless absolutely necessary, so many infections remain unnoticed until they develop serious symptoms, and by then the infection may have led to cancer. Of all the racial/ ethnic groups, Asian Americans are the least likely to have visited a physician within the past 12 months. Without routine checkups and the prompting of their physicians, Asian Americans are unlikely to receive their regular round of vaccinations, mammograms, and screenings. Asian American women over the age of 40 are the least likely racial/ethnic group to receive mammograms, and those who are diagnosed have more advanced stages of cancer compared to Caucasian women diagnosed. Many of these cancer burdens on the Asian American population are unnecessary and preventable with increased screening and vaccinations, especially because many cancers associated with this category are of infectious origin. Many Asian Americans also face physical barriers to health care access. Lack of transportation prevents many individuals from seeking out health care that may be further away from their residence. Furthermore, there appears to be an additional language barrier, with those that have limited English proficiency reporting even fewer mammograms than Asian Americans who are proficient at English. The proportion of Asian Americans that obtain screening tests for cervical cancer remain the lowest out of all the racial/ethnic groups as well, and again, language plays a role. Another unnecessary cancer risk is the failure to be vaccinated against hepatitis B viral infections to prevent liver cancer. Only 28.5% of Asian American youths are reported to have had a vaccination for hepatitis B versus the 73.4% among California's 7th graders. Asian Americans have a similar incidence of mental disorders as European Americans but are three times less likely to use mental health services. When Asian Americans do seek treatment, their symptoms are likely to be more severe and chronic when compared to European Americans. This is a result of initiating treatment at a later time and ending treatments prematurely. The underuse of mental health services is partially caused by the cultural stigma attached to mental illness, as well as a lack of bilingual and culturally sensitive physicians. Over two-thirds of Asian Americans are immigrants, with one-third of the total population possessing limited English proficiency. Immigrants and non-English speakers are especially vulnerable for low health literacy. Many Asian Americans are uncomfortable with communicating with their physician, leading to a gap in healthcare access and reporting. Even persons comfortable with using English may have trouble identifying or describing different symptoms, medications, or diseases. Cultural barriers also prevent proper health care access. Many Asian Americans only visit the doctor if there are visible symptoms. In other words, preventive care is not a cultural norm. Also, Asian Americans were more likely than white respondents to say that their doctor did not understand their background and values. White respondents were more likely to agree that doctors listened to everything they had to say, compared with Asian American patients. Lastly, many beliefs bar access to proper medical care. For example, many believe that blood is not replenished, and are therefore reluctant to have their blood drawn.  Substance abuse treatment  There is a rather low representation of Asian Americans as clients in the mental health system, particularly in substance abuse treatment. Many Asian Americans are first-time clients at substance abuse treatment facilities. According to American Psychological Association, Asian Americans regard familial and social circles as their main support for life problems and view institutions as the last option for support. As a result, treatment facilities may be accustomed to needs of the majority of non-Asian clients that take part in the programs. Considering the abundance of ethnic groups under Asian American population, lack of exposure to Asian American clients can be problematic as the system may not be culturally aware of or empathetic towards this diverse population's needs.  Relationship with drugs  Exploring the relationship Asian Americans have with drugs may help with understanding how to prevent and potentially redefine warning signs for drug abuse in this community. In more recent years, there has been attempts to explore the Asian American perceptions on drugs. Reasons for why people use substances vary depending on the ethnic subgroup and many other factors. Although research on this topic is limited, a study was done at music festival scenes where Asian Americans reported using drugs as means to express their identities or lifestyle tastes. In terms of alcohol misuse, cultural identity struggles, language barriers, and acculturation may correlate with likelihood of alcohol misuse as a means of coping. Each ethnic subgroup has unique life circumstances that impact how Asian Americans make decisions relating to drug use.  Policy approaches  Up to the 1990s, there was very little research into Asian American health. Until 2003, the 23 federal health surveys available aggregated data under the label Asian or Pacific Islander, making data essentially useless. Between 1986 and 2000, only 0.2% of federal grants were directed towards Asian American health and research. With warnings coming in from researchers, the Asian American and Pacific Islander community worked to establish institutions for Asian American and Pacific Islander health research. New York University School of Medicine established the Center for the Study of Asian American Health in 2003 in response. The National Cancer Institute funded the Asian American Network for Cancer Awareness, Research, and Tobacco at University of California Davis in 2005. Asian American and Pacific Islander health initiatives were funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services through institutions such as the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Office of Minority Health. The federal government has also begun reporting Asian American census data in separate ethnic groups. The US Census Bureau collects data on 25 Asian and 23 Pacific Islander subgroups. However, many of the NIH's surveys are erratic in their labeling of ethnic groups of Asian Americans, with some having different number of ethnic groups. Both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have signed executive orders to establish the President's Advisory Commission on Asian American Pacific Islanders. The committee, in 2003, advised the creation of a national plan for the improvement of health in Asian and Pacific Islander communities. Policy measures that specifically target Asian Americans, however, are yet to be seen on the federal level.  Grassroots movements  With the lack of policy initiatives from the government, Asian Americans have increasingly taken to grassroots movements to improve their health status. The Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum (APIAHF), established in 1986, has worked to influence policy and mobilize individuals to improve Asian and Pacific Islander health. Among its many activities, APIAHF has a history of filing briefs of amicus curiae in support of various court cases. Its most recent filing is a historic amicus brief in support of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in February 2012 to the Supreme Court for the case Florida v. United States Department of Health and Human Services. On behalf of 39 organizations dedicated to improving the health of Asian and Pacific Islander communities, the APIAHF brief details the needs of the Asian American community.

This suggests that he was under the age of majority at the time of his father's death. He formally acquired the earldom of Menteith in 1547, which also may suggest that reached the age of majority at that time, suggesting a birth year of approximately 1529. He inherited the earldom after the death of his father, William Graham was killed in a clan fight some time in autumn 1543, but certainly by 23 January 1544; some sources state that he was killed in October 1543 by the Tutor of Appin (a member of the Stewart family), after the Stewarts and their army ate a wedding feast to which the Earl had been invited. Some accounts also tell of the Murrays of Athole being the raiders of the feast. According to most stories, a band of Stewarts were passing through Menteith and happened upon a wedding feast. They ate up all the food, drank all the wine, and left within a short while. The Earl pursued them and was slain or mortally wounded by the robbers. In October 1548, Earl John Graham married Marion Seton, daughter of the 6th Lord Seton. Marion Seton went on to remarry after the death of the Earl, and likely married (as his third wife) John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland. Both of them were said to have been poisoned in 1567. In 1558, Earl John Graham joined the Lords of the Congregation and took part in the Siege of Leith. Based upon this, this 4th Earl of Menteith would have been well-defined as a Covenanter.

It closed with an estimated ¬£1 million in debts.Virginia Matthews, \\"News that is reader friendly\\", Sunday Times, 16 February 1986. PCN was unusual in being a weekly publication (most of its rivals were monthly with only two weeklies) and was a higher quality print with a glossy cover. Many of the monthlies were also glossies but PCN had the high cover price of 50p compared to the other weeklies. Its most direct rival Popular Computing Weekly was priced at only 35p.David Kelly, \\"User's guide to computer mags\\", The Sunday Times, 20 November 1983.Bill Johnstone,\\"80 fight for survival: Computer magazines in circulation war\\", The Times, 24 October 1984. A typical issue contained a number of articles, reviews, tutorials in computer programming and letters from readers on programming subjects. It had a regular column called Dungeon which concentrated on text adventures. Readout reviewed new books, and Gameplay reviewed new games. Other sections such as Hardware and Peripherals regularly appeared, but contained different products as they were released. It is notable for containing articles, and programs, on a large number of computers that have slipped into obscurity. It also published a large number of computer games which readers could type in. The British Microcomputing Awards were sponsored by VNU and heavily covered in PCN in conjunction with the Sunday Times and Thames Television.\\"British Microcomputing Awards\\", Sunday Times, 18 December 1983. It disappeared very suddenly with its last issue and without warning. Issue 110 featured part two of a three part article about modern adventure games. The third part was therefore lost.

Members of this group include nematodes, mites, springtails (collembola), proturans, pauropods, rotifers, tardigrades, small araneidae(spiders), pseudoscorpions, opiliones(harvestmen), enchytraeidae such as potworms, insect larvae, small isopods and myriapods They play an important part in the carbon cycle and are likely to be adversely affected by climate change. Soil mesofauna feed on a wide range of materials including other soil animals, microorganisms, animal material, live or decaying plant material, fungi, algae, lichen, spores, and pollen. Species that feed on decaying plant material open drainage and aeration channels in the soil by removing roots. Fecal material of soil mesofauna remains in channels which can be broken down by smaller animals. Soil mesofauna do not have the ability to reshape the soil and, therefore, are forced to use the existing pore space in soil, cavities, or channels for locomotion. Soil Macrofauna, earthworms, termites, ants and some insect larvae, can make the pore spaces and hence can change the soil porosity, one aspect of soil morphology. Mesofauna contribute to habitable pore spaces and account for a small portion of total pore spaces. Clay soils have much smaller particles which reduce pore space. Organic material can fill small pores. Grazing of bacteria by bacterivorous nematodes and flagellates, soil mesofauna living in the pores, may considerably increase Nitrogen mineralization because the bacteria are broken down and the nitrogen is released. In agricultural soils, most of the biological activity occurs in the top , the soil biomantle or plow layer, while in non-cultivated soils, the most biological activity occurs in top of soil. The top layer is the organic horizon or O horizon, the area of accumulation of animal residues and recognizable plant material. Animal residues are higher in nitrogen than plant residues with respect to the total carbon in the residue. Some Nitrogen fixation is caused by bacteria which consume the amino acids and sugar that are exuded by the plant roots. However, approximately 30% of nitrogen re- mineralization is contributed by soil fauna in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Macro- and mesofauna break down plant residues to release Nitrogen as part of nutrient cycling.

He is now best known for the construction of Mount Grace Manor House, one of the few extant examples of architecture from the 1649 to 1660 Commonwealth or Protectorate. Life The Lascelles were part of a network of mercantile interests in London, Yorkshire, Ireland, New England and Barbados. While unconnected to the aristocratic family of the same name, various branches were spread across Yorkshire, including Northallerton, Durham, Whitby, York, Harewood House and Terrington. The family tended to use the same names (Thomas, Francis, Robert, Henry etc), which often causes confusion. Thomas Lascelles was born in August 1624, fourth and youngest son of William Lascelles (died November 1624) and Elizabeth Wade; he had three brothers, Francis (1612-1667), Robert (1617-?) and Peregrine (1619-1658). Career Like many of his friends and relations, Thomas supported Parliament during the 1639-1652 Wars of the Three Kingdoms. In the late 1640s, he served in the New Model Army in England and Ireland and established businesses first in Dromore, County Down, then later in Lisburn. The 1641 Irish Rebellion led to military interventions by the Scots and English Parliament, which were financed by the March 1642 Adventurers Act. One of the last pieces of legislation approved before the English Civil War began, this raised loans to be repaid by the sale of lands held by the Irish rebels; enforcing it was one of the primary objectives of Cromwell's war in Ireland. A number of different subscriptions for the Adventurers loans were opened between 1642 to 1647 and although the Lascelles family are not listed by name, many subscribed by forming syndicates and sold their interests prior to lands being allocated by the 1652 Act of Settlement. It seems likely Thomas was involved, since both he and his brother Francis had business interests in Ulster, while another branch of the family was established in Killough, County Down. Smith, p. 55 He invested his profits in purchasing the manor of Northallerton from the Bishop of Durham in 1649, followed in 1653 by Mount Grace Priory, a former Carthusian monastery suppressed in 1539. He converted parts of the remaining buildings into what is now a rare example of architecture from the 1649 to 1660 Commonwealth. In 1660, Charles II was restored as monarch and in April, Thomas and Francis were elected to the Convention Parliament as Members of Parliament for Northallerton. In June, the two deemed it prudent to resign their seats and go into temporary exile in the Dutch Republic. Regicides Cromwell, Bradshaw, and Ireton 1660; the involvement of his brother Francis in the trial of Charles I led to a short exile in Holland While a key player in negotiations leading to the Restoration, Francis was also a member of the High Court of Justice that condemned Charles I to death in 1649. Although neither present when sentence was passed nor a signatory of the death warrant, he was clearly a target, especially after the Regicides were excluded from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act. Many were condemned to be hung, drawn and quartered, while the corpses of Cromwell, Bradshaw and Ireton were dug up and dragged to Tyburn gallows. The executions were halted only when ministers grew concerned by public reaction to the deaths. Even Pepys, who was closely connected to the new regime, recorded his admiration for the conduct of Thomas Harrison at his execution in October 1660. The Lascelles were indemnified and allowed to return home, although Francis was fined and perpetually barred from holding public office. The brothers were later accused of involvement in the Northern Rising, a conspiracy of some 100 Anabaptist former soldiers and radicals centred on Northallerton and Leeds. In December 1662, the two were briefly held in York Castle but the 'Lascelles Plot' was soon shown to have been fabricated by government informers while the Rising in October 1663 quickly collapsed. All Saints, Northallerton, where Thomas and other family members was buried The 1665 to 1667 Second Anglo-Dutch War was opposed by many former Parliamentarians on both commercial and political grounds and Thomas was one of those held in preventative detention during the invasion scare of 1666. While not directly involved in the 1679 to 1681 Exclusion Crisis, he ensured Northallerton returned anti-Court MPs and his house was searched for weapons after the 1683 Rye House Plot. Watson & Bolton, The History of Parliament Online In the 1688 Glorious Revolution, his nephew Daniel served in the force led by Lord Danby that secured York and Hull for William III. After a gap of nearly thirty years, Thomas was re-elected MP for Northallerton in 1689 and loaned money to the new regime, which do not appear to have been repaid. Smith, p. 56 He remained an MP until his death in 1697, although with minimal involvement, and was appointed Housekeeper of the Excise Office in 1693. When he died in November 1697, his family had to seek assistance from Parliament in settling his estates; in April 1698, the House of Lords introduced, \\"An Act for vesting the Real Estate late of Thomas Lassells Esquire deceased, in Trustees, to be sold, for the Payment of his Debts.\\" The process was not completed until March 1699, when his widow was given permission to dispose of lands and houses in Ealing, Middlesex. Thomas was the only member of his family to live at Mount Grace; it was rented out in 1701 before being sold by Robert Lascelles in 1744.

Miller spent ten years writing Song of Achilles while she worked as a Latin and Greek teacher. The novel tells the story of the love between the mythological figures Achilles and Patroclus; it won the Orange Prize for Fiction, making Miller the fourth debut novelist to win the prize. She is a 2019 recipient of the Alex Awards. Early life Miller was born on July 24, 1978, in Boston and grew up in New York City and Philadelphia. After graduating from Brown University with a bachelor's and master's in Classics (2000 and 2001, respectively), Miller then went on to teach Latin, Greek and Shakespeare to high school students. She also studied for a year at the University of Chicago's Committee on Social Thought toward a PhD and from 2009 to 2010 at the Yale School of Drama for an MFA in Dramaturgy and Dramatic Criticism. Miller lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts teaching and writing. Miller told a reporter from The Guardian that she has been inspired by a lot of books, poetry and authors, including David Mitchell, Lorrie Moore, Anne Carson and Virgil. The Song of Achilles The Song of Achilles, Miller's debut novel, was released in September 2011. The book took her ten years to write. After discarding a completed manuscript five years into her writing, she started again from scratch, struggling to perfect the voice of her narrator. The Song of Achilles, set in Greece, tells the story of a love affair between Achilles and Patroclus. Miller was inspired by the account of the two men from Homer's Iliad and said she wanted to explore who Patroclus was and what he meant to Achilles. On her inspiration for the novel, Miller explained: Miller had become transfixed by Achilles after her mother read the Iliad to her when she was younger. She also found Patroclus \\"tantalizing\\" because he is a minor character that later had a \\"big impact\\" on the outcome of the Trojan War. The writer used classical texts by Ovid, Virgil, Sophocles, Apollodorus, Euripides and Aeschylus to help with the plot, as well as accounts of Achilles' childhood friendship with Patroclus and his martial training. Miller also uses quotes from Homer in the text. The Song of Achilles was the winner of the 17th annual Orange Prize for Fiction. Carolyn Kellogg of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was a surprise win, with Miller being \\"the dark horse in this year's race\\". Joanna Trollope, chair of the judges, commented \\"This is a more than worthy winner ‚Äì original, passionate, inventive and uplifting. Homer would be proud of her.\\" The book was also shortlisted for the 2013 Chautauqua Prize.  Circe  Circe, Miller's second novel, was released on April 10, 2018. The book is told from the perspective of Circe, an enchantress in Greek mythology who is featured in Homer's Odyssey. Circe was ranked the second-greatest book of the 2010s in Paste. An 8-part miniseries adaptation of the book has been greenlit for HBO Max. Bibliography *The Song of Achilles. London: Bloomsbury, 2011. , *Circe: A Novel.

This suggests that he was under the age of majority at the time of his father's death. Even though he was not yet of age, he was known and acknowledged as the Earl of Menteith despite the crown holding the earldom. He officially received the earldom from the crown in November 1571, and so it is likely that he was probably born around November 1555. He married Margaret Douglas and had two sons and a daughter: * John Graham, who succeeded to the earldom; * George Graham; and * Helen Graham. About ten days before his death, William Graham allegedly left a will that his son John should remain in the charge of George Buchanan, his brother in law.

Summary The fire started as two separate fires, the Whitewater fire which was detected on May 16 and the smaller Baldy fire that started earlier on May 9, both from lightning strikes. The fires merged on 24 May. The fire has burned more than a dozen residences, caused the evacuation of several small towns, and forced the closure of the Gila Cliffdwellings and the Catwalk Recreation Area above Glenwood, New Mexico. Rain showers in mid-July helped firefighters reach 95% containment by July 23. Government response On May 15, 2012, as a result of the Whitewater‚ÄìBaldy complex fire, governor Susana Martinez declared the entire state of New Mexico to be in a drought. Martinez issued the formal drought declaration to help farmers, ranchers, and others secure federal drought funding. Martinez stated that in addition to \\"the work we're doing at the state level to assist communities facing serious drought conditions, I'm hopeful this declaration will assist them in securing any available federal funding as well.\\" Martinez stated that \\"As a result of this fire, small businesses are unquestionably feeling the impact.\\" As a result, she encouraged them to apply for SBA loans.

The plane flies through a violent storm and crashes into the ocean after it is struck by lightning. About half of the passengers manage to survive on one of the inflatable life rafts. Included are swimsuit model Laura, biology professor Diana, Diana's daughter Ariel, juvenile delinquent Brian, young Melissa, middle-aged Frank, bro Matt, embassy representative Karen, Marine guard Vic and mysterious Ben Fields, who apparently has US government ties. After several days, Karen spots an island, which they paddle to. It seems like a tropical paradise, but mysteries and problems soon crop up. Ariel finds a human skull with a bullet hole in it, along with a Jeep on a dirt road. The party decides to follow the road to look for assistance. When Rick and Frank enter the water to beach the raft for the night, they are attacked by an unseen underwater creature, with squid-like tentacles and spines like a sea urchin. Diana unsuccessfully tries to neutralize the toxin. Overnight, Frank goes into the water and metamorphosizes into a reptilian sea monster with scales and webbed hands and feet. They follow the road, but Rick starts having psychic flashbacks of events on the island. They eventually find an American research station that was abandoned by its staff in 1976. Hacking the computer system, Ariel and Brian find that the station is named MK-Naomi, a name Ben is secretly familiar with. Rick leaves one night after more flashbacks. Laura, Ben, Matt and Vic head out to search for him and soon encounter the island's indigenous tribe and are taken to their village. They spend the night, but Vic has a terrifying hallucination while trying to make out with a native woman and they quickly leave. Diana deduces that the station was involved in research for a wide range of biological weapons, including extrasensory perception, as in Rick's case. Rick returns after visiting the village and finding a hut with research materials from a scientist with a conscience, who had sabotaged the station and taken an antigen with him. Frank follows a trail the party had left for him to the research station. He breaks through the front door and terrifies the party. They are able to fend him off using a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher. The search party returns from the village, whereupon they debate what to do about Frank. They decide to try to use the antigen elixir from the hut to cure Frank. Rick lures Frank into a walk-in freezer and injects him with the elixir. Frank mostly reverts to human form but dies moments later. Rick is given the remainder of the elixir and improves, but he retains his extrasensory abilities, deducing from a brief touch that Laura is a model (which she's ashamed of being) and that Ben has been to the island before.

DeArmond, Ashmead & Bickley was an early-20th-century architecture and landscape architecture firm based in Philadelphia. It specialized in Colonial Revival, Beaux-Arts, and English Arts & Crafts-style buildings, especially suburban houses. Clarence DeArmond (1880-1953) was a 1903 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. He worked under Frank Miles Day, and formed a 1908 partnership with Duffield Ashmead, Jr. (1883-1952). Ashmead was a 1906 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, who had studied under Paul Cret, and worked under Wilson Eyre. In 1911, the duo brought in a third partner, George H. Bickley (1880-1938), a 1903 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and a 1907 graduate of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, who worked under Horace Trumbauer.Company profile from Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. One of the firm's notable commissions was for alterations to \\"Fairwold,\\" an 1888 Shingle-style summer house in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, designed by Wilson Eyre for T. Craig Heberton. In 1916, second owner Richard M. Cadwalader, Jr. hired D, A & B to face the shingled walls with stone, and expand the house into a Tudor-revival mansion. Eyre's understated Arts & Crafts interiors were replaced by literalist period-revival set pieces.James B. Garrison, Houses of Philadelphia: Chestnut Hill and the Wissahickon Valley (New York: Acanthus Press, 2008), pp. 56-60. Six years later, D, A & B added a massive music- room/solarium addition (with pipe organ and musicians' balcony), that was larger than the original house.Fairwold music room and pipe organ. The building is now Or Hadash Synagogue. D, A & B also made major alterations to Cadwalader's Philadelphia residence. They stripped the 1860 townhouse of its brick-and-brownstone facade and stoop, replacing it with a limestone Beaux- Arts facade. In 1964, this became the Delancey Place house of the author Pearl Buck. The firm disbanded soon after Bickley's death in 1938. DeArmond worked briefly for the Philadelphia Housing Authority in the 1930s, and was one of the architects of the Hill Creek Housing Project. Selected works * Thomas G.

Designed in 1849 by the American inventor Thomas E. Warren (b. 1808), the chair was produced by the American Chair Company in Troy, New York.

Tilting was achieved through the flexion of the four large C-shaped steel springs on which the seat rested, using the sitter's feet as a fulcrum.

The majority of nations in the Middle East censor the media, including Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan runs the third most stringent censorship program in the world. The government owns all forms of media and only reports good news or propaganda. In 2013, Turkmenistan banned all foreign publications and nongovernmental libraries. Internet censorship A variety of techniques are used to censor Internet media anywhere in the world. The first way is for the government to place legal restrictions on the internet service providers or exhibit direct control over them. Through this control, the government blocks certain websites or media (such as pictures, videos, and news articles), and is even able to place surveillance over certain sources. The second way is for the government to outlaw, or even make informal requests discouraging the existence of controversial media corporations in their countries, in order to prevent the spread of ideas proposed by said companies. Finally, the third way governments enforce censorship is to directly contact a cow owner and request the removal of certain material, or the website in its entirety. With these three methods, governments may remove certain unwanted content and therefore control the thoughts of their people. Censorship during the Arab Spring As a result of the Arab Spring, totalitarian regimes cracked down on information flow. Reporters Without Borders states, \\"at least 199 of those engaged in informing the public were arrested in 2011, a 31-percent increase compared with the previous year.\\" Since early 2011, Bahrain has used censorship techniques such as slowing down Internet speeds, to prevent the spread of pictures and videos, monitoring internet use, and blocking controversial sites and topics. Bahrain enforced subtle tactics, whereas Egypt completely shut down the Internet for five days during the period of the most unrest in January 2011. Other nations, despite their effort to continue a strict censorship program, find it impossible to censor all material with the potential to spark a rebellion due to the wealth of information now available through the media. In recent years, more information has slipped through the cracks than ever before. For example, Arab television stations aired an Israelite nationalist video on the anniversary of Israeli independence, mainly because \\"[Jordan] couldn't censor it,\\" according to Jon Alterman. By 2011, Internet users in Egypt and Tunisia especially have found ways around the censorship. Egyptian bloggers reported abuses committed by the state, such as police beatings and activist arrests. These bloggers were then arrested, spurring other bloggers to report the arrests of the previous bloggers. As the censorship in Egypt came crashing to the ground, so did the reign of Mubarak. In Tunisia, Internet users created their own version of WikiLeaks, called \\"Tunileaks.\\" Tunileaks informed the public of the shortcomings of their leader, Ben Ali, and again, sparked a revolution.

Sun Princess's sire, English Prince, won the Irish Derby, but was not a great success as a stallion in Europe and was exported to Japan in 1980. Her dam, Sunny Valley, also bred at Ballymacoll, went on to produce the Coronation Cup winner Saddlers' Hall and was the direct female ancestor of the St Leger winner Millenary and the double Breeders' Cup Turf winner Conduit. Like many of the stud's horses, Sun Princess was sent into training with Major Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. She was ridden in most of her races by Hern's stable jockey Willie Carson. Racing career=1982: two-year-old season As a young horse, Sun Princess was a challenging horse to train as her temperament made her difficult to settle and she had a tendency to bolt during exercise. Like many of Dick Hern's best horses, she was lightly-campaigned as a two-year-old. She ran once, finishing second in the Blue Seal Stakes at Ascot in September. 1983: three-year-old season Sun Princess made her first appearance as a three-year-old in the Sir Charles Clore Memorial Stakes, at Newbury in May, a trial race for the Epsom Oaks. She ran second to Ski Sailing, finishing twenty-five lengths clear of the third horse. After the race, Carson had a private wager with Ski Sailing's jockey, Steve Cauthen, that he would reverse the placings in the Oaks. At Epsom on 4 June, Sun Princess started at odds of 6/1 for the Oaks, with the French-trained Alexandrie starting favourite. Carson restrained the filly in the early stages before allowing her to make up ground on the outside and sending her into the lead half a mile from the finish. In the straight she increased her lead with every stride to record a \\"highly impressive victory\\" by twelve lengths from Acclimatise, with Royal Heroine (Breeders' Cup Mile) and Cormorant Wood (Champion Stakes) among the beaten fillies. The winning margin was the largest ever recorded in the Oaks and the biggest in any British Classic race since Never Say Die won the St Leger by twelve lengths in 1954. Observers including Timeform speculated that Sun Princess might well have won that year's Epsom Derby if she had contested that race. She was the also the first maiden to win a Classic since Asmena won the Oaks in 1950. Sun Princess bypassed a meeting with the leading Irish filly Give Thanks in the Irish Oaks, being instead sent to Ascot to run against colts and older horses in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. She started 9/4 joint-favourite with the Prix du Jockey Club winner Caerleon, ahead of rivals including Time Charter, Lemhi Gold, Lancastrian (Prix Ganay), Diamond Shoal (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud) and Awaasif (Yorkshire Oaks). Sun Princess pulled very hard in the early stages as Carson struggled to restrain her. She made steady progress in the straight, but failed to reach the lead and finished third to Time Charter and Diamond Shoal, beaten just under two lengths. A month after her defeat at Ascot, Sun Princess started 6/5 favourite the Yorkshire Oaks, in she was matched against Give Thanks. The Irish filly had won seven of her eight races in 1983, including the Irish Oaks, and was well- supported at 7/4. On this occasion, Sun Princess was allowed to lead from the start and was never in danger of defeat, accelerating clear of her opponents in the straight and running on with \\"tremendous zest\\" to win by four lengths from Green Lucia, with Give Thanks a further three lengths back in third. Following her win at York, Sun Princess again faced mixed-sex competition in the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster on 10 September for which started 11/8 favourite. Her main rivals included the Epsom Derby runner-up Carlingford Castle and the Grand Prix de Paris winner Yawa. The race was run on soft ground which forced the withdrawal of Caerleon and led to doubts about Sun Princess's participation until shortly before the race. The Hern stable entered a pacemaker named Sailor's Dance who led at a moderate gallop before Sun Princess took the lead in the straight. On this occasion she had to be driven out by Carson to win by three-quarters of a length from the French- trained Esprit du Nord, with Carlingford Castle third. It was the second time that Hern had won the Oaks-St Leger double, having been successful with the Queen's filly Dunfermline in 1977. On her final appearance of the season, Sun Princess was sent to Longchamp Racecourse in Paris to contest the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Sailor's Dance once again set the pace before Sun Princess took over before the straight. She held off challenges from Time Charter, Stanerra, and Diamond Shoal but was overtaken fifty metres from the finish by All Along and finished second by a length. 1984: four-year-old season Sun Princess stayed in training as a four-year-old in 1984, but failed to reproduce her three-year-old success. On her seasonal debut she met Time Charter again in the Coronation Cup, but was no match for the older mare and was beaten four lengths. In July she ran in the King George for the second time and finished fifth behind Teenoso. She was off the course until the Arc de Triomphe in October, where she finished unplaced behind Sagace. According to Timeform \\"the old sparkle had gone\\". Assessment Sun Princess was awarded a rating of 130 by Timeform in 1983 and 120 a year later. In the 1983 International Classification, an official ranking of the best European horses, Sun Princess was rated the equal fifth-best horse in Europe, behind Shareef Dancer, All Along, Habibti and Caerlon. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sun Princess a \\"superior\\" Oaks winner and the thirty-second best filly of the twentieth century to have been trained in the United Kingdom or Ireland. After her death, Carson described her as being a difficult horse, but \\"possibly the best filly I ever rode\\", adding that \\"if she'd learned to relax enough she would have been the best you've ever seen.\\" Breeding record Sun Princess was retired to a breeding career at Ballymacoll. She was the dam of at least eight winners, most notably Prince of Dance (by Sadler's Wells) who dead-heated for the 1988 Dewhurst Stakes, also won the Champagne Stakes, Newmarket Stakes and was disqualified after winning the Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury because the colt was not qualified to run. Others included Princely Venture (by Entrepreneur) who won Scottish Derby, Ballet Prince (3rd Prix Gladiateur) and Golden Ball (7th Epsom Derby). Through her daughter Ballet Queen, Sun Princess is the ancestor of the Tokyo Yushun winner Fusaichi Concorde and the Satsuki Sho winners Unrivaled and Victory. Descendants of Sun Princess remain at Ballymacoll through her granddaughter Drama Class (by Caerleon out of Stage Struck by Sadler's Wells). Drama Class has had two black type offspring in Scottish Stage (by Selkirk: 2nd Irish Oaks) and Eleanora Duse (by Azamour), who are both also broodmares at the stud. In contrast to her attitude during her racing career, Sun Princess developed a quiet and docile temperament in retirement: the Ballymacoll stud manager describer her as \\"a most wonderful character and a very easy mare to deal with. A real lady.\\" Sun Princess died in 2001 after developing a tumour in her sinus and was buried at the Ballymacoll Stud. * 1986 PRINCE OF DANCE (GB) : Bay colt, foaled 21 April, by Sadler's Wells (USA) ‚Äì won 4 races including G1 Dewhurst S, Newmarket; G2 Champagne S, Doncaster; LR Newmarket S, Newmarket from 6 starts in England 1988‚Äì9; died during 1989 * 1987 RUBY SETTING (GB) : Bay filly, foaled 20 April, by Gorytus (USA) ‚Äì won 1 race and placed 5 times from 8 starts in England 1989‚Äì90 * 1988 BALLET QUEEN (IRE) : Bay filly, foaled 16 April, by Sadler's Wells (USA) ‚Äì unraced, dam of winners including Fusaichi Concorde (JPN)(1993, by Caerleon ‚Äì 1st G1 Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby), sire in Japan), Born King (JPN)(1998, by Sunday Silence ‚Äì G3 Kesei Hai, Nakayama) * 1989 SUN SEEKER (IRE) : Bay colt, foaled 16 May, by Rainbow Quest (USA) ‚Äì won once and placed once from 3 starts in England 1992 * 1990 BALLET PRINCE (IRE) : Bay colt, foaled 1 January, by Sadler's Wells (USA) ‚Äì won 2 races and placed 7 times including 2nd LR Prix Moskowa, Chantilly; 3rd LR Glorious S, Goodwood; 3rd G3 Prix Gladiateur, Longchamp from 20 starts in England, France, Germany, Sweden and Denmark 1993-7 * 1991 GOLDEN BALL (IRE) : Bay colt, foaled 2 May, by Sadler's Wells (USA) ‚Äì won once and placed 7 times including 2nd LR Magnolia S, Kempton; 3rd LR March S, Goodwood from 13 starts in England 1993-5 * 1992 STAGE STRUCK (IRE) : Bay filly, foaled 12 May, by Sadler's Wells (USA) ‚Äì won 1 race and placed twice from 7 starts in Britain 1994‚Äì5.

It is published in English and German. The first strip was put online on 19 October 2008 and the black-and-white comic strip has been updated twice a week since then. As of 18 June 2020, 1187 strips have been published. From strip #307, published on 12 September 2011, to strip #398, published on 30 July 2012, the comic was colored by the American artist Lisa Moore. She also colored selected strips from the strip archive during this time. The 1000th Sandra and Woo strip was posted on 1 July 2018. A Kickstarter was announced on 7 November 2018 for a printed anthology of the first 1031 strips published already, and a second book containing art based on the comic. Characters The main characters of the comic strip are the 13-year-old girl Sandra North and her pet raccoon Woo. Sandra lives together with her single father Richard in an unnamed town in the north of the United States. Woo is able to speak, but only talks with Sandra since he‚Äôs afraid to end up in a laboratory otherwise. Woo is a quite mischievous raccoon, so Sandra occasionally gets in trouble as a result of Woo‚Äôs misbehavior. Sandra's boyfriend Cloud Williams and Sandra's best friend Larisa Korolev have appeared almost as often as Woo in the webcomic since 2010. Cloud is the son of two fanatic Final Fantasy fans, David and Ye Thuza, who named him after Final Fantasy VII‚Äôs hero Cloud Strife. They also have a younger daughter, named Yuna after the Final Fantasy X protagonist. Cloud gets trained in sword-fighting and combat by his Burmese mother Ye Thuza, who was a rebel in her home country before coming to America. Larisa is a free spirit who doesn‚Äôt think too much about the consequences of her actions. She‚Äôs a casual pyromaniac and the only thing she loves more than fire is probably smooching with boys. In strip #718 it was revealed that she was born with Wolfram syndrome, which means she has a lifespan of about 30 years, giving us some insight of her aggressive determination to live while she can.http://www.sandraandwoo.com/2015/09/14/0718-corrupting-the-youth/ Other recurring characters include Woo's love interest Lily, the fox Shadow and the red squirrel Sid, who live in the large forest near Sandra‚Äôs house. Shadow and Sid met as kits when they were raised by the same wildlife rehabber. As indicated by the webcomic's tagline, \\"a webcomic about friendship, life and the art of (not) eating squirrels\\", it is a running gag in the webcomic that Woo, Shadow and other carnivores regularly try to eat Sid, but fail in the end. Reception Sandra and Woo received positive reviews from most critics. Brigid Alverson from Comic Book Resources noted that \\"it includes a bit of bad language and a few references to serious subjects, but the cute animals and the clean artwork have plenty of kid- appeal.\\" In issue 06/2010 of the Russian game magazine Game Land, the reviewer pointed out that comic readers would enjoy the references to other comics found in Sandra and Woo. Jaron Hataway of The Dallas Morning News' Pop Culture Blog found that Andini's art style makes it easy to understand the course of action and that Kn√∂rzer understands the \\"interwoven feelings of tween-aged girls.\\" Criticising that the dialog \\"can sometimes be a little off,\\" he gave it a rating of 9/10 and concluded that \\"the characters are wonderfully crafted and the art is delightful.\\" Other critics were reminded of Bill Watterson‚Äôs Calvin and Hobbes, which is also given as the main influence by the webcomic author, because of the similar style of humor. Sandra and Woo was nominated three times for the category \\"Best Anthropomorphic Comic Strip\\" at the 2010, 2011, and 2012 Ursa Major Awards, for the category ‚ÄúBest Black and White Art‚Äù at The Webcomic List Awards 2010, and was given a Webcomic Beaky Award as one of the three best new webcomics of 2008. In March 2013, Sandra and Woo reached the final round of the ComicMix Webcomic Tournament 2013, a single-elimination tournament based on votes and donations between 128 of the most popular webcomics. Sandra and Woo was also the topic of two journal articles by linguist Jun.-Prof. Dr. Ulrike Preu√üer from the University of Duisburg-Essen published in German teaching magazines. Taking an in-depth look at the German versions of the strips A Sly Raccoon and The Forbidden Fruit, Preu√üer discusses how teachers can use comic strips such as those to generate literary interest in grade schoolers. The German version of the strip Test Of Friendship was included in Freir√§ume ‚Äì Evangelisches Religionsbuch f√ºr Mittelschulen, a Protestant religious schoolbook for German middle schools. Sandra and Woo was also featured in two scientific papers written by the computer scientists Philip Buchanan, Bachelor of Engineering at the University of Canterbury, Michael Doggett, Associate Professor at Lund University, and Ramakrishnan Mukundan, Associate Professor at the University of Canterbury. Using artwork from various Sandra and Woo strips, they presented a new automatic algorithm for extracting properties of an individual artist‚Äôs style and applying those properties to other drawings. For the 500th strip, entitled The Book of Woo and published on 29 July 2013, Kn√∂rzer and Andini created four illustrated pages inspired by the Voynich manuscript. All four pages show strange illustrations next to a cipher text. The strip was mentioned in MTV Geek and discussed in the Cipher Mysteries blog of cryptology expert Nick Pelling as well as Klausis Krypto Kolumne of cryptology expert Klaus Schmeh. The Book of Woo was also discussed on several pages of Craig P. Bauer's book Unsolved! about the history of famous ciphers.

Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure  In summer 2012, the German PC game developer Feline Fuelled Games began the development of an adventure game called Sandra and Woo in the Cursed Adventure featuring all the main characters from Sandra and Woo. On 30 April 2015, the first screenshots of the game were uploaded to the webcomic's website. The game was eventually released on Steam on 5 May 2017 to mixed reviews from video game critics. In his review for Adventure Gamers (3.5/5 stars), Peter Mattsson was fond of the likeable characters and the interesting story, but criticized the design of some of the puzzles and minigames. Susanne Lang-Vorhofer from the German website Adventure Corner also liked the characters and the story, but had a very negative opinion about the German voice-over, giving the game a score of 68% in the end.  Gaia  Since 19 November 2011, the Sandra and Woo website also hosts Kn√∂rzer and Andini's fantasy webcomic Gaia, which follows the adventures of several graduates of an elite academy after a deadly attack during graduation ball. Gaia is based on a story which was originally developed by Feline Fuelled Games for a cancelled campaign mod for the PC game Neverwinter Nights 2. Gaia is updated twice a week with full color pages. As of 12 July 2018, 673 pages have been published, including 7 cover pages.

Active during the Vietnam War, the CSDC operated closely with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1966 to 1975. Origins The CSDC was created in January 1966 by the South Vietnamese government as an armed support unit for the National Police.Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), p. 43. Role The missions performed by the CSDC went well beyond the normal duties of a civil police force, functionally serving as another branch of the South Vietnamese armed forces, being organized and trained for paramilitary operations in the field on both rural and urban areas. Primarily assigned to intelligence-gathering, counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism duties, CSDC companies and battalions were also employed in various other tasks such as guarding important public buildings, VIP protection, public security, riot control, cordon and search, and urban combat operations. Between 1967 and 1972 the CSDC was deeply involved in the highly controversial CIA-run Phoenix Program (), participating actively in the \\"neutralization\\" ‚Äì which often involved arbitrary arrests without charge, routine torture,de Lee, Guerrilla Warfare (1985), p. 57. and extrajudicial executions ‚Äì of suspected members of the civil infrastructure or \\"shadow administration\\" of the Viet Cong (VC).Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), pp. 37; 39. Composition CSDC members' were usually National Policemen that volunteered to Field Force service, although the unit also accepted military personnel either transferred or retired from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). The latter included former members of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces (Vietnamese: L·ª±c L∆∞·ª£ng ƒê·∫∑c Bi·ªát Qu√¢n L·ª±c Vi·ªát Nam C·ªông H√≤a ‚Äì LLDB) following its disbandment in December 1970.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 6.Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), p. 39. Structure and organization The Field Police Command Staff reported directly for operational orders to the National Police Command and was co-located to the CSQG Headquarters at Saigon. Under the designation of 'Armed Support Unit' (Vietnamese: ƒê∆°n v·ªã h·ªó tr·ª£ v≈© trang), by 1969 the CSDC Command was in charge of the Field Police units and of the River and Coastal Police. Rechristened 'Reaction Unit' (Vietnamese: ƒê∆°n v·ªã ph·∫£n ·ª©ng) in 1972, the Field Police Command integrated the Provincial Investigation Force (Vietnamese: L·ª±c l∆∞·ª£ng ƒëi·ªÅu tra t·ªânh) and in 1973 changed again its designation to 'Mobile Operations Department' (Vietnamese: Ph√≤ng ƒëi·ªÅu h√†nh di ƒë·ªông).Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), pp. 38‚Äì39. The basic unit of the Field Police was the company (Vietnamese: Dai ƒê·ªôi ‚Äì DD), organized into a 24-man company headquarters (HQ) and several 40-man combat platoons (Vietnamese: Trung ƒê·ªôi ‚Äì TRD), each with four 10-man squads (Vietnamese: Ti·ªáu ƒê·ªôi). Until 1968, one company was assigned to each province and main cities and fielded a number of platoons ranging from two to 13 according to the number of rural or urban districts. For example, up to five districts a single company was assigned, but if a province or town counted more than six districts, two companies could be deployed. After 1969, a major re-organization was implemented, with the provincial companies being expanded to battalions (Vietnamese: Ti·ªáu Do√†n ‚Äì TD). By August 1971, the CSDC strength totaled 16,500 officers and enlisted men organized into 44 provincial battalions comprising some 90 companies, 242 district platoons and one independent armoured cavalry platoon. Two independent companies of four platoons each were based respectively at V≈©ng T√†u and Da Nang, two autonomous port cities which had their own municipal police services separated from the province in which they were located. To provide supervision and support to all these provincial and urban Field Police units, Regional Headquarters and Service Companies were located at each of the country's four Military Regions. A CSDC company was usually commanded by an Inspector (a Captain after 1971), who came under the operational command of the National Police provincial chief (Vietnamese: Tr∆∞·ªüng c√¥ng an t·ªânh) whilst platoons assigned to the districts were firmly under operational control of the district police chief (Vietnamese: Tr∆∞·ªüng c√¥ng an huy·ªán) who, in turn, was directly answerable to the district political chief (Vietnamese: Tr∆∞·ªüng ph√≤ng ch√≠nh tr·ªã huy·ªán). Armoured car unit A predominantly light infantry force, the CSDC operated a single independent armoured cavalry platoon (Vietnamese: Trung ƒë·ªôi k·ªµ binh ƒë·ªôc l·∫≠p), provided with eight World War II-vintage US M8 Greyhound light armoured cars. Headquartered at Saigon, it was tasked of providing security to the National Police HQ and the adjoining National Bank building and their environs.Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), p. 39. Tactical Mobile Groups In addition, the Field Police maintained two Tactical Mobile Groups ‚Äì TMG (Vietnamese: Bi√™t Do√†n ‚Äì BD) totalling 5,000 men and designated BD 5 and BD 222 respectively, which conferred the National Police the capacity to engage independently in either defensive or offensive actions according to its mission of operational defense. Based at Saigon, BD 5 was in fact an enlarged battalion since it fielded, in addition to one headquarters' (HQ) company, 12 to 14 combat companies of four platoons each. The battalion operated on the wider Saigon- Gia ƒê·ªãnh region, assigned to the Saigon Municipal Police Directorate (Vietnamese: T·ªïng c·ª•c c·∫£nh s√°t th√†nh ph·ªë S√†i G√≤n) which was encharged with the internal security and internal defense of the capital. During the Tet Offensive in January 1968 the unit was committed in the defense of President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu's residence, the Independence Palace alongside other National Police and ARVN units,Arnold, Tet Offensive 1968 ‚Äì Turning point in Vietnam (1990), p. 42. distinguishing itself at the battles for the Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Cholon, the Phu Tho Racetrack and the Cha Tam Church, where they inflicted heavy losses on attacking VC units. Also headquartered at Saigon, BD 222, a smaller battalion with just six combat companies, was in turn assigned to the General Reserve (Vietnamese: T·ªïng d·ª± tr·ªØ) of the National Police as a quick reaction unit that could be deployed nationwide, being tasked with specific missions and reinforcement duties. Engaged in Saigon during the Tet in 1968, the field policemen of BD 222 succeeded in flushing out the VC \\"Sappers\\" (Vietnamese: ƒê·∫Øc C·ªông) entrenched in the National Radio Broadcasting Station building,Arnold, Tet Offensive 1968 ‚Äì Turning point in Vietnam (1990), p. 41. located a few hundred meters away from the American Embassy, but also fought elsewhere. Between 1968 and 1975, the Battalion's combat companies were deployed at various times and locations throughout the country, engaging in defensive and offensive operations in conjunction with other National Police or ARVN units at Hu·∫ø, Da Nang, B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh, Tuy√™n Du·∫ø, Gia ƒê·ªãnh, Long An, Bi√™n H√≤a, and Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc Island. When the city of An L·ªôc was besieged in April 1972 during the Easter Offensive by three People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) armoured divisions, BD 222 was rushed in to bolster the city's defenses and successfully held its ground against repeated assaults by enemy tanks.Conboy, Bowra and McCouaig, The NVA and Viet Cong (1991), p. 15. Police Special Recon Teams Reconnaissance and scouting missions were performed by the combat trackers of the Special Recon Teams ‚Äì SRT (Vietnamese: Tr·ªãnh S√°t ƒê·∫Øc Bi√™t ‚Äì TSDB). Recruited from ethnic minorities such as the Khmer Krom, Cham, N√πng or the Degar hill tribes (a.k.a. Montagnards in French), they were organized into platoon-sized units attached to each CSDC company. Training National Policemen who volunteered to Field Force service, in addition to their basic police instruction, also received advanced paramilitary training. Probatier officers recently graduated by the Hoc Vi√™n Police Academy or the Da Lat Military Academy had to undergo a complete instruction cycle on combat tactics at the ARVN Infantry School for officers in Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c, Saigon, whilst patrolmen who had completed their basic training at Rach Dua also attended a similar program at the ARVN Combat Training Centre and NCO School co-located at Da Lat. At this stage, all combat training was carried out at squad- and platoon-level, which enabled the recruits to attain a good tactical manoeuver capacity in the field. Following this, the would-be Field Policemen ‚Äì including officers and NCOs ‚Äì underwent further eight weeks' of training in CSDC paramilitary skills at the National Police Training Centres of M√£ Lai √Å and Phi Lu√¢t T√¢n. Instruction covered subjects such as jungle warfare, intelligence-gathering operations, law-enforcement and riot control techniques. To upgrade their capabilities, squads and platoons were returned periodically to these training centres for six weeks of unit refresher training, but for most CSDC companies and battalions posted in the provinces their refresher course actually took place at the regional training centres. Additional military \\"on the job\\" training was provided to Field Police units in the field by U.S. Mobile Training Teamsde Lee, Guerrilla Warfare (1985), p. 56. or by Australian advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV).Lyles, Vietnam ANZACs: Australian & New Zealand Troops in Vietnam (2004), p. 7. Selected officer students were also sent to the Royal Malaysian Police Field Force Special Training Centre () at Kentonmen, Ulu Kinta, Perak in Malaysia to attend advanced specialized police and instructor's courses; after graduation, some of these new National Police officers upon returning to South Vietnam would them be posted as Field Police instructors at the Police training centres to pass on their skills to CSDC recruits.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 27. Weapons and equipment The CSDC was lightly armed by military standards, but heavily armed by conventional police standards. Initially, most of its weaponry was surplus World War II/Korean War-vintage ‚Äì the standard issue weapon was the heavy M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, complemented by M1/M2 carbines, M3 and Thompson submachine guns and BAR light machine guns. From 1969, rifles, carbines and submachine guns began to be replaced by the M16 Rifle and although the latter became the CSDC's primary weapon, it never displaced entirely the earlier weaponry.Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), p. 42.

This was a locally produced copy of the American-designed Mitchell 'Clouds' camouflage pattern, which incorporated overlapping dark brown, russet, beige, light brown and ochre cloud-shaped blotches on a tan background. Olive green US M-1951 field jackets or locally made copies in camouflage cloth were issued to Field Police companies operating in the chilly mountain environment of the Central Highlands.Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), p. 37. Headgear Field Police troopers were distinguished from the rest of the National Police by a black beret made of a single piece of wool attached to a black leather rim-band provided with two tightening-straps at the back. Berets were often carefully molded to achieve a pointed shape or 'Cockscomb crest', affected by so many South Vietnamese military personnel since it reportedly gave the wearer a more imposing figure and aggressive 'Shock trooper' or 'Commando' allure.Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud- Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), pp. 39‚Äì40. It was worn French-style pulled to the left, with the National Police cap badge placed above the right eye.Russell and Chappell, Armies of the Vietnam War 2 (1983), p. 35, Plate G1. Originally intended to be worn with the regulation National Police dress uniform in formal occasions, the beret was sometimes seen in the field but it was often replaced by camouflage jungle hats and US M-1 model 1964 steel helmets, the latter worn with a matching 'Clouds' camouflage cover.Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), p. 43.Russell and Chappell, Armies of the Vietnam War 2 (1983), p. 17. A US M-1 Helmet liner painted in shiny black, marked with white-and-red stripes at the sides and the initials \\"TC\\" (Vietnamese: Tu·∫•n Ch√¢n ‚Äì patrol) was worn by Field Police troopers assigned patrol duties or riot control in urban areas.Rottman and Bujeiro, Army of the Republic of Vietnam 1955‚Äì75 (2010), p. 47, Plate H3. Footwear Black leather combat boots were provided by the Americans who issued both the early US Army M-1962 'McNamara' model and the M-1967 model with 'ripple' pattern rubber sole, standard issue in the ARVN. In the field, field policemen generally wore the highly prized US Army Jungle boot and black or green canvas Vietnamese-produced Bata tropical boots, replaced by leather or commercial plastic and rubber sandals while in garrison. Some individuals had zippers put into the insides of their Jungle boots so that they could be laced permanently in a fancy 'airborne' pattern, while the wearer could get into and out of his boots quickly and easily by using the zipper.Tarrius, La Police de Campagne du Sud-Vietnam 1967‚Äì1975 (2005), p. 40.Katcher and Chappell, Armies of the Vietnam War 1962‚Äì1975 (1980), p. 11. Insignia Regarding the placement of insignia, the CSDC had a system of its own, originally adapted from their dress uniform. Most CSDC troopers wore no insignia on their field camouflage uniforms while on operations, or sometimes just their Company patch in either cloth or metal versions in a pocket hanger following the French model suspended from the right shirt pocket.Russell and Chappell, Armies of the Vietnam War 2 (1983), p. 35, Plate G1.

A minor when he succeeded as Earl of Menteith, he was involved in several lawsuits. Biography While his birth year and age is unknown, John Graham was just a boy in 1578, when his father died. Despite a lack of discussion on the topic, there is some controversy among scholars and historians surrounding the facts and circumstances of this young Earl. John Graham was the child of William Graham, 5th Earl of Menteith, and Margaret Graham (n√©e Douglas). Approximately ten days before his death, William Graham allegedly wrote up a will which turned his son, John Graham, over to the care and charge of his brother-in-law George Buchanan. His mother, Margaret, began an unsuccessful action in the courts for custody of John Graham, away from the care of George Buchanan. The case was continued on two accounts in 1578, and was never brought to trial, or the records regarding the custody action have been destroyed or are otherwise unavailable. George Buchanan soon died, and young earl John Graham was sent to live with John Graham of Fintry, in the northern part of Menteith. The facts available from the case of Margaret tend to point to a birthdate of 1571 for John Graham, while the facts available in most other sources point to an approximate birthdate of 1574. James VI of Scotland officially recognized John Graham's claim to the earldom of Menteith in 1583. He would have been 12 years old if born in 1571 and would have been 8 years old if born in 1575. He officially received the lands, despite his minority, in 1587. The young earl requested and received special dispensation from the king to inherit his land before the age of majority, and received those letters of dispensation on 7 October 1587. He was married on 22 October 1587 to Mary, third daughter of Sir Colin Campbell of Glen Orchy.Burke's Family Records (Indexed), page 565. Accessed via ancestry.com paid subscription site, April 2020. Upon his receiving the earldom, the same year that he married, he was again in a lawsuit with his mother over certain lands, which she stated were given to her by her husband, William Graham, the 5th Earl, but were now demanded by John Graham of Fintry, who was tutoring the young Earl at that time. After the lawsuit, a small clash broke out in the lands of Kelwode (Kolwod), where Margaret Graham resided, and the people who brought the fight to Kelwode were the young earl and John Graham of Fintry, along with members of the MacFarland Clan. He would have to be between 11‚Äì16 years old at the time of the invasion, depending on his correct date of birth. It was later written down as history that the young earl was aware of his mother being in Kelwode, and therefore \\"was required to find caution that she should suffer no injury\\". In 1587, the same year of his marriage, and possibly the same year as the attack on Kelwode, he is repeatedly referred to as \\"scarcely 15 years old\\", highlighting a further discrepancy in his possible birthdate. In 1593 he was said to be around 20 years old, and planned to travel to England to see Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Oxford, who he considered a relative.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (1936), pp. 160-1. On 6 March 1597, Earl John Graham entered into a rare legal agreement called a mutual bond of maintenance, with Malcom MacFarlane, Feuar of Gartavertane. Mutual bonds of maintenance can be for a multitude of purposes, but are usually extended when one particular clan needed protection from the other, either from famine, or intruders, or to defend and supply one another in a small wars, battles, or sieges. John Graham died shortly thereafter in December 1598. He had a son and daughter that survived him: * William Graham, 7th Earl of Menteith, and * Christian Graham, who married Sir John Blackadder of Tulliallan, Bt.

In the summer of 490 BC, the 58th year of Duke Jing's reign, the crown prince of Qi died. Although Duke Jing had at least five other grown sons, he decided to make Prince Tu the new crown prince. Because Prince Tu was a young boy and his mother was of a lowly status, Duke Jing ordered the ministers Guo Xia of the Guo clan and Gao Zhang of the Gao clan to support Prince Tu and exile the other princes to the remote city of Lai. Reign Duke Jing died soon afterward in the autumn of 490 BC. Guo and Gao installed Prince Tu on the throne, and the other princes escaped to the nearby states of Wey and Lu. However, the next year the Tian and Bao clans, led by Tian Qi and Bao Mu, staged a coup d'etat and defeated the Gao and Guo clans. Tian Qi brought back Prince Yangsheng, an older half-brother of Prince Tu, from Lu and installed him on the throne, to be known as Duke Dao of Qi.

This enables to prove additivity in short exact sequences for the Gelfand‚ÄìKirillov dimension and finally to prove Bernstein's inequality, which states that the dimension of M must be at least n. This leads to the definition of holonomic D-Modules as those with the minimal dimension n, and these modules play a great role in the geometric Langlands program.

Kundurosaurus is a saurolophine diagnosed by four autapomorphies, unique derived traits. It has a prominent and thick ridge on the lateral side of the nasal that borders caudally the circumnasal depression and invades the caudal plate of the nasal. Its caudal buttress of the proximal head of the scapula is oriented quite laterally, parallel to the pseudoacromial process. The preacetabular process of the ilium is straight and only moderately deflected ventrally by an angle of 160¬∞. It does not reach the level of the plane formed by the bases of the iliac and pubic peduncles. Finally, with Kundurosaurus the axis of the postacetabular process of the ilium is strongly twisted along its length, so that its lateral side progressively faces dorsolaterally. Discovery Endocranial reconstruction of AENM 2/121 based on a CT scan. Kundurosaurus is known from holotype AENM 2/921, a partial, disarticulated skull, including a nearly complete braincase (AENM 2/921 1-2), two quadrates (3-4), squamosal (5), postorbital (6), frontal (7) and parietal (8) bones.

These were found at the same level as the holotype, but may belong to other individuals. All specimens are housed in the Amur Natural History Museum of the Institute of Geology and Nature Management, Russia. Kundurosaurus was first described and named by Pascal Godefroit, Yuri L. Bolotsky and Pascaline Lauters in 2012 and the type species is Kundurosaurus nagornyi. The generic name is derived from Kundur, the type and only known locality, and sauros, \\"lizard\\" in Ancient Greek. The specific name, nagornyi, honors V.A. Nagorny from the Far Eastern Institute of Mineral Resources, for discovering the Kundur locality in 1990. All Kundurosaurus specimens were collected in the Kundur locality. The site belongs to the Wodehouseia spinata ‚Äì Aquilapollenites subtilis palynozone, dating to the Maastrichtian stage, probably the Late Maastrichtian, of the Late Cretaceous period, about 67-66 million years ago. The Kundur site was discovered by Vladimir A. Nagorny in 1990. He collected fossil bones in a road section along the Chita ‚Äì Khabarovsk highway near the village of Kundur and sent them to Yuri L. Bolotsky. Large- scale excavations started at Kundur in 1999. Besides the abundant Olorotitan arharensis material, it has yielded many disarticulated saurolophine specimens. All these specimens were assigned to Kundurosaurus because the describers considered the recovered material to be homogeneous, and suggested that there is no reason to believe that more than one single saurolophine taxon lived in the Kundur area by latest Cretaceous period. Kundur is one of four rich dinosaur localities that have been discovered in the southeastern part (\\"Lower Zeya depression\\") of Zeya-Bureya sedimentary basin, eastern Asia: Jiayin and Wulaga localities are located in the Yuliangze Formation of northern Heilongjiang Province, China and Blagoveschensk and Kundur localities are located in the Udurchukan Formation of southern Amur Region, Russia. In each locality, the dinosaur fauna is largely dominated by lambeosaurine hadrosaurids (Charonosaurus jiayinensis and some non-diagnostic material of Mandschurosaurus amurensis from Jiayin, Sahaliyania from Wulaga, Amurosaurus from Blagoveschensk, and Olorotitan from Kundur), but the indeterminate hadrosaurid Arkharavia, from Kundur, and saurolophine (non-crested or solid- crested) hadrosaurids are also represented (Saurolophus kryschtofovici and other non-diagnostic material of M. amurensis from Jiayin, Wulagasaurus from Wulaga, Kerberosaurus from Blagoveschensk and Kundurosaurus from Kundur). Classification Pelvic girdle of Kundurosaurus: left pubis AENM 2/922-5L (A), left ischium AENM 2/922-3L (B) and the autapomorphic left ilium AENM 2/922-7L (C) in lateral view. A phylogenetic analysis of saurolophines performed by Godefroit, Bolotsky & Lauters (2012) indicates that Kundurosaurus is nested within a clade including Edmontosaurini and Saurolophini, possibly as a sister-taxon of Kerberosaurus. It is based on the data matrix of Prieto- M√°rquez (2010), however Prieto-M√°rquez (2010) recovered Edmontosaurini as a sister-taxon of a monophyletic clade formed by Saurolophini and Kritosaurini while in Godefroit et al. (2012) the Edmontosaurini + Saurolophini clade is well supported and excludes Kritosaurini. The position of Kundurosaurus within Edmontosaurini collapses when fragmentary taxa are excluded from the analysis. In the full analysis, Kundurosaurus is placed as the sister-taxon of Kerberosaurus, which is known from the same region. It may therefore be postulated that K. nagornyi is a second species of the genus Kerberosaurus. This clade, however, is very weakly supported and synapomorphies uniting both taxa can only been found under optimization. Furthermore, although overlapping materials between the genera are limited to their partial skulls, according to Godefroit et al. (2012) Kundurosaurus can be differentiated from Kerberosaurus on the basis of the rostrocaudally longer and more robust dorsal maxillary process, more robust and more curved downwards nasal, much more robust and proportionally higher quadrate and the strong ridge extends obliquely along the lateral side of the exoccipital condyloid in Kundurosaurus. Additionally, the frontals of Kerberosaurus are particularly narrow and do not participate in the orbital margin, the rostral margin of the parietal is depressed around the contact area with the frontals, and Kerberosaurus has hook-like palatine process. Scapula Jugals Right nasals On the other hand, Xing et al. (2014) considered Kundurosaurus nagornyi to be a junior synonym of Kerberosaurus manakini on the basis of their co-occurrence within the same formation and presence of shared characters in their skeletons. The cladogram below follows Godefroit et al. (2012) analysis.

The country had full autonomy, except in areas of defence, foreign policy, and nationality, and participated on a basis of equality with the Netherlands Antilles and the Netherlands itself in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The country became fully independent as the Republic of Suriname on 25 November 1975. History The origin of the administrative reform of 1954 was the 1941 Atlantic Charter (stating the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live, and the desire for a permanent system of general security), which was signed by the Netherlands on 1 January 1942. Changes were proposed in the 7 December 1942 radio speech by Queen Wilhelmina. In this speech, the Queen, on behalf of the Dutch government in exile in London, expressed a desire to review the relations between the Netherlands and its colonies after the end of the war. After liberation, the government would call a conference to agree on a settlement in which the overseas territories could participate in the administration of the Kingdom on the basis of equality. Initially, this speech had propaganda purposes; the Dutch government had the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) in mind, and hoped to appease public opinion in the United States, which had become skeptical towards colonialism. After Indonesia became independent, a federal construction was considered too heavy, as the economies of Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles were insignificant compared to that of the Netherlands. In the Charter, as enacted in 1954, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles each obtained a Minister Plenipotentiary based in the Netherlands, who had the right to participate in Dutch cabinet meetings when it discussed affairs that applied to the Kingdom as a whole, when these affairs pertained directly to Suriname and/or the Netherlands Antilles. Delegates of Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles could participate in sessions of the First and Second Chambers of the States-General. An overseas member could be added to the Council of State when appropriate. According to the Charter, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles were also allowed to alter their \\"Basic Laws\\" (). The right of the two autonomous countries to leave the Kingdom unilaterally, was not recognised; yet it also stipulated that the Charter could be dissolved by mutual consultation. Moving towards independence Whereas the Dutch government initially tried to keep the former colonial possessions under Dutch sovereignty with far-reaching autonomy, this attitude changed in the 1960s, especially after the Netherlands New Guinea crisis of 1962, and the riots in Cura√ßao in 1969. Consensus among virtually all parties in Dutch parliament became that the costly dependencies in the Caribbean, over whose affairs the Dutch government had virtually no control, had to become independent as soon as possible. The Dutch Labour Party added to these political and economic reasonings an ideological argument: it found all remnants of colonialism wrong and a thing of the past. When the Den Uyl cabinet took office in May 1973, it declared that it wanted the Caribbean countries within the Kingdom to become independent during its term in office. The Netherlands Antilles refused to cooperate, but Suriname proved to be a more willing partner. Though the cabinet of Jules Sedney argued that the Netherlands was acting in undue haste, and that independence should have been planned over a longer time period, the newly-elected government of Henck Arron declared, after Den Uyl's invitation, that Suriname would become independent by the end of 1975. After long negotiations, and with a very substantial severance package amounting to 3.5 billion Dutch guilders of Dutch aid, Suriname became independent on 25 November 1975. Dutch Guiana Although the colony and the constituent country have always been officially known as Surinam or Suriname, in both DutchSee for example this royal decree separating Suriname from Cura√ßao and Dependencies (1845). and English,In treaties between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the colony is consistently referred to as the Colony of Surinam, e.g. Convention between Great Britain and the Netherlands, relative to the Emigration of Labourers from India to the Dutch Colony of Surinam, the Accession of the Dutch colonies of Cura√ßao and Surinam to the International Union for the Protection of Industrial Property. the colony was often unofficially and semi-officially referred to as Dutch Guiana (Dutch: Nederlands Guiana) in the 19th and 20th centuries, in an analogy to British Guiana and French Guiana. Using this term for Suriname is problematic, however, as historically Suriname was only one of many Dutch colonies in the Guianas, others being Berbice, Essequibo, Demerara, and Pomeroon, which after being taken over by the United Kingdom in 1814 were united into British Guiana in 1831. Before 1814, the term Dutch Guiana did not describe a distinct political entity, but rather all colonies under Dutch sovereignty taken together.This is e.g. how Jan Jacob Hartsinck uses the term in his Beschryving van Guiana, of de wilde kust in Zuid-America . While referring to post-1814 governors of Suriname as governors of Dutch Guiana seems harmless, it is problematic doing the same for the pre-1814 governors, as that would imply that they had jurisdiction over the other Dutch colonies in the Guianas, which they had not.

Surinam was a Dutch colony from 26 February 1667, when Dutch forces captured Francis Willoughby's English colony during the Second Anglo- Dutch War, until 15 December 1954, when Surinam became a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The status quo of Dutch sovereignty over Surinam, and English sovereignty over New Netherland, which it had conquered in 1664, was kept in the Treaty of Breda of 31 July 1667, and again confirmed in the Treaty of Westminster of 1674. After the other Dutch colonies in the Guianas, i.e., Berbice, Essequibo, Demerara, and Pomeroon, were lost to the British in 1814, the remaining colony of Surinam was often referred to as Dutch Guiana, especially after 1831, when the British merged Berbice, Essequibo, and Demerara into British Guiana. As the term Dutch Guiana was used in the 17th and 18th centuries to refer to all Dutch colonies in the Guianas, this use of the term can be confusing (see below).  History  An illustration of a Dutch plantation owner and slave from William Blake's illustrations of the work of John Gabriel Stedman, first published in 1792‚Äì1794 The colonization of Surinam is marked by slavery. Plantations relied on slave labour, mostly supplied by the Dutch West India Company from its trading posts in West Africa, to produce their crops. Sugar, cotton, and indigo were the main goods exported from the colony to the Netherlands until the early 18th century, when coffee became the single most important export product of Surinam. Planters' treatment of the slaves was notoriously bad. The historian C.R. Boxer wrote that \\"man's inhumanity to man just about reached its limits in Surinam\\", and many slaves escaped the plantations. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange crashed in 1773, which dealt a severe blow to the plantation economy that was further exacerbated by the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807. This abolition was adopted by William I of the Netherlands, who signed a royal decree in this regard in June 1814, and who concluded the Anglo-Dutch Slave Trade Treaty in May 1818. Many plantations went bankrupt as a consequence of the abolition of slave trade. Without supply of slaves, many plantations were merged to increase efficiency.  Abolition of slavery  Slavery was eventually abolished on 1 July 1863, although slaves were only released after a ten-year transitory period in 1873. This spurred the immigration of indentured labourers from British India, after a treaty to that effect had been signed between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in 1870. Apart from immigration from British India, Javanese workers from the Dutch East Indies were also contracted to work on plantations in Surinam. At the same time, a largely unsuccessful attempt to colonize Surinam with impoverished farmers from the Netherlands was started as well.  20th century  In the 20th century, the natural resources of Surinam, which include rubber, gold and bauxite, were exploited. The gold rush that followed the discovery of gold on the banks of the Lawa River spurred the construction of the Lawa Railway in 1902, although construction was halted after gold production proved disappointing. In 1916, the U.S. aluminium company Alcoa began mining bauxite on the banks of the Cottica River, near the village of Moengo. In 1938, the company built an aluminium smelter in Paranam. Partly due to the importance of Surinamese aluminium for the allied war effort, United States troops occupied Surinam under an agreement with the Dutch government in exile on 23 November 1941. Under the provisions of the Atlantic Charter of August 1941, the Dutch government in exile promised to end the colonial relations between the Netherlands and its overseas possessions, promising them far-reaching autonomy and self-rule. This was eventually accomplished by the proclamation of the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 15 December 1954, which constituted a Kingdom in which the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Suriname participated on a basis of equality. In 1975, Suriname left the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become the independent country of Suriname.  Administration  From 1683, the colony was governed by the Society of Suriname, a company composed of three equal shareholders, being the city of Amsterdam, the family Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck, and the Dutch West India Company. Although the organization and administration was of the colony was limited to these three shareholders, all citizens of the Dutch Republic were free to trade with Suriname.Meiden, G.W. (2008) Betwist Bestuur. De eerste eeuw bestuurlijke ruzies in Suriname 1651-1753, p. 11. Also, the planters were consulted in a Council of Police, which was a unique feature among the colonies of Guiana.Buddingh, H. (1995) Geschiedenis van Suriname, p. 26. In November 1795, the Society was nationalized by the Batavian Republic. From then on until 1954, the Batavian Republic and its legal successors (the Kingdom of Holland and the Kingdom of the Netherlands) governed the territory as a national colony, barring a period of British occupation between 1799 and 1802, and between 1804 and 1816. After the Batavian Republic took over in 1795, the Dutch government issued various government regulations for Suriname (Dutch: Regeringsreglement voor Suriname), establishing the government of the colony. In 1865, a new government regulation replaced the previous regulation of 1832, which theoretically gave Suriname some limited self-rule. The colonial elite was given the right to elect a Colonial Council (Dutch: Koloniale Raad) which would co-govern the colony together with the Governor- General appointed by the Dutch crown. Among others, the Colonial Council was allowed to decide over the colony's budget, which was subject to approval by the Dutch crown, but which did not see any involvement of Dutch parliament. Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, the governor of Suriname in 1923 In the wake of the 1922 Dutch constitutional revision, in which the term \\"colony\\" was replaced by \\"overseas territory\\", the 1865 government regulation was replaced by the Basic Law of Suriname (Dutch: Staatsregeling van Suriname) on 1 April 1937. This Basic Law renamed the Colonial Council to Estates of Suriname (Dutch: Staten van Suriname) and increased the membership from 13 to 15. After the Second World War, during which the Dutch government in exile had pledged to review the relationship between the Netherlands and its colonies, the Basic Law was heavily revised. In March 1948, revisions to the Basic Law were adopted by Dutch parliament, which introduced universal suffrage for both men and women, which increased the membership of the Estates from 15 to 21, and which introduced a College of General Government (Dutch: College van Algemeen Bestuur) which was to assist the Governor in the everyday government of the colony, and which was the precursor to the Cabinet of Ministers. The new constitution took effect in July 1948.  Military  In 1868 the Dutch government created the Troepenmacht in Suriname (TRIS) which served as the Dutch colonial army in Suriname.De historie van de TRIS: http://www.trisonline.nl/de-tris/de-historie-van-de-tris/ This meant that like the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in the Dutch East Indies, TRIS fell under the responsibility of the Dutch Ministry of Colonies, instead of the Dutch Ministry of Defense. The size of the TRIS army was, however, small, compared to the KNIL army for the former colony of Indonesia, it consisted of two infantry and two artillery companies. In total 636 soldiers served in the TRIS army. These soldiers were tasked with patrolling and policing duties within the Dutch colony of Surinam.Ibidem.

The church was founded upon the amalgamation of The Church of the Epiphany and The Church of St. Mark, Parkdale in 1983.  The Church of St. Mark, Parkdale  St. Mark, Parkdale was set apart as an independent parish on July 1, 1876. Prior to this the area had been part of St. Anne's parish. The first services were held on December 16, 1877 in a small frame building built on the church's present site on Cowan Avenue, below Queen Street. The lot cost $900 and the 25 ft x 15 ft building cost a further $600. The cornerstone of the current building was laid by the Bishop of Toronto on October 11, 1880. The church was opened and dedicated on January 20, 1881. As a result of significant population growth in Parkdale in the 1880s, the church grew from 40 families in 1880 to 320 in 1887 and the need for another parish was recognized.  The Church of the Epiphany  Construction of the Church of the Epiphany took place at the corner of Queen Street and Beaty Avenue in 1887 and the first services were held on November 18 of that year. This building is still present south of the newer sanctuary building which was erected and opened on March 31, 1911. The Church of the Epiphany had a close association with Wycliffe College. Its founding rector, Rev. Bernard Bryan, had been one of the nine men who constituted the first class at Wycliffe in 1877. This connection continued when in 1959 the Church of the Epiphany's rector, the Rev. Leslie Hunt, was appointed Principal of Wycliffe College. This connection gave the Church of the Epiphany an evangelical orientation.  Amalgamation  As a result of shifting demographics in Parkdale, the Executive committee of the Diocese of Toronto confirmed the amalgamation of the parishes and congregations of the Church of the Epiphany and the Church of St. Mark, Parkdale on January 27, 1983. On February 8 of that year, the amalgamated vestry voted to locate at the Church of St. Mark, Parkdale and to accept an offer from the Maronite Church to purchase the Church of the Epiphany's buildings.

His personal name was L√º Yangsheng (ÂëÇÈôΩÁîü), ancestral name Jiang (Âßú), and Duke Dao was his posthumous title. Before ascending the throne he was known as Prince Yangsheng. Accession to the throne Prince Yangsheng was a middle son of Duke Jing of Qi. In the summer of 490 BC, the 58th year of Duke Jing's reign, the crown prince of Qi died. Although Duke Jing had at least five other grown sons, he made Prince Tu, his youngest son by his favourite concubine Yu Si, the new crown prince. Because Prince Tu was a young boy and his mother was of a lowly status, Duke Jing ordered the ministers Guo Xia of the Guo clan and Gao Zhang of the Gao clan to support Prince Tu and exile the other princes to the remote city of Lai. Duke Jing died soon afterward in the autumn of 490 BC. Guo and Gao installed Prince Tu on the throne, and the other princes escaped abroad. Yangsheng fled to the neighbouring State of Lu. However, the next year the Tian and Bao clans led by Tian Qi and Bao Mu staged a coup d'etat and defeated the Gao and Guo clans. Tian Qi brought back Yangsheng from Lu and installed him on the throne, to be known as Duke Dao of Qi. Bao Mu was reluctant to depose Prince Tu but dared not oppose Tian. Duke Dao soon killed Prince Tu, who is posthumously known as An Ruzi. The Tian clan would from then on increasingly dominate the power of Qi, eventually replacing the House of Jiang as monarchs of Qi in 386 BC. Battle with Lu When Duke Dao was exiled in the State of Lu, he married Ji Ji (Â≠£Âß¨), younger sister of Ji Kangzi (Â≠£Â∫∑Â≠ê), who was the leader of the Ji clan, one of the three clans that controlled the power of Lu. After Duke Dao returned to Qi and ascended the throne, he sent for his wife in Lu. When Duke Dao was away, however, Ji Ji had an adulterous relationship with her uncle Ji Fanghou (Â≠£È≠¥‰æØ). Afraid that Duke Dao might discover his wife's infidelity, Lu refused to send Ji Ji to Qi. Enraged by Lu's refusal to send his wife, in 487 BC Duke Dao dispatched Bao Mu to invade Lu with the Qi army, taking the cities of Huan (ËÆô) and Chan (Èó°). Lu was forced to send Ji Ji to Qi, and Qi returned the two cities to Lu. In the same year Duke Dao killed Bao Mu for trying to incite rebellion among the Qi princes. Death In 485 BC, the fourth year of Duke Dao's reign, the states of Wu, Lu, Zhu and Tan (ÈÉØ) invaded Qi. Fuchai, the king of Wu, was the commander of the allied forces as Wu was at the time the most powerful state of China. By the time the invading forces reached southern Qi, Duke Dao had been killed by a Qi official, probably Tian Heng, who had succeeded his father Tian Qi as leader of the Tian clan. When the obituary reached King Fuchai, he suspended the campaign and for three days cried outside the army camp, according to the etiquette of the time. After the mourning period was over, Fuchai launched a naval attack on Qi, but was defeated and forced to retreat. Duke Dao's son Prince Ren subsequently ascended the throne, to be known as Duke Jian of Qi.

Philpott, who had made several media appearances because of his benefits-funded lifestyle and polyamorous relationships, was sentenced to life imprisonment for their manslaughter. He had first come to prominence in the British media as a result of his large family (having fathered seventeen children by various women), and his reliance on state benefits. In April 2013, following an eight- week trial, he and his wife Mairead, together with their friend Paul Mosley, were found guilty of the manslaughter of the six children. Philpott was given a life sentence with a minimum term of fifteen years' imprisonment. Psychologist Glenn Wilson described Philpott as clinically a \\"psychopath\\" and \\"exhibitionist\\" with \\"antisocial personality disorder.\\" Relationships and habitual violence Mick Philpott's attitude to women has been described as \\"controlling\\", \\"domineering\\", \\"violent\\" and \\"manipulative\\". In July 1978, aged 21, Philpott attempted to murder Kim Hill, his girlfriend of two years; their relationship began when she was aged 15. He had previously shot Hill in the groin with a crossbow because he felt her dress had been too short, and had cracked her kneecap with a hammer when she paid too much attention to a baby she had been minding. Philpott attempted to kill Hill by stabbing her over a dozen times as she was lying in bed, because she sent him a letter saying she was leaving him. He also stabbed Hill's mother when she came to her daughter's aid. Hill suffered collapsed lungs and a punctured bladder, kidney and liver. Philpott was convicted of attempted murder of Hill, and grievous bodily harm with intent against her mother, and was sentenced to seven years in prison in December 1978. Philpott was released after three years and two months.Alan White \\"Was this tragedy really a \\"vile product\\" of Welfare UK?\\", New Statesman, 3 April 2013 Philpott married Pamela Lomax in 1986. He had three children with Lomax, two sons and a daughter. Lomax said that Philpott was controlling, and she prayed he would move on to someone else. Her wish was fulfilled when Philpott met Heather Kehoe, then aged 14, in Rainworth, Nottinghamshire; Philpott was 37. On her 16th birthday, Kehoe ran away from her parents to live with Philpott. She gave birth to two children, both boys, in quick succession, but Philpott beat Kehoe because he wanted a daughter. Kehoe described Philpott teaching his older sons to be violent towards her. Philpott wanted Kehoe to produce more children, but she did not conceive again. In 1991, he was given a two-year conditional discharge for assault occasioning actual bodily harm after headbutting a colleague. In 2000, Philpott met Mairead Duffy, a 19-year-old single mother born in England to an Irish family, who had left a previous volatile relationship. Duffy moved into Philpott's house shortly after, and the couple married in May 2003. In 2001, Philpott met Lisa Willis, a 16-year-old orphan and single mother, who became his mistress. Philpott invited Willis to move into his council house, which was larger than hers, in 2002. Willis served as bridesmaid at Philpott and Duffy's wedding. On 23 December 2002, having left Philpott, Kehoe gained legal custody of her two children. In 2010, Philpott was given a police caution for slapping Mairead and dragging her outside by her hair. Benefits lifestyle In 2006, Philpott was being heavily criticised in the UK tabloid media when he requested a larger council house for his family, which then consisted of his wife Mairead, then aged 25; his mistress Lisa Willis, then 22; and four children born to Mairead, three to Willis, and Willis's child fathered prior to meeting him. The 1978 conviction for attempted murder was revealed at this time. After Willis gave birth to her fourth child by Philpott, the press revealed that both she and Mairead were expecting babies, due in March 2007. Before their birth, Philpott appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show to defend his lifestyle, saying that he would like to marry one woman and divorce the other, and added that he would have a vasectomy. Philpott appeared in an episode of the ITV documentary series Ann Widdecombe Versus (2007), in which the then Conservative minister Ann Widdecombe spent a week with him and tried to persuade him to change his lifestyle. Nancy Banks-Smith in The Guardian reported that Widdecombe gave him \\"a large slice of her mind\\", but \\"decamped\\" rather than sleep in his caravan.Nancy Bank-Smith \\"Last night's TV: The Secret Life of the Motorway\\", The Guardian, 23 August 2007 Widdecombe found Philpott three jobs, one of which was with a barrel-making firm, but he did not turn up for work on the first day and the job fell through. In the documentary, Philpott was shown to be living in a caravan in his garden, in which his wife and mistress would alternate in spending nights with him. Widdecombe said that Philpott did not care about anyone and that he used the word \\"bitch\\" to refer to both his wife and his mistress. Widdecombe also said she noticed that none of his children sought affection from him.This Morning, 3 April 2013. Further convictions It was revealed during Philpott's manslaughter trial that Mairead became pregnant by another man whilst the couple were dogging, an activity in which they began to participate during 2011. Mairead had an abortion at Philpott's instruction. A court hearing a week before the fire concerned a road rage incident during November 2011 in which Philpott had punched another driver,\\"Mick Philpott faced road rage charge for punching motorist\\", telegraph.co.uk, 3 April 2013 for which he had pleaded guilty to common assault,\\"Fire deaths: Philpott sentencing postponed\\", Channel 4 News, 3 April 2013 but denied dangerous driving. At the hearing, Philpott was bailed and was awaiting trial.Dave Higgins \\"Revealed: Mick Philpott faced road rage charge\\", The Independent, 3 April 2013 Philpott and Willis became estranged in February 2012, and she left to live with her sister and brother-in-law, along with her four children by Philpott and her son from a previous relationship. Arson attack=Fire On 11 May 2012, the Philpott family's home at 18 Victory Road, Osmaston, Derby, was seriously damaged by fire at around 4am. Five children‚ÄîJade (10), John (9), Jack (7), Jesse (6) and Jayden (5) Philpott, who had been asleep upstairs‚Äîall died at the scene, while their half-brother, Duwayne Philpott (13), died in hospital two days later. All of these deaths were caused by excessive smoke inhalation. In the days following the fire, the family's local Catholic church held memorial services. On 16 May, Philpott and his wife held an emotional news conference, in which they purported to describe the events concerning the fire. A charity, Catch Me When I Fall, was set up by local residents to help the family of the children. A book of condolence at Derby Cathedral was later signed by hundreds of people. A fund to pay for the funerals raised over ¬£11,000 by members of the public living in the same area as the Philpotts. The children's joint funeral took place on 22 June 2012 at St Mary's Church, Derby. Criminal investigation On 14 May, police stated that petrol had been found inside the letterbox to the Philpott residence, thus sparking a murder investigation. Willis, who had a court hearing over custody of her children with Philpott scheduled on the morning of the fire, was initially arrested on suspicion of murder along with her brother-in-law Ian Cousins, but both were released without charge. Meanwhile, witnesses reported that Philpott behaved strangely for someone who had recently lost several of his children,Ben Quinn \\"Philpott relatives recount bizarre behaviour in aftermath of house fire\\", guardian.co.uk, 3 April 2013 and appeared to like the media attention.Jonathan Brown \\"Philpott fire trial: Guilty of manslaughter, but circumstances of the blaze remain largely unknown\\", The Independent, 2 April 2013 The police bugged the Philpotts' hotel room and gained evidence confirming the couple were responsible for the fire, including the involvement of friend Paul Mosley, with whom Mairead was heard engaging in a sex act.Sandra Laville and Vikram Dodd \\"Mick and Mairead Philpott convicted of manslaughter over Derby house fire\\", guardian.co.uk, 2 April 2013 Philpott and Mairead were arrested on suspicion of murder on 28 May 2012. After seeking additional time for questioning, the couple were charged with murder on 30 May 2012. A discarded petrol container and glove had been found near the house, and in November forensic investigators discovered that the clothes of the Philpotts and Mosley had petrol on them.\\"Derby fire deaths: How police uncovered Mick Philpott's lies\\", BBC News, 4 April 2013 On 5 November, Mosley was arrested and charged with murder; this charge was later downgraded to manslaughter. Mosley had previously been arrested in the enquiry and was released on bail in June 2012. The charges against Philpott and Mairead were also reduced to manslaughter, as it was decided that the couple had not intended to kill their children. Instead, they had wanted to frame Willis for the fire, win back custody of the children and continue to claim benefits for them. Trial and sentencing The trial commenced at Nottingham Crown Court on 12 February 2013. Richard Latham QC led the prosecution on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service. Anthony Orchard QC led the defence for Philpott, Sean Smith QC led the defence for Mairead, and Benjamin Nolan QC led the defence for Mosley. On 2 April, Mick and Mairead, along with Mosley, were each found guilty of the manslaughter of the six children. Sentencing was due to take place on 3 April, but was postponed as the judge, Mrs Justice Thirlwall, wanted more time to consider the sentence. Philpott's previous criminal convictions, which had not been revealed to the jury, were disclosed at this point. On 4 April, Philpott was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum tariff of fifteen years, while Mairead and Mosley were each sentenced to seventeen years (of which they will serve at least half before any release on licence).Rob Williams \\"Disturbingly dangerous... no moral compass... the driving force. Judge hands Michael Philpott a life sentence\\", The Independent, 4 April 2013 On 29 November, an appeal by Mairead against the length of her sentence (not the verdict) was heard. The grounds of the appeal were mainly that Mairead was under the control of her husband and could not exercise a free choice in her conduct; the appeal was dismissed.

It is situated at 480 m elevation on thesouthern slope of the Chlomo mountain. It is 8 km southeast of Atalanti and 12 km northeast of Orchomenos. Its main industry is agriculture. The village takes its name from the ancient town Cyrtone. History The area around Kyrtoni was already inhabited during the Neolithic era (7000-3200/3100 BC). The name of the Neolithic settlement is unknown. There was also activity around Kyrtoni during the Archaic period (800-480 BC). The main occupations of the inhabitants were agriculture, animal husbandry and pottery. In the 2nd century CE, Pausanias described Cyrtones, also Cyrtone, as a town of ancient Boeotia situated east of Lake Copais, on a mountain 20 stades from Hyettus.

He was Professor Emeritus of History and Historical Theory at Staffordshire University. He was also Visiting Professor at the University of Chichester. His argument is that prior to engaging with the past historians need to acknowledge that the past and history do not share the same ontic and epistemic space. He suggests that the past is the time before our perpetual present and 'history' is that range of authored narratives we substitute for it. Munslow suggests that the consequences of this argument are substantial and not the least among them being the situation that we can only engage with the aesthetics of 'historying' because we cannot access the ontic and epistemic nature of the past. The way to avoid that situation is to fuse ‚Äì or as he argues - the historian should not (con)fuse the past with history. The past is the 'before now' and the past cannot anticipate the future. He accepts that this may seem ironic ‚Äì and happily it is ‚Äì the reason being that history is a singularly unprivileged authorial act undertaken in the perpetual present about the ineffable past. He is the author of a number of texts on the philosophy of history including 'Discourse and Culture: The Creation of America, 1870-1920' (1992), 'Deconstructing History' (1997), 'The New History' (2003), 'Narrative and History' (2007, Second Edition 2018), 'The Future of History' (2010), 'A History of History' (2012) and 'Authoring the Past' (2013).

At that time, Duncan Platt was part of the Student Representative Council, and at the end of 2010, he came to hear about this opportunity. However, because of his position in the SRC, he wasn't allowed to chair a Day House, and thus looked for another candidate who would.

He was active in the suppression of the Covenanters, but struggled with the burden of debts on his estates. On his death in 1694 his titles became extinct. Biography William Graham was the son of John Graham, master of Menteith, and Lady Mary Keith. Upon the death of his grandfather, William Graham, 7th Earl of Menteith, in 1661, William Graham became 8th Earl of Menteith and 2nd Earl of Airth. Because most of his lands were in the hands of creditors due to the actions of his grandfather, he did not wish to inherit the earldom, and for several years he lived in London, seeking from Charles II the money that was allegedly owed to his grandfather by Charles I. For his efforts, he gained the sum of 500 pounds, but this barely covered the interest on the mortgages held by the creditors. Bridge of Aberfoyle He took an active part in opposing the Covenanters throughout his earldom. In 1671, shortly after gaining the power to take such actions against criminals and debtors within his earldom, he obtained an arrest warrant for John Graham of Duchray for disobeying the orders of the king by failing to repay a debt. Learning that Thomas Graham of Duchray (the son of John Graham of Duchray) was to attend a baptism, the Earl of Airth took advantage of this family gathering to execute his warrant. And so on 13 February 1671, the Earl and Alexander Muschet, along with a well armed party, made their way to the bridge to arrest John Graham of Duchray who was known to be sympathetic to the Covenanters, and who likely politically opposed the 7th Earl. John Graham of Duchray held papers of protection from the king, and said \\"What dar ye do? This is all your masters\\", but the papers held protection from removal from certain lands, and not from a civil debt. The son of Thomas Graham of Duchray, ripe for the christening at the kirk in Aberfoyle in 1671, was placed upon the ground and the Duchray party prepared their swords, guns, and muskets, avowing that half of the Earl's party would be killed and the other half would drown. It is said that the Earl was narrowly missed by several bullets, and one of the Earl's party, a Robert MacFarlane, lost two of his fingers. John Graham of Duchray was placed in the Edinburgh Tolbooth. The end of Menteith and Airth His creditors compelled him to take the earldom, and in 1670, they enforced their claims. In about 1679, the Earl of Airth entered into an agreement with the Marquess of Montrose, whereby the Earldom of Menteith was to be granted to him provided that he should marry Helen or Elanor Graham, the Earl's cousins. The Marquess of Montrose chose not to marry one of the Earl's cousins, and instead gained the right to the earldom through Charles II, and this transfer all but extinguished the Earldom of Menteith. He divorced his wife Anna in 1685, who accused him of bigamy and adultery. Although he had been dispossessed of the majority of rights to earldom over Menteith, William Graham continued as the Earl of Airth until his death in 1694, and he died without leaving any issue. The title of Earl of Menteith was later assumed in 1744, by a William Graham, who was the great- grandson of Elizabeth Graham, the Earl's sister.

He was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) in exile from 1932 until 1937 and also a prominent member of the Comintern. Gorkiƒá was executed by the NKVD in the Soviet Union during the Great Purge.  Early life = Family  Gorkiƒá was born Josef ƒåi≈æinsk√Ω in 1904 into a Czech family from Austria-Hungary that had settled in Sarajevo five years earlier in 1899. At the time, Bosnia-Herzegovina was still officially a vilayet within the Ottoman Empire though in actuality it was run as an occupational zone and a de facto part of Austria-Hungary. His father, V√°clav ƒåi≈æinsk√Ω was an upholster who earlier held membership in the Social Democratic Party of Czechoslovakia. After a short holiday in his hometown, he brought his wife, Gorkiƒá's mother, Antonija Mimerova to Bosnia and Herzegovina. She worked as a seamstress. In Bosnia and Herzegovina his father worked for the Austrian-Hungarian administration. Gorkiƒá was born in Sarajevo in 1904; his older brother Ladislav (1901) was a machinist and younger brother Bohumil was an architect who lived in Czechoslovakia until 1986. In 1921, Gorkiƒá's family was deported back to Czechoslovakia, after his father was involved in a strike and accusations of being a communist and a serbophobe. Gorkiƒá was also previously arrested for communist activity, which contributed to his family's deportation.  Education  Gorkiƒá entered elementary school in Bosanski Brod in 1910. As a good student, he continued high school education in Derventa, but soon left the school because of the World War. In order to avoid losing an academic year, he tried to enter high school in Slavonski Brod, but this school was also closed, so he studied grade five privately. In 1915, Gorkiƒá succeeded in starting grade six in High People's Students' School, a lower high school, entering its second grade. In 1918 he returned to Sarajevo and took entrance exam in order to enroll in the Sarajevo Commerce Academy.  Early activity  During a time spent in Commercial Academy, Gorkiƒá joined the Organization of Intellectual Workers as an fifteen- year-old. Gorkiƒá and other members of the organisation had meetings in Workers' Home, where they read works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, as well as Miroslav Krle≈æa's revolutionary magazine \\"Plamen\\". On 1 May 1919 he was arrested along with some of his comrades. On 4 December 1919, Young Communist League of Yugoslavia (SKOJ) was established in Sarajevo; Gorkiƒá was elected to its leadership. In 1921, after First Congress of SKOJ, it was decided that SKOJ will be separated on two branches, apprentices' and students' branch. Gorkiƒá was named secretary of students' branch. In one newspaper article from 14 October. Gorkiƒá used his pseudonym for the very first time. On 28 November 1920, he held a motivational speech in Derventa for members of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) and called them to vote for leaders of the KPJ. In December 1920, Gorkiƒá held teachings in Workers' Home in Sarajevo, and soon become one of the most active communists. On the night of 29/30 December, King Alexander of Yugoslavia proclaimed Obznana, a proclamation in which he forbade further activity of the KPJ. Thousands of communists were arrested and their organisations broken. After proclamation of Obznana, KPJ and SKOJ were scattered. Gorkiƒá played a key role in reorganisation of the KPJ and SKOJ. He became Secretary of the Regional Committee of the SKOJ. In a report to KPJ's congress held in Vienna in 1922, Gorkiƒá stated that before Obznana, regional SKOJ had 300 members, and after Obznana regional SKOJ did not have a single member, they only maintained contacts. He and his associates established an illegal organization as a core for future organizing. Soon, they had been provided with a hectograph to multiply propaganda leaflets. Gorkiƒá was assigned to work with the leaflets. Before that, in 1921, he wrote to his illegal organisation in Derventa and this letter was found by the police. In the letter, Gorkiƒá wrote in detail about organisation's activity and meeting place that was supposed to be held in Belgrade. However, the meeting never took place, because a communist, Spasoje Steviƒá, made a failed assassination attempt on King Alexander, who was at the time, a regent. In July 1921 Gorkiƒá visited Belgrade with his friend, Maks Schwarz, but, after they returned to Brod, both of them were arrested on 29 July. Gorkiƒá stated to the police that he did not go to Belgrade because of the conference, but for education. Gorkiƒá's activity was observed by the police for a longer period. Gorkiƒá was heard by police on 2 August and spent six months in prison, when he was bailed out by the party along with other imprisoned communists. He was expelled from Commercial Academy when he was in third grade. He did not return home to his parents, but instead, continued his political activity. In time, while he was still imprisoned, Gorkiƒá's family was deported back to Czechoslovakia. His father had been accused of communism and anti-Serb sentiment. After Gorkiƒá had been released from prison, he started to work as an editor of Sarajevan workers' magazine \\"Radniƒçko jedinstvo\\" (Workers' Unity). As an editor, he wrote about the international political scene. In 1923, Gorkiƒá was employed in another magazine, named \\"Narod\\" (The People). He worked in this magazine until he left the country. During all that time, he was under police surveillance. After his release in 1922, Gorkiƒá was once again under police investigation and it was planned by the police to deport him also once the investigation ended. His travel abroad was forbidden, however, he successfully entered and left the country several times. Actually, he was a delegate on first two illegal conferences held in 1922 and 1923. The First Conference was held in Vienna between 3 and 17 April 1922, where Gorkiƒá participated as a delegate for Bosnia. With other members of Bosnian delegation, Gorkiƒá arrived to Austria 16 days earlier, as they were misinformed. KPJ's conferences in Vienna played a significant role in history of KPJ. The Deputy Executive Committee was founded to lead members of the party that stayed in country after Alexander's Obznana forbid future activity of the KPJ. Other members emigrated. On Viennese first conference held in September 1921, those in emigration founded Emigration Committee as leading organ of the party. By such act, KPJ actually had two leaderships, one operating in Belgrade while other in Vienna. Majority of members in emigration expressed their wishes to abolish Emigration Committee, while a Montenegrin, Sima Markoviƒá, disapproved that and named himself leader of the Emigration Committee. To avoid disagreement, members of the KPJ agreed to solve problems on a conference, that was held in April 1922. Gorkiƒá was especially active on this conference. Some members proposed that members of KPJ's youth wing, the SKOJ, should also vote. This proposition passed with 13 votes against 12; Gorkiƒá's vote was among those 12. On VIII session held on 10 July 1922, Gorkiƒá was elected to a commission that would deal with political, organization and union matters. On this very session, a decision was made to criticize the activity of Markoviƒá and his associate Ilija Milkiƒá, but not to punish them. It was stated that both of them justified their mistakes. Gorkiƒá disagreed with this decision and asked for a withdrawal of statement that they \\"justified their mistakes\\". Markoviƒá and Milkiƒá left the session, so Gorkiƒá argued that decision should be made by the Comintern. Also, Gorkiƒá disagreed on question of whether the Emigration Committee should exist. The voting was made on the matter of whether the majority of leadership be stationed in Belgrade. There was 16 votes for yes and 2 were against ‚Äì Gorkiƒá and Mark voted and expressed that the whole leadership should be in Belgrade. After Gorkiƒá returned to Sarajevo in May 1923, he continued to work for the \\"Narod\\" and the \\"Radniƒçko jednistvo\\" magazines. Soon, he was once again arrested for carrying communist literature and was sentenced on 20 days in prison. The judge stated that police should take care that Gorkiƒá and his associate not leave the country, however, Gorkiƒá emigrated in July 1923, after which he only briefly returned in Yugoslavia for several times. Police were unable to find out when Gorkiƒá left Yugoslavia. Before that, Gorkiƒá stayed in Zagreb under the pretext that he attended Export Academy, which enabled him to leave the country. On 24 March 1924, police made a warrant for Gorkiƒá and another group of communists in Sarajevo. When the group was under trial in 1925, Gorkiƒá was in Moscow. Gorkiƒá left Sarajevo eight months before his absence was noticed by the police. He left Yugoslavia on 9 May 1924 in order to participate at the Second Conference of the KPJ in Vienna. In autumn 1925 police became interested in Gorkiƒá for a second time after it was found out that Gorkiƒá was once again involved in illegal doings. In October 1925, the police authorities informed the prefect of Sarajevo region that Gorkiƒá was in Belgrade at the end of June 1925 as a courier from Moscow. Prefect of Sarajeo informed authorities in Belgrade to arrest Gorkiƒá if he enters Yugoslavia one more time. Yugoslav police were unable to arrest him and on 12 March 1926 they condemned Gorkiƒá once again while he was in absence. He was charged with 1250 Yugoslav dinar. His other two colleagues were charged as well. All three of them later complained about the court's decision via lawyer in Sarajevo. On 11 March 1930 the court made a decision to decline their complaint as they were considered fugitives. He became member of the SKOJ's Central Committee in 1924, but was soon expelled from the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, after which he became representative of the KPJ in the Comintern in Moscow. After three years working as a representative, he was elected to the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International in Moscow (ECCI) in 1927. At the same time he worked in ECCI's secretariat as a commissioner for the Balkan countries. As a member of party, Gorkiƒá traveled a lot: in Austria, Germany and Czechoslovakia. In Germany he married Betty Nikolayevna Glan, also member of the Comintern, and had a daughter named Jelena with her. At the beginning of 1928 he was elected Secretary of the Communist International of Moscow, and in summer he was elected to Comintern's International Control Commission. In 1930 he was Comintern's representative in the British Communist Party. At the same time, he worked for the KPJ and Balkan Secretariat of the Comintern headed by Georgi Dimitrov. From 1928 until 1931, Gorkiƒá was also an associate of Nemanja Borjan.  Leader of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia  Nikolai Bukharin, Gorkiƒá's mentor The Communist Party of Yugoslavia was amongst the most disciplined communist parties within the Comintern. At the end of the 1920s, the KPJ came under a faction struggle between the so-called left-wing and the right-wing. The left-wing was subordinated to the Comintern, while the right-wing wanted to secede from the Comintern with its special views. It was often called revisionist faction. Later, this struggle grew into clashes, similar to those that Joseph Stalin led with Trotskyists and Bukharinists. In 1932, under mentorship of Nikolai Bukharin, Gorkiƒá was named general secretary of the KPJ under the pseudonym Sommer. Gorkiƒá returned to Yugoslavia several times, but when he was elected as general secretary of the KPJ, he was forbidden from entering Yugoslavia for safety reasons. From 1932 he led Central Committee of the KPJ in exile, in Vienna, Paris, and Moscow. In November 1932 in the text published in the official gazette of the KPJ, Gorkiƒá criticised leaders of communists from Dalmatia because they did not join Usta≈°e during the Velebit uprising. In 1933, it was decided that communist parties in the Soviet Union must be purged in order to raise ideological strength. Those purges were mandatory for the KPJ as well. On 28 February 1933, the Central Committee of the KPJ made a resolution about the results of the purge. The reason for that was conflict with ƒêuka Cvijiƒá (aka Kirsch), who opposed intervention of other communist parties in internal policy of the KPJ. The Central Committee of the KPJ reacted very fiercely on Cvijiƒá's accusations and claimed that the purge was not the reason for the organisational breakdown of the KPJ, but breakdown of certain persons who were \\"undisciplined, and lacked verification of loyalty to the Comintern,\\" and \\"liquidation of fractionism within the KPJ.\\" One of the reasons for ƒêajiƒá's accusation was because his wife, Tatjana Mariniƒá, was expelled from the KPJ, as she claimed that the KPJ's purge did not meet conditions of the Comintern. Cvijiƒá himself was also investigated. In November‚ÄìDecember 1933, Gorkiƒá travelled to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to prepare for the fourth Party Conference. In the process, in July 1934, he named Josip Broz Tito to the temporary leadership and he, himself, didn't participate at the conference held in Ljubljana in December 1934. Gorkiƒá was a dominant figure in the KPJ and he succeeded in reviving the party. The meeting of the Transitional Leadership of the KPJ, composed by Gorkiƒá, Vladimir ƒÜopiƒá and Blagoje Paroviƒá, held a meeting on 26 April 1933, where it was stated that the purge was \\"absolutely correct and made on time,\\" claiming that the leadership of the KPJ completed its task. The leadership also demanded that the KPJ must raise its ideological teaching amongst members of the party after the purge. It was decided that a prominent members that were expelled from the party should get a chance to confess their mistakes in order to return into the KPJ. Soon after the purge, Gorkiƒá wrote an article called \\"On Purge of Lines of Our Party\\" (O ƒçi≈°ƒáenju redova na≈°e partije). In the article, Gorkiƒá claims that the purge had educational character. Nevertheless, the KPJ's purges under Gorkiƒá's leadership were not connected to the harsh purges conducted by Stalin. Gorkiƒá rarely stayed in Moscow. From 1932 until 1936 he stayed in Moscow only for three months. In 1935 he was a delegate on the Seventh Congress of Comintern where he was elected to the Executive Committee. During a Congress of the Comintern in the end of July 1935 held in Moscow, Gorkiƒá met with Yugoslav delegates at a session. There, he warned that Yugoslavia is a multi-national country and that since the day Yugoslavia was created, the national question was the most heated issue in the country, out of which the Croatian question is the most important. He concluded that the struggle of the oppressed people largely influenced the crisis of fascism. Nevertheless, he said that the great success of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia lies in its successful assurance of the oppressed peoples that the communists are on their side and that those people can count on the working class. After that, the Communist Party issued a directive to the Croatian communists to enter the Croatian Peasant Party, a leading Croat party in Yugoslavia at the time, and to take over leading position within it. As part of its national policy established by Gorkiƒá, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia in 1937 founded the Communist Party of Croatia and Communist Party of Slovenia. It was a tactical move of the Yugoslav Communist Party conditioned by the escalation of the inter-national relations in Yugoslavia. This was part of the reorganisation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia based on the national criterion that reflected \\"national-political character of Yugoslavia\\".  The Great Purge  The first mass arrests in the Soviet Union occurred in summer 1936, during the Great Purge. The Old bolsheviks, Grigory Zinoviev, Mikhail Tomsky, Ivan Smirnov, Alexei Rykov, Lev Kamenev, Grigori Sokolnikov and Gorkiƒá's mentor Bukharin were victims. Rykov and Bukharin were, however, trialed on the second process. During their process, the official statement of the Central Committee of the KPJ called Bukharin and Rykov \\"Trotskyst-Zinovievist fascist bandits\\" who were \\"discarded by workers' masses for their criminal fight against realisation of the ingenious Stalin's plans.\\" Both of them were executed by a firing squad. Moreover, in the official statement, two members of the KPJ, dr. Ante Ciliga and Voja Vujoviƒá, were accused for cooperation with the arrested old bolsheviks and were also proclaimed to be Benito Mussolini's spies. The KPJ under Gorkiƒá's leadership thus completely supported the Stalin's Great Purge and the official statement was, at the same time, an invitation for purges within the KPJ itself as well. In 1936 the seat of the KPJ was transferred from Vienna to Paris, so Gorkiƒá was commuting between the French capital and Moscow. At the beginning of 1937 he was in Paris and for the last time in his life, he met his wife, in Germany. During the struggle for leadership of the KPJ, Josip Broz Tito was an agent of the NKVD, the Soviet secret police. In order to replace Gorkiƒá , Tito submitted a report about Gorkiƒá to the NKVD. Gorkiƒá received an emergency call from the Comintern in Moscow to return and make a report in June 1937. He was accused of being a British spy. On 23 October he was arrested and imprisoned in Lubyanka. On 1 November Gorkiƒá was executed. After Tito took leadership over the KPJ, Gorkiƒá was posthumously expelled from the party. His wife Betti Glan, director of the Park of Culture in Moscow, was soon arrested as well; she was released in 1954 and rehabilitated in 1955 –£—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –ì–ª–∞–Ω –ë–µ—Ç—Ç–∏ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–Ω–∞. During the Great Purge, a large number of communists from Yugoslavia resided in the Soviet Union. Hundreds of them were arrested and executed without any trial under accusation that they were either spies or Trotskyists. Communists who led the KPJ before Gorkiƒá, Filip Filipoviƒá (1938), Sima Markoviƒá (1937), ƒêuka Cvijiƒá (1937), Jovan Mali≈°iƒá (1938) and Antun Mavrak (1938) were also executed during the purge. After Joseph Stalin's death, the Soviet Union rehabilitated Gorkiƒá.  Works  Gorkiƒá is author of a brochure Communists and the Croatian question (Komunisti i hrvatsko pitanje, 1934), but the content of the brochure remains unknown, even though the Communist Party of Yugoslavia ordered its printing in December 1934.

Pine Island Fort was a post of the North West Company while Manchester House was a post of the Hudson's Bay Company. Pine Island is on a south-flowing part of the North Saskatchewan River, about 50 km east of Lloydminster. It is just north of the mouth of Big Gully Creek and 18 km northeast of the town of Maidstone. The island is about 1.4 km long and 0.3 km wide. In 1786 five independent groups established themselves on the island. First was Donald McKay, an independent trader. He was followed by Peter Pangman of Gregory, McLeod and Co., Robert Longmoor representing William Tomison of the Hudson's Bay Company, William Holmes of the North West Company and an independent Frenchman named Champagne. In the next season Donald McKay joined the HBC; Gregory, McLeod joined the NWC; and Champagne left the area. This left the HBC's Manchester House at the upper end of the island and the NWC's Pine Island Fort at the lower end. Here in 1788 the HBC built the first York boat used on the Saskatchewan. David Thompson broke his leg here in 1788. In 1792 Isaac Batt, a moderately well-known trader, went south with a group of Indians to hunt on the prairie and was murdered by them. In 1793 a large group of Gros Ventres entered the NWC post pretending to trade. When it became apparent that they intended to plunder the fort, a bold clerk took arms and drove them off. (The Gros Ventres and Mandans, who were at war with the Cree and the Plains tribes, thought that the traders were selling guns to the Cree.) In the same year Manchester House was plundered, and the traders escaped with only the clothes on their backs. In 1794 Duncan McGillivray of the NWC reported the houses in ruins. The island is not easily accessible, but in 1991 a memorial stone and plaque were erected on the river bank. As of September 2014, the plaque is still in place on top of high hill overlooking Pine Island. Morton mentions an unnamed NWC post manned by Edward Umfreville directly north of Maidstone and a house belonging to Donald McKay a hundred yards away.

The killing spree began with a mass shooting that occurred at Caf√© Racer in Seattle, Washington, resulting in the deaths of four patrons. A fifth person was killed not long after. The shooter, Ian Lee Stawicki, committed suicide the same day. Shootings On May 30, 2012, just before 11:00 a.m., Stawicki walked into Caf√© Racer in the University District of Seattle, Washington. The staff there recognized him from previously being thrown out, and reminded him of that. Stawicki lingered for a bit, and then walked near the door. He pulled one of his two pistols, both .45-caliber handguns, and shot his first victim in the back of the head. The man's body blocked the door, taking away an escape route. One man threw a bar stool and used a second to separate himself from Stawicki. The distraction allowed two or three people to escape through the door the shooter had blocked. Stawicki then went near the bar and shot the others execution-style, police say. As he left, Stawicki took a hat from one of the victims. Stawicki killed a total of four patrons at the caf√© and wounded the caf√©'s chef.

Later that afternoon just before 4:00 p.m., he committed suicide on a sidewalk in West Seattle as police closed in.Seattle shootings suspect shoots himself, police say, CNN, May 30, 2012 The perpetrator previously owned six handguns (three 9mm handguns and three .45-caliber handguns), including the Para-Ordnance pistol he used in the shootings. As a result of the shootings, several schools, including Roosevelt High School and Nathan Eckstein Middle School, were put on lock-down for student safety. Perpetrator Ian Lee Stawicki (September 16, 1971 ‚Äì May 30, 2012) was the sole perpetrator of the shooting. Stawicki had prior contacts with police but a relatively short record. Police say he had charges for domestic violence interference, fourth-degree assault, malicious mischief, and a 1989 charge for unlawfully carrying a weapon. However, court records show only a 1995 case for driving with a suspended license, which resulted in an adverse finding. During the February 2008 case, police officers were called to the Magnolia home of Stawicki and his then-girlfriend to find the victim with a bloody nose and crying. She told police that he had struck her and destroyed several of her belongings, and that in recent months, he had begun breaking things and flying into rages, according to the police report. Stawicki's father, Walt Stawicki, described his son as very private person who was \\"disgruntled\\" and had been a frequent customer of the coffee shop where his rampage began.

The story is based on old Viking sagas for which to prepare Strindberg taught himself Icelandic to read the old sagas. Soon after the premier at the Royal Theater, the King of Sweden, Charles XV, summoned Strindberg to his palace to tell him how much he enjoyed it and to offer help with the young writer's tuition.Prideaux, Sue (May 15, 2012). Strindberg: A Life, Yale University Press. It was a seminal moment in Strindberg's career, allowing him to continue his studies and gaining him confidence and reputation as a writer. Plot The story is set in Iceland, inside a rough shewn log building with wooden benches along two walls, a wood throne on the third wall, two windows and a single door on the fourth wall. Gunl√∂d, the daughter of Viking leader Thorfinn, stands quietly at an open window, and gazes out over the ocean. Valgerd, her mother, speaks about their shared grief over father Thorfinn's hard and unloving manner. In addition to the family's move from Sweden to Iceland, Gunl√∂d laments at having been forced to part with her dear childhood friend, the young man Gunnar, who has gone on Crusade in the Holy Land and who she has not seen in years. Valgerd leaves the room and Gunnar unexpectedly enters, his ship having just arrived. Gunnar expresses his love and asks Gunl√∂d to return with him to Sweden. Gunl√∂d is coy but reveals that she secretly believes in the Christian god that her pagan father hates. Gunl√∂d is evidently torn between loyalty to her father, who is pagan, and her young Christian lover. Gunnar leaves the room before Valgerd returns, but says his ship will be waiting that night for her to make up her mind to go with him. The night brings a terrible storm and with it Thorfinn's ship returns home from Norway. Thorfinn enters the house and in celebration he asks his daughter to drink from a horn of Odin, a pagan act. Gunl√∂d refuses, confessing that she is a Christian and not pagan. The proud Thorfinn is mortified and angry with his disloyal daughter. Meanwhile, a messenger enters and informs Thorfinn that a local council has banished him from Iceland for past deeds of theft and murder, he must leave at once or defend himself in combat. Thorfinn fights bravely outside the home while Gunl√∂d watches from the window. He defeats his enemies, but is mortally wounded and dies while seated on his throne surrounded by wife, daughter and Gunnar. Thorfinn's last words, \\"Eternal.. Creating.. God\\", show he has accepted the Christian religion and blessed the union of Gunl√∂d and Gunnar. Themes The story is written in the style of a traditional Icelandic saga and is about the struggle between paganism and Christianity. It is about the struggle between God and man, and man and woman. pg. 1295 (under sub-section \\"Dramatic Work\\"). History The young Strindberg had written four plays by this time in his life, but none of them had met with any success. He was still in University and struggling to pay his tuition due to a dispute with his father who had cut off support. A friend, Eisen, suggested he write some plays purposefully designed for acceptance at the Royal Theater. pg. 19 For this he wrote two one-act plays, In Rome and The Outlaw. In Rome was accepted and saw eleven performances at the Dramaten, and on its strength The Outlaw was also accepted for performance. The Outlaw opened at the Royal Theatre on 16 October 1871 pg. xvii and was first published in December 1876. pg. 71 The play was little regarded by critics, but the King of Sweden, Charles XV, was so impressed with The Outlaw he summoned Strindberg to see him. Strindberg thought it was a joke, but after confirming by telegram he attended the summons. As related by biographer Warner Oland: :The kindly old King spoke of the pleasure the ancient Viking spirit of The Outlaw had given him, and said, \\"You are the son of Strindberg, the steamship agent, I believe, and so, of course, are not in need.\\" \\"Quite the reverse,\\" Strindberg replied, explaining that his father no longer gave him the meager help toward his university course which he had formerly done. \\"I'm rather short of cash myself,\\" said the King quite frankly, \\"but do you think you could manage on eight hundred riksdaler a year?\\" Strindberg was overwhelmed by such munificence, and the interview ended with his introduction to the court treasurer from whom he received his first quarter's allowance [University tuition] of two hundred crowns. Strindberg in his memoirs relates that in 1870 he wrote a five-act verse-play called Blot- Sven (Blot-Sven was a Swedish king ca. 1080), but he was unhappy with it and burned the manuscript. pg. 65 \\"From the ashes\\", he relates, arose The Outlaw, which was \\"undoubtedly influenced by Bj√∏rnson's masterly one-acter Between the Battles, which I found to be ideal as a model. For in the course of time people had grown impatient and had come to expect swift results. Thus the tempo increased\\".

It connected the Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) at Cranwell, then under construction, to the main line railway network. It opened in 1917 from Sleaford in Lincolnshire, where it joined the Great Northern Railway. RNAS Cranwell was intended for training pilots and aircrew during World War I. Control soon passed to the Royal Air Force in 1918, and the location became known as RAF Cranwell. A public passenger service was operated from the outset, and there were three stations on the branch. The passenger service was loss-making and it closed in November 1926,House of Commons Debate 23 March 1927 vol 204 cc403-404 but the goods service on the line continued until closure in 1956. A new military base The Cranwell branch lineIn the early part of World War I the British Admiralty were seeking a location for an airfield to train naval pilots. In 1915 the Aerodrome Selection Committee identified a \\"large stretch of flat country on top of the heath above Caythorpe\\". The location was near Cranwell, and was quickly selected. The Admiralty took possession of Cranwell Lodge Farm, which was the majority of the land required, on 23 November 1915. The location was to become the Royal Naval Air Service Training Establishment, Cranwell. The naval personnel were held on the books of HMS Daedalus, a hulk moored on the River Medway. Many sources assert that the RNAS was itself named HMS Daedalus.A J Ludlam, The RAF Cranwell Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1988, Construction of the accommodation for servicemen and aircraft soon started: a considerable quantity of materials needed to be brought to the location, and at the time public roads were barely adequate. The winter of 1915-1916 was hard, and transport by road to the site for construction proved very difficult. A temporary railway track was laid by the contractor; it was laid directly on the ground without any attempt at earthworks. The gradients were so severe that two locomotives were needed to pull five loaded wagons, and the line was nicknamed \\"the switchback\\".Stewart E Squires, The Lost Railways of Lincolnshire, Castlemead Publications, Ware, 1988, A proper railway It was decided to provide a proper railway on a permanent basis using the alignment adopted by the contractor but improving it for full railway usage, for both goods and passenger operation. The Admiralty wrote to the Board of Trade on 6 March 1916 stating that a passenger railway was to be provided to the new establishment, and an inspecting officer, Col Druitt, visited on 20 March 1916. Druitt advised that if passenger trains were to be run, a speed limit of 15 mph ought to be enforced. This should be reducing to mph over the underbridges, which should, he advised, be inspected every morning in case of malicious damage. Continuous brakes would be required on passenger trains. Having accepted the possibility of opening to passenger trains subject to these conditions, he appears to have had second thoughts later, and in his written report of 22 March he refused to pass the line for passenger operation. The Admiralty replied on 16 April 1916, saying that in view of the wartime emergency, it would be inappropriate to insist on peacetime safety measures. \\"Risks must be taken in wartime and work must not be held up in waiting for obligatory peacetime safeguards to be applied.\\"Letter from Admiralty to the Board of Trade, 17 April 1916, quoted in Ludlam, page 9 The Board of Trade replied that they had no jurisdiction in the matter, and the Admiralty would have full responsibility for the operation of what amounted to a military railway. Construction started, and the Great Northern Railway took responsibility for the engineering of the new line: it was to be a little over five miles in length. They employed the contractor Logan and Hemingway, who had quoted ¬£31,316 for the work. Construction started in the late summer of 1916, and was finished at the end of 1917. There were 1 in 50 gradients, rising from the Slea River crossing and both sides of the Leasingham decline.Alan Stennett, Lincolnshire Railways, Crowood Press, Marlborough, 2016, Opening The branch diverged from the existing railway network near Sleaford, and Sleaford West signalbox was extended to control the new junction. There were exchange sidings at the junction. The new arrangement was operational in March 1918 but the branch line was not completed fully until February 1919. There were various temporary branches off the main line to suit construction requirements. Gradients were mostly rising towards Cranwell, with a ruling gradient 1 in 50, but there was a fall of 1 in 60 in addition. Passenger services were run from the opening of the line.Butt (R V J Butt, The Directory of Railway Stations, Patrick Stephens Limited, 1985, ) quotes the opening as January 1917 and names the terminal station as Cranwell RAF. At January 1917 the base was still a Royal Naval Air Station, and it did not became an RAF station in January 1918. Moreover Butt quotes the closure to passengers as August 1956. That is the date of closure of the goods service; the passenger service ceased in November 1926. In early timetables there were seven passenger trains each way daily, and there was a Sunday service in addition. The Admiralty paid the Great Northern Railway ¬£500 annually for the use of Sleaford station, used by the branch passenger trains. There were three passenger stations on the branch: Slea River, not far from the junction with the GNR line, Cranwell, and East Camp.Neil Burgess, Lincolnshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing Limited, 2007 One of the passenger services from Cranwell terminated at Slea River while the engine performed goods shunting duties, and the next train to Cranwell started from that point. Closure In the 1920s competition from bus services locally hit the branch usage hard, and from November 1926 the passenger service on the branch was closed. From that time the branch goods trains did not run beyond the exchange sidings at Sleaford West Junction. After World War II the requirement for the branch declined further and it was closed in August 1956. The track was removed in October 1957. Profitability In regards to finance, the line never broke even: in response to a Parliamentary Question, it was revealed that, even allowing for a credit in respect of the c.15,000 tons of Government stores that were transported along it during 1924, the line still made a loss of ¬£3,570. After coming under repeated pressure to reduce the deficit, the line ceased to carry regular passenger traffic in November 1926, with a consequent reduction in running costs. Its original use, for the conveyance of materials and provisions to the training establishment at Cranwell continued, however, together with the occasional passenger train (such as the special trains bringing public schoolboys to visit the college in the 1930s, the first Canadian contingent to arrive in the Second World War and the 1953 Flying Training Command Coronation contingent, which was pulled by a British Railways J6 class 0-6-0 tender engine with another of the Class on the rear). Rolling Stock Locomotive \\"Sir Berkeley\\", which was very similar to the locomotives used on the Cranwell Branch, in steam at Ingrow West on the Keighley & Worth Valley Railway. Five locomotives owned by the contractors Logan and Hemingway are known to have worked at Cranwell; these were all Manning Wardle 0-6-0 Saddle Tanks, with numbers: 3, 4 Epworth, 5, 7 Bletcher and 8.Ludlam, page 51 A surviving Logan and Hemingway locomotive of the type used on the RAF Cranwell Railway (a 0-6-0 Manning Wardle saddle tank originally known as Number 10, but which now goes by the name of Sir Berkeley) is owned by the Vintage Carriages Trust.Ludlam, page 5 Two diesel locomotives were tried out on the line after World War II but they were unsuccessful in view of the difficult gradients on the line. Thirteen four-wheeled and six-wheeled passenger coaches were acquired for the passenger service. They were bought second-hand from the GNR before 1919, having been in use on the GNR Metropolitan Service between New Barnet and Moorgate. Eight coaches were usually sufficient on any train except on Saturdays when all thirteen were often used. Station building The former Cranwell station building also remained in use, as a guardhouse.

Five children died at the scene, while the oldest later died in hospital. The parents of the children, Mairead and Mick Philpott, along with their friend Paul Mosley, were later arrested and charged with murder. In December 2012 their charges were downgraded to manslaughter. On 2 April 2013, Mick Philpott and Paul Mosley were found guilty by unanimous verdicts, while Mairead Philpott was found guilty by majority verdict. Fire The children were asleep upstairs in the house when the fire began, with their parents downstairs. Their father, Mick Philpott, was reported to have made \\"valiant\\" attempts to save them. Jade Philpott (10), John Philpott (9), Jack Philpott (7), Jesse Philpott (6) and Jayden Philpott (5) were all killed in the fire; post-mortem tests revealed the children died of smoke inhalation. Their brother, Duwayne Philpott (13) died in hospital two days later. Two adults suffered minor injuries in the fire, but have not been formally identified. Police confirmed that the fire was started deliberately, with petrol underneath the letterbox, in an act of arson, stating that \\"Initial indications are that it was deliberately set and as a result six children have been unlawfully killed.\\" A church service was held in memory of the children at the Catholic church of St George's in Littleover. A charity, Catch Me When I Fall, was set up by local residents to help the family of the children. A book of condolence at Derby Cathedral was later signed by hundreds of people. Prior to their deaths Jade, John, Jack, and Jesse attended St George's Catholic Primary School, and Duwayne was a student at Saint Benedict Catholic School. Arrests A 38-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman were arrested on suspicion of murder, but were later released without charge following questioning. Following the release of the pair Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill said that \\"While I thank those members of the community who have come forward with information I am surprised by how few people have contacted us. Normally in cases of this scale more information is passed to the police...I strongly suspect that there is someone out there in the community who knows more than we are being told.\\" The parents of the children, Mick and Mairead Philpott, were arrested on suspicion of murder on 29 May and charged with their murders the following day. On 5 November 2012, a 49-year-old man and a 45-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder. Later that day, the 45-year-old man, Paul Mosley, was charged with murder. The other man was released without charge. Mosley appeared in court the following day. In December 2012 his charge was downgraded to manslaughter. Paul Mosley had previously been arrested in the enquiry and was released on bail in June 2012. He was re-arrested and charged when petrol was found on his clothing following further forensic examination. Trial The criminal trial began on 12 February 2013 at Nottingham Crown Court before judge Mrs Justice Thirlwall. Richard Latham QC led the prosecution on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service. Anthony Orchard QC led the defence for Mick Philpott, Sean Smith QC led the defence for Mairead Philpott, and Benjamin Nolan QC led the defence for Mosley. On 2 April, Mick and Mairead Philpott, along with Paul Mosley, were each found guilty of the manslaughter of the six children. On 4 April, Philpott received a sentence of life imprisonment, and will serve a minimum of 15 years, while his wife and Mosley received 17 years imprisonment for their part.

Ellis is best known for his African-American themed art and styles which blend elements of folk art, naturalism and impressionism. His personal rendition of Barack Obama in acrylic, Obama, the 44th President, was presented in honor of the 2009 Presidential Inauguration. Ellis' art business has sold over 1.75 million fine art products, and he works with a number of prominent corporations. He is also known for his community work, especially advancing arts in children's education. Personal life and early career Ted Ellis creating art. Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, to a professional musician-father and a housewife-mother, Ted Ellis' earliest hints of artistic talent began to show at five-years-old. Ellis' first attempt at art was a third-grade freehand sketch of a dog from Archie Comics, which he drew so accurately that friends and family believed it had been traced. Growing up, one of his favorite characters to draw was Wile E. Coyote, and as an adult he continues to enjoy comic books as \\"refreshing\\". When he was old enough, Ted would ride the bus alone to downtown New Orleans so as to be exposed to and spend time with the area artists. He and his friends would in their spare time compete with one another to see who could draw the best designs, and Ted continued developing his art skills throughout primary school despite only receiving \\"satisfactory\\" marks in art class. In elementary school he attended a summer program at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts, and later attended an after-school program at Lawless High School. Ellis says that he knew he wanted to be an artist in the seventh grade, and credits his teacher in that class for keeping him focused. Ted worked for a time with charcoal and pastel before settling on oil and acrylic. He took art classes during high school and enrolled in four months of private art lessons, but is otherwise self-taught. Ellis followed advice from Anna Torregano, his mentor, friend and high school art teacher, and his parents, all of whom advised him to pursue an academic career so as not to become a \\"starving artist\\". His mother especially stressed university and earning a professional degree. Ted Ellis earned a B.Sc. in Chemistry at Dillard University on a United States Army ROTC scholarship as well as academic scholarship, and went on to be commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army's Field Artillery Branch. Ellis spent the next ten years working in the field of chemistry, eight years of which were as an environmental chemist at Rollins Engineering Services. Ellis has lived in Louisiana and California, and currently resides in Friendswood, Texas with his wife, Erania. They have a daughter, Chaney, and a son, Tanner. Chaney is an aspiring rap artist and has produced a positive, parent-friendly CD about school and drugs titled Off the Chain. Art career Thee Baptism, Ted Ellis' first widely sold art. Ted Ellis maintained a passion for art that preceded his professional art career; he painted throughout his time in the Army and as an environmental chemist, generally working out of a studio in his garage. His first commissions were produced for two co-workers at Rollins. They had wanted to purchase the piece that he was then working on, but he refused and instead offered to paint them two similar pieces, which they purchased for $40. When he first got started, Ellis passed on an opportunity to do work for the J. C. Penney catalog because he was too busy, but ultimately found success in a similar publication. Ellis published his first prints through Market Arts' Dan Rose in Houston, but his art career took off when he noticed that his wife's Avon boutique magazine, targeted at African- Americans, lacked any art. He sent Avon a proposal which they accepted, and through the magazine he sold 42,610 signed prints of Thee Baptism. Since he was still working as an engineer at the time, he autographed the tens-of- thousands of prints during his lunch-break. After quitting his job as an engineer in 1996, Ellis competed against 500 others for, and won, a 1998 Walt Disney Studios commission for art in honor of Black History Month. The piece was used in the 1999 celebration at Epcot Center and appeared on T-shirts, souvenir-mugs, and posters. Art Business Prayers Heal depicts a surgeon who later bought it. An entrepreneurial-minded Ted Ellis has marketed and sold his art throughout his career. He was already monetizing his creative talents in high school when his classmates and he sold their custom designed T-shirts, first to their school's juniors and seniors, and then throughout the school district. In building his art business over two decades, Ellis engaged in fact-finding missions in search of financial patrons and customers at art festivals, conventions, reunions and libraries, as well as local businesses. Ellis incorporated his business in 1991. He credits his time at Rollins for teaching him that \\"if you have a quality product and a good form of distribution, you'll succeed\\". When he first got started, Ellis quickly realized that talent was not alone enough after he had to approach 30‚Äì40 galleries until he was picked up by two, one of which closed down. He says that \\"it's a lot of marketing, planning, exhibiting and a lot of rejection\\". Ted's wife Erenia, a loan officer, manages his business, \\"T. Ellis Art, Incorporated\\", out of a League City, Texas studio. Ellis has sold more than 1.75 million fine art products across the country through direct sales, art galleries, catalog outlets, fine art dealers, and licensing, and has marketed community partnership opportunities meant to educate and empower communities by offering maximum returns on minimal investments. In 2005 he signed for representation with art licensing agency \\"Alaska Momma\\" with the intent of opening new merchandising avenues in home d√©cor, furnishings, calendars, apparel and stationery. Ellis has affiliated with and had art commissioned by corporations like Walt Disney Studios, Minute Maid, Coca-Cola, Marathon Oil, ExxonMobil, State Farm Insurance, Merck Pharmaceutical, J. C. Penney, Southland Corporation, and Avon Products, Philip Morris USA and Integrity Music. Ellis' works have been sold through Army and Air Force Exchange Service catalogs and were available exclusively both through Avon's African American Boutique as well as their core brochures. One of his first major sales was of an original depicting a God-like surgeon in an operating-room, sold to the surgeon. Ellis' art has sold for prices ranging from $750 to $30,000. Despite his success, while Ellis initially had hoped to build his business up to Fortune 500 stature, he now finds satisfaction in \\"helping others through art\\". Hurricane Katrina Surviving Katrina, inspired by the hope he saw in a lone man rebuilding in New Orleans in the days after Hurricane Katrina/whose flag represents the need for the nation to unite behind those rebuilding. Ted Ellis and his wife are both natives of New Orleans, and much of his art along with his passion for art are inspired by the vibrant city. As a young man, he would search the colorful French Quarter for subjects to paint. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the devastation of parts of the city, the city's role in his art drastically changed so as to reflect the story of hope and rebirth that he saw in the disaster. On the night before the storm hit Louisiana, the Ellis home in Texas was a refuge for 10 New Orleans families, 50 people in all. After the storm, Ellis helped fly home friends stranded outside New Orleans, and he organized colleagues in the art community behind the relief effort. Ellis was allowed to enter the city two weeks after the flood waters subsided in order to survey the damage to his mother's home in the Lower Ninth Ward and salvage her possessions. While travelling among the destroyed houses and deserted city, Ellis witnessed a lone man repairing his home's roof. The contrast resonated with Ellis, and he memorialized the hope he saw in the man's actions through his piece Surviving Katrina. The scene is of rising floodwater that traps a family on their house's roof while the father holds up the Flag of the United States, a flag that to Ellis symbolizes the need for the nation to come together to aid those affected by the storm. In Life Begins Anew, a father holds a baby above floodwaters while another man reaches out to take the child. Ellis describes the scene as symbolizing the promise of a new beginning for those who survived Katrina and its aftermath. As its title indicates, the Katrina: The Hope, Healing and Rebirth of New Orleans collection was for Ellis about showing the power of art to assist the healing process: \\"The largest piece I did is about how life begins anew and how a person can find hope even after such devastation. I want this work to be uplifting, to be a fresh breath of life for the community.\\" Obama Portrait The many colors represent the unity that Ellis saw in the inauguration of Obama, the 44th President. One of Ted Ellis' more famous works is an abstract depiction of Barack Obama's signature 'hope' pose. Ellis painted the portrait in honor of Obama's 2008 Presidential inauguration. In Obama, the 44th President, Ellis uses red, blue, yellow, and green acrylic paint to portray Obama as someone who unites people across lines of color, ethnicity, and religion. The piece was presented at a January 19, 2009 gala held by the National Black Chamber of Commerce and the National Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation at the Embassy of France in Washington, D.C. The proceeds from the autographed prints sold at the event supported NNPA Foundation and the Howard University School of Communications Building Fund (NNPA Media Wing). African-American history Free At Last depicts several themes from African-American history. In 2009, Ted Ellis produced an exhibit focusing on the theme of African-American history in light of slavery and emancipation. The exhibit, American Slavery: The Reason Why We're Here, tied into the Juneteenth commemoration of slavery's abolition in the State of Texas. It was located at and included tours of the historic residence of horticulturist Henry Stringfellow, an innovator in organic gardening who was enlightened in how he employed of freedmen. Ellis began the series of works at a 2006 exhibition at the same house. The exhibit's more than 20 paintings were painted with brush and fingers, and Ellis sometimes added a collage of documents. The exhibit included images of the transportation of slaves, the industry of slavery in crop production, and the abolition of slavery. The painting Free At Last includes depictions of Buffalo soldiers, Harriet Tubman, the year \\"1865\\", a mighty oak, and in the background, their heads bowed in prayer, the figures of the current owner and restorer of the house, Sam Collins III, and his wife and children. The exhibit also displayed Ellis' famous depiction of Barack Obama, Obama, the 44th President. Ellis' art was featured at a 2011 exhibition at the Rosa Parks Library and Museum. The Museum, at Troy University in Montgomery, Alabama, hosted the exhibit, called Our History, Heritage, and Culture: An American Story, the Art of Ted Ellis, as part of its celebration of Black History Month.Artist Ted Ellis Partners with the Rosa Parks Museum at Troy University to Celebrate Black History Houston, TX (PRWEB) January 14, 2011 T.

Educational work Ted Ellis views education as one of his primary missions, and he is involved with several educational initiatives. He has a run a number of art workshops with children, including drawing and touching up the school mural which local sixth-graders paint every year, and joining with his wife Erania to illustrate while she reads aloud to children from books about topics like the Buffalo Soldiers. When working with children with autism, he employs a strategy of engaging the children's creativity in a non-judgemental setting where there is no wrong way for them to express themselves; he hopes to put their art on display at the Houston Children's Museum. He has partnered with the Tom Joyner Foundation to fund-raise for students, while \\"Art with a Purpose\\", his own nonprofit program, was awarded a federal grant to help disadvantaged students. Ellis serves together with Gregory Michael Carter as an artist-in-residence for an arts enrichment program at a Galveston, Texas charter school, \\"Ambassadors Preparatory Academy\\". The program, called \\"Ambassadors for Art\\", is led by school administrators and members of the community through the Gulf Coast Apollo Chapter of nonprofit volunteer service organization The Links, Incorporated. Ambassadors for Art also took part in painting a bust of US President Barack Obama. The bust was one of 45 painted by artists nationwide which were displayed in Detroit's Museum of African American History, part of a project supported by the Smithsonian Institution. He has also worked with other arts education programs like the Peoria Public Schools' \\"Artreach\\", in the framework of which he donated five original pieces to the schools and District 150 Foundation.Art Donation Inspires Students to Aspire Vol XXXVI No. 7 Oct. 11 2002 Style Sunday Worship is Ellis' most popular work and personal favorite. Ted Ellis has over his career created art in a number of styles and has incorporated several primary influences. African American history and African American culture play central roles in Ellis' art, which regularly feature themes like Buffalo Soldiers, cotton fields, and Jazz music; his Jazz works especially lean towards the impressionistic. Other common themes range from fisherman to religious scenes as in Thee Baptism, My Father's Baptism, and Deacon's Door, to African ethnic scenes like Afrimage and Ashanti. The Church-related themes in his art he attributes to formative experiences with his mother at their local house of worship, \\"Beulah Land Church\\". While he is best known for his ethnic art, many of Ellis' pieces are landscapes, seascapes, and portraits. Ted Ellis is a self-taught artist. He has describes his style at times as \\"conventional realism\\", as a bold blend of realism and impressionism, and as impressionist and naturalist, an old masters' style that is sometimes figurative and sometimes folk art. \\"I try to capture the essence in one stroke\\" he said. Ellis has also coined the term \\"Tedism\\" to describe his style. \\"Tedism\\" blends impressionism, soul, and folk stories to create representational pieces. Ted Ellis considers himself to be a social, political and spiritual artist as well as educator and \\"creative historian\\". \\"I paint subjects that are representative of the many facets of American life as I know it\\" says Ellis. \\"I like to think of myself as a creative historian. I was put here to record history...all aspects of American culture and heritage. My sole purpose has always been to educate through my art\\". He draws inspiration from people's memories of family or from history, and says that he's \\"a history buff at heart. I read a lot, and I have more books than paint.\\" As an artist who focuses on African American history, Ellis intentionally does not approach its difficult chapters from a position of pain: \\"I have to be careful what I do [...] there's a power to art. I don't want to be from an angry position. That's out there, and maybe they do that to shake you up and make you think. I want to be one step ahead. When you're talking about healing, you're in the right zone.\\" As such, his images of slavery and historical Southern life focus on positive values such as family, character, and church. Ellis attributes a love for and influence in his art to New Orleans and its rich culture of creativity. He compared the city to an incubator for young talent. The city offered Ted art clubs and opportunities to design murals for school and create signs for special events. New Orleans gave him access to art classes, summer art programs, and the vibrant Jackson Square, somewhere he could talk with and get to know many artists. Ellis' favorite artists include Henry Ossawa Tanner, Edward Bannister, Jacob Lawrence, Samella Lewis, and John T. Scott, while among his work the favorite painting is Sunday Worship. Achievements Ellis' work has been exhibited at and is on permanent display at several museums. Ted Ellis and his artwork have been widely recognized and honored in many venues.

Views on African American art In a column published in Images Magazine, Ted Ellis calls on the younger generations of black artists to recognize the hardship faced by and the effort put in by the previous generation of black artists in order to pave the way for the newer generation to be able to succeed, and to do so with far less difficulty.Images Magazine Volume II Number 4. Perspectives. Ted Ellis. 1993 He says African-American are still not within the mainstream, and despite being the most financially minded black artists yet, that the current generation still earns less than it should. Ellis further assigns partial responsibility on an academic world that he sees as not paying sufficient attention to the genre. He believes strongly that African-Americans should value their art on their terms, looking past aesthetics, and that only thus will the genre grow and be better appreciated.

Selective hearing is characterized as the action in which people focus their attention intentionally on a specific source of a sound or spoken words. When people use selective hearing, noise from the surrounding environment is heard by the auditory system but only certain parts of the auditory information are chosen to be processed by the brain. Most often, auditory attention is directed at things people are most interested in hearing. In an article by Krans, Isbell, Giuliano, and Neville (2013), selective auditory attention is defined as the ability to acknowledge some stimuli while ignoring other stimuli that is occurring at the same time. An example of this is a student focusing on a teacher giving a lesson and ignoring the sounds of classmates in a rowdy classroom (p. 53). This is an example of bottlenecking which means that information cannot be processed simultaneously so only some sensory information gets through the \\"bottleneck\\" and is processed. A brain simply cannot process all sensory information that is occurring in an environment so only the most relevant and important information is thoroughly processed by the brain. There have been some models that theorize the pathway of selective auditory attention, notably the early selection model, late selection model, and attenuation model. Selective hearing is not a physiological disorder but rather it is the capability of humans to block out sounds and noise. It is the notion of ignoring certain things in the surrounding environment.  History  Early researches on selective auditory attention can be traced back to 1953, when Colin Cherry introduced the \\"cocktail party problem\\". At the time, air traffic controllers at the control tower received messages from pilots through loudspeakers. Hearing mixed voices through a single loudspeaker made the task very difficult. In Cherry's experiment, mimicking the problem faced by air traffic controllers, participants had to listen to two messages played simultaneously from one loudspeaker and repeat what they heard. This was later termed the dichotic listening task. Though introduced by Colin Cherry, Donald Broadbent is often regarded as the first to systematically apply dichotic listening tests in his research. Broadbent used the method of dichotic listening to test how participants selectively attend to stimuli when overloaded with auditory stimuli; Broadbent used his findings to develop the filter model of attention in 1958. Broadbent theorized that the human information processing system has a \\"bottleneck\\" due to limited capacity and that the brain performs an \\"early selection\\" before processing auditory information. Broadbent proposed that auditory information enters an unlimited sensory buffer and that one stream of information is filtered out and passes through the bottleneck to be cohesive, while all others that are not selected quickly decay in salience and are not processed. Broadbent's model contradicts with the cocktail party phenomenon because Broadbent's model predicts that people would never respond to their names from unattended sources since unattended information is discarded before being processed. Deutsch & Deutsch's late selection model that was proposed in 1963 is a competing model to Broadbent's early selection model. Deutsch & Deutsch's model theorizes that all information and sensory input are attended to and processed for meaning. Later in the processing routine, just before information enters the short-term memory, a filter analyzes the semantic characteristics of the information and lets stimuli containing relevant information pass through to short-term memory and removes irrelevant information. Deutsch & Deutsch's model for selective auditory attention suggests that weak response to unattended stimuli comes from an internal decision on informational relevance, where more important stimuli are prioritized to enter the working memory first. In 1964, Anne Treisman, a graduate student of Broadbent, improved Broadent's theory and proposed her own attenuation model. In Treisman's model, unattended information is attenuated, tuned down compared to attended information, but still processed. For example, imagine that you are exposed to three extraneous sources of sound in a coffee shop while ordering a drink (chatter, coffee brewer, music), Treisman's model indicates that you would still pick up on the latter three sounds while attending to the cashier, just that these extraneous sources of noise would be muffled as if their \\"volumes\\" were turned down. Treisman also suggests that a threshold mechanism exists in selective auditory attention in which words from the unattended stream of information can grab one's attention. Words of low threshold, higher level of meaning and importance, such as one's name and \\"watch out\\", redirects one's attention to where it is urgently required.  Recent research  Recently, researchers have attempted to explain mechanisms implicated in selective auditory attention. In 2012, an assistant professor in residence of the Neurological Surgery and Physiology in the University of California San Francisco examined the selective cortical representation of attended speaker in multiple-talker speech perception. Edward Chang and his colleague, Nima Mesgarani undertook a study that recruited three patients affected by severe epilepsy, who were undergoing treatment surgery. All patients were recorded to have normal hearing. The procedure of this study required the surgeons to place a thin sheet of electrodes under the skull on the outer surface of the cortex. The activity of electrodes was recorded in the auditory cortex. The patients were given two speech samples to listen to and they were told to distinguish the words spoken by the speakers. The speech samples were simultaneously played and different speech phrases were spoken by different speakers. Chang and Mesgarani found an increase in neural responses in the auditory cortex when the patients heard words from the target speaker. Chang went on to explain that the method of this experiment was well-conducted as it was able to observe the neural patterns that tells when the patient's auditory attention shifted to the other speaker. This clearly shows the selectivity of auditory attention in humans. The development of selective attention has also been examined. Jones and Moore for instance, studied how well children across various age groups could hear and respond to a target sound when it was masked by other auditory stimuli. They discovered that 9‚Äì to 11-year-old children became as adept as adults at paying attention only to the target sound and filtering out the masking sound (2015, p. 366). This shows that research on selective auditory information is important to continue as it allows us to better understand our world.  Prevalence  The prevalence of selective hearing has not been clearly researched yet. However, there are some that have argued that the proportion of selective hearing is particularly higher in males than females. Ida Z√ºndorf, Hans-Otto Karnath and J√∂rg Lewald carried out a study in 2010 which investigated the advantages and abilities males have in the localization of auditory information. A sound localization task centered on the cocktail party effect was utilized in their study. The male and female participants had to try to pick out sounds from a specific source, on top of other competing sounds from other sources. The results showed that the males had a better performance overall. Female participants found it more difficult to locate target sounds in a multiple-source environment. Z√ºndorf et al. suggested that there may be sex differences in the attention processes that helped locate the target sound from a multiple-source auditory field. While men and women do have some differences when it comes to selective auditory hearing, they both struggle when presented with the challenge of multitasking, especially when tasks that are to be attempted concurrently are very similar in nature (Dittrich, and Stahl, 2012, p. 626).  Disorder status  Selective hearing is not known to be a disorder of the physiological or psychological aspect. Under the World Health Organization (WHO), a hearing disorder happens when there is a complete loss of hearing in the ears. It means the loss of the ability to hear. Technically speaking, selective hearing is not \\"deafness\\" to a certain sound message. Rather, it is the selectivity of an individual to attend audibly to a sound message. The whole sound message is physically heard by the ear but the brain systematically filters out unwanted information to focus on relevant important portions of the message. Therefore, selective hearing should not be confused as a physiological hearing disorder. Selective auditory attention is a normal sensory process of the brain, and there can be abnormalities related to this process in people with sensory processing disorders such as attention deficit hyperactive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, selective mutism, and in stand-alone auditory processing disorders.

The Nationalisation process in Pakistan (or historically simply regarded as the \\"Nationalisation in Pakistan\\") was a policy measure programme in the economic history of Pakistan, first introduced, promulgated and implemented by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party to lay the foundation of socialist economics reforms to improve the growth of national economy of Pakistan. Since the 1950s, the country had undergone a speedy industrialisation and became an industrial paradise in Asia. But, as time progressed, the labour trade unions and labour-working class had increasingly strained relations with the industrial business oligarch class, having neglected to improve working conditions and failing to provide a healthy and safe environment for the workers in these industrial industries. The nationalisation programme began on 2 January 1972, with a vision to promote economic democracy, liberalisation, and an initial mainstream goal to put Pakistan in line with state progressivism. Ended effectively in 1977, the nationalisation programme was again put forward by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1996, and most recently by then-current Prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani in 2012 who activated the programme to bring three major megacorporations (Steel Mills, Railways and International Airlines) under government ownership in an attempt to improve its structure and to alleviate its profitable process. Despite its success in its formative years, such policy measure programmes met with an extreme level of spontaneous demonstration and international and national opposition that left disastrous effects on Pakistan's national economy until it was replaced with the privatisation programme set forward by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1990 until the programme's final execution in 2008 by Shaukat Aziz. Nationalization phase (1971‚Äì1977) Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1928‚Äì1979) became President of Pakistan (1971‚Äì74) on 21 December 1971 after a disastrous end of 1971 war with India. The nationalisation programme was implemented for the first time in the history of Pakistan and it was promulgated through three different stages. On 1 January 1972, on a televised speech to the nation, Bhutto and the peoples party's government promulgated the three-staged programme, under \\"Nationalization and Economic Reforms Order (NERO)\\", which nationalised all major metal industries, including iron and steel, heavy engineering, heavy electricals, petrochemicals, cement and public utilities except textiles industry and lands. The first stage of the nationalisation programme integrated approximately 31 major industrial megacorporations, industrial units and enterprises, under direct management control of the government under 10 different categories of basic industries. The programme intended to assert public ownership over the industrial megacorporations, and to satisfied the labour unions to keep the industrialisation peace in the country. Namely, the first stage of the nationalisation programme integrated the selective industries approved by the peoples party's government and the nationalisation programme provided the iron and steel, basic metal industries, heavy engineering industries, heavy electrical industries, assembly and manufacture of motor vehicles, tractor public utilities, including the electricity generation, transmission and distribution, gas and oil refineries, under the management of public sector. A large number of Christian educational facilities were also nationalized in 1972. One example is Gordon College in Rawalpindi. In Peshawar nationalization of Christian schools happened under a later government. The provincial governor refused to implement Bhutto's policy. He did not want to disadvantage minorities in his province. After the success of the first stage, the nationalisation programme stepped into the second stage when it was launched on 1 January 1974, intending to nationalised the banking and financial industry and sector in Pakistan. Passed by the parliament, over 13 major banks, over a dozen insurance companies, two petroleum companies and 10 shipping companies were forcefully nationalised. The second programme was presided by Finance Minister Mubashir Hassan who strongly maintained that: \\"wealth of the nation must be used for the benefit of the nation and can not be allowed to be concentrated in the banks of a few individuals.\\" On 1 April 1973, Bhutto held a meeting with members of Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry and maintained: The third programme soon launched in 1 July 1976, when approximately 2,000 cotton, ginning and rice husking units came under the nationalisation programme. This programme met with administrative nightmare and widespread public resentment. The third programme eliminated the role of middle men, and it was rumoured that the producer as well as consumers of cotton, rice and wheat had been at the mercy of middle men trading in the milling of these commodities, with the result that producers were deprived of due share and consumer got poor quality and adulterated commodities at much higher prices. By 1977, the peoples party's government had built a strong and sizeable public sector with priority on cement, steel and fertilizers. Nationalization phase (1988‚Äìpresent) Yousaf Raza Gillani In November 1988, Benazir Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party came to power for a second time. During the election campaign in 1988, Benazir Bhutto promised to the industrial sector to end nationalisation programme and to carry out the industrialisation by means other than state intervention. But controversially, Benazir Bhutto did not authorise the directives to carry out the denationalisation programme or liberalisation of the national economy. No nationalised units were privatised, only few economic regulations were reviewed. Although limited-scale privatisation continued under Benazir Bhutto's second government, the UBL Pakistan and railway consortium was completely nationalised by Benazir Bhutto before being dismissed in 1996. During the second government, the Peoples Party intensified the government control on Pakistan Railways and Pakistan Steel Mills; all shares were kept under government management ownership. In 1998, Prime minister Nawaz Sharif ) imposed economic emergency after performing nuclear deterrence in a direct response to India. All state-owned corporations and private sector industries' assets were frozen by Nawaz Sharif after ordering to freeze the private assets under government control to prevent the financial collapse. The foundation of nuclear program was laid by [(Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto)] in Pakistan From 1999 to 2010, the nationalisation programme was swiftly ended and effectively came to its end until 2011. The nationalisation programme was again promulgated by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani on 15 December 2011, in order secure and rescue the former state-owned enterprises. The nationalisation programme was put forward to enhance the government ownership of Pakistan Steel Mills, Pakistan Railways as well as Pakistan International Airlines. The current nationalisation programme remains intact to restructured and made profitable while remaining within government ownership. Opposition and adversaries  The GDP growth rate stood between 3.88% until being dropped to 2.84% after the completion of nationalisation programme. The nationalisation policies had disastrous effects on the economy and had damaged the confidence of investors in the country. The nationalisation programme financially devastated 22 oligarch families, while one investor quoting: \\"industrialists not just lost industrial units to Bhutto's nationalization policy, they lost the urge to invest in Pakistan.\\". Major affectee included Nawaz Sharif who lost the major steel mill, the Ittefaq Group of Industries, and Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain's Gujrat Enterprises. All 25 shipping companies were merged with Pakistan National Shipping Corporation by Bhutto's nationalisation programme; those who protested were imprisoned by the government. At an international level, the United States fully opposed the nationalisation programme and marked it as \\"ill-considered\\" decision of the government. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, an affectee of nationalisation process, gave vehement criticism and cited nationalisation programme as \\"lamentable state of Pakistan\\". While on the other hand, the unnamed and anonymous United States embassy officer later further noted that: Responsive reasoning The Pakistan Peoples Party's intellectuals on the other hand, vigorously defended the nationalisation programme. The Peoples Party maintained that the \\"nationalization\\" programme was indeed a \\"success\\" but the way it was implemented led to its failure. The Peoples' Party's members and cabinet officers, such as Dr. Mubashir Hassan, maintained that the Nationalization programme was party policy and the founding programme of the PPP in 1967, under \\"socialism is our economy\\" clause. Others supporting the arguments that the program was mandated by the people of Pakistan when they voted for PPP in 1970 general elections, and peoples party is proud of the successful implementation of the nationalisation policy, and the fact that nationalisation measures were protected for 10 years by the 1973 Constitution. Started in 1970, the nationalisation programmes were precise articulation of that \\"self-consciousness\\" and \\"self-recognition\\" expression. The nationalisation programme completely abolished the monopoly and politicisation of economy under few hands that was kept in close drawing- room politics. The nationalisation program gave a though of \\"self-awarenes\\" to labours, traders, and workers unions and to be more aware about the worker's rights and work healthy safe environment, as Suleman Akhtar maintained.

Born in Schwarzach/Pongau in Salzburg, Stefan Obermaier lives and works in Vienna since 2001. He produces different house music styles, downtempo and electronica.  Life and music  His parents gave Stefan Obermaier his first electronic keyboard when he was just five years old. In the early 1990s, already he played in various funk and jazz projects. 1997 and 1998, he won the Austrian Band Contest with his school band for his original compositions. Simultaneously, inspired by the \\"Vienna Sound\\" mid of the 1990s, Stefan made it at the age of 17 to the forefront of performing electronic musicians in the Salzburg area. At that time, where there were no music functional laptops on the market, he was one of the very few moving around with big computers and installing them in the venues for their gigs. After finishing school, Obermaier moved 2001 to Vienna to study music science, but left the University after four semester upon signing his first record contract with Universal Music in order to focus on his musical output. The first original recordings under his own name got released through the Viennese music label \\"Vienna Scientists\\". He worked further on remixes for a.o.M, Mark Murphy and Supermax. At the same time, Obermaier started a series of reinterpretations from classical music repertoire, going gold in Austria right with the initial album release (\\"iMozart\\" 2005). In 2008 Stefan Obermaier revealed his \\"Classic Reloaded\\" project, in which he developed the fusion of his own electronica with the prestigious works of great classical composers.

The first land acquisition for the WMA occurred in 1970 from M.S. Bastian, a local farmer and rancher. Three additional parcels were acquired in 1974. Background  The western slopes of the Portneuf Mountain Range have long provided winter habitat for mule deer. In 1970, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game used Pittman- Robertson funds to purchase over 2,800 acres of this winter range, creating Portneuf Wildlife Management Area (WMA). Later land acquisitions enlarged the WMA to over 3,100 acres. The maintenance and improvement of big game habitat is the primary objective at Portneuf WMA; upland game bird habitat enhancement is also a priority. Management activities conducted on Portneuf WMA benefit a variety of wildlife species found in the area. Management practices  Portneuf WMA is managed primarily as big game winter range. While only 75 mule deer inhabit the WMA throughout the year, that number swells to 500 during the winter months. A few moose and a small herd of elk also winter on the WMA. Shrub seedlings, such as bitterbrush and Hobble Creek sagebrush are planted on the WMA for big game forage. Managers maintain the grassland ranges for big game and upland game birds through weed control and periodically burning selected areas. Beaver were released in the area years ago and now inhabit some of the drainages on WMA lands. Their dam building activities expand riparian areas, benefitting a host of other wildlife. The ponds created by beaver dams hold water in the area longer and greatly improve habitat for native cutthroat trout populations. Wildlife  While mule deer, elk and moose are the only large mammals inhabiting Portneuf WMA, a number of small mammals also call the area home. Beaver reside in some creek drainages, along with porcupine and mink. Coyotes, raccoons, yellow-bellied marmots, cottontail rabbits and the occasional bobcat and mountain lion also roam WMA lands. Golden eagles, Northern harriers, red-tailed hawks and great horned owls are commonly seen on Portneuf WMA. Swainson‚Äôs and rough-legged hawks are early spring visitors, passing through on their migration flights north. Blue, ruffed and Columbia sharptailed grouse are commonly found on the WMA. Turkey, gray partridge and ring-necked pheasants are less common resident upland bird species. Yellow warbler, yellow-rumped warbler, MacGillivray‚Äôs warbler, vesper sparrow, song sparrow, savannah sparrow, American goldfinch, lazuli bunting, western kingbird, western wood pewee,, black-capped chickadee, sage thrasher, rufous-sided towhee, green-tailed towhee, American robin, ruby-crowned kinglet, western meadowlark, and pine siskin are some of the birds that inhabit Portneuf WMA‚Äôs riparian and upland habitat. Location and directions Portneuf WMA is located 16 miles southeast of Pocatello in eastern Idaho‚Äôs Bannock County. To reach Portneuf WMA, take Interstate 15 to exit 57 (Inkom). Turn south on U.S. Highway 91. Three secondary roads lead the visitor to the WMA from the highway. To access the northern portion of the WMA, remain on U.S. Highway 91 for 4 1/2 miles. Turn east on Lower Rock Creek Road and travel 2 miles. Turn south on Bonneville Road and travel 1 1/2 miles to the parking area at the WMAs north boundary. To access the central portion of the WMA, remain on U.S. Highway 91 for an additional 2 1/4 miles to the Crane Creek parking area located on the east side of the highway. Robber‚Äôs Roost Creek Road and parking area is one mile further south on the east side of U.S. Highway 91. The southern portion of the WMA is accessible from a road 3/4 mile south of Robber‚Äôs Roost Creek that turns east from U.S. Highway 91 along the WMAs south boundary. Setting Portneuf WMA lies west of Haystack Mountain on the western slope of the Portneuf Mountain Range. Despite its relatively small size, the WMA encompasses a number of different habitats. Riparian habitat along the Portneuf River and the WMA drainages is defined by willow, red osier dogwood, birch and cottonwood. Upland areas contain a mixture of shrubs and grasses including sagebrush, bitterbrush, serviceberry, elderberry, mountain mahogany, chokecherry, juniper, bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue and bottle-brush squirreltail. On the timbered slopes adjoining the Caribou-Targhee National Forest, Douglas fir, juniper and aspen stands dominate. Elevations range from 4,700 feet along the Portneuf River to 7,500 feet on the WMA‚Äôs timbered ridges. The west-facing slope of the WMA is traversed by four creeks and several smaller drainages. Annual precipitation ranges from ten to fourteen inches, half of which falls during the growing season. Summers are hot and dry, with temperatures reaching as high as 103o. Winters are cold and dry; severe storms can cause the mercury to plunge to -30F. While snow can accumulate to a depth of 36 inches on the high slopes of the WMA, lowland areas rarely receive such accumulations. The lack of snow in these areas allows forage to remain exposed or just below the snow surface. Available forage attracts deer and elk to the area during winter months. Benchtop areas were dry-farmed in the past, but are now being reclaimed by mountain shrubs. History Robber's Roost Canyon is an important habitat feature of the WMA, providing an important riparian corridor and yellowstone cutthroat trout spawning areas, but it is probably better known as a historic bandit hideout. During the 1860s, a stagecoach route passed through Portneuf Canyon linking Salt Lake City, Utah and Virginia City, Montana. The stage often carried gold from Montana mines to Salt Lake City banks. The narrow canyon and thick brush provided the perfect setting for stage robberies and bandits flocked to the area to ambush gold-laden stages. The site‚Äôs popularity with men on the wrong side of the law eventually earned it the name ‚ÄúRobber‚Äôs Roost.‚Äù A now legendary stage holdup occurred in 1865. The Pocatello Tribune provided this account of the heist: ‚Äúa stage of the Concord type, carrying several passengers and $60,000 worth of gold was betrayed by its driver, Frank Williams, to a gang led by Jim Locket. As he rounded a steep hill, Williams turned his horses and the road agents, concealed in the brush which was so thick that it scratched the sides of the coach, gave the word of halt. Among the passengers were two wealthy businessmen from St. Louis. Apprehensive of being held up, they armed themselves for the journey. At the cry ‚Äòhands up!‚Äô, the passengers opened fire bringing upon themselves a volley that killed both of them and two other men.‚Äù Legend has it that the outlaws buried their loot in the Robber‚Äôs Roost area. As years passed, one story then another told of a captured outlaw who confessed to his part in the holdup. The lure of stolen gold attracted many people to the area. When homesteaders settled the area, they spoke of watching strangers armed with shovels, tape measures and crude maps scour the hillsides of Robber‚Äôs Roost, but ultimately leaving empty handed. To this day, many people believe that the stolen gold remains hidden somewhere in Robber‚Äôs Roost. Visitors are welcome to explore Robber's Roost Canyon, but digging and resource damage are not permitted.

Paint Creek House belonged to the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) and Fort Vermilion to the North West Company (NWC). For background see Saskatchewan River fur trade. Usage In use from 1802 to 1816, both forts were on the north bank of the river across from Lea Park, which is at the mouth of the Vermilion River. They were inside a common stockade for protection, with Paint Creek House on the east and Fort Vermilion on the west. The location on the north bank also provided some protection from the Plains Indians to the south. Fort Vermilion was also known as Lower Fort des Prairies. History The 1802 foundation date is not certain. In 1808, Alexander Henry 'The Younger' was in charge for the NWC and Henry Hallet for the HBC. Alexander Henry's journals indicated the post had 106 people (30 servants and their families). In September 1809, Henry returned from Fort William, Ontario, and found some 300 tents of Blackfoot waiting for his trade goods. While trading he kept a swivel gun pointed at their camp to ensure good behavior. In 1810, both companies decided to move upriver to Fort Edmonton #3 at the northernmost point on the river; Fort Edmonton #2 was moved downstream at the same time, while the NWC post of Fort Augustus was paired with Edmonton and moved with it. The move started that spring but the old forts remained open. When Gabriel Franch√®re arrived in 1814, he found some 90 people there but few provisions to buy. Both posts were closed permanently in May 1816. Around 1980, there were a few cellar holes in a clearing at the end of a dirt road east of the Alberta Highway 897 bridge. The archeological site was designated a provincial historic resource in 1976.

It depicts the installation of the Sigismund Bell in the Wawel Cathedral in Krak√≥w in 1521. The bell was installed in the Sigismund Tower and rung for the first time on 13 July 1521. The bell is considered to be one of the national symbols of Poland. This painting is one of a number of historical paintings by Matejko. It shows a crowd of people, with a number of identifiable figures of historical importance. It conveys the Golden Era of the Polish Renaissance, and the power of the Kingdom of Poland. There are several alternative names for the painting. They include The consecrating of the Sigismund bell... (Po≈õwiƒôcenie dzwonu Zygmunta...), as proposed by Mieczys≈Çaw Treter, The raising of the Sigismund bell..., King Sigismund's Bell, or just Sigismund Bell (Dzwon Zygmunta). History The Sigismund Bell painting was created in 1874. During his work, Matejko commissioned craftsmen to create a replica of a scaffolding that was used to move the bell, and he identified its likely original location, in order for it to be portrayed realistically. There are numerous anecdotes associated with this painting. Matejko used his family for models, and likely the painting contains nearly all the members of his family. The painting was well received by contemporaries, and Stanis≈Çaw Tarnowski published an extensive and positive review in 1875 in PrzeglƒÖd Polski. The work was displayed in Paris in 1875, and probably contributed to Matejko's recognition by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise; three years later it was displayed there again, during the Exposition Universelle (1878), and (together with two other paintings ‚Äì the Unia lubelska (Union of Lublin) and Wac≈Çaw Wilczek) yielded him an honorary golden medal. The painting is in the collection of the National Museum, Warsaw. Composition and significance Matejko was deeply interested in the era of the Renaissance in Poland, and this painting is one of a number of historical paintings that he set in that period. Marek Rezler, Z MatejkƒÖ przez polskie dzieje: Zawieszenie dzwonu Zygmunta . Interklasa: polski portal edukacyjny. Retrieved 3 June 2012. The composition is very colorful, yet realistic. It conveys the Golden Era of Polish Renaissance, and the power of the contemporary Kingdom of Poland, both its elites and the common people. The left side of the painting is focused on the richness and glory of the era, while the right notes the hard work of ordinary people that made this greatness possible. Although the painting is usually known as The hanging of the Sigismund bell.., in fact it shows not the moment of hanging but the moment of the bell's emergence from the mold in which it was cast. The painting shows a crowd, with a number of identifiable figures of historical importance. On the left, there is the royal court, but only the king, Sigismund I, his family (including queen Bona Sforza), and the court jester, Sta≈Ñczyk, can be identified. Sigismund, the patron of the Sigismund Bell, and his son Sigismund August, were Polish kings that inspired other works of Matejko, including The Babin Republic (1881) and The Founding of the Lubranski Academy in Pozna≈Ñ (1886). Sigismund I's portrayal on the Hanging... painting is the one where Matejko shows him with pride and respect. Other figures in the court include banker Jan Boner, merchant and official Seweryn Bethman, and castellan and voivode Stanis≈Çaw Kmita. Bishop Jan Choje≈Ñski is also shown on the painting, consecrating the bell, with canon Grzegorz Lubra≈Ñski nearby.SPACER PO MUZEUM NARODOWYM W WARSZAWIE.

Outside the court, master bell-founder Hans Beham is seen above the bell. Between him and the court there are two dark- clad figures. These are the Wawel architect Bartolommeo Berrecci, and a musician, Valentin Bakfark, who according to a legend threw a string from his instrument into the melted bronze (in fact, he arrived in Poland two decades after the bell was cast). In the background, Wawel Castle can be seen. As he would often do, Matejko included people whom he considered significant for the era, but who could not be present in the scene, like Sigismund I's son, Sigismund II August, who would have been only one year old. In 1885 Matejko would paint a sequel-like picture, Zygmunt I s≈ÇuchajƒÖcy Dzwonu Zygmunta (Sigismund I listening to the Sigismund Bell), showing an older Sigismund and Sta≈Ñczyk, contemplating the passing of their era.

Her family was severely persecuted following her father being labeled a rightist in the Anti- Rightist Campaign of 1957. Her writing, which consists mostly of short fiction, breaks with the realism of earlier modern Chinese writers. She has also written novels, novellas, and literary criticisms of the work of Dante, Jorge Luis Borges, and Franz Kafka. Some of her fiction has been translated and published in English.  Life  Deng Xiaohua was born in 1953 in Changsha, Hunan, China. Her early life was marked by a series of tragic hardships which influenced the direction of her work. She was one of six children born to a man who was once the editor-in-chief of the New Hunan Daily (). Her parents, like many intellectuals at the time, were denounced as rightists in the Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957. Her father was sent to the countryside for two years in retribution for allegedly leading an anti- Communist Party group at the paper. Two years later the entire family was evicted from the company housing at the paper and moved to a tiny hut below the Yuelu Mountain, on the rural outskirts of Changsha. In the years that followed, the family suffered greatly under further persecution. Her father was jailed, and her mother was sent along with her two brothers to the countryside for re-education through labor. Deng was allowed to remain in the city because of her poor health. After being forced to leave the small hut, she lived alone in a small, dark room under a staircase. By the time of the Cultural Revolution, Deng was thirteen years old. Her formal education was permanently disrupted after completing primary school. Can Xue describes the horrors of her youth in detail in her memoirs titled ‚ÄúA Summer Day in the Beautiful South‚Äù which is included as the foreword to her short story collection Dialogues in Paradise. Throughout this period, her entire family ‚Äústruggled along on the verge of death.‚Äù Her grandmother, who raised her while her parents were gone, soon succumbed to hunger and fatigue, dying with severe edema, a grotesque swelling condition. While the family was forced to scavenge food, eventually eating all of the wool clothes in the house, Can Xue contracted a severe case of tuberculosis. Later she was able to find work as a metalworker. Ten years later, in 1980, after giving birth to her first son she quit work at the factory. She and her husband then started a small tailoring business at home after teaching themselves to sew. She began writing in 1983 and published her first short story in 1985, at which point she chose the pen name Can Xue. This pen name can be interpreted either as the stubborn, dirty snow left at the end of winter or the remaining snow at the peak of a mountain after the rest has melted. Publishing under a pen name allowed Can Xue to write without revealing her gender. According to Tonglin Lu (a Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of Montreal) once critics found out she was a woman, her ‚Äúsubversive voice within the supposedly subversive order [of avant-garde fiction]‚Äù made them uncomfortable. (Tonglin Lu coined this \\"double subversion.\\") Not only was she writing avant-garde fiction, but she was also a woman‚Äîso male writers and critics attempted to analyze her works by psychoanalysis of the author, and some even went so far as to suggest she was certifiably insane. In 2002, she said, \\"Lots of [the critics] hate me, or at least they just keep silent, hoping I'll disappear. No one discusses my works, either because they disagree or don't understand.‚Äù More recently, however, many critics have paid tribute to her work, drawn to the careful precision she uses to create such a strange, unsettling effect on the reader.  Work  Can Xue's abstract style and unconventional narrative form attracted a lot of attention from critics in the 1990s. A variety of interpretations of her work have been published, but political allegory has been the most popular way of understanding her early short stories. Many of the images in her stories have been linked to the Cultural Revolution, the Anti-rightist Movement and other turbulent political movements of the early People's Republic of China. However, direct references to these events are uncommon. The author herself explicitly denies most forms of political commentary others claim to have found in her work, stating once in an interview, \\"There is no political cause in my work.\\" On the contrary, Can Xue says she treats each story as a kind of life experiment in which she is the subject. ‚ÄúIn very deep layers,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúall of my works are autobiographical.‚Äù As for those who struggle to find meaning in her stories, Can Xue has this to say: \\"If a reader feels that this book is unreadable, then it‚Äôs quite clear that he‚Äôs not one of my readers.‚Äù Can Xue has also written part of the libretto for at least one opera. In 2010, Can Xue and Lin Wang ( web) co-wrote the libretto for a contemporary chamber opera Die Quelle (The Source) commissioned to Lin Wang by M√ºnchener Biennale. The opera is based on Can Xue's published short story ‚Ä≥the Double Life‚Ä≥. In this opera, a young artist named Jian Yi was deconstructed into different aspects played by different roles. They crosstalk to each other on stage; drying and bubbling-up of the spring symbolize loss and regain of one's own identity. Lin Wang composed the music for Die Quelle (85' in length). Chinese instruments Sheng, Guzheng and Sanxian were used. An unusual feature is combination of English pronunciation and Chinese intonation in this opera. Die Quelle was premiered on May 9, 2010 in Munich Biennale and broadcast live.http://www.muenchener- biennale.de/archiv/2010/programm/events/event/detail/die-quelle/  Bibliography  As of 2009, Can Xue had published a total of three novels, fifty novellas, 120 short stories, and six book-length commentaries.
