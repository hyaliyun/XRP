These plants are perennial and xerophytic gymnosperm shrubs.  Description  Ehpedra alata is a small terrestrial shrub or Chamaephyte. It is found primarily in dry desert environments. It is a dioecious shrub, usually less than 1 meter in height. This shrub has rigid and branched stems. This desert plant species does not possess spines and is non-succulent. The leaves are very short (about 3-6mm) and are united toward the base of the plant, forming leaf sheaths. The leaf arrangements are organized in an opposite pattern, with two leaves per node. The leaves are termed scale leaves because they are thick. This plant is known as conifer because the reproductive portions of this species are organized in yellow-green cones. The male, staminate cones are oval, 3-8mm long, organized in dense clusters, with 3-6 stipitate microsporangia. The female, or ovulate cones are found at the nodes of the stems. The ovulate cones are oval, up to 10mm long, with 4-5 pairs of overlapping yellow bracts surrounding two ovules. The seeds present in the ovulate cones are oval and acuminate in shape. This plant species flowing/fruiting season is between March and May. The roots of this plant are very fibrous and help the plant firmly anchor in sandy soil.  Taxonomy  It was originally described by Joseph Decaisne in 1834 and placed in section Alatae, tribe Tropidolepides by Otto Stapf in 1889. In 1996 Robert A. Price left E. alata in section Alatae without recognizing a tribe.Price, R. A. (1996). Systematics of the Gnetales: A review of morphological and molecular evidence.

Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt #Ephedra alata subsp. monjauzeana Dubuis & Faurel  Algeria  Distribution and habitat  This xerophytic shrub is found in desert and arid environments. It is native to many areas throughout northern Africa, mainly Morocco and the Sahara, and spanning throughout the Middle East. This shrub grows in dense clumps, on sandy calcareous, rocky and clay soils. This species is often found near Wadis or other arid sand dunes, with minimal water. This species grows between the elevations of 50 meters to 1200 meters. The plants diaspores are dispersed by strong winds. These plants fibrous roots help to anchor the plant in shifting sand dunes, control sand erosion and are tolerant to saline soils. The stem of this plant contain alkaloid ephedrine, and other antimicrobial chemicals, which help protect this plant from disease. This species is not considered for conservation concerns as it is wide-ranging across the globe and commonly found in its natural environments. Seeds from this species have been obtained and stored for the Millennium Seed Bank Project because it is unclear if this species population is sustainable with its wide range of uses.  Uses  Ehpedra alata is used for medicinal purposes. The stem of this plant contain alkaloid ephedrine which is a medicine used for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory ailments. Other chemical are also present in the plant that are used for medicines. These medicines are used to treat circulatory disorders, kidney disorders, digestive system disorders and eye disorders. The stems and roots of this species is also used for it fibrous characteristic to make string, cords and twine. These portions may also be used for tannins, used in the process of dying or tanning materials. These plants are used for dye by grinding the plant portion, and placing the ground plant portions, with the desired dyed material in boiling water for 1‚Äì3 days. These plants are also used for consumption by animals such as camelidae, bovines and caprines.Bell, A. & Bachman, S. 2011. Ephedra alata.

(Daniel) Schulman is a physician, medical researcher, and biomedical entrepreneur in the fields of genetics diseases and human reproduction. Life Schulman was born in 1941 in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1966 and trained in pediatrics, genetics, and obstetrics & gynecology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, National Institutes of Health, and Cornell-New York Hospital Medical Center. Schulman worked at Cambridge University with Drs. Robert Geoffrey Edwards and Patrick Steptoe helping to develop the first methods for successful human in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Career In 1974, Schulman joined the staff of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development where he headed the Section on Human Biochemical Genetics, and founded and was first Director of the Interinstitute Program in Medical Genetics. He remained at the National Institutes of Health until 1983. During this period, the major research contributions of Schulman and his associates were in the field of the inborn errors of metabolism, especially diseases of sulfur metabolism. They demonstrated that cystinosis is a lysosomal storage disease caused by hereditary absence of the transmembrane lysosomal carrier for cystine, and proved that the enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was not, contrary to current theory, required for normal transcellular amino acid transport. Schulman and David Cogan of the National Eye Institute were also the first to utilize cysteamine eyedrops for treatment of the painful photophobia and ocular crystals characteristic of cystinosis, and this treatment is widely utilized today. The prevention of abnormal genital masculinization in female fetuses with congenital adrenal hyperplasia by prenatal administration of dexamethasone to the mother, first proposed and utilized by Schulman and his colleagues at NIH, has also become a widely accepted therapy. In 1984, Schulman founded the Genetics & IVF Institute, which has pioneered the development and early introduction of numerous innovative diagnoses and treatments in human genetics and infertility, and is now an international company in these fields. The Institute was the first in the United States to introduce transvaginal non-surgical IVF (replacing laparoscopy and now the standard method worldwide), and also to report pregnancies using ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) for the treatment of severe male infertility. The Institute also was one of the first centers in the world to introduce chorionic villus sampling (CVS) as an earlier alternative to amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis, the first to offer clinical testing for certain common mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes which cause a significant fraction of hereditary breast cancers, and the first to offer prenatal testing for cystic fibrosis. Schulman and associates also developed the world's first system for the use of non-disclosing preimplantation genetic testing for the prevention of Huntington disease. More recently, Schulman and his colleagues have established that flow-cytometric sorting (MicroSort) of living human sperm can greatly modify the proportion of viable X-bearing and Y-bearing sperm and that such technology can substantially increase the proportion of girls or boys born after insemination with sorted sperm. The Institute under Schulman's direction was also responsible for starting the first modern genetics/infertility treatment center in China, and this facility in Shanghai is currently one of the largest IVF programs in the world. Schulman was CEO of the Genetics & IVF Institute until 1998, and remains Chairman of its Board of Directors. Until recently he was also an affiliate professor at the medical schools of Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of California - San Diego. Additional information on Schulman and his work is provided in Marquis Who's Who and various online sources including the Medline database of biomedical publications. Schulman is the author of Robert G. Edwards A Personal Viewpoint, a personal account of Nobel Laureate, Robert G. Edwards, and events that are relevant to the development of modern methods of assisted reproduction.

His music, which was popular from the 1570s through the 1590s, was noted for its combination of the light canzone alla napolitana with the literary and musical sophistication of the madrigal. He appears to have written only secular vocal music. Life Little is known of his life but what can be inferred from the dedications to his madrigal books. He was born in Correggio in Reggio Emilia. In 1575 he dedicated a book of madrigals to Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, the Spanish Viceroy of Naples, and described himself as being in that man's service. Whether he lived in Naples at the time, or elsewhere in the Spanish Kingdom of Naples, is not known. Since his only publications after 1575 are reprints ‚Äì in copious quantity ‚Äì he may have died around that year. Unusually for a popular composer of the time, he seems to have held no positions either in aristocratic courts or religious institutions for which records have been kept.Shindle/DeFord, Grove onlineEinstein, vol. II p. 598-9 Music and influence Conversi's music is distinguished by its marriage of the lightness of the Neapolitan villanella, also known as the canzone alla napolitana, with the more serious and literary character of the madrigal. The combination was successful, and Conversi's music was reprinted often during the late 16th century; his music appeared in anthologies as far away as England. His first collection, a book of canzoni alla napoletana for five voices originally published in 1572, went through no less than seven reprints before 1589.Shindle/DeFord, Grove onlineEinstein, vol. II p. 598-9 Another publication of Conversi's, possibly posthumous, is a volume of madrigals for six voices which appeared in 1584, but which was probably a reprint of an earlier volume, the original for which has been lost. Yet another book of madrigals, for five voices, is mentioned in a 1604 catalogue of publications by the Florentine Giunti firm of booksellers and printers, but no copy of it has yet been found.Einstein, vol. II p. 598Bridges, Grove online Conversi rarely (if ever) set verse by living poets, preferring writers such as Petrarch, Pietro Bembo, Castiglione, and Luca Contile. Nowhere is his tendency to use sharp contrasts to underline and enhance his texts more apparent than in his setting of Petrarch's Zefiro torna, a setting which was evidently known to Claudio Monteverdi, whose own version in his Sixth Book of Madrigals is considerably more famous. The form of the poem is a Petrarchan sonnet, and Conversi sets the octave, which celebrates the return of springtime, with a quick and light patter of notes drawn from the pastoral Neapolitan canzona; and the sestet, in which the lover mourns the loss of his beloved, arrives in a sombre and slow G minor.Einstein, vol. II p. 598-9Bridges, Grove online Some of Conversi's vocal textures show the influence of instrumental music, as they have homophonic and dancelike sections easily playable on instruments without changing a note. Orazio Vecchi was likely familiar with these works, as is evident from his own compositions in the style. While Vecchi held a post in Correggio in the 1580s, it is not known if the two men were acquaintances.J. Hol, Horatio Vecchi's weltliche Werke, mentioned in Einstein, vol.

Auxis, commonly and collectively called the frigate tunas, is one of five genera of tunas which comprise the Thunnini tribe. Species There are four species in the genus Auxis, which were formerly regarded as two polytypic species, each with two subspecies. * Auxis brachydorax Collette & Aadland, 1996 * Auxis eudorax Collette & Aadland, 1996 * Auxis rochei Risso, 1810 (Bullet tuna) * Auxis thazard Lac√©p√®de, 1800 (Frigate tuna) Description Auxis can reach a length of . They have a strong, fusiform body with a sharpened head. The teeth are small and conical. The two dorsal fins are separated by a wide gap. The pectoral fins are short. They have a dark, blue-black back, the top of the head may be deep purple or almost black. The belly is whitish and without streaks or spots. Distribution These fishes are widespread in all tropical and subtropical seas and oceans, and both mentioned species are present in the Mediterranean Sea with their subspecies (A. thazard thazard and A. rochei rochei'‚Äô).  Ecology  Auxis species are the predominant prey of pelagic gamefish off of the east coast of the United States. As food In Japan the two species in the genus are collectively called , and this is also the common genus name. In Japanese cuisine, these fish are processed into , a product much like , though not really used in fine-dining restaurants or as condiment, but as a fish stock ingredient at more budget type popular-dining places, e.g., noodle shops. Although fresh fish might be eaten as sashimi or grilled, it has a lot of dark-red meat (), so it is valued much less than the similar ' (skipjack tuna). And it degrades quickly so shipment out to market is limited. The frigate tuna () is considered superior between the two.

Leonardo Cota (1816-1887) was born during the Mexican War of Independence in Mexico, the son of Guillermo Cota. Leonardo Cota married Maria Rosa Yorba, daughter of Californio Rancho Ca√±√≥n de Santa Ana owner Bernardo Yorba. At the time of the Placerita Canyon gold discovery of 1842, Cota was a clerk-registrar at Pueblo de Los Angeles, under the services of his cousin, Governor Pio Pico, who would be known as the last governor of Alta California under Mexican rule. During this time, Pio Pico speculated on the success of the gold strike, and made Pueblo de Los Angeles, the regional capital of Alta-California. At the start of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Leonardo Cota enlisted with the Californios, along with his cousin, Andr√©s Pico, the brother of Governor Pico. Together, both would reach the rank of Captain, but due to the influence of Pico's brother, Andres would be raised to the rank of General in charge of the Californios. Being good with weapons on horseback, Cota would command the Californio Lancers. In the many battles he participated in Alta-California, Cota would be remembered for his role at The Battle of San Pasqual, where he and his men were discovered in the San Pasqual Valley by a small group of U.S. Army soldiers. When the soldiers of General Stephen Watts Kearny came into the valley to engage Cota and his men, they were routed by \\"Capitan Cota's Lancers\\". With the additional quick response of General Pico's army, they forced Kearny and his men toward what is today called Mule Hill, where a standoff ensued. Several days later, Pico's army withdrew in response to U.S. Army re-enforcements from San Diego. After the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, and the California Republic becoming part of the United States, Leonardo Cota acquired additional land in California, and continued to play a prominent position in Pueblo de Los Angeles. Cota became one of the early Los Angeles County Supervisors in 1853. Leonardo Cota would later retire to his adobe homestead in what is today the city of Covina, California. In 1850, he would be one of the founders of the city of Santa Ana, California in Orange County. He died in Southern California in 1887. Guillermo Cota Juan Ignacio Guillermo Cota (1768-1844) was born in Loreto, Baja California. He was the son and nephew of Pueblo Los Angeles escorto soldier-founders, Roque and Antonio Cota.Alf√©rez Pablo Antonio Cota (1744-1800) Guillermo Cota was a comisionado of Pueblo de Los Angeles, and mayor of Los Angeles. He had four children by his first marriage in 1794 to Maria Manuela Elizalde (1777-1803). After her death, Guillermo Cota married Maria Manuela Nieto (1788‚Äì1832) who inherited Rancho Los Cerritos at the death of her father, Manuel Nieto, in 1804. They had twelve children including Francisco Cota, Leonardo Cota, and Maria Engracia Cota-Dominguez (see:Manuel Dominguez). Francisco Cota Francisco Cota (1825-1906) was born in Spanish Colonial Mexico, the son of Guillermo Cota, and brother of Leonardo Cota, Maria Engracia Cota-Dominguez.

Their musical style is pop-oriented, with elements of garage punk, doo-wop and hard rock. Due to their apparent obsession with B-movies and black humour, their fanbase extends to the gothic rock, deathrock and psychobilly scenes. The majority of their lyrical content deals with themes of horror and science fiction.  History   Formation  Zombina met Doc Horror at Calderstones School in 1998. They started a band called The Deformed, producing a demo tape \\"No Sleep 'Til Transylvania\\", in early 1999 . This tape featured songs that would later be featured on Zombina and The Skeletones albums: \\"The Grave... And Beyond!\\", \\"Braindead\\" and \\"Leave My Brain Alone\\". Since the early years of their formation, the band established a strong B-Movie informed horror theme recalling the early efforts of Misfits and The Cramps.  Career  Zombina performs with the band in London in May 2009 In 2005, Zombina and The Skeletones were a featured unsigned band on Mark Radcliffe's show on BBC Radio 2.

August 6, 1922. was an American labor leader and organized crime figure active in the Chicago, Illinois, labor movement in the 1910s and 1920s. He was president of the influential Chicago Building and Construction Trades Council, a coalition of construction unions, for nine months in 1922. Early career Fred Mader was born in Chicago in 1883. When he was 14 years old, he went to work for a year at Marshall Field's running cash from the safe to the counters. He worked for a stockbroker for three years, and then spent a year working for a company which installed light fixtures in homes and apartment buildings. He moved to New York City for nine months and worked as a fixture hanger there for nine months before returning to Chicago. Once back in Chicago, Mader joined Local 381 of the Fixture Hangers' Union, and by 1915 was the local's assistant business agent.\\"U.S. Indicts 100.\\" Chicago Daily Tribune. April 28, 1915. His job was to roam construction sites, ensuring that the terms of union contracts were honored by employers.Palladino, Grace. Skilled Hands, Strong Spirits.

He was also influential in the electrical workers' union. Mader's growing importance and power within Chicago's labor movement led him to be elected president of the Chicago Building and Construction Trades Council (BCTC) on February 17, 1922. A split had emerged in the BCTC over whether to accept an arbitration award lowering wages throughout the city's construction industry, and the faction opposing the award was ousted from its leadership positions.Haber, William.

She was known as the \\"Guardian Angel\\" for her efforts to help the \\"Prisoners of Zion\\" in the Soviet Union. Biography Nudel was born in 1931 in Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai, in the Russian SFSR. In 1970, she heard of the Dymshits-Kuznetsov hijacking affair, and decided to emigrate. She contacted a Jew named Vladimir Prestin, a known refusenik who was secretly teaching Hebrew.Segal (1996), pp. 67‚Äì68 In 1970 she first sought an exit visa to leave the USSR, saying she couldn't stand its discrimination against Jews. The authorities refused, saying she possessed state secrets she had learned working for the Moscow Institute of Planning and Production. Her sister, Elena, received permission to leave with her husband and son in 1972.Slater & Slater (2006), p. 192 In the summer of 1972 she organized a hunger strike at the central office of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to protest the arrest of refusenik Vladimir Markman. After four days, the police ended the strike by blocking their entry.Segal (1996), p. 69 She started a campaign for keeping contact with prisoners of Zion who called her \\"Mama\\" and \\"The angel of mercy\\".Slater & Slater (2006), pp. 192‚Äì193 She spread word about items the prisoners needed and were permitted to possess, and requested them from visitors from all over the world. These included vitamins, warm underwear and chocolate, as well as pens, cigarettes, and three-dimensional postcards, that could be exchanged with the guards for small favors.Segal (1996), p. 72 She soon lost her job. In June 1978 she placed a banner in her apartment in Moscow reading \\"KGB, give me my visa to Israel\\". She was sentenced to four years of internal exile. She was sent to Krivosheino, on the River Ob, Siberia. For several months, she was the only woman in a factory dormitory, before finding herself a log hut and a job as a night guard at a truck yard. The KGB warned the residents of the village to stay away from her. She kept receiving letters of support and corresponding with prisoners of Zion. She was released on March 20, 1982, having been warned not to associate with any refuseniks or foreigners. After almost a year in constant movement as she wasn't allowed back to her flat in Moscow nor gain permit to live in any other place, she was permitted to live for five years in Bender, Moldova. From 1973 her sister Elena Fridman fought to bring her to Israel, contacting world leaders for help. In April 1984, Jane Fonda visited her, a meeting arranged by political activist and publicist Stephen Rivers.Chmielewski, Dawn C. \\"Stephen M. Rivers dies at 55; Hollywood publicist and political activist\\", Los Angeles Times, June 9, 2010. Accessed June 10, 2010. The two became friends and Fonda launched a campaign for Nudel's release.Slater & Slater (2006), p. 193 Others involved in the campaign included Liv Ullmann, and Israeli President, Chaim Herzog, left an empty place at his Passover table in her honor. On October 2, 1987, she was informed she had been granted an exit visa. Immigration to Israel On October 15, 1987 Nudel arrived in Israel. She was greeted at the Ben Gurion International Airport by Fonda, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres as well as her sister and thousands of Israelis. She was granted an Israeli identity card and immigration papers, and had a brief telephone conversation with United States Secretary of State, George P. Shultz. The welcome ceremony was broadcast on Israeli television. She settled in Karmei Yosef, an agricultural community in the Judean foothills. She wrote an autobiography: \\"A Hand in the Darkness\\". The movie Mosca Addio (Farewell Moscow) by Mauro Bolognini, starring Liv Ullmann, was a dramatized version of her ordeal. In 1991, Nudel established \\"Mother to Mother,\\" a nonprofit organization funded by donations from abroad, seeking to take the children of Russian immigrants off the streets and into after-school activities. In 2001, she testified in the Jerusalem District Court in favor of Yuli Nudelman during Natan Sharansky's libel suit against him, who had published a book claiming that Sharansky was a former KGB agent with connections to the Russian mafia. In 2005, she petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel to force Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to use any measures necessary to save the lives of fifteen jailed Palestinian collaborators facing execution, and spoke against Israel's upcoming disengagement plan from Gaza and part of the West Bank. In 2007, she filed a petition to the High Court of Justice demanding that Israeli Internal Security Minister, Avi Dichter withhold visitation rights from Hamas and Hezbollah prisoners in Israel, as long as the Red Cross was prevented from seeing kidnapped Israel Defense Forces soldiers Gilad Shalit, Eldad Regev and Ehud Goldwasser.

History Toplou monastery is one of the most significant monasteries in Crete, dedicated to Panagia (Virgin Mary) and St. John the Theologian. It was founded around the mid 15th century, probably on the ruins of an earlier convent. The monastery was plundered by the knights of Malta in 1530 and shattered in 1612 by a strong earthquake. Due to its strategic position, the senate of the Republic of Venice, then ruler of Crete, decided to financially aid in rebuilding it. The monastery flourished until the surrender of eastern Crete to the Turks in 1646, after which it was abandoned for a long time. In 1704, it acquired special protection privileges from the Patriarch (i.e., stauropegic) and was re-inhabited. After its monks were slaughtered by Turks in 1821 during the Greek Revolution of Independence, Toplou was again deserted until 1828. In 1866, during the massive Cretan revolt against the Turks, it was once again devastated. During the German occupation of 1941-44, Toplou was providing shelter to resistance fighters and housed their wireless radio. When this was discovered by the Germans, the abbot and two monks were tortured and executed. Architecture Having to defend itself from pirates and invaders, Toplou monastery is heavily fortified, being laid out around a courtyard paved with sea pebbles and surrounded by strong, high square walls. In its present form it extends to about 800 square meters in three floors, divided into cells, guest houses, kitchens and warehouses. The main church (katholikon) is built as a two-nave basilica and the belltower dates back to 1558. Current status Despite its turbulent history, Toplou has many works of art to its possession. Today, it hosts an interesting exhibition of Byzantine icons, books and documents, a display of ancient engravings and a collection of artefacts which reflect its role in the historical events that influenced Crete during the last centuries. The monastery possesses a series of about 20 portraits of monks, despotes and igoumens painted by the famous portraitist Thomas Papadoperakis. Many of them have written the recent tragical history of the place. The walls of the monks' dining hall, the \\"trapezaria\\", are also adorned with remarkable fresco paintings by the icon painter Manolis Betinakis. The Cavo Sidero dispute UK-based Minoan Group (formerly Loyalward Group Plc) plans a ‚Ç¨1.2bn construction project on the Cavo Sidero peninsula that is located in the northeastern part of Crete. This land is owned by Toplou monastery and is leased for 80 years. Backed by strong political support, the so-called Cavo Sidero project is advertised as one of the largest tourist investments in Greece. It includes the construction of six tourist villages with 7,000 beds, three golf courses, a conference center a marina plus sport facilities. However, the Cavo Sidero peninsula is a Natura 2000 designated area of particular biodiversity and archaeological importance and home to the Vai natural palm forest, the largest of its kind in Europe. On top of that, it is one of the driest areas on Crete and the large amounts of water that would be required by the developments when in operation will have a tremendous negative impact on the environment.Harsh course of nature, The Guardian, 5 March 2008Trying to Be Green, With Very Little Water, The NY Times, 19 August 2007 Thus, despite the investors assurances that the project has been designed to operate according to the principles of sustainable development, there has been strong opposition against it by the local population and several environmental groups, including World Wide Fund for Nature.

He is credited with the invention of commercially viable colour printing. Though colour printing had been developed in China centuries before, it was not commercially viable. However, in early years of the 19th century the process of colour printing had been revived by George Savage, a Yorkshireman in London.Lycett, p 8 It was to be Savage's methods upon which Baxter, already an accomplished artist and engraver, was to improve. In 1828, Baxter began experimenting with colour printing by means of woodblocks.  Baxter's life  George Baxter, from a photograph supplied by Mr. Frederick Harrild, taken from the original in the possession of the family. Baxter was born in 1804 in Lewes, Sussex, and was the second son of John Baxter, a printer. At 20, Baxter was illustrating books printed by his father; at 23, Baxter moved to London to be apprenticed to Samuel Williams, a wood engraver. In 1827, Baxter set up his own business and married Mary Harrild, daughter of Robert Harrild, a printing engineer and a friend of Baxter's father. Baxter now began to experiment with his own methods of colour printing ‚Äì his first known colour print, Butterflies, was published in 1829.Etheridge 1929: 17‚Äì18 Baxter's experiments first bore commercial fruit in 1834, with two small vignettes published in Mudie's \\"British Birds\\".Lycett, p 6. In 1835, Baxter was granted Patent No. 6916 ‚Äì Improvements in Producing Coloured Steel Plate, Copper Plate and other Impressions, which outlined the combined intaglio and relief process he would continue to use for the next thirty years. Baxter's original patent ran for 14 years; after the renewal of his patent in 1849 for another five years, he began to sell licenses for the use of his printing process to other printing firms.Etheridge 1929: 18 Baxter prints bear an imprint such as \\"Printed in Oil Colours and Published by G. Baxter, Patentee, 11, Northampton Square\\" or \\"Baxter Patent Oil Printing 11 Northampton Square\\".George Baxter company website http://www.georgebaxter.com The house at 11 Northampton Square in Clerkenwell, London, was Baxter's home and workshop from 1844‚Äì1860. The site is marked by a plaque on the modern building at that address.London Remembers http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/george-baxter Despite his technical excellence and the general popularity of his prints, Baxter's business was never profitable ‚Äì his process was laborious and it seems likely that his perfectionism prevented him from completing many of his commissioned works on time.Mitzman 1978: 20, 49 In 1860, he held a sale of all his stock and equipment, most of which was not sold. Eventually, he sold his plates and blocks to the printer Vincent Brooks, who later republished some of Baxter's images.Etheridge 1929: 22‚Äì23 Baxter was declared bankrupt in 1865 and died in 1867, after an accident involving a horse omnibus.Lewis 1908: 29‚Äì30 It is estimated that Baxter himself printed over twenty million prints during his career.Mitzman 1978: 50  Baxter‚Äôs licensees  Joseph Martin Kronheim's illustration of Revelation 22:17. Shiny silver ink surrounds the flowers, a very light blue ink is used for the sky, and several types of printing are combined, with the various inks using different methods. A number of printers purchased a licence from Baxter, following the renewal of his patent in 1849. The most well known of these was Abraham Le Blond. Other firms who worked under Baxter's license include Bradshaw & Blacklock; William Dickes; Kronheim & Co.; Joseph Mansell and Myers & Co. Other printers known to have used Baxter's methods after his patent expired included George Baxter Jr.; Vincent Brooks; Edmund Evans; Gregory, Collins & Reynolds; Leighton Bros; Moor & Crosby and William Russell.Etheridge 1929: 26‚Äì27 George Cargill Leighton, a former apprentice of Baxter's, never worked under Baxter's licence but became a prominent printer in his own right, becoming the printer and later owner of the Illustrated London News, the first journal in the world to include regular colour plates. Leighton could not use a metal intaglio plate as a base without infringing upon Baxter's patent, although \\"‚Ä¶ the fact that he had to do without it probably helped to ensure his commercial success\\".McLean 1963: p139‚Äì140 Nevertheless, Leighton did often use an aquatint base.Peddie 1917: 45 Kronheim and Dickes both used Baxter's process from 1849 onwards, and both were large suppliers of colour plates to book publishers, \\"competing on price rather than quality\\".McLean 1963: 142 Baxter's patent process was not necessarily strictly followed by his licensees ‚Äì for example, both Kronheim and Dickes were lithographic printers as well as wood engravers, and most likely mixed all of their printing methods together. In fact, it is often impossible to say exactly how a given colour print of this era has been produced.McLean 1963: 142 Generally, Baxter's licensees used fewer colour blocks than Baxter himselfLewis 1928: 200 and, in the opinion of many, \\"none surpassed him in quality, being more concerned with cheapness\\".McLean 1963: 33  Baxter's method  Baxter's process for producing colour prints combined relief and intaglio printing methods. A 'key' plate was prepared, usually made of steel and using any combination of engraving, stipple, etching and aquatint. Baxter also appears to have used mezzotint and lithography to create his key plate on occasion. The key plate provided the main lines of the image and much of the tone, light and shade. It was usually printed in a neutral tone, such as light grey or terracotta.McLean 1963: 30 Often, Baxter used more than one colour to ink the key plate ‚Äì for example, to gradate the image from blue in the sky, to buff in the middle distance and to a darker colour in the foreground; i.e. inking the plate √† la poup√©e.Seeley 1924: 25Gascoigne 1986: Section 29 Usually, Baxter used aquatint for landscapes and stipple to work faces and figures.Lewis 1928: 199 Following printing of the key plate, relief blocks were prepared, usually from wood but also from zinc or copper, using impressions of the key plate to create the blocks.Wakeman and Bridson 1975: 8 Usually one block was prepared for each colour, although sometimes two or more colours or tints were included on the same block, requiring hand inking of each individual area. Each colour was applied and allowed to dry before adding the next colour. It is thought that Baxter started printing with a blue tint and then progressed through the other colours in a predetermined order ‚Äì all blocks were numbered sequentially and labelled with the colour to be used. Sometimes up to 24 separate colours were used, although ten could be considered an average number. Baxter achieved his precise registration by fixing the print over a number of spikes, over which the blocks would also fit.Seeley 1924‚Äì25: 3‚Äì4 & 12 Baxter is thought to have used hand-colouring for finishing touches on occasion ‚Äì for example, \\"‚Ä¶ extra touches of red on the mouths, high white lights upon jewels ‚Ä¶\\". It is also believed Baxter occasionally applied glaze via an additional printing step all over the image, composed of his usual varnish with a 'hard drier' added to make it insoluble in water. More often, it is thought that Baxter glazed areas of the print selectively by hand using a glaze composed of gum arabic, egg white and Castile soap.Seeley 1924‚Äì25: 18 Notes References *Etheridge, Ernest.

It was released on June 19, 2009, received mixed reviews and grossed $35 million. Plot Boris Yelnikoff is a cynical chess teacher and former Columbia professor in quantum mechanics. Divorced, he avoids human contact except for his three friends and students, patronizing everyone he meets for not matching him intellectually. He spends much of the film washing his hands, all the while singing the \\"Happy Birthday\\" song‚Äîan attempt to gauge the proper length of time for the process. Boris comes home one night to find Melody, a simpleminded 21-year-old, lying on his doorstep. He reluctantly lets her in for a meal and soon she tells him her story. She turns out to be of a distinctly Southern background, having been born to fundamentalist parents in Mississippi and ran away from them. She asks if she can stay the night, which Boris eventually allows, and she stays with him while she looks for a job. Melody develops a crush on Boris despite their age difference and their varying cultures and intelligence. Melody finds a job as a dog walker while still living with Boris. Out on the job, she meets Perry Singleton and they arrange a date. When she comes back home, she explains to Boris that she ultimately did not like Perry because he loved everything in the world too much. Boris realizes that he loves her and they get married. After a year passes, Melody's mother, Marietta finds Melody, explaining that she and her husband John thought Melody had been kidnapped. She goes on to tell her that John left her and sold their house after John lost money in the stock market. She meets Boris and is disappointed with him, so she tries to persuade Melody to end her marriage. The three go for lunch at a restaurant and meet Boris's friend Leo. As Marietta goes to use the restroom, Randy Lee James inquires about Melody. Marietta slyly decides to recruit him to end Melody's marriage. Later that evening, Leo, who had taken an interest in Marietta, asks her over for dinner. They spend the evening together, and discover that she is a talented photographer. Leo makes plans to contract her professionally. Boris explains to the audience that over the next few weeks Marietta changed and started experimenting in artistic photography, exotic new habits, and having an open relationship with Leo and his business partner, Morgenstern. Marietta still hates Boris and continues to arrange for Melody to marry Randy. She takes her to an outdoor craft market and \\"accidentally\\" runs into Randy, who questions her about her marriage. Melody initially sees past Marietta's attempt and tells him that her marriage is fine. She warns her mother to stop at once, but Marietta keeps trying. Later, shopping for clothes, Melody meets Randy in another planned encounter and he gets her to admit that her relationship with Boris is not entirely satisfying. He invites her to the boat he lives on, and the two end up kissing and beginning an affair. John arrives at Boris and Melody's home full of regret and hopes to get the family back together. They all go to Marietta's photography exhibit opening together, and he sees how his ex-wife has changed since she moved to New York. Distraught, he retreats to a bar, drinking away his misery. While there, he meets a recently divorced gay man, Howard, and admits something that he has known most his adult life: that he is also gay. Melody tells Boris she is in love with Randy. Boris is devastated and jumps out a window again, but this time lands on Helena, breaking her arm and leg. As he visits her in the hospital, he asks her if there is anything he can do to make it up to her, and Helena says she would like to go to dinner with him. Finally, Boris hosts a New Year's Eve party, at which everyone is seen in their new relationships: Marietta with Leo and Morgenstern, John with Howard, Melody with Randy, and finally Boris with Helena. Melody and her parents have completely shed their former Southern conservative mindsets and wholeheartedly adopted the liberal New York City way of life and values. (John tells that his former membership in the National Rifle Association had been but a sublimation of his repressed homosexuality.) They are now all the best of friends, and at midnight they kiss. Afterward Boris is revealed to be the only one who is able to communicate with the audience, and explains directly to them that one has to find all the enjoyment he can, to find \\"whatever works\\". Cast In addition, Adam Brooks and Lyle Kanouse portray Boris' two other unnamed friends. Release On February 2, 2009, Variety reported that Sony Pictures Classics had purchased U.S. distribution rights to Whatever Works. It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, on April 22, 2009. Sony gave the film a limited US release, beginning June 19, 2009. Maple Pictures released the film in Canada theatrically, and on DVD in October 2009. The film had its UK release on June 25, 2010. Production The film was shot in New York City, marking Allen's return to his native city after shooting four films in Europe. David was hesitant to take the role, pointing out to Allen that his work on Curb Your Enthusiasm was improvisation, but Allen encouraged him to take the role anyway. Partly to counter assertions that the film is autobiographical, Allen has pointed out that the script was written in the early 1970s, with Zero Mostel in mind for Boris; it was shelved after the actor's death in 1977. Thirty years later, Allen revisited the script in an attempt to create a film before a potential threat of a Screen Actors Guild strike. According to Allen, the only significant changes to the script involved updating the topical references.

Loaded with general cargo, construction equipment, and at times ammunition, in 1943 she completed 23 runs to Hawaiian ports as well as to American bases on Johnston, Palmyra, Christmas, Fanning, and Canton Islands. Shortly after the securing of Makin Island, in the Gilbert Islands, 23 November 1943, she arrived there with general cargo. She maintained her busy pace of operations in 1944 and included three round trips between Hawaii and Seattle, Washington. During the first six months of 1945 she made 13 supply runs to island bases in the Hawaiian perimeter. Malanao reached Pearl Harbor from her final cargo run 28 June 1945. She remained there until 28 September when she steamed to San Francisco, California, arriving 10 October. Post-war decommissioning She decommissioned at Mare Island 18 February 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy List 12 March 1946. Her hull was scrapped at Mare Island 4 June 1946.

The name Genasauria is derived from the Latin word gena meaning ‚Äòcheek‚Äô and the Greek word sa√∫ra (œÉŒ±œçœÅŒ±) meaning ‚Äòlizard.‚Äô Genasauria is the most inclusive clade within the order Ornithischia. According to Sereno (1986), Genasauria represents all ornithischians except for the most primitive ornithischian, Lesothosaurus. Sereno's formal definition is, ‚ÄúAnkylosaurus, Triceratops, their most recent common ancestor and all descendants.‚Äù It is hypothesized that Genasauria had diverged from Lesothosaurus by the Early Jurassic. Cranial features that characterize Genasauria include a medial offset of the maxillary dentition, a sprout-shaped mandibular symphysis, moderately sized coronoid process, and an edentulous (without teeth) anterior portion of the premaxilla. A distinguishing postcranial feature of Genasauria is a pubic peduncle of the ilium that is less robust than the ischial peduncle. Genasauria is commonly divided into Neornithischia and Thyreophora. Neornithischia is characterized by asymmetrical distributions of enamel covering the crowns of the cheek teeth, an open acetabulum, and a laterally protruding ischial peduncle of the ilium. Neornithischia includes ornithopods, pachycephalosaurs, and ceratopsians. Thyreophora is characterized by body armor and includes stegosaurs, ankylosaurs, Scelidosaurus, and Scutellosaurus. Distinguishing characteristics Cranial characteristics Genasauria contains a medial offset of the maxillary dentition (buccal emargination), which is commonly referred to as the ‚Äòornithischian cheek.' Other characteristics of the ornithischian cheek include ‚Äúa deep-set position of the tooth rows, away from the sides of the face, a spout-shaped front to the mandibles, and reduction in the size of the opening on the outside of the lower jaw (the external mandibular foramen).\\" The ornithischian cheek is largely inferred to be evidence for the possession of muscular cheeks that were used for complex chewing behavior and is a fundamentally Genasaurian characteristic. Galton (1973) also suggests that the ornithischian cheek was found between the maxillary and dentary ridges to prevent the loss of food through the jaws. It may have consisted of connective tissue and skin, rather than muscle fibers, which meant that the tongue was used to move food that had accumulated between the teeth and the cheek, back to the tongue side of the cheek so that it could be further broken down by the teeth. The ornithischian cheek is absent or only weakly developed in Lesothosaurus, which supports its placement as a sister group to Genasauria. In Genasauria, the mandibular symphysis is shaped like a spout and forms at an acute angle. The mandibular symphysis is the point of fusion between the two lateral dentary bones. The mandible of Genasauria is also characterized by the possession of a coronoid process that is longer than 50 percent of the depth of the midlength of the dentary.Weishampel, D. B., Dodson, P., & Osm√≥lska, H. (2004). The dinosauria. Univ of California Press. The coronoid process is a thin anterior projection of bone from the dentary, which serves as a site for the attachment of muscles that aid in chewing behavior. Post-cranial characteristics Post-cranial characteristics include reduced relative size of the pubic peduncle of the ilium and a fourth trochanter that is shifted distally on the shaft of the femur. The pubic peduncle of the ilium is an anterior extension of the ilium, which joins with the pubis. In Genasauria, the relative size of the public peduncle, compared to the size of the ilium, is reduced. The fourth trochanter is a process (extension) of the femur that serves as an attachment point for tail muscles, mainly for attachment of the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. Feeding behavior The members of Genasauria were primarily herbivores with some exceptions, like the omnivorous heterodontosaurids.Barrett, P. M., & Rayfield, E. J. (2006). Ecological and evolutionary implications of dinosaur feeding behaviour. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 21(4), 217‚Äì224. Genasaurians most often had their head at the level of one meter, which suggests they were feeding primarily on ‚Äúground-level plants such as ferns, cycads, and other herbaceous gymnosperms.\\"Fastovsky, D. E., & Weishampel, D. B. (2012). Dinosaurs: a concise natural history (2nd ed). Cambridge ; New York: Cambridge University Press. Major divisions Thyreophora Thyreophora are defined as representing all taxa more closely related to Ankylosaurus than to Triceratops and are characterized by extensive dorsal body armor scutes.Nopcsa, F. (1915). Die Dinosaurier der siebenb√ºrgischen Landesteile Ungarns: Von Franz Baron Nopcsa. Mit Tafel I-IV und 3 Figuren im Texte.[Umschlagtitel.]. Buchdruckerei des Franklin-Vereins. The group spanned about 100 million years, beginning in the early Jurassic through the late Cretaceous. During their time on earth, they gave rise to over 50 different species. They contain the groups Ankylosauria and Stegosauria, as well as, a number of basal forms such as Scelidosaurus,Owen, R. (1861). Palaeontology or a systematic summary of extinct animals and their geological relations. Black. Emausaurus, and Scutellosaurus.Colbert, E. H. (1981). A primitive ornithischian dinosaur from the Kayenta Formation of Arizona. Museum of Northern Arizona Press. Fossils of Thyreophora have been primarily found in the northern hemisphere. Thyreophora can be distinguished from Neornithischia based on: transversely broad process of the jugal and parallel rows of keeled scutes on the dorsal surface of the body. Neornithischia Neornithischia is a clade containing Ornithopoda and Marginocephalia, which is a node-based clade that contains Ceratopsia and Pachycephalosauria. Neornithischia was previously labeled as Cerapoda. However, this name has been more recently given a less inclusive definition. Neorniththischia evolved during the Jurassic period and persisted until the late Cretaceous period. Their fossils have only been found in the northern hemisphere. Neornithischia can be distinguished from the Thyreophora by the following derived characteristics: significant diastem between premaxillary and maxillary teeth, five or fewer maxillary teeth, and finger-like anterior trochancter. Classification Taxonomy This version of taxonomic classification is from The Dinosauria. * Genasauria ** Thyreophora *** Scutellosaurus *** Ankylosauria *** Stegosauria ** Neornithischia *** Ornithopoda *** Marginocephalia **** Ceratopsia **** Pachycephalosauria Phylogeny There is debate as to the placement of Lesothosaurus as a sister group to Genasauria as or as a basal member of Genasauria. Sereno (1986) argues that Lesothosaurus does not contain the defining Genasaurian synapomorphies of a medial offset of the maxillary dentition, a sprout-shaped mandibular symphysis, moderately sized coronoid process, and an edentulous (without teeth) anterior portion of the premaxilla, and a pubic peduncle of the ilium that is less robust than the ischial peduncle. Butler (2011) argues that the synapomorphies that should exclude Lesothosaurus from Genasauria have been described in Lesothosaurus specimens. Butler writes ‚ÄúThe position of Lesothosaurus within Neornithischia is supported by three unequivocal characters: reduction of the forelimb to less than 40% of the hind-limb length, presence of a dorsal groove on the ischium, and a strongly reduced, splint-like metatarsal one.‚Äù The following two cladograms illustrate the two opinions. The following is a cladogram based on the paper by Sereno (1986) that originally defined Genasauria. The following is a more recent cladogram based on an analysis by Butler et al. (2011).

After being missing for six months, her body was discovered by the Credit River in Mississauga on March 27, 2004. Min Chen, a Chinese citizen from Shanghai who was in Canada on a visa, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder on May 9, 2006. Chen confessed that he was kidnapping for ransom and her death was accidental. Background Zhang was nine years old at the time of her abduction and murder. Her parents were Raymond Zhang and Sherry Xu. She was in grade 4 and enrolled at the Seneca Hill Public School and in a gifted program. Her parents reportedly did not let her play alone without supervision on the front lawn of their house. Min Chen (; born January 30, 1983\\"From 'shy' boy to murderer\\" , Toronto Star, 11 May 2006.) is a Chinese native from Shanghai who had been living in Canada on a visa since 2001. His father is an airline executive and his mother is a police officer in Shanghai. They were giving him money at the time of the kidnapping.\\"Cecilia may have been killed for money: reports ,\\" CTV At the time of Zhang's kidnapping, Chen had stopped his studying English at Seneca College Newnham Campus, which is near Zhang's home in North York, Ontario. Chen also hadn't completed his grade 12 courses at a local private academy. According to police, Min Chen knew a female boarder who had lived at the Zhang home between September 2002 and March 2003 and had visited the Zhang home at least four times. Police said that Cecilia would have been comfortable in Chen's company under normal social circumstances. Abduction According to an agreed statement of facts read out in a Brampton, Ontario courthouse, Chen was failing in his college studies and feared deportation back to his native China. Being a broke visa student, he desperately needed $25,000 to enter into a marriage of convenience as a means of becoming a permanent resident in Canada. Chen entered Zhang's home through a kitchen window and removed her from her home between 3:00 AM and 4:00 AM, leaving by a side door. When Cecilia tried to scream, Chen covered her face with a towel and held his hand over her mouth. Cecilia had stopped struggling by the time Chen placed her inside the trunk of his car. When Chen checked on Cecilia later on, he discovered that she had stopped breathing.\\"Student pleads guilty to killing 9-year-old Cecilia Zhang ,\\" CBC According to Chen, Cecilia's death was the result of Chen's poorly planned kidnapping and not deliberate. The highly decomposed remains of Cecilia Zhang were subsequently found in a wooded area of Mississauga by the Credit River at Eglinton Avenue on Saturday, March 27, 2004. Investigators were unable to determine the cause of death and were unable to determine if she had been sexually assaulted due to the advanced decomposition. Trial Peel Regional Police had received a complaint about potential illegal fishing in the area on Sept. 18, 2003 near where the body was discovered. One of those stopped at the street check was Chen. His fingerprints were also found on a window screen of Zhang's house. Min Chen was arrested and charged with 1st degree murder. Chen was represented by criminal lawyer John Rosen, who had previously defended killer and serial rapist Paul Bernardo.\\"Chinese visa student admits to killing Cecilia ,\\" CTV via Sympatico/MSN Min Chen pleaded guilty to second-degree murder on May 9, 2006. He was sentenced to life imprisonment; under the \\"faint hope\\" provision then in effect, he was given the right to apply for parole after 15 years. During sentencing, Justice Bruce Durno, who presided over the case, questioned Chen's explanation of the events. He stated: ‚ÄúThis was not an accidental killing in the course of a bungled kidnapping‚Äù. Lacking an extradition treaty between the governments of Canada and the People‚Äôs Republic of China, human rights lawyers have noted that under Chinese law, when Chen completes his sentence and is deported back to China, he will likely face a second trial and sentence in China. Canadian law forbids this practice, known as double jeopardy, while Chinese law permits it if a Chinese resident commits a crime on foreign soil. Trial and punishment in the other country is seen as a mitigating factor, but does not preclude further imprisonment or execution in the People's Republic of China.\\"Is child killer here to stay?\\" , Toronto Star, 14 May 2006.

It was written by Ron Weiner and directed by Michael Engler. The episode first aired on December 6, 2007 on the NBC network in the United States. Guest stars in this episode include Reathel Bean, James Carville, Paul Eichel, Edie Falco, Melissa Gallagher, Jabari Gray, Blaine Horton, John Lutz, Erich McCall, Andrew Polk, Reshma Shetty, Tom Treadwell and Darlene Violette. In this episode, Celeste \\"C.C.\\" Cunningham (played by Edie Falco) wishes to go public with her relationship with Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin). Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) gets angry when she thinks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) lets Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) do anything he likes. Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) and James \\"Toofer\\" Spurlock (Keith Powell) feud over Toofer's status as a Harvard University alumnus. Plot Jack is worried when his girlfriend C.C., the Democratic congresswoman for the state of Vermont, tells him that she wants to go public with their relationship. The pair had been avoiding this because C.C. is suing the Sheinhardt Wig Company, the fictional parent company of NBC. During their secret relationship, Jack and C.C. had been sneaking to each other's house in disguises, including C.C. as a plumber named Mr. Spoonatelli. C.C. confides in Liz (after she finds out about their relationship), and Jack confides in political consultant James Carville, who gives Jack advice on how two important people from opposite political positions can make their relationship work \\"Cajun style\\", without regard for how others perceive them. Eventually, Jack takes C.C. to dinner in the GE executive dining room where he reveals his relationship to the other executives, leading to the other executives making some bizarre revelations of their own. When Jenna wins an award for her work on Mystic Pizza: The Musical: The Movie, in the category of \\"Best Actress in a Movie Based on a Musical Based on a Movie\\", Tracy is annoyed that he never wins any awards of his own and storms off the set. To get him back to work, Liz tells him that he has won a Pacific Rim Emmy Award for his work on TGS. Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) helps Liz stage a fake acceptance speech for Tracy, which is also attended by Tracy's co-stars, Jenna and Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), despite it taking place in the middle of the night. During his acceptance speech Tracy thanks everybody who works on the show, except for Jenna, and then pulls Jenna's dress down in a Japanese practice he claims is called \\"Sharking.\\" An enraged Jenna claims Liz is willing to jump through hoops for Tracy, but not her. As a result, she becomes disobedient and uncooperative and starts her own entourage, much like Tracy. Liz becomes fed-up with Jenna's new behavior, reveals to her that she in fact \\"coddle[s] the crap\\" out of her as well as Tracy. Liz then reveals that Jenna did not win an award for Mystic Pizza: The Musical: The Movie and that the \\"award\\" statue was actually a cookie. This is enough for Jenna to happily return to work.

Shipwreck After being commissioned under Captain Frederick Cornewall, Colchester took aboard a pilot to guide the ship out of the Nore anchorage and on to the Downs. Sailing on Sunday 21 October 1744, the ship ran aground between Long Sand and the Kentish Knock, and became stuck in weather that was 'not at all tempestuous.' A boat was sent back to the shore the following morning for help, and whilst the crew waited for it to return, another ship from the Nore arrived to offer assistance, having heard Colchester's cannons being fired in a signal of distress. The would-be rescuer was however kept from the stricken ship by the wind.Ships of the Old Navy, Colchester. In the afternoon of Monday 22 October, the fore and mizzen masts were cut away in an effort to prevent the ship working herself to pieces. This was deemed insufficient, for Captain Cornewall had the ship scuttled. That evening the main mast was also cut away as it was feared the ship might overset. With water now filling the ship, the crew were crammed onto the weather decks and bowsprit; on Tuesday morning lots were drawn to decide who could use the ship's longboat to get to safety. In spite of this, the ship's surgeon and 30 others took the longboat whilst the crew were drawing their lots; the boat subsequently sank, drowning 13. Four others who had jumped for the boat but missed were also drowned. The boat Colchester had sent away in the morning of 22 October returned with six fishing vessels on 23 October, but they were unable to come to the ship's aid until the following morning when the sea, which had worked up a little overnight, had calmed again. The captain and 365 men were saved; approximately 40 men and one lieutenant were lost in total. The court-martial for the loss of Colchester was held aboard on 14 February 1745. The pilot taken on to guide the ship to the Downs was sentenced to 12 months in the Marshalsea prison.

Koshland in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life.https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/biology/2002-03-29-life-pillars.htm One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying artificial and extraterrestrial life.Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216 The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.  The Seven Pillars   Program  Koshland defines \\"Program\\" as an \\"organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time.\\"Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216 In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of nucleic acids and amino acids, but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.  Improvisation  \\"Improvisation\\" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger environment in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is natural selection.  Compartmentalization  \\"Compartmentalization\\" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.  Energy  Because living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through entropy, energy is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in chemosynthesis.  Regeneration  \\"Regeneration\\" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in ageing. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.  Adaptability  \\"Adaptability\\" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through feedback and feedforward systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.  Seclusion  \\"Seclusion\\" is the separation of chemical pathways and the specificity of the effect of molecules, so that processes can function separately within the living system. In organisms on Earth, proteins aid in seclusion because of their individualized structure that are specific for their function, so that they can efficiently act without affecting separate functions.  Criticism  Y. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of primordial life and, though calling the concept \\"elegant,\\" point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non- differentiated earliest life.Zhuravlev, Y.

Born and educated in New York, the majority of his career was spent in Michigan where he held a variety of state offices. Howell also served as a judge in the newly formed Arizona Territory where he was a principal author of the territory's first legal code, the \\"Howell Code\\". Background Howell was born on July 8, 1810 in Goshen, New York to parents of moderate means. He was educated in public schools and was teaching by the age of 16 and editing a newspaper by the time he was 19. He changed professions at the age of 24, becoming an attorney and began practicing in Angelica, New York before moving to Jonesville, Michigan in 1837. Howell married his first wife, Sophia Brink, on May 24, 1828 and the couple had four children. Sophia died in January 1845, with one of the couple's daughters dying several months later. His second marriage was to Susan M. Hartwell on April 29, 1847. In 1853, the couple moved to Jackson, Michigan. Susan died August 27, 1856 and was survived by four children. Howell wed his third wife, Sarah Maria (Gray) Jones in 1857. The third marriage produced two children. Michigan Howell began his political career in 1840 when he was appointed district attorney for Hillsdale County. This was followed by his election to the Michigan Senate in 1843, a position he held through 1846. During his senate service, he became President pro tempore on January 6, 1845. Howell's senate service was followed by his becoming the presidential elector for Michigan's third district in 1848. In his role as elector, he voted for Lewis Cass. Howell was admitted to practice law in front of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1849. Among the causes he advocated were the right of married women to hold property in their own name, abolition of capital punishment, and the establishment of free public schools. With the establishment of the Republican Party, Howell left the Democratic Party. He served as a circuit court commissioner in 1854 and as a probate judge in 1855 and 1856. In 1857 he moved to Newaygo, Michigan and when Mecosta County was organized he became Mecosta County's first prosecuting attorney. Howell was elected to represent Newaygo County in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1861 through 1863. He was also Speaker pro-tempore for the 21st and 22nd legislatures. Arizona Territory Following the creation of Arizona Territory, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Howell to become a judge for the new territory. His commission as Associate Justice to the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court passed on March 10, 1863. Howell then traveled with Governor John N. Goodwin's party to new territory. Howell was assigned to Arizona's first judicial district, an area encompassing all of Arizona south of the Gila River and east of the 114th meridian west, and left the temporary capital at Fort Whipple for Tucson on February 3, 1864. Upon his arrival in Tucson, Howell was unhappy to find \\"two out of every three people in the area were barefooted\\" in his new district. His first court session began on May 31, 1864 and lasted for six days. A second session was scheduled to begin on last Tuesday in October. To simplify the administration of justice within the new territory, Howell saw the need for a coherent legal code and began the research needed to create one. With the assistance of his friend Coles Bashford, the judge consulted with local residents and explored the laws of several states. After 90 days effort, a 400-page tentative code was ready. In April 1864, Howell received word his wife was ill. Bashford requested Howell be given three months leave to see to his wife's needs and to look after his seven surviving children. The leave was granted and Howell left Tucson for Michigan on June 11, 1864. Howell Code In his address to the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature, Governor Goodwin called for the creation of a new legal code to replace the laws Arizona had inherited from New Mexico Territory. The legislature authorized the Governor to appoint a commissioner to create a possible code, and Goodwin selected Howell as the commissioner. Despite the fact the judge had already left the territory, his code was submitted to the legislature for consideration two days after his appointment as commissioner. The \\"Howell Code\\" was approved by the legislative session following considerable debate and some modifications. Territorial Secretary Richard C. McCormick observed the code was heavily influenced by the California and New York legal codes. Later life Howell returned to Newaygo, Michigan on July 22, 1864 to find his wife \\"very feeble\\". After requesting an extension to his leave of absence, he decided not to return to Arizona in early 1865 and instead requested appointment as an Indian Agent in Michigan. The nomination was delayed by President Lincoln and his successor, President Andrew Johnson, chose to nominate a different person. Newaygo remained Howell's residence until his death on April 3, 1870. His third wife, whose illness prompted his return from Arizona Territory, survived until January 5, 1882. Both were buried in the Newaygo Village Cemetery.

Mission  The SVT mission is to conserve land and protect wildlife habitat in the Concord, Assabet, and Sudbury river watersheds in eastern Massachusetts, one of the most scenic, culturally rich, and historically significant regions in the United States, for the benefit of present and future generations.  About SVT  SVT pursues its mission through land acquisition, land stewardship, advocacy, and education. SVT achieves its land protection objectives by working in close collaboration with landowners, businesses, local conservation commissions and government agencies. The work is performed by an active, community-based 17 member Board, a staff of 8, and 150 volunteers. The land acquisition objective emphasizes (1) protection of ecologically significant resources within SVT‚Äôs service area, with emphasis on priority areas, (2) protection of land possessing significant community and historic value (‚Äúflagship properties‚Äù), (3) increased acquisition of fee-simple properties, (4) increased receipt of gifts of interest in land, and (5) enhanced SVT land protection and outreach efforts. The stewardship objective emphasizes (1) increased opportunities for positive nature-based experiences on SVT reservations, (2) implementation of best management practices for conservation restriction and fee properties, and (3) demonstrated best practices for conservation of regional biodiversity. As of 2008, over 3,600 members supported SVT‚Äôs work in 36 different towns in the watershed. SVT is responsible for the protection and care of over 100 properties totaling more than of diverse conservation lands that include wetlands, sensitive habitats, trails and other open spaces including major reservations. SVT has taken a significant leadership role that has been instrumental in preserving an additional now under the permanent protection of public agencies, including the Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge. As of its annual meeting on September 28, 2008, SVT was nearing completion of the acquisition from the Knox Trail Council Boy Scouts of America of the development rights for the comprising the Nobscot Scout Reservation. SVT celebrated its 50th anniversary year in 2005, which culminated in its 50th annual meeting and birthday party on May 22, 2005 at Wolbach Farm in Sudbury. SVT reservations include trails for walking, bird watching, cross-country skiing and horseback riding. Those properties are open to the public free of charge.  History  SVT was founded in 1953. Upon returning to Wayland, Massachusetts after serving in the Marine Corps during World War II and the Korean War, Allen Morgan saw that the land he remembered being forest and farm as a child was rapidly being turned into homes and shopping malls. Realizing that the open spaces would be lost forever unless action was taken, he gathered together six friends (B. Allen Benjamin, Dr. George K. Lewis, Henry Parker, Willis B. Ryder, Richard Stackpole, and Roger P. Stokey) and founded Sudbury Valley Trustees to protect the natural resources of the area \\"on the theory that if we sat back and did nothing, certainly nothing would happen, and if we tried, maybe something would happen.\\" They mailed a form letter inviting people to become members for a fee of $3.00. SVT grew to a couple hundred members within a year or two. SVT publications emphasizing the importance of flood plain marshes led to the first flood plain zoning in the northeast. Thanks to SVT advocacy, most of the towns in the Sudbury Valley had established flood plain zones that protected upwards of without having to spend dollars to acquire them. SVT was an organization run purely through the efforts of volunteers until Morgan became SVT's first Executive Director in 1981. Morgan shepherded SVT's growth to a membership of just under 2,400, a staff of four full-time and four part-time employees, and nearly 60 parcels of land comprising nearly of land preserved by the time of his death in 1990.

History Madigan's operated as a junior anchor in the mall until the early 1990s, when its space was divided between Foot Locker and TJ Maxx, both of which opened in 1994. By 2005, TJ Maxx had been closed and replaced with Steve & Barry's. After that chain went out of business in 2009, its space was taken over by Conway, a division of National Stores. The Sears store was originally occupied by Montgomery Ward until that chain went out of business in 2001. The opening of Sears coincided with a $5 million renovation plan. In December 2010, portions of the film Contagion were filmed at the mall.

This station was settled by Dutch pioneers from Pennsylvania and was also known as New Holland Station. The station was one of a group of seven forts established on Beargrass Creek during this period in this area that is now a part of Louisville. The leader of the group was Hendrick Banta.Kentucky Historical Marker no. 1848 Kentucky Historical Society The group of settlers were a part of the \\"Low Dutch Company\\" and had their own bylaws, a formal charter, and accounting procedures. The group had as its purpose the preservation of the language, culture and religion of the Dutch.http://nealsgenealogy.byethost7.com/shkylowd.htm The Dutch traveled from a settlement near Harrodsburg to Low Dutch Station. The historic Brown Family Cemetery is in the southeast corner of Browns Park, about 1400 ft. southeast of the historical marker for Low Dutch Station; the primary families represented by the old tombstones are Brown, Forman, Galt, Lawrence, & Pope, along with single stones each for Anderson & Hobbs, and two infants of the Nicholas family. There is no connection between Low Dutch Station or its settlers and the nearby road known as Dutchmans Lane in St. Matthews. The aforementioned Dutchmans Lane was originally named Deutschman's Lane, taking its name from the fact that it was the access road from Taylorsville Road to the farm owned and operated by Louis J. Hollenbach Sr., a prominent German- American businessman in early 20th-century Louisville. Anti-German sentiment in Louisville during World War I prompted the shortening of the name from Deutschman (lit. \\"German man\\") to Dutchman. The bronze plaque historical marker for Low Dutch Station is located on the south side of Kresge Way, about 200 ft. east/northeast of the traffic light intersection where Browns Lane & Baptist Hospital East Emergency Entrance crosses Kresge Way. It could also be described as being 200 ft. east of the northwest corner of Browns Park, and the marker actually is at the edge of Browns Park, next to the road and sidewalk right-of-way. This marker and its post had been missing for some time, and has since been replaced with a new marker with a slightly different wording, counting it as one of \\"seven\\" pioneer forts along Beargrass Creek instead of the previously-worded \\"six\\". The new marker also eliminated references to \\"Indians\\" and the Dutch settlers moving to Henry and Shelby Counties and buying land there from Squire Boone. The text of the new marker reads as follows: In 1780 Hendrick Banta led a large group of Dutch settlers down the Ohio River to the Falls of the Ohio from Pennsylvania. They rented land from John Floyd and built Low Dutch (New Holland) Station, one of seven forts on Beargrass Creek. In 1810, leading agriculturalist James Brown of Maryland, acquired the property.

In North America, its range spans from Vancouver Island to Baja California, Mexico. The Asiatic population appears to not be invasive but endemic, resulting from a divergence estimated between 0.8 and 1.2 Mya.  Description  Typically, this crab will have a brown/purple or black carapace with green stripes. Its carapace is square and can reach 4 to 5 cm in size. The claws are red/purple with a mottled and striped pattern on the upper surface, and whitish-grayish on the lower surface, while its legs are purple and green with a similar mottled appearance.  Behavior  It will spend over half of its time on land, but will purposely submerge to wet its gills but can sustain itself on land for up to ~70 hours. They enjoy hiding in small crevices within rock, but will emerge at night when there is less danger of predation. This opportunistic predator's diet consists of green algae, red algae, brown seaweed, diatoms, worms, mussels, small decaying organisms, limpets, snails, flies, hermit crabs, seaweed, isopods, and sometimes even each other when the lesser crab has just finished molting. They have preference to small mussels over larger mussels over seaweed. Although there will be aggressive intraspecies competition over food, they do not keep a standard territory to defend. Generally they are eaten by seagulls, octopi, rats, raccoons, and humans, but are vulnerable to other organisms especially during their juvenile stages. Hunting strategies will differ based on their habitat. On rocky shores they will hunt more often than they forage, and under the cover of night, whilst in intertidal pools they will focus more on herbivory even during daytime hours. Intraspecies conflicts occur more out of defense in close captivity out of water, whilst in water it occurs more out of aggression. Over time a social hierarchy for the species within its habitat will form.

Early life Avedis \\"Avo\\" Uvezian was born to a family of musicians. His mother was a singer, while his father was a composer and conductor for a symphony orchestra. His parents' experience with music allowed him to develop his talents as a young man. Career Uvezian joined a jazz trio called the Lebanon Boys. They received a contract to perform at a hotel in Baghdad where they stayed for one year. After this, they signed a contract to perform at a hotel in Iran. While there, Avo received an invitation from Shah Reza Pahlavi to perform at his palace. In an interview with Cigar Aficionado, Avo described this point in his career: > \\"I spoke Farsi (referring to Persian), so it sort of broke the ice with the > Shah. I remember they were trying to dance the jitterbug and I said, 'You > don't know how to dance that right. Let me show you.' We were invited back > for two or three more events and finally, I became the Shah's pianist. The > hotel didn't care since the Shah owned it. After a year of performing in Iran, the Shah arranged for Avo to travel to the United States of America in 1947. While living in New York, Avo played for multiple bands while studying classical piano and composition at the Juilliard School. Uvezian was drafted during the Korean War and sent to Fort Dix in New Jersey where he was put through infantry training. After impressing his officers with his musical talents, Uvezian was taken out of the Infantry and put into band training. When he arrived in Korea, the band would play at an Officers Club where they got paid twenty dollars a night. Uvezian was honorably discharged in 1952. After being discharged, Uvezian spent the next few years working with his father-in-law designing jewelry. This eventually brought him to Puerto Rico where he was paid to perform at the Palmas Del Mar resort. Songwriting Uvezian claimed to have written the music for Frank Sinatra's song Strangers in the Night, even though the song is credited to Bert Kaempfert. When he was living in New York, a friend who knew Frank Sintatra set up a meeting to discuss one of his melodies. Somebody else had lyrics to it under the name \\"Broken Guitar\\". While Sinatra liked the melody, he asked for the lyrics to be altered. Sinatra recorded the song in 1966. However, before Sinatra heard the music, Uvezian had sent it to Kaempfert, for it to be published in Germany. While he is not officially credited for the song, Uvezian stated that Kaempfert himself had given him credit for its creation, including in a written letter. Cigars In 1983, when Avo's daughter Karyn was born, he went to Switzerland for her christening. Avo had a Cuban cigar after the meal and was not happy with the price. His friend mentioned that they should make their own. Uvezian traveled to the Dominican Republic, where he searched for two years for a satisfactory production facility. Avo finally met Hendrik Kelner, and after smoking samples, Avo offered Kelner twenty-five percent more than he had originally offered. His presumption was that paying Kelner more would ensure that Avo cigars would receive the best tobacco. Michael Roux advised Avo to use attractive packaging. In the first year, 120,000 Avo cigars were sold. By the third year, Avo sold over 750,000 cigars. In 1995, Davidoff paid Avo Uvezian an estimated $10 million for the rights to distribute his cigars. In 1996, more than two million Avo cigars were sold. Personal life Avo met his wife, Marie Sahakian, while performing at a New York resort in the Catskill Mountains in 1951. They had three children: Jeffrey, Robert, and Ronny. Following a divorce and a move to Puerto Rico, Avo met and married his second wife. They had a daughter together: Karyn. On April 27th 2020, Ronny, the youngest of Avo's sons, passed away suddenly.

The activities benefit several specified areas of use: Maritime security, oil spill prevention, marine resources management, climate change, seasonal forecasting, coastal activities, ice sheet surveys, water quality and pollution. The series of MyOcean projects ended in 2015, and their services are now continued by the Copernicus Programme.http://www.mercator-ocean.fr/eng/mercator_ocean/programmes- copernicus Objectives MyOcean's objective is to set up (definition, design, development and validation) an integrated pan-European capability for ocean monitoring and forecasting, using nationally available skills and resources. Although the budgetary frame of the project is labelled \\"Research\\", the priority is not to conduct further scientific research in the field of operational oceanography, even if this aspect is also taken into account. It is more a question of developing a System of Systems (in the industrial sense), according to the European quality standards, and to achieve operational qualification and eventually qualification of Service. Context The first MyOcean project started on 1 January 2009, scheduled to last for 39 months.GMES on MyOcean It is a follow-up to the MERSEA project (FP6: system implementation phase: 2004-2008), and also integrates some service lines developed as part of ESA's GSE (GMES Service Elements) projects, particularly Marcoast and PolarView. The follow up project MyOcean2 runs from April 2012 to September 2014 to ensure a controlled continuation and extension of the services and systems already implemented. Figures MyOcean is a consortium of 60 partners in 28 countries (the 22 states of the EU-27 that have a sea coastline, plus Norway, Russia, Ukraine, Morocco, Israel and Canada). Two European bodies (JRC and ECMWF) are also partners of 'MyOcean'. The (European Environment Agency) and the (European Maritime Safety Agency) are represented on the Board. The total budget was ‚Ç¨55M, of which ‚Ç¨33.8M comes from a European Commission subsidy (representing 61% of the total budget), over 36 months. This budget essentially corresponded to staff costs (83.5%), with the second largest item being mission expenses (7.3% of the total budget). Management costs (and external communication costs) represented 4.1% of the total budget. Equipment fees represented 3%. The total workload corresponded to the equivalent of 190 full-time employees, but in practical terms, there were more than 350 people involved in the project. The total budget og MyOcean2 was ‚Ç¨41M. Organisation The project is coordinated between the executive level (the Executive Committee) and the strategic level (the Board). The role of the 'Governing Body' is to take high-level decisions that affect the project at a strategic level, the major themes, the budget or the make-up of the consortium. On the 'Board' the following are represented:  Senior experts representing the main parties (INGV, Met Office, NERSC, DMI, Ifremer, CLS and Mercator Ocean)  The Chairmen of the Advisory Bodies (Core User Group and Scientific Advisory Committee)  Representatives of the European Stakeholders (EEA, EMSA, etc.) The Board and the Governing Body are chaired by Pierre Bahurel.  TAC (Thematic Assembly Centres) Production Centres  Their role is to collect the measurements or observations, whether satellite or in situ, and to calibrate, validate, edit, archive and distribute them. There are 5 TACs (WP Leader shown in brackets): * Sea Level TAC (CLS) * Ocean Color TAC (CNR) * Sea Surface Temperature TAC (Met Office) * Sea Ice and Wind TAC (MET Norway) * In Situ TAC (Ifremer), see CORA dataset global temperature and salinity product TAC involved into MyOcean project are organized into 7 regions, each region is linked to the corresponding area defined into SeaDataNet project in order to improve efforts on data management and exchange of datasets.  MFC (Monitoring & Forecasting Centres) Production Centres  They correspond to the 6 European 'basins', plus the Global Ocean.

She survived both wars and was returned to civilian service after each war.  Constructed in Ohio  Taganak (AG-45) was built in 1917 as War Shell at Toledo, Ohio, by the Toledo Shipbuilding Company. Acquired by the United States Shipping Board and delivered to the United States Navy for use as a mine carrier, the ship was renamed Lake Shore, commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 11 January 1918, and assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS).  World War I service as Lake Shore  Lake Shore was refitted at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, armed with one 5-inch gun and one six-pounder, manned with a complement of 64, and got underway for Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 7 February. The ship loaded a cargo of coal there and sailed for Boston, Massachusetts, arriving on the 17th. After discharging her cargo, Lake Shore returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on the 27th. She then loaded coal and mines for the North Sea barrage, sailed for Scotland on 7 March, and arrived at Lamlash on the 29th. The steamer returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 May and sailed on the 18th for Boston where she received an extensive overhaul. On 17 June, she proceeded, via New York City, to Norfolk where she loaded mines and general cargo. Her convoy sailed on 27 June for Scotland and reached Corpach on 15 July. Lake Shore returned to Norfolk on 18 August. She made two more trips from Hampton Roads to Europe‚Äîone back to the British Isles and one to France‚Äîbefore returning home on 6 February 1919. She was decommissioned on 5 March 1919 and returned to the Shipping Board the next day. Post-war decommissioning In 1923, Lake Shore was sold to the E. K. Wood Lumber Company, Inc., of San Francisco, California, and renamed Olympic. The steamer was operated by the lumber company along the Pacific coast until it was withdrawn from service in 1940.  World War II service as Taganak  Early in World War II, to relieve its acute shortage of cargo ships, the Navy reacquired Olympic on 23 May 1942. Following repairs, alterations, and refitting at Mare Island, the ship was commissioned as Taganak (AG-45) on 23 July 1942, Lt. Comdr. 0. H. Pitts, USNR, in command. Taganak, formally purchased on 28 September 1942, sailed for the South Pacific, via Pearl Harbor, in late October. Upon her arrival at Noum√©a, New Caledonia, she was sent to New Zealand to return with a load of lumber. The ship then shuttled cargo between New Zealand, New Caledonia, New Hebrides, and the Solomon Islands for the next year. Attacked by a Japanese submarine On 19 August 1943, Taganak was a few hours out of Noum√©a en route to Espiritu Santo with a cargo of ammunition when she was attacked by a Japanese submarine. attacked the enemy with depth charges and forced it to the surface. American dive bombers of Scouting Squadron VS-57 came to the assistance of the New Zealand corvette and aided in the kill of the . Rescue efforts succeeded in saving a few survivors. On 26 October, Taganak stood out of Tutuila, Samoa, and headed for the United States laden with copra. The ship arrived at San Pedro, California, on 19 November; discharged her cargo, and moved to Oakland, California, for an overhaul. On 11 February 1944, Taganak sailed for the South Pacific to resume shuttling inter-island cargo. She put into Auckland, New Zealand, on 6 February 1945 for repairs and then plied the waters of the South Pacific Ocean carrying cargo until after hostilities with Japan ended. The old steamer departed Tutuila on 30 September and headed for the United States. Post-war decommissioning  She arrived at San Francisco on 26 October 1945; was decommissioned at Vallejo, California, on 25 March 1946; was struck from the Navy List on 12 April; and was sold on 15 November 1946 to the Pillsbury and Martignoni Co., San Francisco, for scrap.

The Durga idol has two hands (dwibhuja), spearing the chest of Mahishasura with one hand and pulling his tail with the other. One of her feet is on a lion, and the other is on Mahishasura's chest. Mahishasura is depicted as a water buffalo. The idol's crown features Ganesha, a crescent moon and a lingam. The temple covers a large area, and has several shrines to Shiva and other deities. According to the Skanda Purana it cleanses pilgrims, and it is called the Viraja or the Biraja kshetra. Jajpur is believed to have about one crore of Shiva lingams. In Tantra Virajaa devi Another view of the temple The Brahmayamala Tantra has a hymn, \\"Aadya Stotra\\", dedicated to Shakti. In the hymn, Vimala is the goddess of Puri and Viraja (Girija) is the goddess worshiped in the Utkala Kingdom, which became Odisha. According to the Tantra Chudamani, Sati's navel fell in the Utkala Kingdom, also known as \\"Viraja kshetra\\". Adi Shankara, in his Ashtadasha Shakti Peetha Stuti describes the goddess as Girija. In Tantra literature, the Oddiyana Peetha (Devnagari:‡§ì‡§°‡§º‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§£ ‡§™‡•Ä‡§†) is located in eastern India near the Vaitarani River (an Oddiyana is an ornament worn by a woman around her navel).  Sree Bagalamukhi Deity There is a separate shrine for Sree Bagalamukhi Devi, which is right of Maa Biraja. One can find very few temples for this Roopa of Dasamahavidya  Nabhi Gaya Pitapuram holds the Pada Gaya, the Siro Gaya is found in Bihar, the Nabhi Gaya is found here in the form of a well. Pitru Pooja (Pinda Dhaan, Tharpanam, Thithi) are performed here. The temple itself arranges the priests and the pooja items. Rituals and festivals The primary ritual in the temple is Sharadiya Durga Puja, which begins on the night of Krishna Paksha Ashtami. This falls before Mahalaya, and ends on Ashwin Shukla Paksha Navami. The puja, known as Shodasha Dinatatmika Puja, lasts for 16 days. The ratha (chariot festival) is known as Simhadhwaja, and its flag bears a lion. During the lunar transition from Shukla Ashtami to Shukla Navami an animal sacrifice, Bali Daanam, is performed. Navratri is celebrated as Aparajita Puja. Other festivals include Nakshatra, Shravana, Prathamastami, Pana Sankranti, Raja Parva and Navanna. Devi is worshiped daily in accordance with Tantra and Agama traditions as Mahishasuramardini by the Brahmins of Jajpur. Transportation The nearest railway station is Cuttack and Jajpur Keonjhar Road. From there regular buses can be availed to Jajpur town. Mostly private buses run regularly in Orissa. Autos connect Cuttack railway station to Barabati bus stand, which is hardly 3 km away. The bus from Cuttack to Jajapur town takes 2 to 2 1/2 hours. From Jajpur road to Jajpur town travelling time by road will be more than one hour. Also buses are available from Bhubaneswar. Buses which have express written on the buses are quicker than local buses. Accommodation A couple of lodges are next to the temple and another is being constructed.

Today he is considered as one of the most important Danish composers of the early 1900s (together with the more famous Carl Nielsen). Life Nielsen was born in N√∏rre Tvede, Denmark. Although his family lacked any musicians, Ludolf took to music at a very young age. After a few years of violin lessons from local fiddlers, at eight he was playing at local festivals and other country occasions. In his mid-teens, he moved to Copenhagen, which exposed him to a much broader musical milieu. At 19, he won a scholarship to the Danish Royal Academy of Music. There, he studied violin, piano, and music theory. His composing talents were apparently self-developed. When about 20, Nielsen started composing, at the same time as Tivoli Orchestra hired him as a violinist. Some of his works were performed in 1899, but his first major success was with the symphonic poem Regnar Lodbrog, which gained him an additional scholarship that gave him the opportunity to spend time in the musically rich city of Leipzig, where he composed a few string quartets and had them published. He returned to Copenhagen and became conductor of the Tivoli Orchestra. In 1902, he composed his First Symphony, and the tone poem From the Mountains between 1903 and 1905. Just after his marriage in 1907, Nielsen composed a Romance for Violin (1908) and his Second Symphony (1907 ‚Äì 1909). Like many other artists, World War I had a very profound effect on Nielsen; He wrote little until 1914, which saw his Third Symphony. After the War, he became a private music teacher and eventually returned to composing. The two most important works from this period are his ballet Lackschmi (1922) and the orchestral suite Skovvandring (Forest Journey), along with almost 100 Lieder. Between 1926 and 1939, Ludolf worked as a programmer for the Danish National Radio Corporation and, with the exception of a few radio plays, he ceased composing. On October 16, 1939, at the age of 63, Nielsen died in Copenhagen. References External links Jens Cornelius: Ludolf Nielsen. Danske komponister, 2.

(This source was used for the whole article unless noted otherwise.) Other subspecies of raccoon living on islands, like that of the common raccoon (Procyon lotor) native to the Florida Keys, are generally not included under this term, since it was established at a time when all five (or six) \\"island raccoons\\" were considered distinct species. The five (or six) populations are: * Bahamian raccoon (Procyon lotor maynardi): subspecies of the common raccoon endemic on New Providence Island in the Bahamas * Barbados raccoon (Procyon lotor gloveralleni): extinct subspecies of the common raccoon endemic on Barbados until 1964 * Cozumel raccoon (Procyon pygmaeus): species endemic on Cozumel * Guadeloupe raccoon (Procyon lotor minor): subspecies of the common raccoon endemic on the two main islands Basse-Terre Island and Grande-Terre of Guadeloupe, which is assumed to be consubspecific (of the same subspecies) with the Bahamian raccoon * Tres Marias raccoon (Procyon lotor insularis): subspecies of the common raccoon endemic on the two main islands Mar√≠a Madre and Mar√≠a Magdalena of the Islas Mar√≠as, which is probably extinct on Mar√≠a Magdalena (this population is sometimes considered to be a separate subspecies (Procyon lotor vicinus))  Classification  After studies of their morphological and genetic traits in 1999, 2003 and 2005, only the Cozumel raccoon is still considered a distinct species, while the others were classified as subspecies of the common raccoon in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005. It is assumed that the four (or five) other island forms were introduced to their respective islands just a few centuries ago, probably by humans. The Guadeloupe raccoon is even considered of the same species as the similar Bahamian raccoon. Its former scientific name Procyon (lotor) minor is listed as a synonym for Procyon lotor maynardi.  Description  Apart from the comparatively large Tres Marias raccoon, all island raccoons are smaller than an average-sized common raccoon, making them examples of insular dwarfism. With a weight between 3 and 4 kg (6.6‚Äì8.8 lbs), the Cozumel raccoon is the smallest type of raccoon, except for Procyon lotor auspicatus endemic on Key Vaca in the Florida Keys. While a short and delicate skull is all in common except for the Tres Marias raccoon, the noticeable small teeth of the Cozumel raccoon suggest that it was separated from the mainland form long ago. The coat color of all island raccoons is gray or dark gray and on the underparts only few guard hairs cover the light brown ground hairs.  Conservation  The last sighting of the Barbados raccoon occurred in 1964, when one specimen was killed by a car on a road near Bathsheba. All four extant populations were classified as endangered by the IUCN in 1996, since less than 2,500 mature individuals were living in the wild and the population numbers continue to decline. Katherine W. McFadden gives an estimated number of fewer than 194 mature individuals of the Cozumel raccoons in her dissertation and argues that it should be even classified as critically endangered. (Dissertation at the Columbia University) Apart from the fact that the Guadeloupe raccoon has been chosen as an emblematic species for Guadeloupe National Park, no conservation efforts have been made to protect these populations from extinction. Habitat destruction and hunting are the biggest threats to their survival. Considering their small ranges, they were most likely never numerous. While Kristofer M. Helgen and Don E. Wilson, who have done the most recent research about island raccoons, are of the opinion that the Cozumel raccoon should be considered a high conservation priority, the other three subspecies may themselves pose a threat to the insular ecosystem as invasive species.

They released one eponymous studio album under RCA Records before being dropped from the label and ultimately disbanding in 2003. Band history Collectively, the band members all met in 1993 while Kinna, Krass and Matthews were living in Saugeen-Maitland Hall at the University of Western Ontario and Cohen was completing the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College. Among Cohen's classmates at the time was Greg Below, who would later go on to create Distort Entertainment. While Headstrong initially began in the late 1990s under the name bomb32 in London, Ontario, the group was formed of two long-standing pairings. Cohen and Krass had grown up friends in the Niagara Region, writing and performing under various incarnations since 1987, the two were greatly inspired by Living Colour, Guns N' Roses, GWAR, and much of the Classic Rock and Modern Punk era at the time. Kinna and Matthews had a slightly shorter, but similar relationship living in Toronto and attending the same summer-camp, they drew their inspiration from a like, but wider range of sources. Comparable to acts such as 311, Stone Temple Pilots, Rage Against the Machine and Helmet, they used the popularity of Farmclub to promote their music. The strength of their first single, \\"All of the Above,\\" earned Headstrong over a million votes from fans of the television show's site. They became Farmclub's first international guest and were granted a performance at LA's Farmclub stage in the summer of 2000. While there, they shared the stage with the likes of Kid Rock and Eminem and caught the attention of David Bendeth, senior vice- president of A&R;, who signed them afterwards.Headstrong Bio TheGauntlet.com. Retrieved on August 9, 2008. Headstrong then made their live American debut at the CMJ Music Marathon on October 12 at Don Hills, New York City. Also a key advocate of the band at RCA, was Bill Burrs, now Senior Sony-BMG Vice- President Promotions. The band's relationship with David could be described as frictional, as the label was in a constant state of interference with the band's ideals, perhaps rooted in their being Canadian with an American label partner in a notorious marketplace; but they could not deny that Bendeth had a great deal of influence in their improvement as players. The label itself was in a period of instability brought on by the creative destruction digitization would bring to the North American music industry. Headstrong could be remarked as one of the last acts to enter the analog market place, as the RIAA was beginning to align legislative forces against piracy in the form of Napster roughly at the time of their signing, certainly it was the backdrop to their courtship with the label. Headstrong did not 'win' Farmclub, nor were they signed on directly on the heels of the performance. Prior to their arrival to the taping, it was known that the band was on the radar of many in the Canadian and US industry before this performance as they were managed in part by Andy Martin of Deep South Entertainment in Raleigh, North Carolina. Thanks to their booking agents S.L. Feldman & Associates, Headstrong then embarked on a Canadian tour with fellow Canadians Flybanger starting in November 2001.Bliss, Karen T.O. rockers make U.S. debut JAM! Music (October/November 2001) Retrieved on August 9, 2008. The group also found fast friends in Breach of Trust, The Salads, appearing together on many occasions throughout Southern Ontario, making Zaphod's Memorable Shows in Ottawa Ontario, November 30, 2001. On February 19, 2002, they released their self-titled debut under RCA. Headstrong managed to find success with its single \\"Adriana,\\" which reached No. 15 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and had a music video. However, problems began erupting within the following months, as J Records and existing RCA staff were consolidated through directive of parent company, BMG. In late July, Headstrong was pulled from touring with Tommy Lee in a decision reportedly made by RCA to end the band's tour support. By this time, Headstrong had also been believed to be writing and demoing new material which would possibly be showcased in their forthcoming fall concerts. However, in August, a mere six months after their debut album's release, Headstrong was dropped by RCA.HEADSTRONG Dropped By RCA RECORDS RoadRunnerRecords.com (August 12, 2002). The band's last performance US was alongside Atlanta, GA rock band Injected on the steps of the Capital Building at the Taste of Madision Festival in Madison, WI. The following year, in late April, Headstrong decided to split up, citing disillusionment with the record label as one reason. As one would expect, there is little contact between the band and their industry counterparts from the time, but the members maintain a unanimous fondness for Burrs and an almost Stockholm-ish opinion of Bendeth. Prior to their exit from the music industry the band left behind several tracks for their fans, which they produced from the remains of their funds, also with longtime friend Producer, and at the time only advocate, Dan Brodbeck.

The treatment is applied by a radiologist assisted by a radiographer. Contrast medium, a local anaesthetic and cortisone are injected into the joint. Then up to 40ml of sterile saline solution are injected, using X-ray as guidance, to stretch the joint capsule. Risk of complications is low. Whether the treatment is successful is known after a couple of weeks. The procedure is performed under imaging guidance, using either fluoroscopy, ultrasound or Computed Tomography (CT). Hydrodilatation is felt to provide benefit via two mechanisms: manual stretching of the capsule and thus disruption of adhesions which are characteristic of adhesive capsulitis, and; the introduction of cortisone provides a potent anti-inflammatory effect and thus prevents further adhesion recurrence. Research in 2008 has questioned the benefit of hydrodilatation as giving no statistical benefit over injecting cortisone alone.

Piper Sr. (August 31, 1916 - August 3, 2008), also known as Big Eagle or Chief Big Eagle, was the Hereditary Chief of the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation of Connecticut from 1959 until 2008. Early life Piper served in the United States military during World War II and took part in the American landings during the North African Campaign. Hereditary chief Piper was named hereditary chief of the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation by his mother, Chieftess Rising Star, in 1959. Piper later took up residence in the Paugussett's quarter-acre reservation in Trumbull, Connecticut. Piper travelled extensively as a representative of the Golden Hill Paugussett and other Native American groups to campaign for the rights of ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples. He visited Moscow as part of a delegation of Native Americans. Piper also wrote for the De Kiva Journal as an eastern North American Indian foreign correspondent. The De Kivas advocates for Native American rights before the International Human Rights Council in Geneva and is based in Belgium and Netherlands. Piper's son, Kenneth, who is also known as Moonface Bear, was involved on a ten-week standoff between Connecticut State Police and the Colchester, Connecticut, branch of the Golden Hill Paugussett. The standoff stemmed from the illegal sale of untaxed cigarettes on the Colchester portion of the reservation. Kenneth Piper died in 1996. Piper served on the boards of several Connecticut organizations which advocated for Native American and minority rights. He also served as a \\"spiritual liaison\\" for Native Americans in prison. He was named Chief of the Century by the Florida chapter of the White Buffalo Society \\"for his work in furthering Native American causes in Connecticut, across the country, and abroad.\\" > It is a sacred obligation, says the Golden Hill Paugussett Chief, Big Eagle. > Indian people must keep their languages alive. If the language is not > spoken, it must be made to live again. Piper was the subject of the book Quarter Acre of Heartache which is attributed to Claude Clayton Smith but is primarily written by Piper. The book details the history of the Paugussett Indian Nation and the fight to save what was left of their tribal land- a quarter acre property in suburban Trumbull, Connecticut. Death Aurelius H. Piper Sr. died of natural causes on August 3, 2008, at the Golden Hill reservation in Trumbull, Connecticut, at the age of 92. He was survived by his wife, Marsha Conte Piper; five children; several stepchildren, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. A spokesman for the Golden Hill Paugussett confirmed that Piper's son, Aurelius H. Piper Jr., who is also known as Chief Quiet Hawk, will assume the title of hereditary chief from his father. Background Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation is a small tribe with tiny Connecticut reservations in both Trumbull and Colchester. It has been an officially recognized tribe by the state of Connecticut for approximately 300 years. However, the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs has repeatedly refused the tribe's request for federal recognition. The last refusal came in 2004. The Golden Hill Paugusett had originally claimed more than of land during its fight for federal recognition. The tribe's land claim included an area stretching from Middletown to Wilton and from Greenwich, Connecticut through lower portions of New York's Westchester County, which set off legal challenges against the tribe's recognition attempts. The Golden Hill Paugussett has dropped these far reaching land claims, but could revive them if federal recognition is eventually achieved.

Burden's horseshoe machine, invented in 1835, was capable of making 60 horseshoes a minute. His rotary concentric squeezer, a machine for working wrought iron, was adopted by iron industries worldwide. His hook- headed spike machine helped fuel the rapid expansion of railroads in the U.S. The Burden Iron Works is now an historical site and museum. Early life Henry Burden was born in Dunblane, Perthshire, Scotland, the son of Peter Burden (1752‚Äì1829) and Elizabeth Abercrombie (1756‚Äì1837). His father was a sheep farmer. He studied engineering at the University of Edinburgh, and returned to the farm making implements and a water wheel to power them.Rethford, Wayne. \\"Manufacturer. Inventor. Builder. Innovator and Philanthropist\\", Illinois Saint Andrew Society He emigrated in 1819 with a letter of introduction to Stephen van Rensselaer, courtesy of the American Minister in London. Entrance to the old office Career Burden started at the Townsend & Corning Foundry, manufacturers of cast iron plows and other agricultural implements, located in Albany‚Äôs south end - near today‚Äôs Port of Albany. The next year, he invented an improved plow, which took first premium at three county fairs, and a cultivator, which was said to have been the first to be put into practical operation in the country. He also made mechanical improvements on threshing machines and grist mills. He moved to Troy in 1822, and worked as superintendent of the Troy Iron and Nail Factory. The factory was located on north side of the Wynantskill Creek in South Troy, about a half-mile northeast of today‚Äôs Troy-Menands bridge. Burden's inventions, which automated work that was previously done by hand, made the factory extremely profitable. Burden soon became the sole owner of the factory and renamed it H. Burden and Sons. The Burden Iron Works, as it came to be known, produced a variety of iron-based products.Schreck, Tom. \\"Making History: Industry in Troy\\", Albany Business Review, May 7, 2001 Innovator He experimented not only in the manufacture of items like horseshoes and spikes, but also in the production of machines to make them. In May 1825, he secured a patent for a machine to make spikes, which up until then were made by hand. The Burden Iron Works produced the first ship spikes and the first horseshoes made by machinery in the world. In 1835 he designed the \\"Horseshoe Machine\\" that could produce 60 shoes a minute. Burden became the chief horseshoe producer for the Union Army. Burden became involved in supplying the iron needed by the nation's rapidly expanding railroads. In 1840 he obtained a patent for the first hook-headed spike. He made ten tons of these for the Long Island Railroad in 1836. His suit against Corning and Winslow for patent infringement lasted from 1842 to 1867, when the patent was upheld.Proudfit, Margaret Burden. Henry Burden, His Life, Troy, New York 1904 Also in 1840 he obtained a patent for the \\"rotary squeezer\\", which came to be used in all the leading iron manufactories in both America and Europe. Burden held twelve patents in total. He was also among the first to suggest the use of plates for iron-clad seagoing vessels, and sent specimen plates of his own manufacture to Glasgow for testing. The company forged the hull plates for the , the Navy's first iron-clad battleship, which engaged the Confederacy's Merrimac in 1862 in the first battle of its kind. Burden Iron Works Burden replaced the small wooden mill with a large millworks. The river adjacent to the works was shallow and full of bars, and the land along the river was low and frequently flooded. At great expense, Burden had the grounds filled in, and the river dredged, so that the company's docks were accessible to large vessels. A network of railroad tracks wove through the property to move train loads of sand, iron ore from the Lake Champlain region, and limestone from the downriver city of Hudson. The firm had its own locomotive. Steam derricks were used to unload coal from the dock and move it to the coal heap, three hundred feet distant, a ton at a time. Waterwheel at Burden Iron Works, Troy, New York; note man in foreground He originated a system of reservoirs along the Wynantskill Creek to hold the water in reserve and increase the water-supply to power the mills. In order to find the necessary power to run his foundry, in 1851 Burden designed and constructed a 60-foot wheel that could generate 500 horsepower. The poet Louis Gaylor Clark, characterized the huge whell as the \\"Niagara of Water-Wheels,\\".Sylvester, Nathaniel Bartlett. History of Rensselaer Co., New York First published 1880. (see excerpt here) The wheel's design caught the eye of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute student George W.G. Ferris, who in 1893 unveiled his own invention, the Ferris Wheel, similar to Henry Burden's water wheel. Some idea of the magnitude of the ironworks at Troy is suggested by the fact that in 1864 the cost of iron, coal, and other materials was over $1,500,000. Burden Iron Works used 90,000 tons of coal annually. In 1880 the ironworks employed 1,400 men. The ironworks produced 600,000 kegs of horseshoes and 42,000 tons of iron, exclusive of pig, annually. Their yearly sales of horseshoes average about $2,000,000. Burden himself is described as a large man with deep-set eyes and a cheerful demeanor.\\"Henry Burden\\", Phrenological Journal, April. 1871 An accomplished mechanic, he could make a better piece of work than any man in his shops; and could deal a heavier blow with a sledge than any of his strikers at the forge. Upright himself, he was apt to assume the uprightness of others. The Henry Burden family papers are located at the William L. Clements Library, University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. They contain correspondence from 1816 to 1853 between Burden, his business acquaintances, and his sons pertaining to his numerous industrial inventions and to the business affairs of the Troy Iron and Nail Factory in Troy, New York. The collection documents the iron industry in the mid-19th century, as well as the market for Burden's numerous industrial inventions.Manuscripts Division, William L. Clements Library, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan Steamboats Burden had a great interest in navigation. As early as 1825 he laid before the Troy Steamboat Association certain original plans whereby the construction of steamboats for inland navigation could be greatly improved, and which some years later were adopted in the building of the steamer 'Hendrick Hudson.' In 1833, he created the steamboat \\"Helen,\\" named in honor of his wife. Its deck rested upon two cigar-shaped hulls, three hundred feet in length, with a paddle-wheel amidships thirty feet in diameter. The boat was lost on its first trial due to pilot mismanagement, and Burden turned his attention to ocean navigation. Besides increasing the length of the boats, he suggested, for the convenience and accommodation of passengers, the erection of sleeping-berth- rooms on the upper decks, being a decided change from the holds of vessels, where they had previously been placed. His views on navigation being known, some gentlemen of Glasgow issued, with his permission, a prospectus of \\"Burden's Atlantic Steam-Ferry Company.\\" Although the company never materialized his ideas were subsequently imitated by Samuel Cunard of the Cunard Line. Woodside Presbyterian Church Postcard depicting the church. Woodside Presbyterian Church was built in 1869 by Henry Burden on land owned by Erastus Corning, of Corning's Albany Iron Works as a memorial to the wife of Henry Burden, who died in 1860. She had expressed concern for the iron workers and their families, who had to walk miles in inclement weather to churches in downtown Troy and wished for a church closer to the Iron Works. An inscription on the church wall reads, \\"Woodside Memorial Church, dedicated to the service of the Triune God, has been erected to the memory of Helen Burden by her husband, Henry Burden, in accordance with her long-cherished and earnest desire, 1869.\\" Erected at a cost of $75,000, it was the third most expensive church edifice in Troy at the time. The site is adjacent to Wynantskill Creek. Personal life On January 23, 1821, at Saint Gabriel Presbyterian Church in Montreal, Qu√©bec, Henry Burden wed Helen McOuat (1802‚Äì1860), whom he had known in Scotland. She was the daughter of James McOuat (1762‚Äì1837) and Margaret Bilsland (1770‚Äì1840). Her family immigrated to Canada and were based in Lachute, Qu√©bec, Canada at the time of her marriage to Henry.

Beit Zayit lies on the edge of the Jerusalem Forest and operates a public swimming pool. Nearby is the Ein Kerem dam, built to store winter flood waters. History A village named Beit Zayit is mentioned in the book of the Maccabees, but it is believed to have been further north, possibly at the site of the Palestinian Christian town of Bir Zeit, north of Ramallah. Beit Zayit was established on land that had belonged to the depopulated Palestinian village of 'Ayn Karim. The village was established in 1949 by Jewish immigrants from Egypt, Romania and Yugoslavia. The economy was based on fruit orchards, vegetables, poultry, and other farm products. With the expansion of the moshav in the late 1990s, including the purchase of land by newcomers and renovation of old homes, Beit Zayit became a trendy alternative to living in Jerusalem.

It was one of the operations that followed the Battle of Kursk. In the offensive, the Red Army pushed through the Wehrmacht lines after the Wehrmacht retreated after the Battle of Kursk. It represented a turning point on the Eastern Front. Prelude During the Battle of Kursk, German armored units south of the Kursk salient failed to penetrate the defences between the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts in the Belgorod sector on 8 July. The Red Army's Belgorod-Kharkov Strategic Counter-Offensive followed Operation Citadel and included as its objectives the immediate liberation of Belgorod and Kharkiv, assigned to the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts. On 23 July 1943, German forces of the XLVIII Panzercorps and LII Armeecorps returned to their old, well fortified positions, stretching to some 60 kilometres west of Tomarovka. Their combat strength had been reduced by as much as 50% following the Battle.Panzer Operations The Eastern Front Memoir of General Raus 1941‚Äì1945 bt Steven H Newton 2003 Page 212 Advance towards Hadiach (Gadac) and Mirgorod beyond.  The Battle  Early on 3 August 1943, after a heavy Artillery barrage which lasted hours and overwhelming Soviet air support, the Forces of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts from the Kursk-Belgorod highway began advancing on a wide front between Sumy and Vovchansk (175 km), crossed the Vorskla river and quickly penetrated the defences of the 332nd Infantry Division (north of Tomarovka) and 167th Infantry Division to a depth of 100 km between Tomarovka and Belgorod on the northern flank, and as far as Okhtyrka. West of Belgorod 6th Panzer Division deployed hurriedly and counter-attacked the penetration in the 167th Infantry Division area but was unable to halt the Soviet flood. Schwere Panzer-Abteilung 502 and 19th Panzer Division were also swept aside by the strength of the attack.Decision in the Ukraine Summer 1943 II SS & III Panzerkorps, George M Nipe Jr, JJ Fedorowicz Publishing Inc. 1996 pp 260‚Äì261 These divisions were good quality units and not badly understrength for this period of the war on the Eastern Front, but the enormous weight of Soviet firepower, mass of infantry and hundreds of tanks simply overran them. In Tomarovka German units threatened with encirclement retreated along a narrow corridor to Grayvoron. The shattered formations of LII Armeecorps began a harrowing fight through the Russians toward the southwest and their own lines, desperately searching for a gap in the quickly closing noose. All the while Soviet aircraft were descending upon the retreating columns, wreaking confusion and destruction. To counter the breakthrough at the boundary of his armies Manstein gathered his armour from all other areas. By 5 August 1943 the 4 divisions of the III Panzercorps were deploying north and west of Kharkiv to counterattack the eastern flank of the Russian armoured spearheads driving towards Bohodukhiv. At the same time 4th Panzerarmee's XXIV Panzercorps prepared to attack the western flank with Gro√üdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division. Manstein planned to use his panzer divisions to slice through the communication lines of the lead Soviet mobile units and destroy their momentum. The Russian armoured forces advanced so quickly to the south, that their rifle divisions were left behind, first due to a lack of enough transport, and secondly to deal with the task of reducing pockets of resistance in rear areas. This left them vulnerable to isolation and destruction by the superior German mobile forces. Despite deep penetrations, forces of the Voronezh Front had been frustrated along the banks of the Vorskla and Merla rivers by German armour operating in a \\"fire brigade\\" role which characterised later years. SS armoured units had isolated Soviet units which had penetrated too quickly, and this had halted the momentum of the assault. To relieve these units and prevent further German advances the 6th Guards, 47th and 40th armies launched an assault on the left flank of 4th Panzerarmee's XLVII Panzercorps . General Hoth was now faced with a difficult decision whether to cancel his planned assault to defeat the overextended Soviet armoured formations or to move his armour to relieve his left flank, he made the decision to act aggressively gambling that his assault would force the Soviets to move their forces to counter his threat. On 18 August XXIV Panzercorps began its assault toward Parchomovka from Okhtyrka for the moment and achieved quick success by early afternoon of the first day they had penetrated 20 kilometres cutting the communication lines of 27th Army and threatening to encircle the divisions southwest of Okhtyrka. On 20 August 1943 at 1830 hours elements of Gro√üdeutschland linked up with 'Totenkopf' at Parchomovka. The link-up resulted in the tenuous encirclement of several large soviet formations which were able to escape with heavy vehicle losses and casualties. Increased soviet assaults on the 4th Panzerarmee's left flank over the Psel River by 40th and 47th armies later forced Hoth to withdraw his 10th Panzergrenadier from the counter-attack and finally forced Gro√üdeutschland back to the defensive at Parchomovka.Decision in the Ukraine Summer 1943 II SS & III Panzerkorps, George M Nipe Jr, JJ Fedorowicz Publishing Inc. 1996 pp 316‚Äì324Stalingrad to Berlin - The German Defeat in the East by Earl F Ziemke by Dorset Press 1968 pp 150‚Äì158 On 26 August the Soviet Central Front resumed its offensive against Army Group Centre striking the 9th at Karachev and the 2nd German Armies at Sevsk and east of Klintsy securing a deep penetration. This eventually forced Kluge and Manstein to ask permission to withdraw to more secure defensive positions. Retreat to the Dnepr River was now inevitable the only question, would this happen at a time of their choosing or be a headlong flight. Aftermath The constant fighting never allowed Hitler to build up a reserve large enough to regain the upper hand in the east. Employing the peculiar rippling effect that marked its offensives, the Red Army, thwarted in one place, had shifted to others. For the first time in the war it had the full strategic initiative, and it grasped it jealously without regard for economy of effort, tactical sophistication, or the danger of overreaching itself.Stalingrad to Berlin - The German Defeat in the East by Earl F Ziemke by Dorset Press 1968 page 158 The failure of \\"Zitadel\\" doomed the Germans to the loss of operational initiative on the Eastern Front without any hope of regaining it, although Hitler seems to have been unaware or unwilling to recognizing this reality. The terrible losses in manpower that the Germans suffered in July and August were ultimately fatal and left the armies of Army Group South and Centre too weak to do anything but delay the inevitable. Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev marked the first time in the war that the Germans were not able to defeat a major Soviet offensive during the summer months and regain their lost ground and the strategic initiative.Decision in the Ukraine Summer 1943 II SS & III Panzerkorps, George M Nipe Jr, JJ Fedorowicz Publishing Inc. 1996 Page 330 Footnotes *Consisting of the 1st Guards Tank Army, 5th Guards Tank Army, 6th Guards Army, 5th Guards Army, 40th Army, 27th Army. *Both belonging to LII Army Corps. *The 19th Panzer Division had only 28 tanks, the 6th Panzer Division which was in reserve and about 7-8 kilometres behind the front had 50 tanks.

Often used as table olives, they are usually preserved in wine vinegar or olive oil. Outside the European Union, \\"Kalamata\\" is commonly used as the name of the variety and is legally and commonly used for such olives grown anywhere. However, within the EU (and other countries that ratified PDO agreements) the name is protected with PDO status, which means in the EU the name can only be used for olives (and olive oil) from the Messinia region of Greece. Olives of the same variety grown elsewhere are marketed as Kalamon olives in the EU and, sometimes, elsewhere. Description Kalamata olives are so-named because they were originally grown in Kalamata in Messinia and also in nearby Laconia, both located on the Peloponnese peninsula. They are now grown in many places around the world, including in the United States and Australia. They are almond-shaped, plump, dark purple olives from a tree distinguished from the common olive by the size of its leaves, which grow to twice the size of other olive varieties. The trees are intolerant of cold and are susceptible to Verticillium wilt but are resistant to olive knot and to the olive fruit fly. Kalamata olives, which cannot be harvested green, must be hand-picked in order to avoid bruising. They are classed as black olives.

Preparation There are two methods of preparing Kalamata olives, known as the long and short methods. The short method debitters the olives by packing them in water or weak brine, which is changed daily, for around a week. Once complete, they are then packed in brine and wine vinegar with a layer of olive oil and slices of lemon on top. The olives are often slit to decrease the processing time. The long method involves slitting the olives, placing them in strong brine for up to three months in order to debitter them. Levels of polyphenol remain in the olives after processing, giving them their slightly bitter taste.

The largest male they examined was in total length of which the tail was , the largest female with a tail of . The snout is rounded while the head is not too much wider than the neck. The body is moderately stout. Scalation usually includes 21 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody, although the keels on the outer scale rows may be missing; 145-175 ventral scales; and 34-44 paired subcaudal scales. Also there are usually 7 supralabial scales. The color pattern consists of a greenish brown, yellowish brown, or nut brown ground color, which is overlaid with four longitudinal stripes that are interrupted at intervals, sometimes curving and coalescing, and at other times forming an irregularly spotted or zigzag pattern. This pattern is clearly visible in young specimens, while older ones are dark or even uniformly black. A dark postocular stripe is present that more or less diffuses with the ground color above, but is clearly bordered below by a pale coloration of the lower temporal scales and posterior supralabial scales.

The film had the tag-line Tusen k√§rleksfulla l√∂gner av Hans Alfredson och Tage Danielsson (A thousand loving lies by Hans Alfredson and Tage Danielsson). At the 14th Guldbagge Awards the film won the award for Best Film. The film uses ten languages: Spanish, French, Swedish, German, Finnish, Italian, English, Russian, Norwegian and Latin. Most of these words are very simple (agua, water), sometimes meaning something different from what they seem (Don Jose's military rank, Hauptbahnhof, which means \\"central rail station\\" in German) and other times just being complete nonsense. Plot The film is very loosely based on Pablo Picasso's life, narrated by Toivo Pawlo, who introduces himself as Elsa Beskow. It opens with a quote by Picasso himself: \\"Art is a lie that leads us closer to the truth.\\" The story starts with Picasso's birth in M√°laga, Spain. His father, Don Jose (Hans Alfredson), is an artist and discovers early his son's talent when the young boy makes a sculpture of Don Jose with his food. When Pablo is old enough (and now portrayed by G√∂sta Ekman) his father takes him to Madrid, so that Pablo can study art. On their way, they encounter two robbers who try to hurt a beautiful girl named Dolores (Lena Olin). After a slapstick number in which Picasso defeats the two attackers, she gives him a bottle of paint, containing a djinn. With the paint from that bottle he signs all his paintings. At the academy of art Pablo's talent is praised and awarded. When he returns home with a portrait of his mother Dona Maria (Margaretha Krook), he is equally praised there. Unfortunately, their happiness is ruined when Don Jose suddenly dies - or so it seems. At the funeral it turns out he's actually still alive. Despite this, Dona Maria keeps ignoring him with the words: \\"Idioto, t√∫ es muerta\\" (= \\"You are dead, fool\\"). Pablo leaves for Paris, but has a hard time selling any of his paintings. One day his father comes to visit him, bringing the sad news that Dona Maria is dead. When Don Jose starts to eat an apple that Pablo used as a reference for his painting, Picasso starts to draw faster, still using the apple as reference. The result is the birth of cubism. This new style, however, is very hard to sell - until Pablo's father gets an idea from a fishing rod. He lowers the painting down from a window during a vernissage. The overall reaction is negative, with comments like \\"Scandal\\", \\"Merde\\", \\"Oh, mon dieu\\" and \\"piss\\". One of the guests however, finds the picture both charming and marvelous and declares that she wants to buy it. This lady is none other than the great writer Gertrude Stein (Bernard Cribbins), who is attending the vernissage with her companion Alice B. Toklas (Wilfrid Brambell). After this, Picasso becomes the center of the artworld of Paris. Along with names like Braque, Matisse, Fernand L√©ger, Pompidou, Entrec√¥te, Carl Larsson, Karl-Alfred, Loulou, Dodo, Jou-Jou, Clo-Clo, Margot, Frou Frou, Jenny Nystr√∂m, Hejsan-Tjosan, Corselet, Omelette and Rembrandt (most of these names are just nonsense and mean other things than you might suspect). The Paris artworld also included Hemingway, who enjoys knitting, Erik Satie, Guillaume Apollinaire, Henri Rousseau, Vincent van Gogh and no less than two Toulouse-Lautrec. Along with Mimi, a waitress who gave Puccini the inspiration to \\"Thy tiny hand is frozen\\", the reason for this being that she is carrying a wine cooler. After this introduction to the artworld of Paris, the narrator tells about a \\"normal\\" day in Picassos life. It ends with a visit from Mr. and Mrs. Guggenheim from New York City. Although the Swedish American multimillionaire Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim (Birgitta Andersson) doesn't understand Picasso's art, she knows that it is expensive, and therefore immortal. She becomes a pest and at whatever the cost she is determined to become a part of Picasso's art and world. When Picasso no longer seems to be able to escape the annoying American, his two friends Rousseau (Lennart Nyman) and Apollinaire (Per Oscarsson) invite him to Rousseau's hidden forest, where Apollinaire reads aloud some of his poems for his friends. This gives Picasso an idea. They will have a masquerade in Rousseaus honor. This masquerade has a lot of famous historic persons, most of them dressed as furniture. It all ends with Rousseau, while playing his violin, flying out the window and into the night of Paris. Now it's 1914 and Picasso and all of humanity is looking forward to a bright future full of liberty, equality and fraternity. This is all destroyed however with the coming of World War I and the headlines \\"KRASH! BOM! BANG!\\" In 1918, when the war is over, Pablo once again meets his father, who has invented a new shampoo that will regrow hair. It has another effect on Pablo however, who loses all of his hair and gives him his famous bald look. Shortly after this, Pablo gets the job to make the sets and clothes for the russian ballet. The ballet, premiering in London, is not a success however. Don Jose makes the dancers' food and all the performers end up passing gas. Picasso returns to Paris, where he meets Sirkka (Lena Nyman), a Finnish singer who sings a song that he becomes enchanted by. However, when it turns out that that song (which is essentially a recipe for making a kalakukko (the equivalent of the Russian rybnik or kurnik)) is the only one Sirkka‚Äôs got on her repertoire, Picasso soon gets sick of it and leaves for New York City with his father. In America there is a prohibition on art (a reference to the real Prohibition era of liquor). Pablo works underground and one day he is asked to deliver a set of pictures to a Mrs. X. It turns out that this mysterious woman is none other than Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim. She doesn't give up so easily, but Picasso manages to escape her flirting. When delivering art to the local gangster Big Mac Kahnweiler, Pablo, Don Jose and Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim are caught in a shootout between Big Mac and his rival Mr. Peperoni. The shootout is interrupted however by a police raid. A very foulmouthed cop accuses Pablo of being a murderer and states that art is a lethal poison. It all turns into an impromptu trial against Pablo with Ingrid Svensson- Guggenheim and the two gangs as the jury. Don Jose, acting as Pablo's lawyer tries to defend his son, stating that Picasso's work is not art, but childish graffiti. However, Pablo is still found guilty and is sentenced to death by the electric chair. The chair refuses to work however, and the electrician, a Norwegian named Grieg (Rolv Wesenlund), is sent in to fix it. It all backfires however and in the mess Pablo draws a door on the wall and escapes back to Europe. In Europe however, \\"the monsters\\" -- Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler and Francisco Franco‚Äîhave seized power. Don Jose joins the German army and later on becomes promoted to the rank of Hauptbahnhof (a German word meaning main train station) in the SS, in charge of Operation Ostrich, with the mission to find opposition men in hiding. During the war, Picasso uses his apartment to hide opposition members. When the war is over, Don Jose quickly changes into French clothes, stating \\"I like Ike!\\", waving the American flag and singing My Old Kentucky Home, charming the Americans in pretty much the same way he did with the Germans. After World War II Pablo settles down at the Riviera, where he once again meets the love of his youth, Dolores, and her granddaughter (who, like young Dolores, is played by Lena Olin). Inspired by them Picasso sends his doves (animated birds) out in a world plagued by the Cold War. After a while, Don Jose shows up again with his new wife, who turns out to be Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim. Picasso is trapped by his own fame, he has become an industry and his house is converted into a museum while he still lives in it. After drinking the last of the ink in the magic bottle Dolores gave him years ago, he falls asleep and dies. At the same moment all the signatures on Picasso's paintings disappear, it becomes The Great Picasso crash. But, as we find out, Picasso is not really dead. When everyone has left the room he gets up, waves goodbye to his paintings and fades into the wall.

In the same manner it would be funny to do a biography about a person you never met. Like Mozart, Jesus or Picasso. Despite the fact that this movie is set in Spain, London, Paris, the French Riviera and America most of the movie was shot in and around the Swedish town of Tomelilla. Many of the scenes are filmed at the same street. Using a glasspainting in front of the camera and changing a few things on the set, the filmmakers could turn the little street of Tomelilla into all the big cities shown in this film. All of Picasso's paintings for this movie were made by Per √Öhlin. After the film's premiere the paintings by Per √Öhlin were shown at a vernissage in Tomelilla with pricetags from 222 220 kronor and up. All except one, Elsa Melon, that only cost 40 kr, but it was listed as already sold. Per √Öhlin wanted the paintings to be destroyed after the vernissage so they wouldn't be spread as Per √Öhlin-paintings when they were only \\"Per √Öhlin-paintings that mimicked Picasso for a movie full of lies\\". According to the movie's commentary track by G√∂sta Ekman, some of the paintings were saved by the cast and crew who now keep them in their houses. Sirkka's song is actually a recipe for pastry of fish and bacon. Release The narration of this movie is the only thing that is dubbed into other languages, because of the multilingual dialogue. In all versions it is a man who introduces himself as a famous female. In Sweden the narrator introduces himself as \\"Elsa Beskow\\", in English it is Gertrude Stein, in Danish, Karen Blixen, in Norwegian, Margaretha Munthe and the French narrator introduces himself as Mistinguett. Years after the movie's release, when G√∂sta Ekman went to Budapest on vacation, he found that people looked at him in a very odd way. He eventually understood why when a local asked him if he were Picasso, to which G√∂sta replied, \\"If you mean that I played Picasso in a movie then, yeah, that's right.\\" He later found out that the film was a great success in Hungary, where it has been playing in a Budapest cinema every year since its release, and even had been turned into a stage play.

He was a controversial contender for the World Welterweight Boxing Championship in April 1904. Early life and career Aaron Lister Brown, the Dixie Kid, was born on December 23, 1883, in Fulton, Missouri. From 1900 to 1903, the Kid fought almost exclusively in southern California, primarily in Los Angeles and Oakland, most notably defeating contender Frank McConnell in a fourth-round knockout on December 30, 1902, and Mose LaFontise with a tenth-round knockout on July 10, 1903. McConnell was a world welterweight championship contender against Mysterious Billy Smith in New York on January 26, 1900. The mute Butte, Montana based boxer LaFontise had just fought the great Joe Walcott before meeting the Kid, and had twice defeated Fireman Jim Flynn, the only boxer to ever knock out Jack Dempsey. On May 21, 1903, the Kid defeated Al Neill in a twenty-round points decision in San Francisco. Neill was a welterweight contender who defeated Mysterious Billy Smith on a tenth round foul on January 23, 1902, and competed unsuccessfully for both the Middleweight and Welterweight championships of Australia in 1904-5. Professional career Attempt at the world welterweight championship against Joe Walcott, 1904 Barbados Joe Walcott On April 29, 1904, Kid challenged Barbados Joe Walcott for the latter's World Welterweight Championship title. The Kid was down in the tenth round for a count of six. In the one sided contest, Walcott appeared to have a clear advantage in all but the seventh round. By the eleventh round, the tiring Kid began to clinch. Walcott was winning the fight handily when the referee disqualified him with no evident explanation in the final seconds of the 20th round. \\"Duck Sullivan\\", the referee who made the strange call of foul, was a last minute replacement, and Walcott protested the choice before the bout began. Many in the crowd were shocked with the decision, and Walcott himself was immediately angered at referee Sullivan who made the call.\\"Decision Goes to Dixie Kid\\", San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco, California, pg. 8, 30 April 1984 The match was disregarded as a title bout when it was discovered, not surprisingly, that referee Sullivan had bet on Dixie Kid to win the match. Dixie Kid in his prime On September 28, 1909, he lost to \\"Colored\\" black heavyweight champion claimant Sam Langford in Boston, Massachusetts, when the Kid's handlers threw in the towel after the fifth round. Langford outweighed his opponent by at least twenty-five pounds. By most accounts, the \\"Kid\\" showed great cleverness in the bout eluding Langford's punches in the early rounds, and put up a skilled display of boxing in the close match. In the third round, the Kid nearly stopped Langford with a series of body blows, and short jabs to the face.\\"Sam Langford is Winner Over Dixie Kid\\", Reno Gazette, Reno, Nevada, pg. 6, 29 September 1909 As Langford gained his stride, the \\"Kid\\" went down once in the fifth round and again as the bell sounded, and could not return to box in the sixth when the towel was thrown.Langford outweighed the Kid by 25 pounds in \\"Langford Had a Really Hard Go\\", The Butte Daily Post, Butte, Montana, pg. 6, 4 October 1909The Kid down as the bell rang to the fifth in \\"Langford Makes Short Work of Dixie Kid\\", The Evening Statesman,Wala Wala, Washington, pg. 6, 29 September 1909 On November 1, 1909 he faced the impressive black boxer Jeff Clark and fought to an eight-round win, which he repeated on November 15. In their fight of November 1, the bout was close for the first six rounds, but the Kid took the advantage in the seventh and knocked Clark to the mat at the end of the eighth, with the bell sounding before the count could be completed.\\"Dixie Kid Gets Decision\\", Daily Arkansas Gazette, pg. 8, 2 November 1909 Clark would later fight for championships in Panama City, Panama against such exceptional black opponents as Kid Norfolk, a future International Boxing Hall of Fame recipient, Roughouse Ware, and Sam McVea. Clark would take the Panamanian Heavyweight Title in May 1915. Boxing in Europe 1910-20 =Impressive victory over Georges Carpentier in Paris, 1911= On August 11, 1911, he defeated the formidable idol of France, Georges Carpentier, in a fifth-round technical knockout in Trouville.

The bout brought European world welterweight status to Thomas and had an impressive purse of $5000, equal to the better purses the Kid had split in the United States. The Kid had the best of the earlier rounds, but Thomas came back in the later ones.\\"Dixie Kid Loses in Paris\\", El Paso Herald, El Paso, Texas, 5 October 1912 On April 25, 1912, the Kid soundly defeated an eighteen year old Georges Bernard at France's grand Cirq de Paris, in an eleventh-round technical knockout. The bout was billed as the 147 pound world title, putting it in the welterweight class.\\"Dixie Kid Drops Bernard\\", The Times, Munster, Indiana, pg. 3, 15 April 1912 About 1913, he trained Eugene Bullard as a boxer and arranged for him to fight in Paris. Bullard, an African-American, became a fighter pilot during World War I. The Kid completed his boxing career in Europe, featuring bouts in France, England, and Spain. In his career as both welterweight and middleweight, he fought such notable fighters as Jimmy Clabby, Frank Mantell, Larry Temple, Dave Holley, Young Peter Jackson, welterweight champion Mike \\"Twin\\" Sullivan, and black heavyweight contender Sam Langford Later life and death Kid fought over 150 bouts and retired in 1920. In May 1922, he made a meager living playing the drum in an orchestra in Berlin, extending his European boxing tour after WWI and hoping to open a gymnasium.\\"Dixie Kid is in Berlin\\", The Washington Times, Washington, D.C., pg. 10, 20 May 1922 Near the end of his life in the summer of 1933 when Jimmy McLarnin became world welterweight champion, the Kid appeared at the young boxer's training camp, picking the junior welterweight as a rising star. The Kid died April 6, 1934 in Los Angeles after falling out of a tenement story window. It is not known whether it was by accident or a suicide. Sadly, he lived near poverty at the time of his death, making ends meet with odd jobs and the occasional donation. Honours Kid was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame (2002). Nat Fleischer placed the Kid as the fifth best welterweight in boxing history. Herb Goldman ranked him as the sixteenth welterweight in boxing history. He was inducted into the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1975. Primary boxing achievement The following table shows the date of Dixie Kid's bout with Joe Walcott, April 29, 1904, though the bout was later disregarded as the referee Sullivan was found to have bet on the Kid. Dixie Kid's claim to the Welterweight Champion has since been disregarded by most boxing historians, as was his five-month claim to the title.

With the development of the Cape from the 1960s to the present, the wildfire danger has diminished but thousands of acres are still capable of burning. History Pre-European Before Europeans settled the Cape, the forests were periodically burned by lightning strikes and the Wampanoag version of the prescribed burn. This kept the amount of underbrush to a minimum, thus allowing the Cape to experience few, if any, major wildfires. Excavations of charcoal, pollen and sediment from Mary Dunn Pond, in Barnstable show that the Wampanoag practiced periodic burns.Wildland Fire and Preparedness Plan 2005. Retrieved January 30, 2013. Archived from the original on October 20, 2007. The area around the Indian Ponds of Barnstable, including Mystic Lake, Middle Pond, and Hamblin Pond used to be burned by natives who would then subsequently use the land in small plots to farm. Colonization In the 1620s, the Cape was forever altered by the settlement of Europeans. The settlers did not like periodic fires in their backyards, and they put out any fire before it could really burn and do damage. This, and massive deforestation by the initial settlers, led to a large amount of brush accumulating in the surviving woods of the Cape. Unfortunately for the settlers, this caused fires, when they occurred, to really burn and explode instead of burning along the ground. The forests of this time were small and spread out so there was not much potential for disaster, but that changed after industrialization. Industrial Age The discovery of the New World led to newfound industries to many Europeans. One was shipbuilding. This was important on the Cape because the tall trees which survived the mass deforestation of the initial settlement, led to the major expansion of the shipbuilding industry. This, along with the decreased farming of the land, created an opportunity for pitch pine and scrub oak to grow in abundance. This land was divided up into individual firewood plots. Some of this wood was bought up by the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company, which operated from 1825 to 1888 and the Barnstable Brick Company, which operated from 1878 to 1929. Unfortunately, this led to many fires burning many acres because the forests began to connect. Modern era In the early 1900s, the Cape started to become part of the state's fire lookout tower network. Towers were constructed in many towns to make it easier to coordinate firefighting. Massive burns occurred in the forests, larger than any seen since pre-colonial times. This was especially true on the Upper Cape, where the forests had matured more than the rest of Cape Cod. Modern techniques for fighting these fires include controlled burns and the clearing of brush. The discontinuation of live firing at the Massachusetts Military Reservation has also contributed to the decrease in the intensity of the fires. The military has helped with the hazard by periodically burning portions of the land to prevent these massive fires. According to a study published in 2003, the Cape has a fire that burns on the hundreds to thousands of acres size every 30 to 50 years. Camp Edwards was excluded from this research because it burns more with the munitions on the base.

A sequel to 1987's Barbarian, the player takes on the role of Hegor on a quest to destroy his resilient and nefarious brother, the sorcerer Necron. Plot Upon returning home at the end of Barbarian and having defeated his evil brother Necron, the High Council decreed that Hegor was not exactly the right person to take the reward of kingship. They inform him the position would demand much work on his part, and thus convince him to instead take a significant sum of gold as his reward. However, Hegor was never very good with numbers, and before long he soon finds himself broke again and looking for ways to pay for his wine and women. Whilst in the busy hamlet of Thelston he encounters a woman thief who claims she saw the barbarian seemingly defeat his brother, except after Hegor left Necron's remaining minions came along, retrieved their master's body and set about resurrecting him. Taking up arms, Hegor races to again face the challenges ahead, avenge his father's death and put an end to his brother's insidious activities once and for all. Gameplay The game takes place from a side-on view, and Hegor moves between areas across the six regions, including forests, caves and temples.

The prices are higher for more desirable numbers. A telephone number is a sequence of digits assigned to a fixed-line telephone subscriber station connected to a telephone line or to a wireless electronic telephony device, such as a radio telephone or a mobile telephone, or to other devices for data transmission via the public switched telephone network (PSTN) or other public and private networks. A telephone number serves as an address for switching telephone calls using a system of destination code routing.AT&T;, Notes on Distance Dialing (1968), Section II, p.1 Telephone numbers are entered or dialed by a calling party on the originating telephone set, which transmits the sequence of digits in the process of signaling to a telephone exchange. The exchange completes the call either to another locally connected subscriber or via the PSTN to the called party. Telephone numbers are assigned within the framework of a national or regional telephone numbering plan to subscribers by telephone service operators, which may be commercial entities, state-controlled administrations, or other telecommunication industry associations. Telephone numbers were first used in 1879 in Lowell, Massachusetts, when they replaced the request for subscriber names by callers connecting to the switchboard operator.Brooks, John.Telephone: The First Hundred Years. Harper & Row, 1967, : p. 74 , citing \\"Events in Telephone History\\". Over the course of telephone history, telephone numbers had various lengths and formats, and even included most letters of the alphabet in leading positions when telephone exchange names were in common use until the 1960s. Telephone numbers are often dialed in conjunction with other signaling code sequences, such as vertical service codes, to invoke special telephone service features. Concept and methodology When telephone numbers were first used they were very short, from one to three digits, and were communicated orally to a switchboard operator when initiating a call. As telephone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass worldwide communication, telephone numbers have become longer. In addition to telephones, they have been used to access other devices, such as computer modems, pagers, and fax machines. With landlines, modems and pagers falling out of use in favor of all-digital always-connected broadband Internet and mobile phones, telephone numbers are now often used by data-only cellular devices, such as some tablet computers, digital televisions, video game controllers, and mobile hotspots, on which it is not even possible to make or accept a call. The number contains the information necessary to identify uniquely the intended endpoint for the telephone call. Each such endpoint must have a unique number within the public switched telephone network. Most countries use fixed-length numbers (for normal lines at least) and therefore the number of endpoints determines the necessary length of the telephone number. It is also possible for each subscriber to have a set of shorter numbers for the endpoints most often used. These \\"shorthand\\" or \\"speed calling\\" numbers are automatically translated to unique telephone numbers before the call can be connected. Some special services have their own short numbers (e.g., 1-1-9, 9-1-1,1-0-0, 1-0-1, 1-0-2, 0-0-0, 9-9-9, 1-1-1, and 1-1-2 being the Emergency Services numbers for China, Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan and Sri Lanka; Canada and the United States; Israel (Police); Israel (Paramedic); Israel (Fire); Australia; the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Poland, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Macao, Bahrain, Qatar, Bangladesh, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mauritius, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Trinidad, Tobago, New Zealand, Kuwait, the European Union and the Philippines respectively.) The dialing plan in some areas permits dialing numbers in the local calling area without using area code or city code prefixes. For example, a telephone number in North America consists of a three-digit area code, a three-digit central office code, and four digits for the line number. If the area has no area code overlays or if the provider allows it, seven-digit dialing may be permissible for calls within the area, but some areas have implemented mandatory ten-digit dialing. Other special phone numbers are used for high-capacity numbers with several telephone circuits, typically a request line to a radio station where dozens or even hundreds of callers may be trying to call in at once, such as for a contest. For each large metro area, all of these lines will share the same prefix (such as 404-741-xxxx in Atlanta and 305-550-xxxx in Miami), the last digits typically corresponding to the station's frequency, callsign, or moniker. In the international telephone network, the format of telephone numbers is standardized by ITU-T recommendation E.164. This code specifies that the entire number should be 15 digits or shorter, and begin with a country prefix. For most countries, this is followed by an area code or city code and the subscriber number, which might consist of the code for a particular telephone exchange. ITU-T recommendation E.123 describes how to represent an international telephone number in writing or print, starting with a plus sign (\\"+\\") and the country code. When calling an international number from a landline phone, the + must be replaced with the international call prefix chosen by the country the call is being made from. Many mobile phones allow the + to be entered directly, by pressing and holding the \\"0\\" for GSM phones, or sometimes \\"*\\" for CDMA phones. The 3GPP standards for mobile networks provide a BCD-encoded field of ten bytes for the phone number (\\"Dialling Number/SCC String\\"). The international call prefix or \\"+\\" is not counted as it encodes a value in a separate byte (TON/NPI - type of number / numbering plan identification). If the MSISDN is longer than 20 digits then additional digits are encoded into extension blocks (EFEXT1) each having a BCD-encoded field of 11 bytes. This scheme allows to extend the subscriber number with a maximum of 20 digits by additional function values to control network services. In the context of ISDN the function values were transparently transported in a BCD-encoded field with a maximum of 20 Bytes named \\"ISDN Subaddress\\". The format and allocation of local phone numbers are controlled by each nation's respective government, either directly or by sponsored organizations (such as NANPA in the US or CNAC in Canada). In the United States, each state's public service commission regulates, as does the Federal Communications Commission. In Canada, which shares the same country code with the U.S. (due to Bell Canada's previous ownership by the U.S.-based Bell System), regulation is mainly through the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Local number portability (LNP) allows a subscriber to request moving an existing telephone number to another telephone service provider. Number portability usually has geographic limitations, such as an existing local phone company only being able to port to a competitor within the same rate centre. Mobile carriers may have much larger market areas, and can assign or accept numbers from any area within the region. In many telephone administrations, cell phone telephone numbers are in organized in prefix ranges distinct from land line service, which simplifies mobile number portability, even between carriers. Within most North American rate centres, local wireline calls are free, while calls to all but a few nearby rate centres are considered long distance and incur toll fees. In a few large US cities, as well as many points outside North America, local calls are not flat-rated or \\"free\\" by default.  History   United States  In the late 1870s, the Bell interests started utilizing their patent with a rental scheme, in which they would rent their instruments to individual users who would contract with other suppliers to connect them; for example from home to office to factory. Western Union and the Bell company both soon realized that a subscription service would be more profitable, with the invention of the telephone switchboard or central office. Such an office was staffed by an operator who connected the calls by personal names. Some have argued that use of the telephone altered the physical layout of American cities.Fischer, Claude S. America Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992. Web. The latter part of 1879 and the early part of 1880 saw the first use of telephone numbers at Lowell, Massachusetts. During an epidemic of measles, the physician, Dr. Moses Greeley Parker, feared that Lowell's four telephone operators might all succumb to sickness and bring about paralysis of telephone service. He recommended the use of numbers for calling Lowell's more than 200 subscribers so that substitute operators might be more easily trained in such an emergency. Parker was convinced of the telephone's potential, began buying stock, and by 1883 he was one of the largest individual stockholders in both the American Telephone Company and the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company. Even after the assignment of numbers, operators still connected most calls into the early 20th century: \\"Hello, Central. Get me Underwood-342.\\" Connecting through operators or \\"Central\\" was the norm until mechanical direct-dialing of numbers became more common in the 1920s. In rural areas with magneto crank telephones connected to party lines, the local phone number consisted of the line number plus the ringing pattern of the subscriber. To dial a number such as \\"3R122\\" meant making a request to the operator the third party line (if making a call off your own local one), followed by turning the telephone's crank once, a short pause, then twice and twice again. Also common was a code of long and short rings, so one party's call might be signaled by two longs and another's by two longs followed by a short. It was not uncommon to have over a dozen ring cadences (and subscribers) on one line. In the most areas of North America, telephone numbers in metropolitan communities consisted of a combination of digits and letters, starting in the 1920s until the 1960s. Letters were translated to dialed digits, a mapping that was displayed directly on the telephone dial. Each of the digits 2 to 9, and sometimes 0, corresponded to a group of typically three letters. The leading two or three letters of a telephone number indicated the exchange name, for example, EDgewood and IVanhoe, and were followed by 5 or 4 digits. The limitations that these system presented in terms of usable names that were easy to distinguish and spell, and the need for a comprehensive numbering plan that enabled direct-distance dialing, led to the introduction of all-number dialing in the 1960s. The use of numbers starting in 555- (KLondike-5) to represent fictional numbers in U.S. movies, television, and literature originated in this period. The \\"555\\" prefix was reserved for telephone company use and was only consistently used for directory assistance (information), being \\"555‚Äì1212\\" for the local area. An attempt to dial a 555 number from a movie in the real world will always result in an error message when dialed from a phone in the United States. This reduces the likelihood of nuisance calls. QUincy(5‚Äì5555) was also used, because there was no Q available. Phone numbers were traditionally tied down to a single location; because exchanges were \\"hard-wired\\", the first three digits of any number were tied to the geographic location of the exchange. = Alphanumeric telephone numbers = Face of a 1939 rotary dial showing a 2L-4N style alphanumeric telephone number LA-2697. 2008 photo shows a hairdressing shop in Toronto with an exterior sign showing the shop's telephone number in the old two-letters plus five-digits format. The North American Numbering Plan of 1947 prescribed a format of telephone numbers that included two leading letters of the name of the central office to which each telephone was connected. This continued the practice already in place by many telephone companies for decades. Traditionally, these names were often the names of towns, villages, or were other locally significant names. Communities that required more than one central office may have used other names for each central office, such as Main, East, West, Central, or the names of local districts. Names were convenient to use and reduced errors when telephone numbers were exchanged verbally between subscribers and operators. When subscribers could dial themselves, the initial letters of the names were converted to digits as displayed on the rotary dial. Thus, telephone numbers contained one, two, or even three letters followed by up to five numerals. Such numbering plans are called 2L-4N, or simply 2‚Äì4, for example, as shown in the photo of a telephone dial of 1939 (right). In this example, LAkewood 2697 indicates that a subscriber dialed the letters L and A, then the digits 2, 6, 9, and 7 to reach this telephone in Lakewood, NJ (USA). The leading letters were typically bolded in print. In December 1930, New York City became the first city in the United States to adopt the two-letter and five-number format (2L-5N), which became the standard after World War II, when the Bell System administration designed the North American Numbering Plan to prepare the United States and Canada for Direct Distance Dialing (DDD), and began to convert all central offices to this format. This process was complete by the early 1960s, when a new numbering plan, often call all number calling (ANC) became the standard in North America.  United Kingdom  In the UK, letters were assigned to numbers in a similar fashion to North America, except that the letter O was allocated to the digit 0 (zero); digit 6 had only M and N. The letter Q was later added to the zero position on British dials, in anticipation of direct international dialing to Paris, which commenced in 1963. This was necessary because French dials already had Q on the zero position, and there were exchange names in the Paris region which contained the letter Q. Most of the United Kingdom had no lettered telephone dials until the introduction of Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD) in 1958. Until then, only the director areas (Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Manchester) and the adjacent non-director areas had the lettered dials; the director exchanges used the three-letter, four-number format. With the introduction of trunk dialing, the need for all callers to be able to dial numbers with letters in them led to the much more widespread use of lettered dials. The need for dials with letters ceased with the conversion to all-digit numbering in 1968.  Intercepted number  In the middle 20th century in North America when a call could not be completed, for example because the phone number was not assigned, had been disconnected, or was experiencing technical difficulties, the call was routed to an intercept operator who informed the caller. In the 1970s this service was converted to Automatic Intercept Systems which automatically choose and present an appropriate intercept message. Disconnected numbers are reassigned to new users after the rate of calls to them declines. Outside of North America operator intercept was rare, and in most cases calls to unassigned or disconnected numbers would result in a recorded message or number-unobtainable tone being returned to the caller. Special feature codes Modern telephone keypad contains \\"*\\" and \\"#\\" Telephone numbers are sometimes prefixed with special services, such as vertical service codes, that contain signaling events other than numbers, most notably the star (*) and the number sign (#).Bellcore SR-2275 Bellcore Notes on the Network, Issue 3, Section 3 page 15. (December 1997) Vertical service codes enable or disable special telephony services either on a per-call basis, or for the station or telephone line until changed.NANPA definition of vertical service codes The use of the number sign is most frequently used as a marker signal to indicate the end of digit sequences or the end of other procedures; as a terminator it avoids operational delays when waiting for expiration of automatic time-out periods. In popular culture Australian films and television shows do not employ any recurring format for fictional telephone numbers; any number quoted in such media may be used by a real subscriber. The 555 code is used in the Balmain area of Sydney and the suburbs of Melbourne. Although in many areas being a prefix of 55 plus the thousand digit of 5 (e.g. 55 5XXX), would be valid, the numbering system was changed so that 555 became 9555 in Sydney and Melbourne, and in the country, there are 2 new digits ahead of the 55. However, elsewhere, as in the United States, fictitious telephone numbers are often used in films and on television to avoid disturbances by calls from viewers. For example, The United States 555 (KLondike-5) exchange code was never assigned (with limited exceptions such as 555‚Äì1212 for directory assistance). Therefore, American films and TV shows have used 555-xxxx numbers, in order to prevent a number used in such a work from being called. The film Bruce Almighty (2003) originally featured a number that did not have the 555 prefix. In the cinematic release, God (Morgan Freeman) leaves 776‚Äì2323 on a pager for Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) to call if he needed God's help. The DVD changes this to a 555 number. According to Universal Studios, which produced the movie, the number it used was picked because it did not exist in Buffalo, New York, where the movie was set. However, the number did exist in other cities, resulting in customers' having that number receiving random calls from people asking for God. While some played along with the gag, others found the calls aggravating.Vries, Lloyd (27 May 2003). \\"'Almighty' Phone Mess\\". CBS News.'Bruce Almighty' delivers wrong number. People Online.

The ship was launched and completed as Lake Superior. The Navy acquired the ship from the USSB with assignment to the Naval Overseas Transport Service (NOTS) with the identification number ID-2995. The ship was returned to the USSB which sold the vessel in 1926. The ship was renamed C. D. Johnston III and that vessel operated out of Oregon until again sold and based in San Francisco. Another sale resulted in the vessel being renamed Anna Shafer which was acquired by the War Shipping Administration (WSA) in 1942 and allocated to the Navy for World War II service.  Construction  The ship, War Bayonet was one of seven cargo ships under construction in 1917 for the British Shipping Controller at Toledo, Ohio, by the Toledo Shipbuilding Company that were requisitioned by the (USSB.The ship was British specified and thus not one of the standard USSB ships of World War I. The ship was Toledo's yard hull number 141 that after requisition was renamed Lake Superior, launched 31 October 1917 with official number 215756. 1918 Navy ship's data shows the ship as having two boilers providing steam for a triple expansion engine giving a speed of to the , 4,300 tons displacement, with an overall length of , length between perpendiculars of , breadth on load water line of , a mean draft of with depth of hold being . As a World War I naval auxiliary the ship was crewed by 10 officers and forty-two men and armed with one 5 inch/50 caliber and one 3 inch/50 caliber gun.  World War I service  War Bayonet was acquired by the Navy 12 December 1917 and commissioned 30 January 1918 as Lake Superior designated ID-2995. Lake Superior was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transport Service (NOTS) designated as a mine transport, but also functioning in other roles, including gasoline, coal and cargo transport. In February 1918 the transport delivered a cargo of gasoline to Bermuda with a return to Norfolk before making a coaling run to Halifax, Nova Scotia and back to Norfolk in March. The ship departed Norfolk 10 May for Oban, Scotland with a load of mines and military supplies reaching Oban on 28 May. From Oban Lake Superior went to the Klye and Clyde areas of Scotland with a 7‚Äì20 June return voyage to Norfolk. Two similar trips were made Between 18 July and 6 December 1918. Between 14 December 1918 and 20 February 1919 the ship transported coal to Bermuda and the Florida ports of Key West and Pensacola. From 6 March to 7 April the ship transported Marine Corps aviation equipment to the West Indies. For the remainder of service the ship operated as a cargo transport on the Atlantic coast from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to Melville, Rhode Island. On 21 July Lake Superior arrived in Norfolk from New York and decommissioned on 31 July 1919 to be returned to the USSB.  Civilian service  The ship was sold by USSB in 1926 to the Pacific Spruce Corporation of Newport Oregon, renamed C. D. Johnston III with home port of Newport, Oregon. The vessels signal letters were LJFM with crew noted as twenty-six. The Times-Mirror Company of Los Angeles bought the ship in 1932 to transport newsprint. The ship was sold in 1934 to Shafer Brothers Steamship Line of San Francisco and renamed Anna Shafer.  World War II service  Anna Shafer was acquired by the WSA on 10 July 1942 at San Pedro, California and turned over to the Navy on 16 October 1942. The Navy renamed the ship Tuluran, designated AG-46, and completed conversion at the General Engineering & Drydock Co., Alameda, California, on 8 December 1942. Tuluran was commissioned at San Francisco, California, on 11 December 1942, Lt. F. G. Isbell, USNR, in command. Three days later, Tuluran joined the U.S. Pacific Fleet Service Force. On Christmas Eve, the ship stood out of San Francisco, bound for the South Pacific Ocean. After stopping at Pearl Harbor from 6 January to 22 February 1943, Tuluran continued on to Samoa, arriving in Tutuila on the 28th. She operated at Samoa for the next nine months before departing Tutuila on 26 November bound for the United States. After a one-day stop at Pearl Harbor on 11 December, she continued on to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 23 December. For the next four months, Tuluran underwent an extensive overhaul. On 19 April 1944, Tuluran departed the U.S. West Coast to return to the South Pacific Ocean and duty shuttling cargo between bases in the rear areas of the war zone. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 29 April to 2 May and returned to Tutuila on 13 May. This time, however, she only remained overnight and, the following day, resumed her voyage. The cargo ship reached the New Hebrides Islands on the 21st. Eight days later, Tuluran departed Espiritu Santo to deliver cargo to the southern Solomon Islands. She reached Guadalcanal on 5 June and remained there until the 20th when she headed back to the New Hebrides, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 3 July. She remained until early August when she moved to the New Guinea area where she operated from 17 August until the beginning of October, when she steamed via Espiritu Santo to the Solomons. After serving at Guadalcanal until mid-November, the ship made her first voyage to the Central Pacific. Following visits to Saipan in the Mariana Islands and to Peleliu in the Palau Islands, she returned to the southwestern Pacific in mid-December. She visited the Russell Islands subgroup in the Solomons from 17 to 19 December and spent a month at Noum√©a, New Caledonia, from 24 December 1944 to 24 January 1945, before returning to Espiritu Santo on the 27th. She departed the New Hebrides once more on 19 February and headed back to the Solomon Islands, where she operated for the next two months. During that tour of duty, she returned to Guadalcanal first and then visited the Treasury Islands subgroup, Bougainville, the Green Islands, and the Russell Islands again as well as making a side trip to Emirau Island. On 3 April, the cargo ship departed the Russell subgroup and headed back to the Central Pacific. For the remainder of the war, Tuluran carried cargo between the American bases and anchorages established at various atolls in the Marshall Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Mariana Islands. Her itinerary over the last five months of the war included Eniwetok, Ulithi, Peleliu, Guam, and Saipan. On 8 August, a week before the cessation of hostilities, Tuluran stood out of Eniwetok bound for Hawaii. Japan capitulated a week before the ship arrived in Pearl Harbor. Tuluran spent three days at Oahu and then continued her voyage east on 24 August.  Post-war dispositioning  On 3 September, she entered San Francisco; and, on 20 December 1945, Tuluran was decommissioned. She was stripped of usable materiel at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 8 January 1946, and the Commandant, 12th Naval District, turned her over to the U.S. Maritime Commission for final disposition on 1 July 1946. The ship entered the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet on 30 June 1946 and on 7 January 1947 purchased by the American Iron & Metal Company and subsequently scrapped.

He was born in Giurizzani di Materada in Istria, to a middle-class family of ancient southern Dalmatian origins (his ancestor's name was Jure Jurcan [Zorzi Giurizzano], and came there in the 16th century in order to escape from the Ottoman invasion; southern Dalmatia and Istria were at the time both under the rule of the Republic of Venice; Venice was interested in the migration: Istria at the time was indeed underpopulated because of an epidemic). Tomizza grew up in a zone where the dialect was mixed (Venetian mixed with Slavic words or Slavic mixed with Venetian words). He completed high school at the Italian Liceo \\"Carlo Combi\\" of Capodistria (now Koper, in Slovenia). After the diploma, he had experiences of study and work in Yugoslavia (Faculty of humanities in Belgrade and the shooting of a movie in Ljubljana). Following the 1954 annexation of Zone B by Yugoslavia, Tomizza moved to Trieste. Most of his writing career took place there, including three books (Materada, La miglior vita, La quinta stagione) set in the Istria of his youth. Other works include the figure of the bishop-reformer Pier Paolo Vergerio, the life of the exiled Istrians in Italy, some events concerning the Slovenian community in Italy (one couple mysteriously killed during World War II in Trieste and the love story between an Italian official and a Slovenian girl; each story is based on true facts, using original letters), some fictions set in the Venetian territory and various articles (also effect of his trips as reporter).

There is some evidence that interleukin-10 may inhibit it in an animal model. It is classified as type II lupus nephritis by the World Health Organization (WHO). Common shorthand for the condition is MesPGN. Mechanism Mesangial cells in the renal glomerulus use endocytosis to take up and degrade circulating immunoglobulin. This normal process stimulates mesangial cell proliferation and matrix deposition. Therefore, during times of elevated circulating immunoglobulin (i.e. lupus and IgA nephropathy) one would expect to see an increased number of mesangial cells and matrix in the glomerulus. This is characteristic of nephrotic syndromes. Diagnosis The clinical presentation of MesPGN is varied, although persistent or recurring microscopic or macroscopic hematuria with mild proteinuria is most common. Studies are performed in most patients to exclude known causes. MesPGN can also be a finding in resolving postinfectious. Isolated deposits with scanty subendothelial or subepithelial (hump-like) deposits on electron microscopy may be seen in this situation indicating a likelihood of MesPGN. Treatment Of the eleven known cases of nephrotic syndrome, three early cases went untreated. Subsequently, four were treated with steroids and four treated with steroids and cytotoxic drugs, one in each group achieved remission while the remaining patients continued to have steroid dependency or resistance. Two of these latter patients manifested steroid responsiveness, steroid resistance, and spontaneous remission at different times in their courses. Renal function remained normal in all.

It is part of Jhelum Tehsil,Tehsils & Unions in the District of Jhelum - Government of Pakistan and is located at 33¬∞10'48N 72¬∞57'59E with an altitude of 467 metres (1535 feet).Location of Kala Gujran - Falling Rain Genomics Kala gujran is near Jhelum City.It is home to two major mosques, Jamia Masjid Kala Gujran & Jamia Masjid Kashmirian. Pakistan Tobacco Company is also situated here. There is a small industrial estate in which there are approximately 80 small Mills. Until its recent decline the Fauji Mill complex was a major employer in the area, it used to produce cloth for export and distribution nationally. Pakistan national motorway 2 named G.T. Road (General Trunk Road) passes through the town. There are two major bus stops, named Phatik and Kala Mor. The Rescue 1122 office is also situated there. History Kala Gujran is located on the route of the old GT road and predates the city of Jhelum in its importance. It has been a significant market town and Gujjar stronghold since ancients times with the Hindu and then the Sikhs rulers leaving relics in the old bazaar. In particular the area surrounding the old school has lakes locally known as the five sisters, so called as they drained into each other with five pippal trees planted in line. There were five ancient Hindu temples (mandirs) on the site, abandoned and subsequently destroyed during Partition. The leading temple had a traceable tunnel leading directly to a covered \\"kooh\\" (Persian water wheel irrigation system in an outpost agricultural settlement) on the town's northbound outskirts, along the Chak Jamal Rd. This was reputedly run by a powerful courtesan presumably to afford safe passage for the chieftains or priests during times of conflict. There are reports of some local \\"koohs\\" having tablets of stone at the bottom with carvings dating back hundreds of years. There are also planted Sacred Fig (Ficus religiosa) \\"Pippal\\" trees in a line going from Kala Gujran up to what is now known as the Mangla Fort affording an identifiable safe route passage to the fort at Mangla also known as Ramkot. It is not known if the passages could be traced from Rohtas or Tilla Jogian to Mangla forts but part of it most definitely passes from Kala Gujran to Mangla. In Tilla Jogian and ancient Ramkot (now Mangla) there are also similar lakes or tanks that drain into each other. The elders and historian bards of the Kala Gujran locale speak of people including in recent times having their ears pierced in line with what has been happening in the Tilla Jogian and Kala Gujran areas for centuries. The lakes and the school are currently in a neglected state and the mandirs have gone with the only trace left being a few marble floor tiles. The Gujjars of the area have variously been described as a problematic but powerful tribe in particular the Tikri Gujjar clan. There are references to the Tikkri Gujjars being an important tribe in the area and beyond with towns and regions named after the tribe. There were significant Sikh and Muslim Gujjars from this area leading in the nearby Battle of Chillianwala, fought during the Second Anglo-Sikh War in the Chillianwala region of Punjab. The battle was one of the bloodiest fought by the British East India Company. It was a strategic check to immediate British ambitions in India and a shock to British military prestige. The British were defeated. They returned however with numerous reinforcements and carried out wholesale massacres in the city of Gujrat. They subsequently set up a battalion in Jhelum and named it \\"the city of soldiers\\" The Battle of the Hydaspes River was fought by Alexander the Great in 326 BC against the Hindu King Porus (Pururava in Sanskrit) on the banks of the Hydaspes River (Jhelum River). In those days Kala Gujran would have been the favoured large city in the area. The Paurava kingdom of King Porus was situated here and many elite trained personnel would have been conscripted from Kala Gujran or Kamboja. The Hydaspes was the last major and most costly battle fought by Alexander.[15] King Porus and his Tikri Gujjar men put up strong resistance against the invading Macedonian army which caused them to be admired and respected by Alexander.[16] Although victorious, Alexander's exhausted army mutinied soon after, when he made plans to cross river Hydaspes (Beas River), and refused to go further into India. Ancient vedic texts describe the area as being part of Kamboja kingdom, dominated by Hun warrior classes excelling at hand-to-hand combat, horsemanship and a mercenary attitude. The war horses of Kamboja were famous through all periods of Indian History. In the battle fought on the fields of Kurukshetra, the fastest and powerful horses of Kamboja were of greatest service. There is mention that the people were distinctly different from the rest of the kingdom in their appearance, stature, physical prowess, dress religious beliefs and practises, further reference and conjecture to the Huns or Aryan theories as described in history. There are also cross references with ancient and recent historical battles and notable individuals with direct lineage to the Gujjar Tikkri clans. The Gujjars were once the most influential group and chieftains of Kala Gujran (hence the name). The British when they did take over the region did not allow the Gujjars to join the military or civil service citing them as unreliable, unfit and associated very strongly to the criminal and mercenary Thuggee gangs, going so far as to criminalise them with the introduction of Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. However, the area is famously known as the land of martyrs and warriors and many specialised as mercenary fighters. When it was eventually repealed and the Gujjars were allowed to join the ranks they were instrumental during the 1857 uprisings, the Indian mutiny. During subsequent periods the Gujjars in this area did not take advantage of the political process being easily manipulated by puppet regimes instilled by the colonial British rulers to tactfully divide and rule the princely states.

During its heyday, Spongebath was often viewed as the vibrant center of Murfreesboro/Nashville's (and the Southeast's) music scene with a robust artist roster of critically acclaimed bands, singers, and songwriters. From 1997-1999, Spongebath attracted national press and media attention for garnering co-label deals with DreamWorks Records (for Self's 1999 album Breakfast with Girls) and with Elektra Records (for the Katies self-titled 1999 album.) Bands/artists on Spongebath at one time or another included: Self, Fluid Ounces, the Katies, The Features, Count Bass D, Fleshpaint, The C60's, The New System, The Roaries, Gumption, Call Florence Pow, Ruby Amanfu, and Knodel. History The label began as the brainchild of three people: Self frontman Matt Mahaffey (who had just dropped out of MTSU), singer/songwriter Seth Timbs (of Fluid Ounces), and Mahaffey's manager Rick Williams. Timbs, in fact, was the one who came up with the name \\"Spongebath.\\" In the mid-to-late '90s, there was a resurgence of interest in the Middle Tennessee rock scene, when Spongebath Records began to turn heads for signing promising, talented local bands like Self, Fluid Ounces, and The Features. Their office was located at 101 N. Maple in downtown Murfreesboro, and they were impossible to miss--the walls were painted in bright purple, yellow, and red colors, allowing it to stand out amidst a sleepy, rather drab and comfortably geriatric courthouse/downtown square. The label even got the attention of Billboard, which ran a cover story in August 1997 chronicling Murfreesboro's rise as \\"an emerging music mecca,\\" while other writers half- jokingly began to refer to the scene as \\"little Seattle.\\" In reality, the Murfreesboro music scene was much more in line with progressive college-towns like Athens, Georgia and Austin, Texas--towns that had a rich history of championing indie rock and quality bands. Regionally, at least, the Spongebath brand itself became fairly synonymous with top quality music, ranging from the melodic indie pop of the Features, the Katies' radio-friendly brand of hard rock, or the genre-blurring hip-hop of Count Bass-D. All the Spongebath releases--largely recorded on minimal, scattershot budgets--tended to receive wonderful critical acclaim. Even the packaging for Spongebath releases was different: Brian Bottcher's artwork for albums like Self's Breakfast with Girls, Fluid Ounces' In the New Old-Fashioned Way, or Count Bass-D's Art for Sale all had an unmistakable, distinct, and sophisticated visual flair. Self was the most successful of the label's artists, the band having modest success and developing a cult following with Subliminal Plastic Motives while getting spins for \\"So Low\\" and \\"Cannon\\" on MTV. Because of Spongebath's prime location (on the downtown Square and only a few doors down from Sebastian's, one of the most frequented clubs in Murfreesboro during that time) and casual, fun atmosphere, one would often find various labelmates/band members at the Spongebath offices answering phones, sending mail, making posters, folding t-shirts, or just hanging out. Spongebath encouraged fans of the label and of the bands to come by the office, and many did, either begging Williams to listen to their demo tape or simply asking how or where they could meet the label's most visible star, Matt Mahaffey. (One of the few if only bands that reportedly benefited from an unsolicited demo submission to the label was Call Florence Pow, two teenage fans of Mahaffey's. The strength of their demo got them a deal with Spongebath, with Mahaffey producing their first and only album for Spongebath, These Are the Plans.)

He was also Speaker of the House of Commons at the three Parliaments between 1393 and 1398, during which he supported the policies of king Richard II. He was most famous for orchestrating the abdication of parliament's power to an eighteen-man subcommittee in order to concentrate power in the hands of the king's supporters.Speakers of the House of Commons from the Earliest Times to the Present Day Bussy's pre-eminence at court and execution after Richard's abdication were dramatised by Shakespeare in Richard II, where he appears as one of three councillors (Bushy, Bagot and Greene) who are accused by Henry Bolingbroke (later Henry IV) of misleading the king. He also appears as a character in Thomas of Woodstock. Early career He was the son of Sir William Bussy and Isabel Paynell, the daughter of John Paynell. He married twice; firstly in 1382 to Maud, daughter of Sir Philip de Neville and secondly in 1386 to Mary, widow of Ralph Daubeney. He owned lands in Lincolnshire. In 1378 secured a position with John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, as the Steward of all his lands north of the Trent. He worked for the Duke until 1397 but had by then (1391) entered the service of Richard II. He was High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1383, 1385 and 1390. Consolidation of power He became a close confidant and advisor of Richard and together with Sir Henry Green and Sir William Bagot became a \\"continual councillor\\". The three continual councillors went on to acquire an unsavoury reputation. Bussy became notorious for his gross flattery of the king. He was elected speaker of Parliament three times, first in 1393, and later by the two parliaments convened in 1397. It was in the latter of the two that Bussy became most notorious. He forced the parliament to delegate all its authority to a committee of which he was a member. The committee comprised eighteen members (12 Lords, 6 Commons). Each was carefully chosen as a strong supporter of Richard. By this means Bussy secured a monopoly on power by the king's supporters. Fall and death When Henry Bolingbroke (King Henry IV) returned in 1399 from exile to forcibly claim his inheritance, Bussy was captured on 28 July at Bristol Castle, together with William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire and Sir Henry Green, and the next day tried and beheaded for crimes of treason against the Kingdom.*Chris Given-Wilson, 'Chronicles of the revolution, 1397-1400:The Reign of King Richard II' (Barnes & Noble, 1997), , pg 128 In English drama * In Shakespeare's Richard II he is one of three councillors (Bushy, Bagot and Greene) accused by Bolingbroke of misleading the king. * Bussy also appears in Thomas of Woodstock as \\"William Bushy\\", again portrayed as one of the king's favourites.Shakespeare and History website.

Rogan, 340 U.S. 511 (1951), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state franchise tax upon the services performed by a railroad in handling imported and exported goods did not violate the Import-Export Clause of the United States Constitution.. Background The Canton Railroad is an industrial switching railroad operating in the port area of Baltimore, Maryland. The State of Maryland imposed a franchise tax on the gross receipts of the railroad, apportioned based upon the percentage of the railroad trackage located within the state. A substantial portion of the freight handled by the Canton Railroad involved goods that were either being imported or exported into the United States. Canton Railroad for the tax year of 1946 claimed that $705,957.21 of its total receipts of $1,588,744.48 should be exempt from taxation because they were derived from operations in foreign commerce. The State Tax Commission rejected the railroad's claim of exemption, and imposed a tax of $39,029.34. Canton Railroad appealed the State Tax Commission to the Baltimore City Circuit Court and then to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. The Court of Appeals upheld the imposition of the tax with two judges dissenting.  Court's decision  The majority opinion by Justice Douglas first noted that the Import-Export Clause of the Constitution of Article One, Section 10, Clause 2 provides that > No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or > Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for > executing its inspection Laws ... The opinion then noted that the franchise tax was not similar to those state taxes the Supreme Court had struck down in cases that had taxed goods being exported or imported, in that this tax was a general tax on revenues from the handling of the goods and not on the goods themselves. The opinion held that to import or export involve acts that begin and end at the water's edge (country's border), and that to use the railroad's argument that it was involved in exporting and importing would create a zone of tax immunity covering nearly every forest, mine, and factory in the country. For this reasoning, the Court held that the Maryland franchise tax did not violate the Import-Export Clause. Lastly, regarding a claim that the tax violated the Commerce Clause, the Court noted that prior cases had already held that a state franchise tax structured in this manner did not violate this clause. The dissent by Justice Jackson, styled as an opinion reserving judgment on the case, discussed the history of the Import-Export Clause as one of the fundamental policies imbedded in the Constitution. The constitutional concern was that states with ports and their associated roads would exploit this advantage, causing inland states to pay tribute to the seaboard states for the privilege of exportation. The dissent considered this federal policy to go beyond simple direct taxation on goods, and that Maryland's franchise tax had the effect of directly increasing the cost of exports. However, the dissent noted that the effect of the federal policy on the validity of the state tax was not addressed before the state courts or by the railroad company's counsel before the Supreme Court, so the Justice did not wish to express a final view on this matter. This dissenting opinion was also to apply to the companion case decided on the same day, Western Maryland R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U.S. 520 (1951). Chief Justice Vinson did not take part in the consideration or decision of the case.  Subsequent developments  The holding of Canton Railroad was reaffirmed when it was cited in both the majority and dissenting opinions in United States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U.S. 843 (1996), a case involving a federal tax on the insurance coverage of goods to be exported. The Maryland franchise tax has been recodified at Section 8-101 and 8-102 of the Tax-General Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland.

Biography  Franz Defregger was born on 30 April 1835 at the Ederhof in Stronach, Tyrol in the Austrian Empire. He was the second son of Maria (n√©e Fercher) and Michael Defregger, a farmer, who also had five daughters. His mother and two of his sisters died in 1841 during a typhoid epidemic. Franz himself nearly died from the fever. During his early years, Franz developed a strong love of music, and learned to play the flugelhorn. He soon became a member of a local band in D√∂lsach, playing at weddings, assemblies, and balls. Franz also displayed an early talent for drawing and woodcarving, which he developed autodidactically while working on his father's farm. After his father died in 1858, Franz took over the farm at the age of twenty-three. Within two years, however, he sold the farm and shared the money with his sisters who wanted to emigrate to America. Defregger moved to Innsbruck and studied woodcarving with the sculptor Michael Stolz, a professor at the Innsbrucker Trade School. Stoltz soon recognized Defregger's greater talent as a painter, and in the autumn of 1860, he arranged a meeting with Karl von Piloty at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. At Piloty's suggestion, Defregger attended a preparatory class at the Academy with Hermann Dyck. On 19 July 1861, Defregger passed the entrance examination and was accepted into the Academy. In the autumn of that year, he enrolled in a painting class given by Hermann Anschutz. In the summer of 1863, with the encouragement of architect Dominik Stadler, Defregger travelled to Paris to enhance his studies at the academy. He enrolled at the √âcole des beaux-arts on the recommendation of Alexander Laemlein. In 1864, he took part in the Salon des Refus√©s; the Salon catalog from 1864 listed him as \\"√©l√®ve de l'√âcole des Beaux-Arts\\". During his time in Paris, Defregger's work was influenced by his experiences in the city and through autodidactic study at museums, art collections, and studios. After spending two years in Paris, Defregger returned to Munich in July 1865 and began studying under Piloty at the academy. During the next few years, Defregger also spent time in East Tyrol, painting portraits of his relatives and friends. Between 1867 and 1870, he worked with Hans Makart and Gabriel of Max in the studio of the Munich history painter Piloty. His paintings were popular, and he soon became successful as an artist. He was professor of history painting from 1878 to 1910 at the Munich Art Academy. He preferred portraits, rustic motifs from the everyday life, and dramatic scenes from the Tyrolean national uprising of 1809. In 1883, Defregger was given the Order of Merit of the Bavarian crown, and was made a Knight of the collected personal nobility. He received numerous prizes and awards, including the Prussian Order of Merit for Science and the Arts. In 1906, his work was displayed at the Century of German Art exhibition in Berlin. His students included the Gr√∂den artists Josef Moroder Lusenberg and Hans Perathoner, Lovis Corinth, Walter Thor, Hugo Engl, Emma von M√ºller and many others. Defregger also worked alongside other artists in the studio, especially Rudolf Epp, developing a style consistent with the Munich school. Franz Defregger died in Munich in 1921 at the age of 85. He was buried at Nordfriedhof in Munich.  Legacy  Defregger's private home in Munich, called the Defregger House, was built by architect Georg von Hauberrisser. Defregger's residence in Bolzano, the Villa Defregger, was built in 1879 according to the plans of the Bolzano city architect Sebastian Altmann. In 1922 in Vienna, a street was named \\"Defreggerstra√üe\\" to honor the artist. Similar street dedications occurred in Bolzano and Gries am Brenner‚Äîboth have since been renamed. Built in 1887, the Defreggerhaus refuge at the foot of the Gro√üvenediger mountain was also named in his honor.

In addition to the routine small-time robberies they're dealing with on a daily basis, they must face a very dangerous and powerful man called Dalton Rhodes (David Carradine), who's not only a smuggler of guns and stolen luxury cars, but also a master of martial arts. Police are finding one body after another of mafia related people (all killed with bare hands). Sean and Billie have only vague clues in this case and no idea who's actually behind those murders. An aid in solving the riddle is to come from Sean's troubled younger brother Michael, who's found himself working for the mob boss Rhodes. Soon he'll learn that an easy way to get rich is also extremely dangerous and sometimes lethal.

Hernan developed out of a tropical wave that formed off the east coast of Africa on July 24. Over the next week, the wave traversed the Atlantic without development and entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2. The wave became better organized over the next several days and was declared Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 6. The depression quickly became Tropical Storm Hernan later that day. Hernan steadily intensified over the next two days and was upgraded to a hurricane on the morning of August 8. Hernan continued to intensify and became the first major hurricane--a storm with winds of 111 mph (178 km/h) or higher--of the season on August 9. After reaching major hurricane status, Hernan steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane. The weakening continued, and Hernan was further downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11. As Hernan moved over cold waters, the convection associated with the storm dissipated, leaving only a swirl of clouds. By the morning of August 12, almost all of the convection associated with Hernan had dissipated and the system was declared a remnant low-pressure area. The remnants of the hurricane caused light rain to Hawaii. Origins On July 24, a tropical wave emerged from the east coast of Africa, near the Cape Verde Islands. The wave was disorganized and failed to develop convection as it traversed the Atlantic Ocean over the next several days. The wave eventually entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2, and interacted with a broad area of cyclonic flow located a few hundred miles south of Mexico. The wave became better organized throughout the day, and an area of low pressure formed 660 mi (1060 km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico on August 5. Strong convection began to develop. That day, a banding feature formed On the morning of August 6, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued. Later in the day, the National Hurricane Center determined that the system had developed sufficient convection to be declared Tropical Depression Nine-E while located 775 mi (1230 km) to the south- southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Sur. However, the storm was operationally believed to have become a depression several hours later. Tropical Depression Nine-E was influenced by a high pressure area located over Mexico, causing it to move 16 mph (26 km/h) to the north-west. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hernan overnight as the storm became more organized. Although Hernan was located over warm waters, moderate wind shear prevented the storm from intensifying quickly, and the storm slowed. Hernan slowly became better organized throughout the night, but wind shear continued to impair Hernan through the morning; as a result, most of the tropical cyclone forecast models did not predict Hernan to become a hurricane. Intensification and peak strength Tropical Storm Hernan intensifying on August 7 In the early afternoon of August 7, an eye feature began to form; subsequently, Hernan was nearing hurricane status. However, by the nighttime hours, a microwave satellite found that the center of Hernan was located to the west-southwest of the eye feature, and the intensification ceased for the rest of the day and into the morning of August 8. Later in the morning, the center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath the eye and was determined to have become a hurricane, the fifth of the season, during the afternoon of August 8. Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish. Despite a cloud-filled eye, meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a category 2 hurricane overnight. Early on August 9, Hernan was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane, with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h). Convection around the eye continued become more symmetrical, though the National Hurricane Center had stated that Hernan had most likely reached its peak intensity or was very close to doing so. However, the eye suddenly became better defined. Based on this, Hernan was upgraded to a major hurricane. The intensity of Hernan was uncertain, as there was some difference between intensity estimates. Hernan maintained its appearance through the evening and it was stated that the peak intensity of the storm may have been 125 mph (205 km/h). Overnight, Hernan moved over cooler waters and started to weaken. Although the eye remained well defined, outflow to all the southwestern semicircle became poor. Weakening and dissipation Hurricane Hernan at peak intensity on August 9 Hernan rapidly weakened overnight and was barely a Category 2 in the afternoon hours of August 10 as it moved over cooler waters. The erosion of the eyewall was later found to be caused by an eyewall replacement cycle that rapidly completed itself during the afternoon. Continuing to slowly weaken, Hernan was soon downgraded to a strong Category 1. The newly formed eye began to shrink and deteriorate through the early afternoon, but Hernan briefly stopped weakening. Initially, Hernan's strong circulation allowed it to maintain hurricane status over 24 ¬∞C waters. Early on August 11, Hernan was downgraded to a tropical storm. Deep convection diminished around the center of the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23 ¬∞C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460 mi (740 km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low- pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.

Joseph Wheeler's Confederate cavalry scored a great initial success, but subsequently was roughed up by Union cavalry during its withdrawal south of the Tennessee River. Background After being defeated in the Battle of Chickamauga, the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, withdrew into the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, and was besieged by Gen. Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee. The Federals held a rail head at Bridgeport, Alabama, but because Bragg's army occupied Lookout Mountain, they had to bring supplies into the beleaguered city by wagon. The routes along the Tennessee River were easily harassed by the Confederates, so Rosecrans had to bring most of his supplies into Chattanooga from Bridgeport along a 60-mile wagon route across Walden's Ridge. Bragg ordered Wheeler to take the bulk of his cavalry corps and disrupt Rosecrans's communications across Walden's Ridge. Anderson's Cross Roads Map of Wheeler's raid Wheeler set out on October 1 with the divisions of Brig. Gen. Frank Crawford Armstrong and Maj. Gen. William T. Martin, plus part of Maj. Gen. John A. Wharton's division. He quickly broke through the screen of Brig. Gen. George Crook's 2nd Cavalry Division near Decatur, Tennessee, and rode toward Walden's Ridge. On October 2 at Anderson's Cross Roads, Wheeler surprised a train of 800 mule-drawn wagons, plus sutler's wagons. The Southern horsemen easily overwhelmed the few guards and began to carry out their orders to \\"kill the mules and burn the wagons.\\" Soon, whiskey was discovered in the sutler's wagons and Wheeler's men began pillaging the wagons for new clothing and other booty. The officers were either unwilling or unable to stop what became an eight-hour orgy of plundering.Cozzens, p. 19. Soon, Col. Edward M. McCook arrived with his brigade of Union cavalry. In a series of skirmishes, McCook lost 70 men while recapturing 800 mules and a few wagons and inflicting 270 losses on the tipsy Southerners. Wharton rode to McMinnville, Tennessee, which was captured with a loss of 388 Federals and 23 Confederates. Meanwhile, Crook could deflect Wheeler's main body away from the supply base at Murfreesboro, Tennessee.Boatner, p. 911. Farmington By October 7, Brig. Gen. Robert Byington Mitchell concentrated McCook and Crook at Shelbyville, Tennessee. That day, Crook mauled Henry B. Davidson's brigade of Wharton near Farmington, losing 75 Federals while inflicting a loss of 310. The pursuit continued in foul weather as some elements of Union cavalry rode as many as 57 miles. Wheeler escaped across the Tennessee River on October 9 at Rogersville, Alabama, but not before another 95 of his horsemen were overwhelmed near Pulaski, Tennessee. Aftermath Wheeler inflicted significant damage to the Army of the Cumberland's supply line. He destroyed 500 wagons by Rosecrans's estimate and claimed killing 1,000 mules. However, during the pursuit, his command was badly roughed up by the Union horsemen, \\"his once proud command all but wrecked.\\"Cozzens, p. 35. In the face of the aggressive Northern cavalry, Brig. Gen. Phillip Roddey cut short his follow-up raid. Another planned cavalry raid by Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Lee was canceled after he found out that Wheeler's command was no longer in the field.

Its large size and bright colors make it a popular aquarium fish, even though it can be difficult to keep. Distribution The king angelfish is a non-migratory tropical fish that inhabits reefs in the eastern Pacific Ocean from the coast of Peru north to the Gulf of California, including offshore islands as far west as the Galapagos, generally at depth of . Description Males and females are visually identical. They do, however undergo significant changes in coloration and to a lesser degree shape as they mature. Juvenile king angelfish are primarily yellow, with fins rimmed with iridescent blue, blue striping towards the posterior of their bodies, and an orange mask around the eye. Sexually mature king angelfish, on the other hand, have mostly brown or blue bodies (depending on the light) with the same blue rimming around the fins and a yellow tail. King angelfish generally grow to 35 cm long. They have between 18 and 20 rays in their dorsal fin and each of their pectoral fins, and 17 to 19 in their anal fin. They also have a strong spike under their lower cheek for defensive purposes. Habitat and diet King angelfish primarily inhabit the middle and bottom of the water column of rocky tropical reefs, including in the larger crevices between rocks, and juveniles can occasionally be found in tide pools. They are diurnal and feed on sponges, other sessile invertebrates, zooplankton, and certain species of benthic microalgae. King angelfish also clean scallop hammerhead sharks. In aquariums King angelfish are somewhat popular as aquarium fish; however, their large size, specialized diet, and high cost make them comparatively poor pets. They have not bred in captivity and hence can be very difficult to find in most hobby shops, although they are slightly more available through mail order companies. King angelfish also have a well-deserved reputation for being difficult to keep, largely because they require sponges and tunicates as a food source and will often not accept prepared foods, even ones that contain sponges or tunicates as ingredients. They are not particularly picky about salinity or pH, so long as these are kept stable and the water quality high. Angelfish in general are not generally good community inhabitants, king angels being no exception. If they are introduced when young, a lucky aquarist may be able to keep two angels in one appropriately size aquarium, but such experiences tend to be the exception, not the norm. King angelfish are quite dominant and can be abusive to smaller or more docile tankmates, or angelfish that are lower on the social hierarchy for whatever reason. Reproduction King angelfish are monogamous within their pairs and, during their spawning cycle, will mate daily around sunset. During a spawning cycle a pair can produce upwards of ten million fertilized eggs, averaging about 25,000‚Äì75,000 daily. These eggs then drift in the water column for about 20 hours, at which point they hatch. After hatching, the finless fry live off their yolk sack until it is completely absorbed, at which point they begin to eat small zooplankton.

It served the local neighborhood as a school until 1980, and was subsequently converted into condominiums. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Martin W. Carr School is located in Spring Hill, one of Somerville's oldest residential subdivisions, at the junction of Atherton and Beech Streets. Its lot extends northward to also abut Cleveland Street. It is a four-story H-shaped brick building, built in 1898 as an elementary school with fourteen classrooms. It was named in honor of Martin W.

The district includes four modest Greek Revival houses built c. 1850, an earlier Federal period house, and a late 19th century Second Empire house, representing a progression of housing styles through the 19th century. The houses at 8, 12, 16, and 20 Mount Vernon are all well conserved Greek Revival 1.5 story buildings with side hall layout, although #12 has had synthetic siding applied. The house at #16 has preserved more of its exterior detailing than the others, while #20 is distinctive for its use of flushboard siding, giving the house the appearance of ashlar masonry work. Behind the house at #12 is a second house that is some external Greek Revival styling, but has a five bay center entrance layout more typical of the Federal period; it is known to predate the house in front of it. The duplex at 22-24 Mount Vernon has a mansard roof characteristic of the Second Empire style; its construction date is estimated to be c. 1880. Mount Vernon Street was platted out in 1845, and was located near the railroad line which had been laid across the Charlestown Neck in 1835. The area, which had previously been largely rural, developed as a comparatively suburban area with ready access to Boston, and was one of the earliest parts of what became Somerville to be developed in this way.

Built in 1862‚Äì65 by the city of Charlestown (since annexed to Boston), it is a significant example of a mid-19th century waterworks facility. The building has been listed twice on the National Register of Historic Places. The first, in 1989, is part of the city of Somerville's listings, and was made under the name \\"Mystic Water Works\\". The second is part of an umbrella listing covering the entire historic water works system of Greater Boston, and was made in 1990, listed as the \\"Mystic Pumping Station\\". Description and history The Mystic Water Works is located on the south side of the Mystic Valley Parkway, just east of its junction with the Alewife Brook Parkway, and just east of the mouth of Alewife Brook where it empties into the Mystic River. It is a large 1-1/2 story building, built out of load- bearing brick in a Romanesque Revival style with a mansard roof. Its original main block is nine bays wide, with a two bay addition made in 1870 to the east, and a five bay addition to the west in 1895, both stylistically similar to the original. The building was built by the city of Charlestown as part of its initiative to dam the Mystic Lakes to provide it with water. Somerville was also allowed to tap into the lines, and the building thus became part of Somerville's first municipal water supply. When Charlestown became part of Boston in 1874 the building was taken over by that city's water authority, later known as the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC). When first built, it housed two steam-powered engines with a combined capability of moving 13 million gallons of water per day. The additions were built to provide space for addition pumps as the system was expanded to include Everett in 1870, and again in 1895. The facility was abandoned by the MDC in 1912, and its machinery scrapped. During World War I it housed offices, and in 1921 it was adapted for use as a machine shop. At the time of its listing on the National Register it was still in this use by the MDC. The building is now vacant, and belongs to the city of Somerville. In 2016, the city of Somerville began conversion of the property into affordable senior housing units, with the exterior to be restored and some interior features retained. The renovation was completed in November 2017.

The district encompasses the city's best-preserved residential subdivision from the mid-19th century, with later infill construction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Most development took place in the neighborhood between the 1840s and early 1900s. Spring Hill has a fine selection of Greek Revival houses and Victorians including Italianates, Gothic Revivals and Queen Annes. Large houses were built in the neighborhood as well as smaller workers' houses and attached houses. In the early 1900s triple-deckers filled in the remaining land. Description and history Spring Hill is a glacial drumlin with an elongated summit roughly north of Summer Street, between Lowell and Cedar Streets in central Somerville. Its name derives from a spring that was useful for farmers who originally settled the area in the 17th century. The construction of the Boston and Lowell Railroad in the 1840s, with a station at the base of the hill, spurred residential construction in the area for businessmen working in Charlestown and Boston. The tract of land making up this district was purchased by George Brastow, a native of Wrentham who later became Somerville's first mayor. Recognizing the potential for development, Brastow hired Alexander Wadsworth to lay out housing lots. The historic district is roughly L-shaped, and is bounded on the north by Summer Street, on the west by Spring Street, on the south by Atherton Street as far as Beech Street, on the east by Central Street (between Summer and Monmouth Streets) and Harvard Street (further south to Atherton). It includes 69 historically significant buildings, most of which were built during the area's first major period of development, 1845-1870. A second period of construction 1885-1910 resulted in the infill construction of additional buildings, including the 1898 Martin W. Carr School, the only non-residential building in the district. The oldest buildings in the district include seven of the first eight houses built after Brastow's subdivision; these are all Greek Revival two-family residences, of which 46-48 Atherton Street is the least altered. The Italianate Round House was built at Atherton and Beech Streets in 1856, and remains a local curiosity. Its builder, Enoch Robinson, also built the fine Italianate house at 47 Spring Street, which is one of the finest examples of that style in the city. Most of the buildings in the district are wood frame structures, with one to three housing units. Most were not architect designed; there is only one house, 152 Summer Street, that has been definitely attributed to an architect. In this case it was local architect George Loring, who is known to have designed more than 100 residences in the city, although only a few survive. The c. 1890 Rymes House at 49 Spring Street may also be a Loring design.

It was built in 1894 as offices and the printing facility for the Somerville Journal, a weekly publication that continues to exist as part of the \\"Wicked Local\\" franchise of GateHouse Media. The building, a somewhat typical example of late 19th-century commercial architecture, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Journal Building is set on the west side of Walnut Street, near its southern end in Union Square. It is a two-story brick structure, with a single storefront on the ground floor that has plate glass windows flanking a recessed entrance. The second story has six round-arch openings originally filled with sash windows, which were updated with double hung windows in 2012. A corbelled cornice is set below the roof, and a brownstone stringcourse separates the basement from the ground floor. thumb The Somerville Journal was founded in 1870, and had this building constructed in 1894 to house a new generation of printing equipment. Its styling is typical of other small commercial buildings built in Union Square, which was then the city's commercial business center. Administrative and editorial offices were on the first floor. Production and typesetting were on the second floor, and printing presses and equipment were located in the basement. The Somerville Journal vacated the building in approximately the 1950s. Through the 1960s, the building was used as a Kodak facility offering developing, printing, and enlarging. During the 1970s the building was used as a youth recreation center for the city of Somerville. It has been used as artist studios since the 1970s. It now houses a vintage retail store, in addition to studios.

He took part in most events of the Spanish conquest of Peru and wrote an extensive chronicle of them under the title Relaci√≥n del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Per√∫ (\\"Relation of the discovery and conquest of the kingdoms of Peru\\"), which he finished in 1571. Biography Pedro Pizarro was born around 1515 in the Spanish city of Toledo. Through his father he was first cousin of Francisco Pizarro and his half-brothers: Gonzalo Pizarro, Hernando Pizarro, Juan Pizarro and Mart√≠n de Alc√°ntara.Means, Introduction, p. 79. When Francisco left Spain for his third expedition to Peru he was joined by his brothers and his cousin Pedro. They sailed from Sanl√∫car de Barrameda in February 1530 and arrived at Tumbes in what is now Peru in January 1531.Means, Chronology, p. 122. Pedro initially served as page to his cousin Francisco but from about 1533 he was in active military service as a cavalryman.Means, Introduction, pp. 79, 97‚Äì98. As such he took part in most of the chief events of the conquest of the Inca empire, mainly during the campaigns against Manco Inca.Means, Introduction, p. 79‚Äì80. Pedro Pizarro fought at the Battle of Las Salinas (April 26, 1538) against Diego de Almagro, rival and former partner of Francisco Pizarro. He then took part in the foundation of the city of Arequipa (August 15, 1540) where he established himself. The almagristas revolted again in 1541, murdering Francisco Pizarro, so Pedro Pizarro fought them at the Battle of Chupas (September 16, 1542) under the command of Crist√≥bal Vaca de Castro.Means, Introduction, p. 80. When Gonzalo Pizarro revolted against the Spanish Crown, Pedro Pizarro refused his requests to join his rebellion. However, his loyalty was put in doubt for a letter he wrote to his cousin on December 18, 1546, which shows some vacillations in his loyalty probably prompted by material considerations. This letter fell into the hands of Pedro de la Gasca, an envoy sent by the Crown to pacify the country. La Gasca used the letter as an excuse to deny Pedro Pizarro the rewards he claimed after the Battle of Xaquixaguana (April 9, 1548) where Gonzalo Pizarro was defeated.Means, Introduction, pp. 80‚Äì81. Despite this rebuff, Pedro Pizarro could be considered a rich and well- rewarded man. On November 28, 1538, he had received from Francisco Pizarro lands and native workers in Arequipa, Tacna and other regions; he received further grants from time to time by various authorities.Means, Introduction, p. 81. When he was very young, he fathered a natural daughter, Isabel Pizarro; he later had numerous legitimate children. Pedro Pizarro married twice: his first wife was Mar√≠a Cornejo, but nothing is known about his second wife.Means, Introduction, pp. 81‚Äì82. The death date of Pedro Pizarro is not known. It happened after 1571 when he finished writing his chronicle and could have taken place as late as 1602 when viceroy Luis de Velasco, marqu√©s de Salinas made a grant to a Pedro Pizarro, however, this Pedro may have been a son of the chronicler.Means, Introduction, pp. 82‚Äì83. Pizarro's Relaci√≥n Based on his personal observation from 1531 to 1555, Pedro Pizarro wrote a chronicle of the Spanish conquest of Peru, which he completed in 1571 under the title Relaci√≥n del descubrimiento y conquista de los reinos del Per√∫ (\\"Relation of the discovery and conquest of the kingdoms of Peru\\"). The manuscript of Relaci√≥n that was at the National Library of Spain, however, been lost and the only remaining copy is located at The Huntington Library.Pease, Bibliography, p. 405.

The original raison d'√™tre for the newspaper was to create a vehicle to bridge the growing generation gap between Armenian- Americans since the 1920s. Thus, the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party (ADL) also commonly known as the Ramgavar Party determined at its 1931 convention to establish an English-language Armenian weekly as an organ to the party and to be called The Armenian Mirror alongside the Armenian-language daily newspaper and official organ Baikar that was being published since 1922. The Boston- based Armenian Mirror published in Watertown, Massachusetts was launched on July 1, 1932, with Elisha B. Chrakian as the founding editor. The Armenian Mirror was the first English language Armenian newspaper in the United States. The Spectator The Spectator was a New York-based English-language Armenian independent newspaper not affiliated with any Armenian political party. Founded in 1933, its editor in chief was John Tashjian.

This meant generally avoiding government troops, but he did achieve a major victory in the Yucat√°n.

Meagher, ed., Malone Society, Oxford University Press, 1965. are two closely related Elizabethan- era stage plays on the Robin Hood legend, that were written by Anthony Munday (possibly with help from Henry Chettle) in 1598 and published in 1601. They are among the relatively few surviving examples of the popular drama acted by the Admiral's Men during the Shakespearean era. Scholars and critics have studied the plays for their place in the evolution of the Robin Hood legend.Stephen Knight and Thomas Ohlgren, eds., Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales, Kalamazoo, MI, Medieval Institute / University of Rochester, 1997.David Wiles, The Early Plays of Robin Hood, Cambridge, D. S. Brewer, 1981. Munday has been credited as the first person to identify Robin Hood with the Earl of Huntingdon.Malcolm A. Nelson, \\"Look About You and the Robin Hood Tradition,\\" Notes and Queries Vol. 9 (1962), pp. 141-3.R. B. Dobson and J. Taylor, The Rhymes of Robin Hood: An Introduction to the English Outlaw, Stroud, Gloucestershire, Sutton Publishing, 1997; pp. 33, 44, 220-23. Publication Both plays were entered into the Stationers' Register on 1 December 1600, and were printed in separate quartos in the next year by stationer William Leake. The 1601 quartos were the only editions in the era of English Renaissance theatre; the plays would not be reprinted until the nineteenth century.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford University Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 446-7. Leake's 1601 quartos employ a blackletter or Gothic typeface for the speeches in the plays, with a Roman font used for stage directions and speech prefixes. Authorship The plays were originally published anonymously; the 1601 quartos lack any attribution of authorship on their title pages. The account book of theatrical manager Philip Henslowe (known as Henslowe's Diary) records a payment, dated 15 February 1598, to \\"Antony Monday\\" for \\"a playe booke called the firste parte of Robyne Hoode.\\" The Diary records subsequent payments to Munday on 20 and 28 February the same year for \\"the second pte of Roben Hoode.\\" Given the plays' general resemblances with Munday's earlier drama John a Kent and John a Cumber (c. 1594), scholars have had no problem in accepting Munday's authorship. Henslowe's Diary also records a payment, dated 25 February 1598, to Henry Chettle for \\"the second pte of Robart hoode.\\" Chettle was later (25 November 1598) paid for \\"mending\\" a Robin Hood play for a Court performance. Based on these facts, many scholars have assigned The Death to Munday and Chettle as collaborators. Comparing The Death to Munday's John a Kent on one hand and to Chettle's Hoffman on the other, some critics have considered Munday the likely author of the Robin Hood material in The Death, and Chettle the probable author of the story of King John's pursuit of Matilda Fitzwater. Yet John C. Meagher, editor of the Malone Society reprints of the plays, argues that the case for Chettle's participation in the play's authorship is weak.See Meagher's introduction to the Malone reprint of The Death, pp. viii-x. In his judgement, The Downfall is the work of Munday alone, and The Death is also \\"either primarily or exclusively the work of Munday.\\" \\"Foul papers\\" For both of the 1601 quartos, the texts were set into type from the author's working drafts or \\"foul papers\\" rather than from \\"fair copies\\" of the finished texts or from theatrical promptbooks. Both plays contain major discontinuities that would have been corrected in their final versions. * The most serious problem in The Downfall is the most obvious. The heroine is called Maid Marian for the first 781 lines of the play; then, suddenly and without explanation, she becomes Matilda. She should have been called Matilda from the start, since later in the play she deliberately changes her name to Marian, as a sign of the new identity she has adopted when joining Robin and his Merry Men. * The Death shows the same type of problems. Characters' names change for no reason. Lord Salisbury becomes Aubery de Vere, Earl of Oxford, and switches back and forth between the two identities. Similarly, Hugh becomes Mowbray. * In The Death, the character Bonville speaks two speeches before his entrance, and then disappears. All of these difficulties would have to have been resolved in the plays' finished texts. Genre This view of The Downfall and The Death as, to some significant degree, unfinished works in their existing texts, has a bearing on perceptions of the plays' artistic quality and their deficiencies. In Munday's Robin Hood plays, \\"Motivation is scanty, inner conflict is barely hinted at, and qualities are painted in with primary colors...not much attention is paid to cause and effect. Intrigues are begun and quickly forgotten, important episodes seem to be omitted completely, and diversions frequently have precedence over any logical sequence of events.\\"J. M. R. Margeson, \\"Dramatic Form: The Huntington Plays,\\" Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900, Vol. 14 No. 2 (Spring 1974), pp. 223-38; see p. 223. Some of these problems could have been remedied or at least palliated in the final versions. Yet some of these traits are inherent in the dramatic form and genre in which Munday worked.John C. Meagher, \\"Hackwriting and the Huntington Plays,\\" Elizabethan Theatre, John Russell Brown and Bernard Harris, eds.; Shakespeare-upon-Avon Studies Vol. 9, London, Arnold, 1966; pp. 197-219. The plays \\"have been strongly criticized as unsatisfactory mixtures of folk tale, melodrama, and farce,\\" when they should be considered as \\"primarily romances\\" -- \\"not chronicle plays nor pastoral comedy mixed with tragedy of blood....\\"Margeson, p. 223. As romances, comparable to the romances of Robert Greene and to Shakespeare's late plays, the Munday works show more sense and coherence. To a substantial degree, the two works form a single whole, a \\"two- part play.\\" Like other works of this type, Munday's double play employs a dichotomy of dramatic forms: the first part moves \\"in a comic direction,\\" or \\"at least toward reconciliation,\\" while the second bends \\"in a tragic direction.\\"Margeson, p. 233. Other plays The story of Robin Hood was integral to English folklore, and Munday was far from the first or only dramatist of his time to exploit it. The most prominent Robin Hood play of Munday's era was George a Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield, registered in 1595 and printed in 1599. This anonymous work has often been attributed to Robert Greene.Chambers, Vol. 4, pp. 14-15. The anonymous Look About You (1599?; printed 1600) also features Robin Hood; one researcher has ascribed it to Munday, or Chettle, or both.Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The Popular School: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1975; p. 170. An early Robin Hood play, author unknown, was printed in 1560. An anonymous Robin Hood and Little John (1594) has not survived. William Haughton worked on a Robin Hood's Pennyworths around 1600, but apparently left it unfinished.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 178; Vol. 4, pp. 44 and 402. In turn, Robert Davenport based his later play King John and Matilda (published 1655) securely on The Death. Some critics have called Davenport's play a mere rewriting of Munday's. During the Restoration, a drama titled Robin Hood and His Crew of Soldiers was acted at Nottingham on the day of King Charles II's coronation. Admiral's drama In Shakespeare's generation, the Admiral's Men were the primary competitors with Shakespeare's company, the Lord Chamberlain's/King's Men. In the years from 1594 to 1602, the two companies were the only ones allowed permanent residence in London. The Admiral's Men performed two early works by George Chapman, and Thomas Middleton's The Roaring Girl; most of their plays, though, were written by a coterie of house playwrights, regularly employed by manager Henslowe. These writers sometimes collaborated in teams of three, four, or even five per play. Henslowe's Diary preserves the titles of dozens of plays written by Chettle, Haughton, Thomas Dekker, John Day, Michael Drayton, Richard Hathwaye, and others. A huge body of this work has disappeared, lost to history;Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 288-9, 300-4, 307-8, 333-6, 493-4, 516-17. out of the thirty plays Henslowe ordered from his house dramatists in 1598, only Munday's Huntington plays survive. Along with a few other survivors, like Sir John Oldcastle or Haughton's Englishmen for My Money, they illustrate what a whole style of drama was like.

He is portrayed by Peter Jacobson. He becomes a member of House's new diagnostic team in the Season 4 episode titled \\"Games\\". Professional life Taub is a plastic surgeon and was #39 during the \\"games\\" used by House to select his new team. House almost fired Taub (and the row he was sitting in) on the first day of the games, but Taub was saved when House changed his mind after noticing an attractive woman in the group. He also reveals himself as the most willing of the applicants to challenge House's authority, even telling a patient's father that he thinks House is wrong and can have him removed from the case (\\"Ugly\\"). Cuddy later favors Taub as one of her two choices for the team, arguing that his knowledge and combative nature would keep House focused (it is later revealed that she had chosen Taub and Kutner, the two male applicants, because she suspected that House would defy her suggestion and choose at least one female candidate.) In the sixth season Taub quit PPTH and returned to his plastic surgery practice during the brief period Foreman led the diagnostics team after House's departure in the episode \\"Epic Fail\\", saying he had only joined the team \\"to work with House.\\" When House returned to PPTH in the episode \\"Teamwork\\", House brought Taub back into the team along with Thirteen, Chase and Foreman. In the episode \\"Lockdown,\\" it is revealed that Taub has an outstanding educational and early professional profile. He also expressed frustration that he has not continued the same level of success in his current professional career and is now working for people of a younger age. Taub interviewed Masters for medical school. Personal life Taub is married to Rachel, and although he genuinely loves his wife, he has been unfaithful to her. He had a successful career in cosmetic surgery, but that ended after having an affair with a partner's daughter or a nurse, based on different versions of his story. When asked why he gave up his chosen practice completely, he simply says, \\"I love my wife.\\" His partners signed a non- disclosure agreement (with respect to his affair) and Taub signed a non- compete, meaning he could no longer practice cosmetic surgery. In spite of this, he has shown indicators for future adultery, admitting to House, \\"Some people pop pills. I cheat. We all have our vices.\\" (It has been confirmed in \\"Open and Shut\\", where Taub proceeds to cheat with the young nurse although the \\"affair circle\\" seems to have ended.) In the episode \\"Mirror Mirror\\", the patient with a rare type of Mirror syndrome (which causes him to take on the persona of someone in the room with him), sees that he is attracted to Amber Volakis' dominant personality, and the two share a flirtatiously combative dialogue. In the episode \\"Whatever It Takes\\", Taub reveals that he is Jewish,jweekly.com though it is revealed in \\"Don't Ever Change\\" that he describes himself as a non-practicing. This is supported by the fact that House often alludes to Taub's religion, e.g. giving him a \\"Gold Star of David\\" for identifying intracranial pressure in a patient. In the episode \\"Adverse Events\\", Lucas, House's PI, finds out that Taub's wife Rachel opened a secret bank account. House tells Taub that she's put $83,000 in it. When Taub confronts her about it, she tells him she's been saving up to buy him the car he wanted as a surprise because she knew he'd never buy it himself. When she finally gives him the car he apparently decides to tell her he cheated on her, but the conversation isn't shown in the episode. In the \\"Birthmarks\\" episode, he claims to have told her, and indicates that she has not thrown him out, and that they are talking about how to handle their situation. In the episode \\"The Itch\\", it is revealed that he had been sleeping on the couch, and by the end of the episode his wife had finally forgiven him. In the 100th episode, \\"The Greater Good\\", Taub mentions wanting to possibly have children, although his wife seems opposed to the idea. In \\"Painless\\", he states his opinion that suicide is never a solution. Kutner questions him, convinced that anyone so thoroughly opposed to it must carry some sort of baggage associated with it. Taub later tells Kutner that a colleague of his once attempted suicide and though he survived, his family and friends were deeply disturbed. When Kutner asks if it was in fact Taub who attempted suicide, Taub denies it; however, when House assumes the same thing in \\"Simple Explanation\\", he does not. After Kutner's suicide, Taub is angry and withdrawn, focusing intently on their current patient even when Chase confronts him about it, telling him to \\"go home and cry\\". He does not attend Kutner's funeral, but rather stays to watch over the team's patient. Later, however, he is seen weeping on a bench in the hallway. House states that Taub is 45 years old in \\"You Must Remember This\\". In \\"Bombshells\\", the insight with which he deduces a patient is suffering from a major depressive disorder leads the patient to suspect that Taub, too, suffered from depression, which he does not deny, and Taub admits to having \\"hurt\\" himself in that time of his life. In \\"Larger than Life\\", Taub decides to divorce Rachel because she had turned to an online relationship for comfort and no longer loved him the way she used to. Taub consequently moves in with Foreman following a stint living in a hotel room. In \\"Here Kitty\\", Taub is revealed to have attended the Collegiate School for high school. In the same episode, he meets with an old classmate from there who, unbeknownst to Taub, was a con artist posing as the CEO of a medical technology firm. Taub was very nearly duped into investing a significant sum of his savings in the company through his friend, and was only prevented from doing so when a sympathetic secretary at the company told him that his friend had been arrested, and was merely a temp., instead of the CEO as he had led Taub to believe. Taub begins a brief relationship with a CNA who works at the hospital after his failed marriage with Rachel. However, it is revealed in \\"After Hours\\" that Taub is still seeing his wife for brief promiscuous encounters. Also in \\"After Hours\\" it is revealed that Taub's new tryst Ruby has become pregnant, and Taub breaks down and goes to a strip club with Foreman. Taub assumes he will be a horrible father and, after almost being shot by a dancer from the club he attended (whom Taub unwittingly fondled and later was checking the dancer's mole if the same is malignant or not), he decided to confront Ruby about the matter of whether or not to keep their baby. Taub references a patient he had during his plastic surgery career who accepted death without fear due to having children, and tells Ruby he wants to keep the baby. In the final episode of season 7 \\"Moving On\\" Taub's (ex) wife Rachel confronts him at the hospital, and tells him that she is also pregnant. At the end of season 7 it is unclear whether or not either of the women who are pregnant with Taub's baby know, or will know, about the other. In the season 8 episode \\"The Confession\\", it is revealed that both of Taub's children are girls, one named Sophie and the other named Sophia.

Utilising a 2-4-0 wheel arrangement to allow greater traction on the heavily graded new lines to Ballarat and Echuca rather than the 2-2-2 arrangement previously selected for VR's Geelong line, these highly successful passenger locomotives are regarded as the first mainline VR locomotives. History The recently formed Victorian Railways, having purchased the struggling Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company in 1856 and, more recently, the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company's line to Geelong in 1860, had begun the construction of two new mainlines to connect the booming gold-mining towns of Ballarat, Castlemaine and Sandhurst, as well as to tap the lucrative Murray River trade at Echuca. These ambitious new railway projects, despite being engineered to very high (and very expensive) standards, traversed some difficult terrain and featured numerous gradients of up to 1 in 50. The 2-2-2 passenger locomotives the VR had used to operate its relatively flat Geelong line proved to be unsuitable for heavy grades,Cave et al., p. 37 and the VR fleet was already stretched in servicing the needs of its rapidly expanding network. New locomotives were ordered from R and W Hawthorn in Newcastle upon Tyne, England in February 1861, with a layout very similar to that of a successful 2-4-0 design previously built for the Great Northern Railway in England, but with modifications such as the fitting of cabs and steam domes. Production The initial order of seven 2-4-0 locomotives was followed by another order of seven of the same type from Beyer, Peacock and Company in April 1862, and there were two further orders of six locomotives from each manufacturer in October and the following January. None of the locomotives had arrived in time for the opening of the Geelong to Ballarat line in April 1862, and passenger services on the line had to be worked by suburban saddle tank locomotives (later designated as L class) until the arrival of the first of the new mainline locomotives in July 1862.Cave, et al., p. 38 The success of the 2-4-0 mainline locomotives was such that, despite ongoing advances in locomotive technology, the design continued to be built. A further order of six locomotives was placed with Beyer Peacock in 1871, and a two were built by the Phoenix Foundry of Ballarat in 1880.Cave, et al., p. 39 The locomotives were initially unclassed, and were part of the initial numbering scheme, in which odd numbers were used for goods locomotives and even numbers for passenger locomotives, before being denoted as \\"B class\\" under the railways' 1889 reclassification. By that time, a new 4-4-0 express passenger locomotive had been introduced, which took the \\"A class\\" designation. Design features The B-class locomotives were easily recognisable by their use of external frames and bearings, and coupling rods mounted outside the frames, earning them the nickname \\"overarmers\\". They featured an unusual design of firebox, which had two separate chambers, each with its own firedoor, divided by a water space that effectively acted as a thermic syphon, and joined at the tubeplate. The two fireboxes were designed to be worked separately, with one fire being built while the other was burning. That configuration was designed to extract the maximum heat from the wood fuels the VR used in its early years. However, the last two locomotives, built in the 1880s, had a conventional single firebox. Service Life The Sydney Express circa 1900, with a New A-class locomotive leading a B-class locomotive The B class's initial duties, hauling passenger services on the new mainlines, expanded as the mainline network grew. B 88 had the honour of leading the first VR train to Albury on 14 June 1883. B 50 was selected to haul the first Victorian Railways Royal Train in 1867, taking Prince Alfred Duke of Edinburgh to Ballarat, Bendigo and Castlemaine. The Royal Train was recorded running the between Melbourne and Geelong in as little as 52 minutes. By 1894, the VR's Rolling Stock Branch Diagram Book noted the allocation of B-class locomotives around the state, with two at Stawell, six at Melbourne, five at Bendigo, three at Geelong, six at Ballarat, four at Benalla, and three at Seymour.Cave, et al., p. 49 While the B-class locomotives were highly successful on the expensively engineered 1860s mainlines for which they were designed, they were less suited for the more cheaply built extensions to the VR system.Cave et al., p. 118 Future VR express passenger locomotives were to use a four-wheel leading bogie to steer the locomotive, and from 1884, a class of 4-4-0 locomotives (later classed 'Old A') began to supplement, and eventually supersede the B class. Despite the delivery of the Old A, and the later and increasingly larger 'New A' and AA class 4-4-0s of 1889 and 1900 respectively, the entire B class (other than a couple of accident write-offs) lasted into the 20th century, with their roles ranging from double heading on express passenger trains to shunting duties. Design improvements Given their long life and the considerable technological development of railways during that period, the B-class locomotives saw a number of improvements. As delivered, the only means of braking them was by operating a handbrake on the tender wheels. B 50 and B 108 were used in comparative trials of the Woods hydraulic and Westinghouse air brake systems in January 1884, leading to the Westinghouse system being adopted as the standard. During the 1880s, the boiler pressure of the locomotives was increased from to , and their cylinder bore was increased from , with those rebuilt after 1896 being fitted with cylinders.Cave, et al., p. 45 Those changes led to considerably increased tractive effort. The large spark-arresting chimneys originally fitted were replaced by a straight chimney, with a conical spark arrestor being located in the smokebox. The cab was also redesigned to provide greater amenity to the crew. The original sheet metal structure, prone to vibration at speed, was replaced by one of wood, and a double roof was employed for greater comfort in Australian weather conditions. Accidents B 82 and B 92 were wrecked beyond repair in a head-on collision on the Geelong line between Little River and Werribee on 2 April 1884. On 18 August of the same year, B 72's boiler exploded at Warrenheip, although that locomotive was repaired and returned to service.Cave, et al., p. 50 B 110 was involved in a spectacular mishap on 13 April 1904 when it pushed a rake of coal wagons off the end of the coal stage at Seymour and was left suspended by its tender, resting on the wreckage of the wagons below. Withdrawal and scrapping Other than accident write- offs, the entire class lasted until 1904, when ten were withdrawn, many of which were over forty years old by that stage. Over the next ten years, the remainder of the class was gradually retired as mechanical condition dictated, to the point where just two locomotives, B 56 and B 76, remained on the register. Those last two members of the class served out their final days shunting carriages at Spencer Street Station and North Melbourne yards, and were withdrawn for scrapping in May and June 1917. None were preserved.

Harburg. It has additional background music by Herbert Stothart. It is based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum and the 1939 film version written by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf. Successful musicals based on the Baum novel were created in 1902 (for Broadway) and 1942 (for St. Louis Municipal Opera), the latter of which, using songs from the popular 1939 film, is still frequently revived. Seeking to more closely recreate the 1939 film on stage, the Royal Shakespeare Company adapted the film's screenplay, also using the songs from the film, and produced a new version at London's Barbican Centre in 1987. This was also a success and has been given many revivals in various formats. This musical has been touring the U.S. since 2008. It has become a popular musical for community theatres, schools and children's theatres in the United States and the United Kingdom.  History  The Wizard of Oz was first turned into a musical extravaganza by L. Frank Baum himself. A loose adaptation of Baum's 1900 novel (there is no Wicked Witch or Toto, and there are some new characters), it first played in Chicago in 1902 and was a success on Broadway the following year. It then toured for seven years.Swartz, p. 146 The 1939 film adaptation bore a closer resemblance to the storyline of Baum's original novel than most previous versions. It was a strong success, won the Academy Awards for best song and best score, and has been frequently broadcast on television. This was followed, in 1942, by a musical theatre adaptation presented at the St. Louis Municipal Opera (MUNY). The script was adapted by Frank Gabrielson from the novel, but it is influenced in some respects by the motion picture script and uses most of the songs from the film. A new song was added for Dorothy to sing in the Emerald City, called \\"Evening Star\\", and the Wizard goes home in a rocketship instead of a hot air balloon. The MUNY version continues to receive frequent revivals. According to Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) director Ian Judge, the company's 1987 adaptation \\"came about when Terry Hands, artistic director of the company, asked for a show that could be performed annually over the Christmas season, as a revival of J. M. Barrie's play Peter Pan had been previously. ... Judge obtained the rights to the [1939] film. ... An additional verse has been put back into the Academy Award-winning song 'Over the Rainbow,' as well as an entire number, 'The Jitterbug,' that was cut from the movie. Every word of the screenplay has been left in. 'We've just fattened it out a little bit because you need a few more words in the theater than you need in the movies.'\\"Wolf, Matt. \\"Toto Meets the Bard\\", The Associated Press, December 14, 1987 (no page number) In 1986, John Kane was asked by the company to write the book for the adaptation.Swartz, p. 257 This hews even more closely to the film's screenplay than the 1942 MUNY version and attempts to recreate the film's atmosphere and some of its special effects. Synopsis ;Act One A young girl, Dorothy Gale, lives on a farm in Kansas with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry and little dog, Toto. Feeling unappreciated, she dreams of a far away place (\\"Over the Rainbow\\"). Miss Gulch, their unpleasant neighbor, serves Dorothy with a summons to take Toto away. He escapes from her bicycle basket, and Dorothy runs away from home with him. On the road, they find a showman, Professor Marvel, who urges her to return to the farm. Dorothy arrives home just as a tornado touches down. She and Toto are locked out of the storm cellar. In her house, she is accidentally hit on the head by a window. The house is carried by the tornado to the Land of Oz. Dorothy meets the Munchkins and Glinda, the Good Witch of the North (who resembles Aunt Em). Her house has fallen upon, and killed, the Wicked Witch of the East. This frees the Munchkins from her power, and they treat Dorothy as their heroine (\\"Come Out, Come Out\\"; \\"Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\"). The Wicked Witch of the West (who resembles Miss Gulch) arrives to claim her sister's magic ruby slippers and vows to avenge her death. Glinda has already put the slippers on Dorothy's feet, further infuriating the witch. Dorothy wants to go home to Kansas. The Munchkins tell her that the Wizard of Oz will know what to do (\\"Follow the Yellow Brick Road\\"). She starts off towards the Emerald City. Dorothy and Toto meet three strange traveling companions, each of whom needs help: The Scarecrow's head is full of straw (\\"If I Only Had a Brain\\"). The rusty Tin Man's chest is empty (\\"If I Only Had a Heart\\") and the Cowardly Lion is afraid of his own tail (\\"If I Only Had the Nerve\\"). Dorothy invites them all to join her to see if the Wizard can help them (\\"We're Off to See the Wizard\\"). The Wicked Witch of the West threatens them along the way but fails to intimidate Dorothy into giving up the ruby slippers. She creates a beautiful field of poppies, but their scent is poisonous. Glinda rescues the travelers by covering the poppies with snowflakes (\\"Optimistic Voices\\"). They then finally reach the Emerald City. ;Act Two The Emerald City's Gatekeeper tries to discourage the travelers, but they are persistent and gain entry (\\"The Merry Old Land of Oz\\"). They are washed, combed and buffed, but the Wizard refuses to meet them. The Wicked Witch makes another ominous appearance, and the Lion wishes more than ever for courage (\\"If I Were King of the Forest\\"). Finally taken to see the fearsome Wizard, the four friends are given a quest to prove themselves worthy of his assistance: they must bring him the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West, and the only way to do that would be to kill her. The friends leave in fear and haste for the land of the Winkies (whom the Wicked Witch has enslaved and forced to serve in her army) and her castle (\\"March of the Winkies\\"). In a haunted forest, the jitterbugs make the travelers dance until they all collapse from exhaustion (\\"The Jitterbug\\"). The Wicked Witch's winged monkeys then attack, swooping away with Dorothy and Toto. The witch still does not have the power to take the ruby slippers off of Dorothy's feet (\\"Over the Rainbow\\" (reprise)). Toto manages to escape and help the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion to find her. They disguise themselves in Winkie uniforms and sneak into the castle. They find her, but the Wicked Witch foils their escape. She attacks the Scarecrow with fire, and Dorothy throws a bucket of water at him, accidentally dousing the witch, causing her to melt into nothing (\\"Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\" (reprise)). The friends take her broom back to the Emerald City. The Wizard is again reluctant to meet Dorothy and friends. Toto pulls aside the curtain behind which the Wizard is revealed as an ordinary man (who resembles Professor Marvel) using a microphone to make his voice impressive. Nevertheless, he is able to help the travelers. He conducts a graduation exercise, awarding the Scarecrow a doctorate of Thinkology, appoints the Lion as a member of the Legion of Courage, and presents the Tin Man with a heart- shaped ticker ‚Äì a watch. Finally, he reveals that he is from the prairies himself and offers to give Dorothy a ride back to Kansas in the hot-air balloon that brought him to Oz. It takes off while she is distracted, and she is afraid that she missed her chance to go home, but Glinda arrives. She says that Dorothy has the power all along to transport herself and Toto by clicking her heels together three times and repeating \\"There's no place like home\\". Dorothy wakes up in Kansas with a bump on her head. The tornado has passed. Miss Gulch broke her leg when the storm blew down a telegraph pole ‚Äì she won't be riding her bicycle any time soon. Dorothy is overjoyed to see her family and friends, whom she appreciates more than ever.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. History In 1855, William Berkey arrived in Grand Rapids and founded a mill to manufacture window sashes and other wood building products. He was joined by his brother, Julius, who later began manufacturing what became known as the \\"Berkey Table.\\" This was highly successful, and soon the Berkey brothers were concentrating on making furniture. The company took on various partners over time, including George W. Gay, who bought an interest in the company in 1866 to form \\"Berkey Bros and Gay.\\" In 1873, William Berkey withdrew from the company, and Julius Berkey and George W. Gay incorporated to form the Berkey & Gay Furniture Company. In 1874, the new company opened their six-story factory, complete with wholesale and retail showrooms, in Grand Rapids. By 1882, this factory covered three city blocks. The company is known for making Victorian furniture. George W. Gay, although continuing to be involved with Berkey & Gay, also struck out on his own business ventures. One of these was the Oriel Cabinet Company, which he established in 1880. Oriel Cabinet constructed a factory at this site in the 1880s, but the original factory was destroyed by fire in 1890. In 1892, the company constructed a new factory, which continues to occupy the site. Both Oriel Cabinet and Berkey & Gay continued independently until 1911, when the two companies merged. The Oriel factory became Berkey & Gay's Plant No. 1 following the merger, and an addition was immediately made to the plant in 1912. In 1919 the company further expanded the factory 240 feet north along Monroe Avenue. In 1920, the company merged with the Wallace Furniture Company and the Grand Rapids Upholstery Company to form Consolidated Furniture Companies, but continued to use the trademark \\"Berkey & Gay\\" because of its name recognition. Sales increased in the 1920s and the company aggressively expanded, However, when the Great Depression hit, the company was unable to continue financing their new sites, and was forced to sell to the Chicago- based Simmons Company. Even this was not enough, as Simmons declared bankruptcy in 1931, and the Grand Rapids factories closed their doors. Local stockholders reopened the factory in 1935, and continued production until World War II, when it was converted to wartime needs. After the war, an attempt was made to convert back to furniture production, but the company was again forced to declare bankruptcy in 1948 and closing the factory for good. Since the closing of factory operations, the Berkey & Gay Furniture Company Factory was used for a variety of smaller tenants, ranging from small manufacturers to artists. By 2000, the building underwent rehabilitation to create residential apartments and retail commercial space. Description The Berkey & Gay Furniture Company Factory is a massive, five-story, flat- roofed, cream brick building. It is basically rectilinear, with two open interior courtyards. The plant consists of three sections. The oldest section, constructed in 1892 by the Oriel Cabinet Company, is a U-shape building which now forms the southernmost part of the factory. The second section, constructed in 1912 after the merger, is an east side addition which enclosed the U-shape of the original building to create what is now the south courtyard. The third section was build in 1921, and is a U-shaped addition on the north side, which created a second courtyard and nearly doubled the area of the building. On the main facade, three groups of three large, two-story round arch openings are located at the street level: one grouping in the center of the facade and one at each end. The arches are formed with rusticated stonework , reminiscent of Richardsonian Romanesque style. Above the arches are paired windows on each of the upper four levels.

The News  History  The zoo was established in 1963, along with the National Zoo of Malaysia (Zoo Negara), but its management was later taken over by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks of Malaysia in 1979. This enhanced its operations and upgraded its services for the public's benefit. It was used as a wildlife rescue base before it was opened to the public by the then Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohammad on 13 August 1987. Although it has long been opened to the public, its primary roles as a rescue base and an animal sanctuary remain unchanged.Kelantan --The Star A gharial mission --The Star Crocodile capture The Star It now houses many birds, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, insects, and is the second largest zoo behind the National Zoo in Ulu Klang.  The zoo  Malacca Zoo was the first zoo in Malaysia to exhibit the critically endangered Sumatran rhinoceros. It also houses overseas as well as local beauties such as the white rhinoceros, Asian elephants, red panda, Malaysian gaur, the serow, the squirrel monkey, the molurus python, the grey wolf, the Mongolian wild horse, the green tree python, the giraffe, the blue-and-yellow macaw and also the Indochinese tiger as well as the Malayan tigerList of mammals --Mammals.

Now, it is visited annually by 400,000 visitors; averaging 1093 visitors a day.Malacca Zoo at Tourism Malaysia --Malacca Zoo Zoo Although, in 2007, the zoo was visited by 619,194 visitors with an average of 1619 visitors per day; the highest number since it was opened. In that year, the zoo collected as much as RM 3.99 million (US$886,666); collecting a gain of RM 130,000. It also maintains a healthy, cool green background by planting exotic and rare plants while labelling them. This can potentially cool the zoo in very hot days and symbolically mimics the rainforest. It also has a tram facility to help its visitors get from one place to another with the ticket prices as low as RM 2.00. In addition to that, it also has eating facilities at the A&W; restaurant and a cafeteria near the watch tower at the Mini Safari located near Marina Zenorai.  Breeding plans  The zoo is planning some programmes to ensure the survival of some endangered species. Some of them are captive breeding. Since the Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris jacksoni) was found as a tiger sub-species, the zoo had raised over 40 tiger cubs and sent them to various types of places such as the United States. Two of them were Mek Degong and its mate Awang Relak; Malayan tigers that were sent to San Diego Zoo in 2004.Mek Degong's profile at San Diego Zoo homepage. ‚Äì Mek Degong Retrieved on 10 August 2008Awang Relak's surgery News Archive Besides that, it has also been used as a captured animal sanctuary for a temporary time until it is sent locally or abroad.

Increased emotional responsivity refers to demonstrating more response to a stimulus. Reduced emotional responsivity refers to demonstrating less response to a stimulus. Any response exhibited after exposure to the stimulus, whether it is appropriate or not, would be considered as an emotional response. Although emotional responsivity applies to nonclinical populations, it is more typically associated with individuals with schizophrenia and autism. Emotional responsivity is connected to broader psychology concepts about emotions. People exhibit emotions in response to outside stimuli. Positive affective stimuli trigger feelings of pleasure such as happiness; negative affective stimuli trigger feelings of displeasure such as disgust and fear. Emotional responses include but are not limited to facial expressions and neurophysiological activities. For example, people display a ‚Äúsmile‚Äù when exposed to positive stimuli and a ‚Äúfrown‚Äù when exposed to negative stimuli. The feeling associated with emotion is called an affect, which can be categorized by valence and arousal. Valence describes the degree to which the feeling is a pleasure or displeasure. Arousal describes the degree to which a person is awoken by outside stimuli.  Experimental measures  Clinical studies of emotional responsivity involve two essential procedures. First, the researchers try to stimulate emotions from the participants by engaging participants in specific tasks. Then, the researchers measure the degree to which the participants respond to the stimuli. Tasks used to stimulate emotional responses include: * Picture stimuli: this task involves showing participants pleasant or unpleasant pictures and ask participants to rate the arousal and valence level of the picture. A pleasant picture could depict opposite-sex erotica; an unpleasant picture could be a burned human body. The International Affective Picture System is a photo database that generates pictures designed to arouse specific emotions. * Film clips: this task asks participants to view film clips that arouse different emotions. For example, comedies‚Äô clips trigger potential feelings of joy. Neutral clips such as scenes of rainforests usually are included to serve as a control. * Experimenter distress: this task involves the experimenter to stimulate emotions from participants by acting scenarios of distress. For example, the experimenter bans his or her knee and display expressions of pain . * Facial stimuli: this task involves asking a participant to view pictures of human faces that display different facial expressions. Participants would then be asked to rate their emotional experience. The facial expression would be considered as the affective stimuli. * Yummy-yucky: in this task, a child is asked to eat a certain food that was chosen by his or her parent. An experimenter then tastes the chosen food and displays either pleased or disgusted facial expression . * Surprise box: this task intends to stimulate an emotional response by opening a box in front of a participant, usually a child, and displaying either an ‚Äúamazed‚Äù reaction by saying ‚Äúohh‚Äù or a ‚Äúfrightened‚Äù reaction by saying ‚Äúahh‚Äù. After exposing participants to affective stimuli, researchers typically use the following methods to measure, record, and sometimes code emotional responsivity: * Skin conductance (electrodermal activity): Skin conductivity indicates emotional arousal because increased sweat production by certain emotions increases the skin conductivity level. * fMRI: this technology generates neuro-images of brain activities. fMRI can detect neurophysiological changes in the brain and thereby help determine the degree to which a person is aroused by the stimulus. For example, increased amygdala activity can be an indication of fear. * Facial Action Coding System (FACS): this method uses the taxonomy of the face to measure movements of facial muscles. For example, the contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle is an indication of happiness. * Maximally Discriminative Facial Movement Coding System: this system is mostly used to measure the emotional responsivity of young children by corresponding universally recognized facial expressions to emotions. For example, lowering eyebrows indicates emotions of anger. * Self-report: this method asks the participants to rate their valence and arousal level through questionnaires such as the Emotionally Expressivity Scales and the Berkley Expressivity Questionnaire. Studies have shown that self-report might not correspond to objective measures such as fMRI.  Emotional responsivity in mental illness   Autism  Autism is associated with decreased emotional responsivity. There was a study involving twenty-six children with autism and fifteen children with other learning disabilities, in which an adult displayed some form of emotion to study how the children respond. They focused on attention, hedonic tone, latency to changes in tone and an emotional contagion summery was made. Studies show correlations between measures of joint attention, emotional contagion, and the severity of autism. Results demonstrate that children with autism did not demonstrate changes in affect; however, their responses occurred much less than in comparison groups. In another study involving twenty-one autism patients, FACS analysis demonstrates that people with autism display less facial responsivity when watching evocative films. Specifically, when compared to the control group, the autism group does not demonstrate the more complex muscular movements and displayed less differentiated facial responses when exposed to stimuli. This study confirms that autism impedes social interaction and cognition.  Schizophrenia  Schizophrenia impacts emotional responsivity by reducing a person‚Äôs hedonic capacity and producing a blunted affect. Patients usually have an increased emotional response to displeasure and a decreased emotional response to pleasure. A study involving 22 outpatients demonstrates that schizophrenia increases the emotional responsivity to low arousing negative stimuli while decreases the emotional responsivity to high arousing positive stimuli. People with Schizophrenia exhibit fewer facial expressions when watching evocative films. There are differences in the arousal level of stimuli between paranoid and non-paranoid schizophrenia. Non-paranoid patients have increased negative emotional responsitivity and decreased positive emotional disregarding arousal levels. In comparison, paranoid schizophrenia has increased emotional responsivity to low arousing stimuli and reduced responsivity to high arousing stimuli. This study supports that Schizophrenia disturbs emotional experience.  Traumatic brain injury (TBI)  Traumatic brain injury is associated with reduced responsivity to negative affective stimuli. A study involving twenty- one TBI individuals uses picture stimuli to demonstrate that people TBI have normal emotional responsivity to pleasant pictures but show limited responses to unpleasant pictures. A potential explanation is that TBI damages the ventral surfaces of the frontal and temporal lobes, which are areas associated with emotional processing.  Math anxiety  Math anxiety describes the situation in which a person is overly distressed by math stimuli. A study involving fMRI techniques and 40 students demonstrates that people with math anxiety have increased emotional responsivity to math stimuli. The study suggests that when exposed to math-related stimuli, amygdala activity increases in participants' brain, which lowers the threshold of responding to a potential threat. Moreover, participants with math anxiety disengage and avoid the math stimuli more than images with negative valence such as a bleeding arm. The study suggests that math anxiety resembles other types of phobia in that there is increased vigilance and responsivity to specific stimuli.  Emotional responsivity in substance-use   Cocaine-exposed infants  Using cocaine during pregnancy creates neurological damage to the fetus and neurobehavioral problems to the infants. 72 infants participated in a study where 36 infants have prenatal exposure to cocaine. The results demonstrate that compared to the control group, cocaine-exposed infants have decreased emotional responsivity, as they exhibit fewer expressions of joy, interest, surprise, anger, and sadness. Specifically, the cocaine-exposed group has reduced response to positive affective stimuli, suggesting that cocaine-exposure during pregnancy decreases feelings of joyfulness.  Alcoholism:  Alcohol consumption impairs affective processing and therefore leads to abnormal responses to environmental stimuli. A study involving 42 abstinent alcoholics and 46 nonalcoholic demonstrates that alcoholics usually have lower emotional responsivity to erotic, happy, aversive, and gruesome stimuli. However, an in-depth analysis of fMRI images reveals gender differences. Alcoholic men have reduced emotional responsivity while alcoholic women have increased emotional responsivity to positive affective stimuli. The study suggests that the gender difference is associated with different functional abnormalities of emotional processing in the cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions of the brain.  Emotional responsivity in social factors   Social interaction  Emotional responsivity is said to have a unique association with social interaction. Studies suggest that social interaction, especially at home, can influence the way a child responds to emotional stimuli. For example, if child grew up in a home where emotional displays resulted in punishment or negative criticism, the child would have the tendency to find ways to hide their emotions.  Sleep Deprivation  Sleeping issues in children have been linked to many physical and mental health problems later on in adulthood and created a greater risk for emotional and behavioral issues in children. Studies haven't been able to link the physiological functions with sleeping disturbances to these psychological consequences. Emotional liability, responsivity, psychological responses to positive and negative picture stimuli have all been a result of sleep deprivation. Doctors today are using neuroimaging to connect the relationship between sleep and neural mechanisms that cause emotional responsively in children. These studies resulted, \\"In general, the largest and most extensive sleep-related correlations for any emotion were found for disgust expressions\\".  Treatment:  Current research suggests that future studies are required to find potential treatments of people with reduced or heightened emotional responsivity.

As part of the presentations, the NBT coordinated many literary programmes, including seminars, discussions, reading sessions, and authors‚Äô presentations. In addition, a special exhibit of books from India was also put up. Promotion of Children's Literature The National Center for Children‚Äôs Literature (NCCL) was established by the NBT in 1993 to monitor, coordinate, plan and aid the publication of children‚Äôs literature in various Indian languages. The NCCL is engaged in organizing workshops, exhibitions and promoting the habit of reading at the school level by encouraging the setting up of Readers‚Äô Clubs. Till date over 33,000 (approx.) Readers‚Äô Clubs have been established across various schools in the country. The Center is mandated to conduct surveys and research work related to children‚Äôs literature. It also publishes a quarterly bilingual magazine ‚ÄòReader‚Äôs Club Bulletin‚Äô for children. The NCCL‚Äôs library- cum-documentation center for children‚Äôs literature at New Delhi is now connected with the library network across the country and members can access the books online. This library is open for general public and researchers. Assistance to authors & publishers To promote the publication of reasonably priced books for higher education, NBT gives financial assistance to authors and publishers of textbooks and reference material. Under this scheme for the subsidized publication of books, only such books are subsidized for which a definite need is felt and which relate to subject areas where books of an acceptable standard are either not available or are so expensive as to be beyond the means of the students. So far, NBT has subsidized the publication of more than a thousand titles, mostly in English. The scope of the scheme has been widened to provide assistance for such publications in Indian languages. National Book Week Launched in the year 1982 the National Book Week is an initiative of the NBT to promote books and the habit of reading in the country.

The magazine aims to not only update readers about the current literary and publishing events being organized across the country but to connect readers of all age groups especially youth with the rich tradition of Indian writings. Besides the activities of the Trust, the magazine also carries unpublished, original writings (short story, essays, poems, travelogues, etc.) of emerging new writers, book reviews, etc. Scheme for Promotion of Young Women writers National Book Trust, India has introduced a new scheme to encourage young women writers ‚ÄòMahila Lekhan Protsahan Yojana‚Äô. As per the scheme, the Trust has invited proposals from young women writers below 40 years from across the country writing in any of the 22 Indian languages recognized by the Constitution and in English. The manuscript submitted should be the writer‚Äôs first, original and unpublished. The genres may include novel, travelogue, memoirs, diary, short stories, plays and satire. The manuscripts selected by the jury will be published by NBT. Shodh Yatri Programme The Shodh Yatri Programme is a unique programme initiated to encourage students to do research on India‚Äôs contributions and influences as well as areas of contacts between India and other countries in the neighborhood. In the process, the research findings will also trace the Indian roots in the evolution of their culture and heritage.In pursuing this programme the Ministry of Human Resource Development in association with Indian Council of Historical Research, Central Board of Secondary Education and National Book Trust, India organized an all India Online Contest to select students who could be part of the Programme.The contest was open to students of classes X and XI, across all Boards of School Education and schools in the country. The contest included writing an essay on the theme at the MyGov.in website. Forty students (20 boys and 20 girls) were shortlisted for the interview which was conducted through Skype, in which ten students were selected as winners. A felicitation ceremony for the winners of the online Shodh Yatri contest was held at the New Delhi World Book Fair 2017. The winners were felicitated with a certificate, wooden replica of Ashoka Stambh, and \`10,000/-. India-China Translation Programme In a significant initiative in cultural diplomacy, the Government of India and the Government of People‚Äôs Republic of China have put forward an ambitious translation programme that includes translation of select 25 classical and contemporary literary works from Chinese into Hindi and Indian literary works into Chinese. To give effect to this initiative a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India and the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television of the People‚Äôs Republic of China on Cooperation in Mutual Translation and Publication of classic and contemporary works. It was signed during the visit of Premier Li Keqiang to India. The project of taking forward the programme was given to National Book Trust, India. To implement this project the External Publicity and Public Diplomacy Division of Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India and the National Book Trust, India signed an MoU, to translate the 25 Chinese works into Hindi. In the first phase of translation books titled Analects of Confucius, Camel Xiangzi, Looks Beautiful and Selected Works of Bing Xin have been published.

Use TEM of a Zamia starch grain found at an archaeological site in Puerto Rico Like other cycads, Zamia integrifolia is poisonous, producing a toxin that affects the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. The toxin can however be removed by careful leaching, and the roots and half-buried stems of this cycad were used by Native American people (notably the Tequesta and Mayaimi Indians, the Seminole Indians and the Maroons) to produce this starch. The root is typically prepared by grinding (macerating) it using a wooden mortar and pestle. The pulp is then saturated in water and drained. The drained fluid is allowed to dry and the resulting yellowish powder is used in the preparation of various foods. In commercial production, multiple macerations achieved a whiter color. Commercial production of the starch (using roots gathered from wild plants) occurred in South Florida, from the 1830s until the 1920s. The starch was sold as Florida arrowroot, page 1. Note: this source identifies the species as Zamia pumila, which is very similar to Z. integrifolia but does not occur in Florida, thus the cycad in question would have been Z. integrifolia. until the Food and Drug Administration banned the practice in 1925.

The administrative district of Chiradzulu in southern Malawi was named after this mountain. Chiradzulu Mountain rises to a peak of 1,773m above sea level and is the third highest mountain peak in southern Malawi, after Mulanje Mountain, whose famous Sapitwa peak rises to 3,002m above sea level, and Zomba Mountain, which rises to 2,085m above sea level at its peak. Geography Chiradzulu Mountain rises imperiously from the valley below its southern silhouette and can be viewed by Zomba-bound motorists along the Blantyre-Zomba Road, from as far away as Mapanga. Its massive form looms larger as motorists approach Njuli. It cuts a picturesque backdrop to the east of the Blantyre-Zomba Road as motorists cruise past Njuli, aiming to perhaps stop and catch their breath at Namadzi, an intriguing town by a river of the same name on the Zomba District border. From this vantage point, motorists can, on a clear day, look back to catch one last silhouetted view of Chiradzulu Mountain as it lumbers tantalisingly further to the south-east. The form of the mountain takes on a curious appearance when viewed at a distance from its southern silhouette. It has the appearance of a huge, overweight man laughing, with its peak forming the head and the rest of its form below, forming the laboured shape of a legless, bloated man. This curious shape has earned the mountain the nickname of \\"Man Mountain\\" by tourists. Whilst there are no doubt mythological explanations among the surrounding tribal peoples as to how the mountain acquired its shape, geomorphology would suggest that this is the product of millennia of faulting activity coupled by the chiselling effects of wind erosion on the bare rock outcrops. One would also add that it is the tantalising effects of visual illusion from a distance which completes the picture. The mountain is actually divided into two parts, each with its own peak. Lisawo - which is the peak motorists view as they drive along the Blantyre-Zomba Road - is a younger sister to the mightier peak described above, which is simply called Chiradzulu. A winding road, a sight-seer's boon, runs between these two peaks. This road joins the villages to the north of the mountain, an area generally referred to as Mpama, with the villages on the foot of the mountain to its south, an area referred to variously as Malika or Lisawo. Midway through the course of its descent up the mountain, the road cuts through a plateaux-like plain between the two peaks, on which the British colonial government established an administrative settlement housing offices, a tourist information centre, and staff accommodation. It is from here that the author used to procure his supplies of \\"gondolosi\\" and \\"kajaliasi\\" (two potent aphrodisiacs!) from one of the sons of the chief resident forest ranger, a Mr Likharu! Ecology Chiradzulu Mountain was for a long time home to a variety of wildlife, including lions, hyenas, foxes, jackals, baboons, monkeys, antelope, wild pigs, and the fabled leopards. Due to overpopulation and poor wildlife conservation practices, some of these species, especially the big cats, have disappeared from the mountain or are at near-extinction levels. There is no doubt that even the potent \\"gondolosi\\" and \\"kajaliasi\\" herbs have now been over-consumed to extinction! Chiradzulu Mountain Forest Reserve Chiradzulu Mountain Forest Reserve was established in 1924, and covers an area of 774 hectares.Mauambeta, Daulos (2010). Status of Forests and Tree Management in Malawi: A Position Paper Prepared for the Coordination Union for Rehabilitation of the Environment (CURE). CURE Technical Report. September 2010 DOI: 10.13140/2.1.3497.7926 Origin of the name The origins of the name \\"Chiradzulu\\" are murky and can be traced back to an old myth supposedly derived from hunters who had forgotten to bring home the tail of a leopard they had killed on a hunting expedition. In ancient local folklore among some of the people who lived at the foot of the mountain, the tail of a leopard was considered to have magical powers and no hunter worth his name would kill a leopard and forget to bring the sought-after trophy home as an essential ingredient for a magical ritual which gave chiefs and notable tribesmen their mythical powers. On realising their foolish lapse of memory the morning after their hunting expedition, the band of hunters reorganised and retraced their steps to the place up in the mountain where they had had their kill. The foolish hunters never made it back home and no one ever heard of them after their disappearance that fateful morning. This was not unusual in those times, for, according to folklore, the mountain was full of ghosts which sometimes exacted vengeance on wayward humans who ventured too far off the beaten track into the thick of the then rich forest jungle by making them mysteriously disappear from the world of mortals, only to be reincarnated as ghosts themselves. Folklore has it that it is the above episode which gave birth to the name \\"Chiradzulu\\", a corruption of two Nyanja words, \\"mchira\\" and \\"wadzulo\\". \\"Mchira\\" literally means \\"a tail\\", and \\"wadzulo\\" translates to \\"yesterday's\\". So \\"Chiradzulu\\" literally means \\"Yesterday's Tail\\", a reference to the fate of the men who vanished into the jungle to collect the leopard's tail they had forgotten to carry home with them after the previous day's hunting expedition.

Ornithologist A prot√©g√© of Ludlow Griscom, Morgan's life list comprised more than 600 different birds. He saw the very first black-backed gull ever recorded in the Sudbury Valley. Morgan was also a member of a team of three birders who sighted North America's first cattle egret in April 1952. Education Morgan attended Wayland public schools, Mount Prospect School for Boys in Waltham, and Weston High School in Weston, Massachusetts. In early 1943, Morgan left high school halfway through his senior year at Weston High School to enter Bowdoin College. He joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve in February, and was employed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service during May and June, working on a gull control project along the Maine coast. He was called to duty by the Marine Corps in July 1943 and was assigned to officer training at Dartmouth College. He served in the Marine Corps in North and South Carolina, Virginia, and California from 1944‚Äì1946. Career Following graduation from Bowdoin in 1947 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology, Morgan took a job as an insurance underwriter at Aetna Casualty & Surety Company in Hartford, Connecticut. He left Hartford in 1950 to partner with his father, a life insurance salesman in Boston, Massachusetts, but was recalled to the Marine Corps later in the year. He resigned his commission with the Marine Corps and returned to the life insurance business in 1951. He received his Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designation from The American College in 1957. Morgan wrote scripts for several of Richard Borden's films, leading to his own interest in wildlife photography. He began to shoot his own 16 millimeter films and sold footage to the Disney Company. Morgan lectured extensively (logging in excess of 100 speaking engagements during some years). He called his presentation \\"Conservation is Common Sense\\". Sudbury Valley Trustees Morgan began a campaign to preserve \\"open space\\" for people, and habitats for wildlife in 1953. During that year, working with six friends, he founded the Sudbury Valley Trustees, Inc. (SVT), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to conserve land and protect wildlife habitat in the Concord, Assabet, and Sudbury river watersheds in eastern Massachusetts for the benefit of present and future generations. Massachusetts Audubon Society In 1956 Richard Borden, the newly appointed president of the Massachusetts Audubon Society, asked Morgan to join its board of directors. Morgan was appointed Audubon's fifth executive vice president less than a year later in November, 1957. Under Morgan's stewardship, Mass Audubon established its first scientific staff and oversaw its transition from a bird watching and educational group of 4,500 members and 65 permanent staff in 1957 to the largest and most influential conservation organization in the region with a permanent staff of 145 and nearly 28,000 members by the time he left in 1980. Morgan expanded educational programs, established numerous wildlife sanctuaries, and expanded Mass Audubon's nature centers. Morgan traveled widely on behalf of Mass Audubon and lobbied successfully for conservation legislation at both the state and federal level. Mass Audubon established the Allen Morgan Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1990 as a tribute to Morgan. Mass Audubon awards this prestigious prize to \\"an individual who demonstrates the dedication, passion, and daring that Morgan exhibited in protecting the natural world.\\" right Positions Morgan served on the Wayland Planning Board from 1958 to 1972. He founded the Wayland Conservation Commission in 1959, serving as its chairman until 1972. He was a member of the Massachusetts Legislative Oversight Committee on Water Pollution in 1966. Morgan was chairman of the Governor Francis W. Sargent's Committee for Reorganizing the Massachusetts Department of Natural Resources from 1969 to 1971. He served on or consulted with a number of environmental committees, boards, and government commissions, including the Sudbury Valley Trustees, The Environmental Policy Center (Washington, D.C.), the Center for Energy Policy, the New England Wildflower Preservation Society, the Wayland Conservation Commission, the Elbanobscot Foundation, Inc., the National Wildlife Federation, the national Rural Environment and Conservation Advisory Board‚ÄîDepartment of Agriculture, the Massachusetts Conservation Council, and the Coastal Wetland Action Committee. In 1972, Morgan was one of three representatives of the United States at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. SVT full time After Morgan's retirement from Mass Audubon in 1980, he was chosen a Fellow of Saybrook College at Yale University. In 1981, he turned his attention full-time to SVT as its first executive director. He expanded the SVT membership base, hired a staff, and supervised the acquisition of significant amounts of open space throughout the Sudbury River watershed while continuing his lecturing, consulting, and writing until his death. Morgan died from prostate cancer at the Lahey Clinic in 1990, a few months prior to his planned retirement in August. He is buried at the Old North Cemetery in Wayland. Morgan is remembered annually by SVT when it gives the Morgan Volunteer Award to a volunteer who has distinguished him or herself on behalf of SVT.

It is widely used for screening drugs that induce cannabinoid receptor-mediated effects in rodents. The four behavioral components of the tetrad are spontaneous activity, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia. Common assays for these behavioral paradigms are as follows: * Spontaneous activity (or hypomotility) is determined by an open field test, in which a mouse is placed in a cage with perpendicular grid lines, usually spaced by approx. 1 inch. An experimenter counts the number of line crossings by the mouse in a given amount of time. * Catalepsy is determined by the bar test. The mouse is placed on a bar oriented parallel to and approximately 1 inch off of the ground. If the mouse remains immobile on the bar for typically more than 20 seconds, it is considered cataleptic. * Hypothermia (reduced body temperature) is determined by using a rectal probe to measure the rectal temperature. * Analgesia is usually determined by the hot plate or tail immersion test. In the hot plate test, the mouse is placed on a heated plate, typically between 54 and 58¬∞C. An experimenter measures the time it takes for the animal to raise its feet or jump off of the hot plate. In the tail immersion test, the mouse is immobilized and its tail is placed into a warm water bath, typically also between 54 and 58¬∞C. An experimenter measures the time it takes for the mouse to remove its tail from the water bath. Direct CB1 agonists, such as THC (the psychoactive component of marijuana), or WIN 55,212-2, have effects in all components of the tetrad and induce hypomotility, catalepsy, hypothermia, and analgesia in rodents. Accordingly, all true \\"tetrad effects\\" are not observed following treatment with antagonists or inverse agonists of CB1 such as rimonabant. Data have shown, that also CB2 receptors are involved in the tetrad effects induced by cannabinoids, and other, associated with CB1 agonism.

Example 2 √ó 2 quasideterminants are as follows: : \\\\left\\\\begin{array}{cc} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\\\end{array} \\\\right_{11} = a_{11} - a_{12}{a_{22}}^{-1}a_{21} \\\\qquad \\\\left\\\\begin{array}{cc} a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \\\\end{array} \\\\right_{12} = a_{12} - a_{11}{a_{21}}^{-1}a_{22}. In general, there are n2 quasideterminants defined for an n √ó n matrix (one for each position in the matrix), but the presence of the inverted terms above should give the reader pause: they are not always defined, and even when they are defined, they do not reduce to determinants when the entries commute. Rather, : \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} \\\\frac{\\\\det A}{\\\\det A^{ij}} , where A^{ij} means delete the ith row and jth column from A. The 2\\\\times2 examples above were introduced between 1926 and 1928 by Richardson A.R. Richardson, Hypercomplex determinants, Messenger of Math. 55 (1926), no. 1. A.R. Richardson, Simultaneous linear equations over a division algebra, Proc. London Math. Soc. 28 (1928), no. 2. and Heyting, A. Heyting, Die theorie der linearen gleichungen in einer zahlenspezies mit nichtkommutativer multiplikation, Math. Ann. 98 (1928), no. 1. but they were marginalized at the time because they were not polynomials in the entries of A. These examples were rediscovered and given new life in 1991 by I.M. Gelfand and V.S. Retakh. I. Gelfand, V. Retakh, Determinants of matrices over noncommutative rings, Funct. Anal. Appl. 25 (1991), no. 2. I. Gelfand, V. Retakh, Theory of noncommutative determinants, and characteristic functions of graphs, Funct. Anal. Appl. 26 (1992), no. 4. There, they develop quasideterminantal versions of many familiar determinantal properties. For example, if B is built from A by rescaling its i-th row (on the left) by \\\\left.\\\\rho\\\\right., then \\\\leftB\\\\right_{ij} = \\\\rho \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij}. Similarly, if B is built from A by adding a (left) multiple of the k-th row to another row, then \\\\leftB\\\\right_{ij} = \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} \\\\,\\\\, (\\\\forall j; \\\\forall k eq i). They even develop a quasideterminantal version of Cramer's rule. Definition (a picture definition) Let A be an n\\\\times n matrix over a (not necessarily commutative) ring R and fix 1\\\\leq i,j\\\\leq n. Let a_{ij} denote the (i,j)-entry of A, let r_i^j denote the i-th row of A with column j deleted, and let c_j^i denote the j-th column of A with row i deleted. The (i,j)-quasideterminant of A is defined if the submatrix A^{ij} is invertible over R. In this case, :: \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} = a_{ij} - r_i^j\\\\, \\\\bigl(A^{ij}\\\\bigr)^{-1}\\\\, c_j^i . Recall the formula (for commutative rings) relating A^{-1} to the determinant, namely (A^{-1})_{ji} = (-1)^{i+j} \\\\frac{\\\\det A^{ij}}{\\\\det A}. The above definition is a generalization in that (even for noncommutative rings) one has :: \\\\bigl(A^{-1}\\\\bigr)_{\\\\\\\\!ji} = \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij}^{\\\\,-1} whenever the two sides makes sense. Identities One of the most important properties of the quasideterminant is what Gelfand and Retakh call the \\"heredity principle\\". It allows one to take a quasideterminant in stages (and has no commutative counterpart). To illustrate, suppose :: \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} A_{11} & A_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} \\\\end{array} \\\\right) is a block matrix decomposition of an n\\\\times n matrix A with A_{11} a k \\\\times k matrix. If the (i,j)-entry of A lies within A_{11}, it says that : \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} = \\\\leftA_{11} - A_{12}\\\\,{A_{22}}^{-1}\\\\,A_{21}\\\\right_{ij}. That is, the quasideterminant of a quasideterminant is a quasideterminant. To put it less succinctly: UNLIKE determinants, quasideterminants treat matrices with block-matrix entries no differently than ordinary matrices (something determinants cannot do since block-matrices generally don't commute with one another). That is, while the precise form of the above identity is quite surprising, the existence of some such identity is less so. Other identities from the papers are (i) the so- called \\"homological relations\\", stating that two quasideterminants in a common row or column are closely related to one another, and (ii) the Sylvester formula. (i) Two quasideterminants sharing a common row or column satisfy :: \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} A^{il}_{kj}^{\\\\,-1} = - \\\\leftA\\\\right_{il} A^{ij}_{kl}^{\\\\,-1} or :: A^{kj}_{il}^{\\\\,-1} \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} = - A^{ij}_{kl}^{\\\\,-1} \\\\leftA\\\\right_{kj} , respectively, for all choices i eq k, j eq l so that the quasideterminants involved are defined. (ii) Like the heredity principle, the Sylvester identity is a way to recursively compute a quasideterminant. To ease notation, we display a special case. Let A_0 be the upper-left k \\\\times k submatrix of an n \\\\times n matrix A and fix a coordinate (i,j) in A_0. Let B=(b_{pq}) be the (n-k)\\\\times(n-k) matrix, with b_{pq} defined as the (p,q)-quasideterminant of the (k+1)\\\\times(k+1) matrix formed by adjoining to A_0 the first k columns of row p, the first k rows of column q, and the entry apq. Then one has :: \\\\leftB\\\\right_{ij} = \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} . Many more identities have appeared since the first articles of Gelfand and Retakh on the subject, most of them being analogs of classical determinantal identities. An important source is Krob and Leclerc's 1995 article, D. Krob, B. Leclerc, Minor identities for quasi-determinants and quantum determinants, Comm. Math. Phys. 169 (1995), no. 1. To highlight one, we consider the row/column expansion identities. Fix a row i to expand along. Recall the determinantal formula \\\\det A = \\\\sum_l (-1)^{i+l} a_{il} \\\\cdot \\\\det A^{il}. Well, it happens that quasideterminants satisfy :: \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} = a_{ij} - \\\\sum_{l eq j} a_{il}\\\\cdot A^{ij}_{kl}^{\\\\,-1} A^{il}_{kj} (expansion along column j), and :: \\\\leftA\\\\right_{ij} = a_{ij} - \\\\sum_{k eq i} A^{kj}_{il} A^{ij}_{kl}^{\\\\,-1} \\\\cdot a_{kj} (expansion along row i). Connections to other determinants The quasideterminant is certainly not the only existing determinant analog for noncommutative settings--perhaps the most famous examples are the Dieudonn√© determinant and quantum determinant. However, these are related to the quasideterminant in some way. For example, :: {\\\\det}_q A = \\\\biglA\\\\bigr_{11}\\\\,\\\\leftA^{11}\\\\right_{22}\\\\,\\\\leftA^{12,12}\\\\right_{33} \\\\,\\\\cdots\\\\,a_{nn}_{nn} , with the factors on the right-hand side commuting with each other. Other famous examples, such as Berezinians, Moore and Study determinants, Capelli determinants, and Cartier-Foata-type determinants are also expressible in terms of quasideterminants. Gelfand has been known to define a (noncommutative) determinant as \\"good\\" if it may be expressed as products of quasiminors. Applications Paraphrasing their 2005 survey article with S.

The name of the village of Neston derives from the name of the house. The present house dates from 1790 and has been extended several time since then. It is ashlar-built in two storeys (three storey at rear) with a frontage of eight bays, and is Grade II* listed. The grounds of the house contain farmland: the estate extends from north of Neston village, southwards beyond Atworth, to South Wraxall, and includes the certified organic home farm with a herd of Jersey cattle and unusual Aberdeen Angus and Jersey cross-bred cattle. The route of the ancient Roman road from London to Bath crosses the home farm from east to west, about 200 metres (700 feet) south of the house. The local portion of the road is sometimes known as the Wansdyke. History The raised course of the Roman road has been reduced by 19th-century landscaping The Neston estate was built up by Thomas Tropenell in the 15th century, passed to the Eyre family and then by marriage to the Baronets Hanham. They sold it c.1790 to John Fuller (died 1839), who built Neston House. John was succeeded in turn by John Bird Fuller (died 1872), George Pargiter Fuller, MP (died 1927) and other descendants. The Fuller family became known for their participation in the Fuller, Smith and Turner brewery in London, producer of Fuller's London Pride cask ale.The History of Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. from the brewery's website.

In the late 1990s, the estate obtained a Countryside Stewardship Scheme agreement from the government, supporting a programme of hedge, wall and wild flower field margin restoration. The farm shop and coffee shop were established in Atworth in 2006. In 2013 a Bath Stone mine, called Park Lane Quarry and first worked in 1880, was reopened on the estate. The estate has been used as the filming location of a number of productions, including the outdoor sets for the 2008 BBC television adaptation of Lark Rise to Candleford, and some scenes of the ITV series Persuasion.

Moose and Nick in the Afternoon, two of Christy's best known works. Paul Christy (born Paul Christerson on March 20, 1939) is a former professional wrestler known mainly for his work in the National Wrestling Alliance and International Championship Wrestling as well as a stint in the World Wrestling Federation in the mid-1980s. Christy's wife, Bunny Burmeister, was also a professional wrestler and his manager, working under the name Miss Bunny Love. Christy and his wife both retired from the ring in 1990. Professional wrestling career After graduating high school, Christy began working at American Health Studio. His manager Jack Thornton liked Christy's look and convinced him to wrestle one professional wrestling match. Christy won his first match, which was held at the Marigold Arena. Christy moved to Chicago and began working for Fred Kohler. He was voted Rookie of the Year by the fans in 1960. Christy also worked for Dory Funk Sr. in Texas and for Mike DiBiase in Arizona. In Alabama, Christy formed a tag team with Ken Lucas, as his storyline brother Chris Lucas. The Lucas Brothers held both the Gulf Coast Tag Team title and Southern Tag Team title. After moving back to Chicago, Christy began working for the World Wrestling Association (WWA), where he held the WWA World Tag Team Championship with Wilbur Snyder, Moose Cholak and Roger Kirby. It was during this time that Christy met Bunny Burmeister and convinced Dick the Bruiser to let her act as his manager. In the 1980s, Christy and Bunny worked for International Championship Wrestling (ICW), where they were billed as \\"wrestling's Bonnie & Clyde.\\" In the ICW, Christy won the ICW Heavyweight Championship from Randy Savage. Following his run with the ICW, he worked for Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation as a jobber. Christy then semi- retired, working occasionally in Chicago as a villain. Personal life Christy grew up around Chicago, Illinois and attended Mt. Carmel Catholic High School after receiving a swimming scholarship. He then transferred to Harper High School and began amateur wrestling. Christy is currently retired and lives with his wife \\"Bunny Love\\" Burmeister in Three Rivers Michigan. He wrote a book detailing his wrestling career called The Many Faces of Paul Christy.

Mississippi  Steamer Mississippi was built in St. Louis in 1882. It was used by the MRC for its spring and fall inspection trips from St. Louis to New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1919 it was renamed Piomingo after being transferred to what is now the Memphis District, where it served as a towboat for many more years.  Mississippi II  Steamer Leota was built in 1899 as a dredge tender. Selected in 1920 as the new MRC inspection vessel, two years later it was rebuilt and re-designated Mississippi.  Mississippi III  Steamer Mississippi was a sternwheel, steam driven boat that was based upon the Mississippi II. After Mississippi II hull and machinery were determined to no longer be serviceable in 1926, a new hull, boilers, and engines were built at Jeffersonville, Indiana. In 1927, the cabin from its predecessor was moved atop the new hull at Paducah, Kentucky. Used for inspecting and surveying along rivers, the boat continued in service until April 1961, when the USACE decommissioned it at Memphis, Tennessee.

It was then moved to Marietta, Ohio, where it was the Showboat Becky Thatcher restaurant and theater in 1975. The boat was purchased by a group of interested citizens who planned to bring her to Marietta as part of the Bicentennial project. Those citizens formed a not- for-profit corporation, the Ohio Showboat Drama Inc., and in the summer of 1976, the musical Showboat was performed as part of the town's U.S Bicentennial celebration, by the Mid-Ohio Valley Players on the decks and an adjacent barge with 3,000 people watching from the shore. The boat was permanently moored on the Muskingum River, near where the mouth meets the Ohio River. Becky Thatcher was entered into the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service in September 1983. In 1984, the boat sank during a spring flood with heavy damage to her hull and superstructure, but she was raised and returned after repairs for the 1985 season. The theater operated until 2006.

Construction began in 1415 and the mosque was completed in 1421. The complex included a Friday mosque and a madrasa for four madhhabs.Behrens- Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 239 It replaced a prison which originally stood next to Bab Zuwayla. History The marble cenotaph of al-Mu'ayyad. Due to the visual style of the Kufic carving, it is believed to be of earlier Fatimid origin and thus recycled for this tomb. Sultan al-Mu'ayyad In keeping with Mamluk custom, al-Mu‚Äôayyad Shaykh was purchased by Sultan Al-Malik Az-Zahir Sayf ad-Din Barquq when he was ten or twelve years old. As an adult, he served for ten years as the governor of Tripoli under an appointment by Sultan An-Nasir Naseer ad-Din Faraj. The historian Al-Maqrizi relates the future Sultan al-Mu'ayyad was imprisoned in the same prison which the mosque replaced as while an emir under Sultan Faraj. Shaykh suffered so terribly from fleas and lice during his imprisonment, he vowed that he would transform the prison into \\"a saintly place for the education of scholars\\" if he ever came to power. True to his word, when he became Sultan he commissioned the mosque. In 1412, Shaykh assisted in overthrowing Sultan Faraj, and within six months, he seized power and became the new Sultan. He took the title al-Mu'ayyad and began to expand his empire through battles against neighboring territories. As sultan, al- Mu'ayyad led a number of successful campaigns to northern Syria, as well as fighting Turkoman neighbors in Anatolia. He advanced as far as Konya before having to return to Cairo. Sultan al-Mu'ayyad's reign was plagued by troubles: the Bubonic plague, currency devaluation, and rebellious bedouins all disturbed his reign. Despite this, the Sultan still managed to oversee the building of the mosque, which is recognized today as one of Cairo's signature landmarks. Under the sultan's sponsorship, the madrasa within the mosque became one of the most prominent academic institutions Cairo in the fifteenth century. The lavish endowment left by the sultan upon his death allowed the madrasa to hire the most eminent scholars of the day as professors. The most famous Quranic specialist in Egypt, Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalani, lectured in Shafi'i jurisprudence at the madrasa. Sultan al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh died in 1421, eleven years after he took power. Throughout his reign, he gained a reputation as a humble man and as one of the great patrons of architecture in Cairo. On his death, the sultan left behind several religious and secular monuments, including a khanqah in Giza, palaces along the Khalij el-Arab and the Nile, and the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad. Construction Construction of the mosque began in May 1415. The project was an ambitious one, costing the sultan 40,000 dinars between commencement and completion. According to al-Maqrizi, thirty builders and one hundred workers labored on the structure over seven years.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 241 The mosque required such a large quantity of marble that some of it was harvested from pre-existing structures. Besides marble, many other parts of the mosque were cannibalized from other buildings, including the mosque's columns and a beautiful bronze door and chandelier. The door and chandelier are particularly famous instances of this; both are said to have come from the Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan. Removing parts of current mosques was illegal while the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad was being built, so taking the door and chandelier were tanamount to stealing, despite donations the Sultan made to the old mosque. Although the new mosque was not officially completed until 1422, an inaugural celebration was held in November 1419 to celebrate the new building. Even after the official conclusion of the mosque's construction, a number of structures in the original plans were never built. The dome of the second mausoleum attached to the mosque was never completed. A separate building for use as dormitories by Sufi students who studied at the madrasa were not immediately erected, despite an allocation of 20,000 dinars toward them. Later mosque records are unclear as to whether the Sufi dormitories were later completed as plans, though the students definitely were given space in which to live. Purpose The mosque was intended as a funerary complex and for use in Friday prayers, but its greatest purpose was that of a madrasa for Sufi students, according to al-Maqrizi's story of its origins. The madrasa was devoted to the study of the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of Sharia law. According to the mosque's original documents, the madrasa was to house fifty Hanafis, forty Shafi'is, fifteen Malikis, and ten Hanbalis, and their respective teachers and imams. There were also two classes of twenty students each for students of tafsir and Hadith, and two others of ten each for students of the Quran recitation and legal studies, according to the Hanafi jurist al-Tahawi.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 239-241 Architecture and Appearance Exterior 250x250px minarets of the mosque, built on top of the Fatimid-era gate, Bab Zuweila. The Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad was the last great hypostyle mosque built in Cairo. Originally it had four facades and entrances. Over time, the mosque fell into disrepair, and today only the eastern facade and the prayer hall are original to the mosque. Much of what can be seen today has been restored over the past two hundred years and is not necessarily how the mosque originally looked. In order to build the mosque, a portion of the Fatimid wall which used to surround Cairo had to be demolished; however, an old section of the wall was recently discovered within the mosque's structure and can be seen today by visitors. The two towers of the nearby gate of Bab Zuweila, set in the original wall, were saved from demolition and serve as the base of the mosque's two remaining minarets; an unusual and unique feature of this mosque complex. The main portal, or muqarnas is set in a pistaq, or rectangular frame, that rises above the mosque's facade. This was the last grand portal built in the Mamluk period; it is framed with to the mosque is decorated with finely carved marble bands and kufic calligraphic script. The marble was carved in a geometric pattern and decorated by polychromatic stones and colored stucco in high relief. The main door is a masterpiece of bronze work taken from the Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan, while the dome is a typical example of Mamluk stone masonry with a cylindrical base and carved zig-zag pattern. The original facades were particularly tall for the period, due to the extra height added by the Fatimid towers at the base of the minarets. The facades were decorated with two rows of windows, and shops beneath each wall of the mosque were added in the original plans and remain today. The shops attached to and around the mosque play an important role in the mosque's upkeep, as a percentage of their earnings go toward maintaining the building and its staff. Originally, the mosque was intended to include a symmetrical pair of domed mausoleums flanking a prayer hall; this ambition was curbed when the dome of the second mausoleum was not completed.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 243 On either side of the prayer hall are funerary chambers, housing the Sultan and his son in one and female members of the Sultan's family in the other. The Sultan's chamber has a domed ceiling, as originally planned, while the women's chamber has a plain flat ceiling. This dome is a reduced copy of Faraj's twin domes; because of the large size of the mosque, the dome appears disproportionately small in its setting. Interior The sanctuary (prayer hall) of the mosque. The mihrab, covered in black and white marble compositions, and the wooden minbar (right). The sanctuary of the mosque was one of the most richly decorated of its time; wall decoration was limited to the prayer hall, which was decorated with polychromatic marble high enough to include window and mihrab recesses. The marble columns are pre- Islamic and have diverse sizes and shapes, since they were drawn from structures across Cairo and the surrounding territories. Floors were paved with polychrome marble in the sanctuary and courtyard, although the minor riwaqs were paved with stone. The prayer hall includes two blind windows decorated either in the Andalusian or Moroccan style, one in a geometric pattern and the other in floral.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 244 The mihrab and minbar are both decorated in a typical period style. The minbar is decorated with finely carved wooden doors and panels, and above the minbar is a large rosette of polychrome marble. This is particularly unique because this style is usually used on a floor, rather than upon a wall.Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. \\"Cairo of the Mamluks\\". Cairo:AUC Press, 2008. p 243-244 The funerary chambers are largely plain, although there are cenotaphs carved in marble. The largest of these cenotaphs is a quote from the Qur'an in Kufic script reading \\"Surely those who avoid evil will be among gardens and fountains: enter them in peace, secure\\" (Qur'an 15:45-46). The visual style of the carved Kufic inscriptions dates it to the Fatimid period, meaning al-Mu'ayyad likely salvaged it from an earlier building. Both funerary chambers have shallow mihrabs on their walls facing the lesser riwaqs. These mihrabs were likely used by people praying within each riwaq, especially in the case of overflow during peak prayer times. Other rooms in the mosque included a library, which was itself known for its collection of books. The majority of books in the library came directly from the Citadel's royal collection. Five hundred others were donated by the sultan's private secretary, Muhammad al-Barizi. For this contribution, al-Barizi's son was appointed as the mosque's preacher and librarian. Donations similar to this were common among high-level bureaucrats in the hope that they might gain similar favor with the Sultan. The mosque has a remarkably large pavilion compared to other mosques in the area with an ablutions fountain in the centre. The original fountain was said to have marble columns roofed with a gilded wooden dome above an awning, adding to the building's splendor. Just west of the mosque are the ruins of a hammam which was part of the mosque's foundation. alt= Inside the minarets are carved cartouches signed and dated by the architect upon the completion of each. This is particularly rare; it is very uncommon for an architect to leave his mark on a building in this era. The eastern minaret reads that the \\"ma'dhana\\" (or minaret) was built by Muhammad Ibn al-Qazzaz and was finished in August 1419. The western minaret is slightly different, reading that the Sultan al-Mu'ayyad ordered the construction of two \\"manars\\" (minarets) and that they were executed by Muhammad Ibn al-Qazzaz and completed in August 1420. Scholars are unsure as to why two different words for minaret were used in each inscription, and it remains a small mystery of the building. There was also a third minaret at the West portal to the street, but it fell into disrepair and was never rebuilt. Renovations View from minarets Throughout its history, the Mosque of Sultan al-Mu'ayyad has undergone extensive renovations. Even early on, reconstruction was necessary. According to al-Maqrizi, the eastern minaret had to be pulled down and rebuilt as early as 1418 due to structural insecurity from its tower base. Another three-story minaret stood at the Western portal on a side street; it collapsed in 1427 during Sultan Barsbay's reign and was immediately rebuilt. By the nineteenth century, the mosque had fallen into such disrepair that all that remained was one facade, the prayer hall, and the mausoleums. Ibrahim Pasha, the son of Muhammad 'Ali, oversaw restorations in the late 1830s and 1840s, including the installation of Turkish tiles in the qibla wall. In the late nineteenth century, the Comit√© de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe rebuilt the western facade and turned the courtyard into a garden. In 2001, the mosque again underwent restorations, this time by the order of the Egyptian Ministry of Culture. These restorations removed the garden from the courtyard and rebuilt the majority of the mosque, including missing arcades around the courtyard. This project has restored the mosque and its results can be seen today; however, visitors should note that what they see is not necessarily what the mosque looked like in its original form.

It was fought between the Irish Confederates and the English Parliamentarians during the Irish Confederate Wars. The battle occurred when an English force under Colonel Daniel Axtell attacked the Connacht Irish army led by the Marquess of Clanricarde. The result was the rout of the Connacht army by Axtell's soldiers. Background The Parliamentarian capture of the Castle at Tecroghan enabled the English to approach the borders of Connacht during the summer of 1650. This caused the Confederates into action pending the threat of invasion. Clanricarde was the leading Irish commander in the province and by August recognised as the de facto successor to Ormond as Lord- Lieutenant of Ireland. Clanricarde was a better diplomat than a military man as he had maintained peace in Connacht during the turmoil of the 1640s. As the English armies approached the borders of Connacht, Clanricarde organised an army of 3,000 men to support Lord Dillon's garrison at Athlone. When Ireton marched south from Athlone in late September and early October, Clanricarde launched a counter-attack across the River Shannon, with the intention of cutting English communications between Athlone and Limerick and denying them supplies from King's County. Clanricarde's forces crossed the Shannon at fords around Shannonbridge (to the south of Athlone) in early October. The Connacht army quickly captured Ferbane Castle. Colonel Axtell, the English commander in the region, was forced over the River Brosna and then to Birr after some skirmishes between his regiment and the Irish army. Clanricarde's forces then seized some small English outposts. As Axtell's regiment retreated, Clanricarde was reinforced by James Preston, bringing the strength of his army up to just over 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. However, English reinforcements under Colonels Cook and Abbot quickly marched up from Wexford and Kilkenny to join Axtell at Roscrea on 21 October. When Axtell advanced towards Birr to challenge the Irish army, Clanricarde decided to withdraw and to take up formidable defensive positions on Meelick Island, a Crannog on the River Shannon. The battle Soldiers were posted to overlook the ford that the English would have to cross in order to attack the Irish entrenchments on Meelick Island. Axtell however launched an attack as the light was fading on the evening of 25 October. The fighting was initially fierce, with clubbed muskets being used in close quarter fighting and soon the Irish were driven from the forward post guarding the ford. After the Parliamentarians gained a foothold on the island, the Irish were routed. Several hundred Irish soldiers were killed in the battle, many drowning in the waters of the Shannon as they tried to escape. The English captured Clanricarde's baggage train, including weapons, tents and many horses, though Burke himself escaped. The castle and posts taken by the Irish on the eastern side of the Shannon were quickly recaptured by the victorious Parliamentarians. The rout at Meelick Island was a major blow to the Connacht Irish army, comparable to the loss of the Leinster army at Rathmines or the defeat of the Ulster army at Scarrifholis a few months before. Clanricarde attempted to put an army back together in subsequent months, but after this defeat he had great difficulty. After the battle it was alleged that Axtell's soldiers had executed many of the Irish soldiers after a promise of quarter. As a result, Axtell was court-martialled by Ireton and ordered to return to England.

It is illustrated primarily by Sarah Gibb and published by Orion Children's Books in Britain, and Candlewick Press in America. The series originated as a poem that Kessler was writing about a \\"little girl who lived on a boat but had a big secret\\"; an editor recommended that Kessler turn the poem into a book. The series follows the adventures of thirteen-year-old Emily Windsnap after she discovers that she is half mermaid in the first book and is targeted towards middle grade readers. Summary Emily Windsnap lives aboard a boat with her mother. After years of her mother trying to keep her out of the water, her mother gives Emily permission to take mandatory swim lessons at school when she turns thirteen. Class is going well until Emily dives into the pool and her legs lock together causing her to panic and need to be rescued by her teacher. Later that night Emily investigates this mysterious turn of events by diving into the ocean where she discovers that once her legs lock together they turn into a beautiful mermaid's tail! Realizing she is Semi-Mer, Emily sets out to discover her family history and find her father. On the way she makes friends with a teen mermaid named Shona Silkfin who invites her into the merworld under the sea. She discovers that Neptune, the King of the Sea, has banned marriages between merfolk and humans, and that her father is being held in the merworld prison by Neptune.

Organs bearing Balcom‚Äôs design influence were often small, unit organs, sometimes consisting of only three manuals. These projects commonly contained an amount of old pipe work or components from (redundant or altered instruments.

The return of William J. Bunch to Balcom and Vaughan, after a period of time working for Aeolian Skinner firm, as the Vice-President of the production marked a zenith for the company. Bunch took over the company when Balcom retired in 1966. Instruments from this period are noteworthy for their classic style and a particular basic design, and were often built with a complete chorus on the great, and frequently contained a bright unit reed (known as the ‚Äúhautbois‚Äù).

WYOY debuted in September 1996, and gave the Jackson area its first Top 40 station since 1993. Its studios are located in Ridgeland and the transmitter site is in Raymond. History Originally licensed to Canton, Mississippi, Lles Communications put WWLM on the air January 6, 1976, but only for a short time. Issues with the construction permit prompted the station to go dark later that year. After Lles transferred the station to Donald G. Manuel in 1980, it returned in 1981 as WDGM, airing classical music. WDGM flipped to a rock format on July 7, 1982, going by the name \\"Rock 102\\". The rock, however, would be short-lived. On September 10, a fire destroyed the station's temporary studios in a mobile home. It was the second in a series of fires at rock radio stations in Mississippi, including a deliberately set March 1982 blaze at a station in Lexington and a January 1983 fire that consumed the transmitter of WQMV in Vicksburg. In the wake of the fire, the station filed to relocate and change its city of license from Canton to Gluckstadt. That allowed Rock 102 to return on April 14, 1983, under new WZXQ call letters, using a tower on Livingston Road in Jackson. Jackson Radio, Inc., sold WZXQ and WYAI (780 AM) to Exchequer Communications for $700,000 in late 1985. When the station shifted from rock to adult contemporary as \\"EZ Rock\\" in 1986, the call letters were changed to WEQZ to match. WEQZ also became the local carrier for Ole Miss athletics, an upgrade over their former station in Jackson, WZRX (1590 AM). In late 1988, WEQZ flipped to classic rock as \\"Q-102\\". In February 1989, WLIN, an easy listening outlet at 95.5 FM, flipped to contemporary hit radio as WOHT, leaving a group of highly vocal listeners upset. As a result, after a strong response to a set of \\"Do you miss WLIN?\\" ads the station placed in local newspapers‚Äîreceiving nearly 5,000 replies‚ÄîWEQZ dropped its classic rock sound and flipped to the format, complete with the WLIN call letters, in March. As the Jackson radio market consolidated, by 1992, it was the last station not involved in a local marketing agreement with another, though this did not last; New South Radio, which had begun programming WLIN under LMA, bought it and the associated AM outright in 1994. As the 1990s progressed, WLIN segued into a soft adult contemporary format. In August 1996, New South Radio flipped WLIN to its current contemporary hit radio format, adopting the call letters WYOY.

Central to the formation of the League was Noah Ablett, a miner from the Rhondda who was at the core of a group at Ruskin College, Oxford who challenged the lecturers' opposition to Marxism. In the 1907‚Äì8 academic year, Ablett began leading unofficial classes in Marxist political economy which were attended by Ebby Edwards, among others. Ablett returned to South Wales in 1908, where he began promoting Marxist education through local branches of the Independent Labour Party.Syndicalism in South Wales, Bob Pitt A mixture of students and former students at Ruskin founded the Plebs' League in November 1908, also launching the Plebs' Magazine.Proletcult, Eden Paul (1921) In the first issue of the Plebs, dated February 1909, Ablett contributed an article on the need for independent working class education.Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders, A.

The students were supported by the Principal, Dennis Hird, and when he was dismissed the students went on strike, refusing to attend classes. The rebels formed the Central Labour College, which worked closely with the Plebs' League. By 1910, the Plebs' League was active in South Wales, Lancashire and Scotland. Activists included A. J.

Pitura was born in Wagga Wagga to a Polish father and as a child played rugby league. He was just 16 when he was recruited to South Melbourne by coach Norm Smith and he eventually made his league debut in 1969, ironically against Richmond. A left footed half forward flanker and centreman, Pitura represented Victoria at interstate football in 1973. At the conclusion of the 1973 season, due to a strained relationship with the board, Pitura came close to leaving the club but remained on their books for the following year. He didn't play again until late July in 1974, after season long negations with South Melbourne. Richmond attempted to trade Pitura to their club at the year's end but the South Melbourne committee refused to clear him. After Pitura threatened to challenge the league's clearance rules in court, South Melbourne relented and traded him to Richmond in 1975. The trade saw Graham Teasdale, Brian Roberts and Francis Jackson come to South Melbourne. All three of them made an impact at their new club, Teasdale won the 1977 Brownlow, Roberts finished equal sixth in the 1975 Brownlow before walking out on the club and Jackson played 100 games. Pitura however struggled at Richmond and managed just three seasons. His last game was in the 1977 finals campaign where Richmond lost to North Melbourne in the Semi Final, having defeated Pitura's old club South Melbourne a week earlier in the Elimination Final. Pitura joined New South Wales club North Shore in 1978 as captain-coach and steered them to the premiership. He also spent some years playing in Queensland for both Kedron and Coorparoo.

Playing career Junior career Cochrane played hockey and cricket as well as rugby league while at school and represented his state in all three sports at schoolboy level. Cochrane captained the Australian Schoolboys tour of England and France in 1979, scoring twelve tries and seven goals. He was also rated the best forward of the tour after playing at hooker, and . Cochrane also had enough speed in his schoolboys days that he occasionally played on the wing. Senior career Although he originally discussed a career with Canterbury- Bankstown following the 1979 tour, he signed with Manly-Warringah, the club of his childhood hero Bob Fulton who, in 1983 would also become the Sea Eagles coach. After biding his time in reserve grade behind Max Krilich and Ray Brown, Mal Cochrane made his first grade debut for Manly in Round 16 of the 1983 NSWRFL season on 12 June. He played from the bench in the Sea Eagles 34‚Äì6 win over the Illawarra Steelers in front of 8,083 fans at Manly's home ground Brookvale Oval.1983 NSWRFL Rd.16 - Manly vs Illawarra He would play 5 first grade games (all from the bench) in 1983.

Veneti, 5th-1st century BCE. Greek coinage occurred in three Greek cities of Massalia, Emporiae and Rhoda, and was copied throughout southern Gaul. Northern Gaulish coins were especially influenced by the coinage of Philip II of Macedon and his famous son Alexander the Great. Celtic coins often retained Greek subjects, such as the head of Apollo on the obverse and two-horse chariot on the reverse of the gold stater of Philip II, but developed their own style from that basis, allowing for the development of a Graeco-Celtic synthesis. After this first period in which Celtic coins rather faithfully reproduced Greek types, designs started to become more symbolic, as exemplified by the coinage of the Parisii in the Belgic region of northern France. The Armorican Celtic style in northwestern Gaul also developed from Celtic designs from the Rhine valley, themselves derived from earlier Greek prototypes such as the wine scroll and split palmette.

The images found on Celtic coins include giants trailing severed heads on rope, horsemen charging into battle, gods and goddesses, skulls and chariot wheels, thunderbolts and lightning, the sun and the moon. They are miniature masterpieces of surreal art. A tribe of Celts called Eburones minted gold coins with triple spirals (a Celtic good luck symbol) on the front, and horses on the back.Cache of Celtic Coins Uncovered in Dutch Cornfield Associated Press November 16, 2008 The coins were either 'struck' or 'cast'. Both methods required a substantial degree of knowledge. Striking a blank coin formed in a clay mould was one way. After forming the blank, it would have been flattened out before striking with a die made from iron or bronze. The tiny details engraved on dies were just a few millimeters in diameter. Casting a coin required a different technique. They were produced by pouring molten alloy into a set of molds which were broken apart when the metal had cooled.

In early Philippine history, the rank of Lakan denoted a \\"paramount ruler\\" (or more specifically, \\"paramount datu\\") of one of the large coastal barangays (known as a \\"bayan\\") on the central and southern regions of the island of Luzon. Overview The lakan was democratically selected by other ruling datus from among themselves to serve as their \\"pangulo\\" (head). Writers such as William Henry Scott have suggested that this rank is equivalent to that of Rajah, and that different ethnic groups either used one term or the other, or used the two words interchangeably.Scott, William Henry, Barangay: Sixteenth-Century Philippine Culture and Society, Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1994. But other writers such as Nick Joaquin have suggested that the usage of the term \\"Rajah\\" specifically indicates leadership of a bayan or barangay which has extensive trade relations with Muslim traders. Equivalent terms for this rank include the term \\"Sultan\\" among the most developed and complex Islamized principalities of Mindanao, and the term \\"Datu\\" as used by various polities in the Visayas and in some areas of Mindanao.  Orthography and similar terms The title Lakan can be spelled separately from a person's name (e.g. \\"Lakan Dula\\"), or can be incorporated into a singly spelled word (e.g. \\"Lakandula\\"). Rajah and Lakan: It is sometimes argued that since the words Rajah and Lakan mean more or less the same thing, the two should not be used together. Thus, popular reference to Rajah Lakan Dula are said to be the result of mistaking Lakan Dula to be the full proper name of the historic king.  Prominent Lakans  Users of the title Lakan that figure in 16th- and 17th-century Spanish colonial accounts of Philippine history include: *Lakandula (later renamed and baptized as Don Carlos Lacandola), king of Tondo when the Spanish colonization of the Philippines in Luzon began. *Lakan Tagkan, ruler of Namayan. *Lambusan (Lakan Busan), a king in pre-colonial Mandaue. *Lakan Usman, king of Bangsa Usman.  Present-day usage  In present-day culture, the term is still occasionally used to mean \\"nobleman\\", but has mostly been adapted to other uses. The name of Malaca√±an Palace, the official residence of the President of the Republic of the Philippines, is traditionally attributed to the phrase may lakan diyan, or \\"the king [or head] resides there\\". In Filipino Martial Arts, Lakan denotes an equivalent to the black belt rank.http://www.martialedge.net/encyclopedia/definition/terminology/view/lakan/ Also, beauty contests in the Philippines have taken to referring to the winner as \\"Lakambini\\", the female equivalent of Lakan. In such cases, the contestant's assigned escort can be referred to as a Lakan. More often, a male pageant winner is named a Lakan.http://www.oroquietacity.com/ArtCulture/Lakambini.html  See also  *Principal√≠a *Maginoo *Datu *Maharlika *Timawa *Philippine shamans *Tondo (historical polity) *Barangay *History of the Philippines (pre-1521)  Sources  Indigenous culture of the Tagalog people History of the Philippines (900‚Äì1565) Filipino paramount rulers Filipino nobility Filipino royalty Philippine society Social class in the Philippines ","title":"Lakan"},{"id":"18793503","text":":This article refers to an airport in Samson, Alabama.

Disappearance According to Casey Anthony's father, George Anthony, Casey left the family's home on June 16, 2008, taking her daughter Caylee (who was almost three years old) with her, and did not return for 31 days. Casey's mother Cindy asked repeatedly during the month to see Caylee, but Casey claimed that she was too busy with a work assignment in Tampa, Florida. At other times, she said Caylee was with a nanny, who Casey identified by the name of Zenaida \\"Zanny\\" Fernandez-Gonzalez, or at theme parks or the beach. It was eventually determined that a woman named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez did in fact exist, but that she had never met Casey, Caylee, any other member of the Anthony family, nor any of Casey's friends. Learning that Casey's car was in a tow yard, George Anthony went to recover it; he and the yard attendant noted a strong smell coming from the trunk. Both later stated that they believed the odor to be that of a decomposing body. (authorized video) When the trunk was opened, it contained only a bag of trash. Cindy reported Caylee missing that day, July 15, to the Orange County Sheriff's Office. During the same telephone call, Casey confirmed to the 9-1-1 operator that Caylee had been missing for 31 days. Sounding distraught, Cindy said: \\"There is something wrong. I found my daughter's car today and it smells like there's been a dead body in the damn car.\\" Case Investigation The wooded area where Caylee Anthony's body was found. When Detective Yuri Melich of the Orange County Sheriff's Department began investigating Caylee's disappearance, he found discrepancies in Casey's signed statement. When questioned, Casey said Caylee had been kidnapped by Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, who she also identified as \\"Zanny\\", Caylee's nanny. Although Casey had talked about her, Zanny had never been seen by Casey's family or friends, and in fact there was no nanny. Casey also told police that she was working at Universal Studios, a lie she had been telling her parents for years. Investigators brought Casey to Universal Studios on July 16, 2008, the day after Caylee was reported missing, and asked her to show them her office. Casey led police around for a while before admitting that she had been fired years before.Barbara Liston, Casey Anthony lied and killed daughter: prosecutor, Reuters, May 25, 2011. Casey was first arrested on July 16, 2008, and was charged the following day with giving false statements to law enforcement, child neglect, and obstruction of a criminal investigation. The judge denied bail, saying Casey had shown \\"woeful disregard for the welfare of her child\\". On July 22, 2008, after a bond hearing, the judge set bail at $500,000. On August 21, 2008, after one month of incarceration, she was released from the Orange County jail after her $500,000 bond was posted by the nephew of California bail bondsman Leonard Padilla in hopes that she would cooperate and Caylee would be found. On August 11, 12, and 13, 2008, meter reader Roy Kronk called police about a suspicious object found in a forested area near the Anthony residence.Bianca Prieto and Walter Pacheco, Orange County meter reader discusses Casey Anthony case on 'Good Morning America', Orlando Sentinel, January 14, 2009. In the first instance, he was directed by the sheriff's office to call the tip line, which he did, receiving no return call. On the second instance, he again called the sheriff's office, eventually was met by two police officers and reported to them that he had seen what appeared to be a skull near a gray bag. On that occasion, the officer conducted a short search and stated he did not see anything. On December 11, 2008, Kronk again called the police. They searched and found the remains of a child in a trash bag. Investigative teams recovered duct tape which was hanging from hair attached to the skull and some tissue left on the skull. Over the next four days, more bones were found in the wooded area near the spot where the remains initially had been discovered.Bianca Prieto, Deputy in Caylee case faces firing, Orlando Sentinel, April 11, 2009.

On September 5, 2008, she was released again on bail on all pending charges after being fitted with an electronic tracking device. Her $500,000 bond was posted by her parents, Cindy and George Anthony, who signed a promissory note for the bond. On October 14, 2008, Casey Anthony was indicted by a grand jury on charges of first degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and four counts of providing false information to police. She was later arrested.Copy of Casey Anthony seven count indictment , Discovery Channel blog, 2008. Judge John Jordan ordered that she be held without bond. On October 21, 2008, the charges of child neglect were dropped against Casey, according to the State Attorney's Office because \\"[as] the evidence proved that the child was deceased, the State sought an indictment on the legally appropriate charges.\\" On October 28, Anthony was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to all charges. On April 13, 2009, prosecutors announced that they planned to seek the death penalty in the case. Trial =Evidence= Four hundred pieces of evidence were presented. A strand of hair was recovered from the trunk of Casey's car which was microscopically similar to hair taken from Caylee's hairbrush. The strand showed \\"root- banding,\\" in which hair roots form a dark band after death, which was consistent with hair from a dead body. Kronk, who discovered the remains, repeated the same basic story that he had told police. On Friday, October 24, 2008, a forensic report by Arpad Vass of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory judged that results from an air sampling procedure (called LIBS) performed in the trunk of Casey Anthony's car showed chemical compounds \\"consistent with a decompositional event\\" based on the presence of five key chemical compounds out of over 400 possible chemical compounds that Vass' research group considers typical of decomposition. Investigators stated that the trunk smelled strongly of human decomposition, but human decomposition was not specified on the laboratory scale. The process has not been affirmed by a Daubert Test in the courts. Vass' group also stated there was chloroform in the car trunk.Sarah Lundy, FBI, Oak Ridge lab tests on Casey Anthony's car released, Orlando Sentinel, October 25, 2008. In October 2009, officials released 700 pages of documents related to the Anthony investigation, including records of Google searches of the terms \\"neck breaking\\" and \\"how to make chloroform\\" on a computer accessible to Casey, presented by the prosecutors as evidence of a crime. According to detectives, crime-scene evidence included residue of a heart-shaped sticker found on duct tape over the mouth of Caylee's skull. However, the laboratory was not able to capture a heart-shape photographically after some duct tape was subjected to dye testing. A blanket found at the crime scene matched Caylee's bedding at her grandparents' home. Among photos entered into evidence was one from the computer of Ricardo Morales, an ex-boyfriend of Casey Anthony, depicting a poster with the caption \\"Win her over with Chloroform\\".\\"Casey Anthony trial: 'Oh my God, I'm such a good liar' Casey told witness\\" . Palm Beach Post. May 27, 2011. Witness John Dennis Bradley's software, developed for computer investigations, was used by the prosecution to indicate that Casey had conducted extensive computer searches on the word \\"chloroform\\" 84 times, and to suggest that Anthony had planned to commit murder. He later discovered that a flaw in the software misread the forensic data and that the word \\"chloroform\\" had been searched for only one time and the website in question offered information on the use of chloroform in the 19th century (see ). =Attorneys and jury= The lead prosecutor in the case was Assistant State Attorney Linda Drane Burdick. Assistant State Attorneys Frank George and Jeff Ashton completed the prosecution team. Lead counsel for the defense was Jose Baez, a Florida criminal defense attorney. Attorneys J. Cheney Mason, Dorothy Clay Sims, and Ann Finnell served as co-counsel. During the trial, attorney Mark Lippman represented George and Cindy Anthony. Jury selection began on May 9, 2011, at the Pinellas County Criminal Justice Center in Clearwater, Florida, because the case had been so widely reported in the Orlando area. Jurors were brought from Pinellas County to Orlando. Jury selection took longer than expected and ended on May 20, 2011, with twelve jurors and five alternates being sworn in. The panel consisted of nine women and eight men. The trial took six weeks, during which time the jury was sequestered to avoid influence from information available outside the courtroom. =Opening statements= The trial began on May 24, 2011, at the Orange County Courthouse, with Judge Belvin Perry presiding. In the opening statements, lead prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick described the story of the disappearance of Caylee Anthony day-by-day. The prosecution alleged an intentional murder and sought the death penalty against Casey Anthony. Prosecutors stated that Anthony used chloroform to render her daughter unconscious before putting duct tape over her nose and mouth to suffocate her, and left Caylee's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it. They characterized Anthony as a party girl who killed her daughter to free herself from parental responsibility and enjoy her personal life. The defense, led by Jose Baez, claimed in opening statements that Caylee drowned accidentally in the family's pool on June 16, 2008, and was found by George Anthony, who told Casey she would spend the rest of her life in jail for child neglect and then proceeded to cover up Caylee's death. Baez argued this is why Casey Anthony went on with her life and failed to report the incident for 31 days. He alleged that it was the habit of a lifetime for Casey to hide her pain and pretend nothing was wrong because she had been sexually abused by George Anthony since she was eight years old and her brother Lee also had made advances toward her. Baez also questioned whether Roy Kronk, the meter reader who found the bones, had actually removed them from another location, and further alleged that the police department's investigation was compromised by their desire to feed a media frenzy about a child's murder, rather than a more mundane drowning. He admitted that Casey had lied about there being a nanny named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzales.Amy Pavuk, Anthony: Transcript of murder trial opening statement filed in defamation case, Orlando Sentinel, July 08, 2011. =Witness testimony= Prosecutors called George Anthony as their first witness and, in a response to their question, he denied having sexually abused his daughter Casey.Walter Pacheco, Defense bombshell: Caylee Anthony drowned in family swimming pool, Orlando Sentinel, May 24, 2011.

She told the jury the test had come back negative.Jessica Hopper, Casey Anthony Trial: Defense Casts Shadow on Heart Stickers Found With Caylee's Remains , ABC News, June 16, 2011. Regarding a photo on the computer of Ricardo Morales, an ex-boyfriend of Casey Anthony, depicting a poster with the caption \\"Win her over with Chloroform,\\" Morales said that the photo was on his Myspace page and that he had never discussed chloroform with Anthony or searched for chloroform on her computer. The prosecution called John Dennis Bradley, a former Canadian law enforcement officer who develops software for computer investigations, to analyze a data file from a desktop taken from the Anthony home. Bradley said he was able to use a program to recover deleted searches from March 17 and March 21, 2008, and that someone searched the website Sci-spot.com for \\"chloroform\\" 84 times. Bradley expressed his belief that \\"some of these items might have been bookmarked\\". Under cross-examination by the defense, Bradley agreed there were two individual accounts on the desktop and that there was no way to know who actually performed the searches. Police dog handler Jason Forgey testified that Gerus, a German Shepherd cadaver dog certified in 2005, indicated a high alert of human decomposition in the trunk of Casey's car, saying the police dog has had real-world searches numbering \\"over three thousand by now\\". During cross-examination, Baez argued that the dog's search records were \\"hearsay\\". Sgt. Kristin Brewer also testified that her police dog, Bones, signaled decomposition in the backyard during a search in July 2008. However, neither police dog was able to detect decomposition during a second visit to the Anthony home. Brewer explained that this was because whatever had been in the yard was either moved or the odor dissipated. The prosecution called chief medical examiner Jan Garavaglia, who testified that she determined Caylee's manner of death to be homicide, but listed it as \\"death by undetermined means\\". Garavaglia took into account the physical evidence present on the remains she examined, as well as all the available information on the way they were found and what she had been told by the authorities, before arriving at her determination. \\"We know by our observations that it's a red flag when a child has not been reported to authorities with injury, there's foul play,\\" Garavaglia said. \\" ... There is no child that should have duct tape on [the lower part of] its face when it dies.\\" Additionally, Garavaglia addressed the chloroform evidence found by investigators inside the trunk of Casey's car, testifying that even a small amount of chloroform would be sufficient to cause the death of a child. University of Florida professor and human identification laboratory director Michael Warren was brought on by the prosecution to present a computer animation of the way duct tape could have been used in the death of the child, which the defense objected to hearing. Judge Perry, after a short recess to review, ruled that the video could be shown to the jury. The animation featured a picture of Caylee taken alongside Casey, superimposed with an image of Caylee's decomposed skull, and another with a strip of duct tape that was recovered with her remains. The images were slowly brought together showing that the duct tape could have covered her nose and mouth. Baez stated, \\"This disgusting superimposition is nothing more than a fantasy ...They're throwing things against the wall and seeing if it sticks.\\" Jurors were seen taking notes of the imagery, and Warren testified that it was his opinion that the duct tape found with Caylee's skull was placed there before her body began decomposing. FBI latent-print examiner Elizabeth Fontaine testified that adhesive in the shape of a heart was found on a corner of a piece of duct tape that was covering the mouth portion of Caylee's remains during ultraviolet testing. Fontaine examined three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Although Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, \\"When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination.\\" During the defense's cross-examination, Fontaine explained that when she examined the sticker evidence a second time, after subjecting the tape to dye testing, \\"It was no longer visible.\\"Steve Helling, Casey Anthony Trial: Heart-Shaped Sticker Residue Found on Duct Tape, People, June 13, 2011. She said that other FBI agents had tested the duct tape in the interim. The defense called two government witnesses who countered prosecution witness testimony about the duct tape. The chief investigator for the medical examiner stated that the original placement of the duct tape was unclear and it could have shifted positions as he collected the remains. Cindy Anthony testified that their family buried their pets in blankets and plastic bags, using duct tape to seal the opening.CFNEWS 13 Day 32: Defense rests, Casey Anthony won't testify , Central Florida News 13, June 30. Additionally, an FBI forensic document examiner found no evidence of a sticker or sticker residue on the duct tape found near the child's remains.Jacqueline Fell, Adam Longo, Kelli Cook 20: Casey Anthony's defense begins case, challenges DNA evidence, Central Florida News 13, June 16, 2011. The defense called forensic pathologist Dr. Werner Spitz, who performed a second autopsy on Caylee after Garavaglia and challenged Garavaglia's autopsy report. He called her autopsy \\"shoddy,\\" saying it was a failure that Caylee's skull was not opened during her examination. \\"You need to examine the whole body in an autopsy,\\" he said. Spitz stated that he was not allowed to attend Garavaglia's initial autopsy on Caylee's remains, and that, from his own follow-up autopsy, he was not comfortable ruling the child's death a homicide. He said he could not determine what Caylee's manner of death was, but said that there was no indication to him that she was murdered. Additionally, Spitz testified that he believed the duct tape found on Caylee's skull was placed there after the body decomposed, opining that if tape was placed on the skin, there should have been DNA left on it, and suggested that someone may have staged some of the crime scene photos. \\"The person who took this picture, the person who prepared this, put the hair there,\\" stated Spitz. When asked by Ashton during cross- examination, \\"So your testimony is the medical examiner's personnel took the hair that wasn't on the skull, placed it there?\\", Spitz answered, \\"It wouldn't be the first time, sir. I can tell you some horror stories about that.\\" On June 21, Bradley discovered that a flaw in his software misread the forensic data and that the word \\"chloroform\\" had been searched for only one time and the website in question offered information on the use of chloroform in the 19th century. On June 23, Baez called Cindy Anthony to the stand, who told jurors she had been the one who performed the \\"chloroform\\" search on the family computer in March 2008. The prosecution alleged that only Casey could have conducted this search and the others because she was the only one home at the time. When asked by prosecutors how she could have made the Internet searches when employment records show she was at work, Cindy Anthony said despite what her work time sheet indicates, she was at home during these time periods because she left from work early during the days in question. Bradley alerted prosecutor Linda Burdick and Sgt. Kevin Stenger of the Sheriff's Office the weekend of June 25 about the discrepancy in his software, and volunteered to fly to Orlando at his own expense to show them. On the same day, the judge temporarily halted proceedings when the defense filed a motion to determine if Anthony was competent to proceed with trial. The motion states the defense received a privileged communication from their client which caused them to believe \\"...Ms. Anthony is not competent to aid and assist in her own defense\\". The trial resumed on June 27 when the judge announced that the results of the psychological evaluations showed Anthony was competent to proceed. Later, in testimony about air samples, Dr. Ken Furton, a professor of chemistry at Florida International University, stated that there is no consensus in the field on what chemicals are typical of human decomposition. Judge Perry ruled that the jury would not get to smell air samples taken from the trunk. The prosecution stated they discussed Bradley's software discrepancy with Baez on June 27, and he raised the issue in court testimony. Baez also asked Judge Perry to instruct the jury about this search information, but prosecutors disputed this and it was not done.Jacqueline Fell, Mistake in chloroform evidence in Casey Anthony case , Central Florida News 13, July 19, 2011. Also on June 27, the defense called two private investigators who, in November 2008, had searched the area where the body was later found. The search was videotaped, but nothing was found.Jacqueline Fell, Adam Longo and Kelli Cook, Day 29: Casey Anthony competent to stand trial, expert breaks down decomposition , Central Florida News 13, June 28, 2011.

The defense then called Roy Kronk, who recounted the same basic story he told police about his discovery of Caylee Anthony's remains in December 2008. He acknowledged receiving $5,000 after the remains were identified, but denied that he told his son that finding the body would make him rich and famous. The next day, his son testified he had made such statements.Day 31: George Anthony breaks down, jury hears from Kronk's son, grief expert , Central Florida News 13, June 30, 2011. On June 30, the defense called Krystal Holloway, a volunteer in the search for Caylee, who stated that she had had an affair with George Anthony, that he had been to her home, and that he had texted her, \\"Just thinking about you. I need you in my life.\\" She told the defense that George Anthony had told her that Caylee's death was \\"an accident that snowballed out of control.\\" Under cross- examination by prosecutors, they pointed to her sworn police statement in which she had said that George Anthony believed it was an accident, rather than knowing that it was. In her initial report, Holloway reported George Anthony saying, \\"I really believe that it was an accident that just went wrong and (Casey Anthony) tried to cover it up.\\" She said he had not told her he was present when the alleged accident occurred.Ashley Hayes, Defense Rests In Casey Anthony Trial , CNN via KVIA, June 29, 2011.Barbara Liston, Casey Anthony won't testify, Reuters, June 30, 2011. During redirect examination, Baez asked Holloway if George Anthony had told her that Caylee was dead while stating publicly that she was missing, to which she replied yes.Day 32: Defense rests, Casey Anthony won't testify , Central Florida News 13, June 30, 2011. In his earlier testimony, George Anthony denied the affair with Holloway and said he visited her only because she was ill. He said he sent the text message because he needed everyone who had helped in his life. After Holloway's testimony, Judge Perry told jurors that it could be used to impeach George Anthony's credibility, but that it was not proof of how Caylee died, nor evidence of Casey Anthony's guilt or innocence. The prosecution rested its case on June 15, after calling 59 witnesses for 70 different testimonies. The defense rested its case on June 30, after calling 47 witnesses for 63 different testimonies. Casey Anthony did not testify. On June 30 and July 1, the prosecutor presented rebuttal arguments, beginning by showing the jury photographs of Caylee's clothes and George's suicide note. It called two representatives of Cindy Anthony's former employer who explained why their computer login system shows Cindy was at work the afternoon she said she went home early and searched her computer for information about chloroform. A police computer analyst testified someone had purposely searched online for \\"neck + breaking.\\" Another analyst testified she did not find evidence that Cindy Anthony had searched certain terms she claimed to have searched. Anthropology professor Dr. Michael Warren from the University of Florida was recalled to rebut a defense witness on the need to open a skull during an autopsy. The lead detective stated that there were no phone calls between Cindy and George Anthony during the week of June 16, 2008. However, he told the defense he did not know that George had a second cell phone.Jacqueline Fell, Adam Longo and Christine Webb, Day 33: Testimony ends, closing arguments start Sunday , Central Florida News 13, July 01, 2011.Carlin DeGuerin Miller Casey Anthony Trial Update: Defense rests without calling Casey, prosecution begins rebuttal June 30, 2011 =Closing arguments= Closing arguments were heard July 3 and July 4. Jeff Ashton, for the prosecution, told the jury, \\"When you have a child, that child becomes your life. This case is about the clash between that responsibility, and the expectations that go with it, and the life that Casey Anthony wanted to have.\\" He outlined the state's case against Casey, touching on her many lies to her parents and others, the smell in her car's trunk‚Äîidentified by several witnesses, including her own father, as the odor from human decomposition‚Äîand the items found with Caylee's skeletal remains in December 2008. He emphasized how Casey \\"maintains her lies until they absolutely cannot be maintained any more\\" and then replaces [them] with another lie, using \\"Zanny the Nanny\\" as an example. Anthony repeatedly told police that Caylee was with the nanny that she specifically identified as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. Police, however, were never able to find the nanny. Authorities did find a woman named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, but she denied ever meeting the Anthonys. Ashton reintroduced the items found with Caylee's remains, including a Winnie the Pooh blanket that matched the bedding at her grandparents' home, one of a set of laundry bags with the twin bag found at the Anthony home, and duct tape he said was a relatively rare brand. \\"That bag is Caylee's coffin,\\" Ashton said, holding up a photograph of the laundry bag, as Casey reacted with emotion. He further criticized the defense's theory that Caylee drowned in the Anthony pool and that Casey and George panicked upon finding the child's body and covered up her death. He advised jurors to use their common sense when deciding on a verdict. \\"No one makes an accident look like murder,\\" he said. Before closing arguments, Judge Perry ruled that the defense could argue that a drowning occurred due to reasonable conclusions aided by witness testimony,Boedecker, Hal (July 3, 2011). \\"Casey Anthony: Did judge throw defense a huge bone?\\" . Orlando Sentinel. but that arguing sexual abuse was not allowed since there was nothing to support the claim that George sexually abused Casey. Baez began by contending that there were holes in the prosecution's forensic evidence, saying it was based on a \\"fantasy\\". He told the jury that the prosecution wanted them to see stains and insects that did not really exist, that they had not proven that the stains in Anthony's car trunk were caused by Caylee's decomposing body, rather than from a trash bag found there. He added that the prosecutors tried to make his client look like a promiscuous liar because their evidence was weak. He said the drowning is \\"the only explanation that makes sense\\" and showed jurors a photograph of Caylee opening the home's sliding glass door by herself. He stressed that there were no child safety locks in the home and that both of Casey's parents, George and Cindy, testified that Caylee could get out of the house easily. Although Cindy testified that Caylee could not put the ladder on the side of the pool and climb up, Baez alleged that Cindy may have left the ladder up the night before. \\"She didn't admit to doing so in testimony,\\" he said, \\"but how much guilt would she have knowing it was her that left the ladder up that day?\\" Defense attorney Jose Baez told jurors his biggest fear was that they would base their verdict on emotions, not evidence. \\"The strategy behind that is, if you hate her, if you think she's a lying, no-good slut, then you'll start to look at this evidence in a different light,\\" he said. \\"I told you at the very beginning of this case that this was an accident that snowballed out of control... What made it unique is not what happened, but who it happened to.\\" He explained Casey Anthony's behavior as being the result of her dysfunctional family situation. At one point as Baez spoke, Ashton could be seen smiling or chuckling behind his hand. This prompted Baez to refer to him as \\"this laughing guy right here\\". The judge called a sidebar conference, then a recess. When court resumed, he chastised both sides, saying both Ashton and Baez had violated his order that neither side should make disparaging remarks about opposing counsel. After both attorneys apologized, the judge accepted the apologies but warned that a recurrence would have the offending attorney excluded from the courtroom. Defense attorney Cheney Mason then followed with an additional closing argument. Addressing the jury to discuss the charges against Casey Anthony. \\"The burden rests on the shoulders of my colleagues at the state attorney's office,\\" Mason said, referring to proving that Casey Anthony committed a crime. Mason said that the jurors are required, whether they like it or not, to find the defendant not guilty if the state did not adequately prove its case against Casey Anthony. Mason emphasized that the burden of proof is on the state, and that Casey Anthony's decision not to testify is not an implication of guilt. Lead prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick in the prosecution rebuttal told the jurors that she and her colleagues backed up every claim they made in their opening statement six weeks ago, and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims. \\"My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all the rhetoric of the case,\\" she said, insisting that she would never ask the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence. \\"Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable,\\" she stated. \\"What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong.\\" She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a \\"decoy\\" put there to keep people from getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot. \\"Whose life was better without Caylee?\\" she asked, stressing how George and Cindy Anthony were wondering where their daughter and granddaughter were in June and July 2008, the same time Casey was staying at her boyfriend's apartment while Caylee's body was decomposing in the woods. \\"That's the only question you need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left on the side of the road dead.\\" Burdick then showed the jury a split-screen with a photo of Casey partying at a night club on one side and a close-up of the \\"\\" (meaning \\"Beautiful Life\\") tattoo that she got weeks after Caylee died on the other. The jury began deliberations on July 4. On July 5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, they were about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so. One legal analyst stated that if the jury had found Casey guilty before receiving the exculpatory evidence, the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial. =Verdict and sentence= On July 5, 2011, the jury found Casey not guilty of counts one through three regarding first-degree murder, aggravated manslaughter of a child, and aggravated child abuse, while finding her guilty on counts four through seven for providing false information to law enforcement: *Count Four: Anthony said she was employed at Universal Studios during 2008, pursuant to the investigation of a missing persons report. *Count Five: Anthony said she had left Caylee at an apartment complex with a babysitter causing law enforcement to pursue the missing babysitter. *Count Six: Anthony said she informed two \\"employees\\" of Universal Studios, Jeff Hopkins and Juliet Lewis, at Universal, of the disappearance of Caylee. *Count Seven: Anthony said she had received a phone call and spoke to Caylee on July 15, 2008, causing law enforcement to expend further resources. On July 7, 2011, sentencing arguments were heard. The defense asked for the sentencing to be based on one count of lying on the grounds that the offenses occurred as part of a single interview with police dealing with the same matter, the disappearance of her daughter, as one continuous lie. The defense also argued for concurrent sentences, that is for all four counts to become one count and the sentence to run together as one. The judge disagreed with defense arguments, finding that Anthony's statements consisted of \\"four distinct, separate lies\\" ordered the sentences be served consecutively, noting that \\"Law enforcement expended a great deal of time, energy and manpower looking for Caylee Marie Anthony. This search went on from July through December, over several months, trying to find Caylee Marie Anthony.\\" Judge Perry sentenced Casey to one year in the county jail and $1,000 in fines for each of the four counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer, the maximum penalty prescribed by law. She received 1,043 days credit for time served plus additional credit for good behavior, resulting in her release on July 17, 2011. In September 2011, Perry, complying with a Florida statute requiring judges to assess investigative and prosecution costs if requested by a state agency, ruled that Casey Anthony must pay $217,000 to the state of Florida. He ruled she had to pay those costs directly related to lying to law enforcement about the death of Caylee, including search costs only up to September 30, 2008, when the Sheriff's Office stopped investigating a missing- child case.Michael Winter,Casey Anthony now owes $217K for Caylee's search, USA Today, September 23, 2011. In earlier arguments, Mason had called the prosecutors' attempts to exact the larger sum \\"sour grapes\\" because the prosecution lost its case. He told reporters that Anthony is indigent.Anthony Colarossi, Casey Anthony trial costs: How much she'll pay is up to judge, Orlando Sentinel, September 02, 2011. In January 2013, a Florida appeals court reduced her convictions from four to two counts. Her attorney had argued that her false statements constituted a single offense; however, the appeals court noted she gave false information during two separate police interviews several hours apart. Media coverage Initial coverage The case attracted a significant amount of national media attention, and was regularly the main topic of many TV talk shows, including those hosted by Greta Van Susteren, Nancy Grace, Geraldo Rivera, and others. It has been featured on Fox's America's Most Wanted, NBC's Dateline, and ABC's 20/20. Nancy Grace referred to Casey Anthony as the \\"tot mom\\" and urged the public to let \\"the professionals, the psychics and police\\" do their jobs. Casey Anthony's parents, Cindy and George, appeared on The Today Show on October 22, 2008. They maintained their belief that Caylee was alive and would be found. Larry Garrison, president of SilverCreek Entertainment, was their spokesman until he resigned in November 2008, citing that he was leaving due to \\"the Anthony family's erratic behavior\\". More than 6,000 pages of evidence released by the Orange County Sheriff's Department, including hundreds of instant messages between Casey and her ex-boyfriend Tony Rusciano, were the subject of increased scrutiny by the media for clues and possible motives in the homicide. Outside the Anthony home, WESH TV 2 reported that protesters repeatedly shouted \\"baby killer\\" and that George Anthony was physically attacked. George Anthony was reported missing on January 22, 2009, after he failed to show up for a meeting with his lawyer, Brad Conway. George was found in a Daytona Beach hotel the next day after sending messages to family members threatening suicide. He was taken to Halifax Hospital for psychiatric evaluation and later released. Trial coverage The trial was commonly compared to the O. J. Simpson murder case, both for its widespread media attention and initial shock at the not-guilty verdict. At the start of the trial, dozens of people raced to the Orange County Courthouse, hoping to secure one of 50 seats open to the public at the murder trial. Because the case received such thorough media attention in Orlando, jurors were brought in from Pinellas County, Florida, and sequestered for the entire trial. The trial became a \\"macabre tourist attraction\\", as people camped outside for seats in the courtroom, where scuffles also broke out among those wanting seats inside. The New York Post described the trial as going \\"from being a newsworthy case to one of the biggest ratings draws in recent memory\\", and Time magazine dubbed it \\"the social media trial of the century\\". Cable news channels and network news programs became intent upon covering the case as extensively as they could. Scot Safon, executive vice president of HLN, said it was \\"not about policy\\" but rather the \\"very, very strong human dimension\\" of the case that drove the network to cover it. The audience for HLN's Nancy Grace rose more than 150 percent, and other news channels deciding to focus on the trial saw their ratings double and triple. HLN achieved its most watched hour in network history (4.575 million) and peaked at 5.205 million when the verdict was read. According to The Christian Post, the O. J. Simpson case had a 91 percent television viewing audience, with 142 million people listening by radio and watching television as the verdict was delivered. \\"The Simpson case was the longest trial ever held in California, costing more than $20 million to fight and defend, running up 50,000 pages of trial transcript in the process.\\" The Casey Anthony trial was expected to \\"far exceed\\" these numbers. Opinions varied on what made the public thoroughly invested in the trial. Safon argued the Anthonys having been a regular and \\"unremarkable\\" family with complex relationships made them intriguing to watch. In a special piece for CNN, psychologist Frank Farley described the circumstantial evidence as \\"all over the map\\" and that combined with \\"the apparent lying, significant contradictions and flip-flops of testimony, and questionable or bizarre theories of human behavior, it is little wonder that this nation [was] glued to the tube\\". He said it was a trial that was both a psychologist's dream and nightmare, and believes that much of the public's fascination had to do with the uncertainty of a motive for the crime. Psychologist Karyl McBride discussed how some mothers stray away from \\"the saintly archetype\\" expected of mothers. \\"We want so badly to hang onto the belief system that mothers don't harm children,\\" she stated. \\"It's fascinating that the defense in the Anthony case found a way to blame the father. While we don't know what is true and maybe never will, it is worth taking a look at the narcissistic family when maternal narcissism rules the roost. Casey Anthony is a beautiful white woman and the fact that the case includes such things as sex, lies, and videotapes makes it irresistible.\\" When the not-guilty verdict was rendered, there was significant outcry among the general public and media that the jury made the wrong decision. Outside the courthouse, many in the crowd of 500 reacted with anger, chanting their disapproval and waving protest signs. People took to Facebook and Twitter, as well as other social media outlets, to express their outrage. Traffic to news sites surged from about two million page views a minute to 3.3 million, with most of the visits coming from the United States. Mashable reported that between 2 pm and 3 pm, one million viewers were watching CNN.com/live, 30 times higher than the previous month's average. Twitter's trending topics in the United States were mostly about the subjects related to the case, and Newser reported that posts on Facebook were coming in \\"too fast for all Facebook to even count them, meaning at least 10 per second\\". Some people referred to the verdict as \\"O.J. Number 2\\", and various media personalities and celebrities expressed outrage via Twitter. News anchor Julie Chen became visibly upset while reading the not-guilty verdict on The Talk and had to be assisted by her fellow co-hosts, who also expressed their dismay. Others, such as Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel, felt the verdict was fair because the prosecution did not have enough evidence to establish guilt or meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Hannity said that the verdict was legally correct, and that all of the evidence that was presented by the prosecution was either impeached or contradicted by the defense. John Cloud of Time magazine echoed these sentiments, saying the jury made the right call: \\"Anthony got off because the prosecution couldn't answer [the questions],\\" Cloud stated. \\"Because the prosecutors had so little physical evidence, they built their case on Anthony's (nearly imperceptible) moral character. The prosecutors seemed to think that if jurors saw what a fantastic liar Anthony was, they would understand that she could also be a murderer.\\" Disagreement with the verdict was heavily debated by the media, lawyers and psychologists, who put forth several theories for public dissatisfaction with the decision, ranging from wanting justice for Caylee, to the circumstantial evidence having been strong enough, to some blaming the media. UCLA forensic psychiatrist Dr. Carole Lieberman, said, \\"The main reason that people are reacting so strongly is that the media convicted Casey before the jury decided on the verdict. The public has been whipped up into this frenzy wanting revenge for this poor little adorable child. And because of the desire for revenge, they've been whipped up into a lynch mob.\\" She added, \\"Nobody likes a liar, and Anthony was a habitual liar. And nobody liked the fact that she was partying after Caylee's death. Casey obviously has a lot of psychological problems. Whether she murdered her daughter or not is another thing.\\" There was a gender gap in perceptions to the case. According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll of 1,010 respondents, about two-thirds of Americans (64 percent) believed Casey Anthony \\"definitely\\" or \\"probably\\" murdered her daughter; however, women were much more likely than men to believe the murder charges against Anthony and to be upset by the not-guilty verdict. The poll reported that women were more than twice as likely as men, 28 percent versus 11 percent, to think Anthony \\"definitely\\" committed murder. Twenty-seven percent of women said they were angry about the verdict, compared with nine percent of men. On the day Casey Anthony was sentenced for lying to investigators in the death of her daughter, supporters and protesters gathered outside the Orange County Courthouse, with one man who displayed a sign asking Anthony to marry him. Two men who drove overnight from West Virginia held signs that said, \\"We love and support you Casey Anthony,\\" and \\"Nancy Grace, stop trying to ruin innocent lives. The jury has spoken. P.S. Our legal system still works!\\" The gender gap has partly been explained by \\"the maternal instinct\\"‚Äîthe idea of a mother murdering her own child is a threat to the ideal of motherhood. For example, the trial was compared to the 1960s trial of Alice Crimmins, who was accused of murdering her two small children. Explanations other than, or emphasizing, the prosecution's lack of forensic evidence were given for the jury's decision. A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Anthony to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented. The CSI effect was also extensively argued‚Äîthat society now lives \\"in a 'CSI age' where everyone expects fingerprints and DNA, and we are sending a message that old-fashioned circumstantial evidence is not sufficient\\". Likewise, commentators such as O. J. Simpson case prosecutor Marcia Clark believe that the jury interpreted \\"reasonable doubt\\" too narrowly. Clark said instruction on reasonable doubt is \\"the hardest, most elusive\\" instruction of all. \\"And I think it's where even the most fair-minded jurors can get derailed,\\" she said, opining the confusion between reasonable doubt and a reason to doubt. \\"In Scotland, they have three verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and not proven. It's one way of showing that even if the jury didn't believe the evidence amounted to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it didn't find the defendant innocent either. There's a difference.\\" Aftermath Defense, prosecution, and jury Following the criminal trial, Mason blamed the media for the passionate hatred directed toward Casey Anthony. He described it as a \\"media assassination\\" of her before and during the trial, saying, \\"I hope that this is a lesson to those of you who have indulged in media assassination for three years, bias, and prejudice, and incompetent talking heads saying what would be and how to be.\\" Mason added: \\"I can tell you that my colleagues from coast to coast and border to border have condemned this whole process of lawyers getting on television and talking about cases that they don't know a damn thing about, and don't have the experience to back up their words or the law to do it. Now you have learned a lesson.\\" Mason's response was viewed as especially critical of Nancy Grace, whose news program is cited as having \\"almost single-handedly inflated the Anthony case from a routine local murder into a national obsession\\". Grace said that she did not understand why Mason would care what pundits are saying, and that she imagines she has tried and covered as many cases as Mason. She criticized the defense attorneys for delivering media criticism before mentioning Caylee's name in their post-verdict news conference, and said she disagrees with the verdict. At a meeting of local professionals, named the Tiger Bay Club of Tampa, Mason told the media and those in attendance that he was surprised by the not-guilty verdict. State's Attorney Lawson Lamar said, \\"We're disappointed in the verdict today because we know the facts and we've put in absolutely every piece of evidence that existed. This is a dry-bones case. Very, very difficult to prove. The delay in recovering little Caylee's remains worked to our considerable disadvantage.\\" Jose Baez said, \\"While we're happy for Casey, there are no winners in this case. Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force has been for the last three years has been always to make sure that there has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee. It's that simple.\\" He added, \\"And today our system of justice has not dishonored her memory by a false conviction.\\" Former Casey Anthony defense attorney Linda Kenney Baden shared Baez's sentiments. She believes the jury reached the right verdict. \\"We should embrace their verdict,\\" she stated. On July 6, 2011, Jeff Ashton gave his first interview about the case on The View. Ashton said of the verdict, \\"Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted. But from the perspective of what we do, this was a fantastic case.\\" He disagrees with those who state the prosecution overcharged the case, saying, \\"The facts that we had... this was first-degree murder. I think it all came down to the evidence. I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death.\\" Ashton additionally explained that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, \\"then so be it\\". He said he accepts the jury's decision and that it has not taken away his faith in the justice system. \\"You can't believe in the rule of law and not accept that sometimes it doesn't go the way you think it should,\\" stated Ashton, and explained that he understands why the case \\"struck such a nerve\\" with the public. \\"I think when people see someone that they believe has so gone away from [a mother's love for her child], it just outrages them.\\" Ashton also made appearances on several other talk shows in the days following, and complimented Jose Baez on his cross-examinations and as having \\"the potential to be a great attorney\\". After the trial ended, the twelve jurors did not initially want to discuss the verdict with the media. 51-year-old Russell Huekler, an alternative juror who stepped forward the day of the verdict, said, \\"The prosecution didn't provide the evidence that was there for any of the charges from first-degree murder down to second-degree murder to the child abuse to even the manslaughter [charge]. It just wasn't there.\\" The next day, juror number three‚ÄîJennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student‚Äîtold ABC News, \\"I did not say she was innocent\\" and \\"I just said there was not enough evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot determine what the punishment should be.\\" She added, \\"I'm not saying that I believe the defense,\\" but that \\"it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B\\" via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. Ford believed George Anthony was \\"dishonest.\\" She said the jury \\"was sick to [their] stomachs to get [the not-guilty] verdict\\" and that the decision process overwhelmed them to the point where they did not want to talk to reporters afterwards.Mary Kate Burke, Jessica Hopper, Casey Anthony Juror: 'Sick to Our Stomachs' Over Not Guilty Verdict, ABC News, July 6, 2011. Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the St. Petersburg Times that \\"everybody agreed if we were going fully on feelings and emotions, [Anthony] was done\\". He stated that a lack of evidence was the reason for the not-guilty verdict: \\"I just swear to God ... I wish we had more evidence to put her away. I truly do ... But it wasn't there.\\" He also said that Anthony was \\"not a good person in my opinion\\". Juror number six, identified by WTSP as Brian Berling, told gossip website TMZ.com that he was willing to be interviewed \\"so long as the opportunities are paid\\". In an anonymous interview, the jury foreman stated, \\"When I had to sign off on the verdict, the sheet that was given to me‚Äîthere was just a feeling of disgust that came over me knowing that my signature and [Casey Anthony's] signature were going to be on the same sheet,\\" but that \\"there was a suspicion of [George Anthony]\\" that played a part in the jury's deliberations. The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony \\"had a very selective memory\\" which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. \\"That a mother would want to do something like that to her child just because she wanted to go out and party,\\" he said. \\"We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak.\\" Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10‚Äì2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement. Perry announced at sentencing on July 7 that he would withhold the jurors' names for several months because of concern that \\"Some people would like to take something out on them.\\"Jamal Thalji, Casey Anthony jurors' names will be released ‚Äî but not today , St. Petersburg Times, July 8, 2011. He released the jurors' names on October 25, 2011. On May 6, 2013, he stated that he believed there was sufficient evidence to convict Casey Anthony, even though most of the evidence was circumstantial, and that he was shocked by the not-guilty verdict. Anthony family Mark Lippman, the attorney for George and Cindy Anthony, told ABC News that the family received death threats after the not-guilty verdict was rendered. In response to the verdict, a statement was released by Lippman on behalf of the Anthony family (George, Cindy and Lee Anthony): > While the family may never know what has happened to Caylee Marie Anthony, > they now have closure for this chapter of their life. They will now begin > the long process of rebuilding their lives.

It was alleged in press reports that Cindy Anthony had perjured herself when telling jurors she‚Äînot Casey Anthony‚Äîwas the one who used her family computer to search the Internet for \\"chloroform\\". The state attorney's office said she would not be charged. On July 6, 2011, Anthony's jailhouse letters were released to the general public. They were originally released (though not to public) in April 2010 by prosecutors preparing for the Anthony trial. In more than 250 handwritten pages, Anthony discusses her life in jail, what she misses, and her plans for the future if freed. On July 8, 2011, Cindy Anthony had scheduled a visit to meet with Casey at 7 pm, but Casey declined to meet with her mother. Mark Lippman told Reuters during the trial that Casey had cut off communication with her parents. It was later announced that George and Cindy Anthony would be appearing on Dr. Phil in September 2011 to tell their story.Camille Mann Dr. Phil to interview Casey Anthony's parents, CBS News, August 17, 2011. Casey left for an undisclosed location not long after the verdict. However, on August 12, she was ordered to return to Florida to serve a year's supervised probation for an unrelated check-fraud conviction. When she pleaded guilty to that charge in January 2010, the judge in that case intended for Casey to serve her probation after proceedings in the murder case concluded, but an error in the sentencing documents allowed her to serve her probation while awaiting trial. Casey returned to Florida on August 25 and is serving out her probation in an undisclosed location. Due to numerous threats against her life, the Department of Corrections did not enter her information into the state parolee database. In August 2011, George and Cindy issued a statement that Casey would not be living at their home when she returned to Florida to serve her probation.Adam Longo Anthony family: Casey's not coming home , Central Florida News 13, August 13, 2011. According to Huffington Post, she was reportedly working with her probation officer to take online college classes in an unspecified field, while protected by her security, at an undisclosed educational institution. In August 2011, the Florida Department of Children and Families released a report based on a three-year investigation into the disappearance and death of Caylee. An agency spokesperson stated, \\"It is the conclusion of the [DCF] that [Casey Anthony] failed to protect her child from harm either through her actions or lack of actions, which tragically resulted in the child's untimely death.\\" Casey filed bankruptcy with the Middle District of Florida Bankruptcy Court on January 27, 2013. Her estimated liabilities were between $500,000 and $1 million. Civil suits In September 2008, Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey for defamation. During the investigation, Anthony told investigators that she left -year-old Caylee with a babysitter named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez‚Äîalso known as \\"Zanny\\"‚Äîon June 16 at the stairs of a specific apartment in the Sawgrass apartment complex located in Orlando. Fernandez-Gonzalez, who was listed on apartment records as having visited apartments on that date, was questioned by police, but stated she did not know Casey or Caylee. Her defamation suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Casey willfully damaged her reputation. Fernandez-Gonzalez has told reporters that she lost her job, was evicted from her house, and received death threats against herself and her children as a result of Anthony's lies. Fernandez-Gonzalez' lawyer, John Morgan, said he wants to interrogate Anthony about Caylee's death because it is \\"the essence\\" of the defamation suit. On October 8, 2011, Morgan deposed Casey via a video conference. She exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and answered only a couple of factual questions. Morgan felt that was improper, but legal experts think that Anthony is well within her rights to plead the Fifth until her appeals of the convictions for lying to officers are exhausted. Fernandez-Gonzalez' attorneys sought and received permission to obtain Anthony's address (though it was kept sealed from the public) so they could subpoena her to testify, even if she only took the stand long enough to plead the Fifth. However, Fernandez-Gonzalez is willing to drop the suit if Anthony apologizes to her and compensates her for pain and suffering. In September 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Anthony, stating: \\"There is nothing in the statement‚Ä¶to support (Fernandez-Gonzalez's) allegations that (Anthony) intended to portray (the nanny) as a child kidnapper and potentially a child killer.\\" In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a non-profit group which assisted in the search for Caylee from July to December 2008 when she was believed to be missing, sued Anthony for fraud and unjust enrichment. TES estimates that it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead. TES founder and director Tim Miller estimates that the abortive search for Caylee expended 40% of the group's yearly resources which could have been spent looking for other missing children. It only learned that Anthony knew all along that Caylee was dead when the trial began. TES and Anthony eventually settled out of court on October 18, 2013. TES was listed as a creditor to Anthony and was entitled to $75,000. \\"Caylee's Law\\" Since the end of the trial, various movements have arisen for the creation of a new law, called \\"Caylee's Law\\", that would impose stricter requirements on parents to notify law enforcement of the death or disappearance of a child. One such petition, circulated via Change.org, has gained nearly 1.3 million electronic signatures. In response to this and other petitions, lawmakers in four states‚ÄîFlorida, Oklahoma, New York, and West Virginia‚Äîhave begun drafting versions of \\"Caylee's Law\\". The law in Oklahoma would require a child's parent or guardian to notify police of a missing child within 24 hours, and would also stipulate a time frame for notification of the disappearance of a young child under the age of 12. The Florida law would make it a felony if a parent or legal guardian fails to report a missing child in timely manner if they could have known the child would be in danger. The call for mandatory reporting laws has been criticized as being \\"reactive, overly indiscriminating and even counterproductive\\". One critic noted the law could lead to overcompliance and false reports by parents wary of becoming suspects, wasting police resources and leading to legitimate abductions going uninvestigated during the critical first few hours. Additionally, innocent people could get snared in the law for searching for a child instead of immediately calling police.Radley Balko, Why 'Caylee's Law' Is A Bad Idea, Huffington Post, July 11, 2011. Memorials and tribute songs Different artists have written songs in Caylee's memory. Jon Whynock performed his own version at her memorial service in February 2009, and Rascal Flatts' Gary LeVox collaborated with country comedian and radio host Cledus T. Judd and songwriter Jimmy Yeary to write a song titled \\"She's Going Places\\" in Caylee's memory. Later information In November 2012, WKMG-TV television in Orlando reported that police never investigated Firefox browser evidence on Casey's computer the day of Caylee's death; they only looked at Internet Explorer evidence. The browser history showed that someone at the Anthony household, using a password-protected account Casey used, did a Firefox Google search for \\"foolproof suffocation\\" at 2:51 p.m. and then clicked on an article criticizing pro-suicide websites promoting \\"foolproof\\" ways to die, including the idea of committing suicide by taking poison and putting a plastic bag over one's head. The browser then recorded activity on MySpace, a site used by Casey but not George. The station learned about this information from Casey's attorney Jose Baez who mentioned it in his book on the case, speculating that George had contemplated suicide after Caylee's death. He conceded to reporters that the records are open to interpretation; however, he speculated that the state may have chosen not to introduce the search at trial because, according to Baez, the computer records tend to refute the timeline stated by George, which was that Casey left at 12:50 p.m. An analysis by John Goetz, a retired engineer and computer expert in Connecticut, revealed that her password- protected computer account shows activity on the home computer at 1:39 p.m., with activity on her AIM account, as well as MySpace and Facebook.Tony Pipitone, Cops, prosecutors botched Casey Anthony evidence Computer search for 'foolproof suffocation' never found , WKMG-TV, November 20, 2012. In April 2016, transcripts of two 2015 affidavits of private investigator Dominic Casey were filed on the court docket in the matter of Kronk v. Anthony and picked up by news services in May 2016. In one affidavit, Casey stated that on July 26, 2008, Baez admitted to him that Casey Anthony murdered Caylee Anthony \\"and dumped the body somewhere and, he needed all the help he could get to find the body before anyone else did\\". He also claimed that Baez had a sexual relationship with Anthony, and that \\"Casey told me she had to do what Jose said because she had no money for her defense.\\" Baez \\"vehemently\\" denied a sexual relationship. In January 2020, Kronk lost an appeal of his defamation case against Anthony and her attorneys. A US District Court judge upheld a lower court finding that there was not enough evidence to prove she willfully defamed Kronk.

There is a park called the Mount Rogers Reserve at the crest of the hill, and a trig point at the summit. Location and features The suburbs of , , and are situated on its slopes. Mount Rogers has several significant rocky outcrops around the area which are predominantly made up of dacite, indicating the area's volcanic past. Small boulders are also common and the soil is generally rocky and thin. The area contain approximately 50 two-hundred-year-old eucalypts. The stumps of even larger older trees indicate that, prior to European settlement, the landscape would have been an open grassy woodland. Many new trees and shrubs were planted in the early 1970s as the suburbs' houses were built around the rather treeless hill. Mount Rogers has a popular walking track, approximately 2.5 km in length, around its perimeter which offers beautiful views of Lake Ginninderra, the Brindabellas, and Hall. Regular walkers and other locals care about this 64 hectare (approx.) piece of land and its bird, reptile, plant and mammal species, and this interest has promoted community spirit and monthly working bees. The area has a Landcare group, Mt Rogers Landcare, which has a blog where the groups' coordinator's newsletters are posted periodically. Superb Parrots and Tawny Frogmouths have been regular (bird) visitors to Mt Rogers in recent years, as recorded on the blog and its pages. Mt Rogers has been an off-lead dog space for forty years. The off-lead aspect of Mt Rogers is most valued by the residents of the four suburbs bordering Mt Rogers. The community is grateful for the opportunity to allow their dogs to walk freely and enjoy the socialisation of other dogs and people. Etymology Mount Rogers is named after John Core Rogers (c. 1898-1971) who was the Commonwealth Surveyor General from 1949‚Äì1963. He also served on the Canberra Building Review Committee, was foundation president of the Canberra Division of the Institute of Surveyors and was instrumental in the formation of the National Mapping Council in 1945.

It is the fourth part of The Mediator series. The novel was first published in 2001 and was the last of the series to appear under the pseudonym Jenny Carroll. In the UK, it was published with the title Young Blood. Synopsis Suze Simon is forced to work a summer job by her stepfather, Andy. She becomes a babysitter at the Pebble Beach Hotel and Golf Resort, where her usual charge is moody eight- year-old Jack Slater. Suze soon realizes that Jack is miserable because he is a mediator like her, and teaches him that ghosts do not mean to do any harm, but just want help to go to the afterlife. This cheers him up greatly and begins to bring him out of his shell. His older brother, Paul, is impressed by the change in his brother's behaviour and asks Suze to join them for dinner, but she refuses and avoids talking to him. Suze's routine is interrupted when Andy and her stepbrother Brad, while renovating the backyard, dig up letters from a person named Maria de Silva to her fiance, Hector de Silva. Suze realizes that these letters belonged to Jesse, but she is threatened by Maria's ghost, who does not want anyone to find the letters and starts harassing Suze's family. Suze begins to fear that if they find Jesse's remains in the backyard, he will move on to the next world and leave her. She attempts to bring the letters to the Carmel Historical Center, where the conservator, Dr. Clive Clemmings, expresses his belief that Jesse was not murdered but ran away from his wedding. Suze notices Maria's picture and a portrait of Jesse in the museum. The following day, Suze is confronted by the police, who inform her that Clemmings is dead and Hector de Silva's portrait is missing. Paul stops them from questioning her further, saying that he can \\"attract more flies with honey rather than vinegar\\", and she finally agrees to go on a date with him. As Suze returns home from the date, Andy and Brad unearth Jesse's remains in the backyard. Suze reassures herself when she can't find Jesse's ghost, hoping that he is only away for a time. Jack then calls her to inform her of his successful exorcism of the \\"ghost who was bothering Suze\\" for a long time. Horrified, Suze attempts to sneak out of the house to find out more, but is attacked by Maria de Silva and Felix Diego, Maria's late husband, who helped to murder Jesse. They try to kill her, but only give her a concussion by throwing her in the backyard hole. The next day, Suze orders Jack to exorcise her. She believes that if she finds Jesse in the otherworld, she can bring him back. Father Dominic tries to stop Suze, but eventually relents to a 'proper Catholic exorcism' in the Mission. Suze is given thirty minutes to find Jesse and come back, or she will die. Arriving on the \\"other side\\", Suze finds Jesse. He initially thinks that Suze exorcised him and then becomes concerned about her safety, attempting to bring her back. However, they become lost because Maria has arrived at the Mission and cut the rope connecting Suze to the living world. Paul, who is revealed as a mediator, appears and taunts them. Suze realizes that Paul has been working with Maria and Felix, using their date to stop her from preventing Jesse's exorcism. Jesse, furious with Paul's selfish outlook on the mediator \\"gift\\", punches him. They barely make it back to the Mission, only to find Maria and Felix Diego attacking Father Dom. Suze manages to exorcize Maria and Felix, and Jesse decides to stay in the living world. The Slaters leave the hotel soon afterwards, leaving Suze a large tip, and Paul leaves her a particularly cryptic letter. As Suze goes up, she finds Jesse wanting to talk. She refuses, for fear of confessing her feelings, but Jesse kisses her. 2001 American novels American young adult novels Novels by Meg Cabot Ghost novels Works published under a pseudonym ","title":"Darkest Hour (Cabot novel)"},{"id":"18793702","text":"is a railway station on the Nanao Line in the town of Tsubata, Kahoku District, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).

This game is valuable for enhancing calculating and strategical ability.  Board, pieces, and players  * A rectangle which is divided into ten squares (5x2) with two semicircles at each end is drawn on the floor or the yard. The ten squares are called \\"rice field square\\", \\"fish pond square\\" or \\"citizen square\\" and the two semicircles are called \\"Mandarin squares\\". * Pieces may be stones, fruit seeds or any other small things. * Two players or two teams sit in two sides of the board. Each controls one side of the board. History The game's origin is still a mystery to the Vietnamese people, as it has been played for many years. Many people say that Vietnamese ancestors were inspired by green rice fields to invent a game that could be played in those huge fields. At first, the game had become quite popular throughout the country. However, as time passed Vietnamese children no longer had the same passion for the game like those in the past. For this reason, the Vietnam Museum of Ethnology is exhibiting the game with fully explained instructions with the aim of keeping the game alive among children nowadays. According to many researchers, √î ƒÇn Quan belongs to Mancala.  Rules   Setup  Each player places one big stone or ten small stones (called the \\"Mandarin piece\\") in the Mandarin square as well as five small stones (called \\"citizen pieces\\") in each of the rice field squares.  Object  The game ends when all the pieces are captured. If both Mandarin pieces are captured, the remaining citizen pieces belong to the player controlling the side that these pieces are on. There is a Vietnamese saying to express this situation: \\"h·∫øt quan, t√†n d√¢n, thu qu√¢n, b√°n ru·ªông\\" (literally: \\"Mandarin is gone, citizen dismisses, take back the army, selling the rice field\\") or \\"h·∫øt quan, t√†n d√¢n, thu qu√¢n, k√©o v·ªÅ\\" (literally: \\"Mandarin is gone, citizen dismisses, take back the army, retreat\\") Whichever player has more pieces is the winner (a Mandarin piece is equal to ten or five citizen pieces). Scattering Players play rock paper scissors to determine the first player. The first player takes up all the pieces of any rice field square on his/her side of the board and distributes (Vietnamese: r·∫£i: literally: scatter) one piece per square, starting at the next square in either direction. When all pieces are distributed, the player repeats by taking up the pieces of the following square and distributing them. If his/her side of the board is empty, he/she must use five previously-won pieces to place one piece in each square on his/her side before repeating the distribution. (If he/she do not possess any pieces, he/she must borrow a piece from the other player and return it when counting the points at the end of the game.) Capturing When the next square to be distributed is empty, the player wins all the pieces in the square after that. A square that contains a lot of pieces is the nh√† gi√†u square (literally: rich square). When the next square is an empty Mandarin square, or the next two squares are empty, it becomes the other player's turn. In some game variations, the Mandarin square can contain little citizen pieces called quan non (literally: quan: Madarin, non: young/unripen) which may not be captured.  Song  The children song (Vietnamese: ƒë·ªìng dao) is used when playing this game: :H√†ng tr·∫ßu h√†ng cau The betel stall, the areca nut stall :L√† h√†ng con g√°i Be stalls of girls :H√†ng b√°nh h√†ng tr√°i The cake stall, the fruit stall :L√† h√†ng b√† gi√† Be stalls of old women :H√†ng h∆∞∆°ng h√†ng hoa The incense stall, the flower stall :L√† h√†ng c√∫ng Ph·∫≠t. Be stalls for offering the Buddha.  In science  * M·∫°c Hi·ªÉn T√≠ch invented s·ªë ·∫©n (negative numbers) from the rules of this game.  In literature * Saying: \\"M·ªôt ƒë·∫≠p ƒÉn quan\\" - literally: \\"one move captures Mandarin piece\\": expressing a successful result getting from a simple act.
