It is similar to other hammer orchids in that it is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. The glossy- leaved hammer orchid was the first in the genus to be described. The species is only known from the far south-west of the state and has been declared \\"endangered\\" by both the Australian government and the government of Western Australia.  Description  Drakaea elastica is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter, glabrous, light green and glossy. The leaf veins are slightly darker in colour. Leaves appear in July or August but by the time the flower has opened, the leaf is often withered. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. Its flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp, in this case Zaspilothynnus gilesi. It can be distinguished from other species by its lack of a spine on the column. The flowers of Drakaea glyptodon and Drakaea concolor also lack a spine but can be distinguished from this species by having a dark green leaf (D. concolor) or distinct veins in the leaf (D. glyptodon). The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a \\"head\\" about half as long as the \\"body\\" and is light coloured and hairy for most of it length. The rest of the labellum (representing the female \\"body\\" of the insect) is light green on the upper half, with a few scattered dark spots while the lower half is dark maroon. Flowers appear from late September to early November.  Taxonomy and naming  Drakaea elastica was first formally described by John Lindley in 1840 in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. Since then the name has been misapplied to other hammer orchids, including the more common one known as warty hammer orchid (Drakaea livida). The specific epithet (elastica) is derived from the Ancient Greek word elastikos meaning \\"elastic\\".  Distribution and habitat  The glossy-leaved hammer orchid is only known from the Cataby and Busselton districts in the Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic zone. It grows in deep sand in woodland in low-lying areas near temporary swamps.  Conservation  Drakaea elastica is known from 42 locations but most of these contain fewer than 15 plants and only one contains half of the known individual plants. The Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife classifies the species as \\"threatened\\" meaning that it is considered likely to become extinct, or rare and in need of special protection. The Australian Government lists its status under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as \\"vulnerable\\". The main threats to the species' survival include weed invasion, recurrent fire, dieback disease, rubbish dumping and illegal vehicle usage.

The island forms the head of Binagasbasan Bay, bordered to the west by the Lamit Islands and to the east by Quinalasag Island, and which opens northward to the Philippine Sea. It is designated as a protected landscape and seascape on account of its biodiversity and ecological significance. Geography Malabungot is one of several small islands lying off the coast of Caramoan Peninsula shared between the municipalities of Garchitorena, Caramoan and Lagonoy in the Partido District of Camarines Sur. It belongs administratively to the Garchitorena barangay of Binagasbasan along with the Lamit Islands, and Pawican and Puling islets in Lamit Bay. The island is largely flat and measures long and wide at its widest point. It is situated on the edge of a shore reef in an irregular-shaped bay lying between Quinalasag and Lamit Islands, which are two small islands separated by a narrow impassable channel. It is approximately from the mainland of Garchitorena. Conservation The island comprises of lowland evergreen forests and sandy beaches. It is part of a wilderness area established in 1981 comprising the Malabungot, Basot and Quinalang (Quinalasag) islands of Camarines Sur. The area is known for its diverse ecosystems such as vast mangrove forests, seagrass beds and hard coral reefs which serve as feeding and breeding ground for a variety of marine life, including green sea turtles, hawksbill sea turtles, whale sharks, manta rays and dugongs. Several other fish species can be seen here including seahorses, giant clams, swordfish, snappers, groupers and skates. The wilderness area is also surrounded by thick patches of mangroves that attract birds such as mangrove blue flycatchers, barred rails, zebra doves, kingfishers, Pacific swallows, yellow-vented bulbuls, and chestnut munias. Despite its status as a marine protected area, these habitats are still threatened by human activities, including dynamite and cyanide fishing due to lack of political and financial support resulting to poor governance and enforcement.

Early life and family Born in Christchurch on 18 March 1953, Drysdale grew up on a sheep station near the Rakaia Gorge in the South Island of New Zealand. She was educated at Craighead Diocesan School in Timaru and St. Margaret's College in Christchurch. She went on to train as a nurse, specialising in cardiology. In 1973, she married Alexander Drysdale, and the couple went on to have two children. She gave up nursing in 1979. Business career While her children were young, Drysdale decided to start a home-based garment manufacturing business. She called it \\"Snowy Peak\\" and employed outworkers to knit luxury clothes such as jumpers, hats, scarves and gloves for supply to a few Christchurch stores. She started with 10 outworkers, and by 1985, after four years operation, she had 500 working for her. Drysdale experimented with certified organic, eco-friendly wools and cottons. In 1996 she launched the world's first yarn that blended possum fur with merino wool, calling the new yarn \\"merinomink\\". She also began to export her clothes to Australia, Europe, Japan and Canada, expanded operations in Christchurch with a cafe and retail store, and opened stores in Auckland and Queenstown. In 1999 the brand received international attention when it was chosen to provide garments for world leaders attending the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in Auckland. President Bill Clinton particularly admired his sweater, and he and his family became fans and customers. In 2014, Drysdale began using a second new textile which she calls \\"kapua\\" - a mixture of cashmere, silk and possum - which had been in development since 2000. Charity foundation In 2000, Drysdale founded the \\"Untouched World Foundation\\", a charitable trust which is focused on developing sustainable leadership in young people. One percent of the retail sales from Untouched World contribute to the foundation. Since 2002, students involved in the programme have worked on a nature programme based at Blumine Island in the Marlborough Sounds. After several years' work the island achieved predator-free status and kiwi were released there in 2010.

It is also a member of the Association for Theological Education in South East Asia. The CGST campus on Devon Road, Kowloon Tong History CGST started in 1975. In the mid 1960s, a group of students at Westminster Theological Seminary developed the idea of establishing \\"an indigenous, inter- denominational, evangelical and graduate level theological institution for the purpose of training university graduates to serve the churches in China and to evangelize around the world.\\" This group included Jonathan Chao (who became the first President) and Che Bin Tan. Tan had noticed that \\"in America, seminaries assume that the spiritual needs of students will be met through their church involvement\\". Thus, \\"a major aim of CGST, in reaction against the perceived neglect in America of the students' spiritual growth, has been to incorporate the spiritual dimension more effectively in the lives of the students.\\" CGST has also been \\"working at specialized approaches to reach blue collar workers,\\" including the composition of Christian hymns \\"using well known Chinese folk tunes\\". According to its mission statement, CGST upholds the \\"absolute truth of the Bible's inerrancy\\", and \\"works toward a contextual theology that is relevant to and brings transformation to Chinese culture.\\" It also values expository preaching and spiritual formation.

He was born at Wollongong to builder Robert Osborne and Rebecca Musgrave. He became a solicitor's clerk before joining the Wesleyan ministry. On 9 April 1867 he married Elizabeth Wastell, and they soon both departed to Samoa as missionaries. He was sent to Fiji in 1869 and Rotuma in 1870, before his wife's health forced him to return to New South Wales. He was a minister at Adelong, Yass, Newtown and Newcastle before his appointment to York Street, the colony's leading Methodist church, in 1883. Osborne's liberal approach to religion and lack of sectarianism achieved the desired effect of increasing church attendance, but it also alienated conservatives. He was charged with heresy after praising Roger Vaughan, the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney; acquitted of the charge, he was nevertheless urged to restrain his preachings. Osborne did not follow this directive, and instead attended the Requiem Mass for Vaughan and supported George Higinbotham and the Australian Church radical Charles Strong. He pre-empted his removal by resigning from the ministry and the church in January 1884. Osborne then became a journalist, working for the Daily Telegraph and also running the non- sectarian Christian Platform, which ran until 1885. By 1886 he was a declared secularist, and had also abandoned his original support for free trade in favour of protectionism. He contested a by-election for the Legislative Assembly seat of Argyle in 1885 as a supporter of Alexander Stuart, and was only narrowly defeated by Sir Henry Parkes. He ran for office twice more, for Northumberland in 1887 and for Goulburn in 1889, without success. He joined the staff of the Sydney Morning Herald in 1886 but by 1889 was working for the protectionist Australian Star, becoming its editor the following year. In 1899 he became secretary of the Public Service Association of New South Wales. Osborne died after a heart attack at Double Bay in 1908.

With flaring deep convection surrounding its LLCC, the JTWC started issuing bulletins and was assigned the designation 19W. Thereafter, both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded 19W to a tropical storm, naming it Vamco. On September 14, deep convection slightly weakened and became displaced near its center, however the environment was still favorable at this moment. A few hours later, the JTWC reported that according to animations, the center of Vamco had become partially exposed and wind shear inhibited further development, which favorable conditions started to fade. Therefore, the JTWC issued its final warning. Vamco made landfall south of Da Nang, Vietnam, and the system was last noted as it dissipated over land on September 15.  Impact  The outer bands of Vamco affected Hainan, causing a damage of ¬•2 million (US$314,000) in economic losses. On September 14, before Vamco made landfall, Da Nang suffered some damage from the storm.B√£o ch∆∞a v√†o, ƒê√† N·∫µng ƒë√£ thi·ªát h·∫°i Over 500 trees were downed in this city and dozens of flights were cancelled.C√¢y xanh ng√£ g·ª•c, ƒë∆∞·ªùng b·ªã chia c·∫Øt sau b√£o V√†m C·ªèhttp://vnexpress.net/tin-tuc/thoi-su/giao-thong/hang-chuc-chuyen-bay-bi-huy- do-bao-3278940.html Vamco made landfall in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, causing floods in central Vietnam.http://nld.com.vn/thoi-su-trong-nuoc/bao-so-3-rat-nguy- hiem-20150914112109033.htm Flooding in Vietnam killed 11 people.

Francois de Vergy was married to Marie de Bourgogne the granddaughter of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. Counts of Champlitte The Counts of Champlitte were: #Francois de Vergy (1530-1591) #Cleriadus de Vergy (d. 1630) #Claude-Francois de Cusance (1590 ‚Äì 1633) #Cleriadus de Cusance (1619 ‚Äì 1635) #Marie Henriette de Cusance (1624 ‚Äì 1701) #Francois de Clermont d‚ÄôAmboise (1632 ‚Äì 1684) #Jean Baptiste de Toulongeon (1677 ‚Äì 1703) #Jean Francois de Toulongeon (1702 ‚Äì 1784) #Jean Ren√© de Toulongeon (1739 ‚Äì 1794) Vergy Vergy The Vergy family were a distinguished and ancient noble house in Franche-Comt√© and Burgundy who numbered among their ancestors both Robert 1, King of France, and Rudolph 1, King of Germany. They were the first historically attested owners of the Turin Shroud (1353). Francois de Vergy had been a page of honour to the Emperor, Charles V, and was Lt General and Governor of the County of Burgundy. In 1584 he was made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Francois de Vergy had two sons, the elder of whom, Claude, died in 1588. His second son, Cleriadus, succeeded his father to the title. He was also Lt General and Governor of the County of Burgundy and in 1615 was made a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He had no children and the title and estate was inherited by his nephew Claude-Francois de Cusance, son of Beatrice de Vergy and Vaudelin-Simon de Cusance, the Baron of Belvoir and a Knight of the Golden Spur, later known as the Count of Champlitte. Cusance Cusance Claude-Francois de Cusance was a distinguished soldier and, as a colonel of the Empire he commanded 3,000 Burgundians in the service of the king of Spain. He had two sons and four daughters. The eldest daughter, Beatrice, married Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine and their descendants include the princely Dukes of Rohan and of Montbazon as well as the mignon Dukes of Joyeuse. The second daughter, Madeleine, married the Count van den Berg, whose descendants through the Hohenzollern dynasty include the emperor of Austria and kings of Bavaria, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain. The third daughter was a nun who founded the convent at Gray, and the last daughter married the Duke of Arenburg and Aarschot, governor of Hainaut. The eldest son died in 1619, and so the title of Count of Champlitte passed in 1633 to the second son, Cleriadus de Cusance. Cleriadus died aged 16 in 1635 in what has been described as ‚Äòmysterious circumstances‚Äô. The estate of Champlitte was briefly held by his sister, Marie Henriette, Duchess d'Arenburg, but with no male heirs in this line of the de Cusance family the title went to Francois de Clermont d‚ÄôAmboise. He was the grandson of Anne de Vergy, younger daughter of Francois de Vergy. His daughter Marie Francoise de Clermont d‚ÄôAmboise married Jean Baptiste de Toulongeon, who became the seventh Count of Champlitte, followed by his son, Jean Francois and his son after him, Jean Ren√© de Toulongeon who died in 1794 with no male heirs. The title Count of Champlitte fell into abeyance in 1790, when titles were first abolished by Napoleon, and has not been used since. Toulongeon Toulongeon The Counts of Toulongeon were a distinguished noble house in Burgundy, with a long military tradition that continued with the revolutionary army, with three of them serving as Generals. A cousin, the Marquis de Toulongeon, was one of Napoleon‚Äôs key aide de camps. The Chateau de Champlitte, which had burnt down in 1751, was rebuilt by the family in the renaissance / neoclassical style. It passed to Count Anne-Alexander de Toulongeon upon the death of his brother Jean Ren√©, and upon his death in 1823 was sold to the town and used as the city hall. In 1907 it was classified as a historic monument and is in use today as a museum. Cussans Cussans The only remaining male line of descent is through Ermenfroy de Cusance (1591-1623), younger son of Vaudelin-Simon de Cusance and Beatrice de Vergy. Some local histories report that Ermenfroy, the Baron of St-Julien and Seigneur of Cusance, had no children, but this is not correct. He had a son who was baptised at the church in Gonsan, Doubs, where the register records: ‚ÄòPedrus, filius Rosae de Fullez donatus qui de St Julien et de Cusance etc, baptizatus 19th May 1619.‚Äô Ermenfroy de Cusance was a Captain of Horse in the service of Spain in the Savoy and Flanders. He died in 1623, aged 32. The descendants of Ermenfroy, through Pierre de Cusance, left France for the New World and settled in Jamaica, originally a Spanish colony, subsequently taken by the British in 1655. They were successful planters who over five generations built up substantial sugar works in St Thomas in the East. Their descendants left Jamaica for England. Thomas Cussans of Amity Hall, Jamaica was granted Arms by the College of Arms in 1767. In the Letters Patent it states: \\" .. That He and his Family have used a Coat of Arms and Crest as from their Ancestors but not finding the same duly registered in the Heralds office .. did therefore humbly request the Favour of His Lordship's Warrant for our granting .. Arms and Crest as He and They may lawfully bear and use ..\\" The Arms granted are \\"Or (gold background), an Eagle, displayed Gules (red), armed and langued Azure (blue claws and tongue)\\".

Ten Finnish fashion designers, such as Mert Otsamo, Tyra Therman, Outi Pyy, participated in the Monokini 2.0 project and together designed a swimwear collection. This swimwear is targeted for women who have experienced breast cancer and mastectomies. The collection was photographed by Finnish photographer Pinja Valja ]in collaboration with Haikala and Metteri and is modeled by 10 breast cancer survivors. The photographs form a collection that has been exhibited in various galleries in and outside of Finland. Monokini 2.0 charity Catwalk Show was held in the Yrj√∂nkatu Swimming Hall on 30 August 2014. The show was the first time that the swimwear collection was publicly showcased. Dystopia/utopia Dystopia/utopia is a social art project based on photography and scenario work. The project is created together with 12-17 year-olds who are at risk of becoming marginalized. Working together with Nutty tarts and American photographer Gabriel Mellan, the youngsters used photography to visualize their outlook on life through the concepts of dystopia and utopia. Together with a picture representing the present of each young participant, the dystopian and utopian images formulate a triptych. The Dystopia/Utopia project was carried out in 2013 and 2014 with the support of Kone Foundation at the Saari Residence in Myn√§m√§ki, Finland. The project is continuing in September and October 2015 in Helsinki with funding from the Myrsky project. Hairy Underwear Hairy Underwear is an undergarment collection designed by the Nutty Tarts including underpants, undershirts and leggings. The collection is sold in the Hairy Underwear online webstore and shipped globally. The collection is designed to provoke discussion about suppressive norms, gender issues and the narrow idea about ideal beauty.

Detail of the top of the Cenotaph The Cenotaph in the southern New Zealand city of Dunedin stands in the centre of Queen's Gardens, close to the city centre. It is the city's main war memorial. Location and dedication The cenotaph stands in Queen's Gardens, an open park lying between The Exchange and the Toit≈´ Otago Settlers Museum. This location is close to the heart of the city, some south of the city centre, The Octagon. Dunedin's renovated Warehouse Precinct lies immediately to the south. One-way streets which form part of SH 1 flank the gardens on its east and west boundaries. The monument commemorates Dunedin members of New Zealand's armed forces who perished in the First and Second World Wars. A separate standing plaque (formerly situated close to Dunedin Railway Station in Anzac Square) stands close to the cenotaph and lists the names of all of New Zealand's Victoria Cross recipients.

The winning entry was designed by Aucklander William Gummer (of the firm of Gummer and Ford), who also designed several other memorials, most notably the Bridge of Remembrance in Christchurch.Cenotaph in Queen's Gardens\\", Dunedin City Council. Retrieved 12 November 2015. The monument is built from concrete with a facing of Carrara marble, and was conceived by Gummer as a tall eight-sided column, this design reflecting Dunedin's octagonal city centre and being appropriate for an irregularly shaped site, and is topped by a symbolic beacon. From the central column, a sacrificial urn and four crosses emerge, representing sacrifice. These, along with a relief frieze on the base featuring a lion, torches, laurel wreathes, and fasces, were designed by sculptor Richard Oliver Gross. The original intention was for a bronze frieze to surround the base, but a funding shortfall forced this to be abandoned. The foundation stone was laid by Dunedin mayor Harold Livingstone Tapley in 1924. Several historic documents were placed in a capsule under the stone, including histories of the military in Otago and copies of current newspapers. The finished memorial was unveiled on 17 March 1927 by Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI) in a ceremony attended by 1,000 relatives of the fallen and 800 returned servicemen, along with many members of the general public. Initially known as \\"The Citizens' Memorial\\", it rapidly became known as The Cenotaph (echoing the name of Sir Edwin Lutyens' monument in Whitehall, London) despite not being of the classic \\"empty tomb\\" design normally used for structures of this name. A plaque commemorating the fallen of World War Two was added to the memorial at the conclusion of that conflict. Use and recent history The cenotaph is the regular venue of Dunedin's Anzac Day commemorations, which often attract several thousand members of the public. On 25 April 2015, the centennial commemoration of Anzac Day, a record crowd estimated at close to 20,000 people attended the dawn commemoration service at the cenotaph.Video: Dunedin's 'record' Anzac Day turnout, 3news.co.nz, 25 April 2015.

In the wake of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, seismic assessments have been made of many New Zealand buildings and monuments.

Raised in 1868, it provided engineers for two London infantry divisions of the Territorial Force during World War I. In World War II it operated as an RE headquarters, particularly on D-Day and at the Rhine Crossing, while its subordinate companies served in a number of campaigns, including the Siege of Tobruk and with the Chindits. Its successor unit continues to serve in today's Army Reserve. Origin The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. One such unit was the 1st Tower Hamlets Engineer Volunteer Corps (EVC) formed at Cannon Street Road, Whitechapel, in the Tower Hamlets district of East London. The first officers' commissions were issued on 20 June 1861.Beckett, Appendix IX.Westlake, p. 14.1st London Engineers at Regiments.org Administratively, the unit was attached to the 1st Middlesex EVC in 1863, and in 1865 it moved to a new HQ at Gretton Place, Victoria Park Square, in Bethnal Green. However, the London Gazette for 9 October 1868 announced the disbandment of the 1st Tower Hamlets EVC and simultaneously the formation of a new 2nd Tower Hamlets (East London) Engineer Volunteers. The officers' commissions for the new unit had been issued on 3 October, and by November the former members of the 1st Corps had been absorbed into the new unit, which also used the Gretton Place headquarters.London Gazette, 9 October 1868.Quarterly Army List. By 1872 the unit consisted of six companies. It was also administratively responsible for the 1st Hampshire (1870‚Äì81) and 1st Northamptonshire (1872‚Äì1901) EVCs and for the Cadet Corps at Bedford Grammar School (1888‚Äì1900). By 1876, it had moved its HQ the short distance to the barracks of the Queen's Own Royal Tower Hamlets Militia Light Infantry (later 5th Battalion, Rifle Brigade) in Victoria Park Square.Barnes, Appendices II & III.Victoria County History at British History Online. 2 November 1889 Vanity Fair sketch of Tower Hamlets Colonel John Thomas North. The EVC titles were abandoned in 1888, when the units became 'Engineer Volunteers, Royal Engineers', proclaiming their affiliation to the Regular Royal Engineers (RE), and then simply 'Royal Engineers (Volunteers)' in 1896. The Tower Hamlets unit was renamed the East London (Tower Hamlets) RE (V) in September 1900.Westlake, pp. 3 & 14. From 1890 until his death in 1903, the commanding officer was Colonel William Whetherly, VD.Whetherly's VD was awarded in 1901 (London Gazette, 5 March 1901). He built a house at 31 Egerton Gardens, Kensington (Survey of London) and when he died in 1903 he was buried at Brompton Cemetery . In 1896 the unit built a new drill hall at Victoria Park Square, next door to the Tower Hamlets Militia Barracks. It became a popular venue for boxing matches in the 1930s. The unit continued to occupy the drill hall into the 1960s. Today the site is occupied by a police station built in 1997.Bethnal Green Drill Hall at Greater London Volunteer TributeLondon Ex-Boxers Association.Boxing History.Cherry, O'Brien & Pevsner, p. 369. The unit sent a detachment of one officer and 25 other ranks to South Africa in 1900 to assist the regular REs during the Second Boer War, and a second detachment went out the following year. Seven of the volunteers died on campaign (see Memorials below).Watson, pp. 42‚Äì3.

No sooner had it reached camp than it received orders to return to London for mobilisation. This process had been carefully planned, so that before war was declared on 4 August the units were already at their war stations, such as guarding vital railway lines, while the rear details at the drill halls completed mobilisation and began recruiting.Grey, pp. 1‚Äì6.Grimwade, pp. 2‚Äì5.Keeson, pp. 1‚Äì4.London Rgt at Long, Long Trail On 15 August the TF was ordered to separate men who had volunteered for overseas service from the Home Service men, and on 31 August it was authorised to begin forming Reserve or 2nd Line units composed of Home Service men and recruits. These were distinguished by the prefix '2/'. Later, the 2nd Line were made ready for overseas service and new Reserve or 3rd Line units were formed to continue to process of training.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. The 1st London Reserve Field Company was later numbered 516th Company before being absorbed into the central training organisation.Discussion of RE TF units at Great War Forum. An additional 1st Line company, the 1/5th, was also raised in September 1914, and joined the 2nd Line companies in 2/1st London Division on 16 November 1915.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 62.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 9‚Äì15. On 4 September the 1st London Bde, with its attached Signal Section, embarked for Malta, to relieve the Regular Army Garrison there. These were the first TF units to go on service overseas.Grey, pp. 6‚Äì7.Grimwade, pp. 5‚Äì7, 14. During the autumn of 1914, 1st London Division was progressively broken up to provide reinforcements for formations serving overseas. 1/1st London Field Company ::See main article 1st London Field Company Royal Engineers 1/1st London Field Company joined the Regular 6th Division in France on 23 December 1914 and remained with that formation throughout the war. When RE field companies were renumbered on 1 February 1917 it became 509th (London) Field Company.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 73‚Äì9. 1/2nd London Field Company In January 1915,1/2nd London Field Company, followed in February by the Signal section from Malta), joined the 29th Division, formed from Regular troops returned from the Empire. They remained with it throughout the war, serving at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. The field company became 510th (London) Field Company in February 1917.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 117‚Äì24. 56th Divisional Engineers 2/1st and 2/2nd London Field Companies and 2/1st London Signal Company served at home with 58th (2/1st London) Division until February 1916, when they left to join 1st London Division (now numbered 56th (1/1st London) Division), which was reforming in France. The signal company was numbered 56th (1st London) Divisional Signals and from February 1917 the field companies were numbered 512th and 513th (London) Field Companies.Ward, Appendix.Martin, Appendix 1. Once in France they were joined by 1/1st Edinburgh Field Company (later 416th (Edinburgh) Field Company), just returned from Egypt, which was attached to 169th (1/3rd London) Brigade.Edmonds, p. 462.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 58 & 69. =Gommecourt= 56th Division's first major operation was the attack on the Gommecourt Salient on 1 July 1916. This was a diversionary attack to support the start of the main offensive on the Somme. The obvious problem was the width of No man's land in front of the division: the troops would have to cross 700 yards to reach the enemy front line. The divisional commander decided to dig a new jumping-off trench 400 yards closer to the enemy. This was done at night under conditions of extreme secrecy, with half of 2/2nd London Field Co engaged in marking out the new line on 25/26 May, and it was dug under their supervision by 167th (1st London) Bde and the pioneer battalion (1/5th Battalion Cheshire Regiment) the following night.Ward, pp. 19‚Äì24.MacDonald, pp. 92‚Äì107.Middlebrook, p. 82. The night before the attack, battalion scouts from 1/14th Londons (the London Scottish), the right-hand battalion, found that the wire in their front had not been adequately cut by the British bombardment. With the help of two men from 2/1st Field Co, the London Scottish successfully exploded two Bangalore torpedoes to clear lanes through the wire.MacDonald, p. 252.Edmonds, pp. 462‚Äì4. For the attack on 1 July, 56th Divisional Engineers had No 2 Company of 5th Battalion, Special Brigade, RE, attached to provide a smokescreen using 4 inch Stokes Mortars and smoke candles. E Section with 12 mortars was attached to 169th (3rd London) Bde, G Section with 8 mortars supported 168th (2nd London) Bde. The company began firing smoke bombs into the German line and lit its candles at 07.20, which provided a smokescreen across the division's attacking front before the artillery barrage lifted and the infantry went 'over the top' at 07.30.MacDonald, p. 262.Ward, pp. 37‚Äì9. The smoke cloud slowly thinned, but it lingered for 45 minutes in the hollow in front of Gommecourt village and Nameless Farm, and on the far right No 20 Sub-section continued firing smoke bombs for 65 minutes. But the mortar positions at the heads of the British communication trenches were prime targets for the German artillery, and several mortar crews became casualties. No 15 Sub-section was supposed to have taken two mortars over to help 169th Bde, but all but two of the 22-man carrying party were hit in the communication trenches and the sub- section was never able to cross No-man's land.MacDonald, p. 290. 168th Brigade was ordered to capture the first three line of German trenches and establish strongpoints on the flanks and at Nameless Farm; 169th Bde was to capture three lines of trenches, establish strongpoints, and then move on to capture the Quadrilateral strongpoint and meet up with 46th (North Midland) Division on the far side of Gommecourt village. Each attacking brigade had a section of an RE field company and a company of pioneers attached to it. The leading battalions of the two attacking brigades succeeded in the first phase of the assault, crossing No man's land behind the smokescreen and seizing the German front line trench comparatively easily. No 1 Section of 2/2nd Field Co accompanied the London Scottish in 168th Bde's attack on the right. Their task was to build trench blocks to the flank and in the communication trenches in front, to hinder German counter-attacks. The first job was to block the front line trench, named 'Fair Trench', while a London Scottish bombing party worked its way along the trench ahead of the sappers. The party blew in four traverses and erected two wire barricades. Other sappers followed the leading London Scottish waves and blocked the second line trench, 'Fancy Trench'.MacDonald, pp. 303‚Äì4.Middlebrook, pp. 146, 171. Behind the London Scottish, two sappers of 1/1st Edinburgh Field Co were due to mark out a new communication trench across No man's land, to be dug by the 1/13th Londons (the Kensingtons). But by now the smokescreen was clearing and the German counter-barrage of artillery and machine-gun fire made this impossible.MacDonald, p. 270. To the rear of 1/5th Londons (the London Rifle Brigade) on 169th Bde's front, pairs of sappers from 1/1st Edinburgh Field Co were similarly marking out two more trenches for 1/3rd Londons to dig. These were successfully marked, and Lance-Corporal Ellis then reconnoitred a German front-line dug-out and reported on it for the staff. However, 1/3rd Londons and their supervising sappers suffered heavy casualties and were unable to begin the digging, while other Edinburgh sappers were prevented from leading carrying parties across to establish dumps of engineering stores in the captured German front line.MacDonald, pp. 299‚Äì302. More Edinburgh sappers were killed while they and the Cheshire Pioneers cleared the Hebuterne‚ÄìGommecourt road through the British lines behind the attack by the 1/12th Londons (The Rangers). Nevertheless, using charges of gun cotton they succeeded in clearing each barricade, opening the road for reserves and supplies.MacDonald, pp. 319‚Äì20. However, little made it across to the two brigades in the German lines. After an initial success, 169th Bde had been held up by the inability of The Rangers of 168th Bde to take Nameless Farm, and both brigades were cut off in the German lines unable to get supplies and reinforcements across the fire-swept No man's land.MacDonald, p. 321.Keeson, p. 161.Wheeler-Holohan & Wyatt, pp. 53‚Äì7. In the afternoon, realising that the Londoners' break-in was an isolated success, and had been contained, the Germans began counter- attacking. By 16.00, the 56th Division had been pushed back to the German front line, where they were running short of men and ammunition. By 21.00, resistance had ended in the German lines, and everybody who could get back had returned to the British lines.Middlebrook, pp. 214‚Äì6.Ward, pp. 41‚Äì2.Edmonds, pp. 471‚Äì3. The three field companies of 56th Divisional Engineers had suffered one officer and 23 other ranks killed or died of wounds, many of those who were killed outright in No Man's land or in the German lines having no known grave and being commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial to the missing of the Somme.MacDonald, Appendix 6. =Further service= 56th Divisional Engineers served through the following further actions during World War I:Ward. * Battle of the Somme ** Battle of Ginchy, 9 September ** Battle of Flers-Courcelette, 15‚Äì22 September ** Battle of Morval, 25‚Äì27 September ** Capture of Combles, 26 September ** Battle of the Transloy Ridges, 1‚Äì9 October 1917 * German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line, 14 March‚Äì5 April * Battles of Arras ** First Battle of the Scarpe, 9‚Äì14 April ** Third Battle of the Scarpe, 3‚Äì4 May * Third Battle of Ypres ** Battle of Langemarck, 16‚Äì17 August * Battle of Cambrai ‚Äì for which the divisional engineers constructed dummy tanks and figures to divert enemy fire.Ward, p. 174. ** Capture of Tadpole Copse, 21 November ‚Äì when 416th (Edinburgh) Fd Co bridged the Canal du Nord and 512th (London) Fd Co repaired the approach road.Ward, pp. 186‚Äì8. ** Capture of Bourlon Wood, 23‚Äì28 November ‚Äì during the defence of Tadpole Copse against German counter-attacks, the Signal Company erected their wireless masts despite the barrage and maintained contact between the front line and brigade HQ.Wheeler-Holohan & Wyatt, pp. 159‚Äì60. ** German Counter-attacks, 30 November‚Äì2 December 1918 * First Battles of the Somme ** First Battle of Arras, 28 March ‚Äì when the RE formed part of the divisional reserve during the German attack, and had to block communication trenches running back from the front line where the division had been forced to retireWard, pp. 226, 236. * Second Battle of the Somme ** Battle of Albert, 23 August * Second Battles of Arras ** Battle of the Scarpe, 26‚Äì30 August * Battles of the Hindenburg Line ** Battle of the Canal du Nord, 27 September‚Äì1 October ‚Äì where 512nd and 513th (London) Fd Cos had to clear hostile infantry from the canal bank before they could build their bridgesWard, pp. 286‚Äì7.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 28. ** Second Battle of Cambrai, 8‚Äì9 October =Sens√©e Canal= Corporal James McPhie, VC. After the pursuit to the Selle (9‚Äì12 October), 56th Division sent two companies of the 1/2nd Londons over the Sens√©e Canal during the night of 12/13 October using rafts and then a floating bridge constructed by 416th (Edinburgh) Fd Co in the dark while within yards of enemy posts. The 1/2nd Londons captured Aubigny-au- Bac, but the Germans counter-attacked the following morning, and the companies were withdrawn at dusk. That night a fresh patrol went across the footbridge, despite the Germans being within hand grenade range. The bridge broke, and Cpl James McPhie and Spr Cox, of 416th Fd Co, jumped into the water to hold it together. McPhie and his men then set about repairing the bridge after daybreak, while under fire. McPhie and Cox were both mortally wounded, but the bridge held and the bridgehead was maintained until after 56th Division had been relieved by 4th Canadian Division on 14 October. Corporal McPhie was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.Ward, pp. 291‚Äì5.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 263.Grey, pp. 391‚Äì7.McPhie at CWGC During the final Advance in Picardy, the divisional RE were mainly engaged in road repair to enable the division to continue moving forwards.Ward, pp. 281, 296‚Äì7, 305. The 56th Division fought two last battles: * Battle of the Sambre, 4 November * Passage of the Grande Honnelle, 5‚Äì7 November After the Armistice with Germany, 56th Division was employed on road-mending. Its units began to demobilise on 12 December, and the process was complete by 10 June 1919.Ward, p. 314. 58th Divisional Engineers When the 2/1st and 2/2nd London Field Companies transferred from the 58th to the 56th London Division, the 58th Divisional Engineers was left with only the 1/5th London Field Company (numbered 511th in February 1917); the gaps were filled in February 1916 by the 2/1st and 2/2nd Wessex (later 503rd and 504th) Field Companies and 2/1st Wessex (later 58th) Signal Company from the 45th (2nd Wessex) Division, whose infantry had been sent to garrison India.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 55‚Äì60. From August 1915, 58th Division was billeted around Ipswich, digging trenches, manning coastal defences, and training, until July 1916, when it moved to Salisbury Plain for final battle training. The division began embarking for France on 20 January 1917 and by early February it was on the Western Front, where it remained for the rest of the war. 58th Divisional Engineers served through the following actions during World War I: 1917 * German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line, 17‚Äì28 March * Battle of Bullecourt, 4‚Äì17 May * Actions on the Hindenburg Line, 20 May‚Äì16 June * Third Battle of Ypres ** Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, 20‚Äì25 September ** Battle of Polygon Wood, 26‚Äì27 September ** Second Battle of Passchendaele, 26 October‚Äì10 November 1918 * First Battles of the Somme ** Battle of St Quentin, 21 March‚Äì3 April ** Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, 24‚Äì25 April * Battle of Amiens 8‚Äì11 August * Second Battle of the Somme ** Battle of Albert, 22‚Äì23 August ** Second Battle of Bapaume, 31 August‚Äì1 September * Battles of the Hindenburg Line ** Battle of √âpehy, 18 September * Final Advance in Artois and Flanders, 2 October‚Äì11 November. After the Armistice came into force, skilled men began to return home. Full demobilisation got under way in March 1919 and the last units left for England in June. Interwar 56th Division began to reform in April 1920 as part of the reorganised Territorial Army (TA). The signals company became 56th (1st London) Divisional Signals in the newly formed Royal Corps of Signals). Initially the Divisional Engineers consisted of 216th, 217th and 218th (1st London) Field Companies;Titles and Designations. later 219th (London) Field Park Company was added.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 92. In 1935 the two London divisions were reorganised: the headquarters of 47th (2nd London) became HQ 1st Anti-Aircraft Division, and a number of London battalions were converted to air defence roles. The rest were amalgamated into a single London Division. The divisional engineers were provided from the 47th (descended from the 1st Middlesex EVC) leaving those of 56th Division surplus: they became a corps engineer unit under the title of 56th Corps Troops RE (CTRE). With the expansion of the TA after the Munich Crisis, the unit became 1st London CTRE and formed a duplicate 2nd London CTRE (less some elements that went back to the reformed 56th Division).Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 99, 133‚Äì4. World War II The two units mobilised in September 1939 with the following organisation: 1st London Corps Troops Engineers (Bethnal Green) * 216th (1st London) Army Field Company * 217th (1st London) Army Field Company * 218th (1st London) Army Field Company * 219th (London) Army Field Park Company 2nd London Corps Troops Engineers (Barnet) * 294th Army Field Company * 295th Army Field Company * 296th Army Field Company * 297th Army Field Park Company 1st London CTRE 1st London CTRE's companies were dispersed after mobilisation and assigned to other HQs. 216th, 217th and 218th (1st London) Companies joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, 216th with General Headquarters (GHQ), 217th with III Corps and 218th with Lines of Communications (LoC).Watson & Rinaldi, p. 162.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp 23‚Äì4. After the Dunkirk evacuation, 216th and 217th Companies went to the Middle East with III CTRE, which was disbanded in April 1942. 218th Company served with British Troops Northern Ireland in 1940‚Äì41, then in Gibraltar 1942‚Äì44. On 21 April 1945 the company arrived in India and moved to the Ranchi area where it served as part of 101 LoC Area. It was back in Gibraltar in 1946. =Tobruk= 219th (London) Field Park Company did not go to France, but remained in the London area, assigned to IV Corps after Dunkirk. Later it was sent to Egypt where it joined 6th Division on 29 July 1941.Joslen, pp. 49‚Äì50. The division was progressively shipped into the besieged Libyan port of Tobruk during September and October 1941 to relieve the mainly Australian garrison, and it was redesignated 70th Division on 10 October to deceive Axis intelligence. The division's role was to prepare for a breakout to meet the planned offensive by the British Eighth Army, but the engineers were also involved in strengthening the defences, building an underground hangar for the Desert Air Force, and clearing enemy minefields (making a study of the new Teller mine).Pakenham- Walsh, Vol VIII, pp 344‚Äì5. =Chindits= Once Tobruk was relieved, 70th Division moved back to Egypt, and after a short spell in Syria, it went by sea to India, arriving in March 1942. In September 1943 the division was broken up and its units handed over to 'Special Force' (the 'Chindits'). 219th Company was redesignated 219th Special Field Park Company on 1 January 1944. The company as a whole appears to have remained with Special Force HQ, but detachments may have flown into Burma with the Long Range Penetration columns during the Second Chindit Operation.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 225.Kirby, Appendix 16, pp. 484‚Äì5. The company dropped \\"Special\\" from its title on 15 March 1945 and arrived in the Ranchi area under the command of Army Troops. It was assigned 36th Indian Division at Poona on 22 June 1945, and was disbanded in 1946. 2nd London CTRE The 2nd Line companies of 2nd London CTRE remained in London District until May 1940, when they too were dispersed. =Iceland= 294th Field Company was sent to Iceland with Alabaster Force in June 1940, where it was engaged in building a new airfield near Reykjavik, which involved floating a concrete runway over a peat bog using a base of cut- down concrete drums covered with rolled local lava.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 167.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 529‚Äì30. Most of Alabaster Force was provided by 49th (West Riding) Division, and 294th Field Company remained with this division when the force was relieved and returned to the UK in April 1942.Joslen, pp. 79‚Äì80. =North Africa= 295th Field Company was also assigned to IV Corps after Dunkirk, and went to North Africa late in 1940. During the retreat to the Egyptian frontier after the German intervention in March 1941 (Operation Sonnenblume), 295th Field Company was engaged in destroying port installations and jetties at Bardia and Sollum, putting water supplies out of action and in cratering roads to hinder the Axis advance.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, p. 246. In September 1942 it joined 23rd Independent Armoured Brigade for the Second Battle of El Alamein,Joslen, pp. 170‚Äì1. The company then joined 231st Independent Brigade Group in Sicily in time for the assault landing at Porto San Venere on the Italian mainland on 7 September 1943 (Operation Ferdy). After this, 231 Brigade became an integral part of the 50th Northumbrian Division and was recalled home with the division, to prepare for Operation OverlordJoslen, pp. 81‚Äì2. Sappers of 294th Field Company building a Bailey bridge across the Antwerp‚ÄìTurnhout Canal, 9 October 1944. =North West Europe= 294th Field Company landed in Normandy on 12 June 1944 and fought through the campaign in North West Europe until VE Day as part of 49th (West Riding) Divisional Engineers.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 141.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 334‚Äì7. 295th Field Company landed on D-day (6 June) as part of 50th (Northumbrian) Division's assault on Gold Beach and fought through the rest of the campaign. When 50th Division was broken up for reinforcements at the end of 1944, the divisional engineers continued as 50th GHQ Troops RE (GHQTRE), and were heavily involved in the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder).Joslen, pp. 581‚Äì6. 297th Corps Field Park Company had been assigned to 15th (Kent) GHQTRE and on D-day was assisting 102 Beach Sub-area (the RE organisation supporting 3rd Canadian Division's assault on Juno Beach). Thereafter, it served through the campaign with 15th (Kent) GHQTRE, including the assault crossing of the River Seine at Vernon by 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, and Operation Plunder. 18th (1st London) GHQTRE Meanwhile, the HQs of 1st and 2nd London Corps Engineers had re- amalgamated in 1943 and become 18th (1st London) GHQTRE. In the North West Europe campaign it had the following units under command at various times:Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 366.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 121, 155‚Äì6, 160. * 74th Field Company * 84th Field Company * 91st Field Company * 173rd Field Company * 213th (North Midland) Field Company * 940th Inland Water Transport Company) Of these, 74th, 84th and 91st were former Chemical Warfare Companies converted into Field Companies in 1943, while 173rd (a former Railway Tunnelling Company) and 213th had been brought back from the Italian Front. =D-day= Troops of 3rd Division on Queen Red beach, Sword area, circa 08.45 on 6 June 1944. In the foreground are sappers of 84 Field Company RE, part of No.5 Beach Group, identified by the white bands around their helmets. On D-Day, 18th GHQTRE provided the RE HQ for 101 Beach Sub-area (5 and 6 Beach Groups) supporting 3rd Division's assault on Sword Beach: * 84th Field Company * 91st Field Company * 8th & 9th Stores Sections * 50th Mechanical Equipment Section * 205th Works Section * 654th Artisan Works Company * 722nd Artisan Works Company * Two Advanced Park Sections of 176th Workshops and Park Company * 49th Bomb Disposal Section * 999th Port Operating Company * 1028th Port Operating Company After the success of the landings, 18th GHQTRE reverted to commanding its own units, except 940th Inland Water Transport Company, which transferred to 9th Port Operating Group after D-Day. =Operation Goodwood= Vehicles move over 'London Bridge' on the Orne during Operation Goodwood, 18 July 1944 The next major engineering operation was to strengthen existing bridges (such as Pegasus Bridge) and build new ones over the River Orne and Caen Canal in preparation for Operation Goodwood. 18th GHQTRE was one of the RE assigned to I Corps for this work, which had to be carried out in secrecy on the night of 17/18 July, but required much preparation in road building and mine clearing, as well as bringing up and concealing the bridging material.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 365‚Äì7. =Rhine crossing= Sappers complete the approach road to 'Waterloo Bridge', 27 March 1945 Later in the campaign, 18th GHQTRE was involved in bridging operations after the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder). It was given the task of building a Class 9 Folding Boat Equipment (FBE) bridge for XXX Corps codenamed 'Waterloo' immediately after the assault on the night of 23/24 March. The original site was near Rees, but this had not been cleared by morning and on 24 March all that could be done was some work on the approaches and to send an officer's patrol across to reconnoitre the proposed exits. Next morning it was decided to move the bridge to a site downstream near Honnopel. Work started at 09.30 on 25 March, shielded by a smokescreen, and the bridge opened for traffic at midnight. Shortly before this, a low-flying German aircraft attacked 213rd Field Company working on the far side of the bridge, but was driven off.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 489, 501. Once the bridges were in place, the RE had to provide protection for them. In conjunction with the Royal Navy, they constructed booms across the river to prevent the enemy floating boats or mines downstream to damage the bridges. In XXX Corps' sector, 18th GHQTRE was instructed to build two 'Arrow' booms devised by the engineers of US Seventh Army. However, the RE had problems with this design, and instead stretched one of steel wire rope and Jerricans across the river well upstream of Rees.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 503. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the unit was reformed as 114 (1st London) Army Engineer Regiment at Bethnal Green with 216‚Äì8 Field Squadrons and 219 Field Park Squadron. The regiment was assigned to 27 Engineer Group. In 1956 it was redesignated as a Field Engineer Regiment, and again in 1961 as a Corps Engineer Regiment, when 216 and 219 Sqns were disbanded.80‚Äì117 RE Rgts at British Army 1945 on.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 293. In addition, the London Corps TREs together with the former 47th (London) Divisional RE formed 121 Construction Regiment, RE, based at the Chelsea HQ of the latter unit. Between 1950 and 1961 121 Rgt's companies were progressively absorbed into the new unit at Chelsea, 101 Field Engineer Regiment.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 295.118‚Äì432 Rgts RE at British Army 1945 onwards. When the TA was converted into the TAVR in 1967, the regiment was reduced to B Company (1st London Engineers) in the short-lived London Yeomanry and Territorials. In 1969 it moved into 73 Regiment, RE, regaining an historic number as 217 (London) Field Squadron. While most of the regiment was based in the Midlands, 217 Sqn remained in London, now at 65 Parkhurst Road, Holloway.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 314‚Äì5, 320. Its role was as a reinforcement combat engineer unit to support I Corps in British Army of the Rhine.217 Sqn site Later, while the rest of 73 Regiment converted to the air support role, 217 Sqn converted to explosives ordnance disposal (EOD) in 1975 and in 1988 joined 101 (City of London) Engineer Regiment (an EOD regiment descended from the 1st Middlesex Engineers). More recently it has been part of 33 Engineer Regiment (EOD). The latter is a hybrid unit, containing both Regular and Reserve subunits. 217 Squadron is based at Ilford in London and Southend-on- Sea in Essex. Under the Army 2020 reorganisation, the squadron is due to open a new centre in Wimbish, also in Essex.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 316‚Äì7, 320.33 Engr Rgt at British Army WebsiteArmy 2020 Reserve Structure and Basing Changes at British Army Website Honorary Colonel The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * Alexander Angus Croll (1811‚Äì87), a chemical engineer and director of several gas works and telegraph companies, was appointed hon colonel of the 2nd Tower Hamlets (East London) EVC on 28 September 1869.Roberts, appendicesGrace's Guide * Colonel R.H.

The creative leaders of the project are two Finnish artists, Katriina Haikala and Vilma Metteri, also known as the art duo The Nutty Tarts (fin. T√§r√§ht√§neet √§mm√§t). Background Ten Finnish fashion designers participated in the Monokini 2.0 project and together designed an haute couture swimwear collection. These swimwears are targeted for women who have experienced breast cancer and have undergone through different operations and changes and in their body, such as mastectomy. The swimwear collection was photographed by a Finnish photographer Pinja Valja together with Haikala and Metteri. The collection is modeled by 10 breast cancer survivors who have gone through mastectomy. One of the models, miss Elina Halttunen, is also the initiator of the whole project. These photographs form a collection of 10 photographs that have been exhibited in and outside Finland. Monokini 2.0 project calls for acceptance and respect for all kinds of human bodies and aims to widen the ideas of a beautiful body. Also, the project challenges the presumptions of what is concerned as nudity and disclosure in the Western culture. The tag line/motto of the Monokini 2.0, \\"Who says you need two\\", condenses the message of the whole project: That women can be beautiful with one breast or with no breast at all and every woman should have the right to decide whether she wants to have breast reconstruction after mastectomy or not.

The park planted with palm and gumbo limbo trees, offers, \\"a stunning vista of Biscayne Bay.\\" The park is located on Biscayne Bay and has several acres of green space, as well as some athletic and recreational facilities including a playground and basketball courts. The park was built as part of the 1972 Parks for People Bond. The park's entrance is located on a secluded extension of Brickell Avenue that is disconnected from the main portion that was formerly signed as U.S. Route 1. Street parking is available and the road is also part of a popular for biking, where two popular routes converge, including the Rickenbacker Causeway. Along with Simpson Park Hammock, Alice Wainwright Park includes a fragment of the once widespread tropical hardwood hammock known as Brickell Hammock. The park was once considered partially responsible for some of the blight in the secluded neighborhood, which has long been home to many wealthy residents, including celebrities. This led to contention over the street parking as higher enforcement and private security were on the rise.

She was the first female Arab filmmaker to have a film, Saat El Tahrir Dakkat or The Hour of Liberation Has Arrived, chosen for the Cannes Film Festival. Srour believed that Arab society oppressed women and kept them in a subordinate role, which prevented them from opportunities to create art. Srour advocated for women's rights through her films, her writing, and by funding other filmmakers. Career Born in 1945 in Beirut, Srour studied sociology at the American University in Beirut and then completed a doctorate in social anthropology at the Sorbonne. Her first film, Bread of Our Mountains (1968, 3', 16mm) was lost during the Lebanese Civil War. In 1974, her film The Hour of Liberation Has Arrived, about an uprising in Oman, was selected to compete at the Cannes Film Festival, making Srour the first Arab woman to have a film selected for the international festival. It is believed that her documentary film The Hour of Liberation Has Arrived was actually the first film by any female filmmaker to be screened at the festival.Stone, Rob, with Paul Cooke, Stephanie Dennison, Alex Marlow-Mann.

He was born in Nandigama village, Krishna district, then in Madras Presidency, British India and now a part of the state of Andhra Pradesh. The Kaleswara Rao market in Vijayawada was named in his honour.  Early life  Rao was born into a family of revenue collectors. He moved with his mother and wife to Machilipatnam where he studied F.A. at Noble College, Machilipatnam. He was taught there by Raghupathi Venkataratnam Naidu. Rao and his friends laid the foundation for Andhra Granthalayodyamam (Library movement) by starting Ram Mohana Granthalayam at Mahatma Gandhi Road, Vijayawada in 1911. He was also the founding member of Vignyana Chandrika, a literary society to fund and encourage original literary works in Telugu and also translations from European and other Indian languages in to Telugu.  Career as a lawyer  Kaleswara Rao moved to Madras along with his mother and wife to join the Law College in early 1904 and studied B.L. until the following year. Thereafter, he rejected opportunities to become Revenue Inspector and District Munsif because he did not want to work for the British Raj. In June 1906, he started his career as a lawyer in Vijayawada. On 21 March 1921, on the instructions on Mahatma Gandhi, he left the legal profession in order to take part in the Indian independence movement and never took it up again.  Political career  Rao was the speaker of Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from 1956 to 1962.

Design The .450 Black Powder Express is a rimmed, straight walled, centerfire rifle cartridge designed for use with blackpowder. It was available in a number of loadings with bullets weighing from , all driven by of black powder. The .450 Nitro for Black is the same cartridge loaded with mild loadings of modern smokeless powder, carefully balanced through trial to replicate the ballistics of the black powder version. History In 19th century Britain there were a large number of straight .450 cartridges developed of varying case lengths up to the 3-inch version. The .450 3-inch Black Powder Express was originally developed as an experimental military cartridge for the 1869 British Army rifle trials that led to adoption of the Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle. The original military trial \\"long chamber\\" cartridge was loaded with a bullet weighing , although for military use it was found to be awkwardly long and difficult to handle and to load, in response Eley Brothers developed the much shorter, bottlenecked .577/450 Martini‚ÄìHenry cartridge. In the 1870s the .450 3-inch \\"long chamber\\" cartridge became the basis for the .450 Black Powder Express when loaded with lighter projectiles fired at higher velocities than the original. The .450 Black Powder Express was the most popular sporting Express cartridge and was manufactured in the UK, France, Germany, Austria and Canada and was readily available in both black powder and Nitro for Black versions well into the 20th century. Parent case Around 1880 this cartridge was necked down to .405 inch to make the .450/400 Black Powder Express which in turn, when loaded with cordite, became the .450/400 Nitro Express which was further developed into the .400 Jeffery Nitro Express. Nitro Express loadings In 1898 John Rigby & Company loaded this cartridge with smokeless cordite to create the .450 Nitro Express, the first Nitro Express cartridge. Use .450/400 & .450 Black Powder Express cartridges. The .450 3-inch Black Powder Express was one of the most popular cartridges ever devised, it was widely used to shoot deer and similar sized game, as well as large dangerous game up to and including elephant. Frederick Selous owned a single barrelled .450 Black Powder Express by Alexander Henry which he used to shoot lion when low on ammunition for his favourite .461 Gibbs No 1 Farquharson rifle. John \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor owned two rifles in .450 Black Powder Express, a single falling block rifle and a double rifle by Holland & Holland, with these rifles he killed elephant, rhinoceros and buffalo shooting 365 grain hardened lead bullets, and lion shooting soft solid lead bullets of the same weight.

Its production has shown a rising trend in the recent years. Within the country, the southwestern and northern regions have the maximum area under cultivation with Kandahar and Samangan province, accounting for much of its production, followed by the provinces of Uruzgan, Kunduz, Balkh, and Saripul. As of 2012, the cultivated area of almonds was 13,490 ha with a yield rate of 45,960 hectograms (one hectogram = 100 grams) per ha, recording a total yield of 62,000 tonnes, with conducive climatic conditions for growing variety of almond landraces of hard shell and soft shell varieties. The preferred markets for the export of Afghan almonds are India and Pakistan, with the former preferred because of better profitability. Varieties Afghan almond with stalk Almond is a fruit crop classified under two types, Amygdalus communis (sweet almonds) and Amygdalus amara (bitter almonds). Under this broad classification, in Afghanistan the almond varieties grown are under two major classes: soft-shell almonds, known locally as badam-e kaghaz (literally, \\"paper almond\\"), which can be easily broken by hand; and hard/medium-shell almonds with the local name of badam-e-sangi (literally, \\"stone almond\\"). These have many sub-types and multiple varieties, such as Sattarbai, which is of the soft-shell class. Sattarbai has other varieties such as Sattarbai Sufi, SattarbaiGuldar, and SattarbaiMamakhail. A study indicates that there are 68 to 99 almond genotypes in the country with varying local names. To enhance production of almonds under the \\"Incentives Driving Economic Alternatives for the North, East and West project\\" (IDEA-NEW), supported by the Agricultural Cooperative Development International and Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (ACDI/VOCA), a non-government organization, was set up in 1997. IDEA-NEW furnished 33,000 almond saplings of the almond varieties Satar Baye, Qambari, Qahar Baye, and Zareer Baye were planted in a area in the northern portion of the country to benefit 100 farmers. This has proven to be generally successful in most of the areas surveyed, with a farmer saying: \\"I am grateful to IDEA-NEW for establishing one big almond orchard for me and providing me with technical assistance on the methods of gardening, like the layout and design of orchard with proper system of irrigation\\". Almond farmers in the province of Uruzgan who have learnt the art of growing almonds in recent times cultivate the crop as a commercial venture, and the almonds they grow are mostly of the bitter variety, which are mixed with the commercially acceptable variety. Roots of Peace, a humanitarian organization working in Afghanistan, introduced bee farms along with almond trees to enhance almond yields, though initially this was not acceptable to the local farmers as they believed that bees would harm the plants. Once introduced, the experiment has proven a success with the yield per tree recording an increase of about 40%. Production and consumption Afghan Almonds Almond production was recorded at 62,000 metric tons during 2012, a 2% increase over the 2011 figure of 60,610 metric tons. Major production took place in the provinces of Samangan, Baghlan, Tahar, and Parwan, with Samangan recording the highest yield. Most of the almonds produced are consumed within the country with only 3% quantity exported. They are marketed both in-shell and shelled. Its export variety is as competitive as the Californian almond and cheaper than the variety marketed by Spain, and therefore exports have a price advantage for export to Central and South Asia.

The objective of the occupational toxicologist is to prevent adverse health effects in workers that arise from exposures in their work environment.Casarett and Doull‚Äôs ,TOXICOLOGY, The Basic Science of Poisons The science of toxicology has many applications. One of these, relates to exposure of people to noxious or hazardous agents during the course of their work. Field of occupational toxicology is the study of the adverse effects of agents that may be encountered by.workers during the course of their employment.Occupational Toxicology, 2nd EDITION, Edited by Chris Winder and Neill Stacey Battery recycling workers are at risk for lead exposure. This worker ladles molten lead into billets in a lead-acid battery recovery facility. The work environment has played a significant role in the occurrence of adverse human health effects due to chemical and biological hazards for centuries. Occupational health specialists, including toxicologists, rely upon human and animal data to determine safe exposure levels. If effects observed in workers can be reproduced in a laboratory animal, it becomes possible to investigate the mechanisms that might reasonably be expected to produce such effects. On the other hand, shedding light on the mechanism by which a designated effect is produced in a test animal species may make it easier to find ways to prevent such effects from occurring in humans. Such an understanding may also help to identify subtle or delayed effects that have not been observed in workers, but to which health professionals should be alerted.PRINCIPLES OF TOXICOLOGY , Environmental and Industrial Applications , SECOND EDITION , Edited by Phillip L. Williams, Exposure Occupational exposures involve situations rangingÿå for example from a secretary using typewriter correction fluid to the loading and off- loading of tanker trucks with thousands of gallons of gasoline.  History  Early writings by Ulrich Ellenbog (1435‚Äì1499), Agricola (1494‚Äì1555), and Paracelsus (1492‚Äì1541) revealed the toxic nature of exposures in mining, smelting, and metallurgy. A systematic treatise by Ramazzini (1633‚Äì1714) described the hazards as they applied to miners, chemists, metal workers, tanners, pharmacists, grain sifters, stonecutters, sewage workers, and even corpse bearers.  Biological monitoring  The measurement of a chemical, its metabolite, or a biochemical effect in a biologic specimen for the purpose of assessing exposure. Biologic monitoring is an important tool to identify the nature and amount of chemical exposures in occupational and environmental situations.CURRENT Occupational & Environmental Medicine,fourth edition Edited by Joseph LaDou Heavy metals Metals with a density of more than 5 g/cm3 and toxic effects. Including arsenic, cobalt, lead, lithium, mercury, and thorium, have documented ototoxic potential. The metals represent a different aspect of toxicology in that they do not undergo breakdown to other metals (to do so would be transmutation of the elements, an old alchemical principle still not possible without huge sources of energy, and a particle accelerator!). The absorption, disposition and excretion of metals are largely dependent on physical factors, such as solubility, ionisation, particle size and chemical species (for metal salts). About 70‚Äì80 elements in the periodic table are considered metals. Groups Ia and IIa, the's block‚Äô metals, form monovalent and divalent cations respectively. Groups IIIb to VIb constitute the ‚Äòp block‚Äô elements, which include metals that can have ions of different valencies. These are called the transition elements. Of the metal elements, about 40 are considered to be ‚Äòcommon‚Äô metals. However, less than 30 have compounds that have been reported to produce toxicity. Metals are probably some of the oldest toxicants known to humans. Health effects such as colic were reported following exposure to lead, arsenic and mercury over 2000 years ago. On the other hand, metals such as cadmium, chromium and nickel belong to the modern era. The importance of some of the rarer metals may become apparent with emerging changes in technology, such as microelectronics and superconductors. The toxicity of a metal is only partially related to its position in the periodic table. Toxicity decreases with the stability of the configuration of electrons in the atomic nuclei. This produces a number of properties that can affect toxicity.Occupational Toxicolog, 2nd EDITION, Edited by Chris Winder and Neill Stacey Solvents The term solvent refers to a class of organic chemicals of variable lipophilicity and volatility. These properties, coupled with small molecular size and lack of charge, make inhalation the major route of exposure and provide for ready absorption across membranes of the lung, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and skin. In general, the lipophilicity of solvents increases with increasing numbers of carbon and/or halogen atoms, while volatility decreases. Organic solvents are frequently used to dissolve, dilute, or disperse materials that are insoluble in water. As such they are widely employed as degreasers and as constituents of paints, varnishes, lacquers, inks, aerosol spray products, dyes, and adhesives. Other uses are as intermediates in chemical synthesis, and as fuels and fuel additives. Most organic solvents are refi ned from petroleum. Occupational solvent exposures involve situations ranging from a secretary using typewriter correction fl uid to the loading and off-loading of tanker trucks with thousands of gallons of gasoline. The greatest industrial use of solvents is as metal degreasers. This work environment is typically where the highest exposures occur, mainly via inhalation and secondarily via dermal contact. An estimated 10 million people are potentially exposed to organic solvents in the workplace.Casarett and Doull‚Äôs TOXICOLOGY, The Basic Science of Poisons Asbestos Asbestos is a term given to a group of fibrous silicates most of which contain magnesium. The health effects of asbestos are related to the fact that asbestos fibres can be small enough to be inhaled. Asbestos fibre bundles can break into smaller and smaller fibres until dust particles in the respirable size range are produced. Particles in the respirable range (2‚Äì10Œºm) can reach the lower regions of the lung (the alveolar region) which is beyond the reach of the normal mucous clearing system. Fibres retained in lung tissue may be up to 200Œºm long and 3Œºm or less in diameter. Some of the longer fibres get coated with an iron protein complex, producing drumstickshaped ‚Äòasbestos bodies‚Äô. These are considered indicative of occupational exposure.Occupational Toxicology, Chris Winder and Neill Stacey  References External links * Toxipedia * Information Toxicology International * Society of Toxicology Occupational safety and health Toxicology ","title":"Occupational toxicology"},{"id":"48533040","text":"Albert Edward Lester Kirchner (7 January 1888 ‚Äì 23 January 1942) was a former Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and Sturt in the South Australian Football League (SAFL).

The StFV was founded in 1911 and has its headquarters in Graz. The StFV is one of 8 regional organizations of the Austrian Football Association (, √ñFB). In 2015, StFV had 137,904 members from 335 football clubs with 2,293 teams. History=The time before the establishment of the Styria Football Association 1893 Georg-August Wagner of Graz, brought the sport of football from Prague to Graz. He was able to quickly inspire students about this new sport. Just one year later, the first football division of the ATRV Graz was founded in Styria. The first football league game between two teams of the ATRV was played on March 18, 1894 in Graz. On October 31, 1895, a game between 1894 founded First Vienna FC and a team of Graz ATRV took place, in which Vienna took the win 5-0. In 1900, the Graz SV was founded and in 1902 the Grazer AK (GAK). The later important Grazer Sportklub \\"Sturm\\" (Storm) ‚Äì which is better known today as the SK Sturm Graz ‚Äì was founded in 1909. The first significant competition in Styria, in 1907, was won by Wiener Sport-Club by a Final victory in the \\"Herbstmesse- Pokal\\" (Autumn Fair Cup) over the GAK. The Deutsch-Alpenl√§ndische Fu√üball- Verband (German-Alpine Football Association) was founded as one of the five sub-organizations of the Austrian Football Association. However, it was the only association that could not organize a championship for the teams of Upper Austria, Salzburg, Tyrol, Vorarlberg, the littoral, Carinthia and Styria. Founding and first year In May 1921 the Deutsch-Alpenl√§ndische Fu√üball- Verband broke up. After the Carinthian clubs left, only the Styrian teams remained and the Styrian Football Association was founded. The first records of the Styrian Championships, which were recorded as of 1921, was the Amateur Championship of Austria through the GAK in 1929,1932 and 1933. In 1934, the SK Sturm Graz won. 1937 the professional team Chelsea F.C. from London took the win over the selected Styrian Football Association team with a score of 4-2. 1947 was the first decision to make a total Austrian Cup competition, then in 1949 the Austrian Football Bundesliga were established with an A and B league. This first championship was won by FK Austria Wien. The first Styrian participants, the SK Sturm Graz, placed 10th. Success of the Styrian Clubs in Professional Football In 1955 the Steiermark attained a one time record: Playing in the A League was the SK Sturm Graz, the Grazer AK, the Kapfenberger SV and ESV Austria Graz four Styrian teams. In 1959 the B League was disbanded and replaced by the Regionalliga Mitte. In 1962 the GAK managed as the first Austrian club outside Vienna to participate in the European Cup. In 1974, the new Zehnerliga (ten-League) was introduced (as a 1st Division) and the professional 2. Division. The Donawitzer SV Alpine and GAK went to the 2nd Division and only the SK Sturm Graz remained in the 1st Division. In 1973 the relegation of SK Sturm Graz was only prevented by a special decision of the Association. In 1981 the GAK won their first major title, the √ñFB Cup. In 1998 the SK Sturm Graz became the first Styrian football club to receive the title of Austrian Football Champion, in 1999 they defended their title successfully. 2004 the GAK became the second Styrian club to win the Austrian Football Championship. In 2011, once again the Austrian Championship was awarded to a Styrian team, the SK Sturm Graz.

Born at Alnwick in Northumberland, Burnett was an illegitimate son of John Burnett, a shoemaker, and Margaret Anderson.Edward J. Davies, \\"The Parentages of Martin Jude and John Burnett\\", North East History, 44(2013):62-65. He was educated at the Duke of Northumberland's Charity School until he was orphaned at the age of twelve. He then went to live with an uncle on Tyneside, where he worked running errands. Two years later, he started an engineering apprenticeship, also studying courses at the Mechanics' Institute in his spare time.Norman McCord and John Saville, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.II, pp.71-76 Burnett became an active trade unionist. During the 1860s, he was involved with campaigns for Parliamentary reform, and for a half-holiday on Saturdays. He was a leader of the Nine Hours League, and in 1871, when he was working at William Armstrong's Elswick Works, where he led a strike from May to October demanding the nine-hour day. Public opinion was favourable, and donations from the public and trade unionists totalling ¬£2000 enabled the men to stay out until the strike was won, in October. In addition, Burnett persuaded James Cohn from the International Working Men's Association to come to Tyneside and convince strikebreakers, many brought in from overseas, to leave. Although Burnett was unable to return to work for Armstrong, Joseph Cowen found him work at the Newcastle Daily Chronicle. He was also active in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and in 1875, he was elected as its general secretary, following the death of William Allan. He also served on the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, and from 1879 was elected annually as its treasurer.William John Davis, The British Trade Union Congress: History and Recollections Burnett was a critic of the apparent impact of Jewish immigration upon domestic labour standards, arguing in 1887 that ‚Äòthese aliens have chiefly been German and Russian Jews, and there can be no doubt that the result has been to flood the labour market of the East End of London with cheap labour to such an extent as to reduce thousands of native workers to the verge of destitution‚Äô.Alderman, Geoffrey. Modern British Jewry. Oxford: Clarendon, 1992, p.123 In 1885, A. J. Mundella persuaded Burnett to give up his trade union posts and join the Board of Trade. There, he wrote reports on sweatshops before serving as joint secretary of the Royal Commission on Labour from 1892 to 1894, then returning to the Board of Trade as Chief Labour Correspondent, his principal roles being the production of statistics and arbitration in disputes. Burnett retired in 1907, but served from 1909 until his death as a member of the Tailoring Board.

A planetary civilization or global civilization is a civilization of Type I on Kardashev scale, with energy consumption levels near that of a contemporary terrestrial civilization with an energy capability equivalent to the solar insolation on Earth (between 1016 and 1017 watts). In social aspect the worldwide, global, increasingly interconnected, international, highly technological society. Planetary civilization ‚Äì Type I civilization on Kardashev scale Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in a work \\"Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations\\", published in 1964, proposed the scale of technological development of civilization, based on the amount of energy that civilization is able to utilize, then named Kardashev scale. A Type I civilization is planetary, consuming all energy that is available from a neighboring star, or about 1017 watts. A Type II civilization is stellar, consuming all the energy that their star emits, or 1027 watts. A type III civilization is galactic, consuming the energy of billions of stars, or about 1037 watts. Carl Sagan suggested defining intermediate values (not considered in Kardashev's original scale) by interpolating and extrapolating, according to his calculations, the modern state of the present human civilization is expressed by a value about 0.7. Transition to a planetary civilization Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku, in a book, Physics of the Future, published in 2011, stated that humans with an average economic growth may attain planetary civilization status in 100 years. Danger of a transition to a planetary civilization Michio Kaku, in his interview \\"Will Mankind Destroy Itself?\\" with the website \\"Big Think\\" discusses a danger of a transition to a planetary civilization. The danger period is now, because we still have the savagery, but we also have nuclear weapons: In science fiction Planetary civilizations are various civilizations we see in science fiction. Michio Kaku qualifies as one of a typical Type I civilization would be that of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon, where an entire planet's energy resources have been developed. They can control all planetary sources of energy, so they might be able to control or modify the weather at will, harness the power of a hurricane, or have cities on the oceans. Although they roam the heavens in rockets, their energy output is still largely confined to a planet.

It was built in 1949 by Zero Ziegler. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Bundaberg War Nurses Memorial was officially opened on 15 October 1949 by the Mayor of Bundaberg, Alderman F H Buss. It is thought to have been designed by Bundaberg architect E H Boden. The memorial honours the 12 local women who served as nursing sisters in the First World War and the 4 who served in the Second World War, two of whom died, one (Sister Pearl Mittelheuser) in a Japanese prisoner of war camp and the other (Sister Joyce Whyllie) in the sinking of the Centaur. The town of Bundaberg profited from the growth of the sugar industry in the 1880s. The Millaquin refinery and private milling companies invested in the area and by 1920 the city had become directly and indirectly dependent on the sugar industry. The impetus for a war nurses memorial was initiated by the West Bundaberg Progress Association who approached the City Council and requested that the parcel of land be made available to them for beautification purposes. At the time of unveiling, it was the only tribute to war nurses in Australia. The unveiling ceremony was attended by a large crowd of civilians and fifty nurses in white uniforms formed a guard of honour. Many people were thanked at the unveiling, including architect E H Boden who also formally opened the steel entrance gate to the park. Many local companies and individuals contributed to the construction of the memorial. These included architect E H Boden, local monumental mason Zero Ziegler, who donated the marble honour roll and Mr Cunnington, the Bundaberg City Gardens Curator, who supervised the layout and planting of the park. Eric Hawksley Boden was born in Brisbane. He became an architectural cadet with the Queensland Government in 1909 before working for architects in private practice in Brisbane. In 1922 he travelled throughout Europe and Africa. He was registered as an architect in Queensland in 1929 and opened his own practice in Maryborough in 1938. Boden also served in the Second World War as the architect for USA forces in Townsville. The firm of Zero Ziegler was founded in Bundaberg in 1902 as Ziegler and Sons. They provided many memorials throughout South East Queensland and are still operating as monumental masons. The pavilion was constructed at a cost of over which was raised in seven weeks by public subscription and fund raising by the Bundaberg General Hospital and the women of the Red Cross. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the soldier statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair. Although there are many different types of war memorials throughout Queensland, apart from honour boards, this is the only known one that honours the role of women in the First World War.  Description  Park, 2009 The Memorial Pavilion is situated in a triangular shaped park planted with palm trees opposite the Bundaberg Base Hospital. The park is at the junction of two main streets in Bundaberg with the pavilion facing the corner. The pavilion itself is approximately long and wide and has white painted stucco walls and a terracotta tiled roof. All fours sides have arched openings with piers between. There are three openings on the long sides and two on the short sides. High on the exterior wall of the southern face is bronze lettering explaining the purpose of the pavilion. Internally, the pavilion has a concrete floor with two timber and iron park benches in the centre. Leaded marble plaques are located at the top of the interior walls. The first is an honour roll which lists the names of the local nursing sisters who served in the First and Second World Wars. The names of the two who died on service are identified with a leaded cross. The second marble plaque records the details of the commissioning and unveiling of the pavilion.  Heritage listing  Bundaberg War Nurses Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. This particular memorial is rare as the only war nurses memorial, other than honour boards, in Queensland and the only known one in Australia. It is also an uncommon example of a memorial still situated in its intact setting. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. Erected in 1949, the memorial at Bundaberg demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the use of appropriate materials and design elements. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The memorial and its setting are significant for their contribution to the aesthetic qualities of the townscape and creates a conspicuous landmark at the junction of two major streets. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has a strong and continuing association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event and as the focal point for the remembrance of that event. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It also has special association with the local firms and individuals involved in its erection including architect E H Boden, monumental masonry firm Zero Ziegler and Gardens Curator Mr Cunnington.

He is the founder and director of the Afghanistan National Institute of Music. Early life and education As his father, Ustad Salim Sarmast, was a famous musician, composer and conductor in Afghanistan, Ahmad Sarmast grew up exposed to a wide variety of musical influences. Sarmast graduated from an Afghan music school in 1981. He later left Afghanistan in the 1990s due to the ongoing Afghan civil war. Sarmast earned a master's degree in musicology in 1993 from Moscow State Conservatory. He was given asylum in Australia in 1994. In 2005, Sarmast became the first Afghan to earn a PhD in music, earning his PhD from Monash University. Founding the Afghan National Institute of Music Sarmast returned to Afghanistan to help revive music in his native country after the defeat of the Taliban. Under the invitation of the Afghan Ministry of Education, Sarmast returned with a plan to restore Afghan music traditions that had been suppressed under years of Taliban rule. In 2006, Sarmast had outlined his proposal in the Revival of Afghan Music (ROAM), wanting to open a dedicated music school with a curriculum combining both Afghan and Western music. Sarmast returned to Afghanistan in 2008. He formally opened the Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM) in Kabul on June 20, 2010. Sarmast originally planned to offer music education exclusively to underprivileged children, orphans and street kids. The Afghan Ministry of Education wanted him to open the school to talented students, so in the end an agreement was reached for a fifty-fifty split. The underprivileged children at ANIM receive a stipend of $30 per month to allow them to focus on school. Sarmast also placed great importance on offering a co-educational learning environment, a rare situation in Afghanistan, listing that as his greatest achievement at the school. In 2013, ANIM's Afghan Youth Orchestra toured the United States, including performances at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center. In 2015, the first Afghan female conductor, Negin Khpolwak, held her first concert with an all-female ensemble. Victim of Taliban attack Sarmast was injured in a suicide attack by the Taliban on the Centre d'Enseignement Fran√ßais en Afghanistan on Dec 11, 2014. Following the attack, the Taliban released a statement accusing Sarmast of corrupting the youth of Afghanistan. Immediately after the attack, Sarmast lost consciousness and lost hearing in both ears, as both of his eardrums were perforated, resulting in him becoming completely deaf. He was rushed to a hospital in Kabul for emergency surgery. Later, he returned to Australia, where surgeons removed eleven pieces of shrapnel from the back of his head, restoring partial hearing to one of his ears. Sarmast stills suffers from PTSD as a result of the attack. Further information Sarmast spends time annotating Afghan music in Western notation to help record a mostly oral Afghan music tradition. He also hopes to rearrange Afghan music in the Western Classical tradition. Sarmast has plans to build a concert hall and girl's dormitory at the current institute. Sarmast is also hoping to build music schools in other cities in Afghanistan, primarily Mazar-i-Sharif, Jalalabad and Herat. He also dreams of eventually setting up a Symphony Orchestra of Afghanistan. Sarmast was the subject of a 2012 documentary, Dr. Sarmast‚Äôs Music School, directed by Polly Watkins and Beth Frey.

It was designed by Alfred Barton Brady and built in 1900. It is also known as Burnett River Traffic Bridge. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Burnett Bridge is a metal truss road bridge spanning the Burnett River at Bundaberg, linking the northern and southern parts of the city. It was constructed in 1900 to the design of A.B. Brady. The Burnett area was first settled by Europeans in the 1840s and 1850s as a series of pastoral runs. In the late 1860s, as good agricultural land around Maryborough began to be scarce, agriculturalists and timbergetters became interested in land on the navigable Burnett River to the north. The foundation settlers of Bundaberg selected land in 1867-68 under the \\"Sugar and Coffee Regulations\\" stemming from the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1860s which aimed to promote agriculture and closer settlement. The site of Bundaberg was officially surveyed in 1869. Coastal traffic grew, and copper was first mined at Mt Perry in 1871, which enabled Bundaberg to develop as a port and supply centre, in spite of competition from Maryborough for this trade. The provision of amenities was therefore of importance to the development of Bundaberg and this included bridges because, although the higher southern bank of the river was officially surveyed as the town site, both sides soon developed wharves and buildings and were initially linked by ferry. In the 1870s the first bridges were built as ferries could no longer cope with increasing traffic across the River. It was in the 1880s, however, with the establishment of the sugar industry in the region, that Bundaberg boomed. Handsome and substantial masonry buildings began to rise in the city as evidence of its growing importance and prosperity. Burnett Bridge, 1900 The first bridges were timber and became weakened by heavy traffic. Two more substantial metal replacements, not only capable of taking heavier loads, but of matching the general upgrading of Bundaberg's commercial centre were planned. The smaller of the two, over Bundaberg Creek, a tributary of the Burnett River and the eastern boundary of the city, was opened in December 1899, and is known as the Kennedy Bridge. It is a reduced version of the main bridge which was opened on 24 August 1900. Both have similarities in structural design and appearance to the 1897 Victoria Bridge in Brisbane, which was demolished in the 1960s. All were designed by engineer and Queensland Government Architect, Alfred Barton Brady. A.B. Brady, born and trained in England, designed many notable bridges and was one of Queensland's most important early engineers. He served the state for 37 years from 1885, at first with the railways, then from 1889 with the Public Works Department, and then as Government Architect and engineer for bridges from 1892. Although Brady designed many important and handsome public buildings, his forte was in bridge design. When it was opened the Burnett Bridge was the fifth longest metal truss bridge in Australia. Of the others, all have been demolished or decommissioned. Although the trusses of the Burnett Bridge were almost identical to those of the Victoria Bridge, those of the Brisbane bridge had a wider roadway divided into two portions running between three trusses, whereas Burnett Bridge has only two trusses. Although the river had been bridged by the railway in 1891, the traffic bridge was viewed by the public as being of great importance for the continuing progress of Bundaberg. This was demonstrated by public meetings held to support the building of the bridge and the participation of local authorities in its building. It was completed at a time when funds for local authorities were scarce because of priority given by the government to developmental railways. Half the cost was met by endowment; the other half was advanced to the local authorities as a loan repayable in forty years. At some stage the lanterns on the abutments of the bridge were replaced by spherical lights, possibly when a conversion was made from gas to electricity. In the 1950s, the footway was narrowed, but changes have otherwise been minor. The bridge is still an important part of the city's transport system and was repaired and repainted in 1991. In 1993, the footway was again widened as a cycleway/footpath, using improved access provided by a pathway constructed beneath the southern abutment.  Description  Burnett Bridge joins Quay Street, Bundaberg with Perry Street, North Bundaberg, across the Burnett River. It is in length and has eight 51.9 long spans with cylindrical piers and concrete abutments. The bridge carries a roadway and a footpath. The road is on transverse metal troughing spanning between the lower chords of hog-back lattice trusses. Although the form of the bridge is principally dictated by technical requirements, it also has aesthetic appeal and is an important landmark in the city. The spans of the bridge are supported by pairs of piers in the form of Tuscan order columns with circular cross bracing between them producing a striking effect. The bridge is approached by classically inspired abutments and pylons cast in concrete. The pylons flanking the roadway are square in form and have Doric style entablatures on rusticated bases. A concrete wall falling in height links them to the lower abutments. These carry decorative metal lamps, consisting of glass spheres lights on wrought metal bases.  Heritage listing  Burnett Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Burnett Bridge is important in illustrating the importance and prosperity of Bundaberg in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the centre of one of Queensland's most significant sugar-growing regions. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is an important example of its type and combines technical quality with aesthetic appeal, making a substantial contribution to the Bundaberg townscape. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is an important example of its type and combines technical quality with aesthetic appeal, making a substantial contribution to the Bundaberg townscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is important as a major example of the work of Alfred Barton Brady who, during 37 years of work for several departments of the Queensland government, made a major contribution to the development of the state in both architecture and engineering design.

Built about 1785, it is a fine Federal period mansion, historically associated with John Brewer, a leading shipbuilder and militia leader during the War of 1812, and James Shepherd Pike, a journalist who also served during the American Civil War as United States Ambassador to the Netherlands. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Mansion House stands between United States Route 1 and the St. Croix River in far eastern Maine. It stands just north of the Henrietta Brewer House (now the Redclyffe Shore Motel), on a mostly-wooded parcel of more than . The house is a large two-story wood frame structure, with a roughly square main section, from which a rectangular ell extends from its northern corner. The house is oriented with its main facade facing southeast, toward the river. That facade is five bays wide, with an open single-story piazza extending across the center three bays, supported by round columns, and steps descending to the ground across its width and sides. The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a Federal style fanlight window, into which the date \\"1785\\" has been etched. The interior of the house retains elegant Federal period finishes, including two staircases, fireplace mantels, and wooden wainscoting, which on the ground floor consists of single planks of pine, in width. The house was built in 1785 by John Brewer, a prominent local shipbuilder, who also served as the local postmaster. Brewer worked closely in business with partners across the river in New Brunswick, and served as a general in the state militia during the War of 1812. It is said that the cupola on this house was used during that conflict as a lookout point for the arrival military forces. James Shepherd Pike, who acquired the house in 1864 as a summer residence, was the son of a business partner of John Brewer's sun John N.M. Brewer. Pike, a journalist by trade, was notable as a prominent anti-slavery advocate on the pages of the New York Tribune and other newspapers. During the American Civil War he served as United States Ambassador to the Netherlands, appointed by President Abraham Lincoln. In the post-war years he is known to have hosted several luminaries of the period here, including Salmon P. Chase and Horace Greeley. The house has since been winterized for year-round use, and remains in private hands.

They represent a class of mesoporous organosilicas. Mesoporous materials have been defined as porous materials with pore size ranging from 2 nm ‚Äì 50 nm. Ionosilicas belong to the mesoporous organosilicas materials, but are more specifically constituted by ionic substructures. Ionosilicas are synthesized by hydrolysis-polycondensation reactions or post synthesis grafting procedures involving ionic precursors. Due to their mixed mineral- ionic nature, ionosilicas are situated at the interface of silica hybrid materials and ionic liquids. Similarly to conventional functional silica based materials, two classes of ionosilicas can be distinguished, depending of the way the ionic group is anchored to the silica support and where it is located. Surface functionalized ionosilicas contain ionic groups located on the materials‚Äô surface and can be obtained either via ‚Äòone-pot‚Äô co-condensation reactions or post grafting procedures. On the other side, periodic mesoporous ionosilicas, belonging to the PMO family, are produced starting from oligosilylated ionic precursors. Ionosilicas are synthesized via hydrolysis- polycondensation reactions involving ionic precursors. The ionic nature of these compounds has deep influence on the mechanism of the formation of the solid. Ionosilicas with regular architectures are often formed in the presence of anionic surfactants. This behaviour displays the formation of precursor- surfactant ion pairs in the hydrolysis polycondensation mixture. These hybrid ionosilicas display very specific and unusual surface properties such as high hydrophilicity and high water-affinity. These features can efficiently be varied both via the cation and the anion,Journal of the Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers 2014, 45, 2868-2877. resulting in an ability to fine-tune the properties of these materials.

The temple was completed in 1871 as a Confucian Temple, retaining the two original shrines in name, operation and assets distribution, which were the Wenwei and Wenbing Shrines. Extra funds were also raised to purchase the temple land and agricultural process went towards the temple expenses and staffs salary. During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, the temple was changed to Wenchang Temple. In 1904, the Japanese took over the wing and converted into a public school, which today becomes the Beitun Elementary School. The left and right studios were converted to teacher dormitories. In April 1996, the Taichung City Government made reparation by commissioning the Architectural Research Center of Tunghai University for the renovation work. The project was completed in March 1998 with a cost of NT$34 million.

It is the material in the heater itself that regulates the temperature. The heater requires no regulating electronics, temperature sensors, overheat protection etc. The temperature the heater will hold is decided when the material and the heater is produced. It can be fine tuned by changing the voltage to the heater. Self-regulating heaters are made from materials with strong Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) characteristics, i.e. the resistivity of the material increases rapidly with increasing temperature. Such materials include ceramic PTC stones.US Patent 4,822,980 and PTC rubber.US patent 6,734,250 Ceramic type A ceramic PTC heater is made of small ceramic pieces pressed between two metal plates. The constraint compartment causes them to get a strong PTC effect. The typical temperature of ceramic stones is 140‚Äì250 ¬∞C (284‚Äì482 ¬∞F). Ceramic stones actually have Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) properties at low temperatures which makes them slow to heat up. Rubber type A rubber PTC heater is made from a special type of rubber which conducts electricity, but only up to a temperature which is defined at the production of the PTC rubber. Typical design temperatures are between 0‚Äì80 ¬∞C (32‚Äì176 ¬∞F). The resistivity of the rubber increases exponentially with temperature for all temperatures up to the design temperature. Hence, it has strong PTC properties for all temperatures and heats up rapidly. Above this temperature the rubber is an electrical isolator and ceases to produce heat. This makes the heater self-limiting. The rubber foil is thin and flexible and can be formed to any shape and size. Operation When a voltage is applied to a PTC heater electrical current flows through the material and the resistivity of the material causes it to heat up (P(T)=U‚àß2√∑R(T)). As it heats up the resistivity increases rapidly and the power (heat) produced decreases. At the same time heat is being transferred from the heater to the object it is attached to, and its surrounding. Eventually the amount of heat produced is in equilibrium with the amount of heat conducted and radiated away from the heater. The heater reaches its equilibrium temperature and remains there. The exponential PTC properties of the material assures that the equilibrium temperature is virtually insensitive to changes in the ambient temperatures.

It is most famous for carrying tens of thousands of Albanian refugees to the Italian port of Bari on 8 August 1991, an unprecedented mass arrival that caught Italian authorities unaware. Construction The ship was built in the Cantieri Navali Riuniti of Ancona in (Italy) by the Societ√† Ligure di Armamento (based in Genoa). Originally bearing the name Ilice, it was a sister ship to the Ninny Figari, the Sunpalermo and the Fineo. Launched on 4 May 1960 and placed into service on 16 June of the same year, it was sold in 1961 to the government controlled Joint Sino-Albanian Shipping Company, who based it in Durr√´s under Albanian flag and renamed it the Vlora. Voyage to Bari (1991)=Background The fall of communism in Albania in the early 1990s gave way to a major economic collapse (with severe food shortages) amid widespread political and social unrest in the country. This incited many Albanians to try and leave the previously isolated nation. Many Albanians fled to Greece in the south, while some ethnic Slavs tried to cross into northern neighbour Yugoslavia. In Tirana foreign embassies were stormed (mainly unsuccessfully) after rumours spread of visas being handed out. Up to 3,000 Albanians managed to enter the compound of the German embassy while some successfully entered the Czechoslovakian embassy grounds. The ones in the German embassy were eventually allowed to leave to Germany via Italy. Many of the emigrants decided on Italy, less than a hundred miles away across the Strait of Otranto. Exaggerated portrayals of wealth in Italian television adverts that Albanians had access partly motivated this. Earlier in 1991 a number of crossings were attempted by hundreds or thousands of Albanian refugees who forcefully commandeered different vessels, from Romanian freighters to Albanian navy tugboats. The overrun harbor security forces in Durr√´s or Vlora could only look on helplessly. One such crossing on 7 March had seen around 20,000 immigrants land in Brindisi on a number of small vessels. The city of only 80,000 had found itself struggling to cope with such an influx, yet the inhabitants generously provided food and shelter and the immigrants were generally well received. Boarding the ship (7 August) The Vlora had returned from Cuba with a load of sugar, its main engines were out of use and it docked in Durr√´s to unload its cargo and go through repairs. Meanwhile, throngs of people had gathered in the port from around the country in the hope of boarding any ship and sail to Italy. Without anyone to stop them, thousands of them (between 10,000 and over 20,000 according to reports) boarded the Vlora on 7 August 1991. They jumped in the sea and climbed aboard on ropes, filling virtually every inch of the ship (some hanging from ladders for most of the voyage). The captain, Halim Milaqi, was unable to reason the stowaways ‚Äî some of whom were armed ‚Äî out of their plan. He decided to sail the overcrowded boat for Italy, fearful of what could happen if amateurs were to commandeer the ship. Crossing into Italy (8 August) Sailing with only its auxiliary motors, without a radar (due to passenger presence) and with excess weight, the ship also lost its cooling tubes after passengers cut them open to try and hydrate themselves, with the captain then using seawater to avoid melting the motor. They fortunately benefited from generous weather and arrived on Italian shores in the early hours of 8 August. Approaching Brindisi's port at around 4 a.m., the captain was advised against docking in the city by the police's vice-prefect. The city was still coming to terms with the thousands of Albanians who had arrived in March or in between and didn't have the capacity to absorb more. The ship's captain then changed course to Bari, only 55 miles away, which the incapacitated ship took seven hours to reach. During that time, little had been done by the Italian authorities to prepare for this mass arrival. Both the police prefect and the superintendent were on holiday while the mayor's office was only notified when the ship was already in the port. An attempt was made to blockade the port's entrance using small ships and the navy frigate Euro to try and constrain the captain to return to Albania. Citing the worsening conditions on board the ship, after passengers had spent 36 hours with virtually no food or water in stifling heat, Milaqi refused to back down. He entered the port, communicating that he had injured people aboard and he could not mechanically turn around. The Vlora was made to dock at the quay furthest away from the city centre usually reserved for coal unloading. Whilst in the port scores of its passengers jumped into the water and swam to the shore or climbed down ropes while it was mooring, with many disappearing into the city. Stadium confinement and clashes (8 August) The Italian government's hard-line policy, expressed by Interior Minister Vincenzo Scotti, was to stop refugee ships from landing on Italian shores and otherwise deporting immigrants straight away. As such, the Vlora's passengers did not disembark to a warm welcome. Orders from Rome called for them to be kept in the port, with little to no material help, and ferried back to Albania within days if not hours. When the improbability of such a plan emerged, other measures were haphazardly put in place, some of the injured (a few caused by the unrelenting sun) were taken by ambulance to hospital, as were a number of heavily pregnant women, the mayor Enrico Dalfino and vice-prefect Giuseppe Cisternino organised the distribution of water. Despite doubts expressed by Dalfino, the authorities started busing the immigrants from around midday to the Stadio della Vittoria, an out of use stadium, where they would be kept until their deportation. By the afternoon the Albanians had understood that they were ultimately to be sent home, groups of them tried to force their way through the police cordon surrounding the stadium. With many managing to escape, the authorities then decided to stop bringing anyone to the stadium and close the gates, locking them inside. The situation spun further out of control, the stadium's groundsman was effectively held hostage until the intervention of the mayor, personnel supervising the fair handling out of food were assaulted and the police then evacuated the stadium. It became a lawless zone controlled by the most violent elements (some armed with firearms). Food and water was literally thrown over the wall by the authorities using a fire truck crane, which meant it was mostly appropriated by the before-mentioned thugs. The night saw the tension flare up even more, with clashes between the police and Albanians trying (and succeeding for some) to break through the cordon. The police, who had a number of projectiles thrown at them, opened fire, some Albanians were treated for gunshot wounds. According to the police - who themselves had members injured by projectiles - these wounds were caused by prior infighting in the stadium. After a brief respite, the cat and mouse game between the Albanians trying to escape and the authorities started anew on Friday morning. Some 3,000 Albanians managed to bust the gates open and make a rush for it, with over 200 resulting injuries, including around 20 policemen. Whilst hundreds of refugees managed to escape - some hiding in the Fiera del Levante exhibition pavilions - around 2,000 were surrounded by police outside the stadium. They progressively transferred the escapees to the port in spite of their sometimes violent resistance. The situation inside the stadium neared boiling point, with some Albanians reportedly looting vehicles before driving them recklessly inside the stadium, panicking their compatriots. A small group also set fire to a Red Cross office and a garage at the stadium causing material damage according to Red Cross officials. Deportation through all means (9‚Äì16 August) Meanwhile, the Italian authorities had finally been able to organise their response to the refugee crisis. They requisitioned private ferries to transport them back to Albania, where they also sent two navy ships to help with disembarkation. The first ‚Äî the Tiziano ‚Äî arrived on the 9th. Some of the most refractive elements were taken to the airport and flown back to Albania with military C-130's in groups of around 60 (escorted by as many policemen). By mid-afternoon, around 3,000 had been repatriated, some left voluntarily as the hostile reception and poor conditions had left them disillusioned about life in Italy. To ease the evacuation, most were told lies, with the ships and planes supposed to take them to other Italian cities. The outgoing flow of refugees hastened with the arrival of two other ferries, the Espresso Grecia and the Malta, two days later. By the 11th, around 3,000 Albanians still remained in Bari's stadium, mostly the hard-line faction who refused to be convinced by the authorities say-so. The police chief Vincenzo Parisi convinced a number to leave with the offer of new clothes and 50,000 lire (a considerable sum in Albania at the time). After three days, the remaining hold-backs were told they had won the right to stay in Italy. However, as soon as they exited the stadium they were put into buses and taken to the airport, from where they were flown directly to Tirana. This led the press to title that the \\"Albanian invasion\\" had been ended on 16 August. Reactions Visiting the port and stadium on 10 August, Bishop Antonio Bello was scandalised by the dire conditions he found the Albanians in. It prompted him to write an article in Avvenire denouncing the authorities, chief of which the minister of interior and the head of the Protezione civile, for treating them like animals. Outcome With the media attention highlighting the dire situation in Albania, that country's authorities, pressured by Italy, put its ports under military control and halted all passenger trains to stem flow of emigrants. At the same time the Italian government offered to help the country financially (to the tune of $9 million in food) if Albania helped rein in and take back the immigrants leaving for Italy. Though undocumented immigration from Albania continued thereafter, it lessened in scale and was mostly organised by criminal gangs.

In 1953 Kozlov entered the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, where he studied German and Danish. During his last year at the institute he was sent to Denmark for language practice. He later also became fluent in English, French and Italian. In 1959 Kozlov became an intelligence officer, and since 1962 worked in Europe, Middle East and Africa. In the late 1970s he was appointed by the KGB to help monitor the Soviet government's financial assistance to anti-apartheid political movements in South Africa and South-West Africa (Namibia). Kozlov researched and prepared at least one report on how Soviet funds were being spent by the African National Congress (ANC). The nature of any other assignments he may have held remains disputed; South African prime minister P.W. Botha also claimed that he was involved in gauging popular support for the South-West African People's Organization (SWAPO). Kozlov undertook four trips to Southern Africa, including two specifically to South-West Africa, and soon became a person of interest to the National Intelligence Service. He was arrested for espionage at some point in 1981. The KGB negotiated directly with Niel Barnard, South Africa's intelligence chief, for Kozlov's safe return; he was later swapped for eight unidentified Western nationals as part of a prisoner exchange in Europe. In 2000, he was declared a Hero of the Russian Federation, for his \\"... courage and heroism displayed during the performance of special operations...\\". He died on 2 November 2015.

The 24th ranked Le Moyne Dolphins lost to 11th ranked West Texas A&M; University on March 20 in the Division II quarterfinals, finishing the season with a school-record 27 wins against 7 losses. In March 2019, Beilein was hired as head coach for the Niagara Purple Eagles men's basketball. However, on October 24, 2019, just weeks before the beginning of the season, Beilein resigned for \\"personal reasons\\", with assistant coach and former Duke standout Greg Paulus named as his replacement on an interim basis. Personal Beilein has two younger brothers, Mark and Andrew, and an elder sister, Seana Hendricks. He and his wife, Kristen, had a son, Thomas Patrick Beilein, on March 25, 2018.

A changing thermal environment can cause an optic to bend due to either 1) thermal gradients on the optic and a non-zero coefficient of thermal expansion, or 2) coefficient of thermal expansion gradients in an optic and a temperature change. Therefore, optothermal stability is an issue for optics that are present in a changing thermal environment. For example, a space telescope will have variable heat loads from changes in spacecraft attitude, solar flux, planetary albedo, and planetary infrared emissions. Optothermal stability is important when measuring surface figure of optics, because thermal changes are typically low frequency (diurnal or HVAC cycling) which makes it difficult to use the same methods used to remove errors due to vibrational disturbances. Also, optothermal stability is important for optical systems which require a high level of stability such as those that use a coronagraph.  Material Characterization Material characterization numbers have been mathematically derived to describe the rate at which a material deforms due to an external thermal input. It is important to note the distinction between wavefront stability (dynamic) and wavefront error (static). A higher Massive Optothermal Stability (MOS) and Optothermal Stability (OS) number will result in greater stability. As shown in the equation, MOS increases with density. Because added weight is undesirable for non-thermal reasons, especially in spaceflight applications, both MOS and OS are defined below: MOS = {{\\\\rho c_p} \\\\over \\\\alpha} OS = {c_p \\\\over \\\\alpha} Where œÅ, cp, Œ± are density, specific heat, and the coefficient of thermal expansion respectively.

Overview Underworld, one of the venues which hosted Camden Crawl performances in multiple years Rather than a single venue, Camden Crawl operated at multiple venues simultaneously, with different acts taking the stage at different venues. This format is sometimes referred to as a \\"microfestival\\", a type of event which Time Out Guide to London 2012 described as \\"a cross between a pub crawl and a music festival\\" and noted that Camden Crawl had originated. Drowned in Sound magazine called Camden Crawl \\"[u]ndoubtedly the first festival of its kind in the UK\\". Venues which hosted the events included The Barfly, Camden Underworld, Dingwalls, Dublin Castle, Electric Ballroom, KOKO, and Proud Gallery. Unlike genre-specific music festivals, Camden Crawl booked acts from a wide variety of musical styles, including dubstep, folk, indie, new wave, pop, post-punk, punk, rock, shoegaze, and techno. Performers who have participated in Camden Crawl include Adele, Disclosure, Florence + the Machine, Mumford & Sons, and Amy Winehouse. In addition to bands and solo musicians, performers in some years included art historians, comedians, poets, and people with unusual skills such as hula hooping. In some years, the combination of popular musicians and tiny venues led to long lines, fan frustration and the nickname \\"Camden Queue\\". History The festival was founded in 1995 by Lisa Paulon and four friends in the recording industry. She characterised the group as \\"five people who didn't know anything about putting on a gig\\" at the time the festival was first organised. They worked with \\"a group of journalists and Camden-based club promoters\\" to create the first event. Paulson later noted that health and safety regulations regarding decibel levels were unknown to the five founders initially, and conceded that 1995's performances were \\"a lot noisier than it is now [in 2011]\\". Some venues were also oversold, resulting in more ticket-holders wanting to see a performance than would fit in the venue where the act was performing. Camden Crawl continued until 1997, when organisers decided that the event was \\"too much to manage for something we mostly did for a laugh\\". After resuming in 2005, Camden Crawl grew into a multi-arts festival. Chris Jakubiak was hired as event organiser and helped expand the festival, which went on to win \\"Best Metropolitan Festival\\" at the UK Festival Awards in 2009, 2010, and 2012. 1995 James Johnston of Gallon Drunk, who played at the first Camden Crawl and in subsequent years Acts which played the first Camden Crawl included Bis, Blumfeld, Donkey, Gallon Drunk, Joeyfat, Kenickie, Killing Joke, The Lemonheads, Long Fin Killie, Nub, Penthouse, Pure Morning, Quickspace Supersport, Saint Etienne, Scarfo, Spare Snare, Bob Tilton, and The Wedding Present. The first year of the event spanned only five venues: Castlehaven Community Centre, Dingwalls, Dublin Castle, The Laurel Tree, and The Monarch (since renamed The Barfly). 1996 Performers at the second Camden Crawl, which was held on a Thursday night, 19 September, were predominantly from Scotland. Of twenty acts which participated, six ‚Äî AC Acoustics, The Delgados, Eska, Mogwai, Prolapse, and Urusei Yatsura ‚Äî were Glaswegian or had ties to Glasgow. The remainder of the lineup consisted of The Aloof, Bis, Gallon Drunk, Kenickie, Long Fin Killie, Nub, Pure Morning, Quickspace Supersport, Scarfo, Spare Snare, Bob Tilton, and The Wedding Present. 1997 Mouse on Mars performed at Camden Crawl in 1997 and 2014. In 1997, for the first time, Camden Crawl expanded to other cities. Again taking place in September, the festival began in Camden on 17 September (a Wednesday), moved to Manchester 18 September, and concluded in Glasgow on 19 September. As a result of the change in format, the festival was rebranded as \\"Intercity Crawl\\". Performers that year included Tanya Donelly, Echo & the Bunnymen (at the Electric Ballroom), Headrillaz (at Dingwalls), The High Fidelity (at the Camden Underworld), Mouse on Mars (at the Electric Ballroom), Navigator (at the Camden Underworld), Snow Patrol, The Third Eye Foundation (at The Monarch), Ultrasound, Velocette (at The Monarch), and The Wannadies. This year marked the last Camden Crawl until 2005. The Glasgow lineup included Tanya Donelly (at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut), The Karelia (at Nice N Sleazy), Lo Fidelity Allstars (at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut), Magoo (at Nice N Sleazy), and Velocette (at The Cathouse). 2005 The Wedding Present also played Camden Crawl in multiple years. To mark the tenth anniversary of the first Camden Crawl, organisers resurrected the festival, and the event took place 10 March, a Thursday, with forty acts playing. Performers in 2005 included Buzzcocks, Graham Coxon, The Cribs, Hard- Fi, Hope of the States, Hot Chip, The Kooks, Le Tigre, The Magic Numbers, Max√Ømo Park, Mystery Jets, The Subways, and The Wedding Present. The nine participating venues were The Barfly, Camden Underworld, Canaervan Castle, Dublin Castle, Electric Ballroom, KOKO, Lock 17, Oh! Bar, and Purple Turtle. Festival partners who helped curate the selection of performers included Artrocker, Club Fandango, Last.fm, Moshi Moshi Records and the Rough Trade shops. Both lineup and attendance were greater than before the hiatus, and the festival sold out. As a result of the success of the tenth-anniversary Camden Crawl, organisers decided to resume holding the event annually. 2006 Performers at the 2006 Camden Crawl included ¬°Forward, Russia!; Futureheads; Guillemots; Klaxons; Lethal Bizzle; Paolo Nutini; Plan B; Supergrass; and Sway. The event again sold out. 2007 The 2007 festival spanned two days, 19‚Äì20 April, a Thursday and Friday. Non-musical attractions were included in the schedule, such as stand-up comedy shows and quizzes. Amy Winehouse's appearance as one of Camden Crawl's performers drew both crowds and paparazzi. Hadouken! and dan le sac Vs Scroobius Pip made their Camden Crawl debuts. Adele also made an appearance ‚Äî prior to her rise to fame ‚Äî that year. 2008 Lead singer Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine Continuing the spring date selection for the festival, 2008's Camden Crawl took place over 18‚Äì19 April, an unseasonably warm weekend. Cage the Elephant performed at The Earl of Camden venue; Johnny Foreigner, M83, and Wild Beasts played The Flowerpot; and Lock 17 was another festival venue that year. Florence + the Machine also participated in the event for the first time. A total of 130 acts played at 25 venues during the 2008 festival. Other performers in 2008 included Crystal Castles, Hadouken!, Soko, Sam Sparro and White Lies. 2009 This was the year that Camden Crawl won \\"Best Metropolitan Festival\\" at the UK Festival Awards for the first time. It was also the first year the event had BBC Radio 6 Music as an official partner. Participating venues included Dublin Castle, the Enterprise, and, for the first time, Camden's historic Roundhouse theatre. Performers included 808 State, Billy Bragg, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Fall, Idlewild, Kasabian, The Maccabees, The xx, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs. 2009 also saw an alcohol-free event paralleling the Camden Crawl. Called the Red Bull Bedroom Jam X-Crawl, it took place at four venues and included performances by 25 alternative-music acts. 2010 Professor Green Camden Crawl won \\"Best Metropolitan Festival\\" at the UK Festival Awards for the second consecutive year in 2010. This was the first year there was rainy weather during the festival, which was scheduled to coincide with the UK Bank holiday. At the time of the event, participating performers Pendulum and Plan B had just released chart-topping albums, and participant Professor Green had a single at #1 as well. Teenage Fanclub performed at Camden Crawl for the first time that year. The choir group Gaggle also participated, singing at the Electric Ballroom. 2011 The festival spanned 29 April ‚Äì 1 May, and featured performances by more than two hundred and fifty acts, including Hodgy Beats; Odd Future; and Tyler, The Creator. It attracted both a younger audience and attendees in middle age in 2011. The more than fifty venues that year included Dublin Castle, The Forum (actually in Kentish Town rather than Camden), The Jazz Cafe, Koko, and the Monarch. 2012 And So I Watch You from Afar performed in both Camden and Dublin. This was the year that Camden Crawl won \\"Best Metropolitan Festival\\" at the UK Festival Awards for the third time. The festival took place at venues in Camden during the UK's Bank holiday weekend, 4‚Äì6 May, with scheduled performances which included Alabama 3, Gaz Coombes of Supergrass, Death in Vegas, Glasvegas, The Futureheads, and The Raincoats. Among the non-musical performances scheduled as part of the festival that year was a full day of presentations on art history. Other non-concert features at the 2012 Camden Crawl included alternative press, comedians, games, Hip Hop Shakespeare, KaraUke (karaoke combined with ukulele music), spoken word performers, and swing dancing. In 2012, for the first time, Camden Crawl included a separate set of dates outside the UK ‚Äî 11‚Äì12 May in Dublin, Ireland; Dublin performers included And So I Watch You from Afar, DELS, Le Galaxie, Jape, and We Are Scientists. 2013 The summer leg of the 2013 Camden Crawl took place not in Camden, but in Dublin; the festival returned to Camden venues for a winter leg in October. 2014 Spanning 20‚Äì21 June, more than twenty venues, and two hundred acts, 2014's Camden Crawl included performances by Atari Teenage Riot, Au Revoir Simone, Mouse on Mars, Of Montreal, School is Cool, Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, and Thumpers. Financial difficulties In July 2014, shortly after the end of that year's Camden Crawl, founder Paulon announced that the festival was \\"experiencing financial difficulty\\" and would be placed into voluntary liquidation as it was unable to pay all of its creditors. A statement on the festival website blamed low ticket sales for the shortfall. Significance Scroobius Pip at the 2007 Camden Crawl Stuart Clarke, an editor with Music Week, was quoted by BBC Radio 1 in 2008 as calling Camden Crawl \\"an important 'little stepping stone' for\\" up-and-coming musicians, and noting that performing at the festival was a good indicator that new acts would continue to become better-known. Yannis Philippakis ‚Äî lead singer of the group Foals, which became successful after playing Camden Crawl when they had been relatively unknown ‚Äî told BBC Radio 1 that \\"Camden Crawl is really important because bands get really great exposure. It's also a really great opportunity to play to music fans who may have heard of you but haven't had the chance to see you yet.\\" Musicians from Hadouken! and dan le sac Vs Scroobius Pip agreed that performing at Camden Crawl had marked \\"a turning point\\" in their careers.

It resulted in a decisive victory for the Kurdish forces, who expelled the ISIL militants from Sinjar and regained control of Highway 47, which until then had served as the major supply route between the ISIL strongholds of Raqqa and Mosul. The offensive was code-named \\"The Fury of Melek Taus\\", in reference to Melek Taus, a figure from Yezidi religion. Background In August 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant launched an offensive in Northern Iraq and pushed into Kurdish held areas of Nineveh Governorate, capturing the city of Sinjar, among others. In what is known as the Sinjar massacre, 2,000‚Äì5,000 Yazidis were killed in and around Sinjar, while 200,000 civilians fled. Amongst these, some 50,000 Yazidis fled to the Sinjar Mountains, located to the city's north, where they were facing starvation and dehydration. By the end of August, the majority of these 50,000 Yazidis were able to leave the mountains through a corridor opened by Kurdish forces, although several thousands stayed there. While ISIL held onto Sinjar city and the southern entrance of the Sinjar Mountains, they seized further terrain north of the mountains on 21 October 2014, thereby cutting the area's escape route to Kurdish areas. Yazidi militias who were securing the holy Sherfed√Æn shrine, had to withdraw into the Sinjar Mountains. The number of Yazidi civilian refugees was estimated at 2,000‚Äì7,000. An American source called this new situation a partial ISIL \\"siege\\" of the mountain range. In the course of a first, six-day-long offensive in December 2014, Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga took control over a part of the city of Sinjar and parts of the mountains, and expanded their offensive on to Tal Afar. In early 2015, Kurdish forces also pushed closer to the City of Mosul in the Mosul offensive. The offensive= First day  On 12 November 2015, over 7,500 Kurdish fighters, backed by the US-led coalition, began their offensive to retake Sinjar. Kurdish sources reported that they captured the village of Gabara and also had cut the highway between Sinjar and Syria. According to a Peshmerga official, U.S. and British special forces were also participating in the offensive. According to the same sources, 16 ISIL suicide attacks were thwarted. Later, it was reported that K forces had cut the Sinjar-Baiji and Sinjar-Tal Afar highways, effectively besieging ISIL in Sinjar. A Peshmerga commander hinted that no prisoners would be taken during the operation. ISIL counter-attacked in the western part of Sinjar, while hundreds of Peshmerga were waiting to be deployed in battle. Kurdish forces had secured the wheat silo, cement factory, hospital and several other public buildings in the northern part of the city, with reports that ISIL had fled Sinjar prior to the offensive. However, a Peshmerga official expressed his concern about possible suicide bombers remaining within the city. Kurdish forces also secured of territory around Sinjar from ISIL. At least 30 airstrikes by American warplanes, intended to soften up ISIL's military positions and uproot its fighters, were reported to have occurred on Thursday before the ground attack.  Second day: The retaking of Sinjar city  On the morning of 13 November 2015, the operation's second day, a Kurdish force including Syrian Kurdish YPG forces and Gerila forces of the HPG advanced to the city center from the west. There they were joined by Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces advancing from the east, including the Iraqi Kurdish Zeravani led by Major General Aziz Waisi and independent Yazidi forces led by Heydar Shesho. Subsequently, a stream of armed personnel carriers, Humvees, SUVs and light trucks were moved into the city. With a U.S. A-10 aircraft circling over the city, they took control of the city. Filmmaker Carsten Stormer, who was embedded with the western frontline, reported they didn't face any fighting from the side of the Islamic State: \\"There was no resistance ‚Äî I mean zero.\\" He also confirmed the PKK-affiliated troops arrived first in this section, only then to be joined by the Peshmerga. According to The Economist, \\"IS forces reportedly pulled out of the town after two days of intense fighting, allowing the Peshmerga to walk in virtually unopposed on November 12th.\\"  Third day  The next day, YB≈û and PKK units captured a number of strategically important villages west and south of Sinjar, most importantly Emdiban near the border to Syria. In course of these clashes, both ISIL as well as coalition forces suffered casualties; among them was the PKK field commander Newroz Hatim, who was killed near Midian village.  Coalition air support  During the whole week, Coalition aircraft had conducted over 250 airstrikes. Apart from U.S. aircraft, British Tornado GR4 and MQ-9 Reaper aircraft, operating from the Royal Air Force's Akrotiri base targeted ISIL positions near Sinjar and Tall Afar. CF-18 Hornet aircraft from the Royal Canadian Air Force were also reported to having contributed to the preparatory mission. Iraqi Security Force helicopters provided aerial MedEvac support conducting five casualty evacuations.  Aftermath = Dispute over credit for winning the battle  Though the presence of PKK, YPG and the Yezidi militias participating in the Sinjar Alliance has been covered by Iraqi Kurdish TV broadcaster R√ªdaw, both Iraqi Kurdish prime minister Nechirvan Barzani and president Massoud Barzani claimed the capture of Sinjar exclusively for the KRG's Peshmerga forces. Haydar Shesho, commander of the Protection Force of Sinjar (HP≈û), who before had been allied with the KRG peshmerga, warned of a \\"war over flags\\" and referred to the next battle being \\"the abolition of the one-party dictatorship\\".  Discovery of Yazidi mass graves  Following the recapture, in Solagh, east of Sinjar city, Kurdish forces found a mass grave with the remains of at least 78 Yazidi women believed to be executed by ISIL militants. On 15 November 2015, yet another mass grave containing the remains of 50 Yezidi men was found at a place that used to be the Shingal Technical Institute's fish pond.  Allegations of retaliation against Sunni Muslim houses  According to witnesses, in an alleged act of retaliation, members of the Yazidi minority looted and burned Sunni Muslim houses following the recapture of the city. However, the report was denied by Kurdish security commanders, and could not be independently confirmed. In the course of the Islamic State's Northern Iraq offensive in August 2014, some Sunni inhabitants had allegedly identified local Yazidis to the jihadists, thereby enabling the following Sinjar massacre.

It is an early example of Modern architecture in Arkansas, using brick and poured concrete, and metal frame windows, as residential building materials. Its flat roof notably included an experimental water-control system that was intended to allow water to pool on it as a passive cooling mechanism; this system never worked properly, and required repeated roof replacements and the addition of a guttered drainage system to correct. The house is two stories, blocky in shape, with a flat-roof porch that extends from the entrance to the driveway, where it forms a porte-cochere.

Early life Helena Lefroy was born Helena Trench on 27 January 1820 in Dublin. The Trench family name originated from Thomas Trench, Dean of Kildare. Thomas was born on 10 May 1761. He married Mary Weldon of Rahinderry in the queens county. Her parents were Reverend F.S. and Lady Helena Trench. When Helena was fourteen the family moved to Kilmorony where she developed an interest in botany and gardening. Her interest in botany came from her mother. By living with her father she became fluent in many languages including French, German and Italian. Her father was the Rector of Athy and from this Helena's strong religious beliefs stemmed. Reverend Trench died on November 23, 1860 and is buried at St. John's graveyard in Athy. She also had a sister Maria Trench who became Maria Wilson after marriage. Maria, like Helena, died in 1908. Personal life She married Jeffry Lefroy in 1844 who was a Dean of Dromore. He was the son of the honorable Thomas Langlois Lefroy, lord chief justice of Ireland. A book of memoirs is available where it shows Thomas writing to and about his son Jeffry as well as Lefroy and their two boys. Her two sons wrote a biography where they talk about their mother and her contributions. Her husband Jeffry was a co-author of the journal article, The Great Famine: Some Correspondence relating to Social Conditions in the Loughbrickland Area 1840-1850.Sands, J.

This book included a number of entries of famine relief correspondence and letters from the time of the famine. From these entries the authors write notes making relevance to what was happening at the time. Her two sons have written a book about Lefroy entitled 'Helena Lefroy some simple recollections of her life and influence'. This can be found in the National library of Ireland. There are memoirs available about her son George Alfred Lefroy who was the Bishop of Calcutta. In these memoirs it mentions how fond he was of his mother.  Botany  Lefroy was known primarily for the discovery of the purple spurge. Purple spurge is a species of Euphorbia, it usually grows on gravelly and sandy beaches. It has traces to western Europe and northern Africa. The plant is a small, prostrate plant with fours stems at the base growing between 10‚Äì20 cm long. She found this in Tramore, Waterford in 1839. Other botanists attempted to visit the area where she discovered it but they failed, which led people to believe it was very rare and now extinct. Rob Randall mentions this plant in his annual report in 1978 where he visits Lundy. He is puzzled by the fact that this plant is found on certain beaches on the island and not others. Other discoverys In The Natural History Review, a quarterly journal of biological science there is a reference to a Miss Trench on page 538 upon which it claims that she discovered Acino vulgare.\\" Found near Athy by Miss Trench, in 1838 ; and in July, 1840, in a sandy field at Portmarnock,\\"  Search for Euphorbia peplis  Through finding 'Euphorbia peplis', Lefroy inspired others to search for this plant species. Richard Barrington went searching for it in 1870 and 1871, but to no avail. This was followed by Trinity College, Dublin student Henry Chichester Hart in 1882, also without success. This resulted in the plant being classed as extinct.Moore, D., & More, A. G. (1866). Contributions Towards a Cybele Hibernica: Being Outlines of the Geographical Distribution of Plants in Ireland.

His early sermons, many of which were written down and published, disclose a Puritan theology and thoroughgoing Calvinism, but he became increasingly associated with the Royalist cause as Civil War approached. He left little trace during the Commonwealth years. Following the Restoration of the king he was able to return to the ecclesiastical living in Northamptonshire from which he had been excluded by parliament in 1643. His final book, \\"A Disswasive from Error\\", appeared in 1669. Life From his age stated at death it is inferred that Joseph Bentham was born in 1593 or 1594. Available sources are otherwise silent on his early years, but it is known that he graduated from Pembroke College, Cambridge with a BA degree in 1615, taking his MA degree in 1618. In the meantime he was ordained into the Church of England priesthood at Peterborough on 21 September 1617. Bentham was appointed as parish priest of Weekley in the English county of Northamptonshire on 24 February 1618. The parish was in the gift of the local landowner, Edward Montagu, described by one source as the sponsor of a \\"moderate puritan brotherhood\\", and by another as \\"a bountiful patron [to Bentham]\\". Bentham was a sufficiently engaging preacher to attract congregation members away from neighbouring parishes to his Sunday services, but the greater emphasis for like minded Christians locally was on the regular so-called Kettering lectures delivered, frequently by Joseph Bentham, in the nearby market town. In 1630 the newly appointed Bishop of Peterborough, William Piers, took steps to eliminate disruptive puritan preaching in his diocese. Joseph Bentham was expressly and prominently listed among the preachers allowed to continue, however, and the next year, on 24 December 1631, Bentham was translated to the larger parish of Broughton (which was also in the gift of Edward Montagu). Bentham was encouraged by fellow clergymen Robert Bolton and Nicholas Estwick to publish some of his \\"wise and witty\\" sermons, and during the 1630s two volumes appeared, entitled \\"The Societie of the Saints\\" (1630) and \\"The Christian Conflict\\" (1635). In a sermon published in 1630 Bentham declared that he was proud to be denounced by the ungodly as a \\"puritan\\". Puritans, he asserted, were \\"practising Protestants; such men who daily reade the Scriptures, pray with their families, teach them the way to heaven ... [and who] ... spend the Lord's daies holily in hearing God's Word, prayer, meditation, conference, singing of Psalmes, meditation of the creatures, are merciful to the poore, diligent in their particular Callings, frame their lives according to God's will revealed in his Word\\". While less than enthusiastic about aspects of the religious orthodoxy increasingly propounded by government, Bentham's theology was nevertheless non-confrontational in respect of the state: he was, in the words of one source, keen \\"to prevent the godly from molestation by the courts\\". As politics became ever more polarised those with influence found themselves under increasing pressure to nail their colours to one of the two available masts, and Bentham's patron, Edward Montagu, whose earlier parliamentary career had been marked by a preference for attending his Northamptonshire constituents' interests rather than for involvement in national debate, came out as a partisan for the king. Joseph Bentham implicitly chose the same side as his patron. During the early 1640s Bentham compiled a biography of Montagu, described by one authority as \\"obsequious\\", but which remained unpublished. On 13 July 1643 a parliamentary committee selected Bentham for expulsion from his parish. In the words of the (evidently sympathetic) eighteenth century antiquarian, John Bridges, Bentham \\"was sequestered by order of the parliament committee .... for his loyalty, conformity, and exemplary life; by which vices, as the committee told him, he did more harm to God's cause than twenty other men, and should therefore fare the worse for it. His wife and five children were with himself turned out of doors, with this additional circumstance of inhumanity, that he was not permitted to take a single peck of corn out of his barn to make bread for his family; nor did his wife ever recover her fifths, though she several times petitioned the committee for them. He was succeeded by John Bazeley, who seized the corn upon the ground, though he did not preach till October, and Mr. Bentham had paid the taxes to that harvest,' Reflecting the uncompromising progress of the civil war under way, Bentham's patron, Edward Montagu, had been arrested by parliamentary forces the previous year, in August 1642, and would die while still in detention in 1644, so was in no position to help. From Bentham's own writings it is known that from 24 December 1646 Thomas Tyringham of Lower Winchendon, a royalist gentleman who, like Bentham himself, maintained a low profile during the Commonwealth, provided Bentham with a \\"quiet haven ...[where]... by the people's kindness, [especially Tyringham's own, Bentham had, following a period of] ...boisterous and tempestuous storms ... comfortably and contentedly continued ...[till 1660]... in an hyred house, ...[and ]... without craving and often giving thanks, yet without being burdensome.\\" The king returned to London in May 1660, and on 29 September 1660 Joseph Bentham was restored to his clerical incumbency at Broughton, which is where he would spend the rest of his life. During the 1660s he published two more books, entitled \\"The Right of Kings by Scripture\\" (1661) and \\"A Disswasive from Error\\" (1669). He died on 16 April 1671 and, three days later, was buried under the chancel of his church.

It was used to propel the Hs 293 anti-ship guided missile. It was produced by Hellmuth Walter Kommanditgesellschaft (HWK). Like other Walter engines it used hydrogen peroxide as a propellant.  Missile  The Hs293 has been variously described as a missile or as a boosted glide bomb. It consisted of an SC500 bomb casing, fitted with wings, engine and radio control. Control equipment was housed in a rearward extension of the bomb casing but the motor was mounted in a separate housing beneath. It had originally been developed as an unpowered glide bomb, \\"Gustav Schwartz Propellerwerke\\", and the engine was added later. After flight tests, a visible tracking flare was also added, in a further rearward extension. As the engine was mounted below the missile fuselage, the exhaust nozzle pointed downwards at 30¬∞, so as to align the line of thrust with the centre of gravity of the missile. The engine had a burning time of around 10 seconds. After this the missile glided to the target, taking up to 100 seconds for a range of 8.5 km. As it was intended for attacking lightly- or unarmoured targets, it did not require an armour-piercing high impact speed. The same engine was also used for the planned Hs 294, Hs 295 and Hs 296 missiles. As these larger missiles weighed twice the Hs 293, they used a pair of the engines, one under each wing root.  Development  This engine was a development of the HWK 109-500 Starthilfe (rocket-assisted take-off) engine. The 109-500 was pod-mounted and parachuted back to earth after takeoff. Engine pods were serviced and re-used. The 109-507 was developed from the 109-500. As a missile engine, it was only required to work once, and for a short duration. It was thus simplified in both its features and in its construction materials. Rather than the complex centrifugal turbopumps used for most Walter engines, a simple gas pressurisation system was used to feed the propellants. A wartime British report expressed surprise that the engine's combustion chamber was made of mere mild steel, rather than anything more refractory.  Engine  Rocket motor, casing removed The engine's fuel chemistry used 80% high test hydrogen peroxide or 'T-Stoff'. This was a 'cold cycle' engine; the peroxide acted as a monopropellant and was decomposed by a catalyst into superheated steam and oxygen. The catalyst used was a consumable liquid solution of calcium permanganate or 'Z-Stoff'. As this catalyst is consumed, the engine is regarded as a bipropellant engine. Propellants are forced into the combustion chamber by compressed air, stored at in two steel vessels. This pressure is released through an electrically-fired cartridge that opens a valve with a blow-out disc. This is the full extent of the electrical control system. Once fired, the valve does not close again. A pressure regulator delivers air at , through a shuttle valve that pressurised first the catalyst tanks and then the propellant tank. This delay ensures reliable ignition in the combustion chamber. A non-return valve ensures that no catalyst can flow backwards into the air or propellant plumbing, with an explosive result. A rubber diaphragm, broken as propellant pressure builds, ensures that there is no backflow through the combustion chamber either. Z-stoff was known for problems of clogging injectors and so an inline filter was used. The propellant injector in the combustion chamber is a simple light alloy casting, cooled by the propellant flow. The combustion chamber is single-walled mild steel, with no provision for cooling. A steel mixing cup is downstream of the injector, with the radial Z-Stoff 6mm pipe leading into it. One 3 mm diameter injector nozzle points into the cup, thirty smaller radial 2 mm nozzles deliver most of the propellant along the walls of the chamber.

Development From 1944 to 1948 Bartini devoted much effort to the development of the T-117 heavy transport aircraft. Work on the project started whilst Bartini was working at TsKB 29 NKVD as a detainee. Initially designated P-7, the aircraft, designed in both passenger and cargo versions, was a high-wing monoplane with triple vertical tails powered by two Shvetsov ASh-73 18-cylinder radial engines, with take-off rating of . A peculiarity of the project was the fuselage of elliptical cross-section with the larger axis horizontal. The basic assault transport version was designed to carry a load of , carrying self-propelled guns, lorries, motorcycles, mortars, artillery pieces of up to calibre and other items loaded through a rear cargo hatch with detachable loading ramps. Because of the wide fuselage, it was possible to transport two GAZ-67 jeeps side by side. Alternatively, 80 troops could be carried on 4 lengthwise rows of seats. There were several passenger versions with different cabin layouts, allowing the carriage of up to 50 passengers over a distance of at a cruising speed of . Construction of a prototype started in 1946, but in 1948 work was halted due to a shortage of ASh-7 engines which were needed for the Tupolev Tu-4 strategic bomber, which had been given priority on the personal directive of Joseph Stalin. There were several projected variants of the T-117 with alternative powerplants, including the Shvetsov ASh-82FN, the experimental Shvetsov ASh-2 four-row radial and the Klimov VK-2 turboprop, but this did not save the project. The uncompleted T-117 prototype never had engines fitted and was scrapped.

Mangone's skills were manifold: he worked as sculptor, architect, stonecutter and building estimator. Moreover, he was a keen antiquarian and among the founders of the Academy dei Virtuosi al Pantheon. As military engineer, he was renowned among his contemporaries. Life and works Tomb of Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt at Santa Maria dell'Anima in Rome Born around the end of the fifteenth century by Francesco, a native of Caravaggio in Lombardy, according to Giorgio Vasari he studied under sculptor and architect Andrea Ferrucci from Fiesole.Ghisetti Giavarina (2007) In Rome, where he lived in a palace in via delle Coppelle, between Sant'Agostino and palazzo Baldassini, at the beginning of his career had several assignments; from 1527 to 1532 he was superintendent to the spring of S. Peter; until 1541, he was curator of the gold-leaf ceiling of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore; since 1528 and until his death, he was architect of the apostolic Chamber. Moreover, during his whole career he worked also as building estimator. In 1534 started his collaboration with Antonio da Sangallo the Younger: together they prepared apparati effimeri in wood to celebrate the crowning of Pope Paul III (r. 1534-49) and in 1536, the visit to Rome of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. In 1537 Mangone modified the monastery of the Servites near the Church of San Marcello al Corso, which he completed. However, due to subsequent changes in the seventeenth century, his work at the monastery is no longer recognizable. Perhaps since 1532 he designed for Angelo Massimo a palace south of Piazza Navona, in rione Parione.Pericoli Ridolfini (1973), p. 120 The building, which in 1537 had been completed until its piano nobile, was erroneously named after king Pyrrhus of Epirus because of a statue (actually of Mars) once on display on a yard's niche and now at the Musei Capitolini. The edifice is adjacent to the palace named Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne, realized in those years by Baldassare Peruzzi and commissioned by Angelo's brother Pietro. Palazzo Massimo di Pirro is Mangone's only certain architectural work still extant. In this building his model is Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, of whom he adopts typological schemes and - partially - stylistic features. Anyway, in several elements, like the design of the irregular yard, the adoption of loggias with architrave, the usage of decorative elements as corbels, the equilibrium of the fa√ßade, he shows an original style.Gigli (1992) p. 144 Based on stylistic analysis, have been attributed to him also the palazzo Alicorni in Borgo Vecchio (later piazza Rusticucci) in Borgo (demolished in 1931 and later rebuilt) and - more doubtfully - the Palazzetto De Vellis in Piazza Santa Maria in Trastevere. As a sculptor, only two works have been attributed to him: well-done appears to be the funerary monument to Cardinal Willem van Enckevoirt (dead in 1534) in Santa Maria dell'Anima, where is evident an influence from Michelangelo, while that of the bishop of Chiusi and Governor of Bologna Gregorio Magalotti in Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, engraved in 1538, radiates a cold feeling. As a military architect, in 1542 Mangone was summoned together with other architects by Paul III, who wanted to enhance the fortifications of Borgo, and in that occasion he presented a project. The following year he was active in Sermoneta, working at the town's walls. Mangone was also a keen antiquarian, and collected in his palace a good deal of architectural and sculptural pieces. In 1543, defining himself as a sculptor, he was among the founding members of the Congregation of \\"St. Joseph in the Holy Land at the Rotonda\\", later known as the Accademia dei Virtuosi al Pantheon, one of the main centers of discussions about antiquities and architecture in Rome. On 25 June 1543 he made his will, dying perhaps on the same day. Significance Palazzo Alicorni (here before its demolition in 1931 and later reconstruction) could be attributed to Mangone because of its stylistic resemblance with the Palazzo di Pirro As a sculptor, Mangone followed Andrea Sansovino, reaching mixed results. As an architect, his former education as a sculptor and stonemason in the design of moldings allowed him to reach a remarkable equilibrium of proportions. Moreover, Mangone was among the first to spread the \\"severe\\" style initiated by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. With the Palazzo di Pirro, he designed a good example of \\"everyday\\" architecture which found many imitators in the second part of 16th century. As a military architect, although he was praised by the military engineer Francesco De Marchi, the absence of extant works which can be attributed to him makes difficult to assess its real contribution to this field.

History CQDs were first discovered by Xu et al. in 2004 accidentally during the purification of single-walled carbon nanotubes. This discovery triggered extensive studies to exploit the fluorescence properties of CQDs. Much progress has been achieved in the synthesis, properties and applications of CQDs. As a new class of fluorescent carbon nanomaterials, CQDs possess the attractive properties of high stability, good conductivity, low toxicity, environmental friendliness, simple synthetic routes as well as comparable optical properties to quantum dots. Carbon quantum dots have been extensively investigated especially due to their strong and tunable fluorescence emission properties, which enable their applications in biomedicine, optronics, catalysis, and sensing. The fundamental mechanisms responsible of the fluorescence capability of CQDs are very debated. Some authors have provided evidence of size-dependent fluorescence properties, suggesting that the emission arises from electronic transitions with the core of the dots, influenced by quantum confinement effects, whereas other works have rather attributed the fluorescence to recombination of surface-trapped charges, or proposed a form of coupling between core and surface electronic states. The excitation-dependent fluorescence of CQDs, leading to their characteristic emission tunability, has been mostly linked to the inhomogeneous distribution of their emission characteristics, due to polydispersity, although some works have explained it as a violation of Kasha's rule arising from an unusually slow solvent relaxation.  Properties of CQDs  The structures and components of CQDs determine their diverse properties. Many carboxyl moieties on the CQD surface impart excellent solubility in water and biocompatibility. CQDs are also suitable for chemical modification and surface passivation with various organic, polymeric, inorganic or biological materials. By surface passivation, the fluorescence properties as well as physical properties of CQDs are enhanced. Recently, it has been discovered that amine and hydoxamic acid functionalized CD can produce tricolor (green, yellow and red) emission when introduced with different pH environment and this tricolor emission can be preserved in ORMOSIL film matrix. A paper published in 2019 showed that CQD can resist temperatures as high as 800¬∞C, paving way for applications of CQD in high temperature environments. Based on carbon, CQDs possess such properties as good conductivity, benign chemical composition, photochemical and thermal stability.  Synthesis of CQDs  Synthetic methods for CQDs are roughly divided into two categories, \\"top-down\\" and \\"bottom-up\\" routes. These can be achieved via chemical, electrochemical or physical techniques. The CQDs obtained could be optimized during preparation or post-treatment. Modification of CQDs is also very important to get good surface properties which are essential for solubility and selected applications.  Synthetic methods  \\"Top-down\\" synthetic route refers to breaking down larger carbon structures such as graphite, carbon nanotubes, and nanodiamonds into CQDs using laser ablation, arc discharge, and electrochemical techniques. For example, Zhou et al. first applied electrochemical method into synthesis of CQDs. They grew multi-walled carbon nanotubes on a carbon paper, then they inserted the carbon paper into an electrochemical cell containing supporting electrolyte including degassed acetonitrile and 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate. Later, they applied this method in cutting CNTs or assembling CNTs into functional patterns which demonstrated the versatile callability of this method in carbon nanostructure manipulations. \\"Bottom-up\\" synthetic route involves synthesizing CQDs from small precursors such as carbohydrates, citrate, and polymer-silica nanocomposites through hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment, supported synthetic, and microwave synthetic routes. For instance, Zhu et al. described a simple method of preparing CQDs by heating a solution of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and saccharide in 500 W microwave oven for 2 to 10 min. Recently, green synthetic approaches have also been employed for fabrication of CQDs.  Size control  To achieve uniform properties for particular applications and mechanic study, it is of great importance of control the size of CQDs during preparing process or via post-treatment. A majority of the reports demonstrated the processes of purifying the as-synthesized CQDs fragments via post-treatment such as filtration, centrifugation, column chromatography and gel-electrophoresis. In addition to post-treatment, controlling the size of CQDs during the preparing process is also widely used. For instance, Zhu et al. reported hydrophilic CQDs through impregnation of citric acid precursor. After pyrolyzing CQDs at 300¬∞C for 2 hours in air, then removing silica, followed by dialysis, they prepared CQDs with a uniform size of 1.5‚Äì2.5 nm which showed low toxicity, excellent luminescence, good photostability, and up-conversion properties.  Modification  Being a new type of fluorescent nanoparticles, applications of CQD lie in the field of bioimaging and biosensing due to their biological and environmental friendly composition and excellent biocompatibility. In order to survive the competition with conventional semiconductor quantum dots, a high quantum yield should be achieved. Although a good example of CQDs with ~80% quantum yield was synthesized, most of the quantum dots synthesized have a quantum yield below 10% so far. Surface-passivation and doping methods for modifications are usually applied for improving quantum yield. To prevent surfaces of CQDs from being polluted by their environment, surface passivation is performed to alleviate the detrimental influence of surface contamination on their optical properties. A thin insulating layer is formed to achieve surface passivation via the attachment of polymeric materials on CQDs surface treated by acid. In addition to surface passivation, doping is also a common method used to tune the properties of CQDs. Various doping methods with elements such as N, S, P have been demonstrated for tuning the properties of CQDs, among which N doping is the most common way due to its great ability in improving the photo luminescence emissions. The mechanisms by which Nitrogen doping enhances the fluorescence quantum yield of CQDs, as well as the structure of heavily N-doped CDs, are very debated issues in the literature. Zhou et al applied XANES and XEOL in investigating the electronic structure and luminescence mechanism in their electrochemically produced carbon QDS and found that N doping is almost certainly responsible for the blue luminescence. Synthesis of new nanocomposites based on CDs have been reported with unusual properties. For example, a new nanocomposite has been designed by using of CDs and magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles as precursors with nanozymetic activity.  Applications  CQDs with unique properties have great potential in biomedicine, optronics, catalysis and sensors Possessing such superior properties as low toxicity and good biocompatibility renders CQDs favorable materials for applications in bioimaging, biosensor and drug delivery. Based on the excellent optical and electronic properties, CQDs can also find applications in catalysis, sensors, and optronics.  Bioimaging  CQDs can be used for bioimaging due to their fluorescence emissions and biocompatibility. By injecting solvents containing CQDs into a living body, images in vivo can be obtained for detection or diagnosis purposes. One example is that organic dye-conjugated CQDs could be used as an effective fluorescent probes for H2S. The presence of H2S could tune the blue emission of the organic dye-conjugated CQDs to green. So by using a fluorescence microscope, the organic dye-conjugated CQDs were able to visualize changes in physiologically relevant levels of H2S.  Sensing  CQDs were also applied in biosensing as biosensor carriers for their flexibility in modification, high solubility in water, nontoxicity, good photostability, and excellent biocompatibility. The biosensors based on CQD and CQs-based materials could be used for visual monitoring of cellular copper, glucose, pH, trace levels of H2O2 and nucleic acid. A general example is about nucleic acid lateral flow assays. The discriminating tags on the amplicons are recognized by their respective antibodies and fluorescence signals provided by the attached CQDs. More generally, the fluorescence of CQDs efficiently responds to pH, local polarity, and to the presence of metal ions in solution, which further expands their potential for nanosensing applications, for instance in the analysis of pollutants.  Drug delivery  The nontoxicity and biocompatibility of CQDs enable them with broad applications in biomedicine as drug carriers, fluorescent tracers as well as controlling drug release. This is exemplified by the use of CQDs as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy to destroy cancer cells.  Catalysis  The flexibility of functionalization with various groups CQDs makes them possible to absorb lights of different wavelengths, which offers good opportunities for applications in photocatalysis. CQDs-modified P25 TiO2 composites exhibited improved photocatalytic H2 evolution under irradiation with UV-Vis. The CQDs serve as a reservoir for electrons to improve the efficiency of separating of the electron-hole pairs of P25.  Optronics  CQDs possess the potential in serving as materials for dye-sensitized solar cells, organic solar cells, supercapacitor, and light emitting devices. CQDs can be used as photosensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells and the photoelectric conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced. CQD incorporated hybrid silica based sol can be used as transparent Fluorescent paint,  Fingerprint recovery CQDs are used for the enhancement of latent fingerprints.

Ambrose (May 24, 1896 ‚Äì May 1, 1988) was a World War I veteran from the U.S. state of Illinois who served with Company I, 140th Infantry, 35th Division, American Expeditionary Forces, from 1917 to 1919, becoming nationally known for his photo at the dedication day parade for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., at the age of 86. In this widely viewed and circulated United States Defense Audiovisual Agency photo, he was photographed wearing his Doughboy uniform, helmet and field equipment, for which he was known as \\"Doughboy Joe\\". In the photo, Ambrose carries the U.S. flag that had covered the casket of his son, Clement A. Ambrose, who was killed in the Korean War in 1951. Early life Joseph Francis Ambrose was born May 24, 1896, in Joliet, Illinois. His father and mother were Austrian, and lived in a community of many German and Austrian immigrants. World War I Ambrose was drafted in 1917 and served in the United States Army until 1919. Before World War I he was a laborer at the Phoenix Horse Shoe Company. Later life and death After the war, Ambrose lived with his father and sister and worked as a heater at a gas company. Sometime in the mid-1920s, he married Marie, a Croatian speaker who was born in 1904 and had immigrated to the U.S. from Austria-Hungary in 1907. They had four sons, Joseph Jr. (1926), Norbert (1927), Clement (1928), and Rolland (1933). In 1930, Ambrose worked in the tile business and in 1942 he gave E. I. Du Pont Construction as his employer on his World War II draft registration card. Ambrose's third son, Clement A. Ambrose (1928‚Äì1951), was a sergeant in the 7th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division when he was killed in action in the Korean War at the age of 22 on February 14, 1951. Marie Ambrose died in 1980 at 76, and Joseph on May 1, 1988, less than a month before his 92nd birthday. The Joliet Public Library carries his obituary in the 1988 Obituary Index, listing him as \\"Ambrose, Joseph F. Sr. 'Doughboy Joe'.\\" Legacy Ambrose was posthumously honored in a speech given by U.S. Senator from Illinois Dick Durbin, for Veterans Day, in 2012.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Vedarajan and his consort Lakshmi as Amruthavalli. The temple is believed to be the birthplace of Thirumangai Azhwar, one of the twelve Azhwar saints. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines, while the water tank is located in a street axial to the eastern gateway. The temple has a seven-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The temple is originally believed to have been built by the Cholas, with later additions by the Vijayanagar and Thanjavur Nayak kings who commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 16th century. Vedarajan is believed to have appeared to Thirumangai Azhwar at this place. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the fourteen-day annual Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, a son of Brahma named Karthama Prajapathi did penance worshipping Vishnu to attain Moksha. Vishnu was not pleased and Lakshmi, his consort was not convinced with Vishnu testing Karthama. She hid herself in the lotus tank at this place. Vishnu came in search of her and after finding her, he took her to Vaikunta. It is believed that Vishnu is sported in hugging posture in the nearby Thirungari also on account of the legend. Karthama took many births during various ages like Treta Yuga and Dwapara Yuga, but Vishnu told him that he would get Moksha only during Kali Yuga. During Kali Yuga, Karthama was born as prince Sangabalan. During his young age, he wanted to marry Kumudavalli. She was an ardent devotee of Vishnu and stipulated that she would marry him only if he feeds thousand Vaishnavites, the devotees of Vishnu. Sangabalan started feeding the devotees and he also resorted to burglary to fund it. Vishnu came with Lakshmi incognito in his path and he tried to rob them as well. Vishnu uttered the Ashtatra Mantra in his ears and he turned into Thirumangai Azhwar. Since Vishnu in the form of Ranganatha gave darshan to the Azhwar and his wife, the presiding deity is called Kalyana Ranganatha. The place is locally called Azhwar Koil and also called Vedarajapuram. History and literary mention While the exact history of the temple could not be ascertained, it is originally believed to have been built by the Cholas, with later additions by the Vijayanagar and Thanjavur Nayak kings who commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 16th century. Vedarajan temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Kulasekara Azhwar and Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture thumb Vedarajan temple covers an area of about and has a seven-tiered gopuram (gateway tower) raising to a height of . The temple in enclosed in a rectangular enclosure with huge granite walls. The sanctum is approached through a second gateway tower. There are a series of pillared structure around the basement of the first enclosure. The central shrine has an elevated structure and houses the image of the presiding deity, Vedarajan. The image is made of granite is sported in sitting posture. The festival deity is named Kalyana Ranganathar and the image is also housed in the sanctum. The vimana, the shrine over the sanctum is Ashtanga in architecture, which has eight parts. The outer parts of the vimana has stucco images of sages, Dasavatara, Lakshmi Narasimha, Lakshmi Narayana and other Avatars of Vishnu. A north facing shrine of Thirumangai Azhwar is located in the same elevated enclosure. There is a separate flag staff for the Azhwar shrine. It is believed that the two images of Narasimhar in the temple are among the five original images of Narasimha worshipped by Thirumangai Azhwar. There is a small image of Chindanaikiniyan, which is also believed to have been worshipped by the Azhwar. The shrine of Amruthavalli is located in the basement, in the diagonal corner of the first enclosure. Religious practices and festival Thirumangai Azhwar with his consort Kumudavalli The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai follows Vaikasana aagama. The temple is open from 7:30-11:30 am and between 4-9:30 pm. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., and Aravanai Pooja at 8:00 p.m. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam is the most prominent festival of the temple. During the new moon day of the Tamil month Thai (January - February), the festival deity of Thirumangai Azhwar is taken to the Thirumanimadam from Thirunagari. The major event of the festival is Garudasevai in which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. The festive image of Thirumangai Azhwar is brought on a Hamsa Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these eleven temples are recited during the occasion. The festival images of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Kumudavalli Naachiyar are taken in the palanquin to each of the eleven temples. The verses dedicated to each of the eleven temples are chanted in the respective shrines. This is one of the most important festivals in the region attended by thousands of pilgrims. The other festivals celebrated in the temple are the ten-day Vaikasi Swathi festival, Pavitrotsavam during Aani (June - July) and Panguni Uthiram during Panguni (March - April).

A multiracial or biracial person is someone whose parents or ancestors are from different racial backgrounds. Over time many terms have been used to describe those that have a multiracial background. Some of the terms used in the past are considered insulting and offensive (mutt, mongrel, half breed); these terms were given because a person was not recognized by one specific race. While multiracial identity development refers to the process of identity development of individuals who self-identify with multiple racial groups. Multiracial individuals are defined as those whose parents are of two or more distinct racial groups.  Background  Racial identity development defines an individual's attitudes about self-identity, and directly affects the individual's attitudes about other individuals both within their racial group(s) and others. Racial identity development often requires individuals to interact with concepts of inequality and racism that shape racial understandings in America. Research on biracial and multiracial identity development has been influenced by previous research on race. Most of this initial research is focused on black racial identity development (Cross, 1971) and minority identity development (Morten and Atkinson, 1983). Like other identities, mixed race people have not been easily accepted in the United States. Numerous laws and practices prohibited interracial sex, marriage, and therefore, mixed race children. Below are some landmark moments in mixed race history.  Miscegenation laws  Anti-miscegenation laws or miscegenation laws enforced racial segregation through marriage and intimate relationships by criminalizing interracial marriage. Certain communities also prohibit having sexual intercourse with a person of another race. As a result of the Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia, these laws have since been changed in all U.S. states - interracial marriage is permitted. The last states to change these laws were South Carolina and Alabama. South Carolina made this change in 1998 and in 2000, Alabama became the last state in the United States to legalize interracial marriage.  Biracial and multiracial categorization  \\"One Drop Rule\\" = The one-drop rule is a historical social and legal principle of racial classification in the United States. The one drop rule asserts that any person with one ancestor of African ancestry is considered to be Black. This idea was influenced by the concept of \\"white purity\\" and concerns of those \\"tainted\\" with black ancestry passing as white in the U.S's deeply segregated south. In this time, classification as Black rather than mulatto or mixed became prevalent. The \\"One Drop Rule\\" was used as a way to make people of color, especially multiracial Americans feel even more inferior and confused and was put into effect in the 1920s. No other country in the world at the time had thought of or implemented such a discriminatory and specific rule on its citizens The One Drop Rule in a way was taking the Jim Crow Law to a new extreme level to make sure it stayed in power and was used as another extreme measure of social classification. Eventually, biracial and multiracial individuals challenged this assumption and created a new perspective of biracial identity and included the \\"biracial\\" option on the census. = Hypodescent = The concept of hypodescent refers to the automatic assignment of children of a mixed union between different socioeconomic or ethnic groups to the group with the lower status. This is especially prevalent in the United States where the \\"one drop rule is still upheld as Whites were a historically dominant social group. People of mixed race ancestry would be categorized as the nonwhite race using this concept. Even in mixed race offspring with no white parent, the racist \\"one drop rule\\" places the nonblack racial group as dominant so that the offspring is socially considered black. = Phenotype = A way of classifying someone by looking at their physical appearances, like facial features, skull shape, hair texture etc. and choosing their race based on what they look like. = The U.S. Census = Before 2000 United States Census respondents were only able to select one race when submitting census data. This means that the census contained no statistical information regarding particular racial mixes and their frequency in the U.S. before this time. Census questions in 2010 and 1990 regarding race  Demographics  The population of biracial and multiracial people in the U.S. is growing. A comparison of data from the 2000 and 2010 United States Census indicates an overall population increase in individuals identifying with two or more races from 6.8 million people to 9 million people (US Census Data, 2010). In examining specific race combinations, the data showed that, \\"people who reported White as well as Black or African American‚Äîa population that grew by over one million people, increasing by 134 percent‚Äîand people who reported White as well as Asian‚Äîa population that grew by about three-quarters of a million people, increasing by 87 percent\\" (US Census Data, 2010). In 2004, one in 40 persons in the United States self-identified as a multiracial, and by the year 2050, it is projected that as many as one in five Americans will claim a Multiracial background, and in turn, a Multiracial or Biracial identity (Lee & Bean, 2004). centre  Early theories  When initial racial identity development research is applied to biracial and multiracial people, there are limitations, as they fail to recognize variance in developmental experiences that occur within racial groups (Gibbs, 1987). This research assumes that individuals would choose to identify with, or choose to reject, one racial group over another dependent on life stage. Also, initial racial identity development research does not address real-life resolutions for people upholding multiple racial group identities (Poston, 1990). These assumptions display the need for biracial and multiracial identity development that focuses on the unique aspects of the experience of biracial and multiracial identity development. These theories can be categorized under the following approaches: problem, equivalent, variant, and ecological.  Problem Approach  This approach predicts negative outcomes of having multiracial identity. Originating from the Jim Crow era, this theoretical angle focuses on the deficits and problems that are a result of multiracial identities, concluding multiracial individuals are more often victims of rejection, isolation, stigmatization even from both the identities they represent. As a result, multiracial individuals often deal with negative outcomes such as an inferiority complex, hypersensitivity, and moodiness due to their experiences with society. = Stonequist's Marginal Person Model = American sociologist, Everett Stonequist was the first to publish research about the identity development of biracial individuals. His book, The Marginal Man: A Study in Personality and Culture Conflict (1937) discusses pathology in Black families through comparison of Black minority samples to White majority samples. Stonequist claimed that developing a biracial identity is a marginal experience, in which biracial people belong in two worlds and none all at the same time. That they experience uncertainty and ambiguity, which can worsen problems people face identifying with their own racial groups and others (Gibbs, 1987). Building upon the \\"marginal man\\", Stonequist (1937) explained that multiracial individuals have a heightened awareness and adaptability to both sides of racial conflict between African Americans and caucasians. As a result, there is an internal crisis within the multiracial individual due to the cultural conflicts that surround them. This internal conflict can be seen in the form of \\"confusion, shock, disillusionment, and estrangement\\". A primary limitation of this model is that it is largely internal and focused on development within biracial individuals. The model does not discuss factors such as racism or racial hierarchy, which can worsen feelings of marginality for biracial persons. It does not address other functions of marginality that could also affect biracial identity development such as conflict between parental racial groups, or absence of influence from one racial identity (Hall, 2001). The model fails to describe the experience of biracial people that exhibit characteristics of both races without conflict or feelings of marginality (Poston, 1990).  Modern theories  To address the limitations of Stonequist's Marginal Person Model, researchers have expanded biracial identity development research based on relevant and current understandings of biracial people. Most concepts of biracial identity development highlight the need for racial identity development across the lifespan. This type of development recognizes that identity is no more static a cultural entity than any other and that this fluidity of identity is shaped by the individual's social circumstances and capital (Hall, 2001).  Equivalent Approach  The equivalent approach presents a positive angle towards multiracial identity development, explaining racial identity cultivation is equivalent between monoracial and multiracial individuals yet yields different outcomes. Stemming from the civil rights movement in the U.S. in the 1960s, this approach reorganizes what it means to be \\"black\\", encouraging mixed race people to develop a positive integration and eventual adoption of their black identity. Any negative outcomes of this process were considered to be internalized racism of their blackness from microaggressions. This theory soon proved inadequate for explaining mixed identity development, as it did not allow the identification of multiple ethnic groups nor recognize their struggles of developing racial identities. The equivalent approach was derived from Erikson's (1968) ego-identity formation model, which explains a stable identity is formed through a process of \\"exploratory and experimental stages\\" that eventually result in a racial identity. = Poston‚Äôs Biracial Identity Development Model = Walker S. Carlos Poston challenged Stonequist's Marginal Man theory and claimed that existing models of minority identity development did not reflect the experiences of biracial and multiracial individuals. Poston proposed the first model for the development of a healthy biracial and multiracial identity in 1990. This model was developed from research on biracial individuals and information from relevant support groups. Rooted in counseling psychology, the model adapts Cross‚Äô (1987) concept of reference group orientation (RGO), which includes constructions of racial identity, esteem, and ideology. Poston's model divided the biracial and multiracial identity development process into five distinct stages: # Personal Identity: young children's sense of self and personal identity is not linked to a racial or ethnic group. # Choice of Group Characterization: an individual chooses a multicultural identity that includes both parents‚Äô heritage groups or one parent's racial heritage. This stage is based on personal factors (such as physical appearance and cultural knowledge) and environmental factors (such as perceived group status and social support. # Enmeshment/Denial: confusion and guilt over not being able to identify with all aspects of one's heritage can lead to feelings of \\"anger, shame, and self-hatred\\". Resolving this guilt is necessary in order to move past this stage. # Appreciation: broadening of one's racial group membership and knowledge about multiethnic heritage, even though individuals may choose to identify with one group more than others. # Integration: recognition and appreciation of all racial and ethnic identities that make an individual unique. This model offers an alternative identity development process compared to the minority identity development models widely used in the student affairs profession. However, it does not accurately address how societal racism affects the development process of people of color and suggests that there is only one healthy identity outcome for biracial and multiracial individuals.  Variant Approach  The variant approach is one of the most contemporary racial development theories, explaining racial identity cultivation is a process that takes place over a series of stages according to age. Starting in the 1980s, new researchers sought to explain that mixed-race individuals comprised their own racial category, establishing an independent \\"multiracial identity\\". Among these researchers, Maria Root published Racially Mixed People in America (1992) which justified mixed race individuals as their own racial category, thus explaining they endure their own unique racial development. The variant approach challenges previous theoretical approaches lack integration of multical racial identities. The progression of this theory is represented by the following chronological stages: personal identity, choice of group categorization, denial, appreciation of group orientation, and integration. = Root‚Äôs Resolutions for Resolving Otherness = Maria Root's Resolutions for Resolving Otherness (1990) address the phenomenological experience of otherness in a biracial context and introduced a new identity group: multiracial. With a footing in cultural psychology, Root suggests that the strongest conflict in biracial and multiracial identity development is the tension between racial components within one's self. She presents alternative resolutions for resolving ethnic identity based on research covering the racial hierarchy and history of the U.S., and the roles of family, age, or gender in the individual's development. Root's resolutions reflect a fluidity of identity formation; rejecting the linear progression of stages followed by Poston. They include assessment of socio-cultural, political, and familial influences on biracial identity development. The four resolutions that biracial and multiracial individuals can use to positively cope with ‚Äúotherness‚Äù are as follows: # Acceptance of the identity society assigns: an individual identifies with the group that others assume they belong to the most. This is often determined by one's family ties and personal allegiance to the racial group (typically the minority group) that others assign. # Identification with both racial groups: an individual may be able to identify with both (or all) heritage groups. This is largely affected by societal support and one's ability to remain resistance to other's influences. # Identification with a single racial group: an individual chooses one racial group independently of external forces. # Identification as a new racial group: an individual may choose to move fluidly throughout racial groups, but overall identifies with other biracial or multiracial people. Root's theory suggests that mixed race individuals \\"might self-identify in more than one way at the same time or move fluidity among a number of identities,\\". These alternatives for resolving otherness are not mutually exclusive; no one resolution is better than another. As explained by Garbarini-Phillippe (2010), ‚Äúany outcome or combination of outcomes reflect a healthy and positive development of mixed-race identity,‚Äù. On the contrary, biracial adolescents who identify as part White may seem integrated but actually may not identify with any social group. Tokenism and dating are common issues for biracial adolescents and their identity. Tokenism is a practice that spotlights an individual to be the minority representative. = Kich‚Äôs Conceptualization of Biracial Identity Development = Miville, Constantine, Baysden and So-Lloyd (2005) discussed the following three-stage and six-stage models that biracial individuals experience. Kich‚Äôs Conceptualization of Biracial Identity Development (1992) focuses on the transition from straying away from the pressures of monoracial self-identity to a stronger desire of biracial self-identity as one‚Äôs age progresses. Kich‚Äôs model is divided into three stages during biracial development: # Stage 1 (3‚Äì10 years old): How one‚Äôs own feelings and what external feelings are differs. # Stage 2 (8 years old-young adulthood): Challenges revolve around feeling accepted by oneself and by others. # Stage 3 (Late adolescence/young adulthood): Completely integrates a biracial and bicultural identity. = Kerwin and Ponterotto‚Äôs Model of Biracial Identity Development = Kerwin and Ponterotto‚Äôs Model of Biracial Identity Development (1995) addresses awareness in racial identity through developmental stages based on age. This model recognizes that racial identity varies between public and private environments and is altered by different factors. Kerwin and Ponterotto state that exclusion may not only be experienced by White individuals, but also individuals of color (Miville, Constantine, Baysden & So-Lloyd, 2005). # Preschool (0‚Äì5 years old): Begins to observe differences and similarities in how they look. Levels of eagerness to discuss issues in regard to race amongst parents are apparent. # Entry to School: As involvements increase with certain groups, they are influenced with the idea of identifying with a monoracial label. # Preadolescence: Becomes more cognizant of how social groups are represented by certain characteristics such as skin tone, religion and ethnicity. Sensitivity to race differs depending on certain environmental factors such as being immersed in a monocultural or diverse context. # Adolescence: Feelings of pressure heighten to identify with the racial group that is associated with the parent of color. # College/Young Adulthood: Continues to engage in a monoracial group and subtly realizes situations involved race-related remarks. # Adulthood: Ongoing discovery on culture and race, determining self-perceptions of different identities and has stronger resilience for diversified cultural contexts.  Ecological Approach  The most recent of all racial identity development theoretical approaches, the ecological approach allows an individual to deny any part of their multiracial identity. In this theory, the following assumptions are made: multiracial individuals extract their racial identity based on their personal contextual environment, there are no consistent stages of racial identity development, and that privileging multiracial identity only extends the flaws of identity theory and does not offer tangible solutions. = Renn‚Äôs Ecological Theory of Mixed Race Identity Development = Dr. Kristen A. Renn was the first to look at multiracial identity development from an ecological lens. Renn used Urie Bronfenbrenner's Person, Process, Context, Time (PPCT) model to determine which ecological factors were most influential on biracial and multiracial identity development. Three dominant ecological factors emerged from Renn's research: physical appearance, cultural knowledge, and peer culture. Physical appearance is the most influential factor and is described as how a biracial and multiracial person looks (i.e.: skin tone, hair texture, hair color, eye and nose shape, etc.). Cultural Knowledge is the second most important factor and can include the history that a multiracial individual knows about their various heritage groups, languages spoken, etc. Peer culture, the third most influential factor, can be described as support, acceptance, and/or resistance from peer groups. For example, racism among White students is an aspect of college peer culture that can impact an individual's perception of themself. Renn conducted several qualitative studies across higher education institutions in the eastern and midwestern United States in 2000 and 2004. From the analysis of written responses, observations, focus groups, and archival sources, Renn identified five non-exclusive patterns of identity among multiracial college students. The five identity patterns recognized by Renn include the following: # Monoracial Identity: An individual identifies with one of the racial categories that makes up their heritage background. Forty-eight percent of Renn's (2004) participants identified as having a monoracial identity. # Multiple Monoracial Identities: An individual identifies with two or more racial categories that make up their heritage background. Within a given time and place, both personal and contextual factors influence how an individual chooses to identify. Forty-eight percent of the participants also self-identified with this identity pattern. # Multiracial Identity: An individual identifies as part of a ‚Äúmultiracial‚Äù or ‚Äúmixed‚Äù racial category, instead of identifying with one racial or other racial categories. According to Renn (2008), over eighty-nine percent of students from her 2004 study identified as part of a multiracial group. # Extraracial Identity: An individuals chooses to ‚Äúopt out‚Äù of racial categorization or not to identify with one of the racial categories presented in the U.S. Census. One-fourth of the students that Renn (2004) interviewed identified with this category, and saw race as a social construct with no biological roots. # Situational Identity: An individual identifies differently depending on the situation or context, reinforcing the notion that racial identity is both fluid and contextual. Sixty-one percent of Renn's (2004) participants identified in different ways depending on varying contexts. Like Root's resolutions, Renn's theory accounted for the fluidity of identity development. Each of the stages represented above are non-linear. Renn explained that some students from her studies self-identified with more than one identity pattern. This is why the total percentage of these identity patterns are more than 100 percent. For example, a participant of European and African-American descent may have identified as multiracial initially, but also as Monoracial or Multiple Monoracial depending on the context of their environment or interactions with other individuals. An ecological approach also suggests that entitling any racial identity over another regardless of being multiracial, racial or monoracial will repeat the issues of other identity models (Mawhinney & Petchauer, 2013). = Commonalities of Racial Identity Development Theories = The commonalities of these theories characterize mutli-racial identity development as marked struggle especially in early development. Most approaches reserve the ages between 3‚Äì10 years old to having confusion and outside confrontation that continue well even to adult years of a biracial individual. Some of these struggles include inconsistent identification within both private and public spaces, justifying identity choices, pressure to identify with one race, lack of role models, conflicting messages, and double rejection from both dominant and minority racial groups. These hardships are various and ultimately impact maturity and adjustment to society depending on the environment in which the child is raised and the interactions they had. = Situational Identity/ Race Switching = For many multiracial individuals, there is a lot of bouncing around between racial categories. Hitlin, Brown, and Elder Jr. (2006) studies concluded that people who identified as biracial are more likely to change how they identify than people who identified with one race their whole life. Biracial people seem to be very fluid in how they identify, but there are certain factors that make it more likely for them to identify a certain way. People who grew up with a higher social and economic status were less likely to race switch than someone who grew up in a lower status. Being around a racially charged environment can also drastically alter how much a multi-racial individual race switches. Sanchez, Shih & Garcia (2009) concluded in a study that people who were more fluid with their racial identification had worse mental health, not necessarily due to their own identity crisis but due to outsiders pressure to classify the individual. This can cause lots of stress and frustration for the multiracial individual affecting their mental health.  Racial Discrimination and Psychological Adjustment = Racial Discrimination  Racial Discrimination has affected the mental health of many multiracial individuals. Coleman and Carter (2007) concluded biracial people particularly, Black/White college students felt the need to identify as one race. A similar study done, Townsend, Markus, and Bergsieker (2009) saw that multiracial college students who were indicated to pick just one race on demographic questions ended up having less motivation and less self-esteem in comparison with other students who were allowed to choose more than one race. Since in these studies there were small study groups, the evidence does show discrimination can affect the mental health of multiracial individuals.  Psychological Adjustment  Many incidents of multiracial people being affected by the pressure to align with one race have been recorded. Simple things like microaggressions, physical and verbal abuse about the minority race in them come at many multiracial individuals. This then causes them to just force themselves to align with a certain race to stop the abuse. However, multiracial individuals who are able to identify themselves accurately during their adolescent development have higher levels of efficacy, self-esteem and lower stereotype vulnerability. A study with 3,282 students from three high schools looked at the correlation between ethnic and racial identity and self-esteem levels (Bracey, B√°maca & Uma√±a, 2004). Students reported their parents‚Äô racial categories to determine classification of racial group membership, which included a variety of monoracial and biracial identities. Findings suggest that there is a positive correlation between self-esteem and ethnic identity. Although Biracial participants did not show higher self-esteem than Black participants, they did show higher self-esteem than Asian participants. Studies show that although Biracial adolescents display less resilience to racism and have a smaller community support than Black adolescents, being bicultural introduces ‚Äúa broader base of social support, more positive attitudes toward both cultures, and a strong sense of personal identity and efficacy,‚Äù which results in high self-esteem (LaFromboise, Coleman & Gerton, 1993). LaFromboise, Coleman and Gerton use bicultural efficacy to describe an individual‚Äôs confidence in his/her capability to live within two cultural groups sufficiently without altering his/her own self-identification (1993).

The combined apparent magnitude of the pair is 9.36, which means they are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Parallax measurements from the Hipparcos spacecraft put the system at a distance of around 420 light years from the Sun. This star system was in the view field of the Kepler space telescope during 2009‚àí2014, which allowed monitoring during that spacecraft's mission. The variability of this system was discovered from photographic plates in 1935. It is a binary star system with an orbital plane that is nearly aligned with the line of sight to the Earth. Once every 2.1781542 day orbit, each of the closely orbiting stars eclipses its partner, causing a net magnitude drop to 9.4 during the primary eclipse and to magnitude 9.1 when the secondary component is eclipsed. The secondary member covers 51% of the larger star during the primary eclipse, while the primary covers 88% of the secondary. The measureable properties of an eclipsing binary can allow the physical parameters of the individual components to be worked out in some detail. The primary component has 122% of the Sun's mass, spans 128% of the radius of the Sun, and is emitting 217% of the Sun's luminosity. It is most likely an F-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of F8. The secondary is smaller, with 96% of the mass of the Sun, 96% of the Sun's radius, and radiates just 65% of the Sun's luminosity. This is a G-type main sequence star of class G8. Based upon light variations measured during eclipses by the Kepler spacecraft, the system may contain a third body with twice the mass of Jupiter and an orbital period of under seven years. As of 2015, this remains to be confirmed.

It is located on Nixon Lane in the Roxborough section of Lower Northwest Philadelphia. Built by the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad, it later became part of the Reading Railroad and ultimately SEPTA Regional Rail's R6 Norristown Line. SEPTA closed the station in 1996. In 2018, $1 million was set aside for repairs and rehabilitation. History The first railroad in Philadelphia opened on June 7, 1832: the Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad, running from downtown to Germantown (now on SEPTA's Chestnut Hill East Line). Two years later, the PG&N; built a line to Norristown, including the Shawmont station, which is believed to have been designed by renowned architect William Strickland. On December 1, 1870, the PG&N; was leased by the Philadelphia and Reading Railway (later the Reading Company). By 1884, the Pennsylvania Railroad had joined the competition with the Schuylkill Branch, a line that ran parallel to the Norristown line with a Shawmont station of its own. The Pennsylvania electrified its line in 1930, the Reading the following year. 220px Railroad service declined after World War II, and the Pennsylvania Railroad closed its Shawmont station on October 30, 1960, terminating all passenger service north of Manayunk. The Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority began arranging new contracts with the PRR and RDG to continue commuter rail services in the Philadelphia region in 1966. In 1968, the Pennsylvania merged with their much larger rival, the New York Central Railroad to form the Penn Central Railroad. Penn Central filed for bankruptcy on June 21, 1970, which, adjusted for today‚Äôs dollars, is still the largest bankruptcy filing in US history. In 1971, the Reading filed for bankruptcy. In 1976, the Reading and Penn Central were acquired by Conrail, which provided commuter rail services under contract to SEPTA until January 1, 1983, when SEPTA assumed operations. Two years before this took place, SEPTA ended diesel service to Reading and Pottsville. Shawmont station became a contributing property of the Upper Roxborough Historic District in 1995, but was closed by SEPTA in 1991. In 2009, the building was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, preserving it from potential destruction. In 2018, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission gave $1 million to rehabilitate the former station.

Built in 1892 out of locally quarried stone, it is a fine local example of Colonial Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The Canal Street Schoolhouse stands southwest of downtown Brattleboro, on a rise above the south side of Canal Street (United States Route 5), a major thoroughfare. It is a two-story stone structure, topped by a hip roof and set on a stone foundation. Its front half is nearly bisected by a projecting square tower, which is capped by an open octagonal belfry and cupola. The main facade, facing Canal Street, is symmetrical, with the main entrance in the tower base, flanked by sidelight windows, and sheltered by a semicircular portico supported by Doric columns. Above the entrance are windows arranged in Palladian fashion, the three sections each set in separate openings. A circular clock face is set on the tower's third stage, which is surmounted by a low balustrade and the belfry. The tower is flanked by single sash windows on the first floor and oval windows on the second, with bands of three sash windows at the outermost bays. The school was built in 1892, and is notable for its Colonial Revival styling, executed in local material instead of the more typical brick. The designers of the building are uncertain; a design was prepared by the firm of McKim, Meade & White, but the drawings are credited to one Robert Gordon Hardie, about whom nothing is known. It is possible that Hardie was an employee of McKim, Meade & White. The clock was paid for by a local fundraising effort, and the bell was cast by the Meneely Bell Foundry of Troy, New York and installed in 1893. At the time of its listing on the National Register in 1977, it was the only known operable school bell in the state.

It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system. AUCA is the largest Adventist University serving the French speaking parts of Africa. In 2015, it had about 4,000 students. History Adventist University of Central Africa was established in 1978, but officially opened on 15 October 1984. The school closed in 1994 due to political unrest, but was reestablished in 1996 in Kigali. Mudende Campus Initially the campus was located at Mudende, in Gisenyi prefecture (one component of the current Western Province). The University grew for 10 years until the start of Rwandan genocide (April 94 ‚Äì July 94). During the genocide there was a general breakdown in law and order, and the Mudende campus was looted by the local population, the military, militias, and even AUCA staff before they fled. After the killing stopped, the vacant campus became ‚Äúa sort of no man‚Äôs land‚Äù for several years and the Mudende campus was stripped of anything removable. At the end of 1996, the campus became a shelter for the first influx of Zairian refugees from nearby Kibumba (DRC). Although a few months later the Zairian refugees returned home, a larger group of refugees took over the campus, further stripping it of salable items and destroying fixed assets like washrooms. Conflict during the period 1997-99 saw additional looting. The University started negotiations with the Rwandan government in 1999 to sell the government the Mudende campus but it was not until 2003 that an agreement was reached. Finally in February 2006 the former campus the Government of Rwanda, represented by its Ministry of Defense, took over the old campus as a base for the Rwanda Defense Forces. Gishushu, Kigali Campus The University reopened in 1996 using modest buildings and with limited course offerings. The 1.7 ha campus was not deemed large enough for a proper university so a search commenced for a larger site. However the strategic location of Gishushu resulted in the school building a Science Centre and Technology there. Ground breaking occurred on March 8, 2012 with the Prime Minister of Rwanda and the President of the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in attendance. After a two and a half year effort, the science center was inaugurated on 11 February 2015 by the President of the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The new building contains 24 classrooms which can each hold 40 to 60 students, all with fully networked, digitally responsive whiteboards that facilitate presentations and the instant archiving of lecture notes. The university, is working to make all of its teaching materials available digitally. Even the library will be fully digitized, with e-books to students‚Äô computers. features state of the art Masoro, Kigali Campus  With proceeds from the sale of Mudende and church appropriations, a 22 ha site was secured for a new campus within sight of Kigali's International Airport. Construction of the new campus began on 12 May 2005 with ground breaking for the central academic block. Construction on a 2000-seat multi-purpose conference hall began in February 2009 and was completed in September 2011. Paving and other buildings followed. Degree courses As of 2015 AUCA offers both undergraduate and masters level programs in the following areas: Undergraduate * Faculty of Business Administration * Faculty of Education * Faculty of Theology * Faculty of Information Technology * Faculty of Medical Sciences Masters * Master of Education * Master of Business Administration MBA * Masters of Science in Administration: International Development Program In 2016 AUCA expects to open the first School of Medicine in Rwanda and Central Africa.

The Official Albums Streaming Chart is a music chart based plays of an album's songs through audio streaming services (such as Spotify, Deezer, Google Play Music, Tidal and Apple Music) in the United Kingdom. Introduced on 1 March 2015, it coincided with the Official Charts Company's decision to incorporate streaming data into the UK Albums Chart. The Official Albums Streaming Chart uses the same streaming sources as the Official Audio Streaming Chart to measure how many times albums have been streamed each week. The formula for calculating the Official Albums Streaming Chart takes the total number of streams from the twelve most streamed tracks on the standard version of an album and subtracts the difference between the two most streamed tracks and the average of the rest (to avoid hit singles boosting album sales). This is equivalent to 12 times the average number of streams of the third to twelfth most streamed tracks. Official Charts Company chief executive Martin Talbot stated: \\"The Official Charts Company's mission is to compile the most accurate, reliable and up-to-date charts around, and in 2015 that means reflecting the popularity of streaming, alongside downloads, vinyl and ‚Äì still the most popular album format ‚Äì the CD. Initial indications are that the impact on actual chart positions will be modest to begin with, but we expect this to grow as streaming becomes increasingly popular.\\" The first album to top the streaming chart was Ed Sheeran's second album x, which topped the chart on 1 March 2015 with streaming sales of 3,369.

The film stars Bar Belfer, Yonatan Bar-Or and Tzahi Grad in the lead roles. The film is about two individuals who are on different missions and how their paths cross. Bar Belfer's performance won her the Special Grand Jury Award in the World Cinema Competition at the 31st Miami International Film Festival. Synopsis The film is about two unrelated individuals named Tamar (Bar Belfer) and Assaf (Yonatan Bar-Or). Tamar is an amazingly talented singer but very quiet and insecure girl who came to Jerusalem in search of her brother. She has left everyone behind including her family and got a makeover by buzzing her hair to become unrecognizable in the process. Tamar makes her ends meet by playing guitar and singing in the streets. Her impromptu performances attract the attention of Pesach (Tzahi Grad), who claims to look after the city's sidewalk performers. The truth is Pesach is a criminal who charges buskers for the right to perform in the best spots in town and all but holds them hostage in a rundown hostel he's set up from them. On the other hand, Assaf is a 17-year-old boy who is working on a boring summer job at the City Hall. Assaf is a clumsy, naive, and very shy boy. One day he was given a job to find the owners of a stray dog. Unsure where to start, Asif decides to follow the lead of the dog. The dog leads to him various people and parts of the city and combining the various clues he gets from them, Assaf learns that the dog belongs to Tamar. The rest of the movie deals with how Assaf reunites the dog with Tamar and how Tamar saves herself from the clutches of Pesach. Cast * Bar Belfer as Tamar * Yonatan Bar-Or as Assaf * Yuval Mendelson as Shai * Rinat Matatov as Shelly * Tzahi Grad as Pesach * Danny Steg as Tzahi * Neomi Polani as Theodora * Rami Davidoff as Yonatan * Smadar Jaaron as Lea Reception Christopher Farah on Salon.com described the book as one \\"that may make the cynics out there snicker, the literary purists smirk, and the sentimentalists weep with joy or smug, self-fulfilled sadness.\\" The book's film adaptation has been met with positive reviews. Variety magazine Ronnie Scheib praised the performances of Bar-Or and Belfer, saying \\"[they] manage to inject their characters with enough wistfulness, sweetness and compassion to prevent their strength from reading as self-righteousness.\\". Awards and nominations The film received nominations in 12 categories at the 2006 Israeli Film Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

Washboard is the common name used for Megalonaias nervosa.  Description  The shell is divided into two valves that are hinged. Shell is thick and rectangular in shape and can be compressed or inflated; umbos do not extend above the hinge line (Cicerello, R. and Schuster, G. 2003). The cardinal teeth are large and serrated, while the lateral teeth are long and curved. Shell color ranges from dark brown to black and is covered with small bumps and has fluted ridges: nacre is white to gray color. Life Cycle: Megalonaias nervosa mussels are sexually mature around 8 years of age, they are late tachytictic breeders. From July to October the males are mature, while they female contain eggs from August through October (Hollandbartels, L. 1993). Megalonaias nervosa males release sperm and the females collect the sperm through the incurrent siphon. The eggs are fertilized internally. Megalonaias nervosa has a parasitic larva stage called glochidia, the mussel uses a lure to attract fish and then releases the glochidia when the fish is close enough. The glochidia latch onto the gills or fins of the fish and remain there feeding of the blood of the fish until the glochidia reach the juvenile stage. Known host species for Megalonaias nervosa include longnose gar (Lepisosteus ossues), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), slender- head darter (Percina phoxocephala), and log perch (Percina caprodes) (O‚ÄôDee, S. and Watters, T. 1998). Parent mussel provides no care once the glochidia are released. Megalonaias nervosa are filter feeders, waste is released through the excurrent siphon. They are sedentary creatures and are anchored to the substrate or buried in the substrate. Studies had shown water temperature plays a role in reproduction, if the water temperature is too low, the mussels will not reproduce.  Habitat  Megalonaias nervosa can be found in small or larger rivers and in a variety of substrate including mud, sand, or gravel. Although Megalonaias nervosa is of least conservation concern, mussels have suffered from habitat loss caused by pollution, invasive species and impoundment of water. Megalonaias nervosa reproduction rate has decreased in some areas due to low water temperature (Heinricher, J. and Layzer, J. 1999). Range: Megalonaias nervosa can be found in the Mississippi drainage, in the Gulf drainage from Ochlockonee River system west of the Rio Grande, and extends into northeastern Mexico. Does not occur in Canada. (Nature serve) Megalonaias nervosa is similar to Threeridge (Amblema plicata) and Rock pocketbook (Arcidens confragosus).  References  *Cicerello, R., and Schuster, G.

The first ruler of the Dominican Republic, he had a significant participation in the movement for Dominican independence.  Biography  He was born in Neiba on 30 March 1785, son of Vicente Bobadilla Amaral, and Gregoria Justina Briones P√©rez. He devoted to the political life and the writing. In 1810, when he reached the age of majority in force at that time (25 years of age), Bobadilla obtained his certification of \\"Cleanliness of Blood\\", as all of both his paternal grandparents and maternal great-grandparents had been born in Europe, this certificate allowed him access to high public offices of the colonial administration, reserved to white Dominicans and Peninsulars.Guido Despradel Batista (autor); Alfredo Rafael Hern√°ndez (compilador) (2009). From the period known as Espa√±a Boba or \\"Fool Spain\\", he occupied very important positions. He was fellow of Jos√© N√∫√±ez de C√°ceres y Albor and participated in politics during the Ephemeral Independence. Bobadilla exerted the position of Public Scribe in 1811, and afterwards, he became Greater Notary of the Archbishop Pedro Valera y Jim√©nez. During the ephemeral Independence, proclaimed by N√∫√±ez de C√°ceres in late 1821, Bobadilla occupied the office of First Official of the General Treasury of the State, a few months before the Haitian annexation. Afterwards, in 1830, he was appointed public defender and notary of Santo Domingo, in 1831. On 12 May 1832, he married in Santo Domingo to Mar√≠a Virginia Desmier D‚ÄôOlbreuse y Allard, descendant of French colonists of noble origin from the House of Desmier-Olbreuse. They had 5 children born out of wedlock: Mar√≠a del Carmen Leonor (b. 1823), Mar√≠a Vicenta (b. 1824), Gerardo (b. 1827), Carlos Tom√°s (b. 1830), Jos√© Mar√≠a (b. 1830); they had a daughter after their wedding: Clemencia Antonia (who was the mother of Adolfo Alejandro Nouel). Upon learning the plans of the Trinitarians on Independence, he was lured to the independence movement. Bobadilla attracted a lot of people so they join of the pro-independence activities. He is considered the author of the Manifesto of 16 January 1844, the act of Independence of the Dominican Republic. On the night of 27 February 1844, Bobadilla was present in the Count‚Äôs Gate. He participated in the events of 27 February 1844, beside Francisco del Rosario S√°nchez and Mat√≠as Ram√≥n Mella. After the initial fighting, liberal Trinitarians and conservative Frenchifieds begun the organisation of the Dominican State on 1 March 1844; they established a cabinet called the \\"Central Gubernative Junta\\" and chose Bobadilla as President. Because of his ideas to annexate the newly independent state of Santo Domingo to France or achieve a French protectorate, President Bobadilla was deposed on 9 June 1844, by a coup d‚Äô√©tat by Trinitarian patriots headed by S√°nchez and Mella. General Pedro Santana contested the coup d‚Äô√©tat, with a counter-coup, getting himself appointed as president and appointing Bobadilla as a member of the Junta. From 1844 to 1847, Bobadilla occupied important offices inside the State, such as President of Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic in 1847., until being sent to the exile on 12 June 1847, by President Santana. He returned to the country in 1849 and was chosen member of the Chamber of the Conservative Council, Prosecutor in the Supreme Court of Justice and, finally, Judge of Residence for the Court of Appeal. Bobadilla won again the preference of Santana, and was appointed Procusecutor of the Supreme Court of Justice in 1851, and Plenipotentiary minister for Negotiation and Extradition with the United States of North America. He served as Chairman of the Supreme Court of Justice, from 3 June 1851, until 17 January 1853; afterwards, from 1853 until 1859, period of the governments of Rule Mota, Desiderio Valverde, Buenaventura B√°ez and Pedro Santana, he held important offices.

It is managed by the National Skills Development Corporation of India. History Skill India campaign was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 15 July 2015 to train over 40 crore people in India in different skills by 2022.Hanzala Kathewadi Initiatives Various initiatives under this campaign are: * National Skill Development Mission * National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, 2015 * Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) * Skill Loan scheme * Rural India Skill Partnership concept UK has entered into a partnership with India under skill India programme. Virtual partnerships will be initiated at the school level to enable young people of these country to experience the school system of the other country and develop an understanding of the culture, traditions and social and family systems. A commitment to achieve mutual recognition of UK and Indian qualifications was made. Skill India Developments The recent systematic literature review conducted by Cabral and Dhar (2019) has identified the significance of skill development wherein the implementation of such schemes mitigate poverty, utilize demographic dividend, socio-economic empowerment of under privileged sectors, achieve economic growth, reduce social challenges, and economic inclusion. As far as institutional mechanism is concerned, the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and the scheme - Prime Minister Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) have resulted to achieve considerable results, but not achieved the expected outcomes. The study argues the essential requirement of skill development to achieve technology adoption and women empowerment in the country. Oracle on 12 February 2016 announced that it will build a new 2.8 million sq. ft. campus in Bengaluru will be Oracle's largest outside of its headquarters in Redwood Shores, California. Oracle Academy will launch an initiative to train more than half-a-million students each year to develop computer science skills by expanding its partnerships to 2,700 institutions in India from 1,800 at present. Japan's private sector is to set up six institutes of manufacturing to train 30,000 people over ten years in Japanese-style manufacturing skills and practices, primarily in the rural areas. Japan-India Institute of Manufacturing (JIM) and Japanese Endowed Courses (JEC) in engineering colleges designated by Japanese companies in India in cooperation between the public and private sectors would be established for this purpose. The first three institutes would be set up in Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan in the summer of 2017. In the budget of fiscal year 2017 - 18 the government of India has decided to set aside ‚Çπ 17,000 crore, the highest ever allocation to this sector, in order to boost the Skill India Mission. At least ten million Indian youth enter the country‚Äôs workforce each year, but the employment creation in India has not been able to absorb this influx, making increasing unemployment a severe problem. Through this allocation the government aims at generating employment and providing livelihood to the millions of young Indians who enter the work force every year. The government has invested ‚Çπ 4000 crore in the launch of SANKALP (Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion Programme), another big initiative under the Skill India Mission. Through this it aims at providing market relevant training to 350 million young Indians. Apart from this, the government would set up 100 India International Skills Centres that will conduct advanced courses in foreign languages to help youngsters prepare for overseas jobs. It provides opportunities to the youth of India.  Skill Development For Women  Recognition of woman‚Äôs role in the field of entrepreneurship in a male dominated arena becomes inevitable. Till now the social fabric for gender biasness towards women and discriminatory behaviour by the society has remained unchanged. According to CSO, 59.30% rural women are self-employed and male ratio is 54.50%. This clearly indicates that the government has been undertaking proactive steps to converge the entrepreneurship in India towards development of rural women. Through the 2nd phase of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, around 68.12 lakhs of women had undergone skill training. And also, around 4.08 lakh women had undergone training during 2018-2020, and Industrial training Institutes (ITI) had completed training for 38.72 lakhs women. The main hurdles that rural women typically faces to attain skill development includes socio-economic problems, political, etc. Apart from that, other challenges includes the different social norms for decision making thus leading to lack of confidence among them, financial constraints and lack of infrastructure creates a gap in training and development opportunities for rural women. so skill development for rural women is required to make them self sufficient and to improve social and economic status. Despite cultural and social constraints restricts women towards the path of entrepreneurship, collective efforts of village panchayats, NGO's, and families are necessary to ensure their employability. Hence the convergence of government and civic society is a must to ensure the improvement of quality of life of such vulnerable groups in Indian society. Performance As of 15 February 2016, the \\"Indian Leather Development Programme\\" trained 51,216 youth in a span of 100 days and it plans to train 1,44,000 young persons annually. Four new branches of \\"Footwear Design & Development Institute\\" ‚Äî at Hyderabad, Patna, Banur (Punjab) and Ankleshwar (Gujarat) ‚Äî are being set up to improve training infrastructure. The industry is undergoing acute skill shortage and most of the people trained are being absorbed by the industry. In an endeavour to prepare a generation of skilled employees and leaders in alignment with the modern day market demands, Skill India was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015. Skill India, launched to train over 40 crore citizens with different industry relevant skills by 2022, is to be implemented through a streamlined institutional.

She was often a supporting act for Frank Sinatra's shows at Caesars Palace. She continues to perform, mainly in New York City, where she is also a stage actress. Early life and education She was born Edith Erdman in Brooklyn, New York, the second of three daughters of Saul and Joan Erdman. Her father was a bottling company executive. Her family was Jewish but not religious. She attended the Roy H. Mann Jr. High School in Brooklyn until 1969, when she transferred to a private academy in Manhattan. In 1993 she contributed her reminiscences of growing up in Brooklyn to the book It Happened in Brooklyn: An oral history of growing up in the borough in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s (1993). Career=Singing Budd began her singing career at the age of 12, taking the stage for amateur night at the Tamarack resort camp in the Catskills. There she was spotted by producer Herb Bernstein, who became her personal manager and arranger. He continued to work with her through the next thirty years.

Appearing at Caesars Palace at the age of 16, Budd became the youngest opening act for Frank Sinatra. She told the Chicago Sun-Times that she learned the \\"theatrical side of singing\\" by observing Sinatra: > \\"Frank would set up a chair for me in the wings when I was done singing and > I'd watch his show every night from there. Then he'd come off and ask me for > observations. And he was totally serious about it. One night I asked him > about all the tape marks all over the floor when he sang. And he asked the > lighting guy to bring up the lights one by one and I saw how they 'hit the > marks'. Frank just walked over to me and explained how lighting will enhance > musical moments\\". She began singing in nightclubs at age 18. She became a frequent performer in Las Vegas, often supporting Sinatra, Liberace, George Burns, or Bob Hope.

This article explains the theology (or understanding) of Scripture that has come to dominate in the Catholic Church today. It focuses on the Church‚Äôs response to various areas of study into the original meaning of texts.That is, the contextual or \\"literal\\" meaning intended by the human author who wrote the text, including the author's unconscious and also divine inspiration. This is in contrast to the fundamentalist manner of reading Scripture ‚Äúliterally‚Äù. Both are clarified in this article. Watershed Council Vatican II's Dei Verbum (Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation), promulgated in 1965, opened the door to acceptance within the Church for much of the scholarly study of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures that had taken place since the 19th century. Developments within the Catholic Church can be traced through documents of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, which oversees scriptural interpretation as it pertains to Catholic teaching.Pontifical Biblical Commission documents Until Vatican II the decrees of this commission reflected the Counter-Reformation effort to preserve the tradition unchanged, lest errors arising during the Protestant Reformation enter into Catholic belief. Consequent on Vatican II, the Counter-Reformation mentality in the Catholic Church diminished and the ecumenical spirit of openness to what is good in modern studies was embraced. The Council Fathers reiterated what was dogmatic in the previous teaching of the Church, \\"that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation.\\"cf. St. Augustine, \\"Gen. ad Litt.\\" 2, 9, 20:PL 34, 270-271; Epistle 82, 3: PL 33, 277: CSEL 34, 2, p. 354. St. Thomas, \\"On Truth,\\" Q. 12, A. 2, C. Council of Trent, session IV, Scriptural Canons: Denzinger 783 (1501). Leo XIII, encyclical Providentissimus Deus: EB 121, 124, 126-127. Pius XII, encyclical Divino Afflante Spiritu: EB 539. This is the substance of what church dogma (infallible teaching) says. The Council document went on to show an openness to development of doctrine (teaching), since historically growth in understanding has led to more developed theologiesVatican II, Constitution on Revelation, article 8, ‚Äì in this case of scriptural interpretation within the Church. The Council Fathers continued: > However, since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human > fashion,St. Augustine, City of God, XVII, 6, 2: PL 41, 537: CSEL. XL, 2, 228 > the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted > to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred > writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their > words. To search out the intention of the sacred writers, attention should > be given, among other things, to \\"literary forms\\" ... in accordance with the > situation of his own time and culture.. St. Augustine, On Christian Doctrine > III, 18, 26; PL 34, 75-76. For the correct understanding of what the sacred > author wanted to assert, due attention must be paid to the customary and > characteristic styles of feeling, speaking and narrating which prevailed at > the time of the sacred writer, and to the patterns men normally employed at > that period in their everyday dealings with one another.Pius XII, loc. cit. > Denziger 2294 (3829-3830); EB 557-562. But, since Holy Scripture must be > read and interpreted in the sacred spirit in which it was written,cf. > Benedict XV, encyclical Spiritus Paraclitus Sept. 15, 1920:EB 469. St. > Jerome, \\"In Galatians\\" 5, 19-20: PL 26, 417 A. no less serious attention > must be given to the content and unity of the whole of Scripture if the > meaning of the sacred texts is to be correctly worked out. The living > tradition of the whole Church must be taken into account along with the > harmony which exists between elements of the faith. It is the task of > exegetes to work according to these rules toward a better understanding and > explanation of the meaning of Sacred Scripture, so that through preparatory > study the judgment of the Church may mature.Dei Verbum (Dogmatic > Constitution on Divine Revelation), promulgated by Pope Paul VI on November > 18, 1965; No. 12. In these words and in the ensuing decrees of the Biblical commission, the contextual interpretation of scripture was endorsed, as distinguished from the fundamentalist approach which would hold to the verbal accuracy of every verse of scripture. Catholics, however, remain free to interpret Scripture in any way that does not contradict Catholic dogma. Areas of scriptural research At least since Vatican II, Catholic theology has been understood as the search for fruitful understanding of the Church's dogma, doctrine, and practice. While dogma, the most basic beliefs, does not change, Church doctrine includes the many other beliefs that may reflect a single interpretation of dogma, of Scripture, or of the Church's tradition and practice. An example would be the dogma that \\"Jesus died for our sins.\\" The many ways in which his death on the cross impacts us ‚Äì or in which it may be called a \\"sacrifice\\" ‚Äì have filled reams in the history of theology. An up-to-date theology of the question can be found in various places, in substantial agreement.Daly, Robert J. \\"Sacrifice: the Way to Enter the Paschal Mystery\\", America, May 12, 2003 ‚Äì from his \\"Sacrifice Unveiled or Sacrifice Revisited\\", Theological Studies, March 2003; Kasper, Walter. 1982 The God of Jesus Christ. (New York: Crossroads, 1982) pp. 191,195; Fitzmyer, Joseph. \\"Pauline Theology, Expiation\\". The New Jerome Biblical Commentary. (Prentice Hall: New Jersey, 1990) p. 1399; Zupez, John. \\"Salvation in the Epistle to the Hebrews\\", The Bible Today Reader. (Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 1973). How this process works, through the \\"study of believers\\", was given at Vatican II: > The Tradition which comes from the Apostles thrives under the assistance of > the Holy Ghost in the Church: the understanding of the things and words > handed down grows, through the contemplation and study of believers, who > compare these things in their heart (cf. Lk 2, 19, 51), and through their > interior understanding of the spiritual realities which they experience. The > Church, we may say, as the ages pass, tends continually towards the fullness > of divine truth, till the words of God are consummated in her.Constitution > on Revelation, art. 8. While biblical criticism began in the 17th century among those who saw the Scriptures as of human rather than divine origin, it has divided into areas of research all of which have proved fruitful for Catholic scripture scholars. These include \\"criticisms\\" and approaches described as: textual, source, form, redaction, rhetorical, narrative, semiotic, canonical, socio-scientific, psychological, feminist, liberationist, and Jewish, along with the underlying principles of Catholic hermeneutics. Catholic scholars have also entered seriously into the quest for the historical Jesus, but with a respect for oral and written traditions that distinguishes them from some who have pursued this topic.Meier, John P., A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus, Doubleday, v. 1, The Roots of the Problem and the Person, 1991, v. 2, Mentor, Message, and Miracles, 1994, v. 3, Companions and Competitors, 2001, v. 4, Law and Love, 2009, Authoritative critique In 1993 the Catholic Church‚Äôs Pontifical Biblical Commission produced \\"The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church\\" with the endorsement of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.PBC 1993 While expressing an openness to all forms of Biblical criticism, the Commission expressed caveats for Catholics in the use of these methods, so that Scriptural interpretation might be \\"as faithful as possible to its character both human and divine.\\" More specific observations of the Commission included the following points. Study of the text across time (historical-critical or diachronic method), including source and form criticism, while \\"indispensable\\" for proper understanding of texts, is limited in that it views texts at only one point in their transmission and can divert attention from the richness that the final form of the text has for the Church. But when supplemented by redaction criticism, the earlier stages are valuable in showing the dynamism that produced texts and the complexity of the process. For one example, by giving the Sitz im Leben of the covenant code in Exodus 21-23, form criticism renders intelligible its differences from other law codes preserved in Deuteronomy. Narrative analysis is to be commended for its appeal addressed to the reader, for bringing out the story and witness character of Scripture for pastoral and practical use. It must remain open to doctrinal elaboration on its content, but by including the informative and performative aspects ‚Äì the story, of salvation ‚Äì it avoids \\"the reduction of the inspired text to a series of theological theses, often formulated in non-scriptural categories and language.\\" Semiotics, a general philosophical theory of signs and symbols, must be wary of structuralist philosophy with its \\"refusal to accept individual personal identity within the text and extratextual reference beyond it.\\" The historical context and human authors are important. Formal study of the content of texts cannot excuse us from arriving at its message. The canonical approach which emphasizes the final form of texts and their unity as the norm of faith, needs to respect the various stages of salvation history and the meaning proper to the Hebrew scripture, to grasp the New Testament's roots in history. Jewish traditions of interpretation are essential to the understanding of Christian scriptures. But differences must be respected: while the Jewish community and way of life depend on written revelation and oral tradition, Christianity is based on faith in Jesus Christ and in his resurrection. History of the influence of the text studies how people, inspired by Scripture, are able to create further works, as is seen in creative use of the Song of Songs. Care must be taken that a time-bound interpretation not become the norm for all time. Socio-scientific criticism includes sociology, which focuses mainly on the economic and institutional aspects of ancient society, and cultural anthropology which focuses on the customs and practices of a particular people. Both study the world behind the text rather than the world in the text. Our knowledge of ancient society is far from complete and it leans toward the economic and institutional rather than the personal and religious. While these disciplines are \\"indispensable for historical criticism\\", of themselves they cannot determine the content of revelation. The psychological approach clarifies the role of the unconscious as a level of human reality and the use of the symbolic as a window to the numinous. But this should be done without detriment to other realities, of sin and of salvation, and of a distinction between spontaneous religiosity and revealed religion ‚Äì the historical character of the Biblical revelation, its uniqueness. The liberationist approach draws on an important strand in Biblical revelation, God's accompanying the poor, but other central themes must be allowed to interact with this. Also, if too one-sided it can lead to materialist doctrines and an earthly eschatology. Feminist approaches are diverse but most fruitful in pointing out aspects of revelation which men have not been quick to observe, e.g., the motherly-fatherly nature of God and the ways in which early Christian communities distinguished themselves from Jewish and Greco-Roman society. Hermeneutics would bridge the gap between the lived experience of the early church and our own lived experience. Beyond the scientific interpretation of texts it seeks to ascertain the lived faith of the community and its mature life in the Spirit, to reproduce again today a connaturality with the truths of revelation. Fundamentalist interpretation disregards the human authors who were belabored to express the divine revelation. It often places its faith in one, imperfect translation. And it wills away any development between the words of Jesus and the preaching of the early church which existed before the written texts. Also, by reading certain texts uncritically, prejudiced attitudes, such as racism, are reinforced. Publications While Catholic periodical articles written since Vatican II often have direct reference to Scripture, two Catholic periodicals that are dedicated entirely to Scripture are The Bible Today, at the more popular level, and the Catholic Biblical Quarterly, published by the Catholic Biblical Association and including articles with minute Biblical research.

It is located 3.75 km (2.33 miles) north-northeast of the city centre. The main entrance to the park is on Hucklow Road although there are several entrances on Firth Park Road to the east and one on Vivian Road to the south. Established in 1875, the park gave its name to the Sheffield suburb of Firth Park, a social housing estate constructed around the area of the park in the 1920s and 1930s. History=Grand opening The ceremonial opening of Firth Park on 16 April 1875 The 36 acre park was a gift from the Sheffield industrialist Mark Firth. The land had originally been part of the grounds of Page Hall (now Abbey Grange Nursing Home) which Firth had bought in 1873. The park was opened on 16 August 1875 by Albert Edward, the then Prince of Wales, and Princess Alexander. The royal couple were the guests of Firth, staying at his mansion Oakbrook in the city. The weekly newspaper The Graphic reported that the royal visitors arrived at Firth Park in a procession of forty carriages from Victoria station with the band of the Hallamshire Volunteer Rifle Corps playing the \\"Firth Park March\\". The royal couple were seated in a temporary pavilion designed to look like a Turkish minaret and 15,000 school children were assembled in front to sing the national anthem. At the time of the royal opening much of the park was still unfinished and Firth spent an additional ¬£9,000 before a second ceremony was performed on 22 August 1876 to mark the completion.\\"Sheffield Parks And Gardens\\", Douglas Hindmarch, Tempus Publishing (2005), Gives details of opening ceremony and early history. Early days In its early days the park had a pavilion, lodge, bandstand, drinking fountain and ornamental lake with ducks. The park was very popular at this time with an estimated 1,000 people visiting daily in spring and summer and as many as 30,000 on Good Fridays. In 1908 the Firth Park Bowling Club was established. After the Second World War the lake was renovated and became a shallow paddling and boating pool, used extensively by the Sheffield Ship Model Society. The pool was eventually filled in and landscaped. The lodge has an striking clock tower which in its early days stood at the main entrance to the park at the then farthest extent of Firth Park Road. The lodge incorporated a park keeper's house and refreshment rooms. In June 1973 the building was designated a Grade II listed building, and today it provides community facilities, having been refurbished after an arson attack in 1995. In 1949 the main entrance to the park was moved onto Hucklow Road near the main shopping area of the newly established suburb of Firth Park. Formal gardens were also laid out at this time, and in the 1970s a children's playground was constructed.Sheffield City Council Gives early history. Wooded area The park incorporates two wooded areas. The most important of these is Hinde Common Wood on its eastern flank. It is an ancient woodland which was first mentioned in documents in 1637, it stands on the eastern side of Firth Park Road, separated from the rest of the park by that thoroughfare. The wood was not integrated into the park until 1909 when it became public property. In recent years Hinde Common Wood has undergone a restoration programme which has encouraged the regeneration of native trees, while non-native and invasive species have been removed. Access to the wood has also been improved by upgrading paths and providing additional seating. On the western side of the park is Brushes Wood, a small wooded area in a shallow valley close to Hucklow Road and the Brushes allotments.Heritage Woods Online Gives details of Hinde Common Wood. Present day The lodge on Firth Park Road was the original main gate for the park. In the 1980s the maintenance and upkeep of the park was scaled back and Firth Park entered a period of deterioration and neglect. In 2000 the Friends Of Firth Park group was formed to help regenerate the park. This included the opening of a new First Start Centre in 2005 which incorporated a toddler group, drop in nursery and a community snack bar known as Henry's Caf√©. Today the park also has a multi-use games area that includes facilities for football, hockey, basketball and cricket as well as a children's playground and bowling green.Sheffield City Council Gives details of the park today.

Biography  His father originally wanted to be a painter, but gave it up to support his family, becoming a framer and decorator instead. When he saw that his son had some artistic talent, he sent him, at the age of eleven, to study with Agostino Cottolengo, who he remained with until 1838.Brief biography by Andrea Rocco @ the Asti website. When he turned fourteen, his father decided that he needed more formal instruction and enrolled him in classes at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. He also copied works by the Old Masters and created some original works inspired by theirs. In 1845, he received his first commission, from the knights of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, for portraits that would be presented to Queen Maria Cristina. The Queen was impressed and, two years later, commissioned him to do decorations for the Sanctuary of Oropa (designed by Canina), as well as some private residences. He remained in Rome until 1848, when political events made it wiser to go back home. Thanks to commissions from the Vicar of Costigliole, he was able to return to Rome in 1852. He soon became an habitu√© of the Antico Caff√® Greco, where he became a lifelong friend of Rudolf Lehmann. For a time, he concentrated on works that combined traditional still-lifes with elements of genre painting, although continuing to do his usual portraits. He made occasional trips home, where he created some religious works, then returned there in 1859. In 1868, possibly at the prompting of his friend, Lehmann, he moved to London. Once there, he became part of the city's Italian community and made the acquaintance of Giuseppe Mazzini, who gave him a letter of introduction that gained him entry to the upper echelons of Victorian society. The high point of his career there was an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts. He returned to Italy in 1872 where, after 1880, his portraits began to show the influence of photography. He died peacefully at home in 1903. In his will, he left 10,000 Lire to the city of Asti, to be used for art education.

(2015). Aeolidiella alderi (Cocks, 1852). In: MolluscaBase (2015). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2015-11-12 It is native to northwestern Europe where it occurs in the intertidal zone. It is a predator and feeds on sea anemones. Description This is a small nudibranch that can reach a length of . The body shape is flattened and broad, but not as wide as Aeolidia papillosa and Aeolidia filomenae. The pair of oral tentacles on the head are longer than the rhinophores. The dorsal surface of the body has up to 16 oblique rows of cerata on either side. These are outgrowths of the body wall that increase the area available for respiration, and contain extensions of the gut, so vary in colour according to the animal's diet. The first row of cerata have reduced digestive gland extensions and are white, forming a collar. The cerata are tipped with cnidosacs containing stinging cells, derived from the sea anemones that the nudibranch has eaten and which pass unmetabolized through its body.  Distribution  The species was described from England. It was also recorded from the North Atlantic Ocean, off Ireland, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a shallow water species and occurs in the intertidal zone, under boulders and in rock pools. Ecology A carnivore, A. alderi feeds on sea anemones. It seems to have a preference for Cereus pedunculatus, Diadumene cincta and species of Sagartia such as Sagartia elegans and Sagartia troglodytes. It also feeds on Metridium dianthus, Sagartiogeton laceratus, Paractinia striata, Actinothoe sphyrodeta Aiptasia mutabilis, Anemonia viridis and Aulactinia verrucosa. The rhinophores are sensory structures and are able to analyse the chemicals dissolved in the water around the sea slug, enabling it to detect its prey. Sea anemones are avoided by many predators because of their defensive stinging cells. The sea slug approaches a sea anemone with the greatest caution, gradually inching towards it, and extending the cerata that form the collar to two or three times their normal length. When close enough (fractions of a millimetre), the cnidosacs in the collar cerata are discharged into the column of the anemone, poisoning the tissues and causing necrosis. The sea slug can then feed. Reproduction is hermaphroditic. The eggs are large and are laid in a spiral string of mucous on the substrate. Development is direct, without any larval stage, the young crawling away after hatching. The juveniles have no cerata at first, and these develop as the animal grows. Reproduction seems to take place all year round, and the young reach maturity after several months of growth. Etymology The name honours Joshua Alder.

They form an orthogonal subset of a more general family of little-known Routh polynomials introduced by Edward John Routh in 1884. The term Romanovski polynomials was put forward by Raposo, with reference to the so-called 'pseudo-Jacobi polynomials in Lesky's classification scheme. It seems more consistent to refer to them as Romanovski‚ÄìRouth polynomials, by analogy with the terms Romanovski‚ÄìBessel and Romanovski‚ÄìJacobi used by Lesky for two other sets of orthogonal polynomials. In some contrast to the standard classical orthogonal polynomials, the polynomials under consideration differ, in so far as for arbitrary parameters only a finite number of them are orthogonal, as discussed in more detail below. The differential equation for the Romanovski polynomials The Romanovski polynomials solve the following version of the hypergeometric differential equation Curiously, they have been omitted from the standard textbooks on special functions in mathematical physics and in mathematics and have only a relatively scarce presence elsewhere in the mathematical literature. The weight functions are they solve Pearson's differential equation that assures the self-adjointness of the differential operator of the hypergeometric ordinary differential equation. For and , the weight function of the Romanovski polynomials takes the shape of the Cauchy distribution, whence the associated polynomials are also denoted as Cauchy polynomials in their applications in random matrix theory. The Rodrigues formula specifies the polynomial as where is a normalization constant. This constant is related to the coefficient of the term of degree in the polynomial by the expression ,\\\\quad \\\\lambda_n=-n\\\\left({t^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}_n}' + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(n-1)s(x)\\\\right), }} which holds for . Relationship between the polynomials of Romanovski and Jacobi As shown by Askey this finite sequence of real orthogonal polynomials can be expressed in terms of Jacobi polynomials of imaginary argument and thereby is frequently referred to as complexified Jacobi polynomials. Namely, the Romanovski equation () can be formally obtained from the Jacobi equation, (x) + t^{(\\\\gamma,\\\\delta)}_1(x) {P_n^{(\\\\gamma,\\\\delta )}}'(x) + \\\\lambda_n P^{(\\\\gamma, \\\\delta)}_n(x) = 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &\\\\qquad t^{(\\\\gamma, \\\\delta)}_1(x)=\\\\delta -\\\\gamma -(\\\\gamma +\\\\delta +2)x, \\\\quad \\\\lambda_n= n(n+\\\\gamma +\\\\delta +1),\\\\quad x\\\\in \\\\left[-1,1 \\\\right], \\\\end{align} }} via the replacements, for real , {{NumBlk: x\\\\to ix, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d}{{\\\\mathrm d}x}\\\\to -i\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d}{{\\\\mathrm d}x}, \\\\quad \\\\gamma=\\\\delta^\\\\ast =\\\\beta -1 +\\\\frac{\\\\alpha i}{2}, }} in which case one finds (with suitably chosen normalization constants for the Jacobi polynomials). The complex Jacobi polynomials on the right are defined via (1.1) in Kuijlaars et al. (2003) which assures that () are real polynomials in x. Since the cited authors discuss the non-hermitian (complex) orthogonality conditions only for real Jacobi indexes the overlap between their analysis and definition () of Romanovski polynomials exists only if Œ± = 0. However examination of this peculiar case requires more scrutiny beyond the limits of this article. Notice the invertibility of () according to where, now, is a real Jacobi polynomial and :R^{\\\\left(i(\\\\alpha-\\\\beta), \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)+1)\\\\right)}_n(-ix) would be a complex Romanovski polynomial. Properties of Romanovski polynomials=Explicit construction For real and , a function can be defined by the Rodrigues formula in Equation () as {{NumBlk: R_n^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{w^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)} \\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}^n}{{\\\\rm d}x^n}\\\\left( w^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x) s(x)^n \\\\right), }} where is the same weight function as in (), and is the coefficient of the second derivative of the hypergeometric differential equation as in (). Note that we have chosen the normalization constants , which is equivalent to making a choice of the coefficient of highest degree in the polynomial, as given by equation (). It takes the form Also note that the coefficient does not depend on the parameter , but only on and, for particular values of , vanishes (i.e., for all the values :\\\\beta=\\\\frac{k(k-1) - n(n-1)}{2(n-k)} where ). This observation poses a problem addressed below. For later reference, we write explicitly the polynomials of degree 0, 1, and 2, : \\\\begin{align} R_0^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x) & = 1, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] R^{(\\\\alpha ,\\\\beta )}_1(x) & = \\\\frac{1}{w^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)} \\\\left(w'^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)s(x)+s'(x)w^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = t^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)=2\\\\beta x+\\\\alpha,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] R^{(\\\\alpha ,\\\\beta )}_2(x) & = \\\\frac{1}{w^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d}{{\\\\mathrm d}x} \\\\left(s^2(x) w'^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)+2s(x)s'(x)w^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{1}{w^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d}{{\\\\mathrm d}x}\\\\left(s(x)w^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x) \\\\left(t^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)+s'(x)\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = \\\\left(2x+t^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)\\\\right) t^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)+\\\\left(2+t'^{(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)}(x)\\\\right)s(x)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = (2\\\\beta+1)(2\\\\beta+2) x^2 + 2(2\\\\beta+1)\\\\alpha x + \\\\left(2\\\\beta + \\\\alpha^2 +2\\\\right), \\\\end{align} which derive from the Rodrigues formula () in conjunction with Pearson's ODE (). Orthogonality The two polynomials, and with , are orthogonal, if and only if, In other words, for arbitrary parameters, only a finite number of Romanovski polynomials are orthogonal. This property is referred to as finite orthogonality. However, for some special cases in which the parameters depend in a particular way on the polynomial degree infinite orthogonality can be achieved. This is the case of a version of equation () that has been independently encountered anew within the context of the exact solubility of the quantum mechanical problem of the trigonometric Rosen‚ÄìMorse potential and reported in Compean & Kirchbach (2006). There, the polynomial parameters and are no longer arbitrary but are expressed in terms of the potential parameters, and , and the degree of the polynomial according to the relations, Correspondingly, emerges as , while the weight function takes the shape :\\\\left(1+x^2\\\\right)^{-(a+n+1) }\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{2b}{n+a+1} \\\\arccot x\\\\right). Finally, the one-dimensional variable, , in Compean & Kirchbach (2006) has been taken as :x=\\\\cot\\\\left( \\\\frac{r}{d}\\\\right), where is the radial distance, while d is an appropriate length parameter. In Compean & Kirchbach it has been shown that the family of Romanovski polynomials corresponding to the infinite sequence of parameter pairs, is orthogonal. Generating function In Weber (2007) polynomials , with , and complementary to have been studied, generated in the following way: \\\\frac{{\\\\mathrm d}^ u}{{\\\\mathrm d}x^ u} w^{\\\\left(\\\\alpha_n,\\\\beta_n\\\\right)}(x)\\\\left(1+x^2\\\\right)^n. }} In taking into account the relation, Equation () becomes equivalent to \\\\frac{{\\\\mathrm d}^ u}{{\\\\mathrm d}x^ u} w^{\\\\left(\\\\alpha_n,\\\\beta_n +n- u\\\\right)}(x)\\\\left(1+x^2\\\\right)^ u\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] &=R_ u^{\\\\left(\\\\alpha_n,\\\\beta_n+n- u\\\\right)}(x), \\\\end{align} }} and thus links the complementary to the principal Romanovski polynomials. The main attraction of the complementary polynomials is that their generating function can be calculated in closed form. Such a generating function, written for the Romanovski polynomials based on Equation () with the parameters in () and therefore referring to infinite orthogonality, has been introduced as The notational differences between Weber and those used here are summarized as follows: * here versus there, there in place of here, *, and * in Equation (15) in Weber corresponding to here. The generating function under discussion obtained in Weber now reads: Recurrence relations Recurrence relations between the infinite orthogonal series of Romanovski polynomials with the parameters in the above equations () follow from the generating function, {{NumBlk: u\\\\bigl( u+1-2(\\\\beta_n+n)\\\\bigr)R_{ u-1}^{\\\\left(\\\\alpha_n, \\\\beta_{n}+n- u+1\\\\right)}(x)+\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm d}{{\\\\mathrm d}x}R_ u^{\\\\left(\\\\alpha_n,\\\\beta_{n}+n- u\\\\right)}(x)=0, }} and as Equations (10) and (23) of Weber (2007) respectively.

Both vessels were constructed in their entirety from only four Andean materials; totora reeds, natural fiber rope, cotton sails and wood. No one in recorded history has been able to reach the most isolated populated island in the world aboard an any ancient style vessel of any kind. The Viracocha expeditions proved that ancient South American mariners could have been the first to discover Easter Island. Who first reached the island and carved the numerous stone monoliths (or Moai) still remains one of antiquity's greatest mysteries and has baffled the scientific community for centuries.  The Viracocha I expedition  Viracocha I on the shores of Easter Island Inspired by world-famous explorer Thor Heyerdahl before his death, Buck's plan was to support the theory that ancient South American voyagers crossed vast ocean expanses in various types of boats including the ancient style reed raft that were quite possibly the key factor of human migration and the spread of civilization. The expedition set sail from Arica, Chile and completed the voyage to Easter Island, Polynesia in 44 days in 2000. It was the first primitive boat of any kind to reach the island in modern times.  Controversy  Kit√≠n Mu√±oz, the leader of previous pacific reed boat expeditions, criticized Viracocha in the press, claiming that the use of synthetic rope in the boat construction made the experiment invalid. According to the builders, they did use a small amount of synthetic twine, but judged that the effect on the durability of the boat was negligible.  The Viracocha II expedition  Viracocha II In March 2003, a team of eight men, again led by Phil Buck, set sail from Vina del Mar, Chile aboard a completely new reed raft, the Viracocha II, in an attempt to sail 10,000 nautical miles across the entire Pacific Ocean to Cairns, Australia, via Easter Island and other islands of Polynesia. The raft was severely damaged during the launch and the team was unable to test the raft to its full potential. Even with the starboard side damage, the raft still managed to make the long traverse to Easter Island for the second time.  Reed rafts  Bolivian reed-raft builders Reed raft building is one of the oldest maritime technologies. Throughout history, reed rafts have been constructed in almost every part of the world where reeds have grown, most notably in regions near the Mediterranean, in South America and Easter Island. Today only a handful of places still practice the ancient art of reed raft construction. The Aymara reed boat builders of Bolivia's Lake Titicaca are the foremost builders in the world today having built the hulls of Viracocha I and II. The art of reed boat building has been passed down through generations and survives on both the Peruvian and Bolivian sides of the lake. Reed boat building is now mainly a tourist attraction and wooden boats, which last much longer, have now taken over as the main vessel on the lake. Where were the first reed boats built? Were ancient mariners able to cover large distances in reed rafts? Did ancient cultures utilize the ocean currents and winds as highways rather than barriers in search of new lands? Were the ancient navigators able to find their way across endless miles of ocean? These are questions the scientific world has debated for centuries. The expeditions of explorer/anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl captured the imagination of the world with the Kon-Tiki balsa log raft voyage on the Pacific in 1947, his Ra Expedition, a reed raft journey across the Atlantic in 1970 and his Tigris reed boat voyage on the Indian Ocean in 1978.  How reed rafts are built Reed harvesting The Viracocha I and II were long, wide at the center-line and weighed approximately 20 tons. Two and half million reeds were required for each boat and were harvested from the shores of the Bolivian/ Peruvian high altitude Lake Titicaca, where the totora reeds grow in abundance. The reeds were cut with a long cutting pole from small rowboat and bundled up into \\"amaros\\" (bundles) with roughly 500 reeds per bundle. They are rowed ashore and sun dried for two to four weeks with bundles stacked together in a standing position. After the drying process, the reeds are gathered up and stored, being careful to keep them from the rain. The reeds (Scirpus Riparius) are generally one half inch thick at the base (before being compressed) and 6 feet long. The reeds are then made into over 30 long cylinders or \\"chorizos\\", in diameter which are made the length of the boat. These form the main bulk of the ship. The jig is built next. This serves as a mold, constructed with eucalyptus poles every three feet, running perpendicular to the hull supported by poles from the ground. Two smaller boats that looked similar to \\"whales\\" are made to add rigidity to the boat with the technique the same as main hull, described later. They are laid side by side on top of the mold. The roles are laid on top of the \\"whales\\" until they form two large separate bundles. Ropes of Viracocha II The \\"estera\\" or skin of the boat is the next phase and is made by weaving the best stock of the reeds, made the length of the boat. This skin is wrapped around the two large bundles. A heart, or third bundle is placed in the center of the much larger bundles. Two strands of sisal rope, each 2250 feet in length is than passed around one large bundle and around the heart in one foot revolutions for the entire length. The same is done on the other side. Never does the rope wrap around the whole ship. The rope tightening is next. A pulley system is used to haul on the boats to get them gradually tighter. There are only two long continuous ropes, 2,250 feet on either side. The pulling begins on one end and is hauled on until taut. The ropes are pulled roughly thirty more times on each side, shrinking the size of the boat each time. This ingenious design now consists of two large bundles linked together by a heart that has now disappeared into the larger two bundles forming a stable, almost double hulled vessel. Stepping the mast of Viracocha II The next phase is to build up the bow and stern. Tapering cones of reeds are wedged together until a high bow and double stern are formed. The double stern adds more stability and carrying capacity to the ship while at sea. Attaching the two large bundles that form the gunnels or \\"sawi\\" is the last step of the hull construction. Rope is wound around each gunnel and passed through each main bundle rope along the length of the ship. The rigging will be attached here and the gunnels help break the larger waves. The crew and volunteers constructed the rest of the vessel. Two bipod masts were positioned on either side of a bamboo cabin for Viracocha I and a smaller mast was utilized further aft for the Viracocha II. The masts were held in place by \\"shoes\\" roped into the bundles. Two rudder oars were lashed to a steering platform placed above and to the rear of the bamboo cabin. The ship was rigged with natural fiber sisal rope, the same rope that holds the reed bundles together. Two center boards were positioned in the slide boxes placed in the fore and aft of the ship and aided in the tacking into the wind. Several lee-boards were placed on the lee-side of the ship and were removable. Two cotton lateen sails were hand-sewed for the first journey and five sails were used for the second.  Scientific significance of the expeditions  Moais on Easter Island The problem of how Polynesia was settled has caused more controversy than any other puzzle in the history of anthropology. Did the original settlers migrate from the west and Asia or did they come from the East and South America? There is no doubt that Asia had a major part in the human migrations that peopled most of the Pacific but there were other possibilities from other directions that have been discredited by many experts and perhaps they occurred much earlier than any migration from Asia. Many anthropologists discount the possibilities of contact from South America, reasoning that the boats available to the native South Americans in the past millennia, and the navigators who sailed them, were not able to make long, open ocean voyages. Contrary evidence has been uncovered throughout South America, such as drawings depicting reed rafts provisioned with supplies and water for long voyages. The elements favor a western movement for prevailing sea currents and winds that sweep across the South Pacific directly from the Chilean/Peruvian Coast, where ancient Pre-Inca civilizations regularly plied the coasts in reed and balsa lografts. Sailing against these natural migration routes would have been difficult in any ancient style boat. The giant stone heads of Easter Island have become one of the foremost symbols of the insoluble mysteries of antiquity. The lesser known Tiwuanaco city in the high plains of Bolivia with giant stone figures and pyramids is also a mystery. Could they have been related? There are numerous similarities between Tiwuanaco and other Polynesian Islands suggesting a common ancestry. Some of these parallels between the two regions include the use of reed rafts, rock sculpture, stepped pyramids, sun worshipping, bird men cults, and the practice of elongating ears, mummification, and similar mythology in both the Inca and Polynesia regions. Tiwanaku art \\"se√±or de los patos\\" One of the most striking South American legends concerns the Creator/Sun God - Kon-Tiki Viracocha, the most universal god of most of the Andean cultures. According to Andean legend, he appeared as a white skinned, bearded man. He created man and the civilization and city of Tiwuanaco in Bolivia. Tiwuanaco was built complete with stepped pyramids, human rock figures, and stone work of precise fitting large blocks using reed rafts to transport the large blocks of stone to the site. When his work was done he walked to the coast with some of his followers and disappeared to the west across the sea, following the setting sun. At about the same time, according to Easter Island legend, the first settlers arrived from the east. Could Viracocha have been the first settler of Easter Island carrying the seeds of civilization? Perhaps there is no greater indicator to the movements of early man than the botanical evidence. There are several plant species that were found to be used in both Polynesia and South America by the first European explorers upon their discovery of those regions. They are all useful plants that a settler of new lands would likely have taken on a long voyage. The plant list includes the totora reed (Scirpus riparius) which the expedition's first reed ship has been constructed of. It grows on the shores of Lake Titicaca near Tiwuanaco and in the crater lakes of Easter Island. Other useful plants found in both regions include the tomato, sweet potato, tobacco, the bottle gourd, papaya, the wild pineapple, yam and coconut palm. Many of these plant species which has been found to have existed longer in the Americas than Polynesia, suggests a western migration from South America. Most of these plants could only have been transported by man, the seeds of which could not have survived the long ocean drift or a bird's migratory flight. The great number of American crop plants that can be shown as pre-European in Polynesia tells the story of overseas voyages. The objective of the first two voyages was to reinforce the theory that ancient mariners could have crossed oceans using trade winds and ocean currents to explore the globe, well before the time of Columbus. Our voyage was the first to link the ancient civilizations of Tiwuanaco on the shores of Lake Titicaca, Bolivia and the isolated Easter Island of the Pacific, demonstrating that there could have been contact between two of the most mysterious civilizations of antiquity. No reed ship or other recreated ancient craft has made this voyage in modern times. The Viracocha I set sail from Arica, Chile, the closest sea port to the ancient civilization of Tiwuanaco. The crew followed the natural human conveyor belt of the Humboldt Current to within 500 miles of one of the most isolated places on the planet, Easter Island. The final 500 miles were the most difficult, requiring tacking into the wind and working against circular vortex currents to reach the island. The Viracocha II began in Vi√±a del Mar, Chile in the year with the intended destination of Australia. A bad launch severely damaged the raft and Easter Island was the farthest the raft could travel. However, the expedition showed once again that ancient South American mariners could have been first to reach Easter Island.  The Viracocha III expedition  Fifteen years later, the Viracocha III reed raft was to attempt the complete crossing of the Pacific in February 2018. but the launch date has had to be postponed for technical reasons. The expedition intended follow in the wake of the Kon-Tiki Viracocha people and their impulse to follow the setting sun and desire to spread the seeds of civilization ever westward. Like the Virachocha I the Viracocha III was scheduled to sail from Arica, Chile, to Mangareva, in French Polynesia, and from there attempt to island-hop to Australia.

Depending on which nerves are damaged, flaccid dysarthria affects respiration, phonation, resonance, and articulation. It also causes weakness, hypotonia (low-muscle tone), and diminished reflexes.Manasco, H. (2014). Introduction to neurogenic communication disorders. Burlington, MA: Jones & Bartlett Learning. Perceptual effects of flaccid dysarthria can include hypernasality, imprecise consonant productions, breathiness of voice, and affected nasal emission. University of Minnesota Duluth. (2014). Dysarthria. http://www.d.umn.edu/~mmizuko/2230/msd.htm Causes Flaccid dysarthria is caused when damage occurs to the motor unit (one or more cranial or spinal nerves). Processes that can cause this include: * Congenital disorders * Demyelinating disorders * Infectious/Inflammatory * Degenerative disorders * Metabolic * Neoplastic * Traumatic * Vascular Diseases * Flaccid Paralysis Diagnosis The hallmark of flaccid dysarthria is weakness, affecting different muscles, depending on where the damage has occurred. Some common signs include the following Phonation and prosody: Damage to cranial nerve X can present as changes in voice quality. One or both vocal folds may be effectively paralyzed, or have diminished function. If a vocal fold is stuck in an adducted or closed position, the voice will be harsh and low in volume. A vocal fold stuck in an abducted or open position may cause breathiness and low volume. Listen for vocal flutter and diplophonia. Having both vocal folds stuck in an abducted position creates a breathy voice, with potential inspiratory stridor. Having both vocal folds stuck in an adducted or closed position compromises the airway significantly. In addition to these changes in phonation, someone may have issues changing their pitch or loudness. Or, they may speak in short phrases, as they release more air than normal through their larynx while speaking. Resonance: Damage to the cranial nerves innervating muscles that control the velum may result in hypernasal speech. This can sound like someone is saying things through their nose, making oral sounds like \\"b\\" or \\"d\\" sound more like \\"m\\" or \\"n\\", respectively. Or, there may be air release through the nose that is audible, as in an attempt to say \\"s\\". Articulation: Damage to the cranial nerves innervating the lips, tongue and other key muscles for making speech sounds may result in inaccurate or imprecise articulation. This may improve with rest. Other: Flaccid paralysis can cause muscles to atrophy or lose mass over time. Twitches in the affected muscle fibres (fasciculations) may be present. In the tongue, this resembles worms moving in the tissue. If the muscles of the face are affected (i.e. if there is damage to cranial nerve VII; V for the jaw in mastication), there may be drooping, sagging or drooling. When the tongue moves forward (as in a protrusion exercise), it will move to the stronger side. If the person is asked to move their jaw, it will be opposite (toward the weaker side). Other visible signs that accompany flaccid dysarthria include facial or soft palate droop, or nasal regurgitation with eating (again, if the velum is an affected area). Issues with eating are common, given the shared nature of the muscles for talking and those for chewing and swallowing. These require evaluation alongside any speech difficulties, and if present, may be medically serious (i.e. if material enters the lungs, or if not enough food is able to be eaten). Treatment Treatment may be carried out by a range of professionals (i.e. speech-language pathologists/therapists, rehabilitation specialists, or others with training in this area). Treatments may include direct work on the nerves and muscles involved (see below, organised by affected component of speech); counselling; partner training (i.e. to improve their ability to understand the affected person, or implement exercises); or, training aimed at helping the person themselves compensate for their condition (i.e. using gestures to supplement a message; using a device to talk; advocating for others to wait while they get their message across). Note that treatment should be planned and supervised by a trained professional, and tailored to the individual's specific profile. Phonation and prosody: Behavioural treatments may include turning one's head to the affected side during speech or lateralizing the thyroid cartilage; making an effortful closure of the vocal folds or an abrupt glottal attack; or, producing intense high-level phonation. Medical treatments may include surgery such as medialization laryngoplasty; arytenoid adduction; or, fat/collagen injections. Prosthetic approaches may include artificial larynges; or abdominal binders/corsets (to provide best posture for speech, and support stronger exhalation, if affected muscles include those controlling breathing). Resonance: Behavioural treatments may include use of CPAP machines, supine positioning (lying down, to help train velum closure), or reducing pressure during held consonants (i.e. 's' or 'z' sounds). Again, some medical or prosthetic approaches may be utilised, including palatal lifts, or pharyngeal flap procedures. Articulation: Behavioural treatments may include various speech sound strengthening or accuracy re-training exercises.

He failed to win in five starts as a juvenile and was gelded before the start of his second season. In 1992 he won six races including the Grade II St Lite Kinen, finished fourth in the Japan Cup and ran second in the Arima Kinen. In the following year he was lightly raced and made only two appearances before defeating a top-class international field in the Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse. His later career was blighted by injury and he failed to win in fourteen subsequent races before being retired in 1996. Background Legacy World was a bay gelding with no white markings bred in Japan by the Heihata Farm. His sire Mogami raced in France where he won the valuable Prix des Foals at Deauville Racecourse in 1978 before retiring to become a breeding stallion in Japan. He sired several major winners including Sirius Symboli (Tokyo Yushun), Mejiro Ramona (Yushun Himba) and Buzen Candle (Shuka Sho). Legacy World was one of several winners produced by the Japanese mare Donna Lydia, an unraced daughter of the American stallion Jim French. She was descended from Propontis, a British broodmare who was imported to Japan in the first decade of the 20th century. During his track career, Legacy World raced in the colours of Horse Tajima Co Ltd and was initially trained by Toyama Tameo. Racing career=1991: two-year-old season Legacy World failed to win in five races as a two-year-old in 1991. Competing exclusively in maiden races he finished fourth over 1200 metres at Hakodate Racecourse on his debut on 18 August and then ran second over the same course and distance six days later. The best of his three subsequent efforts came when he finished third to Dyna Splendor over 1600 metres at Kyoto Racecourse in October. At the end of his first season, Legacy World's lack of success and difficult temperament led to the decision to have the colt gelded. 1992: three-year-old season On his debut as a three-year-old, Legacy World recorded his first win when he defeated fifteen opponents in a maiden over 1800 metres at Fukushima Racecourse on 11 July. He finished third at Niigata Racecourse two weeks later and then won twice at Hakodate in August, taking the Okushiri Tokubetsu over 2000 metres and the Matsumae Tokubetsu over 2500 metres. On September 13 the gelding finished second to the four-year-old filly Janis at Hakodate and was then moved up in class for the Grade II St Lite Kinen over 2200 metres at Nakayama Racecourse two weeks later. He recorded his first major victory as he defeated the Tokyo Yushun runner-up Rice Shower, with Super Sovereign in third, but, as a gelding, he was ineligible to run in the Kikuka Sho which was won by Rice Shower. In October, Legacy world won the Tokyo Sports Hai over 2400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse and on 8 November he recorded his sixth victory of the year when he took the Doncaster Stakes over the same distance at Kyoto. On 29 November at Tokyo, Legacy World was moved up to the highest level and started a 16.9/1 outsider for the twelfth running of the Japan Cup over 2400 metres. Ridden by Hiroshi Kawachi he finished fourth of the fourteen runners behind Tokai Teio, Naturalism and the Arlington Million winner Dear Doctor. The unplaced horses included User Friendly, Let's Elope, Dr Devious and Quest for Fame. On his final appearance of the year, Legacy World was invited to compete in the Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama on 27 December and finished second of the sixteen runners behind the five-year-old Mejiro Palmer with Nice Nature in third. 1993: four-year-old season Hideyuki Mori, who trained Legacy World to win the Japan Cup Legacy World returned in January 1993 at Nakayama and finished second to the six-year-old White Stone in the Grade II American Jockey Club Cup over 2200 metres. After Toyama's death in May 1993, the gelding entered the stable of the first-season trainer Hideyuki Mori. After an absence of more than eight months, Legacy World returned in the Grade II Kyoto Daishoten over 2400 metres on 10 October and finished second of the ten runners to Mejiro McQueen. On 28 November, in front of a record crowd of 175,000, the gelding made his second attempt to win the Japan Cup, a race which pitted seven Japanese horses against nine overseas challengers, and started at odds of 11.5/1. The other Japanese runners were Winning Ticket (Tokyo Yushun), Rice Shower, Mejiro Palmer, Matikanetannhauser (third in the Kikuka Sho), Nice Nature and the dirt racer Hashiru Shogun (Teio Sho). The North American contingent comprised Kotashaan (the 4.2/1 favourite), Star of Cozzene and Luazar (Del Mar Handicap) whilst Europe was represented by White Muzzle (Derby Italiano) from Britain, Urban Sea from France, Misil (Premio Roma) from Italy and Platini (Gran Premio di Milano) from Germany. The other two runners were Naturalism from Australia and The Phantom Chance from New Zealand. Kawachi tracked the leaders and reached the final turn in second place behind Mejiro Palmer before taking the lead in the straight. He stayed on strongly in the closing stages to win by one and a quarter lengths with Kotashaan taking second in a three-way photo finish from Winning Ticket and Platini. Kent Desormeaux, the rider of the runner-up, was fined by the racecourse stewards after he mistook the finish line and stopped riding 100 metres from the end of the race. After the gelding's victory, Hideyuki Mori said \\"The horse was very lightly raced. Legacy World was therefore a fresh horse, specially prepared for the Japan Cup. This was his target\\". Kawachi, who was winning the race at the fifth attempt commented \\"I was secretly confident the big chance was today\\". On his last run of the year, Legacy World was again invited to run in the Arima Kinen, but finished fifth of fourteen behind Tokai Teio on 26 December. 1995 & 1996: later career Legacy World at Kyoto Racecourse in 1995 Legacy World missed the whole of 1994 after sustaining a serious tendon injury, and although he returned for two more seasons in 1995 and 1996 he never recovered his best form. As a six-year-old he finished no better than ninth in six races. In his final season he ran seven times, finishing fourth in a minor race at Hanshin and ending his career by finishing eighth to Mayano Top Gun in Takarazuka Kinen on 7 July 1996. At the end of his racing career, Legacy World was retired to a retirement facility in Hokkaido.

Indeed, in 1981, SGS S.A., formerly Gamma Geostat International Inc. was among the pioneers in computer based geostatistical methods and had created one of the first geological modeling software for first generation of supercomputers (CDC Cyber mainframe). This software is used by SGS Canada Inc., among other things, for the production of National Instrument 43-101 reports in requirement with the Canadian securities regulation. Genesis offers all the tools necessary so that mineral resources are estimated in accordance with the rules of art in conformity with generally accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices Guidelines. The first programs were developed by one of the company founders, Michel David, Professor of Geostatistics at √âcole Polytechnique of Montr√©al and Fellow of the Academy of Science of the Royal Society of Canada. He has established the first regular courses in geostatistics for future mining engineers and geologists in the Americas.  A brief outline of the methodology  Genesis allows modeling with legacy sectional method using polygons (longitudinal polygons and polygons by benches) following the previously modelized mineralized intervals in drill holes as well as the modern modelling using the creation of meshed envelopes by connecting polygons or using implicit modelling. The resource estimate can then be performed by rapid and traditional methods like the grade of a prism given by the average grade of the mineralized intervals weighted by their intersecting lengths. The grade of a figure given by the average grade of the prisms weighted by the volume of the intersections. Or by using the polygonal method using the decomposition of a polygon in several Voronoi polygons having each the grade and the projected thickness of their composite. It is also possible to use an estimation by block models using several methods for estimating from the inverse of the square of the distance to more sophisticated as kriging or conditional simulation. Powerful tools for automatically generating statistical charts, variable ellipsoids or QKNA help the estimators to produce an efficient estimation and ensure his quality.  A free drill holes and model viewer  The demo version can open drill holes (boreholes) from csv files or SGS-GeoBase to visualize 3D hole traces with associated data. Surfaces, 3D envelopes, data points (composites), lines and polygons and also block models can be also imported. Since June 2017, the logging software SGS- Geobase is free under GPL licence.

History The property was built during the Order of St. John by Count Ignatius Francesco Moscati Falsoni Navarra as a family home and country residence in 1670. The palace was bought in 1760 by Pietro Paolo Falzon d'Aurelle (English: Dorell) Falzon, and is interchangeably named for him and his daughter Marchesa Lady Elisabetta Testaferrata Dorell. The palace served as the headquarters for the British forces, under General Graham, during the French blockade (1798‚Äì1800). The interior of the building has some of the ceiling covered in frescoes which were painted by Antonio Grech (1758-1819), known as \\"Naici\\" (Antonaci). It was the last building used by the British, with the consent of the owners, before having to leave Malta in 1979 on Freedom Day. Since the 19th century the place became limitedly open to the public with special permission of the owners, starting from the Patron Lorenzo Galea. Gardens The Xlejli Tower and a chapel are located inside the walled private gardens of the property.

The principles were drafted by a small group of lawyers, judges and technologists called the Sedona Working Group 7 or Sedona Canada. Sedona Canada is an offshoot of The Sedona Conference which is an American ‚Äúnon-profit‚Ä¶research and educational institute dedicated to the advanced study of law and policy in the areas of antitrust law, complex litigation, and intellectual property rights.‚Äù Background Civil procedure in Canada is jurisdictional with each province following its own rules of civil procedure. However, each province must address the fact that due to the advancement of technology the discovery process enshrined in the rules of civil procedure can be potentially derailed due to the sheer volume of electronically stored information (ESI). When dealing with litigation matters that involve electronically stored information (ESI), the discovery process is commonly called e-discovery. The problems associated with e-discovery in Canada led to the creation of the Sedona Canada Principles. Rule 29.1.03(4) of the wikibooks:Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure specifically refers to the Sedona Canada Principles in referencing Principles re Electronic Discovery although it has been reported that this rule has been largely ignored in practice. Summary The Sedona Canada Principles largely refer to the processes found in the Electronic Discovery Reference Model. The principles urge proportionality due to the potentially enormous volumes of documents that may be discoverable when dealing with ESI. They also encourage good faith in the document preservation stage and regular meetings between parties to discuss the scope of the litigation. Parties are urged to be aware of the potential costs involved in producing relevant ESI but are advised that only reasonably accessible ESI need be produced. The principles stipulate that parties should not be required to search for or collect deleted material unless there is an agreement or court order related to those terms. The use of electronic tools and processes such as data sampling and web harvesting are acceptable practices. Parties are encouraged to agree early in the litigation process on production format required for the exchange of relevant documents as part of the discovery process (native files, pdf, tiff, metadata requirements etc). Agreements or direction should be sought, if necessary, with respect to privilege or other confidential information related to production of electronic documents and data. Parties should be aware that legal precedents can be formed as a result of e-discovery practices and sanctions can be considered for a party‚Äôs failure to meet their discovery obligations unless it can be demonstrated that the failure was not intentional. All parties must bear the ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù costs associated with e-discovery but other arrangements can be agreed upon by the parties or by court order. Caselaw In Warman v. National Post Company proportionality was at issue in a case where the plaintiff was suing the defendant for libel. A motion was brought by the defendant to have the plaintiff provide a mirror image of his hard drive in an effort to prove an internet article was indeed authored by the plaintiff. Issues of proportionality and the work of the Sedona Conference and Sedona Canada Principles were factored in to the decision to grant the defendant only limited access to the hard drive. In Innovative Health Group Inc. v. Calgary Health Region the plaintiff‚Äôs legal obligation to produce imaged hard drives is in question. Justice Conrad refers to the advice of Sedona Canada on proportionality and problems associated with time and expense related to the difficulties associated with electronically stored information. In York University v. Michael Markicevic Justice Brown specifically refers to the need for the parties to agree upon a formal e-discovery plan to be drafted in consultation with Sedona Canada Principles. In Friends of Lansdowne v. Ottawa Master MacLeod refers to the need for Sedona Canada principles and states ‚ÄúThis is particularly true in the current information age when e-mail is ubiquitous and multiple copies or variants of messages may be held on various kinds of data storage devices including individual hard drives, e-mail and Blackberry servers. Even documents that ultimately exist in paper form normally begin their life on computers and negotiations frequently involve exchanges of electronic drafts. To find every scrap of paper and every electronic trace of relevant information has become a nightmarish task that threatens to render any kind of litigation extravagantly expensive.‚Äù Criticism Critics of the Sedona Canada Principles believe they should address system integrity and that the true history of any file preserved cannot be identified without proof of the integrity of the electronic record systems management it comes from. Other criticism is more directed to the Sedona Canada working group and complaints that it is insular and irrelevant External links * Sedona Canada Principles * Sedona Canada is alive and well * Taming the beast of eDiscovery with Sedona Canada Principles * 2014 eDiscovery Year in Review includes Sedona Canada Principles * Courts discuss Sedona Canada Principles * Sedona Canada Principles and predictive coding * Document review using Sedona Canada Principles References  Data management ","title":"Sedona Canada Principles"},{"id":"48536390","text":"Molecular Partners AG is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Zurich, Switzerland. The company is developing a new class of potent, specific and versatile small-protein therapies called DARPins, with potential clinical applications in a range of disease areas including oncology, immuno-oncology, ophthalmology, and immunology. Molecular Partners currently has two DARPin molecules in clinical development, and a broad pipeline of molecules in preclinical development.Molecular Partners AG Annual Report 2015 (PDF). March 2016.  History  Researchers at the University of Zurich, Switzerland formed Molecular Partners AG in 2004 while studying monoclonal antibodies. These scientists discovered and developed the DARPin technology and launched the company using this platform. Molecular Partners became a publicly traded company in November 2014, when it was listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. As of 2018, Molecular Partners has two cancer assets currently going through clinical testing.  DARPins  DARPins are genetically engineered antibody mimetic proteins typically exhibiting highly specific and high-affinity target protein binding. They are derived from natural ankyrin repeat proteins. Repeat proteins are among the most common classes of binding proteins in nature, responsible for diverse functions such as cell signaling and receptor binding. DARPins constitute a new class of potent, specific and versatile small-protein therapies, and are used as investigational tools in various therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The simplest format of a DARPin is the mono-DARPin, consisting of one DARPin domain with specificity for one target. The molecular mass of a mono-DARPin is about 15 to 20 kDa (kilodaltons), depending on the exact design. Several mono-DARPins can be linked (genetically or chemically) to multi-DARPins, which then combine multiple activities in one therapy. This approach enables the design of medicines that can inhibit multiple disease- specific targets and may improve outcomes for patients living with cancer, ophthalmic diseases and other disorders. Currently, Molecular Partners has two DARPin molecules in clinical development and a broad pipeline of molecules in preclinical development.  Areas of Focus  Molecular Partners is currently focusing its DARPin platform on the fields of oncology, immuno- oncology, ophthalmology, and immunology. Oncology Molecular Partners‚Äô lead candidate in oncology is MP0250, a proprietary multi-DARPin designed to inhibit VEGF and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In a poster presentation at the [ AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics] in Boston, Mass. on Saturday, November 7, 2015, a team of independent researchers presented the first demonstration in patients of the potential role of DARPin-based therapy in oncology. Data from the Phase I study demonstrated good tolerability, favorable pharmacokinetics, and sustained exposure over multiple applications of MP0250 in a preliminary analysis in patients with solid tumors. In January 2016, the Company announced plans for a Phase II trial of MP0250, a multi-DARPin¬Æ drug candidate targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), in combination with bortezomib (Velcade¬Æ) and dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who have developed resistance to at least two prior regimens (including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory drug). The Phase II trial is expected to be initiated in the second half of 2016. In preclinical studies, MP0274, a proprietary multi-DARPin with broad anti-HER2 activity, has shown promising data in model of HER 2-positive breast cancer, including those with lower levels of HER2 expression.\\" Molecular Partners agreed to pair MP0250 with Tagrisso in a phase I lung cancer trial, working with AstraZeneca on the EGFR-inhibiting candidates. Immuno-Oncology In March 2016, the Company announced its strategic plan to expand its immuno-oncology pipeline by naming the first two development programs. The first is for a multi-DARPin¬Æ that inhibits the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, a validated immune checkpoint target) and VEGF-A, while also binding to human serum albumin. This tri-functional DARPin¬Æ is designed to normalize the tumor vasculature by inhibiting VEGF and increasing tumor-penetration and intra-tumor expansion of effector T-cells. Additionally, the DARPin¬Æ binding domain to serum albumin is expected to yield a long half-life and to allow for potentially increased tumor penetration. The second immuno-oncology program is for the development of a highly specific activator of T-cells in the tumor stroma. It binds to co- stimulatory agonists on the surface of T-cells without activating them when bound in circulation ‚Äì only once the T-cells enter the tumor microenvironment, the agonist is clustered via the DARPin¬Æ having a second specificity for a densely expressed target in the stroma. This selective activation of T-cells is typically not seen for antibodies as they tend to directly cluster agonists through their Fc part and clustering on widespread Fc-receptors. Ophthalmology Molecular Partners‚Äô most advanced clinical candidate is abicipar (AGN-150‚Äô998, MP0112), an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) DARPin in late- stage development, in partnership with Allergan, an Abbvie Company. In Phase 2b studies, abicipar was shown to provide equal or potentially higher vision gains with fewer injections in patients with wet AMD (wet age-related macular degeneration), compared to standard anti-VEGF treatment with ranibizumab (Lucentis). Currently, abicipar is being investigated in four different clinical trials. The first two are Phase 3 safety and efficacy studies in patients with wet AMD; the aim of these studies is to test the safety and efficacy of abicipar in patients with wet AMD. Molecular Partners anticipates clinical read-outs from these studies in the summer of 2018. The third clinical trial is a Phase 2 safety and efficacy study in patients with wet AMD, designed to establish comparability between Japanese and non-Japanese patients.Clinical trial number NCT02181504 for \\"A Study of Abicipar Pegol in Japanese Patients With Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration\\" at ClinicalTrials.gov. The fourth study is a Phase 2 safety and efficacy of abicipar in patients with diabetic macular edema.Clinical trial number NCT02186119 for \\"A Study of Abicipar Pegol in Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema\\" at ClinicalTrials.gov. Immunology Molecular Partners is developing DARPins against several targets important for the treatment of inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. Its lead compound targets both IL-13 and IL-17 with long systemic half-life and potential use in pulmonary indications.  Partnerships/Business Development  Molecular Partners has negotiated three agreements with Allergan to develop therapies for ophthalmology (including abicipar), one in 2011Allergan Licenses Molecular Partners‚Äô Phase II Eye Disease Protein Therapeutic for $45M\\". Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News. May 4, 2011. and two in 2012.\\"Molecular Partners Gets $62.5M as Allergan Repeats on Darpins\\". Bioworld. August 21, 2012. In 2011, the Company licensed its lead asset MP0112, now called abicipar, to Allergan. In 2012, Molecular Partners and Allergan expanded their relationship by signing two separate new agreements to discover, develop, and commercialize proprietary therapeutic DARPin products for the treatment of serious ophthalmic diseases.

She was a teacher, writer, ornithologist and philanthropist. She was the funder and founder of the Armitt Library, Ambleside. Life Armitt was born in Salford, Lancashire in 1851. She was one of three gifted daughters who were born to William and Mary Ann Armitt (n√©e Whalley). All three girls wrote, and they all attended Islington House Academy, but each specialised in a different subject.Eileen Jay, \\"Armitt, Mary Louisa (1851‚Äì1911)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 Nov 2015 This academy was in Salford and it trained people to teach along Pestalozzian principles.British Pestalozzism in the 19th century: Pestalozzi and his Influence on British Education , J.A.Bown, page 164, 1986, PhD thesis, Bangor University, Retrieved 29 November 2015 Sophia, who was born in 1847, took botany and art while her younger sister Annie Maria, who was born in 1850, studied English literature. Mary‚Äîwho was known as Louie‚Äîwas the youngest and excelled at music and natural history. She was educated at the Mechanics' Institute in Manchester as soon as she was of age. The three sisters were all teenagers when their father died. They were well educated so they established a school at Eccles in Lancashire. The eldest child at the school was fourteen, which was only a year younger than Armitt. The three girls spent their spare time attending recitals, art exhibitions, and lectures. They wrote, sketched, and discussed natural history at meetings. Armitt and Sophie both discussed their ambitions with John Ruskin, who encouraged Sophie to study art but told Armitt not to write but to devote herself to women's activities. Luckily Armitt eventually ignored Ruskin's advice and began regular contributions to the Manchester City News in 1877. She was assisted in her studies by a scholarship from Trinity College, Cambridge and by becoming a reader at the Bodleian Library in Oxford.Armitt Sisters, Armitt Museum and Art Gallery, Retrieved 12 November 2015 One of Armitt's notable areas of study was music. She wrote a number of articles on the history of music and also was a music critic for the Manchester City News.British musical biography : a dictionary of musical artists, authors and composers, born in Britain and its colonies, James Duff Brown and Stephen Samuel Stratton, Birmingham: S. S. Stratton, 1897, p. 13 In 1886 Armitt and Sophie retired to Hawkshead, near where Annie was already living, and continued their cultural interests, talking to artists, writers and educationalists like Charlotte Mason and Frances Arnold. Mason, who ran a school for governesses, was publishing the Parents Review,\\"Parents' Review\\", AmblesideOnline Parents' Review Article Archive, Retrieved 11 November 2015 and Mary contributed articles for it. By 1894 Annie was a widow and had moved in with her sisters and Armitt was so ill with heart trouble that she was prevented from travelling far. She mitigated this by joining the London Library. In 1897 she published Studies of Lakeland Birds, a book that gathered together articles from the Westmorland Gazette. Death and legacy Armitt died in Rydal in 1911 and was buried in Ambleside. By then, her library included two earlier collections dating from 1828 and 1882. The latter was John Ruskin's Ambleside library, and the former was an early collection from the Ambleside Book Club,Armitt Library , independentlibraries.co.uk, retrieved 11 November 2015 to which William Wordsworth had been a subscriber. The Armitt Library was officially opened in 1912. On 8 November 1912 a friend of the Armitts', Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, who was to co-found the National Trust, read his poem in celebration. The poem starts: ::As in some inland solitude a shell :::Still gently whispers of its home, the deep, ::So from the world of being beyond all sleep :::Where those two happy sister spirits dwell...

It is part of the first fortified belt of forts of Metz and had its baptism of fire in late 1944, when Battle of Metz occurred. Historical context The first fortified belt of Metz consists of forts de Saint-Privat (1870), of Queuleu (1867), des Bordes (1870), Saint-Julien (1867), Gambetta, D√©roul√®de, Decaen, Plappeville (1867) and St. Quentin (1867), most of them unfinished in 1870, when the Franco-Prussian War bursts out. During the Annexation following this war, Metz, which oscillates between a German garrison of 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of the period, overtakes 25,000 men in the garrison by the time of the First World War. Gradually Metz becomes the first stronghold of the German Reich. It is therefore necessary to finish the fortifications there.  Construction and facilities  The feste Hindersin is designed in the spirit of the \\"detached forts\\" concept developed by Hans Alexis von Biehler in Germany. The goal was to form a discontinuous enclosure around Metz with strong artillery batteries spaced with a range of guns. Designed to complement the defensive line north of Metz, the Feste Hindersin was built between 1879 and 1881.  Successive assignments  From 1890 relief of the garrison is provided by the fort troops Corps XVI stationed at Metz and Thionville. Invested by the French army in 1919, the fort Hindersin was renamed \\"fort Gambetta\\". It was taken again in 1940 by the Germans. The German army occupied the fort during 1940‚Äì1944. The fort Gambetta is now disused.  Second world War  On 2 September 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of Metz, the old city fortress is declared a fortress of the Reich by Hitler. The fortress must be defended to the last by German troops, whose leaders were all sworn to the F√ºhrer. The German command integrates Fort Gambetta into the defensive system set up around Metz. The next day, 3 September 1944, the troops of General Krause take their positions on a line from Pagny-sur-Moselle to Mondelange, passing to the west of Metz by Chambley, Mars-la-Tour, Jarny and Briey. After an initial withdrawal, made on 6 September 1944, the German lines, stationed by troops of the 462e Volksgrenadier division, now rest firmly on the forts of Metz. The US offensive, launched 7 September 1944, on the west line forts of Metz, is cut short. American troops will eventually stop on the Moselle, despite taking two bridgeheads south of Metz. As the forts are better defended than the Americans had thought, the US troops are now out of breath. General McLain, in agreement with the General Walker, decides to suspend the attacks, pending new plans of the General Staff of 90th Infantry Division. When hostilities resumed after a rainy month, the soldiers of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division still hold firmly the forts of Metz, though supplies are more difficult under artillery fire and frequent bombings. As a prelude to the assault on Metz, on 9 November 1944, the US Air Force sends no less than 1,299 heavy bombers, both B-17s and B-24s, to dump 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 \\"livres\\" on the fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd army. Most bombers drop bombs without visibility at over 20,000 feet, so the military targets are often missed. In Metz, 689 loads of bombs hit the seven forts of Metz, identified as priority targets, merely causing collateral damage, proving once again the inadequacy of the massive bombing of military targets. After several weeks of fighting in the Messina region, US troops launched the final assault on Metz in November 1944. On 15 November 1944, 377th Infantry Regiment of 95th American division, leaving from Maizi√®res-l√®s-Metz, enters Woippy. Facing them, are the men of the 1515 Grenadier-Regiment \\" St√∂ssel \\" of the 462e Volksgrenadier division, reinforced by a reserve company SS- Panzergrenadier Regiment 38, which give desperate resistance. Such harassing fighting continued all day on 16 November. The fort Gambetta is attacked in turn in the day by 3 Battalion 377 Infantry regiment. On the night of 16 November 1944, under the pressure of 377 and 378 American regiments, the German grenadiers eventually fall back in disorder on Metz, leaving behind, artillery, trucks, weapons stocks and their dying. The bloody fighting continued the next day around the fort, which isolated and neutralized, finally surrenders. The fort Jeanne-d‚ÄôArc was the last of the forts of Metz to surrender. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, have helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saar. The objective of the German staff, which was to save time by stalling US troops for the longest possible time before those troops could reach the Siegfried Line, is largely achieved.

It was designed by George Allen Mansfield and built in 1891. It is also known as the National Australia Bank. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, Bundaberg, circa 1910 This large, two-storeyed brick premises and detached stables building, designed by Sydney architect George Allen Mansfield, were purpose-built for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd in 1891 as their Bundaberg branch office and manager's residence. They were constructed at the tail end of a period of strong economic prosperity throughout regional Queensland, and at a period when Bundaberg in particular was booming as a sugar town. Although pastoralists had occupied the Bundaberg district from the early 1840s, the town of Bundaberg was not established until the late 1860s. Early forays by Darling Downs squatter Henry Stuart Russell (1842), and by government surveyor James Charles Burnett, who in 1847 surveyed the Burnett River (later named after him), initiated the first wave of non- indigenous settlement in the lower Burnett. Sustained frontier conflict characterised the period from the 1840s to the 1860s, as pastoralists establishing sheep runs (and cattle from the 1860s) clashed with indigenous people intent on resisting the white settlement. In 1847 Burnett reported unfavourably on the navigability of the Burnett River, and during the early pastoral period Maryborough functioned as the principal port for the Burnett district. However, with timber getters moving into the Burnett from 1866, coastal shipping was soon attracted to the Burnett River. In addition, 1860s government encouragement to closer settlement, through new land and immigration acts and the Sugar and Coffee Regulations of 1864, enticed selectors to take up agricultural land along the Burnett River flats, which were found suitable for the cultivation of sugarcane, maize and coffee, in the second half of the 1860s. In 1869, the town of Bundaberg on the Burnett River was surveyed, to serve the newly emerging agricultural district dependent on the coastal shipping trade. Prior to 1872 there were no banking facilities in Bundaberg. A Customs House was established on the Burnett River but duties had to be paid in Maryborough. In April 1872 a representative from the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd (CBC) arrived in Bundaberg to assess whether the town could support a bank, and left town promising that a branch would be established within the next few months. However, the day after his departure, a representative of the Bank of New South Wales (BNSW) rode into Bundaberg from Maryborough with the news that a branch of the BNSW was to open for the transaction of business. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney opened as promised in June 1872, but the BNSW had already secured most of the banking business in the town, and the CBC was forced to close its Bundaberg branch in October 1873. In the boom years of the 1880s Bundaberg developed as an important sugar town, with growth sustained into the 1920s following the establishment of private sugar mills and a refinery. By 1883 a branch of the CBC had been re-established in Bundaberg, possibly in rented premises in Barolin Street. Although the CBC had purchased from the Crown two allotments at the corner of Bourbong and Maryborough Streets in June 1882 (the land was only proclaimed as available for purchase on 21 April 1882), the Bank did not build on this site until the end of the decade. By the 1880s, Bourbong Street had been consolidated as the principal commercial street in Bundaberg, and a number of bank buildings were erected here during the sugar boom. These included fine new premises for the Queensland National Bank, completed in 1887. The CBC commissioned Sydney architect George Allen Mansfield to design their Bundaberg premises. Mansfield designed at least five bank buildings for Queensland - premises for the Bank of New South Wales at Ipswich (1861‚Äì62), Brisbane (1864-65), and Bowen (1865‚Äì66), and premises for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney at Rockhampton (1885‚Äì86) and Bundaberg (1891). The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd's building at the corner of Bourbong and Maryborough Streets, Bundaberg, functioned as banking premises for over a century. In 1973, the CBC sold part of the block to the west, fronting Bourbong Street, but retained the remainder of the site. In 1981-83 the CBC merged with the National Bank of Australasia to form the National Australia Bank Ltd. The former CBC bank at Bundaberg remained a branch of the NAB until closed in 1996 and sold to private interests later that year.  Description  The former Commercial Bank of Sydney is situated on the corner of Bourbong and Maryborough Streets, Bundaberg. It is a substantial, two-storeyed, rendered brick building in boom-era \\"Italianate\\" style, built to the street alignments of the block, and has a square plan form and wide surrounding verandahs to both levels. The verandahs on the rear (north) side have been enclosed. The building has a hipped slate roof with a centre well. Chimneys extend from the roof on the south and north west sides. Dominant cylindrical metal vents project from the roof with two on the front (south) elevation and one on each of the other elevations. Four shaped turrets with cast iron lace rails have been removed from the intersections of the ridges. Cast iron lace ridge capping has also been removed. The first floor verandahs are supported by paired cast iron columns with corinthian capitals; these are in turn supported by masonry plinths. Between these are cast iron balustrades with timber hand rails. These columns support a dentiled soffit. Similarly paired cast iron columns support the first floor balcony and the ground level balustrade has moulded concrete balustrading with hourglass-shaped balusters. The corners of the ground floor verandah are visually strengthened by construction in masonry with recessed arcading. The ground floor verandah is paved in polychromatic geometric tiles. A double-storeyed wing with an attached single-storeyed section with hipped slate roofs extends from the rear of the building. Attached to this is a single-storeyed lean-to. The main entrance off Bourbong Street is accentuated by a masonry pediment sitting on plastered brick piers that rise above the gutter line of the roof. At ground level the entrance is in the form of a portico beneath the verandah which has recessed semi-circular openings and a wrought iron entrance gate. Paired double-hung sashes with semi-circular heads and hood moulds with supporting decorated stops are located each side of the main entrance door. A secondary entrance is located on the east side with single double-hung windows and French doors. There are single double-hung windows on the west side. At first floor level shuttered French doors open onto the verandahs from each room. Entry into the banking chamber is via a set of heavy timber doors with semi- circular hopper window that features a pair of peacocks in etched glass. To the left of the entry is the banking chamber and to the right two offices and the east side entrance hallway. Three rooms extend north from the north west corner behind these offices. A secondary stair rises to the first floor in this area. None of the original banking chamber fittings exist although the space has remained intact and the original coffered lath and plaster ceilings exist although they are damaged. Cast iron columns at the rear of the banking chamber support an upper storey wall, and beyond this is a room running off the banking chamber to the north. Original timber architraves and skirting survive in the principal offices. Access to the first floor is via a timber return stair with turned balusters. The stairwell windows and entry door have leadlight glazing with a central diamond pattern with bird designs. A green marble fireplace with cast iron grate and ceramic tiled reveal is in the office adjacent to the side hallway and main stair. The upper floor, which was formally the manager's residence, retains its original configuration of six rooms surrounding a central hall running off the main stair landing. Each room opens out onto the surrounding verandahs via French doors with timber shutters on the outside. Three original marble fireplaces exist at the first floor level. The northern verandah, which has been enclosed, is supported on cast iron columns and connects to toilets and a secondary stair. To the north of the main building is a detached, single-storeyed, gabled roof brick stables building. Its Maryborough Street elevation retains an early hoist and doors to the hayloft in the roof space, and the whole appears to be substantially intact. The bitumenised courtyard between the main building and the stables building is enclosed along Maryborough Street by a timber paling fence with capping rail. There are double gates in this fence which allow vehicle access to the site. To the east of the main building, fronting Bourbong Street, there is a low masonry fence with a small pedestrian gateway enclosing parking space accessed from the side street. The rear of the site, fronting Post Office Lane, is enclosed with a modern wire fence.  Heritage listing  The former Commercial Bank of Sydney building in Bundaberg was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Commercial Bank of Sydney at Bundaberg, completed in 1891, is important in demonstrating the development of early competitive banking facilities in rural Queensland; in illustrating an economic boom period in Queensland's history; and in illustrating the evolution of Bundaberg as a regional centre. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The main building, together with an early and rare surviving detached brick stables building, is important in illustrating a way of life no longer practiced. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is architecturally significant as a surviving, substantially intact example of 1880s boom-era architecture. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type: a substantial two-storeyed brick building which combined banking chamber and offices and bank manager's residence; which is designed to accommodate the warm Queensland climate, as illustrated by the wide surrounding verandahs to both levels and numerous windows and French doors; and which is designed to impress. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has aesthetic value, derived from its strong streetscape presence, form, materials, and the craftsmanship of the joinery, stained glass and overall construction. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is important for its association with the expansion of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd in the late 19th century and the role the Bank played in the development of regional Queensland at this period. It is also illustrative of the Queensland commercial work of Sydney architect George Allen Mansfield, who designed at least five bank buildings erected in Queensland in the period 1861-1891.

She was the founder of the study of biology in the Dominican Republic, as well as the founder of the Institute of Marine Biology and the Dominican Foundation for Marine Research. She was instrumental in the creation of the first Humpback Whale Sanctuary of the North Atlantic and has won numerous awards, including induction into the UNEP's Global 500 Roll of Honour, Unesco's Marie Curie Medal and the Order of Merit of Duarte, S√°nchez and Mella. The BBC has called her one of the most important women scientists in Latin America. Biography Bonnelly was born on 10 September 1931 in Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic. Because she wanted to study marine biology and there were no schools teaching biology in the Dominican Republic, she pursued her university studies in New York. In 1953, she enrolled at Columbia University, graduating with a BS in marine biology in 1956. She went on to attain a master's degree from New York University in 1961. After completion of her schooling, Bonnelly began her first job at the New York Aquarium as a research assistant to Ross Nigrelli. In 1962, she returned to the Dominican Republic and began teaching at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo (UASD), founding the first institution for the study of biology in the country. In 1966, she founded the Institute of Marine Biology, which later became the Research Center of Marine Biology () (CIBIMA), at which she taught from 1967 to 1986 and then until 1992 served as the coordinator of graduate studies. In 1974, Bonnelly founded the Academy of Sciences of the Dominican Republic and began publishing works which became widely influential for those managing and concerned with conservation of marine resources. In 1986, she was instrumental in the creation of the first protected area for the humpback whale, originally called the Humpback Whale Sanctuary on the Silver Bank ( but today known as . For her contribution, she was awarded the Medal of Merit of Dominican Women in Science by the Government of the Dominican Republic (1986), the National Science Prize from the Academy of Sciences of the Dominican Republic (1987), and was inducted into the Global 500 Roll of Honour by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1987. She became a Professor Meritorious at (UASD) in 1990 and in 1991 she created the Dominican Foundation for Marine Research, () (FUNDEMAR), an institution which coordinates the marine management plan, studies marine life and the coral reef, and manages the Marine Mammal Sanctuary. That same year, Bonnelly joined the Organization for Women in Science for the Developing World (TWOWS) and served in the First General Assembly. She continued publishing and her works have been utilized for influencing marine and coastal Environmental Law. Bonnelly was made an academic laureate of the Academy of Sciences in 2007, received a National Ecology Award from the Fundaci√≥n Corripio in 2008, and was awarded the Marie Curie Medal from UNESCO in 2009. In 2010, the Society for the Conservation of Biology of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, honored her with a Distinguished Service Award in Biology and in 2011, the Government of the Dominican Republic granted her the Order of Merit of Duarte, S√°nchez and Mella.

The church was built from 1891-92 after its predecessor had burned down on 19 December 1890. The cornerstone for the current St. Thomas Church building was laid on 12 August 1891 at an event that had an estimated 1,000 attendees. Although the construction period spanned from 1 May 1891 until December 1892, the first Mass was nevertheless held in the basement of the church on Christmas Day in 1891. The first child was baptized there on New Year's Day in 1892. The first Mass was held within the church proper on Christmas Day 1892. The first marriage was held in the church on 9 January 1893. The Old Wooden Church The previous wooden church had been constructed with hired and voluntary labor during 1854-55 to serve a majority populace of 63 Irish immigrant farming and logging families. In July 1854, the Catholics of Underhill Center had raised $1,250 to build it, and Bishop Louis de Goesbriand (1816-1899) purchased a small lot and house (which was later moved) in Underhill Center for $300 from a Martin Flannery for this purpose. On 4 June 1855 the church had been raised up. Further work continued over the course of the next year. In 1856, more land was added to the church property (which today is the location of the crossroad in front of the church). The building was considered by the Bishop to be a \\"good frame building\\", measuring x with between its floors, and also had a gallery. On 14 December 1856, St. Thomas Church was blessed by the bishop. Sometime between 1881‚Äì83, the pastor Father Magloire Pigeon (invoking the tradition of pew renting) spent about $2,000 to expand the church by in length x in width. The improvements provided the church with a x chancel, a x vestry, and a x front vestibule. By October 1890, the pastor Father James D. Shannon (1861-1936) had thoroughly renovated the church and made a number improvements, including; the excavation of a cellar underneath, the addition of a west wing, as well as heating apparatus, sanitary plumbing, and sewage facilities. An unexplained fire burned the church to the ground in December of that year. However, the pastor had also insured the church building for $2,500. Construction of the New Church Under the leadership of Father Shannon, services were temporarily moved to the then unused Green Mountain Academy, and plans for a new church were implemented with a \\"generous response\\" from parishioners. Records claim a comment from the pastor stating; \\"as usual, the poorer portion of the congregation were the more generous.\\" The location for the new building on the church's property required the removal of thousands of yards of earth from a bank toward the rear of the site, using a pick and shovel technique, and carting away soil by wagon; a task that was not fully completed until 1898. The celebratory laying of the cornerstone took place on 12 August 1891. Coordinated train and (horse-drawn) carriage transportation for the event was arranged for attendees from Barre, Montpelier, and Burlington. A Solemn High Mass was celebrated with Bishop de Goesbriand in attendance with Father W.J. O'Sullivan of Montpelier serving as celebrant. The bishop laid the cornerstone at the event's conclusion. The church was built with a spire reaching \\"from top of water-table\\", and had a capacity to seat some 400 worshipers. The building was originally equipped with a fully finished basement with a dining hall, kitchen, a stage, office, cloak room, and smoking rooms. On 25 August 1895, a bell was installed in the church's bell tower with the inscription \\"A Gift from St. Thomas Congregation - August 1895 - Christened St. James - McShane Foundry - Baltimore, Md. - 1895\\". In 1942, the pastor (Father Joseph Dussault) refurbished the Sacristy altar and had a steel-reinforced cement foundation constructed underneath that area of the building. In 1943, cement steps were installed at the main entrance of the church. Architecture The current church was designed by George H. Guernsey (1839-1900), a self-taught architect who had served for a term as mayor of Montpelier, Vermont in 1897, and had designed a number of prominent buildings in Vermont and New Hampshire, including a number of catholic churches, such as; St. Augustine Church (Montpelier, VT), Immaculate Heart of Mary Church (Rutland, VT), Notre Dame de Victories Catholic Church (St. Johnsbury, VT), and the Sacred Heart Saint Francis de Sales Roman Catholic Church (Bennington, VT); as well as churches for other denominations, including; the Methodist Episcopal Church (Barton, VT) and the United Baptist Church of Lakeport (Laconia, NH). Of his architectural style, it has been stated that Guernsey employed dramatic corner towers and asymmetrical massings in his designs, often combining \\"square- spired\\" and \\"conically topped round towers\\". A historical report by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation considers the architectural style of the church to be Victorian Gothic and emphasizes its variety of gothic arches and wall buttresses that were constructed in \\"a highly eclectic style\\".

The festival was originated by a small group of talented musical, visual and theatrical artists who settled in McCall in the mid-1970s. Drawn to the area because of its sheer natural beauty and, at that time, cheap rent. With the efforts of this unique blend of Raggle-Taggle-Hippies who loved music and family-type gatherings, the free-form nature of this event lent it a special charm that persists to this day. Calling themselves ‚ÄúThe Music Circus‚Äù. Original members flaunted colorful names such as ‚ÄúMr. Crow‚Äù, ‚ÄúJazmo‚Äù, ‚ÄúPretty Peggy‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeeboo‚Äù, ‚ÄúTeePee Nancy‚Äù, ‚ÄúSweet Sue‚Äù and ‚ÄúBig Bear‚Äù to name a few. This unique congregation was the nucleus of a cultural movement at that time. A movement that was maybe in contrast to, but generally accepted by the numerous loggers and long time ranchers already established in Long Valley. It all started with a chance meeting between Dan Halkyard (then manager of the Alpine Playhouse) and Pat Harren (a local musician). After some chit-chat, they started into a conversation about maybe putting together a summer music event in McCall. With that small notion, they started looking for others to help make their notion a reality. Employing the work of local artist Kathy Golden to draw up an inspiring first festival poster, then booking the highly regarded ‚ÄúMores Creek String Band‚Äù from Boise to be the main act. And just like that, the first Summer Music Festival was under way! Originally called The McCall Folk Festival, because Folk Music was the interest of most of the founders, the name has been changed many times throughout the long history of the festival such as: ‚ÄúMcCall Folk Music Festival‚Äù, ‚ÄúMcCall Summer Folk Festival‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe McCall Music Festival‚Äù along with several other variations. The now named ‚ÄúSummer Music Festival at Roseberry‚Äù expanded to include all music genres. After quickly outgrowing The Alpine Playhouse, the festival moved first to the McCall-Donnelly High School music room, then to the University of Idaho field campus for many years (known today as M.O.S.S), and finally to its current location in beautiful Historic Roseberry Townsite. With plenty of open space, Roseberry has become an integral part of the event. While most present day festival venues are tightly controlled, the Summer Music Festival's family-friendly atmosphere encourages personal freedom and responsibility. The festival is a gathering of returning old-timers, locals, and newcomers who harmonize with each other and the music coming from the stage.

Suppose that one metric space is embedded into another metric space by a metric map, a continuous one-to-one function that preserves or reduces the distance between every pair of points. Then the embedding gives rise to two different notions of distance between pairs of points in . Any pair of points in has both an intrinsic distance, the distance from to in , and a smaller extrinsic distance, the distance from to in . The stretch factor of the pair is the ratio between these two distances, . The stretch factor of the whole mapping is the supremum (if it exists) of the stretch factors of all pairs of points. The stretch factor has also been called the distortion or dilation of the mapping. The stretch factor is important in the theory of geometric spanners, weighted graphs that approximate the Euclidean distances between a set of points in the Euclidean plane. In this case, the embedded metric is a finite metric space, whose distances are shortest path lengths in a graph, and the metric into which is embedded is the Euclidean plane. When the graph and its embedding are fixed, but the graph edge weights can vary, the stretch factor is minimized when the weights are exactly the Euclidean distances between the edge endpoints. Research in this area has focused on finding sparse graphs for a given point set that have low stretch factor.. The Johnson‚ÄìLindenstrauss lemma asserts that any finite metric space with points can be embedded into a Euclidean space of dimension with distortion , for any constant , where the constant factor in the -notation depends on the choice of .. This result, and related methods of constructing low-distortion metric embeddings, are important in the theory of approximation algorithms. A major open problem in this area is the GNRS conjecture, which (if true) would characterize the families of graphs that have bounded-stretch embeddings into \\\\ell_1 spaces as being all minor-closed graph families. In knot theory, the distortion of a knot is a knot invariant, the minimum stretch factor of any embedding of the knot as a space curve in Euclidean space. Undergraduate researcher John Pardon won the 2012 Morgan Prize for his research showing that there is no upper bound on the distortion of torus knots, solving a problem originally posed by Mikhail Gromov... In the study of the curve-shortening flow, in which each point of a curve in the Euclidean plane moves perpendicularly to the curve, with speed proportional to the local curvature, proved that the stretch factor of any simple closed smooth curve (with intrinsic distances measured by arc length) changes monotonically. More specifically, at each pair that forms a local maximum of the stretch factor, the stretch factor is strictly decreasing, except when the curve is a circle. This property was later used to simplify the proof of the Gage‚ÄìHamilton‚ÄìGrayson theorem, according to which every simple closed smooth curve stays simple and smooth until it collapses to a point, converging in shape to a circle before doing so...

The Court found that \\"selling arrangements\\" did not constitute a measure having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction on trade between Member States of the European Community, as it was then. Keck and Mithouard were prosecuted in France under anti-dumping retail laws for selling Picon liqueur at below cost price. The Court distinguished the case from its earlier jurisprudence on the content or characteristics or the products concerned. Thus the legislation in question fell outside the scope of the then article 30 of the Treaty of the European Community (now codified as article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). Facts Keck and Mithouard contended that their prosecution under French law, for selling products below wholesale prices, contravened TEEC article 30 (now TFEU art 34). A French competition law prohibited retail of products for prices below that which they had been purchased wholesale. The aim of this law was to prevent retailers engaging in 'cut-throat competition' by dumping excess produce onto the market, and forcing competitors out of business. Keck and Mithouard were charged with having sold Picon liqueur and Sati Rouge coffee below the purchase price. They argued that the law would discourage imports because importers are often new entrants to the market, and while trying to acquire market share and brand recognition they may wish to cut prices. Judgement The Court of Justice held that the French law was not incompatible with TEEC article 30 (now TFEU article 34) because the purpose was not to regulate trade. If a rule applies to all traders in the same manner, and affects them in the same way in law and in fact, it is lawful if it is merely a selling arrangement. This was the case for the French anti-dumping rules. Criticism and development of the Keck jurisprudence The judgment has been subject to a number of criticisms in the academic literature. In response to this, the Court has meanwhile diminished the importance of the Keck judgment, giving way to a refined 3-tiers-test.Kai Purnhagen, Keck is Dead, Long Live Keck? ‚Äì How the CJEU Tries to Avoid a Sunday Trading Saga 2.0 Even though the Court does not actively refer to the Keck judgment, it still applies its criteria in recent judgments.ECJ 21 September 2016, no.

In doing so, they became the first British team to sign up en masse. The majority joined the 16th (Service) Battalion of the Royal Scots, otherwise known as McCrae's Battalion. On the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916, the British Army lost nearly 20,000 men, including three of Hearts footballers who had signed up. The war ended up claiming the lives of seven of the Hearts players who had enlisted, with several others returning so severely wounded they were unable to play football again. Heart of Midlothian War Memorial unveiled in 1922 A memorial was erected in Edinburgh in 1922 to honour these men and the many others who fought in the two World Wars. It is presently situated in the Haymarket, near the offices where the main batch of players enlisted. Enlistment Hearts began the 1914‚Äì15 season with eight straight victories, including a 2‚Äì0 defeat of reigning champions Celtic. However, Britain had declared war on Germany in August 1914 and an ongoing public debate took place as to whether it was appropriate for professional football to continue while young soldiers were dying on the front line. The matter was debated in Parliament and a motion was placed before the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to postpone the season, with one of its backers, Airdrieonians chairman Thomas Forsyth declaring that \\"playing football while our men are fighting is repugnant\\". While this motion was defeated at the ballot box, with the SFA opting to wait for War Office advice, the noted East London philanthropist Frederick Charrington was orchestrating a public campaign to have professional football in Britain suspended, and achieving great popular support for his cause. The prime tactic of Charrington's campaign was to shame football players and officials into action through public and private denouncement. Letters were sent in to newspapers; the Edinburgh Evening News published one signed \\"A soldier's daughter\\", which suggested that \\"while Hearts continue to play football, enabled thus to pursue their peaceful play by the sacrifice of the lives of thousands of their countrymen, they might accept, temporarily, a nom de plume, say 'The White Feathers of Midlothian.'\\" Hearts, however, had already made active efforts to aid the war effort. Two players enlisted before a ball was even kicked in the season. On 16 August 1914, former Hearts director Harry Rawson, chairman of the Edinburgh Territorial Force Association, asked manager John McCartney if the club would use its influence to encourage recruiting. McCartney agreed to allow the authorities access to Tynecastle on match days in order to canvass for volunteers. On 20 August, it was announced that the entire playing staff would take part in weekly drill sessions to prepare them for the possibility of military service. The invitation was also extended to the players of rivals Hibernian to join in, several of whom accepted. On 14 November, the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders made an urgent appeal for volunteers at half time in match at Tynecastle against Falkirk. The initial response was disappointing, but at full-time several men stepped forward, including Hearts' winger James Speedie. In response to increasing appeals for volunteers, Sir George McCrae, a popular figure in Edinburgh, announced in November 1914 that he would raise a battalion himself ‚Äì the 16th Royal Scots ‚Äì and he boasted it would be full within seven days. At this time, Hearts comfortably led the First Division, but 11 of their players (in addition to the three players already serving) enlisted en-masse on 25 November 1914 , with a further five being declared unfit to serve. The following day, a further two players signed up, bringing the total up to 16 Hearts footballers enlisted in the services. 'McCrae's Battalion', as it came to be known, was the original sportsman's battalion. At least 30 professional footballers enlisted, including players from Hibernian, Raith Rovers, Falkirk and Dunfermline, as well as Hearts. The battalion was to become the 16th Royal Scots and was the first to earn the \\"footballer's battalion\\" sobriquet. The group of volunteers also contained some 500 Hearts supporters and ticket- holders, as well as 150 of Hibernian's followers. Military training was thus added to the Hearts players football training regime, and the side had a 20-game unbeaten run between October and February. The press described Hearts' football as \\"dainty, dazzling\\" and being \\"full of pace and panache.\\" However, exhaustion from their army exertions, twice including 10-hour nocturnal- marches the night before a league game, eventually led to a drop in form, as several enlisted players missed key games. Defeats to St Mirren and Morton allowed Celtic to usurp the Maroons and eventually claim the league title by four points. The Edinburgh Evening News expressed sympathy for Hearts and criticised their rivals; \\"Between them the two leading Glasgow clubs [Celtic and Rangers] have not sent a single prominent player to the Army. There is only one football champion in Scotland, and its colours are maroon and khaki.\\" As the war progressed, more Hearts players joined the services, including captain Bob Mercer who was conscripted in 1916 in spite of his cruciate injury and despite having been turned down in November 1914 when he attempted to enlist with his teammates. Fighting The war claimed the lives of seven first team players: * James Speedie ‚Äì killed in action, 25 September 1915 * Tom Gracie ‚Äì died on service, 23 October 1915 * Duncan Currie ‚Äì killed in action, 1 July 1916 * Harry Wattie ‚Äì killed in action, 1 July 1916 * Ernest Ellis ‚Äì killed in action, 1 July 1916 * James Boyd ‚Äì killed in action, 3 August 1916 * John Allan ‚Äì killed in action, 22 April 1917 Several players were discharged invalid as a result of wounds and injuries sustained: * Alfie Briggs ‚Äì wounded on 1 July 1916 * Paddy Crossan ‚Äì wounded twice and also gassed * James Hazeldean ‚Äì wounded * James Low ‚Äì wounded twice * James Martin ‚Äì wounded twice * Edward McGuire ‚Äì wounded * Bob Mercer ‚Äì gassed in 1918 * George Sinclair ‚Äì injured on service Four of the club's pre-war players died during the war: * George Badenoch (1901) ‚Äì killed in action, 15 June 1915 * Bill Cox (1907) ‚Äì suffered wounded and died from dysentery, 6 November 1915 * David Philip (1903‚Äì1910) ‚Äì killed in action, 29 April 1917 * Bobby Atherton (1895‚Äì1897) ‚Äì disappeared or killed in action, 19 October 1917 Hearts players who served McCrae's Battalion Died: Jimmy Boyd Duncan Currie Ernest Ellis Tom Gracie Jimmy Hawthorne Harry Wattie Survived: Alfie Briggs (wounded) Paddy Crossan (wounded) Norman Findlay Jimmy Frew James Hazeldean (wounded) James Low (wounded) Teddy McGuire (wounded) Annan Ness (wounded) Bob Preston (wounded) Willie Wilson (wounded) Other units Died: James Speedie John Allan Survived: Colin Blackhall James Gilbert Harry Graham Charles Hallwood James Macdonald Edward McGuire (wounded) John Mackenzie James Martin Bob Mercer (wounded) George Miller Neil Moreland (wounded) George Sinclair Wattie Scott Philip Whyte John Wilson (wounded) Aftermath Of the Hearts players that survived the war, several returned to play for the club again, including George Sinclair, Paddy Crossan and Bob Mercer. In 1919 they reached the final of the Victory Cup. Mercer, however, was never the same player but continued playing until retiring in 1924. He was persuaded to return for a farewell appearance in a friendly match against Selkirk at Ettrick Park in 1926. A few minutes into the game, Mercer suffered a fatal heart attack. Crossan's end was similar; he succumbed to his gas injuries in 1933. Sinclair fared better and continued to play football into the 1920s, including a spell in the United States. He went on to run Sinclair‚Äôs Bar in the Abbeyhill area of Edinburgh until his death in 1959. Hearts unveiled a memorial clocktower in Edinburgh's Haymarket junction on 9 April 1922, the fifth anniversary of the opening of the Battle of Arras. Secretary of State for Scotland, Robert Munro, told the attending crowd of 65,000 that the country owed a debt of gratitude to Hearts that could never be repaid. In 2013, following a period in storage during tramway construction, the Heart of Midlothian War Memorial returned close to its original location in time to mark the hundredth year since the start of World War I and the formation of McCrae's Battalion. In October 2014, the battalion was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. Every Remembrance Sunday, officials, players and supporters of Heart of Midlothian Football Club gather to pay their respects. There also exists a Great War Committee, which has raised funds to finance a commemorative cairn at Contalmaison in France. In 2018, the interactive play A War of Two Halves was presented at Tynecastle, dealing with the stories of the original 13 players who joined the 16th (Service) Battalion of the Royal Scots. It was first shown as part of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe on 27 August 2018. It ran again in the run-up to the centenary of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

Ratnoff discovered the substance later known as Factor XII and was one of the primary contributors to the delineation of the exact sequence that makes up the clotting cascade. He also made notable research contributions to the understanding of the complement system and to the detection and treatment of hemophilia. Ratnoff was a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, served as president of the American Society of Hematology, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He remained active in research at Case Western Reserve until he was 85 and he died in Cleveland a few years later. Early life Ratnoff was born prematurely, the son of a New York pediatrician. Ratnoff's father was an associate of notable pediatrician Henry Koplik. Koplik advised Ratnoff's father that the newborn had little chance of survival and that he should allow the child to die. Instead, Ratnoff's father used hot water bottles to keep him warm. Ratnoff survived and became a strong student at the Brooklyn Boys' School before enrolling at Columbia University when he was 16. After graduating from Columbia, a 19-year- old Ratnoff entered the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he graduated third in his medical school class. Ratnoff spent two years as an intern at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and then was a research fellow with physiologist Walter Cannon at Harvard Medical School. After another year spent working at hospitals in New York, Ratnoff enlisted in the military beginning in 1943. He was a member of the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, teaching aviation physiology before working as a physician at an army hospital. Career Returning from the military in 1946, Ratnoff secured a fellowship at Johns Hopkins. He became an instructor in medicine there, leaving in 1950 to move to Cleveland. Arthur Patek, the physician who recruited Ratnoff, may have also inspired some interest in coagulation. While a professor at Columbia, Patek had asked Ratnoff to review a research report on cirrhosis from noted physician Ernest Goodpasture. Ratnoff became interested in the observation that the blood of such patients clotted after death but soon turned back to liquid. While in Cleveland in 1954, Ratnoff encountered a young patient, railway worker John Hageman. The man had a long clotting time, but he had undergone successful surgery in the past without suffering from major bleeding. Working with biochemist Earl Davie, Ratnoff identified a protein missing in the man's blood. Ratnoff named the missing substance Hageman trait or Hageman factor. As other clotting factors had been discovered by the time of Ratnoff's encounter with his patient, Hageman factor became known as factor XII. In 1964, Ratnoff and Davie published their model of the clotting cascade; a similar cascade was independently reported by Robert Gwyn Macfarlane of the University of Oxford at around the same time. At Case Western University, Ratnoff was a professor, division chief of hematology-oncology and interim chief of medicine. Ratnoff had a long association with immunologist Irwin Lepow, and they conducted some of the early research on inhibition of the complement system. Ratnoff and Ted Zimmerman developed an assay in the early 1970s to distinguish between classic hemophilia and von Willebrand disease, then used the same technology to identify carriers of classic hemophilia. In 1972, the American Society of Hematology selected Ratnoff to deliver its Henry M. Stratton Lecture. Three years later, Ratnoff served as the organization's president. In the 1980s, Ratnoff became concerned about the risk of HIV transmission to patients with hemophilia because these patients received factor VIII treatments created from pooled blood samples. He and his associates had been the first to identify some of the symptoms of HIV/AIDS in hemophilia patients. Noting that AIDS antibodies were being increasingly detected among hemophiliacs, Ratnoff proposed at a 1983 Centers for Disease Control meeting that blood donors should be screened for hepatitis B as a surrogate for HIV, as there was no good screening test for HIV at the time. Ratnoff also favored using cryoprecipitate from local donors to treat these patients. Ultimately, his suggestions were not taken because of concerns that they would not result in enough clotting factor to meet patient demand. In the 1990s, genetic engineering techniques allowed for the production of factor VIII without donated blood. Honors and awards Ratnoff was the second recipient of the H. P. Smith Award for Distinguished Pathology Educator from the American Society for Clinical Pathology. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1976 and received the organization's Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal in 1985. He was named a Master of the American College of Physicians in 1983. He received the ACP's John Phillips Memorial Award in 1974 for outstanding contributions to clinical medicine. He won the Gerald M. Kober Medal from the Association of American Physicians in 1988. Later life Ratnoff, who received his first National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grant in 1951, was still NIH-funded as an emeritus professor in the 1990s. He remained engaged in research at Case Western Reserve until 2001. He died in 2008 and was survived by Marian, his wife of 63 years, and by two children. A sister, poetry director Helen Ratnoff Plotz, preceded him in death.

He was most notable for building an iron boat in 1820 and Pool‚Äôs Patent Principle for feathering paddle steamer wheels, which he patented in 1829. Career William Pool was born about 1783 at Thorne, Yorkshire, a shipbuilding port on the river Don. About 1812 Pool moved to Lincoln and married Catherine Dobb of Rotherham. Their second child was baptised at St Michael‚Äôs on the Mount, when they were living at Hospital Gate or Christ‚Äôs Hospital Terrace, just below Lincoln Cathedral. In this period he is known to have re-hung the Cathedral Bells and worked for Lord Monson, designing kitchen ranges and smoke jacks at Burton Hall near Lincoln. In 1820 he was to build an iron ship near the Pyewipe inn on the Fossdyke, which he successfully rowed. With the increasing use of the River Witham as a route for transporting passengers between Lincoln and Boston there was demand for swifter transport between the two commercial centres. Pool came to know Henry Bell of Helensburgh and with his help, he worked on new designs for paddle steamers. In 1812 Bell had built a steam powered paddle steamer called the PS Comet which was a development of William Symington‚Äôs Charlotte Dundas which had been launched in 1803. The Charlotte Dundas had a stern paddle wheel, while Bell was placing paddle wheels on the side of the vessel. It was this design of Paddle steamer that William Pool was to develop.

On 16 September 1827 he was granted a patent by the Edinburgh Patent Office For certain improvements in machinery for propelling vessels and giving motion to mills and other machinery. His paddles were now fitted to other local paddle steamers such as the Countess of Warwick, The British Queen and the Celerity and there was widespread adoption of his design.

He was chair of the Department of Anthropology at UC Irvine from 2005 to 2011 and was associate dean for research and graduate studies in the social sciences from 2011-13. He was appointed Dean of the School of Social Sciences in July 2013. From 2007-09, Maurer was President of the Association for Political and Legal Anthropology. Maurer is currently associate editor of the Journal of Cultural Economy and serves as a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Islamic Accounting and Business Research, Cultural Anthropology, Cultural Critique, and PoLAR: The Political and Legal Anthropology Review. In 2015, he was appointed to the Board on Behavioral, Cognitive and Sensory Sciences of the National Academy of Sciences. He is the recipient of four major National Science Foundation research grants on topics ranging from the cultures of international finance to mobile money and private digital currencies. In 2012, Maurer consulted on the renovation of the Citi Money Gallery at the British Museum. In 2015, he was invited to provide input with 14 other academics to the United States Department of the Treasury on the redesign of the US$10 bill. In 2016, Maurer was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for noteworthy advances in the fields of law and economic anthropology, specifically in banking and the meaning of money in different cultures. Research Maurer‚Äôs research encompasses ethnographic and historical work on the Caribbean offshore tax haven economy, specifically in the British Virgin Islands, Islamic banking and alternative currencies, and the material technologies and cultural practices money, finance, and law. Maurer‚Äôs first book Recharting the Caribbean: Land, Law and Citizenship in the British Virgin Islands shows how the offshore tax haven economy was not a foreign imposition, but rather grew out of local practices of kinship and land ownership and was shaped by local conflicts around class and race. This work highlights the role of colonial legal regimes and national sovereignty claims in the uneven geography of global finance. Maurer‚Äôs second book Mutual Life, Limited: Islamic Banking, Alternative Currencies, Lateral Reason compares global Islamic banking and finance with the local and alternative currency movement. Maurer‚Äôs work on money, especially his widely cited survey of the anthropology of money, challenges assumptions about money‚Äôs effects on social life and calls for a shift in focus away from money‚Äôs abstract meanings as a tool for producing equivalence and towards its diverse uses and practices, especially in settings that are not strictly market-based. More recently, Maurer has studied the cultural and political implications of mobile and digital technologies, especially cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Publications Maurer is the author of four books, the editor or co-editor of seven collections, and the author of numerous journal articles, book chapters, reviews, working papers, and other publications. His book Mutual Life, Limited: Islamic Banking, Alternative Currencies, Lateral Reason received the Victor Turner Prize for Ethnographic Writing in 2005. He is the Editor of the forthcoming 6-volume series from Bloomsbury Press on A Cultural History of Money.

The founding principal was Quek Swee Hwa, who was succeeded in 2011 by Philip Satterthwaite. BGST has its roots in Singapore Bible- Presbyterianism; Quek Swee Hwa was the senior pastor of Zion Serangoon Bible- Presbyterian Church when BGST was founded, and the institution was located at Zion Bishan Bible-Presbyterian Church from 1994 to 2004. Biblical Graduate School of Theology affirms biblical inerrancy, and Jesus' \\"propitiatory and expiatory death as a representative and substitutionary sacrifice.\\" It focuses on equipping \\"Christians in all walks of life\\" to \\"live more effectively for God.\\" BGST also affirms belief \\"in the principle of biblical separation which calls the individual and the church to holiness, being separated to God and from the world.\\" Its statement of faith goes on to say that \\"ecclesiastical separation involves rejecting any fellowship with organizations which deny the cardinal truths of Scripture in word or deed\\". This is what is known as \\"first-degree separation\\" (the \\"refusal to associate with groups who endorse questionable doctrinal beliefs or moral practices\\"), but does not go as far as \\"second-degree separation\\" (\\"refraining from association or identification with groups or individuals who do not practice first-degree separation\\"). BGST has not adopted the separatist stance of the Far Eastern Bible College, the other seminary in Singapore associated with the Bible-Presbyterian movement. Accreditation Biblical Graduate School of Theology is accredited by the Asia Theological Association to offer Graduate Diploma in Christian Studies, Master in Christian Studies, and Master of Divinity degrees. According to Brian Stiller, BGST has followed Regent College's vision of \\"giving the same theological integration to people undertaking societal careers as is normally given to people preparing for a Christian service career.\\" BGST and Regent College have an established agreement on the transfer of BGST credits to Regent. , 80% of BGST graduates were Singaporean. 56% of graduates were lay people who returned to their lay professions; 22% went into pastoral ministry; and 22% went into theological education and missions.

He was born in Yarmouth on the neck of Cape Cod and spent most of his life as a sea captain. He was known as Sleepy John because of his habit of falling asleep during the day. In the years leading up to the Revolutionary War the colonists were concerned about the loss of salt imports from overseas which were vital for the preservation of meat and fish. The Continental Congress declared a bounty of one third of a dollar for each bushel (56 pounds weight) produced, but it was soon discovered that boiling down seawater to produce it was highly uneconomic. John Sears adopted a different solution based on the evaporation of seawater in large wooden vats, which he constructed near his Cape Cod home in Dennis, Massachusetts. The process was inefficient and unrewarding at first, but he improved it by making the vats leakproof, providing moveable covers to keep out the rain and installing a salvaged bilge pump to draw water directly from the sea via leadlined wooden pipes. He profited considerably both from his production improvements and from the increase in the price of salt from 50 cents a bushel to $8 by the time the war finished in 1783. In 1785 he built a windmill to pump the water automatically from the sea. He died in 1817 a relatively rich man and was buried in nearby West Brewster. His epitaph is inscribed ‚ÄúJohn Sears, Inventor of the Salt Works, Aged 72 y‚Äôrs\\". He had married his wife Phebe Sears on 26 Dec 1771 in Yarmouth and had 9 children. By the time of his death many other local people had followed him into vat based salt production and by 1837 there were in excess of 650 saltworks on Cape Cod alone, an industry that prospered until cheaper alternative sources became available in the 1800s. He is nowadays jointly commemorated, together with John Winthrop, Jnr, by the annual award from the Chemists' Club and Chemical Heritage Foundation of the Winthrop-Sears Medal, which recognizes entrepreneurial achievement in the chemical field.

Reports of the number of fatalities concluded that 43 people died directly from the detonation. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attacks. The bombings were the worst terrorist attack in Beirut since the end of the Lebanese Civil War. They came twelve days after the bombing of a Russian airliner over the Sinai Peninsula that killed 224 people and a day before attacks in Paris that killed 137.\\"Why the Paris attacks overshadowed Beirut bombings\\", by Caitlin Dickson, Yahoo!

It later announced the arrest of two other Syrian and Lebanese suspects. They were arrested in a Palestinian refugee camp located in Burj al-Barajneh and a flat in the capital's eastern district of Achrafieh, which had allegedly been used to prepare the explosive belts. The initial plan was apparently to send five suicide bombers to a hospital in the neighbourhood, but heavy security forced them to change the target to a densely populated area.\\"Beirut bombing: Lebanese authorities arrest 11 people, mostly Syrians, over twin bombings\\", from ABC News Background Since 2011 the neighbouring country of Syria has been in a state of civil war. Shortly after its commencement, Lebanese groups have been divided along similar lines as in Syria, including participating in the war (such as Hezbollah involvement in Syria), as well as defending Lebanon within Lebanon itself. Lebanon has also faced a political vacuum since a continual failure to elect a new president (which has been requisite for a parliamentary election) since April 2014. Bombings Two suicide bombings occurred in a commercial district of the Bourj el-Barajneh suburb of Southern Beirut, near the General Security Post in Hussaineya street, an apparent known stronghold of the Shia Hezbollah, according to al-Manar television, The first bombing occurred outside a Shia mosque, while the second took place inside a nearby bakery before 18:00. The second blast occurred about 20 metres away and five to seven minutes after the first one as passers-by tried to help the injured of the initial blast. A potential third attacker was killed before exploding his vest. He was found dead with his legs torn off but still wearing an explosives belt, according to an unnamed Lebanese security official. An unnamed government employee speculated that he was killed by the second explosion due to his proximity to that blast. Al Mayadeen also reported about the would-be bomber and showed a video of a bearded young man with an explosives belt. Hezbollah's Bilal Farhat said: \\"They targeted civilians, worshippers, unarmed people, women and elderly, they only targeted innocent people ... [it was a] satanic, terrorist attack.\\" Lebanese security forces and Hezbollah gunmen cordoned off the area. The Health Ministry reported at least 43 deaths initially, with Health Minister Wael Abu Faour adding that 239 people were injured, but that the total casualty count was expected to rise due to some of the wounded people being in critical condition. Lebanon's International Red Cross and Red Crescent Society affiliate said that over 200 people were injured. Hospitals in the area called for people to donate blood due to an unprecedented number of casualties. Emergency services personnel asked by-standers to leave the area as they were hindering ambulances from ferrying the injured to medical institutions. Victims Amongst the initial casualties were two staff members of the American University of Beirut, according to the school, although no further details were announced.

She represented the United States in the 80-meter hurdles at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, becoming the first African-American woman to compete in the Olympic Games. Biography Tidye Pickett was born in Chicago, Illinois, on November 3, 1914. Her mother was Sarah Pickett, a factory clerk, and Louis Pickett, a foundry foreman. She grew up in Englewood, a Chicago neighborhood. She took up running as a schoolgirl; after competing in some local meets she caught the attention of long jumper John Brooks, who began to coach her. At the 1932 United States Olympic Trials Pickett competed in the 100-meter dash, winning her heat and placing third in her semi-final; she qualified for the final, where she placed sixth. Pickett was named to the American Olympic team as part of the eight-woman 4 √ó 100 meter relay pool; she and Louise Stokes, who was also part of the relay pool, were the first African-American women to be selected for the Olympic Games, but both of them were left out of the final four-woman relay lineup that ran at the Olympics. Pickett and Stokes suffered racial discrimination during their Olympic trip; whether racism also played a role in their omission from the Olympic relay is disputed and unclear. Pickett continued her running career; in 1934 she ran the opening leg on a Chicago Park District team that set an unofficial world record of 48.6 in the 4 √ó 110 yard relay. At the 1936 United States Olympic Trials she competed in the 80-meter hurdles, placing second and qualifying for the Olympics in Berlin. At the Olympics, Pickett survived the heats but went out in the semi-finals, falling at the second hurdle and injuring herself; she was the first African-American woman, as well as the first Illinois State University athlete, to compete in the Olympic Games. Pickett later became a schoolteacher, serving as principal at an elementary school in East Chicago Heights until her retirement in 1980; when she retired, the school was renamed after her. She died in Chicago Heights, Illinois, on November 17, 1986.

His memoirs of the revolt is the only known rebel testimony available about the revolt that \\"does not slip into ideological discourse\\", according to historian Nadine Meouchy.Meouchy, ed. Leibau, p. 506. Biography=Early life and career Al-Sa'dun was born to a Sunni Muslim family in Jisr al-Hadid in the Sanjak of Alexandretta (modern-day Hatay Province) during Ottoman rule. Although he did not receive a military education, al-Sa'dun was known for his shooting skills and equestrianism. In 1914, during World War I, he volunteered to serve in the Ottoman Army's Hamidiye cavalry in Iraq against British forces.Arsuzi, ed. Sluglett and Weber, p. 590. Anti-French resistance Al-Sa'dun returned to his homeland after the war and in 1919 formed a rebel band to counter the French occupation of northern Syria. His revolt became part of the wider Hananu Revolt and he was responsible for the Jabal Qusayr military zone,Meouchy, ed. Leibau, p. 510. with his headquarters in Babatorun.Meouchy, ed. Leibau, p. 512. The revolt largely petered out in the summer of 1921 with the flight of its overall leader Ibrahim Hananu. However, al-Sa'dun continued the armed struggle by first fleeing to Turkey, which he used as a base for raids against the French in Syria. He lived there in the city of Gaziantep with his family. In 1922, he launched a punitive expedition against Jabal Zawiya with the apparent target being defectors from the revolt, and later on 26 August, his rebel band, consisting of about 100 fighters, attacked a postal convoy traveling between Antioch and Darkush. He continued his guerrilla campaign against the French between December 1925 and August 1926, during the countrywide Great Syrian Revolt. The last major clashes with the French were at Tell 'Amar in April 1926 and in Jabal Qusayr in August 1926.Arsuzi-Elamir, ed. Sluglett and Weber, p. 592. Later life Al-Sa'dun opposed Turkish claims over the Sanjak of Alexandretta and sought to campaign for the region to remain part of Syria. He moved to Aleppo where he lived in hiding from the authorities in the 1930s. on his way to the Sanjak of Alexandretta, he was arrested by the French authorities. He was subsequently cleared of the charges against him, but he was placed under house arrest. His house arrest ended in 1940, and Syria gained its independence in 1946. In 1950, al-Sa'dun completed his memoirs of his experiences in the Hananu Revolt. Al-Sa'dun lived the remainder of his life in Salqin, a Syrian town near the Turkish border with the former Sanjak of Alexandretta. He died in 1980.

In the frequency domain, the signal is moved from one frequency to another. if {}}{\\\\longleftrightarrow} X (\\\\omega_1,...,\\\\omega_M)}} then {}}{\\\\longleftrightarrow} X (\\\\omega_1 - \\\\theta_1,...,\\\\omega_M - \\\\theta_M)}} Typically the carrier signal is a sinusoidal signal and in various applications. The figures below illustrate a quick example of a 2-D modulation. The original signal from () is modulated with a sinusoidal signal to get (). The equations () and () are the real and the imaginary components of the modulated signal. Original plot of MD signal Real value plot of MD modulated signal Imaginary value plot (90o phase shift) of MD modulated signal Absolute value plot of MD modulated signal Phase plot of MD modulated signal Background/Motivation The MD modulation is one of the properties of the Multidimensional Fourier Transform. MD Fourier Transform (FT) Fourier Transform (FT) of multi-dimensional (MD) signal or system is the transform of the MD signal or system that decomposes it into its frequency components. Essentially, it is the frequency response of the MD signal or system, so it depicts the frequency characteristics of the signal or system. A special case of the MD transform is the 1-D Fourier transform. Computation The formula for computing the Fourier transform of an MD signal is X (\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2,...,\\\\omega_M) {=} \\\\sum_{n_1=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{n_2=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty ... \\\\sum_{n_M =-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x (n_1,n_2,...,n_M) e^{-j(\\\\omega_1 n_1 + \\\\omega_2 n_2 +,...,+ \\\\omega_M n_M)} If the frequency response is given instead, then the inverse FT formula is used to derive the input signal or system. In this case the formula used is: x (n_1,n_2,...,n_M) {=} \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^M} \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} ... \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} X (\\\\omega_1,\\\\omega_2,...,\\\\omega_M) e^{j(\\\\omega_1 n_1 + \\\\omega_2 n_2 +,...,+ \\\\omega_M n_M)} d\\\\omega_1 d\\\\omega_2...d\\\\omega_M Approaches / Extended Applications of MD Modulation=Multidimensional AM and FM Multidimensional AM or FM is AM-FM modulation where the a Multidimensional message signal is modulated (or multiplied) with a Multidimensional sinusoidal signal. From the special case of Parseval‚Äôs theorem (MD FT Properties), it is noted that the energy or power of a signal is directly proportional to the magnitude of the signal, and since most of the signals in this case are sinusoidal, it is well noted that the energy or power is directly proportional to the amplitude of the sinusoid. Since power management is always an issue, the modulation of the amplitude isn‚Äôt always the best solution when the application is trying to be power conscious. 2-D Modulation based Applications  A 2-D modulation comprises a space domain that has 2 independent variables e.g. x(n1,n2) with a corresponding frequency domain that also has 2 independent variables X(œâ1, œâ2). =2-D AM and FM analysis= Image texturization is an application of multidimensional AM-FM modulation. In this method, the image (2-D signal) is expressed into its special frequencies and amplitude estimates. The signal is represented as a product of 2 FM functions (using the independent frequencies), making is separable. Using the instantaneous frequency, the image can be represented topologically to illustrate its texture. 3-D Modulation based Applications 3-D modulation uses 3-D message and carrier signals. 3D scanner: Some 3-D scanners used modulated light, typically amplitude modulation, together with a camera to scan an object. 3-D TOF cameras: They use modulated light sources and its reflection for depth perception computation. In essence, creating a 2-D image with depth perception helps separate the foreground and background.

She is an angel investor and focuses her funds on women-led companies. She has won numerous awards and recognition during her career including the National Institute of Health's 10-year merit award, Order of the British Empire and the Albert Einstein Award. Biography Una Scully was born on December 18, 1941 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to a British father who was interned in a Japanese camp during World War II. Scully and her mother fled by boat from Singapore to England, where she completed her education, graduating with a degree in zoology from the University of Bristol in 1963. In 1965, she began publishing under the name of Una Smith and did so until 1973. She went on to complete a PhD at the University of Cambridge in 1967 and that same year moved to the United States, taking up a Howard Hughes Fellowship at the University of Miami to study angiotensin-converting enzymes. After completion of the fellowship, Smith taught as a professor of life sciences and medicine at the University of Miami School of Medicine from 1972 to 1989. In 1975, her professional publishing reflected her name as U. S. Ryan or Una Scully Ryan. Her work at Miami was recognized by a 10-year Merit Award from the National Institutes of Health. In 1989, Ryan married the surgeon, Allan Dana Callow and then beginning in 1990, she worked as a Research Professor of Surgery, Medicine and Cell Biology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. Simultaneously, she accepted a position at Monsanto as Director for Health Sciences. She left Monsanto in 1992 and joined AVANT Immunotherapeutics Inc. as a Vice-President and Chief Scientific Researcher in May 1993. Around the same time, she left Washington University for a position as a Research Professor of Medicine at Boston University School of Medicine and obtained US citizenship in 1994. In 1996, Ryan was promoted to President at AVANT and also began serving as chief executive officer and President of Celldex Therapeutics Inc., all the while continuing to research and publish papers on vaccines against viral and bacterial diseases and for cholesterol management. Ryan was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 2002 for her contributions to research and development to biotechnology. In 2007, she was honored with the Albert Einstein Award for her development of new vaccines to combat global infectious diseases and then in 2008, she left the for-profit sector leaving her positions at AVANT and Celldex. In 2009 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bristol. In addition to vaccines, Ryan has worked on clean water solutions and in 2009 was awarded a Cartier Women's Initiative Awards for a wastewater cleaning program using blue-green algae and solar energy. Unable to secure venture capital funds for the program, Ryan turned her focus toward a program called Diagnostics for All, in an attempt to provide inexpensive diagnostic tests to developing countries. The innovation used paper tests and a drop of blood which when chemicals were applied would change color to indicate different results, without lab work required and simple disposal, as the paper could be burned. The company began with liver testing and then expanded their products to include pregnancy tests and a glucose monitoring test for diabetics. Deciding to relocate to the American west coast in 2013, Ryan accepted a position as the first woman to Chair the Bay Area BioEconomy Initiative. While she was in Boston, Ryan had served on the board of the Biotechnology Industry Organization and the BioEconomy Initiative had similar aims of increasing efficiency and decreasing the time it takes for products to begin clinical trials and ultimately get to medical professionals. She also turned her focus to angel investing in an attempt to help women-run businesses find venture capital funds. Ryan served as managing director of Golden Seeds, as a partner in Astia Angel and participated with The Angel Forum all aimed at investing in startups and mentoring businesses in the Silicon Valley. She continues to serve on the boards of several biotechnology firms. In 2015, Ryan launched ULUX fine art based on her electron micrographs.

Early life Born in Raetihi on 21 September 1936, McLeavey was the son of Leslie Francis McLeavey and Elizabeth Theresa McLeavey (n√©e McTiernan). His father worked on the railways and his childhood was spent moving around railway settlements in New Zealand's North Island, including Ohakune, Levin, Napier, Feilding, New Plymouth, Waitara, and Lower Hutt. He credited the beginning of his interest in art to a teacher at his high school in Waitara. Career Peter McLeavey Gallery in mourning Jeremy Diggle, Professor of Fine Arts at Massey University, called McLeavey \\"the most important commercial gallerist New Zealand has ever had, effectively the pre-eminent publisher of modern New Zealand art in the past 50 years\\". His eponymous gallery is the longest-lived in New Zealand. McLeavey started his art dealing career in 1966, showing art in the bedroom of his apartment on central Wellington street The Terrace. His first sale was a Toss Woollaston landscape. In a 2009 documentary about his life, The Man in the Hat, McLeavey stated that he set up the gallery to \\"feed the culture, and to expose the culture to people who didn't know about it\\". In 1968 he opened a gallery in two rooms on the first floor of 147 Cuba Street in Wellington. Alongside other early emerging dealer galleries, such as Barry Lett Galleries in Auckland, Peter McLeavey Gallery played an important role in encouraging collectors to support contemporary New Zealand artists. Among his major sales were Colin McCahon's Northland Panels to the then National Art Gallery (now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa) in 1978. This is now seen as one of McCahon's most important works. The gallery continues to operate at that location, and more than 500 exhibitions have been mounted there. McLeavey's daughter, Olivia McLeavey, took over the running of the gallery in 2011, when his health declined. The Peter McLeavey Gallery currently represents some of New Zealand's best-known modern and contemporary artists, including Laurence Aberhart, Bill Hammond, Richard Killeen, Colin McCahon, Yvonne Todd, Robin White, Toss Woollaston, and Jeffrey Harris. McLeavey died in Wellington on 12 November 2015 at the age of 79. In September 2018 his archive was acquired by the Alexander Turnbull Library. It will be available by request in late 2019 or 2020. The Man in the Hat In 2009, a documentary about McLeavey was released, directed by Luit Bieringa, produced by Jan Bieringa, and filmed by cinematographer Leon Narbey. The documentary intersperses scenes of McLeavey going about life at home, in inner-city Wellington, and in his gallery with readings by New Zealand actor Sam Neill from McLeavey's correspondence with artists. Peter McLeavey: The life and times of a New Zealand art dealer In 2013 a biography of McLeavey by Jill Trevelyan was published by Te Papa Press. The biography, Peter McLeavey: The life and times of a New Zealand art dealer was named the 2014 New Zealand Post Book Awards Book of the Year.  Honours  Massey University awarded McLeavey an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts (DFA) in 2010 and he was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the arts in the 2012 Queen's Birthday and Diamond Jubilee Honours.

The front of Foxcote House contains large gardens. The house was constructed c.1740, its design has been attributed to Edward Woodward. It was traditionally the family seat of the Canning family; ten generations of the Canning family resided at the house until the death of Robert Canning in 1848. Foxcote House was occupied by a private school before its purchase in the 1960s by Christopher Boot Holman, an heir of the pharmaceutical retail company Boots the Chemist. The Holmans restored the house and it was sold by them in 1997 to the American billionaire Les Wexner. The 1997 sale price has been quoted as ¬£3 million or ¬£8 million. The Wexners attend the annual pheasant shooting season each October and host traditional British shooting parties in a former Catholic chapel that adjoins the house. The Foxcote House estate has been valued at ¬£20 million. The Wexners have refurbished the house and have purchased surrounding land to restore its estate. The Wexners are financial supporters of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), and in a video tour of Foxcote House made for the international company of the RSC, it is stated that at the time of the Wexner's purchase, the top floor of the house had been sealed off for 50 years and the house was in a state of \\"complete dilapidation\\".

It is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. It is the most common drakaea and has the widest distribution.  Description  Drakaea glyptodon is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter, glabrous, dull blue-grey with darker lines radiating from the attachment to the stem. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. Its flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp, except that the labellum is shorter and more swollen than those of other drakaeas. The flowers are pollinated by the wasp Zaspilothynnus trilobatus. King in his carriage can be distinguished by lacking a spine on the column. The flowers of Drakaea elastica and Drakaea concolor also lack a spine, but the species can be distinguished by having a glossy, dark green leaf (D. concolor) or having a glossy, light green leaf (D. elastica). The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a \\"head\\" about one-third long as the \\"body\\", has only a few hairs and is covered with dark lumps. The rest of the labellum (representing the female \\"body\\" of the insect) is dark maroon in colour, hairy on the upper two-thirds and glabrous on the lower part. Flowers appear from late August to late October.  Taxonomy and naming  Drakaea glyptodon was first formally described by Robert D. FitzGerald in 1882 in The Gardeners' Chronicle. The specific epithet (glyptodon) refers to \\"an extinct South American animal related to the Armadillo\\". \\"The whole lip [labellum] resembles in form (miniature, of course) the enormous extinct tortoise- monster, glyptodon, a creature as large as an ox and covered with tesselated scales.\\"  Distribution and habitat  King in his carriage occurs from near the Eneabba district to Condingup east of Esperance. It grows in sand or gravelly soils near swamps that fill in winter.

The major physiological roles of PCFTs are in mediating the intestinal absorption of folate (Vitamin B9), and its delivery to the central nervous system. Structure PCFT is located on chromosome 17q11.2 and consists of five exons encoding a protein with 459 amino acids and a MW of ~50kDa. PCFT is highly conserved, sharing 87% identity to the mouse and rat PCFT and retaining more than 50% amino acid identity to the frog (XP415815) and zebrafish (AAH77859) proteins. Structurally, there are twelve transmembrane helices with the N- and C- termini directed to the cytoplasm and a large internal loop that divides the molecule in half. There are two glycosylation sites (N58, N68) and a disulfide bond connecting residues C66, in the 1st and C298 in the 4th, external loop. Neither glycosylation nor the disulfide bond are essential for function. Residues have been identified that play a role in proton-coupling, proton binding, folate binding and oscillation of the carrier between its conformational states. PCFT forms oligomers and some of the linking residues have been identified. Properties and Regulation PCFT-mediated transport into cells is optimal at pH 5.5. The low- pH activity and the structural specificity of PCFT (high affinity for folic acid, and low affinity for PT523 - a non-polyglutamable analog of aminopterin) distinguishes this transporter functionally from the other major folate transporter, the reduced folate carrier (optimal activity at pH 7.4, very low affinity for folic acid and very high affinity for PT523), another member (SLC19A1) of the superfamily of solute transporters. Influx mediated by PCFT is electrogenic and can be assessed by current, cellular acidification, and radiotracer uptake. Influx has a Km range of 0.5 to 3¬µM for most folates and antifolates at pH 5.5. The influx Km rises and the influx Vmax falls as the pH is increased, least so for the antifolate, pemetrexed. The transporter is specific for the monoglutamyl forms of folates. A variety of organic anions inhibit PCFT-mediated transport at extremely high ratio of inhibitor to folate, the most potent are sulfobromophthalein, p-aminobenzylglutamate, and sulfathalazine. This may have pharmacological relevance in terms of the inhibitory effect of these agents on the intestinal absorption of folates. The PCFT minimal promoter has been defined and contains an NRF1 response element. There is also evidence for a role of vitamin D in the regulation of PCFT with a VDR response element upstream of the minimal promoter. PCFT mRNA was reported to be increased in folate-deficient mice. Pattern of Expression PCFT is expressed in the proximal jejunum with a lower level of expression elsewhere in the intestine. Expression is localized to the apical membrane of intestinal and polarized MDCK dog kidney cells. PCFT is also expressed at the basolateral membrane of the choroid plexus. In view of the low levels of folate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PCFT-null humans, PCFT must play a role in transport of folates across the choroid plexus into the CSF; however, the underlying mechanism for this has not been established. PCFT is expressed at the sinusoidal (basolateral) membrane of the hepatocyte, the apical brush- border membrane of the proximal tubule of the kidney, the basolateral membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium and the placenta. There is a prominent low- pH folate transport activity in the cells and/or membrane vesicles derived from these tissues which, in some cases, has been shown to be indicative of a proton-coupled folate transport process. However, it is unclear as to the extent that PCFT contributes to folate transport across these epithelia. Consequences of the loss-of-function of PCFT The physiological role of PCFT is known based upon the phenotype of subjects with loss-of-function mutations of this gene ‚Äì the rare autosomal hereditary disorder, hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM). These subjects have two major abnormalities: (i) severe systemic folate deficiency and (ii) a defect in the transport of folates from blood across the choroid plexus into the CSF with very low CSF folate levels even when the blood folate level is corrected or supranormal. Severe anemia, usually macrocytic, always accompanies the folate deficiency. Sometimes there is pancytopenia and/or hypogammaglobulinemia and/or T-cell dysfunction which can result in infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. There can be GI signs including diarrhea and mucositis. The CNS folate deficiency is associated with a variety of neurological findings including developmental delays and seizures. The phenotype of the PCFT-null mouse has been reported and mirrors many of the findings in humans. PCFT was initially reported to be a low-affinity heme transporter. However, a role for PCFT in heme and iron homeostasis is excluded by the observation that humans or mice with loss-of-function PCFT mutations are not iron or heme deficient and the anemia, and all other systemic consequences of the loss of this transporter, are completely corrected with high-dose oral, or low-dose, parenteral folate. Potential pharmacological role  Because of the Warburg effect, and a compromised blood supply, human epithelial cancers grow within an acidic milieu, as lactate is produced during anaerobic glycolysis. Because PCFT activity is optimal at low pH, and its expression and a prominent low-pH transport activity are present in human cancers, there is interest in exploiting these properties by the development of antifolates that have a high affinity for this transporter and a very low affinity for the reduced folate carrier which delivers antifolates to normal tissues and thereby mediates the toxicity of these agents. A novel class of inhibitors of one carbon incorporation into purines is being developed with these properties. Pemetrexed, an antifolate inhibitor primarily of thymidylate synthase, is a good substrate for PCFT even at neutral pH as compared to other antifolates and folates.

His father was James Johnson Battersby of the old-established Stockport firm of Battersby Hats and James junior was a director of the firm. His father was travelling as a first class passenger on the at the time of her sinking in 1915, after the ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat, and was the last to be rescued before the ship sank. In 1935, Battersby married Cynthia Hel√®ne Metcalfe (born 1914) at St George's Church, Stockport, and they had four children together. Fascism In the 1930s, Battersby was increasingly attracted to fascism and became a district leader in Stockport for Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF). In August 1934 he spoke at Sale on the position of the Lancashire cotton industry, arguing for protection of the industry from \\"the men who had financed oriental competition\\" that threatened the livelihoods of Lancashire men.\\"Sale hears the fascist policy\\", The Blackshirt, 10 August 1934, p. 11.

In June 1935 he gave a talk on fascism at a Stockport Sunday school, and he and Mrs Battersby met the children afterwards.\\"Blackshirt News\\", The Blackshirt, 14 June 1935. As well as his speaking engagements Battersby was also a regular donor of funds to the BUF coffers.Robert Benewick, Political Violence and Public order, London: Allan Lane, 1969, p. 199 As he became more deeply involved, Battersby was eventually forced to resign from the board of Battersby's Hats in August 1939 (he was known as \\"the mad hatter\\" in fascist circles) and he left his wife and children to \\"serve Hitler\\". Second World War Latchmere House in 2012 In June 1940, after the outbreak of the Second World War, Battersby was detained by the British government under the newly introduced Defence Regulation 18B and sent to Camp 020 at Latchmere House, London, with a number of other fascist sympathisers.Warburton, John & Jeffrey Wallder. (2008) The Defence Regulation 18B British Union Detainees List. Revised edition. Friends of Oswald Mosley. p. 7. He wrote a diary of his time there, which was published in 1947 as The Bishop Said Amen: On the Author's Experiences During Detention as a Pacifist, in which he complained that \\"everything possible was done to agitate, frustrate and torment us\\". In his memoirs, Charlie Watts, BUF district leader Westminster St. George's, remembered Battersby at Latchmere House and wrote of the meagre rations they all received and the threats from the guards to put them before a firing squad if they caused any trouble. Later, they were both transferred to what the BUF referred to as the \\"Ascot Concentration Camp\\" in Berkshire, in reality a hastily arranged internment camp, where they became close friends.\\"It has happened here\\" by Charlie Watts, Comrade, June/July 1990, pp. 4-5. Battersby was transferred to the Isle of Man, with other fascists, where he met and became a close friend of Captain Thomas Baker MC who professed to believe that Adolf Hitler was Christ returned and conducted religious rituals on that basis. Baker was regarded by the camp authorities as an impostor more interested in the money of his fellow internees than the fascist cause, but Battersby took his views quite seriously and they contributed to his developing religious mania. In June 1943, Battersby was released from detention and appeared before a conscientious objectors tribunal where he offered to broadcast his views to the British nation. The offer was not taken up. Kingdom House After the end of the Second World War, Battersby led a religious community which he named the Legion of Christian Reformers, sometimes called the League of Christian Reformers, or the Christian Herald Group, at Kingdom House, River, West Sussex, a house donated to them by fascist and wealthy barrister W. G. Barlow.https://www.historytoday.com/miscellanies/british-church-worshipped- hitler \\"The British Church That Worshipped Hitler\\", History Today, 11 September 2018 There they held services in front of a special altar, guarded by two large dogs according to Macklin, during which they worshipped Adolf Hitler as Christ returned to rid the world of the Devil. The activities of the group soon attracted the attention of politicians and the press. On 29 November 1945, The Daily Herald reported that a Mr A. Wilson had bought two swastika flags from the sale of the effects of the former German embassy in London and claimed he intended to give them to James Battersby. The Herald's reporter wrote that in residence at Kingdom House were Thomas Baker and his wife, a Mr Schneider (presumably A. J. Schneider), a housekeeper and a young man, but that they hoped to have a self-supporting community of up to 16. Prayers were held morning and evening in a small chapel.

In 1952, Battersby disrupted the annual two-minute silence at the Cenotaph in London by shouting, according to police evidence, \\"This is the day of English judgement. I speak the truth. English children must be saved. Trust God and the eternal Christ. Heil Hitler.\\" He was said then to have stood to attention and given the Nazi salute. Battersby was then arrested and taken to Cannon Row Police Station. He appeared at Bow Street Magistrates Court charged with \\"insulting behaviour\\" whereby a breach of the peace might be occasioned, and using insulting words. Battersby pleaded not guilty. A police inspector said that Battersby had been arrested for his own safety after the crowd became hostile. He heard shouts of \\"Cut his throat\\" and \\"String him up\\". Battersby had on him five photographs of Hitler and a programme for the Cenotaph ceremony on which his exclamation was written. He also had affidavits from three Harley Street doctors dated 1947 to say that he was sane and a copy of his Aryan Testament (1951). Battersby claimed to have spoken out of \\"the deepest sense of responsibility to God and to my fellow countrymen.\\" He claimed that for 25 years he had been a student of theology, divinity and eschatology and the judgement of which he spoke was nothing to do with one country or another but of the whole world.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Early life Davie was born on October 25, 1927 in Tacoma, Washington, to Charles and Teckla Davie. He grew up in La Grande, Washington and attended Eatonville High Schoolhttps://www.flintofts.com/obituary/Earl-Warren-Davie/Clyde-Hill- WA/1874870. He received an undergraduate degree in 1950 from the University of Washington, where he had worked in the laboratory of biochemistry professor Donald Hanahan. He completed a Ph.D. at UW in 1954. During his doctoral studies, Davie worked with Hans Neurath to learn about protein structure and function. Career After a postdoctoral fellowship with Fritz Lipmann at Harvard Medical School, Davie worked at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine from 1957 to 1962, where he met hematologist Oscar Ratnoff, the discoverer of Hageman factor (later known as factor XII). He then returned to the University of Washington, later chairing the biochemistry department for several years. Davie has made significant research contributions to the understanding of coagulation. Davie and Ratnoff described the sequence of steps in the clotting cascade. Davie and Ratnoff published their clotting cascade model in 1964, around the same time that Robert Gwyn Macfarlane of the University of Oxford produced a similar model. Davie cofounded a biotechnology company, ZymoGenetics, in 1981.

After Dragondoor folded up and became El Dorado Wrestling, Oyanagi finally returned to in-ring action, wrestling this time as a Densha Otoko-inspired otaku character who used anime merchandising in his matches. He also went as Billy Oyanagi, a parody of Billy Blanks. However, after his old enemy Taru gave him a beatdown and advised him to take wrestling seriously, Oyanagi dropped his comedy characters and announced that he was going to go \\"strong-style\\". He adopted plain black tights and wrestling shoes, in the tradition of old-fashioned wrestlers like Antonio Inoki and Yoshiaki Fujiwara, and became a mat wrestling technician, capitalizing on his grappling skills and flexibility to overwhelm his opponents and counter any movement. Now as a serious menace, he allied with Toru Owashi's faction Animal Planets and went against the heel Hell Demons, having also and on/off alliance with Kagetora. When El Dorado folded in 2008, he joined its next incarnation, Secret Base, as a regular member, but officially signing up with Michinoku Pro Wrestling. Michinoku Pro Wrestling (2008‚Äì2016) Manjimaru. Oyanagi, now and ever under his technician persona, debuted in Michinoku Pro forming a tag team with Kesen Numajiro and capturing shockingly the Tohoku Tag Team Championship from Kowloon (Kei and Shu Sato). Their success was short-lived, as they were eliminated from the Michinoku Tag League 2009 by another team of Kowloon (Hayato Fujita and Rasse) and ended losing the title in two months to stable members Maguro Ooma and Takeshi Minamino. Oyanagi and Numajiro kept teaming up for a time against the heel stable, but it was Oyanagi alone who gained a title shot for the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship against Rui Higuaji. He kept wrestling in low profile matches through 2010 and 2011, excluding a better performance along with Jinsei Shinzaki in the Michinoku Tag Tournament 2012, where they eliminated Yapper Man #1 and Yapper Man #2 before falling to Minamino and Manjimaru. His break came in 2014, wrestling Hayato Fujita to a draw during the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Title Tournament and challenging Brahman Shu for the title shortly after. He would get also a great victory by submitting The Great Sasuke in Oyanagi's anniversary event. On May 3, 2016, Kinya announced his retirement match on November 3, which took place against Jinsei Shinzaki with a loss to Oyanagi.

OSC enzymes' catalytic mechanism is similar to the prokaryotic squalene-hopene cyclase. Directed evolution and protein design have been used to identify small numbers of point mutations that alter the product specificities of OSC enzymes, most notably in altering a cycloartenol synthase to produce predominantly lanosterol.  Structure  Oxidosqualene cyclase is a monomeric enzyme. Its active site consists of a depression between two barrel domains. The active site is mostly made up of acidic amino acids in the majority of organisms. The residues in the active site make it energetically favorable for oxidosqualene to take on a more folded conformation, which closely resembles its product. This crucially sets the substrate up for the series of reactions that form the rings. Oxidosqualene is located in the cell‚Äôs microsome membranes where it can easily harvest its hydrophobic substrate and turn out its hydrophobic product.  Biological Function  Oxidosqualene cyclase is a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. It catalyzes the formation of lanosterol, which is then converted through many steps into cholesterol. The body uses cholesterol for temperature regulation. It is also a precursor for testosterone in males and oestradiol in females.Berg JM, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L (2012). Biochemistry (7th ed.). New York: W.H. Freeman and Company. .  Regulation  The enzyme‚Äôs genetic expression is regulated by sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-2), a molecule which also regulates the expression of other enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.  Enzyme Mechanism  The figure shows how, in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, squalene is converted to oxidosqualene, which is then converted to lanosterol by oxidosqualene cyclase. Lanosterol is a precursor to cholesterol. This final conversion occurs in many steps. Mechanistically, the enzyme catalyzes the formation of four rings along the long chain of the substrate (oxidosqualene), producing lanosterol. This cyclization is one of the most complex known enzyme functions and is highly selective.Bloch, Konrad. ‚ÄúThe Biological Synthesis of Cholesterol.‚Äù Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1964. In the enzyme‚Äôs active site, a histidine residue activates an aspartic acid residue, which protonates the substrate‚Äôs epoxide, setting off a series of carbon-carbon bond formations that form rings. Finally, the enzyme deprotonates to yield lanosterol, which has a hydroxyl group instead of an epoxide. This hydroxyl group can be seen in the image above.  Disease Relevance  High blood cholesterol, also called hypercholesterolemia, significantly increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, and peripheral artery disease. If untreated, it can also lead to plaque accumulation in blood vessels, which is known as atherosclerosis. For this reason, the sterol biosynthetic pathway has long been a target for the drug development industry. Statins, which inhibit HMG-CoA reductase (an enzyme that catalyzes an earlier step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway) are commonly prescribed to treat high cholesterol. However, the efficacy and safety of statins has been recently scrutinized in a number of reports. This is largely because blocking the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway before squalene has been found to disrupt the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are used for the biosynthesis of key molecules in RNA transcription, ATP synthesis, and other essential cell activities. Oxidosqualene cyclase, which is downstream of squalene in the pathway, is an attractive target for inhibition. Many inhibitors have been proposed, among them steroid analogs, phenol-based compounds, benzamide and carboxamide derivatives, and nitrogen- containing heterocyclic compounds. The most effective inhibitors have a hydrogen-bond acceptor at a specific distance away from a hydrophobic region. Inhibitors of oxidosqualene cyclase have shown promise as antimicrobial agents as well, because they‚Äôve been shown to kill off trypanosoma cruzi. Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite transmitted to people by insects, mostly in Latin America. The parasite causes a disease called Chagas disease, in which acute infections around an insect bite can lead to more serious complications, such as decreased heart, esophagus, colon, and even brain function.  Evolution  Stork, et al. compared the protein sequences of C. albicans oxidosqualene cyclase with the analogous enzyme (squalene cyclase) in two different bacteria and found conserved regions in the former. Rabelo et al. found a conserved active site across seven organisms. It is believed that animal and fungal oxidosqualene cyclases likely evolved from their prokaryotic counterparts.

Concept and creation Concept artwork of Linkle wielding a red and silver crossbow was first seen in the official art book for Hyrule Warriors, with a note that a female Link was considered for the game. A later tweet from Hyrule Warriors developer Koei Tecmo's Twitter account pondered as to whether they should include her, following the attention she received. A trailer for the Nintendo 3DS re-release Hyrule Warriors Legends showed a red-and-silver crossbow, prompting people to speculate that she would be added in this version. Linkle was officially revealed for Legends in November 2015, complete with attire similar to The Legend of Zelda series protagonist Link. While Linkle does not have any relation to Link, she was originally meant to be his sister. This was proposed by Hyrule Warriors designers at Koei Tecmo, but The Legend of Zelda franchise designer Eiji Aonuma felt that this conflicted with Link's sister Aryll in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, who was the only sister he had in the series. Linkle was designed in part to add greater diversity to the game. When asked if she would appear in future games, Aonuma remarked that they would keep her in mind. Appearances Linkle appears in the 2016 video game Hyrule Warriors Legends, an expanded port of the original Hyrule Warriors. Reception Upon her reveal, Linkle received an \\"overwhelmingly positive\\" response from fans. American fans viewed Linkle as positive representation of women, influenced by what professor Kathryn Hemmann viewed as an openly hostile industry to women, while Japanese fans were not as concerned due to a more open work environment for women. Critics were mixed on Linkle, however. Women in the World staff felt that some fans may not be receptive but that she was a \\"victory\\" for female fans of role-playing games. Jonathan Holmes of Destructoid noted that reception for her was mixed across different groups, and speculated that the success of Hyrule Warriors led her to be added in Legends, as well as speculating that Linkle was a test towards appealing to women more. Maddy Myers of The Mary Sue noted that while she \\"loves Linkle,\\" she feels that she is not enough, criticizing the fact that she was not herself Link and feeling that Linkle seemed like a \\"one-off\\" and \\"novelty\\" of Nintendo's made to sell more copies of Hyrule Warriors Legends. Thomas Whitehead of Nintendo Life found her to be a \\"clumsy introduction to a female Link,\\" but felt that she would open the door for better attempts in the future. Brian Ashcraft of Kotaku enjoyed her depiction, and appreciated that she did not boil down to just being a female Link. He expressed hope that she would appear in canon The Legend of Zelda games. Justin Towell of GamesRadar+ found her likable due to her \\"headstrong, totally oblivious-to-the-danger\\" style. Brendan Graeber of IGN suggested her as a possibility for Super Smash Bros.

It has the formula K2SO4¬∑MgSO4¬∑4H2O. The mineral was named after Leo Strippelmann, who was director of the salt works at Westeregeln in Germany. The mineral is part of the blodite group of hydrated double sulfate minerals. Properties Leonite has a bitter taste. When leonite is analyzed for elements, it is usually contaminated with sodium and chloride ions, as it commonly occurs with sodium chloride. Leonite white pseudomorphs after picromerite crystals from Potash Mine, Ro√üleben, Querfurt, Saxony-Anhalt. Leonite from Wintershall Potash Works, Heringen, Werra Valley, North Hesse. Crystal structure In the mineral family of leonite, the lattice contains sulfate tetrahedrons, a divalent element in an octahedral position surrounded by oxygen, and water and univalent metal (potassium) linking these other components together. One sulfate group is disordered at room temperature. The disordered sulfate becomes fixed in position as temperature is lowered. The crystal form also changes at lower temperatures, so two other crystalline forms of leonite exist at lower temperatures. The divalent metal cation (magnesium) is embedded in oxygen octahedra, four from water around the equator, and two from sulfate ions at the opposite poles. In the crystal there are two different octahedral environments. Each of these octahedra are joined together by potassium ions and hydrogen bonds. Phase changes The sulfate occurs in layers parallel to the (001) surface. In the room temperature form, the sequence is ODODODODOD with O=ordered, and D=disordered. In the next form at lower temperatures, the disordered sulfate appears in two different orientations giving the sequence OAOBOAOBOAOBOAOB. At the lowest temperatures, the sequence simplifies to OAOAOAOAOAO. The first phase transition happens at -4 ¬∞C. At , the crystals have space group I2/a, lattice parameters a = 11.780 √Ö, b = 9.486 √Ö, c = 19.730 √Ö, Œ≤ = 95.23¬∞, 8 formula per unit cell, and a cell volume of V = 2195.6 √Ö3. The c dimension and unit cell volume are doubled due to the presence of four sulfate layers rather than two as in the other forms. The next phase change happens at -153 ¬∞C. At , the space group is P21/a, a = 11.778 √Ö, b = 9.469 √Ö, c = 9.851 √Ö, Œ≤ = 95.26¬∞, 4 formula per unit cell, and a cell volume of V = 1094.01 √Ö3. Temperature effects As temperature increases, the cell volume gradually increases for the I2/a and C2/m phases; however, the a dimension decreases with increasing temperature. The change in a dimension is ‚àí11√ó10‚àí6 K‚àí1. Birefringence drops as temperature rises. It varies from 0.0076 at ‚àí150 ¬∞C down to 0.0067 at 0 ¬∞C and 0.0061 at 100 ¬∞C. At the lower phase transition, birefringence steps down as the temperature drops; for the upper phase transition, it is continuous but not constant. At the upper phase transition, ‚àí4 ¬∞C, latent heat is released, and the heat capacity changes. This transition has a fair bit of hysteresis. At the lower phase transition, heat capacity stays the same, but latent heat is released. Leonite starts to lose water at 130 ¬∞C, but only really breaks down at 200 ¬∞C: :K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑4H2O(s) ‚Üí K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑2H2O(s) + 2H2O(g). At even higher temperatures, langbeinite and arcanite (anhydrous potassium sulfate) and steam are all that remain: :2K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑4H2O(s) ‚Üí K2Mg2(SO4)3(s) + K2SO4(s) + 8H2O(g). Other physical properties The logarithmic solubility product Ksp for leonite is ‚àí9.562 at 25 ¬∞C. table 7 on page 716 The equilibrium constant log K at 25 ¬∞C is ‚àí3.979. The chemical potential of leonite is Œºj¬∞/RT = ‚àí1403.97. Thermodynamic properties include ŒîfGok = ‚àí3480.79 kJ mol‚àí1; ŒîfHok = ‚àí3942.55 kJ mol‚àí1; and ŒîCop,k = 191.32 J K‚àí1 mol‚àí1. The infrared spectrum of sulfate stretching modes shows peaks in absorption at 1005, 1080, 1102, 1134 and 1209 cm‚àí1. Sulfate bending mode causes a peak at 720, and lesser peaks at 750 and 840 cm‚àí1. An OH stretching mode absorbs at 3238 cm‚àí1. When temperatures reduce, the peaks move and/or narrow, and additional peaks may appear at phase transitions. When leonite is stored for exhibition, it must not be in a place with too much humidity, otherwise it hydrates more. Formation Starting in 1897, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff investigated how different salts were formed as sea water evaporated in different conditions. His purpose was to discover how salt deposits are formed. His research formed the basis for the studies of the conditions in which leonite is formed. Leonite can form when a water solution of potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate is concentrated between the temperature range of . Above this temperature range, langbeinite (K2Mg2(SO4)3) is formed. Below , picromerite (K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑6H2O) crystallises. For solutions with more than 90% proportion MgSO4, hexahydrite (MgSO4¬∑6H2O) crystallises preferentially, and below 60%, arcanite (K2SO4) forms. In mixtures of potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, magnesium chloride and magnesium sulfate at 35 ¬∞C in water, leonite can crystallise out in a certain composition range. The plot of the system forms boundaries of leonite with potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, and picromerite. As magnesium is enriched, a quadruple point with kainite exists. In salt (NaCl) saturated brine, leonite can be deposited from magnesium and potassium sulfate mixtures as low as 25 ¬∞C. The 25 ¬∞C isotherm of the system has leonite surrounded by sylvine, picromerite, astrakanite, epsomite, and kainite. Sodium chloride saturated brines are formed by seawater evaporation, though seawater does not contain enough potassium to deposite leonite this way. Leonite is precipitated in series solar ponds at the Great Salt Lake. When picromerite is heated to between 85 and 128 ¬∞C, it gives off steam to give leonite: :K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑6H2O(s) ‚Üí K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑4H2O(s) + 2H2O(g). Reactions When leonite is dissolved in nitric acid and then crystallised, an acid potassium magnesium double sulfate is formed: KHMg(SO4)2¬∑2H2O. Originally in Zeit. Anorg. Chem. 1901, 27, 442-444. Leonite heated with hydrated magnesium sulfate in an equimolar ratio at 350 ¬∞C produces langbeinite: :K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑4H2O(s) + MgSO4¬∑xH2O(s) ‚Üí K2Mg2(SO4)3(s) + (4 + x)H2O(g). Potassium chloride solution can convert leonite to solid potassium sulfate: :2KCl(aq) + K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑4H2O(s) ‚Üí 2K2SO4(s) + MgCl2(aq). More potassium sulfate can be precipitated by adding ethylene glycol. Fluorosilicic acid in water reacts with leonite to produce insoluble potassium fluorosilicate and a solution of magnesium sulfate and sulfuric acid: :H2SiF6(aq) + K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑4H2O(s) ‚Üí K2SiF6(s) + MgSO4(aq) + H2SO4(aq). Between 15 and 30 ¬∞C, a 22% magnesium chloride solution will react with leonite or picromerite to yield solid potassium chloride and hydrated magnesium sulfate. Natural occurrence Leonite can form during the dehydration of seawater or lakewater. Leonite can be a minor primary constituent of evaporite potash deposits, or a secondary mineral. In order to form leonite from seawater, the brine must separate from the deposited solids so that reactions do not happen with earlier deposited salts, and the temperature must be around 32 ¬∞C. Below 25¬∞ or above 40¬∞, the content of the brine will not be suitable to deposit leonite. At this temperature, blodite deposits first, and then leonite, constituting only 3.2% of the bittern salts. Secondary reactions can produce or consume leonite in evaporite deposits. Leonite can convert to polyhalite, and kieserite can be changed to leonite, Groundwater penetrating bittern salt deposits can convert some to leonite, particularly in the cap regions of salt domes. Leonite was first found in nature in the Stassfurt Potash deposit, Westeregeln, Egeln, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. The Stassfurt salt deposits are from the Permian period. They are under the Magdeburg-Halberstadt region in central Germany. The leonite occurs in the salt clay and carnallite beds, which are up to 50 meters thick. Other locations in Germany are the Neuhof- Ellers Potash Works in Neuhof, Fulda, Hesse; the Riedel Potash Works in Riedel-H√§nigsen, Celle, Lower Saxony; Aschersleben; Vienenburg; and Leopoldshall. Outside Germany, it is found at Vesuvius, Italy; Stebnyk, Ukraine; and the Carlsbad potash district, Eddy County, New Mexico, US. It is found in crystalline speleothems in TƒÉu≈üoare Cave in Romania; here it occurs with konyaite (K2Mg(SO4)2¬∑5H2O), syngenite (K2Ca(SO4)2¬∑H2O), thenardite (Na2SO4), and mirabilite (Na2SO4¬∑10H2O). Leonite also occurs in Wooltana Cave, Flinders Ranges, South Australia. Soil in the Gusev Crater on Mars contains leonite as well as many other hydrated sulfates. On Europa, leonite is predicted to be stable, with a vapour pressure 10‚àí13 that of ice. It is stable at pressures up to 10‚àí7, above which a more hydrated salt exists. It should form up to 2% of the salts near the surface. Weathering of potassium-rich medieval glass forms a weathering crust that can contain leonite. Use Leonite can be used directly as a fertilizer, contributing potassium and magnesium. It can be refined to K2SO4 for fertilizer use. The process to convert leonite to potassium sulfate involves mixing it with a potassium chloride (a cheaper chemical) solution. The desired product, potassium sulfate, is less soluble and is filtered off. Magnesium chloride is very soluble in water. The filtrate is concentrated by evaporation, where more leonite crystallises, which is then recycled to the start of the process, adding more langbeinite or picromerite. Leonite may have been used in an alchemical formula to make \\"potable gold\\" around 300 AD in China. This was likely to be a liquid colloid of gold. Related Leonite is isotypic with the mineral mereiterite (K2Fe(SO4)2¬∑4H2O), and with artificial Mn-leonite (K2Mn(SO4)2¬∑4H2O). Others with the same crystal structure include: : K2Cd(SO4)2¬∑4H2O : (NH4)2Mg(SO4)2¬∑4H2O : (NH4)2Mn(SO4)2¬∑4H2O : (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2¬∑4H2O : (NH4)2Co(SO4)2¬∑4H2O and : K2Mg(SeO4)2¬∑4H2O. Myron Stein suggested using the name \\"leonite\\" for element 96, naming it after the constellation Leo. This name was not accepted and curium was the name assigned.

Large-group health plans, self-insured ERISA plans, and ERISA-governed multi-employer welfare arrangements that are not subject to state insurance law are exempted from the requirement.Sara Rosenbaum, Joel Teitelbaum & Katherine Hayes, The Essential Health Benefits Provisions of the Affordable Care Act: Implications for People with Disabilities, Commonwealth Fund (March 2011).

Allowing states to define ‚Äúessential health benefits‚Äù could weaken ACA protections against catastrophic costs for people with employer coverage nationwide. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2 May 2017 Interpretation The essential health benefits are a minimum federal standard and \\"states may require that qualified health plans sold in state health insurance exchanges also cover state-mandated benefits.\\" The act gives \\"considerable discretion\\" to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to determine, through regulation, what specific services within these classes are essential. However, the Act provides certain parameters for the secretary to consider. The secretary (1) must \\"ensure that such essential health benefits reflect an appropriate balance among the categories ... so that benefits are not unduly weighted toward any category\\"; (2) may \\"not make coverage decisions, determine reimbursement rates, establish incentive programs, or design benefits in ways that discriminate against individuals because of their age, disability, or expected length of life\\"; (3) must take into account \\"the health care needs of diverse segments of the population, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and other groups\\"; and (4) must ensure that essential benefits \\"not be subject to denial to individuals against their wishes on the basis of the individuals‚Äô age or expected length of life or the individuals' present or predicted disability, degree of medical dependency, or quality of life.\\" According to a Commonwealth Fund report in 2011: Law history Coverage of essential health benefits was first required by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA or ACA), which was a major piece of health care reform legislation.Frank Lalli, The Health Care Law's 10 Essential Benefits: The Affordable Care Act ensures you'll have access to these medical and wellness services, AARP The Magazine (August/September 2013). The EHB provisions of the ACA was an amendment to the Public Health Service Act.Rosenbaum, Teitelbaum & Hayes, p. 2. Lavarreda, director of health insurance studies for the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, explained that before the ACA's passage, U.S. health insurance sector experienced \\"a race to the bottom, with insurers cutting benefits to lower premiums.\\" The establishment of essential health benefits \\"set a standard for insurance. Anything below that is not true health insurance.\\" The EHB requirement came into effect on January 1, 2014. Revision and repeal of essential health benefits coverage was proposed in the Republican part American Health Care Act of 2017. House Freedom Caucus members lobbied during legislation discussion with House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove EHBs as a condition for approval of the AHCA bill. Comparison with minimum essential coverage Essential health benefits should not be confused with minimum essential coverage (MEC). MEC is the minimum amount of coverage that an individual must carry to meet the individual health insurance mandate, while EHBs are a set of benefits that qualified health plans (QHPs) must offer.Susan Grassli & Lisa Klinger, Understanding the Difference between Minimum Essential Coverage, Essential Health Benefits, Minimum Value, and Actuarial Value, Leavitt Group (January 27, 2014). MEC is a low threshold; many forms of coverage that do not provide essential health benefits are nevertheless considered minimum essential coverage.

It is based on the short story \\"Across the Aisle\\" by W. R. Burnett. The film was released on July 24, 1936, by 20th Century Fox. Plot Duke and Jeanie Benson, an outlaw couple hiding out under assumed names in a calm, suburban community, read a newspaper article about a sweepstakes winner who has not yet claimed his prize. Duke realizes that he has the winning ticket and will win $150,000 if he can cash it in without getting apprehended. Fed up with suburban life, Duke decides to board a train to Kansas City, where he bought the ticket, while Jeanie plans to fly there and get a \\"stooge\\" to cash in the ticket. At the train station, reporter Frank Evers boards the train and starts a conversation with Duke, who calls himself \\"Downey.\\" At San Bernardino, Anne Marvis boards the train, followed by Doyle, a process server. Finding the door to Duke's room open, Anne hides in his bed, and when Duke sees Doyle enter in pursuit, he pulls a gun on Doyle, who says that he mistook Duke's \\"wife\\" for the woman he was after. Duke is attracted to Anne, as is Frank. When Jeanie gets on the train because her plane was grounded, she suspects that Duke and Anne are having an affair and pulls a gun on them; however, Duke calms her fears by introducing Frank as Anne's husband. Anne and Frank go along with the ruse. Sometime later, Frank accompanies the conductor to a room next to Duke's, where they listen through a surveillance device to Duke and Jeanie bicker about their plans to have the \\"boys\\" meet him in Kansas City. Frank, in reality a G-man, hopes to nab the whole gang and decides to hold off arresting Duke. After Jeanie gets off the train at Albuquerque to board a plane to Kansas City, Duke tries to flirt with Anne, but she rejects his advances. That night, Frank and Anne agree to be honest with each other, and Anne reveals that she is really a Los Angeles reporter and has been subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury concerning a political scandal which she had unearthed. She says that she felt it would be \\"healthier\\" to go out-of-state for a while. When Frank continues to claim that he is a reporter for The Telegraph, Anne indignantly reveals that she works for the paper and knows that he does not. In Topeka, after Flash, a porter, inadvertently finds the listening device in Duke's room, Duke knocks out the conductor. Anne receives a wire that it is all right for her to return to Los Angeles and gets off the train. When Duke sees Frank pursuing him, he gets into Anne's cab. They go to Borden's Sanitarium, where Duke meets Jeanie, who is unhappy to see him with Anne. When Duke reads in a newspaper that another man has surfaced to claim the lottery prize, he sends his shyster lawyer Rickert to dispute the claim to the insurance company that handles the contest. While Rickert is away, Duke kisses Anne and asks her to leave with him after he collects the money. Anne agrees, but he locks her in her room anyway. Jeanie then unbolts the shutters of Anne's room to help her escape, and Anne hitches a ride on a truck, but the driver works for Duke's gang and brings her back to the sanitarium. Upon deducing that Jeanie let Anne out, Duke slugs Jeanie. Frank, impersonating an insurance agent, accompanies Rickert to the sanitarium. Duke shoots Frank as a carload of G-men arrive and then unlocks Anne's door to take her with him, but Jeanie shoots him and then cries over his body. The gang is captured, and Anne is pleased to see that Frank is only wounded. On the train to Los Angeles, Flash comments that Frank and Anne have not come out of their cabin in two days. They kiss and it is revealed that they have recently married.

Design and development The PAP series was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules as well as European regulations. It features a paraglider-style wing, single-place or two-place-in-tandem accommodation and a single engine in pusher configuration with a reduction drive and a two-bladed wooden propeller. The engines, drive and propeller varies by model. The PAP series was noted for attention to detail and in particular for having the reserve parachute built into the frame structure. The cage structure can be broken down into two, three or four sections for ground transport. As is the case with all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot. Inflight steering is accomplished via handles that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw.

The canal was constructed by the British in 1802 and completed in 1804. It was designed to drain salt water out of the Muthurajawela wetlands. The canal was named after Gavin Hamilton, the Government Agent of Revenue and Commerce. History=Early history The first mention of the canals along the western seaboard of Sri Lanka was in the 8th century, when the Persian geographer, Abu Zayd al-Balkhi reported a voyage lasting weeks along the 'Gobbs of Serendib', the Arabian term for the linked lagoons along the coast. Six centuries later the King of Kotte, Veera Parakramabahu VIII (1477‚Äì1496), had a network of canals constructed connecting outlying villages with Colombo and Negombo Lagoon so that produce such as arecanuts, cloves, cardamom, pepper and cinnamon, could be more easily transported to the kingdom‚Äôs main seaport at Negombo. Middle history In 1613 a Portuguese missionary, Father Manoel Barradas, describes how \\"Near Columbo the Fathers embarked on a canal by which they entered into the River Calane [Kelani Ganga], and going down the river they proceeded into another canal as narrow as shady, so that the oars, although they were very short, could scarcely fulfil their office\\". \\"By this they went as far as Negumbo, which is six Chingala leagues.\\" In the 17th century the Portuguese constructed a canal from Hendala to Pamunugama. The Dutch established the centre of their colony at Colombo. They then attempted to grow paddy rice in the surrounding marshes in Muthurajawela, but found that‚Äîas the previous Sinhalese kings had before them‚Äîthe coastal tides inundated the fields with sea water. Around the 18th century, the Dutch commenced the construction of a series of structures, dams and canals using and enhancing the original system of waterways in an attempt to drain the salt water from the rice fields and to transport cinnamon in barges through to the seaport at Negombo. This system, known as the 'Dutch Canal', formed a \\"continuous line of waterways between ports and the remote sections of territory under the Dutch\\". Later history In 1796 the British took control of the island and in 1802 a new Colombo-Negombo canal was built, conceived by George Atkinson, the Colonial Surveyor General and supported by Gavin Hamilton (1494‚Äì1803), the Government Agent of Revenue and Commerce. The Hamilton Canal, as it became known, ran parallel and west of the old Dutch Canal, closer to the sea, from the mouth of the Kelani Ganga at Hekitta to the southern edge of the Negombo Lagoon at Pamunugama, a distance of 14.5 km. Hamilton had accompanied Frederick North (first British Governor of Ceylon 1798‚Äì1805) to Ceylon in 1798, where he became the private secretary to Hugh Cleghorn, Colonial Secretary of Ceylon. He subsequently became the private secretary to Governor North. In April 1799 Hamilton was appointed Acting Civil Paymaster and in 1802 the Deputy Paymaster General. He succeeded Joseph Greenhill as Agent of Revenue and Commerce for the District of Colombo. Hamilton died in February 1803 prior to the completion of the canal in 1804. After his death he was found to have embezzled ¬£19,675. The canal was designed to connect the original Dutch canal by a series of parallel waterways in order to drain the already damaged Muthurajawela but created the opposite effect, as the coastal tides brought increasing salinity not only from Negombo Lagoon but also the Kelani Ganga. 21st century restoration In 2012 the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation commenced work rehabilitating and restoring the canal. The first stage was a stretch between Maha Oya and Negombo. The second phase of the works between the Kelani Ganga and Negombo commenced on 20 February 2013. The first section, between the Hekiththa junction and Pinwatta was completed on 2 August 2013 at a cost of Rs. 400 million with financial assistance from the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation.

Emergency eyewash and safety shower stations serve the purpose of reducing workplace injury and keeping workers away from various dangers.  Types  There are several types of emergency eyewash station and safety shower station systems, including safety showers, eyewash stations, drench hoses, combination units, and eyewash bottles.  Safety Shower  Picture of Emergency eyewash and shower A safety shower is a unit designed to wash an individual's head and body which has come into contact with hazardous chemicals. Large volumes of water are used and a user may need to take off any clothing that has been contaminated with hazardous chemicals. Safety showers cannot be used for flushing an individual's eyes, due to the high pressure of water from the shower, which can damage a user's eyes. How to use Emergency Shower. How to use Emergency Shower.  Eyewash Station  An eyewash station is a unit for washing chemicals or substances that might splash into an individual's eyes before he or she can seek further medical attention. The user needs to wash their eyes for at least 15 minutes. How to use Emergency Eye wash.  Drench Hose  A drench hose is an equipment that can spray water to a specific spot of the chemical exposure on individual's body. The benefit of a drench hose is that it can be applied to an individual who cannot reach a normal eyewash or shower station or in the case where the eyewash and shower station are unavailable.  Combination Unit  A combination unit is where other units such as a shower station, eyewash station, and drench hose share the same water supply plumbing. This unit is useful in laboratory where hazardous chemicals with different properties are used.  Eyewash Bottle  Also known as a personal eyewash unit, it is a supplementary for eyewash stations. However, eyewash stations cannot be replaced by eyewash bottles since they do not meet safety standards. Eyewash bottles allow an individual to flush the injured area immediately, or until the individual can reach the fixed eyewash station. Early eyewashes were designed with a single rinsing stream, but recent advancements have made eyewashes capable of flushing both eyes simultaneously. A pH neutral solution for emergency eyewash may also be chosen to reduce the danger from contaminants if strong acids or alkali chemicals are presented. Specification and requirement In the United States, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations on emergency eyewash and shower station are contained in 29 C.F.R. 1910.151 (c), which provides that \\"Where the eyes or body of any person may be exposed to injurious corrosive materials, suitable facilities for quick drenching or flushing of the eyes and body shall be provided within the work area for immediate emergency use.\\" However, OSHA regulation is unclear defining what facility is required. From this reason, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has developed a standard (ANSI/ISEA Z358.1-2014) for emergency eyewash and shower stations, including the design of such stations.

She is a being who reputedly roams the jungle of Sabah at night or at dawning in the guise of a little girl. A wailing laughter has been reported.  Origins The night of the incident, a little girl and her parents were sleeping in their hammocks. It was obvious how the cobra entered the vicinity, as there was an outlet in the ceiling that was left unclosed after maintenance. The cobra was able to slither up into the ventilation system, which led to the sleeping area. This let the cobra loose, where it came across three defenseless humans sleeping. The odd series of events that must have occurred in order to arrive at the conclusion of the snake killing the parents but the little girl remained unseen which has left many baffled by the incident. Many questions and skepticisms arose from this event. Despite extensive searching by the local police force, no traces of the little girl had ever been found. It soon arose that the little girl survived but lost her sanity. She became known as the ‚ÄòGuardian‚Äô of the jungle. However, as locals have been the only source, there is little evidence exterior to this whether this claim is credible or not, after all, no traces, of the girl had been found.  Snakes Of the snakes the ‚ÄòGuardian‚Äô commands, vipers and cobras are the most famous among them, but you should fear the banded sea krait or yellow-lipped sea krait (Laticauda colubrine) the most, because one drop of its venom can kill three adults and there is no antidote. They are commonly found in rivers in rainforests as well as tropical coasts. Sea snakes are trapped in the fishing nets occasionally. When an unfortunate fisherman is busy sorting out the fishes, he might be bitten by sea snake without knowing it, due to the anesthetic effect of the venom. The poison dissolves the muscles of the body and his urine will turn into cola red color. At last, he dies in enormous suffering. Sea/River snakes are common in sabah and they are frequently seen around Rangalau Kiulu.  First Victim  Two Australian snake hunters hiking in the Sabah area, specifically the Kiulu Valley near the river, were searching for an exotic and undocumented species of snake when they were allegedly attacked by the Guardian of the jungle, commanding vipers to bite them. The local guides that were with them had specifically warned of the threat of the vipers commanded by the ‚ÄòGuardian‚Äô and laid down rules. Foreigners must address the guides as ‚ÄúBrother‚Äù or ‚ÄúSister‚Äù as to not reveal their true identity to the ‚ÄòGuardian‚Äô. One hunter, with a slip of tongue, yelled out the guides name when he first saw the brood of vipers approaching. That hunter allegedly died, while the other managed to escape. The hunter‚Äôs body was never found, and was suspected to be taken away by the snakes. This prompted action from local authorities in a search and rescue effort, however, no body was recovered. Two weeks after the incident, the guide whose identity was exposed, was found dead with fangs in his wrist.  Possible Prevention While the ‚ÄòGuardian‚Äô of the jungle‚Äôs existence is debatable, locals vehemently stick to this folklore, citing eyewitness accounts and personal experiences. There are many options for warding off snakes, particularly the sea/river snake mentioned previously. It is common knowledge amongst the local indigenous and bushmen of the area that the colour orange is particularly effective in staving away the reptilian threat. Furthermore, locals claim that the scent of garlic or raw onion is effective in discouraging snakes from approaching certain areas. With multiple studies done in and around the area, it was found that snakes avoid natural strong scents such as garlic and onions. See also *Malay folklore *Malay ghost myths References # Kiulu Kini.

The second feature film of Russian director Pavel Lungin, it depicts the story of a young antisemitic skinhead leader, Andrei Leonov (Andrei Gutin) who is forced to come to terms with the discovery that his father, Naoum Kheifitz (Oleg Borisov) is of Jewish ancestry. The film, of the chernukha (Russian: —á–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ö–∞, roughly \\"black stuff\\") genre, follows Andrei as he explores his heritage and the relationship he begins with his father. Luna Park was shown at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on , and was released in New York in January 1994. It was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. The composer Isaak Schwarz won a Nika Award from the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences for the film's music. Plot Set in a post-perestroika, post-Soviet Moscow, Luna Park follows the main character Andrei Leonov (Andrei Gutin) in his struggles to figure out who he is. At the beginning of the film, we see him as a young antisemitic skinhead bodybuilding leader of a group called \\"The Cleaners\\" who are set on purging Russia of anyone they deem unsuitable to the Russian bloodline, including, Jews, homosexuals, foreigners and mentally challenged individuals. The opening scene depicts a crowd of skinheads waving Russian flags and fighting a gang of bikers who they believed have succumbed to western influence and ideology. \\"The Cleaners\\" live in Luna Park, an amusement park, with wild roller coasters, and distorting mirrors and regularly head out into Moscow to cause chaos and destruction. Having originally believed that his father was a Soviet war hero who died in a military plane crash in Afghanistan, he worships his father as the ideal Russian and strives to emulate him. When during a drunken night of confessions, he discovers that his father is actually a Jewish musician and still alive in Moscow, Andrei's life is turned upside-down, partly out of revulsion from whom he is descended, and partly because he wants to know (and be) with his father, and he must someway reconcile himself with this with discovery. Andrei's initial reaction of shock is furthered by his mother Aliona (Natalya Yegorova), who demands he kill his father for the pain that he caused her, when at a young age, his father seduced her (making her pregnant) and then did not cast her as a singer for an important role, which blighted her career after that. As the movie progresses, Andrei's quest for his father is successful, and we are introduced to Naoum Kheifitz (Oleg Borisov), a once- influential Jewish composer and conductor who is now forced to make a living as an entertainer at private parties. Having spent time with his father, and seeing him as a charming, personable, yet impoverished gentle man, Andrei begins to overcome his hatred for Jewish culture. His father accepts Andrei and dismisses his anti-Semitism, and proudly shows him off to his eccentric friends. This leads to a gradual change of Andrei's perspective, and he attempts to explain the situation to the members of his gang. They are not as accepting of his father, or of Andrei's Jewish roots, and they ransack Naoum's apartment, hang a young woman they find there, and abduct Naoum, taking him back to Luna Park. Andrei returns to the apartment and is horrified at the sight. He rushes to the park and saves his father, meanwhile the park catches fire, and Aliona chooses to perish with the park then face the reality of Andrei's choice. The movie concludes with a scene of Andrei and Naoum getting on a train that's traveling to Siberia, under the assumption that they will start a new life together, free from the influence of the gang or the city. Cast * Oleg Borisov as Naoum Kheifitz * Andrei Gutin as Andrei Leonov * Natalya Yegorova as Aliona * Nonna Mordyukova as Aunt * Mikhail Golubovich as Mute Guy * Aleksandr Feklistov as Boris Ivanovich * Tatyana Lebedkova as Prostitute * Aleksandr Savin as Saniok Themes Luna Park is a member of the short lived Russian film genre chernukha, which deals with the everyday realities that people faced at the end of the Soviet rule, but also shortly after, as Russia struggled to create a new identity. Very much a movie about the post-Soviet struggle for a new identity, the violence portrayed by the gang is used to highlight the un-ease felt by the general population at the time. Dealing with the issues of anti-semitism and attitudes towards minorities in Russia at the time, Luna Park relies heavily on showcasing the nation as it actually was, and Pavel Lungin uses a setting of darkness and showcasing the drabness of actual life to illustrate the misery of the everyday person. The cramped, often hectic apartment of Naoum Kheifitz (Oleg Borisov) is an excellent example showing some of the living conditions people were faced with at the end of the Soviet period. Release Luna Park was originally released in Russia on , and shown at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on . It was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in . Reception Luna Park received mediocre reviews from North American film critics. Janet Maslin from The New York Times noted it as being \\"murky and jumbled\\" and John Griffin of The Montreal Gazette claimed it was a \\"long - too long- strange trip\\" into the way of post-Soviet Russian life.

It was designed by Steve Hales, who previously wrote Slime and Fort Apocalypse for Synapse. Dimension X is a vehicle-based, first person shooter with similar gameplay to Atari's Battlezone and Novagen's Encounter (the latter of which was distributed in the US by Synapse). The manual includes instructions for a Commodore 64 version of the game, but it was never completed nor released. The game was advertised far in advance of its release. Magazine ads emphasized features which did not exist or were not as impressive in the final game which contributed to a negative reception. Gameplay The game is played from a first person perspective, where the player sits inside the cockpit of a flying vehicle and fires missiles at \\"Regillian\\" enemies. Many elements of Dimension X have analogs in Star Raiders. The game world consists of a 5x5 grid of sectors which need to be cleared of Regillians. In Star Raiders the enemies attempt to surround and destroy sectors containing motherships; here the Regillians attempt to surround and destroy a sector containing the capitol. Various systems of the player's ship can be damaged by enemy fire, such as the scanner and map. Moving between sectors requires holding a crosshair steady in addition to moving over and under obstacles. Development Dimension X was advertised over nine months before being available, the ads featuring what appeared to be a texture-mapped ground plane using a technique promoted as \\"altered perspective scrolling.\\" The printed ad also showed a 64 sector map on its own screen, which was not in the final game. In Halcyon Days: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Game Programmers, designer Steve Hales said: When the game was eventually released, it was met with generally poor reviews. Reception In a new product overview in ANALOG Computing, Lee H. Pappas wrote: \\"The only outstanding feature of the game is the scroll-in-any- direction moire pattern landscape.\\" In the review in the same issue, Robert T. Martin concluded it was \\"disappointing,\\" and also criticized the box art for showing features that don't exist in the game, such as tanks and spaceships.

The tower is the only circular brick water-tower in Queensland and was designed by James Baillie Henderson and built from 1901 to 1902. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The East Bundaberg Water Tower was erected for the Bundaberg Municipal Council in 1901-1902 to provide suitable water pressure as part of Bundaberg's new reticulated water system. The Burnett area was first settled by Europeans as a series of pastoral runs in the 1840s and 50s. In the late 1860s, as good agricultural land around Maryborough began to be scarce, agriculturalists and timbergetters became interested in land on the navigable Burnett River to the north. The foundation settlers of Bundaberg selected land in 1867-68 under the \\"Sugar and Coffee Regulations\\" stemming from the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1860s which aimed to promote agriculture and closer settlement. The site of Bundaberg was officially surveyed in 1869. Coastal traffic grew, and copper was first mined at Mt Perry in 1871, which enabled Bundaberg to develop as a port and supply centre, in spite of competition from Maryborough for this trade. Although the higher southern bank of the river was officially surveyed as the town site, both sides soon developed wharves and buildings and were initially linked by ferry. In the 1870s the first bridges were built, as ferries could no longer cope with increasing traffic across the river. It was in the 1880s, however, with the successful establishment of the sugar industry in the region, that Bundaberg boomed. Handsome and substantial masonry buildings began to rise in the town as evidence of its growing importance and prosperity. Important civic works were also carried out such as the installation of gas street lighting and the sealing of major roads with asphalt. It was in this period of civic development that the Bundaberg Municipal Council considered the provision of a reticulated water supply. Bundaberg's water supply was initially derived from a series of water holes and lagoons around the settlement. By the 1880s, as the town developed, the provision of a reticulated water supply became important, not only for domestic use, but to allow road sprinkling to keep down dust and to make it possible to fight fires, a major cause of destruction where timber buildings crowded commercial areas. The colonial government in September 1887 gazetted loan conditions for a reticulated town water system for Bundaberg. A scheme to bring water from the dam on the permanent lagoon at Baldwin Swamp in East Bundaberg to a storage reservoir at Tantitha Park, utilizing an elevated tank to improve water pressure, was presented to the council by Councillor W H McCann. His scheme formed the basis of plans prepared in 1889 by W C Clements, a hydraulic engineer based in Rockhampton. The plans were submitted to Brisbane for government appraisal. The government engineer, J B Henderson, thought them unsuitable. Amongst other suggestions for improvement he recommended a brick water tower rather than the simple elevated tank proposed. An amended proposal was drawn up which followed this suggestion but did not go ahead. In April 1896, Henderson travelled to Bundaberg and met the Mayor and Councillors to discuss the water supply and appears to have been asked by them to take on the work. James Baillie Henderson was born in London in 1836 and trained as an engineer in Scotland. He arrived in Victoria in 1861 and worked on the Coliban water scheme and the water supply system for Bendigo. Moving to Queensland in 1878, he became resident engineer of northern waterworks and in 1883 took up the new position of government hydraulic engineer. He travelled widely in Queensland and was instrumental in the discovery and exploitation of artesian water. He instituted Queensland's first flood warning system and retired in Brisbane in 1916. In October 1898 a detailed proposal was supplied to the Council costed at plus working expenses. The Council then applied for a loan of which was secured in the Parliamentary estimates for 1899-1900. Tenders were called for the pipes in September 1899 and for the tower in December of that year, but were not accepted for either job because the costs of labour and materials had risen. The Council consequently obtained a further loan and accepted a tender from local contractor Neils Carl Steffensen at a cost of . Steffensen began work on the tower in April 1900 although his work was delayed by difficulties in sourcing suitable bricks. In order to obtain the quality and uniformity necessary for this project, bricks were obtained from Virginia brickworks in Brisbane. The tower was completed in 1902 and was considered a masterpiece of brickwork. The Bundaberg Foundry made the tank, pipes and fittings. The system brought water from the Baldwin Swamp utilizing a steam pump located in a pump house near the edge of the swamp. It was pumped up the tower to the holding tank, the height of which provided pressure by gravity. Water was supplied to the major sections of the town by pipes and hydrants were constructed in the main street in 1902. Locating an underground water source solved problems with the quality of the water initially obtained from an open waterhole at the swamp. A large well supplied by 4 bores was constructed and by 1907, daily were being supplied. Subsequently, other water towers were built around Bundaberg, although the east tower remains the most striking in appearance. Because of the flat nature of the terrain, the tower is a landmark and in its early years, people climbed the tower to obtain views of the area. There are also local stories of children playing racing games up and down its staircase. Proof of this unofficial public use remains in the form of graffiti scratched on the interior walls of the tower. These date from the early 1920s until the latter half of the 20th century. The tank remains a water storage facility, but has been roofed and was recently lined with concrete.  Description  The East Bundaberg Water Tower is a cylindrical brick tower topped by a steel tank and is situated on an open grassed area at the corner of Sussex and Princes Streets. It is constructed of red-brown glazed bricks which are tuck pointed and set on concrete footings with an in situ concrete slab. The tower supports a circular steel water tank and is high with a diameter of at the base. The walls of the tower taper from a thickness of at the base, to at the top of the structure. There is a ground level entrance on the north/south axis. The tower has 8 storeys, each being indicated by a band of projecting bricks and has four windows with round- headed arches interspersed with four blind windows of the same form at each level. The steel tank on the top of the tower is circular with a dished base and is approximately deep. It rests on a sandstone plinth. There is a timber framed access walkway with a handrail around the base of the tank. The interior has timber floors supported by timber framing and linked by a timber staircase, which runs around the exterior walls of the tower. The interior is plastered and has timber framed doors and windows with sandstone sills. The tower is surrounded by lawn. There are perimeter plantings to adjacent blocks but no fence.  Heritage listing  East Bundaberg Water Tower was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The East Bundaberg Water Tower was a key element in Bundaberg's first reticulated water system, constructed in the early 1900s. It marks an important stage in the development of the city's infrastructure and helps to illustrate the development of Bundaberg as a major regional city serving one of Queensland's most significant sugar-growing regions. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is the only circular brick water tower known in Queensland and is a good and intact example of a late 19th century technology, being designed to increase water pressure to allow a reticulated water supply system to operate effectively in a very flat terrain. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is the only circular brick water tower known in Queensland and is a good and intact example of a late 19th century technology, being designed to increase water pressure to allow a reticulated water supply system to operate effectively in a very flat terrain. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The East Bundaberg Water Tower is a well-executed and distinctive structure that has a strong visual presence in a flat and open townscape. Its design transcends the purely functional and the tower appears to have been intended as a pleasing element in the landscape. The exterior suggests a Renaissance influence in its use of arched actual and blind windows encircling each floor level. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The water tower has a strong connection with the life and work of James Baillie Henderson, the first government hydraulic engineer in Queensland.

It spreads across three southern provinces: Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, and Trang. It was established on May 27, 1982. It is known for its diverse ecosystem and wide range of wildlife; consisting of 162 animal species. It was named by local people \\"Bha Brommajan\\" which means \\"the forest of virginity\\".Department of National Park Thailand. (2009). Khao-Pu Khao Ya. Retrieved September 14, 2015 from http://park.dnp.go.th/visitor/nationparkshow.php?PTA_CODE=1042  History  Khao Ya, and especially Khao Pu, are considered to be holy places in Phatthalung Province. People believe that Khao Pu is the place where Ta Pu spirit lives. Ta Pu is half-human, half-Gandharvas (god of music). People often visit to ask him for his blessing. Ta Pu symbolizes goodness and purity. Every year people gather to participate in a ceremony worshipping Ta Pu and their ancestors. Around April to May people annually participate in \\"wan wang\\" which means \\"free day\\". Usually held for three days, over this period people cease all kind of activities. This traditional ceremony is very similar to Songkran (Thai New Year). In this ceremony, however, not only laypersons can participate, but monks are also allowed to join. People will gently pour and sprinkle water on statues of Buddha first, then on monks and elders. Nobody is allowed to play before the ablution. Every evening of each day there is local folk storytelling, dancing, and games. Around September to October annually people participate in \\"Ching Pretah Day\\" which is a giving day to ancestor spirits, ghosts, and demons. On this day people will bring desserts such as kanom la, kanom ba, kanom pong, kanom thian, and kanom bae-som (also called joah hu) to the ceremony. They also bring rice, garlic, shrimp paste, chili, coconuts, sugar cane, salt, onions, bananas, candles, and joss-sticks. Then they will set up a table. After the prayer people gather around the table and snatch (it is a tradition, people do it just for fun) food for themselves, believing that it will bring them good luck. Every dessert offered to the spirits represents a particular object. Kanom la is a blanket, kanom ba is a coin, kanom pong is jewelry, kanom bae-som is money, and kanom thian is a pillow.  Geography  The park lies in the Nakhon Si Thammarat Range or Banthat mountain range. Hin Tan Hill is the highest peak of the park at 877 meters above sea level. Approximately 60 percent of the park is covered with tropical rain forest and some areas of the park are covered with evergreen forest. Khao Banthat Wildlife Sanctuary is beside Khao Pu Khao Ya National Park. The center of the park is considered to be the demarcation line, separating Trang and Phatthalung Provinces. The dividing line is a brook, the water source for people who live in both provinces. Khao Pu Khao Ya in Phatthalung Province is the water source of the La Mai, Mai Siab, and Cha-Uat canals which unite with the Pak Panang River. On the other side, in Trang province, Khao Pu Khao Ya is the water source of Lamphu Ra and Lamor canals which join the Trang River.  Climate  A parade of the local people in Phatthalung Province, celebrating the \\"Ching Pretah\\" ceremony Traditional desserts decorated in trays The average temperature of the park is around 20-35 degrees Celsius. The rainy season is around May and December and the precipitation is 1,600-2,500 mL per year.  Flora and fauna Khao Pu Khao Ya National Park contains various animal species. About 60 species of mammals are found here. Some are endangered: palm civet, ground beetle, serow, and yellow- throated marten. Sixty-seven species of reptiles live in the park: blue-winged flying lizard, equatorial spitting cobra, southern curved-toed gecko, roughneck monitor lizard, and cave-dwelling snake. Seventy species of insects are found: Troides amphrysus (butterfly), giant red bug and the Malayan jungleglory (butterfly). Various birds live in the park: blacked-headed Bulbul, oriental dwarf kingfisher, and puff backed Bulbul. In Khao Pu Khao Ya National Park, mammals are rarely seen. Some are found in particular areas. Most of the animals are endangered species and they are under the protection of the Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act.

It depicts the twin sisters Helena (1895-1964) and Geertruida Wehmann (1895-1975), models at the Amsterdam fashion house in the Leidseplein whose professional names were Ippy and Gertie respectively. Isra√´ls was introduced to the house by his childhood friend and portrait painter Th√©r√®se Schwartze. He went on to portray the whole range of the world of haute couture, both in Amsterdam and Paris. His treatment is realist rather than glamorous, portraying seamstresses as well as their wealthy clients. Hirsch & Cie in Amsterdam continued until 1943, when it was forced to close as part of the Nazi policy of dispossessing Jews of their property during the occupation of the Netherlands. It re-opened in 1948 after the war and continued until 1976 when it finally closed its doors. The premises are now occupied by an Apple Store.  Isra√´ls and Hirsch & Cie  Jewish Historical Museum, Amsterdam. Christie's lot notes for its November 2012 sale of this painting observes that Isaac Isra√´ls is the painter of modern life in fin-de-si√®cle Netherlands. Isaac was the son of Jozef Isra√´ls, the noted Hague School painter revered by Vincent van Gogh. Following some early training at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, where he met George Hendrik Breitner (the two are credited as founding the so-called school of Amsterdam Impressionism), Isaac followed the examples of Johannes Bosboom and van Gogh and spent time in the Borinage, the Belgian mining district. Although Breitner sketched with van Gogh in their student days at The Hague (Breitner was later dismissive of Vincent's \\"eskimo paintings\\", while Vincent in turn dismissed Breitner's efforts as \\"mouldy wallpaper\\"), there is no record of Isra√´ls ever meeting van Gogh.Letter to Johanna van der Weele (wife of Herman), 25 December 1892, cited by P.H. Hefting, ‚ÄòBrieven van G.H. Breitner aan H.J. van der Weele‚Äô, in 19de eeuwse Nederlandse schilderkunst. Een zestal studies, Haarlem 1977 (Nederlands Kunsthistorisch Jaarboek vol. 27 [1976]), pp. 148-149 He did however see a selection of Vincent's paintings at Theo van Gogh's art dealership while in Paris in 1889. Isra√´ls moved to Amsterdam in 1887 and together with Breitner enrolled at the National Academy. Both of them quickly abandoned the academy and Isra√´ls set up on his own, initially following Breitner in favouring street scenes and night life. However the two fell out and Isaac began to shift his attention to the fashionable aspects of big city life, especially the London and Paris he was familiar with from an early age as a result of his travels with his cosmopolitan father. Around 1900, his childhood friend Th√©r√®se Schwartze introduced him to the fashion house in the Leidseplein, Amsterdam. This concern of Belgian origin had begun 1881 as a conscious effort to introduce French haute couture to The Netherlands, and by 1900 had developed into one of the leading fashion houses in Europe. Isra√´ls was given access to the fashions shows, as well as allowed behind the scenes in the fitting rooms and sewing ateliers, thus acquiring for himself a reputation not only as a painter of city life, but also of high fashion. He followed his father's realist traditions and avoided glamorous portrayals of the world of fashion, portraying seamstresses as well as the wealthy clients they served. Generally he depicted his subjects in grey and brown tones, reserving colour for accents and details such as cherry lips and blushing cheeks. This article's painting is unusual in that the two dresses contrast strongly, although the dark sand-coloured background is typical of his other work in the genre. Isra√´ls moved to Paris in 1903 and remained there until the outbreak of World War I. He continued his studies of the world of fashion at the fashion houses Paquin and . He spent the first two years of the war in London, returning to Amsterdam in 1917. He then worked primarily as a portrait painter, notably of Mata Hari and Jo Bonger (Theo van Gogh's widow). He continued to record life at Hirsch & Cie. His favourite models at this time were the Wehmann twins, Ippy and Gertie.  \\"Ippy en Gertie\\"  Ippy and Gertie were born 29 June 1895. At the age of sixteen, they were sent to London by their parents to broaden their education and to learn English. There their modelling talent was discovered and they went to work at the very fashionable Maison Lucile at 24 Burlington Street, whose clients included aristocracy, royalty, and theatre celebrities. Maison Lucile was founded by Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, who is credited as training the first professional models (mannequins as they were then called)1902 Pall Mall Mag. XXVII. 119 Another salon ornamented with tall mirrors in which were reflected the slender elegant figures of several mannequins, most of them exceedingly pretty and all arrayed in magnificent dresses. and for inventing the catwalk. Duff-Gordon expanded her business to Paris, New York and Chicago. Ippy and Gertie spent some time in Paris as well. Gertie got engaged to a French count while in Paris, but he was killed at the beginning of the war. The twins returned to Amsterdam and during the period 1916-1918 rose to ascendancy in the Amsterdam modelling world. It was as this time that Isra√´ls made his many portraits of the twins. The twins are said to have subsequently gained a minor role in a 1920 film starring Gloria Swanson, following which they quickly faded from view. They married and later lived in the Pieter Aertzstraat in the De Pijp district of Amsterdam. Ippy died of a stroke in 1964, Gertie in 1975.

It was described in 2014 based on specimens from the Tam ƒê·∫£o National Park in Vietnam, hence, the specific name tamdaoensis. It was described by Joachim Bresseel and J√©r√¥me Constant, biologists of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS). In the same paper they also reported the discovery of another new subspecies, Phryganistria heusii yentuensis, which ‚Äì measuring 32 cm long ‚Äì is the second biggest insect known to date. In contrast, P. tamdaoensis, measuring only 23 cm long, is one of the smallest species under giant sticks. In 2015, the International Institute for Species Exploration names it as one of the \\"Top 10 New Species\\" for new species discovered in 2014. They were included in the list because of their body shape and colour, making them \\"masters of camouflage\\". Discovery The first specimens were collected in August 2010 by J. Constant and P. Limbourg, both of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, from Tam ƒê·∫£o National Park in northwestern Vietnam. Since then more specimens were collected every year from different localities, including the Da Krong Nature Reserve and Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve. However, they are so far only seen within central and north Vietnam. It was described as new species of stick insect in 2014 in the journal European Journal of Taxonomy. Description Adult female (top), nymph (centre), and eggs (bottom). Phryganistria tamdaoensis can be identified from other species of Phryganistria from the presence of cerci (the last paired appendages in the abdomen), which are comparatively flattened. These structures are particularly enlarged and elongated in females, which are not so in other species. The body measures 23 cm long (54 cm if its appendages are stretched out), and 9.3 cm broad at its widest region. The subapical spine on the outer ventral carinae of meso- and meta-femora in male is less conspicuous than in other species. The body surface is smooth and shiny. Another diagnostic feature in males is unique colour pattern. The head, anterior and posterior regions are golden-brown. Unlike other species, the colour is a glossy bluish-green on the neck mid-body (mesonotum) and yellow-brown on anterior legs (which are typically black in other species). The margin of the mesonotum is lined in black. The femora is carinae blue, while the spines black. Tibiae and tarsomeres are pinkish-brown. Females are light brown to dull green. The neck region is light bluish-green. The eggs are golden-brown, and shaped like an oval bullet with a terminal button (operculum and capitalum). The egg is 5.2 mm long, 2.7 mm wide, and 3.7 mm high. The newly hatched nymphs are green in colour, and measure 20‚Äì25 mm long. The mid-body region is darker with spots of white marks.

History  Scobey MT border station as seen in 1937 The US Customs Service established this crossing as a port of entry in 1914, at the peak of the homesteading in this area. The US first built an inspection station at the border in 1937. That red brick roadside border station was replaced by a wooden structure in the median in 1978, and that facility was replaced by a multi-lane border station in 2012.

Biometric System  Traveler using the speaker recognition system to enter the US at Scobey Montana in 1996 In 1996, this border crossing became the world's first fully automated port of entry, using biometrics to confirm the identity of travelers. The US and Canadian governments engaged in a cooperative prototype project to enable certain trusted individuals with nothing to declare to cross the border in either direction after the port had closed for the night. Local residents who were enrolled could use a speaker recognition system to open the gates and enter the country without inspection.

These components include a sense of continuity over time, emotional commitment to representations of self, role relationships, core values and self-standards, development of a meaningful world view, and recognition of one's place in the world.Westen, D. (1985). Self and society: Narcissism, collectivism, and the development of morals. New York: Cambridge University Press.Westin, D. (1992). The cognitive self and the psychoanalytic self: Can we put our selves together? Psychological Inquiry, 3(1), 1-13. It appears to be linked to emotional dysregulation, which has been shown to be a significant predictor of identity disturbance in psychiatric patients even when controlling for borderline personality disorder diagnosis, depression, and anxiety.Neacsiu, A. D., Herr N. R., Fang C. M., Rodriguez M. A., Rosenthal M. Z. (2015). Identity disturbance and problems with emotion regulation are related constructs across diagnoses. Journal of Clinical Psychology, 71(4), 346-361. Although some researchers posit that it is the lack of consistent goals, values, world views, and relationships that lead to a sense of emptiness,Westen, D., Cohen, R.P. (1993). The self in borderline personality disorder: A psychodynamic perspective. In Z. V. Segal, & S. J. Blatt (Eds.), The self in emotional distress: Cognitive and psychodynamic perspectives (pp. 334-368). New York: Guilford Press. it is not entirely clear whether the link between emotional dysregulation and identity disturbance is because a disturbed identity creates a negative affect that is hard to regulate, because emotional dysregulation disturbs identity, because a third variable causes both (confounding), or some combination of the above. Correlation with BPD There are many theories about why borderline personality disorder often includes identity disturbances. One is that patients with BPD inhibit emotions, which causes numbness and emptiness. Another theory is that patients with BPD identify fully with the affective state of each moment, leaping from one moment to the next without the continuity of a narrative identity. Meeting criteria for major depressive disorder predicts identity disturbance in BPD patients, and identity disturbance is also correlated with a heightened risk for substance use disorders and high anxiety in adolescents. The syndrome of identity disturbance is encountered in all personality disorder types.Modestin, Jiri Identity disturbance in personality disorders. Comprehensive Psychiatry. (11/1998), 39 (6), p. 352 - 357 Neural substrate Imperative to understanding the development of self-identity, researchers investigating the neural basis of self have examined the neural systems involved in distinguishing one's own thoughts and actions from the thoughts and actions of others.Farrer, C., Franck, N., Georgieff, N., Frith, C.

Developing theories of mind. New York: Cambridge University Press. One critical system implicated in this line of research involves the cortical midline structures (CMS), which includes the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex including the adjacent precuneus (see insert).Northoff, G., Bermpohl, F. (2004). \\"Cortical midline structures and the self\\". Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8(3), 102‚Äì107.

In addition to this correlational evidence linking these regions to our self-identity, one study using transcranial magnetic stimulation to transiently disturb neural activity in the medial parietal region of cortex found that this disruption led to a decreased ability to retrieve previous judgements of oneself compared to the retrieval of previous judgements of others.Lou, H. C., Luber, B., Crupain, M., Keenan, J. P., Nowak, M., Kjaer, T. W., Sackeim, H. A., & Lisanby, S. H. (2004). \\"Parietal cortex and representation of the mental Self\\". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 101(17), 6827‚Äì6832. Regions of the brain collectively known as the cortical midline structures. Scientific data suggest the CMS play a vital role in emotional and identity self-regulation. Based on evidence from neuroimaging studies in clinical populations, it seems that both high activity in CMS regions during resting state and self-referential activities, accompanied by deactivation of this region during non-self- referential tasks, are critical for forming a stable and unified identity. More pronounced identity disturbance seems to be facilitated by poorer deactivation of CMS during task-related activities.Stephan Doering, S., Enzi, B., Faber, C., Hinrichs, J., Bahmer, J., and Northoff, G. (2012). \\"Personality Functioning and the Cortical Midline Structures ‚Äì An Exploratory fMRI Study\\". PLOS One, 7(11), 1-8.

A pooh-pooh (also styled as poo-poo)See, e.g., is a fallacy in informal logic that consists of dismissing an argument as being unworthy of serious consideration. Scholars generally characterize the fallacy as a rhetorical device in which the speaker ridicules an argument without responding to the substance of the argument. Definition Authors have characterized the fallacy as a form of a straw man fallacy, where an argument is described as inherently worthless or undeserving of serious attention.See, e.g., Some authors have also described the fallacy as the act of \\"ridicul[ing]\\" an argument as though it were \\"a myth\\", and some characterize it as the act of dismissing an argument \\"with insults without responding to its substance in any way\\". Other authors describe the fallacy as the act of dismissing an argument \\"with the wave of a hand\\". Some sources also suggest the fallacy is an expression that involves \\"sneer[ing]\\", \\"ridicule\\", or \\"malicious comments about the proponent of the argument\\". Origins According to the Oxford Dictionary of English, the term \\"pooh-pooh\\" originated in the late eighteenth century as a \\"reduplication\\" of the word \\"pooh\\", which was a common expression of disgust. Some authors also suggest the term originated as a \\"representation of the act of spitting in sign of contemptuous rejection\\". There is no evidence of a relationship with the slang word for feces. Relationship with the term \\"party pooper\\" Some commentators have suggested that the term \\"party pooper\\" is derived from the phrase \\"pooh-pooh\\". These commentators argue that the \\"disdain\\" a speaker has when \\"pooh-poohing\\" a subject could also \\"describe the negative connotation of a party pooper\\". However, other sources suggest the term \\"party pooper\\" is derived instead from \\"pooped\\", a slang word for \\"exhausted\\" or fatigued\\" and that the phrase \\"party pooper\\" describes an individual who is tired of a party.

In 1958, he furthered his studies at Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Art department, Silpakorn University.  Biography = Early life and education  Thawan appeared to be prodigiously gifted artist since he was a child. In his youth, he had a consuming passion for Buddhism.

In the book, Unger sets forth a program of \\"democratic experimentalism\\" that challenges and defies the neoliberal consensus that there are few alternatives for the progressive reform of democratic and market structures. Overview In Democracy Realized, Unger describes the change in the locus of worldwide ideological conflict since the collapse of communism from the old conflict between statism and privatism, to the new ideological conflict about alternative forms of economic, social, and political organization. Unger notes the persistent difficulty in formulating credible alternatives to the neoliberal program in this setting. In the book, he presents a program for overcoming these difficulties through a practice he describes as ‚Äúdemocratic experimentalism.‚Äù At the heart of Unger‚Äôs productivist program is his explanation of the difference, in business firms, between vanguard production and rearguard production. He contends that the practices of vanguardist production, which include continuous education, a softened contrast between task-defining and task-executing activities, a culture of cooperation between vanguardist firms, and a practice of permanent experiment, already exist in relatively isolated segments of the economy that have greater links to each other, across national borders, than they do to the rearguard economies of their own countries. The vanguardist practices modeled by these firms and industries, Unger argues, are key to productive progress in the contemporary world, and should be extended beyond the productive vanguard to all areas of society, with the assistance of a government reconfigured along democratic experimentalist lines. Unger sets forth the changes he envisions in government, including mechanisms to break impasse between components of government, provisions to heighten political mobilization, expanded and democratized access to capital, a higher social savings rate, significant resources devoted to social endowment, and a central role to an emancipatory school that would train children, as little prophets, to become an informed, creative, and mobilized citizenry of the empowered democracy that Unger envisions. Unger concludes the book with a manifesto consisting of thirteen theses that sum up the principles of democratic experimentalism. Reception Anthony Barnett, reviewing Democracy Realized in the Times Literary Supplement, praised the book highly: > A short, exceptionally sustained argument .... Here [Unger] is in top form, > as he advocates the need for democracy. He is neither earnest nor > predictable. ... Unger's arguments really are different from both sides of > the familiar Lefts and Rights. His is an anti-Marxist, anti-Keynesian > critique of neoliberalism ... In the course of it, he combines high theory > with striking comparisons of Indian, American and Brazilian democracy. Ruth Levitas, writing in the journal Critical Horizons, considered Democracy Realized alongside Richard Rorty's book Achieving Our Country. Levitas described Democracy Realized as a > summary statement of Unger's hopes for a gradual move from the global status > quo to a world that is more democratic and more economically just, through a > process he describes as democratic experimentalism. Here Unger's arguments > are pitched in terms of the institutional structures of society, and a > process of change of those economic, social and political structures and > processes through step-by-step improvisation and collective learning.\\" Levitas concluded her review of Unger's work by stating that Unger's argument is marked by a \\"cautious but deeply optimistic openness.\\" Levitas suggests that although Unger \\"reject[s] the terminology of utopia,\\" he \\"may actually be utopian in the best sense of the word.\\" Michael Rustin, writing in the New Left Review, noted that Unger's work first came to prominence before the collapse of Communist regimes around the world, and remarked that Democracy Realized shows \\"how Unger's thought weathered the upheavals of the past decades...\\" Unger, Rustin concludes, is \\"defiantly committed to finding a radical alternative in the spirit of a new left .... As a global democratic movement against neoliberalism seems to be growing ... his moment as an inspirational social theorist may be about to arrive.\\" Fred Block reviewed Democracy Realized for Contemporary Sociology. Block described Democracy Realized as \\"Unger's effort to make his political vision accessible to readers who lack his erudition and theoretical sophistication.\\" Block praised Democracy Realized, writing, > For those who find current discussions of the \\"Third Way\\" lacking in both > political and intellectual nourishment, Unger's book provides a veritable > feast of ideas. His critiques of both social democracy and existing > institutional arrangements are often eloquent and original, and the > political program strikes the correct balance between radical aspirations > and the imperatives of actual politics.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for having local significance in the theme of archaeology. It was nominated for its scientific potential to illuminate Late Woodland period cultural relationships, lithic technology, and resource use. The St. Croix River Access Site was discovered during an archaeological field survey for the Minnesota Department of Transportation in 1983. 21 excavation units were dug, which showed that the center of the site had been destroyed by industrial activity in the 1930s but that archaeological deposits to either side remained intact. 100 ceramic sherds were found. These were identified with four different cultural complexes‚Äîthe Kathio‚ÄìClam River, St. Croix, Sandy Lake, and Madison‚Äîindicating that the site had been occupied by different cultures over the span of the Late Woodland Period.

The church served as a meeting place for Montgomery's black community during the Montgomery bus boycott. In 1998, the church closed and relocated to a new location in Montgomery. History The Holt Street Baptist Church was established in 1909. The church building, located at the corner of Holt Street and Bullock Street, was completed in 1913. The first reverend was I.S. Fountain. From 1939 until 1952, C.K. Steele was pastor. Montgomery bus boycott On Thursday, December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested after refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus to a white passenger. In response, the Women's Political Council, an African-American civil rights organization founded in Montgomery, organized a boycott of the city's buses by members of the black community. A leaflet distributed to thousands of Montgomery's black citizens read: \\"don't ride the bus to work, to town, to school, or anyplace Monday, December 5\\". The final sentence read: \\"come to a mass meeting Monday at 7:00 pm at the Holt Street Baptist Church for further instructions\\". The boycott began the following Monday, December 5, 1955, the day Parks appeared in court. That evening, a mass meeting was held at the Holt Street Baptist Church to evaluate the boycott's success. The church was the largest and most central church in the black community, and had a large basement that could accommodate hundreds, as well as a spacious main auditorium. Loud speakers were placed into smaller rooms of the church, and there was a large outdoor area for people to gather. Several thousand attended the meeting, where Martin Luther King, Jr. addressed the audience, describing the indignities suffered by Montgomery's black citizens and stating: \\"there comes a time when people get tired of being trampled over by the iron feet of oppression.\\" Rosa Parks wrote: > By the time I arrived at the meeting, the church was so filled up that a > crowd of hundreds spilled out into the street, and speakers had to be set up > outside to accommodate everyone. The excitement around the church was > electrifying, and I remember having a sense that something powerful was > being born. I squeezed my way through the crowd to my seat on the platform, > where a lively discussion about the boycott strategy was underway. The meeting at the Holt Street Baptist Church began the year-long Montgomery bus boycott. A court case, Browder v. Gayle, was launched claiming that bus segregation was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. On November 14, 1956, while the boycott continued, the Supreme Court ordered the state of Alabama to desegregate its buses. That evening, mass meetings were organized at both the Hutchinson Street Baptist Church and the Holt Street Baptist Church. King spoke at both meetings, where 8,000 attendees voted unanimously to end the boycott when the Supreme Court decision took effect. On December 3, 1956, King attended the Holt Street Baptist Church where he delivered a speech entitled \\"Facing the Challenge of the New Age\\". It was the opening address of a week-long \\"Institute of Non-Violence and Social Change\\", organized by the Montgomery Improvement Association.

It was first collected in 1900 but other names were given to it, including Drakaea elastica and D. fitzgeraldii. It was not until 2007 when studies of the drakaeas and their pollinators were carried out, that the present species was recognised as distinct.  Description  Drakaea gracilis is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter, glabrous, dull blue-grey with darker lines radiating from the attachment to the stem. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. The flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp, except that in this species the column is pointed, the labellum lacks spots and the \\"neck\\" of the insect-like labellum is thinner than in other drakaeas. The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a \\"head\\" about one-third long as the \\"body\\" and which is mostly hairy. The rest of the labellum (representing the female \\"body\\" of the insect) is dark maroon in colour and glabrous. Flowers appear from late August to October.  Taxonomy and naming  Drakaea gracilis was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2007. Their description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (gracilis) is from the Latin gracilis meaning \\"thin or slender\\", referring to the labellum of this species which is narrower than that of D. livida.  Distribution and habitat  Slender hammer orchid occurs in higher areas from near Dandaragan to the Stirling Range and Margaret River districts. It grows in sandy gravel in woodland.  Conservation  Drakaea gracilis is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

It is free to download and play, and offers several in-game purchases to enhance gameplay. A prequel, titled Kingdom Conquest, was released in Japan in January 2011, and worldwide in November 2010. The game will be ending its service on 31 August 2017 13:00 Japan time, and its sequel Kingdom Conquest: Dark Empire is being developed. Gameplay In Kingdom Conquest II, players must manage a kingdom in the world of Magna, building and upgrading facilities, managing resources, and collecting Monster Cards that can be drawn from randomized Card Packs. These Card Packs can either be purchased through In-App Purchases or with tickets obtained by running Dungeons in a 3rd Person 3D Dungeon Combat system, where players fight successive waves of enemies, or it can be obtained with challenging the rivals in the Arena to gain the draw ticket for the monsters. The goal of the game is to work collaboratively with other players to rule the fictional world of Magna, which is populated by other players as well as by Monsters, who are found in every section of the gridded World Map. Players must send Monster Units (combinations of various Monster Cards) to various territories, and a successful battle will transfer control of that territory to the player. In this way, players must vie for control over areas of the map, with the ultimate goal of conquering Debris Towers, enormous Spires filled with Monsters. The game is split into seasons, each of which lasts until control over the debris towers is settled and one Alliance has emerged victorious. With the end of one season, and the start of another, players' cities are reset, and they must start over. This ensures that new players have an opportunity to compete with veteran players by starting on relatively equal footing. New content, such as additional unique Monster Cards, is added regularly. Various competitive events also take place to encourage players to engage one another. Changes and additions In the dungeon mode for the Kingdom Conquest II, Ninja and Saint were added as the new character classes since the prequel. For the main castle, the buildings are use the grid size to build instead of the single grid in the prequel. The resources type are reduced from four into three.

It was designed by John Shedden Adam and built in 1890. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 February 2002.  History  Fairymead House, circa 1894 Fairymead House, a grand plantation home, was built on land adjacent to the Fairymead Sugar Plantation, Bundaberg, in 1890, for Ernest and Margaret Young. Ernest Young and his father Henry and brothers Arthur, and Horace, established one of Bundaberg's earliest independent sugar plantations and processing mills, the Fairymead Sugar Plantation. The origin of Bundaberg's sugar industry dates back more than 100 years to the introduction of the Sugar and Coffee Regulations Act 1864. Faced with the high cost of importing sugar from overseas, the Colony wanted to find a way to encourage people to invest in sugarcane growing. The Sugar and Coffee Regulations Act 1864, was introduced into the Queensland Legislative Assembly by Charles Coxen, member for the Northern Downs. The proposed regulations of the Act permitted persons or companies to select land suitable for sugar in lots ranging from half a square mile to two square miles. The introduction of the Act brought about a renewed interest in sugar cane growing and people raced to accumulate land up and down the coast of Queensland. The Brown brothers, Alfred and Arthur, were one of many who acquired land under the Sugar and Coffee Regulations Act 1864. In the early 1870s, the brothers acquired 13 square kilometres of land and developed the cattle property, Tantitha. Working under the Act the brothers divided up a central section of their property into three blocks, Jamaica, Barbados and Mauritius and experimented with the growing of sugarcane. These subdivided sections later became known as Fairymead, after a friend of the family visited the plantation and described the place as being like a \\"fairy mead\\" on a misty morning. The Brown's abandoned their venture into sugar after the floods of 1875, which saw the land swamped and the cane trampled by cattle. They sold the 5 square miles of land devoted to sugarcane to the Young family in 1878. Arthur and Horace Young, with their younger brother Ernest, began to transform Fairymead into a profitable, state of the art, sugar plantation. Like many others who had heard of the potentially profitable sugar industry in Queensland's north, Arthur, Horace and Ernest had no knowledge of the sugar industry except their father's theoretical experience. They had formally held two sheep stations in New Zealand, but when rabbits devastated these stations in 1878, the brothers began an eight-month search for another suitable investment. Their original intent was to investigate the pastoral possibilities in Australia but they were immediately won over by the possibility of a profitable sugar industry in Queensland. Arthur and Horace began operations at Fairymead in 1880, while Ernest went to England to acquire some necessary equipment for the plantation. By 1883 the rougher pioneering work was done and the first major crop harvested. For the first two years the Young's punted the juice from their crops to Millaquin plantation and sugar refinery. In 1884 they installed a clarification unit and boiling plant, which enabled them to refine their own sugar as well as the sugar crops of smaller plantations in the Bundaberg region. By the end of 1884 cane from the Fairymead plantation, processed by their own mill, was producing of sugar daily. The Young brothers were also responsible for the introduction of a number of innovative cane harvesting and crushing techniques, many of which are still in use today. In setting up Fairymead Mill the Young brothers chose to install rollers imported from Glasgow to crush the cane instead of the standard rollers. They installed a Relieux furnace to improve processing efficiency of the raw juice and in , they initiated the use of Fowler's tramway system to bring cane to the mill, introducing the now universal system of cane railways to the Bundaberg district. In 1902 the Young brothers established an irrigation system to help combat the effects of long periods of drought in the region and began working towards the mechanisation of the cane harvesting industry. In 1938 the Young Brothers took their first step towards the mechanisation of cane harvesting by financing the development of a new single-row cane-cutting machine. This machine was a significant advance in cane-cutting technology, capable of cutting over per day in straight cane. This investment paid off during the labour shortages of World War II. The rest of the district also benefited from Fairymead's reduced demand for cane cutters, who were made more available to service other sugar plantations in the region. Their second step was the development of the successful two-row cane-cutting machine. This machine was a post-war development thanks to the mechanical skills of Jim Vichie and the encouragement of Charles Young (son of Ernest and Margaret Young). In 1972 Fairymead Sugar Company merged with Gibson and Howes Pty Limited to form the Bundaberg Sugar Company Limited. Milliquin Sugar Company Pty Limited became part of the group in 1975. In the 121 years since the first primitive sugar juice mill crushed the area's first successful cane crop, Fairymead and the sugar industry has played a major role in the development and prosperity of the city and surrounding district. Fairymead Sugar Plantation is still one of Australia's largest cane farms today. Fairymead House was built on land adjacent to Fairymead plantation in 1890. It was the principal residence of Ernest and Margaret Young and other members of the Young family for over 60 years. It is a good example of the grandeur of plantation accommodation in the late 19th and early 20th century. Fairymead House was designed by Sydney architect John Shedden Adam. It is a large plantation-style home with a floor area of 600 square metres and ceilings. The extremely high ceilings are a feature of the house and were incorporated in the design to provide some relief against the Queensland summer heat. Architect, John Shedden Adam, introduced a number of special inclusions in his design to accommodate requests made by his sister, Margaret Young. One request was to design the front stairs with a landing a couple of feet from the ground so that she could alight from her carriage without soiling her shoes. Between World War I and World War II the house was used as single men's quarters by Fairymead mill and plantation workers. In the early 1950s the house was used for European refugee accommodation. In 1960 Christopher Young (grandson of Ernest and Margaret Young) moved his family back into Fairymead House and remained there until 1986. Museum In 1988 the Bundaberg Sugar Company Ltd gave Fairymead House to the City of Bundaberg as a building of \\"significant historical importance to the district\\" and as the Company's Bicentennial gift to the City. The Bundaberg City Council agreed to provide a site for the home and Fairymead was relocated to the City's Botanic Gardens on the corner of Young Street and Mt Perry Road. In 1990 the Bundaberg City Council began work on a development plan for Fairymead House and over the next four years undertook a number of conservation works on the property. The adaptive re-use of the property from a residence to a museum involved utilising the space underneath the house, which was subsequently bricked in to provide room for a theatrette and Life Education Centre. The interior of the original home has undergone very few structural changes since its construction in 1890 and many of the rooms have been furnished according to their original use. Most rooms contain a series of static displays illustrating the lifestyle of a plantation owner in the late 19th century and the social aspects of the development of the sugar industry. Fairymead house opened to the public in 1994 and now operates as a memorial to north Queensland's sugar industry and the Young family's contribution to the development of the sugar industry in the Bundaberg District.  Description  Fairymead House is situated within the Bundaberg Botanic Gardens, located on the corner of Mt Perry Road and Young Street, Bundaberg. Sited on the southern boundary of the botanic gardens at the end of Thornhill Street, the house is on elevated land and surrounded by well manicured gardens. The principal entry to the place is off Thornhill Street and a bitumen car park is located in front of the house. Built in the Indian Bungalow Style, Fairymead House is an impressive two-storey timber and masonry residence with a large hipped corrugated iron roof. The house has been relocated to this site and as a result, a definite distinction can be made between the original timber fabric of the upper floor and the new masonry structure of the ground floor. The ground floor of the house is constructed on a combination of concrete posts to the exterior and steel columns internally. Spanning between the concrete posts are timber battened valances. The walls to the ground floor are face brick and mirror the perimeter walls to the upper floor core of the house. The ground surface directly under the upper floor verandah is paved. Internally the ground floor is a large open space, which is used for museum exhibition purposes as well as storage. The upper floor of the house is of timber construction clad with timber chamferboard. The verandah surrounds the entire core of the house and links the separate kitchen building with the main house. The Verandah comprises timber floors, posts and handrails with timber batten infill panels forming the balustrade. Timber lattice doors and panels are located at points where timber stairs adjoin the verandah. Entry to the upper floor is via a set of centrally located timber stairs, which lead to the upper verandah and front door. Flanking the entry foyer is the function room to the left, the Margaret room to right and skylight room at the end of the foyer. The function room is the largest room of the house and comprises the original dining and drawing rooms. As such it has a dual fireplace. The skylight room ceiling is punctuated by a leadlight skylight and is currently used as gathering entry space to the museum as well as housing exhibits. Leading off the skylight room are the Toft room, Store Bell room and Gooburrum room, all of which house museum exhibits. Internally the floors are predominately polished timber with the exception of the function room, which is carpeted. The walls and ceilings are clad with timber tongue and groove boards and the original timber joinery to doors and windows appears to be intact.  Heritage listing  Fairymead House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 February 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Fairymead House was built in 1890 for Ernest and Margaret Young, on land adjacent to the Fairymead Sugar Plantation, Bundaberg. Although relocated in 1989 to the Bundaberg Botanic Gardens, the house is a rare example of the grandeur of plantation style accommodation of the late 19th and early 20th century and attests to the development of north Queensland's sugar industry. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although relocated in 1989 to the Bundaberg Botanic Gardens, the house is a rare example of the grandeur of plantation-style accommodation of the late 19th and early 20th century and attests to the development of north Queensland's sugar industry. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Designed by Sydney architect, John Shedden Adam, the architectural style of Fairymead House demonstrates an approach to building design that was influenced by climate and culture. In particular, the Indian Bungalow style home features ceilings, wide verandahs and extended eves, designed to provide shade and natural cooling against the Queensland summer heat. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Although relocated in 1989 to the Bundaberg Botanic Gardens, the house is a rare example of the grandeur of plantation-style accommodation of the late 19th and early 20th century and attests to the development of north Queensland's sugar industry. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Fairymead House also reflects the life and work of the Young brothers, Henry, Horace and Ernest, who established one of Bundaberg's earliest and most successful sugar plantations. The Young brothers made a number of valuable contributions to the development of the sugar industry in Queensland. They established state of the art irrigation systems to combat drought, integrated more efficient cane processing techniques and introduced the now universal cane transport system, the Fowler's tramway. Fairymead House now operates as a museum dedicated to Bundaberg's sugar industry. The rooms within the Young's home have been furnished to reflect their original use and contain a series of static displays illustrating the lifestyle of Ernest and Margaret Young, a pioneering family of the late 19th century, and their contribution to the establishment of Queensland's sugar industry.

Immensely popular in Ohio, the group earned a regional hit with their catchy blue-eyed soul-influenced tune \\"Georgiana\\", and the equally popular B-side \\"Bad Part of Town\\". The single the songs were featured on briefly entered the Billboard Hot 100. Though the Bare Facts could not replicate their success, the band's recordings have appeared on several compilation albums, preserving interest in the group's music. History Bill Williams (lead guitar, lead vocals) formed the group, which consisted of members Dave Craycraft (organ, trumpet, vocals), Rusty Pruitt (drums, vocals), Ron Pruitt, (rhythm guitar), and Randy Boldman (bass guitar). The band's sound is described as blue-eyed soul, combining elements of blues musicians Otis Redding and Muddy Waters' compositions, with influences provided by British Invasion groups the Beatles and the Kinks. Taking advantage of their initial opportunities, the Bare Facts performed in multiple teen dance clubs, bars, and concerts, creating a surge in the group's popularity in Ohio, and gave rationale to concert arrangers to feature the band as the opening act for nationally relevant musical artists such as the Strangeloves, the Dave Clark Five, and the Left Banke. Portsmouth deejay Daniel Craig, according to GO Magazine and Pruitt's account, \\"discovered the group when they were entertaining at a record hop to raise money for an underprivileged children's home\\". Partnered with fellow deejay Bill Callahan, Craig was a key player to negotiating the Bare Facts' recording contract with Jubilee Records. The band entered Jubilee Recording Studios in New York City to cut Wiliams' two original compositions \\"Georgiana\\" and \\"Bad Part of Town\\" (no relation to the Seeds song of the same name). During their stay in the city, the group also had a stint at the nightclub called Town and Country. In October 1966, \\"Georgiana\\", with \\"Bad Part of Town\\" on the flip-side, was released as the Bare Facts' debut single, propelling to number one on the regional charts, and scraping the number 100 position on the Billboard Hot 100. Commenting on the band's success, GO magazine exclaimed that \\"It‚Äôs not often that a new group generates tremendous excitement in the record industry even before their first disc hit\\". Indeed, the songs' combination of blue-eyed soul and jangling pop generated numerous television appearances for the Bare Facts, including on the Cleveland show Upbeat. In addition, the band was arguably the most happening musical act in Ohio, performing to sold-out concerts on a regular basis. In early 1967, the group recruited Bill Maple to be an additional guitarist and trumpeter. They returned to New York City to record \\"The Only Thing\\" and \\"To Think\\"‚Äîtwo originals by Craycraft‚Äîfor their second single. However, the record was supported by considerably less advertisement as Jubilee distributed the release on their subsidiary label, BT Records, after conflicts with the Bare Facts' managers spurred their interest. It was later revealed that Craig was falsifying the band's earning from their singles and gigs, immediately resulting in his firing. The band briefly relocated to Florida in the summer of 1967, but without a sense of leadership to guide the young musicians, they disbanded in August 1967. Over the years, the group's material has appeared on compilation albums.

Established in 1976, the Institute is affililiated with both the University of New South Wales and Sydney Children's Hospital and is located in , Sydney, New South Wales. The Institute's vision is to save the lives of all children with cancer and improve the quality of life for survivors; and is led by Professor Michelle Haber since its establishment.  History  In 1975, Jack Kasses and John Lough met in the waiting room of Sydney Children's Hospital where their daughter and son respectively were undergoing treatment for leukaemia. Lough approached the Apex Club in Wollongong to raise money for cancer research. They started the \\"Help a Kid Make It\\" campaign ‚Äì with a target of $1 million to facilitate research into childhood cancer. The Children‚Äôs Leukaemia and Cancer Foundation was established in May 1976. The foundation evolved into Children's Cancer Institute, which opened its own research laboratories in 1984. The first scientists to join the Institute were Haber, who is now the Executive Director, Murray Norris , now the Deputy Director, and Maria Kavallaris, now Program Head, Tumour Biology & Targeting.  Research focus  The Institute is grouped into four main research units focused on the prevention and treatment of childhood cancer and include understanding childhood cancer, improving diagnosis, finding better treatments, and improving life after cancer.  Achievements  * Launched Zero Childhood Cancer program for the most serious cases of infant, childhood and adolescent cancer * Researchers showed a recently developed drug to have potential against an aggressive subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia * Scientists identified a critical molecular 'feedback loop' that helps initiate and drive neuroblastoma, and an experimental drug with the potential to interrupt the loop and halt tumour progression * Opened a new international clinical trial for aggressive relapsed neuroblastoma * A novel test developed that doubled the survival rate from 35 per cent to 70 per cent for high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  Fundraising initiatives  The Institute undertakes a range of fundraising initiatives including 'Build for a Cure', where a newly-constructed and fully furnished home in was sold at auction in 2014 for 783,000. Scott Cam was an ambassador for the initiative. The Institute is also the beneficiary of many events held annually throughout Australia.

Life and education Brown was born in 1934 in The Bronx, New York. According to Brown, when she was young, she contracted tuberculosis, and was treated by Arthur Logan. Logan was a young African-American in his intern year of residency, and lived in Brown's building. Brown's later inspiration to study science came from asking Logan how one could become a doctor. He replied, \\"Oh, you study science\\". Brown excelled in particular in chemistry, scoring 98 out of 100 on the New York State Regents chemistry exam. She attended New Dorp High School on Staten Island, and graduated in 1952. Brown earned her bachelor's degree in chemistry at Hunter College in 1956, one of two African Americans in the inaugural class of Hunter's chemistry program. In 1958, she became the first African American woman to achieve a master's degree from the University of Minnesota in organic chemistry. Her master's thesis was entitled, ‚ÄúStudy of Dye and Ylide Formation in Salts of 9-(P-dimethylaminophenyl) Fluorene.‚Äù Chemical research After receiving her master's degree, Brown began work as a research chemist at CIBA Pharmaceutical Company, where she was involved in research programs for drug development targeting tuberculosis and coccidiosis. She moved to Merck in 1969, where she co-authored 15 publications, obtained one patent and contributed to 5 others. Brown's work focused on synthesizing novel medicinal compounds. She worked to develop the compound cilastatin sodium. Cilastatin is an inhibitor of renal dehydropeptidase. Since the antibiotic, imipenem, is one such antibiotic that is hydrolyzed by dehydropeptidase, cilastatin is used in combination with imipenem to prevent its metabolism. This combination creates the antibiotic Primaxin (imipenem/cilastatin), which is used to treat severe internal infections, as well as diseases caused by flesh-eating bacteria and some types of pneumonia. In order to succeed in industry, she believed that one needed to be an effective communicator, be able to work on a team, and have a strong scientific education in an ever-changing field.  Outreach  Brown spent 36 years in research before she switched over to education. From 1993 to 2002 she was a visiting professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where she also helped recruit black students to enter STEM fields and worked on science education issues in the state. It was here that she also tutored middle school and high school chemistry teachers. She also won a grant from the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation which she put towards tutoring chemistry teachers. Brown has also devoted significant professional effort to diversity and outreach projects; she served on the National Science Foundation Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women Minorities and Persons with Disabilities and was the historian of the American Chemical Society's Women Chemist Committee. To this day, Brown continues to mentor both middle and high school students through the Freddie and Ada Brown Award. She founded this award in 2010 in honor of her parents.  Work as historian  As a historian of science, Brown contributed seven biographical profiles of African American chemists to the African American National Biography Project, of which contained the first African American women to get their Ph.D's degrees in chemistry and chemical engineering. She is the author of the 2011 book African American Women Chemists, which profiles early African American women in chemistry. Her second book African American Women Chemists in the Modern Era focuses on contemporary women who have benefited from the Civil Rights Act and are now working as chemists or chemical engineers.  Quotations  In an interview with the University of Minnesota, Brown advises young women entering the scientific fields to plow ahead despite the inevitable slights that will come their way. ‚ÄúYou just got to keep going,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou can't stop. If you stop, you're not going to get what you want.‚Äù ‚ÄúGo straight for a Ph.D. Do not stop at a master's degree,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you're a Ph.D., then you're the boss.‚Äù \\"I think working hard and learning new things keeps you young.\\"  Books  *African American Women Chemists in the Modern Era (2018) *African-American Women Chemists (2011) Awards and honors * 1991, Elected to Hunter College Hall of Fame *2004, Soci√©t√© de Chimie Industrielle Fellow of the Chemical Heritage Foundation (American Section) *2005, Outstanding Achievement Award Recipient, University of Minnesota *2005, National Award for Encouraging Disadvantaged Students into Careers in the Chemical Sciences recipient, American Chemical Society *2007, Association for Women in Science fellow * 2009, Glenn E. & Barbara Hodson Ullyot Scholar of the Chemical Heritage Foundation * 2009, American Chemical Society fellow in the Division of Professional Relations * 2020, Henry Hill Award, American Chemical Society References 1934 births Living people Organic chemists Medicinal chemistry American women chemists 21st-century American historians American women historians Historians of science American biographers New Jersey Institute of Technology faculty Hunter College alumni University of Minnesota alumni 20th-century American women scientists People from Hillsborough Township, New Jersey Writers from Summit, New Jersey 20th-century American women writers 20th-century American chemists 20th-century American non-fiction writers 21st-century American women writers Women biographers ","title":"Jeannette Brown"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",R]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/20.md","filePath":"quotesmag/20.md"}'),x={name:"quotesmag/20.md"},L=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,L as default};
