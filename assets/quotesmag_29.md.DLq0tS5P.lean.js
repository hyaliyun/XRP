Racing at the speedway generally takes place between November and May. History Borderline Speedway was opened on 23 February 1957 with stock car racing supported by local motorbike races. The South East Racing Car Club took over the promotion of the speedway in 1961 and six years later production car racing was introduced as were the Super Modifieds (later known as Sprintcars). The speedway received its first safety fence in 1970 and the light towers were replaced with a single light tower on the infield. To improve lighting, this was soon joined by a second infield light tower. The old Super Modifieds were phased out and Sprintcars first hit the track in 1977. The next improvement to the speedway came during the mid-1980s when clay was added to the track affectionately known as \\"The Bullring\\". This unfortunately saw the end of Motorcycle speedway and Sidecar speedway as a regular on the program at Borderline, but two new categories were introduced, the Formula 500's and Street Stocks. The pit area was expanded in 1985 to accommodate extra vehicles and over $100,000 worth of improvements to the speedway were completed by December 1987. From 1980, Borderline has been the South Australian venue for the Easter Sprintcar Trail (the other tracks used generally being Victorian tracks Premier Speedway in Warrnambool and the Avalon Raceway in Lara) with some of the biggest names in Australian sprintcar racing taking part including multiple Australian champions Garry Rush, George and Brooke Tatnell (NSW), Max Dumesny and Brett Lacey (Vic), as well as Mount Gambier's own Bill Barrows (the current President of the speedway), David Veal and Steven Lines. Borderline Speedway was awarded the Australian Sprintcar Championship in 1995, the first time the title had been held in South Australia outside of the state capital Adelaide. The event was a huge success with a crowd of just on 7,500 witnessing Sydney's Garry Brazier retaining his national crown from Brooke Tatnell and 10-time champion Garry Rush. The success of the event saw the introduction of the Kings Challenge which has become an annual event on the Australian calendar since 1995. Traditionally run on the Friday night before the Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic in Warrnambool, the $10,000 to win event was moved to the Thursday night to accommodate the Classic's move to a 3-day event in 2014. With the Kings Challenge running prior to the Classic, the event attracts the best sprintcar drivers from Australia and the United States. In 2007, Borderline Speedway celebrated its 50th year of continuous operation.Borderline Speedway celebrates 50 years Borderline is also a regular stop for the World Series Sprintcars, and is run as the 3rd meeting of \\"Speedweek\\" during the series following Speedway City in Adelaide, Murray Bridge Speedway, and followed by Avalon Raceway and Premier Speedway. The speedway is also a regular venue for the National Super Sedan Series as well as the Sidecar Grand Slam series. Prior to the series demise in 2000, Borderline also hosted rounds of David Tapp's Australian Speedway Masters Series which saw some of Australia's best Solo riders such as Jason Crump, Leigh Adams, Craig Boyce and Ryan Sullivan take on the world's best including World Champions Sam Ermolenko, Billy Hamill and Greg Hancock (USA), Tony Rickardsson (Sweden), Mark Loram, Simon Wigg and Kelvin Tatum (England). Since hosting the national sprintcar title in 1995, Borderline has also hosted the Australian Super Sedan Championship, Australian Street Stock Championship, Australian Modified Production Car Championship, Australian Late Model Championship, and in 2007 hosted the 5th and final round of the Australian Solo Championship.

Early life Finch was born on August 19, 1871, the daughter of Congregational minister Rev. Ferdinand Van De Vere Garretson and Helen Philbrick Garretson. When she was 12, the family moved from New York, where her father was rector of Grace Chapel on West 22nd Street, to Franconia, New Hampshire. She attended Dow Academy and the Cambridge Latin School before entering Barnard College. Finch received her A.B. from Barnard College in 1893, the first graduating class of the new, women's college. She applied to attend law school at Columbia University, and was formally refused on the grounds that the Law School did not admit women. She earned her LL.B. from New York University School of Law in 1898. Career She was a well-known suffragette, president of the New York Equal Franchise Society. Finch was an advocate of careers for women. Although in 1912 she self-described as an \\"orthodox Socialist\\", her views shifted and she was later described as a political \\"liberal\\". She gave paid, public talks on the subject to young ladies as a part-time job to help support herself when she was a college student in the 1890s. She continued to lecture to young ladies on a range of topics, and also worked as a tutor in subjects including Greek after graduating from college. She was a founding member of the Colony Club and was an author, penning such books as Mothers and Daughters, Psychology of Youth, and Flower and Kitchen Gardens. In a February 1908 talk that Finch gave at the Civitas Club in New York City, she said: > Evolutionary and revolutionary methods [of education] will bring the real > resurrection, the Renaissance of man! We are passing through an economic > age, and though conservative folk are usually the most popular it is our > real work to enlarge the social conscience; our ancestors barely kept > themselves alive, we have made a living, and our descendants will pass > ascetic beautiful lives, never selfishly nor foolishly, but on a solid > foundation and for the advancement of all. In June 1949 she was given a Doctorate of Humane Letters, honoris causa, by New York University. The citation described her as a graduate of the university's law school who had founded a women's college, \\"on the unorthodox postulate that every graduate should mother at least four children and cultivate a non-domestic avocation fore and aft.\\" Finch College and Lennox School Finch founded the Finch school in 1900 to provide career training for young women, saying that her own education at Barnard College had not given her or her classmates the skills needed to earn a living. Ironically, Finch became not a career-oriented college, but rather \\"one of the most famed of U.S. girls' finishing schools.\\" Finch founded the Finch School, later Finch Junior College, and, after 1952, Finch College, to enact her conviction that women ought to be prepared for careers. She envisioned a world in which women would work until they wed, at about age 25, bear and rear children for about fifteen years, before resuming paid employment at about age 40 and working for another three decades. Finch founded the college as the Finch School, a secondary school for girls. In 1916 she founded the Lennox School, a primary school to prepare girls to enter the Finch School. Lennox School employed Kitty Kenney and Jennie Kenney as joint heads until they retired in 1929. The Kenney sisters had been trained by Maria Montessori. They were two of the four sisters who were leading members of the militant Women's Social and Political Union. Kitty and Jennie had run a convalescent home in London for recovering suffragettes after they had been imprisoned and force fed. Family She was married to James Wells Finch with whom she had a daughter, Elsie; the couple divorced. In 1913 Finch married John O'Hara Cosgrave, an editor of the New York World, who died in 1947. She was the mother of Elsie Finch McKeogh, a New York literary agent. Death Finch died at her home in Manhattan on October 31, 1949.

A spin-off of New York-based Students for a Democratic Society, the U.S. Labor Party campaigned for policies that increased economic growth and prosperity and criticized laws and judicial rulings that were socially liberal. History=1974 election cycle In 1974, the U.S. Labor Party announced that Susan Pennington would run for the District of Columbia's Delegate to Congress. Pennington was originally from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and she was a graduate of Oakland University. Pennington had worked as a newspaper journalist, a press aide, and a lobbyist for the Health and Welfare Council of the District of Columbia. Pennington was living in Adams Morgan at the time of her candidacy. Pennington said her campaign was against the conspiracy formed by Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the \\"liberal fascists of the Democratic Party\\". Pennington would not discuss local politics of the District of Columbia because the world was facing another depression similar to the Great Depression. According to Pennington, the only solution was nuclear fusion that would create energy from the ocean water, ending worldwide dependence on oil. Pennington said that Vice President Rockefeller had brainwashed the world into thinking there was an oil shortage and was orchestrating a nuclear war in the Middle East. Pennington said that the District's most important problems were inadequate housing and inadequate social service programs, both of which could be solved by ending all debt. Pennington said a socialist economy would help elders, and crime would be reduced by abolishing the United States Department of Justice's Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. Pennington said the U.S. Labor Party was the only political party that could solve the world's problems. The U.S. Labor Party's announced candidate for mayor of the District of Columbia was Gary Turner. Turner did not secure a place on the general election ballot. Pennington did not win the election, receiving two percent of the total vote. 1975 election cycle In 1975, Pennington ran as the U.S. Labor Party candidate to represent Ward 1 on the District of Columbia Board of Election. Pennington said she would end drug trafficking in the District's public schools, ban methadone, and start hospital-based drug detoxification programs. Pennington did not win the election. 1976 election cycle Pennington ran as the U.S. Labor Party candidate for the District's delegate in 1976. Pennington said that the international monetary system would collapse imminently. Pennington did not win the election. Bernard Greene was the U.S. Labor Party candidate for an at-large seat on the Council of the District of Columbia. Greene came in fifth place with three percent of the total vote. 1977 election cycle Pennington ran for an at-large seat on the Council in 1977. Pennington opposed legalization of marijuana because the President Jimmy Carter's administration was using marijuana to dull people's thoughts and create political apathy so that workers perform their unskilled labor. Pennington advocated for ending taxation until the Council completed an overhaul of the entire government. She said that economic prosperity from industrial development was a better alternative to tax increases. She also wanted the Council to stop repaying the money it had borrowed from the United States Treasury and instead use the money for social service programs. Pennington opposed gun control. On a national level, Pennington thought the United States economy should be entirely reorganized in order to save it. Stuart Rosenblatt was the U.S. Labor Party candidate for at-large member of the Board of Education. Rosenblatt was serving as the director of the Washington local affairs office of the U.S. Labor Party. Pennington received 9,252 votes and did not win in the general election, Because the U.S. Labor Party candidate received more than 7,500 votes, the District of Columbia Board of Elections and Ethics deemed the U.S. Labor Party a major party in June 1978. As a major party, the Socialist Workers Party would hold primary elections during each election cycle beginning in 1978 and continuing as long as at least one of their candidates received more than 7,500 votes in each general election. 1978 election cycle 1978 was the first year in which the U.S. Labor Party had an official primary election in the District of Columbia. Pennington was the U.S. Labor Party candidate for mayor in 1978. While focusing her campaign on economic growth, she pointed out the she opposed a commuter tax and a law requiring employees of the District government to live in the District. Pennington claimed that Europe and Japan had formed a new monetary system during a summit and that the United States needed to join it. She advocated for increased enforcement of drug laws, incentives by the government to increase construction, establish high- technology research programs, build a nuclear power plant, improve schools, maintain funding of social service programs, build affordable housing, and enact voter identification laws. She was opposed to energy conservation, gay rights, drug use, and cuts in social service programs because none of them increased economic growth. Bruce Director ran for chair of the Council. A bank teller, Director said that if Marion Barry and other Democratic candidates won their elections, the District could come under a hideous form of social control not seen since the Roman Empire. Cloid J. Green ran for the District's delegate. Green worked in a hotel and drove a taxi. Stuart Rosenblatt ran for at-large member of the Council under the U.S. Labor Party. Suzanne Klebe was the U.S. Labor Party candidate for the Ward 1 seat on the Council. Klebe was a typesetter at a print shop. Pennington came in third place with 1,098 votes, or one percent of the total vote. Director came in third place with 2,727 votes, or three percent of the total vote. Green came in fifth place with 1,065 votes, or one percent of the total vote. Rosenblatt came in fifth place with 4,506 votes, or three percent of the total vote. Klebe came in third place with 215 votes, or two percent of the total vote. Because no U.S. Labor Party candidate received more than 7,500 votes in the general election, the U.S. Labor Party lost its major-party status after the 1978 election. 1979 election cycleCouncil election= Rosenblatt ran in the special election for an at-large seat on the Council in 1979. Rosenblatt said that Secretary of Energy James R. Schlesinger was lying about there being an energy crisis. He said that former Secretary of the Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal and current Secretary G. William Miller were lying about there being an economic recession. Rosenblatt denounced the policies of the United States, United Kingdom, and International Monetary Fund of severely reducing budget deficits because it would create a world depression and start a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Rosenblatt said that the United States Strategic Air Command's exercises would lead to war. He also warned that President Carter had been given \\"emergency totalitarian powers\\". Rosenblatt said that voters who did not support the U.S. Labor Party have \\"condemned your family to burn in the thermonuclear war or at best to be squeezed dead in a period of brutal Hitlerian austerity.\\" Rosenblatt said that implementing significant decreases in interest rates, increased employee wages, and importation of oil from Mexico would guarantee one-hundred years of prosperity and no inflation. Rosenblatt did not win the special election. =Board of Education election= In late 1979, Rosenblatt ran for an at-large seat on the Board of Education. Rosenblatt protested proposed decreases in the public school system's budget. He called for more advanced classes and more vocational classes. He said that elementary school students should be taught how to compose classical music in order to strengthen their cognitive abilities. Rosenblatt predicted that Mayor of the District of Columbia Marion Barry would severely cut public schools' budgets, leading to poor performance by students, which he would then blame on teachers and principals. Rosenblatt came in third place with 3,025 votes, or ten percent of the total vote.

The tower was built by Giovanni Gourgion in 1690, and it became a symbol of the village of Xewkija. Despite being listed on the Antiquities List in 1925, it was demolished by American forces in 1943 to make way for an airfield for the Allied invasion of Sicily. History Gourgion Tower was built by and named after Giovanni Gourgion, a Gozitan nobleman who had made a fortune in corsairing against Ottoman shipping, and who was the personal secretary of Grand Masters Gregorio Carafa and Adrien de Wignacourt. The tower was completed in 1690, and served as the centrepiece of Gourgion's estates and a farmhouse in Gozo. According to tradition, Grand Master Wignacourt himself attended the opening ceremony of the tower, but this is unlikely since it is not recorded in any archives. In 1798, during the French occupation of Malta, some of the coats of arms at Gourgion Tower were defaced by French forces. Some alterations were made to the structure over the years, including the addition of a room on the first floor. The tower was listed on the Antiquities List of 1925. Demolition The tower was demolished between 16 and 20 June 1943 to make way for Runway No. 1 of the Xewkija Airfield. The demolition work was carried out by Americans from the Company E of the 21st Engineer Aviation Regiment, as well as 300 Gozitan labourers. The airfield was inaugurated on 23 June, and was used during the Allied invasion of Sicily which started on 9 July. It became redundant on 14 July, when American aircraft moved to the Ponte Olivo Airfield in Sicily. The last planes left on 19 July, and the airfield was cleared back to agricultural land in June 1944. According to some sources, Gourgion Tower was dismantled not demolished, and the Americans marked all the stones so the tower could be rebuilt. When the airfield was cleared in 1944, the authorities reportedly asked the owners if they wanted the tower to be rebuilt or financial compensation, and the owners chose the second option. However, this claim is not verified in any documentary source. Many of the tower's inscriptions and decorated stones were retrieved by Lawrence Zammit Haber, and they were later donated to the Gozo Museum of Archaeology. They were displayed there for a number of years, but were later removed and are now in storage at Heritage Malta. Architecture The Gourgion Tower was meant to serve both as a country retreat and a defensive position, so it was largely utilitarian in nature. The structure was rectangular, and its architecture had similarities to the Bubaqra Tower on mainland Malta. A notable feature of the tower was a domed stair-hood, which was similar to echauguettes found in the Hospitaller fortifications of Malta. The tower also contained eight balcony-like structures, which were similar to the machicolation, found in earlier structures such as Gauci Tower, and to a Mashrabiya. The design derive from architecture of the Middle-East, and evolved to local interpretation. The tower's façade had musketry loopholes, and was decorated with the coats of arms of Gourgion, Carafa and Wignacourt, as well as a number of inscriptions and other sculptures. The three coats of arms were defaced during the French occupation. Gourgion's estates near the tower were surrounded by a boundary wall, which also contained a number of inscriptions and an ornate public well.

It is mostly used for inline speed skating competitions but has also hosted tennis tournaments and concerts.  History Roller sports are very popular in Mar del Plata since the early 60s, and in 1966 the city hosted the first inline speed skating World Championship out of Europe on road surface. The municipal skating rink was opened in 1969 to host a second world championship, this time on track surface. The original building had only two stands, one in front of the other, on the sides of the track. After 1969, this venue hosted again the world championship in 1978, 1983 and 1997, this last time including road and track events. In order to adapt its capacity and facilities to the requirements of international competitions, remodellation works were started before the 1995 Pan American Games. New stands were built and the whole perimeter of the rink was closed, raising its capacity to 7,500 spectators. The old stands were refurbished and turned into VIP stands for 800 spectators, with press area and cabin for judges. For the Pan American Games held in Mar del Plata, the roller skater Nora Vega, original from the city, was chosen to be the last torch bearer and to light the Pan American Cauldron during the opening ceremony. Vega would end up winning two gold medals, a silver and a bronze medal during the games and received the Golden Olimpia Award as the most important sportsperson of 1995 in Argentina. The patinodrome is named after Adalberto Lugea, a skater of Unión de Mar del Plata that broke the world record for most consecutive hours on skates in 1947, reaching 50 hours and 25 minutes of non stop skating.  Facilities  Beneath the stands there is a gym, coffee house, locker rooms, administrative offices and emergency room. The skating rink area also offers bedrooms to accommodate up to 60 athletes. As Mar del Plata is home to Argentine Bandy Union,Federation of International Bandy the center of the track, a 1080m2 area, is used to practice this sport and also for inline hockey matches. The Patinódromo Municipal is part of the \\"Teodoro Bronzini\\" Municipal Sports Park, a 35 hectares area with several sport venues, including the Estadio José María Minella, the \\"Julio Polet\\" Municipal Velodrome, the Pan American Field Hockey Stadium, the \\"Alberto Zorrilla\\" Natatorium, the \\"Justo Roman\\" Athletic stadium and the Polideportivo Islas Malvinas.  Events  This venue has hosted four World Championship, the roller sports events for the 1995 Pan American Games and the inline speed skating events for the 2006 South American Games. It has also hosted the Mar del Plata Open tennis tournament, the 2014 Davis Cup first round between Argentina and Italy, several boxing fights (including South American Super middleweight champion Ruben Eduardo Acosta vs. Luis Daniel Parada in 2007), and many concerts, including of Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota (1997, 1999), Deep Purple (1999), Soda Stereo (1991), Los Piojos (2004, 2006), Diego Torres (2007), La Renga (1999, 2004, 2005), Bersuit Vergarabat (2004, 2008), El Tri (1999), Luis Alberto Spinetta (1991) and Billy Idol (1991).

The film is a remake of the 2015 Telugu film Pataas. The music was composed by Amresh Ganesh with editing done by Praveen K. L. and cinematography by Sarvesh Murari. The film began production in November 2015 and was released on 9 March 2017. The film was dubbed into Hindi as ACP Shiva by RKD Studios. Plot ACP Shivakumar IPS (Raghava Lawrence) is a corrupt police officer who gets himself transferred to Chennai and misuses his power to gain money in unorthodox methods. During this process, he encourages an MP named GK (Ashutosh Rana), who has become a headache to Kirubakaran (Sathyaraj), the Police Commissioner of Chennai. Shiva happens to be Kiruba's son, who is angry on the latter as his supposed negligence killed his mother (Sukanya) and just-born sister, though Kiruba actually left his wife in the hospital to save several children in a terrorist attack. Unaware of this, Shiva left Kiruba, joined an orphanage, and became an IPS officer to seek revenge on him. During his life at Chennai, Shiva meets Jaanu (Nikki Galrani), a journalist working for Sun News; and Nithya, a philanthropist who works in a coffee shop. Shiva loves Jaanu and expects her to reciprocate the same, only to get rejected by her because of his corrupt nature. Nithya is brutally killed by GK's brother Sanjay (Vamsi Krishna) when she tries to save a techie from being sexually assaulted near HITEC City. Nithya's death enrages Shiva, so he turns against GK. GK wants to make Sanjay a politician, and Shiva challenges GK to save Sanjay from getting arrested. GK manages to kidnap the techie, but with the help of a transgender that witnessed Nithya's murder. Shiva arrests Sanjay with a non-bailable warrant and challenges GK to bring Sanjay out of jail within three days. Meanwhile, Kiruba and Shiva are reunited, and Shiva's marriage with Jaanu is approved. On the third day, GK's men kidnap the transgender and Jaanu. Shiva and his team go to the spot to save the witness. However, Shiva could not save the transgender, as she was killed by the kidnappers. Shiva receives a call from GK, who says that he has kidnapped Jaanu and Kiruba and challenges Shiva to save them by bringing Sanjay to him. GK then kills Kiruba and Shiva's team. Meanwhile, Sanjay and his friends are released from jail, and Shiva soon kills them. Shiva reaches the spot after tracing Kiruba's GPS signal. On arriving, he finds Kiruba dead and Jaanu attached with a bomb. After a long fight, Shiva kills GK's henchmen. At that time, Shiva's service vehicle and the police reach there. GK and his partners are thrown into the vehicle, on which petrol is poured. Shiva shoots the van, and they die in the blast. Kiruba is then admitted to the hospital. Shiva finds out that he is still alive as he can hear his heart beating. Shiva reunites with Kiruba once more. Cast *Raghava Lawrence as Shivakumar IPS a.k.a.

B. Choudary bought the Tamil remake rights of the successful Telugu film Pataas (2015) and revealed that Raghava Lawrence would direct and star in the film. However, Raghava Lawrence stopped pre-production on the venture, and instead launched two new films as a director in August 2015. He revealed he planned to work with Vendhar Movies in a film titled Motta Shiva Ketta Shiva with Nikki Galrani, named after a dialogue from Kanchana 2; meanwhile, he also announced a fourth film in his Muni franchise, Naaga. In a turn of events in November 2015, it was revealed that Raghava Lawrence would postpone his other films and begin work on the Tamil remake of Pataas with director Sai Ramani, who had earlier directed the Jiiva-starrer Singam Puli (2011). The project later adopted the title Motta Shiva Ketta Shiva, after Vendhar Movies readily agreed to give the title away. In return, Vendhar Movies acquired the Tamil Nadu theatrical distribution rights to the film. Initially Kajal Aggarwal was considered to play the lead before Nikki Galrani took over the role. Production started in mid November 2015, with scenes involving Raghava Lawrence shot in Chennai. The film was predominantly shot throughout late 2015 and early 2016 and by March 2016, Lawrence revealed that only twenty more days of shoot were pending. The climax of the film was shot in Ambattur, Chennai and production was completed barring the shoot of the songs by the end of March 2016. The team prepared to release the film by May 2016 but were forced to delay the venture after producer Madhan of Vendhar Movies had disappeared after writing a suicide note. Madhan and Vendhar Movies' involvement in the project as a distributor meant that legal issues put the release of the film on hold, as police investigated Madhan's disappearance. Meanwhile, production on the shoot of the songs were completed after Raghava Lawrence choreographed and filmed songs with Lakshmi Rai in May 2016 and then with Nikki Galrani in Malaysia during July 2016. Madhan was later arrested after being found to be hiding in Manipur, and following his capture, the film prepared for a theatrical release after the distribution rights was sold to Sivabalan Pictures. In order to ensure the release of the film, Raghava Lawrence sacrificed a large amount from his salary and also helped settle the deficit owed by Vendhar Movies. Release The film was initially scheduled to be released in November 2016, before the producers planned a worldwide release date on 17 February 2017. In the weeks leading up to the film's release, Raghava Lawrence requested the producer of his other completed film Shivalinga to delay the release of that project, in order to accommodate the release of Motta Shiva Ketta Shiva. The film was then delayed by a further week to 24 February 2017, after the makers had to settle further legal settlements.

Soundtrack Amresh Ganesh was signed on by R. B. Choudary and director Sai Ramani to work on the music for the film, after he had impressed them with his sample tracks. Amresh, who had previously worked as an actor in films, also turned down an opportunity to act in the film. As a part of the album, he remixed an old song, \\"Aadaludan Paadalai Kettu Rasipadhile\\" from Kudiyirundha Koyil (1968) and recorded it with Shankar Mahadevan and Padmalatha. Amresh also convinced Raghava Lawrence to sing in the film and make his playback singing debut. Prior to the release of the film, actor Tinku released a video alleging that Amresh had stolen a song titled \\"Hara Hara Mahadevaki\\" from a film that he and Robert were making titled Thaathaa Car-ai Thodadhae. Tinku alleged that Amresh had worked together with them to create the song during early 2015, but production troubles had shelved the film and subsequently Amresh had taken the song to a different project. In a press meet in February 2017, Amresh Ganesh refuted the claims and provided evidence of Tinku and Robert continuously trying to scam him by gathering funds for the shelved project. Amresh stated that he had developed the song free of cost and had paid for the duo to take part in a failed shoot of the song in Bangkok, before the film was stalled. Moreover, Amresh revealed that Robert had owned up to playing the song to music composer Srikanth Deva, and had attempted to include it in another shelved film titled Minor Kunju Kaanom which Tinku, Robert and Srikanth Deva were involved in. The lyrics of the song was later edited for the film's theatrical release, with the title of \\"Ada Ada Maharanikki\\" in place of the original lyrics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOw1MrCoeW0 ReferencesExternal links * 2017 films Tamil-language films Indian films 2010s Tamil-language films Tamil remakes of Telugu films Masala films Fictional portrayals of the Tamil Nadu Police 2017 action thriller films Indian action thriller films Films shot in Chennai Films shot in Malaysia Films featuring an item number ","title":"Motta Shiva Ketta Shiva"},{"id":"48600365","text":"Dance Session Album #2 is an album by pianist/bandleader Count Basie recorded in 1954 (with one track from 1952) and originally released on the Clef label.Edwards, D. & Callahan, M.

The certification exams offered cover a broad range of technologies throughout the Microsoft ecosystem of IT technologies. When an individual passes a certification exam and earns a Microsoft certification, then they are recognized as a Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP). By passing multiple exams they have the opportunity to earn larger, more distinguished certifications; such as the MCSE and MCSD certifications. In 2016, Microsoft expanded with the launch of its Microsoft Professional Program, a fully online certification program in partnership with edX which includes various tracks in data science, front end web development, cloud computing, DevOps. This program has expanded to a total of 8 tracks in 2018 with the addition of its artificial intelligence and software development program certification in April 2018. Many of these programs are focused on equipping learners with up to date skillsets with various Microsoft tools, including Excel, PowerBI, Visual Studio, and Azure. The Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) certification is no longer available.  Overview  Microsoft Certifications are professional certifications that demonstrate the holder's expertise in Microsoft related technologies. They have been divided into six categories named as Cloud, Mobility, Data, Productivity, App Builder and Business applications. Each category aligns to a series of technologies that span the entire Microsoft product portfolio. The core technologies include Microsoft Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server, Office 365, SharePoint Server, Exchange Server, Skype for Business and Microsoft Dynamics 365. The pathway to Microsoft Certified Professional is broken down into tiers to demonstrate the level of expertise for the holder. These include: * Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) – is the entry level certification that validates the holder's fundamental technology knowledge - previous entry level MCP has been replaced by MTA. * Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) – this certification validates the holder's ability to build and design solutions using core Microsoft technologies. There are many flavours of MCSA certifications including Server 2012, Server 2016, Windows 10, SQL Server 2016, BI Reporting, Dynamics 365, Office 365, Web applications. * Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) – these certifications show the skills to design and build advanced solutions which integrate multiple Microsoft technologies - requires MCSA prerequisite * Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD) – the certification proves the holder's skills in designing and building application solutions – requires MCSA prerequisite Retired pathways: * Microsoft Certified Database Administrator (MCDBA) – database specialist that can design and maintain databases using Microsoft SQL-Server – retired as of September 30, 2012 * Microsoft Specialist – Designed to validate knowledge and skills in a specialized area of technology, the Specialist credential sits outside the tier system – retired as of March 31, 2017 The MCSE certification originally stood for Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer. In 2012, Microsoft made some changes to the Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) program, and renamed MCSE to mean Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert. At the same time, the MCSA certification was renamed to Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate; from its original, previous name of Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator. As of 2018, the Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) program has three skill levels: Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), and Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE). As of February 2019, Microsoft is no longer providing MCP status with single exams, such as MTA, MCSA and MCSE. Microsoft is focusing on replacing the MCP program with the role based certifications. From MTA to fundamental, MCSA to associate and MCSE/MCSD to expert. In February 2020, Microsoft announced that it would phase out the MCSA, MCSE and MCSD certifications effective June 30, 2020 in favor of \\"role-based\\" certifications focused primarily on Azure and Microsoft 365 On March 26, 2020, Microsoft announced that remaining exams associated with Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA), Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer (MCSD), Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE) will retire on January 31, 2021.  Requirements Microsoft Certifications are earned by passing exams aligned to a specific certification. The process of earning certification has changed multiple times since its inception. The current iteration was introduced September 26, 2016, when Microsoft announced that it was retiring all existing MCSE and MCSD certifications, introducing new pathways, and changing the way individuals earn and maintain those Microsoft certifications. Under the new process, the number and selection of exams required to achieve a Microsoft certification varies. MCSA certifications require the individual to pass two or more exams in order to achieve the credential. Depending on the MCSA selected, individuals are either required to pass a set pathway of exams, or can choose from a pool of exams known as electives. MCSE and MCSD certifications now only require individuals to pass a single exam, each certification has a pool of aligned elective exams that the individual can choose from. Historically, MCSE and MCSD credentials required the individual to recertify after a period of two to three years in order to keep the credential in the \\"Active section\\" of their transcript. Under the new system, the MCSE and MCSD credentials no longer have a recertification requirement, they remain on the \\"Active transcript\\" of the holder, once gained. Individuals instead can now re-earn a certification every year by passing an additional elective exam. It was done to reflect the increasing cadence of updates to Microsoft products and services, where products like Microsoft Azure are adding new features every 48 hours.

It presented a Christian Democratic viewpoint. The newspaper struggled in the period before World War II (1939–45), and was closed from 1940 to 1944. After the liberation of France it was relaunched, and at first had considerable success as the organ of the Popular Republican Movement. With changes in the political mood in the post-war period it went into decline and was forced to close in 1951. Origins Francisque Gay, future publisher and editor of L'Aube, launched the weekly La Vie Catholique in October 1924. The journal aimed to inform and unite Catholics of different viewpoints. La Vie Catholique was independent, and after 1926 was hostile to the right-wing Action Française movement, although in 1928 Gay asserted that it was not involved in party politics. In January 1932 Gay launched the new Catholic daily L'Aube. He intended the paper to be read by all \\"democrats with a Christian inspiration.\\" History The first issue of L'Aube appeared on 20 January 1932. The paper was founded without capital, and never had enough subscribers. It was also handicapped by a legacy of mistrust and resentment from the controversies of La Vie Catholique. The newspaper had between 7,000 and 11,000 subscribers at first. Gay launched the \\"Amis de l'Aube\\" in 1937 in an effort the gain support. The association met in Paris for three days in November 1937, and had 1,342 members. By 1938 and 1939 the paper printed at least 20,000 copies, but still sold only 12,000 to 15,000 copies. The future premier Georges Bidault began contributing to the paper in March 1932. Bidault began writing editorials in 1934, and in effect became editor-in-chief. From 1934 the journal was the joint work of Gay and Bidault. L'Aube became noted for Bidault's editorials. The paper continued the fight against the Action Française. It had a complex relationship with the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), which it increasingly saw as belonging to the right. On colonial issues the paper rejected the \\"mystique of Empire\\" and opposed repressive measures. In 1939 the paper opposed the policy of appeasement of Hitler. Maurice Schumann was the political editor of L'Aube at the start of World War II (1939–45), writing under the pseudonym of André Sidobre. During the war the paper ceased publication on 10 June 1940, and resumed on 23 August 1944. When it was relaunched after the Liberation of France it printed 240,000 copies. In the first two years the paper prospered, due in part to the popularity of the Popular Republican Movement, in part to the fact that its rival Catholic daily, La Croix, did not appear for six months after the liberation of Paris. After that, L'Aube went into steady decline. Schumann was political director of the newspaper from 1945 to 1951. Post-war daily print volumes were: *1944 180,000 *1945 180,000 *1946 240,000 *1947 108,000 *1948 60,000 *1949 40,000 *1950 36,000 *1951 35,000 The paper did not appear between 13 February 1947 and 17 March 1947.

History California Volunteers was originally installed at the intersection of Market and Van Ness, per the request of the sponsoring committee of citizens and the sculptor. The monument cost $25,000. Funding for the monument came from surplus donations for a reception held for the volunteers from California upon their return from the Philippines. Scene from the dedication ceremony on August 12, 1906 The monument was dedicated on Sunday, August 12, 1906. During the ceremony, several dignitaries gave speeches, including former San Francisco Mayor Phelan; current Mayor Schmitz; California Governor Pardee; and General James F. Smith, Governor-General of the Philippines. In 1925, it was moved to its present location at the corner of Market and Dolores Street. Design The central figure depicts Bellona, goddess of war, riding on the back of Pegasus, the winged horse. (The 1906 San Francisco Call article reporting from the dedication ceremony describes the riding figure as Victory). There are two soldiers on the monument, one fallen, and one standing to the side armed with a pistol. One side of the pedestal is inscribed with the text \\"Erected by the Citizens of San Francisco in Honor of the California Volunteers, Spanish–American War, 1898. First to the Front.\\" The bronze figures are tall and long, mounted on a granite base another tall. Shortly after its dedication in August 1906, Will Sparks criticized the original placement of the monument at Market and Van Ness, stating \\"from many points of view, including one of the most important, the [silhouette] is absolutely meaningless. Looking down Van Ness avenue it is impossible to tell what it is that surmounts the pedestal. There is nothing but a tangled mess of bronze.\\" Sparks went on to recommend the monument should be relocated \\"up beside a building where only the one impressive side would show. Do this with it and it will become a great monument. As it is there is much that is disappointing.\\" See also * 1906 in art ReferencesExternal links 1906 establishments in California 1906 sculptures Castro District, San Francisco Equestrian statues in California Monuments and memorials in California Outdoor sculptures in San Francisco Sculptures of men in California Spanish–American War memorials in the United States Statues in San Francisco ","title":"California Volunteers (sculpture)"},{"id":"48600682","text":"Dwarf goldenrod is a common name for several plants and may refer to: *Solidago nana *Solidago nemoralis *Solidago sphacelata ","title":"Dwarf goldenrod"},{"id":"48600707","title":"First Marlin cabinet"},{"id":"48600730","text":"Myles P.

Barrett (born c. December 6, 1889) was an American African American artist from Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania. Over the course of a more than fifty year artistic career he created in excess of 225 sculptures. His medium of choice was carved wood, more particularly peach stone carvings. These sculptures were created using a variety of instruments such as knives, picks and needle sized manually operated drills and with such practiced skill that a work might be created in as little as two hours. Despite their diminutive size, his works were detailed, such as monkeys with facial expressions, fingers and toes. In addition to his work as a peach stone carver, for which he was featured in the May 1962 edition of Ebony Magazine, Barrett also was a more general artist, and was a player of the violin, cello and viola. His hobbies included being a magician and ventriloquist. He worked as a fireman in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania from approximately 1953 to 1962. He died in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in 1967.

It is approximately long and flows through Lemon Township. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek has two named tributarie: Horton Creek and Oxbow Inlet. It is not designated as an impaired waterbody. The surficial geology in its vicinity mostly consists of Wisconsinan Till, alluvium, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, and bedrock. The area near the mouth of Oxbow Creek was settled before 1800 and some mills were constructed on it in the 19th century. A number of bridges have also been constructed across the creek. Its watershed is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Course Oxbow Creek looking upstream Oxbow Creek begins in Oxbow Lake, which the tributary Oxbow Inlet flows into, in Lemon Township. The creek flows east and then south for a few tenths of a mile, entering a valley. It then turns east for several tenths of a mile, flowing through the valley, before receiving the tributary Horton Creek from the left. At this point, the creek turns south-southeast for several tenths of a mile before turning south. After a few tenths of a mile, it turns southeast for a short distance, crossing Pennsylvania Route 92 and reaching its confluence with Tunkhannock Creek. Oxbow Creek joins Tunkhannock Creek upstream of its mouth. Tributaries Oxbow Creek has two named tributaries: Oxbow Inlet and Horton Creek.

Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Oxbow Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. The surficial geology near the mouth of Oxbow Creek mainly consists of alluvium. Slightly further upstream, there is still some alluvium, but also a till known as Wisconsinan Till, and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. In the vicinity of the creek's upper reaches, the surficial geology mainly consists of Wisconsinan Till, although there is some alluvium and a patch of Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift near the confluence of the tributary Horton Creek. Watershed The watershed of Oxbow Creek has an area of . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Factoryville. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Tunkhannock. The mouth of the creek is located at East Lemon. The designated use of Oxbow Creek is aquatic life. In August and September 2011, Oxbow Creek experienced significant flooding, which caused streambank erosion. To protect against such occurrences in the future, large rocks of riprap were installed along that reach of the creek. History Bridge crossing Oxbow Creek Oxbow Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1193074. The creek is also known as Hortons Creek. This variant name appears in Israel C. White's 1883 book The geology of the North Branch Susquehanna River Region in the six counties of Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Columbia, Montour and Northumberland. The early settlers in Lemon Township were people who came from Orange County, New York before 1800 to the mouth of Oxbow Creek. A number of sawmills were constructed on the creek in the 1800s. However, in 1868, heavy rains destroyed most of the mill dams on the creek. In 1879, W.S. Shaw constructed a circular saw and lath mill on the creek. Three bridges carrying State Route 1009 over Oxbow Creek were built in Lemon Township in 1948; two are steel stringer/multi-beam or girder bridges and one is a concrete culvert bridge.

Development In 1954, People's Republic of China (PRC) and former Soviet Union (USSR) reached agreement to allow PRC to license produce Soviet P-6 torpedo boats under the supervision of Soviet technical advisors, with components and blue prints supplied by USSR. In the February 1955, construction of the first boat in China begun at Wuhu Shipyard (芜湖造船厂), the predecessor of Wuhu Xinlian Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (芜湖新联造船有限公司) today, where a total of 51 boats were eventually built. Half a year later in August of that same year, construction of the first boat of the second production line begun at Guangzhou Shipyard, where 12 boats were eventually completed. After completion of 12 boats at Guangzhou shipyard and 12 boats at Wuhu shipyard, USSR encountered difficulty to supply the specialized wood needed, so effort was spent to find domestic Chinese wood as a necessary replacement. From the 25th unit that begun construction in 1957, domestic Chinese wood had been used to successfully replace the imported wood. A total of 63 boats were completed, with 51 by Wuhu Shipyard, 12 by Guangzhou Shipyard. Originally equipped with Type 512 radar, most of boats were eventually had it replaced by Type 351. Variants Several variants of Type 02 series torpedo boats have produced, including the following: *Type 6602: First 24 units produced in China, differs from the original Soviet P-6 class in lack of the depth charges, because ROCN, the adversary of PLAN, did not have any submarines. *Type 02: 25th units onward, with domestic Chinese wood replaced the imported Soviet wood. *Type 0101: Derivative of Type 02 as an enlarged wooden-hulled gunboat version, developed under the supervision of Soviet advisor, with displacement increased to 75 tons. *Type 6702: Version incorporating the steel hull of Type 0112 gunboat, entering service in December 1969 after 9 months development. *Type 7102II: Steel hulled Type 02, first entering service in December 1974.

In 1966, PLAN decided to indigenously develop a new generation of large torpedo boat that is armed with four torpedo tubes. The large boat would have better sea keep capability than its smaller predecessors and because it is more heavily armed, less will be needed to achieve the same result in comparison when its smaller predecessors were deployed. The 701st Research Institute of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC, known as Warship Research Academy at the time) was assigned as the designer, and Wuzhou 449th Factory, the predecessor of China Guijiang Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (中船桂江造船有限公司) was assigned to build the first unit. Construction begun in 1971 and the boat was launched in 1974, and turned over to PLAN in 1976, and is designated as Type 027. Two year after the delivery of the first boat, the 701st Institute modified design and this time, Wuhu Shipyard (芜湖造船厂), the predecessor of Wuhu Xinlian Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (芜湖新联造船有限公司) was assigned to build this improved version designated as Type 027II. The new boat differs from the first boat in the material used: Type 027II uses the new Type 903 steel that reduces the overall weight by a ton. Construction begun on June 19, 1979, and in September 1980, launching and subsequent sea trials were completed, proving the success of new design. Before the installation of subsystem, the design went yet another major upgrade, mostly in onboard electronics such fire control system, IFF and electrical control system of the propulsion. As a result, the installation of subsystem did not occur until June 1983, three years after the completion of the construction and sea trials of the hull. With most of its originally planned onboard subsystems of Type 027 replaced by newly developed systems, Type 027II is subsequently renamed as Type 027IIB. Installation of new subsystems took three months, and the first Type 027IIB was launched on September 20, 1983, and from November 3 thru November 21 of that same year, the boat completed its trials in Yangtze River. On December 13, 1986, the boat reached Ningbo to conduct sea trials, which was completed after ten trials. On January 10, 1984, the first Type 027II was handed to PLAN. In October 1985, construction of the 2nd Type 027II begun. However, due to the advent of missile boats, the planned construction program of Type 027 series torpedo boats were cancelled. As a result, only three Type 027 series torpedo boats entered service with PLAN, one Type 027 and two Type 027B, all of which have been retired from active service by early 2010s.

Based in Roanoke, Virginia, the Rail Yard Dawgs play their home games at Berglund Center. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Rail Yard Dawgs are one of several SPHL teams to not participate in the 2020–21 season. History The Rail Yard Dawgs are the fifth professional hockey team to call the Roanoke Valley home, following the Roanoke Valley Rebels of the Eastern Hockey League and later the Southern Hockey League (1967–1976), the Virginia Lancers/Roanoke Valley Rebels/Rampage (1983–1993) and the Roanoke Express of the East Coast Hockey League (1993-2004), and the Roanoke Valley Vipers of the United Hockey League (2005–2006). On October 20, 2015, an ownership group headed by Bob McGinn purchased the dormant Mississippi Surge franchise and relocated the team to Roanoke for the 2016–17 season. The ownership group consisted of Bob McGinn and his three NHL player sons, Jamie, Tye, and Brock, former Surge owner Tim Kerr, and several other locals. On November 19, the Rail Yard Dawgs name, logo and colors were officially announced. On April 29, 2016, Sam Ftorek was announced the team's first head coach. The Rail Yard Dawgs played their home opener at the Berglund Center in front of a sellout crowd on October 21, 2016, falling to the Knoxville Ice Bears 2–0. The team started with a 4–3–1 record, but faltered down the stretch, finishing the season with 43 points and a final record of 17–30–9. The team finished in ninth place in the league, five points from qualifying for the final playoff spot. The team drew 87,831 fans over the course of the season with an average of 3,136 per game for fifth highest in the ten team league. During the 2017–18 season, head coach Ftorek was relieved of his duties after 18 games with a 5–11–2 record. He was replaced by Dan Bremner, a former SPHL player. Under Bremner, the Rail Yard Dawgs went 21–15–2 and qualified in the final seed for the playoffs, but were swept in the first round by the top-seeded Peoria Rivermen. In the second season under Bremner, the Rail Yard Dawgs finished fifth in the league with a 28–24–4 record. Roanoke was again selected by the top-seed Rivermen as their first round opponent and the Rail Yard Dawgs upset the regular season champions in a two- game sweep. Name, logo, and the railroad connection In a manner similar to previous Berglund Center attendants, the Roanoke Express and Roanoke Steam, the Rail Yard Dawgs name and logo pay tribute to the region's railroad heritage. The city has a long history as a railroad hub and the Berglund Center is in close proximity to the nearby Roanoke Shops and train lines operated by Norfolk Southern Railway, as well as the recently completed Roanoke Amtrak Station. This rail history is further exemplified by the presence of railroad tracks on the team logo. The team logo depicts the mascot, Diesel, dressed in apparel similar to that of a train conductor. His hat depicts and image of the Mill Mountain Star, arguably Roanoke's most iconic landmark. The star is also present on the team's alternate logo, which is visible on the shoulders of the team's uniforms. Philanthropy The Dawgs have partnered with three local charitable organizations:http://www.roanoke.com/opinion/editorials/our-view-hockey- homework/article_4ea39381-363e-5b30-b17f-22753bdd64b9.html * Guns and Hoses Hockey- annual hockey game to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Association.

However, due to the political turmoil in China at the time, Type 032 series was cancelled after only a single unit was completed. Development In the era of Great Leap Forward, PLAN decided to indigenously develop a midget sub for coastal defense, and the midget sub was to adopt the newest hull form, the teardrop hull. Unlike the normal development process where approval is given first before work start, the design begun first and approval was asked and given afterward. Naval Engineer department of the People's Liberation Army Engineering Institute (PLAEI), the predecessor of Harbin Engineering University (HEU) was tasked to design the midget sub. The design team consisted of a team of student led by Professor Yu Hong-Sen (俞鸿森), and the design task was used as the student’s graduation project. Members of the design team would later become Chinese nuclear submarine designers, including Mr. Deng San-Rui (邓三瑞) and Mr. Ji Ke-Qin (季克勤). After all design drawing was completed, Mr. Deng San-Rui, Mr. Ji Ke-Qin would accompany Senior general Chen Geng, the dean of PLAEI to Beijing to ask the then Chief of the General Staff Senior General Huang Kecheng permission to develop the midget sub, which was subsequently given. The project managerial team of Type 032 series midget sub consisted of the leadership of the Shipbuilding and Repair Department (SRD) of the PLAN Headquarter (海军司令部修造部). The project manager was SRD director Senior colonel Lin Zhen (林真), deputy project manager was SRD political commissar Senior colonel Li Deng-Song (李登嵩), acting project managers were Senior colonel Xue Zong-Hua (薛宗华) and Senior colonel Ren Xiu-Sheng (任秀生). Due to the political upheaval in China at the time, namely, the Great Leap Forward, many other projects were also rushed into development, and most members of project managerial team were also assigned other tasks at the same time, and thus had very little time for Type 032 project. As a result, acting project manager Xue Zong-Hua was actually in charge of the project thorough out the entire development of Type 032. After all initial design drawings were completed, further developmental work was supported by the 702nd Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC). Contrary to the ordinary practice of building the production version after the prototype was successfully proven, in the heat of political zealousness at the time, it was decided to develop both the prototype and production version in parallel: subsystems of both would start at the same time, since most of them are same, while the construction of the hull of the production version would start before the completion of the prototype, thus overlapping each other. Such haste would eventually lead to the complete failure of the production version and eventual cancellation of the entire program. The prototype was designated as Type 032-1, while the production version entering service was designated as Type 032. Type 032-1 Type 032-1 is the unarmed prototype of the Type 032 series, and eventually, it is also the only one completed among the series. Political upheaval has caused numerous problems in that the subsystems could not be ready because many subsystems delivered was in such poor quality that they were rejected immediately upon inspection. Type 032 is powered by lead batteries used by railway cargo carts. Construction was finally completed in November 1958 at Jiangnan Shipyard, but sea trials had to be conducted at Lushunkou. The reason to select Lushunkou as the test site is because water depth averages only 70 meters in Lushunkou, much shallower than that of Shanghai region, so if accident occurs during sea trials, it would be easier to carry out rescue missions. In addition, Lushunkou is also the only base in China at the time where Chinese submarine fleet is stationed, and the commander of the base at the time, Major general Liu Huaqing provided great support to the program. In order to make the trip, Type 032-1 had to be first loaded on a barge at Jiangnan Shipyard to be shipped to the Shanghai railway station in the north via Huangpu River. The midget sub was then loaded on a flatbed railway cart to be transported to Lushunkou. Crew to conduct sea trials also traveled by the same cargo train, with a temporary hut built on one of the flatbed carts of the same train. After three days travel by railway, the midget sub reached its destination and was transferred to a pier at the base, with sea trials immediate followed. The testing team of Type 032-1 consisted a crew that included seasoned submariners such as Mr. Han Wen- Yun (韩文运), the captain of the boat, Chen Ji-Lin (陈吉林), the crew chief, Mr. Jing Li-Feng (荆聿封), Mr. Li X-Ju (李锡驹), data recording staff on board the boat. The test manager was originally Professor Wang Xu (王旭) of Tianjin University, but after being hospitalized in early April 1959 due to illness, deputy test manager Mr. Chen Hou-Tai (陈厚泰) assumed the responsibility of test management. Three sea trials were conducted, with the first one revealed the sub was a little unstable when going backward, and based on this discovered, the design was modified to incorporate an additional pair of stabilizing fins to resolve the issue. The second sea trial was to evaluate the batteries, which provide enough power to meet the designed speed at 9 kts. However, it was discovered more batteries were needed to provide greater endurance and range. The third sea trial was submergence test, which was successfully completed. However, because the sub performed much better than expected, testing crew remain submerge much longer than originally planned, causing people on the surface and land to mistakenly believe the sub had sunk due to lack of adequate communication means at the time. Further sea trials were planned but were abruptly cut short by orders of PLAN, due to an accident of People's Liberation Army Navy Submarine Force. At 1:40 PM on December 1, 1959, Chinese midget submarine National Defense 24 with hull number 418 (ex-Soviet M-class submarine No. M-279) sunk in a naval exercise after colliding with a frigate when surfacing, resulting in 38 out of 39 people on board killed. PLAN investigation and actions taken afterward lead to an audit across the PLAN, including reviews of all programs hastily rushed into development in the political zealousness of Great Leap Forward. Type 032 midget submarine was identified as a potential safety hazard because the design did not include any escape system for the crew, so further sea trials were stopped and the midget sub was returned to Jiangnan Shipyard to be modified. However, due to the political zealousness, the design of the escape system could not be completed because the poor quality and unavailability of the components, so incorporation of additional batteries was to be completed as the first step of modification. Type 032-1 was therefore lengthened an additional 2.7 meter to 16.7 meter to house more batteries to extend the range and endurance. Although the result was satisfactory, further work could not proceed due to the lack of other subsystems, which dragged on until another political turmoil that finally killed the Type 032 series for good, namely, the Cultural Revolution, during which Type 032-1 was finally sold for scrap. Type 032 Type 032 is the armed version of the midget submarine series. Unlike the lead battery powered prototype Type 032-1, Type 032 was to be powered by silver-zinc batteries and a water cooled diesel engines. The high performance silver-zinc battery is much more efficient than the lead battery used on the prototype and thus far less numbers of batteries would be needed, and the space saved would be used for two torpedoes and the diesel engine. However, due to the political turmoil in China at the time, the diesel engine was never completed even after the program was terminated, despite the fact that the development of such engine was already started before the construction of the prototype. The silver-zinc battery suffered even greater in that the poor quality caused a 100% rejection after delivery when inspected by Deng Rui-San and other inspection team members. As result, Type 032 could not proceed as planned, and came to a complete stop. However, the partially started Type 032 did find its greatest use in supporting its prototype Type 032-1, which was suffering from the same quality and unavailability of subsystems problems. To keep the schedule of the prototype Type 032-1, available and qualified subsystems of the stopped production Type 032 were used on the prototype, and further construction of Type 032 and its subsystems were stopped by the order of Senior colonel Yu Xiao-Hong (于笑虹), until qualified parts and resources become available. Although Type 032-1/032 program was cancelled after only a single prototype was built, it did provide PLAN significant know-how on teardrop hull and important program managerial experience, which was used on the development of future Chinese submarines to avoid the same mistakes.

The encoded protein forms homodimers which can associate into homotetramers, the enzymatically active form of glycogen phosphorylase. The activity of this enzyme is positively regulated by AMP and negatively regulated by ATP, ADP, and glucose-6-phosphate. This enzyme catalyzes the rate-determining step in glycogen degradation. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008] Structure The PYGB gene encodes one of three major glycogen phosphorylase isoforms, which are distinguished by their different structures and subcellular localizations: brain (PYGB), muscle (PYGM), and liver (PYGL). GPBB is the longest of the three isozymes, with a length of 862 residues, due to the extended 3'-UTR at the enzyme's C-terminal. Nonetheless, it shares high homology in amino acid sequence with the other two isozymes, with 83% similarity with PYGM and 80% similarity with PYGL. Moreover, both its nucleotide and amino acid sequences and its codon usage share higher similarity with those of PYGM, thus indicating that the two share a closer evolutionary descent by gene duplication and translocation of a common ancestral gene. A possible pseudogene can be found on chromosome 10. Function As a glycogen phosphorylase, GPBB catalyzes the phosphorolysis of glycogen to yield glucose 1-phosphate. This reaction serves as the rate-determining first step in glycogenolysis and, thus, contributes to the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. In particular, GPBB is responsible for supplying emergency glucose during periods of stress, including anoxia, hypoglycemia, or ischemia. In normal cell conditions, GPBB is bound to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane by complexing with glycogen. When stimulated by stress conditions, Under stress conditions such as hypoxia, glycogen is degraded and GPBB is released into the cytoplasm. Though GPBB is primarily expressed in adult and fetal brain, it has also been detected in cardiomyocytes and at low levels in other adult and fetal tissues. These other tissues also express PYGL and PYGM, but the purpose of expressing multiple glycogen phosphorylases remains unclear. Nuclear localization was also cited for GPBB in gastrointestinal cancer. Clinical significance=Cancer GPBB overexpression has been associated with several cancers, including colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Since GPBB is upregulated during the potential transition of adenoma cells into carcinoma cells, GPBB may be a useful biomarker to detect malignancy potential in precancerous lesions. Ischemia Since GPBB is released from the SR membrane under ischemic conditions, it may serve as a biomarker for early detection of ischemia. Specifically, its release in acute myocardial ischemia has been attributed to increased glycogenolysis and plasma membrane permeability, and has been correlated with poor outcome. As a highly sensitive marker for myocardial ischemia, GPBB may aid in detection of perioperative myocardial damage and infarction in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Meanwhile, GPBB levels are elevated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

He knows a lot of strip jokes, and often plays the fool but he's very respected nonetheless. After he is declared Viceroy of Musashi along Horizon, Tori gains access to one-fourth of the ship's energy supply, and by making a contract to the Asama Shrine he gains a special power that allows him to channel that energy supply to his allies, granting them limitless power. This ability is also used by Horizon to activate Ólos Phthonos and unlock the true power of the Mortal Sin Armaments in her possession. The condition for the ability to properly work is that he has to always be happy for the rest of his life, and a single flick of sadness at his heart may provoke a backlash that can kill him.

Terminology=General terms ;Testament :A history book that records the history of the former earth. To ensure mankind's eventual return to space, the original History is recreated by reenacting its main events in the chronological order with selected individuals reprising the role of historical figures of said events. For some reason the recreation of History is halted in 1648 with the last event predicted to be reenacted being the Peace of Westphalia. There are rumors that this occurs because the apocalypse is set to happen after these particular events. In these events, the Far East currently play a neutral role as by that time in the original History, Japan was under the Shogunate of Tokugawa, isolated from the rest of world, thus having little to no participation at all in events occurring overseas. ;Harmonic Divine States :Administrative divisions ruled by different countries in the Testament era.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built from 1902 to 1909. It is also known as Gaydon's Pharmacy and Tourist Information Centre. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Gaydon's Pharmacy is one of a row of shops erected in 1902 to the design of Bundaberg architect FH Faircloth, following a fire that destroyed most of the south side of Churchill Street, the main street of Childers. Faircloth was responsible for much of the new building following the fire, the effects of which transformed the appearance of Childers. Extended to two storeys in 1909, the pharmacy housed several important services to the town and, retaining extremely intact contents, has become a pharmaceutical museum in recent years. Childers is located in what was once the heart of the Isis Scrub. Following logging of the dense scrub in the 1870s, Childers was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into 50-acre farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. Thomas Gaydon arrived in Childers in 1894, four years after completing his pharmaceutical apprenticeship in Brisbane, and established \\"The Isis Pharmacy\\" as one of the first shops in the main street. He and William Hood needed to clear the block with axes and mattocks. Hood set up as a tobacconist and stationer. In September 1899, resub 18 of sub 3 of portion 840 was transferred to Thomas Gaydon and William Hood as joint tenants. This was probably the land on which their adjoining timber shops were built. 1902 was a very dry year and Childers had no fire brigade. On 23 March, a catastrophic fire swept through the south side of the main street in town, where virtually all the buildings were timber and closely built. Those stores destroyed were: S Oakley, bootmaker; FD Cooper, commission agent; R Graham, fruiterer; ME Gosley, tailor; Foley, hairdresser; M Redmond, Palace Hotel; WB Jones, auctioneer; W Couzens, fruiterer; H Newman, general storekeeper; WJ Overell and Son, general merchants; P Christensen, cabinet maker; W Hood, stationer; T Gaydon, chemist; W Lloyd, hairdresser; Mrs Dunne, fruiterer; Federal Jewellery Company; Dunn Bros, saddlers; H Wegner, bootmaker. The Bundaberg architect F H Faircloth was engaged to redesign new premises and called tenders for the erection of eight brick shops, including Gaydons, in June 1902. Frederic Herbert (Herb) Faircloth was born in Maryborough in 1870 and was a pupil of German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Faircloth set up his own practice in Bundaberg in 1893 and was very successful, eventually being responsible for the design of almost every major building in Bundaberg. He was also to have a major effect on the appearance and character of Childers. The new shops were masonry rather than timber, a choice no doubt influenced by the fire, and were elegant single-story buildings with large glass shop fronts. Striped curved awnings across the footpath were supported by decorative posts with cast iron infill. Each shop had a separate roof, some lit by lanterns and the individual tenancies were also marked by the visual separation of the facades by the use of classic revival pediments, urns, and balustrades. Gaydon's building with its broken semi-circular pediment matched the adjoining Hood's shop. Around 1909 an upper floor was added. This addition included the adjoining shop, so that a new and larger decorative pediment was created. A photograph dating from around 1913 shows that other tenants, including a bootmaker and the New Zealand Insurance Company, also used Gaydon's building. The upper floor was lit by a lantern and a pair of large compound windows and so had excellent light for its use a dental surgery by Thomas Gaydon, who in addition to his work as a pharmacist, also practised as a dentist, photographer and anaesthetist to the local hospital. He was a public-spirited man and also served as president of the Chamber of Commerce, School of Arts, hospital and School committees at various times. He was the second chairman of the Isis Shire Council in 1919 and served in this role again between 1924 and 1930. Following the death of Thomas Gaydon in 1935, the property was transferred to his two sons, T. Geoffrey Gaydon (a dentist) and S. Noel Gaydon (a chemist) who both practised from the premises. In 1938 Mervyn G Hooper joined the staff as a chemist and went into partnership with Noel Gaydon in 1956. When Noel Gaydon died in 1966, Hooper continued the business and the property was transferred to his wife in 1973. In 1982 Mervyn Hooper died and the then pharmacy was operated as a gift shop (with all pharmaceutical material retained) by his widow Isbell (known as Isa) Hooper. In 1987 the shop ceased trading and was acquired by a new owner. The Isis Shire Council leased the building, after purchasing the contents, catalogued items and carried out conservation work. In 1989 Gaydons Pharmacy opened as a pharmaceutical museum with an art gallery on the upper floor. The work undertaken by the Isis Shire Council to prepare the building for use as a museum, tourist office, and gallery received a National Trust of Queensland John Herbert Award for Conservation Action in 1989.  Description  The Pharmaceutical Museum is a two-story masonry building in a row of shops on the south side of Churchill Street, Childers main street. It is a rectangular building with its long axis at right angles to the street and has twin gabled roofs clad in corrugated iron concealed by a parapet. In common with a number of shops on this side of the street, the building has a classical revival pediment with a balustraded parapet topped by urns and is lit by a lantern. The date 1894 is shown in raised letters on the pediment with the name Gaydon's Buildings below. The upper floor is also lit by a pair of multi-paned windows with curved heads to the street and plain sash windows at the rear. The shop's front has a central recessed entry and display windows featuring lead lighting friezes and early signwriting. They are shaded by an awning to the street lined with decorative pressed metal. The interior is laid out with a shop at the front and offices and dispensary area to the rear. The upper floor is an art gallery. The interior is extraordinarily intact and includes furniture, fittings, counters, shelving, drawers and their contents and stock. Equipment such as the cash register and dental chair and tools and account and prescription books belonging to Gaydon's Pharmacy are preserved. The whole forms an archive of information on the operation of an early twentieth century pharmacy. 137 items from the Wickham House pharmacy in Brisbane have been added to the collection.  Heritage listing  The Childers Pharmaceutical Museum was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. It is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, showing the development of Childers in the early twentieth century and in particular the rebuilding of the south side of the main street in the early 1900s following the 1902 fire. Together with much of the southern side of Childers main street it provides evidence of the impact of fire on many Queensland towns with limited water supply. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is one of only two pharmaceutical museums in Australia and is very rare in retaining a high level of its own early fittings, equipment and stock. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. Because of this rarity, it has the potential to contribute considerably to an understanding of the work of early dispensing chemists, particularly in country towns where they might provide a wide range of services. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early 1900s country town masonry commercial buildings, in particular the awnings, shop fronts, lanterns, and overall form. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It contributes to the picturesque appearance of Churchill Street which is both remarkably architecturally coherent and intact. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Pharmaceutical Museum has strong associations with the Childers community as a provider of pharmaceutical, dental and photographic services for many years and is now an important community building. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the life and work of Thomas Gaydon, chemist, dentist, anaesthetist and photographer to Childers area, and also as the work of Bundaberg architect FH Faircloth.

Opened in 1934 as a multi-sport athletic field, it is currently the football stadium for Lewiston High School, located a few blocks to the northwest. The natural grass field runs conventionally north-south, with the main grandstand on the west sideline. The elevation of the field is approximately above sea level. It was formerly a minor league baseball park, the home field of the Lewiston Broncs from 1952 through 1974. The Broncs were in the Western International League (WIL) for the first three seasons and the Northwest League (NWL) for the following two decades, which changed to short- season play in 1966. Bengal Field also hosted the Lewiston Indians for two seasons, one in the Class B WIL in 1937, and in the Class C Pioneer League in 1939. The first night game at the park was the opening game in 1937 on April 27. The WIL franchise moved northwest to Bellingham for the 1938 season, and the Pioneer League team was moved to Idaho Falls in eastern Idaho in 1940, closer to the rest of the league. The baseball diamond at Bengal Field had an unorthodox southwest alignment, with the setting sun in right field; the recommended orientation (home plate to center field) is east-northeast. Owned by the school district, the ballpark was also the home field for high school and American Legion baseball. It hosted the American Legion World Series in 1973. It transitioned into a football-only venue in the 1980s. The LHS Bengals last played baseball there in 1983, and used two venues in 1984, Harris Field at Lewis–Clark State College and Clearwater Park (), on the north bank of the Clearwater River. They now play at Dwight Church Field () in the southeast end of the city, about two miles (3 km) east of the Lewiston–Nez Perce County Airport, while American Legion baseball is played at Harris Field. Church (1925–94), LHS class of 1943, was the longtime head coach of the high school and Legion baseball programs.

It was designed by James Percy Owen Cowlishaw and built from 1900 to . It was formerly a branch of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney and is also known as the RSSAILA Club or the Isis RSL Club. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Commercial Banking Company of Sydney building, circa 1920 The Returned and Services League of Australia Club was erected in 1900 as the Childers branch of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited (CBCS). The bank was originally designed by architect James Percy Owen Cowlishaw as a single story building which in 1908 was raised to two storeys with the banking chamber located on the ground floor and manager's residence on the upper level. Following logging of the dense Isis Scrub in the 1870s, Childers, in the heart of the scrub, was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests, as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into 50-acre farm blocks. There was no official town survey and Childers was developed following private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also provided the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district: in the years between 1891 and 1900 the population grew from 91 to 4000. In 1903 the old Isis Divisional Board (1886) was abolished and Isis Shire proclaimed, with the new seat of municipal government moving from Howard to Childers. Whilst Queensland in general was slow to recover from the depression of the early 1890s and the 1893 banking crisis, the growth of commerce in Childers was attractive to banking institutions contemplating expansion. CBCS Bank opened its first branch in Childers, in rented premises, in 1897. Together with the Bank of North Queensland, who opened its branch in 1895, they were the first to capitalise on the need for banking facilities in the newly emerging sugar town. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney was formed by New South Wales interests in 1834; establishing its first Queensland branch at Maryborough by 1860. Within a few years it had constructed a substantial masonry building in Brisbane. It is not known from which premises the Childers branch operated initially, as the bank did not acquire the present site until April 1899. By March 1900, its new purpose-built banking chambers were close to completion. A photograph shows the new bank to have been single storeyed. Architect James Percy Owen Cowlishaw was architect to the Commercial Banking Company and designed many of its buildings in Queensland. Born in 1867 he trained with architect John James Clark and in 1885 he joined the Public Works Department for a short time as a cadet, returning to Clark's office in 1887. By 1896 he was in practice on his own account. Remaining in practice until the 1920s, his other work is known to have included the Brisbane Gas Company Offices, Petrie Bight and the Lady O'Connell Wing at the Brisbane Children's Hospital. In 1908 additions to the bank were carried out which involved raising the existing building and inserting a new storey at ground level with the banking chamber located on the ground floor and manager's residence on the upper level. Work was completed in January 1909. At the same time the bank purchased additional land to extend their frontage to the main street on the eastern side of the building. It is not known if Cowlishaw was the architect for the new work, though this is likely as he is believed to have still been the bank architect at this time. In 1922 the bank purchased additional land to the west of the building adding to their earlier purchase. On 25 January 1943 the Childers branch of the CBC closed with business sent to Bundaberg; bank correspondence indicating that this was part of a wartime rationalisation of their services. The property was sold to Emma Makin in 1944 and operated briefly as a boarding house. In 1945, it was acquired by the local branch of the Returned Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia (RSSAILA). In 1966 the name changed to the Returned Services League of Australia (RSLA). The building remains in use as the branch club house.  Description  The Childers RSLA club house is prominently located on the northern side of Childers main street, Churchill Street. It is a two story timber building with a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron. The facade detail is intact and features front verandahs to both levels supported on paired posts. These have slatted balustrading and decorative valancing to both storeys. The central entrance, which originally led to the banking chamber, is reached by steps to the verandah through a two storeyed porch. The verandah sides on the upper level have been enclosed by fibrous cement panels. The ground floor is used as a bar and club rooms and the first floor is used as a club manager's residence. There is a modern single storey extension to the rear which accommodates function rooms. The ground floor contains rooms which were offices and the former banking chamber which has an adjoining masonry strong room retaining its steel door. There is a corner fireplace faced with marble in what was probably the manager's office. A similar fireplace is on the upper floor. This floor is reached by stairs on each side of the building. At least one is a nicely detailed timber staircase with turned balusters etc. There are Honour Rolls on the ground floor for Isis District (World War I with additions for World War II), Doolbi and Horton (World War I with additions for World War II), and the CSR Childers Sugar Mill (World War I only).  Heritage listing  Childers RSLA Club was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The RSL Club building at Childers (formerly the Childers branch of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney) demonstrates the growth and prosperity of the Isis as a sugar district in the early 20th century and the establishment of banking institutions to serve an expanding rural economy. It also demonstrates the growth of associations for returned service personnel in Australia following two major wars in which many Australians served and their wish to continue wartime comradeship. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former bank building demonstrates a common early practice in the design of provincial banks in which accommodation was provided on the premises for the manager and his family. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The RSLA Club is a dominant feature of Churchill Street and by its scale, form and detail makes an important contribution to the townscape of Childers. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As an RSLA club house since the end of World War Two to the present, the building has an important association with returned service personnel in the district. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is also associated with the life and work of J P O Cowlishaw as Queensland architect for the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney and with the operation of that banking institution in Queensland.

He was best known for leading a team of seven editors tasked with creating a condensed version of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible. Born in 1927, he first began working in journalism while serving in the US Army from 1946–1948, after which he worked for a variety of publishing companies, mainly condensing literature. He retired in his early 60s, while still regularly writing and publishing novels. He died on 19 March 2015 in Monroe, Wisconsin, at age 87.  Life and career  John Evangelist Walsh was born in Manhattan, New York on December 27, 1927 to Thomas and Ann (née Cunney) Walsh. He was of Irish descent. Walsh attended high school at the now- closed Power Memorial Academy in Manhattan, and after his senior year, enlisted in the US Army, serving in the infantry in Trieste, Italy, from 1946 to 1948. It was during that time when Walsh first became involved in journalism, reporting and taking photographs for The Spearhead and The Blue Devil, two military newspapers. Following his two years of service, he enrolled at Iona College in New Rochelle, New York, but dropped out to take a job as a reporter The Oneonta Daily Star. He later worked as an editor at Prentice Hall, Simon & Schuster, and Reader's Digest, where he worked mainly on condensed-literature projects. He married his wife, Dorothy Schubis, on November 17, 1956 in Flushing, Queens, New York. Walsh's time at Reader's Digest marked an ambitious and unprecedented project: the condensation of the Bible, an enterprise that would make him and his colleagues well known on a national scale. According to John T. Beaudouin, the Reader's Digest Condensed Books editor during those years, the magazine had been eager to condense the Bible for a long time, but was not sure if it was feasible. He told The New York Times in 1982: > We condensed a 14-volume set of 56 classics for young readers in the late > 1960s, but the Bible had always been considered the ultimate challenge. We > weren't sure we could do it, but after we studied the text and found it > repetitive we thought we could. The first phases of planning began in 1975, and by 1979, a team of seven editors was assembled, with John Walsh as the director. The whole project, however, was placed under the supervision of the Rev. Bruce M. Metzger, a Presbyterian minister and esteemed biblical scholar and author. He served as the final say in what verses and chapters were necessary for inclusion. The team decided to condense the Revised Standard Version (RSV) rather than the King James Version (KJV) because the RSV language was simpler to begin with, in contrast to the older vocabulary and abstruse language found in the KJV. The RSV is 850,000 words long, and the team set out to remove repetition and unnecessary inclusions. Walsh installed a strict system for condensation: first, editors must consult three unique scholarly analyses of any given passage before editing it. After changes were made, it would be reviewed by a second editor, and then sent to Walsh for inspection. If the condensation was deemed adequate, it would be given to the Rev. Metzger for a final appraisal. In the end, around 55% of the Old Testament and 25% of the New Testament was expunged, a total of 40% of the Bible overall. Walsh commented to the New York Times on the difficulty of project in 1982 on the date of the Bible's release: > It was the hardest job I've ever done in my life. We were dealing with a > library of ancient literature with so many different literary forms to which > the condensation had to be adjusted and adapted. He then acknowledged he originally had qualms about the project, citing the Book of Revelation, which forbids changing \\"the words of the book of this prophecy.\\" However, his early doubts were replaced by satisfaction in the end, telling the New York Times 'Our Bible is still the word of God, but it's easier to get into and stay with and appreciate. The project in its entirety took three years, and the Reader's Digest Bible was released on 22 September 1982. While the Reader's Digest Bible was perhaps his most famous accomplishment, Walsh was a lifelong writer. He was moderately well known in the historical nonfiction and literary biographical genres, some of his better known books being The Bones of Saint Peter: The First Full Account of the Discovery of the Apostle's Tomb, Midnight Dreary: The Mysterious Death of Edgar Allan Poe, Poe the Detective: The Curious Circumstances Behind \\"The Mystery of Marie Roget\\", and Unraveling Piltdown: The Science Fraud of the Century and Its Solution. His books Midnight Dreary and Moonlight: Abraham Lincoln and the Almanac Trial were nominated for Edgar Awards, and Midnight Dreary and The Shadows Rise: Abraham Lincoln and the Ann Rutledge Legend were both finalists for the Lincoln Prize. His only award-winning publication was Poe the Detective: The Curious Circumstances Behind \\"The Mystery of Marie Roget\\", which won an Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime in 1969. After over 60 years in New York City, Walsh retired with his wife, Dorothy, to Monroe, Wisconsin, where he continued to publish books and write articles, mostly about Monroe and Green County history. He died on March 19, 2015 in a Monroe hospital, leaving behind nine unpublished texts, on such wide-ranging topics as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Frost, the Shroud of Turin, Pearl Harbor, and two mystery novels. His obituary reported that he was writing just one day prior to his death.

The conflict was fought between the British East India Company (EIC), which had taken over Malacca and its surrounding lands from the Dutch in 1824, and the Malay chiefdom of Naning which bordered Malacca. Various issues contributed to the conflict. These include the growing British interests in the Malay Peninsula as well as different understanding of the extent of British jurisdiction over and right to impose taxation on Naning. The British defeated Naning following two military expeditions and fully incorporated the territory under Malacca's jurisdiction. The conflict was one of the earliest examples of British intervention in the Malay states. However the high monetary cost of the conflict contributed to the subsequent decision by the British to adopt a less aggressive and military-based approach in dealing with the various Malay states. Instead, they relied on trying to influence the Malay states politically which culminated with the Treaty of Pangkor in 1874 and the introduction of the 'resident system'. Dol Said, the chief (Penghulu) of Naning, has come to be regarded as a nationalist hero in Malaysia today who had stood up to foreign aggression.  Background to the conflict  Naning was a small inland Malay chiefdom of about located about from the town of Malacca, located within the borders of the present-day Masjid Tanah constituency, along the border with Negeri Sembilan. Like its neighboring chiefdoms, it traditionally acknowledged the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Malacca and after Malacca's fall, that of the Sultan of Johor. However, since the 17th century, it had gradually come under the dependency of the Dutch in Malacca. This relationship was formalized in 1757, when the Sultan of Johor ceded his nominal rights of suzerainty over Naning and its neighboring chiefdoms around Malacca to the Dutch. However, Naning's position as a dependency of the Dutch appeared to be more nominal than real. Although the Dutch invaded and forced Naning to sign a treaty in 1643, whereby Naning would pay a yearly tribute of one-tenth of their produce and accept Dutch advice in governing, the treaty was never enforced. By 1765, the Dutch commuted the tenth to a nominal yearly tribute of 400 gantangs of paddy, which was about one one-thousandth of the total crop produced in Naning at that time. The Dutch also did not interfere with the administration of Naning, which was exclusively governed by its traditional Penghulus. During the temporary British occupation of Malacca from 1795 to 1818 when the Napoleonic war was raging in Europe, a treaty was signed between the British and the new Penghulu of Naning Dol Said in 1801. The treaty included a clause for the British to continue receiving the right to one-tenth of the produce of Naning as stipulated by the earlier 1643 Dutch treaty. However, this was commuted to a yearly payment of 400 gantangs of paddy due to the poverty of Naning. In 1807, the then British resident of Malacca also issued a directive depriving the Penghulu of his power of passing the death sentence although there were no evidence to indicate that this was enforced. The British formally took control of Malacca and its surrounding territories from the Dutch with the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. Following the takeover, the British started to examine the extent of its control over the acquired territories in order to maximize revenue from the lands. The then British governor Robert Fullerton took the 1643 Dutch and 1801 British treaties at face value and assessed Naning to be part of Malacca. He instructed for the Superintendent of Lands in Malacca, William Thomas Lewis, to conduct a census in Naning as well as an assessment of the potential of the land in anticipation of extending the Malacca land system, including the levying of a ten-percent tax on all produce, to Naning. There were also plans to transform the Penghulu of Naning Dol Said and his traditional chiefs into salaried revenue officials of the East India Company. However, Dol Said contested the British juridical claims over Naning and the imposition of the ten percent tax and chose to continue sending the traditional payment of 400 gantangs of rice instead. He also carried out what the British considered to be increasingly aggressive actions that challenged their rule. These include passing sentence on a murder case in Naning instead of referring it to Malacca as required under the 1807 directive as well as the seizing of some fruits from lands which the British considered to be part of Malacca's territories (Dol Said had claimed that the lands were Naning territory). These transgressions led Fullerton's successor governor Robert Ibbetson to decide in early 1831 on the need to send in British troops to punish Dol Said lest his resistance embolden the locals in Malacca to defy the British as well as to enforce British jurisdiction over Naning.  Causes of the conflict  As with most conflicts, the causes of the Naning conflict cannot be boiled down to just one or two factors. Instead, a confluence of various issues and factors contributed to the conflict.  Conflicting concepts of jurisdiction over Naning  One main cause of the conflict was over the uncertain status of Naning vis-a-vis Malacca. This stemmed in part over problems in interpreting the 1801 treaty between Britain and Naning and the earlier 1643 treaty signed between the Dutch and Naning. During a meeting of the Penang Council on 30January 1828, which discussed the status of Naning, the Resident-Councillor of Malacca, Samuel Garling, noted that the evidence based on the 1801 treaty and Dutch records \\"favours the independence of Naning\\" and that the British had \\"no ground\\" to claim sovereignty or jurisdiction over Naning. In particular, Garling pointed out the vagueness of the description of Naning as \\"Tannah Company\\" (company land) in the 1801 treaty and concluded that there was no \\"tenable ground\\" by which the British could establish a \\"claim of sovereignty\\" over Naning. Garling's assessment was supported by the acting Resident-Councillor of Penang, Anderson, who felt that the British right to subject Naning to the same government as Malacca was \\"not very clearly established\\". He felt that Dol Said should be considered an hereditary chief and has been exercising his rule without interruption, which was the prerogative of a sovereign in his own district. However, Fullerton disagreed and felt that based on the earlier treaties and Dutch records, Naning was completely under British sovereignty and that the Penghulu of Naning was like any of the other Penghulus appointed within Malacca territory and held his \\"powers of investiture from the Malacca Government\\". Fullerton regarded the 1801 treaty not as a treaty but rather as \\"articles or conditions\\" dictated by the then Governor of Malacca on Naning. He felt that Naning was \\"evidently a place subject to Malacca\\". Fullerton believed this to be substantiated by the Dutch records which indicated that the first ruler of Naning was appointed by the Dutch in 1642 who awarded him a seal of office as ruler of Naning. Prior to which, there had not been any single ruler over the territory. Fullerton thus believed that Naning had been an integral part of Malacca since Dutch rule in 1641 and that the British had inherited this when they took over Malacca from the Dutch. Part of this confusion was what academic Jonathan Cave had described as a \\"collision of systems\\" between the British's ideas of sovereignty and the concept of traditional Malay rule and governance which were based on Malay customs and adat. This was manifested in the different understanding by both sides regarding the exact nature of the land jurisdiction over Naning that Britain had inherited from the Dutch which was the cause of the conflict. To the British, Dol Said derived his authority and position from his appointment by first the Dutch and subsequently the British. However, in his exchanges with the British, Dol Said continuously referred to his jurisdiction over Naning as stemming from the adat or 'customs' of the Malays which vested in him the 'sacrosanctity' of Malay kingship. To his followers, Dol Said's legitimacy stemmed from his ability to trace his authority from the Malaccan kingdom as represented by regalia which was associated with Malaccan royalty. However, the British officials had been largely contemptuous or condescending towards the importance placed on these Malay customs in their reports, dismissing it simply an excuse to act against a centralizing authority.  Excessive taxation  Another factor which contributed to the conflict was the issue of taxation. Writing during that period of time, Munshi Abdullah noted in his autobiography (Hikayat Abdullah), that it has been the custom since ancient times for Naning to make annual payments according to its means to Malacca. This could take various forms including rice, poultry or fruit. Abdullah pointed out that although the Dutch had previously invaded Naning and compelled it to pay an annual tribute to Malacca. This was subsequently commuted willingly by the Dutch to a nominal payment of 400 gantangs of rice which Naning accepted and paid. However, Abdullah claimed that when the EIC had decided to impose a tax of one-tenth of all the produce of Naning and its dependent villages instead of the annual tribute, this was considered by Dol Said to be an excessive demand and he refused to comply with it. When the British attempted to collect the full tenth, the Malays had looked upon it as a breach of faith of what had been agreed as part of the 1801 treaty. There were also some fears by the neighboring chiefdoms that once Naning has been conquered, the same tax would be levied upon the adjacent chiefdoms as well. Part of the problem appeared to have arisen from the method by which Naning's output had been calculated by Lewis which greatly inflated the tax that could be collected. This probably colored the perception of Fullerton, leading him to make an incorrect assessment regarding Naning's potential tax receipts. Lewis had estimated that Naning could yield at least 753,450 gantangs of rice a year that the tax collected as part of the tenth (7,534 gantangs) would yield a revenue of $3,767 a year (currency unknown). However, this assessment appeared to have been compiled based on Lewis' own arbitrary assessment rather than any detailed study of the land in Naning. As Cave highlighted, Lewis did not appear to have taken into account the situation on the ground such as the variations in soil and types of crop nor did he conduct a topographical, cadastral or agronomic survey. After the conflict it was discovered that Naning could only produced around 130,000 gantang of rice and an annual profit of only $298.  British interests in Southeast Asia  The origins of the Naning conflict must also be understood within the larger geo-political developments in Britain and the Malayan Peninsula during that period. Academic Emrys Chew argued that there was a rethinking in the beginning of the nineteenth century among British leaders about the growing importance of Asia to British foreign policy interests. Coupled with this was the widely held belief among ordinary Britons that their empire would be imperiled without vigorous assertion of British power and influence in Asia. Both factors created the necessary conditions for local British officials in Southeast Asia to pursue a more aggressive policy. At the same time, local developments in the colonies during a period of colonial history which academic A.J. Stockwell described as a time of turbulent frontiers for the British in Southeast Asia also resulted in the British being willing to take a more interventionist approach in the Malayan peninsula. The wealth gained by the Straits Settlement from the burgeoning trade with China gave rise to stronger demands by British merchants for greater intervention in the Malay states to ensure the stability and security of the Straits Settlements. These led to several interventions by the British beyond the Straits Settlement into the Malay states in the early half of the 19th century of which Naning could possibly be considered the first.  Man on the spot  At the personal level is the crucial role played by several of the key British and Malay actors whose decisions and actions contributed to the conflict. Of note were the roles played by various British colonial officials, who were able to exercise power disproportionately greater than their positions and often at their discretion, given the administrative delays made inevitable by long distance communication between them in Malaya and their superiors in both India and Britain. In particular, the decisions made by British Governor Fullerton and his successor Ibbetson and the then-Superintendent of Lands at Malacca Lewis with regards to Naning, served to create the conditions necessary for the conflict to break out. American academic Lennox Mills highlighted that one of the main cause of the conflict stemmed from Fullerton's assessment that when the British had taken over Malacca from the Dutch, they had also inherited the legal rights the Dutch had previously secured to administer Naning. This led Fullerton to adopt an aggressive policy in seeking to enforce this right to levy and collect the tax from Naning. This was despite advice from other colonial officials such as Garling and Anderson who had longer local experience and who disagreed with Fullerton's assessment regarding the nature of Malacca's jurisdiction over Naning. Mills also argued that Fullerton's successor Ibbetson was at fault for deciding on pursuing the conflict with Naning despite his realization that the British's jurisdiction over Naning and the corresponding right to collect the tax was based on weak grounds. This was also in spite of instructions from his superiors in England to waive the tax during the lifetime of Dol Said. However, Ibbetson had justified the need to dispatch troops to apprehend Dol Said as the latter's successful defiance of the British could similarly encourage other Malaccans to refuse to pay their taxes. Another key British official who had a hand in the sparking off conflict was Lewis who as the superintendent of lands, served as the point man for the British in dealing with Naning. He was one of the keenest advocate for the British to exercise every legal right over Naning and had constantly pressed Fullerton to do so. Mills also attributed blame to Lewis for a series of mistakes (intentional or otherwise) which swayed Fullerton's decisions. These include inflating the amount of potential taxes collectable from Naning and translating letters from Dol Said in a manner which made the latter sounded belligerent. Lewis also misjudged the sentiments of the locals towards Dol Said which led to him making incorrect assessments and claims that the removal of Dol Said would be supported by the people in Naning. The key Malay actor was Dol Said, whose actions had also contributed to the onset of the conflict. In particular, he had reacted to the British demands in a manner which led to it being misconstrued by the British as a challenge to their rule. Prior to the conflict, the British in Malacca had made repeated requests in 1828 and 1829 for Dol Said to meet with Fullerton in Malacca to discuss some of the problems regarding the status of Naning. However Dol Said had refused and limited himself to corresponding through letters, which as Cave established, lent itself open to incorrect translations of key phrases and interpretations of meaning. Dol Said's actions during the period including hearing a murder case despite having been instructed to refer it to Malacca and confiscating fruits from trees on what the British considered to be Malaccan land were also interpreted by the British to be an act of opposing the state. This was especially in light of Fullerton's understanding of the former's position as simply an appointee of the state.  Outbreak of the conflict = First military expedition  The first military expedition to Naning left Malacca on 6August 1831. The force consisted of about 150 Indian sepoys, their British officers and an artillery train of 6-pounders. Lewis also accompanied the expedition as he was slated to be the superintendent of Naning once Dol Said was removed. In contrast, there were no known figures of the Naning forces although Ibbetson subsequently claimed that they numbered in their thousands. The British were initially optimistic about their chances. James Begbie, a British officer on the expedition noted that the force was regarded as \\"disproportionately large\\" for the job that it had to achieve and that the entire expedition was termed a \\"picnic\\". The expedition made good time in its travels to Naning. It soon inflicted the first casualty of the campaign when some sepoys fired upon and killed one of the military chief (Panglima) from Naning who Begbie claimed had tried to bar the expedition as soon as it crossed the border of Naning. (Dol Said claimed that the Panglima had been sent to escort the expedition.) However, things soon started to go against the British. The boats which were intended to ferry provisions for the expedition as it worked its way up the Malacca River to Naning soon ran aground due to insufficient depth of the river. Once the expedition crossed the border into Naning, they came under regular sniping from the Naning forces which soon contributed to the perception within the expedition that they were surrounded by an overwhelming enemy. The Naning forces also fell trees along the route of the expedition, forcing the British to expend much time and effort in clearing them whilst under fire. The expedition soon began to run out of rations and upon learning that Naning had received help and troops from the neighboring states including Rembau, a decision was made to retreat to the borders of Malacca. At the same time, panic begun engulfed Malacca when the rumor that the surrounding Malay chiefdoms were gathering to invade Malacca spread and there soon emerged repeated demands for the expedition to return to defend the town. The expedition eventually arrived back at Malacca on 24August 1831, three weeks after it had set off and having to abandon all its guns and stores along the way.  Preparations for the second expedition  Following the failure of the first military expedition, the British sought to break the alliance between Rembau and Naning. The British governor Ibbetson met with the chiefs of Rembau on 20January 1832 and secured their agreement to support the British in the latter's subsequent attempts to capture Dol Said. In return, the British reassured Rembau that it did not have territorial ambitions over the surrounding Malay chiefdoms and renounced whatever claims it might have had over Rembau and recognized it as an independent sovereign state. At the same time, the British began to receive reinforcements from India which raised the total number of troops to around 1,500 by the end of January 1832. The British government also made logistical preparations to ensure the success of their second expedition including expanding parts of the narrow road between Malacca and Naning. During this period, Dol Said contacted several individuals in Malacca requesting that they intercede with the British government on his behalf. Dol Said offered to return the artillery pieces the British had abandoned during the first expedition and to vacate his position in favor of either his son or nephew in return for no further action to be taken against him. However, the British government refused to deal with Dol Said unless the latter was willing to surrender unconditionally. At the same time Dol Said also continued making preparations for the anticipated British assault. He tried to reach out to some of the surrounding Malay chiefdoms and tried to convince them to ally with him again against the British but did not appear to have been successful.  Second military expedition  The second military expedition to Naning commenced on 7 February 1832. In contrast to the first expedition, the British advanced cautiously, sending out smaller detachments to secure key locations before the main body advanced. The British also received help from a contingent of men from Rembau. Resistance from the Naning forces were also less aggressive than during the first expedition. While they continued to snipe at the British, they did not try to stand up to the British advance until they neared Dol Said's home village of Taboh. Many of the Malay villages along the route of advance were also abandoned by their inhabitants before the arrival of the British. As the British approached Taboh, a number of the Malay chiefs under Dol Said also started to surrender to the advancing British forces, claiming that they had been coerced into supporting Dol Said. Dol Said made one final attempt to negotiate with the British in Malacca as the British troops approached his village. He met with a representative of the British on 4 June 1832 where he claimed that he had been tricked and misled by his advisers (including several Dutch merchants in Malacca) in his previous dealings with the British. He also claimed that his actions thus far were not directed against the British government in Malacca but rather against Lewis whom he claimed had intruded into his territory and killed one of his Panglima. He also offered to surrender if his terms were met (no details what these terms were) but which the British rejected. The British eventually reached Taboh on 15June 1832, after brushing aside some minimal resistance at the edge of the village. Most of the inhabitants and defenders had fled just ahead of the British arrival and the British occupied the town with ease. This brought an end to the Naning conflict.  Aftermath of the conflict  Dol Said fled from Taboh as the British closed in and sought safety in one of the neighboring Malay chiefdoms. The British issued a reward of 2000 Spanish dollars for his capture to little success. Dol Said eventually surrendered to the British on 4February 1834, in return for the promise of a pardon. After his surrender, Dol Said was permitted by the British to remain in Malacca where he was well treated. His presence was regarded by the British as a means of securing the goodwill of the local population as well as the neighboring Malay chiefdoms. Dol Said remained in Malacca until his death in August 1849. During this time, the British provided Dol Said with a house and some land in Malacca. They also provided him with a pension of 200 rupees a month. While in Malacca, Dol Said continued practicing as a traditional medicine man and remained well-respected by the Malay population. Following the conflict, the British incorporated Naning (presently known as Taboh Naning) more firmly into its fold and began to administer it as a district of Malacca. British laws were imposed and the British took over the appointment of the local Malay chiefs which had previously been the prerogative of the Malay chieftains such as Dol Said. A Malaccan of Dutch descent, J.B. Westerhout, was appointed as the new superintendent of Naning and charged with the responsibility of administering the territory and collecting the overdue land tax. Some of the former chiefs who had support Dol Said were also shipped to India to stand trial for their involvement in the conflict.  Legacy  The Naning conflict marked one of the earliest attempts by the British to safeguard their interests in Malaya through intervening into the interior Malay chiefdoms. However, the high cost, difficulties encountered as well as the limited monetary returns from the conflict resulted in the British adopting a less aggressive and military-based policy towards dealing with the rest of the Malay states for the next few decades. Instead, the British sought to expand their influence politically among the Malay rulers, culminating in with the signing of the Pangkor treaty and the creation of the \\"residential\\" system in 1874. Dol Said has been regarded as a hero in modern-day Malaysia and the state of Malacca. He has been portrayed in Malaysian history textbooks and the Malacca state government as a hero who had defiantly stood up to a world power and resisted the unlawful imposition of taxation by the British on his territories.  Historiography and scholarship of the conflict  The portrayal of the Naning conflict within the academic historiography of early British colonialism in Malaya has evolved over time as scholars take a more critical look at the conflict. The first records of the conflict were by British colonial officials who were either involved in the conflict such as Begbie, or had access to the British records of the event such as Thomas Braddell. The narrative of the conflict presented by these colonial officials following the conflict were generally bias towards the role of the British. It justified the right of the British to levy the tax on Naning and explained the military expedition as the forced response to the aggression and unreasonableness of the main protagonist, Dol Said, who had constantly refused the efforts by the British in Malacca to resolve the dispute peacefully. In this narrative, Dol Said and the local Malays were not provided with any agency or voice in explaining their resistance to the British. Instead Begbie labelled Dol Said as a \\"tyrant\\" what had \\"rendered himself obnoxious\\" to his people through his oppression and arbitrary exactions from them. The first challenge to this official colonial historiography of the conflict came from Mills in the 1920s, who like a number of American academics at that time, had been somewhat critical of the effects of British colonialism. Mills took a contradictory position to the earlier works by Begbie and Braddell in challenging the justification for the conflict. By re-looking the set of colonial documents produced during the conflict, Mills assessed that the entire Naning war had been an \\"egregious blunder\\" due to \\"hasty actions\\" taken by the British officials on the spot based on insufficient and incorrect information. Mills lay the blame for the conflict primarily on a series of blunders by the three key British actors involved, namely Governor Robert Fullerton and his successor Robert Ibbetson and the Superintendent of Lands William Lewis in their handling the situation prior to the conflict. Following the period of decolonialisation and the advocating of the ideas of autonomous history by academics such as John R.W. Smail, there was a shift towards trying to understand the Naning conflict beyond its colonial underpinnings. This has resulted in a growing trend to review and understand the conflict as a clash between two different systems during that particular period of time as well as providing greater agency and voice to the Malay actors involved. One example was Jonathan Cave who attempted to situate the conflict within larger regional developments at that time. Through his extensive monograph Naning in Melaka, Cave conducted an in-depth review of the primary British colonial sources and events leading up to the Naning war in order to understand if the conflict was inevitable. Unlike his predecessors, Cave did not sought to ascribed blame to any one side. Instead he argued that the conflict was the result of a \\"collision of systems\\" between the British's ideas of sovereignty during the onset of its early territorial expansion in Malaya and the Malay leaders who continued ascribing to their traditional customs and concepts of governance and rulership based on adat. Cave also argued that this clash of systems was manifested in the conflicting understanding of the nature of the jurisdiction over Naning that Britain had inherited from the Dutch which was one of the causes of the conflict. The most recent attempt to understand the conflict was by Emrys Chew who situated the conflict within larger regional and global developments. Chew went beyond the usual colonial records and examined new secondary sources that shed light on the nature of state and society in the Malay world. He argued that the Naning war should be understood as part of a deeper indigenous resistance and protest against the early onset of Western colonialism in the region. In particular, Chew argued that the conflict could be regarded as an example of the preliminary clash between the new ideas of colonial sovereignty being imposed by the British and the traditional notions of Malay rule which was being threatened. Chew pointed out that the British regarded Naning as a vassal territory whose ruler owed his appointment and authority to them whereas to the locals in Naning, the Penghulu was the de facto ruler of the territory with all the trappings of Malay rulership conferred on him through his regalia. Chew also attempts to situate the conflict within broader geo-political developments and British geo-strategic calculations. British officials in London, India and the Straits Settlements became increasingly mindful of Asia's strategic importance for trade and industry, and the need to secure Britain's expanding vital interest in resource-rich areas. This encouraged colonial officials to adopt a more proactive, interventionist approach toward neighbouring Malay kingdoms. Chew also introduces the concept of a British civilising mission, the moral imperative to bring the rule of law, sovereign authority and other norms of modern civilisation to a Malay society perceived as feudal and backward. It added momentum to British forward movements in Naning and the wider peninsula, thus contradicting every preference for cost-cutting non-interference.

Both versions present very different interpretations of the motivations behind the rebellion. However, what is agreed upon by both sides was that the rebellion was centered on “a venerable-looking bearded gentleman” - Haji Mohd Hassan bin Munas, known as Tok Janggut (Old Long Beard).  Overview  The rebellion began at a public meeting to discuss the new land tax when Tok Janggut killed a police sergeant who was attempting to arrest him on the 29 April 1915. The district officer of Pasir Putih, Abdul Latif escapes with his family along with all the money in the Treasury. Before fleeing, he had sent out a message to the British Adviser in Kota Bahru seeking for help. The British Adviser, upon receiving the news, dispatched a regiment of Sikh and Malay police officers to Juaran, a place located between Pasir Putih and Kota Bahru. News of the uprising reaches the Sultan of Kelantan, who sent two Malay ministers to arrest Tok Janggut and restore order. Tok Janggut demanded a full royal pardon as a condition for halting the uprising- a demand that was rejected by the Sultan. In the meantime, the rebels had occupied Pasir Putih town, ransacked government buildings and burned down several shophouses. The British authorities had sent a military force, the Malay States Guides (A Sikh Regiment) to Pasir Putih. On 24 May 1915, Tok Janggut and the rebels attacked the Malay States Guides where Tok Janggut was killed in the crossfire. The rebels are routed and Tok Janggut's body was taken back to Kota Bahru cand carried around on a bullock cart for members of the public to see. The body was then hanged in a public field before being taken down and buried about an hour later. Before investigating or debating the various causes which brought about the rebellion, it would be important to understand the location as well as the manner in which Kelantan was being administered to fully grasp the situation in which the rebellion arose. The segment below would show the manner in which Kelantan was being governed and how it affected the people during the various periods of change.  Administration of Kelantan (1902- 1915)  Although the Kelantan rebellion had been popularly viewed as a peasant uprising, it has to be noted that prior to the rebellion, there were changes to the administration which had eroded the privileges of the traditional leaders – chiefs, aristocrats and the ruler. This erosion of the traditional privileges had brought about the arousal of hostility and bitterness amongst the traditional leaders. Kelantan was brought under the control of British authorities who had made an agreement with Siam in the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1902 which saw the appointment of two British officers, W.A. Graham and H.W. Thomson to oversee the administration of Kelantan. Significantly, the British administration was able to bring under its control, 1904 square miles of mineral-rich land previously leased by the Sultan of Kelantan to a British entrepreneur-R.W Duff. In addition to acquiring the resource rich land, Graham also made some reforms to the administration. For example, he reaffirmed the status of the Sultan as well as restructured the government services and created some new departments, including a State Treasury. The State Treasury oversaw all payments and receipts collected for the administration. Graham also transformed the existing police force into a more efficient and responsible unit. New courts were also set up and they operated alongside the Muslim syariah court. To make administration more efficient, Graham also divided the British territory into three districts - Kota Bahru, Ulu Kelantan and Pasir Putih. Each of these districts would have their own magistrate, land officer as well as revenue collector. These actions eroded the privileges and power of the traditional leaders because previously, all revenue collected was done exclusively by the Sultan, his family as well as the members of the nobility but with Graham's reforms, the Sultan would have to be satisfied with what the British allocated to him. In order to avoid any form of rebellion, Graham appointed the Sultan's family members as head of the various government departments. This arrangement continued till 1909 when Kelantan was formally transferred from Thai to British control under the agreement of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. Graham's successor, J.S Mason oversaw new developments in Kelantan's administration. Among these changes was the formal recognition that Britain would oversee Kelantan's foreign relations and the Sultan would also agree to appoint a British Adviser and “to follow and give effect to the advice of the Adviser….in all matters of administration other than those touching the Mohammedan religion and Malay custom.”  Kelantan's District Administration 1903-1915  Graham's administration had appointed district officers to oversee the district and village chiefs. In the past, these district and village chiefs were responsible for the collection of taxes but under the British administration, the money was collected by the State Treasury which thus gave more power to the District Officers. In land administration, Graham had initiated a system that would differentiate land which was presented as a gift by the Sultan and which ones were sold between consenting parties. Graham's successors Mason and J.E. Bishop carried on with the system, albeit transferring land legal disputes from the civil courts to the Land Office. When W. Langham-Carter assumed the position of British Adviser, he introduced a land register which compiled the names of all the land-owners in Kelantan. This system was meant to create a more comprehensive British administration to be able to collect taxes more efficiently and to encourage the peasants to cultivate rice and other crops on the land. Langham-Carter then further enhanced this system by introducing a system where land taxes were based on four classes of land. Regardless of whether the land was being cultivated or not, all land-owners were to pay land-rent. This system came into effect on 1 January 1915.  Political conspiracy  During the years of 1900 up till the outbreak of the rebellion in 1915, it had been mentioned that the reforms initiated by the British administration had eroded some of the privileges previously held by the traditional leaders. Scholars have also pointed out that there was much Court intrigue within the Kelantan palace. Tuan Long Senik had succeeded Sultan Mansur in February 1900 and assumed the title of Sultan Senik after the latter's death but his ascension was not welcomed by members of the royal family. Among them would be Tuan Long Senik's uncle, Tuan Long Jaafar who was bypassed for the position as well as Tungku Chik Penambang who was overlooked for the position of Raja Muda – the next in line after the Sultan. Sultan Senik was rendered powerless as his relatives as they were allowed to veto his orders and amassed large estates of land. The grudge against the Sultan by his relatives was evidently apparent to W.A. Graham who mentioned that “Seven of the most powerful of his uncles and other relatives formed a league by the strength of which combination they extracted from him privileges to which, without such cohesion, they could never have aspired”.  Interpretations  The Kelantan Rebellion had been portrayed in a wide array because many scholars have disagreed as to what really caused the outbreak of the uprising. The rebellion had been seen and interpreted as; # A Jihad (Holy War) against Britain following the outbreak of World War One. In this war, Britain was part of the Triple Entente (An alliance consisting of Britain, France and Russia) who were fighting against the Triple Alliance (Consisting of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire). The Ottoman Empire was an Islamic nation and had called upon all Muslims to support its efforts against the British, French and Russians. This interpretation is a popular one in Malaysia, with school textbooks publishing this assessment of the reason for the Kelantan uprising. # A peasant rebellion caused by the unhappiness stemmed from the new land tax and the harsh methods used by the District Officer to collect these taxes # As a protest / rebellion against the Sultan for accepting British administration and an attempt to oust him from power. # As a political manoeuvre by the Sultan to strengthen his position and oust those against him.  The Rebellion as a Jihad (Holy War)  In this interpretation of the rebellion, much of the works done centred on Tok Janggut biography and life experiences and how this would shape his worldview to rebel against the British as part of a Jihad. Although there have been scant historical evidence which detailed Tok Janggut's personal life, the romanticised image of Tok Janggut as an Islamic warrior still remains strong in the psyche of the people in Malaysia. Much of the interpretation stems from folk tales which depict him as a freedom fighter who would resist even the Sultan for fighting what he believed was a just cause and that he was considered to be “a man of some learning and consequent repute in an unlettered community”. His years of sojourn in Mecca implies that he was a religious man and that would be used by later generations of historians to portray him as an Islamic militant who launched Jihad, despite there being no historical evidence to show that his rebellion was done in the name of Islam. Nevertheless, the political context in which the rebellion took place did offer a point of argument why some historians portrayed the rebellion as an Islamic struggle. In 1915, Britain was involved in the First World War and this took a drain on its ability to fully control its colonies. Scholars have also pointed out that the British also had faced problems from within its own ranks where the Muslim soldiers from the Indian regiment were unhappy at rumours that they would be sent to Europe and fight against the Ottoman troop- their Muslim brethren. This unhappiness from the Indian soldiers led them to conduct a mutiny against the British authorities in Singapore. This event came to be known as the Singapore Mutiny (also known as the Sepoy Mutiny) and lasted from January till March 1915 before the British were able to restore order and had the mutineers executed. Nevertheless, this mutiny signalled to the leaders in Kelantan that the British were losing the war in Europe and that they would not be able to deploy reinforcements in time to quell their uprising. Despite the lack of evidence that the rebellion was carried out as a Jihad, many generations of historians have tried fitting him into this image as a righteous Islamic warrior. For example, in Yahya Abdullah's 1955 book, Peperangan Tok Janggut, atau Balasan Derhaka shows an image of a handsome, well-groomed man with a white pointed beard and turban on his head. Similarly, in Rubaidin Siwar's Pemberontakan Pantai Timor (1980), Tok Janggut was portrayed with a turban, a long beard and a newly added long robe which makes him appear to look like an Islamic radical- this image fits the context of the time whereby there was a rise in the international radical Islamic movement. The sustainability of this romanticised portrayal of Tok Janggut had much to do with much of the information and pictures not being made publicly known, which places an air of mystery and intrigue over the entire rebellion. However, by allowing the romance of Tok Janggut to remain, it keeps emphasising ideals and fantasies at the expense of reality. One such sentiment that has continued to be told was that Tok Janggut was invulnerable and skilled at Silat (a form of Martial arts practised mainly in the Malay Peninsula). As the anthropologist James Boon analysed the term “romance”, he points out that; “Romance portrays vulnerable, disguised protagonists, partial social misfits who sense surpassing ideals and must prove the ultimate feasibility of actualising those ideals often against magical odds…..Romance properly concerns champions rather than heroes…..they are surrounded by signs and tokens of semi-miraculous birth, prone to mythical insights, and are acquainted with the natural and rustic orders more intimately than their privileged aristocratic counterparts.” Despite the shortage of evidence suggesting a political Islamic awakening behind the rebellion, some scholars have engaged in inserting present-day concerns into the historical interpretations thus portraying a romanticised image of Tok Janggut which would cause “prejudices and preconceptions to slip in unnoticed and skew our reading of the evidence”.  Unhappiness stemming from the new land tax  Langham-Carter had initiated a new system of land tax whereby all land owners were to pay land-rent whether the land was being cultivated or not. Failure to pay their taxes on time would result in further penalties, usually a fine and are forbidden from using the plot of land for their cultivation for the next year. This policy was greeted with unhappiness amongst the large landowners especially members of the royal family who felt that such taxation laws would hinder their desire to gain more land under their own control. Under this policy, even the Sultan was not exempted from paying the land tax when Langham-Carter insisted that the Sultan had to pay $1800 a year for a 3000-acre plot of land. Before the land tax was initiated, farmers in Kelantan were paying their taxes based on what they produced (Produce tax). When Langham-Carter implemented the land tax, it was meant to actually replace the Produce tax but this was not properly explained to the people in Kelantan. Now, the peasants saw the land tax as an addition to the tax they were already paying for their produce hence increasing their financial burden and frustration towards the British authorities. Apart from their financial frustration, they were also unhappy that the District Officer responsible for the collection of taxes was not appointed from amongst the locals but instead was appointed from outside Kelantan. This aversion to be accountable to someone not from the area was already seen during the time of W.A. Graham when in 1905, appointed Encik Ibrahim as District Officer for Pasir Puteh. Encik Ibrahim was from Singapore and the district officer overseeing the tax collection in 1915 was Che Abdul Latif, also from Singapore. This suspicion of outsiders was further aggravated especially since the district officer, who was usually understaffed, took a long time to collect the taxes from the peasants. The peasants were subjected to long queues before they were able to pay their dues. Matters were also not made more conducive especially when the officials were often high handed towards the peasants when collecting the taxes. Such actions only served to create mistrust and suspicion among the peasants towards the British authorities who were not more understanding of the struggle of the peasants. Their frustration was further heightened in 1915 when most of the peasant's land yielded a poor harvest but were not exempted from paying their land tax. On top of that, the long queues at the District Officer's headquarters meant that some of the peasants were in the queue for three consecutive days. Among those in the queue were Tok Janggut and a few of his followers who, after getting tired of waiting, simply left the area. For this act, the district officer, Che Abdul Latif would dispatch Sergeant Che Wan to arrest Tok Janggut for his alleged refusal to pay his taxes. Tok Janggut, along with other influential local leaders would instigate the peasants to rebel against the land tax which was deemed to be too punitive onto the peasants. Sergeant Che Wan would eventually be stabbed to death after a heated argument with Tok Janggut and this would then officially start the Kelantan Rebellion in 1915. The peasant rebellion in Pasir Putih mainly highlighted the point that the peasants were unhappy at having to change their traditional way of life, including the way in which their taxes were being accounted and collected. They had felt that the newly implemented British laws had burdened and made their lives more difficult than it used to be. On another note, the British tax laws had also neglected to address Islamic law with regards to land ownership and tax. The Islamic law in question was based on the principal of effort or Ihya rather than land. This principle differed greatly from the British model of taxation and when complaints to the British authorities went unheeded, the peasants joined in the rebellion led by Tok Janggut as a platform to express their discontent at the British policies.  A rebellion against the Sultan and an attempt to oust him from power  The reluctance of local, principally Malay Muslim, scholars to examine the anti- feudalist nature of Tok Janggut's rebellion can be attributed to the sacrosanct image that the Malay rulers enjoyed until Malaysia's landmark 1993 constitutional amendment that removed their immunity from criminal charges. Under this section, the rebellion was carried out by Tok Janggut as part of an anti-royalty or lese-majeste action. According to this interpretation, the rebellion was seen to be a criticism of the Kelantan Sultan relationship with his people as well as the role and conduct during the rebellion. Although this interpretation is not found within the official Malay and British narrative, it does provide an interesting account over why the rebellion took place. Tok Janggut was a commoner, glorified by the people as he resisted the British government in the cause of social justice and political freedom, defying the Sultan's authority because of the latter's support of British policies as well as his own quest for personal revenge against the Sultan. This story is presented mainly as a form of conflict between tradition and modernity, and between resistance and authority. It can also be interpreted as a subtle critique of the Malay feudal leaders and the values that they uphold. Tok Janggut defied feudal authority, just like his father, Monas had before him. Monas had two sons, Mat Tahir and Mat Hassan (Tok Janggut). Mat Tahir was killed by a retainer of the Sultan. When Monas tried to appeal to his master, Tungku Seri Maharaja Tua for justice to be served, his pleas were largely ignored. Monas became angry and sought to ruin his master's life. He took his master's favourite concubine, Wan Serang Bulan against her will and when this information reached his master's ears, he had Monas executed. Monas was killed just as he was bending down to scoop water to wash his face before prayers. His executioner, Pak Sulung Bulat had thrust a spear into the neck of Panglima Monas. This execution occurred just before Mat Hassan returned from Mecca where he had left to seek religious knowledge and to perform his pilgrimage, which was one of the five obligations of Islam. He was a man who was always willing to assist anyone in hardship, regardless of race. He also hated any oppressor and would take actions to ensure that people who oppress others were punished. Hence, when the opportunity to seek revenge for his father's death presented itself, Tok Janggut would use the opportunity to galvanise the peasants to rebel against the British authorities. When the Sultan tried to negotiate with the rebels by sending two of his ministers, they defied his authority. This would then prompt the Sultan to declare the rebels as penderhaka (treasonable behaviour) and to seek British assistance to quell the rebellion. The actions of the Sultan would corroborate J. de V. Allen's study which states that several members of the royal family, especially the uncles were collaborating with Ungku Besar, the Pasir Putih chief in a bid to oust him. Allen pointed out that by the Sultan seeking the British help; it showed that his authority within the royal circles was not strong that he had to seek British assistance to defend his position on the throne. The Sultan's “Double Game” The Sultan is traditionally viewed as a willing partner in adapting to the changes in administration in Kelantan who would administer the state on the advice of the British Adviser. Most scholars had stayed away from examining the role that the Sultan played due to the lese-majeste law in which the Sultan and others of the royal family could not be criminally charged under the Malaysian constitution. Thus, any charge against the Sultan was brushed aside and kept away from public knowledge. After the rebellion broke out, W. Langham-Carter had accused the Sultan of playing a “double-game”- a charge that was levelled against the Sultan after the British authorities had absolved him from any blame in the rebellion. Nevertheless, newly available British colonial records have shown that unlike the cooperative pro-British individual, the Sultan was in fact sympathetic towards the rebels and was able to manipulate events to oust Langham-Carter from his position as British Adviser. Prior to the outbreak of the rebellion, it was officially recognised that the Sultan and Langham-Carter had some disagreements over several issues. The major disagreement was with regards to the conduct of the District Officer Che Abdul Latif. The Sultan had sent a series of petitions, showing his displeasure at Abdul Latif's temperament and treatment of the local population. Langham-Carter, sided with Abdul Latif and disagreed with the Sultan's assessment and pointed out that Abdul Latif's actions were in line with his enforcing of the British land laws at the time. The Sultan had also petitioned on three occasions to the Governor to have Langham-Carter replaced which showed just how fractured their relationship were. A sore point mentioned by the Sultan was the fact that Langham-Carter had an inadequate grasp of Malay and of Malay customs. When the rebellion broke out, disagreements broke out between Langham-Carter and the Sultan over how they should manage the situation. The Sultan had wanted to use his own local forces and resolve the matter through negotiations. Langham-Carter, on the other hand had wanted a quick and decisive military victory and hence summoned for military assistance from Singapore. The Sultan was accused by Langham-Carter and other British officials as minimising the seriousness of the rebellion because prior to the arrival of British reinforcements, it was agreed that the Sultan would use his own officials and armed levies to meet the rebels and would hand complete control over to the British once their reinforcements arrived. This was something that the Sultan kept trying to prevent over the next few days. A few other incidents raised the British suspicions that the Sultan himself was involved in the rebellion. Firstly, despite the increased tensions which saw the Sultan intensify security around the palace, he was not agreeable to the rebels offer to stand down in return for a royal pardon, something that the British saw as the Sultan minimising the seriousness of the threat. Secondly, when the Sultan's minister Dato Setia returned from his negotiation with the rebels, he gave much information regarding the numbers, dispositions as well as the rebel plans which the British suspected as being concocted to prevent action by the British troops. Furthermore, the British troops encountered delaying tactics by the local population to make their passage as difficult as they could. Nevertheless, the Sultan was unable to obstruct the British force, which eventually arrived to deal with the rebels. The Sultan eventually issued draconian proclamations against the rebels and when the uprising was eventually brought back to order, the Sultan issued another proclamation that saw the residents of Pasir Putih having to pay a fine within 15 days or risked having their house burned to the ground. It was interesting to note that the Sultan was able to portray himself as being accommodating towards the British officials by issuing punitive fines to show his support towards the British and yet at the same time project suspicious behaviour which saw the British seeing the Sultan as being in cahoots with the rebels themselves. This delicate balancing act by the Sultan ensured that the British could never implicate him as a recalcitrant ruler. Overall, compromise, accommodation and opposition had been the changing strategies of the Sultan in his political game with Langham-Carter and other British officials. But what seems to have contributed to his eventual triumph was probably the Sultan's correct reading of the minds of his British antagonists. He would eventually get his request accepted in seeing Langham-Carter removed from his position and replaced by R.J. Farrer, a man the Sultan had requested as the British Adviser in his initial request to the Governor.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and exploration/settlement. It was nominated for its association with the settlement and organization of the Lakeland area and as a rare surviving example of mid-19th-century Greek Revival architecture in Minnesota. Description The Captain John Oliver House is a two-story building with clapboard siding. Greek Revival elements include corner pilasters with simple entablatures topped by gable-end pediments, dog-eared window moulding, and a front door flanked with small pilasters, a transom window, and sidelights. There is also an arched Gothic Revival window in the center of the front gable. The house has been expanded with a front porch and additions to the side and rear, but retains its original architectural features. History John Oliver was an Englishman who attained the rank of captain in the British Royal Navy before emigrating to Massachusetts in 1820. He worked as a maritime pilot on Boston Harbor for over two decades, then relocated to Minnesota. He and his family were among the first settlers of Lakeland Township in 1848. Oliver operated a ferry on the St. Croix River between Lakeland and Hudson, Wisconsin, from 1850 until his death in 1869. His sons George and Charles were instrumental in organizing the town government of Lakeland while another son, John Oliver, Jr., founded the local school.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  This set of four shops was erected in two stages in the early 1900s in Childers main street for Johann Wilhelm Albert Kulick, owner of the adjoining Grand Hotel. The first set of two (102 and 104) was erected between 1902 and 1907, the second set of two (106 and 108) was erected . The town of Childers grew up around a railway terminus opened in 1887 to facilitate timber getting in the Isis Scrub. By 1903, when the Isis Shire Council was formed, Childers had become the administrative centre of a prosperous sugar growing region with several local sugar mills and a large seasonal population, including, until the turn of the century, Kanaka labourers, who came to cut cane. From the 1950s increasing mechanisation in the sugar industry resulted in a decreasing population. In the 1980s, Childers, whilst remaining a \\"sugar town\\", also became known as a \\"heritage town\\", with much of the main street being listed by the National Trust as part of a conservation area. In common with a number of other Queensland towns, Childers was surveyed as a private town rather than by surveyors appointed by the colonial government. In the 1890s much of the main street, including this site, was subdivided into small allotments. In 1894, Frederick John Charlton and Henry Jardine Gray sold the site containing to William Ashby. Ashby also owned the adjoining block on which stood the Childers (later Grand) Hotel. In 1897 the property was sold to Kulick. A single storeyed timber store known to have been on the site by 1900, may have been financed by a mortgage for Kulick took out in 1897. In March 1902 fire destroyed many of the shops along the southern side of Childers' main street, which were subsequently replaced by masonry buildings. The timber store, then known as Martin's auction rooms, was however, spared. By 1907, the timber shop had been replaced. The first set of two masonry shops (102 and 104) was erected on the eastern side of the site. About this time, the Comino Bros established a fruit and refreshment business in no 102; no 104 was occupied by the local newspaper, the Isis Recorder. By , the second set of shops was erected, with Dittmer's Book and Stationery store occupying no 106 for some fifty years. At the time of heritage listing, tenants were Weller's Shoe Shop (102), two cafes (104, 108), and a real estate office (106). In 2015, the building houses a real estate office (102), a bakery (104), an Indian restaurant (106) and a Vietnamese restaurant (108). The shops were purchased by the Comino brothers in 1925. Their fruit shop was then moved from no 102 to no 108, where it remained until the 1960s. John, Paul, George, and Arthur Comino arrived in Childers from the Greek island of Kythera in the early 1900s. Soon after they established the fruit and refreshment business in the town, and later the Marble Cafe at 58 Churchill Street, which Paul Comino ran, until his death in 1978.  Description  102-108 Churchill St comprises two pairs of single-storeyed rendered masonry shops with pitched corrugated iron roofs. The shops are united by a common parapet and awning. The building abuts the two storeyed Grand Hotel to the west, and continues the line, scale and form of awnings and parapets of Churchill St to the east. Nos 102 and 104 are modest shops with arched brick voussoirs and hipped roofs to the rear, while nos 106 and 108 are longer skylit shops with concrete lintels and parapeted gables to the rear. The shops have a gently curved corrugated iron awning supported on an exposed timber frame and square posts. Like many awnings on Churchill Street, it creates a space of generous proportions. The posts have an idiosyncratic variety of bases. Ornamental detail to the building includes cast iron valances and trim to the awning, and flat-ended pediments rising above the cornice line, which are interspersed with gabled capping to externally expressed piers. The parapet is a modest version of the pedimented parapets further along Churchill Street. The tall shop fronts to nos 106 and 108 have large timber beaded display windows and recessed central timber French doors. The shopfronts are separated by rusticated piers. The display window to no 106 is particularly fine and intact, retaining its timber stall risers, internal glazed and gridded timber panels and external coloured and frosted glass panes above the display area. Both shops have recessed timber French doors, tall fanlights, and fanned patterns in the ceiling panels above the door. Internally, nos 106 and 108 are impressive shop spaces with high ceilings, a central clerestory skylight and exposed Queen post trusses. The ceilings are timber boarded, half-raked, and have square lattice vents. Nos 102 to 104 have flat timber boarded ceilings with central sheeted areas indicating that skylights have been closed off. The floors have patterned sections of ceramic tiles towards the front of the shops. The shopfront to no 102 is timber beaded with a central recessed entry, while the shopfront to no 104 has been more recently replaced with aluminium sliding doors. 102-108 Churchill Street contains two impressive shop interiors (106, 108), fine shopfronts, and contributes in form, scale, and materials to the architecturally coherent Churchill Street streetscape.  Heritage listing  The Coronation Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Shops at 102-108 Churchill Street, Childers, erected in the early 1900s, are important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, being evidence of the development of Childers in the early 20th century as a prosperous timber and sugar town, forming the heart of the Isis Shire, and in particular the rebuilding of the south side of the main street in the early 1900s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of both an early 1900s country town commercial building in general (particularly the parapets, awnings, shop fronts, overall form and, in the case of Nos 106 and 108, the interiors) and early 1900s Childers commercial buildings in particular, (particularly the form, scale, materials and, in the case of Nos. 106 and 108, the interiors). The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by the Childers community and visitors alike, in particular the spatial proportions, exposed trusses and clerestory lighting of Nos 106 and 108, which contribute to impressive shop interiors; the fine intact shopfronts, in particular of No 106; and the building's contribution in form, scale, and materials to the architecturally coherent and picturesque Churchill Street streetscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the life and work of the Comino family, a characteristic Greek immigrant trading family, and with the Dittmer family (106).

History  After the defeat of the Revolt of Mytilene, when Alcidas was anchored at Ephesus, a deputation of Samians from Anaia came to him. Anæa was important enough in the Roman province of Asia Prima to become a suffragan bishopric of its capital Ephesus's Metropolitan Archbishopric. Yet it would fade. In 1413 it was conquered by the Ottomans.Paw prints from eighth century found in ancient castle in Turkey’s west  Archeology  Archaeologists discovered many ceramics. The presence of so many ceramics in different colors, shapes and designs confirms that there was a rich production capacity in Anaea. They also revealed paw prints of cats and dogs on bricks and tiles dating back to the 8th century. These traces belong to animals which walked on these potteries when they were left to dry by producers. There is also a castle which served as an acropolis for many years and was home to a church built in the 5th century. After the Ottomans conquered the city they build a mosque next to the church.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built from to 1930s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Comino brothers' cafe and fruiterers, circa 1920 54–58 Churchill Street, comprising three shops and a cafe, was erected in Childers' main street, for local farmers Robert Gant and William Brand. The town of Childers grew up around a railway terminus opened in 1887 to facilitate timber getting in the Isis Scrub. By 1903, when the Isis Shire Council was formed, Childers had become the administrative centre of a prosperous sugar growing region with several local sugar mills and a large seasonal population, including, until the turn of the century, Kanaka labourers, who came to cut cane. From the 1950s increasing mechanisation in the sugar industry resulted in a decreasing population. In the 1980s, Childers, whilst remaining a \\"sugar town\\" also became known as a \\"heritage town\\", with much of the main street being listed by the National Trust as part of a conservation area. In common with a number of other Queensland towns, Childers was surveyed as a private town rather than by surveyors appointed by the colonial government. In the 1890s much of the main street, including this site, was subdivided into small allotments. The site (known as resub 9) was acquired by William Thompson and Robert Dinnie of Childers in 1895 from Frederick John Charlton and Henry Jardine Gray. In the following year it was transferred to Robert Hancock; after his death in 1898, it passed to trustees. By 1900 a single skinned timber shop, probably known as Cocking's store is known to have been on the site. In March 1902 fire destroyed many of the shops along the southern side of Childers' main street, which were subsequently replaced by masonry buildings. The timber store on resub 9 was, however, spared. In 1908, the property was acquired by Gant and Brand. By 1912, the timber shop had been replaced by the existing masonry building, believed to have been designed by Bundaberg architect, FH Faircloth, who was responsible for the design of many of the new buildings erected after the 1902 fire. In that year, resub 9 was subdivided. Sub 1 (nos 54 and 56) remained with Gant and Brand; sub 2 containing the Marble Cafe (no 58) was acquired by John Comino. The Comino brothers, John, Paul, George, and Arthur arrived in Childers from the Greek island of Kythera in the early 1900s. Soon after they established a fruit and refreshment business in the town, apparently at 102 Churchill Street (Coronation Building). The Marble Cafe was established in the new building erected by Gant and Brand. The business comprised a fruit shop, wine bar, and cafe, which catered to the large population of workers associated with the surrounding sugar farms. The cafe was furnished with silky oak fittings, potted palms, and tables with Italian carrera marble tops, which gave the cafe its name. The cafe was run by Paul Comino until his death in 1978, after which time the fittings were sold. Sub 1 (nos 54 and 56) remained in the ownership of Gant and Brand, and their respective estates, until 1959. It is not clear whether this part of the building was erected as one or a number of shops. However, it appears, that by the 1930s, it contained the three existing shops. For twenty years from the early 1930s, part of no 56 was leased to the Union Bank of Australia Ltd (now the ANZ Bank). Alterations including the installation of bars over the bank windows (part of no 56); the installation of a glazed shop front to the adjoining shop (part of no 56); and alterations to the awning of the building including sheeting the timber soffit with pressed metal may have been carried out about this time. Tenants of the other shops at this time were tailor, A Crossley (54) and the local newspaper, the Isis Recorder (part of no 56), who remained a tenant until the 1980s, taking over the bank premises as well from the 1950s. More recently, the shop at no 54 was used as electoral offices for the local Parliamentary members. Since 1959, when Paul Comino acquired the three shops, members of the Comino family have owned the four premises comprising the building. The shops are currently occupied by a florist (54), St Vincent de Paul (56), a dress shop (56), and the Marble Cafe (58).  Description  54-58 Churchill Street is single-storeyed rendered masonry building with pitched corrugated iron roofs, comprising four internally disparate shops which are united by a common parapet and awning. The building is similar in materials, scale and parapet features to other commercial buildings on Churchill St. It is located on a bend at the eastern end of the street, and contributes significantly to the picturesque townscape of the street. The building sits on a wedge-shaped block, and has a truncated eastern frontage. The different shops reflect their different uses: no 54 is a small shop with a single display window; no 56 comprises two shops, a former bank, more generously proportioned than its neighbour, which has a rendered masonry street facade, and a narrow shop with a two display windows and a central entrance; no 58 is a large skylit cafe with two entrances and three display windows. The street facade which links these shops comprises a substantial parapet, a flat sheet metal awning, shopfronts combined with a rendered brickwork facade. The awning is supported on turned timber posts which have an idiosyncratic variety of bases. It has a pressed metal ceiling with rich geometric floral motifs, and metal roses which are centred over each shop entrance. The front parapet has prominent features, with three recessed and framed panels topped with arched and triangular pediments rising above a deep cornice. The panels are spaced with expressed piers, and shaped parapet tops run between the pediments. The building has fine intact display windows, with delicate timber beading around broad glass panels, recessed entrances with timber double doors, and timber stall risers. No 58 has a central bay supported by two internal columns with fanned capitals. Nos 58 and the shop at no 56 also retain their internal glazed and framed panels to the back of the display windows. The former bank at no 56 has barred rectangular windows with toothed white cement-rendered surrounds. No 58 has a generously proportioned and impressive internal space, with a high timber lined half-raked ceiling with metal roses, a central rectangular clerestory skylight and exposed hammerbeam trusses. No 58 also has a timber lined and sheeted \\"clubroom\\" to the rear which is externally clad in weatherboard. The shop at no 56 has a flat timber boarded ceiling with several evenly-spaced funnel-shaped skylights which have been sealed over. The former bank at no 56 also has a timber lined ceiling, with metal roses, and contains a now disused rendered concrete strong room. All of the shops have areas of diamond-patterned ceramic tiled floors. 54-58 Churchill Street has a fine decorative facade, awning and shopfronts. No 58 has an aesthetically impressive interior, whilst other interiors appear to relate strongly to their former uses. The building makes a significant contribution to the picturesque townscape of Churchill Street, in its location, form, scale, and materials.

The estate is associated the former 18th-century Hellebæk weapons factory and has also housed the Royal Danish Orphanage. It now houses a private primary school. History=Early history Hellebækgård was originally a tenant farm first mentioned in 1576 when it was called Teglstrup but it was later used by Christian IV and by the managing board of Hellebæk Ironworks. It was acquired by the manager of the weapons factory and became known as Hellebækgård in 1728. Stephen Hansen's Hellebækgård Stephen Hansen's Hellebækgård from 1747 as it appeared prior to the rebuilding in 1768 Stephen Hansen took over Hellebækgård and the industrial operations in 1743. He expanded the factory and improved operations, focusing on the manufacture of small arms under the name Kronborg Geværfabrik (Kronborg Rifle Factory). In 1747, he replaced the old house with a new main building. It is believed that it was built by Philip de Lange. In 1752 Hansen obtained a royal license to open an inn in Ålsgårde. After a while he moved it to Hellebækgård's east wing. Hansen sold Hellebækgård and the rifle factory to the crown in 1865. The first Schimmelmann Hellebækgård and the rifle factory, collectively known as Hellebækgård Manor (Danish: Hellebækgård Gods), was purchased by Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann in 1768. He had been a financial adviser to the king since 1761 and was a member of Kommercekollegiet from 1767. He had bought Lindenborg Manor in Himmerland from the crown in 1762 and also the crown's sugar plantations in the Danish West Indies. Schimmelmann commissioned Philip de Lange to remodel the house. In 1770, Schimmelmann moved the inn to another building while a chapel was installed in the east wing in its place. Ernst and Charlotte von Schimmelmann Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann took over Hellebæk Manor upon his father's death in 1782. After his first visit to the place, Ernst Schimmelmann described the surroundings to his friend, the jurist August Henning, in a letter: > I return today from Elsinore, where I have spent two days inspecting the > rifle factory, which is half a mile away on the far side of this town. You > cannot possibly imagine a more charming place. The most diverse, the most > romantic natural scenes are united there. It is on the shore of the sea, > which is incessantly covered in ships; on the opposite side you see the > cliffs of Sweden. If you seek a solitary or quiet spot, you just have to > walk into the woods, which hides a wealth of lakes; are you tired of these, > various streams will encourage you with their trickling. Hills with soft > slopes, dark and quiet valleys – no, my dear friend, I do not know how I do > this, but I am miserable at describing the most beautiful place on earth. > Ignore my depiction and imagine a magnificent landscape. Enchanting in the > summer and solemn in the winter. All this is only preparation, but my head, > which is brimming with projects, has conceived an idea, simply that we – if > you will come, my dear, very well could bid the world adieu for a month or > more and throw ourselves in the arms of this solitude. Schimmelmann and his wife Charlotte often gathered a circle of some of the leading writers and intellectuals of the time around them at Hellebækgård in the summertime. Among the guests were the romantic poets Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock, Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg, Jens Baggesen and Adam Oehlenschläger, the philosopher Henrik Steffens and the natural scientist Hans Christian Ørsted. Det Schimmelmannske Fideicommis and World War II After Ernst Heinrich Schimmelmann's death in 1831, the estate was transferred to Det Schimmelmannske Fideicommis (literally \\"The Schimmelmann Fideicommiss\\"). The administrator resided in the Administrator's House at Trompeterbakken (Trompeteer Hill) in Bøssemagergade while the Schimmelmann family remained at Hellebækgård although they increasingly spent their time in Germany. The last Scimmelmann count to reside at Hellebækgård was Werner von Schimmelmann. At the onset of World War II, he entered German service and fell in 1941. The Schimmelmann family then made the house available to the German occupying forces. The Schalburg Corps used the buildings. Later history After the war, inn 1945, Hellebækgård was used for housing Bessarabian and Latvian refugees. The estate was after a trial confiscated by the Danish government in 1946. The main building had fallen into disrepair and was in 1951 sold to the Royal Danish Orphanage. The buildings were renovated and expanded at a price of approximately 1.5 million under directions of the architect Aage Rafn and were inaugurated on 27 August 1953. The Royal Orphanage was dissolved in 2007. The buildings were then taken over by Copenhagen Municipality and used as a social institution until 2014. Today The current school opened in 2014. The site includes a school building with five class rooms from 1962 and a building from 1982.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built in 1902. It is also known as Childers Medical Centre, Foodland, and R & D Meats and DJG Fruit & Vegetable shop. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Jeffery's Building was erected in 1902 for Childers businessman Alfred Charles Jeffery following the fire that destroyed most of the south side of Churchill Street, the main street of Childers. It may have been designed by Bundaberg architect, FW Faircloth who was responsible for much of the new building following the fire the effects of which transformed Childers main street from a pioneer frontier township of timber and iron structures to the established centre of the flourishing Isis district with its new more substantial masonry buildings. Childers is located in what was once the heart of the Isis Scrub. Following logging of the dense scrub in the 1870s, Childers was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar-growing district. 1902 was a very dry year and Childers had no fire brigade. On 23 March, a catastrophic fire swept through the south side of the main street in town, where virtually all the buildings were timber and closely built. Those stores destroyed were: S Oakley, bootmaker; FD Cooper, commission agent; R Graham, fruiterer; ME Gosley, tailor; Foley, hairdresser; M Redmond, Palace Hotel; WB Jones, auctioneer; W Couzens, fruiterer; H Newman, general storekeeper; WJ Overell and Son, general merchants; P Christensen, cabinet maker; W Hood, stationer; T Gaydon, chemist; W Lloyd, hairdresser; Mrs Dunne, fruiterer; Federal Jewellery Company; Dunn Bros, saddlers; H Wegner, bootmaker. The Bundaberg architect F H Faircloth was engaged to redesign many of the replacement buildings and called the first tenders in June 1902. Frederic Herbert (Herb) Faircloth was born in Maryborough in 1870 and was a pupil of German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Faircloth set up his own practice in Bundaberg in 1893 and was very successful, eventually being responsible for the design of almost every major building in Bundaberg. He was also to have a major effect on the appearance and character of Childers. The land (resub 7) containing was acquired by Amy Jane Thomason in 1894 after its subdivision by Charles Powers and Frederick John Charlton. She then sold it to Alfred Jeffery in 1898. Timber shops can be seen on this site in photographs taken before the fire, although it has not been possible to verify what businesses occupied them. After the fire there was some adjustment of boundaries to properties along the burned section and new Certificates of Title were issued. The new buildings were masonry rather than timber, a choice no doubt influenced by the fire. The shops were elegant single story buildings with large display windows and awnings across the footpath supported by decorative posts. The use of classical revival pediments, urns, and balustrades on all the shops created a pleasing rhythm along the street while allowing individuality to each premises. Tenancies were also marked by the visual separation of the facades by the use of separate pediments. Jeffery's Building shares these features with the hotel and slightly later shop which flank it. This building appears to have been meant as three different tenancies, however, the way in which the building has been occupied has not always conformed to this. In 1904 two tenancies were occupied by a wine merchant and in 1908, the building was shared by Garland's furniture warehouse and a cafe run by Stephen Crowe which continued to operate from here for many years. The property was purchased in 1909 by Mary Gaydon, though continuing to be leased out. In 1937 it was subdivided into two blocks and Stephen and Theodore Crowe purchased sub 1, which no doubt contained their cafe. However, in 1945 this was reacquired by the Gaydons who held the property until 1963 when it was sold to Jack Kasses. After a resurvey in 1975, the block was divided into 4 blocks, three to the street and a small block as the rear of the property. They were then sold to different owners. At this time, Boys Ltd, who were then operating in the large shop adjoining, purchased lot 3 and extended into one bay of Jeffery's Building. This section is now separate again and is a medical practice. The fruit shop and butchers which occupy the other two shops in Jeffery's Building are long term tenancies.  Description  Jeffrey's Building is a single story row of masonry shops on the south side of Churchill Street, Childers main street adjoining the Palace Hotel. In common with other shops on this side of the street, it has a corrugated iron roof concealed by a parapet which is topped by a classical revival pediments and urns, each tenancy being marked by a separate triangular pediment. The central pediment is raised and carried the words 'Jeffery's Building' and the date '1902'in raised letters. The awning across the footpath is now cantilevered and the building has modern shop fronts. The section of the building occupied as a medical practice has had the shop front reconstructed to resemble its original form.

It was designed by Francis Jones and built from 1925 to 1926 by Reuben Vacher Brady. It was unveiled 15 October 1926. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 May 2000.  History  The Isis District War Memorial and Shire Council Chambers was constructed in 1926 and is the second administration building for the Isis Shire Council located in the town of Childers. In the 1870s timber cutters were the first European settlers to come to the area surrounding Childers, attracted by large quantities of hoop pine, red cedar and other timbers. The town was established during the 1880s after the land in the nearby area was surveyed into farm blocks in 1882. There was no official town survey and Childers developed following the private subdivision of portions 870 and 871, at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. Childers and other towns in the present Isis Shire were originally part of the Burrum Divisional Board which was based in Maryborough. There was considerable discontent during the 1880s amongst the ratepayers of the fledgling town who felt disadvantaged and neglected. The Burrum Divisional Board covered a very extensive area and the journey to Maryborough coupled with the poor condition of the roads meant that representatives from the Isis district often failed to attend meetings. The Isis ratepayers and Isis Progress Association presented a petition for separation to the then Governor-in-Chief, Sir Anthony Musgrave and the members of the Executive Council of Queensland. They requested that Sub-division 3 be severed from the Burrum Division and be constituted as a separate division, the Isis Division. Town Councillors on the steps of the Isis Shire Hall, Childers, 1910 The Governor and Executive Council agreed to the petitioners' request and on 31 December 1886 the Isis Divisional Board was proclaimed. Meetings and elections were held in Howard at the Court House and board members from Childers rode on horseback to attend meetings once a month. The location of the Board's office was an issue of contention for a number of years and various propositions were presented for re-locating to Childers, Isistown or to a new building in Howard. In 1891, an offer of land in Childers was made to the Board and they subsequently made an application to the government for a loan of to erect a new building. From 1891, the Isis Divisional Board met in the Land's Office, two rooms adjoining the Post and Telegraph Office in Childers. In 1903, the Isis Divisional Board was abolished by the Governor-in-Council and the Isis Shire Council was created. That same year, the Council moved to the Isis Shire Council Hall, a low-set timber building which had been constructed in Churchill Street on the site of the present swimming pool. World War I had a profound impact on the small town. Large numbers of young men from the district enlisted and the town experienced a loss of 60 from a population of 1500. A deputation of men and women from the Isis District War Memorial Committee approached the Isis Shire Council at its General Meeting on 20 October 1924 to discuss the possibility of jointly constructing the \\"Isis District War Memorial Shire Council Chambers\\". The proposed building would house a Soldiers' Memorial and a room for returned soldiers as well as new Council Chambers. A joint committee was formed. A driving force behind the war memorial project was the then Shire Clerk, Mr Herbert Epps. Epps was a former councillor who had relinquished his position on Council to take up the job of Shire Clerk, a responsibility he maintained until his death in 1932. One of his three sons was killed in action in France in 1917 and he was passionate in his determination to have the War Memorial Council Chambers erected. Epps strongly desire that Childer's contribution to the war effort should be reflected in the allocation of a significant war trophy to form part of the memorial. As early as 2 December 1918, he wrote to Edward Corser, the Member of the Australian House of Representatives for the local electorate of Wide Bay asking for two field guns to adorn the memorial. However, the initial response was that Childers was not a large enough town to warrant a large war trophy. The Isis Shire Council responded that \\"some 360 men enlisted from Childers, with 85 not returning from the war\\" as evidence of the district's commitment and sacrifice; this resulted in a decision that they would receive a smaller machine gun. However, the council continued to press its case arguing that \\"To suggest that a machine gun adequately expresses that part this district has played in the Great War ... is so absurd as to only arise from a want of appreciation as to the fact and to the importance of this as the centre\\". The council continued to argue their case for a field gun until on 29 April 1922 they were to be given a Howitzer field gun (in addition to the machine gun and trench mortar that they had previously been allocated). The Joint Committee had decided to invite competitive designs for the building and received entries in early February 1925. The submissions were judged without knowledge of the authors and \\"design number two\\" was chosen. The winner was Brisbane architect Francis Jones. Jones had undertaken his architectural education in England and was the first Queensland-born architect to achieve the distinction of being admitted as an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He was an architect for both Queensland Railways and the Department of Public Works and lectured at the Brisbane Central Technical College and the University of Queensland. Jones was also a returned soldier having fought in both the Boer War and World War I. He received as prize money for his winning entry of a masonry building in the shape of a cross in plan, that was uncluttered and formal in appearance. Tenders were considered at a special meeting of Council in August 1925 and Mr R.V Brady's tender of , which included furnishings, was accepted. The Council borrowed from the AMP Society to pay for their share of the construction costs. The building is said to have been constructed of hand-formed blocks and it is believed that Thomas Pye was the architect who supervised the construction, however, the nature of the relationship between Pye and Jones' design is not clear. Pye was in private practice at this time having left the Department of Public Works. Pye had experienced a tumultuous working life in the Department despite his significant contribution to the design of many of Queensland's most important public buildings. Pye was a keen rifleman and also served with the army, rising to the rank of colonel, and it may have been through these connections that Pye became involved with the Isis project. Construction was completed and the building opened on Anzac Day (25 April), 1926. The official opening and dedication of the Isis War Memorial was a significant event in the life of the Childers community. The Maryborough Chronicle reported that \\"the memorial was planned, supervised and built by returned soldiers and it is understood it is the first of its kind in the Commonwealth.\\" The ceremony included an Anzac Day service, conducted by local priests, one of whom was also a returned soldier. The opening ceremony was performed by William Brand, who represented Burrum in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, the memorial was opened by Miss Adie, daughter of long- term Isis councillor and chairman of the Directors of the Isis Central Sugar Mill Company, Alex Adie and the soldier's room was opened by Mrs H Epps, wife of the Shire Clerk and mother of James Epps who features in the memorial. The Childers Town Band provided extensive musical accompaniment and the Union Jack was unfurled at the top of the building. A visitor to the memorial in 1927 provides an evocative description in The Queensland Digger, capturing the powerful emotional impact of the War Memorial room: > \\"Many and varied are the types of memorial to be seen throughout this vast > land of ours... but of the many which I have seen I was never more impressed > than with the abovenamed memorial, which is situated in the little township > of Childers; one of Queensland's sugar producing districts. > ...in keeping with the sacrifice of which it reminds us, it takes the form > of a Maltese Cross (sic.), which is decidedly emblematical... The centre of > the building is occupied by the Local Authorities and takes the form of > offices, strong room and board meeting room. The right portion is a > recreation room for the use of returned soldiers, while the left hand side > of the building presents a picture which I shall never forget; for this is > the sanctuary where relatives of the fallen temporarily shut themselves in > with the memory of their dear ones. The beautiful honour board extends > nearly around the four walls. Mounted upon this board are many individual > bronzed metal frames appropriate in design and where it has been possible to > secure same, the photograph of the dead soldier appears. The effect is > splendid and to complete the unique work a shelf has been arranged so that > there is ample room for the relatives to place flowers in remembrance. What > impressed me mostly was the fact that a number of the vases contained fresh > flowers: showing that someone had gratefully made use of the facilities > provided by this wonderful memorial.\\" The Shire of Isis ceased to exist in 2008, when it merged into the new Bundaberg Region, and as such the building was no longer needed as council chambers. However, the building has been retained by the successor council as its Childers Service Centre.  Description  The Isis District War Memorial and Council Chambers is a one-story masonry building located at the southern end of Churchill Street, Childers. The town's water tower provides a backdrop to the building which is set amid wide lawns with several large shade trees. The building is centrally planned, taking the form of a Greek cross in plan and exhibiting a style most aptly described as abstract Classicism. This is emphasised in elevation by the use of elements such as pediments, acroteria and an austere, modulated facade that suggests an abstracted temple front. The building sits low to the ground on a concrete slab and is constructed of painted, load-bearing concrete blocks with the appearance of vermiculated ashlar. A low masonry wall and cast iron fence runs along the front boundary of the site, attaching to the corners of the front elevation. Two sets of gates defined by pairs of masonry piers lead to the entrances of the War Memorial and Soldier's Room. Each wall of the building has a centrally located, moulded pediment whose shape is reflected in a parapet wall above. Acroteria are located at the apex and ends of the pediments. Moulded string courses separate the pediments from the walls and sections of the lower facade are recessed around window openings. These recessed sections are further divided by an enlarged concrete sill that stretch the full width of the recess. Windows and doors are generally timber framed surmounted by large, painted iron hoods. The central section of the building accommodates the Shire Council offices which are accessed via a recent, steel and glass entry door. A hallway runs the length of the building from the front entrance to an exit door at the back. An entry vestibule has been formed from a section of the hallway partitioned with a plasterboard wall and recent timber and glass door. To the right of the vestibule is a large open plan office with a long service counter and small waiting area. Other Council offices and a strong room are located either side of the hallway. All of these rooms have recent suspended ceilings which have been inserted to conceal air conditioning ducts. Many of the internal walls are painted, load-bearing masonry with timber skirting boards with other recent plasterboard partitions dividing some of the offices into two smaller offices. A second service counter area is located in the rear section of the hallway on the left-hand side, this is now unused. The western wing of the building accommodates the War Memorial room and the eastern wing, formerly the Soldier's Room, now contains the Council meeting room, staff room and photocopy room. The Council meeting room has a recent plasterboard ceiling with recessed down-lighting, a dark brown upholstered dado and a large, horseshoe-shaped meeting table that was purpose built for the space. The tall, panelled, timber entrance doors in the southern wall are no longer used and a small exit door is situated on the eastern wall. On the exterior of the western and eastern wings, a bay of three windows consisting of a central pair flanked by single windows with fanlights above, is arranged directly below the pediment. The War Memorial is entered via a gently sloping ramp and through a pair of tall, timber panelled doors. Dark timber honour boards stretch across all four walls of the room. There are two boards on the eastern wall, the upper one is in memory of the men who died in action in World War Two and is surmounted by an ornate timber pediment. The lower boards are in memory of the men who died in World War One. The boards are inscribed with gilt lettering and have a row of copper plaques mounted upon them. Alongside the names of battlefields, is a quote from Wilfred Owen's deeply ironic poem \\"Dulce Et Decorum Est\\" – \\"how wonderful it is to die for the fatherland\\". Each plaque is dedicated to the memory of an individual soldier and is embossed with the years of the war, the badge of the Australian Imperial Force and an oval- shaped photograph of the soldier framed by a pair of weeping women and the words \\"in memory of\\". The soldiers' names are engraved on small plaques below. The plaques for the First World War are brass and for the Second, chrome. A timber shelf runs below the copper plaques and a small vase with artificial red poppies is placed in front of each plaque. Above one of the plaques is a framed black and white photo of the foreign grave of the soldier to whom the plaque is dedicated. Flags are mounted on the walls above the honour boards and chairs are located in each corner of the room. Wreaths, framed photographs of the reigning monarch and a visitor's book are to be found on a table in the centre of the room. The room is carpeted, the windows are shaded with venetian blinds and the plaster ceiling is decorated with a grid-like pattern. Toilets are located in a small separate building at the back, north-eastern corner of the building. The toilet block is constructed of face brick with a skillion roof. Also situated at the back of the building are two areas of air conditioning plant enclosed by timber paling fences. A German 21 cm Mörser 10 cannon is located on the western side of the building. It was manufacted in Essen, Germany in 1916 by Fried Krupp. It was captured by the Australian Army in Flanders and was presented by the French Government to the Australian Government, which allocated it to Childers. It has the marking \\"Nr 406 - Fried Krupp AG, Essen - 1916\\".

He helped in establishing the Wesleyan Canarese Chapel (now the Hudson Memorial Church) at Nagarthpete in the Bangalore Petah. In 1864, Hodson wrote An Elementary Grammar of the Kannada, or Canarese Language, a treatise on the grammar of the Kannada language. History Thomas Hodson was born in 1804, at North Scarle, Lincolnshire, England. In 1829, we came to India as a missionary of the Wesleyan Mission. Initially he was stationed in Calcutta between 1829-1833, where he learned Bengali for nearly 3 years. Between 1833-1836, he was transferred to Bangalore, where he learnt Canarese and Tamil. In 1836, he was appointed to Mysore, and then to Gubbi in 1837. Appointed back to Mysore, he served between 1838-1843. In 1843, he returned to England due to bad health.

His initial days was spent learning Kannada and Tamil. In particular, Hodson intended to follow the example of the American missionaries in Ceylon and establish an extensive educational system in Bangalore. According to Captain Woodward of the 32 NI, reporting on 4 November 1832, the Wesleyan Mission was established in the Bangalore Cantonment in 1819. The contact till then was restricted to the Tamil population of the Cantonment and the English soldiers. A Wesleyan Chapel had been established in the Bangalore Cantonment (the present Wesley Tamil Church, Haines Road), and services were conducted regularly in Tamil and 1 service every Sunday for the English soldiers. Contact with the Canarese population of the Bangalore Pettah was restricted. For reaching out to the Canarese, Thomas Hodson was learning the language, so he would be able to interact with them. In 1832, Hodson was appointed to Bangalore, along with Peter Percival. Wesleyan missionaries were supposed to take up the dual task of educating and preaching to the locals. Around this time, Hodson decided to start a Mission at Gubbi, which a native town in the Mysore Kingdom. Hodson chose Gubbi to set up the mission because in Bangalore, he found that his time and efforts were taken away in preaching to the British and European officers, and he could not concentrate on the local population. However, the Gubbi mission was temporarily abandoned and Hodson returned to Bangalore. In 1834, Hodson purchased about 20 acres of land, just outside the Bangalore Petah (the current United Mission School and College, Unity Buildings, etc.). In the same year, Hodson had to take up the role of Supervisor of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission. During his tenure, he started an Anglo-Tamil school in the Bangalore Civil and Military Station. The reputation of the school spread, and several respected Hindu gentlemen of the Petah, requested Hodson to open a Canarese School in the Petah. Hence, a room was rented within the Fort walls and Canarese (Kannada) school was started. In this room, Hodson preached his first sermon in Canarese in 1835. For some time, Hodson was involved in managing the Tamil works at Bangalore. After some time he moved back to Gubbi, living out in a tent. Rev. Thomas Cryer took over from Hodson as the Supervisor of the Wesleyan Tamil Mission. At this time William Arthur (an Irishman, after whom the William Arthur Memorial Church at Goobie is named after) and Peter Batchelor, laymen who came to Madras to run the Church Ministry Service (CMS) Press joined the Wesleyan Mission, and were transferred to the Weslyan Tamil Mission at Bangalore Cantonment. Arthur them moved to Gubbi as the Wesleyan missionary. Thomas Hodson recorded the experiences of the Gubbi Mission in his book Old Daniel, or, Memoir of a converted Hindoo: with observations on mission work in the Goobbe circuit and description of village life in India, which provides an excellent account of village life in the 19th century Mysore State. Wesleyan Canarese Mission According to William Arthur, the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was located in the Bangalore Petah, at about 3 miles from the Wesleyan Tamil Mission house. The land for the Wesleyan Canarese Mission was obtained by Thomas Hodson, and was located just outside one of the town gates. Initially, it was a school with a school room which served as the residence of the school master. The school provided English education and considerable number of students were enrolled. Thereafter Mr. Webber was sent to this mission. In 1840, Garrett and Jenkins were appointed as Wesleyan Canarese missionaries, with an authority to build a printing press and a mission-house. Thus was established the Wesleyan Mission Press, with the funding coming from English gentry. The missionaries started to preach in the streets of the petah in the early hours of the day. The sermon was simple Christian concepts such as unity of God, atonement of Christ, etc. Thomas Hodson's Account of the Bangalore Petah, 1856 Thomas Hodson in 1856, describes Bangalore as consisting of two parts - the Cantonment where the soldiers lived and Tamil was primarily spoken, and the Old Town or the native town (Bangalore Pete) where Kannada was the main language. In both parts a total of 130,000 Indians lived. Further he describes the shops of the Bangalore petah, with mud being used for the walls and the floor, wooden pillars and clay used for flat roofs. There were no windows or any protection from the dust, with a mat from the rooftop for shade. At night, the shops were secured by wooden shutters. The shop-keeper sat on the floor of the shop, or on one of the lower shelves. The traders were cloth merchants, grocers, gold smiths, etc. The shops sold sugarcane, coconut, bananas, rice, sweets which were hung on a string and various grains which were kept in baskets with were smeared with cow-dung. Water carriers carrying water was a common site. There were thousands of monkeys which created mischief, but were unharmed by the natives due to their religious beliefs. Sketches Thomas Hodson made several sketches about the life in the Bangalore Petah and Mysore State. Many of these were published as engravings in the 'Wesleyan Juvenile Offering'. The original colour sketches are in museums and in private collections. Some of Hodson's sketches are with the Museum of Sydney, The Rocks.

Within the state of Ohio, it is a predominantly southeast–northwest highway running from west of Willshire before crossing over into West Virginia via the Ravenswood Bridge over the Ohio River. The route runs through largely rural territory throughout most of the state's west-central, central, and southeastern regions, although it also passes through large portions of downtown Columbus. Route description US 33 during its brief concurrency with US 50 and SR 32 in Athens US 33 east of Bellefontaine passing through the Marmon Valley US 33 and I-270 Interchange US 33 enters Ohio from Indiana, to the west, near Willshire in Van Wert County as a two-lane highway, continuing southeast through Mercer County, crossing US 127, then entering Auglaize County, joining limited-access Ohio Route 29 (SR 29) briefly near St. Marys, continuing east as a four-lane parkway, then a controlled-access highway near Wapakoneta, where it intersects Interstate 75 (I-75). East of I-75, the road once again becomes two-lane as it continues to Lakeview and Russells Point south of Indian Lake. At the terminus of SR 117 near Huntsville, US 33 becomes a limited-access, multi-lane highway before reaching US 68 at Bellefontaine where it resumes as a controlled-access freeway, passing Campbell Hill, the highest point in Ohio, and continuing around Marysville. Entering Franklin County, the road runs concurrently with SR 161, then intersects I-270 in Dublin. After I-270, the route loses its controlled-access status and passes through the Dublin Historic District and crosses the Scioto River. The overlap with SR 161 then ends, and US 33 heads south on Riverside Drive towards downtown Columbus, following the Scioto River along the western border of Upper Arlington, where it passes Griggs Reservoir, one of the main sources of water for Columbus. The road changes names two times in this area, first to Dublin Road at the intersection with Trabue Road, and then to Spring/Long Streets at SR 315\\\\. The route continues south on 3rd/4th Streets and then east on Livingston Avenue, heading towards the Columbus neighborhood of Driving Park. In Bexley, US 33 veers southeast onto College Avenue, then intersects I-70. After Petzinger Road, the route becomes a controlled-access highway, subsequently intersecting SR 104, I-270 (for the second time), and SR 317 (Hamilton Road). Following the Ebright Road near Blacklick Estates, the highway continues to the southeast as a non-limited- access expressway. Beginning at Carroll, US 33 bypasses Lancaster as a limited-access freeway completed in 2005. Continuing southeast, the highway enters Ohio's scenic Hocking Hills region near Sugar Grove as an expressway. East of Logan, the highway again becomes limited-access for approximately . As the route approaches Nelsonville, traffic continues on the limited access four-lane bypass that opened October 1, 2013. Further southeast towards Athens, the expressway design resumes, followed by a brief limited-access section around Athens, where it joins the concurrent US 50/SR 32 for about . South of Athens, US 33 continues as a limited-access highway, bypassing Pomeroy, intersecting SR 124 and SR 7, and continuing to the Ohio River in Meigs County, crossing the Ohio on the two-lane cantilever Ravenswood Bridge, and entering West Virginia in Ravenswood. In total, US 33 traverses across the Buckeye State. History The Ravenswood Bridge was built in 1981 and originally carried the designation SR 824 until 2003, when US 33 was rerouted on a new bypass out of Pomeroy and connecting to the bridge, supplanting SR 824 in the process. In 2013, an expressway bypass was completed around Nelsonville. This was done to reduce traffic congestion in the area, as the original routing through Nelsonville was only two lanes wide. , the route had an average of 73,000 vehicles per day.

Designed by Helmut Jahn, it will be a 74-story, tall residential condominium tower located at 1000 South Michigan Avenue. The 323-unit building will include one to four bedroom luxury condominiums. Construction on 1000M officially began in December 2019 and was originally expected to finish in mid-to-late 2022.  Location  The building will be located in what is now a vacant lot at 1000 South Michigan in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District in downtown Chicago, Illinois. The site borders the Lightner Building at 1006 South Michigan and the Karpen-Standard Oil Building at 910 South Michigan. Located on the edge of Grant Park, the building will have views of the park and Lake Michigan. As part of the \\"Cultural Mile,\\" the building is located near the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum Campus, Harold Washington Library and the Chicago Cultural Center.  Architecture  The building has been designed by architect Helmut Jahn who is known for his works across the globe including the Messeturm in Frankfurt, CitySpire, the Park Avenue Tower, 50 West Street and 425 Lexington Avenue in New York City. The building is a joint venture between New York-based JK Equities and New York-based Time Equities, and Oak Capitals. Ethan Coleman, the development manager for Time Equities, and Jordan Karlik, a founder of JK Equities, talked to Crain’s Chicago Business about the design in March 2017. Coleman said the design of the tower \\"is something that really maximizes the light and views that residents will have.\\" Karlik added of the architect, \\"Helmut was very passionate\\" about the exterior design of 1000 South Michigan Avenue. The tower will be largely composed of glass with a greenish hue with metal horizontal spandrels flanking each floor. The tower is capped with a crown screened in metallic mesh. The tower's crown will serve more than aesthetic purposes—it will also act as a large amenity roof deck area that spans the eastern building wall. Natural-finished aluminum spandrels, or bands between floors of the building, will create the image of a lightweight building. 1000M will also have east-facing terraces.  Interior design  Kara Mann, of Kara Mann Design, will design the 323 individual residences and nearly 40,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor amenity space. Mann will also provide residents on the upper floors with the option to have their outdoor spaces staged and decorated. Kitchens will be outfitted with custom cabinetry and Sub-Zero and Wolf appliances; master suites will feature bathrooms with oversized showers and soaking tubs. Mann said she wanted the interiors to have \\"a purity and lightness.\\" The building will also have a two-story lobby.  Previous building designs  According to Crain's Chicago Business, plans for the building were released in August 2015. Although the historic district zoning has height restrictions of 425 feet (129.5m), on September 23, 2015 the City Clerk of Chicago's website posted that the building is planned to have a rooftop terrace that reaches according to Dennis Rodkin of Crain's Chicago Business. Over a month later, Blair Kamin of the Chicago Tribune stated that the plan was to be for a tower. Eventually, the building was redesigned to stand at . The plan was approved on April 22, 2016. Instead of the more common setback architectural design, the original building would have had overhangs on its south face with rising cubes that are successively larger that present a \\"striking, if somewhat precarious, effect\\" according to the Pulitzer Prize- winning Blair Kamin. Based on an October 29, 2015 presentation, the planned 506-unit building was to include 358 condominiums and 148 rental apartments between the Lightner Building at 1006 South Michigan and the Karpen-Standard Oil Building at 910 South Michigan on what has been a vacant lot. The early designs for the building included an 85th-floor roof deck for condo residents. The property, which overlooks Grant Park, had been owned by Warren Barr who had plans for a 40-story condominium tower until he lost ownership through foreclosure to First American Bank in a July 2010 proceeding that saw the property sell for $11.3 million. If completed, the building will surpass the Metropolitan Tower at 310 South Michigan as the Historic Michigan Boulevard District's tallest structure. It will also become the tallest building in the city south of the Willis Tower. Even after the shorter redesign, the building retained the claim as the tallest building along Michigan Avenue in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District across from Grant Park.  Height  Commission on Chicago Landmarks has jurisdiction over the proposal due to its placement in the Historic District. In February 2016, The Landmark Commission considered formalizing a height restriction in the region of the historic district between 8th and 11th streets. Subsequently, the tower's height was scaled-back to and the building was redesigned to employ the current curving silhouette. If completed, the building will surpass the Metropolitan Tower at 310 South Michigan as the Historic Michigan Boulevard District's tallest structure. It will also become the tallest building in the city south of the Willis Tower. Even after the shorter redesign, the building retained the claim as the tallest building along Michigan Avenue in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District across from Grant Park and the 13th tallest building in the City of Chicago.  Amenities  Amenities include an acoustically engineered music performance room overlooking Grant Park, a yoga room with a wall-sized video screen for an immersive experience of doing yoga or meditating, and a golf simulator room where the concierge can set up tee times at virtual versions of some of the world's top courses. There will also be Himalayan salt therapy room and an outdoor swimming pool with cabanas, a cookout area and gardens. On the 72nd floor, Club 1000, a full-service bar and lounge, will feature a sky terrace with telescopes and sculpture benches that overlook Lake Michigan.  Construction  The 1000M Sales Gallery, located at 1006 S. Michigan Avenue prior to and during construction, features a scale model of the tower and a model unit that features Kara Mann's interior design. Also in the Sales Gallery, a video wall nine feet high and 28 feet wide displays the view as it's seen from whatever unit a potential buyer is considering, thanks to extensive footage shot using helicopters and drones. Construction was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was designed by F H Faircloth and built in 1902. It is also known as Mitre 10, Silly Solly's, Pettigrew's Hardware, and Wyper Brothers Ironmongery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former hardware store is one of a row of conjoining shops situated between the Palace Hotel and Kerr's Buildings. It was erected in 1902 to the design of Bundaberg architect FH Faircloth, following a fire that destroyed most of the south side of Churchill Street, the main street of Childers. Faircloth was responsible for much of the new building following the fire, the effects of which transformed the appearance of Childers. Childers is located in what was once the heart of the Isis Scrub. Following logging of the dense scrub in the 1870s, Childers was promoted in the 1880s by Maryborough interests as an agricultural district. The land in the immediate vicinity of the present town of Childers was surveyed in 1882 into 50-acre farm blocks. There was no official town survey; Childers developed following private subdivision at the railhead of the 1887 Isis railway line from Isis Junction. This was opened on 31 October 1887, and was intended principally to facilitate the transport of timber from the scrub. The coming of the railway not only promoted the development of the town of Childers; it also proved the catalyst for the establishment of a sugar industry in the district in the late 1880s. At the opening of the railway to Childers, Robert Cran, owner of Maryborough's Yengarie mill, announced that he would erect a double crushing juice mill at Doolbi, to supply his mill at Yengarie. This was completed in 1890, with the juice being brought in railway tankers from the Isis. Further expansion of the sugar industry in the Isis was closely related to the activities of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which erected a central crushing mill in the district 1893-94, and began crushing in 1895. By 1895, at least three other mills had been established in the Isis, with another two under construction, and Childers had emerged as the flourishing centre of a substantial sugar- growing district. 1902 was a very dry year and Childers had no fire brigade. On 23 March, a catastrophic fire swept through the south side of the main street in town, where virtually all the buildings were timber and closely built. Those stores destroyed were: S Oakley, bootmaker; FD Cooper, commission agent; R Graham, fruiterer; ME Gosley, tailor; Foley, hairdresser; M Redmond, Palace Hotel; WB Jones, auctioneer; W Couzens, fruiterer; H Newman, general storekeeper; WJ Overell and Son, general merchants; P Christensen, cabinet maker; W Hood, stationer; T Gaydon, chemist; W Lloyd, hairdresser; Mrs Dunne, fruiterer; Federal Jewellery Company; Dunn Bros, saddlers; H Wegner, bootmaker. The Bundaberg architect F H Faircloth was engaged to redesign most of the replacement buildings and called the first tenders in June 1902. Frederic Herbert (Herb) Faircloth was born in Maryborough in 1870 and was a pupil of German-trained Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich. Faircloth set up his own practice in Bundaberg in 1893 and was very successful, eventually being responsible for the design of almost every important building in Bundaberg. He was also to have a major effect on the appearance and character of Childers. Before the fire, photographs show a timber building on this site, however it has not been possible to establish what business was run from the premises. Thomas Gaydon may have operated his first pharmacy from this site in the 1890s although his premises after the fire were located a few doors away at 90 Churchill Street on land also owned by him. The family continued to own the land until 1973 when it was sold to John and Elaine Hughes and then to Ross and Wendy Smith in 1989. Like other post-fire buildings in Childers this set of 5 shops were masonry rather than timber, a choice no doubt influenced by the fire, and were elegant single story buildings with large glass shop fronts. Striped ogee awnings across the footpath were supported by decorative posts with cast iron infill. Each shop had a separate roof, some lit by lanterns and the individual tenancies were also marked by the visual separation of the facades by the use of classic revival pediments, urns, and balustrades. Although this row of shops was designed as five tenancies, two were owned by Albert Gorrie, who conducted a bakery in one and leased the other, and three by Thomas Gaydon, which were occupied as a single tenancy by Wyper Brothers, ironmongers, who also sold furniture and hardware. Pettigrew's Hardware who succeeded them in the 1920s, also used all of the Gaydon owned space, which practice seems to have continued. Although the building has now changed hands several times it has been a hardware store for most of its commercial life. It became Silly Solly's in early 1996.  Description  The former hardware store extends through three bays of a set of 5 single story masonry shops built conjointly on the south side of Churchill Street adjoining the Palace Hotel. It has a corrugated iron roof concealed by a parapet. In common with a number of shops on this side of the street, this building has classical revival pediments, some curved and some triangular, linked by a balustraded parapet topped by urns. The shop front has been modernised and is shaded by an ogee profile corrugated iron awning supported by posts to the street, although the cast iron valance is no longer present. The interior has been refitted with succeeding tenancies.  Heritage listing  The former Hardware Store was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. It is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history representing evidence of the development of Childers in the early twentieth century in particular, the rebuilding of the south side of the main street in the early 1900s following the 1902 fire. Together with much of the southern side of Childers main street it provides clear evidence of the impact of fire on Queensland towns where adequate water supply and fire services were lacking. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early 1900s country town masonry commercial buildings, in particular the awnings, shop fronts, lanterns, and overall form. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It contributes to the picturesque townscape of Churchill Street which is both remarkably architecturally coherent and intact The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It has a special association with the life and work of Bundaberg architect FH Faircloth who was responsible for much of the appearance of the town of Childers in the twentieth century.

As a military leader, he participated in the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he served as Vice Governor of Fujian, Vice Mayor of Shanghai, economic representative at the Chinese embassy in North Vietnam, President of the Chinese Academy of Science, and Vice Premier of China. He was also a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China. Early life On 26 February 1916, Fang Yi was born in Xiamen, Fujian Province to a poor family. He original name was Fang Qingji (). He had an older brother, and his mother died 26 days after Fang Yi was born. His father remarried, and had another son and daughter. When Fang Yi was eight his father also died, and the family fell into abject poverty. With the help of his maternal uncle, Fang was able to attend Xiamen No. 1 Middle School, one of the best schools in Xiamen. While attending the school, he joined the Communist Youth League at age 14, and the Communist Party of China (CPC) a year later, in 1931. War-time career He later went to Shanghai and worked at the Commercial Press, a leading publishing house. However, he was arrested by the Kuomintang in 1934, and sentenced to eight years in prison for his Communist activism. He was released from a Suzhou prison in 1937, after the Xi'an Incident and the Japanese invasion of China. He went on to serve as a political commissar in northern China during the Anti-Japanese War, and in the ensuing Chinese Civil War, he was Secretary General of the North China People's Government, the semi-autonomous Communist government in northern China. He also served as vice governor in the Communist government of Shandong Province. People's Republic of China After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 following the Communist victory, Fang Yi served as vice governor in his home province of Fujian from 1949 to 1952, before briefly serving as vice-mayor of Shanghai from 1952–53. He was then appointed Vice Minister of Finance in September 1953, but only served for a year before being posted, together with his wife Yin Sen, to the Chinese embassy to North Vietnam in 1954. As economic representative, he was responsible for coordinating China's assistance to North Vietnam, and served in that position until 1961. In 1961, Fang returned to Beijing and oversaw China's foreign aid program in the Office for Economic Relations with Foreign Countries until 1976. His knowledge of multiple foreign languages, including English, German, Japanese, and Russian, was very useful to the Chinese government, which was eager to establish economic ties with foreign countries. He survived the Cultural Revolution and became an alternate member of the 9th CPC Central Committee in 1969. He led economic delegations to many, mainly African, countries, and oversaw the Tanzania–Zambia Railway project, among others. After the death of Mao Zedong and the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Fang was appointed vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and became close to Deng Xiaoping. When Deng rose to power, Fang was made one of China's vice-premiers in March 1978, and was elected as a member of the 11th CPC Politburo (re-elected to the 12th Politburo in 1982). He also served as President of the CAS from 1979 to 1981. Under Deng's leadership, China established economic contacts with the Western world, and Fang led Chinese delegations to Japan and West Germany. He also accompanied Deng on the latter's historic visit to the United States in January 1979. Fang headed a separate delegation to American technological centers, such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Texas Medical Center, and a Lockheed plant near Los Angeles, with the aim of advancing China's industry. In May 1982, Fang became a state councilor, serving until 1998. He was also a member of the Presidium of the 12th Congress of the CPC. In 1988, he was appointed a Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, serving until 1993. He was honorary chairman of the Chinese Weiqi Association from 1977 until his death. On 17 October 1997, Fang Yi died in Beijing at the age of 81.

It was built circa 1902. It is also known as Isis Town and Country, Butler & Ker, and James Butler. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Dittmer's Store was erected c.1902 for chemist, Thomas Gaydon and stationer and tobacconist, William Hood, after a fire destroyed many of the shops along the southern side of Childers' main street. The town of Childers grew up around a railway terminus opened in 1887 to facilitate timber getting in the Isis Scrub. What became the main street was subdivided into small allotments in the 1890s. In 1894, Frederick John Charlton and Henry Jardine Gray sold some to tinsmith, James Slater. In 1899 the property was sold to Gaydon and Hood. In March 1902 a fire destroyed the existing timber shop, which may have been operated by Slater and later, Hood. Soon after the southern side of the street was resurveyed resulting in the blocks becoming doglegged in shape. The new masonry shop was occupied by Hood, whilst next door the partners erected this store. After a second fire in the 1920s, the shop was operated as a men's mercer by LR Stevens and Benjamin Foley. Later it became an electricians shop, then a toy shop and sports store. In 1929 the shop was purchased by Thomas Gaydon's wife, Mary and remained in the Gaydon family until 1970 when it was sold again. Gustav Dittmer was a stationer who lived in Childers from the 1920s to the 1940s. His son Felix Dittmer was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Mount Gravatt and an Australian Senator.  Description  Dittmer's Store fronts Churchill Street, the main street of Childers, to the north with rear access off Macrossan Street to the South. The single-storeyed masonry building, with an ogee-shaped corrugated iron awning, is located within a cohesive group of predominantly 1900s shops with street awnings and decorative rendered facades. The building has a corrugated iron gabled roof with a central clerestory skylight to the east and west. The rendered street facade is surmounted by a parapet with a heavy cornice, balustrade and a rounded broken pediment supporting a single urn. The shop front has a central recessed entry with display windows to either side and a pressed metal ceiling with fixed arctic glass windows above. The rear of the building is of face brick with supporting piers and barred windows. A freestanding brick toilet block is located adjacent to the rear entry to the building, and the rear of the site is grassed. Internally, the building has a horizontal boarded ceiling which is raked from four sides in the centre to the clerestory skylight. Walls are rendered with some partitioning at the rear and the floor is concrete.  Heritage listing  Dittmer's Store was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The building, erected , is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history, representing the development of Childers as a prosperous timber and sugar town, forming the heart of the Isis Shire, in the early 20th century.

The term was sometimes applied to similar structures throughout the British Empire. A dak bungalow, dak-house or dâk-bungalow was a government building in British India under Company Rule and the Raj. It may also refer to some similarly-built or -used structures in modern India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.  Origins The dak bungalows carried on a tradition of caravanserais, dharamshalas, and other guesthouses erected by Indian rulers for both Hindu and Muslim pilgrims.. The India Office possesses a diary with the entry for 25 November 1676 noting \\"It was thought fitt... to sett up Bungales or Hovells... for all such English in the Company's Service as belong to their Sloopes & Vessells\\".. The dak bungalows proper were first erected in the 1840s,. serving as staging posts for the dak, the imperial mail service. Rudyard Kipling's father J. Lockwood Kipling described them as \\"about as handsome as a stack of hay\\" and forming a kind of \\"'irreducible minimum' of accommodation\\". Each was about from the next along the major roads of the subcontinent. Usage The buildings provided free accommodation for government officials. and, upon their permission, \\"incomparably cheap\\" lodging for other travellers.. The structures are therefore sometimes also known as posthouses, resthouses, or travellers' bungalows. Officials at the dak bungalows included the dakwala (postman), the durwan (caretaker), and sometimes a khansamah (attendant). Fees were set by the government; in the 1920s; 8 annas a day for single persons and 12 for married couples 6 or 9 g of .917% silver). Guests were liable for reimbursing them for any damage and for the costs of supplies used, including grass for the horses, firewood, and food. Beds were uncommon, as the Raj officials were expected to travel with their own bedding and servants. The khansamah could provide dining for those without their own cook, the common fare being eggs and chicken dishes. In remote areas, most government work—including hearing legal cases—occurred at the dak bungalows when the district officials visited. At district headquarters, the circuit house provided a larger courtroom and better accommodations for visiting sessions judges. Larger cities might have still more specialized buildings. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the network of bungalows was used by escaping British civilians and soldiers but saw several massacres outside Delhi.. Following the suppression of the rebellion and the assumption of rule by the British government, thatch was prohibited for use in official buildings.. They feature in the fiction of Rudyard Kipling: \\"a fair proportion of the tragedy of our lives out here acted itself in dâk-bungalows... [and] many men have died mad in [them]...\\". \\"...nothing is too wild, grotesque, or horrible to happen in a dâk- bungalow.\\"Kipling, \\"My Own True Ghost Story\\", p. 37. Legacy Many Dak bungalows fell into disrepair or were later replaced by circuit houses, although some have been maintained and continue in use, as the lodges at the Sipahijola and Radhanagari wildlife sanctuaries.

He has written twenty-two published books to date, including most recently the philosophical work, The God Book, and political works, Two Models of Government and Anglo-American Law: A Comparison. Previously published books include The Handbook of Human Rights Law, Principles of the Common Law, The U.S. Constitution for Dummies (part of Wiley's For Dummies series), and The Problem with Human Rights Law. Early life and education Michael Arnheim was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a secular orthodox Jewish family. His father, Dr Wilhelm Arnheim, who had come to South Africa from Germany in 1933, was a medical doctor and a polymath with a dry sense of humor. His mother, Victoria (\\"Vicky\\", née Shames) was a music teacher and an active member of the Council of Johannesburg's Great Synagogue. She was born in South Africa of Lithuanian-born parents, her father, Wolf Shames, being a noted rabbinical scholar. Michael Arnheim was particularly close to his paternal grandmother, Martha Arnheim (née Bernhardt, always called \\"Oma\\"), from whom he learnt German and by whom he was entertained with her amusing tales of life in Baerwalde, Pomerania, in pre- World War I Germany. Oma's husband (Michael Arnheim's grandfather), Max Arnheim, a prosperous barrel manufacturer, served in the German army in World War I, and Oma's father, Julius Bernhardt, fought proudly on the Prussian side in the Danish- Prussian War of 1864, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. As a 14-year-old student at King Edward VII School in Johannesburg, Arnheim was picked to join the \\"Quiz Kids\\" team of five capped and gowned teenagers, appearing on South Africa's Springbok Radio, and of which he became a stalwart member, \\"retiring\\" at the age of eighteen. He entered Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand at the age of 16, he took a first-class B.A. in History and Classics at the age of 19, first-class Honours at 20 and an M.A. with distinction at the age of 21. right He then went up to St John's College, Cambridge, on a National Scholarship (later converted to a St John's College scholarship supplemented by a Strathcona Travel Exhibition). Besides his academic pursuits (including teaching numerous undergraduates) he engaged in student politics, being elected a member of the Junior Combination Room committee and College NUS secretary, in which capacity he represented the College at several national conferences, including one in 1968 at which he proposed a widely supported motion to the effect that the English A-Level system was unduly narrow and should be broadened. He captained the College's University Challenge team, which displayed a hedgehog as its mascot by way of a gentle ribbing of the then Master of St John's, John Boys Smith, who had just published a paper on the subject. Arnheim had as his Ph.D. supervisor A.H.M. (\\"Hugo\\") Jones, then Cambridge Professor of Ancient History, and John Crook as his college mentor, who was to occupy the position of Professor of Ancient History later on. Career In 1969, at the age of 25, Arnheim was awarded his Cambridge Ph.D. His doctoral dissertation was subsequently published by the Oxford University Press under the title The Senatorial Aristocracy in the Later Roman Empire.Amazon.com page for The Senatorial Aristocracy in the Later Roman Empire. In the meantime Arnheim was elected a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, where he did a great deal of teaching for a number of colleges while researching his next book, Aristocracy in Greek Society (1977), which he was invited by Professor Howard Hayes Scullard to write as part of the prestigious Thames & Hudson series, Aspects of Greek and Roman Life. At the age of 31 Arnheim was invited to take up the position of full Professor and Head of the Department of Classics back at his old university in South Africa. During this time he devised a new system of learning Latin, which he would later integrate into a new approach to the learning of European languages in general. In 1979 he published South Africa after Vorster, which predicted that the alternative to White rule was not a shared-power democracy between Blacks and Whites, as White liberals argued, but rule by a Black oligarchy at the expense of Whites and ordinary Blacks alike.Christopher Coker, \\"Boputhatswana and the South African Homelands,\\" The World Today, Vol. 39, No. 6 (Jun., 1983), pp. 231-240. Arnheim's next book. Is Christianity True? (1984), caused quite a stir and was translated into several languages, including Spanish. Through a close re-examination of the historical evidence the book asserted that most Christian beliefs about Jesus were untrue.Robert P. Carroll, Review, \\"Is Christianity True? By Michael Arnheim\\", Scottish Journal of Theology, Volume 38 / Issue 02 / May 1985, pp 252-255. One review wrote: Despite this, Arnheim was invited to address Professor Henry Chadwick's Patristics seminar in the Cambridge Divinity School. Despondent about the future of South Africa, Arnheim returned to Britain, where he was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn in 1988, and went into practice as a London barrister specializing in civil litigation, with a certain amount of criminal defence on the side, notably the Cardiff Prison Riot trial in 1992. Arnheim, in 1992, was an early voice in the legal profession to adamantly insist that a person could face criminal liability for knowingly concealing their HIV- positive status from a sexual partner.DC Ormerod, MJ Gunn, \\"Criminal Liability for the Transmission of HIV\\", Web Journal of Current Legal Issues, 1996, quoting Arnheim in The Guardian, June 24, 1992. His civil law practice has been largely in the field of commercial litigation including some international litigation as of counsel to Brown & Welsh P.C. of Meriden, Connecticut. From early on in his practice at the Bar, Arnheim wrote articles in favor of clients' being allowed to come direct to a barrister, thus avoiding the additional expense of having to be referred by a solicitor. His pleas fell on deaf ears until the idea was taken up in a hard-hitting report by the Director of Fair Trading, Sir John Vickers, published in 2000. Arnheim was one of the first barristers to register for direct public access when this was eventually allowed in 2004. Arnheim has also written extensively on other legal topics, ranging from court procedure to the common law, constitutional law, judicial power and human rights. Ideas Dr Arnheim at a book-signing at the Tattered Cover Bookstore, Denver, Colorado, in September, 2016. Arnheim is known for his ideas in several fields, notably religion, history, politics, and law. Religion The God Book (2015), a sequel to Is Christianity True? (1984), is a thoroughgoing critique of atheism and conventional religion alike. The book argues that atheism and conventional religion are both deficient in credibility as well as in toleration. Arnheim prefers Deism, or the belief in an impersonal God who does not get involved in the day-to-day affairs of the world.Dr Michael Arnheim, My Challenge to Richard Dawkins and Jonathan Sacks: Why Both Atheists And Religious People Are Wrong, Huffington Post, Posted: 20/10/2015 17:36 BST Updated: 20/10/2015 17:59 BST Arnheim additionally authored an article entitled \\"God Without Religion\\" for publication in Pandeism: An Anthology (2017).Amazon.com page for Pandeism: An Anthology. History & Politics Arnheim's Cambridge Ph.D. thesis, published by the Oxford University Press in 1972 under the title The Senatorial Aristocracy in the Later Roman Empire, offered a new explanation of the \\"decline and fall\\" of the Roman Empire in the West. Arnheim contended that the reason the Western Empire fell was that the central government in the West was sapped from within by the senatorial aristocracy, who now again dominated the top administrative posts while building up their own countervailing local power through the spread of large estates. As a result, the central government proved unable to withstand the \\"barbarian\\" incursions. The same rise of the senatorial aristocracy did not occur in the Eastern half of the Empire, which therefore survived for another thousand years, albeit in a gradually shrinking state. This analysis itself was based on a new theory about the essential nature of governmental power, namely that there are and have ever been essentially only two models of government: (a) where power is concentrated in the hands of a minority, whether hereditary or not; and (b) where power is concentrated in the hands of a single individual. This analysis was also the subject of Aristocracy in Greek Society (1977). The same model was then tested and found to apply to modern history and the present-day world as well. This is the theme of Two Models of Government, published in 2016. Law left In 1994 Arnheim was invited to edit a volume of essays on the Common Law in the prestigious Dartmouth series, and published in the US by New York University Press. This book was followed up by Principles of the Common Law (2004), which sought to restate some basic principles of the Common Law that had been lost sight of in recent years. Arnheim was invited by Butterworths to write a book on the drafting of settlement agreements: Drafting Settlements of Disputes: A Guide for Litigators (1994). In 2000 he was asked by Butterworths to write (together with District Judge Christopher Tromans) a guide to the new procedural rules that had just been introduced: Civil Courts Practice and Procedure Handbook. The Handbook of Human Rights Law, published by Kogan Page in 2004, provided a whole new take on the subject focusing particularly on the way human rights law had been hijacked by special interest groups made up notably of illegal immigrants, asylum seekers, terrorist suspects and even convicted killers. This theme was picked up in the booklet written at the invitation of the Civitas thinktank titled The Problem with Human Rights Law (2015), in which it was argued that the unduly \\"politically correct\\" tenor of human rights court decisions in the United Kingdom were largely the fault not of the European Court of Human Rights, as the British Government believed, but of the domestic judiciary. Judicial supremacism has been a recurrent theme of many of Arnheim's articles, notably the article titled \\"Five Centuries of Legal Thinking\\" that he was invited by St John's College, Cambridge, to write on the 500th anniversary of the foundation of the College.The Eagle, 2011, Volume 93. Judicial supremacism also figures quite prominently in Two Models of Government. Arnheim was delighted to be asked to write the U.S. Constitution for Dummies (2009) as part of the well-known Wileys series of books with their distinctive black-and-yellow covers. To accommodate Arnheim's own opinions the publishers created two new icons, one for \\"In my Opinion\\" and the other for \\"Controversy\\". The Foreword for the first edition was written by Senator Ted Cruz. The Foreword is omitted from the second edition.

His father, Maximilian von Buri (1825–1902), was a jurist who served as a judge of the Reichsgericht from 1879 to 1896 and his great grandfather Ludwig von Buri (1746–1806) was a childhood friend of Goethe.Paul Wentzcke, Buri, Christian Karl Friedrich Ludwig von.

Buri received his education at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg, the Universität Straßburg and Leipzig University. Diplomatic career Buri started his civil service career in 1881 in the Reichskolonialamt ('Imperial Colonial Office') serving as a councillor and was appointed Resident Commissioner in the Marshall Islands protectorate, as a part of the German New Guinea. Buri carried on the negotiations which resulted in the Tripartite Convention of 1899 which decided the question of the Samoan Islands, dividing the island group between Germany and the United States. Joining the Imperial Foreign Office in 1886, Buri commenced his diplomatic career abroad as Vice-Consul in the British Protectorate of Zanzibar in 1889.

However, before the first unit could be completed, the program was cancelled in the early 1970s, and the unfinished hull was scrapped. After Sino-Soviet split, China realized its navy, PLAN, was no match for the Soviet navy, and in the event of Soviet invasion, PLAN has to withdraw to coastal waters and even inland waterways to fight a guerrilla warfare against the much stronger opponent, so smaller submarines such as mini or midget subs are much more suited for fighting the underwater guerrilla war. In addition, smaller subs were also able to be mass-produced. In 1964, the deputy commander-in- chief of PLAN, Vice admiral Zhao Qi-Min (赵启民) formally issued the order to develop a mini/midget submarine, and the 701st Research Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) was tasked to issue the requirement, which eventually named as Type 030 in 1965 when the winning design was selected from several proposals. Because the mini/midget sub was intended to operate in riverine and coastal region, the speed requirement is only 12 kt max, and hence propulsion requirement of the boat only rated at 320 kW. The general designer of Type 030 was Mr. Li Jian-Qiu (李建球), the general designer of Type 033G/G1. However, due to the unrealistic requirement of packing large amount of equipment and weaponry into a very small hull, the internal space is very cramped and production had to be stopped several time for redesign. As a result, production was protracted, with the first boat was still not completed in the early 1970s after construction begun in June 1968, and as PLAN changed its doctrine in the early 1970s, midget or mini submarine was no longer a priority, and in 1973, the program was finally cancelled by PLAN, and with the successful development of larger Type 033 and Type 035, the unfinished first unit was broken up and scrapped. The electric motor of Type 030 was kept at the PLAN Naval Engineering University for exhibition.

In 1958, PLAN demanded the need of more powerful gunboats and ordered the design to be carried out by individual fleets/bases. The new gunboats must have greater displacement, endurance/range, and firepower than the 75 ton gunboat in service. PLAN No. 4810 Factory of Lushunkou base completed design of Type 0105 gunboat and a total of three went into the service. In 1960, China decided to produce Soviet M-1 gas turbine engine. Harbin Marine Steam and Turbine Research Institute, or more commonly known as the 703rd Institute of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation (CSIC) was tasked with design and later reverse engineering after Sino-Soviet split, with Wen Xue-You (闻雪友) as the general designer of the gas turbine. The reverse engineered Soviet M-1 gas turbine was given the Chinese designation Type 404, and the manufacturing of this Chinese version was assigned to Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant (上海汽轮机厂, STP), the predecessor and subsidiary of Shanghai Electric Power Generation Group (上海电气集团股份有限公司, SEPG). STP had never produced any gas turbines before, but nonetheless completed the first sample by 1960, and test begun the following year. Due to the political turmoil in China at the time, namely, the Great Leap Forward, the program was plagued with problems, and it took several years to correct the problems, and it was not until three years later in the beginning of 1964 when the prototype finally meet all design parameters originally specified. In March 1964, the first Type 404 was authorized to be installed on a Type 0105 boat for sea trials. A Type 0105 with hull number 595 was selected to be redesigned to incorporate Type 404 gas turbine engine, and the general designer for the boat redesign was Chen Xie-Wen (陈协文), with Li Meng-Xuan (李荫轩) as the general designer of the propulsion system. The construction of the gas turbine powered boat was assigned to Jiangnan Shipyard, and the boat was handed to PLAN in 1967. Due to the significant weight change, original weaponry had to be adjusted and additional measure had to be taken into consideration for stability. The first stage of sea trials was plagued with problems, starting with the gas turbine engine could not start, so air inlet had to be redesigned. A much more serious problem was that some of the components broke apart and damaged the engine, which could only be taken out at Jiangnan Shipyard, so the boat had to be towed back to the shipyard for repair. As a result, the aluminum alloy used to make these components was replaced by steel, and frame that supports the components was also redesigned. In addition, manufacturing technique was also modified, with arc welding replaced the original spot welding. Although the gas turbine engine itself encountered numerous difficulties in the first stage of the sea trials, other subsystems of the boat were successful, such as the redesigned main gun system developed by the 713rd Research Institute of CSIC, and the stabilization system developed by the 704th Research Institute of CSIC. After half a decade redesign and rework, the second stage of the sea trials begun with the new Type 404 gas turbine engine October 1969. Extensive trials were conducted, including sea trials from Shanghai to Dalian and Qingdao, as well as riverine trials in inland waterway from Shanghai to Wuhan in the Yangtze River. In November 1970, the sea trial concluded and the boat formally reentered service with PLAN in 1971. However, due to the political turmoil in China at the time, namely, Cultural Revolution, logistic and technical support could not keep up with the demand of the gas turbine engine, and the boat was retired as a combatant in 1977, and subsequently converted to a dispatch boat numbered Dong-Jiao (东交) 61, and served until mid-1980s until its final retirement from PLAN.

It was completed in 1626 to commemorate the victories of Ferdinand I of Tuscany over the Ottomans. It is the most famous monument of Livorno and is located in Piazza Micheli. Created by Pietro Tacca, the monument takes its name from the four bronze statues of \\"Moorish\\" slaves that are found at the base of an earlier work consisting of the statue of Ferdinando I and its monumental pedestal. History In 1617, Cosimo II contracted sculptor Pietro Tacca to create the monument to commemorate his father, Ferdinando I. The completed monument was installed in Livorno in 1626. It features four bronze statues of enslaved prisoners chained at the base of a statue of Ferdinando I which had been commissioned at an earlier date. The physical characteristics of three of the statues represent people of the southern Mediterranean coast while the fourth statue has characteristics of a black African. Although the four chained prisoners are meant to represent the victories of Ferdinando I over the Ottomans, there may also be a different interpretation due to the presence of the statue with the black African characteristics; Ferdinando II, grandson of Ferdinando I, completed the monument and he may also have been involved in slave trade activities in West Africa in the 1660s, in cooperation with the Genoans. The four Moors symbolise the four corners of the world. Tacca's design of the Moors monument is assumed to have been influenced by three columns in the shape of African men supporting a balcony in Via Carriona in Carrara. The three sculptures are depicted as suffering from the weight they bear supporting the iron structure. Influence Detail of the monument showing the statue with black African characteristics The monument of the four Moors influenced sculptural design for several decades. A fountain in Marino features four statues of similarly chained prisoners, two of whom possess black African characteristics. The structure was constructed between 1632–1642 to commemorate Marcantonio Colonna's participation in the battle of Lepanto in 1571 which led to the defeat of the Ottomans. The monument of the four Moors also influenced Bernini's creation of the Fountain of the Four Rivers (Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi). Bernini may have also been influenced by the Marino monument in his design of the Fountain. The ostentatious design of the tomb of Doge Giovanni Pesaro, which was built in 1669 in Venice, and is found in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari close to the Pesaro Altarpiece, was perhaps strongly influenced by Tacca's monument of the four Moors.

Jiangnan Shipyard was tasked to build 20 boats in four batches, 4 each for first two batches, and 6 each for the 2nd batches. Construction begun on May 15, 1952 and after half a year, all 20 were completed. Hull number was numbered from 501 thru 520. The remaining 10 boats were built by Qingdao Shipyard, more commonly known as PLAN No 4808 Factory, the predecessor of current Qingdao Shipyard Co. Ltd. (青岛造船厂有限公司). This first generation gunboat built by PRC mostly utilizes leftover American components when communist took over, with the propulsion system being three diesel engines built by General Motors. Most armament comes from leftover Japanese weaponry. The boat was armed with two Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun, with one each at bow and stern respectively. A Japanese heavy machine gun was mounted at the port and starboard sides. Some of the boats have been upgraded with former Soviet 37 mm automatic air defense gun M1939 (61-K) replaced the forward 25 mm, and this upgraded version is designated as Type 52A (52 Jia Xing, 52甲型).

The division was withdrawn to re-form in the reserve of the Western Front in the area of Vyshny Volochyok. The division was part of the \\"operational army\\" in the following periods: 26/09/1941 - 22/04/1944, 28/05/1944 - 09/05/1945. In the fall of 1941 and winter of 1941-1942's as part of 49th Army Western Front, the division participated in the defensive battles near Moscow. The division successfully acted in the course of the Moscow counter-offensive and the subsequent general offensive of Soviet troops. On October 4, 1941 in the region of Mtsensk and, in the area of Bryansk Front, a Stavka order hastily concentrated reserve units, from which was formed 1st Guards Rifle Corps, which the division joined. However, due to the worsening of the situation on the Western Front, the same day the division was reassigned to the 49th Army and its trains directed via Gorbachev to Sukhinichi. In October 5 Division began to advance to the Medyn to attack in the Yukhnov as well. In early October, the heroic actions of the division as it aimed to help the 49th Army confirmed the validity of the assignment of the division's Guards title. By 1 November 1941, the division was with 49th Army, alongside 7th Guards Rifle Division and 60th Rifle Division.Combat composition of the Soviet Army With 11th Guards Army of the 3rd Belorussian Front May 1945.

The tower, built by developer Crescent Heights, has 800 apartments and rises making it the city's tallest rental apartment building. NEMA is currently the eighth-tallest building in Chicago and the forty first-tallest building in the United States. It is the tallest all-rental residential building in the city. NEMA is designed by Rafael Viñoly as the first of a three phase development that includes an even taller 648-unit structure as the second phase and a 100-unit townhouse development with a public park as the third phase. Building interiors are designed by David Rockwell. History Despite the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the resulting softening market in 2007, Gerald Fogelson, co-chairman and chief executive of Central Station Development Corp., had sought approval for a 73-story Grant Park Tower III at the 113 East Roosevelt location in 2008. An 83-story Grant Park Tower IV at Michigan and Roosevelt was also planned to begin preconstruction sales in 2009. Miami developer Crescent Heights acquired the real estate for the development in 2012 for $29.5 million. The development was presented in a community meeting on September 22, 2015. The Chicago Plan Commission approved the development on November 19, 2015 in a meeting that also resulted in the approval of the Wanda Vista tower. The building will be located on a site once used for Illinois Central Railroad tracks in the 1960s. On January 4, 2017, the name of the building was changed to One Grant Park after a 203 million financing loan was announced for the 792-unit, 829-foot, 76-story, luxury residential building. In 2018, the name was changed again to NEMA, a lifestyle brand with sister buildings in San Francisco and a project in development in Boston. During the second quarter of 2019, occupants began taking residence. In mid-2019 Crescent Heights refinanced its original construction loans with KKR Real Estate Finance Trust in order to lower its interest rates by about 80 basis points. By that time, 35 percent of the apartments had been leased. The development sits adjacent to the southwest corner of Grant Park. Originally, the name 113 East Roosevelt was associated with the whole three phase development and reflects the address on Roosevelt Road (at the corner of Indiana Avenue) of Phase I of the development. To its west Phase II of the development will occur and will be a residential building at Roosevelt Road and Michigan Avenue. Phase III of the development is for townhouses and a public park on Indiana Avenue to the east of the two towers. The designs of the towers in the development feature architectural elements, such as “square structural bays of varying stacked heights” that pay homage to Willis Tower. Similar to Willis Tower, the building uses a \\"bundled tube\\" configuration, consisting of nine interlocked steel tubes as its framing system, and concrete walls extending to perimeter columns for wind protection. An alternate address for the location is 1210 South Indiana Avenue. The building is the tallest residential apartment tower in Chicago. It is taller than any building on the South Side of Chicago, surpassing its neighbor One Museum Park. The building has 70,000 square feet of amenities, including an outdoor Grant Park and Lake Michigan viewing platform; co-working space; a fitness center and spa with basketball, squash, yoga and a regulation-size boxing ring; golf simulator; indoor / outdoor swimming pool; game room; kids room; and a private dining ballroom.

The museum, which was never built, was to be the core of a cultural center which was part of a planned general rebuilding of the city intended to have it surpass Vienna and rival Budapest. Life and career Posse was the son of Otto Adalbert Posse, an historian and archivist who was director of the Saxon Central State Archive in Dresden. The younger Posse studied art history, archaeology and history in Marburg and Vienna, and received his doctorate in 1903 in Vienna under Franz Wickhoff with a thesis on the 17th century Roman painter Andrea Sacchi. Posse's museum career began that same year as a volunteer at the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, where he soon became the assistant to and protegé of Wilhelm von Bode, the museum's director.Spotts (2002), p.189 Posse made a name for himself in the world of art history by his handling of the museum's collections of German, Dutch and English paintings; a two-volume inventory catalog was published in 1911. He spent several years in Florence as an assistant at the city's German Institute of Art History, and in Rome as a researcher at the Bibliotheca Hertziana, which resulted in a work on the ceiling paintings of Pietro da Cortona. His later publications would investigate Lucas Cranach and the German Impressionist Robert Sterl. In 1910, at age 31, thanks in large part to the efforts of Bode, Posse was appointed to be the director of the Dresden Picture Gallery, also known as the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (\\"Old Master's Gallery\\") or simply the \\"Dresden Gallery\\". Dresden Gallery Posse reorganized the museum along the new ideas of Bode, and built up its holdings of German paintings, primarily from the 19th century, paying particular attention to the Dresden Romantics. Called up for military service in World War I, he wrote to Bode from the front lines in 1914 \\"I would be very happy to participate in the division of the Louvre.\\" After the war, from the summer of 1919, he began to add expressionist works to the museum. He was a significant supporter and friend of Oskar Kokoschka, the Austrian expressionist artist, poet and playwright, who was at the time a professor at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and become a lodger in Posse's apartment. When Posse put together the German contribution to the XIII Venice Biennale in 1922, he featured Kokschka's work. As curator of the Dresden International Art Exhibition 1926 and both the 1922 and 1930 Venice Biennales, Posse advocated for avant-garde works to be considered as a legitimate part of the German art world. This stance provoked bitter opposition from German nationalist artists, whose attacks he suffered from 1926 on. In his speech on 12 June 1926 for the opening of the International Art Exhibition, Posse emphasized the international orientation of Dresden's contemporary art life, which was necessary for the artists of Dresden to remain relevant, and avoid the stagnation of provincialism and possible extinction. He also pointed out the strategic importance of the Exhibition as a window to the international world of art, especially after the isolation of the war years. In 1931 Posse founded the New Masters Gallery on Brühl's Terrace in Dresden, which was based on the Dresden Gallery's \\"Modern Department\\" collection of 19th and 20th century paintings, including Romantics, Expressionists and Impressionist works. Relationship with the Nazis Adolf Hitler's National Socialist German Worker's Party (NSDAP, commonly called the Nazi Party), had, following their leader's example, long taken a strong stance against all modern art styles, which it called \\"degenerate art\\" or \\"Bolshevik art\\". After Hitler was appointed Chancellor in January 1933 - the so-called \\"seizure of power\\" - the Nazi Party in Dresden launched a smear campaign against Posse, accusing him of displaying \\"degenerate art\\" in the museum, and claiming, inaccurately, that he was partly Jewish. At least one of his attackers, Walter Gasch, was motivated by a desire for Posse's job.Spotts (2002), pp.190-91 Posse was nevertheless able to keep his position, at least temporarily, by distancing himself from the Modernist works he had previously championed. He argued that of the 310 works added to the collection under his leadership, only 33 were dated after 1910, that many of those were gifts and on loan, and he had received them only in the spirit of helping local artists.Spotts (2002), p.190 At about the same time, Posse - whose housekeeper and future wife had joined the Nazi Party in 1931 - applied to become a party member, and received his interim membership card in December 1933. His opponents, however, prevented him from becoming a full member; he remained a provisional member of the Party until June 1934, when his membership was finally rejected. In December 1937, the Nazi campaign resulted in the confiscation and sale of 56 paintings from the New Masters Gallery, including works by Edvard Munch, Max Beckmann and Emil Nolde, and on 7 March 1938 Posse was summoned to answer for having hung these paintings. It was suggested that he retire, but he refused and took a leave of absence instead. Nevertheless, he was fired, only to be rehabilitated by Hitler, probably through the influence of art dealer Karl Haberstock, who often sold paintings to the Fùhrer, as well as to Posse for the Dresden Gallery. Hitler visited Dresden on 18 June 1938, and questioned Posse about his dismissal. He asked for and examined the documents connected with the firing, and made the decision that Posse should get his position back. He and Martin Bormann were led through the museum by Posse.Spotts (2002), p.191 Hitler's Special Envoy A year later, on 20 June 1939, Hitler summoned Posse to his summer home, the Berghof, and told him that he wanted Posse to be the head of what would be perhaps the most massive art acquisition project in history, the gathering of paintings and other art works for Hitler's planned art museum in Linz, Austria, the city Hitler considered to be his hometown. What came to be called the \\"Führermuseum\\" - which was never built - was to be the core of a cultural center which was part of a general rebuilding of the city intended to have it surpass Vienna and rival Budapest. Posse's job would be to supplement Hitler's own previously purchased collection of mostly 19th century Germanic Romantic paintings. According to Posse's diary, Hitler told him that the museum would contain \\"only the best of all periods from the prehistoric beginnings of art ... to the nineteenth century and recent time,\\" and the works were to be obtained both by purchase and by confiscation. \\"You are ... to deal only with me. I shall make the decisions,\\" Posse was told.Spotts (2002), p.187 The next day, Hitler set up the Sonderauftrag Linz (\\"Special Commission: Linz\\") in Dresden and appointed Posse as his special envoy. A few days later, on 26 June, Hitler signed a letter intended to give Posse the authority he would need to do the job. He wrote: > I commission Dr. Hans Posse, Director of Dresden Gallery, to build up the > new art museum for Linz Donau. All Party and State services are ordered to > assist Dr. Posse in fulfillment of his mission.Edsel with Witter (2009), > p.15 Although Hitler had favored German and Austrian paintings from the 19th century, Posse's focus was on early German, Dutch, French, and Italian paintings.Enderlein, Angelika; Flacke, Monika and Löhr, Hanns Christian. \\"Database on the Sonderauftrag Linz (Special Commission: Linz): History of the Linz collection German Historical Museum The Sonderauftrag not only collected art for the Führermuseum, but also for other museums in the German Reich, especially in the eastern territories. The artworks would have been distributed to these museums after the war. The Sonderauftrag had approximately 20 specialists attached to it: \\"curators of paintings, prints, coins, and armor, a librarian, an architect, an administrator, photographers, and restorers.\\"Plaut (1946) The sizable staffFest (1975), p.530 included Robert Oertel and Gottfried Reimer of the Dresden Gallery, Friedrich Wolffhardt, an SS officer, as curator of books and autographs; Leopold Rupprecht of the Kunsthistorisches Museum as curator for armour, and Fritz Dworschak, also of that museum, as curator for coins.Spotts (2002), pp.192-93;212 Collecting for Linz In the late summer and autumn of 1939, Posse traveled a number of times to Vienna to the Central Depot for confiscated art in the Neue Burg to pick out art pieces for the Linz museum, and in October he gave to Martin Bormann, for Hitler's approval, the list of artworks confiscated from the Vienna Rothschilds which Posse had selected for the museum. These included works by Hans Holbein the Elder, van Dyck, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Tintoretto, Gerard ter Borch and Francesco Guardi, among others.Spotts (2002), p.198 These 182 pieces were included in Posse's July 1940 list of 324 paintings he had chosen for the museum's collection. Other works which Hans Posse purchased in Vienna for the Linz collection included Vermeer's The Artist in his Studio, Titian's The Toilet of Venus, Antonio Canova's Polyhymnia, and several works by Rembrandt. Among the many painting Haberstock sold to the collection were two Rembrandts, one of which, Portrait of Hendrickje Stoffels is now thought to be from the Rembrandt workshop and not a work of the master. Oddly, Hitler purchased these for an inflated price, despite the fact that seller was a partly Jewish woman and the paintings could have been confiscated. Posse also purchased over 200 pieces which Jewish owners had managed to get into Switzerland, where they were safe from confiscation. On the other hand, Posse did not shy away from confiscation either, particularly in the former Czechoslovakia and Poland, where all property was subject to it, but also in the Netherlands.Spotts (2002), p.198-202 Posse also went to Poland to examine confiscated artworks there, selecting works by Leonardo, Raphael, and Rembrandt for the museum in Linz, although these pieces never actually left the control of the General Government, the rump of Poland left after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union took the territory they wanted. On 10 June 1940, Posse wrote to Bormann: > The special delegate for the safeguarding of art and cultural properties has > just returned from Holland. He notified me today that there exists at the > moment a particularly favorable opportunity to purchase valuable works of > art from Dutch dealers and private owners in German currency. Even though a > large number of important works have doubtless been removed recently from > Holland, I believe that the trade still contains many objects which are > desirable for the Führer's collection, and which may be acquired without > foreign exchange. As a result of this, accounts of about 500,000 Reichsmarks were opened in Paris and Rome for Posse's personal use, and, around July 1940, he expanded the scope of the Sonderauftrag Linz into Belgium and the Netherlands when he established an office in The Hague as Referent für Sonderfragen (Adviser on \\"Special Questions\\"). Posse was able to report to Bormann that as of March 1941 he had spent 8,522,348 Reichsmarks on artworks for the Führermuseum. He later bought most of the Mannheimer Collection in 1944, including Rembrandt's Jewish Doctor - assisted by the threat of confiscation from the Nazi government of Arthur Seyss-Inquart - with the remainder of the collection being purchased in the same manner in France later on. The collecting of the Sonderauftrag Linz includes many such cases of forced sale, using funds from sales of Hitler's book Mein Kampf and stamps showing his portrait. Members of the Sonderauftrag Linz made a considerable number of purchasing trips throughout Europe, acquiring a significant number of artworks, and also arranged purchases through art dealers.\\"The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz\\" Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism websiteSchwarz (2004), p. 83-110. When Posse went to France, he took the unscrupulous Haberstock with him, and the dealer, working through 82 local agents, purchased 62 pieces for the Linz collection, including works by Rembrandt, Brueghel, Watteau and Rubens.Spotts (2002) p.206 In the \\"authoritarian anarchy\\"Fest (1975), p.419 and \\"administrative chaos\\"*Kershaw, Ian (2000) Hitler: 1936-45: Nemesis New York: Norton. p.569. that was typical of the way the Third Reich operated, the Sonderauftrag Linz was not the only Nazi agency collecting art works. In France, as in many other countries in Europe, the office of Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (Special Purposes Reich Leader Rosenberg, ERR) was the primary agency. Hitler issued on 18 November 1940 a directive, a Führerbefehl similar to the ones he had issued for Poland and Austria, announcing his prerogative over all confiscated art in the occupied Western territories. Rosenberg thus became a formal procurement agent for the Führermuseum. This apparently brought about some internecine squabbling, as Posse had been given the authority to act on Hitler's behalf, and the German commanders of occupied countries were required to keep him regularly informed about their confiscations of artwork. Probably because of the interference of Hermann Göring - who was busy using the ERR to confiscate art for himself - Posse formally requested that the Reich Chancellery reiterate his power to act for the Führer. The result was a \\"general high-level directive\\" confirming Hitler's primacy through Posse, and a direction to Posse to review the ERR's inventory in regard to the needs of the planned museum in Linz. S.A. Gruppenführer Prince Philipp of Hessen was a connoisseur of the arts and architecture and acted as Posse's principal agent in Italy, where he lived with his wife, a daughter of King Victor Emmanuel. A grandson of the German Emperor Frederick III, and a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, Philipp provided \\"a veneer of aristocratic elegance which facilitated important purchases from the Italian nobility.\\" Philipp assisted Posse in purchasing 90 paintings from Italy, and bought several more for the Linz collection on his own account.Spotts (2002), p.210 Another dealer used by Hans Posse was Hildebrand Gurlitt, through whom he made expensive purchases of tapestries, paintings and drawings. In October 1939, Hitler and Benito Mussolini had made an agreement that any Germanic artworks in public museums in the South Tyrol - a traditionally German-speaking area which had been given to Italy after the First World War in return for entering the war on the side of the Triple Entente - could be removed and returned to Germany, but when Posse attempted to do so, with the assistance of Heinrich Himmler's Ahnenerbe, the Italians managed to keep putting things off, and no repatriations ever took place.Spotts (2002), p.211 Relationship with Hitler Hitler was pleased with Posse's work - the curator became of one the few people whose artistic opinion Hitler respectedSpotts (2002), p.155 - and in 1940 awarded him the honorific of \\"Professor\\",Spotts (2002), p.193 something the Führer did for many of his favorites in the arts, such as Leni Riefenstahl, the actress and film director; architects Albert Speer and Hermann Giesler; sculptors Arno Breker and Josef Thorak; Wilhelm Furtwängler, conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic; actor Emil Jannings; and photographer Heinrich Hoffmann; among others.Spotts (2002), p.79Joachimsthaler, Anton The Last Days of Hitler: The Legends, the Evidence, the Truth.

History On 5 May 1845, a committee comprising Reverend Hermann Randall von Dadelszen, Colonel James Campbell, Colonel William Henry Slade (Royal Engineers), Captain Nelson (Royal Engineers), Lieutenant Albert Watson (Ceylon Rifle Regiment), Mr E. R. Power (Ceylon Civil Service), Mr H. C. Selby, Mr C. Temple and Mr E. F. Gepp met to discuss the construction of a church in Nuwara Eliya, at an estimated cost of £900. Captain Nelson designed the building with the construction work done chiefly by the officers and men of the local garrison of the 15th Regiment, under the supervision of Major James Brunker. It took seven years after building commenced for the church to be completed. Upon its completion it was consecrated by Bishop James Chapman on 24 February, 1852 (St. Matthias’ Day).The first vicar of the Holy Trinity Church, from 1843 to 1846, was Rev. von Dadelszen. In the late 1890s the congregation proposed enlarging the Church, there was however some opposition, who proposed the construction of a new Church near the old cemetery. The majority of the congregation however preferred the existing site. In 1889 the church was enlarged. The original portion of the building is at the church's western end. The additions can be noted by the difference in size of the corbels supporting the main rafters. On 18 April 1954 Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh attended services at the Holy Trinity church, with the Queen gifting a blue carpet and a stained glass window in remembrance of their visit. Queen Elizabeth II commemorative stained glass window In 2001 the 100 year old Pipe Organ, which had been out of order for over 30 years, was restored at a cost of approximately half a million rupees. There are a number of memorial plaques on the church walls including Dr. G. Gardner, Superintendent of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Peradeniya; Captain William Fisher, father of Lord John Fisher, who was thrown off his horse and killed; Reginald Beauchamp Downall, tea planter, Legislative Council member; and Lady Carolina Ridgeway, wife of Sir Joseph West Ridgeway, Governor of Ceylon.

He was one of the earliest proponents of house music and has been instrumental in spreading the genre on both sides of the Atlantic. Humphries' work encompasses studio production and remixes, radio slots on WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM and Hot 97, and DJ residencies at clubs including Club Zanzibar (Newark, New Jersey) and Ministry of Sound in London, UK. Early life Born in Brooklyn in 1957, Tony Humphries began collecting records at age ten. Humphries' passion for music was encouraged from a very early age. His father, Rene, had emigrated from Colombia some years earlier, before going on to lead the New York Combo. Rene \\"El Grande Combo\\" Humphries, as he was known, performed alongside salsa performers including Tito Puente. The Zanzibar years Humphries began DJing at college and got his first professional gig in 1981 at the then-new New York station KISS-FM following a chance encounter with Shep Pettibone. His big break was in 1982, when he was asked by Shep Pettibone to fill in for a mix show on WRKS 98.7 Kiss-FM] in New York. Soon afterward, he was a regular contributor of the station's mastermixes—extended and remixed versions of popular songs—a process that had been pioneered on the station earlier by Pettibone. During most of the 1980s until 1994, Humphries had a mix show that aired on Kiss-FM every Friday and Saturday night. In 1982, Humphries got a residency at the Club Zanzibar, in Newark, New Jersey, home of the so-called Jersey Sound. Humphries and Club Zanzibar, alongside the Paradise Garage and its resident DJ Larry Levan, are considered to be the main driving forces behind the creation of garage house music. Europe By the late 1980s, bootleg tapes of Humphries's Kiss-FM radio shows had begun to make their way across the Atlantic. Alex Patterson from ambient house group The Orb was one such early disciple; \\"hearing proper DJs like Tony Humphries, that's what really got me into house music.\\" Humphries's earliest UK appearances were at club nights in London, such as Danny Rampling's Shoom and Norman Jay's High On Hope at Dingwalls. In the 1990s, as dance music grew in popularity in the UK and throughout Europe, Humphries was given a residency at the London superclub Ministry of Sound. He also recorded for the Ministry of Sound label and launched the Ministry of Sound Sessions series. Humphries plays regularly at Ibiza clubs such as Pacha. He also appears regularly on Kings of House tours alongside David Morales and \\"Little\\" Louie Vega. Studio work Humphries has a large back catalogue of studio production work. Remixes spanning a broad number of styles from artists make up the bulk of this output. Humphries has produced many DJ mixes and compilations. These include his work for Ministry of Sound, London's Fabric, Strictly Rhythm, DMC, and, returning to his roots, his Zanzibar Classics compilations.

Character Lamme Goedzak's name literally translates as \\"lazy http://www.vlaamswoordenboek.be/definities/term/lamme,+de+~+hebben kind soul\\", which already hints at his personality. Lamme is a jolly, good-natured, if somewhat naïve man. He functions as a sidekick to Ulenspiegel, with whom he shares his knack for fooling other people, especially clergymen and the Spanish invaders. While sometimes slow-witted Lamme is nevertheless Tijl's most loyal friend. Lamme is also known for being a Bruegelian bon vivant who enjoys eating and drinking . When depicted on book illustrations he is usually carrying food and wine. In the novel some information about Lamme's background history is provided. As a child he ran away from home because his younger sister taunted him and he wasn't assertive enough to do something about it. He is married, but lost track of his wife and desperately tries to find her back, while resisting the temptation of other women. Eventually, it turns out that the wife - a staunch Catholic while Goedzak himself is a Protestant - has been misled by an unscrupulous monk into taking a vow of abstinence. While searching for her, Goedzak along with Ulenspiegel is drawn into the Dutch Revolt against Spanish rule, and despite his fatness and indolence manages to prove his mettle in various perilous situations. Finally he finds an ideal slot as a ship's cook on one of the vessels of the Sea Beggars , the famed rebel/pirate fleet harassing the Spanish; it is commonly agreed that he could take as many extra helpings as he wants from his own excellent dishes. Eventually, after a long and hard search Goedzak finds back his wife, proves to her the hypocrisy of the monk, and they are happily reunited. Cultural status The boat trip Lamme Goedzak on the Damse Vaart The expression \\"lamme goedzak\\" has become an eponym in the Dutch language, referring to a \\"good, loveable, but naïve person, prone to being taken advantage of.\\" http://www.vlaamswoordenboek.be/definities/term/lamme+goedzak The term is also used for obese, jolly people who enjoying eating and drinking. Certain Flemish comics characters, like Lambik and Nero, have also been compared with Lamme Goedzak in terms of character.

Since then, the record has been beaten by American pilot Mason Andrews. Guthmiller also founded an early iPhone unlocking company, AnySIMiPhones, in 2007 at age 12. Biography Born and raised in Aberdeen, South Dakota, Guthmiller took an interest in aviation from a young age. Growing up he gradually drifted more toward math and science, in particular computer science, which led him to pursue several business ventures. He started his first company, AnySIMiPhones, at age 12, selling software to unlock the newly released iPhone, which at the time was only available in the U.S. and only on AT&T;, so that it could be used with any (GSM) cell carrier worldwide. After being in business for only a few weeks, Guthmiller sold his company to a similar company, FreeIt4Less, and joined their team. Together they unlocked around 20,000 iPhones in dozens of countries. As the unlocking market dried up after Apple announced the iPhone 3G and its availability in multiple markets in 2008, Guthmiller moved on to pursue his interest in finance. Guthmiller pursued several projects aimed at analyzing financial market data with supercomputers in order to uncover ways to predict the likelihood of future price movements. Solo flight around the world After getting bored one weekend in the summer of 2011, Guthmiller realized he could obtain his pilot certificate in a few months when he turned 17. Having wanted to fly his entire life, he convinced his parents to allow him to do a \\"$20, 20-minute intro flight\\" at a local flight school. He was instantly hooked. Soloing just a couple weeks later, he earned his private pilot certificate on his 17th birthday before going on to pursue an instrument rating, glider rating, his commercial pilot certificate, and a seaplane rating. After reading a May 3, 2013, article about 20-year-old Californian Jack Wiegand, who was about to become the youngest person to fly solo around the world, Guthmiller decided he wanted to attempt the same record. After a year of planning, Guthmiller left Gillespie Field in El Cajon, California (San Diego) on May 31, 2014, and 44 days, 12 hours later landed back at Gillespie on July 14, 2014 to become the youngest person to ever circumnavigate the globe by aircraft at 19 years, 7 months, and 15 days old. Spending 180 hours in a small, single-engine 1981 Beechcraft Bonanza, N367HP, he made 23 stops in 15 countries on 5 continents. The longest flight was 16.5 hours from Pago Pago, American Samoa to Hilo, Hawaii. In order to carry enough fuel for such long legs, Guthmiller had the rear four seats removed and extra fuel tanks installed and took off as much as 25% over the aircraft's maximum certificated takeoff weight (authorized by an FAA ferry permit). Guthmiller and the plane have since been featured at EAA Airventure Oshkosh and the National Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Center, and he shares his story with audiences around the country in various speaking engagements.

History In 1887, Lehmann Bernheimer bought a small coffee house and beer garden (owned and run by an Englishman) called the English Café. In its place was built the Bernheimer-Haus, which was officially opened in December 1889 by Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. Initially, the focus was on high-quality textiles, with the manufacture of luxury goods being slowly added. After a fire in 1897, the building was extended and antiques, tapestries and carpets were added. In 1918, his son Otto Bernheimer took over the business. In the late 1930s, he and his family were sent by the Nazis to Dachau concentration camp, but they were eventually allowed to emigrate to Venezuela. After the war, Otto Bernheimer returned, and in 1948, he moved into the art trade. Otto's grandson Konrad Bernheimer took over in 1977 and renamed the business as Bernheimer Fine Old Masters, since the company was specializing in Old Master paintings from the 16th to 19th centuries. In 1987, the Bernheimer-Haus was sold by Konrad Bernheimer to pay his co-heirs. In 2002, he bought Colnaghi of London, the oldest existing art dealer in the world.

Life Alice Brooke was born in 1840 to Francis and Juliana Brooke. After her mother's death, she was raised primarily by her paternal grandmother. In 1851 the 10 year old Alice was living with her widowed father in a large house in Suffolk, England, which included seven household servants and a governess.http://www.boddington- family.org.uk/bodington/families/display_person.php?p=177 She married Major General Edward William Derrington Bell in Suffolk in 1857. The marriage produced one live child Edward Bell (1866-1937) and ended in divorce in 1869 following Alice's adultery with Captain Tyesen Holrod who may have been Edward's biological father. Alice was remarried in 1873 to widower and physician Dr George Fowler Bodington. The couple had 4 children and remained married until her death in 1897. The Boddingtons moved to Canada in 1887 in search of new economic opportunities. Soon after their arrival, the family settled on a farm in the Fraser River valley. Farm life did not agree with Bodington. After her husband received a position as medical superintendent at a hospital, the family moved to New Westminster British Columbia in 1895.  Contributions  Bodington wrote about a wide variety of subjects including religion, race, marriage and evolution.Lightman, Bernard. (2007). Victorian Popularizers of Science: Designing Nature for New Audiences. University of Chicago Press. pp. 462-466. Her articles where printed in publications such as The American Naturalist, Popular Science Monthly, The Journal of Microscopy and Natural Science, and The Westminster Review. Her work remains an important window into the popular scientific culture of the 19th century and the climate of British imperialism. Her book Studies in Evolution and Biology, received a positive review in The American Naturalist. Bodington was an advocate of neo- Lamarckism.Anonymous. (1891). Review: Mrs. Bodington on Evolution. Reviewed Work: Studies in Evolution and Biology by Alice Bodington. The American Naturalist 25 (295): 647-648. She was an avid supporter of the dissemination of scientific literature, believing that scientific knowledge needed to be accessible to the people if it were to be of any real use to society. Bodington believed that many scientists lacked the ability to express their findings in a way clear and understandable to non-professionals. She viewed herself as a promoter of science and played a role similar to that of a modern pundit. In her writings for The Westminster Review, she discussed the development of the brain and argued the inferiority of Africans. Her single book was criticized for her comments questioning why writers on Science were meant to perform experiments.

Since then, the duo have created a wide range of art projects that have been internationally recognized and exhibited.Bigert & Bergström, accessed 16 March 2020 Their productions range through large-scale sculptures, installations, public portrayals, performance and film – often combined in multimedia works.  Artistic focus  With energetic inquisitiveness, the duo analyses and poses questions regarding current societal issues, often using humor as a tool. They tend to focus on scientific, climate-related and social issues, and the intersection between them.Belenius Gallery, accessed 16 March 2020 These topics define the theme, as well as the practical creation of the works – often through high-tech solutions, scientific foundations and various experimental elements.  Expressions through sculpture and installations  Whether created for an exhibition, a film or a public space, Bigert & Bergström's creations have certain common denominators in their forms of expression. Their works are often intended to be experienced through multiple senses; many sculptures exude warmth, vibrations, light and sound, or can be set in motion and change. Their works encourage, and sometimes require viewer- interaction. They are often constructed on a large scale, many times large enough to step into the work and experience it from inside. This angle of having the viewer physically step into the work, has been a feature of the duo’s creations since the very beginning. In the 1990s, Bigert & Bergström were best known for their climate chamber – a space in which the viewer could enter and be confronted with various types of extreme weather.Hedberg, Hans. “Symboliska gränssnitt, Bigert & Bergström på Axel Mörner.” Svenska Dagbladet, November 30, 1999. Other recurring elements are the funhouse mirrors, molecular, spherical and semi-spherical shapes. For these round forms, Bigert & Bergström have developed their own technique, which they call 'back projection.' It involves filming with a fisheye lens to project inverted images on rounded shapes.Bigert & Bergström, accessed 16 March 2020  Selected works = Rescue Blanket for Kebnekaise (2015)  Bigert & Bergström’s geoengineering performance was an attempt, a futile symbolic gesture to counteract the glacier melting of Kebnekaise, the highest mountain in Sweden, which gradually losing its elevation. In 2015 during the summer solstice, the mountain’s southern peak was covered with a five-hundred-square- meter golden climate-shade cloth, to preserve the glacier. The performance documentation and materials collected during the intervention turned into an installation entitled The Freeze.Bigert & Bergström, accessed 2 April 2020  Climate Chambers I (1994)  The large-scale installation consists of five chambers, which surround a centrally located incubator. By entering into the chambers, the audience experiences various climate extremes from heat to freeze. The installation intended to „test the boundaries between experience and endurance.” Climate Chambers I. In: Bigert & Bergström: Works 1986-2016. Stockholm: Art and Theory Publishing, 2017, 72. The work is not only challenging our perception and senses, but also raises the question of whether perceiving artworks is influenced by the atmospheric or ambient shifts.

Bigert & Bergström's work was inspired by the Biosphere II, an utopian experiment of self- supporting ecosystem, launched in 1984 in the Sonora Desert (Tucson, Arizona, USA). The artist duo's inverted biosphere were a gradually inflating tent. Inside, the audience could follow the artists' actions and relevance of various dioramas (melting ice-monoliths, mechanical greenhouse) through windows.

Since its debut, they have increasingly developed their characteristic forms of expression, combining facts and anecdotes with experiments, animations, sculptural installations and objects in what may be described as contemporary art documentaries. The Big Feed and several other films in the artists’ repertoire were commissioned by the Swedish Television, Sveriges Television. They have been aired in several cultural programmes, including Kobra (television programme) and K-special, and at many international film festivals.  The Climate Experiment (2018, 58 min. HD)  A film about Bigert & Bergström’s climate-related art, which for three decades has been inspired by research on the effects of climate on humanity and vice versa. The Climate Experiment tells the story of the growing realization of our own role in the changing climate. Our interference in the atmospheric cocktail could be described as the greatest experiment in human history. An experiment whose outcome is highly uncertain.Bigert & Bergström, accessed 22 March 2020  Moments of Silence (2014, 14 min. HD)  Moments of Silence consists of sampled archival materials from all sorts of occasions in which people have come together in a moment of silence to honor and mourn the victims of natural disasters and other tragedies, or to take a stand against terrorism and other acts of violence. The film reflects on how this worldwide ritual is one of the few activities in which all people, regardless of religion, ideology or cultural background, can come together in fellowship.Bigert & Bergström , accessed 7 July 2015  The Weather War (2012, 57 min. HD)  The film provides a historical and contemporary sketch of human attempts to tame the forces of weather. Many different weapons are used worldwide – Bangladesh builds barrier walls to protect against flooding, China aims rockets at threatening clouds, and Italy fires cannons at hail to protect the year’s wine harvest. Given this background, the film focuses on the question of how to deal with the ongoing climatic change – by adapting, or by waging war on the weather? In a quirky blend of land-art performance and old-fashioned road movie, Bigert & Bergström traveled to the tornado belt of the American Midwest with their mechanical sculpture, Tornado Diverter, to see if they can stop a tornado. This visionary machine is the brainchild of Russian scientist Vladimir Pudov. Newly retired when the duo contacted him, Pudov was no longer able to build his invention, but Bigert & Bergström were so fascinated by his machine that they decided to build it for him.  The Last Supper (2005, 57 min. 16 mm and DVD)  This film looks at the tradition of serving one last meal to condemned prisoners, a wish that has been granted as long as death sentences have been implemented. The tradition stems from ancient burial rituals, in which the deceased was served food on his deathbed to ensure that he would not come back to haunt the living as a hungry ghost. The modern ritual has no connection to its roots, and serving a last meal seems as anachronistic and absurd as the punishment itself. The film focuses on this gap between the historic meaning and the contemporary use of a tradition that has lost its meaning.Filmform , accessed 23 March 2020 The protagonist in the film is Brian Price, a former prisoner at Huntsville State Prison in Texas, who cooked over 200 last meals during his 14-year prison sentence.

The programme is delivered in the home by trained practitioners, over 18 to 20 sessions and focuses on 3 key areas: parent-infant/child interaction; home safety and child health.Churchill, G. (2015) Safecare: Evidence from a Home Based Parenting Programme for Neglect, London, NSPCC. https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research- reports/safecare-evidence-evaluation-report.pdf Theory of change The SafeCare programme's theory of change is based on social learning theory. Social Learning Theory suggests people learn by observing positive desired outcomes resulting from the observed behaviour. Attrition Attrition occurs when a parent who takes up a programme fails to complete it. In one study of the SafeCare programme, which was delivered to families where a professional judged there to be a risk of significant harm due to neglect, 73% of parents who signed up to the programme were unable to complete it in full. Nevertheless, practitioners identified a range of positive outcomes for families who exited the programme prior to completion. Evidence for effectiveness Evidence for the effectiveness of intervention programs can be divided into two types. One type is impact studies where the aim of the evaluation is to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in outcomes on a population, which can be attributed to the intervention. A second type is qualitative studies which aim to illuminate the mechanisms through which program participants can access the resources and help offered in the program to achieve better outcomes.  Impact studies  In 2012 a cluster trial experiment demonstrates significant maltreatment recidivism reduction due to implementing the SafeCare model in a fully scaled-up statewide system.Chaffin, M., Hecht, D., Bard, D., Silovsky, J. & Beasley, W. (2012) A state-wide trial of the SafeCare home-based services model with parents in child protective services. Pediatrics Vol. 129 No. 3, 509-515. http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/129/3/509.full.pdf The SafeCare programme has been provided to families in the United Kingdom where a professional has judged there is a risk of experiencing significant harm through neglect. Outcome data shows that on average families who participated in the evaluation of the programme improved parenting skills and reduced neglectful behaviours. Furthermore, all referrers reported see positive changes in the families they referred, particularly in home safety, parent child interaction and health. However, in the absence of a comparison group it was not possible to attribute the changes to SafeCare.  Understanding the mechanisms through which neglect can be stopped  Research on the ways in which parents engage with SafeCare show that the home visitors' tactics for engagement and home visitors' modelling key behaviours are key to influencing individual outcomes. = Engagement = Parents experiences of SafeCare are often influenced by the nature of the relationship they develop with the practitioner who delivers the programme. It helps when practitioners do the work in the family's home, turn up on time, let parents know in advance if they need to cancel, listen to parents concerns and make a genuine effort to get to know family members.Churchill, G. (2015) SafeCare: Parents' Perspectives on a Home Based Parenting Programme for Neglect, London, NSPCC. https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/safecare- parents-perspectives-report.pdf = Modelling behaviour = In certain cases parents have worked with the SafeCare home visitor to improve their parenting in the way described by Social Learning Theory. Social Learning Theory suggests people learn by observing positive desired outcomes resulting from the observed behaviour. Parents reported adopting and doing new games and activities, as a result of having the games and activities by a practitioner. This can lead to children interacting differently with their parents, by joining in with housework. It can lead to parents finding out about their children's interests, which prompts them to do new activities with their child like going to the library. Where parents have had disciplinary techniques successfully modelled, it can lead to parents feeling more confident about taking their children out of the house, and giving them new opportunities like playing in parks. Improved behaviour sometimes can result in better behaviour at school.

They are most commonly used when various different solutions are needed to work with simultaneously, for safety reasons, for safe storage of test tubes, and to ease the transport of multiple tubes. Test tube racks also ease the organization of test tubes and provide support for the test tubes being worked with. Types Test tube racks come in a variety of size, composition, material, and color. The variety of test tube racks increases the number of circumstances they can be used in whether it is to be placed in an autoclave, or to be placed in the refrigerator. The racks are most commonly made of metal wires, but they can also be found as plastic, polystyrene, foam, fiberglass, and polypropylene. Test tube racks come in the form of a classic rack, an interlocking cube form, a stack-able form, test tube drying rack, slant rack, and 1-well rack. Classic Test Tube Rack Classic rack The classic racks are normally found in any regular laboratory and are made of wood, stainless steel, or plastic. It generally has 8 holes, 10 holes, or 12 holes to keep test tubes. Interlocking cube form This form of test tube racks consists of several cubes of racks that are detachable and twist-able based on the side that is needed for use. Each cube can hold one size of test tubes but each of the four sides of the cube holds the tubes in various arrangements that can be adjusted for use accordingly. These racks can not only be used for test tubes, but it can also be used to hold culture tubes, centrifuge tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes. The interlocking cube racks can also be put in the autoclave, as well as ease the transport of multiple different sized tubes. Stackable rack Stackable Test Tube Rack Stackable racks are made of polypropylene and can be placed in the autoclave as well. These racks appear as the classic test tube racks but can be disassembled to ease the storage of both the racks and the test tubes. Test tube drying rack Drying Racks can be used for various purposes, including drying and holding chromatography plates, as well as drying test tubes by placing them in an inverted position in the pegs. Placing the test tubes in an inverted position not only aids in drying, but it also minimizes the accumulation of airborne contaminants and other substances. Additionally, the drying racks are usually made of polypropylene and can be placed in the autoclave. Slant rack Slant racks are used to hold the slants at the degree it is required to be placed in to be dried after the media has been inserted into the tube. It is also used to incubate certain liquid cultures at an angle so that all the tubes are uniform. 1-well rack The 1 well rack is designed to hold only one test tube or any tube that fits in the space. It is normally made of epoxy-coated steel wire but can also be made of polystyrene. The racks made from polystyrene are friction-fit and can only hold tubes that match in size to the rack. These racks are autoclavable and can hold both conical or round bottom tubes. Vial racks Hinge-top vials being filled by pipette on a plastic vial rack. This type of rack is designed for much smaller plastic vials. It is often made out of plastic.

Built as a response to the French Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1929, it was meant to have the same range as the widespread 120 mm gun, but with less muzzle velocity and less dispersion.Bagnasco, p. 35 Description This gun was of loose barrel, jacket and bracket ring, with a horizontal, hand-operated sliding block. The mountings, all with individual cradles for each gun, were either triple (on battleships) or double, with electrical-powered ramming (which, however, was too weak for elevations above 30°, which therefore required hand loading, which rendered the gun unsuitable for anti-aircraft use).Campbell, p. 334-5 The gun fired both AP and HE shells, all weighing 32.7 kg (72.1 lb), at a muzzle velocity of 825 mps (2.707 fps). Service The triple mountings were used on the s as a secondary battery (with each having four turrets); four double mountings each were fitted on the three completed s. Single shielded mounts were used to rearm the Premuda (captured Yugoslav destroyer Dubrovnik) and Spalato (captured Yugoslav destroyer Split) while others were built for the never completed aircraft carrier Aquila and s.

Labeled as a reformist and a separatist he sought for greater recognition of the Jawi community in Patani. His motives for doing so, was in response to General Phibunsongkran's concept of 'Thainess' in which every citizen has to subscribe to the ideology that it is the duty of a Thai to be Buddhist, speak Thai and love the monarchy. This nationalist ideology, prejudiced other ethnic groups in Thailand, like the Jawi community, and deemed the Tai ethnic groups more superior than others. Haji Sulong's request for reforms in education and public administration in southern Thailand were deemed disruptive and viewed as an act of rebellion by the central Buddhist state based in Bangkok. Till today, tensions between the central Buddhist state and the Muslim insurgents have not been quelled, and Haji Sulong's demands still stand firm and synonymous with the various insurgent groups in southern Thailand. Early life=Formative years Haji Sulong was born in 1895 to a family of religious leaders. He attended Pondok Hajji Abdul Rashid in Kampung Sungei Pandang, Patani. At 12, Haji Sulong made the hajj, which was considered a luxury for most at that time. He diligently pursued his religious education, first through informal means at the grand mosque, then through secondary education which qualified him to attain formal education at a university in Egypt. While in Mecca, he had already met with many esteemed Arab religious scholars who were followers of Muhammad Abduh. Haji Sulong was there at a time Islam, too, was undergoing a reform. With the declining power of the Ottomans, Islam needed a regime change and that came with the presence of the Young Turks. Islam had to be more progressive, assimilating and associating with secularism. Two movements broke out of this regime change. The Wahhabiyah’s of the Saud regime pushed for the purity of Islam to be preserved by returning to the practices during the times of the prophet while the Shafi’ite schools helmed by Al-Azhar university in Egypt pushed for more modernist ideals where learning Islam should be seamless with learning secular subjects like science and mathematics. The modernist movement had a profound effect to Haji Sulong and one in which he subscribed to. Return to Patani Upon the death of his wife and son, Haji Sulong was at a crossroad of either continuing life in Mecca or move back to Patani. Haji Sulong had become jaded of his life in Mecca and sought to return to Patani for a short holiday. He had maintained constant contact with his family back in Patani throughout his stay in Mecca. When he decided to move back, his stay was meant to be temporary. He was highly regarded as a scholar in Mecca and had little incentive to uproot himself from the community, but when he came back to Patani, he saw a different Islam, riddled with animistic beliefs and practices. He had a desire to change that by first changing its methods of education. Dissatisfied by the standards of the pondok schools, he began teaching privately by moving around various mosques in the area; similar to his experience of informal education while in Mecca. His initiatives did not please the older generation of religious teachers as they felt he was pushing for the fundamentalistic approach of the Wahabbiyahs but he felt that it was important for him to continue his efforts in order to push for integration with the secular education. Hence, he decided to uproot from Mecca permanently; away from familiarity and security he had built over the years. Career=Beginning of activism One of the key reforms that Haji Sulong pushed for, was the formalization of religious education. Previously, religious education were taught at the pondok schools. These pondok schools had no established curriculum and the lessons there were taught only by the religious teacher that set it up within the various communities. Spurred by the changes that happened in Egypt, he sought to integrate religious education with the secularized subjects like science, mathematics, moral education, etc. The madrasah system received flak from the older generation of religious leaders as it veered away from the halaqah styled system of the past; which was adapted from the informal training the older generation received at masjid al-Haram. The central government was opposed to the madrasah system of education as it hinders the integration of the Jawi community with the majority Thai. The central government wanted the student to admit to the public schools which taught Thai and Buddhism alongside secular subject. The central government preferred the pondok schools as the informal school where students can attain their religious education. However, Ockey contradicts this notion as he mentioned that when Haji Sulong opened his madrasah, he invited Prime Minister Phahon after travelling to Bangkok to request for funds and that the central government would later on provide the necessary support Haji Sulong needed to open his school. Even though the central government did not fully subscribe to the alternative education at the madrasah, they were not overtly in direct opposition to the idea. Haji Sulong gained some grounds in pushing for a formalized religious education in the form of the madrasah system. Through the madrasah system, Haji Sulong was able to expand his influence amongst the Jawi community in Patani. The obstacles he faced while forming the madrasah too, were the key reasons that pushed Haji Sulong towards politics. He was dissatisfied with General Phibun policies of forced assimilation. He wanted some autonomy to be given to the region where Malay would be considered as an official language together with Thai and Islam be taught instead of Buddhist studies. This opposition to the Thai identity was viewed as a form of passive resistance which later became grounds for active rebellion. Haji Sulong became increasingly involved in Thai politics as he felt the need to preserve the identity of the Jawi community amidst the central government push for a Thai identity via forced assimilation. This contradicts Thanet's view of Haji Sulong being an obstinate opposition leader. Both Liow and Ockey have positioned Haji Sulong as a matured leader who understood his intentions well. They highlighted that Haji Sulong turned separatist when negotiations with the central government broke down. Haji Sulong's activism was met with some success. In the wake of the second World War, the uncertain policies of the British forced the Thai government to reconsider the policy of accommodation and integration of 1932. Prime Minister Pridi even considered granting autonomy for South Thailand. One of the policies that was approved was the Patronage of Islam Act, which recognised the role and authority of the religious leaders in South Thailand. Things appeared to have improved. Subsequently, Haji Sulong was elected as the President of the Islamic committee in the Provincial Islamic Council of Patani (PICP) and his friend, Jaroen, became the mayor of Patani. Move to politics Troubled with the central government's involvement in his education reforms, which also led to the shutting down of his school, Haji Sulong started entering into politics. He first, managed to get alliances from the religious leaders to form a Shari’a court informally. As one of the most influential person in Patani, many politicians sought his support in order to get a strong mandate from the Jawi community. However, he showed flexibility and maturity by supporting his friend Jaroen, a Buddhist, instead of Phra Phiphit Pakdi, a Muslim. His loyalty towards his friend together with his belief for integration was more important than his ethnicity as a Jawi Muslim. However, his choice candidate was not elected due to Phra Phiphit Pakdi's cryptic use of a Quranic verse to gain support from the locals while at the same time discredited Haji Sulong. Haji Sulong's first involvement into politics was not a success but improved as time progressed. =Seven-point declaration= As the leader of the Provincial Islamic Council of Patani (PICP), Haji Sulong formulated a seven-point declaration which he felt was important in attaining some autonomy for the public administration in southern Thailand. The seven point declaration is stated below: 1\\\\. That the four southern provinces be governed as a unit, with a Muslim governor. 2\\\\. That for the first seven years of the school curriculum, Malay be allowed as the language of instruction. 3\\\\. That all taxes collected in the four southern provinces be expended there. 4\\\\. That 85 percent of the government officials be local Malays. 5\\\\. That Malay and Thai be used together as the languages of government. 6\\\\. That the provincial Islamic committees have authority over the practice of Islam. 7\\\\. That the Islamic judicial system be separated from the provincial court system. Haji Sulong's objectives were clear. Southern Thailand had to be governed by southern Thais and members of the Jawi community. He felt that by doing so, public administration would improve as residents of the region would understand the needs better. Conflict with the government and Jawi community The central government rejected Haji Sulong's demands in the seven-point declaration as they felt that the existing system was sufficient to rule the region of southern Thailand. His demands also meant that some power over southern Thailand would have to be decentralized to make way for the politicians in the region. The Jawi community, too, did not fully subscribe to Haji Sulong's ideology. They felt that Haji Sulong's demands would disturb the status quo in the region and would further outcast them from the central system of governance. As such, Haji Sulong did not receive a strong mandate for his demands. As a result of the failures of the seven-point declaration, Haji Sulong became more agitated as his reforms draws to a standstill. He became uncompromising and urged the residents in southern Thailand to push for a no-contest in the 1948 elections. He turned towards the separatist movement led by Tengku Muhyiddin and pushed for the independence of southern Thailand. This was seen as an act of rebellion and Haji Sulong subsequently became public enemy in Thailand. Disappearance and legacy Haji Sulong was subsequently arrested for his involvement in stirring up the Jawi community and the actions to push for a no-contest in the region during the 1948 elections. Over the following years, he was pressured to stop his political involvement and told to report to the authorities periodically in order to ensure his obedience. His situation was seen as an insult to the Jawi community and they felt that the central government was insensitive and abusing their authority in the region. In his madrasah, the separatist ideology had managed to infiltrate in the minds of the students and the cause for independence began to grow stronger. It is not known if Haji Sulong still had a large involvement for the growing sentiments. In 1955, Haji Sulong and his eldest son was told to report to the police station along with his close associates. He was then to be transferred and face a trial in court for his involvement in the rebellion. He mysteriously disappeared on his way to the court and till this day, no one had taken responsibility of his disappearance. Over the years till the present day, stories of Haji Sulong and his push for reforms and later on independence, is something that cannot be publicly discussed and the central government is careful in navigating Haji Sulong's contributions to the history of the Muslim insurgency in southern Thailand. They fear that the stories of Haji Sulong's disappearance would rile up sentiments and increase the opposition to the central government's presence in southern Thailand. Today, Haji Sulong has achieved almost a mythical-like status for his reforms and his demands for autonomy or independence still remain relevant.

His criminal conviction arose from his work as a government prosecutor in occupied Luxembourg during the early 1940s. He was pardoned in 1954 and made his way back into the legal service as a regional prosecutor in Frankenthal, Germany. However, in 1965 his Nazi past was raised in the press by a disgruntled party whom Drach had recently prosecuted, and a wider media storm ensued. Matters were raised which generated some painfully intense public soul searching, and Drach's application, at the age of 63, to take early retirement was accepted in 1966. Life=Early years Leonhard Josef Hubert Drach was born and grew up in Aachen. He studied jurisprudence at Cologne and Bonn, qualifying in 1928 and taking a post as a Court Assessor in Aachen. Late in 1931 he moved on, becoming an assistant in the Prosecutor's Office at Trier, where in April 1933 he became a senior administrative assistant specialising in press and political crimes. Context for this appointment is provided by the régime change of January 1933, following which the new government lost little time in creating a one party dictatorship in Germany. It was also during 1933 that Drach joined the Nazi Party, the National Socialist Association of Legal Professionals (NSRB / Nationalsozialistischer Rechtswahrerbund) and the ruling party's paramilitary wing (SA), also becoming a sponsoring member of the SS. In 1934, following the conventional career path implicit in his previous year's promotion, he was appointed a district prosecutor in Trier. Between 1937 and 1940 he was simultaneously also employed by the Gau (regional) Law Office. Luxembourg years War was declared by major belligerents in September 1939 and in May 1940 the German army invaded Luxembourg, which marked the start of more than four years of military occupation for the Grand Duchy. In August 1940 Leonhard Drach was seconded to Luxembourg as a \\"Head of civil administration\\" (\\"Chef der Zivilverwaltung\\"\\"), a role which after 1941 he combined with that of Senior District Prosecutor, based in Koblenz. In Luxembourg his position effectively made him the chief prosecutor at the newly created Special Court, and he worked on numerous criminal cases, frequently and successfully demanding the imposition of a death sentence. He was rewarded with the Cross of Merit (2nd class) for his \\"constructive work\\" (\\"Aufbauarbeit\\") and \\"fact based conduct of political criminal cases\\" (\\"sachliche Erledigung politischer Strafverfahren\\"). On 30 August 1942 a general strike was called in protest against the forcible recruitment of Luxembourg men into the German army. The Germans responded by arresting 20 suspected ringleaders. The suspects were taken before a hastily convened court martial, presided over by a regional Gestapo chief called Fritz Hartmann. Leonhard Drach's job was to prosecute the cases, and he demanded the death sentence for all 20 of the accused. On 14 September 1942 Drach received a note from Hartmann congratulating him for his part in the proceedings. The court had been persuaded.\\"Lieber Parteigenosse Drach! Nachdem Sie leider gestern die anerkennenden Worte des Gauleiters über die Arbeit des Standgerichts und seiner namentlich erwähnten Mitglieder nicht persönlich haben hören können, bitte ich Sie, auf diesem Wege Ihnen nochmals meinen Dank für Ihre selbstlose kameradschaftliche Einsalzbereitschaft und Unterstützung sowie meine besondere Anerkennung für die erfolgreiche Arbeit Im Standgericht ausdrücken zu dürfen ... Ich werde mit Freude und Stolz an die echt kameradschaftliche Zusammenarbeit in dieser denkwürdigen Zeit zurückdenken. Heil Hitler!\\" The men were executed (shot) at the Hinzert concentration camp, a short distance to the east. In September 1944 US troops forced the Germans out of Luxembourg. The German administrative authorities took their files with them, to Trier, where the court clerk was instructed to light a bonfire in the courtyard outside the main court house. The files recording the legal history of Luxembourg under German occupation were thrown onto the flames from the window of his office by Chief Prosecutor Leonhard Drach. Conviction War ended, formally, in May 1945. Drach was interned in 1948/9 and taken back to Luxembourg to face justice. In 1949 he was sentenced to 15 years of forced labour in respect of his activities as prosecutor with the wartime Special Court, and at a further trial before the same court in 1951 he was sentenced to 20 years of forced labour under the terms of war crimes legislation. However, it was determined that the two sentences should be served simultaneously, and should be set at a total duration of only 15 years. Clemency At the end of 1954 the authorities in Luxembourg pardoned and released Leonhard Drach. On his return from Luxembourg, Drach was accepted back into the Rhineland-Palatinate prosecution service. However, he was now working not in Koblenz but in the southern part of the state, based in Frankenthal (to the south of Worms). In 1960 he was promoted to the position of Chief District Prosecutor (\\"Oberstaatsanwalt\\") at Frankenthal. The Nowack affair In December 1961 the Frankenthal District Court handed down a 2,000 Mark fine and a (?suspended) six-month jail sentence to Wilhelm Nowack after finding him guilty of misfeasance in a public office (\\"Untreue im Amt\\"). In October 1958 Dr. Nowack had resigned his office as regional Finance Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate. He was prosecuted for what might today be defined as a form of insider trading. He had reportedly acquired 20 shares in a company called \\"Schnellpressenfabrik Frankenthal AG\\", which was 75% state owned, and of which Nowack, as regional finance minister, was the ex-officio chairman. He had acquired his shares at a price equivalent to 120% of their par value. However, at around the same time the company had itself acquired shares from a private share holder at a price equivalent to 200% of their par value. The conclusion drawn by the prosecutor was that Nowack had acquired his shares for a price equivalent to only 60% of their \\"true\\" value, and that a corresponding loss had been suffered by the company. The total value at which Nowack had acquired his shares was a not insubstantial 216,000 Marks, implying a corresponding loss to the company of 144,000 Marks. It should be stressed that Nowack always maintained that he had done nothing wrong in acquiring shares at a discount to which, as an \\"employee\\" of the company, he was entitled. The state prosecutor in the case was the Frankenthal Chief District Prosecutor, Leonhard Drach. The prosecutor then launched a second criminal case against Nowack, this time for alleged perjury. Nowack now armed himself with more written material from Luxembourg, including information provided by Victor Bodson who had been so critical of Drach at the time of his release from jail in Luxembourg back around Christmas 1954. Armed with supporting documentation, Nowack now wrote an open, and very angry, letter to the Frankfurter Neue Presse (newspaper). \\"That this notorious accomplice of Nazi terrorist-justice launches this prosecution against me is a matter of inestimable shamefulness\\" (\\"Man hat sich nicht entblödet ausgerechnet diesen notorischen Helfershelfer nationalsozialistischer Terrorjustiz zum Ankläger gegen mich zu machen.\\"). That the justice system had \\"reinserted this Leon Drach into the [privileged] circle of judges and prosecutors as though nothing had happened was nothing short of the worst kind of dismissable cavalier conduct (\\"...diesen Leon Drach ... wieder in den Kreis ihrer Richter und Staatsanwälte eingereiht, so als ob nichts oder schlimmstenfalls ein pensionsfähiges 'Kavaliervergehen' vorläge\\"). Nowack concluded that he refused to be prosecuted by a war criminal (\\"Ich lehne es ab, mich von einem Kriegsverbrecher anklagen zu lassen\\"). It is entirely possible that Nowack had already accessed details on Drach's career in Luxembourg long before writing his open letter to the press, since Nowack's defence lawyer, Edmund Dondelinger, had also been convicted in a Luxembourg court in respect of events during the wartime occupation, and had indeed shared his pretrial detention with Drach in the later 1940s. Responding to Nowack, the regional justice minister for Rhineland-Palatinate, Fritz Schneider, shared his opinion, accepting that Drach had been convicted of war crimes, but adding that Drach had only been implementing the law as it existed at the time. Because of this, there could really be no question of reproaching Drach with war crimes, which was why back in 1954 the tribunal reassessing his case in Luxembourg had concluded that Drach had acted in good faith (\\"im guten Glauben an die Rechtmäßigkeit seines Verhaltens\\"). Importantly, that meant that there had been no obvious reason why Drach should not be permitted resume his career as a regional law officer in Rhineland-Palatinate. At Mainz there was more support for Drach in the regional parliament where, in an outburst characterised in Die Zeit as \\"painful\\" (peinlich), the ambitious new chairman of the large centre-right CDU (party) group blustered, \\"if we cannot manage to integrate the \\"Third Reich\\" generation into our democracy, there will never be a vibrant democracy\\" (\\"Wenn es nicht gelingt, die Generation, die einst das Dritte Reich getragen hat, in die Demokratie einzugliedern, wird es nie eine lebendige Demokratie geben\\"). Meanwhile, the (almost equally large) centre left SPD (party) group called for a committee of enquiry to clarify the connections and relationships in the Drach affair, and Dr.Kohl himself appeared to recant from his earlier certainty, suggesting that people such as Drach, who were particularly heavily burdened by their \\"wartime activities\\", should no longer be employed as state prosecutors or judges. The parliament's \\"Legal Affairs Committee\\" was mandated to look into the Drach affair. There was no instant reaction to Schneider's interpretation from the Luxembourg government. However, on 9 January 1965 Luxembourg's Foreign Minister, Pierre Werner, countered that Drach was indeed a convicted war criminal. Schneider's attempt retrospectively to vindicate Drach \\"represented a completely false assessment of the inhuman persecution that had taken over in Luxembourg during the war\\" (\\"...stellt eine völlige Verkennung der unmenschlichen Verfolgungsmaßnahmen dar, die während des Krieges in Luxemburg ergriffen wurden\\"). Victor Bodson, who as Luxembourg's Minister of Justice back in 1954 had signed off on the release, expressed himself more pithily: \\"We chucked the muck over the Moselle\\" (\\"Wir haben den Dreck über die Mosel abgeschoben\\"). The Moselle is the river that divides Luxembourg from Germany. In a subsequent interview Bodson insisted that Drach's release had been purely a matter of clemency, born of human decency. There was nothing that Drach had done to deserve his early pardon. ( \\"[nur aus menschlichen Rücksichten] ... nicht, weil er es verdient hätte\\"). After the entire matter had been publicised, and following the launch of an investigation by regional parliamentary committee, Leonhard Drach's application for early retirement was accepted with effect from 30 April 1966. His name was included in Albert Norden's \\"Brown Book\\" in which the author \\"outed\\" approximately 1,800 members of the West German political and administrative establishment whom he claimed to have identified as former Nazis. As a very old man, when interviewed, Leonhard Drach maintained that he had only acted in accordance with the law (\\"Ich habe nur nach Recht und Gesetz gehandelt\\").

The Anatolian diagonal is a theoretical dividing line which runs diagonally across central and eastern Turkey from the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea to the southeastern corner of the Black Sea, and roughly cuts across part of the course of the upper Euphrates River within Turkey's borders. Biogeographical barrier The diagonal was first proposed by the British botanist Peter Hadland Davis in 1971. He noticed that many species of plant that existed west of the diagonal were not present to the east, while others found to the east were not present to the west. Of 550 species analysed, 135 were \\"eastern\\" and 228 \\"western\\". However, Davis considered that there were no physical, geological or climatic differences or change in soil type that could account for the phenomenon. Not only does the Anatolian diagonal form a barrier to floral biodiversity, but about four hundred species of plant are endemic to this diagonal and are found nowhere else. Gypsum hills south of Sivas In 1989, the Turkish botanists T. Ekim and A. Güner examined the distribution of species by detailed study of the Flora of Turkey, eight volumes of which had been published by then. They came to the conclusion that the diagonal did indeed exist and they found that 33% of the plant species considered were affected by the diagonal in one way or another. They then considered the reasons behind the phenomenon. There was a difference in altitude between the two sides of the diagonal, with the land to the west being lower. Another difference was the climatological regions: to the west there were arid and semi-arid forms of the Mediterranean climate whereas to the east there were semi-arid, sub-humid and humid forms. In the middle portion of the diagonal there was a gypsum feature, but what effect that had on plant distribution was unclear. They concluded that the ecological differences between the two sides of the diagonal were of greater significance than the palaeo-geological history of the area. The Irano-Anatolian region is a significant biodiversity hotspot in the Near East and Anatolia is the transition point between the European and Turko-Iranian floras. Turkey was beyond the southern limit of ice in the last ice age, and Anatolia may be considered to be a potential glacial refugium for species of plants and animals in Europe. In the late Pleistocene, sea levels in this region were lower than they are today by as much as and land bridges intermittently formed across the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. After the end of the most recent ice age, plants surviving to the west of the Anatolian diagonal could spread back into Europe while those to the east could spread into Syria, Iraq and the Near East. The Taurus Mountains provide a cool damp climate for species that cannot survive the hot dry summer climate on either side, and this could have encouraged survival and speciation, resulting in the many endemic species found here today.

Algeria became a full member of Rugby Africa in December 2016. The federation is responsible for the Algerian national team and the Algerian Rugby Championship. It is in charge of promoting the sport in Algeria, organizes international matches for the national team, and is involved in educating and training players and officials. Algeria has never participated in the Rugby World Cup qualifiers. Their best result to date was a 50-0 win against Egypt and Libya, both in a Cairo international tournament in 2010. FAR was accepted as an affiliate member of World Rugby in 2019. History During the French presence in Algeria before 1962, rugby union had its followers either in Oran, Guelma, Algiers or Annaba where clubs like Stade Oranais, RIJA, USMMC, AGVGA or ES Guelma were existent. Rugby had its moments of glory and many Algerian players have been able to achieve successful professional careers abroad, especially in France; but discipline disappeared after the independence of Algeria due to lack of multiple items till 1972 when it disappeared completely. During the beginning of the 2000s, The Algerian Rugby Clubs Committee was established to revive the discipline before creating the federation. On 17 November 2015 the federation was created in Algiers during a constitutive general assembly chaired by Mustapha Larfaoui, honorary president of the Algerian Olympic and Sports Committee and attended by representatives of 18 clubs of 16 wilayas. Sofiane Benhassen was elected first president of the federation. In December 2016, Benhassen reported that they would begin a national ruby championship among 20 rugby union club teams, starting in 2017.

He also played in the Scottish League for Ayr United and Hamilton Academical. Football career McKenzie was born in Benhar, between Harthill and Fauldhouse in West Lothian. He played football for Division One club Ayr United \\"for several seasons\\", but when they were relegated in 1924–25, he chose to move to England. He had scored 17 of Ayr's 43 goals that season, and was described by the Derby Daily Telegraph as \\"quite the best player that club have sent to England since they allowed Johnny Crosbie to go to Birmingham\\". He signed for Darlington in 1925 ahead of their first season in the Football League Second Division. He went straight into the starting eleven for the opening match, at home to Nottingham Forest, and played regularly throughout the season, appearing in 37 league matches out of a possible 42. He also scored regularly, contributing two goals to Darlington's 7–1 defeat of Portsmouth in October and another two in a 3–3 draw with Swansea Town in December. In mid-January, he was switched to centre forward ahead of Darlington's first ever league meeting with Derby County in an attempt to remedy the team's goal drought. He produced two goals in a 3–1 win, went on to lead the line brilliantly when scoring four in a 6–0 defeat of Clapton Orient in February, and attracted attention from First Division clubs. According to the Derby Daily Telegraph, he \\"has the build and weight for the position, and he adds to a nice turn of speed and dash a cleverness in ball distribution which enables him to keep both his wings going.\\" He finished the season with 17 goals from his 39 appearances in all competitions. His performances earned him a transfer to the ambitious Portsmouth club, where the local newspaper, the Evening News, suggested he was chosen because he played in \\"what is now known to be 'the Pompey style': constructive, unselfish, thoughtful, determined, and – when necessary – forceful\\", and \\"should do well in the more congenial surroundings at Fratton Park with real football, rather than the tearaway and haphazard conditions in vogue at Darlington\\". On the opening day of the season, \\"the best goal of the match came when McKenzie, obtaining twenty-five yards out, side-stepped an opponent, and shot, at a tremendous pace, into the corner of the net\\" to complete a 3–1 win against local rivals Southampton. He kept his place for the next three matches, defeats at Manchester City and Oldham Athletic and a home win against Fulham, but the previous season's incumbent, David Watson, returned to the inside-left position for the next match. McKenzie continued to play for Portsmouth's reserve team in the Southern League and London Combination, but those four matches were his last for the first team. McKenzie returned to Scotland and joined Hamilton Academical; he played ten First Division matches in the first half of the 1927–28 season and scored once, a penalty in a 6–3 defeat of Dunfermline Athletic. and NotesReferences Year of birth missing Year of death missing People from West Lothian Scottish footballers Association football inside forwards Ayr United F.C. players Darlington F.C. players Portsmouth F.C. players Hamilton Academical F.C. players Scottish Football League players English Football League players Place of death missing ","title":"Murdoch McKenzie (footballer)"},{"id":"48604672","text":"The Associate (Spanish: El socio) is a 1946 Mexican drama film directed by Roberto Gavaldón and starring Hugo del Carril, Gloria Marín and Nelly Montiel.Pilcher, p. 118 It is based on Jenaro Prieto's 1928 novel The Partner in which a financially struggling man invents a fictitious business partner in order to try to improve his prospects.

On 1 May 1968, two months after the Jabidah Massacre, Datu Udtog Matalam, a former governor of Cotabato, issued a Manifesto for the declaration of the Muslim Independent Movement that sought for an independent Muslim state from the Philippines comprising Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan regions. It was later renamed as the Mindanao Independence Movement (still MIM) to assure non-Muslims in Cotabato that they are included in the envisioned state. Although the MIM was not long-lasting, its impacts were far-reaching as it is argued to be the key factor that led to the formation of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).  Background = Internal colonisation  Mindanao, with its favourable location below the typhoon belt and is rich with mineral resources, naturally attracted foreign capital to the area. This prompted then President Ramon Magsaysay since the mid-1950s and subsequently President Ferdinand Marcos (1966–1986) to systematically resettle its people into Mindanao. This led to the proportion of indigenous peoples in Mindanao to shrink from majority in 1913 to minority by 1976. The best lands in Mindanao were given to settlers and owners of corporate agriculture, while most development investments and government services were offered to the Christian population. This caused the Muslim population to be backward and rank among the poorest in their own country. The resettlement programme was not entirely peaceful as some settlers managed to obtain land from the native Muslims through harassment and other violent efforts which drove the Muslims out of their own lands. The Muslims were alienated by the Philippines government and felt threatened by Christian economic and political domination in their own homeland. This resorted in some Muslim groups to turn to extortion and violence to protect their own land and refrain from being displaced. Such efforts of “integration” had led to the crystallisation of the Moro identity as the Muslims’ identity with the Filipino nation declined rapidly due to the threat in economic and social Muslim life. As an effect of the resettlement, traditional Muslim leaders (also referred as datu) were also voted out during the polls as Christians, who made up a significant majority of the voters, preferred the Christian politicians over them. These local datus suffered a loss in prestige as they could no longer control the Muslim lands. These politicians lost much of the capabilities they had possessed initially to manage the Muslim populace.  Jabidah Massacre  The alleged massacre took place in March 1968 which took the lives of Muslim army recruits and subsequently awakened the Muslim intellectuals to realise the problem besetting the Muslims in Philippines. The occurrence of the Jabidah massacre was timely in that it provided the basis for the call of Muslim solidarity in the Philippines to fight against the government's negligence in the plight of the Muslims. The massacre was regarded to have provided the impetus for the declaration of the MIM which is considered as one of the triggers of the Moro armed struggle in the long-run.  Datu Udtog Matalam  During the 1950s and most of 1960s, prior to the resettlement of the Christians into Cotabato, Datu Udtog Matalam governed Cotabato unchallenged. He was revered as a religious leader and was also an anti-Japanese guerrilla hero during the World War II. He was voted as the Governor of the province for 5 times and had kept Cotabato out of trouble created by others. Leveraging on the dissatisfaction of the Muslims fired by the Jabidah Massacre and their disadvantaged plight under the Marcos government, former governor of Cotabato province, Datu Udtog Matalam, initiated an open movement for secession of the Muslim state through the formation of the MIM. Although some scholars observed that the MIM was formed because Muslim political leaders felt that the government was not doing enough for the Muslims, others have argued that the declaration of the MIM was only political than was it for the betterment of the plight of the Muslims in Philippines. Matalam was betrayed by his own brother-in-law, Congressman Salipada Pendantun, and was forced to retire from office. As a political casualty of the national party politics, he subsequently found himself away from the reins of provincial power which he previously enjoyed and therefore was motivated to regain his power through the declaration of the MIM. Separately, other scholars exposed that it was more personal than political for Matalam to declare the MIM. It was the killing of his son by a National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agent which intensified his resentment of the Philippines government. Despite sending emissaries to Manila seeking justice, the officers involved in the killing were not convicted. Coupled with the dissent of being thrown out of power by the Christian settlers, Matalam felt that the Manila government was turning its back on him which spurred him to retaliate by declaring for an independent Muslim state. Another group of scholars analysed that the declaration of the MIM was a façade by the Muslims leaders to show their concern after failing to improve living standards of the Muslims. Prior to the Jabidah massacre and against the backdrop of economic repression in Mindanao, local datus did not show concern for the plight of the Muslim natives but were more concerned over their own statuses. Underlying such pretext by the Muslim leaders, the formation of the MIM was regarded as an avenue for leaders like Matalam to gain recognition for his leadership which he would otherwise not be able to achieve. His efforts paid off when Marcos appointed him as Presidential Adviser on Muslim Affairs. The outrage of the Muslims due to the Jabidah episode was used by Matalam to gain personal ends.  The movement = Manifesto, constitution and by-Laws and a note to the President  In the first document issued by Matalam on 1 May 1968 which he termed as the Manifesto, he seeks to establish an Islamic state, which would be known as ‘The Republic of Mindanao and Sulu’, that embodies the Islamic ideals and heritage and is therefore independent from the Philippines. The Islamic state shall comprise the southern part of the Philippine Archipelago inhabited by the Muslims namely Cotabato, Davao, Zamboanga and Zamboanga City, Basilan City, Lanao, Sulu, Palawan, and other adjoining areas that are inhabited by Muslims. The MIM states that the 4 million population of Muslims possess their own culture and history which are distinct from the majority Christians in Philippines which makes integration impossible. The manifesto also mentioned that the secession request was decided on as a response to “the systematic extermination of the Muslim youth - like the Corregidor Fiasco” (the Jabidah massacre) and “the policy of isolation and dispersal of the Muslim communities” that have been pursued vigorously much to the detriment of the Muslim community. In the addendums and subsequent documents issued from 8 June 1968 to 26 July 1968, Matalam, as the principal signatory of all these documents, further clarified that the organisation is to be known as the Muslim Independence Movement and be referred to as MIM. Membership for the movement is only open to able-bodied Muslims within the Philippines and application can be done through the secretariat. In one of the documents, Matalam added that Muslims would need its own defined territory to abide by their own shariah (Muslim laws) and adat (practices). He added that the Muslims are ready to self-govern with sufficient trained men in all fields. Matalam regarded the MIM as the “concerted voice, organised solely as an instrument for the realisation of their (the Muslims’) cherished dreams and aspirations.”Documents issued by the MIM can be found in the appendixes of Glang's Secession or Integration? (1969)  Amended policy  On 26 August 1968, Matalam issued a Declaration of Policy stating that the independent Islamic state shall “extend and guarantee full and equal citizenship and fair representation in all its institutions, provisional or permanent, on all non- Muslims inhabitants of the said islands who make known their desires to secede from the Republic of the Philippines and join the new Islamic state”. Within three months of the issuance of the manifesto, Matalam had changed the policy to provide equal rights to Christian inhabitants and subsequently, further mellowed his demand and only sought for a statehood under a federal system. He changed the name of the MIM to Mindanao Independence Movement in an effort to reassure Christian settlers that they are not excluded from the movement and would be accorded equal rights as the Muslims.  End of movement  Just after 5 months of declaring the MIM Manifesto and demanding for an independent state from the Philippines, Matalam went on the flipside. On 11 October 1968, he met President Ferdinand Marcos who appointed Matalam as his adviser on Muslim Affairs. In a statement issued by the MIM Secretariat Matalam reasoned that he “accepted the position as a gesture of sportsmanship on his part as the leader of the more than four million Muslims in the Philippines”. This suggests that the Jabidah Massacre was less an impetus as compared to his own personal drivers to declare the formation of the MIM. Albeit riding on the wave of Muslim dissent against the government, the MIM failed to garner support of the Muslim masses. The Muslims did not see how the MIM could be a tool to help them achieve betterment of their lives considering that the leaders of the movement were the exact leaders who did not care for their plight prior the Jabidah Massacre. According to the statistics of a census, Alpha Report, conducted by the Manila-based Filipinas Foundation, the results of the survey showed that more than half interviewed opposed the secession idea and about another quarter were uncommitted which effectively meant that the MIM only had the support of a quarter of the some 4 million Muslims in the region. The MIM never managed to become a popular movement as it was limited to only publications of documents and communiques that were released by the press. The MIM was disintegrated in 1972 with the surrender of Matalam in December with many of its members consequentially and subsequently rallying the MNLF.  Impact = Increase in armed conflicts  The declaration of the MIM provided opportunity for the blossom of armed gangs who received political respectability in their fight towards an independent Islamic state. The MIM also provoked thoughts of self-discovery amongst the Muslims to oppose the ruling government and this provocation has led to subsequent violent encounters. In March 1970, a gun battle in Upi, Cotabato, exposed the existence of Ilagas (rats) who were trained and systematic in attacking Muslims and were backed by Christian mayors to ensure that political power is kept by Christians in the wake of the upcoming 1971 elections. Other scholars have argued that the anti-Moro Ilaga Movement was actually in response to the declaration of the MIM as the Christians were “frightened”. In response to the attacks by the Ilagas, the Blackshirts and Barracudas (the private army of Ali Dimaporo, a Muslim congressman of the Nationalista party) were formed and trained to engage in gang warfare against the Ilagas. The Blackshirts were claimed to be financially backed by Matalam to mobilise fighting squads to launch attacks against Christians but this claim cannot be proven. During this period, one notable incident would be the Manili massacre in June 1971 which claimed the lives of Muslims in a mosque in Manili when unarmed Muslims were shot by government officials and Christian civilians. Significantly, the MIM produced a boom of gunmen who may not be politically driven but rather content with only robbery and plundering.  International pressure  Matalam went to Kuala Lumpur in April 1969 to meet the delegations of the Conference of Muslim States to appeal for assistance to support his cause but it was Rascid Lucman of the MIM who provided the critical link to external sponsors such as Malaysia where Tun Mustapha, then Chief Minister of Sabah, and then Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak who were angered by Operation Merdeka sponsored the training of 90 Muslim youths in Pulau Pangkor in 1969. Nur Misuari, one of the prominent people of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), had met with Matalam and Salipada Pendantun to organise the training camp on the island of Pangkor. After the Manili massacre, Libya responded by placing the matter before the UN Subcommittee for Human Rights in August 1971. President Muammar Gaddafi accused the Manila government for genocide and persecution of Muslim minorities in Philippines and was determined to provide material aid to the Muslims in Philippines, and this was also supported by other Arab countries. The sectarian violence between the Ilagas and Barracudas had turned into a religious conflict as Muslim governments (Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and Libya) promised to send aid to the Muslims in Philippines. The pressures from the Muslim countries was argued to have influenced Marcos to declare Martial Law to retrieve unauthorised weapons and ban all political organisations to control the Muslims in the south.  Continuation of the Moro armed struggle  The MIM was argued to be the precursor of the MNLF. In response to the sectarian violence, Nur Misuari convened a conference to discuss the situation of the Muslims in south. This conference was attended by the trainees of the camp on Pangkor Island and also members of the youth wing of the MIM. The most important and significant result of this conference was the official formation of the MNLF. As the MIM was “abandoned” by its leaders who were offered high positions in the government, young passionate followers such as Nur Misuari saw that they had to continue the battle and went on to form the MNLF. Based on an interview with a Bangsa Moro Commander conducted by Frank Gould, the MNLF reportedly arose as an underground movement in the youth section of the MIM. These young followers also saw the MIM as being small and effective therefore created a more radical MNLF which had longer-lasting and more significant effects in Philippines till today.

It could be adapted to commercial or military rôles. Design and development As the full company name (Rohrbach Metall- Flugzeugbau) makes clear, all Rohrbach aircraft were all-metal, including their duralumin skinning. The Robbe was a monoplane with a high wing described at the time as a semi-cantilever structure, meaning that there were no rigid wing struts but that it retained external bracing with flying wires to the wings from the lower fuselage. The wings were mounted with 5° of dihedral. In plan they were straight tapered, with unswept leading edges and blunt tips. Internally the wings were built around single box spars, assisted by leading edge and trailing edge boxes. The edge boxes also served as fuel tanks. At this time there were still doubts about the repairability of metal aircraft, so the Robbe's two-part wing was designed to be easy to inspect internally by the removal of the edge boxes and all parts were replaceable. The wing skin was riveted to the ribs. The hull was flat-sided and deep. Its underside had two steps; in front of the first the hull bottom was a hollow V in section and behind it a flat V. There was a little water rudder behind the rear step. Pilot and mechanic sat side by side in an open cockpit, with gunner's positions ahead of them and at the trailing edge. Alternatively, the Robbe could be configured to carry four passengers, one in a forward cabin, two in a central one and one more im a rear cabin, or to carry goods or post. The hull was divided into seven watertight compartments to preserve buoyancy. An unusual feature of each gunner's cockpit was a duralumin, telescopic mast. If, in an emergency the Robbe alighted without power, these could each be extended and a simple, triangular sail raised to reach safety. At the rear the tail was conventional, with a blunted rectangular fin and small unbalanced rudder. The high aspect ratio horizontal tail, again rectangular apart from blunted tips, was mounted well up the fin and strut-braced to the upper fuselage. Like the rudder, the elevators were unbalanced. To keep them clear of the spray of take-off, each of the Robbe's two BMW IV water-cooled six cylinder upright inline engines was mounted in pusher configuration high above the wings on vertical faired steel tube N-form struts, the forward inner one particularly sturdy, and with transverse V-strut bracing with its apex on the central, upper fuselage. The engines were cooled with radiators in the front of the engine cowling and behind shutters controlled from the cockpit. There was a reserve fuel tank above each engine. The Robbe had upward tilted, stabilizing, chined floats at about one third span, each mounted on N-form struts and transversely braced with converging struts to the wing below the engine mountings. Each float was divided into three watertight compartments. Operational history The first flight of the Robbe I, as the model described above became known, was in 1925. By the following summer two had been built and were taking part in a seaplane contest on the Warnemünde, though they did not complete it. In August 1926 the Robbe set at least four world speed records for aircraft carrying loads of over distances of ; two of these remained unbroken well into 1927. Robbe II Rorhbach built a third Ro VII, the Robbe II. Though the layout was the same as the Robbe I and some elements were common to both, the Robbe II was considerably larger and more powerful. It had a new, strongly straight tapered, wing with sweep only on the leading edge and a span of . It was long and had a loaded weight of in nine- seat passenger configuration. Pilot and mechanic had a low glazed enclosed cockpit ahead of the wing leading edge. Since the Robbe II was about 50% heavier than the earlier version it required more power. Construction began with the intention of fitting a pair of BMW V water-cooled six-cylinder inline engines but when completed it had a pair of BMW VI V-12s, each developing . It flew for the first time in the last quarter of 1927 in passenger configuration, with four porthole style windows in the cabin walls. Two military versions were proposed, a marine reconnaissance and anti-submarine aircraft and a conventional and torpedo bomber, both with three crew and machine guns or cannon; the loaded weight of the bomber was . The Robbe II had a maximum speed of and alighted at . Its range was about 17% lower and ceiling 5% lower than those of the earlier version.

The band is currently composed of Chad Ubovich, Kevin Boog and Dylan Fujioka. Chad Ubovich also plays bass with Fuzz and was previously a member of Mikal Cronin's backing band. Biography=Early history Chad Ubovich was raised in Monrovia, California, which he described as: \\"kind of [an] old, abandoned part of Los Angeles. There’s a racetrack there that Charles Bukowski would go to.\\" While attending high school, Ubovich began working on his own music, stating: \\"I was very into a lot of noise music and a lot of stuff I was making was pretty much tape-art. It was like I would buy a lot of weird tape machines and try splicing together things and all that kind of weird stuff.\\" Ubovich formed a band, named Thief, with his high school friend, Cory Hanson. Describing the band as a \\"pretty boy band,\\" Ubovich noted, \\"It's so ridiculous to think that we were, like, trying to be Radiohead.\\" During this time, he befriended Ty Segall, and Mikal Cronin as the latter attended college. After performing on the same bill as Segall's then- band The Epsilons, Ubovich noted: \\"I went home and looked them up on MySpace, back when that was the thing you did to find out about bands. I said to my band, 'Dudes! They're guitar, keyboards, drums... and they’re way better than us! Fuck!\\" Ubovich lost touch with Segall, but the two later reconnected following the release of Segall's album, Lemons (2009). In 2010, Cronin asked Ubovich to join his backing band. Occupying the role of bass guitarist, the band went on tour with Ty Segall as he toured his studio album, Goodbye Bread (2011). Ubovich soon switched to guitar within the band. Meatbodies (2013-present) While touring with Cronin, Ubovich formed his own band, Chad and the Meatbodies. Featuring his friend and former Thief bandmate Cory Hanson, the band also featured drummer Erik Jimenez and Riley Youngdahl. In 2013, Chad and the Meatbodies supported Ty Segall and Charles Moothart's hard rock band Fuzz. Segall subsequently encouraged Ubovich to record his music and offered to release it on his label, God? Records. The resultant self-titled cassette, Chad and the Meatbodies, sold out its initial run. The band changed their name simply to Meatbodies, and entered the studio with producer Eric Bauer to record the band's debut studio album, Meatbodies. The album was released in 2014. The band have also released a string of 7\\" vinyl singles. Fuzz Ubovich went on to join Segall and Moothart in Fuzz as its bass guitarist and vocalist, following the departure of Roland Cosio. Joining Segall and Moothart in the writing process for Fuzz's second studio album, Ubovich noted: \\"We all kind of did something we’ve never done before, which was write together as a band. That was a first for all of us. Usually in our respective projects it’s all about writing on our own, and that process. This time we tried something definitely new.\\" The resultant album, II, was released in October 2015 on In the Red Records.

Nowadays the property is under the protection of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). The palace is one of the rich architectural and cultural heritage of India. This palace was built for a purpose of permanent residential abode for the Gajapati Rulers of Paralakhemundi belonging to the Ganga Dynasty. History The palace was built by Maharaja Krushna Chandra Gajapati, the Gajapati ruler of that time. It is believed that the Paralakhemundi ruler started building the palace to enhance the beauty of the state. The concept of building the sight was finalized on 20 May 1835. As regards its historical importance, the seeds of a separate statehood for the Odia-speaking people were germinated in the Gajapati Palace precincts. Architecture The palace is known for its rich culture among the world heritages. British Architect, Robert Fellows Chisholm was responsible for design and construction of this royal fort. The fort is influenced by IndoSaracenic style combined with Byzantine and European architectural features. This palace is a 3-storey structure which has a secret hall and a subversive passageway that links to the chief citadel of the Maharaja. The palace includes an underground floor connecting it with the main palace of the Maharaja. It is believed that this secret passage was used by the royal family to hide during attacks from enemies. One can easily notice eye-catching works of art on the walls of the fort (Brundaban palace). A stunning wood let is also situated close to Brundaban Palace. While entering into the Singhadwar (the main gate) two reclining lions statues are seen on both sides over two raised platforms. A huge eye caching decorative iron gate stands anchored in between two round shaped tall minarets known as Gombuja (ଗମ୍ବୁଜ).A large mounted metal bell is situated at the main entrance, to be struck manually by a heavy wooden mallet for indicating accurate hourly time to the Palace and the general public of the town. The gilt decorated walls and intricate wooden trellis-worked Durbar Hall is the main attraction of the palace. It is an excellent piece of art to experience. Durbar Hall is located in the middle of the pPalace and consists of Raja Mahal and Rani Mahal (the two main wings of the palace). The construction is so symmetrical that if one stands on the centre line of the place and makes comparison of both the wings, it is found that one half appears to be exactly the mirror image of the other half. One other must visit place in the fort is the Gantaghar (strong-room). It is simultaneously used as an armoury room.

He represented the United States in the men's 3000-meter steeplechase at the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics, qualifying for the final both times. Biography Glen Dawson was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma on August 1, 1906. He grew up in Skiatook, Oklahoma, and took up running in grade school. In 1927, his senior year in high school, he set a state high school record in the mile run and won one of the two mile races at the national interscholastic meet in Chicago. Subsequently, Dawson attended the Central State Teachers College and from 1929 the University of Oklahoma. Dawson competed in the 10,000 meters at the 1928 United States Olympic Trials, but did not qualify for the Olympic team. Coached by John Jacobs, Dawson had a successful collegiate career with the Oklahoma Sooners, winning the Big Six mile championship both indoors and outdoors in 1930 and again in 1931; at the 1931 outdoor meet he also won the two miles. He placed third in the mile at the 1931 NCAA championships. In 1932, his last year in college, he took up the 3000 meter steeplechase and attempted to qualify for the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles in that event. Dawson lost to Harold Manning at the Midwestern Tryouts in Evanston; before the final Trials he was not favored to make the American team. At the final Olympic Trials in Stanford Dawson placed third in 9:18.4 and earned the last spot on the American steeplechase squad; the winner, Joe McCluskey, set a new world best of 9:14.5. In Los Angeles, Dawson was drawn in the same heat as McCluskey and eventual Olympic champion Volmari Iso-Hollo. He qualified for the final by placing third in 9:15.0, a time that would remain his lifetime best. The Olympic final turned into a 3460-meter steeplechase due to a lap counter's error; Dawson placed sixth in 10:58.0. In 1933 Dawson won the national (AAU) indoor championship in the 1000 meters and defeated Glenn Cunningham in an indoor mile race in Tulsa. He was seen as a potential challenger to Cunningham as America's leading miler, but in later races Cunningham proved stronger. Dawson won the AAU 1000-meter title again in 1935, and placed fourth (behind Cunningham, Gene Venzke and Archie San Romani) in the 1500 meters outdoors that year. In the Olympic year 1936 Dawson again turned to the steeplechase; he placed second behind Manning at the AAU championships, his best result in the national outdoor meet. The Olympic Trials were held separately in New York City the following week; Dawson placed third behind Manning and McCluskey in 9:23.2, qualifying for his second consecutive Olympic Games. At the Olympics in Berlin he was fourth in his heat, defeating 1932 silver medalist Tom Evenson in a fight for the last spot in the final; in the final he placed eighth in 9:21.1. Dawson retired from running in 1937 to start a business career. He died in Tulsa on January 19, 1968, after a long illness.

John Warburton (30 April 1919 - 26 August 2004) was an English fascist and press photographer. He was an assistant district leader for the Clapham branch of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) before the Second World War, and afterwards was a key member of the Union Movement, the founder editor of Comrade, and the senior Council member of Friends of Oswald Mosley. Early life John Warburton was born in Bury, Lancashire, on 30 April 1919, the son of a blacksmith who died when John was 13. His mother's maiden name was Christian. He had a brother, Edmund (\\"Ned\\"). John was educated at St George's Church of England School at Unsworth, Lancashire. The brothers became interested in Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists (BUF) after attending a public meeting at Belle Vue, Manchester. They both joined the British Union Cadets, enjoying the camaraderie and sense of purpose that they found there. John had at first been attracted to Communism but was deterred by its lack of patriotism. At 14, he started work as a clerk at Manchester Dyers. Both brothers were present at the Battle of Stockton, a violent clash between the BUF and a larger number of communists and Labour supporters during which Ned received an injury that cost him an eye after potatoes were thrown with razor blades embedded in them. Some time later, John contracted scarlet and rheumatoid fever and spent five months in hospital. His mother was advised to take him south for the warmer weather and the family settled in Clapham, London, in the Autumn of 1936. John found an office job with a firm of dried fruit importers in Camberwell.\\"John Warburton Fleet Street photographer who acted as a bouncer for the British Union of Fascists\\", The Daily Telegraph, 2 September 2004, p. 29.

Warburton first saw Oswald Mosley at a rally on Clapham Common: \\"He was striding along, and to me he was a god. As I matured and grew older, I realised he wasn't a god. But he was the nearest approach to it I'd ever met.\\" Warburton and his brother were at the Battle of Cable Street on 4 October 1936 and at Mosley's Limehouse meeting 10 days later. It was at that meeting that Warburton began to record events with his camera, leading to a long career as a press photographer. He became assistant district leader for the Clapham branch of the BUF and was also a member of the Battersea branch. He acted as a steward at BUF rallies, ejecting hecklers, sometimes forcibly, and once had to rescue Unity Mitford after she became part of a left-wing \\"Save Spain\\" rally in Hyde Park while wearing a swastika badge. Second World War Warburton missed the massive Earl's Court rally of the BUF on 16 July 1939, he had volunteered for the British Army and been told to report to the Queen's West Surrey Regiment the day before. Probably as a consequence of his army service, he was not detained under Defence Regulation 18B during the Second World War as many other fascists were, although his home was searched by police officers from Special Branch and his political papers seized. He was discharged from the army on medical grounds after 18 months and return to civilian life as an agency press photographer. In 1942, Warburton married Joan C. Thorpe (died 1997) in Battersea. Joan had been a member of Mosley's New Party, the predecessor to the BUF in the 1930s. Post-war After the end of the Second World War, Warburton worked for the London afternoon papers, the Evening Standard, the Evening News and the Star, and later for the Sport and General agency. He continued to be highly active in fascist circles and was a founding member of the Union Movement in 1948. In the 1970s, he worked with Bernard Levin of The Times, to fight an attempted left-wing takeover of the National Union of Journalists.

India has a well- established pharmaceutical industry in Azerbaijan and many Indian pharmaceutical companies operate out of Azerbaijan. Some items of direct and indirect imports from India include clothes and textiles, information technologies, food items and heavy machinery, electronic cards, steam boilers and other plant equipment. The volume of trade has increased from 50 million dollars (2005) to 250 million (2015). India’s main import from Azerbaijan is crude oil.

It is set in the 16th century during the Eighty Years' War and features the adventures of Gilles, a brave but not always too bright resistance fighter who is part of the Geuzen, an army who fight the Spanish oppressor in the Netherlands. The series has been compared to Asterix for being a humoristic comics series set in a historical time period, containing a lot of satirical winks and references. The series has been translated into English as \\"Bryant the Brigand\\" and was published by Alibris. It has also been translated into Spanish as Tristán el salteador. Concept \\"Gilles de Geus\\" was pre-published in the Dutch comics magazine Eppo and later in Sjors en Sjimmie Stripblad. Originally it was a gag-a-day comic, drawn by Hanco Kolk and written by Wilbert Plijnaar, with stories that lasted only a few pages and were mostly about Gilles' failed attempts at robbing stagecoaches and his confrontations with incompetent Spanish militaries. When Peter de Wit collaborated on the scripts the stories took a new direction and became full-length adventure stories. Gilles became a resistance leader within de Geuzen and serving under William the Silent to combat the Spanish oppressor. He also became more heroic, with the comic relief being subjugated to his monosyllabic friend Leo and the vain and arrogant Admiral Lumeij. Despite directly referencing historic events during the Eighty Years' War and appearances of real-life historical characters such as Admiral Lumeij, William the Silent, Cornelis Drebbel, Desiderius Erasmus, Maarten Tromp, Michiel de Ruyter, Rembrandt Van Rijn and the Duke of Alba the tone is predominantly humoristic and takes some license with anachronisms as a result. In 1986 Peter Visser and Carol van Dijk recorded a song about \\"Gilles de Geus\\" for a fan club of the series. Visser and Van Dijk would later become famous as the rock band Bettie Serveert. The series was terminated in 2003, but in 2014 the makers made an attempt to relaunch it through crowdfunding. Characters * Gilles: A highwayman who is so incompetent that the prices on the \\"wanted\\" posters for his capture keep going down. He is later accidentally hired as a resistance leader in the army of William the Silent. * Leo: A strong red bearded sailor who is Gilles' best friend, even though he doesn't say much besides the word \\"Hee...\\" (\\"Hey...\\") * Admiral Lumeij: Based on the real-life admiral, Lumeij is a tiny, self-absorbed man who always thinks he is the best, but is basically an idiot. He is so vain that he doesn't realize that he lacks talent and frequently takes credit for everything Gilles did for him. * William the Silent: Based on the real-life Dutch national hero. He often sends Gilles, Leo and Lumeij out on secret missions. * Cornelis Drebbel: Based on the real-life scientist, but depicted more as a mad scientist in the series. * Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba: Based on the real-life Spanish duke. He acts as the series' antagonist. * Hertog Jan van Breda: A charming skirt chaser who is part of the nobility that surrounds William the Silent. * De Bekketrekker (\\"The Facemaker\\"): A sadistic gang leader who works for the Spaniards, despite not being affiliated with them. * 90-60-90: A female double spy in both the Spanish as well as the Dutch camps. She seduces every man she meets, save for Gilles who can resist her.

It was his final project before he died. Setting De Geuzen is set in Flanders in the 16th century and follows the adventures of Hannes, a young brave man, and his friends Nele and Tamme, who fight the Spanish oppressors on the side of the Geuzen. Similar in theme to the thirty years older Tijl Uilenspiegel, the comic combined many of Vandersteen's passions, including the art of Pieter Brueghel the Elder http://users.telenet.be/geuzen/auteur.html and the novel The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak by Charles de Coster. The characters are very similar to the protagonists of De Coster's novel. At the end of every album a graphic drawing of Breughel was reproduced, most of his Seven Sins and Seven Virtues series. Vandersteen originally made a synopsis for the series in 1972, but apart from ten preliminary sketches the concept didn't go anywhere. Instead he drew the series \\"Robert en Bertrand\\". In 1985 he passed this series on to his assistants and finally made work of \\"De Geuzen\\".http://users.telenet.be/geuzen/auteur.html Originally the tone was more comedic, including anachronistic jokes and references, such as the villains Johan Rattenbol, \\"aka J.R.\\" and Alexis Kollebie. From the third album on the stories and artwork became more realistic and serious. Overall the series was also notably more adult in its subject matter, compared to Vandersteen's older family friendly series. The comics were not prepublished and were mostly created by Vandersteen alone,https://www.lambiek.net/artists/v/vandersteen.htm though he did receive some minor assistance of Eric de Rop, Eugeen Goossens and Rita Bernaers. The lack of deadlines ensured the quality but also decreased the publication rhythm. Only ten albums were published and Vandersteen made it clear in his testament that nobody else was allowed to continue the series after his death.Van Hooydonck, Peter, Willy Vandersteen: de Bruegel van het Beeldverhaal: Een Biografie, Standaard Uitgeverij, p. 273-275http://users.telenet.be/geuzen/auteur.html Characters http://users.telenet.be/geuzen/personages.html * Hannes: A young, strong, handsome and brave troubadour. He is very similar to Till Eulenspiegel. * Veerle: A farmer's daughter who is Hannes' girlfriend. She is similar to Nele, Till Eulenspiegel's girlfriend in The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak. * Carolus and Boelkin: Veerle's parents, who are both farmers. They are obviously inspired by Claes and Soetkin, the parents of Thyl Eulenspiegel in The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak. * Tamme: A servant of Carolus and friend of Hannes who adores eating and drinking. He is obviously inspired by Lamme Goedzak. * Witte Weerlicht: Veerle's white horse. * Dostranamus: A bearded alchemist and magician, whose name is a pun on Nostradamus. * Alwina: Dostranamus' female servant. * Maldor: A hermit, alchemist and scientist.

R. Ambedkar, Chairman of the Drafting Committee Constitution Day (National Law Day), also known as Samvidhan Divas, is celebrated in India on 26 November every year to commemorate the adoption of the Constitution of India. On 26 November 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted the Constitution of India, and it came into effect on 26 January 1950. The Government of India declared 26 November as Constitution Day on 19 November 2015 by a gazette notification. The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi made the declaration on 11 October 2015 while laying the foundation stone of the B. R. Ambedkar's Statue of Equality memorial in Mumbai. The year of 2015 was the 125th birth anniversary of Ambedkar, who had chaired the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly and played a pivotal role in the drafting of the constitution. Previously this day was celebrated as Law Day. 26 November was chosen to spread the importance of the constitution and to spread thoughts and ideas of Ambedkar. Background Since 2015 was the 125th birth anniversary year of B. R. Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956), who is known as the drafter of the Indian constitution, the government decided in May 2015 to celebrate this year \\"in a big way\\". A special committee chaired by Prime Minister of India was announced for year-long celebrations. Various programmes will be held by various ministries and departments throughout the year to spread thoughts and ideas of Ambedkar. As part of the celebrations while laying foundation stone for an Ambedkar memorial at the Indu Mills compounds in Mumbai in October 2015, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi announced that 26 November will be celebrated as \\"Constitution Day\\". In November 2015, the government officially announced celebration of the day. Celebrations Constitution Day is not a public holiday. Various departments of the Government of India celebrated the first Constitution day. As per the Department of Education and Literacy, the preamble of the constitution was read in all schools by all students. In addition, there were quiz and essay competitions both online and offline on the subject of the constitution of India. There was a lecture on salient features of the constitution in each school. The Department of Higher Education requested various universities to arrange mock parliamentary debates in colleges, and the University Grants Commission (UGC) arranged an all-India quiz competition at Ambedkar University, Lucknow, where quiz winners of all states participated. The Ministry of External Affairs directed all overseas Indian schools to celebrate 26 November as Constitution Day and directed embassies to translate the constitution into the local language of that nation and distribute it to various academies, libraries and faculties of Indology. The work of translating the Indian constitution into Arabic has been completed. Department of Sport arranged symbolic run named \\"Run for Equality\\". There was also a special session of Indian parliament on 26 November 2015 to give tribute to the constitution and Ambedkar. The Parliament House complex was also illuminated on this occasion. Students of Andhra University participated in the 'Run for Ambedkar' rally to mark the occasion of the 70th Constitution Day, on Beach Road in Visakhapatnam on 27 November 2019.

It was built as a country retreat in the late 16th century. The tower and its gardens have been restored, and now serve as a family retreat. It is officially named as Bubaqra Palace (Maltese: Palazz Bubaqra) and it is a grade 2 national monument. History Bubaqra Tower was built in around 1579 by Don Matteolo Pisani, a Conventual Chaplain of the Order of St. John. Fr. Luret Zammit confirms that it was built by Fr. Mattew (Matteolo) Pisani. Zammit says that it was eventually named Torre del Greco for a Greek family, the Roncali family, who lived there. Although the structure was fortified, it was privately owned and was not meant for defensive purposes. Despite this, at some point it was probably used in Malta's defence system, as was done in other cases such as Gauci and Mamo Towers. The structure was modified in the 18th century, during the rule of Grand Master Marc'Antonio Zondadari and around 1760, when four turrets were also added giving it a fortified residence appearance from the distance. It was reportedly used as an illicit meeting place between members of the Order, who were bound by vows of celibacy, and young females. During this period, it was common for the knights, priests and bishops to have mistresses, illegitimate children, or both; notably, the parish priest of the village of Żurrieq himself was known to organise meetings against payment between young mistresses and their knightly suitors in the whereabouts of the tower. The tower was requisitioned by the British military during World War II between 1939 and 1945, but was returned to its owners after the war. Thereafter, Bubaqra Tower and its gardens were restored, and the place was turned into a family retreat. The tower is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. The building is officially known as Palazzo Bubaqra by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) and is scheduled as a grade 2 property. Architecture Bubaqra Tower is situated in an agricultural estate, in Bubaqra where it is surrounded by citrus gardens. It is square in shape, and has four distinctive corner turrets. Its architecture probably influenced the design of the Gourgion Tower, which was built in the late 17th century on Gozo. Above the main entrance of the building is an inscription that calls upon God to give relief from the enemy at the recitation of the sign of the cross.

Created and joined by women of wealth, it was a conduit through which the energies of upper-class women could be channeled into political activism conducted within a socially comfortable milieu. The New York branch of the Society, for example, often held suffrage rallies at which members spoke in the street outside the Colony Club, to which many of them belonged. After the public rally, Club members would eat luncheon inside their Club. The EFS also invited anti-suffragists to meet with them for the purposes of debate.  History  Katherine Duer Mackay founded the Equal Franchise Society (EFS) in New York City in 1908 and also served as its president. The first meeting was held at her house on December 21, where the Constitution for the group was adopted and officers were elected. Mackey later leased offices for the group's meetings in the Madison Square Building. Mackay had a vision of the EFS uniting woman's suffrage groups into a \\"single body.\\" Her vision of EFS also included the equality of men and women both in civic and political sectors and a prohibition against militant tactics. She also hoped that both wealthy and working-class women could work together towards suffrage through the EFS. The EFS decided in 1909 to push for the right to vote in the city of New York first, before they fought for the right to vote across the country. Mackay quit as the president of EFS in 1911, stating that she did not have enough time to devote to the project. The Nevada chapter of the EFS was formed by Jeanne Wier in 1910.

It was an adaptation of a stage play of the same name by Jamaican-born Barry Reckord and was directed by Claude Whatham. The plot involves Dave, a young, intellectual, middle class Jamaican man (played by Lloyd Reckord; the writer's brother), who becomes involved with Terry, a white, working class woman (Elizabeth MacLennan) while living with his aunt in the Brixton district of London, en route to studying at Cambridge University. A post-coital scene, showing the characters getting out of bed and getting dressed, was also featured. Unseen for over 50 years, a recording of the broadcast was rediscovered in the British Film Institute's archive in 2015.  Other kisses  The screening predated a better known interracial kiss on British television, on Emergency Ward 10 in 1964, and the first US interracial television kiss, on Star Trek in 1968, each of which feature black women and white men.  Stage version  \\"You in Your Small Corner\\" was Reckford's second play and had been performed at the Royal Court Theatre, then transferred to the New Arts Theatre. It was based in part on the author's own experiences as a Cambridge undergraduate in the 1950s. It was omitted from the 2010 book For the Reckord: A Collection of Three Plays by Barry Reckord, as a copy of the script could not be found in time for its publication. The title of the play is the penultimate line of each verse of the 1868 children's hymn, Jesus Bids Us Shine by Susan Bogert Warner. The play should not be confused with works of the same title, by Eileen Corderoy (1968) or John Naismith (1987).

Built in 1828, it is a well- preserved example of a transitional Federal-Gothic Revival church building, converted to government use in 1875. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Dover Town Hall is set near the eastern end of Dover's town common, just southeast of the town's public library. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. A tower projects slightly from the front (south-facing) facade, with a three-level first stage topped by a louvered belfry and a crenellated and pinnacled top. Windows are rectangular sash, and are topped by blind lancet-arched louvers, as are the belfry openings. The main entrance is in the base of the tower, flanked by pilasters and topped by a simple corniced entablature. A single-story kitchen wing extends to the rear of the building. The building was erected in 1828 to serve as a union meeting house for Baptist, Methodist, and Universalist congregations. It is unusual as an early manifestation of the Gothic Revival style, its construction details unsupported by extant documentation, but supported by a close examination of the construction methods used to build some of its Gothic features. It was not uncommon for buildings constructed earlier to later have Gothic details (in this instance, the lancet-arched features) applied, but that does not appear to be the case with this building. The second stage of the tower appears to be a later 19th-century modification. The building was used by the Baptists and Methodists until the 1850s, and by Congregationalists between 1872 and 1883. In 1872 the town voted to hold its town meetings here, a role the building played until 1971. There were calls to demolish the aging building in 1907, but it was instead repaired and formally taken over by the town. Today the town hall does not facilitate normal town or local business, rather, a clerks office is maintained in the town in another more modern building See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Windham County, Vermont References City and town halls on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Gothic Revival architecture in Vermont Buildings and structures completed in 1828 Buildings and structures in Dover, Vermont Town halls in Vermont National Register of Historic Places in Windham County, Vermont ","title":"Dover Town Hall"},{"id":"48605752","text":"Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate, sold under the brand name Taclonex among others, is a fixed-dose combination medication of the synthetic vitamin D3 analog calcipotriol (also known as calcipotriene) and the synthetic corticosteroid betamethasone dipropionate for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. It is used in the form of ointment, topical suspension, gel, aerosol, and foam.  Medical uses  Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) is a topical medication for the treatment of trunk, limb, and scalp plaque psoriasis. This medication is available in ointment, gel, aerosol, or foam, formulations. The ointment formulation was FDA approved in 2004, and is indicated for the once daily topical treatment of plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris amenable to topical therapy.Daivobet 50/500 ointment package insert 29 April 2011 The foam formulation was approved by the FDA in 2015, and is indicated for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in patients twelve years of age and older. In all pivotal trials of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment, topical suspension, or foam, treatment success or achievement of 'clear' or 'almost clear' disease was defined by Investigator's Global Assessment, an alternative to the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. ;Ointment In an international, double-blind, parallel group study of 1603 participants with psoriasis (affecting at least 10% of one or more body regions), more patients on once-daily calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment had controlled disease, defined as having absence or very mild disease at 4 weeks (56.3%) compared with Cal 50 μg/g (22.3%). In addition, a retrospective analysis of data from six phase 3, double-blind studies found that more patients treated with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment achieved PASI 75 than patients treated with individual components, regardless of baseline disease severity. ;Foam The foam formulation has been studied in two pivotal, randomized, double-blind trials in patients with mild to severe plaque psoriasis. In the first study (randomized, phase 2) of 302 patients with body and scalp psoriasis, more patients treated with calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) foam achieved 'clear' or ' almost clear' disease (45%) according to the IGA by 4 weeks compared with Cal 50 mcg/g or BD 0.5 mg/g (15% and 31%, respectively).Lebwhol M, Tyring S, Bukhalo M, et al. A novel aerosol foam formulation of calcipotriene 0.005% (Cal) plus betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% (BD) is more efficacious than Cal and BD foam alone in treating psoriasis vulgaris: a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, three-arm, Phase II study. Presented at the 73rd Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. March 20–24, 2015. In a second study (randomized, phase 3) of patients with psoriasis on the body (N=426), a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with once-daily Cal/BD foam achieved 'clear' or 'almost clear' disease (53.3%) vs. those receiving the vehicle control (4.8%). Mean modified PASI score was also significantly lower for patients treated with Cal/BD foam compared with vehicle (2.0 vs 5.5, respectively, at week 4), and itch relief was significantly greater in patients using the Cal/BD foam beginning at day 3. A recent study compared the Cal/BD foam formulation with the ointment formulation in patients with mild to severe psoriasis. At 4 weeks, significantly more patients achieved treatment success, defined as 'clear' or 'almost clear' disease according to the IGA with Cal/BD foam (54.6%) versus the ointment (43.0%). However, pronounced itch relief occurred quickly and was maintained throughout the 4-week study duration with both formulations.  Contraindications  Calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either glucocorticoids or vitamin D or disorders in calcium metabolism. This drug is also contraindicated for patients with erythrodermic, exfoliative, or pustular psoriasis.  Adverse effects  A number of clinical studies have been conducted to investigate possible adverse events of this fixed combination corticosteroid and vitamin D analog. Safety and tolerability of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) ointment has been assessed in a combined total of 2448 patients, exposed to treatment for 4 or 8 weeks (median weekly dose of 24.5 g). The most common adverse events for patients receiving Cal/BD were pruritus (3.1%), headache (2.8%), and nasopharyngitis (2.3%). Lesional/perilesional adverse events, defined as an adverse event located ≤2 cm from the lesional border, were reported by 8.7% of patients treated with Cal/BD ointment. Median time to onset of lesional/perilesional adverse events was 7 days. Adverse events during treatment with the foam formulation have been evaluated in three 4-week randomized, multicenter, prospective vehicle- and/or active-controlled clinical trials of subjects with plaque psoriasis. The median weekly dose was 24.8 g. Application site irritation, application site pruritus (itching), folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles), skin hypopigmentation (loss of skin color), hypercalcemia (increased blood calcium levels), urticaria, and exacerbation of psoriasis were reported in <1% of subjects. Local long-term adverse effects of continuous steroid exposure may include skin atrophy, stretch marks, telangiectasia (spider veins), dryness, local infections, and miliaria (\\"prickly heat\\").  Pharmacology = Pharmacodynamics  A number of clinical studies have been conducted to research possible adverse effects of this drug combination, which can be expected from experiences with corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs. =Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression= In a small study of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) ointment once-daily for 4 weeks, no patients (N=11 tested) demonstrated adrenal suppression defined as 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level ≤18 mcg/dL. In two other studies of Cal/BD ointment, 1 patient of 19 (5.3%) had adrenal suppression, as did 5 patients of 32 (15.6%) after 4 weeks of treatment. In the latter study, it may be noted that patients used Cal/BD ointment on the body in addition to Cal/BD topical suspension on the scalp. Potential effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA axis) function of the foam formulation were evaluated in a clinical trial of adults (N=35) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis covering a mean of 18% of the body surface area of the trunk and limbs and 50% of the scalp. The foam was applied once daily to all lesions on the trunk, limbs and scalp for 4 weeks. Mean (range) weekly exposure was 62 (13.5–113) g. After 4 weeks, no patient exhibited adrenal suppression, defined as a cortisol level ≤497 nmol/L 30 minutes after adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge. Lack of adrenal suppression over the course of four weeks does not preclude the possibility of HPA axis suppression during prolonged exposure. =Effects on calcium metabolism= In patients treated with both calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) ointment on the body and Cal/BD topical suspension on the scalp (n=35), 1 patient (2.9%) had elevated urinary calcium levels after 4 weeks of treatment. Three studies of Cal/BD topical suspension have evaluated treatment effects on calcium metabolism. In 2 of the 3 trials (n=32 and n=43), elevated urinary calcium levels outside the normal range were observed in 2 patients each. In the third trial (n=109), no clinically relevant changes in urinary calcium were reported. Potential effects on calcium metabolism have been evaluated in three randomized, multicenter, prospective, vehicle- and/or active-controlled trials of the foam formulation enrolling 564 adults with plaque psoriasis. The foam was applied once daily for four weeks. In these trials, three subjects had serum calcium levels elevated above the upper limit of normal. Urinary calcium elevations above normal were reported in 17 subjects. In a published multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial of the foam formulation, 35 adults with plaque psoriasis applied the foam once daily to all lesions on the trunk, limbs, and scalp for four weeks. No elevations of serum calcium, urinary calcium, or the ratio of urinary calcium to creatinine above the upper limit of normal were observed.  History  The combination was developed by LEO Pharma. To combine them, new non-aqueous non-alcohol formulations had to be found to avoid mutual degradation of the two active substances while also achieving the desired skin absorption. The ointment formulation (Taclonex) was approved in 2006, by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris in adults 18 years and older. The topical suspension formulation (Taclonex) was approved in 2008, by the FDA for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp and body in adults 18 years and older. In 2014, the FDA also approved the topical suspension formulation for the treatment of plaque psoriasis of the scalp in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. The foam formulation (Enstilar) was approved in October 2015, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The ointment and topical suspension formulation (Daivobet) were also approved in 2010 by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of plaque psoriasis where it is possible to use a topical medication (ointment), and for the treatment of scalp psoriasis or mild to moderate plaque psoriasis on the body (topical suspension).

Plot After losing her son Oliver, who drowned in a car accident in India, Maria Harwood has not recovered from the tragedy. During the accident, Maria chose to save her youngest daughter, Lucy, instead of Oliver because Oliver's leg is stuck and she cannot get it out. Maria is consumed by her guilt ever since. One night, her husband Michael finds Maria unconscious after a suicide attempt. In the hospital, Maria is comforted by her housekeeper Piki. Piki asks Maria if she wants one final chance to say goodbye to Oliver. Piki explains that she has been in a similar position and predicament, where she lost her daughter in a drowning incident due to not paying attention. According to Piki, there is an abandoned temple in her hometown where the line between the living and the dead is very thin. Maria must scatter her son's ashes at the temple steps and lock herself in. Oliver will speak to her once night falls. However, no matter what Oliver says, Maria must not open the temple door for him. Maria agrees and the pair have Oliver's body exhumed and burned. Maria notices some strange men covered in ash. Piki explains that they are shamans who consume the flesh of the dead and coat themselves in ash to strengthen their bonds between the worlds of the living and the dead. The next day Maria arrives at the temple and follows Piki's instructions. Inside, she uncovers a mummified corpse of a woman. Night falls and Oliver begins talking to Maria, who apologizes to Oliver for leaving him. Oliver starts pleading with Maria to open the door but she explains that she cannot do that. When Oliver says he has to leave Maria panics wanting more time and opens the door, but sees no one. She returns home the next day; now having closure, she focuses her attention on Michael and Lucy but doesn't tell Piki that she opened the door. Strange things start happening; their piano plays itself and Lucy tells Maria that Oliver has come back and that he is hiding from someone. Lucy also tells Maria that she should not let Michael know about Oliver's return until Oliver is ready to. In Oliver's room, a chair moves toward her, along with The Jungle Book, which Maria was reading to Oliver when he died, but never finished. Realising Oliver wants her to finish the book, she does so. Piki notices that the nearby plants have started dying and begins to realize that Maria had disobeyed her instructions at the temple. Later, the decomposed body of Oliver appears near Lucy. Maria discovers a bloody bite mark on her shoulder when giving Lucy a bath. Whereas Lucy was fond of Oliver's return in the past, she tells Maria that she no longer likes Oliver. She enters Oliver's room and tells him that he can't hurt Lucy. Oliver pulls out the chair and book again and Maria starts reading to him as long as he doesn't hurt Lucy. A shaman appears at the house and points behind Maria; she sees the mummified body from the temple behind her, which chases her. The next day, an outraged Piki confronts Maria and explains to her that due to her actions, Oliver's soul cannot be properly reincarnated and has become evil. She reveals to Maria that the strange figure she has been seeing is Myrtu, the gatekeeper of the underworld, who reclaims the soul of the dead. Piki urges Maria to burn all of Oliver's possessions to break his hold on the living world. While Piki attempts to discard and burn all of Oliver's remaining possessions, Oliver uses the guise of Piki's dead daughter to lure her to a pond and drown her. After Piki's funeral, Michael comes home and discovers Maria has finished burning Oliver's possessions. Distraught and angry, Michael does not believe Maria as she attempts to explain her actions. Reinforcing his mistrust, Lucy suddenly denies any knowledge of Oliver returning. Maria after realizes that Oliver has possessed Lucy. Michael believes that Maria is becoming mentally unhinged and locks her in a room. The shamans begin to crowd the house; the possessed Lucy kills the Harwood’s Golden Retriever Winston with a knife and stabs a horrified Michael. Maria breaks out and heads up to Oliver's room where she sees shamans chanting over Lucy's body. Since they cannot remove the spirit from Lucy, they plan to sacrifice her. However, Michael stops them and Maria tells Oliver that he needs to leave. Oliver says he is scared, but Maria says she will go with him. Oliver's spirit leaves Lucy's body and enters Maria's. She charges the shaman with the knife telling him to take her instead. He obliges, fatally stabbing her. She falls and awakens in the room alone. Myrtu appears and takes Maria to the afterlife. Maria then wakes up and briefly believes that she is alive. She hears Michael's voice call out for her. She sees the temple steps and realises Michael is attempting the same ritual to bring back Maria as she did with Oliver. Maria screams for him not to open the door, and the terror repeats itself again.

Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 35%, based on reviews from 37 critics, with an average rating of 4.62/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Laden with flimsy jump scares and cheap stereotypes, The Other Side of the Door wastes solid work from Sarah Wayne Callies on thoroughly middling horror fare.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 41% based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Christian Holub from Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-, writing, \\"like all the best horror, The Other Side of the Door is concerned not just with what freaks us out on a gut level, but the deeply-repressed anxieties that truly terrify us.\\" Critic Tim Janson, at the SciFi Movie Page gave the film two stars out of five stating the film \\"is a predictable, by-the-numbers affair which marks no new territory.\\" Tom Huddleston of Time Out noted how the film panders to seamier representations of India \\"packed with scowling beggars, scuttling cockroaches, dutiful housemaids and shady shamans\\" — and that by doing so, the film was ultimately \\"so tasteless and knee-jerk in its depiction that it makes Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom look like a triumph of racial awareness.\\" Geoff Berkshire of Variety agreed with that assessment, adding \\"with a bare minimum of anthropological curiosity ... there’s no interest in mining the setting for anything other than exploitation.\\" ReferencesExternal links  2016 films 2016 horror films 20th Century Fox films British films Indian films British supernatural horror films Indian supernatural horror films British ghost films Indian ghost films English-language films Films set in Mumbai Films shot in Mumbai 2010s supernatural horror films Films directed by Johannes Roberts ","title":"The Other Side of the Door (2016 film)"},{"id":"48605861","title":"List of Scotland women ODI cricketers"},{"id":"48605878","title":"2015 World Weightlifting Championships – Men's 105 kg"},{"id":"48605882","text":"Jenaro Prieto (1889–1946) was Chilean journalist, writer and politician.Bizzarro p.609 He served as a member of the National Congress of Chile for the Conservative Party during the 1930s.

Within forty-eight hours 65,000 men had volunteered their services. The 104th mustered into service at Greensburg on July 10, 1863, under the command of Colonel James Gavin. The regiment included six companies of \\"Minute Men\\" and four companies from the Indiana Legion, the state's militia. The majority of the men from the 104th came from Marion County, Decatur County, Fayette County, and Dearborn County, Indiana. During its brief term of service, the 104th marched from Greensburg to Lawrenceburg, Indiana, by way of Sunman's Station, before heading toward Harrison, Ohio.

He is the professor and vice chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and is the current medical director of WWE.UPMC websiteUniversity of Pittsburgh Neurosurgery website He is particularly known for his work studying concussions and concussion prevention as well as his hypothesis (after the discovery of the CTE by Dr Bennet Omalu) on the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).  Education  Maroon earned his B.S. degree in anatomy and physiology from Indiana University in 1961, and his M.D. from the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSOM) in 1965. He received post-graduate education at IUSOM (1966), Georgetown University Hospital (1967), John Radcliffe Hospital (1969), IUSOM (1971) and the University of Vermont College of Medicine (1972).  Career = Neurosurgical research and innovations  Maroon has conducted extensive research into neurotrauma, brain tumors and diseases of the spine, which led to many innovative techniques for diagnosing and treating these disorders. Maroon was the first to publish on the use of ultrasound to detect venous air emboli (1968). Maroon et al. were the first to publish on the use of ultrasound to detect air in patients during neurosurgical procedures (1969) and to assess ophthalmic artery reversal of flow indicating a thrombosis of the carotid artery (1969). Maroon et al. published the simplified instrumentation for performing microvascular surgery in 1973 and in 1975, they pioneered the microsurgical approach to intra-orbital tumors. In 1977, they pioneered the use of CT scanning as a guidance system for performing intracranial biopsy. In the same year, Maroon published the first paper on “burning hands” syndrome related to sports related spinal cord injuries in JAMA. In 1982, Maroon et al. pioneered the radical orbital decompression procedure for severe dysthyroid exophthalmos. In 1985, they were the first to compare microsurgical disc removal with chemonucleolysis, and in 1986, they were the first to use a carbon dioxide laser in the management of lymphangiomas of the orbit. That year, Maroon et al. were among the first to describe their surgery outcomes with microlumbar discectomy. In 1987, Maroon and Onik introduced percutaneous automated discectomy as a new minimally invasive way to remove lumbar discs, and subsequently published extensively on this technique. In 1990, Maroon et al. published the first microsurgical approach to far lateral disc herniations in the lumbar spine and in 2007, they published the case of Golfer's Stroke from Vertebral Artery Dissection. Further groundbreaking publications include the use of fish oil as an anti- inflammatory and alternative to nonsteroidal drugs for discogenic pain (2006); a unifying, immunoexcitotoxicity hypothesis for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (2011); and the possible use of a restricted calorie ketogenic diet for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (2013).  Sports medicine, concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)  Maroon is the team neurosurgeon for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the medical director of WWE. He is past-President of the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. Together with neuropsychologist Mark Lovell, Maroon developed ImPACT (Immediate Post- Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing), a test to assess presence and severity of concussion symptoms. This has become the standard tool to assess sports-related concussions. Maroon is interested in the prevention and treatment of concussions, specifically in football. In 2006, he joined the National Football League’s mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee, which, in 2007, was renamed the Head, Neck and Spine Committee. He has been consulted as expert by American media on this subject.Frontline interview with Maroon by Jim Gilmore on April 17, 2013Focus on Sports and Concussion CBS News Oct 18, 2011Sports on Earth website retrieved August 28, 2015 Based on his research into the predictors and scope of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), he claims there is reason to be skeptical of the reported widespread incidence of CTE. His position has mostly been met with negative comment across the media and sports press due to the NFL having as many as 4500 former players reporting symptoms of CTE.Profootball talk, retrieved September 2, 2015Huffington Post, retrieved September 2, 2015Inquisitr, retrieved September 2, 2015Washington Post, retrieved September 2, 2015ESPN, retrieved September 1, 2015Sports Illustrated, retrieved September 1, 2015VOX, retrieved September 2, 2015CBS local New York, retrieved September 2, 2015 Maroon was asked to testify to the New York City Council on a proposed rule on sideline medical coverage for organized youth football in the city.New York City Council, retrieved August 30, 2015 Together with Russell Blaylock, he developed an inflammation hypothesis for the biochemical mechanisms involved in the development of CTE following head trauma.

Since the release of the movie, several people came forward in defense of Maroon, stating that his portrayal in the movie is sensationalized and incorrect. Burnout prevention and balancing life After his personal experience with burnout at the peak of his medical career, Maroon developed a strong interest in burnout prevention and living a more balanced life. He conducted extensive research into burnout, burnout prevention, and what constitutes a healthy, balanced and successful life, outside of a professional career. Maroon has given keynote presentations on this subject matter at national and international conferences.https://www.cns.org/about-us/history/biography/3036 In 2017, he published the book Square One: A Simple Guide to a Balanced Life.https://www.maroonsquareone.com/  Publications  Maroon has published over 270 peer-reviewed scientific articles, some of which may be found in the United States National Library of Medicine's publication database; his H-index, a measure of scientific research impact, is 43.

She has also received a CNRS Bronze Medal.  Early life  Avarguès-Weber is from Givry, in France. After graduating high school in Chalon-sur-Saône, she chose to study in a Classe Préparatoire in Lyon, and developed a passion for biology and physiology.  Education and research  Avarguès-Weber studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan. She then researched her PhD in the lab of Martin Giurfa at the Research Centre for Animal Cognition (Centre de Recherches sur la Cognition Animale, CRCA) in Toulouse, defending her thesis in 2010. She then undertook two post-doctoral research positions, one under Lars Chittka at Queen Mary University, and one with Jean-Christophe Sandoz in Gif-sur-Yvette. She currently works in the CRCA's EXPerience-dependent PLAsticity in INsects (EXPLAIN) team. Though she initially wanted to study orangutangs, Avarguès-Weber has focused on bees since 2007. The results of her research have implications for both computer science and facial recognition. Amongst other things, her lab has shown that bees are capable of numerical cognition and mathematical abstraction: they can add and subtract, and they recognise the concept of zero. She has also shown that bees can recognise face-like patterns. She is currently developing a virtual reality system to test more complex abilities of bees.  Awards and achievements  Averguès-Weber has received an International Rising Talent Fellowship, and was awarded the L'Oréal-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science in 2015, along with prize money of 20,000 euros.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple was demolished by the French troops in 1748. Shiva is worshipped as Vedapureeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Tiripurasundari. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. A Dewan named Dewan Kandappa Mudaliar expanded the temple with the help of public contributions in 1788. The temple is open from 6 am - 12:30 pm and 4:30 - 8:00 pm on all days. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam festival during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June), Annabishekam during Aipassi (October - November) and Sivarathri during Masi (February - March) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Department of Hindu religious institutions and Wakf of the Government of Puducherry. History Image of the temple tank Puducherry or Pondicherry was originally called Podouke(This was mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.). This old port town Podouke( Now it is called Arikamedu) is 4 km from the present Puducherry. As per investigation by Vimala Begley, this port city Podouke was at the peak between from the 2nd century BCE to the 8th century CE. This port city enjoyed extensive trade relations with Imperial Rome. François Martin the first Governor General of French India founded the modern Pondicherry, the future capital of French India in 1674. The Varadaraja temple housed the images of the Vedapureeswarar Temple during the destruction by the French troops during 1748. It is believed that the temple was totally destructed by the invading French troops and earlier by Muslim invaders. Dewan Kandappa Mudaliar, with the help of public contributions, reconstructed the temple in 1788. The details of the demolition has been recorded in the diary of a chronicler of a period named Ananda Rangam Pillai. The presiding deity in the temple is believed to have been migrated from the Samba Easwaran street to the temple during the later part of the 19th century. The temple is maintained and administered by Sri Vedapureeswarar Sri Varadaraja Perumal Devastanam under the Department of Hindu religious institutions and Wakf of the Government of Puducherry. Architecture Vedapureeswarar temple has a seven-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower raising to a height of . The presiding deity Vedapureeswarar, in the form of Lingam is housed in the sanctum. The sanctum is approached from the main entrance through the flag staff hall, Maha mandap and Artha mandap. The flag staff is located in the flagstaff hall axial to the sanctum. An image of Nandi faces the main shrine in the Maha Mandap. There are shrines of Vinayaga and Muruga before the Mahamandap and the sanctum is guarded by Dwarapalas. The shrine of Tiripurasundari is located in the second precinct. There also shrines of Shani, Durga, Chandikeswara, Dakshninamurthy and Navagraha around the sanctum. The rectangular temple tank is located inside the temple and has 35 steps to the basement Festival Aerial view of the temple The temple follows Saivite tradition.

Work Noterman painted mainly scenes with animals including portraits of dogs as well as scenes involving cats and dogs. Noterman was particularly interested in the subject of singeries, which are humoristic paintings and etchings of monkeys engaging in human activities. The monkeys in the scenes are often dressed in costumes which adds comedy to their 'aping' of a specific human action (often a vice such as smoking or gambling) or occupation such as a dentist, lawyer, painter, art critic, etc. Noterman's work shows a growing interest in realism in painting in Belgium.

It was the subject of his research at the University of Nottingham which got published in 1997 and is copyrighted to Dr. Srivastava (Ref:5).

Since its wider dissemination it is now prevalent in various forms - the original continued to be used in Luton and some other areas by the author's permission but many unauthorised versions also began to be used.

Evaluation  A recent qualitative evaluation of the Graded Care Profile found that social workers felt the tool was useful in helping them identify the right help for children at risk of harm. It also helped them develop a good working relationship with the family because it allowed them to identify what the family was doing well, in addition to what needed to be improved.

It was released by Fika Recordings on 6 November 2015. Background Florence is Hayman's first solo album not to feature any other guest musicians. It is named after the Italian city of Florence where the album was written and recorded by Hayman whilst on holiday. Hayman was visiting Elizabeth Morris of Allo Darlin' and Ola Innset of Making Marks and recorded the album in their apartment. Florence was released on vinyl and via digital download. Critical reception On the Metacritic website, which aggregates reviews from critics and assigns a normalised rating out of 100, Florence received a score of 74, based on 2 mixed and 4 positive reviews. Record Collector write that \\"Hayman’s lyrics, vocals and musicianship add up to a frequently touching whole\\" but feel that most of the songs are \\"full of potential\\" rather than being the finished article. The review by Folk Radio UK calls the album \\"one of his best surprises yet\\" describing the song arrangements as \\"uncluttered\\" and the album as \\"sad and muted\\". The Line of Best Fit calls Florence \\"another excellent addition to Darren Hayman’s sterling oeuvre\\", calling the lyrics \\"superb\\" and noting Hayman's \\"ever- observant eye for detail\\". The NME state that Florence \\"unfolds like a giant lullaby\\" in their review. musicOMH call Florence an album \\"of love and relationships\\", writing of album closer \\"The English Church\\" that, \\"like the rest of the album, it is full of understated charm and is quite, quite beautiful\\".

Originally named the College Building, the King's Building was designed by Sir Robert Smirke in the course of the College's foundation in 1829. As the founding building, it was built between 1829 and 1831 on land granted to King's College by the Government to complete the riverside frontage of Somerset House. There are today a total of eight floors in the King's Building: Basement level, Ground level, Levels 1 to 4, Level 4U and Level 6. The King's Building houses a number of administrative departments (Estates & Facilities Offices, Admissions Office, Accommodation and Cashiers' Office), lecture theatres (most notably the Edmond J. Safra Lecture Theatre and Anatomy Lecture Theatre), the College Chapel, the Great Hall, various function rooms (Old Council Room, Committee Room, River Room, Somerset Room, St David's Room), study rooms and a catering outlet.http://www.kcl.ac.uk/study/campus/strand.aspx King's Building Foyer King's Building Foyer is the old entrance hall of the building. Two marble statues of Sappho and Sophocles are placed in the foyer. They were bequeathed in 1923 by Frida Mond, the wife of Ludwig Mond and a friend of Israel Gollancz, Professor of English Language and Literature at King's College London. The two statues are said to symbolise the King's motto of sancte et sapienter ('holiness and wisdom'). The papier-mâché version of Reggie the Lion, the mascot of King's College London Students' Union (KCLSU) is also placed in the King's Building foyer, behind Sappho on the staircase outside the Great Hall. The King's Building Foyer regularly displays free exhibitions in foyer display cases. The exhibitions are curated by King's College London Archives and Special Collections, Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives at King's, and sometimes co-curated with other organisations outside the College, such as the British Dental Association Museum. Great Hall The Great Hall is located on the Ground floor of the King's Building. It is one of the central congregation spaces within the building, and is used for many events and activities, including the annual King's Fellows Dinner, banquetings, examinations, press conferences and presentations. The architect of Buckingham Palace, Sir John Nash, offered free services for the building and the Great Hall. However, this was declined by King's College. The College was in favour of the services of the architect of the British Museum, Sir Robert Smirke, since Smirke was already the architect of Somerset House. In the 21st century, the Great Hall was refurbished and restored. Many original features and styles of the Hall have been restored, including the oak panelling, joinery and the King's College crest. The Grade I listed windows were repaired, and the Grade I listed ceiling and the original column capital were repainted.  College Chapel Sir George Gilbert Scottthumb The College Chapel forms part of the King's building. It was originally designed by Sir Robert Smirke in 1831. The Neo-Renaissance chapel seen today was designed and reconstructed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1864, at a cost of just over £7,000. The College Chapel is located on Level 2, which is above the Great Hall. It is accessible via a grand double staircase from the foyer. The original chapel was described as a low and broad room \\"fitted to the ecclesiological notions of George IV's reign.\\"Heulin (1979), p. 1 However, it was proposed to be reconstructed in 1859 since its style had fallen out of fashion. Scott suggested that \\"...in a classic building, the best mode of giving ecclesiastical character is the adoption of the form and, in some degree, the character of an ancient basilica.\\" There were many developments in the 20th century that changed the design of the chapel. For example, the windows were glazed with tinted cathedral glass instead of stained glass under church architect Dykes Bower's direction, and the original designs on the aisle and apse walls were repainted. Anatomy Theatre and Museum The Anatomy Theatre and Anatomy Museum are located on Level 6 of the King's Building. The Anatomy Theatre was built in 1927 above the College Chapel. It was originally an institution (anatomical theatre) used in teaching anatomy, however the last anatomical dissection and demonstration took place in 1997. Renovated in 2009, the Anatomy Theatre and Museum is now a facility for teaching, research and performance, and is programmed and managed by King's Cultural Institute. Because of the fact that many original features of the Anatomy Theatre were still intact, restoration and replacements were carried out. A sprung floor was laid, Access Grid technology and digital surround sound was designed, and a projector was installed in the Anatomy Museum. The anatomy professor's office was also stripped back to its original tiles and was converted to a canteen.

Incumbent President Thomas Boni Yayi was at the end of his second presidential term and was constitutionally barred from running for a third. The elections grabbed the interest of many of the country's top businessmen, resulting in over 30 candidates running for the presidency. A second round was held on 20 March, in which businessman Patrice Talon defeated Prime Minister Lionel Zinsou. Background During 2015 and 2016 the leaders of some African countries undertook efforts to remain in power after decades of rule; a referendum in Rwanda resulted in Paul Kagame being allowed to remain in power, there was unrest in Burundi over President Pierre Nkurunziza's plans to run for a third term, whilst the long-term presidents of Uganda and the Republic of the Congo ran for office again. However, in West Africa, the long-term president of Burkina Faso was removed from office and Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan left office after losing an election.Motorcycle Riders at Forefront of Benin's Election Campaign Bloomberg News, 3 March 2016 The body charged with producing the new voter cards failed to live up to their deadlines of distributing cards. This caused the Constitutional Court to first delay the elections by a week, and then make the ruling that old voter cards issued prior to the 2011 elections would also be accepted as the court feared that voters might be disenfranchised. Campaign Campaigning was only permitted for a 15-day period directly before the elections. The Constitutional Court sanctioned a campaign period from 19 February to 4 March 2016. Candidates The Résoatao Party selected its candidate via party primaries held on 7 November 2015; its leader and sole MP Mohamed Atao Hinnouho was chosen with 141 votes, with the president of the party's women's branch Eliane Saizonou receiving 14 votes and the party's first councillor Félix Tohoyessou eight.\\"Elections primaires du Parti RésoAtao\\", Actu Benin Prime Minister Lionel Zinsou announced on 1 December 2015 that he would stand as the candidate of the Cowry Forces for an Emerging Benin, the party of President Yayi Boni, in the 2016 presidential election. He said that he would focus on financing agriculture and helping informal workers obtain formal employment.\\"Benin PM Zinsou confirms to run for president in 2016 polls\\", Reuters, 2 December 2015. Zinsou's French background attracted some criticism. At a meeting of a grouping of Zinsou's opponents held on 5 January 2016, a trade union leader denounced Zinsou as \\"a colonizer\\" who was \\"parachuted in ... to safeguard the economic crimes of Boni Yayi\\". The government defended Zinsou, stressing that he was \\"a full citizen of Benin\\" and that arguing that his opponents were appealing to \\"base instincts of hatred, racism, fear and intolerance.\\"Allegresse Sasse, \\"Benin politicians attack president's favored successor\\", Reuters, 5 January 2016.

Independent candidates included the businessmen Patrice Talon and Sebastien Adjavon. The Autonomous National Electoral Commission (CENA) announced on 13 January 2016 that 48 people had filed the necessary paperwork to stand as presidential candidates, although their candidacies still needed to be approved by the Constitutional Court.\\"Record 48 candidates seek Benin presidency\\", Agence France-Presse, 13 January 2016. Each candidate had to submit health certificates that prove a clean bill of health and deposit a filing fee of an equivalent $25,000. The court cleared 36 candidates and dropped 11 candidates for not providing sufficient evidence for various standard requirements. Three further candidates dropped from the race prior to the allocated campaigning period. Results Provisional results released on 8 March 2016 showed Lionel Zinsou placing first with 28.4% of the vote. Patrice Talon placed second with 24.8% and Sebastien Ajavon placed third with 23.03%. Zinsou was therefore expected to face Talon in a second round of voting.\\"Benin PM Zinsou faces run-off in presidential election\\", Reuters, 8 March 2016. For the second round, Talon received the support of 24 out of 32 of the defeated first round candidates. Most notably, he received the backing of Ajavon. The second round was held on 20 March 2016.

During the British Iron Age, there was a hillfort in the area but it had gone out of use after the Romans had invaded. Due to constant raids from border reivers in the 13th century, defensive bastle farmhouses were constructed to defend the local population. The modern hamlet is based around Embleton Terrace, which was constructed in 1926 to house lead miners at the nearby Lee Lead Pit, which had been abandoned a year prior due to flooding. The lease to the land was sold in 1929 with “TGR with 30 cotts and bldgs erctd thron” (30 cottages and building erected thereon) for £1,500 to colliery owner Charles Nelson who then sold it for £2,300 to John Snaith.

As a result, her home was a home where “conversations about poverty, the death penalty, the prevalence of homelessness, presidential elections and warfare were commonplace, as were talks about the importance of community and charity”. Her upbringing is reflected in her plays, where characters that live in tragic and unfortunate situations are explored and social justice issues are presented to start conversations.

Rivendell Theatre Ensemble. 21 Mar. 2012. Web. 29 Nov. 2015. . Romero started by writing ten-minute plays, until she realized that she had a lot more to say about war. Romero decided to write a trilogy of the United States at war, which are Graveyard of Empires, A Work of Art, and Rain of Ruin. Graveyard of Empires was produced by the 16th Street Theater and won the American Blues Theater's Blue Ink Playwriting Award. In developing A Work of Art, Romero was a member of the Goodman Playwrights Unit at the Goodman Theatre. In both plays, Romero focuses on how war emotionally traumatizes those who do service for the United States as well as family members. There is no representation of the United States as a nation or information on war combats.

Life  Deliana was born in 1925 in on Orthodox family of the Kala neighborhood of Elbasan in central Albania. He finished the elementary school in his town, and then enrolled in the Normal School of Elbasan where he was taught by Aleksander Xhuvani. As many other attenders of the school, he joined the ranks of the National Liberation Movement (LANC) during World War II. After distinguishing himself as a youth-member of the resistance, he was elected member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Antifascist Youth - the youth fraction of the LANC, in its first congress held in Helmës of Skrapar region. In September 1944, he was elected Head of the Antifascist Youth of Elbasan District and member of the Antifascist Council of LANC. After World War II, with the rise of the Communists in power, he started working in the State Planning Commission, a crucial entity which would control all the economic life of the country, and later as a staff member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania. Deliana went to study in Moscow where he graduated in philosophy. Upon his return in Albania, he was elected First Secretary of the Party for Elbasan, and member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour. In October 1961 he was appointed Deputy Minister and two years later Minister of Education and Culture. During his term he successfully completed major tasks that were under his ministry's area of responsibility. One was the total reconstruction of the textbooks; all of them needed revision to reflect the new Party of Labour's ideological line after the Soviet-Albanian split. The other was the unification of the Albanian language standard, which was achieved by the Orthography Congress of 1972. Other major achievements were the establishment of the Academy of Sciences of Albania, and two national pedagogy congresses held in Tirana. In 1975, at the eve of the Sino-Albanian split, he was targeted and accused of opportunism and anti-Party spirit. He was expelled from the party together with Fadil Paçrami. The wave of persecution would continue soon with the demise of Koço Theodhosi, Abdyl Këllezi, Kiço Ngjela, etc., all high rank Communist officials and government ministers. To his list of accusations was added the favoring of former deputy ministers Hasan Duma and Mantho Bala, both accused of \\"immorality\\" and already demised. Deliana wrote an autocritique letter to Enver Hoxha, which saved his life. He was initially sent to Sinanaj village near Tepelenë where he worked as the local elementary school director. He was removed from that position and sent to work in the state-controlled agricultural cooperative where he worked in animal husbandry until 1987 when he retired. After his retirement, he moved back to Elbasan. Deliana died on 14 September 2014.

In a major reconstruction in 1888–89 much of the structure was replaced and the building became the Bourse de commerce. The structure influenced the design of public buildings in Britain and the United States. History The city of Paris purchased the site of the former Hôtel de Soissons in 1755. The hôtel had been demolished and its materials sold, but the Medici column was left standing. On 23 November 1762 King Louis XV of France (1710–74) declared that a hall of grain and flour (halle aux blés et farines) would be built on the site. Construction of the hall began in 1763 following a design by Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières (1721–89), who supervised the work. The circular hall surrounding a circular courtyard was completed in 1767. Six roads radiated from the Rue Viarmes, which ran around the hall. Work on a wooden dome to cover the courtyard began on 10 September 1782 and was completed on 31 January 1783. The wooden dome was destroyed by fire in 1802. An imperial decree of 4 September 1807 stated that the hall was to be covered by a dome with cast-iron vertical arches covered in tinned copper. The replacement was complete in 1811. The building, now made entirely of stone, brick, iron and copper, was considered fireproof. In 1854 there was another fire in the building. By the start of the Second French Empire (1852–70) the hall was no longer used to store flour. It was too small to serve the needs of the two million inhabitants of Paris and had become a sort of bourse, or exchange for titles to grain from Beauce, Brie and Picardy, and flour from the mills of Seine-et-Marne and Seine-et-Oise. The grain and flour was then delivered via rail direct from the provinces to the bakers and merchants. Fortunes were made and lost through speculation, not always honestly. The corn exchange was closed in 1873. In 1885 the building was assigned to the Commodities Exchange. Structure thumb The building was circular, with an exterior diameter of , and enclosed a round court with a diameter of . The building was pierced by 28 arcades on the ground floor, and the same number of windows on the floor above. The upper floor was reached by a double stairway, so that those going up one stairway would not meet those going down the other. Originally there was no roof over the central courtyard. In 1782 François-Joseph Bélanger (1744–1818) proposed to add an iron cupola to cover the courtyard, but his plan was rejected. Instead, from 1782 to 1783 a laminated wood dome was built to a design by Jacques-Guillaume Legrand (1753–1807) and Jacques Molinos (1743–1831) based on the principles defined by Philibert de l'Orme (–1570). The wooden dome was pierced by 25 large skylights. These took the form of continuous glass ribbons between the ribs of the dome. Even in dull and overcast weather they let in a considerable amount of light. The dome was almost in circumference, and its summit was above ground level. The interior of the rotunda was decorated with medallion portraits of Louis XVI, police lieutenant Jean-Charles-Pierre Lenoir (1732–1807) and Philibert Delorme, inventor of the technique used to make the dome. During the French Revolution (1789–99) the medallions of the king and Lenoir were destroyed in 1791. On 16 October 1802 the cupola was destroyed by fire. The Minister of the Interior ran a competition for a replacement dome, and Bélanger resubmitted his design from 1782. In 1806 Jean-Baptiste Launay presented a model for a cast-iron dome for the market to the Exposition des produits de l'industrie française. On 17 January 1807 the Ministry of the Interior jury rejected Bélanger's design, which they considered to be in bad taste, and chose a more traditional design for a stone roof. However, under pressure from the Minister, the commission selected the iron dome on 20 August 1807. Construction of the iron dome covered in sheets of copper began in 1809 and was completed in 1811. The engineer François Brunet assisted Bélanger in the calculations and design of the dome, which had a diameter of more than . It was made of 51 sections, corresponding to the midpoints of the 25 arches of the rotunda, with each section made of two beams connected by spacers. The frame weighed 220 tons and the copper sheets weighed 29 tons. The 25 windows of the old cupola were replaced by a roof lantern that illuminated the dome. The lantern had a diameter of . Victor Hugo mocked the dome on his 1831 novel Notre-Dame de Paris, calling it an English jockey-cap on a large scale. The copper sheets were replaced by glass in 1838. Leeds Corn Exchange Influence When Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) visited Paris he was highly impressed by the wooden dome, which he called the \\"most superb thing on earth\\". He proposed to copy the dome's design in three buildings in Washington, D.C. – the House chamber in the south wing of the Capitol, the White House and the Navy Yard dry dock. Latrobe was invited to Washington to take responsibility for the Capitol building as \\"surveyor of the public buildings\\". He proposed a variant of the Halle aux blés dome. The chamber would be roofed by a low-rising dome that would be hidden on the outside by the balustrade. After some delay, Jefferson accepted the modified design. The interior of the Brighton Dome incorporates elements of the wooden dome's design. It was built for the future king George IV in (1803–08). The iron dome was copied in later buildings in England such as the London Coal Exchange (1846–49) by James Bunstone Bunning and the Leeds Corn Exchange (1861–63) by Cuthbert Brodrick.

Nicknamed \\"the Sherlock Holmes of Saskatchewan\\" for her deductive skills and prominent role in police investigations and court cases, she influenced the development of forensic pathology in Canadian police work and was internationally noted for her expertise in the subject. After completing her medical degree at the University of Manitoba in 1915, McGill moved to Saskatchewan and became the provincial bacteriologist and then the provincial pathologist. She worked extensively with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and local police forces for more than thirty years, and was instrumental in establishing the first RCMP forensic laboratory. She directed the RCMP laboratory for three years, and trained new RCMP recruits in forensic detection methods. After retiring in 1946, McGill was appointed Honorary Surgeon for the RCMP by the Canadian Minister of Justice, becoming one of the first official female members of the force, and she continued to act as a consultant to the RCMP up until her death. Alongside her pathological work, McGill operated a private medical practice for the diagnosis and treatment of allergies. She was acknowledged as a specialist in allergy testing, and doctors across Saskatchewan referred patients to her care. McGill is a member of the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame. After her death, McGill Lake in northern Saskatchewan was named in her honour. Early life and education Portrait of the McGill children in 1885. From left to right: Harold, Herbert, Margaret (baby) and Frances. Frances Gertrude McGill was born on November 18, 1882 in Minnedosa, Manitoba. Her parents were Edward McGill, whose family had emigrated from Ireland to Canada in 1819, and Henrietta Wigmore, also of Irish descent. Henrietta was a former school teacher, and had once circumnavigated the globe while travelling between teaching jobs in Canada and New Zealand. Edward was active in local politics and agricultural societies, and worked as the Post-Master in Minnedosa. Frances McGill had two older brothers, Herbert and Harold, and one younger sister named Margaret. Harold eventually became a doctor, serving as a medical officer during the First World War, while Margaret became a nurse and joined the Canadian Army Medical Corps. In mid-1900, when McGill was seventeen, her parents accidentally drank contaminated water at a county fair. They became ill with typhoid fever, and both died in September within ten days of each other. McGill's eldest brother, Herbert, took over the running of the family farm until his younger siblings had completed their basic schooling.Frances McGill in 1917McGill trained as a teacher at the Winnipeg Normal School and taught summer school to fund her further education. Although she originally considered becoming a lawyer, she decided to study medicine instead. She paid for much of her schooling through scholarships. In 1915, McGill completed her medical degree at the University of Manitoba, receiving the Hutchison Gold Medal for highest academic standing, the Dean's Prize and an award for surgical knowledge. She was one of the first female medical students to graduate from the university. McGill served her internship at the Winnipeg General Hospital. She subsequently attended the provincial laboratory of Manitoba for post-graduate studies and completed training in pathology.  Career  Streetcar on bridge, looking south towards the alt=Photograph of people walking in front of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building.  Bacteriologist  Developing a growing expertise in bacteriology, McGill was named provincial bacteriologist for the Saskatchewan Department of Health in 1918. She moved to Regina for the job, where her new office and lab were located in the Saskatchewan Legislative building. She was soon responsible for handling local outbreaks of the 1918 flu epidemic. Working quickly with her colleagues, McGill produced anti-flu vaccinations for more than 60,000 Saskatchewan residents. McGill also treated returning First World War soldiers for venereal disease.  Pathologist  In 1920, McGill became provincial pathologist for Saskatchewan. Two years later she became director of the provincial laboratory. McGill now dealt with cases of suspicious death, working extensively with local police forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Her investigations required frequent travel, and McGill sometimes used a snowmobile, dog sled or float plane to reach crime scenes. In a single year, she made as many as forty-three excursions to investigate crimes, even travelling to remote northern locations in the Arctic Circle. Earning the unofficial nickname \\"the Sherlock Holmes of Saskatchewan\\", McGill gained a professional reputation as a skilled and meticulous criminologist, and was fondly called \\"Doc\\" by members of the police force. Her personal motto was reportedly \\"Think like a man, act like a lady and work like a dog.\\" She was known for handling the sometimes gruesome nature of her work by maintaining a good sense of humour, and was a formidable, no-nonsense witness in court cases. During her court testimonies, McGill sometimes encountered young Saskatchewan defense lawyer John Diefenbaker – who would later become Prime Minister of Canada – and the strong-willed pair often sparred verbally. In one court hearing, McGill told the lawyer: \\"You ask me sensible questions, Mr. Diefenbaker, and I will give you sensible answers.\\" McGill was acknowledged for her \\"untiring\\" efforts and \\"excellent\\" service in annual reports by RCMP Commissioners James Howden MacBrien and Stuart Taylor Wood. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, McGill used her resourcefulness to make do with dramatically fewer resources and a much smaller staff. In 1933, she kept within a budget of $17,000 for testing work that would normally have cost more than $122,000.McGill working in laboratory c. 1942Volunteering hundreds of additional work hours on evenings and weekends, McGill assisted the RCMP in establishing their first official laboratory for forensic detection, which opened in 1937. Despite her experience, she was not offered the position of director for the lab. The laboratory took over a substantial portion of McGill's forensic pathology workload, and over the next several years she concentrated on other projects such as developing a polio serum and becoming a specialist in allergy research. As her expertise in allergy testing gained wider notice, doctors across the province began sending their patients to McGill. She coped with the growing demands on her time by obtaining an assistant and opening a private after-hours allergy clinic located at her apartment. McGill retired from her job as provincial pathologist on November 17, 1942, having conducted more than 64,000 laboratory examinations over the course of her civil service career. She continued working at her allergy clinic two days per week, and spent more time on outdoor activities and trips with friends. Several months afterwards, McGill decided to start a new project providing vaccinations for preschool children, and subsequently set up inoculation clinics at schools across Regina.  RCMP forensic lab  In 1943, when the director of the RCMP's forensic laboratory died in an airplane accident, McGill was called in to serve as his replacement. She accepted the position on a part-time basis, continuing to operate her allergy clinic during the afternoons. In her new role as director, McGill conducted investigations across Saskatchewan and provided lectures and training in pathology and toxicology to new police officers and detectives, teaching skills related to identifying blood samples, studying crime scenes, and properly collecting and preserving evidence. In her advice to students, McGill emphasized the importance of critical thinking: \\"Don't believe all the death certificates you see. There's no reason why a man with heart disease can't have died of strychnine poisoning.\\"  Retirement and consultancy  By 1946, McGill had formally retired from directing the RCMP forensic laboratory, and in January of that year she was named Honorary Surgeon to the RCMP, appointed by the Canadian Minister of Justice. McGill was the first woman to receive the title, and the first female doctor to be publicly acknowledged as a member of the RCMP. She continued to work for the RCMP on a special consulting basis, and occasionally gave lectures and exams for police officers and investigators. She was such a thorough and articulate instructor that her teaching notes were once compiled for use in a student textbook in 1952. Her forensic work – and her reputation as one of the few female members of the RCMP – continued to attract notice across Canada and overseas. In 1952, she travelled to England and visited Scotland Yard, where she was permitted to inspect their forensic laboratories. In 1956, after an American detective magazine ran a story on her work, McGill received a request for assistance addressed to \\"Dr. Frances McGill, Canada’s Famous Pathologist, Regina, Canada.” The letter was from a woman in New York City whose brother had died under suspicious circumstances; no autopsy had been performed, and the woman had struggled to get the answers she wanted. Although McGill could not assist directly in the matter, she responded with advice on how to contact the FBI and arrange to have the body exhumed.  Cases and methodology  McGill's work sometimes allowed her to solve murders that had gone uninvestigated. During one year, she performed post-mortem examinations of thirteen exhumed bodies, and discovered that five of the bodies were murder victims. In one case – not initially suspected as a crime at all – McGill helped prove that a woman had poisoned several relatives.  The Lintlaw Case  In April 1932, farmer Joseph Shewchuk was found dead from a gunshot wound at his home in Lintlaw, Saskatchewan. Police found bloodstains all across the room – presumed evidence of a violent struggle – and also located a rifle hidden in a nearby wheat bin. The local doctor deemed it suspicious and ruled out suicide, and police arrested a neighbour who had been unable to satisfactorily explain several bloodstains on his coat. When McGill arrived to conduct a second examination, however, she discovered that the local doctor had not completed a full autopsy on the body. She ordered the body exhumed and did a new examination herself. From clues such as the distinctly awkward angle of the wound, she concluded the victim had taken his own life. Although the previous doctor had decided that the victim must have died instantaneously, McGill found evidence in Shewchuck's digestion system that proved he had lived long enough to move around his house and hide the rifle, obscuring cause of death. Witnesses confirmed that Shewchuk had struggled with depression, and it was found that Shewchuk had borrowed the rifle and cartridges himself shortly before his death. The accused neighbour – whose suspicious bloodstains were actually from an injured farm animal – was released. The Lintlaw Case had a strong impact on McGill's reputation with police, and the RCMP subsequently made it their policy to call her in immediately whenever foul play was suspected.  The Northern Trapper Case  In November 1933, a trapper named Oskar Schwab was reported missing northeast of Nipawin. A police investigation uncovered traces of blood in his shack. Although the blood's origin was initially uncertain – since Schwab had made a living trapping and skinning animals – McGill established that blood stains at the head of Schwab's mattress were indeed human, and police located a bullet lodged in the log wall nearby. The following February, police arrested Schwab's former trapping partner Thomas Kisling, who admitted to killing Schwab but subsequently tried to argue that it had been accidental or in self defence. Investigators uncovered Schwab's remains and found that the trapper's skull had been shattered into dozens of pieces by the gunshot. After completing an autopsy, McGill took the skull fragments back to her laboratory and painstakingly reconstructed it. Her work, revealing the bullet's clear trajectory and black lead markings, showed that Schwab had been shot in the back of the head while sleeping. When McGill testified in Kisling's trial, she produced the carefully reconstructed skull from her handbag and \\"a gasp went through the crowd\\" as court watchers realized what she was holding. Court reporter Ken Liddell later recalled in one of his columns that he had seen McGill bring out similar evidence in other court cases with \\"all the drama of a magician.\\"  The South Poplar Case  During a period of cold weather, a hitchhiker was found frozen to death in a southern Saskatchewan field near South Poplar, his skull apparently fractured by a blow to the head. A local doctor ruled it murder and sent the victim's remains to McGill's laboratory for further examination. When McGill examined the skull, however, she concluded that the man's bone structure had been weakened by an illness such as rickets. A truck driver admitted to drinking some alcohol with the hitchhiker, which had increased blood flow to the man's brain – and after his death, the below-freezing temperatures and position of the body had caused those fluids to expand, resulting in the apparent skull fracture. McGill found no evidence of foul play. Cause of death for the hitchhiker had been a simple heart attack.  Personal life  McGill was often private, preferring not to discuss her personal life, but many acquaintances believed that she had once lost a boyfriend to battle in the First World War. She enjoyed spending time with her siblings and other relatives whenever possible. From 1931–33, her nephew Edward came to live with her in Regina while he built up his savings for university education, and he later cited her guidance and advice as a major influence on his life. She enjoyed hosting meals and playing games of bridge with her close friends, and she was known as a good storyteller. She was an avid equestrian, often going horseback riding outside the city. McGill's other pastimes included fishing, camping, and shooting, and in 1917 she won a prize in a women's rifle competition. For bedtime reading, she often indulged in crime fiction. During the Second World War, McGill supported the war effort by knitting wool socks for soldiers who were fighting abroad. She was a member of the Saskatchewan Medical Society, the Canadian College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Business and Professional Women's Club, and the Regina Women's Canadian Club. McGill was a member of the Anglican Church. She was Conservative in her politics, and eventually became a strong supporter of John Diefenbaker's political career as he ran for parliament and then Prime Minister. In 1958, despite serious health issues, McGill discharged herself from hospital and went home to place her vote for Diefenbaker in the federal election. She traveled extensively whenever possible, visiting New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Mexico, the West Indies and multiple European countries.  Death and legacy  After being diagnosed with breast cancer and later pleurisy, McGill died on January 21, 1959, in Winnipeg. After her cremation, her ashes were scattered by family at a favourite plot of land in Cherry Valley, Manitoba. Obituaries described McGill as \\"one of Canada's best- known criminologists\\", and an editorial in the Leader-Post reflected that McGill's extensive professional contributions and lasting relationships with friends and colleagues had earned her \\"a measure of immortality\\" surpassed by few other Canadians. McGill Lake, located north of Lake Athabasca in Saskatchewan, is named in her honour. She is a member of the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Rudolf Ising. The short was released on January 31, 1932. Summary The iris opens to two Polynesian natives, a boy and a girl, on a beach at dusk; the boy sings the title song and accompanies himself on a ukulele before switching to scatting; occasionally, the camera cuts to two older ukulelists. The island joins in the musical number: a monkey perched atop a palm tree plays cocoanuts, his drumsticks bones; a larger primate, angry at being disturbed by the percussion, emerges, but his scolding is cut short when the monkey knocks the reprehending ape out with one of the bones; another palm tree dances excitedly to the tune; on the branch of another tree, three little birds and their parent dance. The boy, again at his ukulele, ends the number after jumping onto what he believes to be a safe stretch of land but is, in fact, a crocodile; astonished, the boy leaps up and away, dropping his instrument, which falls into the great reptile's maw. Unable at first for fear to attempt the beast's mouth, the clever boy offers a sturdy stick, which the animal is all too willing to swallow: the little hero places the stick upright in the crocodile's dilated jaws and, in the resulting reprieve, reaches down his throat and fetches the lute; this done, the boy taunts his foe with a few carefree plucks of the strings. He then dances across some pond rocks, ending upon the shell-back of an unamused turtle, who carries the boy to land and curtly drops him off. The boy then skips over some more rocks to meet his sweetheart, who sits in a small boat; he fools around with his ukulele and drops it into the water. He dives down to rescue it, avoiding a rather menacing-looking fish, swimming past some smaller fish flopping melodically upon a submerged piano, and using the same instrument to entertain a disgruntled octopus, all without rising for breath! A fish-trumpeter joins in his number, as do a family of anchovies in a pair of fishing boots, a trombonist (whose instrument's slide is operated with the help of a wrecked ship's steering wheel), and another fish that may be a clarinetist. A spontaneously gathered fish-audience applaud after the performance, but the now docile cephalopod interrupts them to play a tune on the piano, scatting as he plays. The boy and the fishes clap and cheer until the great fish from a few moments ago appears again; the other sea-creatures having escaped, the boy runs to a large piece of pipe suspended in the sea-floor. Blowing into the pipe, he produces a bubble large enough to carry him: now sliding through the pipe, the boy places himself within the nascent bubble. Releasing itself from the pipe, the bubble floats to and well past the surface: high in the air, a sharp-beaked bird toys with boy and bubble for a bit, then pops it, the explosion denuding the creature of his feathers. Seeing her sweetheart falling out of the sky, the girl rows in his direction, spotting a pelican as she does so: abandoning her little ship, she boards the bird, which, having been ordered forward, catches the boy in his beak, where the hero and the girl embrace, eyes rolling affectionately, as the iris shuts.

It was concentrated in the remote regions of Uatolari and Uatocarbau. It was an anti-colonial rebellion against the Portuguese, who had been the colonial masters of East Timor since the sixteenth century. The rebellion is significant in East Timorese history because it was the only rebellion that erupted after World War II. For the longest time, due to lack of information and research, there were speculations and assumptions made about the origins of the rebellion which focus more on external factors, like the role of Indonesia. However, in the last decade, there has been more research done that has helped to illuminate this part of East Timor's history and it has also highlighted the agency of the East Timorese for participating in the rebellion.  Background  During World War II, the Axis Powers of Germany and Italy rampaged across Europe but Portugal was spared because it had declared its neutrality. Japan, who was also an Axis Power, was causing anxiety among the Dutch, Portuguese and Australian governments in Asia as they were speedily taking over colonies in parts of Southeast Asia. However, the Portuguese governor wanted East Timor to remain neutral. As a result, 400 Dutch and Australian troops were sent to East Timor in defiance of the Portuguese governor's protests of neutrality. The Australians deployed the troops as they viewed Timor as a buffer and it was imperative that the Japanese do not take over Timor. Soon enough, the Japanese landed in Dili, the capital of East Timor, on 19 February 1942. There was fierce fighting but eventually, the Japanese was able to take over the entire island. In 1945, the war finally came to an end, with the Japanese surrendering and withdrawing from the island. The effects of the war on East Timor were devastating. Dili and other villages were badly damaged due to Allied bombing, and the occupying forces. In terms of human cost, ‘Portuguese Timor suffered far worse than any other South-East Asian country occupied by the Japanese.’ The Japanese imposed forced labour and ruthless appropriation of whole harvests, which led to many Timorese dying of famine and other diseases. In short, East Timor was in shambles by the end of the war.  Political and economic context (1945 – 1959) = Politics  Unlike in other parts of Southeast Asia, the Japanese Occupation of East Timor did not spark the start of Timorese nationalism. It also did not result in many Timorese organizing anti-colonial movements or collaborating with the Japanese to achieve independence once the Japanese had triumphed over the Allies. While in other parts of Southeast Asia, the colonizers had to contend with nationalist leaders and groups fighting or negotiating for independence from them as part of this global shift towards decolonization. In East Timor, the Portuguese were doing the opposite, they were re-asserting their authority. Hence, an authoritarian type of government was re-introduced, which mirrored the Portuguese fascist government that had been in power since 1930. In 1950, as part of Portugal's desire to project a different international image, all Portuguese colonies including East Timor were no longer called colonies but ‘overseas provinces.’ The change in name did not result in a loosening of the repressive regime. As in pre-war days, the Portuguese governor was in charge of Timor but there was also a Timorese system of hierarchy where power was in the hands of the liurai (chief).  Economy  The war was a catastrophe for the East Timorese economy as infrastructure and plantations were now in ruins. To make matters worse, Portugal was economically weakened by the war in Europe. Moreover, the Marshall Plan, which was an aid programme by the United States of America (USA) to assist European countries to rebuild their economies, was not extended to Portugal. In addition, as Portugal was still a fascist state, the other Western European countries were reluctant to have any dealings with it. Due to the lack of funds from Portugal and the fact that the Timorese were too poor to be taxed, the governor had to rely on forced labour that was arranged by the liurai to rebuild roads, buildings and bridges that had been destroyed. Overall, from 1945 till 1959, the Portuguese spent most of whatever funds they were allocated on rebuilding the capital, and the rest was divided between developing the interior and the agriculture sector. The latter did see improvements that helped to avert a famine. In 1952, funds were also channelled for the first liceu (middle school), which was set up in Dili, and four years later to a vocational school that was started. In short, the Portuguese developed East Timor's economy at a ‘snail’s pace’.  Prelude to the rebellion  On 27 March 1958, a group of fourteen Indonesian men from a separatist movement known as Permesta (Total Struggle) fled from Kupang, West Timor, after being defeated by the Indonesian central government. They landed in the East Timor enclave of Oecussi and asked the Portuguese government for political asylum which was duly granted and they were sent to live in the Baucau area with a daily subsidy. After four months, four of the Indonesians were sent to Viqueque where they made friends with Jose Manuel Duarte, who was a mestizo (mixed blood) Timorese civil servant in the Weather Service. They also made friends with Amaro Loyola Jordao de Araujo, who was a Timorese retired Treasury employee. Concurrently, Luis ‘Xina’ da Costa Rego, a young Chinese-Timorese driver for the Agriculture Department based in Dili, was spearheading a growing civil servant conspiracy against the Portuguese administration. He managed to convince Antonio da Costa Soares, known as ‘Antonio Metan’, who was a descendant of the liurai Afaloicai, a kingdom in the foothills along the Baucau-Viqueque border. Luis Xina convinced Antonia Metan that there was a colony-wide plot to hold all members of the Portuguese government hostage and demand that Lisbon create a new government. For this plan to succeed, it would require the assistance of everyone in East Timor. The Viqueque plot was championed by Gerson Pello, one of the Indonesian exiles. He promised Luis Xina that there would be Indonesian support for their cause in ‘vague and grandiose terms’. This in turn influenced Luis Xina's plan. However, in late May 1959, the Dili plot was uncovered by the Portuguese who swiftly apprehended the conspirators: Luis Xina, Joao ‘Chiquito’ Pereira da Silva – a nurse from Manatuto, and Jose ‘Zeca’ de Sousa Gama of Laga on 1 June 1959. They were under arrest because they were suspected of planning a colony-wide rebellion on New Year's Eve. The Portuguese authorities also suspected that the Indonesian Consul, Nazwar Jacub, was in a leadership position in the rebellion. However, they were unable to find any evidence to connect Nazwar to the plot. Most of the evidence that was uncovered was circumstantial, for example, his mail order for a large quantity of photographic equipment, and his friendship with the Indonesian exiles. Over the next few days, the ‘overzealous’ Portuguese police commander, Sergeant Manual Da Camara arrested dozens of people. Arrests were made based on little more than the mention of a name during interrogations. Force was used to extract confessions from the accused. The suspects who were arrested came from a wide variety of backgrounds. Some were educated and working in places like the Post and Telegraph, the Indonesian Consul and the bank, and others were illiterate farmers or just unemployed friends of civil servants. The most shocking arrest was Francisco Araujo, who was a distinguished member of the Concelho do Governo (Council of Government). On the evening of 6 June, the Dili authorities alerted Administrator Artur Ramos in Viqueque to arrest Antonio Metan, as his name was mentioned during the interrogations. Artur Ramos ordered the cipaios (indigenous police) to arrest Antonio Metan. After being captured by the cipaios, Antonio Metan thought of an excuse to buy time and save his life. He told the cipaios that he needed to collect a suit from his friend's house. When they agreed to let Antonio Metan to retrieve his suit, he immediately alerted Gerson Pello and the other conspirators that the plot had been discovered by the Portuguese. At this point, the rebellion began in Viqueque.  Events of the Rebellion  On 7 June, Pello dispatched another Indonesian exile to accompany Antonio Metan back to Uatolari. As a symbolic gesture, Antonio Metan asked the chief cipaio to lower the Portuguese flag and cut the telegraph lines. At Viqueque town, the Indonesian exiles, group of civil servants and coconut plantation workers wanted to raid the district administration building to seize the weapons and use them against the Portuguese authorities. Their second objective was to hold the administrator and his family hostage. They were successful in getting the weapons but the administrator, his family and his assistant were able to escape in a jeep. When the administrator reached Ossu, he telephoned the Portuguese at Baucau and Dili to inform them about the situation at Viqueque. With the weapons they had seized, their next step was to advance to Uatocarbau to gather more supporters, then to Baguia and finally to Laga on the north coast where the Portuguese suspected they would rendezvous with their Indonesian accomplices. When the rebels reached Baguia, the Portuguese had managed to send reinforcements to Baguia in time. The Portuguese troops and a truck with a machine gun mounted on it were waiting for them. The rebels had to take over a fort but as the weapons and ammunition they had seized from the administrator's building were too antiquated, they were inadequate for the task. The rebels dispersed upon contact with the Portuguese troops by hiding in the jungle or in the mountains. Those who revealed themselves by either surrendering or fighting were killed by the Portuguese. To clear the area of the rebels, the Portuguese invited troops from the highland Makassae from Ossu and Venilale and Tetun-speakers from Viqueque town to attack Uatolari. The invaders looted everything of value, including rice, livestock and clothes. The administrator of Lautem, also invited people from Baguia, Iliomar and Lospalos to form parties to help put down the rebellion and mete out punishment. The rebellion finally ended on 14 June, estimates of the number of people who died in the rebellion vary between 160 and 1000.  Aftermath  The fifty-eight Timorese rebels who were captured by the Portuguese were exiled from East Timor. On 30 September 1959, a Portuguese-owned passenger ship called the India docked at Dili, picked up the rebels and departed on 6 October 1959. The rebels were exiled to Angola, Mozambique and Portugal. Nine out of the fourteen Indonesian exiles who were in East Timor during the rebellion were returned to Indonesia in the mid 1960s, one of them was shot dead during the rebellion and the remaining four were deported to Lisbon. In East Timor, after order had been restored, security was tightened with the Portuguese opening a branch of the Policia Internacional e da Defesa do Estado (PIDE) which was the Portuguese secret police. There were increased military and surveillance activities on Timorese both at home and abroad to ensure that subversive elements did not undermine the regime.  Debates about the origins  The origins of the rebellion have been a hotly debated topic ever since the rebellion occurred. Due to the lack of media coverage of the rebellion and first-hand accounts surrounding the rebellion, there have been speculation and assumptions made about the origins of the rebellion. From the late 1970s to mid 2000s, the debates about the origins of the rebellion were focused on the degree of involvement of Indonesia in fomenting the rebellion. In 1978, one of the first books that were written in the English language about the history of East Timor was published. It was written by Jill Jolliffe and titled East Timor: Nationalism and Colonialism. Jolliffe is unsure about the identity of the fourteen Indonesians but acknowledges that they were the main instigators of the rebellion who \\"apparently encouraged the Timorese there to attack Portuguese posts at Uatolari and Uato Carabau.\\" In 1991, John G. Taylor's book Indonesia's Forgotten War: The Hidden History of East Timor was published. Taylor identifies the fourteen Indonesians as originating from southeast Sulawesi and was involved in a regional rebellion against the Indonesian government. They were allowed to settle in East Timor by the Portuguese, thereafter, they allied themselves with local groups who were against Portuguese rule and who wanted unification of Indonesia with East Timor. The fourteen Indonesians tried to mobilize local discontent with the aim of rebuilding their base in East Timor. Furthermore, they were indisputably assisted by the Indonesian Consul in Dili and supporters in Kupang, West Timor, who agreed to supply weapons. Therefore, from Taylor's perspective, this shows that there was some level of support from the Indonesian government for the ‘integrationist lobby’ in East Timor. In 1978 there was another book written by Bill Nicol called Timor: The Stillborn Nation' which was republished in 2002 with a different title, Timor: A Nation Reborn. In the 2002 book, Nicol identifies the fourteen Indonesians as part of a movement known as Permesta from Sulawesi who were in Timor to instigate a rebellion to overthrow the Portuguese. They wanted to create an independent East Timor which could function as a base for an independence movement for eastern Indonesia. In 2006, there was a notable change in focus on what were the origins of the rebellion. That year Geoffrey C. Gunn published a book chapter titled, “Revisiting the Viqueque (East Timor) Rebellion of 1959,” “Revisiting the Viqueque (East Timor) Rebellion of 1959,” in Paulo Castrro Seixas and Aone Engelenhoven (eds.) Diversidade Cultural na Construção da Naçao e do Estado em Timor-Leste, Edições Universidade Fernado Pessoa, Porto, 2006, pp.27-58. also accessible online as an unpublished manuscript . For Gunn, the fourteen Indonesians that took part in the rebellion were part of a secessionist movement but they were not central to the fomenting of rebellion in 1959. Instead, it was the Indonesian Consul in Dili who was the mastermind. However, Gunn does not apportion all the blame on the Indonesian Consul for the rebellion, his work is also an attempt at establishing the motivations of the East Timorese in wanting to participate in the rebellion by analysing their background. In 2007, Janet Gunter wrote an article Communal Conflict in Viqueque and the ‘Charged’ History of '59, that sheds light on the role of the East Timorese in the rebellion. Gunter identifies the fourteen Indonesians as just people who were fleeing from Kupang, where the Indonesian authorities were launching a crackdown on a separatist movement. In terms of the role of these fourteen Indonesians, Gunter situates them as one of the groups of active participants; they were not the main instigators. The other groups of active participants in the rebellion were the disgruntled civil servants and minor royalty from the Uatolari and Uatocarbau subdistricts. In Gunter's article, she gives agency to the East Timorese by articulating the reasons for their involvement in the rebellion. For the disgruntled civil servants like Jose Manuel Duarte, they were unhappy that they had no opportunities for advancement in the civil service and that they were treated with disrespect. The minor royalty like Antonio Metan were motivated by perceived corruption in Uatolari. They believed the acting subdistrict head was pocketing a large share of their salaries that were being paid by the Australian firm Timor Oil, which was surveying for oil. Besides these grievances, they were also dissatisfied with issues that were affecting the ordinary Timorese like heavy taxation and a lack of schools. This shift in the debate about the origins of the rebellion can be attributed to the increasing availability of sources surrounding the rebellion as well as the context in which the writers were writing their works. When Jolliffe published her book in 1978, East Timor had been annexed by Indonesia in 1975 and was under the occupation of the Indonesians. Furthermore, there was a paucity of sources which was due to the lack of attention that the world paid to East Timor in the 1950s which resulted in few international press agencies reporting on the rebellion. Jolliffe's account relied on few sources and she made several assumptions about the role of the fourteen Indonesians without hard evidence. In 1991, when Taylor published his book, East Timor was still under Indonesian rule and it was in 1991 that the Santa Cruz massacre happened – 200 unarmed students were killed by Indonesian forces. Taylor also had the same difficulty with sources. He only relied on two questionable sources – an interview by one of the Timorese rebel leaders and an affidavit that was submitted to the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General by a leader of the pro-Indonesian party who claimed that the 1959 Viqueque rebellion was sponsored by the Indonesian government through bribes given to the Timorese. In addition, Taylor also made assumptions about the Indonesian exiles receiving help from the Indonesian Consul. By the mid 2000s, East Timor had attained independence, after the 1999 UN-sponsored referendum in 1999 allowed the Timorese to decide if they wanted to continue to be part of Indonesia or be independent. 78.5% of Timorese voted for an independent East Timor. With East Timor opening up to the world, there was greater interest in researching about East Timor's history. It was in this context that Gunn and Gunter created their works which used sources that were different from those used by Jolliffe and Taylor. Gunn and Gunter accessed the Portuguese archives and they also used colonial police documents that were compiled by PIDE agents. An important source that both used was the ‘memorandum’ by Jose Manuel Duarte in 1968 which was essentially a criticism of the entire Portuguese colonial system. Gunter went one step further by interviewing the East Timorese who witnessed the 1959 Viqueque rebellion. Therefore, Gunn and Gunter used the same sources to give a different perspective about the rebellion but both shifted the debate from the role of the Indonesians to the role of the East Timorese.  Legacy  After the rebellion was crushed, it was largely forgotten by the Portuguese authorities and considered a failure and a tragedy. When East Timor was about to become independent due to a peaceful revolution in Portugal that signaled the end of the fascist regime. There was a group of Timorese who had returned from exile that did not believe that East Timor could survive as an independent country and they did not trust the Portuguese as well. Instead they favoured Indonesian intervention in East Timor and they formed a new political party called Associacao Popular Democratica Timorense (APODETI) or Timorese Popular Democratic Association. APODETI party members saw the tremendous change that was happening in East Timor as a chance to elevate their historical importance. They began to tell their version of the 1959 Viqueque rebellion but without the Indonesian exiles and promoted some prominent individuals like Antonio Metan. All this was done to portray themselves to the Timorese that they were the first legitimate Timorese political actors, even before the formation of Frente Revolucionaria de Timor Leste Independence (Fretilin) or Revolutionary Front of Independent East Timor and Uniao Democratica Timorense (UDT) or Timorese Democratic Union. In 1975, just before the invasion, Fretilin detained some APODETI supporters and after the invasion, Fretilin leaders executed hundreds of detainees, Antonio Metan was one of them. Since then, Antonio Metan's role in the 1959 Viqueque rebellion and his pro- integration stance of 1975 was ‘retrospectively associated’. Once Indonesia had taken over East Timor, they began to use the 1959 Viqueque rebellion narrative as proof of an early movement for the integration of East Timor with Indonesia. Indonesia attempted to draw this link when in April 1999, militia leader Eurico Guterres, Anotnio Metan's nephew, created the Viqueque militia and they named the group 59/75. By doing so, they concretised the link between the rebellion and the pro-Indonesia side. However, when East Timor became fully independent in 2002 after an election which was won by Fretilin, they began to emphasize on East Timor's nationalist character and 450-year resistance to colonial rule. Fretilin associated themselves with other rebellions that had happened in East Timor's history, including the 1959 Viqueque rebellion. Hence, by doing so, Fretilin is also linking the 1959 rebellion to them by saying that they are the natural leaders of East Timor's roads towards independence. The 1959 Viqueque rebellion has been appropriated by both APODETI and Fretilin for political reasons and by doing so they have taken the rebellion out of its context. The rebellion had nothing to do with integrating with Indonesia, nor was the rebellion nationalist in character as claimed by Fretilin. Essentially, the rebellion was the result of apathy and mismanagement by the Portuguese in the post-war era that resulted in a harsh living environment that proved too much for the East Timorese. They were assisted by the fourteen Indonesian exiles that happened to be in East Timor at that time.

The action resulted in only a few casualties and was inconclusive. What was noteworthy was that the Indiamen sought out the French man-of-war and attacked it; it would have been more usual for the merchantmen to have avoided combat as they had little to gain from a battle. Background Since at least the mid-18th Century, and to a great degree even earlier, the EIC would annually dispatch a fleet of Indiamen from England to trade with India, South East Asia, and China. The vessels would generally, and particularly during wartime, stay together for mutual protection and support to the Cape of Good Hope, and then sail independently, or in smaller groups to Bombay, Madras, Bengal (Calcutta), and on. During wartime the Royal Navy would often provide warships to escort the fleet well into the Atlantic, and possibly as far as St Helena. Country ships, i.e., ships based in India, some sailing for the EIC, some independent, might join up in India with vessels going on to China, again for mutual protection against pirates, and in wartime privateers and enemy vessels. On the homeward journey, the vessels that had gone to China would return in convoy, generally stopping at St Helena to pick up escorts back to England. Frequently other vessels, such as whalers returning from the South Seas fisheries might join at St Helena too. The British vessels involved in the action of 9 September 1782, had sailed from Portsmouth on 13 March 1781, bound for Bombay and China as part of a convoy of Indiamen accompanying a British squadron under Commodore George Johnstone.Lloyd's List no. 1250 - accessed 2 August 2015 At about the same time a French squadron under the command of Bailli de Suffren left France. Both squadrons were en route to the Cape of Good Hope, the British to take it from the Dutch, the French aiming to help defend it and French possessions in the Indian Ocean, including Rodriguez Island, Ile Bourbon (Réunion), Île de France (Mauritius), and Pondicherry. The two squadrons, including the Indiamen, met in the battle of Porto Praya. Though the battle was inconclusive, it did enable the French to forestall the British attack on the Cape. The British sailed on to the Cape, where Johnstone captured five Dutch East Indiamen at the battle of Saldanha Bay. The British Indiamen then sailed on, directly, or indirectly, to India. The action On 8 August 1782 the Indiamen , , , and , and the country ship Shah Byram Gore, left Bombay, bound for China.Basset (1962). The captains were Patrick Lawson of Locko, who was the senior captain, Samuel Rodgers of Osterley, Robert Maw of Asia, Arthur Morris of Essex, and Maugham of Shah Byram Gore. As the squadron was sailing through the Strait of Malacca, on 6 September they sighted a Malay vessel at anchor by the shore near Mount Formosa (), some 40 miles southeast of Malacca. The captain of the Malay vessel reported that there was a French frigate and two brigs anchored at Pulo Pisang, and that the captain of the frigate had asked him if he had seen five ships coming from Bombay. The intelligence led Lawson to believe that the French were cruising, looking for his squadron, but did not believe themselves stronger than the Indiamen. On 9 September the ships encountered the 38-gun French frigate Pourvoyeuse, which was under the command of Lieutenant de Lannuguy-Tromelin.D'Unienville (2004), p.260.Lannuguy-Tromelin was the younger brother of Captain de Tromelin, who in 1779 had captured the previous Osterley. That evening Locko and Pourvoyeuse came quite close, but no engagement ensured. Locko did fire on and take possession of a Malay sloop that he feared the French captain had dispatched to summon the two brigs that had been reported accompanying the frigate. The engagement began at 10 minutes past 2p.m. on 10 September when Pourvoyeuse opened fire with her bow chasers. Locko, Osterley, and Shah Byram Gore were closest but withheld their fire. When Pourvoyeuse fired her broadside at Locko, Lawson responded with a broadside. The engagement lasted some two-and- a-half hours, with Locko and Osterley bearing the brunt of it. Although Asia and Essex did fire on Pourvoyeuse, Lawson tried to keep them out of the battle as felt they were weakly manned, with a large portion of their crews being lascars. Towards dusk the two opponents separated. Locko pursued Pourvoyeuse, whose two 18-pounder stern guns took away some of Lockos rigging. At about 8p.m. Pourvoyeuse extinguished her lights and steered towards Malacca. At 8:15 Lawson gave up the chase, which would have taken the squadron in the opposite direction from China, and signaled to his squadron to resume their voyage. Locko brought up the rear as they sailed so that should Pourvoyeuse wish to resume the action Locko would be the first vessel she would encounter. Outcome On the British side, Osterley had two men killed, and Locko and Essex had several men injured from exploding cartridges. Pourvoyeuse had four seamen killed, and two officers and several seamen wounded. Pourvoyeuse withdrew, sailing for Malacca where she could take shelter under the guns of the Dutch fort there. On December 26 she arrived at Trincomalee, which the French under Bailli de Suffren had captured from the British at the battle of Trincomalee on 3 September 1782, having left him and his squadron at Aceh, where they were wintering. At Trincomalee the memorist William Hickey met Trommelin. Later, Hickey described Pourvoyeuse as \\"Almost tumbling to pieces, and in want of every kind of stores.\\" The British: Lawson considered pursuing Pourvoyeuse but decided that doing so might take too long. As it was late in the sailing season, if the British vessels lost their passage to China there was no friendly port where they could winter. He lamented the lost opportunity to capture Pourvoyeuse, believing that if there had been one more hour of light he would have been able to capture her. The five British vessels sailed on to China, where they arrived safely in early October. After the return to Britain of the four captains of the Indiamen, the EIC awarded them prizes. Robert Maw received a silver salver made in 1787 by Joseph Heriot, of London, and inscribed \\"The Gift of the Hon’ble East India Company to Robert Maw Esq’r Commander of the Asia East Indiaman for gallantly defending the said ship against a French frigate of 44 guns in the Straights of Malacca September, 1782.\\" We can safely assume that Arthur Morris received a similar piece of plate. We do not know what Samuel Rogers received, or if Patrick Lawson even received anything as by 1787 he had fled Britain for India to escape a fine of £100,000 for having smuggled goods back to Britain on Locko. The French: Upon his return, Tromelin-Lanuguy suffered the scorn of Suffren, who blamed him for failing to press his attack on the East Indiamen. Suffren repeatedly accused Tromelin-Lanuguy oh \\"disgracing the flag\\", but when he offered to resign, Suffren refused.

It was bought by Samuel Fielden in 1887 and offered to the town as a public library. It remained the town's library until a new building was opened by Lancashire County Council in May 1988. Benjamin Whitworth, Samuel Fielden and the Free Library  The Institute was paid for by Benjamin Whitworth from Manchester who appears in the 1861 Census on Queens Terrace in Fleetwood as a Cotton Broker and Ship Owner. It was built on the site of the former Mechanic's Institute and played a similar role in offering a social centre for working people and a place of education and recreation. The builder was Thomas Atkinson Drummond Ramsbottom, Martin (2001), Fleetwood town trail: being a guided tour around some of the town's interesting historical sites and buildings, Hedgehog Historical Publications, p.18 whose company built a great deal of the original town of Fleetwood. Above the entrance the words 'Public Hall and Reading Room' are carved along with the year 'AD 1863'. One of the Librarians at the Institute was the dialect poet Samuel Laycock who spent a short here from 1867 before moving to Blackpool. Samuel Fielden bought the library from Whitworth in 1887 and gave it to the town on condition that the Improvement Commissioners adopted the Free Public Libraries Act. This proposal wasn't adopted immediately but after initial indecision it was accepted and the building became the Fielden Free Library. The Fielden Free Library Committee minute book, on 23 August 1887 records that, 'The chairman detailed the provisions of the Acts of Parliament which the meeting would be invited to adopt in order to carry on within the premises recently purchase by Mr Fielden'.

A Notice of Intent to Lien is formally required in nine states. In these states, notices of intent must be sent prior to the filing of a mechanics lien claim.

The following states require the sending of a Notice of Intent to Lien. * Arkansas * Colorado * Connecticut * Louisiana * Missouri * North Dakota * Pennsylvania * Wisconsin * Wyoming Sending a Notice of Intent is often helpful even if it is not required because it motivates top-of-chain parties to make payment in order to avoid facing a claim of lien.

The original structure was built in Greco Roman architecture by Napoleon III in 1855, with the architect being Louis Guerre. It is the only church that offers mass in three languages namely French, Tamil and English. Our Lady of Angels Church is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services and follows Roman Catholic sect of Christianity. The chapel was controlled by Capuchin priests, Holy Spirit Fathers subsequently and finally during 1887 changed hands to Foreign Mission Fathers from Paris. It is one of the most prominent landmarks in Puducherry and faces the Bay of Bengal. Architecture Front view of the church The church is built in Greco-Roman architecture with the main chappel with two pillars on either sides. The two pillars were originally used to house the clocks, which are not functional in modern times. Originally they used to strike every two hours with the singing of Ave Maria. The shrine faces the East facing the sea towards Bay of Bengal. The altar is originally believed to have a statue of Our Lady of Angels, but houses a Holy Cross in modern times. There is a statue of Joan of Arc donated to the church by the then Mayor of Puducherry, Goubert. The original chapel was painted white in colour both from the inside and the outside, giving the name White Chapel. A special mixture of paint, egg and limestone were used to paint the walls. The colours of the exterior were changed during 1900s and interiors during the 2000s. The bells in the temple are believed to have been procured from France. The bell had a complex mechanism with pulleys and ropes connected to a rope all the way downstairs. During 2012, after a renovation of the chapel, the operation of the bell has been suspended on account of vibrational effects causing hindrance to neighbouring structure. History Side view of the church The first arrival of the Franciscan Capuchins to India was Pondicherry in 1632. Capuchins were the very first missionaries to Pondicherry. The first mission came to an end within two years in 1634. When Francois Martin founded the city of Pondicherry in 1673, he invited the French Capuchins from Madras for the spiritual animation of the French and for the evengelization of Tamils. In 1674, the French Capuchin missionary Cosmos de Gien founded the first Christian mission in Pondicherry. The Church of the Capuchins served as the seat of the Capuchin Prefects. After 154 years of zealous missionary enterprise the Capuchin mission was handed over to the Holy Spirit Fathers in 1828. This Capuchin mission came to an end due to the shortage of missionaries in France.Based on records in National Archives in Pondicherry 1777, historian Jayasheela Stephen argues that the Capuchins, the original monks, wanted the church to be with a height of in 1746 and planned to build it close to the fort. As per the rule of the Governor of Pondicherry, no building could be built close the fort and with a height above . The proposal was rejected stating the risk and the monks withdrew the idea. Our Lady of Angels Church is the fourth oldest church in Puducherry. The original structure was built in Greco Roman architecture by Napoleon III (c. 1852-70) in 1855, with the architect being Louis Guerre. It is believed to be based on Notre-Dame in Paris and the Basilica at Lourdes. Napoleon III visited the chapel as the first place when he visited Pondicherry. It is understood that there were four churches in the campus and British demolished the church and converted it into two orphanages. It is believed that Napoleon III donated an oil painting of Our Lady of Assumption to the church. Worship practises The priests in the church were originally only French, but during modern times, Tamil people were also allowed. The chapel was controlled by Capuchin priests, Holy Spirit Fathers subsequently and finally during 1887 changed hands to Foreign Mission Fathers from Paris. The Church got its name, Kaps Kovil from Capuchin Friars , who were the founders of this church. It is the only church that offers mass in three languages namely French, Tamil and English.

From a watercolour produced soon after his death. Pope's villa was the residence of Alexander Pope at Twickenham, then a village west of London in Middlesex. He moved there in 1719 and created gardens and an underground grotto. The house and grotto were topics of 18th- and 19th-century poetry and art. In about 1845, a neo-Tudor house known as Pope's Villa was built on approximately the same site; it has been used as a school since the early 20th century. Pope's Grotto, which is listed Grade II* by Historic England, survives and is occasionally open to the public. Alexander Pope's villa Samuel Scott (c. 1759) Pope's villa at Twickenham by J. M. W. Turner (1808) Alexander Pope moved in 1719 to Twickenham, where many wealthy Londoners had houses. From Thomas Vernon, a local landowner, he leased a piece of land close to the water on a stretch of the River Thames known as Cross Deep; there were two cottages on the site and Vernon added a third. Pope demolished one cottage and part of a second and employed the architect James Gibbs to create a house in Palladian style, which became known as Pope's villa. He had it extended with a portico by William Kent in 1733. Contemporary drawings and paintings of Pope's villa show a fairly conventional classical 18th-century English country house rather than a faithful reproduction or pastiche of a Palladian villa. The house was on three floors, with a central corps de logis of three bays under a hipped roof, flanked by two lower wings of only one bay each with rooves concealed by a closed parapet. The flanking bays had ashlar quoins. The only decoration to the facade consisted of a pedimented window at the centre of the principal floor, and a stone urn at each termination of the closed parapet. An unusual feature of the facade was at its centre on the ground floor--a large elliptical arch with dominating voussoirs. The arch, flanked by small Florentine Renaissance style windows, is redolent of a water entrance to the portico of a Venetian palazzo. Bearing in mind the proximity of Pope's Villa to the River Thames, this resemblance is unlikely to be coincidental. The arch, or portal, was contained in a ground projection of the corps de logis which formed the base for the modest portico, more a porch; asked by Pope for his opinion of this renovation, Lord Burlington wrote that \\"my friend Kent has done all that can be, considering the place\\". Pope planted a weeping willow on the small piece of land next to the house (a tree trunk in the loggia of the grotto is said to be from this tree or another planted by him), and on about 5 acres (2 ha) across the street now also called Cross Deep, laid out one of the first picturesque gardens. According to Pope himself, the garden included \\"a Theatre, an Arcade, a Bowling Green, a Grove, and a 'What Not'\\". After receiving a licence to do so in 1720, he constructed a tunnel leading from under the house to the garden, and branching from this, a Romantic grotto. After Pope's death in 1744, the house was acquired by Sir William Stanhope, who enlarged it with the addition of side wings in 1758. He also extended the garden, and built a second tunnel; what remains of this is a Grade II* listed building. Little remains of the garden, but the site was listed Grade II on 1 October 1987 and a brick gazebo is also a Grade II listed building. The house remained in Stanhope's family until 1807, when Baroness Howe of Langar (1762-1835) bought it; she had it demolished the following year and built a new house next to the site, and also removed some of the decorations from the grotto and made further changes to the garden. Baroness Howe's house was subsequently partially demolished and the remainder divided into two houses, Ryan House and River Deep. Pope's villa and its gardens and grotto were frequently mentioned in poetry and depicted in art. Beginning with Pope's own verse and continuing after his death, \\"[The house] rapidly ... established itself as the seat of the Muses, and his garden as a model of landscape design.\\" Even more numerous are pictures of the house: although the facade facing the road does not seem to have been depicted, at least 55 drawings, paintings, aquatints, engravings, etchings, and lithographs produced between 1730 and 1888 survive which show the river facade or the grotto.Morris, pp. 139-40. These began with drawings and paintings by Pope himself and his friends and continued with works he may have commissioned (a sketch of the Shell Temple by Kent and a painting by Peter Tillemans from c. 1730) and throughout much of the 19th century. Samuel Scott painted two versions of a view of Pope's villa after Stanhope's additions. When it was demolished, J. M. W. Turner, who was a neighbour, objected; his painting Pope's Villa at Twickenham mourns its loss. Pope's Grotto Plaque above Pope's Grotto Originally the grotto was intended to appear natural. In 1725 Pope wrote to his friend Edward Blount of Blagdon, Paignton in Devon: > I have put the last hand to my works ... happily finishing the subterraneous > Way and Grotto: I then found a spring of the clearest water, which falls in > a perpetual Rill, that echoes thru' the Cavern day and night. ...When you > shut the Doors of this Grotto, it becomes on the instant, from a luminous > Room, a Camera Obscura, on the walls of which all the objects of the River, > Hills, Woods, and Boats, are forming a moving Picture ... And when you have > a mind to light it up, it affords you a very different Scene: it is finished > with Shells interspersed with Pieces of Looking-glass in angular Forms ... > at which when a Lamp ...is hung in the Middle, a thousand pointed Rays > glitter and are reflected over the place. He supposedly said, \\"Were it to have nymphs as well – it would be complete in everything.\\" The chamber at the west end where the spring was located has since been destroyed. In 1739 Pope visited a spa at the Avon Gorge and decided to transform the grotto to resemble a mine. For four years he redecorated it with marble, alabaster, colourful ores such as mundic and snakestones, stalactites, crystals, and diamonds from Bristol and Cornwall, much of it supplied by William Borlase, a Cornish geologist. Sir Hans Sloane gave Pope two \\"joints\\" of basalt from the Giant's Causeway, one of which is still in the grotto. He also received a stalagmite from Wookey Hole, giving rise to a false rumour which has persisted into the 21st century that he hired locals to shoot stalactites from the roof of the Witches' Cavern. After Pope's death in 1744, the grotto was popular with tourists, many of whom are said to have taken part of the decoration as a souvenir. Most of the grotto survives under 20th- century buildings; it is open to the public during Twickenham's Festival Week. It was made a Grade II* listed building on 2 September 1952. It now consists of a loggia and a central room with north and south \\"chapels\\" branching from it; little survives of the rustic arcades and columns and other decoration from Pope's time, and the existing religious decorations--a carved stone in the ceiling of the loggia representing the Crown of Thorns, a shield with the Five Wounds of Christ above the arch leading to the main room and statues of the Virgin Mary and of St James of Compostella in the two \\"chapels\\"--are all believed to be 19th-century. The tunnel which led to the garden has been widened and lengthened.

It is an early example of the Airlight, the first mass-produced weather-resistant metal telephone booth, which made possible widespread installation of outdoor payphones. In 2015, it became the first phone booth on the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history Interior in October 2020 The phone booth is located on the east side of Prairie Grove, opposite the entrance to Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park on U.S. Highway 62, and in front of the Colonial Motel. It is a structure of aluminum with a satin finish, and glass window walls, with a bifold door that folds inward, topped by a red panel marked \\"TELEPHONE\\". It rests on a small concrete pad, with the door facing the highway, and measures about in height, and in width and depth at its base. It is slightly larger at the top, with an aluminum roof that projects slightly beyond the walls. The interior of the booth houses an aluminum shelf, above which the original telephone is mounted. A swiveling directory holder is mounted in the shelf, and there is a fluorescent light fixture mounted in the ceiling. It is an Airlight Outdoor Telephone Booth, a product introduced by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T;) in 1954 as a way to install public telephones in outdoor locations. Previously, telephones, even publicly accessible pay phones, had generally only been available indoors. This particular telephone booth was installed about 1960 by the local Prairie Grove Telephone Company, to serve visitors to the nearby motel and state park. It is the only surviving booth of the company's original four. In 2014, the phone booth was damaged by an SUV, after which the company repaired it, replacing a few of its glass panes and straightening bent metal parts. Ralph Wilcox, director of historic preservation programs for Arkansas, believes it is one of only two telephone booths of this type in the state with a working phone. It was added to the NRHP on November 9, 2015.

She died at the age of seventy-three in a fire on January 17, 1903 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She is best known for being the wife of Stephen Foster and being the inspiration for Foster's song Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair. Her archives are located in the University of Pittsburgh. Early life Jane's father, Andrew Nathan McDowell, was a well- known physician in Pittsburgh. He encouraged the first black medical student from Western Pennsylvania to apply to and attend Harvard Medical School. Dr. McDowell wrote a letter of recommendation for the student and even helped to pay for part of his tuition. Jane was three years younger than Stephen. Prior to her marriage to Stephen Foster, she was engaged to another man identified as being from Lisbon. By the summer of 1850, Stephen Foster had begun to sell his music and had become increasingly well known. Jean has not been identified as having musical interests, talents or abilities. She was called pretty, had light brown hair and according to the custom of the time it was long and \\"luxuriant\\". Jane McDowell was married Monday, July 22, 1850 by a minister from the Trinity Episcopal Church in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania to Stephen Foster, even then, the well-known composer and lyricist. Her wedding gown was noted to be beautiful and well-fitting. The wedding ceremony was described by Jane's sister to be quite strained, attributed to the couple's nervousness. Immediately after the wedding, the couple took an extended honeymoon to New York and Baltimore. They stopped in Paradise, Pennsylvania, Mercersburg, Pennsylvania and Chambersburg. Jane's mother-in-law had relatives in Chambersburg and the couple visited the while they were there. Biographers speculate that the honeymoon was really a business trip to establish business arrangements with music publishers in New York and Baltimore. Family life By September 8, 1850, the Fosters had returned to Allegheny City (now part of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and moved in with Stephen's older brother, William Barclay Foster, Jr. Jane's mother-in-law, father-in-law and brother-in-law, were also living in the home. Jane became pregnant and gave birth to their only child, Marion, born April 18, 1851. After the birth of Marion, they moved in with Jane's family for some months and then returned to the Foster home. This time in Jane's life has been identified as being quite difficult for her since she was used to having servants, a larger home and privacy. Marriage problems soon developed and the Foster family initially blamed Jane for not making Stephen happy. They later changed their view of Jane and praised her for keeping the family together despite the decline in Stephen's income and his lack of responsibility. Even though marital life was difficult, some of Stephen Foster's best songs were reflective of their first years of marriage. Jane obtained a job as a telegraph operator in Greensburg sometime after her separation from Stephen. Later years A page from Jane Foster's diary, 1871; She records that she got a new dress on Monday Jane and Stephen were married for fourteen years until he died on January 13, 1864 in New York City. They were not living together at the time and had been separated for four years—an unusual arrangement in the mid-19th century. Morrison Foster, an older brother of Stephen aided Jane and Marion after the composer's death in the arrangement of royalty payments to her from various music publishers. She married M.D. Wiley after Foster's death. Jane took her granddaughter Jessie Rose Welch into her care and raised her to adulthood. Jane created very little biographical information. Jane is remembered during the Allegheny Cemetery's \\"Doo-Dah Days\\" when visitors are given a tour past her grave. Biographies Morris Foster destroyed correspondence that would reflect poorly on the Foster family. This included almost all references to Jane. No letters or other documents that Jane wrote to Stephen or Stephen wrote to Jane survived. Archives Archival materials and Primary source material including family letters and Jane's diary are housed in the University of Pittsburgh Library System Archives Service Center. These have been digitized and are accessible remotely.

The storm originated from the monsoon trough on November 7 in the Bay of Bengal, east of India, becoming the penultimate storm of the 1995 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. Moving northwestward, the system gradually intensified while moving toward land, eventually developing an eye in the middle of the convection. Reaching peak winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as a very severe cyclonic storm on November 8, in line with intensity estimates from the American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). On November 9, the cyclone made landfall near the border of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. A typical for most November storms, the system continued to the north and dissipated over Nepal on November 11\\\\. In India, the cyclone's strong winds were accompanied by heavy rainfall and a storm surge of that inundated the coastline several hundred feet inland. Power lines, crops, and houses were damaged, and many boats were damaged, causing several nautical fatalities. The cyclone killed at least 128 people in India, with hundreds remaining unaccounted for, and damage was estimated at RS$1.1 billion (US$ 32.2 million). In neighboring Bangladesh, high waves killed 45 people after sinking or sweeping away four ships. The cyclone later spawned a rare November snowstorm across eastern Nepal, with depths reaching . The snowfall occurred without warning amid the busy mountain trekking season, and there were several avalanches and landslides across the country. One such incident killed 24 people at a lodge near Gokyo, and there were 63 deaths related to the cyclone in the country. The Nepal government launched the largest search and rescue mission in the country's history, rescuing 450 people, some of whom trapped for days in the snow. Meteorological history In early November 1995, the monsoon trough was active across the Bay of Bengal, with several associated circulations. A disturbance near the Andaman Islands became the focus of the overall system on November 6\\\\. Located south of the subtropical ridge, the system moved to the west-northwest. Based on the improved organization, the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert late on November 6, and at 00:00 UTC the next day initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 03B just west of the Andaman Islands. Six hours later, the IMD likewise classified the system as a depression. After development, the depression steadily intensified while moving through the Bay of Bengal; rounding the ridge, it accelerated and turned more to the northwest. The IMD upgraded the system to a deep depression by 12:00 UTC on November 7, and further to a cyclonic storm by 00:00 UTC on the following day. The convection, or thunderstorms, organized into a comma-like structure, which further evolved into a central dense overcast. Intensification was also aided by increased upper-level divergence or the increased upward movement of air. At 09:00 UTC on November 8, the IMD upgraded the system to a severe cyclonic storm, and six hours later to a very severe cyclonic storm. By that time, an eye had developed, described by the IMD as a \\"banding-type eye\\". As such, the agency estimated peak 3 minutes sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The minimum barometric pressure was estimated at . The JTWC estimated slightly higher 1-minute winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). Around 05:00 UTC on November 9, the cyclone made landfall at peak intensity in eastern India, near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, and close to the city of Ichchapuram. Although the IMD officially estimated peak winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), winds could have been as high as 150 km/h (95 mph), based on the damage and estimates from the Dvorak technique. After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00 UTC on November 9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November 10\\\\. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low, by which time the system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal. The circulation dissipated, although moisture and convection from the storm spread through Nepal. Impact Moving ashore eastern India, the cyclone brought strong winds, with a peak gust of 115 km/h (68 mph) at the Visakhapatnam Airport, well southwest of the landfall location. Winds in Gopalpur, Odisha were estimated at 130 km/h (80 mph). The lowest barometric pressure in India was in Kalingapatnam. The storm produced a storm surge of , which spread several hundred feet inland. In addition to the winds and surge, the cyclone dropped heavy rainfall along its path, particularly in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, peaking at over 200 mm (8 in). Along the Indian coast from Andhra Pradesh to West Bengal, 2,688 boats were damaged, accounting for 48 fishermen deaths in Visakhapatnam alone. An Indian Coast Guard ship was washed ashore near Bhubaneswar, trapping the crew inside until they were rescued. In Andhra Pradesh, the high winds damaged of power lines, affecting 12,733 electrical units. The storm damaged 27,945 houses, mostly in Orissa. In the state, the storm's high winds and rainfall wrecked stalls for a festival in Paradip, and raining out two days play of a Test cricket match in Cuttack between India and New Zealand. There was also widespread crop damage on of crop fields. In West Bengal, paddy crops, mustard trees, and potatoes were damaged. Throughout India, the cyclone killed 73 people, with 402 people missing after the storm. The International Disaster Database indicated that the storm killed 128 people and caused US$46.3 million in damage. Farther east, officials in Bangladesh evacuated residents along offshore islands, while boats were ordered to return to the coast. The storm ultimately produced winds along with heavy rainfall in the country. High seas, reaching in height, capsized a boat in the Chunkuri River and left three other boats missing, killing 45 people. The waves also flooded about of crop fields. Atypical for November, the storm continued northward and became the most intense cyclone to affect Nepal in the autumn in 50 years. The country's Department of Meteorology did not issue warnings for the storm, as no mountain trekking teams requested a forecast. As a result, many mountain climbers and guides were caught off guard, and thousands of mountaineers from around the world were in the region when the cyclone struck. When the energy from the storm spread into the Himalayan Mountains of Nepal, a process known as orographic lift occurred, whereby the moisture coalesced in mountainous regions. At elevations generally below , the precipitation resulted in of rainfall, reaching in Dhankuta. In some areas, totals were 3,000% of the average November rainfall, which is usually a dry month. At higher elevations, the precipitation caused intense snowfall, reaching up to deep in Dingboche. Gorakshep recorded of snowfall. The Khumbu region of eastern Nepal received rare snowfall, as it is normally part of a rain shadow. The village of Thame was buried for eight days until people could travel freely again; the rarity of the snowfall meant that residents did not have skis or snow shoes. By November 14, or five days after the arrival of the storm, the snow had receded. The heavy snowfall across Nepal produced landslides and avalanches, mostly on November 10 and into the following day. Near Gokyo, two avalanches combined and destroyed a lodge housing 25 mountain climbers, killing all but one; the survivor was rescued after being trapped for 40 hours. The hikers were climbing Gokyo Ri, a mountain southeast of Mount Everest. This marked the deadliest avalanche in Nepal to affect a hiking expedition. Another avalanche killed seven people in Kangchenjunga. With levels reaching as high as the roofs of houses, the heavy snowfall damaged the roofs of several buildings, including one school, and killed about 100 animals. Across the country, the storm killed 63 people, 33 of them related to avalanches, including 22 foreigners, although the Trekking Workers' Association believed the death toll was higher. Several of the deaths were the result of collapsed houses, while others were the result of people freezing to death. The Mani Rimdu festival likely prevented additional deaths, as over 1,000 residents in the hardest hit areas left for the ceremony. After the snowfall, the Nepal government coordinated the largest search and rescue mission in the country's history, utilizing helicopters to rescue 450 stranded people, encompassing an area of , before the mission was ended on November 15. Several of the rescued people required medical attention. Stranded victims had to stay in the snow for a day and a half before being spotted and rescued, and inclement weather disrupted efforts.

Yemen is a large country in the southern half of the Arabian Peninsula with several geographic regions, each with a diversity of plants and animals adapted to their own particular habitats. As well as high mountains and deserts, there is a coastal plain and long coastline. The country has links with Europe and Asia, and the continent of Africa is close at hand. The flora and fauna have influences from all these regions and the country also serves as a staging post for migratory birds. Geography Yemen is in the southern half of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. The country is divided into four geographical regions: the Tihamah or coastal plains to the west, the western highlands, the central highlands, and the Rub' al Khali, or \\"Empty Quarter\\", in the east, the largest sand desert in the world. The Tihamah forms an arid flat plain alongside the Red Sea coast. There are many lagoons here and considerable biodiversity; streams from the western highlands sink and evaporate before reaching the coast.Yemen country profile. Library of Congress: Federal Research Division (December 2006). Bridge at Shaharah in the western highlands, with terracing at top right The Sarawat Mountains (or Sarat Mountains) in Saudi Arabia extend southwards into Yemen, where they divide into two ranges. The western highlands run parallel with the Red Sea coast and to the east of them, the land slopes gently towards the Persian Gulf. These mountains receive up to of rain in places and are the wettest part of the country. Rainfall comes from southwestern monsoons and from thunderstorms in summer. For over two thousand years the steep slopes of these mountains have been terraced and intensively cropped, and little of the indigenous vegetation remains. The central highlands rise up to over and contain the highest peaks of the Arabian Peninsula. They are in the rain shadow of the western highlands but receive enough rainfall for the cultivation of irrigated wheat and barley. The Rub' al Khali desert region receives almost no rainfall. Both this range and the western highlands feature many wadis, dry watercourses which have been carved out by floods when the occasional torrential downpour occurs. These often support more vascular plants than other arid areas. Flora At high altitudes, the native flora of the western highlands is dominated by African juniper. This juniper woodland is similar to woodland in East Africa. Vachellia origena is a common leguminous tree growing in patches of woodland, in hedgerows and as individual trees on cultivated terraces in the western highlands. Shrubs such as Euryops arabicus grow here, and on southern slopes there are succulent plants such as aloes and euphorbias. At lower elevations there is a shrubby forest with species including the Abyssinian rose and the camphor bush. Lower still, below about , Acacia and myrrh are the dominant woody plants. In the Hadhramaut region of southern Yemen, wheat and millet is grown and both coconut palms and date palms are cultivated, and frankincence also grows here. The western coastal Tihama plains are irrigated for the production of citrus, bananas and dates. Figs, coffee, khat, wheat, barley and sorghum are grown on the slopes above. On the Red Sea coast there are extensive stands of white mangrove over a coastal stretch of about , with sporadic clumps elsewhere. The sandy Rub' al Khali has very little plant diversity, about 37 species of flowering plant have been recorded here, 17 of which are only found around the periphery. There are no trees here, Typical xeric plants include the dwarf shrubs Calligonum crinitum and saltbush, and several species of sedge. Fauna The critically endangered Arabian leopard About 464 species of bird have been recorded in Yemen, ten of which are endemic to the country including the Socotra buzzard, the Socotra scops owl, the Socotra cisticola, the Socotra warbler, the Socotra starling, the Socotra sunbird, the Arabian accentor, the Socotra bunting, the Socotra sparrow and the Abd al-Kuri sparrow. The cliff faces of the western highlands provide habitat for the griffon vulture, the Verreaux's eagle and the small Barbary falcon. The juniper woodlands in the west are home to the Yemen linnet, Yemen thrush, Yemen warbler and the African paradise flycatcher, and many migratory birds pass through this area twice a year. The hamadryas baboon is present in parts of the country, and there are believed to be about seventy wild Arabian leopards remaining here. A captive breeding programme is being undertaken at Taiz Zoo in the Yemeni highlands. Other mammals found in Yemen include the mountain gazelle, gray wolf, Blanford's fox, Rüppell's fox, caracal, sand cat, wildcat, common genet, striped hyena, golden jackal, honey badger, bushy- tailed mongoose, rock hyrax, desert hedgehog, Arabian shrew, golden spiny mouse, lesser Egyptian jerboa, several species of gerbils, king jird, Yemeni mouse and a number of species of bat. Snakes found in Yemen include the Egyptian cobra, the horned viper and the puff adder, as well as several species of sea snakes. There is an endemic monitor lizard (Varanus yemensis), numerous species of lizard, several geckos and the veiled chameleon. The African helmeted turtle and tortoise are found on land, and several species of sea turtle breed on the beaches. Yemen has coastlines on the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. These mostly have shallow fringing reefs where corals proliferate and a diverse invertebrate fauna. These reefs provide a spawning ground and a protective environment for the young of many species of fish. Marine mammals including whales and dolphins are found here, as are sharks and many species of fish. Sea birds proliferate along the coastline. The island of Socotra and its archipelago are also part of Yemen, about east of the Horn of Africa and south of the Arabian Peninsula. These islands have a unique flora and are fringed by coral reefs. Some seven hundred species of plant and animal are endemic to the Socotra island group.

It is specifically designed as a content marketing solution provider for mid-market and enterprise brands. It is built on globally available Google Cloud Platform infrastructure and, as a SaaS product, requires no hardware or software resources. Zesty.io also allows for collaborative website building and for users to manage multiple web properties from a single portal.  History = Pre-Zesty.io  Founders Randy Apuzzo and Andy Fleming created Zesty.io as a way to \\"meet the unique needs of businesses but also to address the changing needs of the web development community.\\" Headquartered in San Diego, Apuzzo and his team at Variable Action built Zesty.io to solve what they perceived to be a recurring problem for businesses’ web presence, which according to them was that “enterprises were either stuck with a professional website that they couldn’t control, or they had to create a do-it-yourself website that lacked the professional design and functionality essential for business growth.” After three years in private development, Zesty.io made its official debut in 2010. Early investors of Zesty.io include Andy Ballester, co-founder of GoFundMe, Taner Halicioglu, co- founder of Seed San Diego and creator of Facebook hardware infrastructure, and Dave Hagewood, CEO at Psyonix, maker of popular game publisher Rocket League. Zesty.io has also earned startup acceleration grants from Google.  2017  In December 2017, Zesty.io announced a raise of $1.5M led by ClearVision Equity Partners, a micro-cap equity firm. At that same time, Gerry Widmer became CEO of Zesty.io while founder Apuzzo transitioned into Chief Technical Officer (CTO) role. Zesty.io has raised $2.8 million in funding total. Widmer, who joined Zesty.io in 2015, was previously general manager of BlueHornet, an enterprise software-as-a-service email platform and division of then-publicly traded company Digital River.

India is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Legislation that affects people with disabilities in India includes the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, the Mental Health Care Act, 2017, the National Trust Act, 1999, and the Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992. People with disabilities in India are faced with negative social attitudes in the wider population. Prevalence The number of people with disabilities in India was stated as 21 million in the 2001 Census of India. In the 2011 census, the figure rose by 22.4% to 26.8 million. According to the 2011 census, 20.3% of people with disabilities in India have movement disabilities, 18.9% have hearing impairments, and 18.8% have visual impairments. The 2011 census additionally collected data on mental disability for the first time, and found that 5.6% of Indians with disabilities fall into that category. However, Ghai offered a higher estimate in 2002, of 70 million. The World Health Organization's World Health Survey data from 2002–2004 gave a far higher estimate that 25% of people in India have some form of disability, much higher than the world average, but WHO has acknowledged that this survey suffered from various deficiencies. A 2009 World Bank report estimated that 5-8% of India's population had a disability. Two analyses of data from a 2004 study in a rural area of Karnataka have estimated the rate of disability to be around 6.3% and the rate of mental disability specifically to be around 2.3%. Data collected in a village in Chandigarh from 2004 to 2005 found the prevalence of disability to be 4.79%. A major study published in 2018 of five sites in India found that 9.2% of children aged 2-5 and 13.6% of children aged 6-9 had at least one of seven neurodevelopmental disorders (vision impairment, epilepsy, neuromotor impairments including cerebral palsy, hearing impairment, speech and language disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disability).  Legislation =International India is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, having signed the treaty on 30 March 2007 and ratified it on 1 October 2007. National India enacted the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunity, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act in 1995 to provide recognition to the rights and special needs of the disabled in the country. It also provided for reservations for persons with disabilities in government jobs and higher educational institutions. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 replaced the earlier legislation and increased the number of recognised disabilities from seven to 21. While the 1995 legislation had reserved 3% of government jobs, the new legislation reserves 4%. Under the new legislation, all institutions of higher education run or funded by the government must reserve 5% of their spaces for enrollment for people with disabilities. The rights of persons with psychosocial disabilities are protected under the Mental Health Care Act, 2017. The Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992 created the Rehabilitation Council of India, which is tasked with training rehabilitation professionals and promoting research in rehabilitation and special education. Another law governing disability affairs in India is the National Trust for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999, or simply National Trust Act. This law created the National Trust, which is a government body that works with volunteer networks and Disabled People's Organizations and also forms local-level committees that appoint legal guardians for people with disabilities deemed to need them. Government policy Issues related to disability are addressed by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, which falls under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. The government of India has also enacted initiatives such as the Accessible India Campaign to make public spaces and transportation barrier-free for persons with disabilities. The usage of the term Divyangjan (\\"those with divine abilities\\") has been promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as an alternative to the term \\"Persons with Disability\\". However, disability rights activists called it condescending and derogatory. Social attitudes Attitudes towards disability varies considerably between regions and sub-cultures. While disabilities do not hold any universal social stigma, there are regions and sub-cultures which do not agree. In some places, people with disabilities are seen as wicked or deceitful, or as unable to progress to adulthood and dependent on charity and pity for assistance. In such scenarios, people with disabilities are often socially segregated, often as a results of ingrained cultural and religious attitudes toward disability. Intersectional aspects Most people with disabilities in India and their families are focused on survival in the context of deep poverty. India's disability rights movement, however, mainly comprises elite, middle-class activists who generally mirror the goals of the disability rights movement in Western countries. Disability in India is affected by other social divisions such as class, gender, and caste. Statistics show that women with disabilities in India are more marginalized than their male counterparts. Anita Ghai argues that Indian feminism has ignored the unique conditions of women with disabilities. In Indian cinema India's Hindi-language cinema has often reinforced negative stereotypes about people with disabilities, but more recently it has produced several films that have helped raise awareness. A recurrent theme has for a long time been that disability is a punishment for misdeeds, for instance in Jeevan Naiya (1936), Aadmi (1968), and Dhanwan (1981). Characters with mental disabilities have frequently been used as comic relief, a trend which has been criticized by Dinesh Bhugra as reinforcing social stigma. Atanu Mohapatra identifies several ways in which women with disabilities are misrepresented in Hindi films as compared to men with disabilities: they are included less frequently, they very rarely win the love of able-bodied men despite the converse often being the case, they are much less likely to become self- supporting economically, and they are not included unless they are physically attractive. The decade following 2005 has seen a shift in the representation of people with disabilities by Hindi cinema. The immediate cause for the shift appears to have been an international disability film festival in 2005 facilitated by the Ability Foundation (an Indian NGO). Black (2005) broke new ground by focusing on a female protagonist with a disability, a girl who is blind, deaf, and mute but succeeds academically after considerable struggle. Other films including Taare Zameen Par (2007) by famed actor and director Aamir Khan have explored the lives of people with dyslexia, progeria, Asperger syndrome, and amnesia, among other conditions. There were some earlier precedents to these more well-rounded portrayals, including Koshish (1972) and Sparsh (1980), which explored deafness and blindness respectively. Conversely, some recent Hindi films have continued to display ill-founded stereotypes about people with disabilities. Also some Tamil film industry movies have portrayed disabled people like the movie Deiva Thirumagal which portrays a mentally challenged father and his daughter. Sport India made its Summer Paralympic début at the 1968 Games, competed again in 1972, and then was absent until the 1984 Games. The country has participated in every edition of the Summer Games since then. It has never participated in the Winter Paralympic Games. Kanchanmala Pande, a totally blind swimmer became the first Indian swimmer ever to win gold at an IPC Para swimming world championship in Mexico in 2017.

Biography  Lü began studying at Peking University in 1981, when she was sixteen. By 1992, she had completed all of her undergraduate and post-doctorate work at the same university. Her work with giant pandas began when she was nineteen, when she became part of a long-term field study on the animals, their habitat and their genetic diversity. During her field work, she created bonds with some of the pandas, helped a sick panda eat again and also became one of the first people to go inside of a wild panda's den. She also taught herself the skill of wildlife-photography while in the field, and her pictures were featured in National Geographic in 1993 and 1995. From 1995 to 2000, she worked as a program office for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) China. At WWF, she developed programs and activities which focused on the giant panda and also on the Tibetan Autonomous Region. She also helped to open the WWF Tibet office and to raise the total annual budget for conservation focusing on the panda and Tibet. In 2002, she began to work at Conservation International (CI). Lü Zhi worked as the head of CI's China office. Lü's conservation work focuses on several large endangered species, including the giant panda, snow leopard, Przewalski's gazelle and the Tibetan brown bear. Her non-governmental organization (NGO), the Shanshui Conservation Center was founded in 2007 in order to help develop \\"community-based, grassroots solutions to conservation in western China.\\" She emphasizes the importance of community-managed nature reserves in the fight to protect species and habitats, saying that these types of models are of benefit to both animals and sustainable use of the land by people. Lü Zhi hopes to see a \\"new economic system that recognises and pays for the value of nature\\" and at Shan Shui, they model these kinds of economic systems for the larger Chinese government. In addition to research and developing community-based conservation efforts, she has also worked with the Chinese government and businesses in order to develop more environmentally- friendly legislation and practices.

He was invited to join the Hawthorn Cricket Club for the 1914/15 sub-district season. He was later selected for a sub-district colts team which played against a Rest of Victoria XI and he top scored with 48.

It was named for Loyd Harris (1883–1969), a local businessman, civic leader, and baseball booster. He was active in baseball as a player, manager, and club director since 1904. Lights were added to Harris Field in the summer of 1975, and it has hosted the NAIA World Series more than twenty times, from 1984 through 1991, and continuously since 2000. In the summer, the ballpark hosts the local American Legion teams, the Lewis-Clark Twins (AA) and Cubs (A).

It was established in 2002. Akamai acquired Janrain in January 2019. History Janrain was founded in Portland in 2002 by Larry Drebes, who is the company's chief technology officer (CTO), and former chief executive officer (CEO). The firm's name \\"references a wet January in Portland\\", and has been described as a \\"leading provider of customer profile and identity management\\". According to Forbes, Drebes recognized the value of social media in 2004 and predicted the need for users to manage their online identities. He helped create the OpenID protocol, which has been called a \\"decentralized authentication method for the new Web\\". Janrain was a founding member of the OpenID Foundation and has advocated for OpenID. As a privately held company, Janrain has grown steadily since its inception. In December 2009, Janrain raised US$3.25 million from American venture capital firms DFJ Frontier, RPM Ventures, and Anthem Venture Partners. According to TechCrunch, the firms invested in Janrain's ability to \\"effectively mass market and sell authentication systems to website publishers based on OpenID and other online identity technologies\\". The Oregonian and VentureBeat have reported that Janrain had 60 employees by mid-2011. In August 2011, the company announced a $15.5 million funding round led by Emergence Capital Partners, which was used for hiring staff and marketing. Emergence founder Brian Jacobs joined Janrain's board of directors. That month, the company had funding totaling $18.7 million from the four venture capital firms, as well as from Timothy C. Draper, and Drebes. Janrain's sales \\"more than doubled\\" in 2012, and the company expected a quicker sales growth rate for 2013. Janrain had 170 employees by January 2013. That month, the firm received $33 million in new investment, marking one of the largest venture capital rounds for an Internet company in Oregon. Funding was led by Millennium Technology Value Partners, with additional participation by DFJ Frontier and RPM Ventures, existing investors Emergence Capital and Anthem Venture Partners, plus Epic Ventures, Salesforce.com, and Split Rock Partners. Including the 2013 investment, which was more than twice the amount of any venture investment in Oregon in 2012, Janrain had raised $52–53 million, and was noted as one of the \\"best-funded young technology\\" businesses in the state. The company reportedly planned to use the money to employ salespeople and engineers, enhance its technology, add new features to its software, and enter markets outside the U.S. The Dekum Building in downtown Portland houses Janrain's headquarters In February 2013, the Austin, Texas-based company Umbel announced its partnership with Janrain to combine the former company's \\"real-time audience insights\\" technology with the latter's \\"User Management Platform, providing actionable intelligence from rich social data, in real-time\\". In December 2014, Janrain acquired the startup company Arktan for an undisclosed amount. Janrain began offering data services developed by both companies, which had worked together for \\"several years\\" before the acquisition. According to Advertising Age, Janrain had grown to 160 employees; Drebes said there would be no executive changes for Arktan's five employees. Inc. reported that Janrain earned $14.3 million in revenue in 2014, had a three-year growth rate of 294%, and employed 135 people—44 more than the previous year. In 2015, the firm expanded its international reach by building a new data center in China. In September 2015, Portland Business Journal said Janrain employed \\"around 120, most of them in Portland\\", and had raised $52.8 million to date from investors. In December 2015, the company secured an additional $27 million in their Series D funding, led by HighBar Partners. The company's headquarters are in the Dekum Building at 519 Southwest Third Avenue in downtown Portland. Janrain moved into the building in 2009, occupying the sixth floor, which it vacated and moved into three others in February 2013. (Thumbnail 13) According to Portland Business Journal, much of the office space's \\"funky\\" modern and Romanesque architecture existed previously, (Thumbnail 5). though some updates were made when the company relocated. (Thumbnail 1). The space has an open design with glass walls for offices, a game room, (Thumbnail 9). a spiral staircase connecting the two floors, and an atrium extending up to an eighth floor skylight. (Thumbnail 3) It also has quiet, private spaces for nursing mothers, telephone calls, or work rooms. Conference rooms on one floor are named after mountains in the Pacific Northwest, while those on another level are named for Portland's bridges. (Thumbnail 4) Janrain turned the basketball court on the building's fourth floor, left by the previous occupant Wieden+Kennedy, (Thumbnail 2). into a conference room and meeting space. (Thumbnail 6). Janrain is open to telecommuting, which the Portland Business Journal said is unique in Portland. (Thumbnail 8). The company has satellite offices in Frankfurt, London, and Paris. In April 2016, Jim Kaskade joined Janrain as the new CEO. He was hired in turn by Conversica in late-2019.https://www.martechadvisor.com/news/sales-enablement/conversica- names-jim-kaskade-as-chief-executive-officer/ Clients In December 2009, TechCrunch reported that Janrain's technology was being used for the websites of EMI Music, Fox News, Kmart, Sears, and Universal Music Group.

In January 2013, Avis, BBC, the British public-service television broadcaster Channel 4, Comedy Central, Financial Times Fox, Fox Networks, Mattel, NPR, the Pac-12 Conference, Philips, Samsung, and Whole Foods Market were confirmed as clients. Pfizer became a client by the end of 2014, and AMC was confirmed in September 2015. Technology RPX, a software as a service (SaaS) platform for on-site OpenID account acceptance, has been described as Janrain's \\"flagship\\" product. More than 170,000 websites were using the solution by December 2009. According to VentureBeat, \\"Janrain Engage\\" enables social sharing, \\"Janrain Capture\\" gathers and stores profile data, and allows the sharing of profiles across websites; and \\"Janrain Federate\\" enables single sign-on for websites. In 2012, the company launched a \\"one-click sharing mechanism\\" for Facebook, giving users greater control over their sharing behaviors. Janrain's services were used by more than 350,000 websites by January 2013. TechCrunch said data collected by the company's technology from user log-ins helped clients \\"provide better on-site or in-app experiences for their users\\", and that \\"These experiences could include personalized offers or promotions based on user's social demographics data. Janrain User Management Platform (JUMP) provides a single, unified view of users across multiple online properties and social identities, and includes products for social login, profile data storage, registration, and single sign-on.\\" Janrain's \\"social login\\" technology enables websites to offer registration with profiles from Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social media sites. It uses profile data, such as a user's age, gender, interests, and location, allowing marketers to target advertising messages. According to The Oregonian Mike Rogoway, Janrain \\"encourages its clients to minimize what they ask online visitors to share, at least initially, and to build trust\\". Janrain hired technology attorney Lewis Barr to serve as vice president for \\"legal and privacy matters\\", and to inform clients about the appropriate and legal collection of digital information. In June 2014, the company launched \\"Janrain User-Generated Content\\" (\\"Janrain UGC\\"); according to Adweek, the service \\"allows brands to give their fans the ability to interact, comment on, and chat about content on their sites ... [and] allowing them to easily discover friends’ activities on those sites\\" and \\"better create personalized brand experiences\\". Features include comments, activity streams, live chat, social post curation, and redesigned social sharing. The firm's \\"Social Profile Navigator\\" provides users with an overview of the data they are sharing on social media sites. Arktan, which Janrain acquired in 2014, developed technology that analyzes Facebook data and enables comments, polls, reviews, and other services. Arktan had also developed social television technology and partnered with Facebook in India to generate on-air and online graphics using data from Facebook Keyword Insights API during the 2014 Indian Premier League cricket event. Reception Inc. ranked Janrain number 264, number 455, number 723, and number 1,412 in its annual \\"Inc. 5000 Rank\\" for 2012 to 2015, respectively.

In January 2014, Janrain was named a winner of the CRM Watchlist 2014, which was compiled by Paul Greenberg for his ZDNet blog, \\"Social CRM: The Conversation\\". Greenberg said Janrain's submission was the best-written of the year. Janrain was ranked number 73 and number 252 on Deloitte's \\"Technology Fast 500\\" in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Deloitte listed the company's growth rates as 1,741% (2014) and 291% (2015). In September 2014, O.C. Tanner named Janrain one of the \\"top 10 coolest companies to work for in Portland\\", saying it \\"focuses on customer success, employee success, product awesomeness, and company success—all of which drive the collaborative culture\\".

He was placed on the disabled list at the beginning of June with a hip and back injury. On July 13, Triggs underwent season ending hip surgery. In 2017 he was 5-6 with a 4.27 ERA. On September 18, 2018, the team announced that Triggs would undergo thoracic outlet syndrome, effectively ending his season. He ended the season with a record of 3–1 in 9 starts. In 2019 with AAA Las Vegas he pitched only 2.2 innings. Triggs was designated for assignment on July 31, 2019, and released a couple of days later. San Francisco Giants On August 30, 2019, Triggs signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. He was added to the 40-man roster on August 2, 2020. That day, he made his only appearance with the team, giving up three earned runs in one-third of an inning, taking the loss against the Texas Rangers. He was designated for assignment on August 12. Boston Red Sox On August 19, 2020, Triggs was claimed off waivers by the Boston Red Sox. He was added to the team's active roster on September 2, making his Red Sox debut that day against the Atlanta Braves. On September 15, the team placed Triggs on the injured list with a right radial nerve irritation; he was activated on September 26. Overall with the 2020 Red Sox, Triggs appeared in four games (two starts), compiling an 0–1 record with 4.50 ERA and seven strikeouts in eight innings pitched.

He made his MLB debut in 2016. He played for the Puerto Rican national baseball team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic winning a silver medal. Career Lugo with the Mets in 2016 Lugo attended Parkway High School in Bossier City, Louisiana, and Centenary College of Louisiana, where he played college baseball for the Centenary Gentlemen. In three seasons with Centenary, Lugo had a 5.31 earned run average (ERA). The New York Mets selected him in the 34th round, with the 1,032nd overall selection, of the 2011 MLB draft. He signed with the Mets, receiving a $20,000 signing bonus. Lugo missed the 2012 season due to spondylolisthesis, which required spinal fusion surgery. After the procedure he was bedridden at his mother's home for three months. He returned to pitch in 2013 for the Brooklyn Cyclones of the Class A-Short Season New York–Penn League and the Savannah Sand Gnats of the Class A South Atlantic League, pitching to a 4–6 win-loss record with a 3.39 ERA in 12 games started. He pitched for the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League in 2014, and for the Binghamton Mets of the Class AA Eastern League and Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League in 2015. The Mets added him to their 40-man roster after the 2015 season. Lugo began the 2016 season with Las Vegas. The Mets promoted him to the major leagues on June 30. Lugo made his Major League debut against the Chicago Cubs on July 1, 2016, throwing two shutout innings in a victory. On August 25, Lugo recorded his first major league win and hit, throwing five shutout innings against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium before exiting with muscle cramps. Following that, Lugo became a key cog in the Mets' injury-riddled rotation, pitching to a 2.67 ERA throughout the season and finishing with a 5–2 record. Lugo would have been the second or third starter for New York in the postseason had the Mets advanced past the Wild-Card Game. Entering the 2017 season, Lugo was expected to provide depth the Mets' pitching staff. After injuries to other starters, Lugo found himself battling with Robert Gsellman for the final spot in the Opening Day starting rotation. However, Lugo himself would be diagnosed with a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching arm after competing for Puerto Rico in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. The injury would cause him to miss the first two months of the regular season. He returned to make his first start of the season for the Mets on June 11, 2017 against the Atlanta Braves, getting the win after pitching seven innings of one-run ball. On Saturday July 15, 2017 Lugo hit his first major league home run against the Colorado Rockies. On August 15, Lugo was again placed on the disabled list with an impingement in his pitching shoulder. He returned on August 27, pitching innings with 5 strikeouts in a pitch-limited start. He continued making shorter starts throughout September, finishing the season with a 7-5 record and an ERA of 4.71, with 85 strikeouts and 25 walks over innings pitched. Lugo performed very well the following season, posting a 2.66 ERA and 103 strikeouts in 54 games. He was once again effective in 2019, his first season in which he was exclusively a relief pitcher, posting a 2.70 ERA while striking out 104 batters and walking only 16 in 80 innings. World Baseball Classic 2017 Lugo chose to honor his paternal grandfather, who was Puerto Rican, by playing for the Puerto Rican national baseball team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. He was the starting pitcher against Venezuela in the first round and against United States in both the second round and the Championship Game. He won both the first and second-round games. In the Championship Game, Lugo did not have the same luck on the mound as Puerto Rico lost, 8–0. Personal life Lugo and Amanda Vogle married in January 2018. He is the son of Vicki and Ben Lugo. Seth was the punter for his high school football team, goalkeeper for soccer team, and a high jumper in track and field.
