They had offices at 5 Nassau St in New York City. During the Civil War the firm floated many millions of dollars' worth of government bonds, reviving the public credit and confidence beyond all anticipation, and aiding greatly in placing the national finances upon a firm foundation. History Harvey Fisk and Alfrederick Smith Hatch formed Fisk & Hatch on March 1, 1862, after several years in the financial industry. Acting as special agents of Jay Cooke & Co., Mr. Fisk's firm obtained within one month's time nearly $170,000,000 for the U.S. Government. In 1865-68 Mr. Fisk's firm successfully negotiated $27,855,000 worth of government subsidy bonds issued in aid of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, and placed $53,000,000 worth of bonds issued by the Central Pacific company itself. Fisk & Hatch became famous for their handling of Government bonds. They were also connected with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company, of which Collis P. Huntington was president. On May 14, 1884, Fisk & Hatch suspended payment. Two days previous, Hatch had been elected president of the New York Stock Exchange. Upon his firm's suspension he instantly resigned the office. When Fisk & Hatch failed for more than $8,000,000, in 1873, it was by reason of a debt of $2,651,000 owed the house by the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad. This also caused the failure of the Newark Savings Institution, which had kept a large amount of securities on deposit with Fisk & Hatch. The firm never resumed business, but its members did. Mr. Hatch was reinstated in the privileges of the Exchange on June 6, 1884. In March 1885 the partnership of Fisk & Hatch was dissolved, and the firm reorganized under the name of Harvey Fisk & Sons.

Little had changed since the early 1900s in the methods of building roads, however, labour costs were skyrocketing and inflation meant taxpayers dollars were buying less and less. In the same period Society was becoming increasingly more mobile creating demand for better roads and highways. The CMI group believed that many road failures were due to poor riding surface which was mainly caused by inaccuracies in the subgrade. Autograde A machine was developed that could economically implement an Automated Profile Road Building Method and would be known as the Autograde. This machine was known as either a ‚Äútrimmer-spreader‚Äù or a fine-grader. It could trim or cut off high spots of a road bed and then spread the soil across the entire width of the road profile. By its very nature it was fine-grading the base course of the new road. The Autograde used an auger with cutting teeth to perform this function. Features The Autograde could be adapted to perform many tasks including: ;Single or dual lane Trimmer-spreader Using the auger with cutting teeth, it could fine grade the road bed ;Base Reclaimer Using the auger and a conveyor belt to pick up excess material and deposit it in a truck ;Asphalt Paver Using the auger and screed to place and level asphalt on the road ;Concrete Slip for paving Using the auger and screed to place and form a concrete slab Advantages This one machine could do the same work as numerous other pieces of machinery, only more quickly and more accurately. Acquisitions CMI acquired two concrete batch plant manufacturers, Ross Co. in Texas and C.S. Johnson in Illinois.http://www.concreteproducts.com/index.php/equipment/plantequipment/5221.html Further developments CMI Went on to develop other equipment and was purchased by Terex in 2001.

In almost all regions in Portugal, it is simply called 'um caf√©' (a coffee in Portuguese) and always served in a Demitasse cup. The name bica originates from the way the coffee flows, falling from the espresso machine to the cup on the tray, an analogy with a water spring or fountain, both can also be called bica in Portuguese. History A Brasileira in 1911, before its 1920s Art Deco renovation. The A Brasileira coffeehouse was opened by Adriano Telles on 19 November 1905 at No.122 (an old shirt shop), to sell \\"genuine Brazilian coffee\\" from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, a product generally unappreciated in homes of Lisboetas of that period. In order to promote his product, Telles offered each shopper who bought a kilogram of ground coffee (for 720 r√©is) a free cup of coffee. It was the first shop to sell the \\"bica\\", a small cup of strong coffee, similar to espresso, with fresh goat milk from nearby farms. There's a belief among many (Lisbon) locals that states \\"Bica\\" as an acronym for \\"Beba isso com a√ß√∫car\\", which literally means \\"Drink this with sugar\\".

The firm was prominent in railroad financing and financed the American Locomotive Company and the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad. History In March 1885 the partnership of Fisk & Hatch was dissolved, and the firm reorganized under the name of Harvey Fisk & Sons on March 26, 1885, by Harvey Fisk in connection with his three oldest sons Harvey Edward Fisk, Charles J. Fisk, and Pliny Fisk. Alexander G. Fisk and Wilbur C. Fisk were subsequently admitted to the firm. Among early projects were financing of the American Locomotive Company, the tunnels beneath the Hudson River, and financing the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. During Grover Cleveland's first administration, Harvey Fisk & Sons sold the government over $50,000,000 in bonds. During the first two years of Benjamin Harrison's administration they sold the government an equal amount. The last sale, marking the climax of the government's purchases was for $7,000,000 of 4 percent bonds, on September 17, 1890. Pliny Fisk, son of Harvey Fisk During the last few years of the life of the senior Harvey Fisk prior to his death in December 1890, the responsibility devolved to his sons. Pliny Fisk, who inherited much of his father's ability in finance, took a leading place in the firm. Harvey Edward Fisk was a partner in the firm of Harvey Fisk & Sons before he withdrew in 1899 and formed Fisk & Robinson. George H. Robinson was a Stock Exchange member and brought up with Harvey Fisk & Sons. For forty years prior to 1919, the firm had membership in the New York Stock Exchange, but in that year membership was dropped and it was decided to deal exclusively in investment bonds. Following the stock market crash in 1929, Harvey Fisk & Sons was the first investment house to discontinue all margin accounts and confine themselves to cash business. This was done so that the firm may devote its \\"entire business and attention to investment and cash commission business.\\" A new partnership was formed in 1930 with the name of Harvey Fisk & Sons, to succeed a firm with the same name. General partners in the new firm were Frederic M. Halsey, Frank L. Scherrer. Special partners were John Aspinwall and Charles S. Eytinge. The Stock Exchange membership of the late John C. Collingwood, who was the senior partner of the former firm of Harvey Fisk & Sons, was transferred to Mr. Scherrer. Robert A. Morse became associated with Harvey Fisk & Sons, Inc., in 1940. At that time Harvey Fisk & Sons were investment bankers specializing in United States Government, State and municipal bonds. Mr. Morse originally was with Lehman Brothers in their municipal bond departments and recently had been with Otis & Co., Inc., in the same capacity.

The Lake Shore Drive Bridge is listed as a Michigan State Historic Site and is a contributing property of the Eagle River Historic District. History =Construction= Looking along the length of the bridge Originally located on the site was a Pratt through truss bridge, which by 1915 had deteriorated sufficiently to warrant replacement. The new bridge was designed by the Michigan State Highway Department under a system of standardized bridge plans provided to local communities on request.

Mani's uncle Durai exploits the helpless lower caste farmers. Mani's teacher Kavitha questions Mani's prejudices. His inner turmoil and violent consequences of his casual acts form rest of the story. Plot Privilege and prejudice have a price. Varnam is the story of seventeen-year-old Mani learning that the hard way. Unable to put up with Mani's troublesome antics, his mother sends him to his distant uncle Durai's home for his +2 studies. Mani, who had lost his father in a tragic caste related incident in their village ten years ago, wishes to seek revenge for his father's death. But, he doesn't know Velu, a lower caste person, who was responsible for his father's death. Mani understands that memory is necessary for revenge and he keeps his desire for revenge alive by repeatedly sketching his father's image. Mani's uncle Durai and his partner Rathnam own a midsize coffee estate. They use their position and money to exploit the helpless lower caste farmers. Durai takes Mani under his wings and Mani enjoys every bit of his uncle's authority. Durai also wants to marry Rathnam's sister Kavitha who happens to be Mani's teacher at school. Kavitha becomes very upset with Mani's prejudiced behavior when he humiliates a lower caste teacher in the class. To Mani's chagrin, Kavitha asks Mani to learn from Thangam, a fellow student who is also a lower caste girl. As Kavitha learns more about Mani and his sketching, she is supportive of his talent and this helps Mani to see Kavitha in a totally new light. This is the setup in which Mani's journey into adulthood starts where he is deeply influenced both by his uncle Durai and his teacher Kavitha. His inner turmoil to reconcile with his prejudices, his desire to seek revenge, his liking for Thangam and certain irrevocable and violent consequences of his seemingly casual acts form the rest of the story of this powerful action drama.

It was formerly used exclusively for freight and military transport, but passenger services were reactivated in February 2015. It links to the Nahe Valley Railway west of Heimbach (Nahe).  History  Approval was given in 1897 to build a short railway from Heimbach to Baumholder. Preparation for the railway began in 1902. In 1908 Prussia passed an act to allow the railway to be built. The railway was open on December 15, 1912. A military training area was built in Baumholder between 1937 and 1938. As a result of this, the line experienced more activity and the number of tracks at the Baumholder station was increased. The passenger service on the line was stopped on May 31, 1981. After that, this stretch was served by passenger bus, most recently as bus route 322 of the Rhein-Nahe-Nahverkehrsverbund (RNN). There is no public transit service on the weekend. One exception to this was Rheinland-Pfalz Day in 2007. On this occasion there was service from June 29, 2007 to July 1, 2007, the first time since 1981 that there had been rail services on this stretch. The railway's infrastructure was acquired by the Baumholder Municipality from DB Netz in 2006. Both the sale price of 310,000 Euro and the investment of about 1.5 Million Euro were taken on by the Rhineland-Palatinate government. The yearly operational deficit of 100,000 Euro has been covered by the main users of the line, the US Army and the Bundeswehr with a ratio of 80 to 20. Since December 10, 2006, Rheinland-Pfalz has used DB Schenker Rail for maintenance of the line.  Reactivation of services The rail authority Rheinland-Pfalz S√ºd (ZSPNV S√ºd) decided in its meeting on December 10, 2008 to reactivate the line for passenger service in December 2014. The program is being operated under the Dieselnetzes S√ºdwest and involves hourly service between Baumholder and Kirn. Stops are made in the towns of Heimbach and Ruschberg. Since 23 February 2015, the Regionalbahn RB 34 service has operated between Baumholder and Idar-Oberstein daily every hour; at peak times services are extended to Kirn.  Locomotives  At the beginning of the lines operation, the Prussian Locomotives T9, G8, and G10 were used. Later the Reichsbahn Class 50 and Class 52 were used and for passenger service the Class 38 (Prussian P8) and Class 23 were used. After that DB railbuses Class 795 and Class 798 were used for passenger traffic. After 1975 the military trains used the Diesel Locomotives Class 218 and BR 211/212. Today the DB Class 232 and Class 290 are used.

Here, the player is fighting a ghost in the real world. Spirit Camera utilizes the capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS, which acts as the game's Camera Obscura, the signature \\"weapon\\" of the Fatal Frame series. The game uses the gyro sensors and 3D cameras to create a \\"visceral\\" gaming experience. In the game's story and most minigame modes, ghosts will appear in the player's environment, and will try to attack them. The player must use the Camera Obscura's abilities to damage and defeat these spirits by photographing them with the L and R buttons. The player must turn in all directions, as spirits hit by the camera will vanish and reappear beside or behind the player a few seconds later. Spirit Power, used for extra damage, can be charged by keeping the spirit within the camera reticle to charge the meter.

He is apparently search for leads on the rumored Diary of Faces; he warns Yuuko to not investigate, indicating that he has already been cursed. Yuuko does not see him again. Some time later, Yuuko and her friend discuss some stories they have heard about the Diary, such as those of a masked boy, a woman who has turned into a doll, and an Old Woman with sharp needles chanting an incantation. One day, Yuuko briefly sees a person's shadow standing amongst the purple clematis flowers in the school courtyard. From the next day on, Yoriko abruptly stops coming to school. Yuuko, assuming that her friend is sick, heads to the library to do more research. There, she senses someone staring at her, and turns to catch a glimpse of Yoriko standing between the bookshelves. Yuuko rushes over to her, but Yoriko disappears, leaving behind a book with a purple cover‚Äîthe Diary of Faces. Yuuko narrates that after an undisclosed period of time, Yoriko was found, presumably with her face taken. She wonders if she dragged her friend into this, but supposes that this would have happened anyway, since no one involved with the diary can escape. In the epilogue, two unnamed students talk about the Diary, with one mentioning that the Diary has come to Yuuko. =Plot= The player, as the game's protagonist, receives the cursed \\"Diary of Faces\\" in an unmarked package. Upon seeing the first page through a dual- lensed variant of the \\"Camera Obscura\\" (the 3DS outer cameras), the player is taken into an old house. Maya encounters and stops the player from entering one of the doors, and they are brought out of the house and back into the player's world. Upon returning, Maya explains that the person beyond the door is the \\"Woman in Black\\", who takes the faces of people who become trapped by the diary. Maya and the player begin to investigate the diary, in order to discover its secrets and for Maya to regain her memory. As the two investigate, they learn about the Tokoyomi Ritual. A dark Shinto ritual, it involves sewing up a maiden's eyes and mouth, making her a spiritual vessel. To ensure that the captured spirit, be it good or evil, does not escape, the maiden must have no earthly attachments‚Äîthat is, she cannot share a single bond with other people. The last time the ritual was performed, the village it occurred in was soon engulfed by darkness. Initially, Maya believes that the Woman in Black is the maiden from the final ritual. However, after delving further in, they soon realize that the maiden was actually Maya. They discover that, through the purple diary, she had shared a sisterly bond to \\"another\\" Maya‚Äîthe Woman in Black. As a result, the ritual knocked Maya unconscious and, through their bond, \\"awakened\\" the other Maya, corrupting her. When the Woman in Black catches and takes Maya, the player uses the Camera Obscura to enter the diary to both save Maya and break the curse. After a gruelling battle, Maya breaks free of the Woman in Black. The other Maya begins to sob, begging the real Maya not to leave her again. As they saw each other as family, Maya promises her that she'll never leave her again. The diary returns the player to reality and frees the souls of the previous victims of the curse and the villagers, leaving them one last message: \\"Thank you\\". Development Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Gamesbeat thought the game lacked content.

During Tang Dynasty  It is not known when or where Xu Dexun was born.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 72. The first reference to him in historical sources was in 903, at which time he was serving under Ma Yin the military governor of Wu'an Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) and already described as a general. That year, when Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) wrote Ma to impress on Ma Yang's allegations that Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) was bullying then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang, Ma sought advice from his aides as to Yang's proposal for Ma to cut off relations with Zhu and enter into an alliance as blood brothers with Yang. Xu pointed out that, while, just as Yang accused, Zhu was morally decrepit, but at that time, Zhu had the emperor under his control, and therefore, as Ma wished to continue to support the emperor as the basis of his rule, he should not cut off relations with Zhu. Ma agreed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. Later in 903, when Cheng Rui the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) was, at Zhu's request, leading an army down the Yangtze River to try to save Du Hong the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (Ê≠¶Êòå, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), who was then under siege by Yang's general Li Shenfu, Ma sent Xu to launch a joint surprise attack on Jingnan's capital Jiangling Municipality, with Ouyang Si (), an officer under Lei Yanwei the military governor of Wuzhen Circuit (Ê≠¶Ë≤û, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan). Together, Xu and Ouyang sacked Jiangling and pillaged it of its population and wealth before withdrawing. (This led to Cheng's army's losing its morale and his subsequent defeat at Li's hands; Cheng then committed suicide.) As Xu was returning to Wu'an's capital Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan), he went through Yue Prefecture (Â≤≥Â∑û, in modern Yueyang, Hunan), which was then ruled by the prefect Deng Jinzhong () ‚Äî who was formally a subordinate of Ma's but was de facto independent. Deng held a feast for Xu, at which Xu tried to persuade him the wisdom of submitting to Ma completely. Deng agreed, and therefore took his family and followed Xu back to Tan Prefecture. Ma subsequently made Xu the prefect of Yue and Deng the prefect of Heng Prefecture (Ë°°Â∑û, in modern Hengyang, Hunan). However, in 906, Yang Xingmi's son and successor Yang Wo sent the officer Chen Zhixin () to attack Yue Prefecture; Chen expelled Xu and took Yue Prefecture for Huainan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265.  During Ma Yin's reign as Prince/King of Chu  = During Later Liang = In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu. He created Ma Yin the Prince of Chu, and thereafter Ma's territory was considered a separate state of Chu, as a vassal of Later Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Later in 907, Yang Wo (who had refused to recognize Later Liang and whose domain now formed a state of Hongnong) sent Liu Cun (), Chen Zhixin, and Liu Wei () to launch a large attack on Chu. Ma sent Qin Yanhui () and Huang Fan () to engage them. Qin and Huang defeated and captured Liu Cun and Chen, and Liu Wei fled, allowing Qin to recapture Yue Prefecture, where Xu apparently then returned, for later that year he was referred to as the prefect of Yue. At that time, Ma was sending Qin to attack Wuzhen in conjunction with Ni Kefu (), an officer sent by Gao Jichang the Later Liang military governor of Jingnan. Lei Yanwei's brother and successor Lei Yangong sought aid from Hongnong. Yang Wo sent the Ling Ye () and Li Rao () to try to save Lei Yangong, but Xu laid a trap for them on the way and captured them. (Without Hongnong aid reaching him, Lei would abandon his capital Lang Prefecture () and flee to Hongnong territory in 908.) Meanwhile, after the joint action, Gao stationed forces at Hankou (Êº¢Âè£, in modern Wuhan) and blocked off Ma's tributary communication route with Later Liang. Later in 908, Ma sent Xu to attack Jingnan, reaching Shatou (Ê≤ôÈ†≠, near Jiangling). Gao, in fear, sued for peace.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 910, Ma sent Yao Yanzhang to capture Ningyuan Circuit (ÂØßÈÅ†, headquartered in modern Yulin, Guangxi), and Pang Juzhao () the military governor of Ningyuan surrendered to him, allowing Chu to take control of Ningyuan. However, in 911, Liu Yan the military governor of Qinghai Circuit (Ê∏ÖÊµ∑, headquartered in Guangzhou, Guangdong) attacked Ningyuan. Ma sent Xu, with an army of soldiers from Gui Prefecture (Ê°ÇÂ∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi), to aid Yao, but even with Xu's aid, Yao judged his position at Ningyuan's capital Rong Prefecture () to be untenable, and therefore, with Xu's help, took the people and the stores at Rong and withdrew back to Chu proper, allowing Liu Yan to take Rong and Gao (È´òÂ∑û, Maoming, Guangdong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. Xu later returned to Yue Prefecture, as he was described as the prefect of Yue during an operation in 914 when the Chu officer Wang Huan () launched a surprise attack against Huang Prefecture (ÈªÉÂ∑û, in modern Wuhan) ‚Äî a part of Wuchang, ruled by Hongnong, whose state name had been changed to Wu by this point. Wang was able to capture the Wu prefect of Huang Ma Ye () and pillage Huang before withdrawing, and when Xu urged caution in case the Wu garrison at Wuchang's capital E Prefecture () would try to intercept him, Wang pointed out that the raid on Huang was carried out in surprise, such that the E garrison would not know how to react, and Wang was able to withdraw safely.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. = During Later Tang = In 927, by which time Later Liang had fallen to a new Later Tang, to which Ma Yin became a vassal, Gao Jichang (who had changed his name to Gao Jixing by this point) broke his vassal relationship with Later Tang. The Later Tang emperor Li Siyuan (Emperor Mingzong) thus sent the general Liu Xun () to attack Gao, while ordering Ma to send an army as well. Ma sent Xu Dexun but had Xu's army stop at Yue Prefecture and not advance further, and ultimately did not attack Jingnan with Liu. When Liu was forced to withdraw, Gao's domain became effectively an independent state of Jingnan (also known as Nanping).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. Later in 927, Li Siyuan created Ma the greater title of King of Chu, making Ma de jure the sovereign of his own domain. Ma thereafter structured his own government after the imperial government, and he made Xu and Yao Yanzhang his chancellors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Later in 928, Wu launched a major attack on Yue Prefecture, commanded by Miao Lin () and Wang Yanzhang (). Ma sent Xu to face them. Xu secretly sent Wang Huan with a smaller fleet to get behind the Wu fleet, and then attacked the Wu fleet from both ends. The result was a major Chu victory, and both Miao and Wang Yanzhang were captured. Subsequently, though, to try to make peace with Wu, Ma sent both Miao and Wang Yanzhang back to Wu. When sending them off at a feast, Xu, who had by this point had become concerned that Ma's sons were fighting over succession rights, made what was later viewed as a prophetic statement: Meanwhile, Gao, after breaking with Li Siyuan, submitted to Wu, and the Wu emperor Yang Pu (Yang Longyan's brother and successor) created Gao the Prince of Qin. Li Siyuan ordered Ma to attack Jingnan. Ma sent Xu and his son Ma Xifan to attack Jingnan. When the two armies met, Gao Jixing's nephew Gao Congsi () challenged Ma Xifan to single combat, but the Chu officer Liao Kuangqi () came out and engaged Gao Congsi instead, killing him. Gao Jixing then sued for peace, and Xu and Ma Xifan withdrew. Xu was said to have died not long after the Jingnan campaign, but the exact time was unknown. Xu's son Xu Keqiong would play a major divisive role in the eventual struggle between Ma's sons Ma Xi'e and Ma Xiguang, which helped to bring Chu's downfall.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 289.

It features an arcade racing style that incorporates elements of a first person shooter. It is set in a fictional world in an alternate future.  Gameplay  Metal Drift's gameplay is focused on online multiplayer. Players compete with up to 11 others in 6vs6 battles. There is one \\"Capture the Flag\\" type mode where players fight for possession of a ball which is used to score at the opponents goal. The game focuses heavily on team play, awarding points for kill assists and helping a teammate score a goal. Points are also given for kills and goals, as well as multipliers for kill streaks. During games with less than 12 human players \\"bots\\" controlled by the server will fill any remaining slots. Metal Drift features a level system to unlock new weapons and upgrades. Players start at level 0 and can progress up to level 40, with unlocks every 3 level ups. New tank skins are also unlocked as the player levels up, with a new skin at level 20 and also level 40. All CPU controlled \\"bots\\" use the default level 0 skin, and Community Leaders are granted black \\"VIP\\" skins. While being multiplayer based, Metal Drift also has a single player version against CPU controlled opponents. Singleplayer behaves exactly like multiplayer, with some extra options on game setup. The player can choose the level of difficulty as well as the number of opponents to play against. All the maps in the game are available from the start, giving new players the ability to practice on any of the different Drift Decks. Beyond singleplayer there is also support for multiplayer LAN games, allowing up to 12 people to play the game together on a private network.  Early Development  Beta access for Metal Drift started in late 2008 with the game being distributed over email to a small group of beta testers. Starting in early 2009 people interested in the game could apply for a copy on the official forums. Testing sessions were held with the developers to find bugs and flaws in the game, as well as get opinions on new or existing features. Before being officially released on Steam, there was a public beta allowing anyone who pre-purchased the game at a discounted rate to get early access.  Continued Development  Metal Drift was still actively developed 2 years after its official release. A re-release was announced on February 16, 2011.Metal Drift Re-Release from GarageGames This update fixed many critical bugs and added new tank skins to the game that could be unlocked at certain player levels. New official multiplayer servers were added to allow better gameplay to regions in Europe. Since then several updates have been released, revamping the Heads Up Display and fixing bugs. As of December 2011 a new map called Javelin is being developed for release sometime in 2012.Javelin Update from Black Jacket Studios It will be the first map featuring the Waste texture set, opposed to the Metro textures used by previous maps. Javelin will include several new features unseen on other maps such as boost pads and walls that allow players to shoot through them. Metal Drift has not received any news or updates since a time after the release of the Javelin map, and development seems to have come to a complete halt.  Distribution  Metal Drift was available only on the Steam platform when first released on October 22, 2009. In early 2011 availability spread to other online digital distribution platforms such as Direct2Drive and Desura. There are currently no physical copies of the game, with availability exclusive to digital distribution methods.  Reception  Metal Drift received generally favorable reviews, however some critics found flaws with some aspects of gameplay. Out of 8 called the leveling system an artificial handicap that is \\"A strategic disadvantage right from the beginning.\\"Drift Review from Out of Eight However, ItReviews found the tactical teamwork and varying combinations of tank setups \\"Immensely fun to play\\"Drift Review from It Reviews Dan Fedler from Gamasutra praised the use of scenes in the game, saying Metal Drift was \\"One of the most exciting and dynamic games I‚Äôve come across in months.\\"Drift from Gamasutra  References   External links  * Metal Drift.com * Official Authorized Server Hoster for Metal Drift Vehicular combat games Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Metal Drift"},{"id":"34234939","text":"Amed√©e Roy Stadium () is a baseball stadium in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

He is remembered for his political forays, as well as for the film Alluri Seetharama Raju. He was the de facto director for all the scripts written by him. He is survived by three sons and one daughter, Usha Mandava, who is deceased. Among his sons Varaprasad Tripuraneni is a film maker and a prominent BJP politician. Role in politics Maharadhi is to some degree, linked to every political party in the Telugu political frame and was instrumental in the launch of the TDP. He was the first person to come up with the idea of a regional party in A.P after which he started a campaign namely 'Telugu Tejam' as prospective title for a regional party, it consisted of a 16-point agenda which included the famous phrase \\"Telugu Valla Atma Gauravam\\" which later N.T.R used to a great extent to promote T.D.P'S political vision. Maharadhi vehemently proposed Telugu tejam to fill the then existing political vacuum and also to establish a political identity for Telugu people (ref : Marosari maranisthunna NTR and NTR punarudhaanam); later a few intellectuals joined this crusade and soon it attracted many visionaries into this movement. Maharadhi along with the few intellectuals decided that a sammohan shakti is required to counter the charisma of Indira Gandhi, hence in that process N.T.R was finally convinced to join the initiative wherein he took over the reins and finally Telugu Tejam was named as Telugu desam to fight the next electoral battle. Maharadhi also served as Andhra Pradesh Congress State Secretary when Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy was Andhra Pradesh Congress president. In this position, he was instrumental in promoting YSR in the east and west Godavari districts in Y.S Rajasekhara Reddy's early days.

Family Background Bust of Lysimachus at the Ephesus Archaeological Museum. Ptolemy was the first sonPtolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe II, Footnote 6 born to Lysimachus and Arsinoe II. Ptolemy had two younger full-blooded brothers: Lysimachus and Philip. His father Lysimachus, one of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great, was King of Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedonia.Lysimachus‚Äô article at Livius.org His paternal grandfather was Agathocles of Pella, a nobleman who was a contemporary to King Philip II of Macedon and his paternal grandmother was an unnamed woman perhaps named Arsinoe. From his father's previous marriages and from an Odrysian concubine, Ptolemy had two older paternal half-brothers: Agathocles, AlexanderPausanias 1.10.4 and two older paternal half-sisters: Eurydice, Arsinoe I and perhaps another unnamed sister who may have been the first wife of Ptolemy Keraunos.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy CeraunusPtolemaic Genealogy: Unknown wife of Ptolemy Ceraunus His mother Arsinoe II, was a Ptolemaic princess who married his father as his third wife and married him as her first husband.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe II, Footnotes 4 & 5 She was a daughter born to Ptolemy I Soter and Berenice I of EgyptPtolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe II and was a sister to the Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Ptolemy I was another of the Diadochi who later founded the Ptolemaic dynasty of Ancient Egypt and Berenice I was the great-niece of the powerful regent Antipater. Ptolemy was the namesake of his maternal grandfather and was the first grandchild born to Ptolemy I and his wife, Berenice I. Early life Coin of Arsinoe II (struck under the rule of her husband-brother Ptolemy II Philadelphus) Ptolemy was born and raised in Ephesus, which was renamed for a time Arsinoea after his mother.Arsinoe II‚Äôs article at Livius.org In 282 BC, his mother accused his half-brother Agathocles of treason and his father ordered the execution of Agathocles. After the death of his half-brother, Agathocles‚Äô cousin-wife Lysandra with their children fled to Seleucus I Nicator in Babylon. Seleucus I used this bitter dynastic succession feud as an opportunity to expand his dominions. In the Battle of Corupedium in 281 BC, Seleucus I defeated Lysimachus. Seleucus I added Asia Minor and part of Thrace to his empire. His mother only held control of the Aegean part of his father's kingdom. After the death of his father, Arsinoe II and her sons fled to Cassandreia. In order to protect, secure Arsinoe II and her son's sovereignty and his father's kingdom, Ptolemy's mother married his maternal uncle Ptolemy Keraunos, who was his mother's older paternal half-brother. Ptolemy Keraunos lived in his father's kingdom as a political exile and prior to marrying his mother had murder Seleucus I in order to gain the power of his former protector and then rushed to Lysimachia where he had himself acclaimed king by the Macedonian army. The union between Arsinoe II and Ptolemy Keraunos was purely political as they both claimed the Macedonian, Thracian thrones and by the time of Ptolemy father's death his power extended to southern Greece. Arsinoe II's marriage to her half-brother wasn't a happy one. Through his marriage to Arsinoe II, Ptolemy Keraunos‚Äô political position would be strengthened. As Ptolemy's uncle-stepfather was becoming too powerful, Arsinoe II conspired with her sons against him, while he was away on a campaign. Ptolemy Keraunos quickly retaliated by capturing Cassandreia and killing Ptolemy's brothers Lysimachus and Philip. Arsinoe II and Ptolemy were able to escape. Attempted claim of the Macedonian throne Arsinoe II fled to Egypt to Ptolemy II for protection against Ptolemy Keraunos. Ptolemy Keraunos' brief reign as King ended in 279 BC as he was captured and killed during the Gallic invasion of the Balkans led by Bolgios who conducted a series of mass raids on mainland Greece. Ptolemy by then was the oldest and only surviving son of Lysimachus.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe II, Footnote 7 As the son and heir of the great Lysimachus, he seemed to be destined to be something more than a mere regional dynast after the assassination of half-brother Agathocles.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p.100 His new position as the heir apparent as one of the great empires of the early Hellenistic period didn't last long after the deaths of his father, Lysimachus, and uncle and stepfather, Ptolemy Keraunos, which lead to the complete dissolutions of their kingdoms. In the aftermath of the death of Ptolemy Keraunos chaos was brought to the Greek mainland. In this period 279 BC-277 BC, Ptolemy Epigonos fled to the Illyrian Kingdom. With the help of their King Monunius, Ptolemy Epigonos tried unsuccessfully to recover Macedonia and again probably in 278 BC without success.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p.101 He is mentioned as one of the claimants in the period of anarchy following the reign of Sosthenes.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe II, Footnote 8 The chaos lasted until Antigonus II Gonatas defeated the Gauls in battle near Lysimachia, Thrace in 277 BC. After his victory, Antigonus II was recognised as Macedonian King and his power extended to southern Greece. Co-regency of the Ptolemaic Kingdom Coin of Ptolemy II Philadelphus and Arsinoe II. After his failed attempted to regain the Macedonian Kingdom, Ptolemy eventually went to the Ptolemaic Kingdom to live with his relatives. Ptolemy II then was married to his only remaining half-paternal sister Arsinoe I by whom he had two sons: Ptolemy III Euergetes, Lysimachus of Egypt and a daughter Berenice. At an unknown date between after 279 BC-274/3 BC, Ptolemy's mother arrived in Egypt. Probably at the instigation of Arsinoe II, charges of conspiring to assassinate Ptolemy II were soon brought against Arsinoe I.Britannica Online Encyclopedia ‚Äì Arsinoe I Ptolemy II had convicted Arsinoe I of plotting against him. He ended his marriage to Arsinoe I and divorced her. Ptolemy II had exiled Arsinoe I to Coptos in southern Egypt. Ptolemy's mother married his maternal uncle Ptolemy II where she became through marriage an Egyptian Queen. Arsinoe II died at an unknown date between July 270 BC-260 BC. Ptolemy II at some point after his mother's death, had his children legally declared as the children of Arsinoe II and had the sons of Arsinoe II legally declared as the children of Ptolemy II.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Arsinoe II, Footnote 15 Ptolemy Epigonos disappears from the historical records from the time of his failed attempt to reclaim the Macedonian throne till the death of Arsinoe II. According to surviving portraits, inscriptions, coinage and papyri, Ptolemy was made co-regent of the Ptolemaic Kingdom by Ptolemy II.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy II, Footnotes 8 & 9 There may have been several reasons why Ptolemy II made Ptolemy his co-regent: to relieve him of some of his duties; to have the remaining living child of Arsinoe II to have as a help rather than a burden and support for the Chremonidean War which began at the beginning of the co- regency. The earliest attested date for his co-regency with his maternal uncle-adopted father is from papyri dated from November 267 BC,Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy II, Footnote 8 while the last dated reference from his co- regency is September 10, 259 BC.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy II, Footnote 9 There is a possibility Ptolemy may have been betrothed to his maternal cousin- paternal niece-adopted sister Berenice.Ptolemy Genealogy: Berenice Phernophorus, Footnote 3 Ptolemy is shown as an adult on the Great Mendes Stela, where he is depicted wearing the Pharaoh‚Äôs war crown, which is suggested that Ptolemy is playing an active role in court life and later in military affairs. His portrait on the Mendes Stela is dated from 264/3 BC. The wearing of this crown reveals and gives a significant statement; as it was used as a symbol of coronation and legitimate Pharaonic succession. According to the surviving evidence, Ptolemy was to be the intended heir and successor of Ptolemy II. Revolt and rule over Telmessos In 262/261 BC, Ptolemy II sent Ptolemy to the city of Miletus in Asia Minor, to represent the Pharaoh in reporting political conditions back to him.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnote 3 The tyrant Timarchus was in charge of that city. For unknown reasons, Ptolemy with Timarchus led a revolt against Ptolemy II in 259/258 BC. It is possible that Ptolemy may have revolted against Ptolemy II because Ptolemy II may have wanted Ptolemy to hand over his command in Asia Minor to him. Ptolemy and Timarchus‚Äô revolt didn't help Ptolemy II's strategic planning in Asia Minor as in 258 BC, Timarchus was slain by the Seleucid King Antiochus II Theos during the course of the Second Syrian War which was between the Ptolemaic Kingdom and the Seleucid Empire which resulted in war losses including Miletus being captured by Antiochus II. After the revolt had ended in 258 BC, Ptolemy II could have reconciled with Ptolemy and probably may have forgiven him due to his fear of the growing power of the Seleucid Empire. Ptolemy II terminated Ptolemy's co-regency with him and made him renounce any claims he had to Egyptian throne.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnotes 3 & 4 After this occurred, Ptolemy II gave Ptolemy a city in Asia Minor called Telmessos in Lycia, to govern in his own right and establish his own dynasty. The city of Telmessos, prior to being under Ptolemaic rule was previously under the kingship of Ptolemy's late father Lysimachus, thus Ptolemy would become a client monarch and have a client kingdom to rule under the Ptolemaic Kingdom. A surviving inscription from Telmessos dated from 258 BC, reveals an arms-length accord that Ptolemy reached with the Egyptian government and indicates that Ptolemy II made Ptolemy a Ptolemaic official in the area and was given a large estate in the area by the Pharaoh.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnote 4 Ptolemy ruled as a Ptolemaic Client King of Telmessos from late 258 BC until his death in February 240 BC. Hellenistic rock-cut tombs at Telmessus In his co-regency with Ptolemy II and in particular his rule of Telmessos, Ptolemy re-established and continued the rule of the Lysimachid dynasty, which is also known as the Ptolemaic/Lysimachid dynasty in Lycia. The evidence below reveals that Ptolemy was in a semi-autonomous position typical of the Hellenistic dynasts: * He remained subordinate loyal to Ptolemy II and Ptolemy III. * He recommended a philos or friend, for honors and altered the tax burden of Telmessos. * He appeared to have caused the Telmessians to issue coinage with types borrowed from the coinages of his father Lysimachus and with a monogram (Œ†Œ§) representing his own name, and to have made other internal dispensations in Telmessian institutions without apparent reference to his Ptolemaic suzerain. He made one archon at the head of the city government instead of the previous three and making a hiereus the eponymous magistracy instead of the archons. * After he died, Ptolemy had descendants ruling over Telmessos. Ptolemy had an extraordinary degree of autonomy and was loosely under the authority of the Ptolemaic Pharaohs. Ptolemy had achieved substantial influence in Telmessos and in the surrounding local cities in the region. He established himself in Telmessos to the extent that he was mentioned in a decree honoring a certain Leimon son of Antipater, who is said to be a philos or friend of Ptolemy, which was mentioned as one of the motivating factors in the decree. Ptolemy changed the payment to the tenth of the produce on apomeira or levies on beams, grain, millet, pulse, sesame, wheat and other crops in Telmessos. He levied orchard crops and the use of pasture land, taxies typical of Ptolemaic practices in Egypt. It is unknown how much time these agricultural levies lasted for and through Ptolemy's taxation reforms he was honored with a decree. The taxation reforms for Telmessos was out of the ordinary for the citizens of the city and was a big shift from a complicated system of taxation and rents imposed by the Ptolemies that was elsewhere known in Asia Minor. Before he died in 240 BC, Ptolemy III honored Ptolemy in another decree in the city assuring the city still recognised the authority of the King in Alexandria and to Ptolemy's good care of the city. When Ptolemy died an honorific surviving inscription dedicated to him reads: Ptolemy son of Ptolemy and Arsinoe the Theoi Philadelphoi (the Sibling-loving Gods). At the death of Ptolemy, he was the last surviving child of the Diadoch Lysimachus. At an unknown date, perhaps during his co-regency with Ptolemy II or in his rule over Telmessos, Ptolemy married an unnamed Greek aristocratic woman by whom he had two sons: Lysimachus of Telmessos who later succeeded him as the second Ptolemaic client ruler of Telmessos and Epigonos of Telmessos.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnote 12 His identity The identity of Ptolemy is perhaps the most confusing and controversial of Ptolemaic genealogy. Ptolemy is also identified as the following: * Ptolemy Epigone, also known as Ptolemy the Epigone, Epigone (Epigonos) i.e. the heir, he is known from an inscription at Telmessos. The sons of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great were widely referred to as the Epigonoi or the heirs. This also reveals his succession status and relations to the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the kingdom of his late father and being the brief heir to the kingdom of his mother and his uncle Ptolemy Keraunos. * Ptolemy Nios or Ptolemy ‚Äòthe Son‚Äô,Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnote 1 which he was known during his co-regency with Ptolemy II as he was the adopted son and supposed first intended heir of Ptolemy II. * Ptolemy ‚Äòthe Brother‚Äô, refers to his relationship with Ptolemy III.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\", Footnote 10.1 * Ptolemy of Telmessos, this was his title when he ruled Telmessos.Ptolemaic Genealogy: Ptolemy \\"the Son\\" * Ptolemaios Lysimachou or simply, Ptolemy, son of Lysimachus.

It is in competition with the prevalent three-wheeled goods carriers from Bajaj Auto, Piaggio, Mahindra and Force Motors. History After the run away success of Tata Ace and Tata Super Ace, Tata Motors decided to launch a truck, the Tata Ace Zip, that would be smaller than the Ace and at the price point of the three-wheeled cargo auto rickshaws. It was to be a simple design with truck-like aggregates and was to replace the anachronistic three-wheeled cargo auto rickshaws in the Indian market. Launch and reaction Tata Motors launched the Ace Zip micro-truck in May 2010 for just under Rs 200,000. The new vehicle was positively received by the users with good initial sales figures. The Tata Ace Zip is produced in the Pantnagar plant of Tata Motors. New segment The Tata Ace Zip is marketed as a micro truck in India. Priced around at Rs 190,000, the company aims to convert three-wheeler users to four- wheelers. One of the ideas that prompted the launch of this vehicle was to develop more opportunities of self-employment in the country. Moreover, there was a need for an efficient last mile vehicle, Tata sought to find the gap in the market and released the Ace Zip. The 611 cc engine delivers a power of 11.3 hp at 3000 rpm and a torque of 3.16 kgf‚ãÖm at 1600‚Äì1800 rpm, giving tough competition to Piaggio's mini truck (three-wheeler). It has a permissible loading capacity of 600 kg. It also has a modern cabin compared to its three- wheeler rivals. It is best suited for use by villagers in carrying goods over short distances. A passenger carrier on same platform, the Tata Magic Iris, has also been launched.http://www.tatamotors.com/media/press- releases.php?id=667 archive=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045654/http://www.tatamotors.com/media/press- releases.php?id=667 Manufacturing locations The mini truck is now produced at the facility in Pantnagar, Uttarakhand and at Dharwad, Karnataka.

On 6 November 1973 he was declared a National Hero of Indonesia. Biography Di Tiro was born to Tengku Sjech Abdullah and Siti Aisyah in Tiro, Pedir, Aceh Sultanate, in 1836. Until the age of 15, he studied with his father; he then began studying with his uncle, Teungku Chik Dayah Tjut di Tiro. After studying under several more teachers, he moved to Aceh Besar and spent two years there. By day he would study Islam and by night he would join his fellows in fighting against Dutch colonials. He was eventually called home to Tiro, where he began teaching with his uncle. After several years as a teacher, di Tiro went on the hajj to Mecca. There, he met several Islamic leaders and other revolutionaries from Sumatra, Java, and Borneo; through discussions on imperialism and colonialism, di Tiro became more interested in fighting against the Dutch. One day in 1880, after di Tiro returned to Tiro, a group of guerrilla fighters came through, looking for an ulama (religious leader) to lead the fight. Di Tiro volunteered and joined the guerrillas in their base in Gunung Miram. He then traveled throughout Aceh. Every time he stopped in a town, he would deliver lectures at a mosque about holy war and how it was their duty to fight against unbelievers. At the same time, he sent letters to other ulama to call them to war, determined to have driven the Dutch out of Aceh by 1883. Soon di Tiro and the ulama had collected 6,000 soldiers to fight against the Dutch, as well as the support of the Sultan of Aceh. The Dutch, although aware of the impending rebellion, remained unaware of di Tiro's identity. Soon his troops cut communications between Dutch fortresses and established their own base in Mureu. Previous struggles in the 1870s had led the Dutch to double their numbers in Aceh. Indrapuri, Aceh Besar In May 1881, di Tiro and his troops captured the Dutch fortress in Indrapuri, sparking the Aceh War. Thiw was followed by the ones in Krueng Jreu and Gle Kameng. In response, the Dutch reinforced their fortresses in Lambaro, Aneuk Galong, and Samahani. Through 1882 and 1883, the two sides continued to fight, with the Acehnese gaining ground and taking over the island of Breuh. In early 1883, di Tiro's forces attacked the Dutch stronghold in Kutaraja (now Banda Aceh); despite failing to take the fort, they succeeded in killing the Dutch '. At the peak of the war, the Dutch controlled only of land; before the war, they had controlled nearly all of Aceh. In April 1884, the sultan was told that di Tiro was now leader of the people. In response, the sultan made a proclamation that he was still sultan; in August di Tiro himself declared that he had no intentions to be sultan. By 1885, di Tiro felt that the Dutch were ready to capitulate. As such, he sent an ultimatum to Assistant Resident Van Langen, offering peace if the Dutch would convert to Islam. Although some Dutchmen came claiming that they were willing to convert, they were later discovered to be spies. In 1888 di Tiro sent another letter; this one also received no response from the Dutch leadership. He then led more expeditions against Dutch forces, despite still being unable to enter Kutaraja. Entrance gate to Teungku Chik di Tiro Muhammad Saman's grave For several more years di Tiro led his troops against the Dutch; the attempts to spy on him led him to declare that he would not rest until all the Dutch were killed. On 21 January 1891, di Tiro was served poisoned food by the son of the leader of Sagi, whom the Dutch had offered a leadership position if he would kill di Tiro; despite being taken to Aneuk Galong fortress to be treated, di Tiro soon died. He was later buried at the family graveyard in Meureu, Aceh Besar. His struggle was continued by other Acehnese figures, including Teuku Umar, Cut Nyak Dhien, and Cut Nyak Meutia, as well as his family. Legacy On 6 November 1973, President Suharto declared di Tiro a National Hero of Indonesia through Presidential Decree number 087/TK of 1973. He has numerous streets named after him, including one of the main streets in the well-known suburb of Menteng in Jakarta. Personal life Di Tiro had five sons: Teungku Mat Amin, Teungku Mahidin, Teungku di Tungkob, Teungku di Buket, and Teungku Lambada. Through them he was the great- grandfather of Free Aceh Movement founder Hasan di Tiro.

Most species are found in shallow warm water but a few are found in higher latitudes. A colony consists of a number of zooids which bud off from a long slender stolon. Characteristics A Perophora colony consists of a system of stolons from which individual zooids arise at intervals. Each zooid has four or five rows of stigmata in the wall of the atrium, the one exception being Perophora multistigmata which has eight rows. In some cases, the five-rowed species have some stigmata extending over the first and second rows indicating that the primary number of rows is four. In Ecteinascidia, the only other genus in the family, there are always eight or more rows of stigmata, usually twelve to twenty rows. Other distinguishing characteristics are that Perophora has a horizontal gut loop with a short rectum and a testis with usually one, but up to four lobes, situated in the gut loop. In Ecteinascidia the gut loop is curved, the rectum long and the testis multi-lobed.

Carr and produced by the Paramount Aircraft Corporation. Only eight were completed before production ceased. Design and development Following the failure of Walter J. Carr's first aircraft company, the CSC Aircraft Company, Carr worked as a tester for the new Warner Scarab radial engines. Carr flew with Scarabs on a Travel Air 2000, and later cannibalized the test aircraft to produce the first Cabinaire aircraft design. The prototype Cabinaire was formed around a welded steel tube Travel Air 2000 fuselage modified for an enclosed cabin. A new center section of wing was added and Travel air wings were reinstalled onto the center sections. The biplane aircraft featured a radial engine, and conventional landing gear. The upper wing was mounted several inches above the enclosed cabin. The entire plane was fabric covered with wooden wing spars and ribs. The upscale cabin used two individual upholstered wicker seats in the front and a wicker bench seat for passengers. The interior used velor finishing, nickel plating, mohair rugs, mahogany panels and roll-down windows. Prototype #2 was made from parts of the first. Each production model differed slightly from each other with choices of engines, and landing gear and aileron improvements. Operational history In 1929, Viola Gentry and Jack Ashcroft attempted an endurance record for flight with aerial refueling in a modified Cabinaire SN#5 named The Answer. The name was chosen in response to the Army aircraft that had completed previous endurance records, the Question Mark. The aircraft had a 55-gallon cabin tank, and 21 gallon wing tanks installed for the attempt. The Answer crew was unable to refuel after the first ten hours of flight due to fog and crashed 28 June 1929, killing Ashcroft. Carr had been the original choice of co-pilot, but had to pass on the opportunity when struck with pneumonia. In 1930, a Cabinaire was entered in the 4814 mile long Ford National Reliability Air Tour, placing 15th out of 18. The same aircraft has been restored and was still flown in 2011.

The film is inspired by the 1977 book The Amityville Horror. The film was produced by The Asylum and Taut Productions. The film is written and directed by Geoff Meed and stars Tyler Shamy, Devin Clark, and Jon Kondelik, all of whom are uncredited. The tagline is \\"The family did not survive. But the recordings did.\\" It claims to be based on \\"actual found footage that documents the horrifying experiences of a family that moved into the infamous haunted house.\\" The film was universally panned by critics, and has been often cited as one of the worst horror films ever made. Plot In June 2008, the Benson family moves into 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, due to issues with their teenage daughter, Lori. Despite the disturbing history of the house where Ronald DeFeo Jr. shot and killed six members of his family in 1974, the Bensons agree to purchase the house. Upon their decision, they walk outside to find their realtor dead in their driveway. The following day, Tyler Benson witnesses one of the movers falling down the stairs, which kills him instantly. The family continues to live in the house, despite the tension growing from the unexplainable events occurring. From doors opening, to a mysterious phone appearing in the kitchen, paranormal phenomena continue to bother Tyler, while his parents refuse to believe that there is anything happening beyond their own explanation. Douglas Benson takes matters into his own hands when he decides to install CCTV cameras in the house. Young Melanie Benson attracts the attention of the family when she starts talking to her \\"imaginary friend\\" John Matthew, which leads Douglas to wonder if Lori or Tyler told Melanie about the history of the house. As the family grows more fearful of the unexplainable deaths of a close family friend and a neighbor boy who was attracted to Lori, Douglas starts to break down, using religious paraphernalia to rid the house of any spirits that reside within the house. After one month within the house, Lori, Virginia, Douglas and Tyler Benson all die in various manners. Melanie Benson is the only survivor, as she says that she has plans to stay in the house forever, along with John Matthew. The autopsy reports shown at the end of the film place emphasis on the fact that each victim was under extreme stress at the time of their death.

A Horrornews.net writer called it \\"simply just a bad movie with no offering for viewers whatsoever\\", criticizing the over-used low-budget scare tricks and its false advertising as \\"Actual found footage\\". He also described Jason Williams' performance as Doug as \\"not believable for what its trying to achieve and simply comes off as d*ck with an attitude\\", but said that \\"The military freak-out tops the icing by just making it all seem rather silly\\". Dread Central's Foywonder scored it a one out of five, concluding his review with \\"A part of me almost wonders if the only reason The Amityville Haunting even exists is because someone made a bet that they could dethrone Amityville 3D for the title of worst ‚ÄúAmityville‚Äù movie of all time. I don‚Äôt know if they succeeded here, but they sure give it a run for its money.\\" References External links * 2011 films 2011 direct-to-video films 2011 horror films 2011 independent films Amityville Horror films American films American haunted house films American supernatural horror films Direct-to-video horror films English-language films The Asylum films Found footage films Films based on horror novels Films set in 2008 ","title":"The Amityville Haunting"},{"id":"34235439","text":"Abandoned is an American Reality television series by Picture Shack Entertainment that premiered on the National Geographic Channel on August 22, 2012.

Background The Hotakis were an Afghan tribe and dynasty that ruled over parts of nowadays Afghanistan and Iranhttp://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gilzi-Afghanistan: A History from 1260 to the Present, page 78 from 1722 to 1729, after having taken advantage of the heavily declining and plagued by civil strife and royal intrigues Safavid Dynasty of Persia. The Safavids, once the arch enemy and most powerful opponent of the Ottomans, had been severely declining since the late 17th century due to incompetent rulers and civil strife. The Hotaki dynasty was founded in 1709 by Ghilzai Pashtuns of Kandahar who led a successful revolution against their Safavid suzerains. During the decline of the Safavid state, the Ottoman Empire (the rivals of the Safavids), and Russian empires, had taken advantage of Iran's decadence to annex de facto a large number of frontier districts. Folling the Afghan invasion, the Russians under Peter I immediately launched the Russo-Persian War (1722‚Äì1723), capturing and securing Iran's northwestern territories for themselves, comprising parts of Dagestan, Azerbaijan and Baku, as well as several territories in contemporary northern mainland Iran, such as Gilan and Astrabad. The Ottomans invaded from the Safavids their neighbouring west, capturing swaths of Iran's western territories. By the Treaty of Constantinople (1724), Russia and the Ottomans agreed to divide the captured regions from Iran.  War  Ashraf, posing as the rightful ruler (Shah) of Persia, demanded restitution of all the annexed territories. The Ottomans took offense at this perceived arrogance, and proceeded to sever relations with Afghanistan and open hostilities in Azerbaijan in the spring of 1726. Since one of the Ottoman's declared war aims was to restore the Safavids as a client dynasty, Ashraf's first response was to put Sultan Husayn, who was living in captivity at Isfahan, to death in the autumn of 1726. Then, after strengthening the city's fortifications, he marched out to meet Turkish troops and defeated them at Khoramabad, south of Hamadan, on 20 November 1726. The Afghan victory over a greatly superior military opponent was largely due to infiltration of the Ottoman ranks by agents provocateurs who emphasized the common Sunni faith of the Turks and the Afghans deplored the fratricidal war between them, and advocated alliance against their common enemies, the \\"heretical\\" Persians; this adroit tactic sapped the morale of the Turkish troops and procured the defection of the Kurdish cavalry. Preferring not to push onward, Ashraf opened negotiations which led to the signature of a peace treaty in October, 1727 (Treaty of Hamedan). The Afghans, having little or no earlier experience about diplomacy or ruling a nation, agreed with the treaty which confirmed Ottoman sovereignty over all the western and northwestern parts of Iran and, in return for Ashraf's abandonment of his territorial claims, gave him official recognition as Shah of Persia with rights of minting coins and sending annual pilgrimage caravans to Mecca. Aftermath The great majority of Iranians still rejected the Afghan regime as usurping since the day they invaded.Afghanistan Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments The dynasty lived under great turmoil due to bloody succession feuds and resultant waves of internal revolts that made their hold on power tenuous and exhausted the strength of the Isfahan-based central government. That paved way for the rise of the Iranian military general Nader Shah and subsequently the continued wars of the Persian Empire with their Ottoman arch rivals.

Harrison and Son 1965 and is best known for his contribution to the Arts and Crafts movement working with Ernest Gimson and Sidney Barnsley. He was heavily influenced by the writings of Rudolf Steiner.Powell, Alfred, Obituary, The Times, 7 January 1950 Early life Lupton was a pupil at Bedales School at its original location at Lindfield, West Sussex which in 1900 moved to a new permanent site near Petersfield, Hampshire. He was head boy and left in 1901. He was then apprenticed to the family engineering firm, Hathorn Davey of Leeds. He erected pumping engines in the Lea Valley around 1903-4 and worked in Germany.Powell, Oswald , Bedales Chronicle, March 1950 Arts and Crafts Lupton left Hathorn Davey in 1905 to train as an Arts and Crafts architect, cabinet maker and builder with Ernest Gimson who was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \\"the greatest of the English architect-designers\\". He spent a year in Gimson‚Äôs workshops at Daneway near Sapperton. Under Gimson's direction he prepared and built the timber bridge at Hampton Court Palace. He worked as an architect and builder in Hampshire, constructing his home and workplace in Cockshott Lane, Froxfield in 1906-7. The cottage and attached workshops is a good example of his Arts and Crafts philosophy and craftsmanship. Lupton designed and built the \\"Red House\\" in Cockshott Lane for his friend Edward Thomas, It had a separate building of which half was a study for Thomas and the rest was for his own beekeeping which gave it the name \\"The Bee House\\". A number of houses in Cockshott Lane and around Steep were either designed and built by Lupton, or built to designs by Gimson or Alfred Powell or for which he undertook the joinery. In 1913, Lupton built Sir Francis Ogilvie's house, \\"Dewdney,\\" on Shere Heath which was considered by Sir Lawrence Weaver to be about the best modern small house of its time. These buildings were of hand made brick and English oak. In 1911, Lupton commissioned and largely financed, Gimson to design the assembly hall at his old school, Bedales, as the first part of a quadrangle of buildings to include a library, laboratories and a gym. The war intervened, and only the library was built. Lupton returned to engineering during the Great War. Early in 1915 he joined up as a private serving in the Army Service Corps, ASC, \\"Ally Sloper's Cavalry\\", 3rd Heavy Repair Depot in A.S.C. Motor Transport and was subsequently promoted to captain. He was mentioned in dispatches in May 1918 for work on electro deposition of metals and, in 1919, was awarded the French Order of Agricultural Merit. A learned paper on his work was presented by his Army Service Corps superior to the Institution of Automobile Engineers in 1920.Thomas, B. H., The Institution of Automobile Engineers Proceedings, Journal, 1920, pp. 603-646 After the war Lupton resumed his work as a craftsman in wood. Gimson, who knew he was dying, had asked Lupton to finish the work he started on building the Memorial Library at Bedales School. It was being built next to the 1911 Lupton Assembly Hall and was Gimson‚Äôs last major project (1918‚Äì1919). Lupton, who was supervised by Sidney Barnsley, continued the library's construction and it was completed in 1921. It was estimated to cost ¬£7,000, but building alone cost ¬£10,946, and ¬£2,829 for oak bookshelves and other furniture. The Bedales Memorial Library, Lupton Hall and corridor is one of the few Grade I listed modern buildings in England. Lupton continued furniture making until 1925 when he passed the business to Edward Barnsley. His work is described in Michael Drury‚Äôs book, Wandering Architects: In Pursuit of an Arts and Crafts Ideal. In 1923, Edward Barnsley, furniture maker and architect and son of Sidney Barnsley, took the tenancy of the workshop and moved into the cottage in 1926. Barnsley lived and worked there as a designer craftsman until his death in 1987. Later years In 1926 he bought some hundred acres of veldt near Elgin, on the Palmiet River, 50 miles from Cape Town where he built a farmhouse, thatched it with local reed and set to work to make the most unpromising soil productive. Clearing, breaking up, ploughing in lupin, irrigating by means of wooden pipes from a great pump, put in by himself in the river below, he succeeded in growing almonds, peaches, and to some extent apples, which do not thrive in South Africa, and kept cows and poultry. In Elgin he designed a tiny church, thatched and whitewashed, for the English settlers. He built the round chancel arch with his own hands. He returned to England in 1937 and bought North Wyke Farm near North Tawton in Devon which he worked during the Second World War. In 1946-7, influenced by L. T. C. Rolt's book Narrow Boat, he joined the Inland Waterways Association and bought a narrow boat which he converted for cruising, working on it on the open canalside near Norwood while he was living in Chiswick. With his 9-year- old son as crew, a 429-mile tour of English canals occupied June and July 1947 including stops to repair the boat's diesel engine and to continue the conversion work. In 1948 he was again drawn to emigrate to Africa (this time to Southern Rhodesia), where he was engrossed in building up yet another farm when he met his death, while dealing with a bull, on 30 December 1949.

There is a sharp transition from the land to sea as opposed to that on a flat coast where the land descends gradually seawards. The height of the land on a steep coast is well above sea level. Most steep coast are rocky cliffed coasts (also called abrasion coasts), where the erosion processes of wave action result in a steep declivity. Another type of steep coast is the fjord which is formed when a glacial valley lies partially under water as a result of a rise in sea levels. In Norway, New Zealand or Alaska there are fjords whose almost vertical sides tower over 1,000 metres above the water and plunge 300 metres below it. On volcanic islands the sea can enter the caldera and the face of the volcanic pipe can form a steep coastline. The best-known example of that is Santorini in the archipelago of the Cyclades in Greeces.

Background and campaign In 1938, Republican Charles A.

That same year, Republican Earl Snell had been re-elected to a second term as Secretary of State. In 1942, Snell was ineligible for another term, and decided to challenge Sprague's re-election effort. Despite the fact that the Oregon legislature was controlled by his own party, Sprague's progressive stance on numerous issues had caused conflict with the legislature, and he had vetoed special interest legislation put forward by members of his own party. An attempted recall of Sprague had been unsuccessful, but Snell used the issue, along with accusations that Sprague's efforts to efficiently organize the state for World War II had been inadequate, to achieve a comfortable victory in the primary. In the Democratic primary, state senator Lew Wallace defeated former Oregon House speaker Howard LaTourette to win his party's nomination.

While waiting for audience with the king he learnt a commission had been issued to him and other gentlemen of the county to assist Major-General Massie, Worcester's (Royalist) governor. Berkeley escaped, took horse and fled home while the battle already raged. He was caught once by the Scots (the King's men) but managed to leave them. Early the next morning a party of Parliament horse arrived at Cotheridge and brought him and his dun colt as far as St John's Worcester where they found they held no order for what they were doing and he was allowed to return home.

Promoted to Lieutenant on 29 March 1910, he spent the years 1910‚Äì12 in training abroad. With the outbreak of the First Balkan War in October 1912, he was given command of a gunboat, with which he participated in the operations in the Ambracian Gulf, but in early November he was detached to the Aegean fleet as commander of a landing detachment, with which he fought in the battles for the capture of the islands of the eastern Aegean.

Palmer's edition was essentially the text of the third edition (1550) of Stephanus, with Palmer's changing the text only where the Revised Version had an undeniable change, thereby minimizing the departures from Stephanus even where Stephanus might have been in error; Bruce Manning Metzger, The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration (2nd ed., 1968) pages 138-139. As the text of Stephanus 1550 was the main text of F.H.A. Scrivener's edition of the Textus Receptus (most likely the revised edition of 1877; Novum Testamentum, Textus Stephanici ), to which Scrivener had appended notations of variants in modern editions such as Lachman, Tischendorf, and Tregelles. It may be that Palmer relied on Scrivener's annotations for historic precedents to variants from the Stephanus text. The 1910 edition by Alexander Souter reproduces Palmer's text.Bruce Manning Metzger, New Testament Tools and Studies (1968), p. 158; Google Books.Souter, Novvm Testamentvm Graece (Oxford 1910), . According to a booklet co-authored by Palmer, \\"Let a competent reader examine the Greek text as set forth in the Oxford edition of Archdeacon Palmer.... He will find, we believe, if he looks through the whole volume, not more than sixty-four readings in the Greek text of the Revisers which are to be found in the text of Dr. [Brooke Foss] Westcott and Dr. [Fenton John Anthony] Hort, and are not to be found in the Received Text or in the text of [Karl] Lachmann or [Constantin von] Tischendorf or [Samuel Prideaux] Tregelles.\\"The Revisers and the Greek Text of the New Testament by Two Members of the New Testament Committee (London, Macmillan, 1882) [this booklet is commonly attributed to Bishop Charles John Ellicott and Archdeacon Edwin Palmer], page 41; archive.org. No examples are provided of these 64 readings but as the likely author of this comment is Palmer, the count is probably accurate; in fact, the count might be unintentionally inflated - Palmer might have been comparing readings from the text of Westcott & Hort itself with the notations of collated variants appearing in other recent editions such as found in the marginalia of Scrivener's edition of the Textus Receptus, some of the same variants might have occurred before Westcott & Hort but were not deemed worthy of a notation in Scrivener's collation (or a similar collation) and thus were mistakenly thought by Palmer to be entirely new with Westcott & Hort.

It is one of many examples of leap week calendars, calendars which maintain synchronization with the solar year by intercalating entire weeks rather than single days. It is a modification of a previous proposal, Common-Civil- Calendar-and-Time (CCC&T;). With the Hanke‚ÄìHenry Permanent Calendar, every calendar date always falls on the same day of the week.  Features  The latest Hanke-Henry calendar While many calendar reforms aim to make the calendar more accurate, the Hanke‚ÄìHenry Permanent Calendar focuses on making the calendar perennial, so that every date falls on the same day of the week, year after year. The familiar drift of weekdays concerning dates results from the fact that the number of days in a physical year (one full orbit of Earth around the Sun, approximately 365.24 days) is not a multiple of seven. By reducing common years to 364 days (52 weeks), and adding an extra week every five or six years, the Hanke‚ÄìHenry Permanent Calendar eliminates weekday drift and synchronizes the calendar year with the seasonal change as the Earth circles the Sun. The leap week known as \\"Extra\\", occurs every year that either begins (dominical letters D, DC) or ends (D, ED) in a Thursday on the corresponding Gregorian calendar, and falls between the end of December and the beginning of January. Thus, each year always begins between December 29 and January 4 in the Gregorian calendar. This is effectively the same rule as in ISO week dates. Under the Hanke‚ÄìHenry Permanent Calendar January, February, April, May, July, August, October, and November have thirty days, while March, June, September, and December have thirty-one so that each quarter contains two 30-day months followed by one month of 31 days (30:30:31). While the Hanke‚ÄìHenry Permanent Calendar changes the length of the months, the week and days remain the same. Hanke and Henry do not offer a serious discussion of anniversaries, especially the ones commemorated on 31 January, 31 May, 31 July, 31 August, and 31 October. Their website FAQ simply recommends to either celebrate one's birthday on a random day of one's choosing or, more systematically, use the last, 30th day of that month, which makes sense for some feasts like Halloween at least. Another solution, which has been adopted with calendar reforms elsewhere, would be to apply the calendar proleptically and find the corresponding date in the original year, but this would probably have to be done for all dates, e.g. the 4th of July in 1776 (Independence Day) was a Thursday as it is in HHPC but the 14th of July in 1789 (Bastille Day) was a Tuesday, not a Sunday, and would hence need to move to the 16th day of the month. As part of the calendar proposal, time zones would be eliminated and replaced with UTC. Henry argues that his proposal will succeed where some others have failed because it keeps the weekly cycle perfectly intact and therefore respects the Fourth Commandment (Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy)The Fourth Commandment at the CCC&T; Calendar website. of Judaism and Christianity. { style=\\"text-align:right\\" - style=\\"visibility:collapse\\" !

Henry's original version had essentially the same structure given above, but inserted its leap week named \\"Newton\\" between June and July in the middle of the year. The leap rule was chosen to match the ISO week leap rule, to minimise the variation in the start of the year relative to the Gregorian calendar, whereas Robert McClenon originally proposed a simple leap rule which would result in larger astronomic variance: Years whose numbers are divisible by 5 had a leap week, but years whose numbers are divisible by 40 did not unless they are also divisible by 400. Henry had advocated transition to the calendar on 1 January 2006 as that is a year in which his calendar and the Gregorian calendar begin the year on the same day. After that date passed, he recommended dropping off 31 December 2006 to start in 2007, or dropping 30 and 31 December 2007 to start 2008. In late 2011 the calendar was revised by Johns Hopkins economist Steve Hanke by moving the leap week from the middle to the end of the year and renaming it \\"Extra\\", producing the Hanke‚ÄìHenry Permanent Calendar. The target date for universal adoption was 1 January 2017 then, but has been postponed to 2018, when the calendar design was changed in early 2016 to adopt Monday as the start of the week, quarter and year, to better comply with existing international standard ISO 8601. In 2016, web developer Black Tent Digital released the official Hanke-Henry calendar app, with capabilities to convert between Gregorian and Hanke-Henry Calendars, in order to facilitate transition to the Hanke-Henry system. It is no longer available as of March, 2018.  Comparison  The key difference between Robert McClenon's calendar proposal and Henry's modification is that the former has a simple rule for determining which years have a leap week. This rule resembles the Gregorian leap year rule and has the same cycle length. Years whose numbers are divisible by 5 have a leap week, but years whose numbers are divisible by 40 do not have a leap week unless also divisible by 400. The main drawback of this rule is that the new year varies 17 days relative to the Gregorian new year (e.g. year 1965 begins 11 days earlier than Gregorian 1965 and year 2036 begins 6 days later than Gregorian 2036), whereas Henry's rule ensures that the new year always begins within three days of the Gregorian new year. The key difference between Irv Bromberg's calendar proposal Symmetry010 and Hanke/Henry‚Äôs is the pattern of month lengths, the former putting the longer month in the middle of each quarter (30:31:30). The more ambitious Symmetry454 furthermore has every month consist of exactly 4 or 5 weeks (28:35:28). Both proposals start the week on Monday and are intended to be used with a different leap rule, resulting in a 293-year leap cycle. Other proposals, like the Pax Calendar from 1930 and the International Fixed Calendar popularized by Cotsworth and Eastman, feature a perennial calendar with 13 months of 28 days each. The former also has a leap week whereas the latter has one day at the end of each year belonging to no month or week and another in leap years.  Advantages  * The calendar itself is permanent, it does not change year to year, with the exception of the need to add a week at the end of every 5 or 6 years. * Quarters all have the same number of days simplifying financial calculations. This calendar would also have prevented Apple‚Äôs Q4 2012 reporting fiasco, where due to the odd number of weeks in a year and to ensure a consistent reporting period, Apple reported quarterly results after the usual thirteen weeks instead of the fourteen the year before due to there being a leap week in the quarter, causing many investors who did not notice the adjustment to think that Apple had been less profitable than forecast.* \\"Taking Calendar Reform Viral\\" by Steve H. Hanke, Cato Institute * With the 30:30:31 layout and not counting national holidays, the first two months of each quarter have 22 work days each and every third month (except December with leap week added) has 21 work days if Saturday and Sunday are considered the weekend off from work. The alternative 30:31:30 and 31:30:30 layouts would have greater variance. * Unlike some other reform proposals, it does not change the days of the week or names of the months. * The calendar starts on the same day every year, Monday, 1 January. (It was Sunday in earlier versions.) * As in the Gregorian calendar, Sunday to Sunday is always seven days, as is Saturday to Saturday, or Friday to Friday. Because no days are ever added outside a seven-day week, there should be no objection from religious groups concerned about weekly holy days. (In proposals that add single days outside the week, like the World Calendar, a true \\"seventh day\\" of rest or worship would drift between weekends and weekdays.) * No day is more than 5 days before or after its Gregorian namesake and nearly all days are within 4 days.  Disadvantages  * Birthdays always occur on the same day of the week every year, though many of those with weekend birthdays could see this as an advantage. * Birthdays occurring on the 53rd (leap) week would occur only once every five to six years, and such birthdays would be over five times as common as February 29 birthdays are in the Gregorian calendar. * The calendar is not as precisely aligned with the solar year as the existing Gregorian calendar and some proposed reform calendars, therefore may require continued use of more accurate astronomic calendars for certain agricultural purposes. * If it became the default calendar, all computer date-handling would have to be fixed, which will be much more complicated than the Y2K fix, although the new compatibility with ISO 8601 week dates would help. * Month lengths have been stable for over 2000 years (except for the 29th day of February), so are deeply embedded into culture. * The changed month lengths do not approximate lunar phases any better. * Months of 30 or 31 days each do not take full advantage of the perennial nature of leap week calendars, like months of 4 or 5 weeks each would do. * The leap weeks would complicate time periods counted in months. On the current calendar maximum difference in lengths of such periods is three days. On the Hanke-Henry permanent calendar it would be seven days and the exception would be longer than the norm. * The last month in each quarter has one day more than the other two (30:30:31), but if, as in ISO 8601, a week belongs to the month the majority of its days are in, then the second month has one week more than the other two (4:5:4). * Leap years are more difficult to determine than in some other proposals, with the simplest algorithm being dependent on the Gregorian calendar's weekday cycle. * Doing away with time zones would make for unfamiliar and anomalous situations: for example, noon, i.e. the natural mid-day when the sun is overhead, is vastly set apart from 12:00, the chronographical mid-day, for most places in the world. It would make travel harder as one would have to learn completely new schedules for each longitude. * The (current) name is not neutral. * Certain Holidays, like Halloween/Samhain, and events are lost.

After graduating from Goldsmiths and Guildhall School of Music and Drama, where her compositional output included scores dealing with experimental graphics, minimalism, sonic collage and visual arts improvisation, Maria won the Cornelius Cardew Prize for Composition, in 1982. Her sound world is idiosyncratic in rhythm, line and harmony, and is characterised by an interest in perception which has led her to find potentials for interaction, response, and interpretation ‚Äì such as field research at the Greenham Common anti-nuclear campaign (1986), setting up a women's radio station and street festival music in Galway with radical playwright Margaretta D'Arcy (1988), music for Didn't she do well? by Valerie Walkerdine, assessing the loss of roots of academic working class women (1990), and Home Birth ‚Äì Your Choice by Nicky Leap (1991). Commissioning bodies have included contemporary music group, Gemini, Phoenix Arts Centre, BBC Singers, Women in Music.

A total of 1,046 ballots (4,750 votes) were cast in Stanley, representing a turn-out of 75.4%, and 242 ballots (675 votes) in Camp, representing a turn-out of 85.5%. As no political parties are active in the Falklands, all the candidates stood as Independents. The Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands, Keith Padgett, acted as returning officer. It was the second election since the new Constitution came into force replacing the Legislative Council (which had existed since 1845) with the Legislative Assembly. For the first time, elected candidates would be paid a salary, rather than just expenses, and be expected to work full-time, giving up whatever jobs or business interests they may have previously held. This led to criticism from some Islanders that potential candidates had been put off from standing as they didn't want to give up their jobs. All but two members of the previous Legislative Assembly won re-election (Camp MLA Sharon Halford lost her seat and Stanley MLA Dick Sawle did not stand for re-election). Michael Poole, one of the new intake, became the first member of the islands' legislature to have been born after the Falklands War and received the highest number of votes of a candidate in the history of the islands. Campaign On 29 July 2013 the Executive Council announced that election day had been scheduled for 7 November. In preparation for the election, the Legislative Assembly was dissolved by the Governor on 26 September 2013. Nominations for candidates opened on the day of the dissolution and closed on 17 October. Eleven candidates stood in Stanley and five in Camp. Each candidate made a two-minute televised broadcast on the Falkland Islands Television Service to set out their manifestos.

He was a member of the Neuhaus family, a branch of the V√≠tkovci dynasty.  Life  His parents were John the Elder of Neuhaus and Catherine of Velhartic. Meinhard's involvement in the administration of his parents' possessions began while his father was still alive. He was also interested in the public interest and made friends with his relative . When his father died in 1417, he became a ruler of the Velhartic line of the Lords of Hradec. In 1418, he donated two altar priests to Neuhaus. Although his father has been as supporter of the Hussites, Meinhard sided with the temperate Utraquists and the Catholic nobility. After the death of King Wenceslaus in 1419, he hoped that an extensions of the rights of the Estates of Bohemia would lead to a political renewal. In 1421, his cousin died without male offspring. Meinhard inherited the Lordship of Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec (Neuhaus in German) and estates around B√≠lkov in Moravia. He moved to Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec Castle. In July 1421, during the defense of Rabi Castle, he was taken prisoner by a Hussite army led by Jan ≈Ωi≈æka and held for a while at P≈ô√≠bƒõnice Castle. During the siege of K≈ôem≈æe in 1423, ≈Ωi≈æka sent Captain Jan Hvƒõzda of Vicemilic with some troops to take Telƒç, where Zde≈àek of Sternberg acted as guardian of Meinhard's younger brothers John and Henry. Meinhard came to the rescue, with John of Guttenstein and other nobles and 3000 infantry. He defeated Jan Hvƒõzda in battle, reportedly killing 300 Taborites. On 31 October 1425, Meinhard fought at Kamenice () against a Taborite army led by Andreas Prokop and . Afterwards, the Taborites devastated several Neuhaus possessions and the city of Poƒç√°tky. In November 1426, Meinhard and Prokop agreed to a ceasefire. Around this time, Meinhard also reconciled with John of Neuhaus at Telƒç, the son of another nobleman with the same name, who legally owned half of Neuhaus. The father had been driven out of Neuhaus by Ulrich V and had fled to Telƒç. In 1427, Meinhard fought on the side of the Taborites, against the crusaders, who held their fourth crusade against the Hussites. The crusaders were defeated in the Battle of Tachov. In 1428, Meinhard arranged a meeting between the Hussite leader Prokop and King Sigismund. In 1431, Meinhard fought in the Battle of Doma≈ælice, below Her≈°tejn Castle at Kdynƒõ. The Hussites again defeated the crusaders and the willingness to negotiate a peace deal grew among both the Catholics and the moderate Utraquists. Meinhard publicly distanced himself from the Taborites and at the Diet at Kutna Hora, he demanded that educated men be sent to the Council of Basel, where they should promote the acceptance of the Four Articles of Prague. The Taborites disagreed and then besieged the Catholic city of Plze≈à, where the suffered a their final defeat in the 1434 Battle of Lipany. After King Sigismund's return to Bohemia, Meinhard with appointed colonel and Burgrave of Bohemia in 1437. He would hold the post of regent during Sigismund's absence. After Sigismund's death in December 1437, Meinhard supported the candidacy of his son Albert II as his successor. In 1438, Albert was crowned King of Bohemia. Meinhard fought on his side against the T√°bor, which had opposed Albert's election. After Albert's death in October 1439, a delegation of nobles, including Meinhard, George of Podƒõbrady, Ulrich II of Rosenberg and Hynek Pt√°ƒçek of Pirkstein offered the Bohemian crown to Duke Albert III of Bavaria, who turned the offer down. Thus, the Bohemian throne remained vacant. Albert's widow, Elizabeth of Luxembourg, claimed the throne on behalf of her son Ladislaus the Posthumous. A religious conflict broke out again, between Catholics and moderate Utraquists on one side and the strict Utraquists on the other side. The captain of the Old Bohemian Circle, George of Podƒõbrady, led the moderate Utraquists. In 1448, he captured Prague and its castle. He successfully used military pressure to have himself recognized as the new ruler of Bohemia. Meinhard was taken prisoner on 9 September 1448 in the Old Town of Prague. He was initially detained in the Old Town Hall. Later, he was taken to Podƒõbrady Castle. The office of High Burgrave of Bohemia was given to Zdenƒõk Konopi≈°≈•sk√Ω ze ≈†ternberka. Meinhard's son Ulrich (died 1453) demanded his father's release in a letter dated 20 September 1448. George of Podƒõbrady refused, and indicated the Meinhard would be tried in a court of law. Meinhard fell ill during the subsequent civil strife and was released on 1 February 1449, under the condition that he should surrender to the court when summoned. He died two days later at ≈ò√≠ƒçany, on his way to Karlstejn castle.Some sources say he was on his way home to Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec His body was taken to Jind≈ôich≈Øv Hradec, where he was buried. On 6 February 1449, the Alliance of Strakonice was formed. Its members included Henry IV of Rosenberg, Zaj√≠c of Hasenburg, John of Lichtenburg, Zdenƒõk Konopi≈°≈•sk√Ω ze ≈†ternberka, William the Younger of Ryzmberk and Zdenƒõk Kostka of Postupic. The alliance accused George of Podƒõbrady on 3 August 1450 of having poisoned Mainhard. This allegation was never proved.  Marriage and issue  Meinhard married Margaret of Walsee.

It is a lobster-like animal, up to around in length, although without claws. It is only known from 17 specimens, caught at two sites ‚Äì one at the entrance to Manila Bay in the Philippines, and one in the Timor Sea, north of Australia. Due to the small number of specimens available, little is known about the species, but it appears to live up to five years, with a short larval phase. A second species, previously included in Neoglyphea, is now placed in a separate genus, Laurentaeglyphea. Taxonomy Neoglyphea inopinata was named in 1975 by Jacques Forest and Mich√®le de Saint Laurent of the ' in Paris. It was based on a single damaged specimen that had been caught by the USFC Albatross in the Philippines in 1908, and deposited in the United States National Museum. De Saint Laurent examined the unidentified specimen while working on Thalassinidea at the Smithsonian Institution. The name Neoglyphea means \\"new Glyphea\\", while the specific epithet ' means \\"unexpected\\". A second extant species of glypheoid was originally placed in the genus Neoglyphea as Neoglyphea neocaledonica, but was later split into a separate genus, Laurentaeglyphea. Significance Until the discovery of Neoglyphea, the Glypheoidea was thought to have died out before the end of the Eocene, . They had been thought to be closely related to spiny lobsters and slipper lobsters, with which they formed the group \\"Palinura\\". Study of non-fossil specimens made it apparent that the similarities between the two groups resulted from analogy, rather than homology, and that Glypheoidea was closer to lobsters and crayfish. Glypheoidea is occasionally included within the infraorder Astacidea, but molecular analysis using the DNA of Neoglyphea and Laurentaeglyphea suggest that it is better placed as a separate infraorder, Glypheidea. Distribution Neoglyphea has been caught in two distantly separated geographical areas. The initial specimens were from a small area at the entrance to Manila Bay at depths of . Three additional specimens have been recovered from a locality in the Timor Sea (near ) at a depth of . Description The overall length of the known specimens of Neoglyphea varies from to . =Cephalothorax= The cephalothorax is almost entirely covered by a carapace, only the insertion of the eyestalks protruding slightly beyond it. A deep transverse groove, called the cervical groove, divides the anterior 40% of the carapace from the posterior 60%. At the front, the carapace bears a fairly long rostrum, which is wide at the base, giving it a triangular outline when seen from above. From the side, it is curved in a weak S-shape, bending initially upwards, and then curving slightly forwards again. The cephalothorax becomes slightly wider behind the cervical groove. The carapace, including the rostrum, is covered with forward-pointing teeth (pointed tubercles), including two rows side-by-side along the animal's midline; these rows bridge the cervical groove, but become weaker in the posterior half of the carapace. Beneath the carapace is a branchial chamber, containing 28 pairs of gills. The underside of the cephalothorax is dominated in the forward part by an unusually long epistome, which is a \\"most distinctive\\" feature of Neoglyphea. The epistome is effectively the sternite of the antennal segment, and lies between the base of the antennae and the beginning of the labrum. In Neoglyphea, it is 1.5 times longer than it is wide, and is broadly rectangular in outline. Like the carapace, it is covered in spiny tubercles, although they are smaller and straighter on the epistome. Two rows of larger spines diverge towards the rear of the epistome, leaving an area which is largely devoid of such spines. =Abdomen= The form of the abdomen of Neoglyphea is similar to that of lobsters and other long-bodied decapods. Its first segment is less than half the length of the succeeding 6 segments. The abdomen ends in a telson, which is about 1.5 times as long as the other abdominal segments, flanked by a pair of uropods. The uropods have similarly sized exopods and endopods, fringed with long hairs; the exopod is divided towards the end by a jointed diaeresis. =Appendages= Two separate eyestalks extend forwards from below the rostrum, each bearing a pigmented, movable compound eye. These are followed by two pairs of antennae. The first pair (the antennules) are biramous, with the two flagella of similar size, one of 65 segments, and one of 50 segments; the second pair are uniramous and much thicker and longer than the first pair, reaching twice the length of the carapace. The antennal glands open at the base of the second antennae. The animal's mouthparts comprise paired mandibles, maxillules, maxillae and three pairs of maxillipeds, although the third maxillipeds are very long and more closely resemble the walking legs than the other mouthparts. There are five pairs of walking legs, or pereiopods, diminishing in size from front to back. There are no chelae (claws), although the last segment may be able to grip against an extension of the previous segment in some cases (subchelate). The first four pairs are similarly arranged, extending forwards and downwards to be used in walking; the fifth pair is directed upwards. The abdomen bears five pairs of pleopods, of which the first are modified for use in copulation in the males. =Sexual dimorphism= Neoglyphea inopinata shows a clear sexual dimorphism in the size and proportions of the first pereiopods and the shape of the abdominal pleurites. In males, the first pereiopods are markedly longer than in females, with most of the additional length occurring in the merus and propodus (third and fourth segments). The female merus is also wider, and bears three additional teeth towards its distal end. Males have pointed abdominal pleurites, in contrast to the more rounded shape seen in females. Both these forms of sexual dimorphism are also seen in fossil glypheids, such as Glyphea regleyana. Ecology Neoglyphea appears to be most active during the daytime, since most of the known specimens were captured close to midday. Males may gather most of the food, while the females remain in their burrows; this would explain the small proportion of females among the captured specimens. The recovery of both males and females in May might suggest that this is the species' mating period. The relatively large size of the gonopores of females suggests a large egg size, and thus reduced development and eclosion in a relatively advanced state. It is therefore likely that any planktonic larval stage must be brief, which is also supported by the animal's apparently restricted distribution. Individuals appear to survive for up to five years at least, although longer lifespans cannot be excluded. All these details, although speculative, are similar to that seen in better-known species such as Nephrops norvegicus. Examination of the holotype revealed an infestation of parasitic copepods in its gills; these were described as the new species Nicothoe tumulosa in 1976.

Her colleague Jacques Forest recognised that it represented the first known extant species of the infraorder Glypheidea, which was thought to have been extinct since the Eocene, a conclusion endorsed by Fenner A. Chace, Jr. and Raymond B. Manning. Parasitic copepods were discovered on the gills of the Neoglyphea specimen, and were described in a 1976 paper by Roger F. Cressey. Five specimens were examined, all female, and all but one adults. The specific epithet ' is from the Latin meaning \\"full of mounds\\", referring to the surface texture of the animal's back. N. tumulosa is the only species in the genus to parasitise animals other than clawed lobsters of the family Nephropidae (Homarus gammarus and species of Metanephrops). Description The body of Nicothoe tumulosa is up to long, and up to wide. The preserved specimens are purple in colour. Most of the dorsal aspect is covered by three large plates; remaining areas of the trunk are covered with \\"small sclerotised bumps\\". N. tumulosa differs from other related species by the numbers of setae on its legs, and by the surface texture of the trunk. Females bear large egg sacs, similar to those in other copepod species, and each containing 50‚Äì60 eggs; the males are unknown.

She is the maternal grandmother of Ricky (Sid Owen) and Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). She made her first appearance on 5 April 2011, with Chasen appearing in the role from 21 April. The character was killed off and Chasen made her last appearance on 13 June 2011, and, though not credited for it, did a voice-over for the 14 June episode. Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood later said that Lydia's storyline was perfect and that Chasen made the part of Lydia her own. Tyzack stepped down from the role due to ill health on 13 April 2011, featuring as Lydia in three episodes before Chasen took over. Described as \\"brilliantly funny\\" and a \\"cantankerous, rich old bag of a grannie\\", ex- EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy praised the introduction of Lydia, whilst a writer for the Daily Mirror said the bond between Lydia and Janine was the \\"most touching and entertaining in Soapland.\\" Kirkwood later stated that he had a \\"soft spot\\" for Lydia's last episode and Metro Rachel Tarley deemed Lydia \\"brilliantly funny.\\" Storylines Lydia's backstory states that she never wanted a son, Norman Simmonds (George Layton) and doted on her daughter June. Although Lydia loved June, she hated the man her daughter was married to, Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). When June died of cancer in 1987, Lydia grew old alone and lived a life of solitude. Lydia is first seen when Janine visits her in hospital and realises that Lydia needs somewhere to stay. Lydia says she will sell her house and go into care, then sends Janine to her house to take photos, knowing that Janine will see how valuable the house is. Janine then invites Lydia to stay with her, and Lydia refuses, so Janine says that it is what Janine's mother and Lydia's daughter, June, would have wanted, so Lydia agrees. Although Janine believes she has manipulated Lydia, Lydia reveals to her nurse that she had in fact manipulated Janine. Lydia moves in and receives a letter that Janine tries to look at. Lydia tells Janine that she knows she is only interested in her money and wants her dead, but says Janine will have a long wait. On the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton she attends Dot Branning's (June Brown) street party but insults her great-granddaughter Tiffany Butcher (Maisie Smith) so Dot wheels her to The Queen Victoria where she watches the wedding. She is seated in front of the television, blocking everyone's view, so Winston (Ulric Browne) wheels her out of the way, pulling the cable out of the television, which causes it to lose picture. Lydia then manages to sell her house and so moves her belongings into Janine's flat and removes a canvas picture of Frank from Janine's living room. Janine disapproves but is forced to let her stay permanently. Later, Lydia then patronises everyone including Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement), Frank's mistress when he was still married to June. After moving in some furniture, Lydia struggles to stand, insisting she does not need help from Janine and slaps her when she tries to. While Janine is out, Lydia tries to reach her pills but falls out of her wheelchair. Janine is shocked to find her on the floor when she returns, and then helps her up. Lydia is unable to have an operation and is just put on stronger medicine. Lydia tells Janine that she will be fine, but Janine finds out from doctor Yusef Khan (Ace Bhatti) that she is worse than she says. Lydia bonds with Tiffany whilst she and Janine are looking after her. Janine tells Lydia that she likes having her around and wants her to stay. However, she wakes up one night saying she has seen June. She talks to Janine about her funeral and will, but Janine says she would rather have Lydia's photos of June than her money. Lydia asks to see the sun rise and hear the dawn chorus, and Janine opens the window for her. After this, Lydia quietly dies in her wheelchair and Janine is left in a state of shock. It's later revealed that Lydia altered her will before her death and left her entire estate to Janine. Lydia's son Norman (George Layton) later warns that he is going to contest Lydia's will but later decides not to. Casting and introduction The character and casting were announced on 15 February 2011, and of her casting, Tyzack said \\"I am delighted to be joining a great British tradition and a fine company of actors\\", and Executive Producer Bryan Kirkwood said: \\"What a coup to have Margaret Tyzack starring in EastEnders. She is an actress of incredible class and talent. Lydia has endless possibilities as a character, and I can't wait to see Janine meet her match.\\" Described as twisted, manipulative, damaged and \\"[a] lady of class and dignity\\", an EastEnders source revealed that Lydia is more of a schemer than Janine, saying \\"Janine is going to think there's a potential meal ticket arriving in the form of Lydia. But she's a very complex woman‚Äîand Janine won't be able to manipulate her as easily as she'd imagined.\\" The Mirror said if viewers thought \\"characters don‚Äôt come any more twisted than evil Janine, they haven‚Äôt met her granny yet.\\" EastEnders executive producer stated that Lydia was introduced to help explore Janine's fun side. Kirkwood said to Inside Soap:\\"After the stories she's had lately, it's time for Janine to have some fun, I think. We've got Margaret Tyzack with us now, filming her first scenes as Janine's wicked granny Lydia Simmonds. I reckon it's a meeting of the minds ‚Äì and a glimpse into the future for Janine!\\" On 13 April 2011, it was reported that Tyzack had pulled out of the role for personal reasons. After Tyzack's death on 25 June 2011, it was confirmed that she had withdrawn due to her health. Two episodes featuring Tyzack had already been broadcast, and she featured in a further one on 14 April. It was announced that 83-year-old (at the time of casting) Heather Chasen, who was previously best known for playing \\"super bitch\\" Valerie Pollard in ITV soap opera, Crossroads, would replace Tyzack in the role, beginning filming on 15 April for scenes to be broadcast from 21 April. Lydia dies on-screen on 13 June 2011. Chasen supplied a voiceover for the 14 June episode but was not credited. After Lydia's departure, George Layton was later introduced as her son, Norman. Storyline development Brooks revealed in an exclusive interview with Inside Soap the effect Lydia has had on Janine saying, \\"Janine had no idea how much she'd fall in love with her grandma. [...] She recognises a lot of herself in Lydia, and finally understands where she gets a lot of her traits. It's nice to see the more vulnerable side of Janine and explore why she's turned out the way that she has. Having got to know her gran, Janine regrets not getting in touch with Lydia sooner. She didn't realise Lydia cared‚Äîshe thought she was just another family member who'd neglected her. Janine feels tremendously sad.\\" Brooks also said Janine would feel 'hurt' and 'furious' of people thinking she killed Lydia saying, \\"[Pat] actually accuses Janine of killing Lydia. Janine's hurt but also nonchalant about it. Janine denies it of course, but it's frustrating for her as this is one of the first times in her life that she is genuinely telling the truth. She's stunned. Lydia died of natural causes, so Janine can't understand the police interest.\\" Brooks said of the storyline as a whole, \\"I absolutely loved exploring Janine's background, I wanted to figure out why she behaves like she does. I was really proud with the scenes with Heather Chasen [Lydia]. It was really hard work, but worth it.\\" Discussing Janine's true motivation, Brooks said: \\"Lydia has money! Janine remembers visiting her gran's house, so she knows she's got a few quid. But their reunion is quite frosty to begin with and Lydia acts like she doesn't want anything to do with Janine. But of course, there's no way Janine will give up that easily ‚Äì not when she stands to pocket that tidy sum.\\" After Lydia's death, it was reported that Janine will be accused of killing her. Janine is said to be \\"shell-shocked\\" when Lydia dies and when Pat and Janine's husband Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) see her in The Queen Victoria public house, Ryan calls the police and accuses her of murdering Lydia in order to inherit her estate. Reception Former EastEnders actress Natalie Cassidy praised the introduction of Lydia saying, \\"Margaret Tyzack is joining EastEnders as Janine's evil gran. I've seen her in a play before, so I'm sure she'll be fantastic.\\" Kirkwood chose the episode in which Lydia died in Janine's arms as his favourite of the year. A writer for the Daily Mirror branded Lydia \\"a cantankerous, rich old bag of a grannie\\", but added that she was \\"a lady bountiful, selfless philanthropist and all-round good egg.\\" The writer went on to say that the bond between Janine and Lydia turned into \\"one of the most touching and entertaining in Soapland.\\" The Metro's Rachel Tarley deemed Lydia \\"brilliantly funny.\\" See also *List of EastEnders characters (2011) *List of soap opera recasts *List of soap opera villains References EastEnders characters Television characters introduced in 2011 Female villains Female characters in television ","title":"Lydia Simmonds"},{"id":"34236528","text":"Sevaiattam or Servaiattam is a traditional dance performed by villagers in Tamil Nadu, in the southern part of India.

Kurdish American Society, 2011-12-29. In an attack on Wednesday December 29, 2011, in the Kurdish area between Turkey and Iraq, Turkish airplanes killed 35 Kurdish armed smugglers near Uludere in Sirnak province. Once again, with the pretext of \\"fighting the PKK terrorists,\\" Kurdish smugglers have lost their lives. http://www.usakurds.org/index.php?sid=16&location;=main took place in Turkish Kurdistan on December 28, 2011, near the Iraq-Turkey border, when the Turkish Air Force bombed a group of civilians (including children), killing 34. Incident A group of 40 Kurdish villagers were moving on the night of December 28, 2011, from Iraqi territory towards the Turkish border. They were mostly teenagers, mostly of Turkish nationality, from Ortasu (in Kurdish: Robosk√Æ) and G√ºlyazƒ± villages in Uludere district of ≈ûƒ±rnak Province, Turkey. They were smuggling cigarettes, diesel oil and other goods into Turkey, packed on mules. Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) had received information about activities in the region on the night of December 28, which was supplied by United States intelligence services based on a U.S. drone flight. The TAF reviewed the footage from unmanned aerial vehicles flying over the terrain, and evaluated the smugglers as a group of militants of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Pentagon officials were quoted as saying that American drones initially spotted the group, but after alerting the Turks and offering to conduct more detailed surveillance they were denied and \\"Turkish officers instead directed the Americans who were remotely piloting the drone to fly it somewhere else.\\" Two F-16 Fighting Falcons of the Turkish Air Force bombed the area. This happened after they received the information that evening from the U.S. IAI Heron drone, as stated by a survivor, Servet Enc√º. Along the borders of Turkey; Between two fires: Iraq VPRO, 4 November 2012 The next morning, relatives searched for the missing people, and found the bodies of the victims. 34 people belonging to the group were killed during and shortly after the airstrike. Two smugglers escaped to Iraq. Only one survivor, Servet Enc√º, returned to his village. 28 of the dead were from the Enc√º family. The bodies, some of them burnt beyond recognition or dismembered, were transported to their hometown on mules due to the rough terrain. Servet Enc√º stated that generations of people in his village and neighboring settlements had been in the smuggling business due to financial need. He added that Iraqi traders brought diesel oil or tea by vehicles to within of the border, and the villagers bought the goods and brought them home on trails, which took about two and a half hours. He said that the smuggling action had been well known to the border security forces. Funeral The funeral of the victims, following an autopsy performed at the Uludere hospital, took place at a newly established cemetery between the villages Ortasu and G√ºlyazƒ±. The funeral convoy, formed by about 1,000 vehicles and attended by a crowd of about 10,000 people, covered the distance of between the district center and the cemetery in one hour. Protests Major protests followed in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish cities. In Diyarbakƒ±r, protests turned violent with police using batons and tear gas against protesters who threw stones and Molotov cocktails at police. Protests were also held in AnkaraDemo held in Ankara over airstrike in SE - Tehran Times and Istanbul, where over 1,000 protesters gathered in Taksim Square; they threw stones at police and smashed vehicles before police dispersed the crowds with tear gas and water cannons. District governor Naif Yavuz, who was at the autopsy and the funeral service, later paid a condolence visit to the houses of the relatives of the victims. Shortly after his visit, he was attacked by a mob, which attempted to lynch him. He escaped the attack with the help of his security guards, and was hospitalized for his injuries. The attack was made by people from outside the village. In Nicosia, around 300 Kurdish Cypriots marched on the Turkish embassy in Northern Cyprus, where Murat Kanatlƒ±, head of the left-wing New Cyprus Party, spoke to the crowd and accused Turkey of escalating tensions in the country's southeast. The demonstration ended peacefully. In Tehran, a group of Iranian Kurds demonstrated in front of the Turkish embassy. In Erbil, Iraq, the killings were protested by some 500 Iraqi Kurds, some of whom clashed with Iraqi Kurdistan security forces; no casualties were reported. Some protesters carried pictures of Abdullah √ñcalan and chanted \\"fight, fight for freedom\\" and \\"Erdogan is a terrorist\\". At the protest, Kurdish activist Ali Mahmoud told the press that \\"The crime ... is a real genocide, a war crime and a crime against humanity, and breaches international laws, we demand that Turkey be judged in the international courts.\\" Responses Bahoz Erdal, the leader of the PKK's military wing, called for a Kurdish uprising in response to the incident: \\"We urge the people of Kurdistan... to react after this massacre and seek a settling of accounts through uprisings.\\" Meanwhile, Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) leader Selahattin Demirta≈ü released a statement claiming that \\"It‚Äôs clearly a massacre of civilians, of whom the oldest is 20,\\" but he called for Kurds to respond through democratic means. He also quoted Erdoƒüan on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad: \\"A leader who kills his own people has lost his legitimacy\\" and said \\"now I say the same thing back to him.\\" Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan made assurances that essential administrative and judicial investigations were initiated. H√ºseyin √áelik, the deputy chairman and spokesman of the ruling party AK Party, announced that the families of the victims would be compensated constituting a \\"material apology\\". He added that a verbal apology could follow after incident's details were uncovered. The Republican People's Party (CHP), Turkey's largest opposition party, sharply criticized what they perceived as the government's attempt to portray the incident as understandable collateral damage, with Kurdish CHP deputy Sezgin Tanrikulu saying that \\"If there are some who think that death of these innocents is just a natural result of the struggle against terror, it means that Turkey has already been divided on moral grounds.\\" Graeme Wood at the New York Times blog asked if Erdoƒüan was a 'New Assad' dictator and oppressor.Graeme Wood, \\"A Turkish Assad?\\" New York Times (blog), January 1, 2012, http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/12/12/recep-tayyip-erdogan-peoples-choice- for-times-2011-person-of-the-year/ In a MetroPOLL public opinion survey of 1,174 Turkish people, 14.5% said the state was ultimately responsible for the deaths, 11.5% said the smugglers, 9.5% said the PKK, 5.4% said the prime minister of the government and 4.9% said it was the General Staff. When asked whether the government had fulfilled its responsibilities towards the incident, some 45% said yes, with 38.1% saying no.

The office is funded through the tourism tax, which is then used to provide advertising and marketing for the region and to develop tourism-related programs. Background The Space Coast Office of Tourism covers the Brevard County, which extends along the coast of Florida, an area which covers part of the Space Coast. Funding for the office comes from a 5% Tourist Development Tax, which is collected from hotels and other tourist accommodation. The region has traditionally had a strong focus on tourism through the space industry, and the industry accounted for as much as 15% of the tourism in the region, but with a reduction in shuttle launches this dropped to under 5% by 2005. Accordingly, the office had to move their focus to alternative tourism operations, selling \\"beaches, cruise ships and nature tourism\\", and after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, the Space Shuttle was dropped from their advertising campaigns. Although the Discovery's launch in 2005 did see a return of astronaut imagery, the region's dependency on the space industry was much reduced, and by 2011 when the final Space Shuttle mission took place, the Space Coast Office of Tourism argued that the reduced dependency on the industry would allow the region to cope with the expected economic downfall. Projects The office is responsible for advertising, and traditionally they have focused on consumer markets. This has included advertising in newspapers (both within Florida and in parts of northwestern and southwestern United States), billboards, posters and television advertising, with their first television campaign screening in 1995. In 1992 the office had a budget of $2.5 million, of which $1 million was directed to consumer advertising. By 1998, that figure had changed to $4 million over two years. Along with their role in attracting tourists through advertising, the office develops tourism programs, events and information campaigns. These have included a 12-day educational tour for students from India, a course on boating ecotourism through a partnership with the University of Florida Brevard County Extension Office, parades, and a \\"beach bus\\" promoting the region's coastline.

It is located about 400 kilometers from Bras√≠lia, midway between the municipalities of S√£o Domingos, Posse e Guarani de Goi√°s, in the State of Goi√°s, Brazil. Thousands of years ago, a landslide caused its division into two parts. The first can be visited easily, but the second part requires a tour guide.

It has two skylights, one of them called Araras and a large gallery called Lovers' Hall decorated with rich stalactites and stalagmites and huge sand dunes crossed by the underground Lapa river.  Geology  Indeed, geologists working for the state park say that the whole area where the cave is located was sea bottom about 600 million years, considering the many sea shells found around the area. It was formed by the continuous action of rain water and the Lapa River that comes down from the Serra Geral.

Construction The mosque is named after the Hindu queen of Sultan Mahmud Begada, Rani Sipri. The queen commissioned this mosque in 1514 when her husband executed their son for some misdemeanor. After her death, the queen was buried in this mosque. Inside, there is also a jenana, a separate area for women to worship.

(formerly Build Your Own Blocks or BYOB) is a free, block-based educational graphical programming language and online community aimed at students to explore, create and re-mix interactive animations, games, stories, and more, while learning about mathematical and computational ideas. While inspired by Scratch, Snap! has many advanced features. The Snap! editor, and programs created in it, are web applications that run in the browser (like Scratch 2 and 3) without requiring installation. User interface IDE at startup In Snap!, the screen is organized in three resizable columns containing five regions: the block group selector (top of left column), the blocks palette (left column), the main area (middle column), and the stage area (top of right column) with the sprite selector (also called the sprite corral) showing sprite thumbnails below it. In the interactively resizable stage area (full-screen is available, too) are drawn the graphical results (i.e. animations, graphics, etc.) of the scripts running in the script area, and/or interactively double-clicked individual blocks in any palette. Individual blocks can be dragged from the palette onto the scripts area to be associated with the selected sprite. { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" style=\\"text-align: left\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background: #efefef;\\"  Category !!

It was founded in 2009 by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon, and is known for the critically acclaimed games Bastion, Transistor, Pyre and Hades. History Amir Rao, co-founder of Supergiant Games, in 2012 Supergiant Games was formed by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon in 2009. Both had been working at the Los Angeles studio of Electronic Arts, involved with the Command & Conquer series. In 2009 they agreed to quit their job, move into the same house, and begin to work on a new game together. At that time, they had also hired musician Darren Korb for audio and music work. They also used a number of freelancer programmers and developers they could call on for help at various times during the development of this first game. Their first game, Bastion, received high critical praise, including being listed among several \\"Game of the Year\\" lists from game journalists. It was first shown in mid-development at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo as part of its \\"PAX 10\\" highlight ten upcoming independently developed games. This attracted several publishers who wanted to help distribute the game, but Supergiant Games found that Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment shared the same vision they had for the game. Supergiant selected them as their publishing partner, enabling them not only to distribute the game to Xbox Live Arcade but as a premiere title during the 2011 \\"Summer of Arcade\\" promotion. In March 2013, Supergiant Games announced their next title, Transistor, released on May 20, 2014. A promotion video was released March 19. The game features a female protagonist, Red, in a cyberpunk-like city, who has acquired a powerful weapon that she is nearly killed for possessing. The game features a similar isometric viewpoint to Bastion. Transistor was similarly met with critical acclaim. In April 2016, Supergiant Games announced their third game Pyre, released on July 25, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, Linux and PlayStation 4. It was described as a party- based role playing game. In a break from their previous games Pyre does not use an isometric viewpoint; the player's party travels across a 2D overworld, and combat takes place on a separate arena. The combat system is also very different, being described as \\"fantasy basketball\\". Pyre was again regarded fondly by critics and was named Game Informer best indie game for that year. Supergiant's next game, Hades, was revealed at The Game Awards 2018 and released on September 17, 2020, following an early access release from December 2018. Hades is an action roguelike game based on Greek mythology, where the player character Zagreus uses a combination of weapon, magic, and abilities to defeat enemies in procedurally-generated dungeons and escape from his father, Hades.

But in this story, the lowly amaranth praises the rose for its beauty and reputation and is answered, equally humbly, that a rose's life is brief while the amaranth (the name of which means literally 'the undying flower') is everlasting.

Wartime use  During the First Sino-Japanese War and World War II, a soldier going off to fight was often given a senninbari haramaki (\\"1,000 stitch belt\\") by his family. A mother, sister, or wife would stand on the street and ask passing women to contribute a stitch until 1,000 had been collected. The garment was meant to both provide warmth and serve as a talisman to ward away harm.Michael A.

They are a simple circular tube of fabric, much like a tube top, worn around the midriff as opposed to the chest. The new haramaki have gained popularity in Japanese fashion as an accessory and are made from many fabrics and patterns for practical and aesthetic purposes. Shigesato Itoi and his company Hobonichi are commonly credited for the current resurgence. Itoi had been wearing haramaki for years despite their old-fashioned reputation and perception as an unfashionable undergarment, eventually re- introducing them as an accessory for sale in Japan.

He was one of the leaders in the Revolution of Reforms of 1835.  Youth  He was the son of Canarian Jos√© Carujo, royalist official and Venezuelan Juana Hernandez. He received a good education, being one of the few Venezuelans of his time who spoke and wrote English and French. Although born in a home divided over the Royalist and Republican causes, he joined the liberation movement as part of the battalion Orinoco quartered in Angostura (1819). In 1821, he participated under the command of General Jos√© Francisco Berm√∫dez, in the campaigns of Caracas and St. Lucia. With the rank of captain, he distinguished himself in Maracaibo (1823), but was wounded in combat, so he moved to New Granada with the rank of sergeant.  In New Granada  He studied mathematics and analytical geometry under the leadership of the Franciscan friar Tom√°s S√°nchez Mora, and he joined the Freemasons. In 1828, while serving as a General Staff assistant of the department of Cundinamarca, he was promoted to commander and was selected by Simon Bolivar to chair the Military Academy that was founded in Bogot√°. In spite of this, he joined the opponents of President Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, who perpetrated the attacks of September 25, 1828 against the Liberator's life. He was sentenced to death but was saved thanks to a pardon granted by the Council of Ministers, with intervention from Rafael Urdaneta. He was locked in a prison in Bogota, and was then imprisoned in the Boca Chica Castle, Cartagena. In March 1829, he was transferred to Solano castle overlooking Puerto Cabello from which he escaped (8/2/1829). However, he was captured soon after and was returned to the fort in a humiliating way. His time spent in prison advocating for freedom, writing to the general Jos√© Antonio P√°ez and other officials of the regime; to publishing articles and letters in El Fanal newspaper. He was deported to Cura√ßao in early June 1830, and the general amnesty decreed by Paez 25 in the same month allowed him to return to Venezuela. He went to Maracaibo and organized a militia of 1,000 men, with whom he crossed the border and ventured to Riohacha, who had rebelled against the government of Rafael Urdaneta. In January 1831, in the vicinity of San Jos√© and the Mill, he was defeated by the general Jose Felix Blanco, after which he would retire from the army in 1833. Subsequently, he became the spokesman for a group of military and ranchers gathered around the general Santiago Mari√±o. Carujo fought from the columns of the El republicano newspaper against the presidential candidacy of Dr. Jos√© Mar√≠a Vargas, whom he accused of being \\"realistic and unpatriotic\\" (1834).  Revolution and death  In 1835, he was one of the officers who led the Revolution of Reforms, led by General Santiago Mari√±o, and was in charge of capturing President Vargas at home (08/07/1835). There was a dialogue between them, whereby Carujo told Vargas: \\"Doctor Vargas, the world belongs to the brave\\", and he replied: \\"the world is for the just man,\\" after which he went into exile on the island of Saint Thomas. In charge in the Anzoategui battalion, Carujo was one of the most militant participants in that civil war, winning the battles of Cariaco (September 20, 1835) and Car√∫pano (10/5/1835), where he defeated the general Francisco Esteban Gomez. The army left Puerto Cabello, won in El Pino, near San Esteban National Park (October 27, 1835), against the colonel Andr√©s Torellas and three of their brigades. They attempted to take Valencia on October 28 and were defeated the next day in the battle of Camoruco, by general Jos√© Mar√≠a Carre√±o. Although he was locked in the San Felipe Castle, Carujo managed to escape and restart incursions into Tucacas, Aroa and San Felipe. Finally, wounded and captured at the Battle of Paso Real, near Puerto Cabello (December 25, 1835), he was tried and sentenced to death (January 27, 1836), but the sentence was not fulfilled, and he died in prison in Valencia, as a result of injuries sustained during the development of what would be his last fight.

Felix of Jesus Rougier (December 17, 1859, Meilhaud, France ‚Äî January 10, 1938, Mexico City) was a Catholic priest and founder of several institutes of consecrated life who was declared venerable in the year 2000.  Youth  The Venerable Servant of God Fr. Felix Rougier was born on December 17, 1859 in Meilhaud, France. His parents were Benedict and Maria Luisa Olanier Rougier. He had two brothers: Emmanuel, who was initially a missionary in Oceania but later quit the priesthood, and Estanislao, who distinguished himself as an untiring promoter of social action, defending farmers from their land. Initially, Felix Rougier was thinking of becoming a doctor. However, his vision soon radically changed after meeting the bishop, Monsignor Eloy, who spoke at length about the missions to over 300 students, including young Felix. Because of this, Felix felt a very intense desire to become a missionary, which never left him. His motto became \\"Love the Holy Spirit and make Him loved ...\\"  Ordination  After reflecting on his vocation as a missionary, Felix decided to enter the Society of Mary (Marist) where he was admitted and recognized by his obedience and happy surrender to his ministry. When the day of his ordination grew near, he developed a strong arthritis in his right arm. This was cause to prevent his ordination since at that time good health was a fundamental requirement for the priesthood. However, after painful testing of his condition, he was miraculously cured by St. John Bosco who later would say, \\"God will make you win many souls.\\" Don Bosco was known for his ability to work extraordinary wonders in people and he did this in Felix. Although the problem with his arm was not entirely removed, the improvement was extraordinary and the strength in his arm increased over time, ultimately saving his right arm. Finally, he was ordained as a priest on September 24, 1887.  Missionary work  During his years in Colombia Fr. Felix‚Äôs dream was to be a missionary in Oceania, but initially his journey there was suspended due to the illness in the arm. His superiors sent him to Colombia where he developed an extensive educational effort and faced the challenges of the Thousand Days' War. He conducted a national ministry collecting food and delivering it to the hungry. Also, he devoted himself to accompanying the soldiers in their last hours and times of illness. He risked his life during the war to hear confessions and attend to the wounded, once even defending the cloak on a corpse that would have been desecrated by the man‚Äôs enemies. Felix Rougier during his years in Spain In February 1902, Fr. Felix went to Mexico where, on February 4, 1903, he met the Venerable Servant of God Concepci√≥n Cabrera de Armida. She, without knowing anything about him, began to talk to him in Confession about certain things that only Father Felix could have known himself. Mrs. Armida, called ‚ÄúConchita‚Äù had various mystical graces. She then spoke to him about the Works of the Cross which she had founded, causing Fr. Felix to immediately have a great love and respect for her. Soon, Conchita announced that God wanted him to be the founder of the Fifth Work of the Cross, the Missionaries of the Holy Spirit. After asking advice from his superiors, he accepted her invitation. Foundations  When Fr. Felix first requested permission to found the Congregation mentioned, he was denied and forbidden to deal with the project for ten years. This caused him great pain, but he stood firm with Christ knowing that the work would pay off. Finally through the intercession of Bishop Ram√≥n Ibarra and Gonz√°lez, first the Archbishop of Puebla then the Vatican granted Fr. Felix Rougier his foundation on December 25, 1914 in the Chapel of the Roses at Tepeyac, Mexico City. This was the origin of the Congregation of the Missionaries the Holy Spirit. This was done despite full religious persecution by the government. As time went on, Fr. Felix gave birth to three new Institutes of Religious Life: The Daughters of the Holy Spirit (1924) in order to work for the education of young people and to promote all vocations within the Church, the Guadalupan Missionaries of the Holy Spirit (1930) in response to the needs of indigenous people and the needy, and the Oblates of Jesus the Priest (1937) in order to assist in the formation of future priests. Fr. Felix of Jesus Rougier after the foundation of the Missionaries of the Holy Spirit Fr. Felix Rougier of Jesus was already known in his time as a saint because he loved his priesthood, his mission, and he never lost an opportunity to work for a better world. He was ahead of his time by giving strong support to the laity as well as promoting various media. He founded the Revista la Cruz which continues to be edited. Besides being a great Egyptologist, he dedicated himself to the creation and promotion of schools and hospitals.  Death and venerability declaration  Fr. Felix died on January 10, 1938 in the French Hospital in Mexico City. His last words were: ‚ÄúWith Mary everything, without her, nothing.‚Äù His remains are in the National Church of San Felipe de Jesus, in the Historic Center of Mexico City. He was declared venerable by Pope John Paul II in 2000. His cause for beatification has been initiated.

He was a Venezuelan merchant and privateer who played many roles in the turbulent world of the 19th-century Caribbean including that of merchant sea captain as well as being a successful privateer. With Luis Brion, he was Simon Bolivar‚Äôs favorite admiral as well as an active partner in the affairs of the Lafitte brothers, Jean and Pierre. He fought both as a revolutionary and as a defender against revolt, and was regarded as a patriot in the eyes of eight American nations, although England and France considered him a brigand.  Early life  The Residence of Don Manuel Lanzos, Captain of the Spanish Army, also known as Madam John‚Äôs Legacy, in New Orleans French Quarter is the birthplace of Renato Beluche Renato Beluche was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1780. The location of the house he was born in is now a State owned Museum (a later house, on the same property, built in 1788) referred to as \\"Madame John's Legacy\\". The original building was erected in 1725 and sold to Ren√© Beluche (Renato's Father) about 1777. The son of a recently emigrated Frenchman whose wig-making business was a front for smuggling, he lived on the family's Chalmette plantation. In 1802 Beluche went to sea as a pilot's mate on the flagship of the Spanish fleet, and by 1805 he was master of a merchant schooner. By this time, the Laffitte brothers had established a smuggling base at Grande Terre Island in Barataria Bay on the Louisiana coast. Flying the French flag, Beluche captured Spanish and English ships and sent them to Grande-Terre and Cartagena de Indias in New Granada. There is evidence that Beluche may have used the alias Pierre (or Pedro) Brugman, though it appears that this may have been an associate - or at least a convenient look-alike.  Battle of New Orleans  In 1813, Beluche became associated with the Venezuelan patriots who were rebelling against Spanish rule, and with the letter of marque of their leader, Simon Bolivar. Beluche would spend the next decade in the service of the Venezuelan revolution, interrupted only by a brief period when he joined with Jean Lafitte and the Baratarian smugglers who had come to the aid of General Andrew Jackson during the British invasion of the Gulf Coast.  Caribbean  After serving as an artillery commander beside Dominique You in the Battle of New Orleans, Beluche was drawn back into the liberation of Venezuela. He participated in the Aux Cayes Expedition,Extranjeros destacados en el ejercito de Bolivar the Battle of Lake Maracaibo, and the Siege of Puerto Cabello on 8 November 1823. In 1824, Beluche settled his family in Puerto Cabello, and after independence was finally won, he worked as a coastal shipping captain. In 1836 Beluche fought on the losing side of a rebellion against the Venezuelan government and was exiled for nine years. He returned in 1845 and helped crush another revolt that raged from 1848 until 1850.  Death  For the next decade he led an uncharacteristically quiet existence, and died peacefully in Puerto Cabello in 1860. Renato Beluche's vigorous career on the sea had taken him to nearly every corner of the Caribbean; he had lived a life intertwined with the history of his world. Later, his remains were re-interred in the National Pantheon of Venezuela on 22 July 1963.

He lived for some time at Tillington. Lathy was first assistant to William Watkins, in Eastbourne then curator for Herbert Jordan Adams in Enfield (this collection is now in the Natural History Museum, London). At this time, on Adams' behalf, he collected in the West Indies (especially Jamaica) and South America and employed collectors who were sent to Peru and Dutch New Guinea.

She was known as \\"Do√±a Manolita\\" in Uruguay. She was considered to be an \\"inseparable companion\\" to Torres Garc√≠a, accompanied him to conferences, exhibitions and supported all of his artistic endeavors. In many ways, she was \\"like his shadow.\\" Founder of the museum, the Museo Torres Garcia in Montevideo.  Biography  Pi√±a Torres was born in Barcelona, Spain on 24 February 1883 and died in Montevideo on 11 June 1994. Pi√±a Torres was classically educated by her wealthy parents and she played piano into her late years. She married Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a on 20 August 1908 in Barcelona. She and her husband lived in Europe, New York and in Montevideo in 1934. Pi√±a Torres's art, along with her husband's, has been collected by Emilio Ellena. Ellena describes her art as creative and beautiful, but Pi√±a Torres stopped painting after she was married. Pi√±a Torres states that she stopped painting so that she would not become a better painter than her husband or disturb his work, which would have been shameful to their family during her time and in her culture. She felt that although she had stopped painting herself, that her opinion on art was always welcome. She may have continued to do some art, since there is a record of a master quality woodcut in a book, Notes on Art by Torres Garcia (1913). She says that politics were one of the few things she argued about with her husband. She was known to help artists who were suffering from political persecution. Two of her grandchildren were imprisoned and in exile and her home was searched for them. Pi√±a Torres also refused to move back to Barcelona because of the crimes against art that were committed there, such as destroying frescoes.  Legacy  In 1951, Pi√±a Torres created a group in Montevideo, called MAOTIMA (standing for the names of the participants, Manolita, Otilia, Iphigenia and Maria Angelica) which was dedicated to working on embroidered tapestries. Pi≈àa Torres was a tireless collector of her husband's work and later helped promote much of his formerly unseen art. She also inventoried his work, a list of over 350 pieces of art. Pi√±a Torres felt that after her husband's death, she should ensure his legacy and therefore created a museum dedicated to her husband's art and legacy which she accomplished at age 106. Pi√±a Torres set up the foundation to support the Museo Torres Garcia and helped found the museum which was initially opened on 29 July 1953. The museum went through a long, difficult history until the government of Uruguay stabilized and the museum was inaugurated in its current form in 1986. Pi√±a Torres was credited with enthusiasm and strength in working towards the creation of the museum. In addition to creating the foundation and the museum, she also set up an archive to document his life's work. She was often a subject of portraiture for her husband and the subject of others'other's paintings, as well, including artist, Rafael Barradas. She was honored in 2000 by the Cultural Center Foundation, Caixa Terrassa.

There are variations in the perception and display of sexual suggestiveness, including but not limited to gender, culture and generation. Different cultures and different generations have varying views on what is considered to be sexually suggestive. For example, in British culture, it is normal for a woman to wear shorts and bare her legs on a hot, sunny day, but a woman with naked flesh on show would be considered promiscuous in certain cultures around the world. For the majority of the 20th century in western culture, it was considered vulgar for women to have their sexual ornaments (breasts) fully on show; in more modern times, this may not be a deviation from the norm. In evolutionary terms, sexual suggestiveness is a mode from which sexual mates are gained. Therefore, the ability to use sexual suggestiveness effectively is a trait that is part of sexual selection. Displays of sexual suggestiveness include things such as; women in swimsuit adverts, sexually-themed music or music with a strong beat meant for dancing, sexting, erotic lingerie or \\"wolf whistling\\". Sexual suggestiveness may also involve nudity, or the exposure of the nipples, genitals, buttocks or other taboo areas of the body. Even a brand name or phrase can be considered to be sexually suggestive if it has strong sexual connotations or undertones. In some cases, displays of sexual suggestiveness may be misinterpreted which may lead to dangerous or harmful situations. Evolutionary perspective From an evolutionary point of view, sexual suggestiveness evolved in order to aid in securing a sexual partner or mate. Once the individual has decided on a mate to pursue, sexual suggestiveness helps in attracting the mate - this is a skill which has been sexually selected (sexual selection) for during evolution. Sexually suggestive behaviors include things such as \\"showing more skin\\" and flirting. Both of these examples are behaviors which the individual would intentionally display. There is also research to suggest that sexually suggestive behaviors may not always be deliberate. Unbeknownst to the individual, factors such as the menstrual cycle, voice pitch and rate of money spending can all have an effect on sexual success and sexually suggestive behavior. For example, when females were in the work place and ovulating they were more likely to engage in sexually suggestive behaviors e.g. showing more skin; further, females who work as lap dancers earn more money when they are in the ovulating stage. This may be because the female unwittingly behaves in a more sexual way and therefore puts out more sexually suggestive cues. There is not, however, any evidence to show that these females are aware that their actions or earnings are intrinsically linked to their menstrual cycle.  21st century The rise of the media, advertising and film industries as well as the growth of the fashion industry are all contributing factors to increase sexually suggestive content in an every-day setting. There are far more displays of sexually suggestive behavior in modern-day life than there ever has been before and not just within advertising. The idea that sex sells is evident in many aspects of daily modern life particularly within social media and film where female sexual ornaments are a focal point. For example, many films include additional sex scenes and sexually suggestive female characters regardless of the film's narrative.Benshoff, H. M., & Griffin, S. (2011). America on film: Representing race, class, gender, and sexuality at the movies. John Wiley & Sons. The progression of the Internet and social media means that sexual content is far more available and accessible in the 21st century than ever before. This has a knock on effect on people's sexualization and sexual behavior. Children's sexuality develops at an earlier age if they have been exposed to more sexual content when young. For example, young adolescents engage in more sexual behaviors if they have been exposed to more sexual content in the media or on television.Lenhart, A. (2009). Teens and Sexting: How and why minor teens are sending sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude images via text messaging.Strasburger, V. C. (1995). Adolescents and the media: medical and psychological impact. Sage Publications, Inc. On average, females become pubescent earlier in their development if they have been exposed to sexual content or sexual behavior. Most psychologists agree that this physical display of sexuality is due to evolutionary reasons and that girls develop their sexuality (e.g. behaving sexually suggestively) at an earlier age in order to sexually compete with other women and in order successfully reproduce.Harris, R. J., & Scott, C. L. (Eds.) (2002). Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research. New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc. Misinterpretation The increase in sexual content in modern society often results in a more nonchalant approach to sexually suggestive behavior. People, predominantly women, often act in a way that they themselves do not consider to be sexually suggestive but which can be misinterpreted by others. For example, wearing clothes or skirts/shorts that show skin is not something that most Western women would consider to be overtly provocative but it is still regarded as sexually suggestive by others. Misconstruing people's behaviour can have disastrous consequences, contributing to harassment and rape culture. Evolutionary psychology explains that this misinterpretation is the result of sexual selection. Men have adapted through sexual selection to have the maximum number of offspring possible, and therefore exhibit certain behaviors that facilitate maximum reproduction. Men perceive sexually suggestive behavior and other sexual cues, including biological ornaments, as signs of reproductive ability and willingness. The hypothesis of rape as an adaption states that the rape of reproductive-age females was favoured by direct selection in order to increase the chance of reproductive success.Thornhill, R., & Palmer, C. T. (2001). A Natural History of Rape. MIT press. Sexually suggestive behavior and biological ornamentation are signs of sexual maturity and thus females who display more of these behaviors, or who have more obvious ornamentation, are more likely to be at a higher risk of harassment, or even rape. This evolutionary explanation also extends to women. At their most fertile stage in their menstrual cycle, during estrus, women are far less likely to engage in rape-risky behaviors such as walking alone late at night, than women who are in the least fertile stage of their menstrual cycle, the luteal phase or women using hormonal contraception. This is because women who are in the luteal phase or women using a hormonal contraceptive are much less likely to become pregnant after sexual intercourse than estrus women are. These evolutionary explanations serve only to increase the psychological understanding of sexual behaviors. Sexual suggestiveness, rape, and all other sexual behaviors, are proven to be products of past evolution. In the case of rape, however, just because it is natural does not make it acceptable.Thornhill, R., & Palmer, C. T. (2000). A Natural History of Rape. MIT Press.  Flirting  Flirting can be sexually suggestive, which can intentionally elicit a sexual response from another person. Research has identified different motivations for engaging in flirting behaviors. There is flirting with a sexual motivation, which is done with a view to engaging in Human sexual activity and there is also flirting with a fun motivation, in which the interaction itself is the pleasurable part. An instrumental motivation of flirting behavior is flirting performed in order to accomplish an instrumental goal, such as getting someone to buy you a drink. However, flirting can sometimes lead to unintentional responses. If the motivation behind sexually suggestive behavior is misinterpreted or miscommunicated, then a sexual response could be elicited where it is not wanted. If escalated, this can lead to sexual harassment in the workplace or sexual coercion in a relationship. In line with evolutionary explanations of sexually suggestive behavior, research has shown that females are more likely to consider the use of flirting as being for relational purposes, and males are more likely to interpret female flirting as having a sexual motivation. Gender differences There are some reported gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is perceived. Males and females have different thresholds for the perception of sexual suggestiveness or intent. Males are, in general, more sexually occupied than females. To support this assumption research shows that males perceive people as more interested in a sexual encounter than females do.Shotland, R. L., & Craig, J. M. (1988). Can men and women differentiate between friendly and sexually interested behavior?. Social Psychology Quarterly, 66-73. It has also been suggested that males find it difficult to differentiate between liking, love and sexual intent, and in this case sexual suggestiveness. Unfortunately, this difficulty in separation between the two from the male's point of view may lead to rape or other sexual assault. During the evolution of human sexuality, the fact that females are the choosy gender meant that males who were able to quickly detect a female's willingness were the males who passed along their genes effectively. In light of this, males, therefore, tend to read sexual acceptance signals in friendly actions even when this may not be the females intention.Thornhill, R., & Palmer, C. T. (2000). Why men rape. The Sciences, 40(1), 30-36. Chicago Females are however better at reading platonic signals from the opposite sex and at differentiating between liking, loving and sexual suggestiveness. There are also gender differences between how sexual suggestiveness is displayed via flirting. Recent research has shown that females are more likely than males to flirt with the intention of developing a new relationship, or with the intention of intensifying an existing relationship. It has also been found that females use flirting as a way of assessing the interest of a potential mate; as the end result is sexual activity, it can be inferred that this is a sexually suggestive act. On the other hand, a variety of different researchers have found that males are significantly more sexually motivated in their displays of sexual suggestiveness (such as flirting) than females. The research done by Clark and Hatfield (1989) supports these assumptions by clearly suggesting that female courtship is motivated by relationship development and that male courtship is motivated by sexual desire. It is these gender differences that can explain the potential miscommunication of social actions. Cultural differences Since the 1990s there has been a dramatic increase in the understanding of human sexuality from an evolutionary perspective.Buss, D. (2015). Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Psychology Press. Evolutionary theory proposes that humans all behave in the same way, in order to maximise survival and reproductive success. However, as with much of human behavior, there are substantial differences in the sexual suggestiveness of people from different cultures. What may be a culturally appropriate display of 'sexiness' in one culture may be considered inappropriate in another, and vice versa. For example, in many Westernized cultures women displaying their bare legs in public is considered to be a relatively unassuming display of suggestiveness, while in many African societies, for example, the same behavior would be considered immodest. It can be argued that religion is a significant factor in the cultural differences of sexual suggestiveness, especially with regards to what displays of suggestiveness are considered appropriate.Melman, B. (2016). Women‚Äôs Orients: English Women and the Middle East, 1718‚Äì1918: Sexuality, Religion and Work. Springer. In particular, some Christian and Muslim communities are more strict on what levels of suggestiveness are appropriate for unmarried young women. In the media  =General= A considerable amount of research has concluded that sexually suggestive content is pervasive in the media. The most common type of sexually suggestive content in adolescent programming is in the form of a sexual innuendo. Sexual innuendoes give a suggestive alternative meaning to an otherwise neutral phrase. For example, the use of the phrase \\"bend over backwards\\" when describing a colleague, in the sitcom How I Met Your Mother, is used by the main character Barney to imply something in both a figurative sense (i.e. that she is willing to work hard) and a suggestive sense (alluding to her flexibility in sexual positions). Content analyses of sexual behavior in the media found that sexual content on television has risen from 45% in 1975 to 81% now.Kunkel, D., Cope, K., Farinola, W., Biely, E., Rollin, E., & Donnerstein, E. (1999). Sex on TE.' A biennial report to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001. Menlo Park, CA: The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. 83% of all programs on television contain sexual content. 80% of programs contain sexually suggestive references, and 49% of shows contain sexual behavior which include flirting. Sexual innuendoes occur as much as twice per program in popular American sitcoms, whilst flirting occurred at least once per programme. The use of sexual innuendoes in the media is also done through newspapers, magazines and music, and accounts for roughly 12% of the entire sexual content shown in the media overall. Analysis of sexually suggestive behavior in sports media showed that there was considerable gender differences in how sports stars are portrayed visually. For example, females are photographed nude more frequently than men, and were photographed in a hetero-sexy manner which was done to attract the male gaze, such as with sports equipment covering their genitalia due to its suggestive nature. Overall, females are portrayed in a manner that alludes to their status as a sex symbol. Sexual content in the form of innuendo, suggestive imagery and double entendre is used as a tool in advertising.Courtney, A., Whipple, T. (1983). Sex Stereotyping in Advertising (Lexington, MA: Heath) Suggestive advertising is used to draw in attention, by monopolizing attentional resources, and as a means of distinguishing their products from similar products which are usually advertised in the same medium (such as in the same magazine). Furthermore, advertisers use sexually suggestive material to imply an association between their product and benefits which are in some way related to sex (such as mate attraction). There was a significant increase in the amount of advertisements from 1983 to 2003 which used sexually suggestive images of models, suggesting that advertisers are finding it beneficial. While the physical properties of the model are the most sexually suggestive, a number of non-verbal communicative features have also been identified as being provocative, such as the models pose (plumped lips, cocked head to show the neck) as well as verbal communicative features such as suggestive comments. = Effects = A number of studies have looked at the effects of sexual content in the media on preadolescent and adolescent sexual development. It has been put forth that watching a high level of television, in which there is a lot of sexually suggestive behavior, can lead to the initiation of sexual intercourse at a younger age than those who watch the least amount of sexually suggestive programming. In addition to this, adolescents who had been exposed to a high level of sexual content, would engage in a level of sexual activity expected by those up to three years older who watched less sexual content. It has been suggested that according to social learning theory, television is a method by which children can acquire behaviors, through observational learning, and that this is a potential method through which children are becoming increasingly sexualized. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy in the U.S are more common among adolescents who begin sexual activity earlier, demonstrating that earlier sexualization, for which sexually suggestive content in the media has been implicated, has far reaching effects. Sexually suggestive content can also affect adolescents' views and attitudes towards sex, and their sexual socialization as whole. Research conducted with the cultivation theory in mind, has found that there is an association between people with a high regular exposure to sexually oriented genres (such as soap operas and hip-hop music) and more liberal attitudes towards sexual behavior like the acceptance of pre-marital sex, as well as non-relational sex and sexual harassment. Furthermore, as sexual competence is portrayed as a positive attribute on television, particularly for males, regular exposure to sexual content can cause adolescents to form unrealistic expectations, and view their own sexual experiences (or lack thereof) as negative. Moreover, the vast majority of this sexual content alludes to the positive nature of sex only, suggesting that sexually suggestive behavior in the media is serving to perpetuate a view that there are little negative consequences of engaging in sexual activity. Research has shown that the effects of sexually suggestive references in the media are also moderated by the developmental stage of the viewer. For example, 12 year olds have more difficulty correctly interpreting innuendos than 14 year olds. Furthermore, pre-pubescent adolescents often view sexual references on television with disgust and embarrassment, whereas pubescent adolescents viewed it with interest.Brown, J. D., White, A. B., Nikipoulou, L. (1993). Disinterest, intrigue and resistance: Early adolescent girls‚Äô use of sexual media content. In B. Greenberg, J. D. Brown, & N.

He later became a Roman Catholic. Life The eldest son of William Jocelyn Palmer (rector of Mixbury in Oxfordshire) and Dorothea Richardson (daughter of the Revd William Roundell of Gledstone Hall, Yorkshire), he was born on 12 July 1811. Edwin Palmer and Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne, were his brothers. He was educated at Rugby School and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he matriculated on 27 July 1826, and was elected to a demyship. In 1830 he obtained the chancellor's prize with a Latin poem, \\"Tyrus\\", and a first-class in the classical schools. In 1831 he graduated BA and in 1832 was ordained as a deacon and received a Magdalen fellowship. In 1833 he proceeded MA and gained the chancellor's prize with a Latin Oratio de Com≈ìdia Atticorum which was printed the same year. During the next three years he was a tutor at the University of Durham, from 1837 to 1839 an examiner in the classical schools at Oxford and from 1838 to 1843 a tutor at Magdalen College. With extreme high church views, Palmer anticipated in an unpublished Latin introduction to the Thirty-nine Articles, composed for the use of his pupils in 1839‚Äì40, the argument of the celebrated Tract XC. He took, however, little active part in the Tractarian movement, studying various forms of ecclesiastical polity and theological belief. First visit to Russia In 1840 Palmer visited Russia, seeking obtain recognition of the Anglican claim to intercommunion. Letters of commendation from Martin Joseph Routh, President of Magdalen College, and the British ambassador at the Russian court, gained him an introduction to high functionaries in the Russian church. Palmer worked to persuade them that the Church of England was a branch of the catholic church. A difficulty was the recent admission to communion by the English chaplain at Geneva of Princess Galitzin and her eldest daughter, both of whom had renounced the Greek church. Prince Galitzin had sought by letter, but had failed to obtain, from Archbishop William Howley an opinion on the question whether apostates from the Russian church could lawfully take the communion in the church of England. At the prince's desire Palmer corresponded with the ladies, the younger of whom he induced to return to the Russian church. His claim for admission to communion in the Russian church, pressed for nearly a year, was at length rejected by Filaret, Metropolitan of Moscow. On his return to England in the autumn of 1841, Palmer submitted to Bishop Charles James Blomfield, as ordinary of continental chaplains, the question which Archbishop Howley had ducked, and received an affirmative answer. Second visit to Russia Bent on renewing his application for admission to communion in the Greek church, Palmer early in 1842 visited Paris, and laid the whole case before Bishop Matthew Luscombe, in whose chapel the Princess Galitzin, then resident in Paris, was in the habit of communicating. He had several interviews with the princess, but failed to alter her views. Bishop Luscombe refused, however, to furnish her with a certificate of communion on the eve of her departure for Russia, and thus Palmer on his return to St. Petersburg was able to exclude her from communion in the English chapel there. Palmer's second application for admission to communion in the Russian church, supported by letters from Bishop Luscombe and a dissertations of his own on the position of the church of England in Christendom, met an explicit rejection on the part of the Russian church of the Anglican claim to catholicity. The holy governing synod declined to admit him to communion unless he acknowledged the Thirty- nine Articles of religion to be 'in their plain literal sense and spirit' a full and perfect expression of the faith of the churches of England and Scotland, and to contain forty-four heresies; unless he renounced and anathematised the said heresies, the Thirty-nine Articles as containing them and the churches of England and Scotland as implicated in them; and further admitted the Greek church to be the ≈ìcumenical church, and were received into the same as a proselyte. The ≈ìcumenical character of the Greek church Palmer admitted; he also renounced and anathematised the forty-four heresies, but demurred to their alleged presence in the Thirty-nine Articles. On the question whether what he had done amounted to a renunciation of the churches of England and Scotland, he appealed to Bishop Luscombe and the Scottish Episcopal College. Later life Palmer returned to England. Soon after the decision of the privy council in the Gorham case in 1852 Palmer again sought admission to the Greek church, but recoiled before the unconditional rebaptism to which he was required to submit. On the eve of the Crimean War he studied the question of the Holy Places at Jerusalem. The winter of 1853‚Äì4 he passed in Egypt. He went into retreat under Carlo Passaglia at Rome, and there was received into the Roman church, the rite of baptism being dispensed with, in the chapel of the Roman College on 28 February 1855. When William Walsham How, later the Bishop of Wakefield, visited Rome in 1865 he came across Palmer and wrote as follows:‚ÄòBishop Walsham How, A Memoir‚Äô by Frederick How, 1898 151 Via Bambino, Rome, 24 March. ‚Äò I am going this evening to a friend to be introduced to Mr. Wm. Palmer, the Vert.' He is a very dangerous man, being very learned and a most unflinching champion of Rome. I want to get him to take us over some of the Catacombs, to which he is about the best guide here. He is not the Wm. Palmer who wrote the Church History, but ' Deacon Palmer,' as he used to be called, because he never would take priest's orders in our Church. He was at one time very nearly joining the Greek Church. I certainly do not feel the least attracted by Rome as a system here, and I imagine it is really made much more attractive to English ideas in England. P.S. (Annunciation.) We went last night to tea, as I said, and met Mr. Palmer. There was no one there but the lady who asked us, and another clergyman and his wife. Mr. Palmer . . . abused the Church of England, and said very hard things. He sadly wanted some one of age, talent and authority enough to put him down. However, on some subjects he was interesting and pleasant enough. The chief thing I fought him on was his attempt to defend the absurd assertion of some Romish manual that the Times is the organ of the Anglican Church. He tried to make out that it fairly represented the dominant spirit of the Church.‚Äô For the rest of his life Palmer resided at Rome in the Piazza di Santa Maria in Campitelli, where he died on 4 April 1879, in his sixty-eighth year. His remains were interred (8 April) in the cemetery of S. Lorenzo in Campo Verano. Works During his stay in St. Petersburg Palmer edited R. W. Blackmore's translation of Andrei Nikolaevich Muraviev's History of the Church in Russia, Oxford, 1842. Too late to defend Tract XC, he rebutted a charge of \\"Romanism\\" levelled at himself (in his Letter to Charles Pourtales Golightly, and his Letter to a Protestant-Catholic, both published at Oxford in 1841; and his Letter to Renn Dickson Hampden, Oxford, 1842). His Protest against Prusso- Anglican Protestantism, which he lodged with Archbishop Howley in reference to the recently established Anglican-German Bishopric in Jerusalem, was, at the archbishop's request, withheld from publication. He issued, however, its notes and appendices as Aids to Reflection on the seemingly Double Character of the Established Church, Oxford, 1841, and treated the same topic in an anonymous work.Examination of an Announcement made in the Prussian State Gazette concerning the \\"Relations of the Bishop of the United Church of England and Ireland in Jerusalem\\" with the German Congregation of the Evangelical Religion in Palestine, Oxford, 1842. On his second return to England Palmer occupied himself with his Harmony of Anglican Doctrine with the Doctrine of the Eastern Church (Aberdeen, 1846; Greek translation, Athens, 1851) and in the preparation of his case for the Scottish Episcopal College. An Appeal to the Scottish Bishops and Clergy, and generally to the Church of their Communion, Edinburgh, 1849, was dismissed unheard by the Scottish Episcopal Synod assembled in Edinburgh on 7 September 1849. In 1853 appeared his 'Dissertations on Subjects relating to the Orthodox or Eastern-Catholic Communion,' London. In later life, and in poor health, Palmer made antiquarian researches in ecclesiastical history. He left voluminous manuscripts, mainly autobiographical. John Henry Newman, to whom he used to pay an annual visit at Birmingham, edited after his death his Notes of a Visit to the Russian Church in the Years 1840, 1841, London, 1882. Palmer was author also of: * ‚ÄòShort Poems and Hymns, the latter mostly Translations,‚Äô Oxford, 1843. * Œ§Œ±œÄŒµŒπŒΩ·Ω¥ ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÜŒøœÅ·Ω∞ œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ¨œÅœáŒ±ŒπœÇ, Athens, 1850. * ŒîŒπŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ≤Œ±·Ω∂ œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºàŒ≥Œ≥ŒªŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ ·ºòŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØas, Athens, 1851. * ŒîŒπŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ≤Œ±·Ω∂ œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·øÜœÇ Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøŒªŒπŒ∫·øÜœÇ ·ºêŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØas, Athens, 1852. * ‚ÄòRemarks on the Turkish Question,‚Äô London, 1858. * ‚ÄòAn Introduction to Early Christian Symbolism; being the Description of a Series of Fourteen Compositions from Fresco-paintings, Glasses, and Sculptured Sarcophagi; with three Appendices,‚Äô London, 1859; new edition, under the title ‚ÄòEarly Christian Symbolism: a Series of Compositions,‚Äô &c.;, ed.

The authors say that \\"our goal in writing this book is to demystify quantum theory\\". Starting with the concepts of wave‚Äìparticle duality and a non-technical description of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the book explains the uncertainty principle, energy levels in atoms, the physics of semi-conductors and transistors, and the Standard Model of particle physics. A more mathematical Epilogue discusses the role of quantum mechanics in models of stellar evolution, and derives the Chandrasekhar limit for the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf.

Sawin Millett Jr. (born October 8, 1937) is a Maine politician. A Republican, Millett served as the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services in the administration of Governor Paul LePage from 2011 to 2014. In January 2011, Millett was unanimously approved as Commissioner by the Maine Senate, with key Democrats also endorsing his appointment. In December 2011, a poll of policymakers by the Bangor Daily News ranked Millett as the ninth most influential person in Maine politics. Government career Millett served in the administrations of four separate governors (Longley, McKernan, King and LePage) with two different political affiliations (two Independents and two Republicans). Millett advanced in the field of education until he became commissioner of education for Maine's first independent governor, James Longley. He was appointed to the position in 1975 at the age of 37 and served until 1979. In 1979, Republican Governor John McKernan appointed Millett Commissioner of the state finance department. During his time in the McKernan administration, the government was shut down due to the inability to agree on a budget. He also served from 1995 to 2000 as Associate Commissioner of the Department of Mental Health/Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services for Independent Angus King. In 2011, Millett was unanimously confirmed as Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services by the Maine Senate after being selected by Republican Paul LePage. Millett announced his retirement on April 3, 2014, to be effective on May 30. He stated he wanted to spend more time with his family and in his hometown. Governor LePage praised his service and knowledge of state budgeting. Millett retired in May 2014 and was replaced by Richard Rosen. Legislative career Millett first served in the legislature from 1969 to 1972. In 2002, Millett won a seat in the Maine House of Representatives. Unable to run for his seat again in 2010, he challenged John Patrick for Senate District 14 and was defeated. In 2018, he won election to the Maine House of Representatives from District 71. Personal Millett was born in Waterford, Maine in Oxford County, Maine and his amily settled on a farm in Dixmont in Penobscot County when he was in fourth grade. Millett's father was a superintendent of schools and his mother was primarily a homemaker. He was one of five boys in his family. Millett, despite being an avid baseball fan and having lived his entire life in Maine, became a supporter of the St. Louis Cardinals during the 1946 World Series in which the Cardinals beat the Boston Red Sox. He graduated from Carmel High School in Carmel, Maine in 1955 and attended the same college as his father, Bates College. After graduating, he returned to Penobscot County and began teaching at Hermon High School. He continued teaching in the district until 1971. In 1977, while serving as Commissioner of Education, Millett and his wife bought a home in Manchester, Maine to cut down on his daily commute for work in Augusta, but the couple disliked living in a subdivision so much that he and his wife bought 25 acres of land next to his parents farm in Waterford and built a house to live in. He could barely stand to address the Maine Senate during his 2011 confirmation hearing due to an infection after knee replacement surgery. Shortly after being appointed commissioner, Millett had to miss work due to a second infection in his knee; he was temporarily replaced by Ryan Low, who had served as Commissioner of Finance under Democrat John Baldacci. Low said of Millett \\"I would do just about anything for him...There's no one more of an expert on budgeting and legislative process; but even more than that, he's a genuinely nice person.\\" References 1937 births Living people Maine Republicans Members of the Maine House of Representatives People from Dixmont, Maine Bates College alumni LePage Administration cabinet members People from Waterford, Maine Schoolteachers from Maine ","title":"Sawin Millett"},{"id":"34237260","title":"Champion (Clemens song)"},{"id":"34237263","text":"Luk√°≈° Dlouh√Ω and Paul Hanley were the defending champions but decided not to participate together.

George Edwards was the son of a carpenter John Edwards and his wife Elizabeth Brown, as stated in his baptism certificate in the parish of Saint Leonard's of London. George ‚ÄúJorge‚Äù Edwards Brown was an English sailor who later lived and served in Chile. He was the founder and patriarch of the Edwards family in Chile. He sailed from a young age in British ships engaged in trade and privateering or looting. He travelled across Spanish South America visiting Chile for the first time in 1797. It was not until 1804 that his name could be inscribed in the history of Chile. The previous year he had enlisted as a surgeon in the British raider ‚ÄúBlackhouse‚Äù or ‚ÄúBacar‚Äù who were dedicated to looting and plundering ships and ports in the Spanish colonies in South America. During this trip, Bacar anchored in the bay of Coquimbo and then taken by assault the city which was unguarded. During the sack of the city Jorge Edwards entered the house of Diego de Ossand√≥n to steal, but he found his daughter, Isabel de Ossand√≥n, who he fell in love with immediately. He decided to desert the ship and asking for shelter in the house of Diego Ossand√≥n. Family tradition says that when Edwards did not return to the British ship, they spent three days looking for him through all the houses in the city. Edwards hid for three days, hiding in a barrel of wine from his former shipmates. On the third day Spanish reinforcements arrived, forcing the British to retreat from the city, to continue their raids to the north. Once the Spanish authorities were aware of the presence of Edwards in La Serena, he was arrested and sent to Callao, where he was detained. Once released he returned to La Serena in 1805 he was baptized into the Catholic faith. The baptism certificate recognizes that parents are Juan Eduardos (John Edwards) and Isabel Pardo (Elizabeth Brown), Spanish forms of their Welsh and English names respectively. After that he went to work as a doctor and surgeon for some years, but quickly became the enabler or lender of small miners in the area of Coquimbo, which allowed him to build a small fortune after 10 years. His distinctly anti-Spanish feelings made him a supporter of the patriot cause during the Chilean Wars of Independence, making donations to build the fleet for the liberation of Peru, commanded by a fellow Brit, Lord Thomas Cochrane. The Supreme Director of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins granted Edwards Chilean citizenship papers in 1818 as a reward for his services to the Independence cause. He was appointed Deputy for Huasco in 1822. He was President of the Provincial Assembly of Coquimbo in 1825, Deputy for Andacollo in 1826 and Deputy of Vallenar in 1834.

Ch√°vez Aliaga played a substantial role in the establishment of Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana, the largest political party in Peru from 1930 to the late 1980s, as well as being the publisher of an influential newspaper El Peru. In his later life he served in various political offices including Secretario del Congresso and Secretary General of the Presidency of the Republic (1956-1962).Ch√°vez, A. N. (1973).

Lima: Librer√≠a Editorial \\"Minerva\\" Miraflores.http://sucremus.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/personajes-nazario-chavez- aliaga.html  Biography  He was born on September 22, 1891 in the town of Huauco (now named Sucre) in the province of Celendin in Cajamarca, Per√∫. He was professor of literature and Spanish in Colegio San Ram√≥n in Cajamarca. In addition to his teaching, Chavez Aliaga was a journalist and in 1923 started to edit the newspaper El Obrero. This newspaper highlighted ideas of the working class and due to this was closed by the government of Augusto B. Legu√≠a. In spite of this three years later in 1926, Ch√°vez Aliaga returned to journalism as editor of a new newspaper called El Per√∫ which was first published on 28 July 1926. This newspaper allowed Ch√°vez Aliaga to reach the people of Cajamarca both socially and politically. El Per√∫'s content was mixed in that it included articles in favour of policies of Legu√≠a while at the same time reprinted articles by Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui from his Amauta magazine. One of these articles that Mari√°tegui sent to Ch√°vez Aliaga was titled 'On the problem of the Indian'. El Per√∫ showed a clear indigenous tendency and printed articles favoring the protection of the workers and artisans of Cajamarca. Through this newspaper Ch√°vez Aliaga expanded his leadership role in the political arena and highlighted stories such as the restructuring of the most important guild in Cajamarca: The Free Society of Artisans. He also participated in the creation of the Workers Society of Halgayoc, the Workers Society of Bambamarca, the Fraternal Society of Workers in Hualgayoc, and others. It was around these years that a young Victor Ra√∫l Haya de la Torre brought forth his progressive ideas to create a political party that reached all the corners of Per√∫. He thus reached out to Ch√°vez Aliaga who was a key political leader in Cajamarca. De la torre knew of Ch√°vez Aliaga from his newspaper and through Antenor Orrego. In 1929, Ch√°vez Aliaga was invited to become the general secretary of the Peruvian Aprista Party (APRA) in Cajamarca. He actively promoted the ideas of APRA and participated in uprisings in favor of workers and farmers in the region. Ch√°vez Aliaga became Prefect of Cajamarca. Following a particular uprising, there was a severing of relations between Ch√°vez Aliaga and de la Torre. In a final letter written to Haya de la Torre, Ch√°vez Aliaga indicates that he was left behind by the APRA leader to face government troops without support while de la Torre sailed away. There was a feeling of betrayal as evidenced by this letter. Later, Ch√°vez Aliaga joined the Prado Democratic Movement under the leadership of the eventual president of Per√∫ Manuel Prado Ugarteche. Ch√°vez Aliaga became (1939 - 1945) the Secretary as well as Advisor to the Council of Ministers of the Presidency. In 1950 he was elected to Congress as representative (diputado) from the province of Cutervo; furthermore, he took the post of Secretary for the Chamber of Representatives (C√°mara de Diputados). For Manuel Prado Ugarteche's second government (1959 - 1962), Ch√°vez Aliaga was nominated Secretary General of the Presidency of the Republic. He died on November 14, 1978 in Lima, Per√∫.  Family  He was married to Teresa Silva Santisteban of Cajamarca. His sons were: Pompeyo Ch√°vez, Romulo Ch√°vez, Ra√∫l Ch√°vez, Carlos M. Ch√°vez; his daughters were: Blanca Ch√°vez, Fabiola Ch√°vez, Josefina Ch√°vez, Ana Mar√≠a Ch√°vez, and Teresa del Socorro Ch√°vez.

He was also a General Secretary of National Sports Committee of Indonesia (KONI), under the leadership of Agum Gumelar and Regional Board of PSSI North Sumatra. He was an active professor in the Islamic University of North Sumatra and expert staff in the Ministry of Youth and Sports. In his youth, he was also a footballer and football referee in the national level. He was chosen as chairman of PSSI in the extraordinary congress of PSSI on 9 July 2011 in Surakarta.  Footballing career  The young Djohar was a player for PSL Langkat in the period from 1968 to 1969. His career then continued to the higher level in the country, PSMS Medan from 1973 to 1976. After his retirement, he became a football referee, both for national and international from 1976 to 1987. He was also a match inspector for the national football. In 2000, he worked with PSSI Branch North Sumatra Region. In 2003, he became the general secretary of the KONI. In 2011, Djohar was chosen to become the chairman of PSSI as a result of the extraordinary congress of PSSI in Surakarta. His tenure in PSSI was marred by denunciation by the end of 2011, as a new league called IPL (Indonesian Premier League) was formed to replace ISL (Indonesia Super League) made by the previous regime as the top league. It was known as Indonesian football dualism where two different leagues competed as top leagues and did not recognize each other. The rebellious illegal football association named Indonesian Football Savior Committee (KPSI), led by La Nyalla Mattalitti and packed with most people for the previous regime successfully threatened most national team players, who played in the now KPSI-run ISL, to stay away from the FIFA-sanctioned national team. They even made their own \\"national team\\", playing in some friendly matches against amateur sides in Australia. The team was packed with those ISL players, namely Cristian Gonz√°les, Firman Utina, and former national captain Ponaryo Astaman, and was coached by former national coach Alfred Riedl. This forced PSSI to replace all the senior players in the national team with players from IPL. PSSI sent the newly made national team to Riffa to face Bahrain national football team for 2014 World Cup qualifier on 29 February 2012 only to be defeated 0‚Äì10. It is the worst defeat for Indonesia national football team since the team's first international appearance in 1934. The same reason forced the team to be filled by mostly non-ISL players during the 2012 AFF Championship. Only one ISL player accepted the national team call-up. He was former national captain Bambang Pamungkas, who wanted to mark this tournament as his last for the national team. Despite being eliminated in the group stage and suffered their worst-ever record in the AFF Championship ‚Äî particularly due to a draw against Laos, which usually get beaten by Indonesia ‚Äî they successfully record their first AFF Championship victory against Singapore with one goal from Andik Vermansyah. Singapore would gone on to win their fourth AFF Championship title later in the tournament.

On each occasion, the rebels were defeated by Burgundian forces commanded by Charles the Bold and the city was twice burned to the ground. Causes Louis de Bourbon, dating to 1465. Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy had become ruler of large parts of the Low Countries in the first half of the 15th century, to that extent that these were now called the Burgundian Netherlands. In 1456, Philip tried to expand his influence to the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. Through his excellent relations with Pope Callixtus III, he had Prince-Bishop John of Heinsberg deposed, and replaced by his 18-year-old nephew Louis de Bourbon. De Bourbon continued his studies at the University of Leuven for 7 more years, while Philip ruled de facto over Li√®ge. Wars =First Li√®ge war (1465)= In the meantime, the resistance to the Burgundians in the Prince-Bishopric grew. The leader was Raes van Heers, bailiff of Heers. He contacted King Louis XI of France, who pledged his support. When Louis de Bourbon finally took up his functions in the Prince-Bishopric in 1465, he was immediately deposed by the States of Li√®ge. Raes van Heers was unable to control the rebellious populace, which plundered Lands of Overmaas which belonged to the Duke of Burgundy. Philip the Good sent an army, under command of his son Charles the Bold, to Li√®ge to restore his authority. Raes van Heers assembled an army of 4,000 men, mostly civilians and confronted Charles the Bold at the Battle of Montenaken on 20 October 1465. The battle was a clear victory for the Burgundians. Burgundian forces went on to occupy Sint-Truiden, where the Peace of Sint- Truiden was signed. Under the terms of the agreement, Li√®ge lost all its rights and Louis of Bourbon was reinstated as Prince-Bishop. =Second Li√®ge war (1467)= The unrest in Li√®ge did not abate. In 1466, the city of Dinant, to the south-west, rebelled and Philip the Good again sent troops, commanded by Charles the Bold, who punished the city by casting 800 burghers into the river Meuse and burnt the city. When Philip died in 1467, unrest broke out in the city of Li√®ge and Louis of Bourbon was forced to flee to Huy, to the west. Even there, his position was not secure and he was forced to flee the Prince- Bishopric together with all the Burgundians. Again, Raes van Heers and Count Jan de Wilde of Kessenich raised an army to confront Charles the Bold. The reinforcements promised by Louis XI of France again didn't materialise, and the troops of Li√®ge were decisively defeated in the Battle of Brustem on 28 October 1467. After the battle, Charles moved on Li√®ge and forced the city to surrender on 12 November. The Prince-Bishopric became a Burgundian protectorate under Guy of Humbercourt, and all cities in the County of Loon were forced to tear down their defences. =Third Li√®ge war (1468)= Depiction of the sack of Li√®ge in 1468 by Barth√©lemy Vieillevoye (1842) Still, the people of Li√®ge refused to accept Burgundian rule. In October 1468, 240 rebels, under Jean de Wilde, Vincent de Bueren, and Gosuin de Streel, invaded the city. In the confusion, Guy of Humbercourt and the entire Burgundian garrison fled. Li√®ge was free again and Jean de Wilde occupied the Prince- Bishops' palace. One night, a Li√®ge militia attacked Tongeren and killed all Burgundians there. After this, Jean de Wilde opened negotiations with Guy of Humbercourt. But Charles the Bold had other plans: he led an army towards Li√®ge to deal once and for all with the rebellious city. He was accompanied by Louis XI of France. Several cities on their path were plundered, including Tongeren. On 22 October, a 500-strong militia that tried to stop the Burgundians at the village of Lantin were driven into the church and burned alive. Vincent de Bueren organised the defence of the city of Li√®ge and achieved some successes with hit-and-run sorties. Jean de Wilde was mortally wounded during the raid of 26 October and died two days later. Best known is the attack by the six hundred Franchimontois in the night of 29‚Äì30 October, who sneaked out of the city and attacked the sleeping Burgundians, with the aim of killing the Duke and the King. The plan failed and all 600, including Vincent de Bueren and Gosuin de Streel, were killed. The next day, Li√®ge surrendered, and at the command of Charles the Bold, hundreds of Li√®gois were tied together and thrown into the Meuse river. The city was set alight and is said to have burned for seven weeks. End of Burgundian rule Perron, the symbol of local autonomy, in 1478 after the end of Burgundian rule. In 1477, Charles the Bold was killed in the Battle of Nancy and was succeeded by his only heir, his nineteen-year-old daughter Mary of Burgundy. Mary was immediately attacked by France and turned for help to the States-General of the Netherlands. The help was given, but Mary had to concede the Great Privilege, abandoning the centralized policies of her father and grandfather. Li√®ge also benefited from this, and Mary renounced her rights to the Prince- Bishopric on 19 March 1477. Louis of Bourbon remained Prince-Bishop until he was murdered on 30 August 1482 by William de La Marck, who was supported by Louis XI of France. Legacy The Wars of Li√®ge were re-worked in later historiography to reflect a struggle for local freedoms and autonomy, reflected in the Perron of Li√®ge and its inclusion into the coat of arms of the town. The failed attack of the 600 Franchimontois was later mythologized and celebrated as an example of Walloon heroism, equivalent to the Flemish defeat of the Kingdom of France at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302.

Phillips Oppenheim and published in 1920. German Leopold von Ragastein meets his doppelganger, Englishman Everard Dominey, in Africa, and plans to murder him and steal his identity to spy on English high society just prior to World War I. However, doubts of the returned Dominey's true identity begin to arise in this tale of romance, political intrigue, and a (literally) haunting past. Plot summary In German East Africa, Englishman Everard Dominey awakens to his doppelganger host, German Leopold von Ragastein. They spend the night drinking and sharing their dark pasts. The next day, Leopold and Dr. Schmidt devise a plan to make Everard disappear in the wilderness so that Leopold can assume his identity and fulfill his mission for the German government. The story then shifts abruptly to England. The reader follows the story of Everard without knowing if Leopold is posing as Everard or not. In London, Everard settles into his former life. His wife, Lady Rosamund Dominey, believes that Everard killed Roger Unthank, his rival for her attentions, just before leaving for Africa; Roger has not been seen since Everard's departure. Princess Stephanie Eiderstrom believes at first sight that Everard is actually Leopold and threatens to expose him unless he agrees to a rendezvous with her. Everard speaks with Mr. Seaman and reveals that Leopold had been banished to Africa for killing a Hungarian prince, the husband of his lover Princess Eiderstrom. Everard sends Seaman to inform the princess that they cannot meet until he has accomplished his mission disguised as Everard. Seaman, in turn, tells Everard that his mission is to monitor the German Ambassador, Prince Terniloff. Princess Eiderstrom informs Terniloff that Everard is Leopold in disguise. Prince Terniloff hopes that Leopold's mission is designed to maintain international peace and he assures the Prince that that is so. At the Dominey estate, Mrs. Unthank accuses Everard of murdering her son, a murder Rosamund wants to avenge by killing her husband. She thinks Roger's ghost haunts the manor weekly. That night, Everard wakes to discover his wife holding a knife to his throat and she flees. She summons him to her room the next day; she has lost her desire to kill him, but cannot understand why. Everard visits her doctor, who explains that Mrs. Unthank is bad for Rosamund's health. He says that Rosamund's sanity depends on Everard's actions alone. Rosamund is sent to a mental hospital. Mr. Seaman tells Everard that he has been summoned to meet with Kaiser Wilhelm II. Everard confronts Mrs. Unthank and makes her leave the manor. In Germany, the Kaiser reminds Everard of Germany's intention to start a war, insists that he stay close to Terniloff, and promises to rescind his exile if his mission in England succeeds. Back in England, Princess Eiderstrom brings Everard a letter from the Kaiser, who insists that Everard marry her. He refuses because it would reveal his identity and because he loves Rosamund, who just returned from the mental hospital after ten years away. Rosamund now believes that the Everard is not her real husband. Everard and a hunting party explore Black Wood and find that the ghost has left tracks. Prince Terniloff and Princess Eiderstrom continue to berate Everard about his role as spy. A message from Dr. Schmidt announces that the real Everard may be alive. Seaman immediately recognises the messenger as the spy Johann Wolff and wonders why a German spy would check up on them. Wolff disappears in the night. Princess Eiderstrom tells Everard that she faces only an unfeeling simulacrum of Leopold. Mr. Seaman persuades her to maintain her silence, and she vows to leave for Africa. Seaman also believes that Wolff was abducted, and he leaves for London to investigate. Six months later, Everard and Rosamund dine together in London, where Seaman has summoned Everard. She loves her husband but believes he loved her more than the returned Everard. Seaman tells them that English spies probably took Wolff and shows Everard a map of the Kaiser‚Äôs dream of a German European empire and tells him that their goal is to keep England out of the coming war until France falls. Seaman gives Everard the map for safekeeping. World War I begins. The Ambassador calls Everard to apologise for being wrong in believing that Germany would not start a war. He gives Everard his memoirs of his experience in England. Everard then goes to Rosamund and tells her that he regrets to inform her that he must fight for his country. Everard commissions a group of lumberjacks to destroy Black Wood, and Mrs. Unthank watches them. Everard accuses her of driving his wife to insanity, creating the howling ghost of Roger Unthank, and victimising an attempted murderer. She questions his identity. Everard spends the night outside his own house, waiting for the ghost of Roger Unthank. It appears, and Everard discovers that the howling, haunting ghost of Roger Unthank was a half-mad Roger Unthank. He is not dead, but has been hiding in Black Wood and terrorising the Domineys with the help of his mother. Seaman returns from London. Princess Eiderstrom returns from Africa with Doctor Schmidt, who immediately recognises Everard as the original Everard Dominey. Everard reveals that he killed Leopold von Ragastein when he learned of his plan. He is the reason Wolff disappeared ‚Äì Wolff knew the truth and was trying to inform Seaman ‚Äì and he has delivered both the map and the memoirs to the English government. Seaman and Schmidt are arrested, Eiderstrom leaves in disgrace, and Everard is left with his wife, who now acknowledges him as her true husband. Characters =Major characters= * Everard Dominey ‚Äì a thirty-six-year-old English baronet with a history of debt, drunkenness, and violence * Leopold von Ragastein ‚Äì full title Major-General Baron Leopold von Ragastein, currently exiled because he killed his ex-lover's husband * Rosamund Dominey ‚Äì the insane wife of Everard Dominey, renowned for her youth and beauty * Princess Stephanie Eiderstrom ‚Äì a Hungarian Princess and Leopold von Ragastein's ex-lover * Mr. Seaman ‚Äì German spy, partner of the returned Everard Dominey =Minor characters= * Roger Unthank ‚Äì the missing (presumed dead) rival of Everard Dominey * Duke Henry ‚Äì prominent English politician behind the anti-German movement * Duchess Caroline ‚Äì wife of Henry, cousin of Everard, and high-society hostess * Ambassador Terniloff ‚Äì German ambassador to England; works towards peace and understanding between the two nations * Mrs. Unthank ‚Äì the mother of Roger Unthank and attendant of Rosamund Dominey * Dr. Harrison ‚Äì Rosamund Dominey's live-in doctor * Johann Wolff ‚Äì a German spy who disappears halfway through the book Themes =World War I= The majority of this novel takes place just before the start of World War I, which takes place in chapter 27. The political intrigues of the novel ‚Äì the initial spy mission for von Ragastein, the fights between Mr. Seaman and Duke Henry, and the presence of Ambassador Terniloff, among others ‚Äì are focused entirely on the struggle between the British and the Germans, with Great Britain as the \\"good\\" side and Germany the \\"bad\\" one. =The dark wilderness= Another main theme in the book is the metamorphosing capacities of the dark wilderness. Roger Unthank goes to Black Wood after a traumatic event, and returns years later a crazed man. Everard Dominey goes to Africa after a traumatic event, and returns years later a new, reformed man. Both Lady Dominey and Princess Eiderstrom propose, at various points during the impersonation, that their true lovers were left behind in Africa, and what returned is a false similarity.

Education  In 1961 Anne Rasa graduated with Bachelor of Science (Hons.) from the Royal College of Science, Imperial College, London University. Subsequently, she received a NATO-scholarship to investigate the aggression of fish. In 1965 she graduated with Master of Science (M.Sc.) from the University of Hawaii. In 1970 Rasa received her Ph.D. from London University with a Max-Planck-Scholarship on coral reef fish aggression under Konrad Lorenz.  Scientific work  From 1970-1974 she continued her work at the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Verhaltenspsychologie in Seewiesen under Konrad Lorenz. During this period she started her Dwarf mongoose studies, concentrating on social structure, marking behavior and intra-group aggression. From 1975-1981 she was scientific assistant at Marburg University, Germany. She focused on ontogeny of behavior in Dwarf mongoose and was awarded the Dr. habil. (Habilitation: qualified as a professor) in 1981. From 1981-1986 she was working with University of Bayreuth, Germany, with a Heisenberg-Scholarship to accomplished her field studies on Dwarf mongoose in the Taru Desert, Kenya. Anne Rasa published the results of her studies in the book Mongoose Watch: A Family Observed with a foreword by Konrad Lorenz. He compares the significance of her works with those of Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey.Anne E. Rasa: Die perfekte Familie. DVA 1985, p. 8-9.

Migration history Migration from Thailand to Canada has gradually increased since the 1950s, when a few Thai students first came to study at Canadian universities. Migration has since continued at a slow pace, with a brief increase after the 1997 financial crisis in Thailand, which resulted in more Thais looking for work and educational opportunities overseas. Thai immigrants who choose to remain in Canada have generally immigrated to study, to take up a business, or to marry a Canadian. Many of them claim that they did not originally intend to stay in Canada. According to the 1991 census, there were 5,820 immigrants born in Thailand; 2,900 whose first language spoken at home was the Thai language; and 2,770 who claimed that they were of Thai ethnic origin.Migration, Arrival, and Settlement - Thai \\", Multicultural Canada The larger figure for immigrants is explained by the fact that a certain number are likely ethnic Chinese and perhaps Lao from Thailand. Thai couples and small groups have settled primarily in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal. There are substantially more Thai women than men in the country (1,775 women and 480 men). While most are professionals, students, or have married Canadian men, there are occasional instances of young women entering the country as artists and entertainers, or as visitors who become afterward legit Canadians by marrying or contributing to the culture in one way or another. Some are bilingual and, like many immigrants, speak the language more clearly than some natives. Some Thais in Canada work in the restaurant industry and Thai cuisine, known for its balance between sweet, sour, salty and spicy flavours, and for its use of fresh herbs, coconut milk and galangal root. This cuisine has become popular in Canada, particularly in urban areas. One notable example of a Thai in this industry is internationally acclaimed chef Sasi Meechai-Lim, who resides in Toronto, where she has opened several restaurants. Employment Thai immigrants to Canada are primarily well-educated professionals working as bankers, dentists, doctors, nurses, computer technicians and engineers. Many of them opened businesses such as Thai restaurants or Muay Thai gyms, which have become popular in Canada. Generally, they have been economically successful in Canada and have contributed to the Canadian economy. In recent years, some Thais have come to Canada as live-in caregivers. Despite having positive bilateral relations, the Canadian Government discontinued its Work Experience Program (now known as the International Experience Canada program) to Thais. Work and study permits, as well as temporary resident visas, are seldom issued to Thai nationals from the Canadian embassy based in Thailand. A very small number of Thai nationals have become permanent residents and settled in Canada. Organizations The Thai Community Association of British Columbia, formed in 1986, is officially registered as a community organization. It sponsors a variety of events, offers Thai language classes when there is a need, and produces newsletters in Thai at irregular intervals. The Friends of Thailand, formed in 1988, is open to interested non-Thai Canadians, although its members also include many Thai with Canadian spouses. Its goal is to help Canadians understand and appreciate Thai culture. In Toronto, about ten families formed the Thai Association of Canada in 1983, but they soon reduced their mandate to Ontario. The group organizes social events, such as summer picnics and New Year's parties, and arranges for Thai language classes. Thai Buddhist Association, which has been meeting informally for many years, has been dedicated to maintaining the Thai Buddhist tradition in Canada. In 1992, a Christian church in East Vancouver was converted to be Vancouver's first Thai temple, founded by the senior monk Luang Pho Viriyang. In 1993, a building on the outskirts of Toronto was purchased and dedicated to become the second Thai Buddhist Yanviriya temple. In 2013, there were six Thai Buddhist temples, two Buddhist monasteries, and two meditation societies across Canada. These have become important for Thai-Canadians for religious and cultural practices, building community, and maintaining cultural identity.

History Arms of Fowell of Fowelscombe In the time of William Pole (died 1635), the manor of Fowelscombe comprised the estates of Bolterscombe, Smythescombe and Black Hall, situated in the parishes of Ugborough and North Huish.Pole, p.315 ;Fowell :The earliest member of the Fowell (alias Foghill, Foel, etc.) family identified by William Pole (who did not record his first name) was an attorney during the reign of King Henry IV (1399‚Äì1413).Pole, p.316 His eventual successor Sir Thomas Fowell (born 1453), a member of the King's court, is recorded as being born at Fowelscombe, implying that there was a house on this site before that date. His eventual successor William Fowell (died 1507)Vivian, p.369 of Fowelscombe was a member of parliament for Totnes in Devon in 1455. His great-grandfather Thomas Fowell of Fowelscombe is the earliest member of the family recorded in the pedigree submitted by the family for the 1620 Heraldic visitation of Devon. :The grandson of William Fowell (died 1507) was Thomas Fowell (died 1544) (son of Thomas Fowell by his wife a member of the Bevil family of Cornwall) who in 1537 rebuilt the manor house at Fowelscombe. His great-grandson Richard Fowell (died 1594) of Fowelscombe had four sons, one of whom was William Fowell (1556‚Äì1636) who founded the junior branch of the family seated at Black Hall (within the manor of Fowelscombe) in the parish of North Huish. :The grandson and eventual heir of Richard Fowell (died 1594) was Sir Edmund Fowell, 1st Baronet (1593‚Äì1674), of Fowelscombe, also lord of the manor of Ludbrooke in the parish of Ugborough,Risdon, pp.385, 179 created a baronet in 1661. He married Margaret Poulett, a daughter of Sir Anthony Poulett (1562‚Äì1600). His eldest son and heir was Sir John Fowell, 2nd Baronet (1623‚Äì1677) who married Elizabeth Chichester (died 1678), a daughter of Sir John Chichester (1598‚Äì1669) of Hall, Bishop's Tawton.Vivian, p.177, pedigree of Chichester :The second Baronet's son and heir was Sir John Fowell, 3rd Baronet (1665‚Äì1692), Member of Parliament for Totnes (1689‚Äì1692), who died unmarried aged 26, when the baronetcy became extinct. His heirs were his two surviving sisters, Elizabeth and Margaret who until 1711 held the Fowell estates of Fowelscombe and Ludbrooke jointly. In 1679 Elizabeth married George Parker (1651‚Äì1743)Vivian, p.370; p.588, pedigree of Parker of Boringdon and North Molton, both in Devon. The marriage was without children. Margaret married Arthur Champernowne of Dartington in 1679,Vivian, p.370 and was the mother of Arthur Champernowne (died 1717) of Dartington, MP for Totnes.Vivian, p.164, pedigree of Champernowne ;Champernowne :In 1711 a division of the estates took place, with Fowelscombe going to the Champernowne family, which held it until 1758.Risdon, p.385 ;Herbert :In 1758 Mr Herbert of Plymouth purchased the estate from the Champernownes. The house was enlarged in the 18th century. His son George Herbert sold it to Thomas King in 1780. ;King :The estate was purchased by Thomas King who had interests in the brewing industry and owned property in Plymouth and London.Lauder, p. 119 According to Richard Polwhele (died 1838) King made many improvements to the house, which Meller (2015) interprets as meaning that it was he who enlarged the house beyond the original tower, hall and entrance and added the castellations.Meller, pp. 418‚Äì420 After Thomas King died childless in 1792 the estate was left to his three brothers, John (died 1795), Robert and Richard. In 1807 Robert exchanged his interest in Fowelscombe for Richard's manor of North Huish. After Richard died childless, Fowelscombe was inherited by Robert's eldest son, John in 1811.

Hayford Hall: Hangovers, Erotics, and Modernist Aesthetics, Southern Illinois University, 2005, pp.22‚Äì4 was Master of the South Devon Foxhounds for two years 1827-9, when they were known as \\"Mr. King's Hounds\\", having re-established the pack.Tozer, pp.33‚Äì40 In 1817 he purchased the nearby estate of Hayford, near Buckfastleigh, then a modest farmhouse with 162 acres, and spent a large sum on transforming it into a gentleman's residence and hunting lodge, by the addition of three wings. He borrowed money from Servington Savery (1787‚Äì1856), a solicitor and Receiver of Crown Rents in Modbury.Vivian, p.672, pedigree of Savery In 1838 Savery foreclosed on the mortgage and entered into possession of Fowelscombe and also purchased from King the estate of Hayford. He stripped Fowelscombe of its fittings, including a Jacobean staircase, wooden panelling and a turret clock made in 1810 by Samuel Northcotte of Plymouth, which survives today at Hayford. In 1856 following a lengthy lawsuit, John King recovered possession of Fowelscombe from Savery, but was still in financial difficulties. After his death it was sold in 1865. :In 1836 John King was living in Hampshire and his tenant at Fowelscombe was a Mr Hosking, who looked after his hounds there. Also in 1836 the huntsman, Pinhay, \\"lives in Mr. King's house, at Fowlescombe, without paying rent, and his horse is kept in the stable at the kennel\\".Locke, John, The Game Laws, Comprising All the Acts Now in Force on the Subject..., London, 1840, pp.171‚Äì2 According to Tozer (1916) John King died in 1841, whilst hunting with Mr. Trelawny's hounds on Dartmoor, but according to Podnieks & Chait he died in 1861.Tozer, p.40 :The King family made valuable agricultural improvements at Fowelscombe and other estates in Ugborough and adjoining parishes for which \\"the county is greatly indebted\\".Risdon, 1810 Additions, p.385Vancouver, Charles, General View of the Agriculture of the County of Devon, London, 1808, p.135 They were the last occupants of the manor house and after their departure it fell into ruins sometime between 1860 and 1880, and is today an ivy-clad ruin. ;Later history :In 1890 the estate was bought by Rev. Gordon Walters. In 1919 it was split up and sold, with the remains of Fowelscombe House being included as part of the Bolterscombe estate farm which was sold to Reginald Nicholls. Bolterscombe and the ruins of the house were sold to the Burden family in 1948. :Richard Barker (1946‚Äì2015)\\"Memorial to Richard Barker, 1946 ‚Äì 2015.\\" purchased the estate in 1998 and began a restoration of Bolterscombe Farm, renamed as Fowlescombe Farm. As of 2018 it was an organic farm of nearly 300 acres, known as Fowlescombe. Architecture The main building took the form of a hall house surrounded by parkland and a water garden. Although in ruins, it is Grade II listed. The 17th century stable block was built around a courtyard, which may also have been the location of the kennels for the pack of hounds used for fox and deer hunting. The late 18th century bridge leading to the manor house is also Grade II listed. Notes References ;Sources *Lauder, Rosemary (1997).

The plot is about an American-born Indian woman who has to decide between an arranged marriage and another love. The film was shot in 2011 in and around Washington D.C. and was completed in the end of 2012. Krishna received initial funding and marketing by using crowd funding platforms. Plot Synopsis Arrange to Settle follows the story of Jyothi Srinivasan, an American-born Indian girl whose series of failed relationships finally convinces her to agree to an arranged marriage. Her family introduces her to Vimal Narayan, an Indian boy who is immediately taken with her and proposes. She has hesitancies and her father cautions her about the consequences of changing her mind after invitations are sent, but she commits to going through with the wedding. Life has other plans: After making her commitment, she unexpectedly meets Justin Williamson, an American boy from a white family, and falls in love. Jyothi is torn choosing between following her heart by choosing the life she wants with Justin and honoring her family by following through with her promises to Vimal. Full Story (Spoilers) During the opening credits there is a montage of many men Jyothi dates depicted through one date. There will be natural wipes, which change her date from one guy to another, and the changing of seasons will depict the time passing. Lyle wakes up in bed with Jyothi and breaks up with her. During the weekly dinner with her parents, Jyothis mother hassles her about marriage again. She gives her a hard time about being 30 now and single. She asks her if she can find someone for her. To her surprise, Jyothi says, yes. Her mother gets very excited and tells Jyothis father that he is her witness. Melanie meets Adam at Kickball. Adam and Melanie start a side love story. The girls are heavily involved in the kickball sub-culture, and their different personalities are revealed here. Jyothis mother posts her profile on the matrimonial website and starts screening men for her. Jyothi has conversations with these men and some are very comical. She finally talks to a guy, Vimal that seems decent. They agree to go out. He asks her to pick the place to go, and tells her that he will meet her there. During her date, there is good conversation, but no chemistry. When the bill arrives, she goes for the reach and he lets her pay for half. She seems disappointed. Jyothi goes out with Vimal a few more times and the same pattern continues and there is no chemistry yet. Vimal asks her to marry him after 5 dates and she agrees. Before they make the announcement, her father gives her the opportunity to back out of the wedding. He explains to her that after the invitations go out, that it would bring shame to her family if she backed out. Jyothi confirms that her decision is final. Her parents get very excited and start planning the wedding and invite a 1000 people. When she is out with her girls the man of her dreams, Justin, hits on her. There is instant chemistry. They chat, but she has to leave with Melanie who decides to leave for the night with a hook-up. He has a secret date planned for her since she tells him she is obsessed with Top Chef, takes her to Mike Isabella from Top Chef season six and all-stars new restaurant Graffiato. She has a blast with him and when the check comes he grabs it instantly and pays for the entire thing. She continues to go out with both men. She never tells Justin about her upcoming marriage, because she is confused on what to do. If she breaks the marriage off, Justin might break her heart. If she breaks the marriage then she will be shunned by the Indian community and her family and will probably not have an opportunity to have an arranged marriage again. Preetha and her husband Sid progress in their relationship throughout the film. They get pregnant, and Preetha quits the kickball team and her lifestyle of partying. Melanie drinks more and more and her life gets consumed by random hook-ups and she ends up losing her job due to her lifestyle. Jyothi sees two potential ways her life could go and is at a cross-road. Jyothi tells Justin about her impending marriage, he tells her to just break it off. He doesn't seem to understand how hard it would be for her to do that. Justin comes around and tries to get Jyothi back. Who will Jyothi pick? https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2908172/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl Press and promo A big portion of the press for this film was received due to director Ishu Krishna's usage of crowdfunding to pay for its production. Krishna spoke at a TIVAhttp://www.tivadc.org/ event about crowdfunding. There were two blogs and an article in the Indian Express that used Arrange to Settle as a case study for crowdfunding.

In order to achieve this purpose, they convened a meeting on August 3, 1944 in which they University Council appointed a Constituent that proceeded to elect the rector and informed of the knowledge of the problems of the University, would make the necessary reforms to the statute. The council unanimously appointed Manuel Gual as rector, who set out to perform the actions deemed necessary to resolve the crisis of the university.

In this story two travellers rest from the sun under a plane tree. One of them describes it as useless and the tree protests at this view when they are manifestly benefiting from its shade. The historian Plutarch quotes Themistocles as applying the fable to himself, saying 'that the Athenians did not honour him or admire him, but made, as it were, a sort of plane-tree of him; sheltered themselves under him in bad weather, and as soon as it was fine, plucked his leaves and cut his branches.‚ÄôLives in Dryden's translation But the fable was not included in collections of Aesop's fables in the rest of Europe until the 19th century. One of the first to do so in French was Baron Goswin de Stassart, who included it in his collection of fables, published in 1818 and many times reprinted. There he transposes the scene and makes the travellers a couple of Normandy cider farmers.

Reininger.RECAS√âNS SICHES, Luis (1903-1977); UC3M; 11/09/2014; Philosophy of law In his philosophy of law, he was a disciple of Jose Ortega y Gasset. He described the role of the judiciary as creative, in that it applies the abstractions of law, as formulated by the legislative branch, to specific situations involving ‚Äúthe living and authentic man, with his strengths and weaknesses, with his joys and his sufferings, with his good and his evil.‚Äù Recas√©ns Siches agreed with Francesco Carnelutti that for this reason ‚Äúthe judge is more important than the legislator.‚Äù In his view it was ‚Äúfundamental to make an adequate integration between the theory of values and the sphere of human existence so that they do not have the character of abstract principles.‚Äù For him, the fundamental rights of the individual are founded in the idea of human dignity. For him, law, like tools and scientific theories and musical compositions, is a part of ‚Äúobjectified human life,‚Äù a product of culture in which the dimensions of value, norm, and fact are indissolubly linked. He argued that judges must always interpret laws in a reasonable way, so as to result in the ‚Äúfairer individualization of the general norm.‚Äù He criticized the juridical theory and practice of the nineteenth century for its focus on traditional logic, which he considered invalid for the treatment of ‚Äúpractical problems of human behavior.‚Äù Traditional mathematical logic, he argued, did not constitute the totality of the logos, which aside from embracing logic also embraced the logos of human affairs, i.e. the logic of reasonableness. In this regard, his legal thinking was largely consistent with that of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Benjamin Cardozo, John Dewey, and others.Luis Recasens Siches y su aporte a la filosof√≠a del derecho; Luis Gustavo De la Cruz Mallaupoma; Monografias; He was also preoccupied with the issue of unjust law under totalitarian systems. He denied categorically that the law under such systems could be considered legitimate. Proper law, he wrote, treats human beings ‚Äúas subjects intrinsically endowed with dignity‚Äù and ‚Äúwith autonomy or freedom.‚Äù Hence, laws that are not founded on such a view of humanity are not ‚Äúlegal norms but control techniques similar to those used for dressage or animal training. If they do not recognize the dignity of people, they are not legal norms and therefore they are unfair.‚ÄúLuis Recasens Siches; Pensamiento y cultura; Academic career in Spain On December 20, 1927, he was named a tenured professor in the Philosophy of Law at the University of Santiago.

History The castle is situated on a hill, called the lapel hill, above the historical centre of Matera. In Aragonese style, the castle, with a central male and two lower side towers, one and the other round, scalloped and equipped with loops, was built from 1501 by Giovanni Carlo Tramontano, Count of Matera. The new king of Naples, Ferdinand II, had promised the Materrani not to give the city to any more feudal lords, after that this had already freed itself several times from the feudal yoke paying various ransoms in order to remain free city to autonomous regiment, that is directly dependent on the Crown. Instead the Count sets, which boasted claims against the royal treasury, asked and obtained the Matera County in 1496. The Count soon became enfeebled to the materani because with the passage of time he was replenished with debts, in order to cope with which he taxed the population with heavy taxes. Thus began the construction of the castle, which was situated on a hill dominating the city, outside the city walls, with the purpose of \\"feudal\\" control of the surrounding lands rather than defense of the city itself. It seems that then the construction should have included other defensive towers, one of which was found under the central Piazza Vittorio Veneto in Matera together with other underground environments. For the construction of the castle 25,000 ducats were spent and this weighed even more on the population. It was thus that some citizens, tired of the continuous abuses, gathered hidden behind a rock, which since then was called \\"u pizzon' du mal consigghj\\", that is \\"the stone of bad council\\", and organized the assassination of the \\"tyrant\\" set. On December 29, 1514, the count, who had just left the Cathedral, was assassinated in a side street of the same, which was later eloquently called \\"Way of ransom\\". The castle thus remained unfinished. Since 2008, he has been interested, together with the surrounding park, in restoration works still in progress. Some of these interventions are aimed at the recovery of the moat with the restoration of the tufa walls. The project is financed also thanks to the funds of the Game of the Lotto.

Historical background Tamil-Brahmi is considered to be the earliest script used to write the Tamil language. This was replaced by Vattezhuttu, possibly due to writing on palm-leaves. The relationship between Vattezhuttu and Tamil-Brahmi are inconclusive. Pallava dynasty revision The Pallava court of Mahendravarman I replaced Vattezhuttu with two scripts: Tamil script and Pallava grantha to write Tamil and Sanskrit respectively. Pallava grantha was also divided into early and late forms. Late Pallava grantha is the precursor to the Kawi script. Although, whether the Tamil script emerged during the Pallava dynasty or indeed from Tamil-Brahmi is contested among scholars.

His work was mainly in the folk genre known as gaita zuliana. His compositions are some of the most recognized within the genre. Early life Astolfo Romero was born on February 8, 1950 in the neighborhood of \\"El Empedrao\\" in Maracaibo, Venezuela. He was considered to be a child prodigy, playing several Zulia music instruments including: furro, drums, maracas and charrasca. In 1962, at the age of 12, he joined a child piper group called ‚ÄúLos Invasores‚Äù. By then he had already composed a piece (\\"Zulia\\") which was featured on the regional television channel. Career In 1964 he moved to M√©rida where he founded the groups ‚ÄúLos Bomberos‚Äù, a name inspired by the profession that played at that time, and then ‚ÄúLos Canarios‚Äù. In 1968 he returned to Maracaibo and formed a group called ‚ÄúEstampas Gaiteras‚Äù with whom he recorded the song ‚ÄúLos Parranderos‚Äù. In 1971 Romero was invited to join the group \\"Santanita\\", which already included recognised figures in the genre, including Gladys Vera, Cheo Beceira and Danelo Badell. In 1974 he joined one of the most prestigious groups in gaita zuliana, ‚ÄúCardenales del √âxito‚Äù, where he remained until 1979. During this time he composed his best known pieces, \\"La Negra Cumba Cumba\\" and \\"Barlovento\\". In 1980 he attended ‚ÄúLa Universidad de la Gaita‚Äù. In 1983 he became musical director of ‚ÄúGaiteros de Pillopo‚Äù, which led to him becoming known throughout Venezuela. He recorded some of his best known and remembered compositions with them, including ‚ÄúEntre Palos y Alegr√≠as‚Äù, ‚ÄúUna Florecita‚Äù, ‚ÄúEl Burro‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa Comae‚Äù. In 1992 he founded \\"La Parranda Gaitera\\" with the musicians Pedro Villalobos and Daniel M√©ndez; the group also achieved success as \\"La Flor de la Habana\\". A the same time Romero was working as a composer and arranger for other pipers sets. Later life Romero was founding director of the joint \\"Maragaita\\" and \\"Stars of 2000\\". His last recording (‚ÄúTu Ave Cantora‚Äù with the group ‚ÄúLos Chiquinquire√±os‚Äù), is a prayer to the Virgin of Chiquinquir√°. The piece was originally composed to be sung by Betulio Medina, but a demo was recorded by Romero moments before his death. The recording quality was good enough to allow the recording to be edited to keep his original voice recording. Throughout his career, Romero was awarded with several awards such as the ‚ÄúVirgilio Carruyo‚Äù and ‚ÄúUna Gaita Para el Zulia‚Äù, in its first edition. In 1999 he was awarded as soloist of the year. He was also host of the radio program La Gaita Anta√±ona broadcast by the Zulia station 102.1 FM.

The present 17th century quadrangular mansion was preceded by a multi-gabled, Elizabethan home. Set within gardens, it was destroyed by fire in 1927. History Stoke Edith was the principal manor of Sir Henry Lingen (1612 ‚Äì 1662), Royalist cavalier. He and the resident rector, Henry Rogers, denounced for their political leanings, knew the property could be victimized at any time. Lingen's widow, Alice Pye of the Mynnd, sold the manor in the 1670s to the ironmaster Thomas Foley, who settled it on his second son Paul. Paul obtained licence from James II to empark up to 500 acres at Stoke Edith. After a visit by the leading garden designer, George London, in 1692, the park and gardens were remodelled to his suggestion, and it is likely that pleasure grounds would have been laid out around the house in a series of formal compartments with geometric walks, flower-beds and fountains. Paul rebuilt the timber-framed ancient mansion, Stoke Court, from 1695, when he became Speaker,Roy Peaccock, The Seventeenth Century Foleys: iron wealth and vision 1580-1716 (Black Country Society, 2011), 131-2 143 154-5. and it was mostly complete by 1698. It was finished by his son, Thomas, Auditor of the imprests. The house, subsequently known as Stoke Park, descended in the family to Thomas Lord Foley, who (having inherited the Great Witley estate from his distant cousin Thomas 2nd Baron Foley) settled Stoke Edith on his second son Edward Foley (1747‚Äì1803), an MP. Thomas Foley, Auditor of the imprests. Many of the family were members of Parliament. Stoke Park remained their principal residence until it was destroyed by fire in 1927. The present Stoke Edith House (once the Rectory), the park and extensive agricultural and woodlands remain in the ownership of the Foley family. The former rectory became a Grade II listed building on 20 October 1952. Architecture and fittings A prior house, Elizabethan in style, was characterized by its multiple shaped gables and stone detailing. That house was superseded by the present mansion, quadrangular in shape, and constructed of red brick, with wings. It was considered to be a good example of Williamite architecture from the late 17th century period. The interior included a state wing is to the west and a parlour toom in the centre of the house. There was a long study, a drawing room, a wainscotted dining room, and an embellished hall. The east- wing stair was top-lit. The Stoke Edith Wall Hanging, dating to 1710-20 and which originally hung in the house, is now on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1926, Paul Henry Foley donated 136 rare books in 242 volumes from the house to Hereford Cathedral's library. Grounds Stoke Edith Park Gatehouse The grounds are terraced and are within a wooded park. Improvements to the park were made by Humphry Repton in the late 18th century, and to the formal garden by William Andrews Nesfield in the 1850s. This included an arabesque pattern, box edging, coloured walks, steep grass slope, and beech trees. Garden fittings included a statue of old Father Time and a sundial with the motto Horas non numero nisi serenas (\\"I count only the sunny hours\\").

Life He was son of Samuel Luscombe, physician at Exeter. He was educated at Exeter grammar school and at Catharine Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. 1798 and M.A. 1805. He was curate at Clewer, Windsor, and from 1806 to 1819 was master of the East India Company College at Hertford Heath, holding also the curacy of St. Andrew's, Hertford. Walter Farquhar Hook was one of his pupils there, and became an intimate friend. On 20 January 1810 he was incorporated M.A. of Oxford, joining Exeter College and proceeding B.C.L. 1 February 1810, and D.C.L. two days later. In 1819 he moved to Caen, and subsequently to Paris. In 1824, George Canning decided to appoint Luscombe embassy chaplain in Paris, and also general superintendent at the same time of the Anglican congregations on the continent. But he shortly afterwards assented to a proposal made Hook, that the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church should consecrate Luscombe to a continental bishopric; and so on 20 March 1825 Luscombe was consecrated at Stirling. In the course of the same year he assumed the office of chaplain at Paris, a post he retained until his death. Instead of the room at the embassy or the French Protestant Oratoire in which services had been held, he erected in 1834, mostly at his own cost, a church in the Rue d'Aguesseau. He officiated at William Makepeace Thackeray's marriage in Paris in 1836. Luscombe died suddenly of heart disease at Lausanne, 24 August 1846, and was buried at La Sallaz cemetery. He married the daughter of Henry Harmood, commissioner of the navy, by whom he had a son (who predeceased him) and two daughters. He left a bequest for divinity scholarships at Glenalmond College, Perthshire. Works Luscombe held high- church principles. He was one of the founders in 1841 of the Christian Remembrancer.

While attending medical college in Philadelphia, she learned Arabic. In 1934, she went to the Middle East to work as a missionary physician. In her forty-year long career, she worked primarily in Kuwait, as well as India, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman. In her capacity in Kuwait, she treated rich and poor women. To be successful, she had to overcome a number of obstacles, including limited trained medical staff, insufficient medical resources, as well as barriers due to cultural, lingual and religious differences. She made significant contributions in establishing modern medical care in the countries where she worked; Allison was asked by the rulers of Bahrain and Oman to help establish hospitals in their countries. She returned to the United States in 1975. Early life and education The first building to house the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. In the late 1920s money was raised to build a campus. On March 19, 1903, Mary Bruins was born in Holland, Michigan to Henry Bruins and Mary Huizinga. In 1907, her father accepted a position as minister at the First Reformed Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Bruins family moved in 1917 to Pella, Iowa and she attended Pella High School. In the fall of 1922, she began her studies at Central College in Pella. She joined the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in the fall of 1928. In 1932, she interned at Wisconsin General Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. She studied Arabic from 1933 to 1934 at Hartford Theological School. In 1934, she did her second internship at the University of Illinois at Chicago in obstetrics. Career  =Kuwait= Camel in Kuwait carrying fuel for cooking, 1938. Allison \\"described Kuwait homes as box-like buildings, whose outer enclosures formed a windowless high wall. Narrow passages between the row of houses provided space for pedestrians and donkeys\\". Allison arrived in Kuwait City, Kuwait in 1934. In the beginning, she studied Arabic in the mornings and then worked at the mission. The hospital was built land by the Kuwait Bay that was provided by Shaikh Mubarak, who had invited the Arabian Mission to run a hospital in the city. Due to cultural constraints, Allison generally treated women. Her patients were of all social classes, from the richest woman who was her first patient, to the poorest Kuwaiti women originally from Iran. Allison was required to first attend to the VIP, or aristocratic women, who she charged an extra fee for the convenience. It was a cultural norm for women to have their babies at their home or their mother's home, and professional medical attention was not sought unless there was a problem. This meant that when Allison handled deliveries, they were more likely to be due to prenatal complications. To treat these cases, Dr. Allison often needed to leave the hospital to make house calls. Some women died due to complications in their homes. Over time, more pregnant women went to the hospital for prenatal care and delivery. =Several places= In 1940, Allison followed her husband to India, where she worked for two years. She then returned to the United States and worked at a medical practice in New Jersey. In 1943, she rejoined her husband in India, and despite their decision to divorce, she stayed and worked at Dahanu Mission Hospital till 1945. She decided to return to Kuwait because she preferred it there. In 1948, a request to establish a hospital in Doha was made by the sheikh of Qatar, where Allison worked for four months. In 1964, a medical malpractice complaint was filed against Allison; this subsequently led to the end of her career in Kuwait. She was transferred to Bahrain in 1964. Around 1967, the Church began to question why it conducted missions in areas where people were not converting to Christianity. Some board members of the Reformed Church Board further wondered why the church provided medical care to an oil rich country. In March 1967, the medical mission was closed. =Bahrain and Oman= By 1970, Allison had worked in Bahrain for five years and was over sixty-five years old, the retirement age for a missionary.Church Policies on Missionary Retirement Davidmays.org. Retrieved 8 January 2012 Reluctantly, she retired from Bahrain and returned to the U.S. In 1971, however, she received a call that said that the mission board requested that she work at the Mutrah Hospital in Oman. The Sultan wanted to run free hospitals but did not have sufficient medical staff. She treated many diseases, including malaria, leprosy and the cholera epidemic of 1974. She retired for the last time in 1974 and moved in 1975 to Redlands, California. Personal life She met her British husband Norman Allison in 1937. The two got married on June 14, 1937. Although they loved each other, the demands of each of their career resulted in a strained and distant relationship; they divorced in 1943. Death Allison died on September 15, 1994.

The follow-up record, Ninety Miles Live at Cubadisco, was released on September 24, 2012. Background The name alludes to the stretch of waters between America, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. The project extends a larger, more organic story‚Äîof jazz as a conduit for connection between the U.S. and Cuba and an expression of common roots‚Äîwhich is as old as the music itself, and which has been altered and often severely curtailed during the last half-century, due to travel restrictions related to the continuing U.S. embargo of Cuba. The American members of Ninety Miles continue to tour, including shows at The Clifford Brown Jazz Festival, The Atlanta Jazz Festival, and at the Hollywood Bowl opening for Arturo Sandoval and The Buena Vista Social Club. Reception In late 2011, both Downbeat Magazine and Jazziz Magazine featured cover stories on the project with Jazziz Magazine stating that the hyperkinetic polyrhythms laid down by pianist Rember Duharte‚Äôs group on the opening track, ‚Äú√ëengueleru,‚Äù clearly distinguish this set from a conventional Latin-jazz date. In his review of the album, Dave Gelly of the Observer wrote \\"Ninety miles is the distance separating Cuba from the US.

Background  Frederick was born in Kassel. As the eighth child of Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Kassel, he was awarded Hesse-Eschwege by a decree of his father, which was imposed on his father by his eldest brother William V shortly before Maurice had to abdicate to avoid an impending bankruptcy. At the instigation of his second wife, Juliane of Nassau-Dillenburg, Maurice set aside a quarter of his country, the so-called Rotenburg Quarter, to be divided among his married sons. Of those, Herman IV received the Rotenburg area, Frederick received Eschwege and Ernest received the former Lower County of Katzenelnbogen, around Rheinfels Castle.  Life  Maurice himself lived with his second family in Eschwege until his death in 1632. His widow then moved to Rotenburg Castle with her children. The castle and town of Eschwege were pillaged and looted during the Thirty Years' War at Easter 1637. Thus, 20-year-old Frederick likely only moved into his residence at Eschwege after his marriage in 1646 in Stockholm with Eleonora Catherine, the sister of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden. Frederick had a successful military career in the Swedish army, where he made it to the Major General. It is unknown whether he was active during the Thirty Years' War. During the Second Northern War, he commanded a Swedish battle group. Due to his military career, he spent much time at the Swedish court and rarely visited Eschwege. His three brothers ruled his share of the Rotenburg Quarter on his behalf. Even so, he cared about his subjects and contributed significantly to the reconstruction after the end of the Thirty Years' War. His wife mostly stayed in Eschwege and his children were born there.  Death and legacy  Frederick died on 24 September 1655 in Costian near Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, during the Second Northern War, in the army of his brother-in-law Charles X Gustav of Sweden. He was buried in the Market Church in Eschwege; it took two years before his coffin arrived there. Hesse-Eschwege fell to his brother Ernest of Hesse-Rheinfels. The castle in Eschwege was assigned to his widow as dower, but she retreated to her Swedish fief Osterholz near Bremen.

With this, the law abolished the hunting and executions of witches in Great Britain. The maximum penalty set out by the Act was a year's imprisonment. It thus marks the end point of the witch trials in the Early Modern period for Great Britain and the beginning of the \\"modern legal history of witchcraft\\", repealing the earlier Witchcraft Acts which were originally based in an intolerance toward practitioners of magic but became mired in contested Christian doctrine and superstitious witch-phobia. The law was reverting to the view of the primitive and the medieval Church, expressed from at least the 8th century, at the Council of Paderborn, but contested by witch- phobic Dominican Inquisitors beginning in the mid 15th century, with some success in forwarding a new doctrine among the popes, as seen in the papal bull Summis desiderantes affectibus (1484), but with far less success among the bishops. Thus the Act of 1735 reflected the general trend in Europe, where after a peak around 1600, and a series of late outbursts in the late 17th century, witch-trials quickly subsided after 1700. The last person executed for witchcraft in Great Britain was Janet Horne in 1727. History of the Witchcraft Act 1735 William Aikman, painted in 1720. Erskine was the only Member of Parliament to voice significant opposition to the Act. Initially presented to the House of Commons on 27 January 1735/6 by John Conduitt, Sir John Crosse and George Heathcote, the Act received royal assent on 24 March and came into effect on 24 June. In the words of Davies (1999), the new law meant that witchcraft was \\"no longer to be considered a criminal act, but rather an offence against the country's newly enlightened state\\". Up until 1772, it was illegal for the newspapers to report on parliamentary debates, meaning that there is a lack of archival material on the parliamentary debate on the implementation of the Act. According to Davies, it appears that the Act \\"generated only a modicum of debate\\" within Parliament, with several amendments being suggested in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The only figure to offer significant opposition to the Act was Lord James Erskine. Erskine not only fervently believed in the existence of witchcraft, but, it has been argued, also held beliefs that were deeply rooted in \\"Scottish political and religious considerations\\" and which caused him to reject the Act. His objection to the Act \\"marked him out as an eccentric verging on the insane\\" among Members of Parliament, and in turn his political opponents would use it against him; one of his staunchest critics, Robert Walpole, who was then the de facto prime minister of the country, allegedly stating that he no longer considered Erskine to be a serious political threat as a result of his embarrassing opposition to the Act. The Witchcraft Act of 1735 was frequently invoked in the early years of the 19th century in an attempt by the political elite to root out \\"ignorance, superstition, criminality and insurrection\\" among the general populace, and even more so under a new statute brought in to reinforce the 1735 act in 1824.\\"In Owen Davies's reconstruction of events, a change in attitudes occurred at the opening of the nineteenth century, as members of the social elite came to perceive that a faith in magic seemed to be as prevalent among the populace as it had been a hundred years before, even while a growing political turbulence among commoners gave their rulers a new interest in the idea of education and civility as stabilizing forces. Ignorance, superstition, criminality and insurrection seemed increasingly to make up a single package, and one result of this realization was a growing number of prosecutions under the 1736 Act and then considerably more under a new statute which was brought in to reinforce it in 1824.\\" Hutton. p. 107. Modern history In September 1944, Helen Duncan was jailed under the Witchcraft Act on the grounds that she had claimed to summon spirits. Her followers often contend that her imprisonment was in fact at the behest of superstitious military intelligence officers, who feared that she would reveal the secret plans for D-Day. She came to the attention of the authorities after supposedly contacting the spirit of a sailor of , whose sinking was hidden from the general public at the time. After being caught faking a spiritual manifestation, she was arrested during a seance and indicted with seven punishable counts: two of conspiracy to contravene the Witchcraft Act, two of obtaining money by false pretences, and three of public mischief (a common law offence). She spent nine months in prison. Duncan has been frequently described as the last person to be convicted under the Act. The last person convicted under the Act was Jane Rebecca Yorke of Forest Gate in east London. On 26 September 1944 at the Central Criminal Court, Yorke was convicted on seven counts of \\"pretending...to cause the spirits of deceased persons to be present\\" and bound over.\\" The last threatened use of the Act against a medium was in 1950. In 1951 the Witchcraft Act was repealed with the enactment of the Fraudulent Mediums Act 1951, largely at the instigation of Spiritualists through the agency of Thomas Brooks MP. The South African Witchcraft Suppression Act, 1957, which is still in force, was based on similar 19th-century laws in the Cape Colony which were themselves based on the Witchcraft Act 1735.

Their traditional occupation is that of commerce and as such they form part of the wider Bania occupation-based community that also includes castes such as the Khandelwals, Oswals and Agrawals. The Banias of Rajasthan are often known as Marwaris, and are also known as Mahajans, a term which community members prefer because Bania can have negative connotations and imply a lower social position than that which they believe themselves to hold. There is a community of Meghwar people in the state of Gujarat who also sometimes use the Maheshwari name but these people are Dalits, unrelated to the Banias, and adopt the name to signify their devotion to the god Siv. The Maheshwaris claim a Rajput ancestry. K. K. Birla, an industrialist whose family has its origins in the Maheshwari caste, recounted a traditional story of origin for the community. This states that 72 groups from the Kshatriya varna in what is now Rajasthan decided in the 8th century to abandon their traditional role in favour of being members of the Vaishya varna. Inspired to do this by their devotion to Shiva, another name for whom is Mahesh, they adopted the name Maheshwari and thus established the 72 distinct family lines that exist within the small, tight-knit Maheshwari community to this day. Those lines, known as khamps, traditionally practice exogamy in marriage and mostly Vaishnavism in religion. There is a variant myth of origin, recorded by Sivkaran Ramratan Darak in 1923 and subsequently referred to by modern scholars such as Lawrence Babb. In this version, a prince was supported by 72 Rajputs in disrupting a sacrifice being made by some sages, who retaliated by cursing them such that they were turned to stone. It was Shiva who freed them from the curse, restoring them to life and thus inspiring their devotion. The arrival of colonial trade with the British encouraged Marwari people of Rajasthan to expand their business interests and geographical influence. Maheshwaris were among the Marwari merchants who moved to the Deccan Plateau in the early 19th century, where the opium trade was prominent; they were present as bankers in Hyderabad State by 1850; and in the last quarter of the century emerged as a significant group in the cotton trade of Bombay. In the 20th century, some Maheshwari families, such as the Birlas, used the accumulated wealth from their traditional occupations to become prominent industrialists and entrepreneurs.

It is also a Geological Conservation Review site for its Quaternary geomorphology and was first designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1971 for both its biological and geological interests. On the tip of the headland is a squat lighthouse built in 1911 by Trinity House as a replacement for the 17th century lighthouse on St Agnes. The Gilstone, a prominent rock off the eastern side of Peninnis Head, should not be confused with a rock of the same name in the Western Rocks. Geology The headland is composed of coarse‚Äìgrained Hercynian granite which has weathered to form cairns and natural sculptures with names such as the Pulpit Rock. In places head deposits have accumulated and thin podzolic soils have formed over the granite which is ideal for the formation of waved maritime heath vegetation. Peninnis Head is a Geological Conservation Review site because of the lack of glacial features which makes it possible to compare with sites, such as on Tresco in the north of the islands, where the granite has had some contact with glacial ice. Wildlife and ecology Western gorse (Ulex gallii), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and bell heather (Erica cinerea) are the main components of the waved maritime heath and on the deeper soils bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), European gorse (U. europaeus), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum) are encroaching and devaluing the vegetation which is why the condition of the SSSI is considered to be unfavourable recovering. Grazing under a HLS agreement should help the vegetation to recover. Two unusual plants (for the Isles of Scilly) in the species‚Äìrich maritime grassland are spring squill (Scilla verna) and thyme (Thymus polytrichus). The dominant species are red fescue (Festuca rubra), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), thrift (Armeria maritima), sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima), common sorrel (Rumex acetosa), common scurvygrass (Cochlearia officinalis) and buck's‚Äìhorn plantain (Plantago coronopus). The nationally scarce early meadowgrass (Poa infirma) and western clover (Trifolium occidentale) also occur. Lichens The headland is exposed to salt‚Äìladen winds and sea spray, and a number of lichens grow at the extreme tip. They include the common sea ivory (Ramalina siliquosa), the nationally scarce Roccella fuciformis, R. phycopsis, and golden hair-lichen (Teloschistes flavicans); and the BAP species ciliate strap-lichen (Heterodermia leucomela). History Peninnis Head as seen from a passing ship During the Second World War (1939‚Äì45) a Radio Direction Finding Station (RDF) was built on Peninnis Head. The first hostile enemy action in the islands occurred on 21 August 1940 when aircraft bombed the RDF. The installation was attacked on several occasions and was destroyed just over a year after the first attack. Peninnis Lighthouse was built in 1911 to replace the lighthouse in the centre of the island of St Agnes, which had been in operation since 1680. The light helps vessels to enter Hugh Town harbour via St Mary's Sound. Originally powered by acetylene (provided from tanks in the adjacent one-storey building) it was electrified in 1992.Trinity House listing References External links * Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust * Information on Peninnis Lighthouse at Trinity House Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the Isles of Scilly Sites of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1971 ","title":"Peninnis Head"},{"id":"34238120","text":"Mat√∫≈° Chovan (born February 14, 1992) is a Slovak ice hockey player who is currently playing for the HC 07 Detva in the Slovak Extraliga.

Life A notable polymath, born in Bayamo, Cuba, on May 7, 1797, he entered the Seminary of San Carlos in Havana in 1809 under the tutelage of F√©lix Varela. In 1821, he obtained the professorship in Philosophy at the Seminary of San Carlos, occupying the same chair of his former professor, and began teaching Philosophy at the institution. From 1824 to 1826, he traveled to the United States, and in 1828 he returned to the city of New York, where he devoted himself to literary labors. Among these endeavors, he founded the Mensajero Quincenal, a scientific, political, and literary weekly. In 1832 he returned to Havana, and held the editorship of Revista Bimestre Cubana, a magazine which published articles that ranged from immigration, abolition, statistics, and education, until 1834, year when he was expelled from the island on account of his liberal ideas and anti-slavery principles. During that same period when he held the position of editor for the periodical, he directed the College of Buena Vista. In 1833 his numerous essays about roadways, and living conditions like vagrancy in Cuba, awarded him the first prizes in competitions held by the Sociedad Patri√≥tica (Patriotic Society). In 1836 he was elected to represent the eastern part of Cuba in the Spanish Cortes, but he did not take his seat, as the Madrid government deprived the colonies of representation. He drafted soon after, and set out to travel to other countries. He travelled to Europe, establishing residence in Spain, where he would translate from Latin into Spanish, the celebrated work of Heinecious on Roman Law. His translation was published several times thereafter. In 1838, he published in Madrid Paralelo entre Cuba y algunas colonias inglesas. Soon after, he toured Europe. He visited Germany, Italy, Austria, Portugal, and finally France. In 1840, he established his residence in Paris, where he published Supresi√≥n del tr√°fico de esclavos en Cuba in 1845 which infuriated many slave-holders at the time, and as a result, his chances to reenter Cuba diminished. In 1848, he published in Paris his Ideas sobre la incorporaci√≥n de Cuba a los E. U.,, opposing in part the annexation of Cuba to the United States, which was immediately translated into English and French, and by the American press. In 1851, La situaci√≥n pol√≠tica de Cuba y su remedio was published, and a couple of years later, in 1853, La cuesti√≥n Cubana. In 1854 he had the chance to return to Cuba under the amnesty that was in effect. He did not return until a few years later, in the year 1861 with the sole purpose of establishing a journal in Madrid that would defend Cuban interests while he lived in France. In 1866, he was elected in the city of Santiago de Cuba, as a delegate in Madrid to advocate political reforms for Cuba. He was part of the Committee of Inquiry, in which he took an active participation. In 1878, he was reelected by the same city to the Spanish cortes, but did not occupy the post, due to his sudden death. In the last years of his life, he began the voluminous work Historia de la esclavitud desde los tiempos m√°s remotos, of which, several tomes were published before his death. Some of his other works include Historia de la esclavitud entre los Indios, and various articles on different subjects, which later have been compiled into Colecci√≥n de papeles varios in 1882 in the city of Havana.

He volunteers to lead one last attempt to re-establish contact with the central Metro stations before the station mobilises its military and heads north en masse. He is accompanied by Homer, an old man searching for inspiration for a book. Hunter makes contact with the guards at Tulskaya Station, but after an argument the hermetic doors are sealed. Hunter tells Homer that the station had been captured by bandits and must be destroyed, but Homer recovers a diary left by one of the previous expeditions which indicates that the station had been infected by a deadly disease. They detour through the abandoned and heavily irradiated Kakhovskaya Line and encounter Sasha, the teenage daughter of the exiled Avtozavodskaya Station Master, who had recently died. She accompanies them and the increasingly violent Hunter kills several men as they pass through Avtozavodskaya. Sasha restrains him somewhat, preventing additional bloodshed and during a mutant attack at Paveletskaya Station, Hunter is seriously injured after saving Sasha. Sasha believes that she can prevent Hunter from committing further atrocities in his mission to protect Sevastopolskaya, but after an argument Hunter presses on without them. Homer and Sasha are joined by Leonid, a musician and are re-united with Hunter at Dobryninskaya Station. An increasingly unstable Hunter heads to the centre of the Metro, to Polis, to gather an armed force to cleanse the infected stations. He is accompanied by Homer, while Sasha leaves with Leonid who claims to know a cure for the plague. The detour was unnecessary and Leonid admits that he did it in order to spend some time with Sasha. He tells her the disease had broken out before in a different section of the Metro and it was found that exposure to radiation could cure it. He agrees to accompany her in an effort to prevent Hunter from killing everyone there. Hunter finds his old comrade Miller (referred to as 'Melnik' in Metro 2033), the leader of \\"The Order\\" ‚Äì a paramilitary group dedicated to defending the Metro and who believed Hunter was dead. Miller provides him with a heavily armed squad and Hunter returns to Dobryninskaya, while Homer wrestles with his conscience as to whether to attempt to stop him or allow the massacre to proceed. The Order arrives at Tulskaya and prepares to fire at the infected, only to be distracted by Leonid's music. Sasha appeals to Hunter, and tells him of the possible cure. The troops already stationed within Tulskaya, who had been trying to contain the outbreak, detonate explosives that flood the station. The Order withdraws and seals the hermetic doors, leaving those inside to drown. Several weeks later, both Hunter and Homer are back at the border guard at Sevastopolskaya. Homer had searched for Sasha's body, but was unable to find it, leaving her fate unknown. English editions The novel was released as an e-book by Victor Gollancz in English on 20 February 2014.

Early life Trumbull Cary was born in Mansfield, Connecticut on August 11, 1787. He was the son of Ebenezer Cary (1732‚Äì1816) and Sarah Cary (n√©e Trumbull) (1741‚Äì1830). In 1805, aged 18, he moved to Batavia, New York with his parents. In 1808, his father was one of two merchants operating in Batavia at the time. Career After moving to Batavia, Cary served as the Postmaster of the town for more than twenty years. In 1822, Cary, along with two other citizens, petitioned New York State to incorporate the village of Batavia. The measure failed, but they tried again the following year, and the State approved the incorporation of the village of Batavia on April 23, 1823. =Government service= He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Genesee Co.) in 1828. From 1831 to 1834, he was a member of the New York State Senate (8th D.), sitting in the 54th (serving alongside future U.S. President Millard Fillmore), 55th, 56th and 57th New York State Legislatures. At the time, the Eighth District consisted of Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara and Orleans counties. While serving in the Senate, he met William H. Seward, who later became the Governor of New York, a United States Senator, and the U.S. Secretary of State from 1861 to 1869. Seward and Cary maintained a close personal and political friendship for the rest of Cary's life. In 1840, Cary became the New York State Bank Commissioner, a role in which he served until 1843. =Bank of Genesee= In the early 19th century, Batavia was the headquarters of the Holland Land Company, owners of the Holland Purchase that became Western New York. As the largest settlement in the region at the time, it was an ideal place for a bank, and thus the Bank of Genesee was established in the city in 1829, with Cary as one of the incorporators and its first president. For the bank's first year, it operated out of his mansion in Batavia.See also: Cary served as president of the bank for over twenty years, and was a director of the bank until his death in 1869. Personal life In 1817, he erected the Cary Mansion in Batavia, a 24-room Greek revival structure. It was said that the home was erected as a condition for his eventual bride, Margaret Elinor Brisbane, to marry Cary. Brisbane was the sister of utopian socialist Albert Brisbane and the aunt of Arthur Brisbane, one of the best known newspaper editors of the 20th century. Trumbull married Margaret on June 2, 1817. Together they had one son: * Dr. Walter Cary (1818‚Äì1881), who married Julia Love (niece of Brig.-Gen. George Maltby Love); parents of seven, including architect George Cary, who married Allithea Birge. For nearly 50 years, he was a vestryman at St. James Church in Batavia.

He fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War, and evolved from the ultra-conservatism of his youth into liberal positions, always within monarchist sectors. He was one of those attending the conference of the European Movement held in Munich in 1962 (referred to as the \\" Munich conspiracy\\" in Francoist Spain). After the Spanish transition to democracy he was successively elected senator and congressman. Biography Satr√∫stegui was born into a wealthy monarchist family with shipping interests in San Sebasti√°n. His father was Henry Satr√∫stegui Barri√©, Baron Satr√∫stegui.

The attributions of blame are negatively correlated to similarities between the observer and the people involved in the mishap, i.e. more responsibility is attributed to the people involved who are dissimilar to the observer. Assigning responsibility allows the observer to believe that the mishap was controllable and thus preventable. A defensive attribution may also be used to protect the person's self-esteem if, despite everything, the mishap does occur, because blame can be assigned to the \\"other\\" (person or situation). The use of defensive attributions is considered a cognitive bias because an individual will change their beliefs about a situation based upon their motivations or desires rather than the factual characteristics of the situation. Research Walster (1966) hypothesized that it can be frightening to believe that a misfortune could happen to anyone at random, and attributing responsibility to the person(s) involved helps to manage this emotional reaction. Shaver (1970) recognized that the similarity of the witness to the person(s) involved in the misfortune ‚Äì in terms of situation, age, gender, personality, etc. ‚Äì changes the amount of responsibility one is ready to ascribe. Where Walster's work suggested increases in attributed responsibility, Shaver's concept of \\"defensive attribution\\" argued for minimization of assigned responsibility based on perceived similarities between the attributor and the person(s) involved. Shaver was able to demonstrate this response by describing events to test subjects; varying the situations and people described to either match or be significantly different from the subjects: as similarity with witnesses increased, attributions of responsibility decreased. In 1981 Jerry Burger published a meta-analysis of 22 peer-reviewed studies on the defensive attribution hypothesis, in which he found strong evidence to support Shaver's hypothesized negative relationship between similarity and responsibility. Sexual assault Researchers examining sexual assault have consistently found that male participants blamed rapists less than female participants did, and that male participants blamed the rape victims more than female participants did. These findings support Shaver's similarity-responsibility hypothesis: male participants, who are personally similar to (male) rapists, blame rapists less than female participants who are dissimilar to rapists. On the other hand, female participants, who are personally similar to (female) rape victims, blame the victims less than male participants.

Their landforms are quite different. Areas of Old Drift have been heavily flattened and transformed as a result of geomorphic processes such as denudation and erosion, whilst areas of Young Drift have largely retained their original shape. Whilst the majority of Old Drift moraines were formed during the Saale glaciation about 130,000 to 140,000 years ago, the Young Drift moraines in Central Europe are only about 15,000 to 20,000 years old. The terms Old and Young Drift are used for all elements of the glacial series even though the meltwater deposits and landforms are not strictly moraines.  Old Drift  The Old Drift landscapes were tundras or cold deserts during the last ice age. Periglacial processes resulted in significant ablation of higher terrain as well as accumulation of sediments in the depressions. As a result of that the old glacial forms have clearly been worn down. In addition almost all closed hollows (e. g. dead ice kettle holes) have been completely filled in. Old Drift landscapes are therefore much less relief-intensive than Young Drift regions and have hardly any natural lakes. The river system of Old Drift areas is normal and hierarchical. Due to advanced weathering of the sediments near the surface, the soils are more heavily leached ( (brunified, decalcified and/or podsolized). The glacial till is generally decalcified to 3‚Äì4 metres; thinner strata may be entirely decalcified. Very common are wind-formed ablation or accumulation landforms, because during the glacial periods, the wind could easily blow sand and silt away due to the lack of a layer of vegetation. The presence of ventifacts, dunes and loess is thus typical of Old Drift areas.  Young Drift  Young Drift morainic landscapes by contrast have new landforms that are still recognisable as glacial forms.. There are numerous enclosed hollows, many of which are filled with water. The river system is often still immature and rather chaotic. There are numerous inland drainage areas. Ventifacts and dunes do occur; but these landforms are much younger and less intensively formed than in Old Drift country. The soils are markedly less weathered than those of the Old Drift. On areas of ground moraine, the depth of decalcification of the glacial till is thus often less than 1 metre.

The church is currently in a state of considerable disrepair and no services are held there. The church, adjoining cemetery, and surrounding acreage are owned and maintained by the non-profit organization, Bear Creek Cemetery Association of Adair County. History The Bear Creek Baptist congregation was the earliest organized Christian group in Adair County, dating to the late 1830s.Montgomery, Maxine. Pioneer Days in Adair County. Published in the Kirksville Daily Express. 12 September 1979. Previously only small groups of neighbors would gather in private homes at various points in the county. Reverend Talbot Hight is recognized as the chief organizer of the congregation, in the period of late 1838 - early 1839. No funds or land were available to build a proper building and sanctuary, so for the first years of the congregation's existence private homes were used for services, with the Reverend Lewis Connor as pastor. Following Connor's 1856 death he was interred on a portion of his land informally deeded to the Bear Creek congregation for purposes of a church and cemetery. The exact date of construction for the current building isn't known, but commonly accepted as sometime in 1860. The disruption caused by the American Civil War meant that the building wasn't finished until sometime in 1865. Cemetery adjacent to Bear Creek Baptist Church. The church continued to grow through the remainder of the 19th century. However membership began to decline in the early 1900s until finally the last regularly scheduled services were held there on February 7, 1914. In October, 1946 a group from the First Baptist Church of Kirksville dedicated a large boulder with plaque on the site in honor of its status as the first church in the county. The cemetery continued in use long after the church had ceased regular services, the last known burials being in 1979. Among the local notables buried in the Bear Creek cemetery is Samuel Withrow, the first postmaster in Adair County, buried there in 1852. In May, 1982 a non-profit corporation, the aforementioned Bear Creek Cemetery Association of Adair County, was established to care for the property and building. Among their first projects was to secure the site's placement on the National Register of Historic Places. The Bear Creek Church survived a close call with Mother Nature in 2009. On May 13 of that year a tornado estimated as an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale passed near the church as it left a path of death and destruction from Novinger to Kirksville. Two Adair County residents were killed by the tornado about one mile from the church.

It was part of a wave of pogroms in Russia and controlled territories (such as the Kingdom of Poland), in the larger context of the widespread unrest. The pogrom in Siedlce was organized by the Russian secret police (Okhrana). There were 26 fatalities among the Jewish populations. Background Siedlce had a significant Jewish population (estimated at 10,000 to 64% out of 24,000 total (so about 15,000)). In the larger context of the widespread unrest it was the site of socialist and Polish patriotic agitation and demonstrations (organized by Polish Socialist Party and Jewish Bund), and the government desired to make a vivid response to the Bloody Wednesday, a series of attacks on government officials organized by PPS that took place barely a months earlier, and other similar events. On August 26 an OB PPS activist, disguised as a Jew, assassinated a Russian police captain in Siedlce. As many Jews took part in the protests, the Russian government saw the Siedlce as a ripe territory to show its force. Siedlce was not the only place where the Russian police and military terrorized workers who were seen as sympathizing with the PPS and other opposition organizations; similar excesses occurred in Warsaw and ≈Å√≥d≈∫, but were directed against the workers in general, not Jews in particular. Pogrom The pogrom, planned systemically \\"for some time\\", took place on September 7 or 8 to 9, 10 or 11), 1906. It was organized by the Russian secret police (Okhrana), in particular by Colonel Tichonowski, who was tasked with the preparations. Anti-semitic pamphlets had been distributed for over a week and before any unrest begun, a curfew was declared. The primary perpetrators were Russian soldiers from the LiepƒÅja (libawski) infantry regiment. They had replaced the Ostro≈Çƒôka garrison, previously garrisoning the town, which had been deemed too sympathetic to the local residents. The soldiers were ordered to start shooting on the town square; soon afterwards, they were ordered to set some fires, and allowed to loot Jewish stores at will. Artillery pieces were used, as noted even in the official news reports. Some sources also report the involvement of Black Hundreds, which had no native presence in the Kingdom of Poland, and would have had to have been brought in by the authorities from the Empire proper. Most of the shops in the town were destroyed and looted, and there were many cases of arson; private (Jewish) homes were also broken into and looted. Official military reinforcements from nearby garrisons were moved to Siedlce. In the meantime, Russian officials were demanding from the Jewish community that the \\"bandits\\" who had opened fire on the soldiers be turned in. There were 26 fatalities among the Jewish population, and an unspecified, larger number, into the hundreds, were reported as injured. The Polish populace helped to shelter the Jews. About 1000 people were arrested. According to official sources, the military and police suffered no casualties. Aftermath The official story spun by Russian propaganda was that the events in Siedlce were triggered by \\"revolutionaries\\", whose plot has been discovered and put down by the police and the army. Despite their leading role in the pogrom, some soldiers and policemen were recognized with medals or honorable mentions. OB PPS carried out a successful assassination of one of high-ranking Russian officials involved in organizing the Siedlce pogrom, Colonel Obruczew, in December of that year. Nonetheless, the fact that the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party (OB PPS), which organized the events of Bloody Wednesday, took no other significant action in response to the Siedlce pogrom, was, in the words of one of the PPS leaders, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, \\"a moral defeat\\" for OB PPS; further, it demonstrated to OB PPS that they had no power to stop the Russian military from carrying out such brutal demonstrations of force at any time and place of their choosing. One of the responses of the Siedlce pogrom was the organization of Jewish self-defense groups in many cities and towns, although according to other sources, those groups existed before that pogrom, even in Siedlce. The pogrom has been widely condemned in public opinion in Poland and abroad and by most Polish political parties. The Polish press was unanimous in denouncing these acts of violence. Polish and Jewish deputies to the Russian parliament (the Duma) demanded an investigation, which eventually reached the conclusion that the events were caused by some soldiers acting without official orders. The outcome was disappointing for the Russians, and dissuaded the Russian government from organizing more pogroms in Poland, as the Siedlce and Bia≈Çystok pogroms proved to be failures, with the Polish populace steadfastly refusing to support the Russian forces, and sufficient independent and political coverage and investigation so that little effective propaganda could be disseminated in the aftermath. In particular, the fact that official investigation of the events in Siedlce and Bia≈Çystok had to conclude that they were not the fault of local populace, but of the Russian army (even if the blame was laid on disobedient soldiers), represented a major loss of face for the government. This pogrom was one of the last, if not the last, of the significant pogroms in the Russian Empire and related territories in the period following the Russian Revolution of 1905.

An example of Romanesque Revival architecture, it is one of the few wood-frame structures in that style still remaining in the United States. St. Mary's was constructed in 1904, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is now owned and managed by Friends of St. Mary's, a non-profit preservation organization. History =Early years= The present-day building is the third church built in the village to serve the needs of Catholic immigrants. The first Irish Catholics began to arrive in eastern Adair County in the early 1840s, with a substantial increase thereafter largely due to the Great Famine. The first services were held in a private residence in Adair in 1844. They were conducted by Father McNamee, who journeyed to the village with his portable altar by horseback from Edina, Missouri. In 1860 the first Catholic church, a rough-hewn log structure, was constructed and the first priest, Father Ryan, assigned. The log church was replaced in 1869 with a simple wood frame building. The village and church congregation continued to grow through the late 1800s, and by 1900 it was clear to the worshipers that something more substantial was needed. St. Mary's Catholic Church, circa 1910. Note the taller tower than the present day photo due to storm damage. =A new home= The current St. Mary's Church was constructed between 1904 and 1905 under the direction of John V. Barwarth of Edina, Missouri, for a sum of $10,000. Due to its somewhat remote location in the county, lumber and most other construction materials had to be delivered by rail to Baring, Missouri, several miles to the east in Knox county, then hauled by wagon to Adair. The new church was built on the same grounds as the old, with the latter moved a short distance away for use as a school. On June 15, 1905, a dedication was held for the new church, conducted by Archbishop John J. Glennon (later known as John Cardinal Glennon) with a large gathering of Catholics from across northeast Missouri, and even some non-Catholic neighbors, in attendance. The new building's dimensions at time of completion were 88 feet, 4 inches by 52 feet, 2 inches. The dominant features were the two towers, one each on the northwest and southwest corners of the building. The northwest, the bell tower, is 12 feet, 4 inches square and was originally 90 feet in height. However a severe storm nearly destroyed it some years later and repairs left it at the current 50 feet in height. The southwest tower is octagonal in shape and 40 feet in height with round arch openings and Corinthian style supports, topped by a dome. A highlight of the octagonal tower is a statue known as The Sorrowful Mother. It is believed to be one of only three reproductions of the statue in the United States, with the original in Rome, Italy. The buildings interior features a large sanctuary with two small vestries. Pressed Florentine style tin covers the ceiling and much of the interior walls, while the flooring is made of tongue-in-groove yellow pine. A semi-circular balcony overlooks part of the sanctuary and provided extra seating as needed. A few years after initial construction ornate lighting fixtures of Tiffany design were added to the sanctuary. =Decline and resurrection= St. Mary's Catholic Church as it appeared April 7, 2018. St. Mary's Church, and the surrounding community, continued to grow for the first two decades of the 20th century. Adair had a sizable business district catering to area farmers ‚Äì a population of over 400 ‚Äì and a Catholic school was built. The years after World War I and then the Great Depression were not kind to either the village or the church. A general trend in America saw younger generations leaving the agriculture field for job opportunities in cities. A loss of children caused the closure of the Catholic school in 1925. The emergence of the automobile and improved roads in rural Missouri meant families could easily travel to larger towns in the area like Baring, Edina, and Kirksville to shop. Each town also having its own Catholic church ‚Äì in the case of Edina and Kirksville, quite substantial congregations ‚Äì meant combining morning Mass with an afternoon of resupplying before returning home. By 1942 only 30 people were counted as part of the St. Mary's parish. In 1958 St. Mary's was relegated to being a mission of Mary Immaculate Church in Kirksville. In December, 1972, with the congregation reduced to less than twenty adults ‚Äì most elderly ‚Äì it was announced that all Masses at St. Mary's would be discontinued for the winter. They would not ever resume. The church rectory was sold off in 1973 and it appeared a grim fate awaited the church. However, a small group of former parishioners and non-Catholics interested in historical preservation refused to let the unique church architecture be destroyed without a fight. A petition to have the building placed on the National Register of Historical Places was filed, and on December 16, 1974, that request was granted. The following May the non-profit Friends of St. Mary's Church of Adair, Missouri, Incorporated was chartered by the state of Missouri with the purpose of preservation and restoration of the church. On July 12, 1976, the Diocese of Jefferson City (Missouri) deeded the church to the group. Since that time the group has focused on maintenance, with some restoration as money allows. A variety of fundraisers are held to support the efforts. At present no services are regularly held and the building is open to the public only by special arrangement.

Displaying an eclectic style, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in January, 2008. The church building is the second-oldest in Kirksville to be in continuous use by a congregation. History The Trinity Episcopal Church congregation has been a mainstay in the Kirksville area since 1870, when first established as an outreach mission. The first church building, a wooden structure, was constructed in 1870 on the site of the current church and served the congregation until 1916. A fire in 1907 caused major damage and despite repairs it was apparent the original building would not remain usable. In October, 1915 the congregation petitioned the Episcopal Diocese for assistance and were successful in reaching an agreement on financing. Well- known local architect and congregation member, Irwin Dunbar was selected to design the new building and during 1916 the former wooden structure was razed to clear path for the new church. Construction was begun in the spring of 1917 with the local firm of Eggert & Russel chosen for the task. The cornerstone was laid on May 14, 1917 and building progressed rapidly with the consecration of the new church on November 7, 1917. Total completion cost for the project was $11,555, the Diocese contributing $5,500. The building was constructed in a bungalow/craftsman, Gothic Revival style with the finished dimensions approximately 37 feet by 67 feet. With the 1907 fire still fresh in their minds, the congregation chose the slightly higher cost of a brick structure as opposed to wood. The building is somewhat asymmetrical in nature and sits atop a raised basement. When designing the interior, Irwin Dunbar chose some features that reflected not only a blend of Craftsman and Gothic Revival styles, but his own background as an engineer. Most notable of those are the open beam ceiling in the nave, constructed of black walnut. These trusses provided support for the heavy English tile roof, yet kept the worship area free of cumbersome columns. Black walnut was used extensively throughout the interior for trim, window frames, and other ancillary features. Today The sanctuary is very much as originally designed and constructed. The replacement of a section of flat roof with an inclined one in 1998, has taken place. Save for upgrades in electrical, plumbing, and HVAC, the interior is largely untouched. An accessibility project in 2015, designed by Chinn, Rother, and Associates, of Columbia, Missouri, added a new wing to add accessibility improvements, including a lift, a new, wider entrance, and restrooms. As part of this project, one of the original stained glass windows was moved from the sanctuary to the new addition. =Wicks Pipe Organ= The church features a pipe organ, built in 1967 by Wicks Organ Company of Highland, Illinois, with an additional Dulzian rank added later. The electro-pneumatic organ is at the front of the room, and exposed pipes. The organ was renovated by Quimby Pipe Organs of Warrensburg, Missouri in 2015.

She was one of the twelve founding members of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo and served as the first President of the organization. She has been named as a \\"prominent woman\\" by the Argentine National Congress and as an \\"illustrious citizen\\" by Corrientes Province.  Biography  Alicia Zubasnabar de De la Cuadra was born in the small town of Sauce, Corrientes Province, in 1915. While living there she married Roberto Luis De la Cuadra and had five children with him. In 1945 they moved to settle in La Plata city, capital of Buenos Aires Province. During the military dictatorship named by its leaders as the National Reorganisation Process (1976-1983) her husband, a worker at the Propulsora Sider√∫rgica (Iron and Steel Propellent) in Ensenada, her son Roberto Jos√© and her daughter Elena, who was pregnant, and her sons-in-law H√©ctor Baratti and Gustavo Ernesto Fraire were abducted, along with her grandson who was later recovered. It would later be discovered that her granddaughter was born in captivity on June 16, 1977, named Ana Libertad by her mother. Except for her grandson, none of them were ever seen again. Monse√±or Emilio Graselli, private secretary to the army chaplain Mons. Adolfo S. Tortolo, who had a register listing many abducted individuals and particularly with information on the fates of children born in captivity, told her that her son had died and that her daughter was being held under arrest.Nosiglia, p. 46/48 A year later, Alicia received news of the birth of her granddaughter and of the deplorable conditions under which her daughter and son-in-law were suffering: The judges systematically refused to start any sort of investigative activities. Shortly afterwards, thanks to the negotiations of that Italian Jesuit order, Monse√±or Mario Pichi intervened, meeting with Colonel Rospide Rospide to ask him if he could give the child to its grandmother. The Colonel replied:  Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo  The coup d'√©tat of March 24, 1976, established a regime of state terrorism based on the forced disappearance of the opposition and the imposition of an atmosphere of terror designed to avoid complaints. At that time, the family members of the disappeared were completely defenceless and powerless, as neither any of the world's democracies, nor the Catholic Church, nor international humanitarian organisations were ready to condemn the atrocities committed by the military regime and on the contrary even cooperated with this illegal repression in some cases. Nor was it possible to call on the judiciary system for help. Under these conditions a group of mothers, fathers and other family members of the disappeared started a nonviolent resistance movement which made history. The idea was put forward by Azucena Villaflor, later kidnapped and murdered by the dictatorship: On April 30, 1977, they began marching every Thursday around the Pir√°mide de Mayo in the square of the same name, located opposite the House of Government. To call attention to themselves, the women decided to cover their heads with white cloth. The group quickly became known as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, and by their simple presence they began to exert national and international pressure on the question of the fates of those who disappeared in Argentina. Amongst these mothers and grandmothers was Alicia Zubasnabar de De la Cuadra, \\"Licha\\", who had started to participate in the marches in September 1977 along with her husband and Hebe de Bonafini. At that time, another mother and grandmother, Mar√≠a Isabel Chorobik de Mariani or \\"Chicha\\", had started looking for other mothers of the disappeared who were, like her, looking for their grandchildren. Mariani had been pushed towards joining up with other grandmothers by Lidia Pegenaute, a lawyer working as an advisor to minors in the courts of La Plata, where she had tried without success to find a solution to her case.Nosiglia, p. 36 In the second half of 1977 Mariani went to see De la Cuadra at her house in La Plata: That same day, Chicha and Licha made the decision to form a group of grandmothers and unite those whom they knew from the Thursday marches in the Plaza de Mayo. The twelve founding mothers and grandmothers were Mar√≠a Isabel Chorobik de Mariani, Beatriz H. C. Aicardi de Neuhaus, Eva M√°rquez de Castillo Barrios, Alicia Zubasnabar de De la Cuadra, Vilma Delinda Sesarego de Guti√©rrez, Mirta Acu√±a de Baravalle, Haydee Vallino de Lemos, Leontina Puebla de P√©rez, Delia Giovanola de Califano, Raquel Radio de Marizcurrena, Clara Jurado y Mar√≠a Eugenia Casinelli de Garc√≠a Irureta Goyena. Licha Zubasnabar was the group's first president. They were initially known as the \\"Argentinian Grandmothers with Disappeared Grandchildren\\", but in 1980 they became legally organised under their publicly recognised name, \\"Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo\\". The subgroup of \\"The Mothers\\" understood that the situation of the children kidnapped by security forces was different from that of their parents, and that specific strategies and methods were needed for their recovery. \\"Search for our grandchildren without forgetting our children\\" was the motto which united them. During the military dictatorship and despite the risks, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo began investigations in order to find their grandchildren, without abandoning the search for their children, at the same time as starting a national and international public awareness campaign focusing on their missing grandchildren and the dictatorship's systematic kidnapping of children. Once democracy was restored on December 10, 1983, the grandmothers promoted the use of the most recent genetic advances to establish a system for identifying their stolen grandchildren, a system unprecedented in the world, and pressured the state into indicting those responsible for the kidnapping of children, considering them to be part of a plan of repression. In 1984, the Grandmothers became a civil non-profit association, with Alicia stepping down as president and the role passing on to Mar√≠a Isabel de Mariani (Chicha). At that time, her husband had just died. From then on, Alicia continued as the group's spokeswoman. By 2008, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo had recovered 88 grandchildren. It is estimated that, in total, about five hundred children born between 1975 and 1980 were kidnapped.

Led by the Waldensian minister Jean Pierre Michelin Salomon, a native of the Pellice Valley of northwestern Italy, this contingent left South America in early 1875, fleeing civil war in the Uruguayan countryside, traveling first back to Europe then across the Northern Atlantic to New York and by train to southern Missouri. The original congregation was composed mainly of patois-speaking Piedmontese immigrants. Waldensians living in the Cottian Alps region of Northern Italy continued to migrate to Monett until the early 1900s. The original colony was augmented by French-speaking Protestants who arrived from France and Switzerland. Both the Monett congregation and a more recent, larger settlement located in Valdese, North Carolina, use the name Waldensian Presbyterian Church.

History  The first building dates back to 1492. The Aragonese family built it over the old Caldora structure of the 14th century. This structure, however, dates back to the 13th century Anglican era. According to the same hypothesis, Giacomo Cavuto could have strengthened the castle that could have been pre-existent. In the 15th century there were some adaptations and partial reconstructions of a pre-existing plant. The castle was defensive until the 17th century when it was bought by the Baglioni family as a noble residence. A gentile palace was built inside the walls, which in the 19th century fell abandoned. Since then the castle was used as a workshop and powder. In 1943 during the Battle of Ortona, the castle was hit by German bombs and American grenades. The gunpowder stored inside made the structure explode, all over the top of the walls and the noble palace skyrocketed. In '46 a landslide destroyed almost half of the castle, the one facing the sea from the tuff cliff.  Architecture  The base is almost trapezoidal and it is characterized by four cylindrical corner towers (though only three have survived today) and curtains on a scarp. The west side was occupied by a residential building. Some photos of the early 1900s show the baron-like palace inside the 18th-century walls, reworked by the fortification control room. Today the palace remains a piece of perimeter wall with decorations of the frame. The walls have a shoe plant, with two large circular towers placed on the side of Matteotti course, from where it is accessed today. The towers are typical of the period, because they have the largest shoe base, and the cylindrical central body with Gothic arch windows (those of the west tower are rectangular). On the west wall there is also a third smaller, always cylindrical tower, with an arched, arched window. The pavement of the base of the entrance side, with arcades on the masonry of the castle, makes it clear that the structure had a ditch of water. The interior is accessible from a small garden bordering the walls, and from a ladder above the remains of a side tower. The interior is bare due to the destruction of the war and has been rehabilitated in the garden, with retaining the walls to the entrance side of the Matteott course. In fact, there are stairs leading to the basement of the castle, while a second staircase leads to the Museum of the West Tower: there are panels of the historical photos of the castle and furnishings of the noble families that possessed the structure.

Gottschee) of Slovenia, formerly Gottschee County. Until the Second World War, their main language of communication was Gottscheerish, a Bavarian dialect. Gottschee German peasants in an engraving from Johann Weikhard von Valvasor's work The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola, 17th century Origins They first settled in Carniola around 1330 from the German lands of Tyrol and Carinthia and maintained their German identity and language during their 600 years of isolation. They cleared the vast forests of the region and established villages and towns. In 1809, they resisted French occupation in the 1809 Gottscheer Rebellion. With the end of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1918, Gottschee became a part of the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Gottscheer thus went from part of the ruling ethnicity of Austria-Hungary (and the ruling group in the estates of the province of Carniola itself) to an ethnic minority in a large Slavic state. With the onset of the Second World War and the 1941 Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, their situation further worsened. Ethnic Germans from Gottschee facing resettlement in 1941 Repatriation  Some Gottscheer community leaders embraced Nazism and agitated for \\"assistance\\" and \\"repatriation\\" to the Reich even before the German invasion in 1941, but most Gottscheer had no interest in reuniting with Greater Germany or in joining the Nazis. They had been integrated into society with their Slovene neighbors, often intermarrying and becoming bilingual while maintaining their Germanic language and customs. But propaganda and Nazi ideology prevailed, and the Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans (VoMi) began planning the Gottschee \\"resettlement\\" (forced expulsion) from the Italian occupation zone to the Rann Triangle (), the region in Lower Styria between the confluences of the Krka, Sotla, and Sava rivers, covering most of Gottschee. To achieve their goal, accommodation had to be made for the Gottschee settlers and, beginning in November 1941, some 46,000 Slovenes from the Rann Triangle region were deported to eastern Germany for potential Germanisation or forced labor. Shortly before that, propaganda aimed at both the Gottscheer and the Slovenes promised the latter equivalent farmland in Germany for the land relinquished in Lower Styria. The Gottscheer were given Reich passports and transportation to the Rann area straight after the forced departure of the Slovenes. Most left their homes following coercion and threats as the VoMi had set the 31 December 1941 as the deadline for the movement of both groups. Though many Gottscheer received houses and farmland, inevitably there was great dissatisfaction that many properties were of lesser value and quality than their original lands, and many were in disarray after the hasty expulsion of their previous occupants. From the time of their arrival until the end of the war, Gottschee farmers were harassed and sometimes killed by Yugoslav partisans who saw them as an instrument of the occupying regime. The attempt to resettle the Gottscheer proved a costly failure for the Nazi regime, which needed to deploy extra manpower to protect the farmers from the partisans. The deported Slovenes were taken to several camps in Saxony, Silesia, and elsewhere in Germany, where they were forced to work on German farms or in factories from 1941 to 1945. The laborers were not always kept in formal internment, but often in nearby vacant buildings. After the end of the war, most returned to Yugoslavia to find their homes destroyed. Current residence The vast majority of Gottscheers and their descendants now live in the United States, mainly in New York City and Cleveland, Ohio, but also in other parts of the country. Smaller numbers have settled in Canada and Austria.

Main in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. It was erected in 1937 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. It is located in the Courthouse-Seminary Neighborhood Historic District. History The decision to build a synagogue for Cape Girardeau's Jewish community came following the destruction of their Torah. In 1937, a 450-year-old Torah was brought to the United States by Isaac Becker, a Sikeston merchant. Isaac Becker had visited his father in Germany, who told him life for Jews in Germany was getting bad and that the book would be safer with him in the United States. Until that time, the High Holiday service was held in a number of locations: the local Elks Club building, the Sturdivant Bank, the Presbyterian Church, the Community Building in Fairground Park. However, tragedy struck on February 27, 1937, when the book was lost when the Community Building - the building it had been stored at - had been consumed by fire. After the fire, it was decided that a permanent synagogue was needed for both the Jewish community to worship at and as a place to store the community's scrolls. The synagogue was designed by the Saint Louis architect Thomas P. Barnett Jr. who also designed other buildings in Cape Girardeau as well as the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis. The synagogue is located at 126 S. Main Street in Cape Girardeau's historic commercial district. Architecture The synagogue is a stuccoed brick, one-story building constructed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style with Islamic influences. The building is covered in white stucco and red mission tiles. The building has a flap sloping roofline and red tiles along the parapet. A dome constructed of red painted sheet metal squares. A symmetrical band of decorative ceramic mosaic tiles form the base of the dome. Recessed Islamic pointed horseshoe arches provide openings on all three sides. Diamond pane casement windows with Islamic detail are arranged in the sides of the portico. To the south lies a gated area made of wrought iron with the Star of David molded into the iron.

Biography  Son of Pedro Francisco Zulen and Petronila Aymar, on leaving the school directed by notable educator Pedro A. Labarthe, he entered the Faculty of Sciences of the National University of San Marcos in 1906 where he specialised in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. In 1909 he decided to transfer to the Faculty of Arts, focusing particularly on the study of philosophy. In 1912 he enrolled in the Faculty of Law. He was the promoter and one of the founders of the Pro-Indigenous Association in 1909, and held the role of general secretary until 1915, although his resignation from the institution was not made public until the following year. In 1916 he travelled to the United States in order to undertake post-graduate studies in Philosophy at Harvard University, but his ill health (he suffered from tuberculosis) lead to his abandoning the attempt soon after classes began. He decided to return to Peru and settle in the city of Jauja, Jun√≠n Region, with two aims: to improve his health and, most of all, to leave Lima because of the harassment of Dora Mayer, an old Pro-Indigenous Association colleague. In 1919 he decided to run as a substitute delegate for Jauja province, but was arrested just before the election and sent to the regional capital, Cerro de Pasco, accused of anarchism and instigating rebellion amongst the peasantry. This all took place thanks to the conspiring of his political enemies, who thus prevented his candidacy. With his studies completed and having graduated with a BA that same year, he travelled to the United States for the second time in 1920 with the aim of restarting his previous university course at Harvard. As well as his academic studies in Philosophy, he also studied what would later become known as library sciences on his own account. He returned to Peru towards the end of 1923, having been appointed cataloger of the Library of the University of San Marcos the year before, and soon after becoming its acting director. Here he worked full-time on cataloguing the Library's collection of bibliographies, editing the \\"Bolet√≠n Bibliogr√°fico\\" and completely reorganising the institution. Because of this work he is considered to be one of the pioneers or founders of Peruvian library science, and since 2002 the Central Library of the University of San Marcos has been named after him in a well-deserved tribute. In 1924 he graduated as a Doctor of Arts and was named, by request of his students, as assistant professor in the Faculty of Arts, teaching a course on Psychology and Logic which he completely rewrote based on his studies and academic experiences in North America. After his death, a letter from the amazed and intrigued British philosopher Bertrand Russell reached Lima, congratulating him on the contents of his doctoral thesis and asking him if the Peruvian philosophical movement was at the same level. Zulen only published two works during his lifetime, his university theses, while two further texts were published posthumously by his mother and Dora Mayer. Apart from these books there were also innumerable newspaper articles on indigenous rights, decentralisation and university reform - Zulen himself had tried on two occasions to publish a selection of these in Spain (under the title of Gamonalismo y centralismo or Exploitation and Centralism), but without success.

She may have been briefly involved in the Jacobite rising of 1745, during which the Stuart heir Charles Edward attempted to reclaim the British throne for his father. As \\"Jenny Cameron\\", she became well-known after a number of sensationalised accounts of her life and deeds during the rising were published. The majority were almost entirely fictional and some were intended as anti-Stuart propaganda. Life Jean was the daughter of Allan Cameron (d. ) of Glendessary, who had previously been involved in the 1715 Jacobite rising. The Camerons, who held land in Morvern, were a junior branch of the family of Cameron of Lochiel, hereditary chiefs of Clan Cameron. Jean was further connected with the Camerons of Lochiel through her mother Christian Cameron, a daughter of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel by his third wife. She had two brothers: John (c.1715-1758) the senior brother and heir, and Allan. Few details of her life can be established; she is said to have married an Irish army officer called O'Neill, but was either widowed or (in some accounts) due to his \\"brutal\\" treatment divorced him, returned to Scotland, and was given back her maiden name.Chambers, Robert. (1847) History of the Rebellion in 1745-6, p.215 John Cameron had suffered from a form of disability (described as a \\"palsy\\") since childhood and Jean often acted as his agent.Martin, Carine. (2015) \\"Female Rebels: the Female Figure in Anti-Jacobite Propaganda\\", in Macinnes (ed) Living with Jacobitism 1690-1788, Pickering & Chatto, p.86 Jean's brothers went abroad in 1744, appointing her factor of the family estates. As tacksmen, holding a lease from the clan chief, the family had an obligation to raise their sub-tenants for military service at the chief's request: when in August 1745 Donald Cameron of Lochiel committed to supporting Charles Stuart, the Camerons of Glendessary were required to follow. Archibald, showing \\"Miss Jenny Cammeron\\" dressed in male Highland clothing. Jean Cameron was reported to have been present at Glenfinnan on 19 August when Charles raised his standard; in line with her duties as proxy tacksman, she may have accompanied some of the Cameron levies from Morvern along with her cousin, Alexander Cameron of Dungallon. She may also have subsequently attended the Jacobite court in Edinburgh, but took little further part in the rebellion: a relative later suggested that despite sending some cattle to the Jacobite army she never actually met Charles himself. Aeneas MacDonald, who had been present at Glenfinnan, described her as a \\"widow, nearer fifty than forty [...] a genteel, well-looked handsome woman, with a pair of pretty eyes, and hair as black as jet. She is of a very sprightly genius and is very agreeable in conversation. She was so far from accompanying the Prince's army, that she went off with the rest of the spectators as soon as the army marched\\". Despite Cameron's limited involvement, a number of \\"cruel and apocryphal\\"Munro and Taylor (1971) Glenfinnan and the 45, National Trust for Scotland, p.13 accounts were circulated in England portraying Cameron either as an active military leader, an \\"amazon\\" marching at the head of her men, or as a \\"lewd woman\\" who became Charles's mistress.Macinnes, p.87 These were standard tropes of misogynistic satire of the period: the former credited her with military prowess (including being largely responsible for the victory at Prestonpans), unusual courage, physical strength, and often depicted her wearing male clothing.Macinnes, p.87 The latter, notably a prurient 1746 \\"memoir\\" written by an \\"Alexander Arbuthnot\\", described her as having a voracious sexual appetite and claimed she had borne several illegitimate children. While untrue, such stories were intended to delegitimise the Jacobite cause by identifying it as the party of chaos and by suggesting its male leaders were cowards, morally bankrupt or otherwise inadequate.Macinnes, p.92 Their popularity was to give rise to songs, novels and even a play, and by 1750 \\"Jenny Cameron\\" was a legend, although at the cost of Jean Cameron's good reputation. The truth about Cameron's involvement in the rising was further confused when a woman called Jean or Jenny Cameron was taken prisoner by the government army in 1746 at Stirling; although confused with Jean Cameron of Glendessary, including by the government itself, she claimed to in fact be a milliner from Edinburgh. After the rising After the failure of the rising in 1746, the Cameron tenants in Morvern suffered from punitive actions by government militias, although the Glendessary family seem to have retained most of their property. Cameron herself returned to relative obscurity. In 1751 she purchased the isolated estates of Rodinghead and Blacklaw in Lanarkshire, near modern-day St Leonards, East Kilbride. She is said to have lived a quiet and devout existence at Blacklaw and to have been locally popular; though a Catholic herself she financially supported the local Presbyterian school. A late 18th-century account by a local antiquary remembered her as \\"retaining [...] the striking remains of a graceful beauty\\" and as \\"rather melancholy\\", though an informed and intelligent conversationalist, noting that \\"politics was her favourite topic\\".Ure, David (1793) The History of Rutherglen and East-Kilbride, D Niven, p.166 In the 1830s John Lindsay, an elderly resident of the parish, recalled that \\"very many poor Highlanders were in the habit of visiting her\\".Correspondence in The Edinburgh Literary Journal no 153 (Oct 15,1831), p.228 Cameron died in 1772 and was buried on the Blacklaw estate near her house, afterwards known as \\"Mount Cameron\\"; the East Kilbride poet John Struthers later wrote of the \\"dark firs\\" surrounding the \\"lowly\\" grave.Struthers, John. (1850) The Poetical Works of John Struthers, A. Fullarton, p.103 By 1793 the grave was said to be \\"distinguished by nothing but a turf of grass, which is now almost equal with the ground\\".Ure, p.167 During the 20th century the site of the estate became a golf course, and the house itself was demolished in 1958; however a horse chestnut tree was planted near the grave and a plaque set up in the same year.Cairn marking the grave of Jean Cameron, Mapping memorials to women in Scotland, womenofscotland.org.uk Although suburban development has since taken place in the area, Jean Cameron's grave can still be seen in a small park marked by a cairn, built in 1995 of stone brought from Morvern.

The type strain T. kodakarensis KOD1 is one of the best-studied members of the genus.  History  T. kodakarensis was isolated from a solfatara near the shore of Kodakara Island, Kagoshima, Japan. The isolate was originally named Pyrococcus kodakarensis KOD1, but reclassified as a species of Thermococcus, based on 16S rRNA sequence. Early research with T. kodakarensis was directed mostly at its thermostable enzymes, but its relative ease of handling and genetic manipulation facilitated by natural competence has made it an attractive system for the study of several biological processes.  Properties  T. kodakarensis cells are irregular cocci 1‚Äì2 Œºm in diameter, often occurring in pairs, and are highly motile by means of lophotrichous archaella. The cell wall consists of a layer of diether and tetraether lipids, and an outer glycoprotein coat. T. kodakarensis is an obligate anaerobe, and a heterotroph, growing rapidly on a variety of organic substrates in the presence of elemental sulfur, producing hydrogen sulfide gas. The generation time is estimated to be 40 minutes under optimum conditions. The requirement for elemental sulfur is relieved when pyruvate or starch is used for growth. In the absence of sulfur, hydrogen is produced instead of hydrogen sulfide. Growth is possible at temperature ranging from 60‚Äì100 ¬∞C, with an optimum at 85 ¬∞C. Like other marine organisms, high salt concentrations are required for optimal growth, and cell lysis may occur in dilute solutions.  Genome  In 2005, the genome of T. kodakarensis KOD1 was fully sequenced. The genome consists of a single 2,088,737 base pair circular chromosome, encoding a predicted 2306 proteins.

He was convicted solely on the basis of the testimony of his wife's 6-year-old niece who testified that Elkins was the perpetrator. Brooke later voiced doubts about her identification, claiming that in her initial statement when she said \\"He looked like uncle Clarence\\", she simply meant that he reminded her of Elkins as opposed to being a positive identification and that she only identified him in her testimony because Summit County Prosecutor Maureen O'Connor (now Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court) and main prosecutor Michael Carroll urged her to. Brooke recanted her statement and Elkins appealed on that basis, but his appeal was denied. The family finally gathered funding to test DNA found at the scene and he was excluded. Once again, his appeal was denied. The judge ruled that because the jury convicted Elkins without the DNA results, it was likely that he would have been convicted even if the DNA did not match. Elkins' wife, Melinda, conducted her own investigation. She eventually identified Johnson's next door neighbor, Earl Mann, a convicted sex offender, as a likely suspect. Elkins collected a cigarette butt from Mann, who was serving time at the same prison, and provided it to his defense attorney for testing. Mann's DNA from the cigarette butt was found to be a match to the DNA found at the crime scene. Elkins was finally exonerated after serving 6.5 years in prison. Elkins now works as an advocate to halt wrongful convictions and was instrumental in getting Ohio to pass Senate Bill 77, also known as Ohio's Innocence Protection Act. This bill contains provisions requiring the police to follow best practices for eyewitness identifications, provides incentives for the videotaping of interrogations, and requires that DNA be preserved in homicide and sexual assault cases. A 2009 documentary was made about the case titled Conviction: The True Story of Clarence Elkins. He was also featured on Crime Watch Daily with Chris Hansen in 2017.

This procedure was done in order to reduce symptoms of PTSD. The attack In the early morning hours of June 7, 1998, Clarence Elkins' mother-in-law, 58-year-old Judy Johnson, and his wife's six-year-old niece, Brooke, were brutally attacked by an intruder in Johnson's home in Barberton, Ohio. Johnson had been asleep on her living room couch when she was attacked. She was raped, stabbed, and beaten so severely that her nose, jaw, collarbone and skull were all fractured in the assault. Her cause of death was determined to be strangulation. Brooke, who was sleeping in her grandmother's bed, was awakened by the noise. She recalls: \\"I got out of bed and I went to the kitchen and I looked and I seen that there was a guy in the kitchen, but it scared me, so I ran back to the bedroom.\\" She hid under the covers pretending to be asleep. The intruder entered the bedroom and struck Brooke in the face, knocking her unconscious. She was also beaten, raped, strangled, and suffered a small cut to her throat, but survived without any memory of the attack. She regained consciousness several hours later around 7 am and telephoned a neighbor, leaving a message on their answering machine: > I'm sorry to tell you this, but my grandma died and I need somebody to get > my mom for me. I'm all alone. Somebody killed my grandma. Now please, would > you get ahold of me as soon as you can. Bye. Brooke then walked to a neighbor's house, the home of Earl Mann's common-law- wife Tonia Brasiel, and knocked on the door. Brasiel came to the door, told the nightgown-clad, bruised and bloody child she was cooking breakfast for her children and told her to wait on the porch until she could drive her home, which she did approximately 45 minutes later. Investigation When the police questioned Brooke, she said that the killer \\"looked like Uncle Clarence\\" ‚Äì Mrs. Johnson's 35-year-old son-in-law, Clarence Elkins. The police interpreted this to mean Elkins himself was the attacker. Brasiel also reported to Brooke's mother that Brooke had identified Elkins as the attacker. Years later, Brooke said she had grave doubts about the identification at the time but went along with it. \\"I just wasn't sure it was Uncle Clarence or not,\\" Brooke said. \\"But I was too afraid to say anything\\". Elkins was arrested on the basis of this identification. She later described the situation on Larry King: \\"I woke up and I found my grandma dead, I went to a next door neighbor's house and I told her that it looked like my uncle Clarence and it sounded like him. So, she took me home and she told my mom that -- what I told her and then everyone just started freaking out. And then my mom and dad called the police and my mom and dad told the police that it was my uncle Clarence who did it.\\" When asked how the identification could go so wrong, she replied, \\"Well, I told people that it looked like him and they just went like it was him. They didn't even listen to what I was saying.\\" Trial At trial, the prosecution theorized that Elkins killed his mother-in-law due to frustration because she was meddling in his then-contentious marriage to her daughter, Melinda. The case against Elkins was largely based on the testimony of the 6-year-old eyewitness; however, investigators did not find signs of forced entry, or fingerprints or DNA linking Elkins to the scene. Hairs recovered from Johnson's body were excluded as having come from either Elkins or Johnson. He insisted he was drinking with friends until about 2:40 a.m. Sunday morning, a timeline that Melinda corroborated. She testified that she saw Clarence return home, and knew he remained there, as she was awake most of the night caring for a sick child. The attack occurred sometime between 2:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.; Johnson's residence is more than an hour away by car. Elkins's alibi was also corroborated by his neighbors and friends. Based on the testimony of Brooke identifying him as her attacker, he was convicted on June 10, 1999 of murder, attempted aggravated murder, two counts of rape by force or threat of force, and felonious assault, and sentenced to two terms of life-imprisonment. Elkins' case was first overseen by Judge Beth Whitmore, then tried under Judge John Adams in Akron, Ohio. It was the first murder trial over which Judge Adams had presided. Further investigation After the conviction, Elkins and his wife Melinda began their own investigation and hired a private investigator, Martin Yant, who had previously assisted with the exonerations of numerous wrongfully convicted defendants. Reconciliation Since the night of the crime, Judy's family had been divided due to the case, with some members certain of his guilt and others of his innocence. Brooke had not seen Melinda or her children since the trial. Three years after the trial, the family reconciled. Brooke confessed her uncertainty, stating, \\"It couldn't have been Clarence. The person that hurt me and me-maw had brown eyes. And Clarence has blue eyes.\\" Clarence's attorney interviewed Brooke on camera where she recanted her earlier implication of Elkins. Clarence appealed his conviction with this new evidence. The judge believed the child had been coached by relatives after the reconciliation; the appeal was denied. DNA After the failed appeal, they decided to retest the evidence for DNA. The court ruled that Melinda could have access to DNA recovered from the scene, but she would have to pay the costs of DNA testing. Melinda raised almost $40,000 on her own before asking the Ohio Innocence Project for assistance. They convinced a laboratory in Texas to test two samples for $25,000, half their normal price. The results excluded Clarence Elkins. Clarence appealed the conviction again on the basis of the new DNA evidence. The court ruled that because a jury convicted him without DNA evidence, they would have convicted him even if it didn't match. Summit County Common Court Judge Judy Hunter denied Elkins' motion in July 2005. After the second failed appeal, the family's further research gained information regarding the next door neighbor, Tonia Brasiel, who had driven Brooke home the morning after the attack. It was discovered that Brasiel's common law husband, Earl Mann, was a convicted sex offender who had been released from prison just two days before the murder, on June 5, 1998. It had been overlooked that Mann's wife Tonia left Brooke, a severely beaten and bloody 6-year-old in immediate need of medical care, on the porch for more than 30 minutes instead of telephoning 911 immediately. Melinda determined to sample Mann's DNA, but he was in prison by that time. Coincidentally, Mann was serving his time at Mansfield Correctional facility, the same facility where Clarence was serving his sentence. Clarence Elkins collected a cigarette butt discarded by Mann. He sent the cigarette to his attorney who sent it to a laboratory for testing. It was a match. Earl Mann Earl G. Mann was born in Melbourne, Florida, before relocating to Ohio. He had an extensive criminal record for crimes ranging from a racially motivated assault on another man to robberies. During 2002, Mann was convicted of raping three girls, his daughters, all under the age of 10. He had three children with Tonia Brasiel, who lived next door to Judith Johnson. Brooke frequently played with their daughters. In 2005, after Mann was identified as a suspect, Barberton police officer Gerard Antenucci brought to the attention of the prosecution the existence of a memorandum from 1999, four months before Elkins' trial. Antenucci arrested Mann for an unrelated robbery. During the process of his arrest, a drunk and belligerent Mann asked why he hadn't been arrested for the murder of Judy Johnson. Per policy, the arresting officer sent a memo to the detectives working the Johnson murder. This statement was never disclosed to the defense. After Mann was identified, Tonia admitted during questioning that Mann returned home the early morning hours after the murder with deep scratches on his back. When she questioned him, he claimed he'd been with a \\"wild woman\\". According to Brasiel, when Brooke knocked on the door following the attack, he became angry and insisted that Tonia not let her in nor call police. Melinda Elkins has stated that she suspects Brasiel may have influenced Brooke's identification of Clarence. Brasiel was the first person to hear the six-year-old's alleged identification of Elkins. Despite Mann's suspicious behavior that morning, Tonia reported to Brooke's mother, after driving Brooke home, that the child had named Clarence as the attacker. Furthermore, Brasiel testified at Elkins's trial that the child had told her that Clarence was the perpetrator. Release Despite the DNA evidence connecting Mann to the murder, the district attorney refused to release Elkins. Elkins's attorney communicated Ohio State Attorney General Jim Petro. Petro personally contacted prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh, on several occasions, regarding the case. He similarly discovered that she was not interested in reviewing the case. Petro then took the unorthodox action of having a press conference, in order to publicly pressure the prosecutor to dismiss the charges. The prosecutors performed more DNA testing of hairs found at the scene, and again, Mann was identified. On December 15, 2005, the charges against Elkins were dismissed, and he was released from prison. He filed for divorce in September 2006, which was finalized in 2007. In 2008, ten years after the crimes were committed, in a plea agreement to avoid the death penalty, Mann pleaded guilty to charges of aggravated rape and aggravated murder for the death of Johnson, as well as aggravated rape of Brooke. He was sentenced to 55 years to life in prison, and will not be eligible for parole until age 92. Lawsuits Clarence Elkins settled with the state of Ohio for US$1.075 million. He later filed a civil suit against the Barberton police for failing to disclose the incriminating statement by Earl Mann during his 1999 arrest. Barberton police sought to have the case dismissed, but failed. The judge ruled that had Mann's statement to Officer Gerard Antenucci been disclosed to the defense, they most likely would have noticed the proximity of Mann, a convicted felon, to the Johnson residence, as well as the behavior of Tonia Brasiel on the morning after the murder. Mann's DNA would almost certainly have been tested, and Elkins would almost certainly not have been convicted. Elkins later settled with the Barberton police for $5.25 million. Reform efforts Melinda Elkins Dawson was instrumental in getting Ohio to pass Senate Bill 262, also known as Post Conviction DNA Law. This bill contains provisions for DNA testing post-conviction, using outcome determinitive guidelines. Melinda also serves as Chair of the Board of Directors for \\"Ohioans to stop executions\\". As a public speaker and victim advocate, she continues to fight for justice and to increase awareness of wrongful convictions. Clarence Elkins was instrumental in getting Ohio to pass Senate Bill 77, also known as Ohio's Innocence Protection Act. This bill includes provisions requiring the police to follow best practices for eyewitness identifications, provides incentives for the videotaping of interrogations, and requires that DNA be preserved in homicide and sexual assault cases. Elkins spent much time advocating for what has been termed the \\"national model\\" of innocence reform bills, and the \\"most important piece of criminal justice legislation in Ohio in a century\\". Clarence also engages in public speaking about his case and wrongful convictions in general at universities and other locations across the United States. Philanthropy During 2011, Clarence and his new wife, Molly, established the Clarence Elkins Scholarship at the University of Cincinnati College of Law. This scholarship provides $5,000 annually to the Ohio Innocence Project housed at UC Law School, and includes a scholarship to two students in the Ohio Innocence Project each year. Movies In 2009, a television documentary about the Elkins case was released, named \\"Conviction: The True Story of Clarence Elkins\\".Conviction: The True Story of Clarence Elkins https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1377139/ Melinda's story of her efforts was later optioned by movie producer/screenwriter David Massar, who said a script is in development.

Biography Verelst was born in Vienna, but moved with her family to London at the age of three. Her father was the Dutch painter Harman Verelst, who taught her and her brothers Simon and Cornelis how to paint.Maria Verelst in the RKD She is known for miniatures and portraits as well as becoming a language teacher. She spoke many different languages such as Dutch and Latin. According to the Dutch artist biographer Jacob Campo Weyerman, she overheard some Dutch men in a London theatre speaking about artists in their native language and she corrected them. The gentlemen excused themselves and continued speaking in Italian. She corrected them again, and they continued in Latin with the remark that they would not be interrupted in that language again. When she again spoke, it was to insist that women could not be barred from learning languages, despite the fact that they were not allowed to participate in public proceedings. The gentlemen were so impressed they inquired of her occupation and came to visit her the next day bearing gifts and to order their portraits made. Juffrouw Verelst Biography, p 254 in De levens-beschryvingen der Nederlandsche konst-schilders (Volume 3, 1729) by Jacob Campo Weyerman  Career  Her earliest paintings have not survived. In the 1720s she worked with William Aikman and Charles Jervas but her style more closely reflected Thomas Hudson by the next decade. Landscape backgrounds and informal dress were her style of choice for the majority of her female subjects. Hayes notes that while her modeling is firm, her staging of drapery is simple. She also worked with Sir James Thornhill around this same period of time. Murals have been preserved in England that have been attributed as a joint effort between the two painters.  Works  Some of her works include: Portrait of Lady Smythe, three-quarter-length, Portrait of a lady, half- length, in a silver white gown, Nature morte aux huitres et aux crabs, Portrait of Duke of Marlborough, Portrait of a woman, Lady Middleton, Portrait of a lady in a yellow dress seated, with a wooded landscape beyond, Portrait of a Lady with a Country Estate in the Distance, and Duke of Chandos in the dressing room.  Family Tree   End of Life  She died in London in 1744, nearly 40 years after her father, and 20 years after her uncle. Both of whom were accomplished painters and her earliest mentors.

Also known as Barney Duffy and Dan Duffy, Barney played alongside famous Pittsburgh Pirate Honus Wagner (known as the Flying Dutchman). The Oklahoma native began his baseball career in 1910 in Helena, Montana.He was purchased by the Pirates in the fall of 1913. He then was sent to St. Joe in the Western League where he played during 1914. Recalled that fall, he was turned over to Youngstown in the Central league, remaining there until the club disbanded. In 1916 he was with Grand Rapids and then sold to Wheeling. The pitcher was 5'11\\" and weighed around 180 lbs. In 1913 Barney played for the Great Falls Electrics. The September 5, 1913 Salt Lake Tribune reports that Barney \\"started under a handicap. He was unknown, and there were those who predicted his early finish. The things that were said to him would have taken the heart out of any 19 year old lad. But Barney Duffy was different.

He is quoted in the January 31, 1914 edition of the Pittsburgh Press as writing, \\"I was certainly glad to hear that you had secured E. Konetchy. that was a great deal for your club. I consider Koney the best first baseman I have ever seen, and I have looked at a few of them in my time. Am also glad that you got Barney Duffy from Great Falls. Hang onto him whatever you do. He is the makings of one of the greatest pitchers of all time. He beat my club out of the pennant last summer, and did it in a single week.

Biography Silas Albertson Underhill (1840-1906) was born the son of Alexander Underhill (1810‚Äì1891) and Phebe W. Albertson (1818‚Äì1847) in a frame house on the north-east corner of Park and Bedford Avenues in Brooklyn, New York, that is no longer extant. His father Alexander Underhill was born in house Major John Andre was captured on the highway from Peekskill to Somerstown. When Alexander was a young man he came to Brooklyn and engage in the mil business with Delmonico Farm‚Äîthe largest dairy in and around Brooklyn. He was one of twelve students to receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts from Haverford College during commencement exercises in 1860. Following that study, he went on to Harvard University where he studied law and graduated in 1862 with the degree of Bachelor of Laws. As a member of the Society of Friends the Society was opposed to war, though Underhill himself believed in defensive war. Ultimately he decided to give his services and was enlisted in the Regiment of Colonel Stewart L. Woodford. The Regiment was stationed on Staten Island. Soon he was sent to the front in Virginia. Engaged as a private soldier, he never participated in a battle, though was part in three or four skirmishes. He was certain of the fact that he never killed a man because he could not shoot straight enough. By virtue of joining the war he resigned from the Society of Friends of which he was a member. General Steward L. Woodford recognized he was a college man and selected him as one of his secretaries to write in his headquarters. Underhill maintained this position until the end of the war. He remained with General Woodford including when he became the Military Governor of Charleston, South Carolina. The fact that Underhill survived the war is no small feat. One account of Underhill follows: > No less conspicuous was Silas A. Underhill... I mostly see him towering > above all others in the fray of the shinny ground, or resting watchfully on > his long shinny, awaiting the ball which was sure to go home with his well- > directed blow. Enlisting as a private soldier, and continuing such from > principle throughout the entire Rebellion, he survived its vicissitudes and > dangers. After the war Underhill returned to New York and found employment in a law office. Following the war he applied and was reinstated into the Society of Friends in May 1868. He also became a member of the Ulysses S. Grant Post #327 of the Grand Army of the Republic. Underhill took an active interest in the Friends'; First Day School in 1866. He remained Superintendent for nearly twenty years. He also served as Clerk of Friends' Monthly Meeting. Late in life Silas A. Underhill married Frances Gertrude Lowerre, the daughter of Benjamin and Anna Lowerre, who already had a son and daughter. She had three children by way of her first husband Samuel Willis Rushmore. He lived at 119 Montague Street in Brooklyn, New York. Underhill studied law and practiced for several years before he became attached to the Supreme Court. Following the death of Silas Underhill, his wife Frances Gertrude Underhill appears to have moved to 335 Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn. Underhill was actively involved in efforts to erect a memorial for his Colonial era ancestor Captain John Underhill at the Underhill Burying Ground in Lattingtown, New York, and is named on the dedicatory plaque on the monument. He also served as Recording Secretary of the Underhill Society of America between 1892 and 1896. Silas Albertson Underhill died December 24, 1906, in the office of the Brooklyn Union Gas Company. His death was recounted as follows in one source: \\"Went into an office to pay a gas bill. Sat on a settee. His head partly fell. Asked if he was sick. Breathing heavy. In ten minutes he was dead.\\" A Memorial Address on Silas Albertson Underhill was made at a meeting of the Underhill Society of America on February 16, 1907. The role of Silas Underhill in the dedication ceremony for the Captain John Underhill monument at the Underhill Burying Ground was recognized in a re-enactment that took place in 2008.

Retrieved 2011-12-29. Description The colour of an adult dusky damselfish varies from brownish-olive to dark grey, with fine, darker-coloured, vertical stripes on the body. The fins are large with sometimes a blue rim around the edge of the dorsal and anal fins. The dorsal fin has 12 spines and 15-16 soft rays while the anal fin has two spines and 13-14 soft rays. The dusky damselfish can be distinguished from the very similar longfin damselfish (Stegastes diencaeus) by the shorter, less angular dorsal and anal fins. The maximum length is , but is a more typical length.Territorial Behavior of the Dusky Damselfish, Stegastes fuscus, at Champagne Reef Michael Wachter. Retrieved 2011-12-29. The juvenile dusky damselfish is pearly grey with blue spots on the top of its head. It has a large, blue-rimmed, black eyespot where the dorsal fin spines meet the dorsal fin soft rays, and a smaller, similarly coloured eyespot on the caudal peduncle. Some juveniles off the coast of southeastern Brazil have a vivid yellow and orange band on the back and dorsal fin.Unusual coloration pattern in juveniles of Stegastes fuscus (Actinopterygii: Pomacentridae) Zootaxa. Retrieved 2011-12-29. Distribution Stegastes fuscus occurs in shallow waters off Brazil, where it is common on both rocky and coral reefs at depths down to . It is also reported from the Caribbean Sea, but another species, Pomacentrus dorsopunicans, possibly was misidentified there. Another population is reported from Senegal, but this lacks confirmation.Stegastes fuscus IUCN. Retrieved 2011-12-30. Biology About 70% of the food consumed by the dusky damselfish consists of algae, mostly red, filamentous algae, but some calcareous algae are also eaten. The rest of their diet is small invertebrates. The feeding activities of the damselfish prevent coarser seaweeds, such as Jania spp., becoming dominant and greatly influences the structure of the benthic community. Behaviour The dusky damselfish is a territorial species. It guards part of the seabed and repels intruders, sometimes chasing away fish several times its own size.Territorial Habits of Stegastes fuscus Megan Pugh. Retrieved 2011-12-30. The richer the site was in suitable algae for feeding, the more aggressive the fish became. Besides members of its own species, the main species chased away were parrotfish, bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), bicolour damselfish (Stegastes partitus) and ocean surgeonfish (Acanthurus bahianus). Certain other fish species, such as the smooth trunkfish (Rhinesomus triqueter) and the graysby (Cephalopholis cruentata), were not chased away. The author of the study surmised it was the food source rather than the geographical area being guarded, and these fish were not considered to be threats because they did not graze algae, instead feeding on small invertebrates. An alternative possibility was these fish benefited the dusky damselfish in some other way, such as by providing some protection against predators or by removing invertebrates that feed on algae.
