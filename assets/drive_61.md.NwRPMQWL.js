Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Design and development The development of the Dragonfly was sponsored by the Nelson Engine Company to promote the use of their H-44 four cylinder two- stroke engine. The engine was mounted in the rear of the fuselage pod, in pusher configuration, with the wooden two bladed propeller below the metal tail boom. The fuel tank holds , enough for self-launching, but not for cross- country powered flight. The Dragonfly shares the Baby Albatross's molded plywood fuselage pod, aluminium tube tail boom and strut-braced double spar wooden wing, covered in aircraft fabric aft of the spar. The leading edge is a plywood D-cell. The aircraft features dual controls and a retractable tricycle landing gear with a steerable nose wheel. The engine is started by a ratchet- wire recoil start system that allows restarts in flight, as well as on the ground. Federal Aviation Administration certification of the type was achieved on 21 April 1947, with Nelson Aircraft Corporation as the certificate holder and the type officially known as Nelson Auxiliary Power Glider BB-1.

His grandfather, David Napier (1785‚Äì1873), had moved to London from Scotland and by 1836 had established an engineering company in Lambeth called D. Napier & Son. Montague Napier bought the business from the executors of his father's estate in 1895, and diversified into producing machine tools for the cycle industry. Following a meeting with businessman and racing driver Selwyn Edge in 1899 Napier diversified into automobile manufacturer, and for a time his company was the leading supplier of luxury cars in the British market. His focus switched from cars to aircraft engines after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and he developed the very successful Lion engine. Napier's failing health forced his move to the south of France in 1915, but he continued to work as a design consultant for his company. He died at his home in Cannes on 22 January 1931, aged 60. Early life Motor historian Peter King describes Napier as \\"very secretive by nature\\"; not much is known about his early life. He was born on 14 April 1870 at 68 York Road, Lambeth, London, the youngest of the four sons of James Murdoch Napier and his wife, Fanny Jemima, n√©e Mackenzie. His father had taken over his own father's interest in the engineering business he had set up there by 1836, making printing machinery for the newspaper industry. The business diversified unto making coin-weighing machines for the Royal Mint, but by the time of James Murdoch Napier's death in 1895 it was in decline. Napier had worked in the family business from an early age, but he was not doing so at the time of his father's death. He bought the business from the executors of his father's estate and diversified into producing machine tools for the cycle industry. As an avid racing cyclist he had been participating in races of the North Road Cycling Club alongside riders like Selwyn Edge. In the 1891 100 Mile Road Race on the Great North Road he finished fourth. Business career Napier met Selwyn Edge again in 1899, for whom he agreed to build a car based on Edge's Panhard et Levassor, which he had bought after it came second in the 1896 Paris‚ÄìMarseilles race. So impressed was Edge with the result that he contracted to buy six more cars, and set up a showroom in London from which to sell them. The first cars were ready by 1900, and so successful were they that Napier decided to move his company to larger premises in Acton, London. While Napier concentrated on the engineering Edge focused on the marketing and publicity. In 1902 he drove a Napier to victory in that year's Gordon Bennett Cup, the first British victory in an international motor race. Napier cars dominated the British luxury car market until 1906, but Napier was unconvinced that there was a sustainable long-term market for such vehicles, unlike Rolls-Royce, his main competitor. Napier therefore set up a new company to develop more popular cars. Following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Napier's interest turned increasingly to aircraft engines. Initially Napier's built engines designed by the Royal Aircraft Factory, but at his own expense Napier subsequently designed his own, the Lion. By 1924 about half of all British aircraft were powered by Napier's engine, and Napier automobile production had ceased. Later life Napier's health had broken down by 1915, probably as a result of cancer, and he moved to the south of France from where he continued working as a consultant to his company. He was unable to design a satisfactory successor to the Lion, and therefore Napier was overtaken in the aero-engine market by Bristol and Rolls-Royce. Napier died at his home in Cannes, Villa des Cistes, on 22 January 1931, aged 60. The income from his estate of more than ¬£1 million was left to his nurse and reputed mistress, Norah Mary Fryer, for the duration of her life, after which the residue of the estate was to be given to cancer research. In 1903 he had married school governess Alice Caroline Mary, n√©e Paterson, with whom he had two sons and two daughters; the couple were legally separated in 1922.

Biography Ferguson belonged to the Fergusons of Kilkerran. He graduated at Glasgow University in 1638, and was ordained minister of Kilwinning, Ayrshire, in 1643. He was a member of the assembly of 1648, and declined calls to both Edinburgh and Glasgow. He was so highly esteemed by the Earl of Eglintoun that, though appointed to the chair of divinity at Glasgow in 1661, he never left Kilwinning to enter on that office. He was a man of eminent piety, and at the same time \\"much admired\\", as a writer of his life in Wodrow's Analecta says, \\"for his great and singular wisdom and prudence, being reckoned one of the wisest men in a nation, most fit to be a counsellor to any monarch in Europe\\". In the controversy between the resolutioners and protesters he adopted the side of the former, but it is recorded that he confessed before his death that he was wrong. Probably in consequence of the support of Lord Eglintoun, he was not interfered with at the Restoration in his ministry at Kilwinning. He died 13 March 1667. Works Ferguson is remembered and esteemed at this day as the author of a series of excellent commentaries on St. Paul's Epistles. In Charteris's Catalogue of Scotch Divines he is called an author \\"of great reputation\\". Spurgeon characterises his commentaries as those of \\"a grand, gracious, savoury divine\\". His works are: # Expositions of the Epistles to the Philippians and Colossians, Edinburgh, 1656. # Expositions of the Epistles to Galatians and Ephesians, Edinburgh, 1659. # Exposition of the Epistles to the Thessalonians, Glasgow, 1675. # Refutation of the Errors of Toleration, Erastianism, Independency, and Separation, Edinburgh, 1692.

Raised in the rural community of Glenevis, Alberta, Vanderwolf went on to earn a BSc from the University of Alberta and completed graduate work with Donald Hebb at McGill University, completing his PhD in 1962 (Buzsaki and Bland 2015). Following completion of his PhD, Case spent a year at the California Institute of Technology with Roger Sperry (1962‚Äì1963) and another year with Konrad Akert, the Founder of the Brain Research Institute of the University of Zurich (1963‚Äì1964). Vanderwolf spent over 30 years at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, during which time he published over 140 papers on the relation of hippocampal, neocortical, and pyriform cortical activity to behavior and the dependence of many of these brain-behavior relations on the activity of central neurons that release the transmitter substances acetylcholine and serotonin.(Whishaw and Bland 1998; Buzsaki and Bland 2015). As early as 1964, he was among the first investigators to carefully study the correlation between observable motor activity and brain waves. Recording from the thalamus and hippocampus of the behaving rat, he found a reliable relationship between 'voluntary movement' and rhythmic (theta) EEG activity. This early paper (Vanderwolf and Heron, 1964) was followed up by a detailed account of a variety of motor behaviors and hippocampal theta oscillation (Vanderwolf 1969). He showed that in the waking rat, hippocampal EEG is dominated by thetaoscillations (6 to 10 Hz; for this he coined a new term, rhythmic slow activity or RSA) during locomotion, rearing, exploratory head turning, and sniffing. In contrast, in other observable behaviors such as eating, drinking, grooming, and immobility, theta is replaced by \\"large amplitude irregular activity\\" (LIA). He published two books, An Odyssey Through the Brain, Behavior and Mind and The Evolving Brain: The Mind and the Neural Control of Behavior, that provide an overview of his academic career and research findings. In 2000, he was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Lethbridge. He died unexpectedly in his home on June 16, 2015 in London, Ontario, at the age of 79.

Resolution 1624, along with Resolution 1625 (2005), was adopted at a meeting of heads of state or government. The resolution was drafted by the United Kingdom. Resolution =Observations= In the preamble of the resolution, the Council reaffirmed its intention to combat terrorism in all its forms in accordance with the United Nations Charter, while stressing that measures taken should conform to international law. It condemned acts of terrorism and the incitement and glorification of terrorist acts, expressing concern that such actions pose a threat to human rights and the peace, stability and economic development of all states. Furthermore, the Council recalled the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and provisions relating to freedom of expression and the right to asylum. The Security Council continued by expressing concern at the increasing number of victims of terrorism, the nature of terrorism as contrary to the United Nations Charter and the role of the United Nations in combatting terrorism. It called on all countries to become party to international conventions regarding counter-terrorism and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. Meanwhile, the resolution emphasised efforts for dialogue to broaden understanding among civilisations to prevent any indiscriminate targeting of religions and cultures. In this regard, the role of media, business and society was important to promote tolerance. The Council recognised that in a globalised world, states act co-operatively to prevent terrorists from using sophisticated communication to incite terrorist acts. =Acts= The Security Council called upon all states to adopt measures necessary to prohibit incitement to terrorist action and deny safe haven to persons where there is credible evidence that they had been involved in such conduct. Furthermore, countries were asked to strengthen their international borders through combatting fraudulent travel documents, enhance terrorist screening and passenger security procedures, and improve understanding among civilisations. It was stressed that measures taken had to comply with international law and report to the Counter-Terrorism Committee. Finally, the Counter-Terrorism Committee was instructed to engage in dialogue with states on how they implemented the current resolution, promoting the best legal practice and information exchange, and to report back within twelve months.

Apart from the titular story, it contains three more: The Handy Smurf, The Smurf Paint and A Smurfy Party. Plots =Baby Smurf= During a blue moon night, a stork leaves a baby Smurf at the door of a Smurf house and leaves. The Smurfs quickly hand the baby to one another until he ends up with Smurfette. The next day, all the Smurfs converge to see the baby, save for Grouchy Smurf, who hates baby Smurfs. Brainy Smurf asks if the baby is Smurfette's, which offends her. The baby is adopted by all Smurfs (save for Grouchy). Handy Smurf makes a bed for the baby, including a machine to swing it, but Papa Smurf opts for swinging the bed at hand. Greedy Smurf bakes a cake for Baby Smurf, but Smurfette tells him that Baby is too small for cakes. Other Smurfs wash Baby's dirty clothes. When Baby sees Grouchy passing, he tries to imitate his gruff expression, which seems to mellow Grouchy down, but he fakes apathy when Smurfette asks him to carry the baby. Brainy asks Papa Smurf where the baby Smurfs come from, but Papa's answer is so complicated that he still doesn't understand anything. At night, Baby Smurf's crying doesn't let any Smurf sleep. The next day, the Smurfs prepare a party in Baby Smurf's honor, but the stork arrives with a note saying that Baby was a \\"delivery error\\" and must be taken away. Everybody is upset including Smurfette who goes into a non stop crying spree, but they don't have any option but return the baby. However, they soon find that Grouchy Smurf has escaped with the baby. The Smurfs seek for Grouchy and Baby throughout the forest. Grouchy manages to avert being found, but then he decides to return to the village after noticing the many dangers Baby would face in the forest as well as Baby Smurf falling ill by catching a cold. After the Smurfs give Baby back to the stork, life in the village turns sad; even Jokey Smurf and the Smurf getting his trademark explosive present try to laugh but end crying. That same night, the stork returns with Baby, with a note saying that Grouchy Smurf's care for the baby has caused the baby to be allowed to stay with the Smurfs. =The Handy Smurf= Handy Smurf creates a drill, but he begins to try it on everything (the water pump, Harmony Smurf's flute, etc.), which causes trouble for the Smurfs' daily lives. When he's found out, the other Smurfs catch him and make a new invention to get revenge on him: a rotating kicking machine that keeps kicking Handy himself. =The Smurf Paint= The Smurfs try to paint the village to restore it, and some of them add their \\"personal touch\\" to the labor. Several Smurfs have difficulties painting, so Handy Smurf creates a paint-spraying system, which he makes work with Harmony Smurf's help. Meanwhile, Gargamel creates an invisible paint, and uses it on himself to follow some Smurfs to the village. While Papa Smurf goes to his lab to make a formula against Gargamel, Handy and Harmony spray paint on Gargamel, making him visible. Gargamel, blinded by the paint, goes stumbling back at his own house. He decides to use a formula to become a dragon, but accidentally drops the remaining invisible paint on the book with the formula. At the village, Papa Smurf still works on his formula, not knowing that Gargamel has already left. =A Smurfy Party= Gargamel finds that the Smurfs are organizing a party, so he disguises as a bunny to ask them to invite him. The Smurfs immediately recognise Gargamel, but bring him (blindfolded) to the village to give him a lesson. Papa Smurf drops a starch solution on Gargamel, who is immobilised. The party continues until a sudden rain dissolves the solution and Gargamel gets free. However, a Smurf ties Gargamel's feet to a rocket that sends him away to the forest, where a fox sees the bunny-disguised Gargamel and starts chasing him. Publication and other media *This book takes several details from the Smurfs TV series: Smurfette lives in the Smurf Village. In the episode Once In A Blue Moon Smurfette wrote an angry letter protesting the return of Baby Smurf to the \\"creators\\" instead of going into an uncontrollable crying spree. Most of the Smurfs begin to use personalized costumes (Handy with overalls, Vanity with a flower on his bonnet, etc.). Baker Smurf and Vanity Smurf had sporadically used their \\"own\\" costumes before, but from this album on, it becomes permanent. The Smurf in Baker attires is Greedy Smurf. Later stories show Baker and Greedy as separate characters.

Biography Return of the North Pole expedition, 1938 Arctic exploration In 1937, after finishing the air force command academy, Belakhov was appointed head of political administration of the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route (GlavSevMorPut), one of the largest Soviet agencies, governing the Soviet territory north of the Arctic Circle and east of the Ural mountains. In this role, Belakhov oversaw the internal affairs of the agency and the logistics of the Arctic exploration programs. The agency was at that time headed by Otto Schmidt. Belakhov continued as the political chief under Ivan Papanin, the new chief of CDNSR after Otto Schmidt's resignation from the agency's leadership in 1939. World War II In 1940, Belakhov was appointed head of political administration and deputy minister of the Soviet Merchant Fleet. In this capacity, Belakhov was commissioned to manage several key projects, reporting to Anastas Mikoyan, the deputy head of the government and a stalwart of Soviet politics. The projects included the organization of transportation of war aid to the USSR from the U.S. through the Lend-Lease program, supply of fuel and transportation of troops for the Battle of Stalingrad. Family thumb Belakhov was married to Maria Belakhova, a writer and educator known for her work in children's literature and education in the Soviet Union, mentorship of many of the country's prominent children's writers, and her own works.

Critics say it is biased, not peer reviewed, and not a legitimate scientific journal. It is funded by the US Department of Justice. Background The journal published online quarterly by the Institute on Global Drug Policy and the International Scientific and Medical Forum on Drug Abuse. These are part of the Drug Free America Foundation, an organization that has referred to harm reduction efforts as \\"harm promotion\\", and characterized such efforts as \\"a tactic to normalize drug use\\". The stated goal of the Institute itself is as follows: > The Institute is charged with creating and strengthening international laws > that hold drug users and dealers criminally accountable for their actions. > It will vigorously promote treaties and agreements that provide clear > penalties to individuals who buy, sell or use harmful drugs... The institute > supports efforts to oppose policies based on the concept of harm reduction. Criticism The publication has been criticized for having a political agenda to combat harm-reduction policies. It is funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice. The president of the Canadian Health Libraries Association has also said it appears to be driven more by a political agenda than by science: > \\"That journal, which looks legitimate, which is being used by the Canadian > government to back up various decisions, is supported by groups that believe > enforcement is the route to reducing drug use.\\" Also referring to this journal, authors in the Canadian Medical Association Journal wrote, > Efforts to undermine the science specific to HIV prevention for injection > drug users are becoming increasingly sophisticated. One new and worrisome > trend is the creation of internet sites posing as open-access, peer-reviewed > scientific journals. One such example, funded by the Drug Free America > Foundation, contains a review of the research supporting needle exchange > program and declares that the \\"effectiveness of NEPs [ needle-exchange > programs ] to reduce HIV among IDUs [ injection drug users ] is overrated;\\" > it further claims that the WHO position on needle exchange programs \\"is not > based on solid evidence.\\" An opinion piece in The Lancet Infectious Diseases stated \\"To our knowledge, this is the first time a lobby group such as the Drug Free America Foundation has created for itself a venue for the dissemination of opinion essays, which to the untrained eye could easily be mistaken for a scientific journal\\". Use by Canadian Government In 2007, the Canadian Minister of Health, Tony Clement, cited the journal to justify the Canadian Government's objections to harm-reduction programs.

None of the tracks on the Krank release are on the album, as the album features a different version of Krank, and does not feature any version of Day Of Light. The single features remixes by band leader Sascha Konietzko, former band members Tim Skold and Bill Rieflin, and Sebastian Komor of Icon of Coil. Cover art The single's cover image was designed by longtime KMFDM cover artist Aidan \\"Brute!\\" Hughes, who said that he was asked by band founder Sascha Konietzko to create an illustration of the entire band. He used a variety of photos from the band's last tour and individually sketched all the band members before layering them together to create a caricatured group image. Video The band released a video for the song, their first in nine years, and first official video since 1997's \\"Megalomaniac\\" video. The video, which was simultaneously recorded in Seattle, Hamburg, and Portland, Oregon, was produced by Kelly Raine. The band released a teaser for the video a few weeks before the release of the single, which was then temporarily sold out on the band's website due to high demand. Reception \\"Krank\\" has been generally well received. The song was described as \\"adrenalin-pumping\\" and \\"self-assured\\" by Ross Hoon of Dominion Magazine. Mike Kieffer of Auxiliary Magazine called the single \\"nothing groundbreaking, yet still good\\", adding that the single hinted that the upcoming album WTF?! could be great. Niggels Uhlenbruch of Reflections of Darkness called the song \\"an aggressive stomper in the best KMFDM tradition\\", but also commented that it was \\"a bit like KMFDM by numbers\\". He described the mixes of the song as ready for club play. In its second week of release, the song \\"Krank\\" reached No. 5 on the DAC German Alternative Chart.

J-13 light fighter programme At the end of the 1960s, the PLAAF started looking into new light fighter designs to replace the J-6, which was based on the 1950s vintage MiG-19. Shenyang nr. 601 institute proposed an 11,5 ton light fighter design with cantilever wings and fuselage side-mounted air intakes, which in some ways resembled a smaller sibling of the Dassault Mirage F1. Although airframe design advanced fairly rapidly with a preliminary prototype finished in the early 80s, engine integration proved a difficult task. Both the recently acquired Spey Mk. 202 turbofan, built under license as the WS-9, and an indigenous engine developed by 606 Engine Design Institute, known as the WS-6, were considered to power the light fighter. As the fighter was to have a single engine, the PLAAF considered the 9,300 kg thrust WS-9 to be somewhat inadequate, since the design required the J-13 to have a thrust to weight ratio of at least 1:1. The WS-9 was supposed to become a 12,200 kg thrust turbofan, but development proved to be a very challenging task. As the J-8II programme started to flourish in the middle 1980s, the J-13 programme was accord lower priority, but in the wake of the new and very successful F-16 and Mig-29 programmes abroad, the programme continued nonetheless. In 1992 the PLAAF finally put a stop to the project because of the progress of the J-10 programme and the access to Russian Su-27 Flankers and engine technology. WP-15 In 1982, China received a handful of MiG-23MS fighters from Egypt, in exchange for a 'friendship price' (at the time quoted to be only 1 million dollars each) for the recent F-6 and F-7 fighters sold to the Egyptian air force. Apart from serving the J-8II project with a successful engine inlet architecture, which resulted in the final success of the 'Finback', the deal also provided China with a new engine design. The Tumanski R-29, with a dry thrust of 10,000 kg, was also considers to be a viable candidate for the J-13 programme, and was to be produced internally with the WP-15 name. Again, the programme didn't flourish, mostly because of the availability of modern Russian turbofan engine technology from 1990 onwards.

Resolution 1625, along with Resolution 1624 (2005), was adopted at a meeting of heads of state or government. Declaration =Observations= The Security Council expressed \\"deep concern\\" at the human cost and material loses caused by armed conflict. It reaffirmed the importance of refraining from the threat or use of force in international relations, the need to adopt a conflict prevention strategy to address the root causes of conflict and crises, and to strengthen the role of the United Nations in preventing violent conflict and build partnerships between international and regional organisations. The preamble of the declaration made reference to the African Union in particular, and its position on the unconstitutional changes of government on the continent. It also recognised the role of civil society in conflict prevention. =Acts= The resolution expressed the Council's determination to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations in preventing armed conflict, by: :(a) assessing developments in regions at risk of armed conflict and ask the Secretary-General to provide information; :(b) follow-up the preventative- diplomacy initiatives of the Secretary-General; :(c) supporting regional mediation initiatives; :(d) supporting capacities for early warning; :(e) requesting assistance from the United Nations Economic and Social Council; :(f) taking measures to tackle illicit arms trafficking and the use of mercenaries; :(g) enhancing institutions conducive to peace, stability and sustainable development; :(h) supporting African states to build independent judicial institutions. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General was required to provide information on potential armed conflicts to the Council, particularly from Africa, assist countries at risk of conflict and promote regional conflict management initiatives. The Council stressed the importance of conflict prevention strategies to avoid a negative impact on security, economic, social, political and humanitarian sectors in countries facing crisis. A regional approach was also highlighted, particularly with regard to demobilisation, demilitarisation and reintegration, and action would be taken against the illegal exploitation of natural resources which fuelled conflict. Increased co-operation between the United Nations and regional or subregional organisations was also called for, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. The latter half of the resolution addressed African nations. The Council encouraged African states to African Union Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact of 31 January 2005 and to work with the United Nations Secretariat and regional offices to implement measures for establishing peace, security, stability, democracy and sustainable development. Meanwhile, the international community was called upon to support African nations in the aforementioned objectives, and to develop the capacities of African regional and subregional organisations to deploy civilian and military assets when needed.

He joined the Quartel General da Regi√£o Militar (Military Regional General Garrison) in Angola in 1969‚Äì71, serving in the Estado Maior do Ex√©rcito (Army Staff) and regional command, advancing to the position of Brigadier by August 1973. =Presidency of the Azores= Pinto de Magalh√£es was nominated to the position of Military Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces in the Azores on 6 January 1975 (a function that he served until 29 August 1976). He arrived in Ponta Delgada during a period of heightened tensions after the Revolution, during a political crisis and ideological conflict between anti-communists and separatists. On 6 June 1975 a protest in Ponta Delgada was held, in direct and conscious defiance of a law prohibiting such political gatherings. Quickly the protest turned into a separatist manifestation. The military tried to block protesters from descending on the Concei√ß√£o Palace, which at the time was the residence of the Civil Governor (Ant√≥nio Borges Coutinho). Magalh√£es met with Coutinho, but in the middle of the confusion, Coutinho abruptly resigned. The news of this event provoked a wave of cheers from the protesters and demands for the Azores' complete independence. What followed were negotiations between the commander-in-chief and a group of protesters. After the protesters had calmed- down, orders were sent to arrest some of the personalities considered responsible for the subversive acts related to the agitation, and they were deported to Terceira. As a consequence of these events, a Junta Governativa Regional (Governing Regional Junta) was established under decree-law 458/B/75 on 22 August 1975. The Junta was presided over by the military Commandant, allied to a civilian council that included representatives of the leading non- communist political parties (Social Democrats, Socialists and Democratic- Centrists). It operated as a provisional government of the Azores, until the new Portuguese Constitution established the Regional Government of the Azores. Between 26 August 1975 and 29 August 1976 Magalh√£es served as the president of the Junta Regional dos A√ßores (Azores Regional Junta).

History  The application was inspired by the open-source version of Big Brother, a network monitoring application, and maintains backward compatibility with it. Between 2002 and 2004 Henrik Storner wrote an open- source software add-on called bbgen toolkit, then in March 2005 a stand-alone version was released called Hobbit. Versions of this were released between 2005 and 2008, but since a prior user of the trademark \\"Hobbit\\" existed, the tool was finally renamed Xymon. In January 2012, Quest Software discontinued development of Big Brother.  Functionality  Xymon offers graphical monitoring, showing the status of various network services of each device, as well as a range of application and operating system metrics such as listing the number of mail messages queued after a defined level of downtime. The web- based graphical display uses a red/yellow/green condition icon for each host/test, on top of a colored background indicating the current worst status across all hosts and tests. The user can click on a colored icon to view more specific details and (where available) relevant graphs of metric statistics. Built-in reporting tools include SLA-type reports (availability) and the historical state of services (snapshots). Xymon supports the generation of alarms sent by email, and can also use external tools to send messages via other means (eg SMS). Networked hosts and devices are monitored by a Xymon server using network probes supporting a large and extensible range of protocols, including SMTP, HTTP/S and DNS. Hosts that use a supported operating system can also run a Xymon client (also free software), to additionally collect operating system and application monitoring metrics and report them to the Xymon server. Clients are available for Unix and Linux (in formats including source tarball, RPM and Debian package) from the Xymon download site at Sourceforge. Windows hosts can use the Big Brother client for Windows, the BBWin client or the WinPSClient written in the Windows PowerShell scripting language. Plugins extend monitoring to new types of applications and services, and many extension scripts for Big Brother will run unchanged on Xymon.

It was the first railway bridge built over the Rhine below Lake Constance. It is the only major railway bridge over the Rhine, which is completely preserved in its original condition and is one of Europe's few lattice truss bridges. The bridge carries passenger services of line S27 of the Aargau S-Bahn, operating between Baden and Waldshut, and line S41 of the Zurich S-Bahn, operating between Winterthur and Waldshut. History On 26 August 1857 the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways signed an agreement with the Swiss Northeastern Railway to construct the cross-border Turgi‚ÄìKoblenz‚ÄìWaldshut railway, including the Rhine bridge. Thus on 18 August 1859, the line was commissioned as the first connection between the Baden Mainline and the Swiss railway network. The current main rail connection between Germany and Switzerland, the Basel Link Line, was opened 14 years later. The Baden architect Robert Gerwig designed the bridge and managed its construction. The steel superstructure was supplied and installed by the Gebr√ºder Benckiser company of Pforzheim. The bridge was designed for two tracks, but only one track was installed. Due to increasing traffic loads, the bridge was strengthened in 1912 and 1913, being reinforced to carry axle loads and then the track was moved from the eastern side of the bridge to the middle. The demolition of the bridge planned by the German army on 24 April 1945 was not in fact carried out, so the technical landmark of the bridge in its original design is still preserved today. In 1967 a speed restriction of was imposed on the bridge because the bridge‚Äôs age and safety concerns. A report of the University of Karlsruhe in 1974 estimated the bridge‚Äôs remaining useful life as 10 to 15 years, provided that new corrosion protection was applied; this was carried out in 1978. Ten years later Deutsche Bundesbahn closed the line, after Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the owners of half the bridge, refused a request for an updated report on the bridge. This was followed in 1991 by extensive repair work, including local reinforcement measures and renewed anti-corrosion measures, allowing the maximum speed for passenger trains to be raised to and extending the bridge‚Äôs useful remaining life to 40 years. Until the electrification of the Waldshut‚ÄìKoblenz gap in 1999, passenger services on the bridge were carried out by diesel multiple units of Deutsche Bahn. From 1999, SBB took over management of services on the bridge using electric multiple units. In 2007, about 34 trains daily operated as line S41 of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn between Waldshut and Winterthur. In late 2011, the SBB introduced refurbished Class 560 electric multiple units to the S27 line. Unfortunately the refurbishment, which included the introduction of air conditioning, took the axle loading of a fully loaded power car over the maximum for the bridge. As a temporary solution, the power cars were locked out of use whilst passing over the bridge, and the trains limited to . Following work on the bridge, these restrictions were lifted in early 2014. Construction Bridge from below The c. bridge section has a track on the upper level of the truss bridge and its spans over the Rhine consist of two outer spans that are long and a central span of . This is followed on the Swiss bank by a brick viaduct with six semi-circular arches, having an inside diameter of . The greatly varying spans of the main bridge result from the nature of the currents in the Rhine. On the German side, after the line runs on an embankment for some , it crosses over the E54 on a modern concrete arch bridge. The superstructure of the lattice truss bridge is made of wrought iron and is box shaped in cross-section. At has a continuous beam along its length. It has two vertical close-knit, grid-like lattice truss with a height of and a track base of . The diagonal struts are formed from flat steel and riveted together at the intersections. The vertical pillars consist of four riveted corners. The foundation of the pillars are built on driven wooden piles that are about long, topped by concrete pile caps. The tops of the pillars are high and wide and made of stone masonry. =Assembly = The superstructure of the current bridge was assembled in three sections on the Waldshut bank in a temporary work hall. After completion of the first segment, it was rolled out of the hall. Then the second segment was built, and on its completion was connected with the first. Finally, the third segment was built and the entire length of was assembled. The actual installation of the bridge was carried with the support of piles in the Rhine, using of a wooden launching nose, propelled over a runway.

He is considered as one of the most versatile actors of his generation, and is best known for his work in Argentine comedy. Biography Lunadei was born in Rome in 1938. His mother was a seamstress and his father a brick mason, and the young Lunadei first developed an interest in acting when at age five, his parents introduced him to the cinema and theater. The family struggled during World War II, however, and his mother emigrated to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Gianni arrived in 1950, followed by his father shortly afterward. He debuted in the local theater in 1954 playing George in a local production of Arthur Miller's All My Sons, and was later cast in Se√°n O'Casey's The Shadow of a Gunman and Anton Chekhov's Platonov. His career on the stage flourished, and he worked as a resident actor in the National Comedy for eleven years, and in the General San Mart√≠n Theatre for six. Beyond the stage, he had a turn as Count Dracula in a 1968 made-for-television special starring veteran horror film actor Narciso Ib√°√±ez Menta. Among Lunadei's notable stage roles from this era include those in Peter Weiss' Marat/Sade, Carlo Goldoni's Servant of Two Masters, as well as the title role in Pantaleon, a commedia dell'arte work by Argentine playwright Villanueva Cosse. This latter role won Lunadei the city of Mar del Plata's \\"Star of the Sea\\" in 1975 with co-star China Zorilla. He earned a Moli√®re Prize for this role, and won a second one in 1977. He married actress Stella Maris Lanzani, and they had four children. Lunadei ventured into Argentine cinema in 1976 with a minor part in Carlos Galettini's tragedy Juan que re√≠a (Juan Who Once Laughed). He had a leading role in Manuel Antin's All√° lejos y hace tiempo (Long Ago and Far Away, 1978); but in subsequent years he became known for portraying manic characters in picaresque comedy films and on television. Lunadei explained in a 1984 interview that his childhood dream had been to be a clown. One notable exception was his role as the unscrupulous financier Arteche in Fernando Ayala's tragicomic Plata dulce (Sweet Money, 1982), whose title referred to the economic bubble and collapse caused by Jos√© Alfredo Mart√≠nez de Hoz's financial deregulation policies of the late 1970s. Lunadei was cast by comedy writer Juan Carlos Mesa in the sitcom Mesa de noticias (News Desk). The prime time show, which premiered on ATC in December 1983, was set in a struggling network news program, where Lunadei played De La Nata, an obsequious correspondent who showered the hapless programming director (Mesa) with compliments such as \\"benem√©rito se√±or director, le pertenezco\\" (\\"I'm at your disposal, my honorable director\\"), while sabotaging coworkers and dispensing ad hominem attacks such as \\"infeliz!\\" (\\"loser!\\"/\\"wretch!\\") and his trademark interjection: \\"SHAQ!\\" (typically with a chopping motion of the hand). The sitcom was a success and ran until New Year's Eve 1987, appealing to audiences of an unusually varied demographic. Lunadei returned to cinema in a 1987 lampoon of profiteering in the medical industry, La cl√≠nica del Doctor Cureta, and in a 1988 film adaptation of cartoonist Horacio Altuna'a Las Puertitas del se√±or L√≥pez. Lunadei earned a Konex Award for lifetime achievement in comedy in 1991. He then joined Mesa in a spin-off of Mesa de Noticias, El gordo y el flaco (akin to Laurel and Hardy), which aired from 1991 to 1994, and appeared in a number of sitcoms in subsequent years. However, Lunadei's often manic on-screen persona belied his struggle with clinical depression. Separated from his wife, he began a relationship with television actress Perla Caron in 1993, and in 1997 moved to her Belgrano home. He continued to work despite his worsening condition, and had memorable roles such as in the mystery mini-series Archivo negro (Black File), for which he was nominated for a Mart√≠n Fierro Award in 1997, and in the film-noir El inquietante caso de Jos√© Blum (The Troubling Case of Jos√© Blum). Alone in Perla Caron's home, he shot himself with a .32 caliber pistol on June 17, 1998. Lunadei was interred in the Actors' Pantheon at La Chacarita Cemetery. The respected stage, television and film actor was renowned in the local entertainment industry for his improvisational skills. A production company operated by Juan Carlos Mesa and others announced that a remake of Mesa de noticias was being considered; Mesa himself expressed that \\"bringing back a hit such as that inevitably leads to criticism that it's somehow not the same, and it wouldn't be the same: Gianni is no longer here\\".

The company is headquartered in Chiswick. Compass Box Whisky was founded in 2000 by American entrepreneur John Glaser, a former marketing director at Johnnie Walker. The company's whiskymakers select distillates from a number of existing Scotch whisky distilleries, with the selected whiskies then being blended together and the resulting blend matured further. Products Compass Box's main product line, called the Signature Range, consists of whiskies named 'The Spice Tree', 'The Peat Monster', 'Oak Cross', and 'Hedonism'. Outside the Signature Range, they produce a range of Blended Scotch whiskies called 'Great King Street', within which there are two products: 'Artist's Blend' (a rich, round, fruity blend) and 'Glasgow Blend' (a bold, smoky, sherried whisky made in the style historically favoured by Glaswegians). They have also released several Limited Edition releases, such as 'Hedonism Maximus', 'Flaming Heart', 'Optimism', 'Morpheus' and the Canto Cask series. Apart from whiskies, Compass Box also produces 'Orangerie', made from whisky infused with orange zest and spices. Contravention of Scotch Whisky Association regulations In 2005 Compass Box released a new Blended Malt Scotch Whisky called The Spice Tree in which the blend of single malt distillates had undergone a secondary partial maturation stage in casks containing additional, flat French oak inserts (also known as ‚Äòinner staves‚Äô). The Scotch Whisky Association, a trade organisation that represents the Scotch whisky industry, felt that the use of such inner staves in the whisky maturation process was in contravention of the Scotch Whisky Regulations prevailing at the time and threatened legal action against Compass Box to halt the production of The Spice Tree. In response, Compass Box altered the production process for subsequent releases of The Spice Tree wherein the secondary maturation stage takes place in casks containing toasted French oak heads instead of the flat oak inner staves. More recently, in 2015 Compass Box again disagreed with the Scotch Whisky Association when attempting to release complete information about every component whisky used in its blends, a step which the Scotch Whisky Association claimed was prohibited by both EU and UK laws. In response, Compass Box launched a 'Scotch Whisky Transparency' campaign to encourage greater transparency within the world of Scotch with other Scotch whisky producers ‚Äì notably Bruichladdich ‚Äì subsequently joined them in sharing full age component information about one or more of their blends.

From 1865 to 1896, farmer protests led to the formation of organized movements including the Grange, the Populist Party, the Greenbacks, and other alliances. Farmers cited the reasons for their unhappiness as declining prices, decreasing purchasing power, and monopolistic practices of: 1) moneylenders, 2) railroad corporations, and 3) other middlemen. Recent research has led scholars to question the validity of these explanations. Currently there is no scholarly consensus on the causes of agrarian discontent.  Uncertainty  A factor that contributed to the price volatility of farm products was related to supply-demand. Farm output increased as more people settled in the west. Part of this settlement can be attributed to: the influx of immigrants, the Homestead Act, and railroad construction. Productivity also increased with the advent of advances in agricultural machinery. Many prices for products such as cotton, wheat, and corn, fluctuated significantly as productivity increased. Some scholars point to price volatility during this period as a major cause of farmer discontent. There is evidence linking price volatility to protest within states. A major reason for price volatility was globalization; the development of other countries (Australia, Argentina, South Africa, Ukraine, Russia, and India) entering the market as major suppliers of agricultural products. If the United States were to have a bumper harvest, while Argentina or Eastern Europe had a poor harvest, then the commodity prices and incomes in the United States would rise. Similarly, if the United States had a poor year but Argentina had a good harvest, then the prices and incomes would fall in the United States. Transportation was the main concern for farmers during this time. The commercialization of agriculture was facilitated by railroad transportation. Farmers complained of the high freight rates, but the available evidence contradicts the rationale. Yet real transport costs fell steadily throughout the post bellum era, but there is some evidence that the farmers were not benefitting from the lower rates. Farmers in the west were shipping their produce farther distances to market than those farmers in the east, additionally, the ton-mile rates were often much higher west of Chicago than the rates from Chicago to New York City. The data indicate that mean prices and mean incomes per acre were linked to the distance from New York City. Farmers in high protest states faced high price variability due to the pattern of prices that was influenced by the railroad network that linked the states. Although, there is evidence that the drop in transportation costs caused farmers with suitable soils to diversify their crops in order to take advantage of relative farm gate prices. This volatility in prices was compounded by a post bellum shift into monocultures. Farmers that once relied on diversified farming found it profitable to produce only one crop for market sale. This was especially apparent in the South as farmers shifted away from diversified corn and cotton portfolios into solely cotton.  Commercialization  Commercialization was a main component behind agrarian unrest. During this time, farmers engaged in the market production as the relative profitability increased. The purchase of agricultural inputs and goods that were formerly home-produced was acquired with credit. Farmers had to sell their produce at market and subsequently were enveloped in the commercial market system. Thus, the farmer was forced into paying for transportation and credit in order to sell his produce at a high enough price so that he could pay for his inputs. The farmer also now had to judge himself by success of being a businessman and not just a farmer. It has also been noted that the farmers were upset at their depreciating status in society. While they were once a majority voice in the United States, they were now a minority due to the continued industrialization and urbanization of the nation.  Social movements  The unrest enabled many movements to appear on the political scene. The largest were the Grange, Greenback, and Populist movements. The Grange movement, which was organized in 1867, focused primarily on regulating railroads, grain elevators, and other middlemen and monopolies that they thought were taking advantage of the farmer. The most active states for the Grange movement were Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Greenback movement peaked in the late 1870s; it campaigned for: higher agricultural prices, against the gold standard, and for a general increase in prices. The states with the most Greenback activity, as a form of agrarian unrest, were Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Wisconsin. The Populist Party, which was formed in the 1890s, which were most active in Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas, was a short lived party that campaigned on the regulation of businesses, transportation charges, and monetary issues.

Tractatus politicus (TP) or Political Treatise is a political paper by Baruch Spinoza written in 1675‚Äì76 and published posthumously in 1677. This paper has the subtitle, \\"In quo demonstratur, quomodo Societas, ubi Imperium Monarchicum locum habet, sicut et ea, ubi Optimi imperant, debet institui, ne in Tyrannidem labatur, et ut Pax, Libertasque civium inviolata maneat.\\" (\\"In which how a society, may be monarchy or oligarchy, can be best government, and not to fall into tyranny, and peace and liberty of citizen must not violated is demonstrated\\"). Summary The Political Treatise has eleven Chapters: I. Introduction, II. Of Natural law (referring to his Theologico-Political Treatise), III. Of the Right of Supreme Authorities, IV. Of the Function of Supreme Authorities, V. Of best State of Dominion, VI. to VII. Of Monarchy, VIII. to X. Of Aristocracy, XI. Of Democracy. As in Aristotle's Politics, Spinoza analyzes each form of government: monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy without affirming which of these is the best. Unlike Aristotle, Spinoza argued on democracy at the last Chapter not as \\"rule of majority\\", but freedom for all by the natural law. Although he affirms that women are not equal to men in ability, and addresses the danger of Amazons, he suggests the commonwealth could possibly be governed by both sexes. This paper characterises the notion of peace in Chapter V, section 4; affirming that \\"Peace is not mere absence of war, but is a virtue that springs from force of character.\\" In the same Chapter, section 7 Niccol√≤ Machiavelli is referred to, stating the prince \\"should establish and maintain dominion but with what design can hardly be sure\\".

He has used magic to teach children about mathematics, performing under the name \\"Mathman\\", and has written books on mathematics, magic, teaching and music. He also co-wrote a book on reading cats' paws, which he says was a joke. Ken has also claimed in the past to being \\"University Science Trained\\", though Ring has never shown any qualifications to support that claim.  Predicting weather  Ring is known for attempting to predict weather and authors books on \\"how the moon affects the weather\\", which include an almanac each year for New Zealand (since 1999), Australia (since 2006) and Ireland (since 2010). He believes that the cycle of weather follows a lunar pattern and can be used to predict weather many years in advance. The supposed lunar cycle that Ring uses is stated to occur every 9 years, though no such lunar cycle actually exists in reality, while the solar cycle repeats at 11-year intervals and by assessing the two Ring believes that the weather recycles through a 355-day cycle, a 19-year cycle, and a 36-year cycle. According to his website it is not an exact science - it has been shown to not follow any scientific methodology. When questioned about the proven inaccuracies in his predictions, Ring has claimed that his rainfall predictions can be out by 24 hours and a radius of . His New Zealand almanac covers 64 towns. He also writes columns for farming and fishing publications and is an on-call weather reporter for Channel 7's Today Tonight show. He says he has provided forecasts for specific events including the Melbourne Cup, Ellerslie Flower Show and the Auckland Santa Parade. Ring speaks at various business and media events and has produced long range weather predictions for the Gisborne City Council through to 2020. He terms his predictions \\"alternative weather\\" and they are not supported by any current science. Author of the New Zealand Weather Book and MetService employee Erick Brenstrum, wrote a column in the New Zealand Geographic analysing his 2005 predictions. He compared two weather systems (the northwest winds that bring rain to the west coast and lows that bring rain to the east coast) and has stated that out of 40 occurrences only 1 matched with Ring's predictions. Ken replied accusing Brenstrum of bullying and insists he has proof of an 85 percent success rate, to which the editor responded with: \\"...once you publish a book, you're fair game for public scrutiny of its content and your own competence.\\" Retired schoolteacher and amateur astronomer Bill Keir believes Ring makes a genuine attempt at scientific discourse, but doesn't understand the science or changes it to fit with his own theories. Keir published articles in the Auckland Astronomical Society journal that examine and critique Ring's theories. Ring says that a former client and member of the All Blacks management approached him in 2007 for forecasts on days when the team was playing, reportedly to aid in team selections. Ian Ferguson, a former Olympian and now an events organiser says he consults with Ring before any big event and has never had to cancel. Ring uses similar methods (moons position and phase) to predict when fish will bite, publishing his predictions in the NZ Fishing World magazine. Ring denies global warming, stating that it is a \\"motivated power grab by politicians and the far left\\" and \\"full of bad science\\". During the launch of his 2008 almanac he said that \\"we have a responsibility to create global warming\\" as \\"life likes warmth\\".  Earthquake prediction  Ring predicts earthquakes based on the position of the moon. On his website he says that when the moon (in particular the new moon) is at perigee (closest to the earth) it may affect the Earth's mantle and alter the magnetic field. It may also draw the Van Allen Belt closer, attracting radioactively charged particles towards Earth. Ring believes this combination may be responsible for earthquakes and volcanoes. Ring has predicted 221 days of increased earthquake risk for New Zealand in 2011 and more than half of the time between the start of January and the end of March as earthquake risk. On his weekly Radio Waatea broadcast on 3 September 2010 he said \\"you‚Äôll be reading about floods and winds and earthquakes and snow over the next week or so, particularly the South Island\\". Early the next morning a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck Christchurch. On 7 September 2010 he wrote on his website that there would \\"probably be an east/west faultline event\\" in Marlborough or north Canterbury \\"just before noon\\" on 20 March 2011. The next day he wrote on Twitter, \\"The Christchurch earthquake was predictable. And there's another coming in 6 months.\\" He directed readers to his website to find out just when it would be. Another two days later in a Radio Live interview, he told Marcus Lush that \\"the next one\\" would be \\"round about lunchtime on the 20th of March\\" and that \\"the South Island is going to be right in the firing line\\". On 14 February 2011 Ring tweeted \\"Potential earthquake time for the planet between 15th‚Äì25th, especially 18th for Christchurch, +/- about 3 days.\\" A deadly 6.3 magnitude aftershock struck Christchurch on 22 February. Following the earthquakes Ring received a lot of media attention. John Campbell interviewed Ring on Campbell Live on 28 February and was criticised for being arrogant and not giving Ring a fair chance to speak. Campbell later apologised, but his interview may have unintentionally generated sympathy for Ring. Prior to 20 March 2011, Cabinet minister Nick Smith, who has a PhD in geotechnical engineering, said Ring's predictions were \\"reckless and irresponsible\\" and suggested that Ring should be \\"held to account for his predictions of a further earthquake in Christchurch\\". Smith added that \\"the last thing needed by thousands of traumatised people in Canterbury, including elderly and children, is junk science and made-up predictions of future major quakes.\\" Smith described Ring as \\"scaremongering\\" and attended a lunch on 20 March at the Sign of the Kiwi, close to the epicentre of 22 February earthquake, organised by the New Zealand Skeptics organisation. After the widespread death and destruction caused by the earlier earthquakes counsellors say his prediction for 20 March terrified \\"even the most rational\\" of people. 18 March had been made a special public holiday for Christchurch, and some residents left the city for the three-day weekend of 18‚Äì20 March, citing a mix of doubt and concern over the prediction, as well as wishing to have a break from the aftershocks and to take advantage of the long weekend. A 5.1 magnitude aftershock occurred at 9:47 pm (NZDT) on 20 March, and according to his supporters validated Ring's prediction. Scientists contend there is no link with Ring's predictions, and with a quake measuring 5 or higher occurring once every 11 days since 4 September, it was within the range expected in the ongoing aftershock pattern. David Winter, a PhD student in evolutionary genetics, analysed Ring's predictions and noted that the moon only explains a 2% variation in earthquake activity and wrote that cognitive and hindsight bias are possible reasons for so many people believing his predictions. New Zealand's TV3 news channel says they have not been able to \\"find a single scientist, geologist or seismologist which believes in Ken Ring's theories\\". Alison Campbell, a lecturer in science education at the University of Waikato, criticised Ring's predictions for \\"imprecision\\", \\"inconsistencies\\", and being \\"vaguely worded\\", and described Ring as \\"hedging his bets.\\" One such example of confirmation bias is a Ring prediction from 2011, which was reported in an article for local Wellington newspaper, the Upper Hutt Leader. On 14 November 2016, Kaikoura and Wellington city experienced a M7.8 earthquake. Ring was quoted in 2011 as saying \\"I do expect earthquake activity exceeding 7 on the Richter to come about every 11 to 13 years, as they have done in Wellington in February 1893, August 1904, August 1917, July 1929, August 1942, May 1968 and May 1992. As the last in the series of above-7s was in 1992 we can reasonably expect a 7 mag between 2013 and 2016,\\" allowing a full four-year window for an earthquake to occur, making the \\"prediction\\" useless.

The human eyes move rapidly and repeatedly, focusing on a single point for only a short period of time before moving to the next point. These rapid eye movements are called saccades. If a video camera were to perform such high speed changes in focal points, the image on screen would be a blurry, nauseating mess. Despite this rapidly changing input to the visual system, the normal experience is of a stable visual world; an example of perceptual constancy. Transsaccadic memory is a system that contributes to this stability. Transsaccadic memory is a relatively new topic of interest in the field of psychology. Conflicting views and theories have spurred several types of experiments intended to explain transsaccadic memory and the neural mechanisms involved. Theories =Saccade target theory= McConkie's and Currie's saccade target theoryCurrie C.B., McConkie G.W., Carlson-Radvansky L.A., Irwin D.E (2000), Perception & Psychophysics. 2000 May;62(4):673-83..The role of the saccade target object in the perception of a visually stable world. is similar to research by Schneider who came up with a similar \\"reference object theory\\".Deubel, H., Schneider, W. X., & Bridgeman, B. (2002). Transsaccadic Memory of Position and Form. Progress in Brain Research, 140, Chapter 11. Both theories hypothesize that each saccade is preceded by processes in the visual system that chose an object as the target for the next fixation point. The object is usually located in peripheral vision. The object's features are stored as a mental representation in transsaccadic memory for identification of future fixations. These target features are searched for by the visual system when the eye lands on its fixation point, and the physical features are compared to the mental representation of the target object. The theory assumes that visual stability is attained when these processes are successful (when the visual stimuli and the mental representation of the target object match). This process occurs before each saccade.McConkie, G. W., Carlson-Radvansky, L. A., & Irwin, D. E. (2000). The role of the saccade target object in the perception of a visually stable world . Perception and Psychophysics, 62(4), 673-683. Experiments performed by McConkie to support the role of a saccadic target in transsaccadic memory show two things: first, there is a limited peripheral area where a saccadic target exists, and second, attention is vital in recollection of items in the target area. The experiments involved recalling changes to an image that occurred in the peripheral area. Irwin performed similar experiments in which participants recalled letters that occurred near the target area. Due to confounding factors of the controlled environment in the studies, the involvement of saccade target objects is inferred and not established. =Spatiotopic fusion hypothesis= Many radical views of transsaccadic memory exist. Some are favoured more than others because of the evidence that supports them. One less-accepted theory, Breitmeyer's spatiotopic fusion hypothesis, suggested that successive images are fused based on environmental coordinates and not retinal ones. In other words, our memory stores a sequence of images from our surroundings, and joins the images together to give us a full representation in our brain. The orientation of our retinas do not have an influence on this form of memory. This theoretical form of memory supposedly stores highly detailed representations of the world in a high capacity spatial buffer. Research and experiments by other psychologists provide empirical evidence against these claims. =Dennett= Daniel Dennett argued that the way we think we are seeing the world is, for the most part, an illusion. Part of Dennett's argument is the claim that each of us possess what he calls a \\"Cartesian theater\\", in which we believe there is a full representation of the visual world in our mind and that there is a place in the mind where it is observed.Blackmore, S.J., Brelstaff, G., Nelson, K. and Troscianko, T. 1995 Is the richness of our visual world an illusion? Transsaccadic memory for complex scenes. Perception, 24, 1075-1081c According to Dennett, none of this exists. Instead, the only place where a full and rich representation exists is directly on the fovea, and every time a saccade occurs, the information is overwritten. Therefore, there is no such thing as transsaccadic memory. Information previously lost only appears to be retained in visual memory because we can look again. In this way, the outside world acts as a visual memory. Since our eyes are constantly moving, we are not aware that visual inputs are constantly being refreshed to give the illusion of the completed picture we think we are seeing. Dennett makes a distinction between the presence of representation, and the representation of presence. The example he gives regarding this distinction is this: if you were to walk into a room covered in identical portraits of Marilyn Monroe, you would see that there are many of them, but you would not really be seeing them all at once. There would be no detailed representation of each individual portrait just the knowledge that they are present. Dennet's theory raises two relevant questions: 1) How does the visual system detect change in the environment? 2) How much information is retained in each saccade? The proposed answer to these questions lies in several mechanisms that support a high sensitivity to change in each visual fixation. These mechanisms are: retinal adaptation, \\"pop-out\\" systems, and motion detectors. The implication of this view is that little information is needed to be retained between each saccade. =Irwin= Irwin's conclusion regarding transsaccadic memory is that there are no separate mechanisms, but that rather it is the same as short-term visual memory.Irwin, D. E. (1991). Information Integration across Saccadic Eye Movements . Cognitive Psychology, 23, 420-456. Irwin's experiments showed that people cannot fuse pre-saccadic and post-saccadic images in successive fixations. These results are evidence against spatiotopic fusion. According to Irwin, there is no transsaccadic buffer that holds visual information from one fixation point to the next. Also, transaccadic memory does not hold detailed spatial information, but a more abstract representation. Irwin describes transaccadic memory as an undetailed, limited capacity memory that is relatively long-lasting. Features =Visual short-term memory= Many statements have been made concerning the relationship between transsaccadic memory and visual short-term memory. Researchers have noted several similar characteristics between the two systems, leading several to believe that transsaccadic memory is in fact visual short-term memoryIrwin, D. E., Yantis, S., & Jonides, J. (1983). Evidence against visual integration across saccadic eye movements. Perception & Psychophysics, 34, 49-57. or a part of visual short-term memory.Irwin, D. E. (1992). Memory for position and identity across eye movements. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18, 307-317. Transsaccadic memory has a limited capacity of three to four items, a slow decay rate and maskable characteristics. Basically, transsaccadic memory can hold three to four items for each saccade, and the retention of items decays or disappears from consciousness slowly after the presentation of the stimulus. However, once a mask stimulus, such as a blank screen, is presented immediately after the stimulus, the items retained prior to the mask can be replaced and/or eliminated faster by the mask. All of these factors are typical characteristics of visual short-term memory. The content stored in transsaccadic memory are less-image like, more abstract and are sparse representations of the objects, which is found to be similar to the type of representations in visual short-term memory.Deubel, H., Schneider, W. X., & Bridgeman, B. (2002). Transsaccadic memory of position and form. Progress in Brain Research, 140, 165-180. Transsaccadic memory is different from visual short-term memory in that it takes into account the changes of the target's location due to the eye moving to new saccades.Prime, S. L., Tsotsos, L, Keith, G. P., & Crawford, J. D. (2007). Visual memory capacity in transsaccadic integration. Experimental Brain Research, 180, 609-628. The information retained between saccades do not take into account positional information very well.Irwin, D. E., & Gordon, R. D. (1998). Eye movements, attention, and trans-saccadic memory. Visual Cognition, 5, 127-155. Nevertheless, relationalCarlson-Radvansky, L. A. (1999). Memory for relational information across saccadic eye movements. Perception & Psychophysics, 61, 919-934. and identity information are well retained. Prime and colleagues (2006) hypothesize, transsaccadic memory utilizes egocentric mechanisms, like selective attention, to reduce the visual search of the target and allow for spatial information between saccades to be retained and updated by incorporation of information across saccades. =Attention= Transsaccadic memory is characterized by the integration of information gathered prior to the execution of a saccade (pre-saccadic) and information gathered after the saccade (post-saccadic stimuli. This involves attention, locating the targets necessary to perform a saccade and continuous updates of the environmental information. Attention occurs prior to the movement of the eyes, therefore it has a strong influence on the location of the saccade, what information is being encoded, remembered across saccades and stored into transsaccadic memory. In order to perform a successful and accurate saccade an individual is required to make an attentional shift to the saccadic target. This attentional shift causes the encoding of information to occur near the saccade target location. Attention to the target of the saccade results in better object identification and an increase in accuracy of identification. As well as, improvement in coding of locational information.Kowler, E., Anderson, E., Posher, B., & Blaser, E. (1995). The role of attention in the programming of saccades. Vision Research, 35(13), 1897‚Äì1916. Attention is restricted to one saccade target per area. It is impossible to keep attention on a target in one area, while performing another saccade simultaneously in another. This will cause prolonged saccadic latency periods (the time it takes to make a saccade from one area to another), and increased reaction times.Postsaccadic target blanking prevents saccadic suppression of image displacement. Vision Research, 36(7), 985-996. However, attention can be distributed around the saccade target, rather than the precise location that will fall on the fovea, allowing for the detection of one or two objects situated around the saccadic target. Kowler (1995) proposed two models to explain the relationship between attention, saccades and transsaccadic memory. The spatial model, states that attention is distributed among the perceptual site (visual field) and the saccadic target during the latency period, which allows for the identification of the saccadic target and object surrounding that area. The temporal model states that attention determines where the saccade will occur and releases a ‚Äúgo‚Äù signal to initiate a saccade within that area. =Space constancy= Saccadic suppression is responsible for maintaining a continuous, stable, visual world by reducing visual sensitivity to events occurring before, during and after a saccade.Matin, E. (1974). Saccadic suppression: a review and an analysis. American Psychological Association, 81(12), 899-917. The more complex the background on which the stimulus is presented, the larger the suppression. The increase in saccadic suppression can lead to a decrease in detection of change in the visual field.Bridgeman, B., Hendry, D., & Stark, L. (1975). Failure to detect displacement of the visual world during saccadic eye movements. Visual Research, 15, 719-722. Saccadic suppression can be linked to the phenomenon of change blindness, in which individuals lack the ability to detect small or large changes within an environment without the aid of directed attention.Rensink, R. A., O'Regan, J. K., & Clark, J. J. (1997). To see or not to see: the need for attention to perceive. Psychology Science, 8, 368-373. There are two types of saccadic suppression, with the first concerning the detection of light spot flashes during saccades. The lower the spatial frequency, meaning fewer objects in the visual field of the light flashes, the stronger the saccadic suppression. With fewer items in the visual field it is easier for saccadic suppression to occur. The higher the spatial frequency, which involves more complex objects within the visual field, the less likely there will be saccadic suppression.Wolf, W., Hauske, G., & Lupp, U. (1978). How presaccadic gratings modify postsaccadic modulation transfer function. Visual Research, 18, 1173-1179. The second type concerns the detection of image displacement or a change in an image during eye movement. A displacement between saccades would not be detected because the movement of the eye eliminates the signal for the detection of the displacement. The location of the target forms an image feature that is used by the visual system to establish space constancy, which maintains the location of an object in space. Target blanking is used to study visual stability, space constancy and the content of information transferred across saccades. Blanking a target after a saccade eliminates an attempt to make a second saccade, resulting in the visual system failing to find the target information. Stability and constancy across the saccades is broken, as a result, image displacements become easier to detect when blanking occurs during or right after the saccade. Neural structures =Superior colliculus= A neural structure located behind the lateral geniculate nucleus that is understood to control eye movements. In particular, the deeper layers of the superior colliculus, known as lamina VI and VII, have been found to be involved in initiating and executing saccadic eye movements, which includes the desired speed and direction of the saccade.Quessy, S, Quinet, J, & Freedman, G. (2010) The cells in these layers are organized in a way that forms a map of the visual field. They are organized according to what direction each cell moves the eye.Lee, C, Rohrer, W, & Sparks, D. (1988). Population coding of saccadic eye movements by neurons in the superior colliculus. Nature, 332(6162), 357-360. It has been found that activation of specific cells is directed by where objects in the environment are located in the visual field. Once a new object is detected, the cells that fire the strongest to stimuli within this specific area of the visual field will fire, causing the eyes to move and focus on this object. Although the superior colliculus may not be directly related to memory for objects across saccades, it is directly related to the control of saccades and selection of fixation targets.Song, J, Rafal, R, & McPeek, R. (2010). Neural substrates of target selection for reaching movements in superior colliculus. Journal of Vision, 10(7), 1082. =V4= This is an area within the visual cortex that has been found to play an important role in the target selection of saccades. In other words, this area is important for determining which objects our eyes shift to when they move.Ogawa, T, & Komatsu, H. (2004). Target selection in area v4 during a multidimensional visual search task. The Journal of Neuroscience, 24(28), 6371-6382. Studies have shown that there is a large amount of activation within the visual area V4 before the saccade even takes place. This occurs in the form of shrinking receptive fields. The receptive fields of these brain cells tend to shift towards the object that the eye is about to move towards, generally more so if the object is close to the original fixation point.David, S, Hayden, B, Mazer, J, & Gallant, J. (2008). Attention to stimulus features shifts spectral tuning of v4 neurons during natural vision. Neuron, 59(3), 509-521. This dynamic change in receptive fields is thought to enhance the perception and recognition of objects in a visual scene. Because the receptive fields become smaller around the targeted objects, attention within the visual scene is very focused on these objects. Increased attention to target objects within a visual scene help direct eye movements from one object to another. Understanding of the visual scene becomes more efficient because these attention shifts guide the eyes towards relevant objects as opposed to objects that may not be as important.Tolias, A, Moore, T, Smirnakis, S, Tehovnik, E, & Siiapas, A. (2001). Eye movements modulate visual receptive fields of v4 neurons. Neuron, 29(3), 757-767. =Lateral intraparietal cortex= The lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) is an area that is believed to be primarily responsible for keeping an image fluid and undistorted during a saccade (visual/spatial constancy). Past work has shown that the LIP stores information of objects before the saccade (presaccadic), which is then followed by a shift in the receptive fields of the brain cells of this area to compensate for the displacement of the retina during a saccade. This shift in the receptive fields occurs nearly 80 ms before the saccade. The LIP uses quantitative spatial information in order to achieve this shift, which allows for the perception of visual and spatial constancy. The receptive fields of the LIP are quite large and therefore are not well suited to hold details about the perceived objects in the scene during a saccade.Duhamel J, Colby C, Goldberg M. (1992). The updating of the representation of visual space in parietal cortex by intended eye movements. Science, 27, 227‚Äì240. This is why objects may seem somewhat blurry during eye movements. =Posterior parietal cortex= The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a cortical area that is located in front of the parieto-occipital sulcus and is known to play a role in spatial awareness for eye and arm movements. A study using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) found that the PPC also plays an important role in the amount of information held across saccades.Prime, S, Vesia, M, & Crawford, J. (2008). Transcranial magnetic stimulation over posterior parietal cortex disrupts transsaccadic memory of multiple objects. The Journal of Neuroscience, 28(27), 6938-6949. It is believed that transsaccadic memory has the ability to hold roughly three to four items across each saccade with a fully functional PPC. When the PPC is temporarily disrupted, especially the PPC of the right hemisphere, memory across saccades is significantly weakened. Disruption of the PPC leads to a reduction in the ability to store items from a span of three or four, to one item. Further research needs to be conducted in order to fully understand how the PPC is synthesized with object recognition within transsaccadic memory. Experiments =Random dot pattern= Irwin's early experiments tested participants ability to identify random dot patterns as the same, or as different across saccades. The control condition for this experiment presented dot patterns in the same spatial location without saccades, meaning participants had a single fixation point. A no-overlap control condition presented dot patterns in different spatial locations, while participants maintained fixation on one point. This tested the ability of visual short-term memory in identifying two individual patterns. The experimental condition showed dot patterns in the same spatial location but were viewed at separate fixations, forcing the use of transsaccadic memory. For the experimental condition, participants underwent a calibration phase, where they were shown five points in separate location to fixate on individually, for less than two seconds. The next phase presented a single fixation point for less than two seconds, which was followed by a random dot pattern presented in a different location, acting as a saccade target. The dot pattern disappeared when the saccade was initiated. Another dot pattern then appeared in the same location. Participants had to identify whether the two patterns were the same or different. Results of the experiment showed performance of the experimental condition to be slightly less accurate than the no-overlap condition. Irwin attributed this decrease in accuracy to the extra neural processes involved in performing an eye movement, combined with processing the dot pattern. He concluded from this that transsaccadic memory does exist, but that it is very similar if not identical to short term visual memory and less similar to sensory memory. =Saccade target experiment= The next step for Irwin was to determine if transsaccadic memory is tied to spatial position. He performed experiments using dot patterns and later, performed the same type of experiment alongside McConkie in his effort to prove the saccade target hypothesis. In those experiments, the researchers used a picture instead of dot patterns. Participants in the experimental condition were given an initial eye position, followed by a saccade target position on the picture. Unlike Irwin's first experiment, where the pattern did not change spatial location during the saccade, the picture underwent one of three shift conditions: All shift down, target object shift down, or background shift up. Detection of change ended up being much higher when only the target object moved compared to when the entire image shifted. This demonstrated the importance of the target object in detection of image displacements. =Drawing attention to an eccentric target= Kowler and colleagues were among many to test the relationship between attention and saccades. In one of their first experiments they hypothesized that the initiation of saccades required a signal that would determine which point in space would be the target for the saccade. They questioned whether the signal was attributed to attention or if saccades held their own independent filter. If attention was what decided the location of the target then the saccade latency period would be longer for saccades made away from the target. Additional time would be required to shift attention away from the false target to the correct target. The apparatus was constructed of eight letters arranged around the perimeter of a circle with a cross fixated at the center. Three frames were presented at each trial, the first called the pre-mask held eight letters for 500 ms, the second, labeled critical frame contained seven characters and a numerical (0-9) saccade target and was held for 200 ms. The last frame, post-mask, contained all of the letters. Each trial the identity of the letters, numerical saccade target and the location of the numerical saccade target were chosen at random and blind to the participants. Participants focused on the cross fixation and pressed a button at the start of the trial. After 100 ms a sequence of the three frames were presented, participants were then instructed to make a saccade to either the numerical saccade target or to an opposite character. Once the saccade target was identified participants pressed a button. Results supported the hypothesis, showing that directed attention towards the saccade target made the target easier to identify, decreased latency period and improved on accuracy. =Transsaccadic memory of multiple objects= Prime, Crawford and Vesia (2008) performed an experiment using a TMS in order to understand what structure or structures play a role in transsaccadic memory. It was found that transsaccadic memory was disrupted when TMS stimulation was delivered to the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) around the time of a saccade. Prime et al. hypothesized that TMS interfered with the normal spatial remapping operations of the rPPC, in particular the parietal eye fields, that occur during a saccade.

Census Place: Bay City Ward 8, Bay, Michigan; Roll: T623_701; Page: 26 AA; Enumeration District: 39. University of Michigan Portrait of Karpus as captain of Michigan's 1921 basketball team. Karpus enrolled at the University of Michigan where he played for the football, basketball and baseball teams. As a freshman in 1917, he played at the end position for Michigan's all-freshman football team. As a sophomore during the 1918-19 academic year, Karpus lettered in football, basketball, and baseball. He played at the end and halfback positions for the undefeated 1918 Michigan Wolverines football team that won the Big Ten Conference and national championships. He also played center for the 1919 basketball team. In February 1919, he made a basket in the second overtime period to give Michigan a 19-17 win over Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State). He also scored 13 of Michigan's points in a 38-20 win over Ohio State later that same month. He also played third base for the undefeated 1919 baseball team that won the Big Ten Conference championship.(1919 baseball team, Big Ten Champions) As a junior during the 1919-20 academic year, Karpus was academically ineligible to play football in the fall. However, he again lettered in basketball and baseball. Playing at the forward position, he played in eight games, scoring 22 baskets from the floor and 31 free throws for a total of 75 points. At the end of the 1920 basketball season, Karpus was elected captain of the 1921 basketball team. As a senior during the 1920-21 academic year, Karpus was once again declared academically ineligible in the fall. However, his eligibility was restored in December, allowing him to participate in most of the basketball season. Despite missing several games, Karpus, playing at the forward position, was the team's high scorer for the second straight year,1921 Michiganensian, p. 334 (\\"CAPTAIN KARPUS Combined a rare floor ability with a knack to shoot baskets, both from the field and from the foul line. The high scorer for 1921.\\"). and he led the team from a last place finish the prior year to a three-way tie for the Big Ten Conference basketball championship.1921 Michiganensian, p. 333. The 1921 basketball team compiled a record of 16-4 and won both games against Michigan Agricultural for the first time in the history of the rivalry.1921 Michiganensian, p. 335. In a summary of the 1921 basketball season, the University of Michigan yearbook praised Karpus' contributions: > In any consideration of the players on the 1921 Varsity, Captain Joe Karpus > leads, because of his high scoring ability, and the spirit which he put into > the team.

The 1921 Michiganensian noted of Karpus: \\"When a hit was needed in a pinch, Coach Fisher could usually count on Joe who handled third base in a remarkable fashion. It was Karpus' third year on the Varsity.\\"1922 Michiganensian, p. 231. Minor league baseball After graduating from Michigan, Karpus played minor league baseball in the Michigan‚ÄìOntario League for the Bay City Wolves in 1921, the Saginaw Aces in 1922 and the Kalamazoo Celery Pickers in 1923. He maintained a .326 batting average and a .439 slugging percentage in 37 games for the 1921 Bay City team.

He was elected President-General of the Nyasaland African Congress in 1945, after the death of Levi Zililo Mumba. In 1950 he was thrown out of office. Later he formed a pro-government party. After Malawi achieved independence in 1963 he was forced into exile. Background Charles Matinga had a long career in the civil service, based in Blantyre, and ran a brick-making business on the side. He was a member of the Free Church of Scotland Mission and an active member of the Blantyre Native Association. In a 1943 speech, Matinga praised the earlier missionaries who had come to the country before 1914 and worked to help Africans advance, but said that later arrivals had brought racist ideas and prejudices and had failed to promote African interests. He also strongly criticised the administration for failing to meet African demands for advancement. However, he continued to believe in working within the system to improve it rather than in rebellion against the system. NAC leader Africans had been represented in the Protectorate of Nyasaland by the Native Administration of chiefs and headmen, and by local Native Associations. The Nyasaland African Congress (NAC), formed in 1943/1944 was the first organization that attempted to work at a national level. Charles Matinga was elected first Vice-President of the Congress at the first general meeting in October 1944, with Levi Mumba being elected President-General. Charles Wesley Mlanga, editor of the Blantyre newspaper Zo-Ona, was elected Secretary General and James Dixon Phiri, a clerk in the Public Works Department, was elected assistant secretary-general. When Mumba died in January 1945, Matinga was elected to succeed him as President, with the Reverend Charles Chinula as Vice-President. Matinga surprised the government by raising the issue of land grievances, and demanding African majority representation on the Legislative Council and other administrative bodies. Dr. Hastings Banda, who had a practice in London at the time, was a supporter of Congress. Banda wrote to Matinga in March 1945 saying that he would support the Congress in England by giving lectures and talking to influential people whom he knew such as Sir Arthur Creech Jones and Rita Hinden. He asked that Matinga keep him informed of events in Nyasaland so they could work together to the common goal. However, according to Banda, Matinga was determined to go his own way and even refused an offer by Banda to pay for a permanent organizer for the Congress. Possible Matinga saw Banda as a potential rival. In the 1930s the concept of a Federation of the colonies of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland had been proposed, and the idea gained increased support in the 1940s among the colonial administrators. This was seen as a betrayal by NAC leaders such as Matinga and James Frederick Sangala, who thought the Colonial Office was discarding the principle that African interests were paramount, instead favoring White colonists. After federation was discussed in more detail at the second Victoria Falls conference in 1949, Matinga wrote Banda in London asking for support in fighting federalism. The NAC decided to send a delegation to London to meet the Colonial Secretary and discuss provisions for educating Africans in Nyasaland, and by May 1947 had raised enough funds to send two members, Matinga and the Vice-President Charles Chinula. In London they would be joined by Hastings Banda. In November 1947 they were told that the Secretary of State would receive them. Matinga left for Cape Town to take the ship to the United Kingdom, but took the Secretary General of Congress, Andrew Mponda, rather than Chinula. The party met with Arthur Creech Jones, now the Labour Party's Secretary of State, and gained agreement on the importance of secondary education. This led to establishment of a new secondary school at Dedza in 1951. It was also agreed to establish a teachers training college as Domasi. Matinga's action in taking his prot√©g√© Mponda with him rather than Chinula caused widespread anger among the NAC members, compounded by accusations that Matinga had misused NAC funds on the trip, and by Matinga's failure to attend NAC meetings and report on the trip after he had returned. Sangala managed to prevent police action regarding the funds. But Matinga did not report to Congress until the spring of 1949, and then gave only a verbal summary. When the delegates asked for a full written report, Matinga walked out. The NAC was no longer an effective organization. Under pressure from Congress delegates, Sangala (who had been one of the original prime movers in organizing the NAC), called a conference on 1 January 1950. Matinga surprised everyone by attending and chairing the first session of the meeting. However, the meeting resolved to dismiss him for abuse of funds. Sangala was forced into desperate efforts to recreate the Congress, arranging a session in August 1950 at which he was elected Vice President and James Chinyama became President. Later career The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland became a reality in 1953, against strong opposition from NAC members, some of whom were arrested. Charles Matinga, Andrew Mponda and Orton Ching'oli Chirwa formed the Nyasaland Progressive Association, dedicated to working within the new reality of the federation. Matinga became a Federal Member of Parliament. In 1957 and early 1958 the Governor of Nyasaland, Sir Robert Armitage, was attempting to formulate a view of how to evolve the government of the protectorate which he could present to the Colonial Office when he went on leave to London. In September he met with T.D.T. Banda and other NAC leaders who were pushing for an elected legislative council composed primarily of Africans. He met Charles Matinga's Progressive Party on 20 February 1958, and sensed that they did not feel Africans were ready to run the government, but wanted nominated representatives to work with the government. He summarised the views of Matinga's party as: \\"In other words they wanted a lot of friendly Africans and Europeans to collaborate with friendly officials. But, of course, politics cannot be this easily organized\\". In July 1962, along with J. R. N. Chinyama and Pemba Ndovi, Matinga formed the Convention African National Union (CANU), a rival party to the dominant Malawi Congress Party. CANU called for an end to \\"one man, one party, one leader in Nyasaland\\" . After independence in 1963, people felt bitterly about men such as Matinga who they felt were traitors for having supported the colonial rulers during the struggle for independence. Matinga left Nyasaland and settled in Southern Rhodesia. In 1973, the exiled \\"Capricorns\\" who had sided with white-led pro-federation parties - Matinga, Matthews Phiri and Manoah Chirwa - asked President Hastings Banda to be allowed to return to Malawi. Banda asked delegates at the annual MCP convention what they thought about the request.

Opsvik's furniture can be found under the brand names: Rybo (Garden), Nomi High Chair, H√•g (Capisco, H04, H05, Conventio Wing), Varier (different Balans¬Æ chairs), Stokke (Tripp Trapp) Naturellement (Reflex), Cylindra (Furniture objects) and Moment (Globe). His book Rethinking Sitting came out in 2009 giving insight into his thinking about sitting and explaining the philosophy behind his chairs. Peter Opsvik is also a jazz musician. He has been a member of Christiania Jazz band from 1972 and the band Christiania 12 from 1993. Philosophy Peter Opsvik has worked from both ends of the spectrum of Scandinavian Design. At one end, rational and ergonomic aspects are in focus ‚Äì taking care of the human body's requirements, while at the other end of the spectrum the most important criterion is expression. With the rational, ergonomic products, Opsvik's goal is to move the human body. With the other group of products, which he call \\"objects\\", his aim is to move the emotions. Peter Opsvik has attempted to overcome stereotypical sitting habits with his unconventional seating solutions. In the 1970s many experts on ergonomics attempted to establish one correct sitting posture. Peter Opsvik's contribution has been to create products that inspire variation between many different postures while using the same chair. Opsvik questioned the notion of body support as a necessity for comfortable sitting by asking if freedom can be as important as support; freedom to move and find alternative sitting postures. Creating sitting solutions that inspire movement and variations of posture can be seen as a key factor in his work. He uses different concepts to achieve dynamic sitting. Common to them all is the fact that being in balance inspires movement as well as control. According to Opsvik the feet are the ignored extremities of ergonomics. As our feet and legs have the responsibility for moving us in all situations it seemed natural for Opsvik to make sure that the chair respond to and is controlled by the feet. Essential concepts His probably best known work is the adjustable Tripp Trapp (1972) chair for children, the first chair that \\"grows\\" with the child from toddler to teenager. It is manufactured by the company Stokke and has sold in more than seven million copies. In 2013, together with Evomove.com, he launched the new and award-winning Nomi high chair concept which was the result of more than 40 years of experience, driven by his \\"always innovate and improve attitude\\" resulting in what is described by consumers and test panels as the world's best high chair. On his 75th birthday (25 March 2014) it was announced that Nomi high chair had won the Red Dot awards \\"grand prix\\" - the \\"Red Dot - Best of best\\", and since then numerous of other awards and highchair tests around the world. The saddle chair H√•g Capisco was launched in the 1980s and inspired by the horseback rider's dynamic posture. The goal, however, was to create a sitting device or work chair that would invite the user to assume the greatest number of sitting postures possible. In 2010 this design classic was made accessible for a wider audience when the Capisco Puls was launched. A balancing tilt is highly advantageous since the user automatically controls the tilting movements of the chair without having to think about it. The user can concentrate on his/her activities and does not have to bother with mechanical regulation of the chair. The chair follows the natural inclinations of the body and automatically stabilises at the body's selected sitting angles or at the angles that are required by the work task being done. The simplest way of verifying this is to try out one of his chairs in front of a work table during a normal working day. The chair tilts forward when the user want to be active at the table and tilts backwards if the user wants to relax or talk on the telephone. Often such variations occur many times per minute. Hans Chr. Mengshoel initiated the concept of kneeling chair posture in Norway, and Peter Opsvik was one of three designers who developed chairs based on this principle that all had Balans in their names. The others were Oddvin Rykken, and prof. Svein Gusrud. Peter Opsvik's kneeling chairs were originally manufactured by Stokke (now Varier), H√•g and Rybo. With its iconic shape this chair has been voted one of 50 designs that changed the world. As the name Variable indicates, it was of primary importance for Opsvik that the kneeling posture should be one of many different sitting postures. Product examples are Variable Balans, Gravity Balans, Thatsit Balans, and Wing Balans. Awards Peter Opsvik has been awarded a number of prizes for his work, most recently the European Commissions \\"Product Safety Award 2019\\"https://ec.europa.eu/product-safety-award/meet_the_winners_en.htm for Nomi Highchair. Red Dot Award 2013 \\"Best of Best\\" for Nomi High chair, Red Dot award 2011 (for Capisco Puls), the IF Product Design gold award 2011 (for Capisco Puls) and the Norwegian Design of Excellence award 2011. Opsvik was awarded The classic award for design excellence in Norway for the chairs Tripp Trapp in 1996 and H√•g Capisco. In 2008 he was awarded Anders Jahre's cultural award and the Nordic Design Award (Nordiska Designpriset). Opsvik has also received Torsten & Wanjas S√∂derbergs design award in Sweden for his pioneering, movable and variable furniture. In 2013 Norsk Form (The Foundation for Design and Architecture in Norway) awarded Opsvik Jacob-prisen for 2012. Exhibitions Peter Opsvik's furniture-objects have been exhibited around the world.

The school draws from an area of the village of Oxford and Oxford Township, as well as portions of Orion, Dryden, Metamora and Addison townships. History The present site, previously a middle school campus, opened in 2004. When renovations were completed, the middle school and high school swapped buildings, with the middle school now located in the old high school building on Lakeville Road. Since 2004, the high school has added over 500 students to its enrollment.

The school's primary mascot is the Wildcat. Both the high school and the middle school have teams which are referred to as the \\"Oxford Wildcats\\". Oxford's chief rival is Lake Orion, located directly in the township to the south, and connected by M-24. In American football, the two teams compete for the \\"Double-O\\" (Oxford/Orion) rivalry trophy. They had competed annually from at least 1950 until 1983, when Oxford moved to the Flint Metro League (FML). During FML play, Oxford's chief rivals were Lapeer East High School and Lapeer West High School, located in Lapeer approximately 15 miles north of Oxford on M-24. Before the 2010-2011 year, Oxford High School moved from the FML, where it had been a member school since 1983, to the Oakland Activities Association. Reasons for the move included demographic and geographic considerations. Urban sprawl in Metro Detroit over the years had brought Oxford in from the rural‚Äìurban fringe and closer in-line with the greater Detroit area like much of the OAA, rather than the Flint area. As a result of the move, the sports rivalry with Lake Orion resumed after 27 years. Oxford has won state championships in boys' track (1991 class B), football (1992 class BB) and wrestling (2011 class A).http://www.oxfordleader.com/Articles-i-2011-04-20-241114.113121-sub- Officials-praise-wrestlers-pass-resolution-for-state-champions.html  Oxford has won several state championships with its equestrian team, in 1980 (division B), 2008 (division C), 2012 (division A), 2016 (division B) and 2017 (division A).http://www.miha.org/past-state- champions/http://oxfordleader.com/?s=oxford+equestrian+team+championship In 2011, Oxford athletics installed artificial turf for the football stadium at a cost of $400,000, which was to be paid for with private donations. Initially, the turf was to be paid for with public bonds, but the millage failed to pass voters. The AstroTurf made headlines when it was revealed that several athletics boosters had put their personal homes up as collateral for the purchase of the field.http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/19255534/oxford- football-supporters-could-lose-homes-over-blue-turf When initial fundraising efforts came up short, the boosters were left with a $300,000 balance and were in danger of defaulting. An agreement was reached between the boosters and AstroTurf that allowed for an extended payback period. The turf also made headlines when Boise State University notified Oxford that they held a trademark on the term \\"Blue Turf\\" for their field at Albertsons Stadium. Therefore, Oxford could not continue calling their field \\"blue turf\\" but could use the terms \\"navy turf\\", \\"Oxford blue turf\\" or \\"true blue turf\\".

The building is the main office of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine as well as the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine. It is located at 11 Bankova vulytsia and was initially a reconstruction of the Kyiv Military District headquarters that was built sometime in the 1870s by Oleksandr Shile's design. The building is considered the peak of an architectural artistic work and was built after all government institutions of the Ukrainian SSR were transferred to Kyiv from Kharkiv. History The building was built in 1936-39 by the design of the Kharkiv architect Serhiy Grigoriev for the headquarters of the Kyiv Special Military District. The author of the design was able organically unite elements of a classical style and Ukrainian Baroque. First that may strike visitors it is the unbelievable thickness of building's walls. Specialists explain that it was due to restrictions to build administrative buildings in the Soviet Union of the 1930s which forced to dodge it by building a new structure on the already existing foundation. The new design made a great use of the symmetric campuses of the previous Shile's design of the 1870s. The new building was considered a reconstruction with some new elements. Its wings were extended, while in the center was formed a special composition - massive risalit with an inserted colonnade of the great Corinthian order. The governing monumentality of the building is underlined by a heavy entablature along with a glazed stylobate of a polished grey tint labradorite (\\"under coat\\"). The front entrance of the building is flanked by four rock spheres. The architect planned the design to such extent considering all the details that the big building regardless of being located on a narrow street not only did not squashed its surroundings, but also is well observed from all points: from the Instytutska and Lutheranska vulytsi, from the neighboring Franko Square and the remotely located Mykhailiv Square.

It was established in 1871 by the Methodist Episcopal Church as Mengxueguan ËíôÂ≠¶È¶Ü (School of Rudimentary Knowledge). In 1882, Huaili Shuyuan ÊÄÄÁêÜ‰π¶Èô¢ (Reason-Nurturing Academy) spun off with the newly added middle- and high-school divisions. In 1882, the Academy was renamed as Huiwen Academy Ê±áÊñá‰π¶Èô¢. During the Boxer Rebellion, it was burned down, then rebuilt again in 1902 with the support from local church. In 1904, it again renamed as Huiwen Daxuetang Ê±áÊñáÂ§ßÂ≠¶Â†Ç (Huiwen College). During the early Republican era, the college section of Huiwen College merged with Yenching University in 1918, located on campus of present-day Peking University, whereas the preparatory and high school divisions remained intact under the new title of Huiwen Xuexiao Ê±áÊñáÂ≠¶Ê†° (Huiwen Academy). Dr. Cai Yuanpei wrote the inscription and school motto \\"Zhi Ren Yong\\" on behalf of the Academy. Students of the high school sector played a significant role during May Fourth Movement, seen holding the school banner at a mass rally in a footage shot during that time. In 1927, Huiwen Academy registered with the Ministry of Education of the Nanjing Government, and reformed into Jingshi Sili Huiwen Zhongxue ‰∫¨Â∏àÁßÅÁ´ãÊ±áÊñá‰∏≠Â≠¶ (Beijing Private Huiwen Middle School). Soon after Pacific War broke out in December 1941, Huiwen was taken over by the puppet Beijing government as Beijing No. 9 Middle School. In August 1945, Huiwen resumed its name as Beijing Private Huiwen Middle School, with Gao Fengshan È´òÂá§Â±± as Principal. During the communist era, Huiwen became a public school under the supervision of the Education Bureau of Beijing in 1952, and gained a new name as Beijing No. 26 Middle School. It was relocated into its current address in 1959 due to the construction of Beijing railway station. In 1989, the school regained its historic title as Beijing Huiwen Middle School permitted by the local government and became one of Beijing's first batch of beacon high schools in 2001.

The technique was pioneered by Don R. Swanson in the 1980s and has since seen widespread use. Literature-based discovery does not generate new knowledge through laboratory experiments, as is customary for empirical sciences. Instead it seeks to connect existing knowledge from empirical results by bringing to light relationships that are implicated and \\"neglected\\". It is marked by empiricism and rationalism in concert or consilience. Swanson linking Swanson linking example diagram Swanson linking is a term proposed in 2003Stegmann J, Grohmann G.

For example, it may be known that illness A is caused by chemical B, and that drug C is known to reduce the amount of chemical B in the body. However, because the respective articles were published separately from one another (called \\"disjoint data\\"), the relationship between illness A and drug C may be unknown.

It lasted from November 1942 to September 1943.Rodogno, Davide. Il nuovo ordine mediterraneo - Le politiche di occupazione dell'Italia fascista in Europa (1940-1943) Chapter: France History After an initial period of increasing control over Corsica, since the first months of spring 1943 the Italian forces started losing territorial control to the local Resistance, and in the aftermath of the Italian capitulation to the Allies various units took different sides in the battle between newly landed German troops on one hand, and resistance fighters and Free French Forces on the other. =Occupation= On 8 November 1942, the Allies landed in North Africa. In response, Nazi Germany formulated Operation Anton, as part of which Italy occupied the island of Corsica on November 11 (Italian operation codename: \\"Operazione C2\\"), and some parts of France up to the Rhone. The Italian occupation of Corsica had been strongly promoted by Italian irredentism during Italy's Fascist period. The occupation force initially included 30,000 Italian troops and gradually reached the size of nearly 85,000 soldiers. This was a huge occupation force relative to the size of the local population of 220,000. The VII Army Corps of the Regio Esercito was able to occupy Corsica, which was still under the formal sovereignty of Vichy France, without a fight. Because of the initial lack of perceived partisan resistance and to avoid problems with Marshal Philippe P√©tain, no Corsican units were formed under Italian control (except for a labour battalion in March 1943). The Corsican population initially showed some support for the Italians, partly as a consequence of irredentist propaganda. The Italian troops grew to encompass two Army Divisions (the \\"Friuli\\" and the \\"Cremona\\"), two coastal Divisions (the Italian 225 Coastal Division and the Italian 226 Coastal Division), eight battalions of Fascist Militia, and some units of Military Police and Carabinieri. The Italian troops were commanded by General Mondino until the end of December 1942, then by General Carboni until March 1943 and later by General Magli until September 1943. =Collaboration= In Corsica, the native collaborationists linked to the irredentism supported the Italian occupation,Italian irredentists of Corsica stressing that this was a precautionary measure against a possible Anglo-American attack. Also, some Corsican military officers collaborated with Italy, including the retired Major Pantalacci (and his son Antonio), Colonel Mondielli and Colonel Simon Petru Cristofini (and his wife, the first Corsican female journalist Marta Renucci).Vita e Tragedia dell'Irredentismo Corso, Rivista Storia Verit√† Cristofini, who even met Benito Mussolini in Rome, was a strong supporter of the union of Corsica with Italy and defended irredentist ideals. Indeed, Cristofini actively collaborated with the Italian forces in Corsica during the first months of 1943 and (as head of the Ajaccio troops) helped the Italian Army to repress the Resistance in Corsica before the Italian Armistice in September 1943. He closely worked with the famous Corsican writer Petru Giovacchini, who was named as the potential \\"Governor of Corsica\\" had the Kingdom of Italy annexed the island. In the first months of 1943 these irredentists, under the leadership of Petru Giovacchini and Bertino Poli, conducted large-scale propaganda efforts among the Corsican population to promote the unification of Corsica to Italy with a \\"Corsica Governorate\\", as had been done in 1941 with Dalmatia (where Mussolini created the Governatorate of Dalmatia). Indeed, there was a mild support of the Italian occupation from most of the Corsican population until summer 1943. The Italian occupation of Corsica was related to the Nazi Germany dominion of Europe over which Adolf Hitler ultimately exercised control: Benito Mussolini thus postponed the unification of Corsica to Italy until a \\"Peace Treaty\\" could be done after the hypothetical Axis victory in World War II, mainly because of German opposition to the irredentist claims. Marco Cuzzi: La rivendicazione fascista della Corsica (1938-1943) p. 57 (in Italian) =Administration= Social and economic life in Corsica was administered by the original French civil authorities: the pr√©fet and four sous-pr√©fets in Ajaccio, Bastia, Sartene and Corte.Rodogno Davide: Italian occupation of Corsica p. 218 This helped to maintain calm on the island during the first months of Italian occupation. On 14 November 1943, the pr√©fet restated French sovereignty over the island and stated that the Italian troops had been occupiers. =Rise of the Resistance= The French Resistance was initially limited, but it started taking shape immediately in the aftermath of the Italian invasion. This initially led to the development of two movements: * A network operating under the codename mission secr√®te Pearl Harbour (secret mission Pearl Harbor), which arrived from Algiers on 14 December 1942 aboard the Free French submarine Casabianca, the elusive \\"Phantom Submarine\\". Under the chief of the mission Roger de Saule, they coordinated various groups that merged in the Front national. Communists were most influential in this movement. * The R2 Corse network was originally formed in connection with the London-based forces immediately under Charles de Gaulle in January 1943. Its leader Fred Scamaroni failed to unite the movements and was subsequently captured and tortured, committing suicide on 19 March 1943. In April 1943 Paulin Colonna d'Istria was sent by Charles de Gaulle from Algeria and united the movements. By early 1943, the Resistance was organized enough that it requested arms deliveries. The Resistance leadership was reinforced and the movement's morale was boosted by six visits by Casabianca carrying personnel and arms, and it was later further armed by Allied airdrops. This allowed the Resistance to increase its activities and establish greater territorial control, especially over the countryside in summer 1943. In June and July 1943 the OVRA (Italian fascist police) and the fascist Black Shirts paramilitary groups started a large-scale repression. According to General Fernand Gambiez, 860 Corsicans were jailed and deported to Italy.G√©n√©ral Gambiez. Liberation de la Corse. Hachette, Paris 1973, p. 128. On 30 August, Jean Nicoli and two French partisans of the Front national were shot in Bastia by order of an Italian Fascist War Tribunal. =Liberation of Corsica (Operation Vesuvius)= Following the imprisonment of Benito Mussolini in July 1943, 12,000 German troops came to Corsica. They formally took over the occupation on 9 September 1943, the day after the armistice between Italy and the Allies. While their leaders were ambivalent, most of the Italian troops remained loyal to the Italian King Victor Emmanuel III and some fought (mainly at Teghime, Bastia, and Casamozza) alongside the French Resistance against the German troops until the liberation of Corsica on 4 October 1943. Meanwhile, the Resistance aimed to establish control of the mountains in the island's center to prevent the occupying forces from moving from one coast to the other and thus facilitating the Allied invasion. The liberation of Corsica began with an uprising ordered by the local Resistance on 9 September 1943. The Allies did not initially want such a movement, preferring to focus their forces on the invasion of Italy. However, in light of the insurrection, the Allies acquiesced to Free French troops landing on Corsica, starting with an elite detachment of the reconstituted French I Corps landing (again by the submarine Casabianca) at Arone near the village of Piana in northwest Corsica. This prompted the German troops to attack Italian troops in Corsica as well as the Resistance. The Resistance, and the Italian 44 Infantry Division Cremona and 20 Infantry Division Friuli engaged in heavy combat with the German Sturmbrigade Reichsf√ºhrer SS. The Sturmbrigade was joined by the 90th Panzergrenadier Division and the Italian 12th Parachute Battalion of the 184th Parachute Regiment, which were retreating from Sardinia through Corsica, from Bonifacio to the northern port of Bastia. There were now 30,000 German troops in Corsica withdrawing via Bastia. On 13 September elements of the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division landed in Ajaccio to try to stop the Germans. During the night of 3 to 4 October, the last German units evacuated Bastia, leaving behind 700 dead and 350 POWs. =Punishment of collaborators= After the war, nearly 100 collaborators or autonomists (including intellectuals) were put on trial by the French authorities in 1946. Among those found guilty, eight were sentenced to death. However, only one irredentist was ever executed: Petru Cristofini, who had been put on trial after the Allied liberation for treason and sentenced to death. He tried to kill himself, and was executed while he was dying in November 1943.Il Martirio di un irredento: il colonnello Petru Simone Cristofini. Rivista Storia Verit√† Petru Giovacchini was forced to hide after the Free French and Allied invasion retaking the island. Prosecuted by a French tribunal in Corsica, he received a death sentence in 1945 and went into exile in Canterano, near Rome. He died on September 1955 from old combat wounds. Since his death, the Italian irredentist movement in Corsica is considered to be finished.

History The single track railroad line to Pueblo, Colorado was completed by the Santa Fe Railway in 1876. Although the track existed, the depot wasn't built until 1913. The station first opened with both freight and passenger services. The depot was finally closed by the railroad in 1973. The station remained vacant until, in 1976, it was donated to the city of Manzanola. In 1991, a senior center opened in the former waiting room area. Restoration Most of the building has been in a steady decline since the donation to the town in 1976. Until 2007, the only part of the station in use was the east side, with a small senior center.

Nick.com. = The Legend of Korra comic series = In Turf Wars part one, Korra and Asami spend time in the Spirit World exploring their romantic feelings for each other. The pair travel to the Southern Water Tribe to reveal their relationship to Korra's parents. Upon returning to Republic City, Korra attempts to stop tycoon Wongyong Keum's plans to form an amusement park on the land surrounding the Spirit Portal, which has angered the spirits. Korra also tries to reassure and help the people whose homes were destroyed during Kuvira's assault. Korra helps the Air Nomads when the Triple Threat triad, on Keum's orders, attempt to drive them away from the Spirit Portal. Korra tries to convince the spirits to stay out of the battle, but is distracted when Asami is nearly killed in the fighting, allowing the dragon-eel spirit to attack the Triple Threat's new leader, Tokuga. Three weeks after Tokuga was defeated, Korra confessed to Asami that she is in love with her, to which Asami said she feels the same way. In The Legend of Korra: Ruins of the Empire, it's revealed that after Kuvira's defeat, not everyone has surrendered. Korra, Asami, Mako, Bolin and Prince Wu conduct a plan to stop a new war. The leader of the rebels, reveals he wants to take over politically. Due to the Eath Kingdom now having elections.

She also helps build a machine to reverse the brainwashing with her ex-fianc√© Bataar Jr. Korra is devastated to fight her friends, due to them being brainwashed. They retrieve Asami, but Korra gets saddend after Asmai says (brainwashed) that she never loved Korra, and a lot of other things. They get Asami back, but she doesn't remember anything from her time being brainwashed. They defeat the rest of the Earth Empire with Kuvira's help, and get everyone who was brainwashed back. = Appearances in other media = Korra is featured in The Legend of Korra video game, which takes place in between the second and third seasons of the series. She has her bending abilities taken away from her at the beginning of the game and she has to regain them as it progresses. She is the only The Legend of Korra character, besides Naga and Jinora, to make an appearance in the game's story mode, which earned it criticism. In March 2015, Bryan Konietzko posted artwork of Korra and Asami embracing, entitled Turtle-duck Date Night. The art was announced to be sold as an exclusive print for The Legend of Korra / Avatar: The Last Airbender Tribute Exhibition at Gallery Nucleus with its proceeds donated by Konietzko to a LGBTQ suicide prevention hotline. After same-sex marriage was declared legal in all 50 states of the U.S., Konietzko posted a rainbow version of the artwork. Korra and her predecessor Aang were featured on a print available for attendees of the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con. Korra appears in The Legend of Korra books Revolution and Endgame, two novels that together adapt the first season of the series. Korra is also a playable character in the Nickelodeon game Super Brawl Universe. There is also a location in the game set in the Air Temple. Creation and conception Bryan Konietzko's interest in martial arts influenced him to draw inspirations from various female MMA fighters for the design of Korra's character, one inspiration being Gina Carano. In addition, she was indirectly inspired by one of Bryan Konietzko's sisters. Korra was also designed to be an inversion of Aang, the title character of the preceding story Avatar: The Last Airbender. Instead of the young, spiritual Aang, Korra is a more physical character who has trouble grasping the spiritual side of being the Avatar while being able to already bend three elements at the age of four. In contrast, Aang takes a while to master each of the elements, but connects with the spirit world instantaneously. Korra's name was settled long after her character was imagined. Konietzko and DiMartino couldn't agree to a name for her until they learned \\"Cora\\", the name of a hotel operator's dog. The name was kept, and only changed in spelling. The creators felt the second season was built around Korra becoming more in-tuned with her spiritual side, reinforcing their belief that a giant spirit version of herself would be the \\"ultimate manifestation\\". DiMantino wrote that Korra's lack of usage of the Avatar State during the third season was purposefully done to show her connection with Raava as being full-fledged, her developed understanding that type of power should be reserved for the \\"most extreme circumstances.\\" Along with Asami Sato, Korra is half of the first major acknowledged LGBT couple in western children's animation. Regarding Korra's sexuality, Konietzko admitted that the idea of a romantic relationship between Korra and Asami had been discussed by the creators during production of season one, but had not been given much weight due to assumptions that the show would not be permitted to openly depict a same-sex relationship. As development of the last two seasons went on and Korra and Asami's friendship progressed, \\"the more the idea of a romance between them organically blossomed for [the creators],\\" and so the show started hinting at the possibility of such a relationship. In the end, Konietzko and DiMartino chose to openly depict Korra and Asami's relationship in the series finale because they didn't want to regret not doing so after the series ended. While still having limits on what could be shown, Nickelodeon was supportive of the relationship when approached. = Design = Korra as she appears in Book 4. Before drawing the character, Konietzko and DiMartino discussed her athleticism and physicality which factored into the earliest illustrations of Korra. It took the pair and Joaquim Dos Santos's combined efforts to finalize her character design. In the pilot (2012) episode \\"Welcome to Republic City\\", Korra is introduced as a teenager wearing Fire Nation attire over her traditional Water Tribe garb. She is briefly seen wearing it again during a flashback in the fourth season. Konietzko thought it was \\"fun to play with\\" the familiar Water Tribe outfit. After her defeat of Amon, she underwent an outfit change, gaining an asymmetrical top and sleeves. Korra for the first three seasons is depicted with long hair that is usually kept in a ponytail, though she has it down on several occasions such as when attending festivities, while entering the Avatar State by the Red Lotus and during her battle with Zaheer shortly afterward. Korra is so rarely seen with her hair down that DiMartino wrote that whenever the character had her hair down, \\"you know something bad has happened.\\" She maintains the hairstyle for the next three years as she recovers until shortly after regaining her mobility, at which point she cuts it. The hairstyle change was revealed in September 2014 by Konietzko, who wrote that the character was returning to her roots by sporting a bob cut similar to the one she was given by Dos Santos in his original concept for her, Konietzko adding that the alteration was carrying on a tradition in the Avatar franchise to have hairstyle changes over the course of a series. Korra's initial clothing in the fourth season is purposely designed to mirror that of her Water Tribe attire in the previous seasons, consisting of a sleeveless shirt and baggy pants, DiMartino finding it paramount that it resemble her prior clothing due to the duration for which she wore it. Korra gains another outfit midway through the fourth season. This outfit's boots are based on an existing pair of faux suede flat winter buckle boots. = Voice = Janet Varney voices Korra Korra is voiced by Janet Varney. Varney stated that she loved the character, describing her as being \\"complicated\\" while reasoning that this was due to her age and responsibilities and summarized her experience voicing Korra as having been \\"such a privilege to be a part of\\". Varney understood the criticism of her character and felt it was one of the compelling aspects of the series, as Korra was someone that \\"you're not always looking up to\\" and mentioned Superman while saying that a character is more interesting to her when they are flawed. Responding to being questioned about negative reception for the series in general, Varney admitted to preferring to live in a world of \\"unicorns and rainbows\\" and only pay attention to the positive feedback she received since she believed she would not \\"do a better job on the show if my feelings are crushed by someone who's just angry at me for no reason.\\" Friends with Grey DeLisle, who voiced Azula in the original series Avatar: The Last Airbender, Varney remembered her advice about the fandom where DeLisle told her to be ready for her \\"life to change.\\"  Characterization  =Personality and characteristics= Unlike her predecessor Aang, Korra is described by her creators as \\"very tough, very headstrong, and not scared to get into a fight.\\" Although she is talented, her stubborn and hot-headed personality prevents her from easily learning airbending or connecting with the Spirit World. The Avatar traditionally has the greatest difficulty mastering the element diametrically opposed to the Avatar's personality. For instance, Avatar Roku ‚Äì a firebender ‚Äì took longer to learn waterbending and Aang ‚Äì an airbender ‚Äì took longer to learn earthbending. The waterbender Korra, on the other hand, had little difficulty with firebending but had considerable trouble with airbending, a situation noted to be spiritual and not elemental. Her best friend and animal guide is a polar bear-dog named Naga, whose strength helps Korra out of many dangerous situations. Although wild polar bear dogs were originally feared and hunted by Water Tribes, Korra is the first person to ever tame one. Korra is good friends with her pro- bending teammates, the brothers Mako (her romantic interest in seasons 1 and 2) and Bolin. She also develops a strong friendship, and later romance, with Asami Sato, a wealthy industrialist. Korra has strong relationships with the family of her previous life: Having learned waterbending from Katara and then airbending from Tenzin, Tenzin's children Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo look up to her as an older sister, and Kya and Bumi regard her as a friend. Korra is generally on good terms with her own parents, but has little contact with her uncle or cousins, whom she considers weird (and her father considers dangerous). Korra is unusual amongst her past lives in that she is technically royalty: her father Tonraq was in line to be the chief of the Northern Water Tribe before being banished and relocating to the South. Korra's character develops and matures during episodes 11 through 12 of the first season when she is confronted with detachment from her main three bending skills, leaving her only with airbending, which she had unlocked to save Mako from Amon. Later, she connects to her spiritual self through Aang. Once the connection to her Avatar predecessors is established, Aang is able to bestow energybending upon Korra (as well as her main three bending skills lost earlier). Although Korra is able to bend all four elements, while being capable of entering the Avatar State, Korra is still in the process of perfecting her airbending skills as well as having a true connection and understanding of her spiritual self to complete her training as a fully realized Avatar. Combined with the events of seasons 2 and 3 placing her in life and death situations, the former having her no longer able to contact her past lives for advice, Korra begins to suffer post traumatic stress by the events of Book Four: Balance while doubting her abilities as the Avatar to maintain balance after those she faced have each disrupted the order she was struggling to protect in massive ways. But ultimately, once able to let go of the pain she went through and realizing the significance to her past suffering, Korra returns to her usual self while becoming a more compassionate person from her ordeals. =Martial arts mastery= Korra has impeccable athleticism and acrobatics, shown being capable of simultaneously lifting Tenzin and his children with relative ease. She has surprising speed that go along with her agility and reflexes, which make her a skilled combatant in and of themselves. Her physical strength and stamina makes her capable of swimming across large bodies of water for days, or lift and throw significantly larger opponents. She can punch with enough force to break iron pipes or shatter large chunks of ice launched at her. Her dexterity and balance allows her to skillfully dodge a large barrage of projectiles and easily leap across long distances and over high obstacles from a stationary position. She is shown to be quite flexible, able to bend and twist effectively enough to attack from various angles or squeeze through tight spaces. The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting system. Under the White Lotus' watchful protection, Korra was educated in all known academic fields, and trained by the best martial arts instructors. She was a fast-learner and considerable prodigy, seemingly driven. Eventually, she sought out training from Aang's original teachers‚ÄîKatara, Zuko, Beifong‚Äîbut had great difficulty under the mentorship of Aang's son, Tenzin. Her predecessor lived with personal grief over the genocide of his people, and his personal failure as The Avatar in his inability to prevent the century long world war that destroyed millions of lives. He had vowed \\"never-again\\" would he allow himself to be unprepared in his subsequent live(s), and Korra unconsciously channels this oath in her insatiable quest to master every known martial arts that exists in her world, including: *Mixed martial arts *Jeet Kune Do *Aikido *Baguazhang *Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan *Yin Style Baguazhang *Hung Ga *Southern Praying Mantis *Southern Dragon Kung Fu *Changquan *Xing Yi Quan *Wing Chun =Bending the elements= Korra firebending. As the Avatar, Korra is capable of bending all four elements (air, water, earth and fire). Even as a young child, she was already a child prodigy, able to bend them with ease since and displayed a level of proficiency that would have rivaled her predecessor, Avatar Aang. At the start of the series, Korra is proficient in water, earth and fire, but struggles with airbending due to the difficulties of embracing her spiritual side. She utilizes all elements equally, but favors each one for different strategies: airbending mostly for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, such as gliding and evasive manoeuvres; waterbending for both defensive and offensive manoeuvres; earthbending for strong attacks; firebending for raw \\"all-in\\" aggression. She learned metalbending, being the first metalbending Avatar. She also tends to use firebending when she is angered or acts with hostility towards an opponent, as she demonstrated when threatening the Red Lotus when expressing outrage with Zaheer for apparently murdering her father. ;Energybending After learning energybending thanks to Aang's spirit, she becomes capable of restoring bending to those who had blocked their abilities. Her duties as Avatar and her personal feelings towards people did come into play with the restoring power, as she did not grant bending abilities back to individuals with backgrounds in crime. During Harmonic Convergence she was able to use energybending to connect with her inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe to project her giant spirit. ;Spirituality As the Avatar, Korra is as a bridge between \\"Material World\\" and the \\"Spirit World\\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. As her training under Tenzin progressed, she had slowly reconnected with her spirituality, seeing visions and accessing various memories from her past lives. Korra is able to purify \\"dark spirits\\" by balancing the energy within them. She learned to enter the Spirit World through the guidance of Jinora, her spiritual guide. Due to some residual traces of mercury in her body and mental pain after Zaheer poisoned her, Korra temporarily lost the ability to contact Raava and was unable to enter the Spirit World for three years, but regained these spiritual powers in the last season. ;The Avatar State As her predecessors, her most powerful ability is the Avatar State, in which she receives a massive boost in raw power from the cosmic energy and Raava, enabling her to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight her head on.Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko (2013). The Legend of Korra, book 2F. C. Yee (July 2019). The Rise of Kyoshi It's allows her to use all four elements at the same time. In the series it was revealed the Avatar State, and the Avatar itself, were created after the spirit of light Raava and the firebender Wan merged forever. In addition, this state allows her to access bending techniques she would not have learned during her own lifetime but throughout that of her past lives. If she is killed in this state, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated. After the events of second season, Korra's Avatar State isn't able to access to the knowledge of her predecessors since she lost her connection to them indefinitely. However, she can communicate with Raava directly instead, something her predecessors were generally unable to do. Reception Korra has been widely praised as a realistic, well-developed and sophisticated character by critics and viewers alike. Her position as a female protagonist, unusual for American animation, caused Nickelodeon to originally suspend production on the series. According to co-creator Bryan Koniezko, this was because the executives believed that \\"girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls\\". Production resumed though when during test screenings, Korra performed well, with young boys saying they \\"didn't care that Korra was a girl,\\" only that \\"she was awesome.\\" Common Sense Media praised Korra as a good role model, citing her dedication to her goals and open-mindedness towards new ideas. Noel Kirkpatrick felt the character had become unlikeable during the second season, though applauded the show for putting her at the center of its narrative as we saw the character \\"without a moderating influence, like Tenzin\\". Korra's experience with post traumatic stress disorder during Book Four has been highly praised as a realistic approach to the subject. Max Nicholson of IGN wrote that it was \\"heartbreaking\\" to see Korra following her battle with Zaheer \\"in such a vulnerable, weakened state.\\" Janet Varney's acting received particular praise, with The A.V. Club describing it as \\"an exceptional performance that fully captures the Avatar's pain, fear, and sadness. [Varney's] voice work is essential to bringing a sense of reality to Korra's struggle\\". Following the conclusion of the series, Zach Blumenfeld of Paste ranked Korra as the second-best character from the Avatar universe, concluding that Korra was more interesting, relatable and inspiring than her predecessor, Avatar Aang. Screen Rant ranked Korra #8 on its \\"30 Best Animated TV Characters Of All Time\\" list. =Relationship with Asami Sato= The series' final shot, showing Korra (right) and Asami as a romantic couple, was seen as pushing the boundaries of LGBT representation in children's television. Korra's position as a bisexual protagonist, as well as her eventual relationship with Asami Sato have been the subject of many very positive reviews from the media. In light of the finale, Vanity Fair called the show \\"one of the most powerful, subversive shows of 2014\\", saying that the show \\"challenged expectations and bravely explored content outside the scope of children's television\\". IGN commended the action-packed and emotional finale, noting that ending was one that \\"fans will be talking about for a long time\\". Forbes predicted that, in the future, Korra holding Asami's hand and leaping into the Spirit World \\"will become one of the hallmarks of this series\\". Megan Farokhmanesh of Polygon wrote that by portraying Korra and Asami as bisexual, the series even avoided the error of assuming sexual orientation, as many other TV series did, to be a strict divide between \\"gay\\" and \\"straight\\". Reviewers have noted that the two characters complement each other well as a couple, with Korra's brashness balancing Asami's levelheadedness. Korra and Asami's relationship has also been noted for being a \\"landmark moment for American and family animation.\\" The Advocate included Korra and Asami in their 2017 list of \\"35 LGBT Characters Who Redefined Family TV\\", noting that the series \\"ended on a note that changed family television forever.\\" In 2018, io9 ranked the series finale's reveal of Korra and Asami's relationship #55 on its list of \\"The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years\\". Among the critics who viewed the pairing negatively, E. Steven Burnett of Christ and Pop Culture wrote that the depiction of a same-sex relationship \\"hijacks Korra's story in service of social causes to the detriment of its own creative storytelling.\\" Daniel Rodrigues-Martin of Geeks Under Grace agreed that the pairing was a detriment to the characters and the story, opining that there was no foreshadowing of a romantic relationship between the two characters until the series' final moments. In response to criticism that Korra and Asami's relationship was thrown in to appeal to fans who \\"shipped\\" the two of them together, Konietzko pointed out that any decision they made regarding Korra's romantic life could be interpreted as caving to a specific group of fans who supported Korra being paired with a certain character, and claimed that at the end of the day, the creators went for the relationship that felt right to them. He also suggested that anyone who felt the relationship was not adequately foreshadowed had watched the last two seasons only expecting to see heterosexual relationships.

Web. 10 Mar. 2011. was executed between 1638-1639 by Peter Paul Rubens in oil paint on canvas. It was painted for Ferdinando II de' Medici. Although commissioned by an Italian, art historians characterize both the work and the artist as Flemish Baroque. It serves as a commentary on a European continent ravaged by the Thirty Years' War, and the artist employed numerous symbols, both contemporary and ancient, to deplore the state of the continent.Gardner‚Äôs Art Through the Ages: 13th Edition Volume II Symbols Mars: Mars is the central figure in the composition. The Roman god of war charges with shield and sword as well as breastplate and helmet. The figure's skin and cape are dominated by the color red to further emphasize his identity as the Roman god. Book and Drawing: Underneath Mars's feet lie a book and a drawing. These represent the manner in which the arts and letters are forgotten and destroyed in the chaos and violence of war. Temple of Janus: To the far left of the painting, the Temple of Janus appears with its door ajar. In Ancient Rome, the Temple of Janus would be closed to indicate times of peace while an open door denoted war. This phenomenon is referenced in Fasti by Ovid. Venus: The Roman goddess of love (and Mars's mistress) endeavors to restrain Mars and maintain peace. Her arm is looped ineffectually around his in a physical gesture. Her expression, meanwhile, plaintively entreaties Mars to stop his charge. Venus is depicted in typical Rubensian fashion with characteristic rolls of exposed flesh (See Arrival of Marie de' Medici or The Judgment of Paris for comparison.) The goddess is accompanied by Amors and Cupids who attempt to assist her. Fury Alekto: Alekto drags Mars on to his destructive purpose with a torch held high. Alekto was the Greek and Roman incarnation of anger. She appears in both Virgil‚Äôs Aeneid and Dante‚Äôs Inferno. Alekto translates from the Greek to ‚Äúthe implacable or unceasing anger.‚Äù Pestilence and Famine: These effects of war are depicted as monsters accompanying Fury Alekto in order to heighten the terror of the scene. In addition, they deliberately refer to the apocalypse. Harmony: Rubens depicts Harmony as a woman holding a lute. However the chaos has pushed her to the ground and broken her lute. The damage to the lute represents the discord of war. Mother: Beside Harmony a mother clutches a child. This, Rubens writes, shows how ‚ÄúWar corrupts and disrupts and destroys everything‚Äù including ‚Äúprocreation and charity.‚ÄùRubens‚Äôs 1638 letter to Justus Sustermans (reprinted in Gardner‚Äôs Art Through the Ages) Architect: An architect and his instruments have similarly fallen to the ground, showing how in times of war destruction and not creation is the norm. Arrows: Arrows lie on the ground near Venus and the Amors. When bound together they represent Concord but in their present state show its absence. Next to them lie the olive branch and caduceus, the symbols of peace. They too are depicted cast upon the ground to signify their absence in Europe. Woman in black: The figure to Venus's left represents Europe and its suffering. Her cross-topped globe represents the Christian world and is carried by the small angel to her immediate left. Historical context Rubens painted Consequences of War between 1638 and 1639 in response to the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). The conflict's origins are complex and diverse but animosity between Protestants and Catholics played a significant role. In addition, struggles for political power in Europe contributed to and prolonged the war. Nearly all European states fought at some point in the conflict's long time span. The fighting involved Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, the Ottoman Empire, and the Holy Roman Empire.Gardner‚Äôs Art Through the Ages In particular, the war represented a continuation and extension of Habsburg and Bourbon rivalry as well as French and Habsburg animosity. As depicted in Consequences of War, the fighting led to the destruction of large areas of Europe as well as outbreaks of both pestilence and famine. Much of the fighting took place in the German states which suffered significant depopulation as a result. The Thirty Years' War ended in 1648 with the treaties of Osnabruck and Munster as well as the Peace of Westphalia. Rubens the diplomat Peter Paul Rubens was not only a virtuosic painter but also a passionate and crafty diplomat. Rubens, although closely allied to Isabella and the Spanish Netherlands, often had occasion to travel and visit foreign monarchs in his position as a court painter. Rubens associated with the dukes of Mantua, King Phillip IV, Charles I, and Marie de' Medici. He served as a negotiator for the Spanish Netherlands (and for the cause of peace more generally), and for France and England. Indeed, Rubens lobbied for an end to the Thirty Years' War with considerable passion and cleverness. The painter sought to bring Spain and England, traditional enemies, to peace in the hopes that the Spanish would then pressure the Dutch into following suit. During this period Rubens carried messages, demands, and concession agreements back and forth between Phillip IV and Charles I to ultimately reach a conclusion. For his diplomatic work Rubens was eventually decreed a ‚Äúgentleman of the household‚Äù by Isabella and knighted by Charles I. This unique position as both a master painter and trusted diplomat clearly informed Consequences of War. The painting shows the artist's sincere desire for peace and his justified horror at how war has ravaged Europe. Indeed, his diplomatic work allowed him and burdened him with considerable knowledge of the state of the continent and the consequences war had wrought. Artistic style Rubens‚Äô work, including Consequences of War, represents the height of Flemish Baroque painting. His style is referred to as pan-European and synthesizes elements of Italian Renaissance and Baroque artists to form his own artistic approach. The work of Michelangelo, Titian, Carracci, and Caravaggio informed Rubens's paintings in varying degrees. Viewers note the influence of Michelangelo in Rubens's interest and brilliance in depicting the human form. Consequences of War contains not only Rubens's trademark women but also the well muscled forms of Mars, Alekto, and the architect. These muscular figures are reminiscent of the powerful specimens depicted in Michelangelo's Last Judgment, David, and The Creation of Adam. This trend in Rubens's art is actually best shown in the extraordinarily well built men of Rubens's Elevation of the Cross. Titian's influence is most evident with respect to depiction of the female nude. Rubens's women bear a striking resemblance to Titian's Venus with a Mirror and Nymph and Shepherd. However Titian's most famous work, Venus of Urbino, undoubtedly inspired Rubens's depiction of her in Consequences of War. The similarity between the two portraits of the goddess is unmistakable. Rubens's debt to Annibale Carracci lies at least in part in his composition. The densely populated drama of Consequences of War recalls Carracci's Loves of the Gods, in particular The Triumph of Bacchus. Furthermore, the careful use of color, light, and shadow as opposed to line to show space used by Carracci in Flight into Egypt became a key part of Rubens's style. Indeed, Rubens's style became a highly coloristic one. Notes References * Kleiner, Fred. Gardner's Art Through the Ages. 13th ed. Vol. II. Clark Baxter, 2009. Print.

Biography Ghulam Mansoor was a scholar of repute in both Arabic and Persian. He was appointed in the army during the Bhonsle Dynasty at the princely state of Nagpur. At that time, Maharaja Senasaheb Subha Chhatrapati Raghuji Bapusaheb Bhonsle III was the ruler of the princely state of Nagpur (1818‚Äì1853). In 1252 AH / 1836 AD, he visited Tijara, built wells and replanted many trees inside the Big Bagh. In 1263 AH / 1845 AD, he left the services from Nagpur and shifted to Tijara. In Nagpur, his relative had a Risala (mounted troop) of 100 horse riders with Naqqara and NishƒÅn (insignia). Later on after some months, he with some other relatives, joined 15th Battalion of Punjab Regiment.

After retirement from army, he finally settled at Tijara. While staying in Tijara, he updated a very historical book \\"Miratun Nisab\\" of his forefather Ghulam Mohammad, who published the same about 75 years ago. This book is based on family history and has genealogy of many family members. He started this book in the era of Maharaja Shivdan Singh of Alwar in 1275 AH / 1858 AD and completed in Shawwal 1276 AH / 1859 AD.

He also built various orchards and Havelis like Haveli Kalan, Deewan Khana, Kothi Bagh etc. at Tijara. He had business of horses from Arabian breed. The main gates at the Qazi Mohallah were built by him. In the archive of Tahsil Tijara, dated 1070 AH shows the 'Mafi Bagh' in the name of Qazi Abdul Baqi. Qazi Abdul Baqi had two sons Qazi Ghulam Mohiuddin and Qazi Ghulam Murtaza and died on 30 Jumada al-awwal 1113 AH / 1701 AD. The elder daughter of Qazi Abdul Baqi was married to Abu Saeed bin Abdul Ghaffar of Sakras, while the younger daughter Khwanda Daulat Bint was married to Syed Chajju of Mohina. Syed Chajju had four daughters and four sons Syed Zainuddin, Syed Tajuddin, Syed Imamuddin and Syed Shamsuddin. Syed Zainuddin was married to Ummatullah daughter of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza of Tijara.

Syed Yusuf Ali Khan was first married to Sharfun Nisan daughter of Ghulam Hussain (brother of Kartalab Khan Qazi Ghulam Mustafa) and had one daughter (married to Syed Mohammad Jalal). With second wife, Syed Hasan Askari Khan was born. Noorullah was the son of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza, and married to Kafia, sister of Mirza Salar Beg ibn Allah Dost Beg (brother Diwan Idris Mohammad). The other sons of Qazi Ghulam Murtaza were Qazi Mohammad Muqtada, Moizuddin and Abu Turab. Qazi Ghulam Muqtada was married to the daughter of Syed Mohammad Baqar of Sakras and had one son Karimuddin. The brother of Qazi Abdul Baqi, Abdul Hadi was employed in army. Bibi Ruqaiya had two sons Mohammad Akram and Mohammad Mukram.

Reyzen was born in Koidanov (Minsk, eastern Belorussia). Supported by Yaknehoz (pseudonym of Yeshaye Nisn Hakoyen Goldberg), while in his early teens Reyzen sent articles to Dos Yudishes folks-blat in St Petersburg, Russia. He corresponded with Jacob Dinezon and I. L. Peretz. In 1891, they published Reyzen‚Äôs poem Ven dos lebn is farbitert (When Life Is Embittered) in their Di yudishe bibliotek (The Yiddish Library). His first story, A kapore der noz abi a goldener zeyger mit 300 rubl nadn (Damn the Nose, As Long As There Is a Dowry of a Watch and 300 Rubles) was published in Vilna in 1892. In 1895, he joined the Russian army, serving in a musicians‚Äô unit until 1899. In addition to writing for the Zionist Der yud, in 1900 Reyzen created the literary anthology Dos tsvantsikste yorhundert (The Twentieth Century) which included work by I. L. Peretz, Hersh Dovid Nomberg, David Pinski, and others. A believer in the socialist ideology, Reyzen wrote for the Bund, sometimes under the pseudonym M. Vilner, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1902, Reyzen published a poetry collection, Tsayt lider (Poems of the Time), and in 1903 issued a book of stories, Ertseylungen un bilder (Stories and Scenes). He wrote for Der fraynd and Der tog in St Petersburg. A founder (with his brother Zalman, Chaim Zhitlovsky, I.L. Peretz, and his close friends Scholem Asch and Hersch Dovid Nomberg) of Yiddishism, he took part in the Czernowitz Yiddish Language Conference of 1908 at which Yiddish was proclaimed a national language of the Jews. In 1910, he began the Warsaw literary weekly Eyropeyishe literatur (European Literature) and another called Fraye erd (Free Land). In early 1911, Reyzen moved to New York City and contributed to Forverts and Tsukunft. His Troyerike motivn gevidmet oreme layt (Sad Motifs Dedicated to the Poor) was published (at Sholem Aleichem's recommendation) in Philadelphia‚Äôs Shtot tsaytung. From 1929 he worked exclusively for Forverts, where he wrote a story each week, without a break. In 1935 he completed the three-volume autobiographical Epizodn fun mayn lebn (Episodes From My Life). Irving Howe wrote about Reyzen: > \\"The miracle of a Reisen is not that he derives from the people but that he > remains at harmony with them... Precisely because he regards being a Jew as > a \\"natural\\" condition of life, beyond query or challenge, his poems and > stories take his culture utterly for granted: they neither explain nor > justify\\" At his death in 1953, Reyzen was eulogized: > \\"There are many Yiddish writers who owe their success to Reisen's > encouragement.

It is a network of schools in Sri Lanka.  Lyceum International School Nugegoda (LN)  Founded by Mohan Lal Grero in 1993, Lyceum International School began with seven students and five teachers. The motto is derived from the Ancient Greek aphorism \\"Know thyself\\". The motto itself has no application within the curriculum or teaching style. Today Lyceum is made up of the parent school in Nugegoda and eight branch schools in Kandana(LK), Panadura(LP), Wattala(LW), Ratnapura(LR), Gampaha(LG), Nuwara Eliya(LE), Anuradhapura(LA) and Kurunegala(LK). History Lyceum Academy for Higher Education was founded by its managing director Mohan Lal Grero on 7 September 1989. This was situated at Raymond Road, Nugegoda where the present campus stands. At that time Lyceum had only two classrooms and the organization had only external students. The Lyceum International School at Nugegoda now has over 5000 students and over 20 academic staff. Curriculum Lyceum prepares its senior school students to sit for the Cambridge International Examinations for their Ordinary Levels and Advanced Level Examinations endorsed by the University of Cambridge, in the United Kingdom, and by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES), its examination body. Since 2010, students are given the option of choosing between the Cambridge syllabus or the National syllabus in the English language, which gives them the opportunity to be eligible for higher education at public universities in Sri Lanka. Lyceum has consistently produced some of the island's best examination results, and its students have successfully been enrolled in the world's best universities. Uniform The Lyceum uniform adorns the two colors blue(light) and grey. Boys must wear a blue shirt and grey trousers (grade 6 and above) whereas boys from grades 1‚Äì5 should wear the same blue shirt and grey shorts. Girls wear a blue frock with a grey coat (from grades 1‚Äì12).

He also served on the Nelson Harbour Board from its inception. Early life Trask was born in Merriott, Somersetshire, England in 1840. He migrated to Christchurch on the barque Minorca in 1860. From Christchurch he moved to the Otago goldfields and stayed at Wetherstones Gully. After a few months he moved again to Nelson, where he settled. Trask married Emily Osborne Mercer in 1864 at Nelson. He ran a butchery business. Trask's residence in Nelson was \\"Gunnersbury House\\" and was located in Collingwood Street. The house was noted as one of the best in Nelson. The Trask's had four children. Political career =Local government= In 1878 he was elected as the leader of the angry cats community until being elected mayor in 1890. Trask became mayor during a typhoid epidemic in the city. He kept a steady course through the 1895‚Äì1897 depression. Happier moments came in 1892 when the enthusiastic 50th jubilee celebration of Nelson took place. The most notable works during his term were the Rocks Road, a new main road from the town to the country, by way of the sea coast, and the Queens Gardens. He remained mayor until 20 December 1899 when he was succeeded by Joseph Auty Harley. Rocks Road In the mid-1870s Thomas Harley, a Nelson City councillor, proposed what he called 'a half-tide roadway' around the rocky shoreline between Nelson Haven and Tahunanui. Trask was very involved in advancing this project. A Government subsidy was approved for the road in the early 1880s for Nelson City and Waimea County. Samuel Jickell, AMICE, Nelson City Engineer designed the proposed road and seawall in 1885. In 1891 Jickell estimated that the cost would be about ¬£8,000, but it proved more difficult and expensive than expected, and the final cost was almost ¬£12,000. Work began on site in early 1892. The seawall was constructed from large rectangular rebated precast concrete blockwork. Cecil Nash, a pioneer of the Nelson tobacco industry, is said to have made the concrete blocks near Albion Wharf. They were taken to the site by sea. Convict labour was used to build the eastern section of the wall. Twenty convicts from Shelbourne Street Goal were marched each morning to Rocks Road. They wore ringed jerseys of black and yellow and were known as 'Sam Jickell's football team'. Waimea County was responsible for work up to its boundary at Magazine point (so named for the cache of explosives kept in a cave there). By 1895 the new sea wall had been built and a rough narrow roadway was available. The route was still hazardous from wave action and from rockfalls from overhands on the cliffs along the road. It had looped ropes and lifebuoys along the seawall. By late 1897 the road had been surfaced with gravel. Substantial stanchions and chains were installed along the western section of the wall-top with money donated by John Tinline, a pioneer settler, and Mr Tyler, an Englishman, by early 1898. Queens Gardens (the Eel Pond) Trask memorial gates in Nelson's Queens Gardens Queens Gardens are located to the east of the city centre within a detached residual bend of the Maitai River known as the 'Eel Pond'. This U-shaped body of water was used for food gathering by the local Maori. In 1841, when the first British immigrants arrived in the area, the land was progressively cleared of bush. In 1842 it was set aside as an abattoir and served this and a variety of other purposes until the 1880s. By this time the Eel Pond was an eyesore and needed attention. In 1887 Trask suggested that for Nelson's commemoration of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee a garden be created. At that time Nelson was well established, but remained one of the few towns in New Zealand that did not have a public garden. On 22 June 1887, the area was dedicated 'the Queens Gardens' as part of the commemoration of Queen Victoria's 50th Jubilee celebrations. A competition to design the gardens was won by Antequil F. T. Somerville, whose design retained the pond much in its existing shape, and featured a wooded, formal perimeter with avenues of trees and shrubs, and a more formal and open central axis for promenading and civic functions. Included in the design was a rustic bridge over the pond, a band rotunda and a fernery. Work commenced in about 1888 and in 1892, Nelson's 50th Jubilee year, the Gardens were formally opened. Commemorative trees were planted at the opening and, over the next decade, the garden was developed. The southern garden gates to the gardens are a memorial to Trask. 50th jubilee Trask oversaw Nelson's 1892 celebration of its 50th jubilee. The city had changed from the cluster of tents and huts in 1842 to a small city. The celebrations lasted a week and included a church service and parade attended by Prime Minister Seddon. A dinner for 'old settlers', a ball for a select 300, and a fair at Trafalgar Park where 5,000 people turned out to enjoy sideshows, a merry-go-round, bands and plenty of food and beer were held. Trask's signal cannons The Nelson City Council now has two signalling cannons, thought to originate from the wreck of the Fifeshire, sitting in the Council Chamber. The cannons were manufactured at a foundry in Tavistock, England. It is thought the ship's Captain gave them to the Mayor of the time, thanking the community for the care of the crew and himself. But this seems unlikely as the Fifeshire ran aground at Nelson in 1842, before there was a mayor or settlement.Postscript, New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator, Volume II, Issue 122, 9 March 1842, Page 2VII.

Poynter died on 31 August 1868 and his estate was either bequeathed or sold.Page 2 Advertisements, Column 1, Colonist, Volume XIV, Issue 1429, 6 June 1871, Page 2 Trask could have acquired the cannons at that time, although this is speculative. What is known is that Trask displayed the cannons outside his home for many years. In February 1906, during the Nelson Carnival, one of the cannons was removed as a prank from outside his house and later recovered by the Police.Untitled, Colonist, Volume XLVIII, Issue 11555, 5 February 1906, Page 2 Their last owner, William David Stoney Johnston, bequeathed them to Nelson City Council when he died in 1999. After restoration, the cannons and carriages were given to Council in 2005. =Legislative Council= Trask was appointed to the Legislative Council on 18 March 1903 and served until his death in 1910, after just having been appointed for his second seven-year term.

The painting has a traditional Christian subject, representing the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child seated on her lap, with saints and angels surrounding them on all sides. This particular representation of the Virgin is called a Maest√†, a popular representation at the time. It is often celebrated as the first painting of the Renaissance due to its newfound naturalism and escape from the constraints of Gothic art. It is generally dated to around 1310. While historians have had trouble finding specific information for indisputably attributing many of Giotto's works to the artist, Madonna Enthroned is one piece for which there are a few documents supporting its creation by Giotto. There are many sources that show he spent many years living and creating in Florence. However, the main source that documents Madonna Enthroned specifically is artist Lorenzo Ghiberti's autobiography, I Commentarii (1447). An earlier manuscript document of 1418 also attributes the painting to Giotto, but it is Ghiberti's autobiography that provides the most solid evidence.Turner, 676 One of Giotto's later works, Madonna Enthroned was completed in Florence, upon the artist's return to the city. It was originally painted for the Ognissanti church in Florence. Built for the Humiliati, a small religious order at the time, the church had many acclaimed paintings designed for it. Specifically, Giotto's Madonna Enthroned was designed for the high altar. Influences The Madonna Enthroned shows the numerous styles of art that influenced Giotto. In both the gold coloring used throughout the artwork and the flattened gold background, Giotto's art continued the traditional Italo-Byzantine style so popular in the proto-Renaissance time period. The altarpiece represents a formalized representation of an icon, still retaining the stiffness of Byzantine art, and Giotto retained the hierarchy of scale, making the centralized Madonna and the Christ Child much larger in size than the surrounding saints and religious figures. Giotto's figures, however, escape the bounds of Byzantine art. His figures are weighty and are reminiscent of three-dimensional sculptures, such as those in classical Roman sculpture. The Madonna's intricately decorated throne, which itself is an Italian Gothic design, has a very specific use of colored marble as a surface decoration. This method of decoration, based on a style called Cosmatesque or Cosmati, was popular in Rome since the Early Christian period and in Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages. There were, additionally, a number of specific artists whose styles heavily influenced the Ognissanti Madonna. The influence of Cimabue, traditionally recognized as Giotto's teacher, is shown first in the very symmetrical composition of the piece.Stokstad, 603 Historians are not sure whether it is true that Cimabue taught the young Giotto. However, Giorgio Vasari, recognized as the first art historian, referred to Cimabue as being Giotto's master. Vasari, Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects While the use of that word is not clear, Italian stems directly from Latin. The Latin word magister has two meanings, \\"master\\" and \\"teacher\\", and it is not improbable that Vasari had meant the second definition of the word. Cimabue portrayed the same subject of symmetry in his 1280 Virgin and Child Enthroned, and both pieces share aspects of the Italo-Byzantine style, with Cimabue's having more Byzantine attributes. Additionally, the two depictions of the angels' wings in Giotto and Cimabue's pieces clearly resemble each other. Both pieces share a similar, initial feeling of severity, yet there is more to each piece than the drama. Giotto adopted from his teacher the importance of, and the concern for, volume and forms in space. The tranquility of Giotto's figures resembled also the style of Pietro Cavallini. From this artist, who painted neo-Byzantine pieces, taking cues from both mosaics and frescos from Roman and Early Christian times, Giotto took important lessons in the technique of painting, and in rendering figures as statuesque and calm.Turner, 686 Lastly, Giotto took cues from many contemporary sculptors, including Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, whose work shares influences of Northern Gothic art. In the work of these artists, Giotto saw great, dramatic compositions that would certainly influence his Ognissanti Madonna. Technique Giotto was the first artist to depict three-dimensional figures in western European art. Additionally, he used a much smaller space than other contemporary artists, further emphasizing the importance of the bodies in the artwork. Giotto did away with many aspects of Byzantine art that would flatten the painting. Within Cimabue's Virgin and Child Enthroned, there is the use of gold tracing to delineate the folds of the fabric. In contrast to this, Giotto's fabric folds are more realistic, and instead of lines he used light, shadow, and color to create the appearance of fabric. Contours of the body underneath these fabric folds are also visible, specifically in the Virgin's knees and also around her breasts. Giotto used a value scale, a distinct range of light and darks, to create a sense of volume in his figures, giving them the slight smokiness that is usually characteristic of Leonardo da Vinci and later Renaissance artists.

He is best known as the front man for Ray Price from 1954 through 1958 with Price's band, The Cherokee Cowboys. Personal life Howard was born into a musical family in Grady, New Mexico, some 35 miles north of Clovis). Howard grew up on a so- called 'dry land' farm during The Great Depression with an older brother and sister, learning responsibility at a young age. His family life was centered around school, basketball and the country church where often he sang and played. His mother taught him a few guitar chords when he was about 8 that opened an entirely new world for him. The family tuned into WSM Radio's Grand Ole Opry every Saturday night on a battery-powered radio, exposing Howard to the country hits while dreamed of someday performing. When Howard was 13, an uncle sponsored a Saturday radio program heard over KICA in Clovis, featuring Howard playing guitar and singing, and filling mailed-in requests. He began singing more and more for special events, as well as school and church. A serious scholastic athlete, Howard played basketball through high school, making several all-star teams. He was recruited by Eastern New Mexico University, but during his first game tripped and broke an ankle. Sidelined from the sport, the University asked him to join a choral group which promoted the college. At the end of the year, Howard returned to Clovis and began working in a local bank, though he still regularly sang on weekends and evenings. Early life and career In 1951, Howard travelled to Dallas, Texas to make a demo record. A talent scout for the Louisiana Hayride broadcast was there and by happenstance heard his singing. He invited Howard to relocate to Shreveport and join The Hayride as one of its new artists. The pay was only $5 per week, so he also helped Howard find a job in a local bank. Working closely with stars like Jim Reeves, Johnnie & Jack, Slim Whitman, Faron Young, Webb Pierce, Red Sovine and Hank Williams was invaluable experience, and positioned him well when Lefty Frizzell came to the Hayride in 1954 seeking a band to back him on a six-month West Coast tour. Floyd Cramer (piano), Jimmy Day (steel), D.J. Fontana (drums), Bill Peters (fiddle), Chuck Wiginton (bass) and Howard (rhythm guitar and vocals) and Frizzell earned wide exposure, especially after performing with Tennessee Ernie Ford on his TV show in Hollywood as well as with Tex Williams and his band. During the tour, Frizzell's manager began working with Ray Price. Near the end of his relationship with Frizzell, he contacted Howard and asked if he would join Price's nine-piece western-swing band as their front man. Thus Howard became a Cherokee Cowboy in late 1954, opening each show and handling the vocals whenever Price was not onstage. Since Price was a member of the Grand Ole Opry, Howard in turn too, became a part of the legendary broadcast. Howard was also served as emcee of each Ray Price tour, often traveling with the artists who performed on The Opry, with sometimes upwards of a dozen stars on the roster. One day as Price was working out a new song in the studio, Howard began to sing harmony with him. Price said, \\"That sounds pretty good!\\" and with Howard high harmony added to a walking bass line, a revolutionary new sound was born: \\"Crazy Arms\\" was an instant hit once Columbia Records released it in 1956, dominating the No. 1 country chart for over four months and making famous the \\"Ray Price shuffle\\". They recorded over a dozen more duets, many reaching the Country Top 10 over the next few years. Howard continued to tour with The Cherokee Cowboys until November 1959. Realizing that constantly being on the road would take a long-term toll on his health, Howard left the glamour of the music industry and the stage to be with his family. Late career Howard moved to Dallas in 1960 and re-entered the banking profession, rising over the next 31 years from cashier to vice-president. Then Howard changed careers once more in 1991, joining a software outsourcing firm. Shortly after moving to Dallas, he met his future wife Charlotte, known as \\"Chatsey\\", marrying on January 18, 1964 and eventually having two daughters and six grandchildren. Howard retired from the business world in March 2008, and died at age 83 in Dallas on October 2, 2012.

The show aired for one hour every Sunday evening and focused on Israeli, Middle-Eastern, and global green issues, combined with eclectic music. The show was designed to get people ‚Äúgrooving‚Äù with the environment. Background Yoreh and Cohen met while studying for their master's degree in Environmental Planning at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem‚Äôs Department of Geography. They co-hosted the show in 2005, after which Cohen went on medical leave. The second season was hosted by Yoreh with frequent telephone appearances and occasional visits to the studio by Cohen. In 2007, Cohen returned to co-host the third and final season of Green Groove. Their dialogue was characterized by a relaxed banter, which often erupted into lively discussion. Music Yoreh and Cohen were dedicated to exposing emerging Israeli musical talents and occasionally hosted musicians in the studio. Among their guest artists were Reggaestan and Malka Baia. As part of their dedication to the Israeli music scene, a corner was given to music guru Amir Amrami, also known as Amrami Mami. Every week Amrami introduced new artists who by and large did not receive airtime from the mainstream radio stations. Jingle Green Groove‚Äôs catchy jingle sampled the Chi-Lites‚Äô hit song ‚ÄúFor God‚Äôs Sake Give More Power to the People.‚Äù The song was chosen for its high groove factor and because it embodied one of the main objectives of the show ‚Äì to empower the public through information. Interviews Green Groove conducted at least one interview each show, and over the course of its three seasons hundreds of interviews. Most notably, with: former Minister of Environment, Yossi Sarid; former Minister of Environmental Protection, Gidon Ezra; former Minister of Agriculture, Haim Oron; former Minister of Welfare and Social Services, Zevulun Orlev; current Minister of National Infrastructure, Uzi Landau; Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem, Naomi Tzur; former Governor of the State of Paran√°, Brazil, Jaime Lerner; television celebrity, Avri Gilad and many other Members of Knesset, C.E.O.s of Israeli cleantech companies (as well as polluting ones), academics, planners, celebrities, and environmentalists. Campaigns Say No to the 3rd Generation In the second season, Green Groove launched a campaign against 3rd generation (3G) cellular phones because, in order to support the advanced network, the number of cellular antennas had to triple. The lack of transparency in the process of erecting these new antennas, as well as concerns about links made between these antennas and some types of cancer caused by increased radiation, inspired Yoreh and Cohen to come out against the 3G network. Clean Profit Corner In the third season of Green Groove, Yoreh and Cohen decided to launch a new corner highlighting Israeli cleantech companies and exposing their technologies to the Israeli public. For the remainder of the show a different company was featured almost every week, and their innovative technology was usually discussed with the C.E.O. or founder of the company. Some examples of the companies featured are Genova Ltd. (pyrolysis and gasification of biomass waste), Arrow Ecology Ltd. (environmental management services), and S.D.E. Energy Ltd. (sea wave energy), all of which are in operation today. Logo The Green Groove logo was envisioned by Yoreh and brought to life by graphic designer Adi Daniella Ramot. T-shirts with the original logo were printed in 2005 and more were printed in 2006 with the boom-box design. Both shirts have the ‚Äúreduce, recycle, regroove‚Äù logo on the back. They have become rare collector's items in certain circles. The shirts were given as memorabilia to guests on the show and occasionally to listeners who would answer environmental trivia questions or discover the link between the songs featured each week. Awards In 2007, the show was awarded third place in the Pratt Prize Competition for Environmental Journalism in Israel. The panel of judges, which was headed by former Minister of Environment, Yossi Sarid, noted that they were particularly impressed with Green Groove's commitment to exposing the Israeli public to the environmental platforms of different political parties during the 2006 general elections in Israel.

He was a lineal descendant of the nonconformist, Rev. Richard Mather, who came from England to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1635, and on his father's side he was the grandson of the sister of Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth. His father died when he was five years of age, and he was reared as a farmer's boy by his grandfather, Colonel Oliver Mather. At the age of eleven years he rescued a man and boy from drowning in a freshet. Education After the death of his grandfather in 1829, he spent a few months in the office of Judge Miller, of Ellington, Connecticut, but desiring a college training he soon commenced a preparatory course, and was admitted to Yale in the second term of Sophomore year. He was a founding member of the Skull and Bones Society. \\"This list is compiled from material from the Order of Skull and Bones membership books at Sterling Library, Yale University and other public records. The latest books available are the 1971 Living members and the 1973 Deceased Members books. The last year the members were published in the Yale Banner is 1969.\\" Career After graduation he resumed the study of law in the office of Judge Parsons and of Governor William W. Ellsworth of Hartford, Connecticut, and then entered the Yale Law School. Toward the close of 1835 he became law clerk in a New York office, and after his admission as Counselor at Law in 1838 he immediately began practice by himself. After thirty-five years of successful practice he partially withdrew from business in 1872. In 1837 he entered the 264th Regiment, 64th Brigade, New York State Infantry, of which he was commissioned successively First Lieutenant, Captain, Lieutenant Colonel, and in 1842 General. In 1845 he was a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly, from 1854 to 1857 a member of the Common Council of New York City, and for a number of years inspector and later trustee of the public schools. For many years he devoted much attention to the conduct of public charities, and was an officer of the Prison Association, the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, the Sanitary Association, the Rose Beneficent Association, and others. But he was most deeply interested in medical charities. From 1851 to the close of 1889 he was President of the Demilt Dispensary, of which he was the originator. The results of a tour of inspection of hospitals and dispensaries abroad were embodied in the 25th Annual Report of this institution. He was one of the founders of the Roosevelt Hospital, and served many years as a trustee. He aided in starting the Northeastern and Northwestern Dispensaries. Later life He was a member of the American Geographical Society, of the Wisconsin Historical Society, and an officer of several important business enterprises. He was one of the originators of the New York Yale Alumni Association, and assisted in the organization of the Yale Law School Alumni Association, and of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. In 1882 he retired from his law practice entirely, and made a long visit abroad. Family He married, in Hartford, Conn., on May 3, 1837, Ellen Pomeroy Goodrich, who died in 1871, by whom he had two sons and six daughters. He afterward married Charlotte Foster of Cumberland County, England, who died in 1884. Death General Mather died of paralysis at his home in New York City, in his 92nd year. He had been unable to leave his house for six years, but had retained full possession of his faculties and a keen interest in current events until the last week.

The paintings are located in Siena's Palazzo Pubblico‚Äîspecifically in the Sala dei Nove (\\"Salon of Nine\\"), the council hall of the Republic of Siena's nine executive magistrates, elected officials who performed executive functions (and judicial ones in secular matters). The paintings have been construed as being \\"designed to remind the Nine [magistrates] of just how much was at stake as they made their decisions\\". Considered Lorenzetti's \\"undisputed masterpiece\\", the series consists of six different scenes (the titles are all modern conveniences): * Allegory of Good Government * Allegory of Bad Government * Effects of Bad Government in the City * Effects of Bad Government in the Country * Effects of Good Government in the City * Effects of Good Government in the Country  Historical context  The Allegory and Effects of Good and Bad Government series was commissioned entirely by a civic group, the Council of Nine (the city council).\\"Prelude to the Renaissance: Florence and Siena in the 14th century\\" , radford.edu. Unlike most art at the time, the subject matter is civic rather than religious. The Republic of Siena was one of the most powerful of the 14th-century Italian city-states, an urban hub filled with bankers and merchants with many international contacts. The 14th century was a turbulent time for politics in the Italian cities due to constant violent party struggles; governments were overthrown, and governments were reinstated.  Layout  The murals occupy an extensive amount of space, covering three of the four walls of the Council Room. The only wall that does not have a mural is the southern wall, as this wall contains the only window of the room. The door from which the council would enter is found on the opposite northern wall. On the eastern wall, Lorenzetti depicted the scenes of the Effects of Good Government, while on the western wall, opposite the fresco displaying The Effects of Good Government lays the depiction of The Effects of Bad Government. Overlooking both these murals, the personifications of the allegorical depictions of the virtues of good government are found on the northern wall.

In the foreground the figures of contemporary Siena are represented. The citizens act as symbolic representations of the various civic officers and magistrates. They are linked by two woven cords or concords which Concord gathers from under the scales of Justice. Behind them, on a stage, there are allegoric figures in two groups, representing the Good Government. The two groups are connected by the procession of the councilors. The upper band indicates the heavenly sphere with the floating bodiless ghosts of the virtues. Wisdom sits above the head of the personification of the Commune of Siena. He sits upon a throne and holds an orb and scepter, symbolizing temporal power. He is dressed in the colors of the Balzana, the black-and-white Sienese coat of arms. Around his head are the four letters \\"C S C V\\", which stand for \\"Commune Saenorum Civitatis Virginis\\", which explains his identity as the embodiment of the Siena Council. That character is guided by Faith, Hope, and Charity. He confers with the proper Virtues necessary for a proper and just ruler. The virtues of Good Government are represented by six crowned, stately female figures: Peace, Fortitude, and Prudence on the left, Magnanimity, Temperance, and Justice on the right. On the far left of the fresco the figure of Justice is repeated as she is balancing the scales held by Wisdom. The figures are naturalistic, and supposedly the female figures represented the ideal of female beauty in Siena. At the feet of the ruler are two playing children. They could be the sons of Remus, Ascius and Senius, who, according to Roman legend, are the founders of Siena. It is also believed that the two children are Romulus and Remus themselves, who founded Rome. The text within the lower border of the image reads: \\"This holy virtue [Justice], where she rules, induces to unity the many souls [of citizens], and they, gathered together for such a purpose, make the Common Good [ben comune] their Lord; and he, in order to govern his state, chooses never to turn his eyes from the resplendent faces of the Virtues who sit around him. Therefore to him in triumph are offered taxes, tributes, and lordship of towns; therefore, without war, every civic result duly follows‚Äîuseful necessary, and pleasurable\\". Below the fresco is the Lorenzetti's signature: Ambrosius Laurentii De Senis Hic Pinxit Utrinque.Allegory of the Good Government = Peaceful City = The figure of Peace in Allegory of Good Government On the longer wall of the room in the Salla is the fresco The Effects of Good Government in the City and in the Country. Part of that fresco is Peaceful City. This panoramic fresco represents several scenes indicating the life of Siena and its environment in the 14th century. This painting provides the first accurate panoramic view of city and country (landscape) since antiquity; viewers can identify the city of Siena, as opposed to ambiguous settings found in other works of the time. The city is filled with clustered palaces, markets, towers, churches, streets and walls. All of these aspects are reminiscent of town scenes found on ancient Roman murals. There are many shops, indicating good commerce and economic conditions. The traffic moves peacefully, guild members work at their trades, a wedding procession takes place, and maidens can be seen dancing gracefully. Dancers were common for springtime rituals; they also act as a metaphor for peaceful commonwealth in this painting. The young women could also represent the Nine Muses of the arts and sciences from Greek mythology. This fresco shows that if government is virtuous and rules justly, then the city thrives and prospers. There is text along the lower edge of the wall that reads: \\"Turn your eyes to behold her, you who are governing, who is portrayed here [Justice], crowned on account of her excellence, who always renders to everyone his due. Look how many goods derive from her and how sweet and peaceful is that life of the city where is preserved this virtue who outshines any other. She guards and defends those who honor her, and nourishes and feeds them. From her light is both requiting those who do good and giving due punishment to the wicked.\\"\\"Sienese Followers of Duccio: Amrogio and Pietro Lorenzetti\\" = Peaceful Country = The fresco then blends effortlessly into Peaceful Country. The transition is made by an entourage passing through the city gate and out to the countryside beyond city walls. The new scene shows a bird's-eye view of the Tuscan countryside, with villas, castles, plowed farmlands, and peasants and farmers leisurely going about their bucolic responsibilities. The landscape is particularized, and with characteristics that indicate a specific place and environment. The winged allegorical figure of Security hovers above the landscape holding an unfurled scroll promising safety to all who live under the rule of law. Written on the scroll is the text: ‚ÄúWithout fear every many may travel freely and each may till and sow, so long as this commune shall maintain this lady [Justice] sovereign, for she has stripped the wicked of all power.‚Äù = Cosmic allegories = In the fresco cycle Lorenzetti expresses the idea that the cause of peace lays not only from the effects of good government, but also from the citizens acting in ‚Äúaccord[ance] with the temporal and astral force that governs‚Äù them.Burke, Suzanne Maureen, Ambrogio Lorenzetti's Sala della Pace: Its Historiography and \\"Sensus Astrologicus\\", Ph.D. diss., New York University, 1994 Lorenzetti expresses this idea in part with the border along the three frescos, which display medallions featuring the personifications of the planets as well as the seasons. Above the mural depicting The Effects of Good Government, these medallions follow the natural order of the seasons and alignment of the planets. In The Effects of Good Government, Lorenzetti shows the citizens completing the different labors for each of these months. The labors belonging to spring and summer are very clear; ‚Äúfishing and tending to the vines (March), cultivation of the soil and planting (April), riding (May), ploughing and stock rising (June), cereal harvesting (July), threshing (August), and hunting (September)‚Äù. The labors of winter and fall are also found, but they do not follow the normal conventions of the time for depicting these labors. With these depictions of the labors following with the seasons and planets, Lorenzetti creates the idea that peace is in part possible due to the citizens following in accordance to the planets and seasons. It is also hypothesized that with the depictions of citizens in different labors, Lorenzetti shows the allegorical manifestations of the children of the different planets. Upon closer analysis it is clear that Lorenzetti depicted the children that would help ensure peace, versus those that would be disruptive of it. This can be seen with the emphasis of mercantile activities which were believed to be Mercury's children. For the children of Venus, Lorenzetti chose to show a bride, weavers, and dancers, instead of depicting her more carnal children. The children of Mars, which all depend on the use of weapons, are represented by knights and guards. Saturn's children are represented by ploughmen, diggers and threshers, and excludes his other children, such as cripples. Jupiter's children are represented as hunters. With Lorenzetti emphasizing the children who would ensure peace, he drove home the importance of following activities to foster peace and not disrupt it. With both the depiction of the monthly labors and the planets' children, Lorenzetti shows the importance of performing the appropriate tasks in accordance to nature to ensure peace. This point is made stronger by the fact that half the seasons and plants are shown depicted over the scene of war, reminding the viewer the faulty error of not acting in accordance. = Venus and the dancers = Dancers in Effects of Good Government The ten dancers featured in the middle of The Effects of Good Government fresco are the subject of many discussions. It is believed that they are the representation of Venus's children. It was believed in Lorenzetti's day that there were two manifestations of Venus. These two sides found their forms in either the legitimate planetary deity, or as the nude goddess born of the sea. When looking at the depictions of the personifications of the other planets along the fresco borders, we see that they are seen placed in both their houses. Venus on the other hand is only placed in Taurus, her daytime house. With this careful choice, Lorenzetti legitimizes her side as a planetary goddess. This is further enforced with her modest dress, instead of being depicted nude. Her children then in turn gain the representation of chastity, matrimonial love, friendship, and sociability, all aspects that flourish during daylight hours. The movement of their dancing mimics the arm movements of Venus, and this in combination with their larger scale, creates and draw emphasis to the resounding message that peace in the city must be found in conjecture with the movements of the Heavens. = Perspective = When examining The Effects of Good Government, the viewer is aware of the use of a skewed perspective. The cityscape and the figures‚Äô scale, as well as the perspective, do not seem to follow a rational scheme. There have been two hypothesizes put forward to explain this departure from a more traditional use of perspective. One hypothesis that has been formulated is that the skewed perspective comes from the fact that the mural derives its perspective from a center directly in front of the figure of Tyranny on the opposite wall. The perspective then in the depiction of good government radiates from this center, making use of a more radial perspective. The second and more popular hypothesis puts forward is the idea that the perspective is derived from the gaze line of Justice. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that whereas the other virtues sit in an upright position, looking either into space or discreetly at each other, Justice's line of gaze is directed across to the corner of the room. To further support this idea photographs have been taken following her line of sight, and with these photographs the buildings and figures fall into a correct perspective. Further evidence to provide backing to this idea comes with an examination of the science of optics of the time in Siena. In the time of Lorenzetti, the belief was that sight was not only the act of seeing, but of understanding as well. The word for vision meant both to see and the image that the mind created. The word light also had dual meaning, describing ‚Äúboth physical and spiritual illumination‚Äù. When the viewer is placed into the mindset and understanding of a Sienese citizen of the day, it strengthens the argument that the perspective is from that of Justice, as her gaze then creates and illuminates this peaceful scene. = Disagreements within location = The frescoes of The Effects of Good Government seem to hold one strong point of debate. Whereas some scholars strongly believe that the city depicted is supposed to represent Siena, others believe that it is supposed to be more of metaphor for the city. For both of these arguments scholars take their stance from evidence they find within the fresco. Some scholars take the depiction of the bell tower and the cathedral with its dome to show that this is indeed Siena. They argue that these are depictions of actual standing Sienese buildings. Others yet look to the right of the countryside depiction to the small scene of the port, which includes the name \\"Telamon\\". This inscription is very small, indeed the depiction of the port itself is small. Still though scholars look to this as proof that this scene is meant to accurately depict Siena. Other scholars look to the gate, as well as other buildings, pointing out the severe differences and departures between the fresco and reality. This evidence to them points to the fact that Lorenzetti meant to depict an ideal city, one that the comparison to Siena could not be missed, but was not to be mistaken for Siena.  The Effects of Bad Government  Detail of Effects of Bad Government Lorenzetti's The Effects of Bad Government fresco has not been written on as extensively as The Effects of Good Government, partly due to the worse condition of this fresco. The wall on which the fresco of The Effects of Bad Government is depicted used to be an exterior wall, so has suffered much moisture damage in the past. When the viewer turns to examine this mural, they are confronted with a devious looking figure adorned with horns and fangs, and appearing to be cross-eyed. This figure is identified as Tyrammides (Tyranny), who sits enthroned, resting his feet upon a goat (symbolic of luxury) while holding a dagger. Below the tyrant the captive figure of Justice lies bound, while the figures of Cruelty, Deceit, Fraud, Fury, Division, and War flank him, and above him float the figures of Avarice, Pride, and Vainglory. These figures, according to an advice book for city magistrates of the time, were considered to be the ‚Äúleading enemies of human life‚Äù. The planets of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars preside over this scene, as they were the less favorable planets; also included are tyrannical figures such as the Roman Emperor Nero. When we look at the scene of the city itself, it appears to be very jarring; nothing fits as it should be. This is in part to the fact that Lorenzetti presented the scene in such a manner that the viewer must read it right to left, automatically creating a sense of discomfort. When we look at the scene, we see that the city is in ruin, windows are wide open, houses are being demolished, and businesses are nonexistent, except that of the armourer. The streets are deserted, and the country side shows two armies advancing towards each other. The whole scene shows the mirror opposite of that of The Effects of Good Government, creating a powerful reminder to the council.  Notes   References  * Jollingsworth, Mary. Art in World History.

In 2014, after Republicans regained majority in New Hampshire House of Representatives, O'Brien ran for Speaker, but lost to fellow Republican Shawn Jasper. Biography O'Brien obtained his bachelor's degree in history in 1974, a law degree in 1977, and received an LL.M. in Intellectual Property in 2003. He has served as Chair of the NH Republican Party Platform Committee, Vice-Chair of the Granite State Taxpayers, and Co- Chair of the House Republican Alliance. He is a past member of the Mont Vernon School Board and the Mont Vernon Police Advisory Commission. He has contributed to a couple of Democratic candidates over a decade ago and since then has contributed to the Republican campaigns and candidates, such as the NH Republican Committee (06/14/06, 05/24/07), John McCain (09/07/08), Republican National Committee (09/15/08), Robert Giuda (07/13/09 & 03/15/10), and Ovide Lamontagne (03/31/10).Campaign Contribution Search O'Brien is a member of the New Hampshire Bar and the Massachusetts Bar, former Executive Director of the New Hampshire Legal Rights Foundation,New Hampshire Legal Rights Foundation and a former equity partner at Finneran, Byrne, Drechsler & O'Brien (Massachusetts). Additionally, he was a professor of law at the New England School of Law and General Counsel of several companies. In 2013, O'Brien and his wife, Roxanne, have been married for 40 years and have three grown children. Controversy over closing NH House Gallery O'Brien temporarily closed the New Hampshire House gallery to the public during a debate about the state budget on March 31, 2011, after union protestors in the gallery began yelling \\"shame on you\\" and \\"don't harass the middle class\\" and thus prevented debate from being heard. O'Brien then closed the proceedings to the entire public, including a police officer and two former NH lawmakers. When asked why he closed the proceedings, O'Brien responded \\"I think thugs will not rule New Hampshire.\\"Concord Monitor, 1 April 2011 O'Brien recessed the House for 10 minutes to allow state police time to clear the gallery.Associated Press ‚Äì March 31, 2011 12:45 PM ET Assistant Democratic Leader Gary Richardson of Hopkinton asked O'Brien to allow the public back in. Richardson cited a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution, which states, \\"The doors of the galleries . . . shall be kept open to all persons who behave decently.\\" O'Brien refused. The House then voted 217‚Äì146 to keep the proceedings closed, with 48 Republicans joining the Democrats in opposing the closing. According to attorney Paul Twomey, O'Brien decided to re-open the proceedings shortly after he called to notify O'Brien's office that he would be filing a lawsuit on behalf of the former lawmakers. O'Brien's staff said that the call had nothing to do with the decision, however. O'Brien claimed that the proceedings were not conducted secretly, since they were streamed on live video and the press was present. \\"The House of Representatives has the right to conduct itself with decorum without being interrupted by members of the public,\\" O'Brien said. Richardson responded, \\"The Constitution doesn't talk about streaming video. [It says] the doors of the gallery should be kept open.\\" In Merrimack County Superior Court, Judge Richard McNamara heard arguments about closing the gallery and was told that it was open again. He did not issue an order warning O'Brien not to close the gallery again and the case was dismissed against the Democratic plaintiffs, who chose not to contest or appeal the dismissal.Nashua Telegraph 31 March 2011 Controversy about college student voting requirement Remarks by O'Brien to a Tea Party related group ‚Äì explaining that a reason for a proposed law imposing more rigorous voter ID and residency requirements to be able to vote in New Hampshire elections, is that college students dominate certain local elections and \\"take away a town's ability to govern itself\\" and are \\"foolish, voting as a liberal\\" because they lack \\"life experience\\" ‚Äì were widely reported in March 2011. O'Brien said the bill was \\"necessary to stop students from basically doing what I did when I was a kid: voting as a liberal.\\" Controversy over the Affordable Care Act and slavery In August 2013, O'Brien spoke at a rally in New Hampshire of the Americans for Prosperity, a conservative political advocacy group, where he likened the Affordable Care Act to an 1850 pro- slavery federal law.Ballhaus, Rebecca. \\"Explaining ‚ÄòFugitive Slave Act‚Äô Claim Highlighted by Obama\\", Washington Wire, September 28, 2013 In his remarks O'Brien called the healthcare act, popularly known as Obamacare, \\"a law as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 that allowed slave owners to come to New Hampshire and seize African Americans and use the federal courts to take them back‚Ä¶to slave states.\\" He later defended this characterization in an interview in the Wall Street Journal. President Obama referred to O'Brien's remark in a September 26, 2013 speech on the Affordable Care Act at Prince George's Community College in Largo, Maryland, saying \\"You had a state representative somewhere say that it's as destructive to personal and individual liberty as the Fugitive Slave Act. Think about that. Affordable health care is worse than a law that lets slave owners get their runaway slaves back.\\" Post-Speakership After Republicans lost control of the House, O'Brien did not run for a leadership position or seek to serve on a committee. Instead, he transitioned towards running for New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district against Democratic Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster in the 2014 elections. However, in August 2013, he announced that he would not run. Instead, he became COO of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based U.S. subsidiary of the German software company Brainloop. In 2014, Republicans regained the House of Representatives. O'Brien ran for Speaker of the House, but lost to Shawn Jasper. O'Brien is now the President/CEO of technology company RegDOX Solutions and a Principal and co- founder of Liberty Tree Consulting & Strategies.

The paintings depict human faces in profile made up from different animals or objects. Air is represented by birds, Fire by burning wood and cannons, Earth by land animals and Water by marine creatures. The series attempts to express the creation of harmony from chaos by the careful arrangement of the wild animals to form portraits whilst also praising Maximilian by suggesting that he is a ruler who controls even the four primal elements. File:Arcimboldo Air (copy).jpgAir, ca. 1566, (copy), private collection File:Giuseppe Arcimboldo Fire Kunsthistorisches Museum.jpgFire, Oil on Wood, 1566, Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna File:Arcimboldo Earth.jpgEarth, possibly 1566, private collection, Austria File:Arcimboldowater.jpgWater, 1566, Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna Historical Background After training in Milan, Arcimboldo became the court painter for the Habsburgs, to Ferdinand I at the court in Vienna and later, to Maximilian II and his son Rudolf II at the court in Prague. Giuseppe gained knowledge of exotic and local animals because at the time Prague was a cultural center and exotic creatures such as the lion and elephant were brought there from all over the world. Description Air displays a cornucopia of small birds that combine to create a slender male face. The majority of the birds are only partially visible which allow the artist to create the face and hair. The body is formed by a peacock; the goatee is a tail of a pheasant, and a duck forms the eyelids. The eagle and peacock are references to the Habsburg dynasty. Giuseppe included this reference to please his patrons and form a permanent bond between the painting and the Habsburgs. Unlike the others, Fire is formed from inanimate objects. Flint and steel form the nose and ear. Burning wood creates a crown of glowing hair. Arcimboldo uses guns to create the main part of the body. Fire has the most references to the Habsburg dynasty. The Order of the Golden Fleece hangs in front of the body, which is a reference to the most important knightly order of the time. The double headed eagle, a symbol of the Holy Roman Empire, sits proudly on the torso. The two large cannons refer to the strength of the Habsburg armies in their ongoing war with the Turks. Earth is perhaps the most skilfully blended piece the land animals curving together to create a strong, thick face. Antlered creatures surround the head, forming a crown. An elephant creates the cheek and ear while a wolf eating a mouse forms the eyelid and pupil. A full cow represents the neck. Like its siblings, the lion and the fleece are references to the Habsburg dynasty. Water features the most realistic depictions. A chaotic mess of sea creatures create a woman's face. Her breast plate is a crab, turtle and lobster along with an octopus on her shoulder. The animals that make up her head are obscure but a clear crown is formed by the spines on the back of a fish and long pieces of coral. Almost seeming out of place, a pearl necklace lies across her neck framing her face and completing the pattern of order from confusion. She also wears a pearl earring. This series is analogous to another of Arcimboldo's sets called The Four Seasons. Both series have the same number of pieces, and logically correspond to each other; Air to Spring, Fire to Summer, Earth to Autumn and Water to Winter. This pairing creates linked themes of chaos brought into harmony and the glorification of the Habsburg dynasty.

It is the location of the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve, Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge, and Border Field State Park. The estuary is a shallow water habitat. Often termed an intermittent estuary since its volume is subject to the discharge controlled by the seasons of the year, the volume of the estuary fluctuates and at times there is dry land, or flooded areas. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1973. Ecology The estuary is one of the few remaining salt marshes on the South Coast. Its location positions it under the path of the Pacific Flyway, where it serves as a stopover point. It is the largest remaining natural coastal area between Santa Barbara, California and San Quint√≠n, Baja California. Three times the size of Central Park, the estuary covers about 2,500 acres. Many species of migratory and native species rely on the estuary as an essential breeding, feeding, and nesting habitat. The estuary lies within the southernmost part of San Diego County within the city limits of the South Bay city of Imperial Beach. Prior to 1994, foot traffic by illegal immigration was a major source of top soil erosion. After 1994, off- road vehicle usage for policing has become a major cause of soil loss. Beginning in 2010, a re-vegetation effort along the Border Infrastructure System has occurred.

The Bermuda Flying School operated on Darrell's Island from 1940 to 1942. It trained Bermudian volunteers as pilots for the Royal Air Force and the Fleet Air Arm. During the First World War, roughly twenty Bermudians had entered the Royal Flying Corps and its successor, the Royal Air Force (RAF), as aviators and many others as groundcrew.POTSI (archived) ISLANDERS IN THE ROYAL FLYING CORPS AND THE ROYAL AIR FORCE DURING THE GREAT WAR, and CANADIAN EQUIVALENTS Other than aircraft on visiting ships, there were no aircraft based in Bermuda 'til after the war, when returning military aviators, Majors Hal Kitchener (son of the late governor, Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Walter Kitchener, and nephew of Field Marshal Earl Kitchener) and Hemming, created a small company offering local flights in sea planes operating from Hinson's Island. In 1936, Imperial Airways built an air station on Darrell's Island. This operated as a staging point on scheduled trans-Atlantic flights by flying boats of Imperial Airways and Pan American. At the time, no land planes could operate from Bermuda, there being no airfields. With the start of the Second World War, the RAF in Bermuda took over Darrell's Island for use by RAF Transport Command and RAF Ferry Command.The Flying Boats Of Bermuda, by Colin A. Pomeroy. Printlink Ltd., P.O. Box 937, Hamilton, HMDX, Bermuda. . Although the Royal Navy had a dockyard in Bermuda (which included an air station, RNAS Boaz Island (HMS Malabar) for flying boats), and Canadian and American naval and airbases would be established during the war, the only local units were the part-time army units, the Bermuda Militia Artillery (BMA), Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (BVRC), Bermuda Volunteer Engineers (BVE), the Bermuda Militia Infantry (BMI), and Home Guard. These, along with a regular army detachment of infantry at Prospect Camp, formed the Bermuda Garrison, tasked with defending the various facilities of importance to the war effort. Although a contingent from the BVRC, with attachments from the other units, was sent to join the Lincolnshire Regiment in England in 1940, no further drafts were allowed to be sent for fear of weakening the defences. By 1943, this was no longer a concern and the moratorium was lifted. It was decided to create a flying school on Darrell's Island to train local pilots for the Air Ministry in Britain, which would assign them to the RAF or the Fleet Air Arm. The school was in operation by the summer of 1940. It operated a pair of Luscombe sea planes,POTSI (archived): BERMUDA FLYING SCHOOL, 1940‚Äì1942 paid for by an American resident of Bermuda, Mr Bertram Work, and a Canadian, Mr Duncan MacMartin. The school was under the command of Major Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC, who had served as a fighter pilot during the First World War. Between the wars, he had returned to Bermuda and became the Commanding Officer of the BVE, a position he would maintain throughout the Second World War. The chief flying instructor was an American, Captain Ed Stafford. The first class, of eighteen students, was in training by May 1940. On 4 June, Fenton Trimmingham became the first student to solo. Ten Bermudian companies agreed in June 1940, to defray the expenses of ten of the students. Those companies were the Bank of Bermuda, the Bank of N.T. Butterfield, Trimmingham Bros., H.A. & E. Smith, Gosling Bros., Pearman Watlington & Company, the Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO), Bermuda Fire & Marine Insurance Company, the Bermuda Telephone Company (TELCO), and Edmund Gibbons.The Bermudian, Hamilton, Bermuda. July 1940.Salute to Bermudian war hero Geoffrey Osborn: He was taught at Bermuda Flying School and went on to fly many bombing raids with the RAF. By Dr. Jack Garstang. The Bermuda Sun. Wednesday, 22 June, 2011 RAF Darrell's Island, the location of the Bermuda Flying School. The BFS only accepted applicants who were already serving in one of the part-time units, which had been mobilised for the duration of the war. Successful students were released from their units and allowed to proceed overseas. With the moratorium against sending drafts overseas, this meant local soldiers came to see the BFS as the easiest way of reaching sharper ends of the war. Although the local units were allowed to send drafts overseas in 1943, the preceding state of affairs meant that a disproportionately high number of aviators appears on the list of Bermuda's war dead (ten out of thirty-five). In fact, the first Bermudian killed in the war was Flying Officer Grant Ede, DFC, a fighter pilot killed in the Battle of Norway in 1940 (although Ede had joined the RAF in England before the war). By 1942, the Air Ministry had a glut of trained pilots. This had resulted from the fear created by the Blitz, and the Battle of Britain, when the RAF had assumed pre-eminence in Britain's defence against a feared Axis invasion. Desperate for pilots, too many had been allowed to train, or had been placed on backlists to await slots for induction and training. This would continue to be a problem as late as 1944, when the British Army was forced to disband a division after Operation Overlord due to a shortage of manpower. At the same time, the Air Ministry had the equivalent of a division of civilians waiting aircrew training slots, and already had more aircrew than it had aircraft available for them to man. This would lead to pilots being transferred to the Army's Glider Pilot Regiment, and to the lists of civilians reserved for aircrew training being cleared of men who were then able to be conscripted by the Army. In Bermuda, the excess of pilots meant that the BFS was advised in 1942 that no further pilots were required. By then, eighty pilots had been sent to the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. THE BFS was included in the Empire Air Training Scheme. Its graduates included eight Americans, who had volunteered for the RAF in the US, and had then been sent to the BFS for training. Although the school was closed, Bertram Work and Major Montgomery-Moore oversaw the conversion of its administration into a recruiting arm, the Bermuda Flying Committee, for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), sending sixty aircrew candidates to that service before the War's end. Sixteen Bermudian women were also sent to the RCAF to perform roles including Air Traffic Controller.That's My Bloody Plane, by Major Cecil Montgomery- Moore, DFC, and Peter Kilduff. 1975. The Pequot Press, Chester, Connecticut. . Flying instructor Captain Stafford moved to RAF Transport Command, and was later shot down, becoming a prisoner-of-war in Germany. He was piloting a Catalina on a flight from Darrell's Island to Largs in Scotland, on 7 April 1943. Nearing Britain, the crew were advised by radio to divert to RAF Mountbatten, near Plymouth, due to bad weather. Evidently due to a navigational error, they found themselves over occupied France and were shot down near Land√©da, Brittany, by anti-aircraft artillery and two Luftwaffe fighters. The first officer was killed outright, and the navigator wounded. Stafford succeeded in landing the aeroplane two miles offshore, still under fire. Three, including Stafford, were pulled from the water by French fisherman. The bodies of two other crewmen washed up two days later, and the third three weeks later. As a POW, Captain Stafford headed a team of Allied orderlies in a wing of the Hohemark hospital, in Hesse, which was dedicated to the care of Prisoners of War from the Dulag Luft POW Camp in Oberusel (which was to become Camp King of the United States Army after the war).St Bees Dead of World War II.

Painted around 510 BCE in the red figure pottery style, the Revelers vase was found in an Etruscan tomb in Vulci, Italy. The painting is attributed to Euthymides. Although the vase is in the amphora shape, its purpose is more decorative than functional. The painting itself shows three nude partygoers and Hector arming on the reverse. The work is remarkable because of the early use of foreshortening (3/4 views) as opposed to conventional profile and frontal views. The Revelers Vase currently resides in the Staatliche Antikensammlungen in M√ºnich, Germany. History The Revelers Vase, although of Greek origin, was discovered in an Etruscan tomb in Vulci, Italy. This discovery is evidence of the strong interaction between the Greek and Etruscan cultures. The earliest Greek colonies known in Italy date from around 800 BCE near the present day Bay of Naples.Taylor, David. \\"Ischia.\\" Around Naples Encyclopedia. University of Maryland Italian Studies, 7 Mar. 2011. Web. 10 Mar. 2011. . Since the 7th century BCE, the Etruscans were in contact with these Greek colonies, and became avid patrons of Greek art. It is due in part to this interaction between the Etruscans and the Greeks that Greek styles of figure design and architecture were transferred into the artistic canon of Rome. The vase Euthymides and his contemporaries were known as the ‚ÄúPioneers‚Äù because of their work with the newly discovered red figure style. The Revelers Vase, then, is a product of the early forays into working with red figure technique. Created in the amphora shape, the Revelers Vase was likely created in Athens, the home of Euthymides, and purchased by an Etruscan noble. It was created for aesthetic rather than functional purposes. Approximately 2 feet tall, the black vase is decorated with ‚Äúred‚Äú floral and geometric motifs on the handles and at the base. These motifs also serve as a frame to the main subject of the work, the three nude revelers. The men have been drinking. The left-most reveler holds a Kanatharos, a Greek drinking vessel, and the two outer revelers are dancing merrily. The figures, however, are linked together only by the subject, not by any plot or narrative. It is more likely that the artist created this as a study of various poses of the human figure. On the reverse of the Revelers Vase is a depiction of a scene from Homer‚Äôs Iliad. The Trojan prince Hector is shown donning his armor before combat. He is watched by his parents, Priam and Hecuba. Greek mythology and party scenes were popular subjects for painting at this time. The reverse of the Revelers vase: Hector dons his armor as his parents Priam and Hecuba watch. Artistic importance What is notable about the vase is not the subject matter, but rather the way in which it is depicted. Breaking the traditionally rigid frontal postures of contemporary Archaic statues and paintings, the revelers are in dynamic, overlapping postures.Richter, Gisela Marie Augusta. \\"Early Style.\\" Attic Red-figured Vases. New Haven: Yale UP, 1958. 55. Print. The two outer figures stand in active stances, with their legs and hands in motion. As does the middle figure shown in a standing position, with his front to the viewer and his head is looking down over his left breast, as his hands are busy adjusting his armor. The use of foreshortening, although primitive, gives the entire composition a more natural and believable feel. It is perhaps the use of this relatively untried technique that led Euthymides to write on his vase ‚ÄúAs never Euphronios [could do!]‚ÄùGardner, Helen, and Fred S.

It will determine if the patient has an underlying rotator cuff dysfunction. Procedure The patient is asked to either sit on an examination table or stand while performing this test. Examiner should be standing on the patient's lateral side or behind the arm being evaluated. Examiner will passively abduct the patient's shoulder (humerus) to 90 degrees. The patient is then asked to slowly lower or adduct the shoulder to their side. If the patient is unable to perform this motion, the examiner can hold the humerus at 90 degrees of abduction and apply slight pressure to the distal forearm. If the patient's arm falls to their side, this also indicates a rotator cuff dysfunction. Inability to controllably lower the arm can indicate a rotator cuff dysfunction, most commonly the supraspinatus. Mechanism The drop arm test works by subluxing the humeral head looking for a tear or weakness in the supraspinatous tendon. Results A positive test is found if the patient cannot perform this motion of adducting the arm back to the body controllably or if the patient experiences pain while performing this test.

Symptoms should be reproduced if there is a problem with the supraspinatus or biceps brachii. This test is also associated with the Hawkin‚Äôs Test and Jobe‚Äôs Test. Procedure The patient is asked to sit on the examination table or to stand next to it with arms in internal rotation. Examiner should stand on the side which is being tested. Examiner will place one hand on the patient's scapula, and the other hand on the patient's arm below the elbow. The examiner will passively flex the shoulder forward. Mechanism When performing the Neer Impingement Test, the elbow should be extended, humerus in internal rotation and the forearm pronated. When the examiner is passively flexing the arm forward it is causing compression of the structures between the greater tuberosity, inferior acromion process and the acromioclavicular joint. Results A positive test is indicated by pain in the anterior or lateral shoulder when in full flexion. It is indicative of problems involving the supraspinatus and the long head of the biceps brachii tendons. The examiner needs to be aware of a false positive test which is due to the patient having limited forward flexion. History The Neer Impingement test was created by Doctor Neer in 1972 based on what he observed as he performed shoulder operations. He noted that there was a significant degeneration in the supraspinatus tendon. He found that when the arm was in flexion and internal rotation that it compressed on the tendons under the acromioclavicular joint.

Churchill, 511 U.S. 661 (1994), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning the First Amendment rights of public employees in the workplace. By a 7‚Äì2 margin the justices held that it was not necessary to determine what a nurse at a public hospital had actually said while criticizing a supervisor's staffing practices to coworkers, as long as the hospital had formed a reasonable belief as to the content of her remarks and reasonably believed that they could be disruptive to its operations. They vacated a Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in her favor, and ordered the case remanded to district court to determine instead if the nurse had been fired for the speech or other reasons, per the Court's ruling two decades prior in Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle. The case had first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, a nurse in the obstetrics ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated by the city of Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had been talking with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about what she had said, she was fired. There were four separate opinions. Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for a four-justice plurality that the government has a lower obligation to respect constitutional rights when it acts as employer rather than as the sovereign. Accordingly, in that situation it should not be required to meet a due process standard greater than the reasonableness of its own finding of fact. David Souter added a short concurring opinion qualifying the plurality, which he said was in fact a majority,Waters v. Churchill, , 685‚Äì86, (1994), Souter, J., concurring. with his insistence that in such cases the government must demonstrate that its understanding of what the employee said was not only a reasonable belief but a truthful one. Antonin Scalia concurred as well, but harshly criticized O'Connor's opinion. He read it as requiring a procedural handling of every possible adverse personnel action where First Amendment rights might be implicated, providing \\"more questions than answers\\". John Paul Stevens' dissent argued that the First Amendment required that the lower court determine exactly what Churchill had said before ruling on whether it was protected. Outside commentators have also been critical of the decision, since it might discourage whistleblowers. In addition to echoing Stevens' concerns, they have seen it as abandoning any concern for the truth, imposing a heavy burden on a plaintiff, relying on an overly narrow conception of the public's interest, and possibly discouraging people from entering public service. The decision resulted in a lower court changing its ruling in a high-profile case involving controversial academic Leonard Jeffries.  Dispute  Churchill had been hired as a part-time nurse at McDonough in 1982, and promoted to full-time status three years later. She worked for the next two years in the obstetrics ward. She had generally received favorable performance evaluations until Waters became her supervisor in the middle of 1986.Churchill v. Waters, 977 F.2d 1114, 1115, (7th Cir., 1992) That happened a few months after Kathy Davis took over as the hospital's vice president of nursing. Waters had been implementing Davis's policy of cross-training, under which nurses were in areas overstaffed on a particular shift were reassigned to departments that needed more nurses. Churchill was one of several employees who had voiced objections to the way the policy was being implemented. She and other critics feared that it was primarily being used to address staffing shortages without providing adequate training, with detrimental effects on patient care.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1116‚Äì17 Churchill's criticisms had been long voiced by one of the hospital's obstetricians, Dr. Thomas Koch. During a 1982 malpractice suit he had blamed a stillbirth on nursing shortages created, he alleged, by hospital policies, and had continued the criticism since then. Churchill and he became friends and allies, with her providing inside information on nursing policies that he then used to criticize the administration. She believed this incurred her the enmity of administrators who were by summer of 1986 keeping a file of criticisms of Koch made by Davis and nursing supervisor Cindy Waters.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1117 That August, an incident occurred that bore out Churchill and Koch's concerns, and began the sequence of events that led to the lawsuit. During a difficult delivery, Koch called for a \\"Code pink\\" emergency, indicating danger to the life of mother and/or child. A probationary nurse, Mary Lou Ballew, did not know how to properly signal the emergency and did not alert all the necessary personnel. Churchill responded and helped Koch prepare for an emergency Cesarean section.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1118Churchill v. Waters, 731 F.Supp 311, 312‚Äì313 (C.D. Ill., 1990) After the surgery, Churchill was completing paperwork in the delivery room when Waters looked in on a patient in the early stages of labor Churchill had been attending to across the hall. She ordered Churchill to check on that patient. Churchill responded \\"You don't need to tell me what to do\\", and then complied with the order. Koch was very upset by this interference. At a meeting the next day with Waters and Stephen Hopper, the hospital's president and chief executive officer, he criticized Waters' conduct and the effect of the cross-training policies. Churchill was later given a written warning for insubordination; she chose not to either make a written response or file a grievance, which she had the right to do, as she \\"did not want to make mountains out of molehills\\". Waters' annual evaluation of Churchill was overall positive, but noted an increasing antipathy toward her.Churchill, 731 F.Supp at 313. In January 1987, a cross-trainee, Melanie Perkins-Graham, mentioned to Churchill over dinner during a meal break, with Koch present, that she was considering transferring to obstetrics. The exact nature of the ensuing conversation was central to the ensuing dispute. Since the break room was located immediately behind the main nurse's station in obstetrics, others overheard all or part of it. Ballew, whose work-related absences from the nurses' station limited her exposure to the conversation, and head nurse Jean Welty, were among them. The next morning Ballew told Davis that Churchill had spent 20 minutes \\"knocking the department\\" and specifically criticizing Waters and Davis, saying the former was trying to get her fired and the latter \\"was going to ruin this hospital\\". After the conversation, Ballew claimed, Perkins-Graham was no longer interested in transferring.Waters, 511 U.S. at 665, O'Connor, J. The morning afterwards, Davis asked Perkins-Graham to tell her about the conversation. Perkins-Graham told her that Churchill \\"had indeed said unkind and inappropriate negative things about Cindy Waters\\" and confirmed the complaints about the ward and the criticism of Davis. Davis decided to fire Churchill for what she considered continued insubordination, but did not do so until after she had consulted with Waters, Hopper and the hospital's personnel director. Churchill appealed to Hopper, her only recourse under the hospital's employee policy, but after a meeting with her and the personnel director he told her that the negative evaluation the month before counted as a second written warning and thus her termination had followed the proper process.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1119 Churchill took her case to federal court. Her suit in the Central District of Illinois in Peoria named Waters, Davis, Hopper and the hospital as defendants. She alleged violations of her First Amendment right to free speech and Fourteenth Amendment right to due process under Section 1983, and breach of contract under Illinois law.Churchill, 731 F.Supp at 312. No trial was actually held. After all witnesses had been deposed, Judge Michael M. Mihm considered motions for summary judgement, granting them for the defense. Churchill appealed, and won a reversal. Lower courts = District court = In a deposition, Churchill gave her version of the break room conversation she had had with Perkins-Graham that had led to her dismissal. She had repeated her earlier criticisms, which were not of cross-training in itself but merely the way Davis had implemented it. A specific concern of hers was the hospital's requirement that obstetric nurses who had reassigned to another department shower and change before returning to obstetrics, in an apparent effort to circumvent a regulatory requirement that nurses assigned to obstetrics remain there for an entire shift or not return if they were temporarily assigned elsewhere.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1121 As to whether her comments about Waters had been as continuous and negative as Perkins-Graham and Ballew had asserted, Churchill testified that she had not had a problem with Waters and felt she could have a good working relationship with her. Welty, the chief shift nurse on duty that night, who had overheard most of the conversation from the nearby nurses' station, corroborated Churchill's version. She further recalled that Perkins-Graham had said she had only one reservation about transferring to obstetrics‚ÄîWaters. Churchill, Welty testified, had actually defended Waters, saying she had a difficult job and was sometimes moody, but that could be accommodated.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1124 After the depositions had been taken and briefs filed, the defendants moved for summary judgement. Judge Michael M. Mihm granted it on all but the First Amendment claim. Much of his opinion, handed down in early 1990, consisted of a lengthy explication of Illinois case law on contract formation as it applied to language in the hospital's employee handbook. He held that it did not constitute a firm offer of continued employment and thus could not be considered a contract Churchill had become party to by continuing to work once aware of its terms. Since there was no contract to breach, there could be no denial of due process rights. He could not grant summary judgement on the First Amendment claim since there was a factual dispute in that area, and ordered a status conference to be held the next month with a magistrate.Churchill, 731 F.Supp at 315‚Äì22. Churchill then moved for summary judgement on the remaining claim, arguing that she had been fired without a determination that she had been engaging in protected speech on a matter of public concern, and that her rights to freedom of association with Dr. Koch had also been abridged, in violation of her due process rights. The defendants cross-moved for the same, arguing failure to state a claim on the free- association claim. They denied she had been engaging in protected speech, and that even if it were, she would still have been fired for undermining the hospital administration. Mihm found Churchill's speech \\"inherently disruptive\\". Echoing Perkins-Graham's description of it as a \\"bitch session\\", and noting \\"history of hostility between Churchill and her supervisors\\",Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1125. he found she intended \\"not to inform but rather to gripe.\\" He entered judgement for the defendants.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1119‚Äì20. = Appeal = Churchill then appealed Mihm's ruling to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Koch, whom she married in 1991, joined the case as an appellant, arguing that Waters, Davis and Hopper had tried to have his privileges revoked as retaliation for his role in the incident. A three- judge panel of Richard Dickson Cudahy, John Louis Coffey and Daniel Anthony Manion heard the case in February 1992. Eight months later, they ruled in favor of Churchill. Coffey's opinion considered three issues: whether the district court had properly found Churchill's criticisms of Waters, Davis and cross-training did not touch on a matter of public concern, whether the appellants' failure to determine that before firing her had been a due process violation and whether they were entitled to qualified immunity from the suit since they argued there was no settled law on the subject.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1120 To resolve the first issue, he turned to the relevant case law on the subject. In 1968's Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court had overturned the firing of an Illinois high-school teacher for writing a letter to the editor in a local newspaper critical of the school board's handling of a recent tax increase. That case had established that public employees had First Amendment rights to \\"comment on matters of public interest in connection with the operations of the public [entity] in which they work.\\"Pickering v. Board of Education, , 568 (1968), Marshall, J. A decade later, Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District had extended that protection to an employee speaking privately to a superior about such issues.Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District, . The most important precedent for Churchill's case was 1983's Connick v. Myers, where the Court had upheld the dismissal of an assistant district attorney who had circulated questionnaires among her coworkers about office policy and named superiors in the wake of a transfer she had resisted. In that case the deciding issue had been that the questionnaire had largely concerned matters of personal, not public, concern.Connick v. Myers, . Coffey quoted that case's holding that courts \\"must determine the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\\"Connick, 461 U.S. at 147‚Äì48, White, J. Circuit precedent, from shortly after Connick, held that the content of the speech was the most important of those three.Yoggerst v. Hedges, 739 F.2d 293, 296 (7th Cir., 1984), (\\"While Connick mandates that we examine the content, form, and context of speech to determine whether, as a matter of law, it can be characterized as speech on a matter of public concern, we believe that the content factor is most important in making this determination.\\") cited in Berg v. Hunter, 854 F.2d 238, 243 (7th Cir., 1988), (\\"This court also has recognized that content is the greatest single factor in the Connick inquiry\\"), cited at Churchill, 1121. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the appeals court could not make a determination as to the content of the disputed speech.Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), cited at Churchill, 977 F.2d 1120. Instead, Coffey wrote, it would rule on the status of Churchill's speech, reviewing the record and considering it in the light most favorable to her, as the party in opposition to the motion for summary judgement. \\"It is evident that the District Court's grant of summary judgment was in error,\\" wrote Coffey. In her deposition, Churchill had discussed at length her criticisms of how cross-training had been implemented, and her concerns that the policy requiring a shower and change of clothes for nurses returning to the obstetric ward from another department was a possible violation of state regulations. \\"She was undoubtedly speaking about a matter of public concern\\", the judge concluded. He chastised the hospital for its apparent violations, quoting from and discussing at length the standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations on cross-training to demonstrate that this was a matter of public concern. \\"[T]he content of the speech is a question of fact for the jury,\\" Coffey concluded.Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1121‚Äì24 Coffey turned next to the context, addressing Mihm's holding that under the Pickering balancing test, the hospital was permitted to fire Churchill because her speech was sufficiently disruptive to it even if it had been on a matter of public concern. It was erroneous, he wrote, because it ignored Jean Welty's testimony that had corroborated Churchill's account of the conversation. Further, she had professional obligations to act under the code of the American Nursing Association, which Coffey quoted in relevant part. \\"Cheryl Churchill's actions fall far short of the actions of an insubordinate or problem employee\\", he wrote. \\"[Her] interest in fulfilling her duties and obligations as an ethical, responsible professional ... clearly outweighs the hospital's interests in interfering and ultimately preventing her from speaking out on important matters of public concern.\\" Further, the animosity between Churchill and her superiors was, upon further examination, \\"nothing but a one sided demonstration of hostility toward Churchill.\\" The next argument Coffey considered was due process. The Mt. HealthyMt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, . defense raised by the hospital was that Churchill had not demonstrated that her speech was why she was fired. In response she had argued that the hospital violated her due process rights by not investigating the actual content of her speech. \\"We disagree\\" wrote Coffey, \\"that it is necessary to create a First Amendment due process right in order to protect the rights of public employees to speak out on matters of public concern, for we believe that Mt. Healthy provides adequate safeguards regardless of whether the employer actually knew the precise content of the statements for which it fired the employee.\\"Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1126 The hospital believed it had overcome Mt. Healthy, since it claimed Churchill was fired for her general pattern of complaining rather than the conversation with Perkins-Graham. Coffey said that was a misreading of that holding, which was meant to protect conduct. Lastly, he dismissed the defendants' claim to qualified immunity, under which officials who engage in conduct which may later be found illegal are immune from prosecution or suit if they can demonstrate a lack of settled law on it at the time, for the same underlying reasons. \\"[I]n 1987 the law was clear that the speech of public employees while at work was protected under the First Amendment if it was about matters of public concern in connection with their workplace,\\" Coffey wrote. \\"[W]e hold that ignorance of the nature of the employee's speech (in particular in light of the record before us) is inadequate to insulate officials from a ¬ß 1983 action.\\"Churchill, 977 F.2d at 1128 The court amended its decision the day after handing it down. Two months later a motion for rehearing was denied. The appellees then petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. In order to resolve a conflict the case had created with similar cases in other appellate circuits where qualified immunity was at issue,Atcherson v. Siebenmann, 605 F. 2d 1058, (8th Cir., 1979), judge granted qualified immunity when acting as administrator disciplining probation officer for letter alleging misconduct by coworkers; Wulf v. Wichita , 883 F. 2d 842 (10th Cir., 1989), reasonable police chief should have been aware that allegations of anti-union bias were protected speech; and Sims v. Metropolitan Dade County, 972 F. 2d 1230 (11th Cir., 1992), county officials should have been reasonably aware that off-duty sermon by employee in church was protected speech. the Court granted the request in 1993.. Supreme Court = Before the Court = The federal government filed an amicus curiae brief urging reversal, along with the International City/County Management Association. Amici urging affirmance came from the National Education Association and Southern States Police Benevolent Association. The National Employment Lawyers Association (NELA) filed an amicus brief on behalf of Petitioners, Waters, et al.. In it, NELA‚Äôs counsel of record argued, inter alia, that the firing of a public employee for uttering speech subjectively deemed by a public employer to be deemed ‚Äúinsubordinate‚Äù is an unconstitutionally vague and overbroad employment of the employees First Amendment rights.https://www.academia.edu/5544411/US_Supreme_Court_Amicus_Brief_by_Charles_E._Tucker_Jr._Attorney_of_Record_for_the_National_Employment_Law_Association_NELA_- _Waters_v._Churchill_No._92-1450_511_U.S._661_1994_Waters, 511 U.S. at 663‚Äì64. Oral arguments were heard in December 1993. Lawrence Manson, arguing for the hospital and other original defendants as petitioners, was joined by assistant Solicitor General Richard Seamon. John Bisbee, who had represented Churchill and Koch from the beginning, argued their case. Manson began by attacking the Seventh Circuit's \\"unprecedented holding\\". Churchill, he argued, had to show that the defendants were aware that her speech was protected. \\"[A]ll the defendants knew about was comments of personal matters, grievances against the supervisor.\\" He quoted at length from Ballew's deposition to support that contention. If Churchill had wanted to contest the veracity of Ballew's report, she had the opportunity to do so when Davis fired her, but chose not to do so. The justices challenged him at length on the implications of that theory, whether it would apply to a more clear-cut situation where the employer had acted on mistaken information. Manson insisted that under the Mt. Healthy rule that would not be a violation of the First Amendment. He also insisted that it covered a case where the motive for the firing was clearly the speech and not any other associated conduct. Seamon, too, was questioned on this as well, with the same result. \\"[I]n an employment at will situation like this one, the Government can discharge an employee for any reason or no reason at all, as long as it is not motivated by a desire to retaliate against the employee for engaging in protected speech.\\" Bisbee was asked the same question, but preferred to focus on the facts of his case. He stressed that \\"[w]hat was reported to them was basically a headline: 'Things were bad in OB and the administration was responsible.'\\" Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked about the Pickering test: \\"Do you think that even protected speech could also serve to demonstrate sufficient disruption to the employer's operation that a firing could be justified?\\" Bisbee conceded that it could, but \\"it seems to me there has got to be some reasonable basis for thinking that the speech was doing that.\\" How, he was later asked, could the Seventh Circuit's holding that an employer could be held liable for adverse action against speech believed to be unprotected but later held otherwise be reconciled with qualified immunity? \\"Number one, I disagree with that,\\" he said. \\"Unfortunately that's the question cert was granted on\\", came the reply. Bisbee insisted that the record did not support that reading, that it was merely a dictum and that he himself had not so argued. When pressed about this again later, some sharp exchanges resulted. Bisbee said \\"the Court doesn't even really need to reach that question\\". \\"Suppose we think we need to reach that decision\\" he was told. \\"[W]e didn't take this case to determine who said what in the cafeteria. We determine this case to see what the rule of law ought to be if an employer acts on reasonable, substantiated information, but is wrong.\\" Bisbee suggested that the Seventh Circuit had perhaps used \\"language that was broader than it needed to\\", to which O'Connor responded that it might need to be sent back since even he declined to defend their legal theory. \\"It seems to me that you can affirm the judgment and say that the legal test employed by the Seventh Circuit was not altogether correct,\\" he proposed. = Decision = The Court announced its decision May 31, 1994. Seven justices had agreed to vacate the Seventh Circuit and remand the case to district court for a determination of what exactly Churchill was fired for. Three justices joined Sandra Day O'Connor in a plurality opinion. David Souter, a member of that plurality, added a concurrence of his own. Antonin Scalia wrote a separate concurrence, joined by two other justices. John Paul Stevens wrote for himself and Harry Blackmun that the First Amendment was important enough that Churchill was entitled to the trial she sought to determine what she said.  Majority  The plurality, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, held that the appeals court had proposed a test too onerous to the government to be broadly applied, but agreed that there was enough of a factual dispute over what Churchill had been fired for to remand the case to district court for that determination. Souter added a concurrence clarifying that the employers can act against unprotected employee speech when they believe their facts about the speech to be true, rather than just the result of a reasonable investigation. He also noted that, since the plurality holding had been joined by the other majority justices in one aspect and the dissenting justices in another, it was in fact a majority opinion. In a separate concurrence, Antonin Scalia wrote for himself, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy that adverse personnel actions for speech by public employees violate the First Amendment only when their purpose is clearly retaliatory, as he believed it had been in Pickering. He attacked the plurality opinion as creating a poorly defined procedural requirement that might well prove unworkable in practice. = Plurality opinion = \\"There is no dispute in this case about when speech by a government employee is protected by the First Amendment,\\" began O'Connor's analysis, after she recounted the facts of the case. \\"The dispute is over how the factual basis for applying the test‚Äîwhat the speech was, in what tone it was delivered, what the listener's reactions were‚Äîis to be determined.\\" She agreed with Churchill that some reliable procedures were necessary to protect First Amendment rights, and cited several cases that imposed such procedural requirements, primarily in the area of defamation law.Waters, 511 U.S. at 668‚Äì69. O'Connor rejected the narrower protection Scalia advocated in his concurrence. \\"Speech can be chilled and punished by administrative action as much as by judicial processes; in no case have we asserted or even implied the contrary.\\" To the plurality, however, it did not follow that all possible procedural review was constitutionally necessary. The Court had in some past defamation cases declined to apply the actual malice standard, even though doing so would strengthen free-speech protections, she noted.Waters, 511 U.S. at 669‚Äì70. It was, O'Connor agreed with Scalia, inconvenient that no general test existed for these cases. So, \\"[w]e must therefore reconcile ourselves to answering the question on a case- by-case basis, at least until some workable general rule emerges.\\" The general principle, from Pickering and previous cases had established that \\"the government as employer indeed has far broader powers than does the government as sovereign\\". No one, she suggested, would dispute that a government agency could bar its employees from wearing, on the job, clothing decorated with profanity, despite the Court's Cohen v. California holding that such behavior could not sustain a prosecution for disorderly conduct.Cohen v. California, . The Court had also upheld the Hatch Act's limitations on political activity by federal employees on several occasions, she noted.Waters, 511 U.S. at 671‚Äì73.Broadrick v. Oklahoma, ; United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, and United Public Workers v. Mitchell, . Those past cases, O'Connor continued, had shown deference to the government's opinion of what speech acts by employees in the workplace would be disruptive to the government's interest in providing public services efficiently, again in ways the Court had not with cases concerning speech in general. The Seventh Circuit's requirement \\"would force the government employer to come to its factual conclusions through procedures that substantially mirror the evidentiary rules used in court\\", O'Connor wrote. Hearsay evidence might not be usable, and credibility judgements might not be shared by a jury or judge. Yet both were regularly used by both public and private employers in making personnel decisions. \\"Government employers should be allowed to use [them], without fear that these differences will lead to liability.\\"Waters, 511 U.S. at 676‚Äì77. What O'Connor did allow was that the public employer's decision must be the result of \\"the care that a reasonable manager would use before making an employment decision\\". She again responded to Scalia, who had said precedent made that standard applicable only where the employment had some sort of contractual basis and was not at-will or probationary. \\"We believe that the possibility of inadvertently punishing someone for exercising her First Amendment rights makes such care necessary.\\" She then addressed Stevens' claim in dissent that this was less protection than the Court had required for lesser rights. \\"We have never held that it is a violation of the Constitution for a government employer to discharge an employee based on substantively incorrect information. Where an employee has a property interest in her job, the only protection we have found the Constitution gives her is a right to adequate procedure.\\"Waters, 511 U.S. at 678‚Äì79. Applying this analysis to the facts of the case, she concluded that hospital management had made a reasonable decision of what Churchill had said before firing her. And what they believed Churchill to have said, under Connick, was disruptive enough to justify adverse action regardless of whether it addressed a public concern, which the plurality declined to decide. \\"Discouraging people from coming to work for a department certainly qualifies as disruption.\\" Perkins-Graham herself had told Davis she didn't think the hospital could \\"tolerate that kind of negativism\\" much longer, and if Churchill had indeed denied the possibility of getting along with Waters, Churchill's continued effectiveness as a nurse under Waters' supervision could be reasonably expected to be diminished.Waters, 511 U.S. at 680‚Äì81. Despite this, O'Connor agreed with Churchill and the Seventh Circuit that Mihm had erred in granting summary judgement against the nurse. \\"[She] has produced enough evidence to create a material issue of disputed fact about petitioners' actual motivation.\\" It was possible that a trier of fact could find, in certain other actions by the hospital management, evidence that her non- disruptive, and therefore protected, criticisms of the implementation of the cross-training policy. That conclusion foreclosed the need to decide the qualified immunity question that had been discussed so heavily at oral argument. The Seventh Circuit's decision was vacated and the case remanded to district court to decide what action of Churchill's had motivated the firing.Waters, 511 U.S. at 681‚Äì82. = Souter concurrence = David Souter, one of the four justices in the plurality, added his own concurrence. He wished \\"to emphasize that, in order to avoid liability, the public employer must not only reasonably investigate the third-party report, but must also actually believe it.\\" Without that criterion, he argued, the government \\"can assert no legitimate interest strong enough to justify chilling protected expression.\\" That left it open for Churchill to argue on remand that the putatively disruptive speech issue was merely a pretext for an unjustified, retaliatory firing over her criticisms of the cross-training implementation.Waters, 511 U.S. at 682‚Äì85, Souter, J., concurring. He also clarified that the plurality's holding was the one lower courts should look to in future cases, per the standard for divided majority opinions announced in the 1977 obscenity case Marks v. United States.Marks v. United States, , 193‚Äì194, Powell, J. Seven justices agreed that public employers who acted on a reasonable belief of the content of employee speech had met their constitutional burden, and the plurality and dissent both supported a view that public employers who did not had violated the First Amendment. Therefore, the plurality was in fact a majority with its components joined by different justices. = Scalia concurrence = \\"This recognition\\", Scalia began, \\"of a broad new First Amendment procedural right is in my view unprecedented, superfluous to the decision in the present case, unnecessary for protection of public-employee speech on matters of public concern, and unpredictable in its application and consequences.\\" He agreed that sometimes procedures were necessary to protect First Amendment rights. Most of the cases the plurality had cited were from defamation law, which was primarily enforced through litigation, thus making procedural safeguards a necessary subject of discussion.Waters, 511 U.S. at 686‚Äì87, Scalia, J., concurring. \\"Although we are assured that 'not every procedure that may safeguard protected speech is constitutionally mandated,' the implication of that assurance is that many are'\\" Scalia continued. The plurality had provided little guidance in that area. He could not reconcile this due-process requirement with other casesScalia specifically cites Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, , in this regard. where the Court had ruled that at-will public employees, lacking a property interest in their jobs, were not entitled to this level of process in adverse personnel actions. He found it absurd that there was no need to investigate if the dismissal was for other causes, whether erroneously believed or not., But if speech was involved, the matter would have to be investigated, after which an adverse action could proceed, even if the investigation had produced inaccurate information about the content of the speech, as long as it did not touch on matters of public concern. Scalia argued that the plurality had not created new procedural protections for the First Amendment, \\"but rather new First Amendment rights\\". Pickering had held that public employees must be free to speak on issues of public concern without fear of retaliation, and he considered that the important factor. \\"A category of employee speech is certainly not being 'retaliated against' if it is no more and no less subject to being mistaken for a disciplinable infraction than is any other category of speech or conduct.\\" He found the procedural test \\"doubly irrelevant\\" since not only had the plurality found the hospital to have satisfied it, they then remanded the case so the district court could conduct a trial on whether the speech was a pretext for a retaliatory firing. Since that had been the end result of Mt. Healthy he found no need for a new requirement in this case, and cited other areas where the Court had found a pretext inquiry sufficient to protect constitutional rights.Waters, 511 U.S. at 689‚Äì91. In response to Stevens' dissent, he said such an inquiry had been held constitutionally inadequate only where there was a contractual relationship, which Churchill did not have. \\"An employee dismissable at will can be fired on the basis of an erroneous factual judgment, with no legal recourse‚Äîwhich is what happened here.\\" Her only protection was the Pickering holding that she could not be retaliated against, and the plurality was not so much reinforcing that as expanding it to cover employer mistakes.Waters, 511 U.S. at 691‚Äì92. The plurality opinion \\"provides more questions than answers, subjecting public employers to intolerable legal uncertainty\\", Scalia concluded. He went through all the hypothetical questions they would have to ask under the decision, and possible remedies that might be derived from it due to the lack of guidance on the question. \\"Loose ends are the inevitable consequence of judicial invention\\", he wrote. \\"We will spend decades trying to improvise the limits of this new First Amendment procedure that is unmentioned in text and unformed by tradition.\\"Waters, 511 U.S. at 692‚Äì94.  Dissent  For private-sector employees, Stevens wrote, the exercise of their First Amendment rights to speak on matters of public concern \\"may entail unpleasant consequences.\\" But public employees were entitled to greater protections. \\"As long as that expression is not unduly disruptive, it simply may not provide the basis for discipline or termination.\\"Waters, 511 U.S. at 694‚Äì95, Stevens, J., dissenting. Stevens believed there was no real factual dispute as to the basis of Churchill's termination‚Äîthe dinner-break conversation. The Court had to assume it was protected speech, per procedure,Waters, 511 U.S. at 695, note 1. but the plurality had concluded that what mattered was that the hospital reasonably believed it was not. \\"This conclusion is erroneous because it provides less protection for a fundamental constitutional right than the law ordinarily provides for less exalted rights, including contractual and statutory rights applicable in the private sector.\\" Waters, 511 U.S. at 695. Had Churchill been a contractual employee, fired in the mistaken belief that she had failed to perform her job adequately, she would have been entitled to relief, he noted. \\"Ordinarily, when someone acts to another person's detriment based upon a factual judgment, the actor assumes the risk that an impartial adjudicator may come to a different conclusion\\". The Court, he noted, had done just that in National Labor Relations Board v. Burnup & Sims, Inc.,NLRB v. Burnup & Sims, Inc., . when it upheld the board's order to reinstate two workers fired in the mistaken belief that they had threatened violence if a union certification vote failed.Waters, 511 U.S. at 696, note 2. Stevens criticized Scalia's approach as derived solely from the use of the word \\"retaliation\\" in the cases Scalia had cited. In all those cases, there had been no factual dispute over the content of the speech. Two, Pickering and Perry v. SindermannPerry v. Sindermann, , 598, (1972), Stewart, J. suggested that a \\"causal connection between the employee's speech and her discharge is all the 'retaliation' that must be shown.\\"Waters, 511 U.S. at 697, note 4. Stevens saw the issue in very stark terms. Since disagreements were among employees inevitable, the plurality's rule \\"invites discipline, rather than further discussion, when such disputes arise.\\" In conclusion, he said, the First Amendment \\"requires that, before firing a public employee for her speech, management get its facts straight.\\"Waters, 511 U.S. at 698‚Äì99.  Subsequent jurisprudence  The next term, in United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, a 6‚Äì3 Court held unconstitutional Section 501(b) of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 (), which barred all federal employees from accepting compensation for making speeches or writing for publication.United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, . Stevens, writing for the majority, distinguished the case from Waters and its predecessors by noting that it involved a broadly applied instance of prior restraint instead of a disciplinary action against a single employee for actual speech.Treasury Employees, 513 U.S. at 466‚Äì67, Stevens, J. Following Waters he found the government's predictions of disruption if the statute were overturned unwarranted.Treasury Employees, 513 U.S. at 473‚Äì76. O'Connor wrote a separate concurrence noting that this case was an instance of the limits on deference to the government as employer she had recognized in Waters. \\"As the magnitude of intrusion on employees' interests rises, so does the Government's burden of justification ... In this case ... the Government has exceeded the limits of its latitude\\".Treasury Employees, 513 U.S. at 480‚Äì85, O'Connor, J. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for the dissenters, argued that the majority overemphasized the Waters test at the expense of the balancing of individual and government interests required by Pickering.Treasury Employees, 513 U.S. at 489‚Äì501, Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting. =Heffernan v. City of Paterson= While the Court heard other cases concerning the First Amendment rights of public employees, it would not revisit Waters until Heffernan v. City of Paterson in 2016. There, a New Jersey police detective sued his employer after he was demoted to patrol work due to a mistaken belief that he was supporting an opposing candidate in the city's mayoral election. \\"In Waters, the employer reasonably but mistakenly thought the employee had not engaged in protected speech,\\" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote, distinguishing the two cases. \\"Here, the employer mistakenly thought the employee had ....\\" (slip op. at 5-6) Since, in Waters, the Court had concluded that the employer's intent was what mattered, Breyer argued Heffernan should be decided the same way. \\"In law, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,\\" he wrote. Breyer and five other justices held for Heffernan that his discipline violated constitutional rights he had not exercised. = Appeals courts = Waters has also been cited many times by lower courts. At the appellate level, there have been several notable cases where it has factored into the analysis, sometimes helping to decide the case, and in others allowing judges to develop aspects of the holding in greater depth. Two cases concerned academic freedom and political correctness. Others involved same-sex marriage and satanic ritual abuse.  Academic freedom cases  = Jeffries v. Harleston = The Waters decision had an immediate effect on a case arising from an academic controversy in New York. Following a 1991 speech making assertions that Jews sponsored the slave trade and controlled the media, Leonard Jeffries, chairman of the African-American studies department at the City College of New York (CCNY), was terminated from the chairmanship prior to the end of his three- year term by the City University of New York (CUNY) trustees although he retained his professorship. CUNY administrators claimed they did so for other reasons unrelated to the speech. He sued, was awarded damages, and the Second Circuit upheld the verdict in 1993.Jeffries v. Harleston et al, 21 F.3d 1328, (2nd Cir., 1994). After Waters, the university petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. The Supreme Court told the Second Circuit to reconsider the case in light of that holding. In 1995, the Second Circuit reversed its original ruling, finding that under Waters the College could have reasonably considered Jeffries' speech disruptive enough to justify adverse action. Judge Joseph M. McLaughlin interpreted Waters to hold, relevant to the Jeffries case, \\"that the closer the employee's speech reflects on matters of public concern, the greater must be the employer's showing that the speech is likely to be disruptive before it may be punished\\".Jeffries v. Harleston et al, 52 F.3d 9, 13, (2nd Cir., 1995) The first appellate decision had held that the university had failed to show actual disruption to its operations by the speech. \\"Waters pulls a crucial support column out from under our earlier Jeffries opinion\\", McLaughlin wrote, by lowering the requirement to demonstrate only the likelihood. Since the jury had found that a majority of the CUNY trustees voted to end his chairmanship for that reason, his First Amendment rights had not been abridged. McLaughlin also rejected an argument in an amicus brief that Jeffries' academic freedom deserved greater protection than Churchill's, since he was tenured and retained his professorship.Jeffries, 52 F.3d at 13‚Äì15. = Burnham v. Ianni = In fall 1991 two students in the History Club at the University of Minnesota Duluth had the idea to photograph professors in the history department with props that represented their specialties for a display near the department offices. Albert Burnham, the club's advisor and a specialist in American military history, wore a coonskin cap while brandishing a .45-caliber military pistol. Ronald Marchese, who specialized in classical antiquity, was photographed with an ancient Roman sword and laurel wreath. A month after the display was installed, the university's chancellor, Lawrence Ianni, ordered the two photographs removed after complaints from female administrators and faculty, some of whom had been targeted by an anonymous public harassment campaign that year over Ianni's establishment of a Commission on Women. The professors and students sued, and won partial summary judgement holding that Ianni did not have qualified immunity.Burnham v. Ianni, 899 F.Supp. 395 (D.Minn., 1995). The defendants cited Waters, but Judge Michael J. Davis ruled that it was not relevant since the case did not involve an adverse employment action.Burnham, 899 F.Supp. at 400. The Eighth Circuit reversed on appeal.Burnham v. Ianni, 98 F.3d 1007 (8th Cir., 1996). Theodore McMillian relied on Waters to give weight to the chancellor's fears of disruption in light of the harassment campaign, noting that \\"It cannot seriously be disputed that, during that spring 1992 semester, the atmosphere on campus was more tense than normal.\\"Burnham, 98 F.3d at 1016. Clarence Arlen Beam rejected that analysis in his dissent, saying those fears were \\"based on conclusory hearsay and rank speculation\\".Burnham, 98 F.3d. at 1023. An en banc rehearing in turn reversed that panel. Beam reiterated his arguments in the majority opinion.Burnham v. Ianni, 119 F.3d 668, (8th Cir., 1997). McMillian, dissenting along with John R. Gibson, who had joined him in the original panel, wrote that the majority had understated the effect of the harassment on the campus in assessing the potential for disruption. Despite the lack of adverse action, it was \\"no less an employment-related case\\" than Waters and its related cases, he argued.Burnham, 119 F.3d at 681‚Äì83. Ianni, who they felt had qualified immunity in any event due to the lack of settled law where academic freedom was concerned, had had to make a choice between two subordinates' conflicting interests. The messages conveyed by the photographs could clearly have been conveyed through other means, they observed.Burnham, 119 F.3d at 684‚Äì88.  Shahar v. Bowers  Waters was also part of the analysis employed in Shahar v. Bowers, an Eleventh Circuit case brought against Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers by a woman to whom he had withdrawn a job offer after learning of her plans for a lesbian wedding in 1991, saying it would reflect badly on his office in public opinion to have an employee whose lifestyle involved regularly violating Georgia law against sodomy. After Northern District of Georgia senior judge Richard Cameron Freeman granted Bowers summary judgement on her First and Fourteenth Amendment claims,Shahar v. Bowers, 836 F.Supp. 859, (N.D. Ga., 1993). she appealed. A three-judge panel agreed her right to intimate association had been violated and remanded to have that claim considered under a strict scrutiny standard.Shahar v. Bowers, 70 F.3d 1218, (11th Cir., 1995). In a partial concurrence with John Cooper Godbold's holding, Judge Phyllis A. Kravitch looked to Waters, then a new decision. Its lower constitutional standard for the government as employer led her to conclude that the Pickering balancing test should be applied to the intimate- association claim rather than strict scrutiny, as the district court had done. \\"[T]he employer's assessment of harm\\" she wrote, \\"should be discounted by the probability of its realization in order to weigh it fairly against an actual burden on an employee's constitutional rights.Shahar, 70 F.3d at 1230‚Äì34. This was in keeping with circuit precedent regarding Connick.Williams v. Roberts, 904 F.2d 634, 638 (11th Cir., 1990), cited at Shahar, 1233. A petition for rehearing en banc was granted in late 1995.Shahar v. Bowers, 70 F.3d 1218, (11th Cir., 1995). In writing for a majority that upheld the district court absolutely, Judge J.L. Edmondson applied the Pickering test as Kravitch had argued. He cited Waters as requiring \\"substantial weight\\" be given to the concerns of Bowers and his senior aides that Shahar's wedding ceremony would reflect adversely on his office and its ability to fulfill its duties. Therefore, they did not have to make \\"a particularized showing of interference with the provision of public services\\" as Shahar argued.Shahar v. Bowers, 114 F.3d 1097, 1106‚Äì1108, (11th Cir., 1997) en banc. Three of the four dissenting judges took up Waters. In a dissent joined by Godbold, Kravitch responded that while it did require great deference to public-employer concerns, neither did it require \\"that courts must accept blindly all claims of harm conjured by government employers\\" since they could evaluate whether they were reasonable or not. Shahar, she observed, wasn't claiming her marriage was a legally- recognized one, and had been discreetly held in another state with no media attention, which Bowers should have known before rescinding the job offer. Therefore, his adverse action was unreasonable and \\"his predictions regarding intra-office strife do not weigh very heavily in the balance.\\"Shahar, 114 F.3d at 1124‚Äì25. Judge Stanley Birch went even further in his dissent, also joined by Kravitch and Godbold. In the wake of the Supreme Court's Romer v. Evans holding that homosexuals as a class were entitled to at least some rights under the Equal Protection Clause, he argued that all of Bowers' fears of disruption under Waters ultimately arose from her status as a lesbian and were thus not a legitimate basis for state action..\\"Shahar, 114 F.3d at 1125‚Äì26. Rosemary Barkett accused the majority of using Waters to effect a \\"wholesale restructuring of Pickering\\". The only issue in Waters, she wrote, had been whether to decide the case on the basis of what the employer reasonably believed was said or what a jury found was said. Like Birch and Kravitch, she found that case supported Shahar's position, since she did not find Bowers' investigation reasonable. \\"Waters asserts Pickering's principles and reiterates the necessity for constitutionally enforced processes to protect the rights of government employees.\\"Shahar, 114 F.3d at 1129‚Äì30.  Wright v. Illinois Dept. of Children & Family Services  A few months after Waters was handed down, back in the Seventh Circuit, Judge Joel Martin Flaum made it part of a two-fold test with Connick in Wright v. Illinois Department of Children & Family Services, a complicated case in which a child-welfare worker accused her employer of retaliating against her after she complained it was covering up evidence of satanic ritual abuse she had found. He read it as making clear that \\"not every utterance by a public employee, even if entitled to First Amendment protection in another context, is constitutionally shielded from employer discipline.\\"Wright v. Illinois Department of Children & Family Services, 40 F.3d 1492, 1500 (7th Cir., 1994). As a result, the case considered only the speech for which the plaintiff had been disciplined, and held that in one instance the defendants would prevail if they showed their belief that she had perjured herself in court testimony was reasonable even if the testimony later was found to be truthful.Wright, 40 F.3d at 1506.A Tenth Circuit panel also considered this possibility in a later case (Deutsch v. Jordan, 618 F.3d 1093, 1102, note 3 (10th Cir., 2010)), but came to the conclusion it did not need to decide it for lack of jurisdiction. After an extensive analysis finding that truthful trial testimony was protected speech, which culminating in find a genuine factual dispute on the issue and thus overturning the summary judgement initially granted by the district court, Flaum echoed one of Scalia's criticisms in a footnote. \\"Waters provides little direct guidance as to the division of labor between judge and jury in a case like this one,\\" he observed. \\"The critical question that, to this point, remains unanswered requires an assessment of the defendants' subjective motivation, a classic jury issue.\\"Wright, 40 F.3d at 1506‚Äì07, note 6.  Other appellate cases  In 1999, the Second Circuit considered Lewis v. Cowen, a case in which the former director of the Connecticut Lottery claimed his dismissal for not speaking violated his First Amendment rights. The appellant was dismissed after refusing to prepare changes to the lottery he had privately expressed reservations about. Without any actual speech to apply the Pickering‚ÄìConnick tests to, Judge John Walker held that behavior fell under Waters since it adversely affected the lottery's operations. \\"In such a case, the agency may terminate the employee because a more compliant subordinate who agrees to publicly support and convey the agency's positions would allow the agency to do the job more effectively.\\"Lewis v. Cowen et al, 165 F.3d 154, 165 (2nd Cir., 1999). Waters forced the Third Circuit to no longer require that public employers show actual disruption.Watters v. Philadelphia, 55 F.3d 886, 896 (3rd Cir., 1995). In Watters v. Philadelphia, it overturned summary judgment against the administrator of a police department's employee assistance program who had told a local newspaper there was a \\"crisis\\" in the program due to the lack of key official policies, and been fired. \\"Disruption caused by actions independent of the speech at issue cannot be equated with disruption caused by the speech itself\\", wrote Dolores Korman Sloviter.Watters, 55 F.3d at 897. The Sixth Circuit found Waters very similar to a 2006 case it heard, Farhat v. Jopke.Farhat v. Jopke, 370 F.3d 580, (6th Cir., 2004) A Michigan school custodian fired after a long history of abusive communications with administrators and his union, which sometimes included threats of violence, was found to have engaged in unprotected speech. \\"[E]ven if portions of appellant's expression did address matters of public concern,\\" wrote William O. Bertelsman, \\"the disruptiveness of his speech in the workplace outweighed any value his expression might have had.\\"Farhat, 370 F.3d at 593‚Äì95. = Analysis and commentary = Advocates for public employees, particularly in education, were dismayed by Waters. \\"Incredibly, this decision seems to abandon truth as a criterion for decision making and substitutes for it a belief be it true or false as long as it was established by reasonable means\\" wrote George Madden of Montana State University Billings, echoing Scalia's complaint. He also felt the case raised privacy concerns not touched on in the opinion since Churchill and Perkins-Graham had apparently believed they could speak freely. However, Madden cautioned, this would depend on how lower courts interpreted the case. A.N. Moshirnia sees Waters as a further erosion, along with Mt. Healthy and Connick, of the rights of educators affirmed in Pickering, which \\"may have indicated the zenith of First Amendment protection for public employee speech.\\"Moshirnia, A.N.; 6 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J 314, 321; Boston University School of Law; 2007. After the later cases imposed some other barriers to a public-employee plaintiff, Waters, Moshirnia said, \\"dramatically reduced the government‚Äôs trial burden by permitting the government to justify its employment action with less than conclusive evidence.\\"6 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J at 322‚Äì28. He also thought it could be used for prior restraint since, in his analysis, a public employer could \\"fire an employee before he or she has spoken in cases where the government knows the general contours of the speech, and predicts that it might cause a disruption.6 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J at 330. Charles W. Hemingway, a Virginia federal employment lawyer, took up O'Connor's question about the unique nature of government employment that allows the lower constitutional obligation.Hemingway, Charles W.; \\" ; 44 Am. U. Law Rev. 2231, Washington College of Law, 1995,. Looking over older Supreme Court jurisprudence on the subject, he observed that \\"Employees who are appointed in the federal service act as agents of the sovereign and thereby accept both the powers and the obligations imposed on the sovereign itself. To enable our government to function properly and to promote the public good, federal employees must be under stricter authority of the sovereign than private citizen[s].\\" He found its source in the authority of the government over military personnel. While civilian employees enjoyed greater liberty than soldiers, the Court had ruled they were both under the same authority.Hemingway cites Butler v. Pennsylvania Canal Commission, ; United States v. Hartwell, and Blake v. United States, .44 Am U. Law Rev. at 2242. For most of the country's history, Hemingway wrote, federal employees were appointees, employed at will, with no legal recourse against adverse actions due to the federal government's sovereign immunity. That began to change in the late 19th century with the Pendleton Act. Over the course of the 20th century Congress expanded the protections of federal employees, to the point that by the 1990s they had the same legal recourse against discrimination as employees in the private sector, with five separate administrative agenciesThe Office of Personnel Management, Federal Labor Relations Authority, United States Merit Systems Protection Board, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Special Counsel. empowered to hear employee complaints and grant relief.44 Am U. Law Rev. at 2243‚Äì55. Those rights have come with restrictions private workers are not subject to. In the late 1930s Congress passed the Hatch Act, limiting political activity by federal employees, and it has been upheld by the Supreme Court on several occasions. Federal employees, though in some cases unionized, are also not allowed to strike, a restriction upheld by a district court.United Federation of Postal Clerks v. Blount, 325 F.Supp 879 (D.D.C., 1971). The 1978 Ethics in Government Act imposed other restrictions on federal employees that sometimes go beyond the term of their employment. Lastly, the federal government's sovereign immunity means it can only be sued where such actions are permitted by statute.44 Am U. Law Rev. at 2256‚Äì67. He reviewed actions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the administrative body that hears most claims by federal employees, and the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals from the MSPB and the other agencies, in light of Waters and United States v. National Treasury Employees Union. Recounting the differences between O'Connor and Scalia, he advised federal managers to follow O'Connor's approach pending later jurisprudence. \\"[I]t is clear that Waters expands federal employee due process rights while attempting to reserve for public managers the ultimate ability to determine whether public employee speech detracts from the Government's ability to perform its mission.44 Am U. Law Rev. at 2293‚Äì94.

This structure replaced the much smaller dugout owned by the Chapman family and used as a refuge in times of trouble (see Chapman's Dugout). The Chapman dugout was about a mile south of Fort Solomon. The new white settlers and the Indians in the area quickly developed a hostile relationship and many Indian raids followed. Fort Solomon was built on the east side of a reverse \\"S\\" shaped bend on the Solomon River. It was built on level ground and the west side was bordered by a deeply cut bank along the river. The view in all directions from the fort was good. Once completed in spring or summer 1864, the fort contained about twenty log houses arranged in a square and enclosed by a log stockade. About fourteen families lived inside the fort.Lavina G. Chapman, Short Stories of Pioneer Days (N.p.: ca. 1882), pp. 2, 6-9, 17-8 (from the Ottawa Co.

Accounts from those present at the completed fort all vary, so it is not possible to determine the exact layout of Fort Solomon. A store may have operated from one of the log cabins. The fort contained a well and a schoolhouse, although there is disagreement as to the school's location. The fort had at least three gated entrances. A dugout was within the walls of the fort. It was well protected, being five feet deep and built of heavy timbers. The structure's walls and roof were covered with two or three feet of earth. It may have had gun ports. While the fort was being constructed, the Solomon Valley Militia was organized, attracting about thirty men. They were armed with aging guns and a small cannon, probably a mountain howitzer. All or most of the weapons came from Fort Riley.Chapman, pp. 9, 11-2, 17-8; \\"C. E. Hollingsworth Tells About Old Fort Solomon,\\" Minneapolis Messenger (Minneapolis, Kans.), Sept. 10, 1953, p. 1. From summer 1864 to spring 1865 most of the area's settlers lived inside the fort. The town of Lindsey, Kansas, grew just outside Fort Solomon, taking advantage of the protection provided by it. For a time Lindsey was the county seat of Ottawa County. By the late 1860s the Indian raids ceased and Fort Solomon was abandoned.

The book is a set of thirteen interrelated stories with a large set of characters all connected to Bennie Salazar, a record company executive, and his assistant, Sasha. The book centers on the mostly self-destructive characters, who, as they grow older, are sent in unforeseen, and sometimes unusual, directions by life. The stories shift back and forth in time from the 1970s to the present and into the near future. Many of the stories take place in and around New York City, although other settings include San Francisco, Italy, and Kenya. In addition to winning the Pulitzer Prize, the book also won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 2010. The novel received mostly positive reviews from critics and later appeared in many lists of the best fiction works of the 2010s. Collection or novel Because of its unusual narrative structure, some critics have characterized the book as a novel and others as a collection of linked short stories. A Visit from the Goon Squad has 13 chapters, which can be read as individual stories and which do not focus on any single central character or narrative arc. Many were originally published as short stories in magazines such as The New Yorker and Harper's Magazine. In an interview with Salon.com's Laura Miller, Egan said she leaned toward calling the book a novel rather than a short story collection. She has also said that she considers the book to be neither a story collection nor a novel. Stories * Found Objects ‚Äì Sasha, a young kleptomaniac, steals a woman's wallet while on a date with Alex.

Themes \\"Goon squads\\" were originally groups of violent thugs sent to assault workers who tried to form labor unions. Later the term \\"goon\\" came to refer more generally to any violent thug, and this is where the book draws its central metaphor. In one story, a character named Bosco declares: \\"Time's a goon, right?\\",(p. 109) referring to the way that time and fate cruelly rob most of the book's characters of their youth, innocence and success. As Bosco complains: \\"How did I go from being a rock star to being a fat fuck no one cares about?\\" Some of the book's characters do end up finding happiness, but it is always a limited happiness, and it is rarely in the form they sought. In an interview, Egan explained that \\"time is the stealth goon, the one you ignore because you are so busy worrying about the goons right in front of you.\\"\\"The Book on Aging Rockers\\", by Jane Ciabattari, The Daily Beast, June 29, 2010. Many of the book's characters work in the rock music business. Rock and roll, with its emphasis on youth culture, plays into the book's themes of aging and the loss of innocence. As Egan says, \\"my 9-year-old loves Lady Gaga and refers to Madonna as ‚Äòold school‚Äô. There's no way to avoid becoming part of the past.\\" Rock music was also central to the marketing push behind the book, although the actual text does not focus directly on musicians or music making. Egan said she knew rock and roll only as a consumer at the time she began writing the book and had to do a lot of research on the subject.A Conversation with JENNIFER EGAN , BBC Audiobooks America Egan said the story was inspired by two sources: Proust's In Search of Lost Time, and HBO's The Sopranos. It is a novel of memory and kinship, continuity and disconnection.\\"A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan ‚Äì review\\", Sarah Churchwell, The Guardian, March 13, 2011 Reception =Honors= The novel won both the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction. The Pulitzer Prize Board noted that the novel was an \\"inventive investigation of growing up and growing old in the digital age, displaying a big-hearted curiosity about cultural change at warp speed\\". =Critical reception= In commenting on her Pulitzer, NPR critic Jonathan Bastian noted that \\"Egan is one of the most recent and successful examples of a trend that has been steadily seeping into the world of contemporary literature.\\" The unusual format of the novel, taking place across multiple platforms, has led some critics to label the novel \\"post- postmodern\\". Many critics were impressed by Egan's experiments with structure, such as a section formatted like a PowerPoint printout. In 2019, The Guardian ranked A Visit from the Goon Squad as the 24th best book since 2000. It was third place (along with Colson Whitehead‚Äôs The Underground Railroad) in a Literary Hub list of the best books of the 2010s, one of the 10 books in Time‚Äôs list of the best fiction works of the 2010s, and first place in Entertainment Weekly's list concerning the same period, with Leah Greenblatt calling it \\"a book as rich and resonant as any linear classic in the canon.\\" Adaptation Two days after the Pulitzer Prize announcement, it was announced that a deal with HBO for a television series adaptation had been signed.\\"HBO Sets Pulitzer Prize Winner 'A Visit From The Goon Squad' For Series Treatment\\", Mike Flemming, April 20, 2011 However, after two years the proposal had been dropped.

The Grand Prix de Rome: Paintings from the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, 1797-1863. Washington, DC: International Exhibitions Foundation. p. 158. . In 1849 he completed his most famous work, Rouget de L'Isle Singing La Marseillaise, which now resides at the Mus√©e historique de Strasbourg. After experiences travelling with French troops through the Crimea, his themes took on military and nationalistic subjects. He later produced many military scenes during the siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Pils was appointed professor of painting at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1863 but left the same year for two years in Algeria. In 1868 he was elected to seat #14 of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts.

Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said, \\"In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan.\\" Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water. The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Many electrical generators ran out of fuel. The loss of electrical power halted cooling systems, causing heat to build up. The heat build-up caused the generation of hydrogen gas. Without ventilation, gas accumulated within the reactor containment structures and eventually exploded. Residents within a radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered ¬•15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions.

The Guardian. Retrieved on 3 April 2011. with its epicenter approximately east of the Oshika Peninsula of T≈çhoku, Japan, lasting approximately six minutes. The earthquake was initially reported as 7.9 Mw by the USGS before it was quickly upgraded to 8.8 Mw, then to 8.9 Mw, and then finally to 9.0 Mw. On 11 July 2016, the USGS further upgraded the earthquake to 9.1. Sendai was the nearest major city to the earthquake, from the epicenter; the earthquake occurred northeast of Tokyo. The main earthquake was preceded by a number of large foreshocks, with hundreds of aftershocks reported. One of the first major foreshocks was a 7.2 Mw event on 9 March, approximately from the epicenter of the 11 March earthquake, with another three on the same day in excess of 6.0 Mw. Following the main earthquake on 11 March, a 7.4 Mw aftershock was reported at 15:08 JST (6:06 UTC), succeeded by a 7.9 Mw at 15:15 JST (6:16 UTC) and a 7.7 Mw at 15:26 JST (6:26 UTC). Over eight hundred aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 Mw or greater have occurred since the initial quake, including one on 26 October 2013 (local time) of magnitude 7.1 Mw. Aftershocks follow Omori's law, which states that the rate of aftershocks declines with the reciprocal of the time since the main quake. The aftershocks will thus taper off in time, but could continue for years. =Geology= T≈çhoku earthquake and aftershocks from 11 to 14 March Hypocentral region boundaries (Source: The Japanese Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion) NOAA Animation This megathrust earthquake was a recurrence of the mechanism of the earlier 869 Sanriku earthquake, which has been estimated as having a magnitude of at least 8.4 Mw, which also created a large tsunami that inundated the Sendai plain. Three tsunami deposits have been identified within the Holocene sequence of the plain, all formed within the last 3,000 years, suggesting an 800 to 1,100 year recurrence interval for large tsunamigenic earthquakes. In 2001 it was reckoned that there was a high likelihood of a large tsunami hitting the Sendai plain as more than 1,100 years had then elapsed. In 2007, the probability of an earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.1‚Äì8.3 was estimated as 99% within the following 30 years. This earthquake occurred where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the plate beneath northern Honshu. The Pacific plate, which moves at a rate of 8 to 9 cm (3.1 to 3.5 in) per year, dips under Honshu's underlying plate, building large amounts of elastic energy. This motion pushes the upper plate down until the accumulated stress causes a seismic slip-rupture event. The break caused the sea floor to rise by several metres. A quake of this magnitude usually has a rupture length of at least and generally requires a long, relatively straight fault surface. Because the plate boundary and subduction zone in the area of the Honshu rupture is not very straight, it is unusual for the magnitude of its earthquake to exceed 8.5 Mw; the magnitude of this earthquake was a surprise to some seismologists. The hypocentral region of this earthquake extended from offshore Iwate Prefecture to offshore Ibaraki Prefecture. The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake may have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of and a width of . Analysis showed that this earthquake consisted of a set of three events. Other major earthquakes with tsunamis struck the Sanriku Coast region in 1896 and in 1933. The source area of this earthquake has a relatively high coupling coefficient surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5‚Äì0.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, it was estimated that the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260‚Äì880 years, which is consistent with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes in this area with magnitudes of about 7 since 1926 had only released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami. Most of the foreshocks are interplate earthquakes with thrust-type focal mechanisms. Both interplate and intraplate earthquakes appeared in the aftershocks offshore Sanriku coast with considerable proportions.\\"Spatial distribution and focal mechanisms of aftershocks of the 2011 off the Pacific coast of T≈çhoku Earthquake\\" by Y. Asano, T. Saito, Y. Ito, K. Shiomi, H. Hirose, T. Matsumoto, S. Aoi, S. Hori, and S. Sekiguchi. The strong ground motion registered at the maximum of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture. Three other prefectures‚ÄîFukushima, Ibaraki and Tochigi‚Äîrecorded an upper 6 on the JMA scale. Seismic stations in Iwate, Gunma, Saitama and Chiba Prefecture measured a lower 6, recording an upper 5 in Tokyo. In Russia, the main shock could be felt in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (MSK 4) and Kurilsk (MSK 4). The aftershock at 06:25 UTC could be felt in Yuzhno-Kurilsk (MSK 5) and Kurilsk (MSK 4). =Energy= Damage to the antenna of Tokyo Tower The surface energy of the seismic waves from the earthquake was calculated to be joules, which is nearly double that of the 9.1 Mw 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 230,000 people. If harnessed, the seismic energy from this earthquake would power a city the size of Los Angeles for an entire year. The seismic moment (M0), which represents a physical size for the event, was calculated by the USGS at 3.9√ó1022 joules, slightly less than the 2004 Indian Ocean quake. Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED) calculated a peak ground acceleration of 2.99 g (29.33 m/s2). The largest individual recording in Japan was 2.7 g, in Miyagi Prefecture, 75 km from the epicentre; the highest reading in the Tokyo metropolitan area was 0.16 g. =Geophysical effects= Portions of northeastern Japan shifted by as much as closer to North America, making some sections of Japan's landmass wider than before. Those areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts. A stretch of coastline dropped vertically by , allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land. One early estimate suggested that the Pacific plate may have moved westward by up to , and another early estimate put the amount of slippage at as much as 40 m (130 ft). On 6 April the Japanese coast guard said that the quake shifted the seabed near the epicenter and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture by . A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in Science on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved east-southeast and rose about as a result of the quake. The report also stated that the quake had caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area.Jiji Press, \\"March temblor shifted seabed by \\", Japan Times, 3 December 2011, p. 1. Soil liquefaction in K≈çt≈ç, Tokyo The Earth's axis shifted by estimates of between and . This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day, the tilt of the Earth, and the Chandler wobble. The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass. The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Because of conservation of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation. These are expected changes for an earthquake of this magnitude. The earthquake also generated infrasound waves detected by perturbations in the orbit of the GOCE satellite, which thus serendipitously became the first seismograph in orbit. Soil liquefaction was evident in areas of reclaimed land around Tokyo, particularly in Urayasu,Fukue, Natsuko, \\"Liquefaction driving away Chiba residents\\", Japan Times, 30 March 2012, p. 3.Fukue, Natsuko, \\"Urayasu still dealing with liquefaction\\", Japan Times, 8 April 2011, p. 4.

Nearby Haneda Airport, built mostly on reclaimed land, was not damaged. Odaiba also experienced liquefaction, but damage was minimal.Bloomberg L.P., \\"Tokyo Disneyland's parking lot shows the risk of reclaimed land\\", Japan Times, 24 March 2011, p. 3. Shinmoedake, a volcano in Kyushu, erupted three days after the earthquake. The volcano had previously erupted in January 2011; it is not known if the later eruption was linked to the earthquake. In Antarctica, the seismic waves from the earthquake were reported to have caused the Whillans Ice Stream to slip by about . Seismic intensity observations resulting from mainshock The first sign international researchers had that the earthquake caused such a dramatic change in the Earth's rotation came from the United States Geological Survey which monitors Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) stations across the world. The Survey team had several GPS monitors located near the scene of the earthquake. The GPS station located nearest the epicenter moved almost . This motivated government researchers to look into other ways the earthquake may have had large scale effects on the planet. Calculations at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory determined that the Earth's rotation was changed by the earthquake to the point where the days are now 1.8 microseconds shorter. =Aftershocks= Japan experienced over 1,000 aftershocks since the earthquake, with 80 registering over magnitude 6.0 Mw and several of which have been over magnitude 7.0 Mw. A magnitude 7.4 Mw at 15:08 (JST), 7.9 Mw at 15:15 and a 7.7 Mw quake at 15:26 all occurred on 11 March. A month later, a major aftershock struck offshore on 7 April with a magnitude of 7.1 Mw. Its epicenter was underwater, off the coast of Sendai. The Japan Meteorological Agency assigned a magnitude of 7.4 MJMA, while the U.S. Geological Survey lowered it to 7.1 Mw. At least four people were killed, and electricity was cut off across much of northern Japan including the loss of external power to Higashid≈çri Nuclear Power Plant and Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant.Fukushima Nuclear Accident Update Log, IAEA, 7 April 2011 NHK, \\"Strong aftershock kills four\\", 12 April 2011. Four days later on 11 April, another magnitude 7.1 Mw aftershock struck Fukushima, causing additional damage and killing a total of three people. On 7 December 2012 a large aftershock of magnitude 7.3 Mw caused a minor tsunami, and again on 26 October 2013 a small tsunami was recorded after a 7.1 Mw aftershock. As of 16 March 2012 aftershocks continued, totaling 1887 events over magnitude 4.0; a regularly updated map showing all shocks of magnitude 4.5 and above near or off the east coast of Honshu in the last seven days showed over 20 events. there had been 869 aftershocks of 5.0 Mw or greater, 118 of 6.0 Mw or greater, and 9 over 7.0 Mw as reported by the Japanese Meteorological Agency. The number of aftershocks was associated with decreased health across Japan. =Earthquake Warning System= One minute before the earthquake was felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system, which includes more than 1,000 seismometers in Japan, sent out warnings of impending strong shaking to millions. It is believed that the early warning by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) saved many lives. The warning for the general public was delivered about 8 seconds after the first P wave was detected, or about 31 seconds after the earthquake occurred. However, the estimated intensities were smaller than the actual ones in some places, especially in Kanto, Koshinetsu, and Northern T≈çhoku regions where the populace warning did not trigger. According to the JMA , reasons for the underestimation include a saturated magnitude scale when using maximum amplitude as input, failure to fully take into account the area of the hypocenter, and the initial amplitude of the earthquake being less than that which would be predicted by an empirical relationship.Âπ≤Â†¥ÂÖÖ‰πã (2011) ÁµåÈ®ìÂâá„Åã„Çâ„ÅÆ„Åö„Çå ‚Äï„ÅØ„Åò„ÇÅ„ÅÆÊï∞Áßí„Å®Âº∑ÈúáÂãïÔºöœÑc, PdÔºå„Çπ„Éö„ÇØ„Éà„É´ÔºåÁ∞°ÊòìÈúáÊ∫êÂüüÊé®ÂÆöÊñπÊ≥ï‚Äï Êó•Êú¨Âú∞ÁêÉÊÉëÊòüÁßëÂ≠¶ÈÄ£Âêà 2011Âπ¥ MIS036-P67Á∑äÊÄ•Âú∞ÈúáÈÄüÂ†±„Å®Ë¶≥Ê∏¨„Åï„Çå„ÅüÈúáÂ∫¶„ÅÆÁâπÂæ¥ JMA Êó•Êú¨Âú∞ÁêÉÊÉëÊòüÈÄ£Âêà 2011Âπ¥‰∫àÁ®øÈõÜ There were also cases where large differences between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning system and the actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes. Such discrepancies in the warning were attributed by the JMA to the system's inability to distinguish between two different earthquakes that happened at around same time, as well as to the reduced number of reporting seismometers due to power outages and connection fails. The system's software was subsequently modified to handle this kind of situation. Tsunami NOAA tsunami energy map An upthrust of along a wide seabed at offshore from the east coast of T≈çhokuNHK BS News reported 2011-04-03-02:55 JST resulted in a major tsunami that brought destruction along the Pacific coastline of Japan's northern islands. Thousands of lives were lost and entire towns were devastated. The tsunami propagated throughout the Pacific Ocean region reaching the entire Pacific coast of North and South America from Alaska to Chile. Warnings were issued and evacuations were carried out in many countries bordering the Pacific. Although the tsunami affected many of these places, the heights of the waves were minor. Chile's Pacific coast, one of the furthest from Japan at about away, was struck by waves high, compared with an estimated wave height of at Omoe peninsula, Miyako city, Japan. =Japan= The tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency was the most serious on its warning scale; it was rated as a \\"major tsunami\\", being at least high.Tsunami Warning System information, Japan Meteorological Agency The actual height prediction varied, the greatest being for Miyagi at high. The tsunami inundated a total area of approximately in Japan. DART Station, 690 NM southeast of Tokyo The earthquake took place at 14:46 JST (UTC 05:46) around from the nearest point on Japan's coastline, and initial estimates indicated the tsunami would have taken 10 to 30 minutes to reach the areas first affected, and then areas farther north and south based on the geography of the coastline.One estimate of 10‚Äì15 minutes came from German seismologist Rainer Kind of the Helmholtz Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, as interviewed in Japan's tsunami victims only had 15 minutes warning, Deutsche Welle, 12 March 2011.

According to a special committee on disaster prevention designated by the Japanese government, the tsunami protection policy had been intended to deal with only tsunamis that had been scientifically proved to occur repeatedly. The committee advised that future policy should be to protect against the highest possible tsunami. Because tsunami walls had been overtopped, the committee also suggested, besides building taller tsunami walls, also teaching citizens how to evacuate if a large-scale tsunami should strike.

It was also estimated that the tsunami reached heights of up to in Miyako in T≈çhoku's Iwate Prefecture. The inundated areas closely matched those of the 869 Sanriku tsunami.Yoshida, Reiji, \\"869 Tohoku tsunami parallels stun\\", Japan Times, 11 March 2012, p. 1. A Japanese government study found that 58% of people in coastal areas in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures heeded tsunami warnings immediately after the quake and headed for higher ground. Of those who attempted to evacuate after hearing the warning, only five percent were caught in the tsunami. Of those who didn't heed the warning, 49% were hit by the water.Jiji Press, \\"42% didn't immediately flee tsunami\\", Japan Times, 18 August 2011, p. 2. Delayed evacuations in response to the warnings had a number of causes. The tsunami height that had been initially predicted by the tsunami warning system was lower than the actual tsunami height; this error contributed to the delayed escape of some residents. The discrepancy arose as follows: in order to produce a quick prediction of a tsunami's height and thus to provide a timely warning, the initial earthquake and tsunami warning that was issued for the event was based on a calculation that requires only about 3 minutes. This calculation is, in turn, based on the maximum amplitude of the seismic wave. The amplitude of the seismic wave is measured using the JMA magnitude scale, which is similar to Richter magnitude scale. However, these scales \\"saturate\\" for earthquakes that are above a certain magnitude (magnitude 8 on the JMA scale); that is, in the case of very large earthquakes, the scales' values change little despite large differences in the earthquakes' energy. This resulted in an underestimation of the tsunami's height in initial reports. Problems in issuing updates also contributed to delays in evacuations. The warning system was supposed to be updated about 15 minutes after the earthquake occurred, by which time the calculation for the moment magnitude scale would normally be completed. However, the strong quake had exceeded the measurement limit of all of the teleseismometers within Japan, and thus it was impossible to calculate the moment magnitude based on data from those seismometers. Another cause of delayed evacuations was the release of the second update on the tsunami warning long after the earthquake (28 minutes, according to observations); by that time, power failures and similar circumstances reportedly prevented the update from reaching some residents. Also, observed data from tidal meters that were located off the coast were not fully reflected in the second warning. Furthermore, shortly after the earthquake, some wave meters reported a fluctuation of \\"\\", and this value was broadcast throughout the mass media and the warning system, which caused some residents to underestimate the danger of their situation and even delayed or suspended their evacuation. In response to the aforementioned shortcomings in the tsunami warning system, JMA began an investigation in 2011 and updated their system in 2013. In the updated system, for a powerful earthquake that is capable of causing the JMA magnitude scale to saturate, no quantitative prediction will be released in the initial warning; instead, there will be words that describe the situation's emergency. There are plans to install new teleseismometers with the ability to measure larger earthquakes, which would allow the calculation of a quake's moment magnitude scale in a timely manner. JMA also implemented a simpler empirical method to integrate, into a tsunami warning, data from GPS tidal meters as well as from undersea water pressure meters, and there are plans to install more of these meters and to develop further technology to utilize data observed by them. To prevent under- reporting of tsunami heights, early quantitative observation data that are smaller than the expected amplitude will be overridden and the public will instead be told that the situation is under observation. About 90 seconds after an earthquake, an additional report on the possibility of a tsunami will also be included in observation reports, in order to warn people before the JMA magnitude can be calculated. =Elsewhere across the Pacific= A Bonin petrel trapped in the sand on Midway Atoll by the tsunami, before being rescued Shortly after the earthquake, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued tsunami watches and announcements for locations in the Pacific.

Estimates of the cost of the damage range well into the tens of billions of US dollars; before-and-after satellite photographs of devastated regions show immense damage to many regions. Although Japan has invested the equivalent of billions of dollars on anti-tsunami seawalls which line at least 40% of its 34,751 km (21,593 mi) coastline and stand up to 12 m (39 ft) high, the tsunami simply washed over the top of some seawalls, collapsing some in the process.

Rolling blackouts began on 14 March due to power shortages caused by the earthquake. TEPCO, which normally provides approximately 40 GW of electricity, announced that it could only provide about 30 GW, because 40% of the electricity used in the greater Tokyo area was supplied by reactors in the Niigata and Fukushima prefectures. The reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima Dai-ni plants were automatically taken offline when the first earthquake occurred and sustained major damage from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Rolling blackouts of approximately three hours were experienced throughout April and May while TEPCO scrambled to find a temporary power solution. The blackouts affected Tokyo, Kanagawa, Eastern Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Chiba, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures. Voluntary reductions in electricity use by consumers in the Kanto area helped reduce the predicted frequency and duration of the blackouts.Joe, Melinda, \\"Kanto area works on energy conservation\\", Japan Times, 17 March 2011, p. 11.

Damage to electricity transmission lines T≈çhoku Electric Power was not able to provide the Kanto region with additional power because TEP's power plants were also damaged in the earthquake. Kansai Electric Power Company (Kepco) could not share electricity, because its system operated at 60 hertz, whereas TEPCO and TEP operate their systems at 50 hertz; the disparity is due to early industrial and infrastructure development in the 1880s that left Japan without a unified national power grid.A legacy from the 1800s leaves Tokyo facing blackouts, ITworld, 18 March 2011 Two substations, one in Shizuoka Prefecture and one in Nagano Prefecture, were able to convert between frequencies and transfer electricity from Kansai to Kanto and T≈çhoku, but their capacity was limited to 1 GW.

The backup cooling process is powered by emergency diesel generators at the plants and at Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant. At Fukushima Daiichi and Daini, tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems at Fukushima Daiichi, including three large explosions and radioactive leakage. Subsequent analysis found that many Japanese nuclear plants, including Fukushima Daiichi, were not adequately protected against tsunamis. Over 200,000 people were evacuated. The aftershock on 7 April caused the loss of external power to Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant and Higashidori Nuclear Power Plant but backup generators were functional. Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant lost three of its four external power lines and temporarily lost cooling function in its spent fuel pools for \\"20 to 80 minutes\\". A spill of \\"up to 3.8 litres\\" of radioactive water also occurred at Onagawa following the aftershock.Japan Earthquake: More Nuclear Plants Lose Power, International Business Times, Jesse Emspak, 8 April 2011 A report by the IAEA in 2012 found that the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant, the closest nuclear plant to the epicenter of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, had remained largely undamaged. The plant's three reactors automatically shut down without damage and all safety systems functioned as designed. The plant's seawall successfully withstood the tsunami. The Energy Commissioner of the European Union G√ºnther Oettinger addressed the European Parliament on 15 March, explaining that the nuclear disaster was an \\"apocalypse\\".Evans, Martin and Gordon Rayner. \\"Japan nuclear plant disaster: warning of an 'apocalypse‚Äô as fallout hits danger levels,\\" The Independent (UK). 16 March 2011. Retrieved 12 April 2011. As the nuclear crisis entered a second month, experts said that Fukushima Daiichi, while not the worst nuclear accident ever, was the most complicated. It was not as bad as the Chernobyl disaster, but worse than the Three Mile Island accident. It could take months or years to learn how damaging the release of dangerous isotopes has been to human health and food supplies, and to the surrounding countryside.\\"Analysis: A month on, Japan nuclear crisis still scarring,\\" International Business Times (Australia). 9 April 2011, retrieved 12 April 2011; excerpt, According to James Acton, Associate of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \\"Fukushima is not the worst nuclear accident ever but it is the most complicated and the most dramatic ... This was a crisis that played out in real time on TV. Chernobyl did not.\\" Later analysis indicated three reactors at Fukushima I (Units 1, 2, and 3) had suffered meltdowns and continued to leak coolant water. By summer the Vice-minister for Economy, Trade and Industry, the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, and the head of the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy had all lost their jobs. In 2013, only two nuclear reactors in Japan had been restarted since the 2011 shutdowns. In February 2019, there were 42 operable reactors in Japan. Of these, only nine reactors in five power plants were operating after having been restarted post-2011. Fukushima meltdowns Loose livestock roam the evacuation zone Japan declared a state of emergency following the failure of the cooling system at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, resulting in the evacuation of nearby residents. Officials from the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency reported that radiation levels inside the plant were up to 1,000 times normal levels, and that radiation levels outside the plant were up to eight times normal levels.Hiroko Tabuchi, Matthew L. Wald. Partial Meltdowns Presumed at Crippled Reactors. The New York Times, 13 March 2011 Later, a state of emergency was also declared at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant about south.Chico Harlan: Japan quake: With two natural disasters and a nuclear emergency, recovery begins. The Washington Post, 12 March 2011. Retrieved 13 March 2011. This brought the total number of problematic reactors to six.Rik Myslewski. Sixth Japanese nuclear reactor loses cooling. The Register, 13 March 2011. Retrieved 13 March 2011. Radioactive iodine was detected in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi, Gunma, Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, and Niigata, and radioactive caesium in the tap water in Fukushima, Tochigi and Gunma. Radioactive caesium, iodine, and strontium were also detected in the soil in some places in Fukushima. There may be a need to replace the contaminated soil. Many radioactive hotspots were found outside the evacuation zone, including Tokyo. Food products were also found contaminated by radioactive matter in several places in Japan. On 5 April 2011, the government of the Ibaraki Prefecture banned the fishing of sand lance after discovering that this species was contaminated by radioactive caesium above legal limits. As late as July 2013 slightly elevated levels of radioactivity were found in beef on sale at Tokyo markets. Incidents elsewhere A fire occurred in the turbine section of the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant following the earthquake. The blaze was in a building housing the turbine, which is sited separately from the plant's reactor, and was soon extinguished. The plant was shut down as a precaution. On 13 March the lowest-level state of emergency was declared regarding the Onagawa plant as radioactivity readings temporarily exceeded allowed levels in the area of the plant.Chico Harlan, Steven Mufson: Japanese nuclear plants' operator scrambles to avert meltdowns. The Washington Post, 11 March 2011 T≈çhoku Electric Power Co. stated this may have been due to radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accidents but was not from the Onagawa plant itself. As a result of 7 April aftershock, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant lost 3 of 4 external power lines and lost cooling function for as much as 80 minutes. A spill of a couple of litres of radioactive water occurred at Onagawa. The number 2 reactor at T≈çkai Nuclear Power Plant was shut down automatically. On 14 March it was reported that a cooling system pump for this reactor had stopped working; however, the Japan Atomic Power Company stated that there was a second operational pump sustaining the cooling systems, but that two of three diesel generators used to power the cooling system were out of order. =Wind power= None of Japan's commercial wind turbines, totaling over 2300 MW in nameplate capacity, failed as a result of the earthquake and tsunami, including the Kamisu offshore wind farm directly hit by the tsunami. =Transport= A highway bridge damaged and severed Japan's transport network suffered severe disruptions. Many sections of T≈çhoku Expressway serving northern Japan were damaged. The expressway did not reopen to general public use until 24 March 2011.NHK World, \\"T≈çhoku Expressway Reopened To All Traffic\\", 24 March 2011. All railway services were suspended in Tokyo, with an estimated 20,000 people stranded at major stations across the city.NHK News, 23:30 JST In the hours after the earthquake, some train services were resumed. Most Tokyo area train lines resumed full service by the next day‚Äî12 March.Associated Press, \\"When Tokyo's clockwork trains stopped ticking\\", Japan Times, 13 March 2011, p. 3. Twenty thousand stranded visitors spent the night of 11‚Äì12 March inside Tokyo Disneyland.Kyodo News, \\"Disney reality check for the stuck\\", Japan Times, 13 March 2011, p. 3. A tsunami flooded Sendai Airport at 15:55 JST, about 1 hour after the initial quake, causing severe damage. Narita and Haneda Airport both briefly suspended operations after the quake, but suffered little damage and reopened within 24 hours. Eleven airliners bound for Narita were diverted to nearby Yokota Air Base.Kyodo News, \\"USS Reagan on way\\", Japan Times, 13 March 2011, p. 2. Remains of Shinchi Station Various train services around Japan were also canceled, with JR East suspending all services for the rest of the day. Four trains on coastal lines were reported as being out of contact with operators; one, a four-car train on the Senseki Line, was found to have derailed, and its occupants were rescued shortly after 8 am the next morning. Minami-Kesennuma Station on the Kesennuma Line was obliterated save for its platform; 62 of 70 (31 of 35) JR East train lines suffered damage to some degree; in the worst-hit areas, 23 stations on 7 lines were washed away, with damage or loss of track in 680 locations and the 30-km radius around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant unable to be assessed. There were no derailments of Shinkansen bullet train services in and out of Tokyo, but their services were also suspended. The T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen resumed limited service late in the day and was back to its normal schedule by the next day, while the J≈çetsu and Nagano Shinkansen resumed services late on 12 March. Services on Yamagata Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 31 March. Derailments were minimized because of an early warning system that detected the earthquake before it struck. The system automatically stopped all high-speed trains, which minimized the damage. The T≈çhoku Shinkansen line was worst hit, with JR East estimating that 1,100 sections of the line, varying from collapsed station roofs to bent power pylons, will need repairs. Services on the T≈çhoku Shinkansen partially resumed only in Kant≈ç area on 15 March, with one round-trip service per hour between Tokyo and Nasu- Shiobara, and T≈çhoku area service partially resumed on 22 March between Morioka and Shin-Aomori. Services on Akita Shinkansen resumed with limited numbers of trains on 18 March. Service between Tokyo and Shin-Aomori was restored by May, but at lower speeds due to ongoing restoration work; the pre- earthquake timetable was not reinstated until late September. A KiHa 40 Train washed away uphill from Onagawa Station The rolling blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10‚Äì20 minute intervals, rather than the usual 3‚Äì5 minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line, Yokosuka Line, S≈çbu Main Line and Ch≈´≈ç-S≈çbu Line were all stopped for the day. This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion. =Telecommunications= Damaged utility pole in Ishinomaki Cellular and landline phone service suffered major disruptions in the affected area. Immediately after the earthquake cellular communication was jammed across much of Japan due to a surge of network activity. On the day of the quake, American broadcaster NPR was unable to reach anyone in Sendai with working phone or Internet. Internet services were largely unaffected in areas where basic infrastructure remained, despite the earthquake having damaged portions of several undersea cable systems landing in the affected regions; these systems were able to reroute around affected segments onto redundant links. Within Japan, only a few websites were initially unreachable. Several Wi-Fi hotspot providers reacted to the quake by providing free access to their networks, and some American telecommunications and VoIP companies such as AT&T;, Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile and VoIP companies such as netTALK and Vonage have offered free calls to (and in some cases, from) Japan for a limited time, as did Germany's Deutsche Telekom. =Defense= Matsushima Air Field of the Japan Self-Defense Force in Miyagi Prefecture was struck by the tsunami, flooding the base and resulting in damage to all 18 Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jets of the 21st Fighter Training Squadron. 12 of the aircraft were scrapped, while the remaining 6 were slated for repair at a cost of 80 billion yen ($1 billion), exceeding the original cost of the aircraft. =Space center= JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) evacuated the Tsukuba Space Center in Tsukuba, Ibaraki. The center, which houses a control room for part of the International Space Station, was shut down and some damage was reported. The Tsukuba control center resumed full operations for the space station's Kibo laboratory and the HTV cargo craft on 21 March 2011. =Cultural properties= traditional lantern at Tokiwa shrine in Mito City 754 cultural properties were damaged across nineteen prefectures, including five National Treasures (at Zuigan-ji, ≈åsaki Hachiman-g≈´, Shiramizu Amidad≈ç, and Seihaku-ji); 160 Important Cultural Properties (including at Sendai T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´, the K≈çd≈çkan, and Ents≈´-in, with its western decorative motifs); one hundred and forty-four Monuments of Japan (including Matsushima, Takata-matsubara, Y≈´bikan, and the Site of Tagaj≈ç); six Groups of Traditional Buildings; and four Important Tangible Folk Cultural Properties. Stone monuments at the UNESCO World Heritage Site: Shrines and Temples of Nikk≈ç were toppled. In Tokyo, there was damage to Koishikawa K≈çrakuen, Rikugien, Hamariky≈´ Onshi Teien, and the walls of Edo Castle. Information on the condition of collections held by museums, libraries and archives is still incomplete. There was no damage to the Historic Monuments and Sites of Hiraizumi in Iwate Prefecture, and the recommendation for their inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List in June was seized upon as a symbol of international recognition and recovery. Aftermath Rescue operations in the floodwaters in downtown Ishinomaki The aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami included both a humanitarian crisis and a major economic impact. The tsunami resulted in over 340,000 displaced people in the T≈çhoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine, and fuel for survivors. In response the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence Forces (under Joint Task Force ‚Äì T≈çhoku, led by Lieutenant General Eiji Kimizuka), while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors. Aid organizations both in Japan and worldwide also responded, with the Japanese Red Cross reporting $1 billion in donations. The economic impact included both immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding which has been estimated at ¬•10 trillion ($122 billion). In comparison to the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake, the East Japan earthquake brought serious damage to an extremely wide range. The aftermath of the twin disasters also left Japan's coastal cities and towns with nearly 25 million tons of debris. In Ishinomaki alone, there were 17 trash collection sites long and at least high. An official in the city's government trash disposal department estimated that it would take three years to empty these sites. In April 2015, authorities off the coast of Oregon discovered debris that is thought to be from a boat destroyed during the tsunami. Cargo contained yellowtail jack fish, a species that lives off the coast of Japan, still alive. KGW estimates that more than 1 million tons of debris still remain in the Pacific Ocean. Humanitarian response Japanese students collecting funds for the victims of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami at the University of P√©cs, Hungary Otsuchi, Japan following the tsunami According to Japan's foreign ministry, 116 countries and 28 international organizations offered assistance. Japan specifically requested assistance from teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and the United States. Media coverage Anti-nuclear protest following the disaster Japan's national public broadcaster, NHK, and Japan Satellite Television suspended their usual programming to provide ongoing coverage of the situation.NHK News, 14:40 JST. Other nationwide Japanese and international TV networks also broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the disaster. Ustream Asia broadcast live feeds of NHK, Tokyo Broadcasting System, Nippon TV, Fuji TV, TV Asahi, TV Tokyo, Tokyo MX, TV Kanagawa, and CNN on the Internet starting on 12 March 2011. YokosoNews, an Internet webcast in Japan, dedicated its broadcast to the latest news gathered from Japanese news stations, translating them in real time to English.Pinola, Melanie.

According to Jake Adelstein, most Japanese media accepted and parroted the misinformation put out by the Japanese government and TEPCO about the unfolding Fukushima nuclear crisis. Notable exceptions, according to Adelstein, were newspapers Sankei Shimbun and Chunichi Shimbun which questioned the accuracy of the information coming from the government and TEPCO. Because of the unquestioning nature of most Japanese media to hold to the \\"party line\\", many Japanese mid-level officials and experts spoke to foreign media to get their opinions and observations publicized.Adelstein, Jake, \\"What 2011 means for Japan in 2012 and beyond,\\" Japan Times, 1 January 2012, p. 20. Atsushi Funahashi, director of Nuclear Nation notes that \\"when the overseas media was calling Fukushima a 'meltdown,' the Japanese government and media waited two months before admitting it.\\" Nine days after the earthquake hit, a visualization and sonification were uploaded to YouTube allowing listeners to hear the earthquake as it unfolded in time. Two days of seismic activity made available by the IRIS Consortium were compressed into two minutes of sound. The large number of views made the video one of the most popular examples of sonification on the web. Also, following the earthquake, for the first time in Japanese history, the Emperor addressed the nation in a pre-recorded television broadcast. Scientific and research response Seismologists anticipated a very large quake would strike in the same place as the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake ‚Äî in the Sagami Trough, southwest of Tokyo. The Japanese government had tracked plate movements since 1976 in preparation for the so-called Tokai earthquake, predicted to take place in that region. However, occurring as it did north east of Tokyo, the T≈çhoku earthquake came as a surprise to seismologists. While the Japan Trench was known for creating large quakes, it had not been expected to generate quakes above an 8.0 magnitude. The Headquarters For Earthquake Research Promotion set up by Japanese government then reassessed the long term risk of trench-type earthquakes around Japan, and it was announced in November 2011 that research on the 869 Sanriku earthquake indicated that a similar earthquake with a magnitude of 8.4‚Äì9.0 would take place off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan, on average, every 600 years. Also, a tsunami-earthquake with a tsunami magnitude scales (Mt) between 8.6 and 9.0 (Similar to the 1896 Sanriku earthquake, the Mt for the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake was 9.1‚Äì9.4) had a 30% chance to occur within 30 years. The quake gave scientists the opportunity to collect a large amount of data to model the seismic events that took place in great detail. These data are expected to be used in a variety of ways, providing unprecedented information about how buildings respond to shaking, and other effects. Gravimetric data from the quake have been used to create a model for increased warning time compared to seismic models, as gravity fields travel faster than seismic waves. Researchers have also analysed the economic effects of this earthquake and have developed models of the nationwide propagation via interfirm supply networks of the shock that originated in the T≈çhoku region. Researchers soon after the full extent of the disaster was known launched a project to gather all digital material relating to the disaster into an online searchable archive to form the basis of future research into the events during and after the disaster. The Japan Digital Archive is presented in English and Japanese and is hosted at the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some of the first research to come from the archive was a 2014 paper from the Digital Methods Initiative in Amsterdam about patterns of Twitter usage around the time of the disaster. After the 2011 disaster the UNISDR, United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, held its World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Tohoku in March 2015, which produced the Sendai Framework document to guide efforts by international development agencies to act before disasters instead of reacting to them after the fact. At this time Japan's Disaster Management Office (Naikakufu Bosai Keikaku) published a bi-lingual guide in Japanese and English, Disaster Management in Japan, to outline the several varieties of natural disaster and the preparations being made for the eventuality of each. In the fall of 2016 Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED; Japanese abbreviation, Bosai Kaken; full name Bousai Kagaku Gijutsu Kenkyusho) launched the online interactive \\"Disaster Chronology Map for Japan, 416‚Äì2013\\" (map labels in Japanese) to display in visual form the location, disaster time, and date across the islands. An expedition named Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project have been conducted in year 2012‚Äì2013 to drill oceanfloor boreholes through the fault-zone of the earthquake and gathered important data about the rupture mechanism and physical properties of the fault that caused the huge earthquake and tsunami which devastated much of northeast Japan.Smithsonian.com Fault that Caused Japan's 2011 Earthquake is Thin and Slippery, 5 December 2013Christian Science Monitor Japan's monster quake: Do scientists have key to decode future tremblors?, 6 December 2013 Fukushima radiation comparison to other incidents and standards, with graph of recorded radiation levels and specific accident events.

Family and professional career Kirkpatrick was born in Canada,1851 England Census the second son of Sir Charles Sharpe Kirkpatrick, 6th Baronet and Helen Stuart Kirk. His father died in 1867 at which time his brother, Thomas, succeeded to the title; Thomas died childless in 1880 and the title passed to James. He was educated privately before joining the Admiralty as a clerk where he progressed to become Private Secretary to Lord George Hamilton, the First Lord of the Admiralty. He married Mary Steward of Peckham, Surrey on 24 April 1872 and they had six children: * Josephine Mary Kirkpatrick (1873‚Äì1948) * Charles Sharpe Kirkpatrick (1874‚Äì1937) who succeeded his father as the 9th Baronet. * Harry Fearnley Kirkpatrick (1876‚Äì1918), Lt. Colonel in The East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot), who was killed in the First World War. * Margaret Hope Kirkpatrick (1878‚Äì1945) * Yvone Kirkpatrick (1879‚Äì1924), worked for the political service in Nigeria. * Athole Kirkpatrick (1885‚Äì1917), 2nd Lieutenant in The East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot), who was also killed in the First World War. Kirkpatrick died at the family home in Forest Hill, Kent on 10 November 1899, aged 58. Football career Kirkpatrick was a member of the Civil Service Football Club and also of the Wanderers. His first Wanderers appearance came on 2 February 1867 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat by C.C.C. on Clapham Common; the team sheet for that match also includes a \\"C. Kirkpatrick\\", possibly his younger brother Charles. He became a frequent member of the Wanderers XI, making a total of 58 appearances over the next 11 years, generally as goalkeeper although he played occasionally as an outfield player, even scoring two goals, against Forest Club in 1870 and Gitanos in 1876. In the Football Annual for 1875, he was described as \\"a goalkeeper [who] is always excellent, and Surrey owes much to him in that position\\" while the 1879 edition said that he was \\"a very useful goalkeeper; fields well, and does not lose his head\\". Other editions described him as \\"a useful player all round, a good back and excellent goalkeeper\\". By 1874, he was chiefly known as a goalkeeper, whose \\"flying days [were] numbered in the past\\". In 1870, he helped Arthur Kinnaird to organise the Scottish team to play against England in the first of the series of international football matches. The Scotsmen were all based in London and the Home Counties. The advertisement placed in the Sportsman newspaper stated: > A match between the leading representatives of the Scotch and English > sections will be played at The Oval on Saturday 19 February, under the > auspices of the Football Association. Players duly qualified and desirous of > assisting either party must communicate with Mr AF Kinnaird of 2 Pall Mall > East, SW or Mr J Kirkpatrick, Admiralty, Somerset House, WC on behalf of the > Scotch, or with Mr Charles W Alcock, Boy Court, Ludgate Hill, EC or Mr RG > Graham, 7 Finch Lane, EC on the part of the English. For the inaugural international match, Kirkpatrick was Scotland's goalkeeper and captain. The Scots opened the scoring with a quarter of an hour to play after England's goalkeeper was moved upfield thus allowing Robert Crawford to score with a shot from distance. England fought back to score through Alfred Baker to salvage a draw a minute from the end of the game.Glasgow Herald (Glasgow, Scotland), Monday, 7 March 1870; Issue 9415. Kirkpatrick retained his place for the next three international matches, being captain again in the second. Although he had first played for the Wanderers in 1867, he was rarely available for their FA Cup ties. He was, however, an \\"umpire\\" for the first FA Cup Final in 1872. In 1877‚Äì78, he played in every round helping Wanderers to reach the final where they met a team from the Royal Engineers. The final was played at the Kennington Oval on 23 March 1878, the day after Kirkpatrick's 37 birthday. In the match, Kirkpatrick suffered a broken arm after fifteen minutes during a tussle on the goal-line; despite his injury, he managed to keep the ball out of the goal, and went on to play the remainder of the match despite his injury. Wanderers won the match 3‚Äì1 in their last appearance in the Final, thus claiming the trophy for the fifth time in seven years. The 1878 FA Cup Final was Kirkpatrick's final appearance for the Wanderers. He also represented Surrey and served on the Football Association committee from 1869 to 1872. Cricket career Kirkpatrick also played cricket for the Civil Service, Lansdown and Chiswick & Turnham Green clubs between 1863 and 1879 and played for the Gentlemen of the South in a first-class match against the Gentlemen of the North in July 1867 taking three wickets as his side claimed an eight wicket victory.

The Trust works to tackle the widespread poverty and hardship in South Asia to which millions are currently subjected. Since its establishment in 2007, the Trust has positively impacted the lives of four million disadvantaged people in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Focus The Trust's programmes are categorized into four key areas: livelihoods, education, mental health/disability, and anti-human trafficking. The Trust works with local partners in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  Innovative Finance  The recent evolution in philanthropy to incorporate business principles has led to ground-breaking developments in the voluntary sector. Social-impact financing, a relatively new charity finance model, offers funders an investment return if the programme to which they are committed is successful. This outcome-based finance mechanism requires clear targets and focuses on gathering data to demonstrate the results. Such meticulousness is attracting donors to invest, bringing new capital into the sector and playing a critical role in bridging the financing gap to achieve the UN‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals. This approach appeals to other lenders, such as charities, governments and entrepreneurs, as it substantiates the positive impact that their donations have made. The British Asian Trust is leading an innovative model of social-impact financing, in the form of Development Impact Bonds (DIB), allowing the Trust to set up initiatives to improve the quality education in India. The DIB mechanism involves public- private relationships between ‚Äòrisk‚Äô investors, programme implementers and outcome funders. In the case of the aforementioned Quality Education India Development Impact Bond, UBS Optimus Foundation are the ‚Äòrisk‚Äô investors who have raised US $3 million to offer upfront working capital to the consortium, thus enabling the administration of the programme for the duration of its four-year lifetime.

In Meatu District, Shinyanga Region, water most often comes from open holes dug in the sand of dry riverbeds, and it is invariably contaminated Babile fill yellow water jugs at the area's main water source, May 26, 2012 When there is a geographic and temporal imbalance between the demand of freshwater and its availability, that is known as Water Scarcity. In this regard, scarcity can be defined as either the scarcity in availability due to physical shortage or scarcity in access due to lack of adequate infrastructure.United Nations. Water Scarcity. UN Water.https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/ In this regard, water scarcity is the consequence of both natural and man-made causes. Water scarcity or lack of safe drinking water is one of the world's leading problems affecting more than 1.1 billion people globally, meaning that one in every six people lacks access to safe drinking water. The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) defines safe drinking water as \\"water with microbial, chemical and physical characteristics that meets WHO guidelines or national standards on drinking water quality.\\" Hydrologists generally assess water scarcity by looking at a population-to-water equation that treats 1,700 cubic meters per person as the national threshold for meeting water requirements for agricultural and industrial production, energy, and the environment. Availability below the threshold of 1,000 cubic meters represents a state of \\"water scarcity\\", while anything below 500 cubic meters represents a state of \\"absolute scarcity\\". As of 2006, one third of all nations suffered from clean water scarcity, but Sub-Saharan Africa had the largest number of water-stressed countries of any other place on the planet and of an estimated 800 million people who live in Africa, 300 million live in a water stressed environment. According to findings presented at the 2012 Conference on \\"Water Scarcity in Africa: Issues and Challenges\\", it is estimated that by 2030, 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be living in areas of high water stress, which will likely displace anywhere between 24 million and 700 million people as conditions become increasingly unlivable.  Health  The most immediately apparent impact of water scarcity in Africa is on the continent's health. With a complete lack of water, humans can only live up to 3 to 5 days on average. This often forces those living in water deprived regions to turn to unsafe water resources, which, according to the World Health Organization, contributes to the spread of waterborne diseases including typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery and diarrhea, and to the spread of diseases such as malaria whose vectors rely on such water resources, and can lead to diseases such as trachoma, plague, and typhus. Additionally, water scarcity causes many people to store water within the household, which increases the risk of household water contamination and incidents of malaria and dengue fever spread by mosquitoes. These waterborne diseases are not usually found in developed countries because of sophisticated water treatment systems that filter and chlorinate water, but for those living with less developed or non-existent water infrastructure, natural, untreated water sources often contain tiny disease-carrying worms and bacteria. Although many of these waterborne sicknesses are treatable and preventable, they are nonetheless one of the leading causes of disease and death in the world. Globally, 2.2 million people die each year from diarrhea-related disease, and at any given time fifty percent of all hospital beds in the world are occupied by patients suffering from water-related diseases. Infants and children are especially susceptible to these diseases because of their young immune systems, which lends to elevated infant mortality rates in many regions of Africa. Water scarcity has a big impact on hygiene. When infected with these waterborne diseases, those living in African communities suffering from water scarcity cannot contribute to the community's productivity and development because of a simple lack of strength. Additionally, individual, community and governmental economic resources are sapped by the cost of medicine to treat waterborne diseases, which takes away from resources that might have potentially been allocated in support of food supply or school fees. Also, in term of governmental funding, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) estimates that in Sub-Saharan Africa, treatment of diarrhea due to water contamination consumes 12% of the country's health budget. With better water conditions, the burden on healthcare would be less substantial, while a healthier workforce would stimulate economic growth and help alleviate the prevalence of poverty.Along with waterborne diseases and unsafe drinking water, malnutrition is also a major cause of death in Africa, where water scarcity affects agricultural production. = Agriculture = Ethiopia's move to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's reservoir could reduce Nile flows by as much as 25% and devastate Egyptian farmlands. The Human Development Report reports that human use of water is mainly allocated to irrigation and agriculture. In developing areas, such as those within Europe, agriculture accounts for more than 80% of water consumption. This is due to the fact that it takes about 3,500 liters of water to produce enough food for the daily minimum of 3,000 calories, and food production for a typical family of four takes a daily amount of water equivalent to the amount of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Because the majority of Africa remains dependent on an agricultural lifestyle and 80% to 90% of all families in rural Africa rely upon producing their own food, water scarcity translates to a loss of food security. Water, agriculture, nutrition, and health have always been linked but recently became recognized and researched as a cause and effect loop. More than 70% of agriculture practiced in Sub-Saharan Africa is rainfed agriculture. With the increasing variability of current weather patterns the crops and harvests are more prone to being affected by droughts and floods. Food and nutrition security is defining the development agenda in Sub-Saharan Africa. At this point, with less than a third of the continent's potential using irrigation most of the rural African communities are not tapping into their irrigation potential, and according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa and New Partnership for Africa's Development, \\"irrigation is key to achieving increased agricultural production that is important for economic development and for attaining food security\\". Irrigation agriculture only accounts for 20% of agriculture types globally.Kauffman, J., Mantel, S., Ringersma, J., Dijkshoorn, J., Van Lynden, G., Dent, D. Making Better Use of Green Water in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Sub-Saharan Africa the governments have historically played a large part in irrigation development. Starting in the 1960s donors like the World Bank supported these African governments in the development of irrigations systems.Kadigi, R., Tesfay, G., Bizoza, A., Zinabou, G. (2013). Global Development Network GDN Working Paper Series Irrigation and Water Use Efficiency in Sub-Saharan Africa Working Paper No. 63. Global Development Network. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263464548 However, in the years since, irrigation agriculture has produced a lower than expected crop yield. According to the World Bank the agriculture production in Sub-saharan Africa could nearly triple by 2050. The Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger and promote sustainable agriculture to achieve food and nutrition security.United Nations. Goal 6: Ensure Access to Water and Sanitation for All. Sustainable Development Goals. https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/publications/SDG6_SR2018.pdf There needs to be a shift from high-yield crop production to a more diversified cropping system, including underutilized nutritious crops that will contribute to dietary diversity and achieve daily nutrient goals. But for many regions, there is a lack of financial and human resources to support infrastructure and technology required for proper crop irrigation. Because of this, the impact of droughts, floods, and desertification is greater in terms of both African economic loss and human life loss due to crop failure and starvation. In a study conducted by the World Bank, they found that, on average, individuals who suffer from malnutrition lose 10% of their potential lifetime earnings. They also found that countries lose 2%-3% of their GDP due to undernutrition.Bain, L., Et al. (2013). Malnutrition in Sub-Saharan Africa: Burden, Causes and Prospects. Pan African Medical Journal. www.panafrican-med- journal.com Starved girl in Nigeria Additionally, lack of water causes many Africans to use wastewater for crop growth, causing a large number of people to consume foods that can contain chemicals or disease-causing organisms transferred by the wastewater. Greywater constructed wetlands and modified sand filters are two methods of greywater filtration that have been proposed. These methods allow for greywater to be purified or filtered to remove biological hazards from the water that would not be safe to use in agriculture. Thus, for the extremely high number of African areas suffering from water scarcity issues, investing in development means sustainably withdrawing from clean freshwater sources, ensuring food security by expanding irrigation areas, and effectively managing the effects of climate change. The sustainable development goal report aims at increasing safe wastewater use to contribute to increasing food production and improved nutrition.  Malnutrition  Starved child in Somalia Linked to ‚Öì of all child deaths, malnutrition is especially dangerous for women and children. Malnourished women will usually have malnourished fetuses while they are pregnant, which can lead to physically and mentally stunted children, creating a cycle of malnutrition and underdevelopment. One of the most severe at risk populations are children under 5. Malnutrition during these early stages of development have negative effects on growth and intellectual development which can never be undone. This effect on a child's intellectual quotient makes it impossible for them later in life to achieve their true potential abilities. Breaking the cycle of malnutrition during early childhood development can break the cycle of intergenerational poverty among poor communities. Globally,162 million children show symptoms such as stunting, which is an indicator of malnourishment. There are a variety of ways in which malnutrition can affect the body. Common micronutrient deficiencies are iron, zinc, iodine, and vitamin A. Micronutrient deficiencies can cause an increase of illness due to compromised immune systems or abnormal physiology and development.Black, R. (2003) Micronutrient Deficiency ‚Äì An Underlying Cause of Morbidity and Mortality. Bulletin of the World Health Organization. 81(2). 79. https://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/2003.v81n2/79-79/en Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) is another form of malnutrition that affects children. PEM can appear as conditions called marasmus, kwashiorkor, and an intermediate state of marasmus-kwashiorkor. Although malnutrition can have severe and lasting health effects on women and children, they are still susceptible to other water-related dangers.Atassi, H. (2019). Protein-Energy Malnutrition. MedScape. https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1104623-overview  Women  African women and men's divergent social positions lead to differences in water responsibilities, rights, and access, and so African women are disproportionally burdened by the scarcity of clean drinking water. In most African societies, women are seen as the collectors, managers, and guardians of water, especially within the domestic sphere that includes household chores, cooking, washing, and child rearing. Because of these traditional gender labor roles, women are forced to spend around sixty percent of each day collecting water, which translates to approximately 200 million collective work hours by women globally per day and a decrease in the amount of time available for education. Water scarcity exacerbates this issue, as indicated by the correlation of decrease in access to water with a decrease in combined primary, secondary, and tertiary enrollment of women. For African women, their daily role in clean water retrieval often means carrying the typical jerrycan that can weigh over 40 pounds when full for an average of six kilometers each day. This has health consequences such as permanent skeletal damage from carrying heavy loads of water over long distances each day, which translates to a physical strain that contributes to increased stress, increased time spent in health recovery, and decreased ability to not only physically attend educational facilities, but also mentally absorb education due to the effect of stress on decision-making and memory skills. Also, in terms of health, access to safe and clean drinking water leads to greater protection from water-borne illnesses and diseases which increases women's capabilities to attend school. The detriment water scarcity has on educational attainment for women, in turn, affects the social and economic capital of women in terms of leadership, earnings, and working opportunities. As a result of this, many women are unable to hold employment. The lost number of potential school days and education hinders the next generation of African women from breaking out of the cycle of unequal opportunity for gainful employment, which serves to perpetuate the prevalence of unequal opportunity for African women and adverse effects associated with lacking income from gainful employment. Thus, improved access to water influences women's allocation of time, level of education, and as a result their potential for higher wages associated with recognized and gainful employment.  Children  In addition, the issue of water scarcity in Africa prevents many young children, especially, from attending school and receiving an education are expected to not only aid their mothers in water retrieval but to also help with the demands of household chores that are made more time-intensive because of a lack of readily available water. Furthermore, a lack of clean water means the absence of sanitary facilities and latrines in schools, and so once puberty hits, this has a more serious impact on female children. In terms of lost educational opportunity, it is estimated that this would result in 272 million more school attendance days per year if adequate investment were made in drinking water and sanitation. For parents, an increase in access to reliable water resources reduces vulnerability to shocks, which allows for increased livelihood security and for families to allocate a greater portion of their resources to care for their children. This means improved nutrition for children, a reduction in school days missed due to health issues, and greater flexibility to spend resources on providing for the direct costs associated with sending children to school. And if families escape forced migration due to water scarcity, children's educational potential is even further improved with better stability and uninterrupted school attendance. = Productivity and development = Poverty is directly related to the accessibility of clean drinking water- without it, the chances of breaking out of the poverty trap are extremely slim. This concept of a \\"water poverty trap\\" was developed by economists specifically observing sub-Saharan Africa and refers to a cycle of financial poverty, low agricultural production, and increasing environmental degradation. In this negative feedback loop, this creates a link between the lack of water resources with the lack of financial resources that affect all societal levels including individual, household, and community. Within this poverty trap, people are subjected to low incomes, high fixed costs of water supply facilities, and lack of credit for water investments, which results in a low level of investment in water and land resources, lack of investment in profit-generating activities, resource degradation, and chronic poverty. Compounding on this, in the slums of developing countries, poor people typically pay five to ten times more per unit of water than do people with access to piped water because of issues ‚Äì including the lack of infrastructure and government corruption ‚Äì which is estimated to raise the prices of water services by 10% to 30%. So, the social and economic consequences of a lack of clean water penetrate into realms of education, opportunities for gainful employment, physical strength and health, agricultural and industrial development, and thus the overall productive potential of a community, nation, and/or region. Because of this, the UN estimates that Sub-Saharan Africa alone loses 40 billion potential work hours per year collecting water. = Conflict = The population growth across the world and the climate change are two factors that together could give rise to water conflicts in many parts of the world. Already, the explosion of populations in developing nations within Africa combined with climate change is causing extreme strain within and between nations. In the past, countries have worked to resolve water tensions through negotiation, but there is predicted to be an escalation in aggression over water accessibility. Africa's susceptibility to potential water-induced conflict can be separated into four regions: the Nile, Niger, Zambezi, and Volta basins. Running through Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan, the Nile's water has the potential to spark conflict and unrest. In the region of the Niger, the river basin extends from Guinea through Mali and down to Nigeria. Especially for Mali ‚Äì one of the world's poorest countries ‚Äì the river is vital for food, water and transportation, and its over usage is contributing to an increasingly polluted and unusable water source. In southern Africa, the Zambezi river basin is one of the world's most over-used river systems, and so Zambia and Zimbabwe compete fiercely over it. Additionally, in 2000, Zimbabwe caused the region to experience the worst flooding in recent history when the country opened the Kariba Dam gates. Finally, within the Volta river basin, Ghana is dependent on its hydroelectric output but plagued by regular droughts which affect the production of electricity from the Akosombo Dam and limit Ghana's ability to sustain economic growth. Paired with the constraints this also puts on Ghana's ability to provide power for the area, this could potentially contribute to regional instability. At this point, federal intelligence agencies have issued the joint judgment that in the next ten years, water issues are not likely to cause internal and external tensions that lead to the intensification war. But if current rates of consumption paired with climatic stress continue, levels of water scarcity in Africa are predicted by UNECA to reach dangerously high levels by 2025. This means that by 2022 there is the potential for a shift in water scarcity's potential to contribute to armed conflict. Based on the classified National Intelligence Estimate on water security, requested by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and completed in Fall 2011, after 2022 water will be more likely to be used as a weapon of war and potential tool for terrorism, especially in North Africa. On World Water Day, the State Department stated that water stress, \\"will likely increase the risk of instability and state failure, exacerbate regional tensions and distract countries from working with the United States on important policy objectives.\\" Specifically referring to the Nile in Egypt, Sudan, and nations further south, the report predicts that upstream nations will limit access to water for political reasons and that terrorists may target water-related infrastructures, such as reservoirs and dams, more frequently. Because of this, the World Economic Forum's 2011 Global Risk Report has included water scarcity as one of the world's top five risks for the first time.  Reasons for scarcity  = Climate change = According to the Africa Partnership Forum, \\"Although Africa is continent least responsible for climate change, it is particularly vulnerable to the effects,\\" and the long-term impacts include, \\"changing rainfall patterns affecting agriculture and reducing food security; worsening water security; decreasing fish resources in large lakes due to rising temperature; shifting vector-borne diseases; rising sea level affecting low-lying coastal areas with large populations; and rising water stress\\". Over the past century, the global population has more than doubled, however compared to population growth, water use has increased at more than double the rate.United Nations. (2014, Dec 24). Water Scarcity. International Decade for Action ‚ÄòWATER FOR LIFE‚Äô. https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml The growing population will only exacerbate the water scarcity crisis as more pressure is placed on the availability and access of water resources. ‚ÄúToday, 41% of the world's population lives in river basins that are under water stress‚ÄùWorld Wildlife Foundation. Water Scarcity. World Wildlife Foundation. https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/water-scarcity. This raises a major concern as many regions are reaching the limit at which water services can be sustainably delivered. More specifically, the Human Development Report predicts warming paired with 10% less rainfall in interior regions of Africa, which will be amplified by water loss due to water loss increase from rising temperature. Droughts and floods are considered to be the most dangerous threat to physical water scarcity.Reinacher, L. (2013 Oct 3). The Water Crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Borgen Project. This warming will be greatest over the semi-arid regions of the Sahara, along the Sahel, and interior areas of southern Africa. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that climate change in Africa has manifested itself in more intense and longer droughts in the subtropics and tropics, while arid or semi-arid areas in northern, western, eastern, and parts of southern Africa are becoming drier and more susceptible to variability of precipitation and storms. The Human Development Report goes on to that explain that because of Africa's dependence on rain-fed agriculture, widespread poverty, and weak capacity, the water issues caused by climate change impact the continent much more violently compared to developed nations that have the resources and economic diversity to deal with such global changes. This heightened potential for drought and falling crop yields will most likely lead to increased poverty, lower incomes, less secure livelihoods, and an increased threat of chronic hunger for the poorest people in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall this means that water stress caused by changing amounts of precipitation is particularly damaging to Africa and thus climate change is one of the major obstacles the continent must face when trying to secure reliable and clean sources of water. ‚Äú66 percent of people dwelling in sub-Saharan Africa live in areas of little to no rainfall which often results in failed vegetation and agricultural efforts. More than 300 to 800 sub-Saharan Africans live in a water-scarce location‚Äù = Physical and economic scarcity = Water scarcity is both a natural and human-made phenomenon. It is thus essential to break it down into two general types: Economic scarcity and physical scarcity. Economic scarcity refers to the fact that finding a reliable source of safe water is time-consuming and expensive. Alternatively, physical scarcity is when there simply is not enough water within a given region. The 2006 United Nations Economic Commission for Africa estimates that 300 million out of the 800 million who live on the African continent live in a water-scarce environment. Specifically in the very north of Africa, as well the very south of Africa, the rising global temperatures accompanying climate change have intensified the hydrological cycle that leads to drier dry seasons, thus increasing the risk of more extreme and frequent droughts. This significantly impacts the availability, quality and quantity of water due to reduced river flows and reservoir storage, lowering of water tables and drying up of aquifers in the northern and southern regions of Africa. Included in the category of physical scarcity is the issue of overexploitation. This is contributing to the shrinking of many of Africa's great lakes, including the Nakivale, Nakuru, and Lake Chad, which has shrunk to 10% of its former volume. In terms of policy, the incentives for overuse are among the most damaging, especially concerning ground water extraction. For ground water, once the pump is installed, the policy of many countries is to only constrain removal based on the cost of electricity, and in many cases subsidize electricity costs for agricultural uses, which damages incentives to conserve such resources. Additionally, many countries within Africa set the cost of water well below cost-recovery levels, thus discouraging efficient usage and threatening sustainability. The majority of Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from economic scarcity because of the population's lack of the necessary monetary means to utilize adequate sources of water. Both political reasons and ethnic conflict have contributed to this unequal distribution of resources. Out of the two forms of water scarcity, economic scarcity can be addressed quickly and effectively with simple infrastructure to collect rainwater from roofs and dams, but this requires economic resources that many of these areas lack due to an absence of industrial development and widespread poverty. = Regional variance = Northern Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa are progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on water at different paces. While Northern Africa has 92% safe water coverage, Sub-Saharan Africa remains at a low 60% of coverage ‚Äì leaving 40% of the 783 million people in that region without access to clean drinking water. Some of these differences in clean water availability can be attributed to Africa's extreme climates. Although Sub-Saharan Africa has a plentiful supply of rainwater, it is seasonal and unevenly distributed, leading to frequent floods and droughts. Additionally, prevalent economic development and poverty issues, compounded with rapid population growth and rural-urban migration have rendered Sub- Saharan Africa as the world's poorest and least developed region. Thus, this poverty constrains many cities in this region from providing clean water and sanitation services and preventing the further deterioration of water quality even when opportunities exist to address these water issues. Additionally, the rapid population growth leads to an increased number of African settlements on flood-prone, high-risk land. The latest report of the SDG goal 6 has mentioned various facts about water status in sub-Saharan Africa including the lack of hygiene and its impact on the nutritional status especially among children due to increased rate of infectious diseases. Also, almost 1/3 of the sub-Saharan population are in danger of hunger due to lack of access to food. Furthermore, sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to safe drinking water by 76% percent while only 6% of Europe and Northern America is not covered.  Addressing the issue  A Water.org video about addressing water scarcity in Ethiopia. = International and non-governmental organizations' efforts = To adequately address the issue of water scarcity in Africa, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa emphasizes the need to invest in the development of Africa's potential water resources to reduce unnecessary suffering, ensure food security, and protect economic gains by effectively managing droughts, floods, and desertification. Some suggested and ongoing efforts to achieve this include an emphasis on infrastructural implementations and improvements of wells, rainwater catchment systems, and clean-water storage tanks. Efforts made by the United Nations in compliance with the Millennium Development Goals have targeted water scarcity not just for Africa, but globally. The compiled list includes eight international development goals, seven of which are directly impacted by water scarcity. Access to water affects poverty, food scarcity, educational attainment, social and economic capital of women, livelihood security, disease, and human and environmental health. Because addressing the issue of water is so integral to reaching the MDGs, one of the sub-goals includes halving the proportion of the globe's population without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015. In March 2012, the UN announced that this goal has been met almost four years in advance, suggesting that global efforts to reduce water scarcity are on a successful trend. As one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the United States plays an integral role in promoting solutions to aid with clean water scarcity. One of many efforts include USAID's WASH- the WASH for Life partnership with the Gates Foundation- that works to promote water, sanitation, and hygiene. With this, the U.S. \\"will identify, test, and scale up evidence-based approaches for delivering these services to people in some of the poorest regions\\". Additionally, in March 2012, Hillary Clinton announced the U.S. Water Partnership, which will bring together people from the private sector, the philanthropic community, non-governmental organizations, academics, experts, and the government in an attempt to look for system-wide solutions. The technologies and ability to tackle the issue of water scarcity and cleanliness are present, but it is highly a matter of accessibility. Thus, the partnership will aim at making these solutions available and obtainable at a local level. In addition to the role the United States, the United Nations, and other international governmental bodies, a number of charitable organizations work to provide clean water in Africa and elsewhere around the world. These charities are based on individual and group donations, which are then invested in a variety of methods and technologies to provide clean water. In 2015, safe drinking water and sanitation sources have been provided to 90% of the world's inhabitants because of the efforts that had been made to achieve the MDGs. In continuation of this progress the UN have been recognized to include ‚ÄúClean water and Sanitation‚Äù as the goal number six to ‚ÄúEnsure access to water and sanitation for all‚Äù. The goal depends on the availability of enough fresh water of the world to achieve universal access to drinking and clean water for sanitation, but the lack of planning and shortage of investment is what the world needs to focus on. The main targets of the six SDG is that by 2030, the world will ensure water access for all, provide sanitary resources especially for people at risk, increase waste treatment and decrease the rate of water pollution. In addition to establishing new collaborative efforts on the international and local levels to improve water management systems. = Solutions and technologies = The more basic solutions to help provide Africa with drinkable and usable water include well-digging, rain catchment systems, de-worming pills, and hand pumps, but high demand for clean water solutions has also prompted the development of some key creative solutions as well. Some non-profit organizations have focused on the aspect of drinking water contamination from sewage waste by installing cost-effective and relatively maintenance-free toilets, such as Drop In The Bucket's \\"Eco-sanitation Flush Toilet\\" or Pump Aid's \\"Elephant Toilet\\". The Elephant Toilet uses community-sourced resources in construction to build a relatively simple waste disposal mechanism that separates solids from liquids to promote faster decomposition and lower the impact on ground water. In comparison, the Eco-Sanitation Flush Toilet also uses no power of any kind, but actually treats sewage rather than just storing it so that the toilet's output is only water. Both solutions are then simple for residents of African communities to maintain and have a notable impact on the cleanliness of local water sources. Other solutions to clean water scarcity issues have focused on innovative pump systems, including hand-pumps, Water for People's \\"Play Pumps\\", and Pump Aid's \\"Elephant Pumps\\". All three designs are built to aid communities in drawing clean water from wells. The hand pump is the most basic and simple to repair, with replacement parts easily found. Using a more creative approach, Play Pumps combine child's play with clean water extraction through the use of playground equipment, called a roundabout. The idea behind this is as children play on the roundabout, water will simultaneously be pumped from a reservoir tank to either toilets, hand- washing stations, or for drinking water. Some downsides to the PlayPump, though, are its inability to address situations of physical water scarcity and the danger of exploitation when children's play is equated with pumping water. Alternatively, Elephant Pumps are simple hand water pumps. After a well is prepared, a rope-pump mechanism is installed that is easy to maintain, uses locally sourced parts, and can be up and running in the time span of about a week. The Elephant Pump can provide 250 people with 40 litres of clean water per person per day. Moving beyond sanitary waste disposal and pumps, clean water technology can now be found in the form of drinking straw filtration. Used as solution by Water Is Life, the straw is small, portable, and costs US$10 per unit. The filtration device is designed to eliminate waterborne diseases, and as a result, provide safe drinking water for one person for one year. Overall, a wide range of cost-effective, manageable, and innovative solutions are available to help aid Africa in producing clean, disease-free water. Ultimately what it comes down to is using technology appropriate for each individual community's needs. For the technology to be effective, it must conform to environmental, ethical, cultural, social, and economic aspects of each Africa community. Additionally, state governments, donor agencies, and technological solutions must be mindful of the gender disparity in access to water so as to not exclude women from development or resource management projects. If this can be done, with sufficient funding and aid to implement such technologies, it is feasible to eliminate clean water scarcity for the African continent by the Millennium Development Goal deadline of 2012. Since that deadline has passed, the Sustainable Development Goals are what we are striving for by the year 2030. SDGs are intersectional and interdependent, it's important to find modern solutions to save water through decreasing water use in irrigation by using more treated wastewater and shifting to less water dependent crops in regions with water scarcity. Another solution that contribute to sanitation and water preservation is EcoSan technologies that aim to benefit from the human waste in agriculture and reduce water pollution. (NBSs) Natural-Based Solutions are suggested as a successful alternative towards achieving the six SDG, NBSs include means to improve access to water with high caliber. = Limitations = Africa is home to both the largest number of water-scarce countries out of any region, as well as home to the most difficult countries to reach in terms of water aid. The prevalence of rural villages traps many areas in what the UN Economic Commission for Africa refers to as the \\"Harvesting Stage\\", which makes water-scarce regions difficult to aid because of a lack of industrial technology to make solutions sustainable. In addition to the geographic and developmental limiting factors, a number of political, economic reasons also stand in the way of ensuring adequate aid for Africa. Politically, tensions between local governments versus foreign non-governmental organizations impact the ability to successfully bring in money and aid-workers. Economically, urban areas suffer from extreme wealth gaps in which the overwhelming poor often pay four to ten times more for sanitary water than the elite, hindering the poor from gaining access to clean water technologies and efforts. As a result of all these factors, it is estimated that fifty percent of all water projects fail, less than five percent of projects are visited, and less than one percent have any long term monitoring.

It is found along much of the western Atlantic Ocean and was first described by Thomas Say in 1818. Distribution Tumidotheres maculatus has a wide range in the western Atlantic Ocean, extending from the seas of Martha's Vineyard (United States) to San Mat√≠as Gulf (Argentina). Description There is conspicuous sexual dimorphism in T. maculatus which corresponds with the differing ecology of the two sexes. Males are typically less than in carapace width, and are able to leave the host. Females grow up to wide, and, having reached adulthood, spend their entire lives in the host. Ecology Tumidotheres maculatus is an endosymbiont of molluscs; it is unclear whether the host is harmed by the crabs presence, that is whether the relationship is commensal or parasitic. It is associated with a wide range of mollusc hosts, most of which are bivalves. They include Argopecten irradians, Atrina rigida, Modiolus americanus, Mytilus edulis and Flexopecten felipponei. It has also been found in a tunicate of the genus Molgula, in the tubes of the tubeworm Chaetopterus variopedatus and on the asteroid (starfish) Asterias rubens. In molluscan hosts, T. maculatus uses its legs to cling to the gills of its host, and feeds on strands of food aggregated by the host. Reported rates of infestation of T. maculatus on mollusc hosts vary widely, from 0%‚Äì20% on Argopecten irradians at St. Joseph Bay, Florida, to 97.6% on Mytilus edulis at Quicks Hole, Massachusetts. Taxonomy Tumidotheres maculatus was first described by Thomas Say in 1818, under the name Pinnotheres maculatus. It was transferred to the new genus Tumidotheres, alongside T. margarita by Ernesto Campos in 1989. It may be the species referred to by Carl Linnaeus as Cancer parasiticus in his 1763 work Centuria Insectorum, and the one he called Cancer pinnophylax in the 1767 12th edition of Systema Naturae.

He is best known for refereeing at the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Career Born in Palestrina near Rome, Sbardella first got involved in football playing as a goalkeeper at youth levels of the local powerhouse Lazio. However Sbardella never appeared in the Serie A as he failed to rise through the ranks at Lazio, and he eventually finished his playing career at Artiglio, a small Rome-based Serie C club. He then took up refereeing, and in his domestic career he officiated a total of 167 Serie A matches. Along with Concetto Lo Bello he was considered one of the top two Italian referees of the 1960s and 1970s. The pinnacle of his career came at the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, in which he refereed two matches, including the third place play-off between West Germany and Uruguay. Sbardella had been designated to referee the final, but was eventually replaced by East Germany's Rudi Gl√∂ckner because Italy national football team had reached the final. In club football his highlights include officiating two Coppa Italia finals (the 1963 final between Atalanta and Torino and the 1966 final between Catanzaro and Fiorentina), and the second leg of the 1967 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final between Leeds United and Dinamo Zagreb. After retiring from refereeing, Sbardella became a Sport Manager. He managed at Lazio, Roma and Triestina football clubs in the 1970s and 1980s. The greatest satisfactions came from the period spent at Lazio, when together with Tommaso Maestrelli, he managed to build an unrepeatable superb team with many unruly talents, who kept at bay but gave to the club of president Lenzini the Italian championship of 1974.

The proposal and exact solution of this model by Affleck, Lieb, Kennedy and Tasaki provided crucial insight into the physics of the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. It has also served as a useful example for such concepts as valence bond solid order, symmetry-protected topological order and matrix product state wavefunctions.  Background  A major motivation for the AKLT model was the Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh chain. Because two out of every set of three neighboring spins in a Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh ground state are paired into a singlet, or valence bond, the three spins together can never be found to be in a spin 3/2 state. In fact, the Majumdar‚ÄìGhosh Hamiltonian is nothing but the sum of all projectors of three neighboring spins onto a 3/2 state. The main insight of the AKLT paper was that this construction could be generalized to obtain exactly solvable models for spin sizes other than 1/2. Just as one end of a valence bond is a spin 1/2, the ends of two valence bonds can be combined into a spin 1, three into a spin 3/2, etc.  Definition  Affleck et al. were interested in constructing a one-dimensional state with a valence bond between every pair of sites. Because this leads to two spin 1/2s for every site, the result must be the wavefunction of a spin 1 system. For every adjacent pair of the spin 1s, two of the four constituent spin 1/2s are stuck in a total spin zero state. Therefore, each pair of spin 1s is forbidden from being in a combined spin 2 state. By writing this condition as a sum of projectors, AKLT arrived at the following Hamiltonian : hat H = sum_j vec{S}_j cdot vec{S}_{j+1} + frac{1}{3} (vec{S}_j cdot vec{S}_{j+1})^2 where the vec{S_i} are spin-1 operators. This Hamiltonian is similar to the spin 1, one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg spin model but has an additional \\"biquadratic\\" spin interaction term.  Ground state  By construction, the ground state of the AKLT Hamiltonian is the valence bond solid with a single valence bond connecting every neighboring pair of sites. Pictorially, this may be represented as File:AKLT GroundState.png Here the solid points represent spin 1/2s which are put into singlet states. The lines connecting the spin 1/2s are the valence bonds indicating the pattern of singlets. The ovals are projection operators which \\"tie\\" together two spin 1/2s into a single spin 1, projecting out the spin 0 or singlet subspace and keeping only the spin 1 or triplet subspace. The symbols \\"+\\", \\"0\\" and \\"‚àí\\" label the standard spin 1 basis states (eigenstates of the S^z operator). =Spin 1/2 edge states= For the case of spins arranged in a ring (periodic boundary conditions) the AKLT construction yields a unique ground state. But for the case of an open chain, the first and last spin 1 have only a single neighbor, leaving one of their constituent spin 1/2s unpaired. As a result, the ends of the chain behave like free spin 1/2 moments even though the system consists of spin 1s only. The spin 1/2 edge states of the AKLT chain can be observed in a few different ways. For short chains, the edge states mix into a singlet or a triplet giving either a unique ground state or a three-fold multiplet of ground states. For longer chains, the edge states decouple exponentially quickly as a function of chain length leading to a ground state manifold that is four-fold degenerate. By using a numerical method such as DMRG to measure the local magnetization along the chain, it is also possible to see the edge states directly and to show that they can be removed by placing actual spin 1/2s at the ends. It has even proved possible to detect the spin 1/2 edge states in measurements of a quasi-1D magnetic compound containing a small amount of impurities whose role is to break the chains into finite segments. =Matrix product state representation= The simplicity of the AKLT ground state allows it to be represented in compact form as a matrix product state. This is a wavefunction of the form : Psirangle = sum_{{s}} operatorname{Tr}[A^{s_1} A^{s_2} ldots A^{s_N}] s_1 s_2 ldots s_Nrangle. Here the As are a set of three matrices labeled by s_j and the trace comes from assuming periodic boundary conditions. The AKLT ground state wavefunction corresponds to the choice: : A^{+} = +sqrt{tfrac{2}{3}} sigma^{+} : A^{0} = -sqrt{tfrac{1}{3}} sigma^{z} : A^{-} = -sqrt{tfrac{2}{3}} sigma^{-} where sigma is a Pauli matrix.  Generalizations and extensions  The AKLT model has been solved on lattices of higher dimension, even in quasicrystals . The model has also been constructed for higher Lie algebras including SU(n), SO(n), Sp(n) and extended to the quantum groups SUq(n).

On March 6, 2011, the court issued an approval that Sony's lawyers were allowed access to all the IP addresses of all the people who visited geohot's blog for the purposes of establishing jurisdiction. Sony said the server logs would demonstrate that many of those who downloaded Hotz's hack reside in Northern California ‚Äî thus making San Francisco a proper venue for the case. On April 11, 2011, it was revealed that Hotz and Sony had reached a settlement out of court. This included a permanent injunction against Hotz doing any more hacking work on any Sony products to prevent any future firmware release from being decrypted. The claims (filed in United States district court for Northern California, San Francisco) were: *Violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act () *Violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act () *Contributory copyright infringement () *Violating California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (¬ß 502) *Breach of Contract (related to the PlayStation Network User Agreement) *Tortious interference *Misappropriation *Trespass Alleged Anonymous attacks in response to lawsuit In an act of hacktivism, Anonymous announced their intent to attack Sony websites in response to Sony's lawsuit and, specifically due to Sony's gaining access to the IP addresses of all the people who visited geohot's blog, terming it an 'offensive against free speech and internet freedom'. Although Anonymous admitted responsibility to subsequent attacks on the Sony websites, much speculation has arisen concerning a sustained collapse of the PlayStation Network in April 2011. Anonymous has denied any involvement in the PlayStation Network outage. However, Sony announced on May 4, 2011, \\"We discovered that the intruders had planted a file on one of our Sony Online Entertainment servers named \\"Anonymous\\" with the words \\"We are Legion.\\" See also * Electronic Frontier Foundation * George Hotz * Groklaw * Illegal number * Strategic lawsuit against public participation * Forum shopping References External links http://www.groklaw.net/staticpages/index.php?page=SonyHotz *http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-Network-Support/Questions- About-End-User-Safety-Concerning-New-Exploit/m-p/38690337 *https://blog.playstation.com/2011/04/11/settlement-in-george-hotz-case/ American bloggers Sony litigation Digital Millennium Copyright Act case law 2011 in United States case law Video game controversies ","title":"Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. v.

Geography  The lake is between the district centers of √áay, Bolvadin and Sultandaƒüƒ± of Afyon Province. The midpoint is at about . The altitude of the water surface with respect to sea level is . The surface area fluctuates and at times it may be exceed . In past the maximum recorded depth was .  Geology  Lake Eber is a part of Akar√ßay closed basin, a tectonic basin about . At the conclusion of the last glacier age (Pleistocene) a vast lake was formed in the basin. But after the water level dropped, the lake was fragmentized into two lakes. Lake Eber is at the north west and Lake Ak≈üehir which shares the same history lies at the south east. Presently the distance between the two lakes (nearest points) is about .Sketch of the Ministry of Tourism Lake Eber (Eber G√∂l√º) near √áayƒ±rpƒ±nar, Afyonkarahisar Province; View from the south.  Tributaries  The tributaries are rivulets from the Sultan Mountains at the south. When the level increases beyond a certain level the water is fed to the nearby lower level Ak≈üehir lake by a channel (Eber channel).  Ecology  The main plants of the lake are Typha latifolia, Phragmites australis, Lycopus europaeus and Mentha aquatica. The lake is known for the reed beds.

Her father was a Member of Parliament.Duncan J. D. Smith, Rosita Forbes Biography (2009), at Slideshare. Career During the First World War she drove an ambulance in France for two years.

The result was her first book, Unconducted Wanderers (1919). The next year, she disguised herself as an Arab woman named \\"Sitt Khadija\\" to visit the Kufra Oasis in 1921, the first European woman (and only the second European) known to have seen that location. The way she portrayed her travel guide, Hassanein Bey, as a minor part of the journey was criticized by her book's reviewers and his colleagues, who pointed out that he was an Oxford-educated diplomat.Arita Baasjens, Desert Songs: A Woman Explorer in Egypt and Sudan (American University of Cairo Press 2008): 44-45. ISBN In 1937, Forbes was the second Westerner and first Western woman to visit places from Sahara to Samarkand, which is today are in Libya to Uzbekistan. She had a gift of a genuine traveller; she lived and mixed with the locals, made friends with the Afghans, Indians, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Kazaks and Afghans and bonded well with the natives although she was, most of the time, the only woman during the journey. The journey is described in her travelogue called The Sahara to Samarkand. Rosita Forbes found an audience as a daring and witty travel writer and lecturer between the wars, and as a novelist; but her reputation was somewhat tarnished in the 1930s by her description of walking through a flower garden with Adolf Hitler, and her meetings with Benito Mussolini.H.

She published a book of interviews in 1940, These Men I Knew, insisting that she was only reporting their politics, not endorsing them; she also lectured in support of the British war effort in Canada and the United States. Soon, the McGraths went to live in the Bahamas to avoid further controversy. Forbes was made a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and received medals from the Royal Antwerp Geographical Society and the French Geographical Society, and an award in 1924 from the Royal Society of Arts. She also made an early travel film, From Red Sea to Blue Nile, and two of her novels became silent films (Fighting Love (1927) and The White Sheik (1928), based on her novels If the Gods Laugh and Account Rendered, respectively).

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 24, 2011. The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by series cast member, Steve Carell. The episode marks Carell's third director's credit for the series and the final physical appearance of Amy Ryan, having appeared as a regular since \\"Classy Christmas\\". In the episode, Michael (Steve Carell) decides to propose to Holly (Amy Ryan), and runs into trouble thinking of how to do it well with his expensive diamond ring. He consults several coworkers on advice and for ideas on how to propose. Meanwhile, Dunder Mifflin Scranton's warehouse and crew hosts a public garage sale. \\"Garage Sale\\" was met with critical acclaim by both television reviewers as well as fans. Furthermore, HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the episode could have served as Carell's last episode. It is considered one of the best episodes of The Office. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by more than 7 million viewers and received a 3.4 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 which marked a slight rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Todd Packer\\". Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell) decides to propose to Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and runs into trouble thinking of how to do it in the most elaborate way possible with his expensive diamond ring (which cost what he believes is the traditional \\"three years' salary\\"). He pours gasoline in the parking lot in the shape of letters, planning to light them on fire and show it to Holly. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) stops it and gathers a meeting of Michael, herself, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez). They believe Holly truly is \\"the one\\" for him and give him anecdotes and ideas. They are shocked at Michael's suggestion, particularly one where he throws a corpse dressed as him off the roof, and are stunned at his huge engagement ring. He calls Holly's father to ask his permission (although he leaves a message rather than speak to him personally). Holly catches onto the idea when she calls her parents herself, but she notices her parents seem mentally disoriented. She talks to Michael later and says she wants to move back to Colorado to be there for her dad, and Michael supports her decision. Holly seems to be gearing up for a proposal, but Michael abruptly leaves, not wanting to be proposed to in such a casual way. Dunder Mifflin Scranton's warehouse and crew host a public garage sale. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) attempts to walk away with the most expensive item by trading smaller items with his office mates beginning with a thumbtack (a reference to One red paperclip) and continuously trading up from table to table. One item on Jim and Pam's table that piques his interest is a packet of \\"miracle legumes.\\" Jim claims he received them from a mysterious old man on vacation, and that they keep reappearing on his table whenever he puts them away. Dwight initially believes Jim is trying to prank him, but is astonished when they reappear after Jim had seemingly destroyed the packet. Eventually, his curiosity gets the better of him and he trades Jim a $150 telescope for the legumes. At the end of the episode, Dwight plants and waters the seeds and Jim secretly replaces the pots with full-grown plants. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) play and bet on the Dallas board game, which Kevin had for sale. As the instruction booklet is not with the game, Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along; when Kevin objects, Andy simply claims \\"that's Dallas.\\" Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy look at each other in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras that he has the money, stating, \\"And that... is Dallas\\", mocking Andy's previous statement. Michael takes Holly on a walk through the office, pointing out the locations of various events throughout their courtship. He opens the door to the kitchen, revealing all of the other employees holding candles. Various members of the office ask Holly if she will marry them (all of Michael's plan) and she politely says no. Michael then leads Holly out to her desk, which is surrounded by dozens of candles. Michael gets down on his knee and begins to make a speech when the sprinklers go off from the candles. The water drenches everyone in the office and Michael proposes. Holly accepts. Everyone then begins to congratulate Michael. However, Michael announces he is moving to Colorado with Holly, leaving his employees in shock. Production This episode was written by consulting producer Jon Vitti, his second writing credit of the series since joining the staff at the beginning of the seventh season. It was directed by series star Steve Carell, the third episode he has directed for the series. The episode marked Amy Ryan's last physical appearance on the series, although she did speak in \\"Goodbye, Michael\\". Ryan later said in an interview with New York that \\"The script was so sweet anyway that it made us all have a good cry\\" especially adding the fact that it was her final appearance. She also expressed her confidence that the series could survive without Carell and that it was the right move for him to leave. Vitti later submitted the episode for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, but it was not nominated. Cultural references \\"Garage Sale\\" features several callbacks to previous episodes. Kevin's skills at poker were previously shown in \\"Casino Night\\".

Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Garage Sale\\" was viewed by an estimated 7.07 million viewers and received a 3.4 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.4% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast.

HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall called it one of his \\"favorite Office episodes ever\\" and also called it one of the greatest romantic sitcom episodes of all-time. He also said the episode could have served as Carell's last episode, and praised \\"Garage Sale\\" for its multiple subplots, its exploration of the ensemble cast, and Jim's prank against Dwight. Sepinwall named it one of the best TV episodes of 2011 for series that were not great the whole year and praised it for showcasing \\"the ridiculous and romantic sides of The Office\\". He also wrote that it gave Fischer and Krasinski their best material for the series in years. Cindy White of IGN praised it for its mix of comedy and drama. She also complimented it for the showcase of the cast, ultimately giving the episode a 9/10. James Poniewozik of Time said it \\"was unspectacular as an episode overall but did build to a delightful moment as Michael finally proposed to Holly\\", later naming it one of his honorable mentions for the top 10 TV episodes of 2011. The A.V. Club writer Myles McNutt called the episode a \\"spiritual successor to 'Casino Night', which remains one of my all-time favorite episodes of the series\\" for \\"turning what could feel like a gimmicky sitcom scenario into something that feels distinct to both the office [the characters] ... and The Office\\". He ultimately gave the episode an A-. Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic compared the proposal to other television proposals on Friends, Cheers and Frasier. New York writer Willer Paskin praised the writers for being adept at writing for romance.

The video quality is decreased to allow non authorized users to see video with lower degree of detail in cases where extra costs or licensing is required to view the full resolution source.  Examples  Some videos, such as films, require that a person has a license in order to view or share the content. The owners or creators of the content may not want the public to have access to the full resolution version as that might encourage unauthorised use or distribution of the media. Such behaviour could lead to a monetary loss for the owners. Furthermore, use of the media in other works might lead to the creators being uncredited. Therefore, licensing can also act as a form of permissions, blocking unfavoured parties from abusing the content. To reduce the resolution of video, the frame of image being shown is rendered in memory with a lower fidelity or detail. Compression techniques may also be used to make the content visibly different than the source. Media that is royalty free or public domain usually do not have any constrictions. Instead of lowering resolution, hindrances such as watermarks may also be used to disincentivize people from accessing or using the content freely.  Implementation  Constriction can be executed through rather rudimentary software, although it can be accelerated using a video card. Compression is an easy way to lower fidelity, and as a result also reduces the file size, which may help in distributing the media to multiple unlicensed parties.

Cosmetics is an American cosmetics brand based in Oakland, California. It was founded by Joseph Shamah and Scott Vincent Borba in 2004. Items include bath and skin-care products, mineral-based makeup, professional tools, eyeliners, lipstick, glosses, blushes, bronzers, brushes, and mascara, among others. According to the company, its products are 100% \\"cruelty-free\\", and it supports PETA's no fur campaign. e.l.f. Cosmetics' products have been reviewed in Glamour, Allure, Self, InStyle, and Good Housekeeping, and are sold in 17 countries, and in several stores including Target, Kmart, Dollar General, and Walmart. Over half the company's sales come from its website, which doubles as a social networking site with over two million members. History and operations e.l.f. (short for EyesLipsFace) Cosmetics was founded by Joseph Shamah and Scott Vincent Borba in June 2004 with the assistance of Shamah's father, Alan. The duo originally met at a party in 2002; Shamah was a 23-year- old New York University business student. Borba was a 31-year-old Los Angeles beauty-industry veteran, responsible for previously launching brands such as Hard Candy cosmetics. Both were enthusiastic about an inexpensive, high- quality cosmetics line for women, and decided to form a company together. A few days after the party they sat down to brainstorm, and a business plan was created within months. Borba claims the idea originated from seeing women with expensive cars such as BMWs and Mercedes-Benzes buying bargain-price cosmetics at 99-cent stores in Los Angeles. On February 3, 2014, TPG Growth bought a majority stake in e.l.f. Cosmetics. Joey Shamah was replaced by Tarang P. Amin, who \\"has been appointed president, chief executive officer and director of e.l.f. Cosmetics\\". Products The company started with only 13 makeup products, but has since developed more than 300 products that include bath products, skin-care products, mineral-based makeup, professional tools, eyeliners, lipstick, glosses, blushes, bronzers, brushes, mascara, and many more. Most items cost $3. The variety of e.l.f. products allows the company to target a demographic with a broad age range, from teenagers to women in their 40s and 50s. The company carries different product lines, which include e.l.f. Studio, e.l.f. Minerals, and e.l.f. Essentials. There used to be e.l.f. Bath & Body, which includes moisturizers, cleanser, and fragrances. They have now stopped making those products. *e.l.f. Studio - makeup line includes professional makeup for professional makeup artists and consumers. *e.l.f. Minerals - consists of makeup made out of natural minerals. *e.l.f. Essentials - includes \\"every-day\\" makeup supplies at lower prices, in an effort to be affordable. Sales =Retail= e.l.f. Cosmetics is currently available in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom , Saudi Arabia, France, Colombia, and Spain. Products can be purchased at regional drug chains across the United States and Canada. e.l.f products are most commonly found in Target. In March 2010, e.l.f.'s $1 and Studio line of products were placed in over 700 Target stores, with most individual items prices at $1 and $3. Another Target expansion to include most outlets happened in March 2011. Other stores include Kmart, Dollar General, and Walmart. e.l.f. is also sold at various supermarkets and women's apparel discount retailers, often in four-tiered spinners or \\"fish bowls\\" in impulse-buy sections. =Website= History In 2004, the company was having only partial success stocking its products in retail stores, including dollar stores. Glamour magazine wanted to feature an e.l.f. product, but told the company they couldn't unless the product was nationally available for their 2 million- person readership base. e.l.f. Cosmetics at that point had a website intended as a product showcase, and that year it relaunched the site as an e-commerce site, quickly shipping out thousands of orders. Since the premiere of the new site, e.l.f. products have been featured in Glamour over seven times. The website is now the brand's primary sales vehicle, and accounted for approximately 50% of all sales in 2008. Features In June 2007, e.l.f. launched a beauty blog and advice column that touts products (not only e.l.f.) and talks about celebrity sightings. Since then, the length of customer visits to the website has tripled. All product pages on the site host a \\"chat now\\" button that lets customers connect directly with one of the company's in-house professional makeup artists. The site hosts a \\"virtual makeover lab\\", where customers can digitally test products on models or their own photos. Customers can create a personal profile, publish and comment on blogs, converse with other customers, and access a beauty encyclopedia. They can also create a \\"beauty profile\\", and are recommended e.l.f. products according to their skin type, hair and eye colors, and typical beauty regimen. Also included is the option to create a wish-list that connects to Facebook, or view educational web videos on makeup techniques and styles. The website currently includes over two million members. Promotions In 2007, the company began to invest heavily in email marketing, and its weekly email campaigns are considered by eCommerce-Guide to be the company's strongest promotion. The company offers a near-constant supply of promotions to its customers, largely through its website. Subscribers on the mailing list can earn points or gift certificates for making web referrals that turn into sales transactions. Shamah claimed that as of September 2009, more than 500,000 friend referrals had come back to make a purchase. It also frequently hosts online events, and since 2010 has asked customers of all ages and ethnicities to submit to a casting resource to select a yearly model-representative for the brand. Four selected individuals are brought to New York City to receive makeovers from Achelle Dunaway, e.l.f.'s Creative Director and lead makeup artist, as well as participate in a photo shoot. There are various cash prizes for nominees, and the winner is dubbed \\"face of e.l.f.\\" Media presence e.l.f. products have been favorably reviewed in dozens of major magazines, including Glamour, Allure, Self, InStyle, and Good Housekeeping. A segment on e.l.f. has premiered on the Style Network as well. The business has been profiled by publications such as Entrepreneur, CNN, Retail Merchandiser, Information Week, and The Wall Street Journal. In December 2010, the e.l.f. product '100-Piece Endless Eyes Pro Eyeshadow Palet' was featured in \\"The O List: Holiday Edition\\" (\\"Oprah's Favorite Things\\") in Oprah Winfrey's O magazine. The magazine stated the set included \\"almost every color imaginable\\", and the product quickly sold entirely out of stock. In January 2011, e.l.f. reintroduced the product at half price, or $10. Campaigns =Breast cancer funds= During October 2004, just months after its founding, e.l.f. donated 20% of the proceeds from its 'Shimmering Facial Whip' to Win Against Breast Cancer's research and facilities. It also provided \\"Color Therapy Care Packages\\" to breast cancer patients in inner-city hospitals in Los Angeles. =PETA= The brand only uses products that are \\"cruelty-free\\". In 2007, it was announced that e.l.f. was selling tweezers in a faux leather case that read \\"e.l.f. Professional Supports PETA in the Fur Free Campaign. 50% of the proceeds from sales of these tweezers go straight to PETA!\\" CEO Joseph Shamah later earned PETA's \\"Trail-Blazer Award\\", given for \\"compassion and commitment to never testing on animals.\\" =2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami= e.l.f.

Beeckestijn is a historical buitenplaats (summer house) dating from the 18th century in a park by the same name in Velsen-Zuid, Netherlands. History The park. Under the pond is a bunker from the Atlantikwall. The Beeckestijn site was a buitenplaats in the 15th and 16th centuries before the current English-style garden was designed in the 18th century. The house and the accompanying gardens are listed for varying reasons in the National register of monuments. The original design of the current garden plan from 1772 was preserved in an engraving by the landscape designer Johann Georg Michael (1738-1800), who also designed the neighboring park Waterland. He was assisted by the painter and designer Johann Heinrich M√ºntz. They were commissioned by the owner Jacob Boreel who had visited England and wished for a garden in the style of Stowe, Kewe Gardens and Wimpole. The gardens were partially redesigned in 1936 by the landscape designer Leonard Springer (1855-1940). Throughout the park are three bunkers from World War II that were sunk after the war by pumping the sand beneath them away. One of these bunkers is below the shell pond near the rear of the house. The house had various owners until being bought by the Trip family in the 17th century. Jan Trip the younger expanded the house to its present state in 1716-1721. The main building seen today has a sculpture on the facade and some stuccos within by Ignatius van Logteren (1685-1732).Rijksmonument report The house was occupied as a residence until 1924 when it fell into disuse. In 1939 it was used by a Dutch regiment who caused a lot of damage, and in 1941 it was occupied by German infantry. In 1942 the three Atlantikwall bunkers were built in the garden. After the war the house was occupied by Canadians before becoming the property of Jonkvrouwe Agnes Cremer-Boreel who sold it to Velsen. The restoration was completed in 1969 and the property opened as a museum, with a yearly garden festival and a yearly pop festival taking place there. In 2006 the museum with rooms in the style of the owner Jacob Boreel was closed. The property now belongs to the Vereniging Hendrick de Keyser, which restores and manages other heritage sites in the area. Beeckestijn is due to reopen as a museum of landscape, due to its importance as a relic of Dutch garden history, as well as its role in the nearby water management history (the house was originally on the Wijkermeer).

Snail rice noodle) is a Chinese noodle soup and specialty of Liuzhou in Guangxi, China. The dish consists of rice noodles boiled and served in a soup. The stock that forms the soup is made by stewing river snails and pork bones for several hours with black cardamom, fennel seed, dried tangerine peel, cassia bark, cloves, white pepper, bay leaf, licorice root, sand ginger, and star anise. It usually does not contain snail meat, but it is instead served with pickled bamboo shoot, pickled green beans, shredded wood ear, fu zhu, fresh green vegetables, peanuts, and chili oil added to the soup. Diners can also add chili, green onions, white vinegar, and green peppers to suit their taste. The dish is served in small \\"hole-in-the-wall\\" restaurants, as well as luxury hotel restaurants. In the late 2010s, many luosifen restaurants have opened in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, as well as in other countries such as the US. History The origin of luosifen is not certain, but many believe it originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. There are three legends that attempt to explain its origin. =First legend= According to a legend in the 1980s, some starving tourists traveled to Liuzhou in the evening and came across a rice noodle restaurant that was closed; however, the owner still served them. The bone soup, usually the main soup, was out of order, and only snail soup was available. The owner poured cooked rice noodles into the snail soup and served the tourists with vegetables, peanuts, and a bean curd stick side dish. The tourists liked the dish, which led to the owner improving the recipe and production process, slowly shaping the prototype of snail noodle soup. There is not much information about the snail soup rice noodles, the cradle of the snail soup rice noodles, or its exact origin. It is known that it has a strong Luosifen complex and rice complex of Liuzhou, which accidentally created luosifen. =Second legend= In the mid 1980s, there was a dry cut powder grocery store on Jiefang South Road in Liuzhou. After studying in the morning, the shop's clerk decided to boil rice noodles with snails for breakfast. It is speculated that the old woman's snail stall is inside the goldfish lane of Jiefang South Road. The lady thought the noodle soup was delicious, so she started to sell it as the \\"snail noodle\\". After years of improvement by local operators, the authentic Liuzhou snail noodle soup was created. =Third legend= In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the folk commercial trade in Liuzhou began to recover slowly from the Cultural Revolution. The Liuzhou workers' cinema was very popular during this time. Driven by the strong audience of these films, the night market of gubu gradually formed. Some people came up with an idea for a second night market: spiral lions and rice cooked together as food. After a film was over, customers accidentally asked the shopkeeper to add oil, water, and snail soup powder to the mixture. Over time, the recipe was perfected to suit the needs of customers, and the snail noodle dish gradually took shape. As the first original snack in Liuzhou, snail noodle soup has gradually become a landmark food in Liuzhou and even Guangxi. = Recent development = Instant luosifen Mass production of packaged luosifen started in late 2014, making it a nationwide household food. The yearly sales of packaged luosifen reached 6 billion yuan in 2019. Sales of packaged luosifen increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Dish preparation  Luosifen noodles are rice noodles that are boiled and placed in a soup or broth that consists of local river snails and pork bones. The broth is boiled with river snails and pork bones for three to ten hours; the snails give it a mild, sweet flavor. Other ingredients can be boiled for the broth, including black cardamom, fennel seeds, dried tangerine peel, cassia barks, salt, pepper, bay leaves, licorice roots, sand ginger, and star anise. The noodles can be made from older rice noodles for a chewier and firmer texture. Fried dried bean curd sticks, pickled bamboo shoots, black fungus, lettuce, peanuts, and preserved cowpeas can be added for flavor. These are the most common ingredients used in restaurants that serve these \\"smelly\\" noodles. The dish itself does not contain snail meat. Instead, the dish consists of other types of meat or seafood, as well as vegetables like cabbages. At restaurants and food stalls, customers can order their noodles with pork, beef, chicken, shrimp, or other meat and seafood. Additions like chili oil and pickles can enhance the dish. It is difficult to cook the dish, and recipes are rare. The easiest way to receive luosifen is at restaurants or by ordering prepackaged portions online or at a local market. Due to the limited information available, it is difficult to discern the authentic recipe. Many restaurants use tomatoes, leafy greens, diced chicken, chili oil, and chestnuts to enhance and balance the flavor. Others make it spicy by adding more peppers or chili. Some use sesame oil, red chili, jalape√±os, tofu, cumin, and other spices to bring out the pungent flavor of the noodles and broth. Prepackaged instant luosifen noodles are prepared like instant ramen. The consumer boils water and adds the prepared sauce or other vegetables that comes with the package. =Ingredients= Luosifen can be topped with pig's trotters, duck feet, fermented bamboo shoots, and fried tofu skin. The ingredients of snail powder are sour bamboo shoots, yuba, fungus, peanuts, and dried radishes. Some powder stalls have sauerkraut, head vegetables, and shallots. Green vegetables are also an important ingredient for snail powder. Side dishes include duck feet, tofu, sausage, and marinated eggs. In the summer, stalls sell water spinach and Chinese cabbage, and, in winter, they sell lettuce, Yau Ma vegetables, mushrooms, cauliflower, and pea seedlings. =Preparation= The dish is based on rice noodles and various ingredients including bamboo shoots, Guda ears (a particular type of lignicolous mushrooms), fried peanuts, tofu, huanghuacai, fresh salad, and river snails, accompanied by sour-spicy seasonings. Luosifen soup also contains pork bones with spices, which are stewed for about two hours. The main ingredient of the soup is dried Liuzhou rice noodles. Unlike others, Liuzhou rice noodles are produced only with aged rice that has already lost its fat and gelatin component; this is why they are cooked al dente. They are immersed in cold water before they are added to the soup.  Location  A bowl of luosifen served with pig's trotters in Beijing. Luosifen in Oakland, California Luosifen noodles are a combination of Han, Miao, and Dong cuisine. From the Guangxi Zhuang region in South China, they are exported to other parts of China, the US, and Canada. When the noodles are exported to the US, they are sold in ready-to-cook packages. Luosifen is popular in Guangxi Zhuang due to the region's ethnic diversity. Liuzhou is known for luosifen noodles. In Vietnam, a variation of luosifen ‚Äì B√∫n ·ªëc ‚Äì is served. Originating in Hanoi, B√∫n ·ªëc is a snail-based noodle dish usually served with fried green banana and fried tofu. It is served as a side-dish or appetizer rather than a main course. B√∫n ·ªëc can be found in nooks, street food stalls, and luxury restaurants. Traditional luosifen noodles are also sold. Luosifen can also be found in luxury restaurants worldwide. Some were first established in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong; they have also developed overseas. Altogether, there are over five thousand luosifen restaurants in China, Canada, and the United States. Seattle is one American city that has luosifen restaurants. The dish can vary depending on the region. Most variations stay true to the base, while adding different toppings and proteins, including preserved vegetables, soy products, egg, pork knuckles, and duck feet. Luosifen noodles are also becoming popular worldwide through Chinese online store Taobao, which is one of the world's top-10 most visited websites. The store hosts 5,000 luosifen noodle shops and sells a daily average of 200,000 noodle packs.

While the week is overseen by the Council of Europe, it is each local and regional community which organizes events centered on the selected theme.  Background  The week of October 15 is chosen every year for European Local Democracy Week as the European Charter of Local Self-Government was opened for signature by member states on that date in 1985 and the date is considered symbolic for European Local Democracy. In recognition of the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the Conference of Local and Regional Authorities (the predecessor to today's Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, the first European Local Democracy Week took place in 2007. Each year has had a unique and relevant theme for each community to work with which are very important on the local level with past themes including the issue of Sustainability on the local level. The theme for the European Local Democracy Week in 2011 was human rights at the local level. While the themes are universal for all of the local and regional communities, each community can interpret the theme is a manner that is more relevant to their specific needs. Events and activities organized can include poster campaigns, interactive websites, public meetings, exchanges, Open Days or specifically targeted events for different groups of people like children. The leading theme in 2012 was human rights make for more inclusive communities. In 2012, some 150 partners from 29 countries joined the ELDW. For the first time, municipalities in Morocco and Tunisia also registered as ELDW partners, in order to strengthen local democracy. A total of 342 activities and events were organised by towns, cities, regions, national and international associations.

It serves as the operations center for all coastal regions of Canada and the United States, except Hawaii, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. Headquartered in Palmer, Alaska, it is operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NTWC detects and analyzes earthquakes worldwide, issuing warnings to local officials in the hazard zones about the advisability of evacuating low-lying coastal areas and moving ships to deep water. History Following the March 27, 1964 Alaska earthquake and tsunami, the NTWC (formerly known as The Palmer Observatory) was established in 1967 in Palmer, Alaska, under the auspices of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. This earthquake alerted State and Federal officials that a facility was necessary to provide timely and effective tsunami warnings and earthquake information to the coastal areas of Alaska. Congress provided funds in 1965 to construct two new observatories and establish a tsunami warning system in Alaska. The first observatory constructed was at the U.S. Naval Station on Adak Island in the Andreanof Islands in the Central Aleutians. The City of Palmer, in the Matanuska Valley 42 miles northeast of Anchorage, was selected as the site for the primary observatory due to its proximity to bedrock for instrumentation and to communications facilities. Construction of the observatory installations, the task of engineering and assembling the data systems, and the hookup of the extensive telecommunications and data telemetry network was completed in the summer of 1967. With the dedication of the Palmer Observatory on September 2, 1967, the Alaska Regional Tsunami Warning System (ARTWS) became operational. Originally, the tsunami warning responsibility for Alaska was shared by the three observatories located at Palmer, Adak and Sitka. Sitka, a seismological observatory since 1904, and Fairbanks were the only two seismic stations operating in Alaska in 1964. The responsibilities of Adak and Sitka were limited to issuing a tsunami warning for events occurring within 300 miles of their location. In later years, the responsibility to provide tsunami warning services for Alaska was transferred from the Adak and Sitka observatories to the Palmer Observatory. Sitka and Adak Observatories were eventually closed in the early 1990s, although the seismic instrumentation is still maintained. In 1973, the Palmer Observatory was transferred to the National Weather Service's Alaska Region and changed its name to Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (ATWC). In 1982, its area of responsibility (AOR) was enlarged to include the issuing of tsunami warnings to California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia for potential tsunamigenic earthquakes occurring in their coastal areas. In 1996, the responsibility was again expanded to include all Pacific-wide tsunamigenic sources that could affect the California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska coasts, and the name was changed to the West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WC/ATWC) to reflect those new responsibilities. In 2003, a new Tsunami Warning Center building was constructed in the yard of the original building. This new facility was the first LEED certified building in the state of Alaska, and within the U.S. Department of Commerce. LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification is granted by the U.S. Green Building Council, and awards environmentally sensitive construction practices. This new facility provides upgraded power and communications capability, as well as office space for the expanded staff, assuring that the center will continue to provide quality products to the public well into the future. Following the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in late 2004, the WC/ATWC expanded its scope to the U.S. Atlantic coast, and the Atlantic coast of Canada. On 1 October 2013, the name was changed to the National Tsunami Warning Center (NTWC) to reflect this expanded geographical zone of responsibility. Overview of operations To accomplish its mission of providing accurate and timely tsunami bulletins to its area-of-responsibility (AOR) ‚Äì which includes Canadian coastal regions, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and the ocean coasts of all U.S. States except Hawaii ‚Äì the NTWC detects, locates, sizes, and analyzes earthquakes worldwide. Earthquakes that activate the Center's alarm system initiate an earthquake and tsunami investigation which includes the following four basic steps: automatic locating and sizing the earthquake; earthquake analysis and review; sea level data analysis to verify the existence of a tsunami and to calibrate models; and disseminating information to the appropriate emergency management officials. Tsunami bulletins are issued to state/province departments of emergency services; federal disaster preparedness agencies; National Weather Service offices; Canada's Atlantic Storm Prediction Center; Federal Aviation Administration offices; the U.S. Coast Guard; military bases; local emergency managers; United States Geological Survey offices; and many other recipients located in the U.S. and Canada. Earthquakes large enough to be felt near the coast, but below the tsunami warning/watch/advisory threshold size, prompt informational statements to the same recipients as warnings to help prevent needless evacuations. In addition to its basic functions, the Center conducts a community preparedness program intended to increase public awareness of the tsunami hazard and improve tsunami planning at the community level. The Center also actively pursues developmental projects which enhance tsunami warning operations. The Center operates 24 hours every day with two watchstanders on duty. Center personnel are notified of activity by an alarm system which is activated by several methods: * Sustained, strong oscillatory motion at individual seismometers. * Activation by multiple earthquake arrivals observed in sectors of the globe within a specified time interval. * Activation by a real-time seismic processing system when an earthquake exceeds a predetermined magnitude threshold for various regions throughout the world. * Deep ocean tsunami sensor detection of an event. Bulletins Depending on the seismic data (Message Definitions), NTWC will issue the following types of bulletins: =Warning= A tsunami warning is issued when a tsunami with the potential to generate widespread inundation is imminent, expected, or occurring. Warnings alert the public that dangerous coastal flooding accompanied by powerful currents is possible and may continue for several hours after initial arrival. Warnings alert emergency management officials to take action for the entire tsunami hazard zone. Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include evacuating low-lying coastal areas, and moving ships to deep water when there is time to safely do so. Warnings may be updated, adjusted geographically, downgraded, or canceled. To provide the earliest possible alert, initial warnings are normally based only on seismic information. =Advisory= A tsunami advisory is issued when a tsunami with the potential to generate strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is imminent, expected, or occurring. The threat may continue for several hours after initial arrival, but significant inundation is not expected for areas under an advisory. Appropriate actions to be taken by local officials may include closing beaches, evacuating harbors and marinas, and moving ships to deep water when there is time to safely do so. Advisories are normally updated to continue the advisory, expand/contract affected areas, upgrade to a warning, or cancel the advisory. =Watch= A tsunami watch is issued to alert emergency management officials and the public of an event which may later impact the watch area. The watch may be upgraded to a warning or advisory ‚Äì or canceled ‚Äì based on updated information and analysis. Therefore, emergency management officials and the public should prepare to take action. Watches are normally issued based on seismic information without confirmation that a destructive tsunami is underway. =Information statement= A tsunami information statement is issued to inform emergency management officials and the public that an earthquake has occurred, or that a tsunami warning, watch or advisory has been issued for another section of the ocean. In most cases, information statements are issued to indicate there is no threat of a destructive tsunami and to prevent unnecessary evacuations as the earthquake may have been felt in coastal areas. An information statement may, in appropriate situations, caution about the possibility of destructive local tsunamis. Information statements may be re-issued with additional information, though normally these messages are not updated. However, a watch, advisory or warning may be issued for the area, if necessary, after analysis and/or updated information becomes available. This definition applies to Mass News Dissemination Product Types, Tsunami Information Statements, and Tsunami Seismic Information Statements. =Cancellation= A final product indicating the end of the damaging tsunami threat. A cancellation is usually issued after an evaluation of sea level data confirms that a destructive tsunami will not impact the warning, advisory, or watch area. Deep-ocean tsunami detection In 1995, NOAA began developing the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) system. By 2001, an array of six stations had been deployed in the Pacific Ocean.Historical DART Background Information Beginning in 2005, as a result of the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, plans were announced to add 32 more DART buoys to be operational by mid-2007.U.S. ANNOUNCES PLAN FOR AN IMPROVED TSUNAMI DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM These stations give detailed information about tsunamis while they are still far off shore. Each station consists of a sea-bed bottom pressure recorder (at a depth of 1000‚Äì6000 m) which detects the passage of a tsunami and transmits the data to a surface buoy via acoustic modem.

Generalizations and comparisons to other bounds  For generalizations see Freedman (1975) and Fan, Grama and Liu (2012) for a martingale version of Bennett's inequality and its improvement, respectively. Hoeffding's inequality only assumes the summands are bounded almost surely, while Bennett's inequality offers some improvement when the variances of the summands are small compared to their almost sure bounds. However Hoeffding's inequality entails sub-Gaussian tails, whereas in general Bennett's inequality has Poissonian tails. In both inequalities, unlike some other inequalities or limit theorems, there is no requirement that the component variables have identical or similar distributions.

In August 2015, Spartak Trnava announced his transfer to PAOK. He signed a 4-year contract. On 3 December 2015, Sabo was the MVP of a comfortable 6-2 away victory for PAOK over Chania, as Igor Tudor's team advanced to the next round of Greek Cup. Sabo scored three times, while Jairo, Giannis Mystakidis and Dimitris Pelkas marked the visitors' other three goals. He finished the season with PAOK having 24 appearances in all competitions with 3 goals. On 16 July 2016 it was announced that Sabo had signed a season-long loan deal with the side Beitar Jerusalem while the option of making the move permanent was set to ‚Ç¨400,000. Eventually, he changed his mind preferring to sign with 2.Bundesliga club VfL Bochum, but he had to overpass the legal issues due to his signing to Beitar Jerusalem. According to media, Sabo will continue his career with Beitar Jerusalem, as the Israeli club on 1 July 2017 activated the buy-out clause in the player's loan contract. On 1 May 2018, according to various sources, the administration of Beitar Jerusalem are in advanced talks with PAOK about making the loan move of Slovak defensive midfielder, permanent. The Israeli club was eager to pay an estimated amount of ‚Ç¨200,000 in order to secure the purchase of 26-year-old international at the end of the 2017-18 season.

In geomechanics, a tilt test is a simple test to estimate the shear strength parameters of a discontinuity. Two pieces of rock containing a discontinuity are held in hand or mounted in test equipment with the discontinuity horizontal. The sample is slowly tilted until the top block moves. The angle with the horizontal at onset of movement is called the tilt-angle. The size of the specimen is limited to 10‚Äì20 cm for hand-held tests, while machine-operated tilt test equipment may handle up to meter-sized samples. In the field, the angle can be determined most easily with an inclinometer as present in most geological or structural compasses. Tilt-angle The tilt-angle equals the material friction of the discontinuity wall plus the roughness i-angle (tilt-angle = œÜwall material + i) if no real cohesion is present (i.e. no cementing or gluing material between the two blocks), no infill material is present, the asperities do not break, and the walls of the discontinuity are completely fitting at the start of the test, while if the walls of the discontinuity are completely non- fitting, the tilt-angle equals the friction of the material of the discontinuity walls (tilt-angle = œÜwall material). If cementation or gluing material is present or asperities break, the tilt-angle represents a combination of the (apparent or real) cohesion and the friction along the discontinuity. If infill material is present, the tilt-angle is governed partially or completely by the infill, depending on the thickness of the infill and height of asperities.

It is located on Swiss territory. Most of the German long-distance trains on the Rhine Valley Railway end at Basel SBB station and run along the Connecting Line. Many Regional-Express trains of Deutsche Bahn (from Freiburg) and S-Bahn trains of the SBB GmbH (from Zell) also run over the Connecting Line to Basel SBB. History The railway line was authorised by Article 4 of an international agreement of 15 October 1869, concerning the construction and operation of the Gotthard Railway. The building of the Connecting Line was licensed by the Swiss federal government on 14 March 1870. On 3 November 1873 the line was opened, including a one-line bridge over the Rhine. Following an agreement between the then Swiss Central Railway and the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways, the Connecting Line was built as a joint line by both companies. The project was exclusively funded by the Central Railway, which became its owner and it is now owned by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). Since the railway reform, the rail infrastructure is managed exclusively by the SBB. SBB, Deutsche Bahn and many other companies operate on the line. The property boundary is at the 3.537 km chainage mark (at the north head of the Rhine bridge). Technology  Phase separation point at the Basel connecting line bridge The Basel Connecting Line, including railway Basel Baden station, Basel SBB station and Basel marshalling yard is equipped for Swiss locomotives without special technical equipment and can be used by services from Germany. The line is equipped with the German intermittent cab signalling system (Punktf√∂rmige Zugbeeinflussung) and the Swiss train protection system (Integra-Signum). Trains runs on the right, unlike elsewhere in the SBB network, in order to avoid the need to switch sides at Basel Baden station.

The line was officially opened on 30 October 1837, when an 8-carriage train was hauled by a steam locomotive between Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo. Until the construction of the Moscow ‚Äì Saint Petersburg Railway in 1851, it was the only passenger train line in Russia. In 1899 it was merged into the Moscow-Windau- Rybinsk Railways and now forms part of the Oktyabrskaya Railway. History The first railways in Russia were short and narrow-track lines with wooden and then steel rails, which were used in the 18th century to transport carriages with ore at numerous mines of the Urals. In particular, the Nizhny Tagil line built in 1833‚Äì1834 was equipped with a steam locomotive and could transport a few miners, together with the load of ore. The steam locomotive was constructed by the Russian engineers, father and son Cherepanovs. However, their design had not found application outside of their factory, and most hardware for the Tsarskoye Selo Railways, including rails, carriages, locomotives and railroad switches, was purchased abroad.–í–æ–∑–Ω–∏–∫–Ω–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≤–∞–≥–æ–Ω–æ–≤ The first European railways had demonstrated their great economic potential, and in August 1834, the Russian Mining Ministry invited Austrian-Czech engineer to explore the possibility of building railways in Russia. After several months of travel through the country, in January 1835 he submitted a written report to NicholasI and then met him in person, suggesting building railways between Moscow and St. Petersburg and then between Moscow, Kazan and Nizhny Novgorod. Gerstner's proposal was evaluated by a commission headed by Mikhail Speransky. The commission found the project feasible and recommended starting with a short railway between St. Petersburg, Tsarskoye Selo and the nearby Pavlovsk.

Construction Pavlovsk train terminal, 19th century Ball in Pavlovsk on the 25th anniversary of the Tsarskoye Selo Railway The construction and operation of the Tsarskoye Selo Railways was managed by a newly established joint-stock company headed by Count Alexander Bobrinsky (president), von Gerstner and businessmen Benedict Kramer and Ivan Konrad Plitt. The company had about 700 shareholders, both in Russia and in Europe. The work started in early May 1836 and was supervised by 17 engineers, some of whom were previously involved in railway construction in England. About 1800 workers were involved first and were then reinforced by 1400 soldiers. Aiming to promote the railways, the train terminal of Pavlovsk was built as an entertainment center. It regularly hosted evening festivities with invited celebrities, such as concerts of Johann Strauss II in 1856.Golyanov A. L. and Zakrevskaya G.

Test trips with steam locomotives started in November 1836 on a long section between Pavlovsk and the village of Bolshoe Kuzmino. Gerstner conducted those tests himself, with more than a hundred trips in the first week, and was mostly preoccupied with not hitting the wondering crowds of people who arrived to watch the curiosity. Passengers on one of those trips were NicholasI and his family. These tests demonstrated that the line could be operated through the Russian winter, proving the skeptics wrong. Operation Model of Russia's first main line passenger locomotive, built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Tsarskoye Selo Railway. The model is in the Russian Railway Museum. The first regular train left St. Petersburg on 30 October 1837 and in 35 minutes arrived in Tsarskoye Selo. This train of eight carriages was pulled by a steam locomotive, and its arrival was observed by numerous noble guests, including NicholasI. Regular service started in January 1838. Between January and April 1838, most trains were pulled by horses, and steam locomotives were used only on Sundays and public holidays. Beginning in April, horse power was eliminated, and almost 14,000 passengers were transported during the month. The trains ran without stops between St. Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo, and beginning in May 1838 were reaching Pavlovsk. All communication was first done by voice and whistle. An optical telegraph was installed in 1838. It consisted of piles separated by and a guard on duty in a shed nearby. Signals were set by raising 1, 2 or 3 black disks (daytime) or red lamps (night) on the pile and took about 30 minutes to transmit along the line. Electrical telegraph was installed in 1845, but it was dismantled in 1848 due to frequent failures; a more reliable system was set up in 1856. The first trips were unscheduled; a train schedule was introduced on 15 May 1838, with five trips per day between 9am and 10pm (7am and 11pm in summer). Trains left the opposite terminal stations simultaneously and would bypass each other at a specially designed crossing in the middle of the line. After a head-on collision of two trains on 11 August 1840, trains ran only one way at a time. Some passengers were allowed to travel with their small horse-pulled carriages, which were transported on the open platforms of the train. Smoking on the train was prohibited for reasons of safety; violators were removed from the train and their names reported to their employers. The same rules applied to drunkards. Smoking trains were introduced in 1857. A second, parallel line was laid in summer 1876 that increased the capacity of the railway. A train repair workshop was built around that time in St. Petersburg. The railway was profitable, with the ratio of profit to expenses about 1.7. The railway was operated by 236 employees, whose salary took about 22% of the company income. The line mostly transported people, with only about 5% cargo trains. The railway was absorbed by the much bigger Moscow-Windau-Rybinsk Railways in 1899‚Äì1900 and converted to the standard Russian gauge. Carriages By 1837 the railroads had 6 locomotives, 44 passenger carriages and 19 cargo carriages. In the 1830s‚Äì1840s, each train pulled 8 carriages at an average speed of about ; the speed increased to some in the 1870s. The locomotives of were purchased in England and Belgium. They weighed about and reached a top on-line speed of about . The carriages had wooden frames and two pairs of cast iron wheels with steel rims. Their bottom parts were built in England and the top in Belgium or Russia. The top (passenger part) was nailed to the wooden bottom frame. The carriages had no heating, and their top parts had four different designs. Their capacity varied between 30 and 42 passengers. Legacy Copper medal minted on the occasion of the opening of the Tsarskoye Selo Railway The Tsarskoye Selo Railway had a short length, very limited capacity, and nearly no industrial value ‚Äì it was mainly transporting nobles for sightseeing in Tsarskoye Selo and festivities in Pavlovsk. Yet it was regarded as an important step in the development of a rail network in Russia. In particular, experience demonstrated the drawbacks of the rail spacing, and the following rail networks used the more standard gauge tracks. In the 1840‚Äì50s, the Tsarskoye Selo Railway was actively used for training of railroad personnel and various locomotive and railroad tests. The opening of the Tsarskoye Selo Railway in 1837 was an extremely popular event, reflected in the news and in handicrafts and theater performances in Russia. A copper medal ( diameter) was minted to commemorate the opening of the railway. Its obverse featured PeterI, Minerva and NicholasI, as well as the text \\"The first railroad from St. Petersburg to Pavlovsk was opened on 30 October 1837. NicholasI, the follower of PeterI, introduced railways to Russia\\".

Issues  =Labor= Greenpeace accusations Thai Union Group has been accused by Greenpeace of being \\"seriously implicated in horrendous human rights and environmental abuses\\" and warned shareholders and investors \\"of the financial risks associated with these destructive and harmful practices.\\" The company faces a number of other legal challenges. Thai Union released a statement in response to the accusations made by Greenpeace in 2015. It reiterated its commitment to human rights and the company's vision of \\"an industry that respects the oceans and protects marine life, offers safe employment for millions of people around the world, supports the development of coastal communities and continues to provide a safe, affordable and healthy food source for a global population well into the future.\\" Thai Union also noted that it works closely with the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF) to \\"benefit the wider tuna fishing industry\\" and concluded by calling on Greenpeace to join the \\"industry debate that is already underway, to work towards achieving our shared objectives.\\" Slave labor and human rights Thai Union was named, but was not a defendant, in a lawsuit brought against Nestle Corporation for violating California laws. Thai Union has been under scrutiny since the July 2015 publication of a New York Times article citing a former fisher stating he had been held captive on a vessel supplying a mother ship that ended up selling to Thai Union's Songkhla canning operation. In a response to the New York Times, Thai Union re-asserted its commitment to the protection of human rights. A spokesperson stated the company worked to prevent \\"any human trafficking or any human rights violation of any kind\\" highlighting procedures that are in place, such as routine audits of its canneries and boats in port to ensure against forced and child labor. In 2015, Thai Union released new codes of conduct, replacing the company's 2013 code of conduct. The \\"more stringent\\" new code of conduct allows for higher levels of \\"accountability and transparency\\" and showcased Thai Union's commitment to \\"earn the trust of customers, consumers and the world by operating with integrity and high ethical standards\\". The company also claims to have terminated relationships with 17 suppliers as a result of forced labor or human trafficking violations since the start of 2015, and have ended the use of employment brokers to source for workers for its seafood processing plants to stop debt bondage. In December 2016, Thai Union and the World Tuna Purse Seine Organization (WTPO) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to establish a framework to ensure fair labor practices. The MOU includes the establishment and implementation of best practices on fair labor standards in operations. Slave labor in the shrimp industry Thailand's seafood industry, and by implication, Thai Union, was the subject of a year-long study of the Thai shrimp industry commissioned by Nestl√©. The report, conducted by Verit√© on behalf of Vevey- based Nestl√©, was released on 23 November 2015. It found \\"indicators of forced labor, trafficking, and child labor to be present among sea-based and land- based workers.\\" In a statement issued on 10 December 2015, Thai Union declared that it will cease working with all shrimp processing subcontractors by the end of 2015. The company said that it would bring all shrimp processing operations in-house to enable full oversight. All processing work will be directly controlled by Thai Union to ensure that all workers, whether migrants or Thai, have safe, legal employment and are treated fairly and with dignity. Thai Union estimates that subcontractors employ about 1,000 migrant workers. Andy Hall, a British human rights defender and a migrant worker specialist based in Thailand, said that \\"Thai Union ... must be commended for belatedly moving seafood primary processing in house.\\" Working conditions have shown to be improved for the workers that Thai Union brought in-house to its shrimp processing operations; with a clean working environment, subsidized meals, increased salaries, and opportunities for bonuses, time off work, and workers' rights. =Environment= Sourcing In October 2015 Greenpeace accused Thai Union subsidiary John West (UK) of making a \\"plainly false\\" claim that customers can trace its tuna back to the vessel that caught it. John West's website includes a tool that allows customers to enter the can code to \\"see exactly where your fish came from\\". The tool does not identify sources of Thai tuna and instead invites customers to email John West. John West said that the problem is a website limitation, and all its tuna is fully traceable. Greenpeace has also ranked John West last in sustainability surveys because 98 percent of its tuna was caught using \\"fish aggregation devices\\" that kill other marine wildlife. Thai Union has committed to the following by 2020: * Full traceability for all purchased seafood, reducing the risk of IUU fishing in the global fishing industry. Specific to its tuna business, Thai Union has committed to the following by 2020: * Digital traceability: We will work with innovative technology providers to develop a system for digital traceability. * Tuna sourcing policies: We will have aligned every one of our tuna sourcing policies everywhere in the world. We will publish these policies in line with our commitment to transparency. * Academic and scientific research: We will work with academic bodies, universities and scientific institutions to support research into fishery improvements. * Innovation: We have developed the Global Innovation Incubator in Thailand to look at all aspects of innovation and research into tuna from species to processing to packaging. * Post-harvest risk assessment: We will work with fishery experts to address the issues around tuna grading, utilization of non-target species and low-economic-value species, and care-of-catch to ensure high standards are met from harvest to plate. Thai Union Europe is working with WWF-UK and WWF France between 2014 and 2018 improve sustainability of seafood species, and working towards MMarine Stewardship Council (MSC) certification and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) certification across the Thai Union Europe supply chain. In December 2016, Thai Union announced a strategy to ensure 100 percent of its branded tuna is sustainably sourced with a commitment of achieving a minimum of 75 percent by 2020. As part of the new tuna strategy, Thai Union is investing US$90 million in initiatives that will increase the supply of sustainable tuna. This includes establishing 11 new fishery improvement projects (FIPs) around the world. In December 2016, eight of the world's largest seafood companies, including Thai Union, issued a 10-point statement committing to action on ocean stewardship following the first \\"keystone dialogue\\" between scientists and business leaders. The companies committed to improving transparency and traceability, and reducing illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in their supply chains. In December 2016, Greenpeace reported that the Thai Union subsidiary, Lucky Union Foods Co. Ltd. (LUF), purchased surimi base from Pacific Marine Food Products Co. Ltd., a company which confirmed that it had sourced from \\"vessels of concern\\". LUF also supplied shaped surimi to Thai Union Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TUM) for use in pet foods. In February 2017, Thai Union 2015 Sustainability Report earned the number one ranking in Asia for sustainability reporting in the Top 100 Seafood Firms' Transparency Benchmark from Seafood Intelligence, a global news service that reports on the seafood sector and evaluates the industry‚Äôs sustainability data and transparency levels. In March 2017, Thai Union and the United States Agency for International Development Oceans and Fisheries Partnership (USAID Oceans) announced a partnership to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, promote fair and ethical seafood supply chains, and improve the sustainability of fisheries in the Asia-Pacific region. In June 2017, at a World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in New York City, Thai Union committed to the WEF's Tuna 2020 Traceability Declaration. The declaration supports the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which were adopted by all 193 heads of state via a UN Resolution in September 2015 at a United Nations summit. In June 2017, Thai Union Group signed a pledge as part of its membership in the Seafood Business for Ocean Stewardship (SeaBOS), committing to improve operations as well as challenge the rest of the seafood industry to follow, all with the goal of helping the world achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In July 2017, Thai Union Group committed to measures that will tackle illegal fishing and overfishing, as well as improve the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the company's supply chains, in an agreement with Greenpeace. Greenpeace and Thai Union agreed to meet every six months to assess the company's progress and implementation. In October 2017, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between WWF, Thai Union Europe, ACTEMSA S.A., and Industrias Alimenticias Leal Santos LTDA, to launch a Fishery Improvement Project (FIP) for the pole and line skipjack, yellowfin, and bigeye tuna fishery in the south and southeast coastal areas of Brazil. The aim of the FIP is to meet the standards of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), which assesses whether a fishery is well-managed and sustainable. In December 2017, Thai Union Group introduced its Fishing Vessel Improvement Program and Vessel Code of Conduct (VCoC) to provide clear guidance to the fishing vessels from which the company sources as well as improve labor and ethical performance in the fishing sector. In March 2018, Thai Union Group joined forces with the Global Ghost Gear Initiative (GGGI) in a drive to reduce the growing problem of abandoned, lost, and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) worldwide. =Others= Bumble Bee Foods In December 2014 Thai Union announced it would spend US$1.5 billion to acquire Bumble Bee Foods. That deal was put in jeopardy after the US Department of Justice announced it began an anti-trust investigation into the company over-pricing and competitive practices. Thai Union abandoned its purchase plans in early-December 2015 after US officials objected on the grounds that it would reduce competition. \\"Consumers are better off without this deal,\\" Bill Baer, assistant attorney general of the US Department of Justice's anti-trust division, said....\\"Our investigation convinced us‚Äîand the parties knew or should have known from the get go ‚Äî that the market is not functioning competitively today, and further consolidation would only make things worse.\\" Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Emerging Markets In September 2017, Thai Union was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Emerging Markets for the fourth year in a row. Thai Union's sustainability strategy, SeaChange¬Æ, successfully drove the score with industry best-in-class 100th percentile rankings for Climate Strategy, Materiality, Human Capital Development, Health and Nutrition, Water Related Risks, and Policy Influence. FTSE4Good Emerging Index In January 2017, Thai Union was named to the FTSE4Good Emerging Index by FTSE Russell. The FTSE4Good Emerging Index is an extension of the FTSE4Good Index Series‚Äîthe latter of which launched in 2001 to help investors integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their investment decisions and as a framework for corporate engagement and stewardship.

C. Birch and T. O. Browning Herbert George Andrewartha 1907‚Äì1992 , Biographical Memoirs, Historical Records of Australian Science, vol.9, no.3, 1993. pp.259‚Äì268Andrewartha, Herbert George (1907‚Äì1992), Encyclopedia of Australian Science, www.eoas.info Early life Andrewartha was born the second of three children, on 21 December 1907 in Perth, Western Australia to George and Elsie. His father was a teacher, and the family moved frequently from school to school with the education department, in rural Western Australia. Andrewartha received his Bachelor of Agriculture from the University of Western Australia. He later received his doctorate from the University of Adelaide in 1972. Career Andrewartha became the most influential Australian ecologist, best known for attributing density- independent forces, such as weather, to be even more important than density- dependent factors in influencing population regulation. In 1933, Andrewartha began his studies on apple thrips, Thrips imagines, but later transitioned his studies to the plague grasshopper, Austroicetes, when he moved to Adelaide in 1935. This led to his first publication with his former student Charles Birch in 1941, \\"The influence of weather on grasshopper plagues in South Australia\\". In 1945, when his mentor James Davidson died, Andrewartha inherited 15 years of data collected on thrips population. After several years of statistical analysis of that data, Andrewartha and Birch demonstrated strong connections between thrips physiology, population levels, and other environment factors. This led to the publication of two major books, The Distribution and Abundance of Animals (1954) and The Ecological Web (1984). Through this work, Andrewartha and Birch found a new school of population ecology, which emphasized the role of environmental controls as opposed to a community- dependent approach based on density-dependent factors. The joint work of Andrewartha and Birch earned them the \\"Eminent Ecologist Award\\" from the Ecological Society of America, which had never before been presented jointly to two persons The following timeline depicts the scope of his employment, responsibilities and publications throughout his career‚Äî *1929 Entomologist in the Department of Agriculture of Western Australia *1933 Biologist, CSIR, Melbourne and worked the School of Agriculture and Forestry at the University of Melbourne *1935‚Äì1954 Entomologist at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute *1952 President of the Royal Society of South Australia (RSSA) *1954 The Distribution and Abundance of Animals published *1954‚Äì1962 ReaderIn 21st- century Australian Universities, the position of \\"Reader\\" is generally called \\"Associate Professor\\" in Animal Ecology, University of Adelaide *1961 Introduction to the Study of Animal Populations published *1961 Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science (FAA) *1962‚Äì1972 Professor of Zoology, University of Adelaide (Emeritus Professor 1973)Former Officers of the University of Adelaide, www.adelaide.edu.au *1984 The ecological web : more on the distribution and abundance of animals published Significant work *General theory of the distribution and abundance of animals *The ecology of Thrips imaginis *The ecology of Austroicetes cruciata *Diapause, period of suspended development in an invertebrate, or mammal embryo, especially during poor environmental conditions *The Queensland fruitfly Dacus tryoni Honours and awards Andrewartha received many prestigious awards including the Clarke Medal from the Royal Society of New South Wales, Verco Medal from the Royal Society of South Australia, and the Gold Medal from Australian Ecological Society in 1987.

Story  Mahabali, the king of the Daityas or Asuras, i.e., demons in the Treta Yuga, reached the zenith of power and fame. He owed his tremendous success and prosperity in life to his observance of an austere and virtuous lifestyle. He performed many ritual sacrifices or Yajna to consolidate his sway over the three worlds of the universe (Heaven, Earth and Underworld). Lord Vamana has blessed king Sri Mahabali on his request for three feet of mud; the mood of the deity in the temple is that of blessing the king Mahabali. Vishnu was immensely pleased with the goodness of Mahabali. He educated Bali about the demerits of pride and arrogance, which forbids man from optimum progress.

It was a purpose built housing cooperative and like others it was an experiment in building close-knit communities and as a way of helping single people and couples. It was dissolved in the 1990s and taken over by Hyde Housing Association (now The Hyde Group). Co-operative Thamesmead Housing Co-operative was established to address the lack of housing for vulnerable single people in the area. Applicants to live on the CO-op were interviewed in order to establish their housing needs and also their ability to co-exist with others in shared houses. New tenants were required to purchase a ¬£1 share in order to become a member of the co-operative, which entitled them to attend and vote in the annual general meeting, to elect or stand for the management committee, participate in the co-operative‚Äôs affairs and receive its services. The co-operative consisted of an enclave of 40 flats and 20 shared houses in red brick. The flats were intended for couples but not families and the houses were shared by 4 - 6 people, some having a purpose build disabled unit attached. The buildings were laid out in five courtyards with addresses in Blyth Road and Slocum Close. A hall and office were provided for purpose of holding meetings and managing the co-operative. Transfer to Hyde Housing Difficulties in running the co-operative as a stand-alone project led to the involvement of Hyde Housing Association, which took over the management of the properties around 1990. Later it was established that the transfer process had not been correctly handled, and the process was properly completed in the late 1990s. During the transition period the project ran under two names, the original Thamesmead Housing Co-Op and the ill-fated Hyde Housing version known as \\"Thamesmead Management Co-Op\\" at 29 Blyth Road, London, SE28 8LJ, which was not recognized by the responsible Government body \\"The Housing Corporation\\" and caused the delay in formal transfer to Hyde Housing. Among the founder members were Graham Simpson, who later became the last chair of the original co-op, Paul Clewlow, treasurer, and Dave O'Brien, all who had lived on the scheme for a number of years. In its death throes the co-op was subject to a large number of fraudulent housing applications from Nigerian applicants who saw it as a source of cheap student accommodation rather than the having the common goal of the original ethos and as a result the ethnic make-up consisted of 96% African 3% British and 1% Asian. This was wildly disproportionate and different to the local boroughs ethnicity and at that time made it stand out. Subsequently, Thamesmead as a whole has been the favored residential starting point in the UK for most arriving West Africans to the extent that it is now known locally as \\"Little Lagos\\".BBC \\"The fraud capital of the UK\\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8193884.stm The properties have continued as a shared housing scheme.

To ensure that it remained entirely waterproof, Moynat used a substance called Gutta-Percha to seal it. The construction of this trunk called on the involvement of specialist basket-makers and leather craftsmen. This extra light trunk (it weighed as little as 2 kg) was seen as an alternative to the heavier items of luggage made of cardboard or leather and as a convenient way of avoiding excess baggage fines. Wicker and sealed canvas gradually replaced the use of leather, and the invention of the trunk was such a success that in many countries around the world wicker trunks are still known today as Moynat trunks.

It is found on a number of different hosts, including economically important tropical fruit trees and various ornamental plants. Description The adult female has a yellowish segmented, flattened oval body about two millimetres long covered with mealy wax. There are a number of short waxy filaments projecting around the margin. The ovisac is well developed and visible underneath the posterior part of the body. Sometimes the wax looks like cotton wool and oozes drops of fluid.

It was discovered in Bradenton, Florida, in the United States in 1998 feeding on hibiscus, and four years later it had been detected on eighteen different plant species in the state. It has since been found in Texas and California and it is likely to become more widely distributed on the Gulf Coast, and perhaps also in crops grown under glass further north in the United States. The introduction of this species has caused damage to papaya cultivation in South India, especially in the states of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It has also invaded Assam - a northeastern state of India It was recently noted in R√©union in the Indian Ocean. Host plants The papaya mealybug feeds on over 55 plants in more than 25 genera. Economically important host plants include papaya, avocado, citrus, mango, cherry and pomegranate, as well as hibiscus, cotton, tomato, eggplant, peppers, beans, peas and sweet potato. The mango is more affected by the mango mealybug. Biology The adult female deposits up to six hundred eggs into her ovisac over a period of one to two weeks. The eggs hatch ten days later and the crawlers, which resemble miniature versions of the adult female, disperse. There are four instars in the females and five in the males. The fifth instar male is a pupa in which the nymph undergoes metamorphosis into a winged adult. Damage The papaya mealybug inserts its stylet into the epidermis of the leaf or the skin of fruit or stem and feeds on the plant sap. At the same time it injects a toxic substance into the plant which results in chlorosis, distortion, stunting, early leaf and fruit fall, the production of honeydew, sooty mould and possibly the death of the plant. Biological control Natural enemies of the papaya mealybug include the mealybug destroyer (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri), other lady beetles, lacewings and hoverflies. The larvae of several species of parasitoid wasp in the family Encyrtidae attack the papaya mealybug in its native range. In 1999, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Agricultural Research Service collected and reared four species of wasp from Mexico in a biological pest control experiment. They introduced them into Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and achieved a reduction of the papaya mealybug populations in both countries of over 95%.U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 2000.

Poverty According to figures in 2006, 6.6 million people are still living under poverty and a third of this figure, or 2 million people, are struggling with extreme poverty.http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR- Guatemala.pdf. Assessment of developmental results.. UNDP, 2008, p. 59. Moreover, despite a fall in extreme poverty during the 1990s, Guatemala‚Äôs dependency on exports and susceptibility to global price shocks such as the world coffee crisis and natural disasters such as the Tropical Storm Stan in 2005 has led to a subsequent increase of the poverty rate in 2004 and falling again in 2005.http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. Assessment of developmental results.. UNDP, 2008, p. 10. Notwithstanding a recent fall in the poverty rate, both external and natural events continue to exert great influence on poverty levels in Guatemala. Consequently, poverty alleviation work in tandem with risk management policies in Guatemala. Poverty and income inequality Ranked with the second highest inequality rate in Latin America, (Gini coefficient of 0.55),http://earthtrends.wri.org,Earth trend country profile. ., 2008 many disparities exist between different economic sectors and income groups, reflecting a large rich-poor divide in Guatemala. Further data has shown that only 3.8 percent of the country's total income is earned by the poorest 20 percent of the population, compared with the 60.6 percent earned by the richest 20 percent of the population http://earthtrends.wri.org,Earth trend country profile. P.2., 2008 Furthermore, income inequality in Guatemala is accentuated by regional differences, namely, 1) a large rural agrarian sector and 2) social exclusion. =Inequality and Agriculture= Agriculture is one of the primary sectors in Guatemala (22.2 percent of GDP), producing principal cash crops such as coffee, sugars and bananas.http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. Assessment of developmental results.. UNDP, 2008, p. 8. Together with other non-agricultural products, they contribute towards 75 percent of export earnings.http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. Assessment of developmental results.. UNDP, 2008, p. 57. The agricultural sector employs about 39 percent of the national workforce, resulting in suppressed wages and low productivity.http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. Assessment of developmental results.. UNDP, 2008, P. 9. This provides some explanation for the rural-urban dichotomy in living standards. This problem is made worse by subsistence agriculture, resulting in low productivity and value-addedness. As a result, meagre incomes push subsistence farmers into poverty. Moreover, a denial of access to credit for vital agricultural investment has often led to farmers sinking into a vicious poverty cycle which continues through generations. Local development through microfinance tools in Central America, Woodworth and Hiatt, P.99, 2008 Sudden and unexpected events such as natural calamities and adverse climate conditions can also threaten agricultural harvests. It is not a matter of coincidence that the rural poor often comprised a large portion of populations living within these danger zones. Understandably, the rural poor are not able to gather sufficient resources to mitigate such emergencies, such as insurance against risk. Hence, the occurrence of such events would have recurring effects on rural dwellers, pushing them into greater poverty. =Inequality and social exclusion= Poverty appears to be largely concentrated within the regional groupings in Guatemala. To illustrate, comparisons between urban, rural and indigenous, non-indigenous people have shown that the non-indigenous groups fare considerably better than their indigenous contemporaries, comparable on a similar level to the national average of Cameroon, which ranks 144th on global HDI rankings with a score of 0.0506(HDI).2006 Human Development report As a result of social exclusion, the Q‚Äôeqchi ethnic group's HDI is relatively lower than the national average of 0.560.Statistics, http://fita.org/countries/guatemala.html Furthermore, the 38 percent poverty rate experienced by the rural indigenous population is almost twice the national average of 21.9 percent and at least 20 percent greater than their urban contemporaries, highlighting a rural-urban divide in terms of development.http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. Assessment of developmental results.. UNDP, 2008, p. 9. In sum, the deprivation of the rural poor from opportunities of personal growth and development is a reflection of their disadvantaged economic circumstances. While the urban sector has been reaping relatively higher economic growth, the rural poor have been marginalized, bypassed and socially excluded from full economic participation in the Guatemalan economy.

Foreign debt Lastly, coupled with a high foreign debt totaling $5,496 million according to 2006 figures,http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. Assessment of developmental results.. UNDP, 2008, P. 7. the Guatemalan economy became even more depressed with this large sum of foreign debt obligation. This has been supported by various studies that pointed out how a large foreign debt could potentially deplete a country's capital stock, thereby reducing much-needed investment opportunities vital for economic growth.International Research Journal of Finance and Economics ISSN 1450-2887 Issue 20, External Debt and its Impact on Economic and Business Growth in Pakistan Hameed, Ashraf, Chaudhary,2008International Research Journal of Finance and Economics ISSN 1450-2887 Issue 20, External Debt and its Impact on Economic and Business Growth in Pakistan Hameed, Ashraf, Chaudhary,2008 However, the positive impact of economic growth on poverty reduction should be taken with a word of caution. While there is a positive GDP growth of 4.5 percent in that same fiscal year in Guatemala,http://www.undp.org/execbrd/pdf/ADR-Guatemala.pdf. Assessment of developmental results.. UNDP, 2008, p. 59. it has done little to reduce poverty. With economic growth bearing no absolute causality on poverty reduction, there is a need for the social determinants of poverty to be looked into.

Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, became among the school's famous graduates. Background Effendi are originally from Kurdish/Arab Sayyid family. The Hanafi Muslims which originated from Mecca then migrated into Abbasid then Seljuq territory ruling military family of the Oguz (Ghuzz) Turkish tribes that invaded South Western Asia in the 11th century and eventually founded an empire that included Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine and most of Iran. Their advance marked the beginning of Turkish power in the Middle East. Effendi family is the direct descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through Imam Zayd ibn Imam Zayn al-Abidin ibn Imam Hussain ibn Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib. Hassan Ali Effendi belonged to a respectable family with Turkish ancestry. His forefathers migrated from Hijaz Middle East and settled down to Hala Sindh in British India. While still very young, he lost his father and was brought up by his elder brother Umed Ali. As according to the tradition of the family, he was enrolled in a local madrassa to read and study the Qur'an and learn the basics of the Persian language. Upon the completion of this traditional education, Hassan Ali found work as a clerk in the office of the Deputy Collector of Naushahro. One of his Christian colleagues there persuaded him to learn English, a language that was at the time avoided by Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. Nevertheless, he devoted all his leisure hours to the pursuit of learning English and soon acquired reasonable proficiency in reading, writing and speaking English. Later, Effendi started to work for the Indus flotilla, a shipping company. In the mid-1860s, while he still worked for the company, a British judge from Karachi by the name of Middleton, happened to cross the Indus river by ferry, spending the night on the ferry boat in order to cross the following morning. Middleton found Hassan Ali Effendi reading an English book by the dim light of an oil lamp. Surprised to discover that the man was a Muslim, he was impressed enough to offer him a role as a translator in the Karachi District Court on the magnificent salary of sixty rupees a month. Hassan Ali Effendi accepted the offer and moved to Karachi to assume his new responsibilities. Impressed by his performance, Judge Middleton allowed him to practice law before the court without passing any formal degree in law. This was the turning point in Hassan Ali Effendi's life. At that time, there was not a single Muslim advocate apart from him in the entire province; the lawyers tended to be either English or Hindus. Soon he was appointed as the Public Prosecutor, the first non-European in Sindh to be in charge of that post, which he would retain for 14 years. Services Effendi began to take an interest in the welfare of the Muslim population in Sindh, and especially the spread of education in these communities. Much of his drive was influenced by the Indian Muslim educationist Sir Syed Ahmed Khan founder of the Muhammedan Anglo-Oriental College. Wishing to replicate Syed Ahmed Khan's efforts, Effendi even travelled to Aligarh (present-day India) where he sought guidance from him. In 1884, Hassanally Effendi organized ‚ÄòAnjuman-e-Islam‚Äô and was elected its President. He then strove to establish an educational institution for the Muslims of Sindh and it was through his untiring efforts that the present 'Sindh Madressahtul Islam' was founded in 1885 - the first Alma Mater of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah when he joined the Madressah in 1887. Effendi also established the first Muslim Girls' School of Sindh at Marriot Road in Karachi. Hassanally Effendi was the life long President of the Managing Board of the Anjuman-e-Islam and the Sindh Madressah Tul Islam. The credit for education establishment in Sindh goes mainly to Hassanally Effendi. During the war between Turkey and Russia in 1870s he collected substantial funds for Turkish Soldiers. In recognition of these services he received the Turkish title of \\"Bey Majidi\\" and was appointed Counsellor for Turkey in Karachi, an appointment that he held till his demise. He symbolizes a historic connection between the people of Turkey and Pakistan. He also earned the title of Khan Bahadur from British government in 1889 because of his services towards welfare and establishment. He breathed his last, after a full life of service and dedication to Muslims, on August 20, 1895 at Hyderabad and was buried in his own orchard.

Nothing remains today besides the name of the parking garage. Beijnes (1838 - 1963) is a defunct Haarlem manufacturer of carriages, buses, trains, and trams. It was closely associated with the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg- Maatschappij (HIJSM) History Grote Houtstraat 126, the former location of A.J. Beijnes' smithworks J.J. Beijnes the elder opened a horse carriage shop (wagenmaker) behind the St. Bavochurch on the Riviervischmarkt in Haarlem in 1838.\\"Beijnes : een eeuw van arbeid : 1838 - 1 november - 1838\\"; by Henri Asselberghs with color plates by Herman Heijenbroek and drawings by Herman Moerkerk; Impressum Haarlem : Spaarnestad, 1938 The painter and writer Jacobus van Looy described such a horse buggy servicing shop in detail in his autobiographical description of his early apprenticeships to a local typesetter and a local carriage shop owner in \\"Jaap\\", 1923. The increasing amount of ironwork needed for wagons of all types resulted in J.J. Beijnes merging his business with his brother A.J., a local smith, whose workshop was located at Grote Houtstraat 126 across from the Cornelissteeg in Haarlem. =Train= The first train line constructed in the Netherlands was a line following the straight route of the Haarlemmertrekvaart canal, connecting Amsterdam with Haarlem, which opened on 20 September 1839. To service the trains on the rails, the HIJSM had British engineers come over along with the locomotives they built. Beijnes was eager to obtain a contract, and it wasn't until 1855 that the services of the Fabriek van Rijtuigen en Spoorwagens J.J. Beijnes won a commission for four charabancs. They were helped along by the local patrons J. Borski and J. Gerken, who both happened to be in the board of directors of the young HIJSM. After their initial order, the Beijnes company grew so fast, that in 1858 the first stone was laid in the new location at the stationsplein across from the Haarlem railway station. In 1870 King William III added the predicate \\"Royal\\" to the company's name and it became Koninklijke Fabriek van Rijtuigen en Spoorwagens J.J. Beijnes. In 1891, the HSM, aided by the social activist Daniel de Clercq, began the Haarlem society called De Ambachtsschool to unify various city efforts to start a vocational school in Haarlem, in order to satisfy their need for skilled workers in the booming train carriage business.Deugd boven geweld, Een geschiedenis van Haarlem, 1245-1995, edited by Gineke van der Ree-Scholtens, 1995, , p555 In 1896 the \\"twin hall\\" was built to service more train compartments simultaneously, and in 1914 the \\"Staalhal\\" was built on the Verspronckweg. =Electric Train= In 1922 the first experiments were made with electric trains. Beijnes won a commission for a model called the Mat.'24. They were called \\"blokkendozen\\" for their similarity to a child's building blocks and became a success for years. Their speed was 100 kilometers per hour and over 98 of them were built, with the last one going out of service in 1959. After this initial success, Beijnes was again allowed to innovate with the diesel- electric train in 1933, called the DE-3, which could reach a speed of 125 kilometers per hour and was designed for international service. From 1935, 91 of the streamlined models Mat.'35, Mat.'36, Mat.'40, and Mat.'46 were built. In 1939 the Dutch railways celebrated their 100-year anniversary with two postage stamps, one representing the first locomotive (Arend), and the other the Beijnes-built Mat.‚Äô36. =World War II= The company's history during World War II is a tale of ever-increasing economic distress. The war put an end to international travel (aside from what the German occupying forces desired) and the DE line including the new DE 5, which was designed in 1942-1944 together with Werkspoor in Utrecht and Allan in Rotterdam, could not be exploited. Together with other hardships of war, including the hunger winter, the company declined. After the war, the company moved the entire factory in 1950 to Beverwijk, where the company had its own train station for workers. It recovered somewhat from the damages of war and with the introduction of the new model ELD 4 in 1956 (called the \\"hondekop\\" because the nose looked like the head of a dog), the company was able to see some successful years, though the decline had already set in. In 1959 the company was taken over by Verenigde Machine Fabrieken (VMF) and in 1963 the factory closed after the last model DE 140 was delivered.

Sri Lanka's life expectancy and literacy rate are nearly on par with those of developed countries, and even top the rankings for the South Asia region.Human Development Report 2013 While all these indicate that Sri Lanka should be experiencing a high standard of living, until recently it has only ranked in the medium category of the Human Development Index (HDI). This is despite the fact that Sri Lanka has been experiencing moderate growth in its GDP averaging 5.5 per annum between 2006 and 2009.2011 CIA Worldfact Book One of the reasons is due to its relatively low GDP per capital;. The Sri Lankan government has been successful in reducing poverty from 15.2% on 2006 to 8.9% in 2010, urban poverty was reduced from 6.7 to 5.3% while rural poverty was reduced from 15.7 to 9.5%, and the nation has made significant progress towards achieving Millennium Development Goals on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. Population As of 2010, 8.9% of the population lives below the poverty line. This is evidence that while acute poverty is no longer an issue, poverty still remains widespread and continues to be a challenging problem in Sri Lanka. More worryingly however is the fact that 90% of the poor live in rural areas, with over 80% of Sri Lanka's population still living in rural areas. But in 2013 it has showed that the economy is growing more rapidly than any other Asian country. This highlights a link between isolation from social and economic infrastructure, cities and markets, and higher levels of poverty incidence. One explanation could be that it limits these people from earning income through off-farm activities. In addition, with more than 40 per cent of the rural poor people being small farmers, their production systems may be hampered by the usual suspects of fragmented landholdings, poor economies of scale, low investment levels resulting from poor financial services as well as inappropriate or limited technology. According to the Asian Development Bank, the population of Sri Lanka was 19.71 million in 2015. In 2014, 6.7% of the country lived below the national poverty line. During the same year, it was also reported that 50.5% of the population aged 15 years and above were employed.Asian Development Bank. (n.d.). Poverty in Sri Lanka. Retrieved 21 November 2016 from https://www.adb.org/countries/sri-lanka/poverty Development In 2008, it was reported that tens of thousands of men from impoverished villages were joining the Sri Lanka Armed Forces and Sri Lanka Police Service to escape rural poverty, as the wages offered by the security services significantly raise the standard of living for soldiers and their families. In order to reduce rural poverty (and thus poverty as a whole), rural development in terms of infrastructure is important. The need for a better road network and transport system to link up the rural areas as well as better credit facilities to aid in the investments of new technology and farming techniques are just a start in ensuring that the rural poor are not left behind. While it is identified that development in the rural areas is crucial for poverty alleviation, the government cannot possibly channel unlimited funds into development plans without constraints, disregarding potential developments in urban areas, or more importantly, not considering the state of its overall economy. Therefore, the Sri Lankan government faces a dilemma of pursuing growth that is equitable; trying to promote economic growth without leaving the poor in the rural area behind. Apart from government policies, Non- Governmental Organizations (NGOs)help ease the situation too. One of them is Sarvodaya. Sarvodaya is Sri Lanka's largest NGO, which includes many other divisional units dedicated for different development projects. Sarvodaya Economic Empowerment Development Services (SEEDS) began its operation as a separate division in 1986 and now reaches 18 of Sri Lanka's 25 districts. SEEDS is responsible for building the economic capacity of the poorest groups within the communities. Its aim is to stimulate an attitude of entrepreneurship, innovation, thrift and sustainable development in the rural areas. Although SEEDS does not directly deal with the lack of physical infrastructure in rural areas, i.e. development plans in building roads, bridges, etc., it has helped people in rural areas to be financially independent and improved livelihood, which in turn helps reduce rural poverty. It hopes that through their aid, villages can become self govern and capable of serving their community's economics and social needs., SEEDS provides saving and credit services for starting a small enterprise or to improve livelihood as well as non-financial services such as business counselling, training in technical skills and market information. It uses the village banking microfinance model to help the rural communities. Village banking treats the whole community as one unit, and establishes semi-formal or formal institutions through which micro-finance is dispensed. The banks are run by their own people: they choose their members, elect their own officers, establish their own by-laws, distribute loans to individuals, and collect payments and savings. Their loans are backed, not by goods or property, but by moral collateral: the promise that the group stands behind each individual loan. Therefore, this is a means of ensuring that each individual will be disciplined in saving up to repay their own loans. 86% of SEEDS beneficiaries actually had functioning micro enterprises. Statistics have shown that 51% of SEEDS beneficiaries showed increased revenues while 73% of them showed increased profits. There are 1,129,344 members in these village banks, out of which 60% of the members are females. This in itself has empowered women as they are no longer dependent on others for their capital needs. They have more bargaining power within the households and thus need not feel as insecure as before. Secondly, they have a guaranteed and sure access to capital thus removing uncertainty and permitting a confident basis to stay in business and even expand. This is a major empowerment both socially and economically of these women, as this micro-finance model not only raise their level of productivity but also allow women to contribute to family income, leading to an overall reduction in poverty levels in the rural areas. Other than financial services, SEEDS has been able to integrate spiritual revival, social change and economic development. It has helped restore a person's sense of pride and self-esteem, as well as that of the village community. The earlier feeling of humiliation and of powerlessness vanishes with the collective sense that is generated.

The riots started during a chaotic football match, when some fans of the guest team (Arabs) started raising pictures of Saddam Hussein, an action that angered the fans of the host team (the Kurds). Both groups began throwing stones at each other, which soon developed to a political conflict as the Arab group raised pictures of Saddam Hussein while the Kurdish group raised the Flag of Kurdistan. The Ba'ath Party local office was burned down by Kurdish demonstrators, leading to the security forces reacting. The Syrian army responded quickly, deploying troops backed by tanks and helicopters, and launching a crack-down. Events climaxed when Kurds in Qamishli toppled a statue of Hafez al-Assad. At least 30 Kurds were killed as the security services re-took the city. As a result of the crackdown, thousands of Syrian Kurds fled to Iraq. Background Qamishli is the largest town in Al-Hasakah Governorate and is located in northeast Syria. It is regarded as the Kurdish and Assyrian community capital. It is also the center of the Syrian Kurdish struggle,Qantara.de - The Kurds of Syria - An Insecure Stone in the Syrian Mosaic especially in the recent years. The reason why the Kurds were so upset over pictures showing Saddam Hussein was because of Hussein massacres of Kurds. The Kurds also felt opposition from the Syrian government in 1962, forty years before, when the government took census and left out of it many Kurds. This left them and their children without citizenship and the right to obtain government jobs or to have property.(?) This disregarded minority now consists of hundreds of thousands of Kurds, who carry identification cards as \\"foreigner\\". Another move the government made which has fueled tensions was resettling Arabs from other parts of the country into along the border in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. They did this in order to build a buffer between Kurdish areas, which has furthered the hatred between the Kurds and Arabs. After the violence, President Bashar al-Assad visited the region and called for \\"national unity\\". Through this he allegedly hoped to cool tempers and supposedly pardoned 312 Kurds who were accused of participating in the massacre. The United States has for a longer period of time recognized Iraqi Kurdistan diplomatically which has led the Americans to invite the current Kurdish leader of Iraqi Kurdistan, Masoud Barzani, to the White House and a meeting in Baghdad when the American president was in town. The visit from United States Vice President, Joe Biden, to the fourth largest city in Iraq, Erbil, also known as the Iraqi Kurdistan capital, helped strengthen their ally with them. The United States started Operation Comfort and Operation Comfort II in an attempt to defend Kurds fleeing their homes in Northern Iraq as a result of the Iraqi Gulf War. Iraqi Kurdistan and the United States have been allies for a longer period of time dating back to 1919 when the US supposedly successfully pushed for an independent country for the Kurds. Masoud Barzani is the current president of the Iraqi Kurdistan region and leader of the Kurdistan Democratic party. Jalal Talabani is the sixth and current president of Iraq, a leading Kurdish politician. He is the first non- Arab president of Iraq. The protest occurred in 2004 and Jalal Talabani was elected president in 2005. 2004 events On 12 March 2004, a football match in Qamishli between a local Kurdish team and an Arab team from Deir ez-Zor in Syria's southeast sparked violent clashes between fans of the opposing sides which spilled into the streets of the city. The fans of the Arab team reportedly rode about town in a bus, insulting the Iraqi Kurdish leaders Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani and brandishing portraits of deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, whose infamous Al-Anfal Campaign killed an estimated 182,000 Kurdish civilians in Iraq. In response, Kurdish fans supposedly proclaimed \\"We will sacrifice our lives for Bush\\", referring to US President George W. Bush, who invaded Iraq in 2003, deposing Saddam and triggering the Iraq War. Tensions between the groups came to a head, and the Deir ez-Zor Arab fans attacked the Kurdish fans with sticks, stones, and knives. Government security forces brought in to quell the riot fired into the crowd, killing six people, including three children‚Äîall of them were Kurds.Tejel, p. 115 The Ba'ath Party local office was burned down by the demonstrators, leading to the security forces reacting and killing more than 15 of the rioters and wounding more than 100. Officials in Qamishli alleged that some Kurdish parties were collaborating with \\"foreign forces\\" to supposedly annex some villages in the area to northern Iraq.Syria: Address Grievances Underlying Kurdish Unrest, HRW, March 19, 2004. Events climaxed when Kurds in Qamishli toppled a statue of Hafez al-Assad. The Syrian army responded quickly, deploying thousands of troops backed by tanks and helicopters. At least 30 Kurds were killed as the security services re-took the city, over 2,000 were arrested at that time or subsequently. Aftermath =Moqebleh (Moquoble) refugee camp= After the 2004 events in Qamishli, thousands of Kurds fled to the Kurdish Region of Iraq. Local authorities there, the UNHCR and other UN agencies established the Moqebleh camp at a former Army base near Dohuk. Several years later the KRG moved all refugees, who arrived before 2005, to housing in a second camp, known as Qamishli. The camp consists of a modest housing development with dozens of concrete block houses and a mosque. The original camp at the former Army citadel now contains about 300 people. Many of the homes are made of cement blocks, covered with plastic tarpaulins. Latrines and showers are in separate buildings down the street. Authorities provide electricity, water trucks and food rations.Reese Erlich, ‚ÄúSyrian Kurds have long memories,‚Äù Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, Oct. 21, 2011. http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/syria-kurds-moqebleh-refugee-camp-oppose- assad-regime Kurds can leave the camp to work. As supposed refugees they cannot get government jobs, but are able work in the private sector, often as construction workers or drivers. The Kurds seem likely not to return to Syria until political conditions change. =2005 demonstrations= In June 2005, thousands of Kurds demonstrated in Qamishli to protest the assassination of Sheikh Khaznawi, a Kurdish cleric in Syria, resulting in the death of one policeman and injury to four Kurds. In March 2008, according to Human Rights Watch, Syrian security forces opened fire at Kurds who were celebrating the spring festival of Nowruz. The shooting killed three people. =2011 protests in Qamishli= With the eruption of the Syrian Civil War, the city of Qamishli became one of the protest arenas. On 12 March 2011, thousands of Syrian Kurds in Qamishli and al-Hasakah protested on the day of the Kurdish martyr, an annual event since 2004 al-Qamishli protests. =2012 rebellion= In 2012, armed elements among the Kurds launched Syrian Kurdish rebellion in north and north-western Syria, aiming against Syrian government forces. In the second half of 2012, the rebellion also resulted in clashes between Kurdish soldiers and the militants of the Free Syrian Army, both striving towards control of the region.

Plot Doris always wanted to have her own coffee-house. With the help of her sister, Joise, she opened \\"Doris's Cafe\\". After the first day of business, however, there are few customers for the coffee house and the coffee house becomes cluttered with many useless gifts brought by friends and former colleges. Later, when customers start to ask about purchasing some of the items, Joise suggested a bartering system for the store. Business goes up as people linger to decide what to exchange. Later, customers began to share their personal stories with Doris in the coffee house as well. Cast * Gwei Lun-mei as Doris, the owner of the newly opened cafe. * Zaizai Lin as Joise, sister of Doris who works in the cafe. * Chang Han as Chun-Ching, a soap collector who has collected 35 bars of soap. Each bar of soap has a story behind it. * Kousuke Atari as a Japanese Singer Production The film was invested in part by Taipei tourism bureau. Director Hsiao Ya-chuan said that he got inspiration for Doris's character when he visited a coffee shop in Shanghai, where he witnessed a French girl with short hair devoting \\"her full attention to making desserts at the counter\\". Hsiao also said that he wanted to deliver the idea of \\"making exchanges without using money\\" because he felt that \\"if we value an item with only one fixed standard [ie: money], the item will lose its appeal very soon.\\". Doris‚Äô Coffee Shop, the coffee shop featured in the film, was built completely from scratch in an old apartment on Fujin Street in Taipei. It later became a real coffee shop after the shooting of the film. Reception The Taipei Times described the film as a \\"surprisingly sweet, romantic portrait of a Taipei where capitalism is superseded by a barter economy\\". The reviewer praised the art, saying that the \\"fairy-tale feel [of the film] is charmingly enhanced by artist Wu Meng-yun‚Äôs child-like illustrated art, and the \\"warm, comforting [music] score\\". However, it added that towards \\"80%\\" of the film, \\"Hsiao stretches his already thin material a bit too much and loses the momentum he would have needed to make a serious statement.\\" It also criticized the characters of the film, saying that they \\"seem to live exclusively in delightful vignettes that are inspired by the real world but not truly rooted in it.\\". Film Business Asia said that \\"Hsiao's second feature is technically smooth and never boring to watch. But it's as wispy as the froth from a cappuccino machine.\\" and rated the film 5 out of 10. Time Out gave the film a score of 2 out of 5, describing it as \\"A sickly sweet capitalist allegory that severely lacks substance\\". However, it added that the film \\"gets extra marks for the production design and ultra-clean shooting style\\". Taipei Exchanges grossed a total of US$17,773 at the Singaporean box office.

Along with Arthur Griffith and Denis Devereux he founded the Celtic Literary Society, and with Griffith founded the first Cumann na nGaedheal. Life William Rooney was born in Mabbot Street in Dublin, Ireland and educated by the Christian Brothers in Strand Street and North Richmond Street. As a boy he was a member of The Irish Fireside Club, a literary discussion group, where he became acquainted with Arthur Griffith around 1888. They joined the Leinster Debating Society (which became the Leinster Literary Society), where Griffith became president and Griffith secretary. After the Leinster Literary Society was dissolved in the wake of the Parnell controversies Rooney formed the Celtic Literary Society, of which he became president and editor of the society's journal, An Seanachuidhe. Along with Michael Cusack he taught Irish at the society's offices; one of their pupils was George Clancy. His writings and articles appeared in United Ireland, The Shamrock, Weekly Freeman, The Evening Herald, Shan Van Vocht and Northern Patriot in Belfast. He was persuaded by Eoin MacNeill to join the Gaelic League after its founding in 1893. As a member of the Gaelic League, which was mainly concerned with promoting the Irish language and literature, he favoured a more political approach to promoting Irish culture. He regarded Irish independence without the revival of the language and culture as meaningless.William Rooney - Life He was active on the 1798 Rising commemoration committee.William Rooney National Graves Association In 1899 he co-founded with Griffith the United Irishman newspaper and wrote many of its articles. Rooney had encouraged Griffith to return from South Africa and edit the paper. In November 1900 along with Griffith he helped establish Cumann na nGaedheal. This was an umbrella organisation to co-ordinate the activities of a number of nationalist groups, with John O'Leary as president; it was merged in 1907 to form Sinn F√©in. He spent some time travelling the country promoting the Irish language and condemned the Irish Parliamentary Party for its failure to promote the language. He died suddenly of tuberculosis at the age of 27, shortly before he was due to be married, in May 1901. He was described by Griffith as \\"the Thomas Davis of the new movement\\".Page 249, Ireland Since the Famine by F.S.Lyons, Fontana Press (1971). . . and William Rooney spoke in Irish.

A book of his poems was posthumously published in 1902, Poems and Ballads of William Rooney.Poems and Ballads of William Rooney Published by Gill, Dublin 1908. The writer James Joyce gave Rooney's poems an unfavourable review in the Daily Express. Griffith responded by publishing Joyce's review in the United Irishman as an advertisement for Rooney's book of poems. His only emendation was the addition of a single word. Joyce had written that Rooney 'might have written well if he had not suffered from one of those big words which make us so unhappy.'

Ptolemy used the first of these inequalities while constructing his table of chords.  Proof  The proof is a consequence of the more known inequalities 0<sin(alpha)<alpha<tan(alpha) , 0<sin(beta)<sin(alpha)<1 and 1>cos(beta)>cos(alpha)>0. = Proof of the first inequality = Using these inequalities we can first prove that : frac{sin(alpha)}{sin(beta)} < frac{alpha}{beta}. We first note that the inequality is equivalent to frac{sin(alpha)}{alpha} < frac{sin(beta)}{beta} which itself can be rewritten as frac{sin(alpha)-sin(beta)}{alpha-beta} < frac{sin(beta)}{beta}. We now want show that :frac{sin(alpha)-sin(beta)}{alpha-beta}<cos(beta) < frac{sin(beta)}{beta}. The second inequality is simply beta<tanbeta. The first one is true because : frac{sin(alpha)-sin(beta)}{alpha-beta} = frac{2cdotsinleft(frac{alpha-beta}2 right)cosleft(frac{alpha+beta}2right)}{alpha-beta} < frac{2cdot left(frac{alpha-beta}2 right) cdot cos(beta)}{alpha-beta} = cos(beta). = Proof of the second inequality = Now we want to show the second inequality, i.e. that: : frac{alpha}{beta} <frac{tan(alpha)}{tan(beta)}. We first note that due to the initial inequalities we have that: : beta<tan(beta)=frac{sin(beta)}{cos(beta)}<frac{sin(beta)}{cos(alpha)} Consequently, using that 0<alpha-beta<alpha in the previous equation (replacing beta by alpha-beta<alpha ) we obtain: : {alpha-beta}<{frac{sin(alpha-beta)}{cos(alpha)}}=tan(alpha)cos(beta)-sin(beta). We conclude that : frac{alpha}{beta}=frac{alpha-beta}{beta}+1< frac{tan(alpha)cos(beta)-sin(beta)}{sin(beta)}+1 = frac{tan(alpha)}{tan(beta)}.

Background As an up-and-coming artist in Paris during the 1920s, Mir√≥ was influenced heavily by Cubism and Art Nouveau, particularly the works of artists like Picasso. During this time he painted works similar to Bleu I, II and III such as Maternity (1924), Painting (1927), and Catalan Peasant with a Guitar (1924). Many of these works used the same spacious, blue field. Mir√≥ held a special significance with this colour; to him this blue was a symbol of a world of cosmic dreams, an unconscious state where his mind flowed clearly and without any sort of order. This blue was the colour of a surreal, ethereal night, a night that embodied the only place where dreams could exist in their rawest state, untouched and uncensored by conscious, rational thought. Now its stalled in the Musee de Centre Pompidou The painting Mir√≥ completed the Triptych Bleu I, II, III on March 4, 1961, well into his artistic career. By this time he was an established artist with large exhibitions all over the world, and saw this triptych as a summary of his works up to this point. Shifts in style and technique are apparent over the course of his artistic career, ranging from busy landscapes and portraits at the beginning of his career to his famous abstract paintings of nearly empty space and stark, primary colors, the style in which Bleu II was created. Mir√≥‚Äôs abstract paintings conveyed his dreams and subconscious, and he often spoke of painting freely without truly being in control; rather, letting the free-flowing thoughts and shifts of his mind move the brush across the canvas, a technique referred to as ‚Äúpsychic automatism‚Äù. Bleu II exemplifies his distinct style; the artist uses sparse, uniform brushstrokes all across the canvas, giving the enormous expanse of the painting an even more empty feeling, which is emphasized even further by the distinguishable dreamy blue of the background. Bleu II is probably the painting in Mir√≥‚Äôs portfolio that most definitively expresses his obsession with dreamscapes and vacant, infinite space. In 1958, during which he was working on the Bleu I, II, III triptych and similar abstract murals in Paris, he was quoted saying: ‚ÄúThe spectacle of the sky overwhelms me. I‚Äôm overwhelmed when I see, in an immense sky, the crescent of the moon, or the sun. There, in my pictures, tiny forms in huge, empty spaces. Empty spaces, empty horizons, empty plains‚Äîeverything which is bare has always greatly impressed me.‚Äù (Twentieth Century Artists on Art, 1958). Bleu I and Bleu III are nearly identical to Bleu II with exactly the same backgrounds of matching color and simple lines and shapes. To animate the sparseness of Bleu IIs canvas, Mir√≥ includes the dynamic red line on the left side of the painting, conveying a sharp shock in the calm blue surface. He also employs the series of bold, defined black dots radiating out from the red line in a horizontal flow to transmit the motion of the line through the whole expanse of the canvas. With these shapes, Mir√≥ creates an energetic, powerful piece, a bold work brought to life by the precise (but by intention very free) placement of geometric shapes and bright colors, allowing the viewer a glimpse into the unspoiled subconscious of the artist and truly embodying the unique style for which Mir√≥ is well known for today.

The episode centered on the Fringe team's investigation into a series of robberies of the element osmium, which they connect to a scientist (Alan Ruck) who is able to defy the laws of physics. \\"Os\\" was written by Josh Singer and Graham Roland, while Brad Anderson served as director. Along with Ruck, the episode also guest-starred Jorge Garcia in a brief cameo as a security guard. On its first broadcast in the United States on March 11, 2011, an estimated 3.76 million viewers tuned in, giving it a 1.5/5 ratings share for those between the ages 18‚Äì49. Critical reception to the episode was generally positive, as multiple critics noted that Ruck was well-cast as a scientist just trying to help his son. Plot The Fringe team is called to the scene of a robbery of a metal depository; the body of one of the thieves, shot by a security guard, inexplicably floats off the ground, while a second culprit has gotten away. They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of osmium, one of the densest elements, and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief's body is filled with the metal. Tracking a security card on the body, they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit, dead, along with the bodies of several more people, all of them paraplegic. Walter (John Noble) notes that the physical properties of osmium (both gravitational and thermal) have been reversed, and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen, they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium, typically only present in meteorites. Recognizing that the local science museum has a display of meteorites, the Fringe team is able to secure Dr. Crick (Alan Ruck), the man behind the osmium injections, and another paraplegic who has taken Dr. Crick's injections as they attempt to steal the display. With Dr. Crick in custody, Walter learns that the man had worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft. He happened upon the combination of the osmium-lutetium alloy that generated a material lighter than air, and sought to refine a permanent solution to give his own paraplegic son the ability to walk, having promised the same to those that had died from earlier, lethal doses of the alloy. Walter, who has lamented to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) his need to have William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) back to make himself whole, realizes that the only reason the osmium-lutetium alloy became lighter than air was due to his own transgression into the parallel universe that has started to break down the laws of reality. To reverse those effects, Walter intends to use the idea of \\"soul magnets\\", microscopic devices that can be ingested by a person to call forth the soul of another. Walter believes Bell had arranged for someone in the prime universe to be his vessel, and rings the bell that Bell had bequeathed to Nina, believing it to be the instrument that will activate the soul magnets and call forth Bell. Simultaneously, Peter (Joshua Jackson) has decided to open up to Olivia (Anna Torv) and shows her the five data discs from the shapeshifters he killed after the doomsday device weaponized him. As he discusses it with her, Olivia hears the sound of the bell. She turns to face Peter, revealing herself to now be possessed by Bell. Production Jorge Garcia, known for his character Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes in Lost, made a cameo appearance in \\"Os\\". The episode was co-written by co- executive producer Josh Singer and executive story editor Graham Roland, while former Fringe producer Brad Anderson directed it. The return of the William Bell character to the series was inspired by Leonard Nimoy from earlier seasons. In his first appearance on Fringe in the first season finale, \\"There's More Than One of Everything\\", Nimoy requested that a bell be placed on his desk so that his character would be able to ring it as a play on the character's name. When the writers considered how to bring Bell back for the third season, they recalled this mannerism, and wrote it into the larger mythos, being the means by which Bell's mind emerged from Olivia's at the end of this episode. On March 3, Entertainment Weekly reported that actor Jorge Garcia would be making a cameo appearance in an upcoming Fringe episode. Garcia, who previously starred as Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes from J.J. Abrams' Lost, appears as a Massive Dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with Walter at the start of the episode. Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick, the person behind the floating bodies. Ruck was approached by the show's producers having envisioned him for the role. Ruck described the character, \\"He is no dummy... and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it. Ultimately he would like to use it for good, but in so doing he causes a lot of damage. So I guess you can say he's obsessed. And this particular point in time where the episode of Fringe starts, time is fleeting and he's just... under the gun.\\" On his character's possible reappearance, Ruck commented, \\"I think not... Technically yes [he could come back], but probably not.\\" As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in \\"Os\\", with the intention of having \\"students learn about meteorites and ways of finding them.\\" Reception =Ratings= On its first broadcast, \\"Os\\" maintained a 1.5/5 rating share for adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as with several previous episodes, with an estimated 3.76 million viewers. In the 18‚Äì49 demographic, Fringe was the second most watched show in its time slot, after CSI: NY. Time shifted viewing increased the episode's ratings among adults by 53 percent to a 2.3 ratings share. This was the largest increase in time shifting viewing for the week among network shows. =Reviews= Reviews of the episode were generally positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly praised guest actor Alan Ruck's \\"sustained, understated\\" performance, and also called Olivia being revealed as Bell's vessel \\"a clever development,\\" especially praising actress Anna Torv's imitation of Nimoy's voice rather than \\"doing the obvious thing and hav[ing] her lip-synch Nimoy reading the lines.\\" The A.V. Club's Emily VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that unlike Tucker, she thought the idea of \\"soul magnets\\" was \\"just so goofy that it's almost too much for me to handle\\". VanDerWerff also felt there wasn't much of a connection between the episode and the ongoing storyline \\"until the show tries to force one in a way that doesn't feel as elegant as the show usually makes this stuff feel\\". She did however praise Ruck as \\"well-cast,\\" and wrote the episode \\"very nearly managed\\" to parallel Walter's \\"desperate measures to the desperate measures of other men also trying to save themselves or their children through science,\\" which the reviewer considered the strongest asset of the show. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson referred to audiences' Friday night plans away from television when he commented the episode was \\"better than any movie you're going to see in the theater right now\\". Hanson thought the mystery produced \\"surprises around every corner\\". IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.0/10, explaining he enjoyed the \\"classic Fringe\\" opening scene, the \\"decent [acting] job\\" by Ruck, and John Noble's performance; he also thought the script was \\"very clever [as] it reveals surprising story elements with innovative tricks\\". Isler wasn't sure what to make of the Bell-Olivia plot twist however, commenting that \\"this new William Bell thing is either going to end up as the best plot device of the season, or the cheesiest thing in recent sci-fi history\\". Billy Grifter from Den of Geek was slightly disappointed with the \\"mad scientist\\" storyline as he felt it had been done before, but found several redeeming qualities: Alan Ruck's performance and the last five minutes featuring Noble and Blair Brown, and Torv with Joshua Jackson. Grifter thought the Noble-Brown scene was \\"actually very funny,\\" praising the two actors' performances, and added that this humor made the following Torv-Jackson scene's impact \\"even greater\\". Referring to Torv's \\"passable\\" Nimoy impression, Grifter concluded that \\"the strength of Fringe is that it can take a rather light and fluffy premise, like the one in \\"Os\\", and embellish it with wonderful character moments and a genuine surprise or two\\".

His family moved to New York in 1976. He attended Fordham Preparatory School, a Jesuit school. For college he went to the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (1989). He tried out Wall Street but found the work did not suit him. Following that, he attended Harvard for a master's degree in national security (1992), and then Yale for a Ph.D. in diplomatic and military history (1999). He authored a book based on his dissertation. He has also extensively studied philosophy and literature.  Employment  After graduation, he went to work at the Center for Naval Analyses, where he analyzed US operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. After the September 11 attacks, he moved to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where he focused on North Korea. He briefed the Defense Policy Board on his work as well as Henry Kissinger, Stephen Hadley, and Dick Cheney. He also worked at the Office of Net Assessment under the Secretary of Defense, analyzing Chinese nuclear issues. In 2008, he went to work as a contractor at the State Department at the Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance. There, he was Senior Advisor for Intelligence to the Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation. He studied North Korea's nuclear program, especially its claims of dismantling its equipment. He also participated in nuclear war games at the Naval War College. = Incident with Rosen = In June 2009, Kim allegedly had a conversation with Rosen about North Korea planning a nuclear bomb test.  Indictment  In August 2010, Kim was indicted by a grand jury on two charges: *Unauthorized disclosure of national defense information in violation of (the Espionage Act) *Making false statements in violation of The government alleges that Kim's conversation with Rosen contained information related to the \\"national defense\\" (793(d) does not use the word \\"classified\\"). The alleged false statements to the FBI occurred in September 2009, regarding whether or not Kim had any contact with Rosen (whom he allegedly met around March 2009). Kim initially pleaded not guilty. Rosen and Fox were not named in the indictment (which listed them as a \\"reporter\\" and a \\"news organization\\"), but news reports identified the parties. Kim was defended by prominent attorneys Abbe Lowell of Chadbourne & Parke and Paul M. Thompson and James M. Commons of McDermott Will & Emery. One of Lowell's arguments was that Bob Woodward's book Obama's Wars contains far more sensitive information than the information Kim is accused of leaking, which created a double standard in leak prosecution. Lowell also said that the DOJ is \\"stretch[ing] the espionage laws\\" and having a chilling effect on government officials communicating with the press. He also said that Kim would never do anything \\"for which he had any reason to believe would harm [US interests].\\"  Guilty plea  On February 7, 2014, Kim entered a guilty plea to a single felony count of disclosing classified national defense information to an unauthorized person, Rosen. His lawyer, Lowell, admitted that his client \\"made a decision to cross a line\\" and that he \\"should have known better.\\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Harvey added that Kim \\"was motivated not by an altruistic purpose but by his own ego and desire for professional advancement.\\" Before sentencing, US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said Kim \\"did lose his moral compass.\\" Kim was sentenced to a 13-month prison term.

Overlay categories Overlay can be categorised in three main ways: * Existing facilities: the overlay consists of temporary elements being added to an existing space to accommodate the specific needs of an event (e.g. the Excel Centre, or the Archery range at Lord's Cricket Ground) * New facilities: the overlay consists of temporary elements that are integrated with permanent elements in a new facility or venue for an event (e.g. the Olympic Stadium) * Temporary facilities: the overlay creates a completely temporary facility or venue for an event (e.g. the Beach Volleyball court at Horse Guards Parade, or the Equestrian Centre at Greenwich Park) References Architecture ","title":"Overlay architecture"},{"id":"31152908","text":"350pages is a web-based website construction tool which was launched in October 2007.

Life and career She was born in London on 8 October 1899. Her father was Italian-born Carlo Albanesi, a pianist and teacher at Royal Academy of Music, while her mother was Effie Adelaide Rowlands, a writer who published over 100 romance novels. She attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and appeared on the stage in The School for Scandal and A Pair of Spectacles. She appeared in small film roles in The Romance of Old Bill, Darby and Joan and Mr. Wu. She enjoyed a successful theatre career, starring in plays such as Galsworthy's The First and the Last, opposite Owen Nares. She was soon being hailed by critics as one of the brightest prospects in British acting.Chambers p. 15 Death Portrait by Henry B. Goodwin, 1922 After making just six films, Albanesi died at the age of 24 in Broadstairs, Kent, on 9 December 1923, of intestinal obstruction and laparotomy, allegedly as a result of an illegal abortion. Albanesi had a relationship with the theatre and film producer Basil Dean who continued to be obsessed with her after her death.Sweet p. 117 Dean was first attracted to his wife the actress Victoria Hopper because of her physical resemblance to Albanesi and cast her in a number of his productions. His final film as a director 21 Days was based on a play, The First and the Last on which he had worked with Albanesi.Sweet pp. 142‚Äì43.

It comprises an early 17th-century tower house, which was extended and remodelled in the 19th century. The house, excluding the later west wing, is protected as a category A listed building, while the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. History In 1596 the lands of Aberuchill were granted to the Campbell family of Lawers. The earliest part of the tower house is dated 1602. In 1642 Aberuchill was acquired by Sir James Drummond, and was retained by his descendants until 1858. The gothic east wing was added to the tower house by the Drummonds, and the interiors remodelled, in the early 19th century. The house was purchased by Sir David Dundas of Dunira in 1858, who sold it on to English cotton merchant George Dewhurst of Lymm, Cheshire, in 1864. Between 1869 and 1874 the west wing and further additions were made, possibly to the designs of David Bryce. Aberuchill was inherited by William Mostyn-Owen on the death of his father in 1947, and he was living there in \\"23 rooms or so\\" of one wing with his wife, the Italian writer Gaia Servadio, in 1968, but eventually sold it.https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jul/20/william-mostyn-owen- obituary The estate was sold by the Dewhursts in the 1980s, and remains in private ownership.

In the 1980s the tin market collapsed, the currency dived, and inflation soared. Austerity measures restored some confidence, but at the cost of widening inequality. This was exacerbated when, at the behest of the US, coca growing, a prime source of income for the poor, was shut down. There are also tensions over natural gas deposits, perhaps Bolivia's last remaining resource. And while GDP and GNI have both grown significantly since 2000, severe disparities exist both regionally and ethnically. UNICEF reports that women and children are the most vulnerable group. In 2002, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line was 82% in rural areas and 54% in urban areas. The departments with the most poverty are Potosi, Chuquisaca and Pando, while Santa Cruz and Tarija have the least. The World Bank's Gini coefficient indicates that income inequality in Bolivia, estimated on the basis of size-adjusted household data, increased by almost ten percentage points between 1992 (49.1) and 1997 (58.2), where a value of 100 percent corresponds to the maximum income inequality and a value of zero percent to the minimum. An increasingly unequal distribution of income is also recorded for the following years. This growth reaches its climax at the turn of the millennium, when 61.6 percent of total income was distributed unequally across households in Bolivia. However, the year 2000 also marks a remarkable turning point. For the following 18 years, the estimated inequality index shows decline without significant fluctuations and points to an actual income inequality of 42.2 percent in 2018. In summary, income inequality in Bolivia has decreased by 6.9 percent points for the period under consideration (1992-2018). Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Inequality Bolivia is one of the most culturally diverse societies in Latin America, with approximately 35 different ethnic groups. Official figures from the Bolivian Population Census 2001 estimates that approximately 62% of the total population are indigenous in 2001.Bolivian Census 2001, Los pueblos ind√≠genas de Bolivia: diagn√≥stico sociodemogr√°fico a partir del censo del 2001, However, this majority of the population remain highly marginalized in economic terms and continue to live in extreme poverty. In Bolivia, mean income per capita in indigenous households was about 300 Bolivian Bolivianos per month in 2001 compared with 480 Bolivian Bolivianos for non-indigenous households.Bolivian Census 2001, Los pueblos ind√≠genas de Bolivia: diagn√≥stico sociodemogr√°fico a partir del censo del 2001, This gap can partly be explained by the fact that the largest source of income among the non-indigenous is non-agricultural wages, while the most important source of income for indigenous families, is agricultural self- employment which tend to be lower on average. By factoring out the difference in income due to types of employment, indigenous families still receive lower average incomes compared to non-indigenous families even within each category of employment. It should also be noted that the differences in income might also be due to differences in worker characteristics. However, neither labour market experience nor female participation seems to drive the differences in incomes. Education has appeared to have the biggest correlation with the disparity in income. Ethnic Education Gap The main social indicators (such as illiteracy rate, mother and child mortality; primary and secondary enrolment rates) also indicate that indigenous peoples have significantly less access to social services than non-indigenous peoples. While non-indigenous people (age 15 and older) completed on average 9.6 years of education, indigenous peoples only completed 5.9 years.National Household Survey 2008 by Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica (National Statistics Institute) In spite of the significant progress Bolivia has made in enhancing access to education in terms of overall school enrolment rates in the last decade, a high drop-out rate, especially among indigenous children is responsible for a persistent education gap between the indigenous and non-indigenous, with 42.4% of indigenous students dropping out before completing primary school compared to only 17.6% of non-indigenous students.National Household Survey 2008 by Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica (National Statistics Institute) References Bolivian society Income distribution ","title":"Inequality in Bolivia"},{"id":"31153020","text":"Stefano Vagnini (2009) Stefano Vagnini (born 1963) is an Italian musician, composer, poet and Modular Art theorist.

The upper floors house the permanent installation of the entire complement of 503 original and restored prints, the work of 273 photographers, from the exhibition The Family of Man, curated by Edward Steichen for The Museum of Modern Art in 1955 and which toured the world to be seen by 9 million visitors. Luxembourg was where Edward Steichen was born in 1879, in Bivange. The exhibition was first presented in the Castle in 1994 after restoration of the prints. The layout of the inaugural exhibition at MoMA is followed in order to recreate the original viewing experience, though necessarily adapted to the unique space of two floors of the restored Castle. Since further restoration of the photographs and displays in 2003 it now incorporates a library and contextualises The Family of Man with historical material and interpretation.Anke Reitz (2018) 'Re-exhibiting The Family of Man: Luxembourg 2013', in Hurm, Gerd, 1958‚Äì, (editor.); Reitz, Anke, (editor.); Zamir, Shamoon, (editor.)

History =The Military Garrison in Bermuda= From 1895 to 1931, the only Bermudian units within the garrison were part-time infantry and artillery soldiers, the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps and the Bermuda Militia Artillery, respectively. Each unit had been created under a separate Act of the colonial parliament, at the prompting of the Secretary of State for War, in London. A third act had also been passed authorising the creation of a militia engineering unit of sappers and miners. This would have followed in the pattern of The Submarine Mining Militia formed in Britain in 1878 and tasked with defending major ports. They received a minimum of fifty-five days training per year, and were recruited from experienced boatmen. In Bermuda, the unit was intended to operate boat from the Royal Army Service Corps docks in Hamilton and St. George's, tending to the underwater mine defences, but the unit was never raised. Instead, the Royal Engineers 27th Company (Submarine Mining) which had been permanently reassigned from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Bermuda in 1888 (part of the company had been split off to create the new 40th Company, which remained in Halifax), continued to maintain the mine defences unaided.27557 Sapper ARCHIBALD LINDSAY, Royal Engineers: 5.

A. for the Bermuda Militia Artillery; V./BER. for the Bermuda Volunteers Rifle Corps; M./BER. S.M. for the Bermuda Submarine Miners. Submarine mine defence was only one of many activities the Royal Engineers were involved in within Bermuda, which particularly included building forts and infrastructure. In 1900 the Royal Engineers Submarine Mining Companies also assumed responsibility for operating electric searchlights defending harbours. During the First World War, in addition to fulfilling their roles as guardians of Bermuda and its important Imperial defence assets (such as the Royal Naval Dockyard), each of these units sent two contingents to the Western Front. Numerous other Bermudians served in other regiments and corps of the British Army, as well as in the Royal Navy and the new Royal Air Force. Large numbers of regular infantry and artillery soldiers, plus various supporting units, had been stationed in Bermuda since the early 19th Century, but the UK Government had been trying to reduce the expense of maintaining garrisons around the world, following the Crimean War, by encouraging the raising of volunteer units in the various colonies and protectorates. This had led to the creation of the two Bermudian units, and the size of the regular forces in Bermuda was steadily reduced from about 1870 onward. From 1919 the regular infantry battalion on garrison was reduced to a wing. Excepting the years 1925 to 1929, when a full battalion was present, this remained the case 'til 1940. In May, 1928, the Royal Artillery companiess and Royal Engineers Fortress Company were withdrawn entirely.Army Notes.

Its original strength was one captain, one subaltern, three sergeants, four corporals, and twenty-four sappers. An adjutant, a sergeant-major, and two sergeants were attached from the regular Royal Engineers. Its original role was to operate the search lights at coastal artillery batteries. The only battery left in active use by that time was the Examination Battery at St. David's Head, the guns of which were manned by the BMA.The Bermuda Volunteer Engineers, by Jennifer M. Hind (formerly Jennifer M. Ingham) of The Royal Gazette. Transcript of typescript document held at the Bermuda Maritime Museum. The first commanding officer of the BVE was Captain H.D. (later Sir Harry) Butterfield, and the second-in-command was Lieutenant Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC. Both were veterans of the First World War (Montgomery-Moore had served in the BVRC before taking a commission as a fighter pilot in the Royal Flying Corps). In 1932, Butterfield retired, and Montgomery-Moore succeeded him. The new 2-i-c was Lieutenant Nicholas Bayard Dill (later Sir Bayard), a son of Colonel Thomas Melville Dill (a former commander of the BMA). In 1937, the BVE subsequently also took on responsibility for providing signals crew and equipment to all elements of the garrison. =Second World War= The BVE, and the other part-time units, were mobilised at the start of the Second World War, fulfilling its role to the Garrison throughout the war. Some members also were detached for service overseas with other units, including the Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force. These included four Sappers who were attached to a larger BVRC contingent despatched to the Lincolnshire Regiment in June, 1940. Another was Captain Richard Gorham, DFC. Commissioned from the ranks, he was detached from the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers to travel to England to train as an Air Observation Post pilot-an aerial artillery spotter. He had been involved in directing artillery fire as part of his role in the BVE, but had to transfer into the Royal Artillery for this new role. Serving in Italy, he played the decisive role in the Battle of Monte Cassino when he spotted a German division moving in half-tracked German Armoured Personnel Carriers to counter attack against the British and Polish army units which were attacking the German-occupied monastery. Gorham controlled the fire of two-thousand field guns, which fired for hours, destroying the German division. Gorham received the Distinguished Flying Cross for this action.Colonel Sir Richard M. Gorham, DFC. Article by Peter Bonete, published in the Mid-Ocean News, 11 March 1972. In Bermuda, Montgomery-Moore was promoted to Major in 1940, and Bayard Dill to Captain. In addition to his role with the BVE, Montgomery-Moore also headed the Bermuda Flying School, which trained 80 local volunteers as pilots for the RAF and the Fleet Air Arm. Volunteers were only accepted from those already serving in the local forces, some of whom came from the BVE.That's My Bloody Plane, by Major Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC, and Peter Kilduff. 1975. The Pequot Press, Chester, Connecticut. . =Disbandment= The BVE, as with all of the local volunteer units, was demobilised in 1946 following the end of the war. Whereas the BVRC and the BMA maintained skeleton command structures until they began recruiting again in 1951, the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers was officially disbanded.

Life Gordon was born 24 April 1762 at Ardersier, Inverness-shire, where his father, the Rev. Harry Gordon, was minister of the parish. After his father's death (15 March 1764) his mother went to live with her father, the Revd Walter Morrison, in Banffshire. Young Gordon was educated at the parish school of Banff, and subsequently at the University of Aberdeen, where he did not remain long, obtaining a commission in the marines at the age of fifteen. He was principally employed in recruiting, and seems to have seen no active service except a few cruises, which yielded him, he says, ¬£17 in prize-money. In 1792 he obtained a commission in a regiment raised by the Duke of Gordon, and after five years' service in Scotland was allowed to accompany his friend Lord Montgomery, an invalid, to Italy, where he remained until 1801, returning to find his regiment disbanded. He obtained employment at Menorca; but as he was on the point of embarking, 'my good fortune threw in my way an amiable young widow', whom he married in autumn 1801. This rendered him independent of military service. After living at Banff Castle and in Sloane Street, London, he went to Sicily with Lord Montgomery in 1811, and remained there until 1813, when he was prostrated by a sunstroke. The following year, after the peace, he took up his residence at Brussels, where he remained until his death. He died in Cheltenham on 2 September 1845. His only son, George Huntly Gordon, died on 27 December 1868 at the age of 72. Writings In 1823 Gordon wrote a guide for travellers, entitled A Companion to Italy, the success of which led to the appearance of his Personal Memoirs in 1830. This contained reminiscences of notable persons known to the author, including Lady Hamilton, George Brydges Rodney, Richard Porson, Charles Burney, and James Perry of the Morning Chronicle. It sketches picture and antiquity hunting, at a time when bargains were to be had, and connoisseurs were liable to be imposed upon. Gordon himself obtained for Burney the copy of Constantine Lascaris's Grammar, the first Greek book printed, which went to the British Museum. There is a description of the English at Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo.

Endgame was started by executives from ISS (Internet Security Systems). History Endgame was started in 2008 by Chris Rouland and other executives who previously worked with the CIA and ISS. In October 2010 it saw an investment of 29 million USD, raised from Bessemer Ventures, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers (KPCB), and TechOperators. The company offers commercial web-based malware detection services, defensive digital security intelligence and big data analysis software. In February 2011, the company announced partnerships with Hewlett-Packard and IBM to use Endgame's IP Reputation Intelligence service within HP's TippingPoint Digital Vaccine service and IBM's managed services offerings. That same month emails sent to HB Gary from Endgame were leaked which revealed that the company sold zero-day vulnerabilities. As of 2014 Endgame has moved away from zero-day exploitations to identifying and protecting consumers from potential cyber threats. Endgame now offers its services to companies within the financial services industry and consumer technology companies. Through its software the company collects information from data sources accessed by consumers, identifying potential security threats. In December 2012, Endgame announced the appointment of Nathaniel Fick as Chief Executive Officer, replacing Chris Rouland. A former Marine and author of bestseller One Bullet Away, Fick was previously CEO of the Center for a New American Security, an independent and nonpartisan national security and defense policy research institution, and remains an operating partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. In March 2013, Endgame closed a $23 million Series B equity financing with the stated purpose to fund growth in its existing federal customer base as well as expand into the commercial market. The round was led by new investor Paladin Capital Group, a multi-stage private equity firm, and included participation from existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners, Columbia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and TechOperators. Endgame initially became known for providing cyber intelligence to US agencies such as the National Security Agency but as of 2013 expanded to financial and commercial clients within the private sector, raising an additional $30 million in funding with investment from Edgemore Capital, Top Tier Capital Partners and Savano Capital Partners. Endgame offers defensive analytics of a company's network and servers for data exploits. Endgame acquired Onyxware in 2014, a Florida-based mobile security technology company which provides applications for detecting third-party network threats. As of November 2014 Endgame boasts approximately 100 employees. On October 8th, 2019, Elastic N.V.

It revolves around Annakili, who falls in love with teacher Thyagarajan. Due to circumstances, Thyagarajan marries another girl. Azhagappan, a womaniser creates a misunderstanding about Annakili among the villagers; the rest of the film shows how Annakili proves her innocence Annakili was produced by S. P. Thamizharasi under the production banner \\"SPT Films\\". The film's story was written by R. Selvaraj and the screenplay and lyrics were written by Panchu Arunachalam. A.

Annakili was released on 14 May 1976 with a reel length of and became a commercial success at box office.

An impressed Panchu Arunachalam decided to write a film story to accommodate these songs; the film would be titled Annakili. The climax, featuring a theatre being set on fire, was inspired by the film Kannagi.  Soundtrack  The film's soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, who made his debut as composer with this film, and the lyrics were written by Arunachalam. Selvaraj insisted to have Pavalar Brothers compose the music, but Arunachalam selected Rasaiyya to compose as he felt it was not appropriate to have three brothers to compose music. Arunachalam added \\"Ilaiya\\" (Ilaiya means younger in Tamil language) as prefix in his name Raaja and he named as \\"Ilaiyaraaja\\" because in the 1970s there was one more music director A. M. Rajah who was a popular one. For the soundtrack, Ilaiyaraaja applied the techniques of modern popular film music orchestration to Tamil folk poetry and folk song melodies, which created a fusion of Western and Tamil idioms. The song \\"Machanai Paartheengala\\" was originally composed and sung at a marriage by Ilaiyaraaja and his orchestra even before the film's release. The violin portions of the song were used by music director K for the \\"Bar Anthem\\" in Mugamoodi (2012).

In addition, according to the United Nations Development Programme, only 35% of Sierra Leone‚Äôs population above 15 years of age is educated and the statistic is even lower for citizens with disabilities.

It is a 501(c)(3) non- profit organization based out of New York, New York that raises funds for microfinance institutions (MFIs) to enable women to spearhead their own businesses and rise out of poverty.  Model  The Seven Bar Foundation is a social enterprise, a non-profit that uses business models for social impact. The Foundation relies on commercial markets to fuel a consistent revenue stream instead of relying on unpredictable and limited donor funding. Seven Bar aligns cause with product, utilizing the European lingerie industry as a marketing platform to reach a critical mass of consciousness, empowering women by providing funding to start their own businesses.  History  Seven Bar is a third-generation family involved in general aviation, real estate development and investments established in New Mexico beginning in the 1950s. Seven Bar and the Black family established the Seven Bar Foundation in 2001 with activities in eight states, contributing to community development projects in each. = Logo = Seven Bar Foundation is a business model for social impact. It is the brand for microfinance with its pink bars in the logo representing a \\"ladder\\" ‚Äì an exit strategy out of poverty for women. The ladder is to microfinance very much like what the pink ribbon is to breast cancer. The concept is based on the eighth step of Maimonides' Golden Ladder, \\"To prevent poverty by teaching a trade, setting up a person in business, or in some other way preventing the need of charity.\\" = Renata M. Black = Renata Mutis Black has established herself as a philanthropist and humanitarian through her commitment to eliminating poverty. She has fought poverty in twelve different countries, working with terminally disabled children in Hong Kong, mentally disabled elders in New Zealand, and victims of the 2004 tsunami in India. The events of the 2004 tsunami centralized her vision towards microfinance. Black and her husband narrowly evaded the destruction of the tsunami when their flight to Thailand was cancelled due to a mechanical failure. After the disaster, Black immediately went to help rebuild the villages shattered by the catastrophic flooding. During this project, a woman from the region approached her and said, \\"I know you have money and I don't want it, but why don't you teach me how to make it myself?\\" This encounter sparked a new course for Black, who immersed herself in study on microloans and its impact on impoverished communities with 2006 Nobel Prize winner, Muhammad Yunus. Black then applied her training by establishing a grassroots microfinance endeavor in India that exists to this day. Having witnessed first-hand the transformative force of microfinance through her program in India, Black redirected the mission of the Seven Bar Foundation to fund these institutions on a consistent and global basis. She found that microfinance presents these women with the tools to create an exit strategy out of poverty and allows them to become self-sufficient down the road.

A remake of the 1978 Kannada film Parasangada Gendethimma, itself adapted from Srikrishna Alanahalli's novella of the same name, the film stars Sivakumar, Deepa and Sivachandran. Set in British-ruled India, it revolves around a modern woman who cannot tolerate her rustic husband and her mother-in-law, and engages in an extramarital affair. Rosappu Ravikkaikari is Sivakumar's 100th film as an actor. The film was the debut of screenwriter Vijay Krishnaraj, and Vinu Chakravarthy as an actor in Tamil cinema. It was released on 18 May 1979 and became a critical and commercial success. For his performance, Sivakumar won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Tamil.  Plot  In British-ruled India, Sembattayan, a naive and illiterate villager, is the sole breadwinner of his family in Vandicholai. He makes a living by selling betel leaves, covering fast distances by foot. His mother gets him married to Nandhini, an educated and modern woman from a neighbouring village. The villagers are surprised that Sembattayan has such a wife and start suspecting her character for stooping down to the level of marrying Sembattayan, who is a complete mismatch for her. Nandhini finds it difficult to live in their home which lacks all the facilities she is accustomed to. Sembattayan's mother harasses Nandhini and abuses her for her lifestyle and neglecting domestic duties. Unable to tolerate it, Sembattayan establishes a separate home with Nandhini and she is pleased. She concentrates more on grooming herself and her demands keep rising. Sembattayan futilely tries to make her realise that inner beauty is more important than outer beauty which is just skin deep. Manickam, an agent of the British, comes to Vandicholai for recruiting workers and seeks Sembattayan's help for the same. Sembattayan obliges him, Manickam keeps visiting the village on this work and also learns about Nandhini's longings. When Nandhini's father invites Sembattayan and Nandhini for a village festival, Sembattayan innocently sends Nandhini on Manickam's motorcycle. Nandhini and Manickam, smitten by each other, get into a physical relationship on the way. Manickam keeps visiting Nandhini regularly without Sembattayan's knowledge. When villagers start to gossip about this extramarital affair, Sembattayan is saddened, but he still trusts Nandhini. He soon learns about Nandhini's pregnancy and is overjoyed, unaware that he is not the father of her child. The villagers accuse Sembattayan of spoiling the women of Vandicholai by selling fancy items to please his wife and thus imposing city culture on them. One day, he reaches his home before his usual time and hears a man's voice. Through the window, he sees Nandhini and Manickam in a compromising position. Devastated, he remembers his mother's warning that if Nandhini is not controlled, she would be responsible for his destruction, and leaves to drown himself in a pond, while Nandhini contemplates suicide out of guilt. When Sembattayan's corpse is retrieved from the pond, the villagers speculate about the reason for his death differently.  Cast  *Sivakumar as Sembattayan *Deepa as Nandhini *Sivachandran as Manickam *Vinu Chakravarthy as a villager *Loose Mohan *Karuppu Subbiah  Production  Vandichakkaram, written by Vinu Chakravarthy, was originally intended to be the 100th film for Sivakumar as an actor; however, after Chakravarthy, director K. Vijayan and producer Thirupur Mani saw the 1978 Kannada film Parasangada Gendethimma, an adaptation of the novella of the same name by Srikrishna Alanahalli, they told Sivakumar that a remake of this film would be a better fit as his 100th film. The remake, titled Rosappu Ravikkaikari, was directed by the duo Devaraj‚ÄìMohan and produced by Mani under Vivekananda Pictures. Chakravarthy made his debut as an actor in Tamil with this film. He worked on the Kannada original and it was Alanahalli who recommended him for the remake. The screenplay was written by Vijay Krishnaraj (credited simply as Krishna), making his cinematic debut. T. P. Sekar and R. N. K. Prasad worked as editor and cinematographer respectively. Filming was completed in 45 working days. The last song to be filmed was \\"Uchi Vaguntheduthu\\".  Themes  In his book Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry, Selvaraj Velayutham writes that films portraying adulterous heroines basically attempt to explore the complexities of womanhood and sexuality, citing Rosappu Ravikkaikari as an example.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, while the lyrics were written by Pulamaipithan and Gangai Amaran. The song \\"Maaman Oru Naal\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Harikambhoji (also known as Hari Kambhodhi), while \\"Yennullil Yengo\\" is set in the Madhuvanti raga.  Release and reception  Rosappu Ravikkaikari was released on 18 May 1979. The film received an \\"A\\" (adults only) certificate after three cuts. It received critical acclaim, and became a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. The Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, in a review dated 27 May 1979, rated the film 50 out of 100, praising Sivakumar's performance and the background score by Ilaiyaraaja. Sivakumar won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Tamil.  Legacy  According to film historian G. Dhananjayan, Rosappu Ravikkaikari became a milestone for \\"daringly show[ing] infidelity and its consequences on screen for the first time\\" in Tamil cinema.

Merrie Melodies cartoon short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on December 17, 1955, and stars Sylvester the Cat. Mel Blanc provides the vocals; however, aside from whistling, Sylvester doesn't speak in this short. Plot summary At a hospital, Butch the bulldog paces nervously, waiting for his baby to be born. He does, and Butch faints. Back at home, Butch teaches his new son how to walk, act tough, and bite cats (by practicing on a dummy). One day, the young bulldog is playing with a ball when he wanders upon Sylvester. His training kicks in and he attacks Sylvester, who proceeds to place the small bulldog under a tin can. However, Butch catches Sylvester doing this and exacts revenge by taking Sylvester to a shed and hammering the tin can on his head. Later, Sylvester is walking along while the baby bulldog is biting at his tail. He slaps the bulldog off camera, only for Butch to catch up to him and wallop Sylvester in retaliation. After that, Sylvester reluctantly plays fetch with the baby bulldog and decides to throw the stick into a busy street, hoping the bulldog will be flattened. However, the young bulldog retrieves it successfully. Annoyed, Sylvester prepares to throw it again but Butch sees this and throws the stick into traffic himself, pointing for Sylvester to fetch the stick this time. Sylvester successfully retrieves it amidst heavy traffic, but is run over by a man on a scooter on the sidewalk anyway. Once again, Sylvester plays fetch with the young bulldog again and throws a ball into a doghouse, which Sylvester boards up when the bulldog chases the ball into it. Sylvester plans to drop a lit stick of dynamite into the open hole on the top. However, Butch once again catches Sylvester and places the doghouse over Sylvester instead and nailing the hole shut with a board; Sylvester does not hammer out the nails in the board in time as the dynamite explodes. In the final set piece of the cartoon, Sylvester sets up a booby trap of a dog bone hooked up to a shotgun. When Butch's son begins tugging on the bone, Butch gives Sylvester a stern look, prompting Sylvester to run over and plug the shotgun hole with his finger so the young bulldog is unharmed, getting his finger shot over and over (including once in the face) as Butch's son tugs. The stork arrives and announces Butch has even more puppies to add to his family. The cartoon ends as Sylvester chases the stork, shooting at him.

Rayner (15 April 1806 - 1879) was an English landscape artist, known for his paintings of buildings and their interiors, including abbeys, churches and old mansions. He achieved the distinction of having a work accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy at the age of 15. His wife, Ann Rayner, was an engraver on Ashford Black Marble and six of their children went on to be professional artists.  Biography  Samuel Rayner was born in 1806, at Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire (now in Berkshire); afterwards the family moved to Marylebone in London where he was possibly trained by his grandfather. By the age of fifteen, Rayner was training as a draughtsman with the antiquary John Britton when Rayner had a picture of Malmesbury Abbey accepted by the Royal Academy. A fellow student and artistic influence was George Cattermole.Simon Fenwick, ‚ÄòRayner, Samuel (1806‚Äì1879)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 15 March 2011 thumb Samuel Rayner and his wife, Anne Manser Rayner, founded a \\"painting family\\". In 1823, he eloped with Anne Manser, who was four years older than him and was already known as an artist. They married in 1824. Their first child was born in London but he soon died. Six of their children became painters in turn. Rayner's house was a museum in Matlock Bath in the 1830s where Louise, William Henry and Rhoda (Rose) were born. The engraving by Arthur Jewitt illustrated shows Rayner's house in Matlock Back in 1832. There are two extended entrance ways to museums in the picture.

She inspired Marcel Proust as a model for the Duchesse de Guermantes and Odette de Cr√©cy in √Ä la recherche du temps perdu. Life Genevi√®ve Hal√©vy was the daughter of the composer Jacques-Fromental Hal√©vy and his wife L√©onie (n√©e Rodrigues- Henriques), both Jewish. Genevi√®ve Hal√©vy's youth was sad: She lost her father when she was 13 years old, her elder sister when she was 15 years old, and her mother suffered from periods of mental instability. In 1869, she married Georges Bizet, pupil of her father, and gave birth in 1871 to their son Jacques, who became a school friend of Marcel Proust. Bizet died suddenly of a heart attack in 1875. Genevi√®ve moved to live with her uncle, L√©on Hal√©vy, and opened a salon for her cousin Ludovic Hal√©vy, where she helped him in receiving the artistic society of the time. This was known as Ludovic's Thursdays (Les jeudis de Ludovic). After a few years, she opened her own salon where distinguished society, such as Baron and Baronness Alphonse de Rothschild, Comtesse Potocka, Duchesse de Richelieu, and Comtesse de Chevign√© (n√©e de Sade, another model for the Duchesse de Guermantes) could meet with writers and intellectuals such as Guy de Maupassant, Henri Meilhac, Georges de Porto-Riche, Paul Bourget, Paul Hervieu, Joseph Reinach, and her cousin Ludovic. In 1886, she married the lawyer √âmile Straus, an acquaintance of the Rothschild family, and her salon became increasingly fashionable: She received Robert de Montesquiou and his cousin Comtesse Greffulhe, painters and journalists. Many supporters of Dreyfus socialized at Mme Straus's salon, including Marcel Proust, who was one of the first intellectuals to sign a petition in L'Aurore at the time of the Dreyfus Affair. After the Affair, the salon became less prominent. After 1910, Mme. Straus became increasingly depressed, and removed herself from society. Her son committed suicide in 1922, a few weeks before Proust's own death, and she died in 1926.  Sources  *Andr√©e Jacob, Il y a un si√®cle, quand les dames tenaient salon, Paris, Ed.

They may be employed in product evaluation and testing, using measuring and diagnostic devices to adjust, test, and repair equipment. Electronics technicians may also work as sales workers or field representatives for manufacturers, wholesalers, or retailers giving advice on the installation, operation, and maintenance of complex equipment and may write specifications and technical manuals. Electronics technicians represent over 33% of all engineering technicians in the U.S. In 2009, there were over 160,000 electronics technicians employed in the U.S. Electronics technicians are accredited by organizations such as the Electronics Technicians Association (ETA), or International Society of Certified Electronics Technicians (ISCET). Education and training Most employers prefer to hire electronics technicians with an associate degree or other post-secondary training in engineering technology. Training is available at technical institutes, at community colleges, at extension divisions of colleges and universities, at public and private vocational-technical schools, and in the Armed Forces. Naval electronics technicians are the largest group of engineering technicians in the military (see Electronics Technician (US Navy)). Many 2-year associate degree programs accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) include at least college algebra and trigonometry and one or two basic science courses. Depending on the specialty, more math or science may be required. About 200 ABET-accredited programs are offered in engineering technology specialities. ABET-accredited electronics technician programs usually require at least two mathematics courses and two physics courses in addition to the core competencies. Electronics technician curriculum generally consists of courses in basic electricity and electronics, including Ohm's Law, Parallel and Series Circuits, Magnetism, AC/DC Circuits, Capacitance, Inductance, Transformers, Resonance, Filters, Semiconductors, Transistors, Amplifiers, Integrated Circuits and Digital electronics. In addition to vocational learning outcomes associated with the study of electronics and control systems, graduates of electronics technician programs are also expected to have essential employability skills and meet certain general education learning outcomes. Individual schools largely determine the specific program structure, delivery methods, and other curriculum components to be used to assist students in achieving the required program outcomes. A significant component of course material includes laboratory experimentation. These lab courses and projects often represent up to 50% of the course material and are used to reinforce theoretical concepts associated with the study of electronics. Schools offering electronics technician programs will have electronics laboratories to support the delivery of course curriculum. Historically, these laboratories have been traditional \\"hands on\\" learning environments, although in recent years the trend is moving towards electronics simulation software such as Multisim and CircuitLogix. Electronics software simulation is also used in conjunction with traditional labs to provide greater opportunities for students to complete laboratory projects as part of their studies. Career prospects The demand for jobs in the electronics engineering and service fields is the result of a recent proliferation of both consumer and industrial electronics products. The design, installation, servicing and maintenance of this equipment has created significant employment opportunities in the electronics industry. Typical job-related activities may involve: * design * assembly * installation * maintenance * testing * troubleshooting * repair * upgrading of associated electronic equipment and systems. Job opportunities for electrical and electronics technologists and technicians are increasing because many industries use electronic products and systems. Key sectors are telecommunications, audio/video, computers, robotics, energy conversion and efficiency, power generation, transmission and distribution, and electrical equipment manufacturing. Employment opportunities for electronics technicians vary and are largely based on their areas of expertise. For example, employment growth for Electronics technicians in areas such as robotics, energy conversion, and power generation is expected to grow by 5%/yr from 2010 through 2020.

Ferguson was the third son of William Ferguson, laird of Badifurrow, who represented Inverurie in the first Scottish parliament after the Restoration, remembered for its demonstrative loyalty as the ‚Äòdrunken parliament.‚Äô James was a younger brother of Robert Ferguson 'the Plotter'. Military career Ferguson appears to have entered the Scots brigade in the pay of Holland, probably as a gentleman volunteer, some time during the reign of Charles II. His first commission, that of quartermaster in Colonel Macdonald's battalion of the brigade, was dated 12 June 1677. He became ensign in the battalion in September 1678, and lieutenant in February 1682. His battalion was one of those brought over to England in 1685 at the time of Monmouth's rebellion. He became captain in 1687, and in 1688 landed with William of Orange at Torbay. His regiment, then known as Balfour's, afterwards as Lauder's, was one of those first landed, and soon after despatched from London to Leith under Mackay. The fight at Killiecrankie, where he is said to have been taken prisoner, left him a regimental major; and in March 1690 he was despatched by General Mackay, who described him as 'a resolute, well- affected officer,‚Äô in whose discretion and diligence he had full reliance, at the head of six hundred men, to reduce the western isles, a service he accomplished satisfactorily with the aid of the Glasgow authorities and the co-operation of Captain Pottinger of the Dartmouth frigate (Ferguson, pp. 15‚Äì16). In 1692 he was back in the Low Countries, and was present with his regiment (Lauder's) at the battle of Steenkirk. A few days after, on 1 August 1692, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Monro's (late Angus's, now the 1st Cameronians, Scottish rifles), which at the time was in Dutch pay. Ferguson led the regiment at the battle of Landen and at the siege of Namur. On 25 August 1693 he had been appointed to the colonelcy, which he held up to his death. Owing to the reductions after the peace of Ryswick the regiment was retained in the Netherlands,Historically, the Netherlands were inaccurately described as 'Holland' and Holland is used in many older references. but in December 1700 it was finally transferred to the British service, and was brought to Scotland. Ferguson had meanwhile married and been left a widower, and had acquired the estates of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill, on the Kincardineshire bank of the North Esk. Ferguson went with his regiment to the Netherlands under Marlborough in 1702. In 1703 he was in command at 's-Hertogenbosch,Bois-le-Duc is the French translation for 's-Hertogenbosch and was frequently the term used in older British writing. with the rank of brigadier-general. In the campaign of 1704 he commanded a brigade which led the attack on the heights of Schellenberg, and at Blenheim shared with Row's brigade the protracted fighting round the strongest part of the enemy's position. About Christmas the same year Ferguson married his second wife. In the campaign of the year following he had a brigade at the forcing of the enemy's lines in Brabant, and afterwards commanded, with the rank of major- general, at 's-Hertogenbosch, where he died very suddenly‚Äîthe family tradition says by poison‚Äîon 22 Oct. 1705. An old manuscript states that 'he served in four reigns, still maintaining the character of a brave, valiant, and prudent officer, until, his fame raising envy in the breast of the then commanding officer, he was cut off by very sinister means' (ib. p. 46). Contemporary writers are discreetly silent on this ugly story, but all agree in regretting his loss as a brave and experienced officer. He was buried in St. Jan's Kerk,Also known as St John's Cathedral or Sint-Janskathedraal. The history of the Cathedral can be accessed in this book (in Dutch). 's-Hertogenbosch, where there is a small tablet to his memory. There is also a memorial in Old Deer Churchyard. Personal life Kinmundy House, Aberdeenshire Ferguson's first wife was Helen, daughter of James Drummond of Cultmalindie, Perthshire, by whom he had a son and daughter; his second, Hester Elizabeth, daughter of Abraham Hibelet, pastor of the Walloon Church, survived him and remarried Captain Hendrik Chombach. By her Ferguson had a daughter, who in 1730 married M. Gerard Vink, advocate, 's-Hertogenbosch. Ferguson's son James succeeded him, and died in 1777. He was only ten years old when his father died. The General's will had been drawn up by his nephew James Ferguson and as executor he sold the estates of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill and bought those of Kinmundy and Coynach, (now part of the settlement of Clola), Aberdeenshire (Burke, Landed Gentry, 1886, vol. i.), now held by his descendants.

It served the villages of Wolf's Castle and Ford between 1913 and 1964. History The Clarbeston Road and Letterston Railway, s subsidiary of the Great Western Railway (GWR), was opened on 30 August 1906, but at first there were no intermediate stations. However, there was a signal box at Wolf's Castle, because although most of the route was built as double track, a portion near the middle, which included Spittal Tunnel and the cutting through Treffgarne Gorge, was single-track, and it was necessary to have signal boxes at each end of the single-track section. The single-track section was later doubled, but although the temporary signal boxes at Spittal and Treffgarne closed with the introduction of full double- track working on 17 December 1906, Wolf's Castle signal box was retained to break the section, allowing two trains to proceed in the same direction between Clarbeston Road and Letterston simultaneously; there was also a crossover. The first of three intermediate stations to open on the line was Wolf's Castle Halt on 1 October 1913. It was situated from Paddington (via the Severn Tunnel), and was on a level stretch of line to the east of the signal box. The stations to either side in 1923 were and . Unusually for a GWR halt, the two platforms were built of brick rather than wood, as were the shelters. The up platform was long, and the down platform was long. The station nameboards stated \\"Wolf's Castle Halt for Treffgarne Rocks\\". The service was operated using GWR steam rail motors running between and ; there were three trains a day in each direction. The crossover was removed in 1924, and the signal box was taken out of use on 17 February 1925; it was transferred to . The station closed on 6 April 1964, as did all the other stations between Clarbeston Road and Fishguard Harbour. In 2011, the waiting shelters on the platforms no longer exist and the line has been reduced to a single track positioned about halfway between the platforms, which would prevent any future use. The track is also raised on an embankment of ballast, so even if it was still alongside the platform the train doors would be some distance above the platform height.

Life Ferguson was born at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1807. He was of French descent, son of Jacques Fr√©d√©ric Jaquemain, a native of Cambrai. During the time of the French Revolution Jaquemain left France and settled in London, assuming the name of Ferguson in 1793. Six years later he went to America, and in 1800 became deputy-postmaster of Beaufort, South Carolina, where he resided till 1812. After the death of his wife, an English lady, Jaquemain went to London, where he became a teacher of languages. Subsequently, he established a school in St Stephen's Green, Dublin. In 1823 he published a volume of Italian translations from the classic poets. James Frederic Ferguson the younger accompanied his father to Dublin in 1820, and some years later was engaged on behalf of Lord Kingsland in endeavouring to recover for that nobleman the Kingsland estates. His efforts were partially successful. In 1850 Ferguson was appointed clerk and secretary to a commission for arranging the records of the Irish courts, and this office he held until its abolition two years later. By direction of the chief baron, he continued in charge of the records from the time of the cessation of the commission until his death. On one occasion he undertook at his own expense a journey to Switzerland, in order to recover some Irish records in the collection of a Swabian baron. These records proved to belong to the Irish court of king's bench in the reign of Edward I, and it was surmised that they had been purloined in the reign of George I when Addison was keeper of the records in the Bermingham Tower of Dublin Castle. Ferguson purchased them at his own cost, and restored them to the State Paper Office. Ferguson died on 26 November 1855. Works He became a collaborator with William Lynch, author of Feudal Dignities in Ireland, in arranging the voluminous series of \\"Irish Records\\". Extensive collections of documents were formed, some of which afterwards passed into the library of Sir William Betham. Ferguson's most important work was the indexing of the entire body of Exchequer Records in Ireland, which he completed unassisted. The indexes were purchased by the government in order to be permanently deposited in the court of exchequer. In 1843 Ferguson published Remarks on the Limitations of Actions Bill intended for Ireland; together with short extracts from Ancient Records relating to Advowsons of Churches in Ireland. To the Transactions of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society he communicated a calendar of the contents of the \\"Red Book\\" of the Irish exchequer; and to the Gentleman's Magazine (January 1855) he communicated a description of the ancient drawing of the court of exchequer, contained in the above manuscript calendar. To the Topographer and Genealogist he communicated the account of Sir Toby Caulfeild relative to the Earl of Tyrone and other fugitives from Ulster in 1616; a curious series of notes on the exactions anciently incident to tenures in Ireland; a list of the castles, &c.;, in Ireland in 1676, with a note on hearth- money; and a singular document of 3 Edward II, relative to a contest between the king's purveyors and the secular clergy of Meath. Ferguson further contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine two important articles on the neglected state of the Irish State Records (1853‚Äì4), and a paper on the unpublished statutes of Ireland (1855). At his decease he left incomplete a translation of the \\"Norman-French Chronicle of the Conquest of Ireland\\", which M. Michel edited from a manuscript in Lambeth Palace Library.
