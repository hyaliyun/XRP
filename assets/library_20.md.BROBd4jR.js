He is best known for founding the Lincoln Hospital, a medical facility that served Negro patients during a time of racial segregation. Moore was also instrumental to the incorporation of North Carolina Mutual Life Company, which became the largest black-owned business in the country, and the improvement of North Carolina's rural school education. Through philanthropic works and business enterprises, Dr. Moore played a significant role in improving the standard of living of African Americans in Durham. He also overcame racial discrimination, bridging the White and Black communities in Durham in addition to improving its healthcare and economy.  Early life and education  Aaron McDuffie Moore was born on September 6, 1863, in Rosindale, North Carolina, to Israel Moore and Anna Eliza Spaulding Moore. Since the early nineteenth century, the Moore family, of African-Indian-European descent had owned land in Columbus County as free farmers. Like his nine siblings: 4 boys and 5 girls, Aaron Moore alternated between working on the family farm (during the harvesting and planting seasons) and attending the segregated county school. Upon completing 8th grade, Moore became a teacher at the same county school. He entered Whitin Normal School, in Lumberton, followed by the Normal School at Fayetteville to further his education. These institutions were both focused on teacher training, as education was considered key for freedmen's progress and there was an effort to develop black teachers for segregated schools across the state. However, after completing his first term at the latter, Moore was summoned home by his father to help on the farm. = Leonard Medical School = Ambitious beyond farming, Moore enrolled in 1885 in the newly established Shaw University, a historically black college in Raleigh, intending to become a professor. But, encouraged by his teachers who saw his promise, Moore entered the University's Leonard Medical School. Completing the prescribed 4 years of medical education in 3 years, Aaron Moore came before the Medical Examiners of the State of North Carolina in 1888. He passed the examinations and ranked second among the 46 candidates, 30 of whom were white. Having been certified as a Doctor of Medicine, Dr. Moore decided to practice in Durham, where he was the city's first Black medical doctor. =Marriage and family= In 1889, Dr. Moore married Cottie S. Dancy, niece of John C. Dancy, a leading African-American Republican in North Carolina. They had a family together. = Politics = Moore became interested in politics and was nominated for the office of coroner of Durham County in 1888. However, his campaign was met with much resistance from the white community, as shown by coverage in the Durham Recorder: \\"White men of Durham, those who have any respect for the Anglo-Saxon race, will you fail your duty on the 6th of November? Will you allow Negro rule or a white man's government?\\" Dr. Moore was in a campaign marked by racial discrimination, as were many in those years. Whites were still struggling to maintain dominance; by the end of the century while in control of the state legislature, they passed a constitution that essentially disfranchised blacks, a situation that persisted until federal legislation of the mid-1960s to enforce constitutional rights for minorities. Dismayed by the antagonism, Moore withdrew from the campaign and settled for supporting candidates who served the Durham community's interest.  Self-help business enterprise  = Early involvement = In 1895 Dr. Moore began to invest in new black-owned businesses, to enable the community to develop its own skilled educated class and provide jobs for them. The Durham Drug Company was the first of his many ventures. The pharmacy gave young black pharmacists an opportunity to practice and served Durham's African-American community with dignity and excellence. While the pharmacy never made much of a profit, earning profits was not Moore's chief goal. Instead, he made his priority the provision of affordable drugs to the Negro community. He believed that the \\"Negro business movement\\" was a means to achieve racial self-fulfillment. He became involved in numerous other black business ventures in Durham following this maiden enterprise. Through this work, Moore established strong relationships with significant figures such as John Merrick, with whom he would later found the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. = North Carolina Mutual and Provident Association = In October 1898, Dr. Moore, John Merrick and six other Black men gathered in Moore's office to organize an insurance association. They intended \\"to aid Negro families in distress\\" by this enterprise. They were inspired by similar associations organized by blacks in Richmond, Virginia, in 1893 and 1894. During the meeting, each man pledged $50 to the association. They agreed to draw up a charter for the business, to be \\"presented as a bill before the State Assembly\\" in January 1899. With the charter approved, North Carolina Mutual and Provident Association opened for business on April 1, 1899. Dr. Moore served as its treasurer and medical director, albeit without salary or remuneration. In addition, Moore agreed to rent out a part of his office to the association for $2 a month, a sign of his commitment to the Black community served by the association. By 1900, the association was in a precarious financial position as claims increased. In response, Dr. Moore and John Merrick used personal funds to meet the company's obligations. The other incorporators were unwilling to fund the deficit and, by July 1900, withdrew from the company. Dr. Moore understood that African Americans needed insurance services. He also believed strongly that North Carolina Mutual was accountable to the Negro community, and that \\"to desert their policy holders was to discredit their people\\". Moore and Merrick bought the shares of withdrawing members. For \\"socially conscious Black businessmen\\" like Moore, the purpose of business enterprises extended beyond profit; more importantly, it was a means to improve the conditions of the segregated Black community. Moore assumed the vacated position of secretary while his nephew, C. C. Spaulding, promoted the sale of insurance policies. The partnership between Moore, Spaulding and Merrick as President transformed North Carolina Mutual and Provident Association into a strong enterprise. In 1919, the association was renamed North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company. When Merrick died that year, Dr. Moore assumed presidency of North Carolina Mutual until his death in 1923. As President, Moore was insistent that the Company stayed true to the purpose of its founding: :There was a larger truth‚Ä¶ if the Company cannot live on truth, then let her go. Dr. Aaron Moore rooted North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company in its \\"commitment to service\\", bringing much needed insurance services to the African American community in Durham. The access to reliable insurance services ensured that individuals could afford necessary treatment and healthcare services in times of need. Through North Carolina Mutual, Moore also contributed to economic prosperity of the black community in Durham. Inspired by his success, other Black leaders began to enter business, founding the Mechanics and Farmers Bank in 1907 and Mutual Community Savings Bank in 1921. As black business continued to thrive in tandem with North Carolina Mutual, a \\"robust business district in downtown Durham\\" was developed, becoming what became known as the Black Wall Street. The Black business movement contributed significantly to Durham's race relations; while there was interracial friction in other cities, Durham's whites tolerated and some supported its Black businessmen, as their progress benefited the city as a whole. Dr. Moore was thus a key figure who not only stimulated growth in Durham, but also brought social progress to the city.  Lincoln Hospital  Dr. Aaron Moore founded the Lincoln Hospital in 1901. Earlier in 1895, the Watts Hospital was completed, but its services were offered only to Whites. Recognizing the needs of the African American community, Dr. Aaron Moore boldly proposed the construction of a Negro hospital in 1898. While some suggested that a separate wing for Negros be added to the city hospital, Moore rejected the idea, as Black doctors and nurses would not be permitted to work at the hospital. With Merrick's help, Moore \\"raised $25,000 in the black community and $100,000 in the white community\\", $75,000 of which was contributed by the Duke family. The Dukes' contributed based on Moore's advocating for the hospital's merit, and because of their close relationship with Merrick. Moore directed the construction of Lincoln Hospital and oversaw its completion in 1901. He served as its Superintendent until his death in 1923. Under Moore's leadership, the hospital served patients regardless of their ability to pay. It gained an increased in patronage and by 1914, added a new wing. Recognizing the need to train Black nurses, Moore set up the associated Lincoln Hospital Training School of Nursing in 1903. In 1923, when he died, Moore bequeathed three properties to the hospital, an endowment to be used to generate income to fund students of the Lincoln Hospital Training School of Nursing. Moore's most significant achievement was the Lincoln Hospital, which contributed greatly to healthcare in Durham and improved life in the African-American community. By establishing the Lincoln School of Nursing, Dr. Moore ensured a system to provide healthcare personnel for black Durham citizens. Based on funding from both the black and white communities, the Lincoln Hospital was a symbol of racial cooperation and unity for a common purpose. Moore's success in rallying such White support was remarkable in an era of racial discrimination and segregation. With his reputation for competence, he commanded the attention of White leaders and spoke to them as equals. Some whites considered their contributions a kind of thanks for what they saw as Black support during the Civil War. The following was inscribed at the entrance of the Lincoln Hospital: Today, Lincoln Hospital has been absorbed as part of the Duke Regional Hospital, following its merger with Watts Hospital in 1976.  Contribution to education  Dr. Moore advocated education in the African-American community. Besides serving on the Board of Trustees at his alma mater, Shaw University, Moore was also one of the largest donors to the school. He also established a Colored Library in Durham, which became the Stanford L. Warren branch of the Durham County Public Library on January 17, 1940. Besides improving the rural school system for Blacks in North Carolina, Moore also formed the Volkemenia and Shubert-Shakespeare clubs, which were created to provide African Americans with access to concerts, speakers and reading sessions. = Rural school movement for African Americans = With his personal experience in a rural school, Dr. Moore worked to improve these, which were typically underfunded by white local and state school authorities in the segregated system. Moore wrote about the need to improve rural schools in an April 26, 1915, letter to a state official: From 1914 until his death in 1923, Dr. Moore concentrated on improving rural schools for black children. He hired George W. Davis, North Carolina's first rural school inspector, at his own expense. Moore wanted to document the condition of the poor rural schools. Moore raised money for the schools through the Rosenwald Fund, established by philanthropist Julius Rosenwald of Chicago to aid the construction of rural schools, especially for African- American children, as their schools were underfunded. The Fund's contributions were based on matching monies raised by local communities, and also required a commitment by white-run school boards. Black parents were so eager for schools that they often taxed themselves. In order to stimulate school involvement, he proposed that schools must \\"put down dollar for dollar for its own improvements\\". Following Moore's success, the state of North Carolina took over his work while the North Carolina Teachers' Association made him the Secretary-Treasurer of its Rural School Extension Department, a position he served until 1922.  Legacy  A revolutionary Black leader in a time of racial segregation, Dr. Moore is remembered as an individual who \\"transcended his times\\" for his ability to stand as equals with White leaders. Capitalizing on this high ground, he improved standards of living for the African American community in Durham and North Carolina through his contributions to education, healthcare and social enterprises. To the disenfranchised African American community, \\"he emerges from the history of Black Durham as a Messiah moving quietly among the people, giving aid and comfort\\". Race relations in Durham also improved following Dr. Moore's leadership in the Black business movement, which ushered in an age of cooperation between Black and White business leaders. His partnership with the White community in social projects such as the Lincoln Hospital also served to forge stronger bonds between the two races. Today, the Lincoln Hospital is remembered as \\"a monument of [the] spirit of racial cooperation\\". Dr. Moore also spoke strongly against Jim Crow and racial discrimination. This resonated with the larger social movement that eventually brought racial equality to North Carolina and the United States. Today a historic marker stands on 1201 Fayetteville Rd, Durham, N.C. to honor the contributions of Dr. Aaron Moore.  Posthumous recognition  Dr. Aaron McDuffie Moore was recognized as a Main Honoree by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019. The posthumous recognition was bestowed upon 29 individuals \\"whose dedication, accomplishments and passion have helped shape Durham in important ways.\\"  References  1863 births 1923 deaths People from Bladen County, North Carolina Physicians from North Carolina African-American physicians Shaw University alumni Shaw University faculty Medical examiners People from Durham, North Carolina ","title":"Aaron McDuffie Moore"},{"id":"41194429","title":"1968 United States presidential election in New Jersey"},{"id":"41194437","text":"Walter Edwin Gilbert (March 8, 1899 - June 18, 1986) was a Canadian bush pilot and one of the founders of Pacific Western Airlines. Gilbert was born in Cornwall, Ontario. His father worked dredging the Saint Lawrence River. Father and son travelled to Lakeside near Montreal in 1910 to observe an airshow. In World War I, Gilbert joined the Royal Flying Corps, Toronto. He saw little air combat and returned to Canada to work in the Saint Lawrence. In 1921 he was a civilian flyer for the Canadian Air Force in British Columbia. In 1927 he flew forest patrols for the Forest Service. Gilbert landed a regular position with Western Canada Airways in 1928. He was posted to Cranberry Portage, Manitoba as service was in demand for a nearby Sherritt Gordon mine. Settlements along the MacKenzie River were delivered their mail by air. Punch Dickins introduced Gilbert to the run from Fort McMurray to Aklavik. In 1939 Gilbert's experiences on this route were recorded in Arctic Pilot. In 1930 Gilbert took Major L. T. Burwash on a search for Franklin's lost expedition. Their aerial photographs of the Beaufort Sea were much appreciated by navigators and geographers. Gilbert became a member of The Explorers Club, a fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and of the Royal Geographical Society. For his service to Canadian aviation he was awarded the McKee Trophy in 1933. Charles Lindbergh piloting his Lockheed Sirius was in Aklavik in August 1931 and needed assistance getting aloft.

In 1939, as regional operations chief for Western Canada Airways, Gilbert directed Russ Baker to Fort St. John, British Columbia, near Pinchi Lake where service was needed to fly mercury. The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Limited was supplying the increased demands brought on by war. The mine manager Emil Bronlund supplied Baker 400 flasks of mercury, 75 pounds each, in June 1940 to fly out. After the war Baker and Gilbert started Central British Columbia Airlines with financing from Karl John Springer. The company was incorporated July 8, 1945 and for a while Gilbert was President. He and Baker stayed at Devonshire Hotel in Vancouver when the north country was undergoing freeze-up and spring break- up. Over-expenditures were repaid by Baker, but Gilbert balked and was fired by Springer in June 1947.John Condit (1984) Wings over the West: Russ Baker and the Rise of Pacific Western Airlines, pp 20‚Äì3, 54,5, Harbour Publishing From Chilliwack Gilbert provided crop dusting service.

During World War II, he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy, then returned to coach at Idaho in 1946. Wicks later worked in the athletic department and then in university administration, as the associate dean of students. Death Following his retirement from the university in 1966, Wicks worked for the Sigma Nu fraternity. While in Atlanta to visit the chapter at Emory University, he fell ill and died in early 1968 at the university hospital; he had battled chronic lymphatic leukemia since 1960. Personal Wicks married Lela Grace Jain (1906‚Äì1997) of Genesee in 1929. She outlived her husband by nearly three decades, and was a leading citizen in Moscow. Grace entered UI in 1925 and was a member of Pi Sigma Rho sorority, which became Alpha Phi in 1928. Illness from influenza delayed her graduation until 1933, majoring in English with a minor in music. With two older brothers having served in World War I, she assisted in the promotion of the Memorial Gymnasium, which opened in 1928. Grace was a financial advisor in the 1950s, elected a county commissioner in the early 1960s (both very uncommon for a woman at the time), and later the local chair of the Republican Party. A major contributor to the county historical society, she had a long run as a newspaper columnist as a senior for the Moscow-Pullman Daily News, writing right up until her death, which came a day shy The couple is buried together at the city cemetery in Genesee; they had two children, Grace Jain and Donald, and eight grandchildren. Legacy A year after his death, Idaho's recently relocated baseball field () was named for Wicks during the 1969 postseason. In the vast open area at the northwest corner of the campus which includes multiple intramural fields, the name \\"Guy Wicks Field\\" is now primarily attached to the women's soccer field at the western edge. Baseball was dropped as a varsity sport after 1980, and women's soccer was added in the fall of 1998. The university's \\"Guy and Grace Wicks Award\\" annually recognizes two outstanding seniors, based on academic success, campus activities, and service to the university and the community.

It is located in the village of Helgheim, right on the shore of the lake J√∏lstravatnet. It is the church for the Helgheim parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1877 by the architect Jacob Wilhelm Nordan. The church seats about 500 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1322, but the church was not new at that time. The original Helgheim Church was likely a stave church. The medieval church was torn down during the first half of the 1600s and replaced with a timber-framed church. In 1876, construction of a new church was begun beside the old church (and slightly overlapping the footprint of the old building). The old church was torn down as the construction progressed. The new church was consecrated on 28 November 1877 by the Bishop Peter Hersleb Graah Birkeland.

Tran served in the United States Army from 1997-2005, Tom Irwin served in the United States Army from 1986-1988, and Jose Sarduy continues to serve as a Major in the United States Air Force Reserve with 18 years of service. The group has toured together since 2010 with their first show at the Ventura Harbor Comedy Club in Southern California and then across the country. The most recent performance was a 2-hour show when the group filmed their unbroadcast TV special. Origin Story Thom Tran who was already a standup comedian, created the group in 2010 after moving to Los Angeles, California. After performing at a show to benefit the Bob Hope USO at LAX hosted by Los Angeles radio station KETH 101 and the Long Beach Laugh Factory, Tran recruited several other comedians with ties to the military to form the group. Tran met US Air Force veteran, comic Jose Sarduy, who at the time had only been in Los Angeles for 6-months, while Sarduy was performing at the Jon Lovitz Comedy Club at Universal City in Los Angeles, CA. Tran then met fellow Army veteran Tom Irwin at a second benefit for the Bob Hope USO, also at the Long Beach Laugh Factory. Motto's The motto of the group is \\"Standup Comics. All Veterans. Still Serving. One Joke At A Time.\\" The motto was established by Tran, who created the tour. The motto is meant to summarize the group's goal of continuing to serve their fellow service members with their comedy. In 2012, Tran established a second motto, \\"A Comedic Troupe of Troops\\", being a play on the spelling and meaning of the words \\"troupe\\" and \\"troop\\". Performance's After several preliminary shows in Southern California at the Jon Lovitz Comedy Club and the Hollywood Improv, the GIs of Comedy began to tour throughout the continental United States in 2011, including performances at the Comedy Stop in Atlantic City, New Jersey and several stops in Texas. In 2012 Army Entertainment contracted the group to tour with comedians Josh Blue (winner of NBC's Last Comic Standing) and another Army veteran turned comedian, Jody Fuller for the \\"LOL Tour\\" which made stops at Ft. Knox, Kentucky; Ft. Campbell, Kentucky; White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico; Ft. Huachuca, Arizona; Ft. Hunter Liggett, California; Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; Ft. George G. Meade, Maryland, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Maryland; Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington; Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri; and Ft. Riley, Kansas. In 2013, the group continued to tour sporadically because of individual career schedules including a second 2-day performance at Ft. Knox, Kentucky; an abbreviated performance at the Army Ball in Long Beach, California; a benefit performance for the Non-Commissioned Officers Association Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada; and a series of quarterly performance at the Comix at Foxwoods Comedy Club in Connecticut, but with the main focus of the year being to film their broadcast television special on November 2, 2013 in Buffalo, New York. Live special On November 2, 2013, the GI's of Comedy filmed a 2-hour live special to be edited for broadcast and a special edition DVD.

Overall numbers for certified organic livestock remain low compared to the overall U.S. swine numbers, with approximately 12,000 animals in 2011. However, since 1992, stocks have increased dramatically, with an annual growth rate of 20 percent in total U.S. organic stock. Additionally, there are thousands of non-certified organic swine herds which are not accounted in official statistics, but where farmers still use organic production practices. Consumer demand, stemming from the larger organic agriculture movement has helped spurred growth in this industry. The overall segment, although minuscule compared to the conventional national average, still represents a strong and growing segment in U.S. pork production. The definition of organic swine according to the USDA National Organic Program (NOP), is largely unchanged:  Organic swine production prerequisites  *Animals for slaughter must be raised under organic management from the last third of gestation. Producers are required to feed livestock agricultural feed products that are 100% organic., but may also provide allowed vitamin and mineral supplements.USDA-National Organic Program, 2013.

Challenges in Feeding Organically Raised Pigs * Antibiotics * Artificial hormones * Animal by-products * Grain by-products unless produced from certified organic crops * Chemically extracted feeds (such as solvent-extracted soybean meal) * Synthetic amino acids Organic producers take pride in their systems management and perceived animal husbandry. Swine production requires the use of a number of breeds, crossbreeding with both conventional breeding and artificial insemination utilized by producers.Van Diepen, Pauline, et al., 2007. Livestock breeds and Organic farming systems. Organic Center Wales. Breeds utilized by organic producers vary depending on the region, management system, and products in demand. Many larger farms will use common breeds such as, Duroc, Berkshire, or Chester White, while others will use exotic breeds for artisan meats, especially on European farms. The high biodiversity of organic farms provides many ecological services that enhance farm resilience to a large extent.Lammerts Van Buren, E.T., et al., 2011. The need to breed crop varieties suitable for organic farming, using wheat, tomato and broccoli as examples: A review. NJAS - Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences, Vol. 58, Pg. 193‚Äì 205 Integrated farming systems involving both crop and livestock production in a closed system can reduce financial risk for the producer, since organic producers generally receive premiums or higher prices for their products sold that cover and possibly reduce disease risk so long as there is no outside contact with other pigs or animals, such as cows, or poultry. Common organic swine housing 235px Since the requirements of organic swine systems require outdoor access and greater space requirements per animal than conventional systems, breeds and breeding management are very important for producers. The environment (geographical location, housing, contact with other animals) of the animal is one of the most important determinants of disease risk and exposure for organic swine. Typical controlled animal feeding operation (CAFO) production is characterized by slatted flooring; no bedding, controlled feeding, and strict production sectioning and isolation between groups. Typical organic systems include the following: = Hoop house/ traditional barn system = 380px Simple structures originally developed in Canada, built at low cost, approximately a $4 (USD) reduction per pig. These structures allow for low-odor, high ventilation, but in colder temperate zones, hoop buildings present challenges for producers to overcome, including proper bedding and disease management.Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, 2012. Hog Production Systems, Page 3. SARE Nationwide Learning Center; They are used by organic and conventional producers alike to manage large fluctuations of pig flow numbers for larger systems. Traditional barn structures, with access to both indoor and outdoor environments are also common systems for producers. = Pasture-based systems = Outdoor pig production has historical traditions, especially in Europe. Both the sows and finishing pigs are kept permanently on pasture, including during winter months for sows. The majority of growing or ‚Äòfeeder‚Äô pigs are moved indoors for the fattening period, e.g. to a deep litter system.Thamsborg, S.M., et al., 1999. Integrated and biological control of parasites in organic and conventional production systems. Veterinary Parasitology No. 84 Pg. 169‚Äì186. Animals are more environmentally adapted to outdoor surroundings, as breeding and genetics play an important role. Additionally, a major difference between conventional, outdoor production and organic production is the high proportion of silage and roughage in the organic feed. Therefore, finding adequate protein and proper nutrition are often challenges for many farmers. = Forest based systems = A third major system is a traditional forested or Mediterranean pastoral system. This involves indigenous and exotic breeds pastured in natural forests for the production of high-value cuts for restaurants or specialty foods. Furthermore, living semi-wild, all phases of production take place outdoors, sometimes in extreme conditions. Swine populations in this case are extremely low compared to world averages. Management is similar to pasture raised swine where animals will have less direct contact with humans with larger areas to roam and root. Finding adequate protein and proper nutrition are challenges, depending on the breed and environment and geographic location.  Common organic swine diseases  Organic livestock are not immune to diseases, and are likely to share the same overall disease statues with regard to contagious diseases at the national herd level.M. Hovi, J. Zastawny and S. Padel, 2004. Enhancing animal health security and food safety in organic livestock production. Proceedings of the 3rd SAFO Workshop. Sustaining Animal Health and Food Safety in Organic Farming, University of Reading. At all stages of the life cycle, animals may be exposed to diseases and in the case of organic swine, without the availability of normal industry drugs and prophylactic medication; as internal parasites are a large component of risk.Kouba, Maryline, 2003. Quality of organic animal products.Livestock Production Science Vol. 80, Pg. 33‚Äì40 Cross species exposure and contamination are direct concerns for many producers. Internal parasites and cohabitation of animals can lead to exposure, depending on local environment conditions and herd population. In fact, in a 2003 study from 31 organic chicken flocks sampled for bacterial pathogens, 13% were positive for Salmonella and 35% for campylobacter, as contact with other animals cited as the primary exposure route.Rodenburg, T.B., et, al., 2004. Campylobacter and Salmonella infections on organic broiler farms. Wageningen University and Research Centre, Lelystad, The Netherlands. Additionally, cross contamination on integrated livestock can be problematic, but is dependent on a multitude of variables, including density of the livestock operations, introduction of replacement breeding stock, sharing of facilities, etc. Pigs raised according to general organic certification requirements are as susceptible to diseases as conventional breeds, based on genetics, environment, and diet. Pork diseases vary widely based on localized region and country. Generally, organic production requires extensive management and can be more labor-intensive than conventional systems, where access to Many producers do give vaccines for E. coli, pseudorabies virus, bordetella bronchiseptica, porcine parvovirus, and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae among others.QC Supply, 2013. Common Swine Diseases. Guides and Resources; It is particularly important to tailor individual farm health security measures according to existing disease status of the swine stock, in order to guarantee financial sustainability of required investments.Stott, A. W., Lloyd, J., Humphry, R. W. and Gunn, G. J. (2003) A linear programming approach to estimate the economic impact of bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) at the whole-farm level in Scotland. Preventive Veterinary Medicine, 59: 51-66. In many European countries where certain diseases have not been detected, (PRRS, TGE, swine fever, etc.) vaccines are not usually given. In organic pig production, respiratory diseases and lameness have been cited as the most common health detriments, and depending on the location, a lesser prevalence exists conventional production.Bonde, M., and J.T. Sorensen, 2004. Herd health management in organic pig production using a quality assurance system based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points. Department of Animal Health and Welfare, Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences; Tjele, Denmark.Vaarst, M., A., et al., 2000. Animal health and welfare aspects of organic pig production. In: T. Alfoldi, W. Lockeretz & U. Niggli (Eds), Proceedings of the 13th International IFOAM Scientific Conference, 28‚Äì31 August 2000, Basel. VDF Hochschulverlag an der Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich, Zurich, P¬∑373¬∑ Van Der Fels-K. Since antibiotics are not allowed to maintain the organic integrity of an animal, some producers will forgo antibiotics altogether, even with sick animals occurring in the system. However, according to USDA-NOP Guidelines, antibiotics and other treatments that no longer make the animal organic are required to maintain overall herd health. The use of antibiotics in herds with organic fattening pigs is lower compared to herds with conventional pigs. This is probably a result of the alternative system leading to a lower infection level, since no difference in mortality pigs could be discovered.Kongsted, A.G., and J.E. Hermansen, Organic pig production ‚Äì With particular reference to Danish production conditions. Danish Institute of Agricultural sciences, Department of Agroecology, Research Centre Foulum. As a large percentage of organic pork production systems are pasture-based, or not living on concrete, a degree of risk is present from soil based pathogenic exposure. There are options for producers, including organically approved bio-control agents, diatomaceous earth (DE), and acidified grain rations, among others. However, many of these contain anecdotal evidence only, and the study on pasture rotation to control parasitic infections is largely unknown and research is required.Thamsborg, S.M., et al., 1999. Integrated and biological control of parasites in organic and conventional production systems. Veterinary Parasitology No. 84 Pg. 169‚Äì186. = Exposure risk in pasture swine systems = 265x265px A degree of risk to exposure to swine diseases is observed in pasture swine systems. Especially in Europe, but not limited to the region, pasture or soil related parasites are important to consider, as several studies in northern temperate climate have indicated that outdoor production have resulted in heavier and more prevalent helminth (parasitic worms) infections as compared to conventional intensive production under indoor conditions. Because pigs are rooting animals and will dig up and consume soil at varying amounts, the exposure route makes control a difficult management option for organic producers. Additionally, parasitism risk can be greater in regions where worm eggs remain viable in the soil for extended periods and can reinfect populations.Edwards, Sandra, 2011. ÔøΩKnowledge Synthesis: Animal Health and Welfare in Organic Pig Production.Newcastle University. Core Organic; Tjele, Denmark. The potential risk of introduction of parasitic worms will depend on the prevalence of the infection in the environment, neighboring farm prevalence, pasture management and other preventive measures including waste and dead animal disposal. Additionally, toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii is prevalent in organic pastured systems for swine. Although commonly occurring in uncooked meat, toxoplasmosis has been also found in outdoor livestock systems, where controlled, indoor swine environments have been dramatically reduced.Dubey, JP; Jones, JL, 2008. Toxoplasma gondii infection in humans and animals in the United States. International Journal for Parasitology 38 (11): 1257‚Äì78.Dubey, JP (2012 Sep). Foodborne toxoplasmosis. Clinical Infectious Diseases 55 (6): 845‚Äì51. A large degree of risk does exist with the potential of Toxoplasma exposure, although many farms currently remain free of this pathogen.Kijlstra, Aize, et al., 2004. Toxoplasma gondii Infection in Animal-Friendly Pig Production Systems. Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science. vol. 45 No. 9 3165-3169 Although not as serious as other diseases (Toxoplasma gondii does affect and can kill animals with weak immune systems), uncooked meat from the animals in question can contain the disease. The significance of parasitic infections with respect to health and productivity in pigs under organic outdoor systems remains to be documented. Such diseases do pose risk in pasture systems. Since there are generally fewer population numbers, risk of transmission to other animals is lower, yet exposure to feces and cross-contamination from other animals is a possibility. Providing proper nutrition is necessary to avoid weak immune systems and provide greater resistance of pathogens‚Äîutilizing proper forages, grasses, and mineral availability are necessary.Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, 2012. Hog Production Systems, Part IV. Educational Resources; For instance, good quality forage can replace up to 50% of grain and supplement needs for many sows in pastures.Shurson, Jerry, et al., 2002. Designing Feeding Programs for Natural and Organic Pork Production. University of Minnesota Extension. Organic producers should maintain buffers and adequate housing to maintain proper swine health. The issue of cannibalism, by sows eating piglets, or pigs eating a diseased pig of the same size can be a concern. There is evidence that suggests this is a growing concern in outdoor and pasture systems. = Exposure risk in hoop house/ barn systems = Animals in traditional barns and hoop buildings show less risk than with animals in pasture raised systems. Although density numbers are generally larger than that of pasture systems, most animals still have access to outdoors and air movement. Although organic rules do not require hardened floors, most (but not all) systems have animals on concrete and shy from soil based systems to avoid rooting. Many barns utilize straw for bedding and warmth, particularly in cold weather regions. Therefore, toxoplasmosis has not been found in such systems where animals have concrete flooring. Such soil- based pathogens, including Trichinella spp are in lower levels in hoop house/barns.Kijlstra, Aize, 2005. Animal health in organic livestock production systems: a review. Wageningen University and Research Centre, Lelystad, The Netherlands. As stated earlier, since every system is unique, it is difficult to state hoop house/barn systems posing a less risk as it should be defined by a case-by-case basis. However, in many farms, exposure to fomites, (cats, rodents, unfiltered air from poor ventilation) is a large concern for producers in all production systems. As vectors, such animals that carry zoonotic diseases can infect and destroy herds very rapidly. Respiratory diseases that are common among conventional swine farms are still possible to be contracted in these organic systems. PRRS, Circovirus, and clostridial enteritis, among others, can be present in these systems. Crowding, mixing of groups, and diets all play a role in disease risk management, and sound holistic management including proper feed rations, vaccines, bedding, are used by organic producers to manage diseases and maintain herd health. Certain risks do exist and should be noted. Raccoon, pests, and other fomites that can bring farm-to-farm disease transmission may use bedding for nests.Brumm, Michael C., et, al, 2004. Hoop Barns for Grow-Finish Swine. MidWest Plan Service. Iowa State University; Ames, Iowa. Off-farm purchased straw and other outside inputs as such can carry diseases and should therefore be monitored. Regarding stocking density, buildings should provide for the species, age, comfort, and well-being of the animals.Compendium of Animal Health & Welfare in Organic Farming, 2007. http://www.organicvet.co.uk/ This is an important tool is managing disease risk, including limiting issues such as tail, ear, and vulva biting. Other considerations The quarantine period of animals purchased from other farms, an important consideration in swine health, is necessary to acclimate the animal and reduce immediate disease exposure. Both in the U.K., and U.S., there are no quarantine requirements and testing procedures for incoming stock, unless individual certification regulators implement barriers for animals coming from conventional farms. Other measures common in both conventional and organic systems must be taken into consideration, such as farm visitors, preventing exposure to contaminated ground water, and disinfection of buildings among others. Additionally, closed system (all-in, all-out) production is important, as is off-site finishing of market animals. Keeping the breeding herd and the farrowing of sows on another farm is often preferred and utilized by producers. Such measures usually involve sound management and are not always a result from housing and environment considerations of the animal. For instance, diarrhea in piglets (scours) can be of concern and many producers utilize late-weaning of piglets, where the animal is over six weeks old at separation. This is likely to decrease problems associated with post-weaning including the risk of viral and bacterial infections. These are not unique to organic or conventional farms. Overall, such external challenges (including disease management) facing organic livestock farms can be similar to those facing similar conventional farms in the same region; where the treatment options usually differ. Risk of organic swine diseases can be high depending on geographic region, breeds, and farmer management. If those conditions are met, certain risks of parasites can affect swine herds. Based strictly on systems, pasture raised organic pork could lead to parasitic worm ingestion from rooting, although actual cases reported have been minimal. Other environmental factors of pasture including temperature and nutrition make management more challenging. Organic systems with concrete flooring, utilizing barns, hoop houses etc., controlled feeding, pose the lesser amount of risk of disease exposure than pasture based systems. Prevention, rather than treatment is the best option for organic swine producers. To do this, sound holistic management and utilizing all tools available as allowed by the National Organic Program and other international programs are essential.

It is one of two churches for the √Ölhus parish which is part of the Sunnfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1795 by the architect Gunder Gregoriussen St√∏fringshaug. The church seats about 168 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1322, but the church was not new at that time. The medieval stave church was likely built during the 13th century. In 1660, a tower was constructed on the west end of the church. In 1795, most of the old church was torn down and a new church was rebuilt on the same spot. A newer portion of the old church was not torn down, but instead it was used as the choir of the new church. The new church was designed by the architect Gunder Gregoriussen St√∏fringshaug. The architect also incorporated a door from the old church in the new church. The old door dates back to the 12th or 13th century. It is said that the door originally came from a castle that belonged to Audun Hugleiksson. The church was restored in 1868 and again between 1947 and 1951.

Down 38‚Äì37 against the No. 25-ranked Bulldogs with 36 seconds remaining in the game, the No. 7-ranked Auburn faced 4th down and 18 yards to go when junior quarterback Nick Marshall threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Ricardo Louis. The pass was accidentally tipped by Georgia's sophomore safety Josh Harvey-Clemons and freshman Tray Matthews as each tried to catch the ball. This accidental deflection surprised Louis, but it allowed Louis to catch the ball and to run away from both Harvey-Clemons and Matthews into the end zone for the game- winning touchdown. The score allowed Auburn to take a 43‚Äì38 lead that the team would ultimately preserve to break the tie in the all-time Georgia-Auburn American football series. Name As teammates sprinted to congratulate Ricardo Louis in the end zone, Auburn IMG Sports Network commentator Rod Bramblett exclaimed \\"A miracle in Jordan-Hare! A miracle in Jordan-Hare!\\" in utter jubilation, his voice carried across the nation on radio stations broadcasting the game. Within four days, T-shirts were being sold with Bramblett's words \\"Miracle at Jordan-Hare\\" printed across the top. Other sources modified the phrase, The War Eagle Reader dubbing the moment \\"The Miracle in Jordan-Hare,\\" The Gadsden Times proclaiming the play \\"Marshall's Miracle\\" and USA Today pitching several titles including \\"The Marshall Miracle.\\" On the same day, at 10:44 p.m. CST, a story entitled \\"The Prayer at Jordan-Hare! Auburn wins 43‚Äì38!\\" was posted to the website of Huntsville's NBC affiliate WAFF. Within days the title had been replicated or simultaneously concocted by writers with The Birmingham News, USA Today, The Montgomery Advertiser, WRBL in Columbus, Georgia and Fox Sports among many others. The phrase gained popularity among Auburn fans, the slogan incorporating their stadium with a catchy rhyme and the phrase seemingly intertwined with the 1986 Bon Jovi hit \\"Livin' on a Prayer,\\" a popular anthem played at Auburn football games. Many titles sprung forth over the following week including \\"The Hail Aubie\\" in reference to the name of Auburn's mascot tiger, \\"The Saint Louis Arch\\" fusing the receiver's surname with the arc-like path of Marshall's throw as a pun on the famous landmark arch in St. Louis, \\"Tip to the Lou\\" as an alteration of the children's song \\"Skip to My Lou\\" and \\"The Inaccurate Reception\\" as a modification of the renowned \\"Immaculate Reception\\" in the 1972 AFC semifinals. The website AL.com posted an online poll to allow fans to vote on the above titles, adding \\"Tip, Georgia, Tip\\" as a takeoff of the legendary game Punt Bama Punt, \\"Dawg Gone Miracle\\" as the victory came against the Bulldogs, \\"Nick of Time\\" using Marshall's first name, \\"The Miracle on the Plains\\" as the nickname for Auburn, Alabama is \\"The Loveliest Village On The Plains\\" penned by poet Oliver Goldsmith and \\"The Miracu-Louis Reception.\\" The poll included another frequently published title \\"The Immaculate Deflection,\\" in fact one of the three most popular in the voting results along with \\"Tip to the Lou\\" and \\"The Prayer at Jordan-Hare.\\" The title was even printed on shirts and posters by various companies. Rivalry The Auburn‚ÄìGeorgia rivalry is one of the oldest in the NCAA, dating back to 1892. Because of this, it is nicknamed the \\"Deep South's Oldest Rivalry\\". Weeks before the 2013 Auburn‚ÄìGeorgia game, The Roosevelts website ranked this rivalry as the 13th greatest in college football. There were 116 matchups across 121 college football seasons preceding 2013. *In the first meeting in 1892, Auburn won 10‚Äì0. *In 1896, Georgia won 12‚Äì6 to complete its first undefeated season under coach Pop Warner. *In 1916, Auburn won 3‚Äì0 after its kicker Moon Ducote kicked a 40-yard field goal off of Auburn player Legare Hairston's leather helmet. This resulted in a rule change clarifying that field goals must be kicked directly off of the ground. *In 1942, Auburn handed Georgia its lone loss of the season, 27‚Äì13. That Georgia team would beat UCLA in the Rose Bowl and claim a national championship. *In 1959, Georgia quarterback Fran Tarkenton led a comeback to a 14‚Äì13 Georgia victory, as Georgia snapped a 6-game losing streak in the series. *In 1982, two future Heisman Trophy winners faced off in this game, Georgia's junior running back Herschel Walker and Auburn's freshman running back Bo Jackson. Walker led No. 1 ranked Georgia to a narrow 19‚Äì14 defeat of unranked Auburn. *In 1983, Auburn's 13‚Äì7 victory over Georgia resulted in the Tigers claiming an SEC championship. *In 1986, Georgia won as three-touchdown underdogs at Auburn 20‚Äì16. When Georgia fans stormed the field, the sprinkler system and hoses went off soaking people both on the field and in the stands. *In 1994, Georgia ended Auburn's 20-game winning streak with a 23‚Äì23 tie, the last tie in the series before overtime was introduced. In 1996, Georgia defeated Auburn in four overtime periods 56‚Äì49, 4OT; it was the first SEC game to go to overtime. *In 2002, No. 7 Georgia defeated No. 22 Auburn 24‚Äì21 to secure its first SEC Championship Game appearance. Georgia would win its first SEC championship since 1982 later that season. *In 2004, No. 3 Auburn defeated No. 8 Georgia 24‚Äì6. That Auburn team would finish an undefeated (13-0) season with a win over Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl and claimed a national championship. On November 16, 2013, No. 7 (BCS) Auburn (9‚Äì1, 5‚Äì1 SEC) hosted No. 25 (BCS) Georgia (6‚Äì3, 4‚Äì2 SEC) at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn, Alabama with the series tied at 54‚Äì54‚Äì8. Auburn was seeking revenge for a 38‚Äì0 loss to Georgia the previous season. Auburn had struggled in the 2012 season, the program's worst since 1950, finishing with a 3‚Äì9 record while going winless in the SEC. The team's plummet from a 2010 national championship claim to the bottom of the conference was the worst two- year decline for any college football team since the introduction of the Associated Press poll in 1936. This resulted in the firing of head coach Gene Chizik and hiring of Gus Malzahn. Adding insult to injury, on April 23, 2013, Auburn's landmark oak trees at Toomer's Corner were cut down, declared unsalvageable after being poisoned by Harvey Updyke, Jr., an Alabama fan, during the weekend of December 3, 2010. The 130-year old trees held a special place in the hearts of Auburn fans who rolled them with toilet paper after each football victory for at least forty years. The earliest documentation of this tradition dates back to a 35‚Äì20 victory over Georgia on November 13, 1971. Game Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium The 2013 Auburn-Georgia game was held on November 16, and featured two programs moving in opposite directions. The Georgia Bulldogs, ranked No. 5 in the preseason AP Poll, had dropped to a disappointing No. 25 after losses to Clemson, Missouri and Vanderbilt. Meanwhile, the Auburn Tigers had been unranked until the 8th week of the season when they debuted in the AP Poll at No. 24, riding a six-game win streak in their ascension to the No. 7 spot by the Georgia game. Observers speculated that the return of the Bulldogs' starting running back Todd Gurley from an ankle injury would bolster Georgia's chances of an upset. At 2:40 p.m. CST, with overcast skies and 66 degrees, Georgia's Marshall Morgan kicked off to Auburn whose 16-play, 56-yard opening drive stalled at the Georgia 5-yard line. The Tigers settled for a 22-yard Cody Parkey field goal. Auburn dominated the first half, scoring on five of their first six drives. With 1:07 remaining in the half, the SEC touchdown leader Tre Mason scampered for a 24-yard touchdown giving the Tigers a commanding 27-7 lead. Meanwhile, Georgia had gone three-and-out on three of their first four drives. They rounded out their final two drives by throwing an interception and scoring a late field goal to make the halftime score 27-10. Both teams squandered an opportunity for three additional points during the game, points that would have been crucial to the outcome of the game. With 3:10 left in the 2nd quarter, Auburn's Cody Parkey had a 36-yard field goal attempt blocked. In the 3rd quarter, Georgia elected not to allow sophomore kicker Marshall Morgan to attempt what would have been a 56-yard field goal despite the fact that he had hit that distance before. Instead Georgia elected to keep their offensive players on the field for the fourth down play‚Äîan incomplete pass thrown by Murray. This resulted in Auburn's offense getting the ball. Through the first 50 minutes of the game, Auburn had scored on seven of nine possessions with 29 first downs building a 37‚Äì17 lead. In contrast, when Georgia began their first possession of the fourth quarter they had only reached the end zone once on their previous six drives. Auburn maintained that 20-point lead until 9:35 left in the game when Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to senior Rantavious Wooten to cut the deficit to 13 points. After another touchdown and trailing 37‚Äì31, Georgia's offense started at Auburn's 45-yard line after a short punt, and drove 38 yards setting up 1st- and-goal at Auburn's 7-yard line. The drive stalled when the Bulldogs gained only two yards on three plays. The Bulldogs elected to keep their offensive players on the field for the 4th down and goal play. Aaron Murray ran 11 yards line on a quarterback sneak to score a controversial touchdown that gave Georgia a 38‚Äì37 lead. When instant replay was shown, some thought Murray's left knee made contact with the ground prior to the football crossing the goal line after colliding with Auburn defenders Jake Holland and Ryan Smith. That would have nullified the score and Auburn's offense would have taken over on downs with a 6-point lead. However, the officials unable to find indisputable evidence to overturn the touchdown ruling on the field. The officials counted the touchdown, which was Murray's last score away from Georgia's home field. Overall, Murray would lead his team to three touchdowns in the span of 7:46, the final touchdown giving Georgia their first lead of the game with 1:49 remaining. While the Bulldogs had scored on three consecutive drives, Auburn failed to earn a single first down in the entire fourth quarter until one minute remained on the clock. After the ensuing kickoff, Auburn's offense took over at the 22-yard line having scored only three points in their previous four drives. Their stagnant offense had not found the end zone in over 23 minutes of play and had only crossed the 50-yard line once since their opening drive of the second half. After gaining a first down at their own 35-yard line, Auburn lost eight yards on the next three plays culminating with Jordan Jenkins' sack of Nick Marshall. With 36 seconds left, Auburn used its second of three timeouts to discuss their fourth down play. As Auburn retook the field, Georgia used its first timeout to discuss their fourth down defense. Auburn needed 18 yards for a first down that would keep their chance for a victory alive. Play Ricardo Louis (pictured in 2016) caught the deflected pass from Nick Marshall for a 73-yard touchdown to give the Tigers a 43-38 lead During the timeout Malzahn called a play he dubbed \\"Little Rock,\\" something he had drawn up late in 1998 while coaching Shiloh Christian School in the Arkansas state playoffs. The play involved one receiver running deep on a post route while another would run a shallow dig route far enough to make the first down. Typically this play did not call for sophomore Ricardo Louis to be on the field but Malzahn said \\"Let's put Ricardo at five (the deep post route) and Sammie on the boundary (the shallow dig route).\\" The pass was designed to go to the shallow receiver, sophomore Sammie Coates, for a first down. But the planned deep receiver Louis begged quarterback Nick Marshall to throw him the ball instead. Louis dreamed of making a big play, inspired by the words of his receiver coach Dameyune Craig who frequently challenges his players with the question \\"What's going to be your legacy?\\". Both teams took the field after consecutive timeouts, Auburn facing 4th down and 18 from their own 27-yard line with 36 seconds remaining in the game. Marshall took the snap and made a five-step drop to his own 17-yard line. Sammie Coates found himself wide open near midfield, but Nick Marshall stepped up to the 20-yard line and heaved the ball 47 yards downfield to Ricardo Louis in triple coverage. Coates dropped his head, too nervous to watch the outcome. The overthrown pass sailed beyond Marshall's intended receiver as Georgia's freshman safety Tray Matthews leapt for the interception at the 23-yard line. But his teammate, sophomore defender Josh Harvey-Clemons, also jumped for the interception and tipped the ball with his right hand causing it to ricochet over Matthews' helmet. The redirection allowed the overthrown Auburn receiver to catch up to the pass. Auburn's Louis could not initially find the deflection as the football fluttered over his head, but his peripheral vision located the ball over his left shoulder just as it reached his outstretched hands. Louis juggled the ball at the 15-yard line, finally gained control at the 9, looked over his left shoulder finding no one in pursuit and bounded into the south end zone for the touchdown with 25 seconds remaining. Terrified suspension turned into roaring triumphant celebration from the stunned crowd as Louis reeled in the catch. A 7-play, 78-yard drive had just been capped off by a 73-yard score as the Tigers took the lead 43‚Äì38. Penalty flags lay on the field, but the fouls were against Georgia players for taking their helmets off while the play was still going. This meant the play counted as a touchdown for Auburn. Broadcaster calls * Commentators Verne Lundquist and Gary Danielson called the game on television nationally for CBS's SEC coverage. This is how Lundquist called the play: Gary Danielson added his assessment after the play: * Commentators Rod Bramblett and Stan White called the game on radio for the Auburn IMG Sports Network. When Bramblett later reflected on calling the play, he doubted anything would ever compare to it and admitted he was not sure of the words he had chosen in his excitement. Here is how he called the play: Bramblett concluded the game by calling the final play and celebration as follows: * Scott Howard and Eric Zeier called the game on the radio for the Georgia Bulldogs Sports Network. Here is Scott Howard's coverage of the notable touchdown: Eric Zeier responded to the penalty flags on the field by adding: The flags were actually thrown for offsetting unsportsmanlike penalties, one for Georgia players removing their helmets and one against defensive lineman Gabe Wright for excessive celebration. Final drive Following the final touchdown, Auburn attempted a two-point conversion to extend the lead to seven points but Jonathan Wallace's pass fell incomplete. Georgia was left with 25 seconds in the game at their own 25-yard line after Auburn's Cody Parkey kicked the ball beyond the end zone for a touchback as he had on all nine of his kickoffs during the game. In the following 22 seconds, Aaron Murray threw two passes for 50 yards as Georgia reached Auburn's 25-yard line. When Auburn senior lineman and leading tackler Dee Ford jumped offside, Georgia advanced to the Auburn 20-yard line with a first down and three seconds on the clock. Auburn called their final timeout. On the last play of the game Ford hit Murray at the 20-yard line as he released an incomplete pass sealing the victory for Auburn. Georgia coach Richt felt the hit could have been penalized for targeting but even Murray himself disagreed, calling it a clean hit. The teams combined for 81 total points in the game, second only to the 1996 quadruple overtime thriller in which Auburn and Georgia combined for 105 points. Scoring summary Aftermath The play was featured on SportsCenter that evening as ESPN's top play of the day in the world of sports. Murray commented on the loss to Auburn stating, \\"It's like a nightmare. This is going to be a tough one to get over.\\" One week later, as Georgia hosted Kentucky with 2:17 left in the 1st half, Murray suffered a torn ACL, ending his college career. The Prayer at Jordan‚ÄìHare combined with other results that same weekend allowed Auburn to take a No. 4 ranking into its other major rivalry game, the Iron Bowl against the No. 1-ranked, two-time defending national champions Alabama. Tied nearing the end of regulation, an Alabama field goal attempt was caught by Auburn's Chris Davis in front of the goal posts, and returned for a game-winning touchdown in a play commonly referred to as the Kick Six. Auburn's victory propelled them into the AP top five over the next week. On the same day, #4 ranked Stanford was upset by unranked USC 20-17, allowing Auburn to be promoted to #6 in the subsequent AP Poll. The following Saturday during Auburn's bye week, two upsets occurred by a combined 58 points when unranked Arizona knocked off #5 ranked Oregon and #10 Oklahoma State defeated #3 Baylor. Auburn was promoted to #4 in the AP Poll as a result. This loss, combined with South Carolina's victory over Florida the same day, knocked Georgia out of contention for the SEC East title. Georgia would fall out of the BCS standings and most of the major polls after this loss, and a win over unranked Kentucky the next week was not enough to get the team back in the rankings. With backup QB Hutson Mason making his first start for Georgia in their season-ending in-state rivalry with Georgia Tech, Georgia won 41-34 in double overtime. Georgia finished the regular season at #23 on the AP poll and #22 on the BCS standings, and was defeated by Nebraska 24-19 in the 2014 Gator Bowl. In their next game, Auburn hosted in- state rival and #1 ranked Alabama in the season-ending Iron Bowl, whose winner would also clinch the SEC's western division. Tied 28-28 with one second remaining, Alabama attempted to kick a game-winning field goal, but it fell short and was caught by Chris Davis, who returned it for a 100-yard touchdown to win the game 34-28. Auburn went on to beat Missouri in the 2013 SEC Championship Game. This win, along with #10 Michigan State defeating the #2 Ohio State in the Big Ten championship, pushed Auburn to #2 in the BCS rankings, and faced the #1 Florida State Seminoles in the 2014 BCS National Championship Game (where Auburn lost 34-31, ending the SEC's seven-year national championship reign). Nominations and awards Nick Marshall's last- second 73-yard touchdown pass was recognized as one of four nominees for 2013 Best Play in the world of sports at the 2014 ESPY Awards under the name Auburn Hail Mary. But another Auburn play won the category, Davis FG return, which was the final play of Auburn's following game (the 2013 Iron Bowl).

The fair, founded in 1997, is held in West Palm Beach and exhibits the works of international artists, ranging from \\"the most promising emerging talent\\" to masters. Art work exhibited includes photography, painting, design, fine art glass, sculpture, and video. Art Palm Beach is the largest fair of its kind in the Palm Beaches in terms of attendance, square footage, and total sales conducted by its exhibitors. History Art Palm Beach was established in 1997 in South Florida and it has been the longest running mid-winter fair dedicated to contemporary, emerging, and modern masterworks of the art of the 20th and 21st centuries. Art Palm Beach is yearly organized by IFAE/Next Level fair founders David and Lee Ann Lester who were the original founders of Art Miami, Art Asia Hong Kong, American International Fine Art Fair, and Art Boca Raton. Video, performance art, art installations, and new technologies have become unique features of the fair offering collectors exposure to today‚Äôs emerging art trends. Art Palm Beach 2018 In January 2018, the 21st edition of Art Palm Beach was held in South Florida. Next Level Fairs reshaped the art fair concept of Art Palm Beach at the event by connecting exhibitors and collectors in new dynamic ways. Visitors at the event took part in an immersive art experience as they gained access to crucial information about art and collecting in a comprehensive manner that reflects today‚Äôs modern art market. = Shawn Kolodny's 'Fake Fulfillment Center' installation = Following the massive success of the Fake Fulfillment Center‚Äòs debut at Art Basel Miami Beach 2017, New York-based artist Shawn Kolodny set up an immersive art installation at Art Palm Beach. Fake Fulfillment Center explores society‚Äôs struggle and obsession with fulfillment, incorporating fashion, addiction and social media into one collective experience. The exhibition was designed to be social media-friendly, allowing the audience to interact with each room or station within the space that encompassed a different theme. At the Miami display, Kolodny held his quintessential ‚ÄúAddicted to Fashion‚Äù room at the start of the experience as guests donned lab coats and entered the space. Inside, his popular Prada artwork incorporated into vials and pill bottles was displayed in a picturesque, mirrored room. The rest of the exhibit featured everything from giant pill bottles where guests got to enter inside for photos, to a social media-inspired Twister, zen capsule garden and so much more. At the end of the exhibition was Kolodny's most shiny capsule series - an 18 karat gold capsule pendant with 164 nearly flawless, round cut diamonds. Jewelry designer, Yohan Rodrigani took one of Kolodny's most iconic artworks and transformed it into wearable art jewelry.  Art Palm Beach 2019  ‚ÄòInside the Dragon Breath‚Äô Installation at APB2018 / Stefano Ogliari Badessi Celebrating its 22nd edition January 16-20, 2019, it is the largest art fair in the Palm Beaches dedicated to contemporary, emerging, and modern works of art from the 20th and 21st centuries.

The species is typically associated with natural environments and is found in soil, water, and sewage. E. cowanii is associated with plant pathogens that exhibit symptoms of severe defoliation and plant death. This species, originally referred to as NIH Group 42, was first proposed in 2000 as a potential member of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The name of this species honors S. T. Cowan, an English bacteriologist, for his significant contributions to the field of bacterial taxonomy. Phenotypic characterization Enterobacter cowanii is phenotypically defined as being a Gram-negative, motile, and facultative anaerobic bacterium. The morphology of this bacterium is described as being cream colored when cultured on non-selective, YDC (Yeast extract-dextrose- CaCO3) medium. When tested for enzyme production, E. cowanii is asparagine and catalase positive, while also being urease and oxidase negative. When originally introduced as NIH Group 42, seventy traditional phenotypic characteristics were determined and listed by Kohaku et al. Genotypic characterization The diversity of strains present in the Enterobacter cowanii species have been confirmed through analysis of DNA G+C content and DNA-DNA Hybridization results, which involves the hybridizing (annealing) of putative strains to E. cowanii LMG 23569T. A DNA similarity of 70% or greater indicates that strains of interest are the same species. When testing for DNA- DNA similarity comparing the rpoB gene of E. cowanii, the strains BCC 009, BCC 011, BCC 078 showed 76% to 92% DNA similarity. N.B. Using a multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) approach, based on partial sequencing of protein- encoding genes (gyrB, rpoB, infB and atpD), this species has been reclassified to the genus Kosakonia, so that its name is more properly given as Kosakonia cowanii. Microbiology Isolates of Enterobacter cowanii were extracted from leaf tissue of the Eucalyptus trees. To determine the overall relatedness of the isolated strains, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was utilized. The 16S rRNA gene is commonly implemented for sequencing and inferring relatedness of isolates, because it is highly conserved. Phylogenetically related strains of E. cowanii, determined through 16S rRNA gene sequencing and rpoB gene sequencing, include BCC 078, BCC 074, BCC 008, BCC 011 and BCC 009. Diversity When comparing the DNA from a representative strain of NIH Group 42 and DNA from 35 other species of Enterobacteriaceae by DNA-DNA hybridization, it was found that the degree of reassociation ranged from 5‚Äì38% at 70 ¬∞C. Because of its unique phenotypic characteristics and its distinct separation from other species of Enterobacteriaceae by DNA hybridization, there is sufficient evidence that constitutes E. cowanii a separate species in the family Enterobacteriaceae.

Awards The teams presenting their projects at the 2014 expo. During the expo a number of awards will be given away in addition to the grand prize award. Cornell Cup USA, presented by Intel Grand Prizes The top 3 highest total score winners will be awarded first, second, and third Cornell Cup USA, presented by Intel Grand Prizes respectively. Winners are typically announced during the final day of the expo. The grand prize winner will receive $10,000. Second place team will receive $5,000. Third place team will receive $2,500. People's Choice Award During the Cornell Cup Expo, all competition participants will be able to have a single vote for their choice of team. These votes will determine the winning team. People's Choice Award will go to the team receiving the most participants' votes but did not win one of the 3 grand prizes. Wild Card Award Teams that have successfully submitted an application, but were not chosen as finalists are allowed to submit a final report. Their final report must follow the same rules and guidelines as the finalists. The Wild Card Award is given to a team who were deemed strong enough by the review judges. Media Award Each of the finalist team must create an On-line Chronicle blog using the template provided by the competition. They must also generate social network and media buzz by publishing updates on various channels. The Media Award are judged by members of the media, which is based on team blogs, online channels, and their presentation at the expo. The top two teams will receive $1,000 awards. Entrepreneurship Award In 2014 the competition added a new award, the Entrepreneurship Award, where teams can create a business plan around their Cornell Cup project which could be pitched to venture capitalists. The award was created due to a great interest by past teams that wanted to turn their creative competition inventions into entrepreneurial opportunities after the Cup's final expo. The winner of the Entrepreneurship Award will receive $2,500. Past Winners The teams presenting their projects at the 2014 expo.

Natural features The park is in the high Sierra Nevada mountain range at an elevation of around . It is covered in mixed coniferous forest with tree species such as Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), white fir (Abies concolor), Sierra lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. murrayana), California incense cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), and red fir (Abies magnifica). Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) are part of the local fall foliage display.General Creek Trail. California Department of Parks and Recreation. This forest is not pristine, having been subjected to heavy logging in the late 1800s. Wood was used by miners in the Comstock Lode and other great mineral deposits. Long- term fire suppression and periods of drought and bark beetle infestation have altered the fire regime. Controlled burns are used to help prevent very destructive wildfires. The park is bisected by General Creek, a stream about 15 kilometers long which runs from the Desolation Wilderness into Lake Tahoe. On the General Creek Trail along the stream there are lakes, mountain meadows with wildflowers, and two large moraines. The trail leaves the park and enters Eldorado National Forest. In the summer, the high temperature is about and the low is near . Winter highs reach about 40 ¬∞F and the coolest lows are below . The park receives about 32 inches of precipitation in an average year, mostly in the form of snow in the winter. History The area was inhabited by the Washoe people, who made a summer home on the lakeshore. Their stone mortars can be found in the park. The trapper William \\"General\\" Phipps was the first white settler on the land. The cabin he built in 1860 still stands. In 1903 the wealthy San Francisco banker Isaias W. Hellman obtained land and built the Pine Lodge, now also known as the Hellman-Ehrman Mansion. The house was designed by Walter Danforth Bliss and featured electric lighting, indoor plumbing, and water directly from the lake. The estate included a tennis court, two boathouses, and cabins for the 27 resident staff.Hellman-Ehrman Mansion. California Department of Parks and Recreation.

The Isobarik is known for both its reproduction of low bass frequencies and being very demanding on amplifiers. Launched in 1973, the Isobarik DMS, Linn's maiden and flagship loudspeaker was based on and named for the isobaric loading principle invented in the 1950s. The speaker exists also as the Isobarik PMS - destined for the professional market. Although discontinued in 1992, it remains popular among audiophiles.  History  While other loudspeaker manufacturers sought to outperform each other to produce more quantum bass output from their products, Linn was seeking clear undistorted low frequency bass. Linn theorised a design whose bass could go all the way to DC and be without fundamental resonance. The quest for that extra octave of \\"dry and extended bass sound\\" and more accurate reproduction resulted in the Isobarik. Linn launched the original Isobarik DMS loudspeaker in 1973, the year following the release of its first product, the Sondek LP12. \\"DMS\\" is the contraction for \\"domestic monitor system\\", and is designed to be driven passively in the home setting - it incorporated a crossover within the loudspeaker cabinet. The Isobarik PMS (\\"professional monitor system\\") loudspeaker launched in 1977, destined for the professional market is without the internal crossover. This latter configuration opens up more wiring and driving options, in particular active operation and tri- amping. The Linn-patented cone-to-magnet (in-phase) arrangement in a sealed enclosure, as used in the Isobarik. The Isobarik is so named as it employs the isobaric loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted in a sealed container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used a variant of the isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units (\\"woofers\\") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974. In 1988, Linn externalised the crossover of the DMS to boards with nominal 4-ohm impedance designed to lie flat at the base of the stands. Upon that change, the original distinction between DMS and PMS disappeared along with the suffix designation. The \\"DMS\\" was thus discontinued, although \\"Isobarik PMS\\" remained on price lists until the speaker was discontinued in 1992.  Speaker  Linn brochures dwell little on performance specifications, mentioning somewhat vaguely that the frequency response \\"varies by only a few db from 20 Hz to 20 KHz with the isobaric loading extending usable bass response to below 10 Hz\\". Linn also claimed \\"very low distortion\\" and \\"high sound pressure levels\\", without quantification. Recommended amplifier power rating is in the range of 50-500 watts. Hi-Fi for Pleasure noted that the speakers' impedance, although quoted at 3 ohms nominal, dipped considerably at some parts of the audio spectrum. This made the DMS Isobarik very hard for amplifiers to drive, potentially causing many amplifiers' output protection to trip. Equally, the two heavy woofers in each Isobarik made them twice as power-hungry. Such demands happened to make Naim amplification the perfect match because of its high current delivery capabilities and its toleration of near short circuits. The Isobarik was famously used as the acid test for the budget-priced NAD 3020 amplifier at its UK launch. In the 1970s, the DMS Isobarik, available in a number of veneers, sold for ¬£1,000. As part of their corporate philosophy, Linn intended significant dealer involvement in customer education and decision-making, and included teaching customers how to listen correctly for musical attributes. The trial and evaluation of the product prior to purchase and dealer's expert installation are considered by Linn to be important parts of the value added of their top-end products. As such, no instructions were supplied with the product. The Isobaric PMS retailed at ¬£2,400 including stands in May 1991, and the 4-ohm crossover was priced at just under ¬£500.  Design  As a three-way loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are mounted on the top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375 Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3 kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience. The Isobarik, like the Sara and Kan that were developed in the 1970s and 80s, was designed to work best near room boundaries. Manufacturer's leaflets advise positioning of the speaker close to a rear wall and approximately from corners. The trade- off is the less than solid stereo image. Linn declared forthrightly that loudspeakers that were not designed to work tight against a wall were without merit. According to Art Dudley of Stereophile, Linn also maintained provocatively that \\"anyone who would design, manufacture, buy, sell, or positively review a loudspeaker made to be installed away from room boundaries was a fool\\". In early product manuals, Linn recommended using the Isobarik PMS in tri-amped configuration with Naim amplifiers. Three NAP 250 amplifiers, fed by a 3-way Naim electronic crossover, would typically be used, one for each pair of the doubled-up treble, midrange and bass units. From its introduction in 1984, the monaural NAP 135 can be used in a \\"6-pack\\" configuration. After Linn had started manufacturing electronics and upon the release of the Isobarik Aktiv crossover, Linn declared that the 'AKTIV' system comprises: the source components plus one Linn LK1 preamplifier, one Linn Aktiv Isobarik crossover, three Linn LK2 power amplifiers, one pair of Linn Isobarik loudspeakers and the necessary cables.  Construction  Late Isobarik tweeter, Linn D20-LP-2 with the concentric circles and Linn logo. The D20-LP-1 lacked the Linn Logo, sourced from Hiquphon in DenmarkThe loudspeaker cabinet measures . The extremely rigid 55-litre cabinet is constructed using 19mm high-density particle board that is strategically damped in places, and extensively braced. According to the manufacturer, there is an array of stressed steel rods inside the enclosure to control energy flows. The techniques employed ensure that energy that would have caused the unwanted motion of the front panel and drivers is cancelled by a similar but opposite energy from the upward facing units, resulting in the minimum amount of resonances. The cabinets were initially made by Linn in their own factory, but the manufacturing was later outsourced to furniture-makers Leon Levin of Glasgow. Although the speaker uses bought-in drivers, they have been rebuilt using stronger materials. Drivers' metal baskets are treated to reduce the effects of vibration, and the enclosure designed and constructed to control energy. The drive units (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from KEF in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet. However, Linn found the T27 tweeter too fragile and replaced it with the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak after a very short run; the Scan- Speak tweeter was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark. The midrange KEF B110, known for its use in the LS3/5A BBC monitor, is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping. The woofer is a KEF B139. Each unit of the Isobarik cabinet weighs , and is designed to be placed on stands that are tall so that the tweeter is positioned at the listener's ear-level. The speaker is supplied with heavy stands made from welded square cross-section tubing, to which top and bottom spikes are fitted prior to positioning the speaker cabinet. Input connections are established through 3-pin XLR connectors. Later versions and the PMS version have banana sockets (see image).

Source:Linn  Reception  The Isobarik loudspeaker has received some polarised opinions, although Hi-fi News noted that the speaker kept its promise by managing to \\"play the lowest bass guitar notes cleanly and give an impression of unlimited bass extension\\". The Linn/Naim triamped active system, using a LP12 source, Naim amplification and electronic crossovers together with the Isobarik PMS, was regarded as the pinnacle of \\"flat-earther\\" hi-fi systems, and the speaker is integral to the general aura of mysticism that went with the Linn/Naim equipment.  Other Isobarik products  The Linn Kan, which shares two of the drive units of the IsobarikThe Isobarik Sara is a product concurrent with the PMS for the whole of its life. This 2-way, 4-ohm, design was a physically much smaller product - measuring - that required tall speaker stands. Launched in 1978, it was Linn's entry-level loudspeaker until the Kan (a non-isobaric bookshelf speaker using the same Linn D20-LP-1 and KEF B110 drive units as its big brother) was released. The Kan was discontinued in 1990. In the late 1980s, Linn worked on a replacement for the Isobarik. The project bearing the codename \\"Isobarik LS2000\\" became the Keltik. Although the final product does not bear the Isobarik name, the technology was mentioned in marketing materials and the product manual.

God‚Äôs Mercy Surmounting Man‚Äôs Cruelty, Exemplified in the Captivity and Redemption of Elizabeth Hanson. Philadelphia, 1728, 4-40. Five months after capture, a French family ransomed Elizabeth and her two children in Canada. Her husband was then able to secure them and find another daughter before having to return home, leaving the eldest daughter, Sarah, behind. Elizabeth's captivity narrative became popular because of its detailed insights into Native American captivity, which was a threat to the people in New England due to the almost constant wars with the Native Americans and French in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Her religious take on her experiences was heavily emphasized in her story.  Biography  Hanson was born Elizabeth Meader, the youngest of four children. Her parents were John Meader Jr. and Sarah Follett. Little is known about her life before captivity other than her wedding date, July 23, 1703, to John Hanson, when she was nineteen. The two had seven children together. Because Elizabeth and her family were Quakers, they refused to take refuge in the garrison when the Abenaki first attacked their area during Dummer's War.Strong, Pauline. Captive selves, captivating others: The politics and poetics of colonial American captivity narratives. Westview Press, 1999, 162. Elizabeth and four of her children, Sarah, Elizabeth Jr, Daniel, and her two week old daughter, were taken from her home in Dover, New Hampshire on August 27, 1724. They were held captive by Native Americans until early 1725. Two of her six children, Caleb and Ebenezer, were killed during the capture. The first was killed to intimidate them and the other because he wouldn‚Äôt be quiet and the Indians were afraid they would be discovered. Their journey from New Hampshire to Canada was difficult especially because Elizabeth had given birth two weeks before hand. The lack of nourishment and clothing resulted in inadequate milk production and therefore had a hard time feeding her baby. The youngest barely made it to the camps where the Native American women showed her how to make a nut milk that saved her life. The second eldest, Sarah Hanson, was separated from her mother and taken to a different group.Coleman, Emma. New England captives carried to Canada: Between 1677 and 1760 during the French and Indian Wars. Bowie, MD: Heritage Books, 1989, 161-166. Her third daughter, Elizabeth, and her female servant were taken shortly after, which left Elizabeth with her son Daniel and new born baby daughter. After enduring abuse from her captors and master, she was detained by the French and held for ransom in Canada. The French people that saved her were Jesuits and Catholics, not Quakers like herself. A catholic priest baptized her youngest daughter. They declared her name to be Mary Ann Frossways and gave her back to Elizabeth. Her husband John Hanson was able to retrieve Elizabeth, Daniel, and Mary Ann from Port Royal, Canada in 1725.VanDerBeets, Richard. Held Captive by Indians: Selected Narratives, 1642-1836. University of Tennessee Press, 1973, 131-150. He freed them by paying their ransom to the Native Americans and French. Due to the trade agreement between the French and Native Americans, Sarah married Jean Baptiste Sabourin to escape captivity and she decided to remain in Canada apart from her family. John Hanson attempted to go back to retrieve Sarah once more in 1725 but perished along the way to Canada in Crown Point, New York. Her captivity narrative Elizabeth‚Äôs story, God‚Äôs Mercy Surmounting Man‚Äôs Cruelty, explored her captive experience and reflected highly on her religion. Such views allowed the use of her narrative to spread the Quaker ideals of households and the role of women. Elizabeth attributed her family‚Äôs survival to ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs mercy‚Äù rather than the leniency of her Native American captors and the French who ultimately secured their freedom. She criticized the native American practices of feasting when there is food and starving when there is not instead of making the surplus last. When the mother-in-law of her Abenaki captor defended her and assuaged him from killing her, she believed it was not because of the woman's legitimate authority, but that it was God's will that she lived.Little, Ann. Abraham in Arms: War and gender in colonial New England. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007, 119. Elizabeth Hanson died in Dover, New Hampshire in 1737. Captivity narratives became a new genre of literature that was born during this period due to the overwhelming number of accounts of Native American capture. The first edition of her captivity narrative was published without a title page in the Pennsylvania Gazette in December 1728. Samuel Keimer released an edited copy later in the same year. The next depiction of Elizabeth‚Äôs captivity was most likely written by Samuel Bownas, a Quaker and friend of Elizabeth‚Äôs who renamed the story An Account of the Captivity of Elizabeth Hanson, which was published in 1760. These many different edits evolved from the actual account of a woman's capture and rescue to a story revolving around the social parameters of women in early colonial New England. These versions were distributed to influence the behavioral standards for Quaker women in the new colonies.

Most of the sections of Stroubles Creek that flow through Blacksburg and the Virginia Tech campus are piped underground, while the portion that flows through Montgomery County is above-ground. Stroubles Creek has been designated an impaired waterway since 2002.  Physical characteristics   Stream  The Virginia Tech Duck Pond is formed by a dammed section of Stroubles Creek. Stroubles Creek flows into the New River, which then flows into the Kanawha River, the Ohio River, the Mississippi River, and finally the Gulf of Mexico. There are two branches that merge at the Virginia Tech Duck Pond: the Main Branch and the Webb Branch. Downstream of the Duck Pond, many tributary streams flow into Stroubles Creek, including Slate Branch and Walls Branch.  Watershed  The Stroubles Creek watershed, a subwatershed of the New River watershed, is . The Stroubles Creek watershed is further divided into an upper and a lower watershed, with the Virginia Tech Duck Pond acting as a divider between the two. The Upper Stroubles Creek watershed is approximately , and it is heavily impacted by urbanization in Blacksburg and on the Virginia Tech campus. The Lower Stroubles Creek watershed includes some urbanized areas on the western side of the Virginia Tech campus, but then it flows mostly through rural lands until it reaches the New River. The watershed is located in karst terrain, with limestone formations, sinkholes, and natural springs. The stream bed is made up of cobbles and pebbles with alluvia-floodplain deposits (stratified unconsolidated silt, clay, and sand with lenses).  History  European settlers first moved into the Stroubles Creek area in the 1740s. It acted as a water source for the settlers, although today the New River is used as the water source for the area. In 1798, the town of Blacksburg was founded in the upper Stroubles Creek watershed. In 1851, the Preston and Olin Institute was opened, which would later become Virginia Tech. In 1937, Virginia Tech's Drillfield was constructed, which resulted in the main branch of Stroubles Creek being culverted underground. The Virginia Tech Duck Pond was also created at this time when a dam was constructed where the two branches merged.  Pollution incidents  The Stroubles Creek watershed has experienced pollution going back to the 1800s. From the 19th century to the 1930s, coal mining wastewater contaminated the watershed. From 1970 to 1978, chemical waste from the Virginia Tech chemistry labs was discharged directly into the Duck Pond. In 1985, kerosene was spilled into the Duck Pond. And in 2006, of fuel oil were spilled into the stream from a local hardware store's above- ground storage tank. In the 1970s, the Clean Water Act prompted the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to monitor the lower portion of the stream downstream of the Duck Pond. The DEQ classified lower Stroubles Creek as benthically impaired in 1996 and 1998. In 2002, Stroubles Creek was included as an impaired waterway in the Virginia total maximum daily load (TMDL) list of impaired waterways. The Virginia Tech Department of Biological Systems Engineering (BSE) conducted a study on the stream in 2003, and a TMDL implementation plan was completed in 2006 by the Center for TMDL and Watershed Studies through the BSE department.

It lies at the geographic co-ordinates of latitude 24.238609, longitude 88.697776. There is a masjid situated near Sagarpara Bazaar, opposite Sagarpara High School. Sagarpara is located under Sagarpara police station in West Bengal. It is 2.5 kilometres from the Padma River. History Like many other small villages in Ganges Delta, Ramakantapur, Sagarpara was a small river port during the time of Mughal. Until the year of Indian independence in 1947, it was just a small village backed by a port to ferry jute through Jalangi River, a tributary of Padma River. The partition of India saw Sagarpara grow due to an influx of settlers from East Bengal. The Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 saw another surge of refugees in this Village located only 2.5 kilometres from the Bangladesh-India border. Population and commerce in Sagarpara was growing fast after 1971 due to new settlers who preferred to build a house in this Village due to its high land surrounded by small rivers. The village does not get flooded because it is located on the high natural barrage side of the river. It survived like a water-locked island during devastating floods of 1978 and 1997, which forced its neighboring population to migrate into the village. Economy The local commerce is based on export of jute, banana, cucumber, brinjal, onion, other vegetables, grain and betel leaves. The village has nearly 500 shops and 30 small industrial units (SIU).

The story revolves around US return student Karthik, who pledges to marry his uncle Dhanunjay's daughter Indu, which was his mother's wish. A small family feud ends with both the families getting separated. He joins Indu's college to convince her to marry him but mistakenly assumes Bhagyam is Dhanunjay's daughter. Later, Karthik realizes that Indu is his cousin, but she is already in love with another man. He gets entangled in a risky situation when he tries to help a stranger. The rest of the story is all about how he controls the damage and fulfills the wish of his mother. The film was launched on 13 February 2013 in Hyderabad.

The film released in theaters worldwide on 29 August 2014, the eve of Vinayaka Chathurthi, to mixed reviews from critics, with most of them labelling it as a regular mass film. It was also dubbed in Hindi under the title The Super Khiladi 2 by Goldmines Telefilms.\\"NTR's Rabhasa opens to decent reviews\\". The Times of India. 29 August 2014. Retrieved 29 August 2014. Andhra Box Office reported that the film collected a gross of about in its lifetime run and declared it a Utter Flop at the box office. Plot Karthik (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) returns to India after completing his graduation in the United States, and his mother (Jayasudha) decides to get him married her brother Dhanunjay's (Sayaji Shinde) daughter Indu (Samantha Ruth Prabhu). When Karthik's father (Nassar) goes to Dhanunjay's house to ask the same, he gets insulted. Dhanunjay plans to be a mayor and Karthik decides to teach him a lesson and marry his daughter. Firstly, he kills the possibilities of Dhanunjay becoming a mayor. Later he joins Indu's college to somehow convince her for the marriage, where he encounters Bhagyam (Pranitha Subhash) who falls in love with him whom he misunderstood as Dhanunjay's daughter. Conflicts arise between Karthik and Indu. By the time he comes to know that Indu is his cousin and not Bhagyam, he has broken up with Bhagyam because of Indu's revenge. Karthik ends up challenging Dhanunjay, who then approaches a gangster Obul Reddy (Ajay). Indu acts as if she loves Karthik so that she can escape from there and find her lover whom she never saw. That person helped her friend elope with her lover on the night of her marriage and neither Indu nor that person knows each other's features and looks. On seeing Karthik's photograph, Obul Reddy asks his whereabouts as he was that person who helped his brother's fianc√©e who actually was Indu's friend who eloped with her lover that night. Meanwhile, Karthik and Indu escape from there and on learning her love story, Karthik decides to help her and gives up his word given to his mother. Meanwhile, Karthik saves Peddi Reddy (Jaya Prakash Reddy) from Gangi Reddy's (Nagineedu) men and Indu poses as Karthik's lover who eloped with him as her parents did not approve their marriage and also a gangster is looking for them. As an act of gratitude, Peddi Reddy takes them to their house where they are kept in safe custody. But shockingly they find out that Obul Reddy is Peddi Reddy's son and Indu's friend actually was Gangi Reddy's daughter. The person who helped Gangi Reddy's daughter that night from her marriage was Karthik himself and he is unaware that the person who spoke to him in a phone to help that girl was Indu. Indu is unaware that Karthik was that person whom she loves. Dhanunjay uses this situation and introduces Nandu as that person who actually is the son of a rich millionaire with whom Indu's marriage was planned by him. Obul Reddy and his brothers bring a liar named Raju (Bramhanandam) and misrepresent him as the person who helped the bride run away that night. But he is not killed instantly as the bridegroom, Obul Reddy's brother Bulli Reddy (Sravan) who is in a coma due to Karthik, has to kill him once he recuperates. He is cheated on several occasions by Karthik, who meanwhile manages to create a good impression in Indu when he unites Gangi Reddy and Peddi Reddy, thus rescheduling the marriages, and saves Nandu from Peddi Reddy when he broke the house's ancestral statue by taking the blame himself. Indu proposes Karthik to marry her and declares that she cannot live without him. But he is not in a position to accept her proposal as Dhanunjay warned him before that if he makes Indu fall in love, he would reveal that Karthik helped Gangi Reddy's daughter to escape thus breaking the newly formed bond between the two families. Thus he rejects her proposal and sacrifices his love for the welfare of the two families. After an unexpected fight with Obul Reddy, Karthik is confronted by Peddi Reddy and Gangi Reddy, who now know the truth. They forgive him and the marriage of Peddi Reddy's daughter happens as scheduled, with Karthik and Indu getting married in the presence of their parents on the same day at the same venue. The families of Gangi Reddy and Peddi Reddy are united and all are happy except Dhanunjay. Cast * N. T.

Thus they wanted to sign the protagonist of Kandireega, Ram and actress Shruti Haasan to play the lead roles in the sequel during the pre- release time of Ram's Endukante... Premanta!. However, reports emerged that N. T. Rama Rao Jr. would replace Ram in Kandireega 2. Later the makers officially confirmed that the film was shelved and they decided to make a film with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. in the direction of Santosh Srinivas and Samantha Ruth Prabhu was selected as the heroine, who too signed a three-film-deal contract with Suresh with Jabardasth being the first one and this film being the second. The film was titled Rabhasa and it was said that it was a film in city backdrop and is not the sequel to Kandireega. The film was launched at Hyderabad on 13 February 2013. N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Santosh Srinivas, Bellamkonda Suresh, Bellamkonda Ganesh Babu and others attended the film's launch. Later in September 2013, it was reported that the film's title had been changed as the makers felt that the title Rabhasa didn't suit the film's story. It was also reported that the film was titled as Joru. However, in December 2013, Bellamkonda Suresh confirmed that Rabhasa was the working title of the film and added that he would announce the official title later. At the end of January 2014, it was reported that Koratala Siva was directing a part of the film since Santosh Srinivas was suffering from jaundice. The announcement of Koratala Siva and N. T. Rama Rao Jr.'s film in early November 2013 added fuel to the rumors. However, in early February 2014, Koratala Siva clarified to the media that he was not directing Rabhasa, was not a part of the film in any way, and was busy with other projects. At the end of April 2014, it was said that the selection of title might take some time as the makers had a strong belief in numerology, making it an important basis for the title selection. However, in early May 2014, the title Rabhasa was registered by the producers. Santosh Srinivas later revealed that he had received a few suggestions from N. T. Rama Rao Jr. for improvements to the script. In late August 2014, Telugu director V. V. Vinayak provided voice-overs for a few sequences in the film. Casting N. T. Rama Rao Jr. was signed on to play the main protagonist. It was stated that he would play a role of 4 shades, one of them being a playboy and another being a responsible family member. To complement the role, it was reported that N. T. Rama Rao Jr. would undergo a style makeover with a different hairdo as one of them. It was stated that Santosh wanted to change the hairdo of N. T. Rama Rao Jr. to make it one of the differentiating factors in the film. Samantha Ruth Prabhu was selected as the heroine of the film, marking her third collaboration with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. after Brindavanam and Ramayya Vasthavayya. It was reported that she would sport a bikini in the film, to which she responded angrily that it was just a rumor but she added that she didn't mind being glamorous. It was reported that prominent Tamil actress Nazriya Nazim was recruited to play one of the main characters, thus marking her Telugu debut. However, it was reported that Nazriya Nazim backed out of the film due to creative differences with the producers. Sources added that Nazriya was not comfortable to participate in a shoot of intimate scenes and the director's decision to not to remove those scenes from the film made her walk out from the film. When questioned, Nazriya responded that they all were rumors and she wasn't approached by any producer for a Telugu film. Pranitha Subhash, who rose to fame with Trivikram Srinivas's directorial Attarintiki Daredi, was signed in as the other heroine of the film. Coincidentally, both of them were the lead actresses in Attarintiki Daredi. Santosh added that she would portray the role of a typical Andhrite girl and that her role was a vital one in the film. However, it was also said that there would be no combination scenes of Pranitha Subhash and Samantha Ruth Prabhu in the film. Sources added that Pranitha Subhash would appear in the second half possibly while Samantha Ruth Prabhu would appear in the first half of the film. But in early February 2014, the above news was reported to be false. As per production sources, it was said that N. T. Rama Rao Jr. would have a romantic track with both the heroines in the film and the second half would have some nice scenes between the three actors; they added that Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pranitha Subhash would be fighting with each other for the hero in this film. Since early March 2014, it was reported that Malayalam actor Mohanlal would have a prominent cameo in the film, marking his return to Telugu cinema after a cameo appearance in Gandeevam, which had released in 1994. However, when contacted, the source close to the development said, \\"The news is fake and Mohanlal is not doing any role in Rabhasa\\". At the end of April 2014, Brahmaji said in an interview to a leading daily that he was playing a negative character in the film. In early May, it was confirmed that the film was going to feature N. T. Rama Rao Jr. in two very different ways and one of them would be a hilarious one. In mid-June 2014, it was reported that N. T. Rama Rao Jr. had choreographed the introduction song in the film. The same was confirmed by Santosh Srinivas in mid-July 2014. Filming The principal photography started on 2 August 2013 at Banjara Hills in Hyderabad. Later some action sequences were shot near Tellapur, which is located in the outskirts of Hyderabad. With this, the first schedule of the film's shoot was wrapped up. After the completion of the schedule of Ramayya Vasthavayya, N. T. Rama Rao Jr. joined the sets of the film and the shooting commenced in Ramoji Film City, where some action scenes were shot in a house set erected in Ramoji Film City. After the completion of the action sequence, a song was shot with the leads there. Then the unit proceeded to Pollachi in Tamil Nadu for a couple of weeks schedule shoot. The shooting continued in November 2013 at Ramoji Film City where a fight sequence between N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Sayaji Shinde's gang was shot. After a brief gap due to ill health, Samantha Ruth Prabhu joined the sets of the film in early December and some vital scenes on N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Samantha Ruth Prabhu were shot at Hyderabad in that schedule. After wrapping up the schedule there in first week of December, the unit proceeded to Jaipur for a month-long schedule. Later in the second week of December 2013, after shooting some important scenes at Ramoji Film City, the shooting continued at the Gandharva Mahal set in Hyderabad, where scenes on N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Brahmanandam and Samantha Ruth Prabhu were shot. Later on in early January 2014, the shooting continued at Manikonda in Hyderabad, where a huge set was erected for this purpose. After taking a break on account of Sankranti, the new schedule started at Gandharva Mahal set at Manikonda from 18 January 2014 where a family song was shot in which the leads participated. The introduction song of the hero was shot with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and few dancers at Pollachi in the end of January 2014. In early February 2014, romantic tracks on the leads were shot at Pollachi. In mid-February 2014, it was reported that a song on the leads would be shot at Annapurna Studios and Ramoji Film City using the choreography of Raju Sundaram. The song shoot was completed on 18 February 2014. A song was shot on N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Samantha Ruth Prabhu at Ramanaidu Studios from 26 February 2014. It was announced that 4 of 5 songs had been shot completely and that Santosh Srinivas would continue directing the talkie part after the remaining song's shoot, as he had been suffering from jaundice for the previous few months. When the song shoot continued in Hyderabad, the shooting was disrupted due to unexpected rains. On 5 March 2014, a press note was released which stated that the film's foreign schedule would start on 16 March and that schedule, along with the last song's shoot, would continue for 40 days which would end the film's principal photography. Due to unknown reasons, the final schedule started on 10 April at the Aluminium Factory in Gachibowli at Hyderabad. There the introduction fight sequence of the hero was shot using the choreography of Ram-Lakshman and FEFSI Vijayan. The schedule continued till 10 May and Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Pranitha Subhash and others partook in the shoot. It was said that by the end of the schedule, 80% of the film's talkie and songs would be completed. In a week's time, some family scenes were shot in Hyderabad along with the introduction fights. Later, crucial scenes on N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Samantha Ruth Prabhu were shot at Gandharva Mahal set near Manikonda in the third week of April. In the first week of May, the climax sequences were shot in and near Hyderabad. On 11 May, Samantha Ruth Prabhu rejoined the shoot of the film. At Ramoji Film City, a song was shot on N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and Samantha Ruth Prabhu for a couple of days under extreme heat which was tweeted by the latter in her micro blogging page at Twitter. After a break due to shoot of Kaththi, Samantha Ruth Prabhu rejoined the sets of the film on 1 June 2014. By the second week of July 2014, the complete shooting was wrapped up except for a song and some patch work scenes. Some comic scenes were shot on N. T. Rama Rao Jr. and few other comedians at a five-star hotel in Hyderabad. For the shoot of the last song, the film's unit traveled to Italy for the last schedule. Because of Visa issues, the team chose Switzerland to shoot the last song and the shoot started on 16 July 2014. The film's team returned from Switzerland on 22 July 2014 and the final shot featuring all the actors and actresses was shot at Ramoji Film City Hyderabad on 23 July 2014 thus wrapping up the entire principal photography. Soundtrack S. Thaman was signed as the music director of the film since Santosh Srinivas and Anoop Rubens failed to be on the same page. In mid-February 2014, reports emerged that N. T. Rama Rao Jr. would sing a song in this film thus turning a singer again after singing in his previous films Yamadonga, Kantri and Adhurs. The film's soundtrack was released by hosting a promotional event on 4 August 2014 at Shilpakala Vedika in Hyderabad through Aditya Music label.

It is a cutaneous condition usually characterized by redness, thickening, and inflammation on the left side of the neck below the angle of the jaw where the instrument is held. Acne-like lesions and cysts may form at the site due to foreign body reactions, and infections may also occur due to poor hygiene. The primary causes of fiddler's neck are constant friction and local pressure. It is well known among professional orchestra musicians but is \\"not well recognized by dermatologists\\", and a red mark on the left side of the neck under the jaw \\"functions as an identifying sign\\" of a violinist or violist \\"in public without seeing the instrument\\". Although the presence of fiddler's neck is sometimes used as an indicator of a violinist's skill, or 'battle scars' from constant practice, many violinists never develop fiddler's neck, due to differences in skin sensitivity, playing habits, and the materials used in the construction of the instrument. An accomplished professional player could practice hard their whole life and never develop fiddler's neck.  Signs and symptoms  Fiddler's neck usually involves highly localized lichenification, mild hyperpigmentation, and erythema where the chin rest or instrument body presses against the skin of the neck. Other signs and symptoms include scale buildup, cyst and scar formation, papules and pustules related to local infection, and focal edema. In Blum & Ritter's study in West Germany (1990), they found that 27% of their population had only minor issues, 72% had a palpable mass at the site, and 23% reported pain and other signs of inflammation such as hyperthermia, pulsation, and cystic, pustular, or papular lesions. Size of masses were an average of 2 cm in diameter ranging up to 4 cm, some being associated with purulent drainage, continuous discharge, and crusting. Dystrophic calcinosis cutis has also been reported. Other serious sequelae include sialolithiasis of the submandibular gland and adenolymphoma of the parotid gland. The histopathology of fiddler's neck frequently shows hyperkeratosis and acanthosis, along with plugging of follicles. Histiocytic infiltration with granulomas to foreign body and follicular cysts are also common. Foreign body granulomas are thought to derive from abrasion of the wooden surface of the chin rest and its absorption into the superficial dermis. The location and complex mechanism of causation for fiddler's neck give rise to a wider spectrum of skin changes when compared to contact dermatitis from more common irritants. Fiddler's neck can be differentiated from rosacea and sarcoid reaction with granulomas.  Causes  The proximal causes of fiddler's neck are friction and pressure, but both repetitive shearing stress and occlusion with consequent trapping of sweat give rise to progressive damage. This damage along with poor hygiene predisposes the area to local infection, and such infection can progress to scarring and other long-term effects. Hot weather is reported to exacerbate fiddler's neck, as are tiredness, playing emotional music, and playing in smaller groups where individual stress is higher. Type I hypersensitivity reactions may also be involved, particularly to rosewood and ebony in the chinrest and tailpiece, as well as to varnish of the instrument body when chinrests are not used and to rosin deposits on the instrument and on chin cloths. Nickel or other metal allergies are common causes if the chin rest has a metal clip that comes into constant contact with the skin. Rosin exposure in particular may lead to abietic acid dermatitis. Diagnosis  Differential diagnoses  The differential diagnoses of fiddler's neck include branchial cleft cyst, disease of the salivary glands, tumors of the parotid gland, psoriasis, lichen planus, contact dermatitis, herpes simplex and similar infections, and insect bites and stings especially from fleas.  Treatment  Treatment for fiddler's neck is unnecessary if it is painless and shows minimal swelling, particularly since minor cases are taken as a mark of pride. But fiddler's neck may lead to worse disorders. The primary methods of treatment involve adjustments to playing of the instrument: * good hygiene for the affected area and for the instrument * use of a clean cotton cloth that is changed frequently *use of a comfortable pad to absorb sweat and reduce friction between the instrument and skin * use of a shoulder rest to reduce pressure below the jaw * a suitable chin rest, especially one carved or molded for the individual * Covering or changing potentially allergenic materials on the instrument. * shifting the chin rest to the center of the body over the tailpiece * smoothing coarse surfaces to reduce abrasion * for males, growing a beard to avoid folliculitis Surgery is necessary for sialolithiasis, parotid tumors, and cysts. Cervical lymph nodes that are larger than 1 cm must be biopsied. Connective tissue can be removed by excision when a non-inflamed mass is large, and there is generally little recurrence. Infections should be treated conservatively, and causative species should be identified through smear and culture for appropriate antibiotic selection. Reduction of playing time may be helpful for cases without inflammation, but in 30% of cases this did not improve the symptoms. Prevalence Fiddler's neck does not usually form unless the musician is practicing or playing for more than a few hours each day, and only seems to develop after a few years of serious playing. Thus, when not infected or otherwise problematic, fiddler's neck may be known as a benign practice mark and may be worn proudly as an indication of long hours of practice. Blum & Ritter (1990) found that 62% of 523 professional violinists and violists in West Germany experienced fiddler's neck, with the percentage among violists being higher (67%) than among violinists (59%). Viola players are believed to be more predisposed to developing fiddler's neck than violinists because the viola is larger and heavier, but this has not been empirically confirmed. The development of fiddler's neck does not depend on preexisting skin problems, and Blum & Ritter find that only 23% of men and 14% of women in their study reported cutaneous disorders in other parts of the face (mainly acne and eczema) that were independent of playing the violin or viola. Fiddler's neck may exacerbate existing acne, but acne may also be limited solely to the lesion and not appear elsewhere. Nonetheless, musicians with underlying dermatologic diseases like acne and eczema are more endangered by fiddler's neck than others. Males may develop folliculitis or boils due to involvement of beard hair.

The wave period is shorter than the ocean waves but can reach up to periods of 11-12 second swells although the average swell period is 6‚Äì7 seconds. Southern Turkey, the Mediterranean side, is a better surf destination for winter months with its warm blue waters, versatile waves, historical seaside towns and traditional Turkish cuisine with inexpensive accommodation. Winter season is the high season for waves and low season for tourist activity lowering the accommodation prices. Alanya a tourist town located on southern Turkey, produces surprisingly high quality waves for Mediterranean with consistency reaching 20 surf-able days a month in the winter/spring time (December, January, February, March, April). During these months climate in this town is averaging 65 F with water temperatures averaging 65 F to 70 F. Ideal swells for this region accumulates from south, southeast or east-south-east directions with southeast swells producing longer period, higher quality waves. In Alanya; Damlatas beach offers hollow tubing waves where Keykubat beach offers longer mellower waves suitable both for long and short-board surfing. These waves are suitable for both beginners and experts alike. It is possible to find waves in this part of Mediterranean ranging anywhere from two to 12 feet. North of Turkey; Black Sea also offers rideable waves of different range from one to 12 feet. Nowadays you can find a handful of local surfers surfing the region on a regular basis. History With great efforts of Tunc Ucyildiz and Turkish American Sports Club; formal modern surfing history in [Turkey] started with the 1st National Surfing Championship held in Istanbul. Tunc Ucyildiz not only won the first national title but also brought first organized surfing event to Turkey. In 2013, he represented Turkey for the first time in ISA World Surfing Games where national athletes compete. The culture of surfing in Turkey dates back to Ottoman Empire time where locals used to body surf in Black Sea region. This particular body surf activity is called \\"viya\\". This tradition is still in place where many locals are performing \\"viya\\" in Black Sea and Mediterranean region to this day.

Rothken is an American high technology attorney and computer scientist who has handled numerous cases of first impression involving the internet and new technologies. Education and Early Work Rothken is a graduate of Brandeis University with a bachelor's degree in science and Golden Gate University School of Law where he was Editor in Chief of the Intellectual Property Law Review. Rothken, a former medical researcher and computer scientist, began the Northern California-based Rothken Law Firm in 1993 and the firm has evolved from the beginning of the commercial internet in 1995 to emphasize complex high technology related litigation. Career Background According to a July 31, 2007 CNET News.com Article profiling Ira P. Rothken's legal career: * \\"Tech start-ups sued by media conglomerates for copyright infringement typically call on Rothken, a medical researcher turned lawyer. He's made a name for himself by bucking entertainment empires and by backing long-shot copyright cases, such as those involving RecordTV, ReplayTV and MP3Board.com. His efforts have won him praise from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the advocacy group that has become synonymous with user rights on the Web.\\" Rothken has been described as a litigator who is both creative and tough. Internet Gambling Cases One of Rothken's earliest cases alleged that credit card companies were involved in providing illegal gambling loans to users of internet gambling sites. In this case, Rothken pointed out \\"We want the court to say Visa and MasterCard can't make money on illegal transactions....\\" The case resulted in credit card companies settling and providing, amongst other things, a notice to their card holders that their card may not be used to fund online gambling. As a result of the case, Ed Dixon, a spokesman for MasterCard admitted that they introduced new rules related to Internet gambling. Later, Visa affiliates agreed to clear the credit rating of Rothken's client and issue warnings to consumers. Internet Search Engine Cases Several of Rothken's cases have involved defending various search engines. Rothken's reason is simple: \\"We all recognize that the greater good is to allow for robust search...Search is just too important to society. Regardless of the percentage of [illegal] files, even if it's a large percentage of those files that ultimately will lead to downstream content that's unauthorized, search of that content should still be allowed... When you look at the total picture... do we believe that search engines for .torrent files should be banned altogether? Most people would say no.\\" Cases of First Impression Many of Rothken's high technology legal actions have included issues of first impression where original issues of law are presented for decision by the court. In these cases, there is no precedent for the legal issue at hand in a specific court. Often Rothken's cases of first impression involve complex technology issues. Examples of first impression cases include: * Rothken is the lead global defense counsel for Kim Dotcom and his company Megaupload in what has been called the largest criminal copyright case in US history. * Rothken represented consumers as lead counsel in a suit brought on behalf of consumers against Microsoft, Symantec, Adobe, and others; related to their software \\"EULA\\" and shrinkwrap policies, in Baker v. Microsoft et al. These shrink-wrap licenses could not be read by consumers prior to unwrapping the software, at which point major retailers would refuse to allow return of the software. This case resulted in a settlement that led to policy changes, created a more transparent market for software companies to compete on licensing terms, and benefitted consumers nationwide. * Rothken was co-lead class counsel representing owners of Treo 600 and Treo 650 smartphones made by Palm; in a nationwide federal court class action lawsuit consolidated in the Northern District of California titled in re Palm Treo, claiming the devices are inherently defective, resulting in a multimillion-dollar nationwide class recovery. * Rothken was co-lead class counsel representing owners of T-Mobile Sidekick smartphones; in a nationwide federal court class action lawsuit consolidated in the Northern District of California titled in re Sidekick, claiming a massive corruption of data integrity and interruption of consumer data access, resulting in a multimillion-dollar nationwide class recovery. * Rothken was co-lead class counsel and liaison counsel to the Court representing owners of Apple iPhone 4 smartphones, in a suit dubbed as \\"Antenna-gate\\" because of comments made by Steve Jobs. Rothken claimed defective antenna design leading to degraded connectivity and dropped calls, resulting in a class remedy of 15 dollars per iPhone 4 claimant. * Rothken was co-lead settlement class counsel in a nationwide consumer privacy lawsuit brought against DoubleClick, for allegedly intruding on web user privacy; consolidated in the Southern District of New York and titled in re DoubleClick Privacy Litigation, resulting in a nationwide class settlement. * Rothken represented consumers as lead counsel in a suit against a Music CD Recording Company and its Digital Rights Management scheme; in connection to violations of their privacy and first sale doctrine rights, in DeLise v. Sunncomm et al. * Rothken was involved in the first case where a court ordered that defendants had to turn over contents of random access memory. \\"Lawyers will be flinging around preservation letters, coming up with all kinds of creative ways to tell the other to preserve RAM\\", Rothken opined. \\"That would cause huge economic implications. If it's not changed, it can create e-discovery chaos\\". * Rothken was the lead defense counsel in a case of first impression brought by the major motion picture studios against an online interactive services provider; which argued that its Internet centric VCR, created out of software code, is just as lawful as a physical VCR and it should not have to pay any Copyright damages, in MGM et al. v. RecordTV.com, Inc. * Rothken was lead plaintiff's counsel in a lawsuit to enjoin the RIAA's Clean Slate \\"Amnesty\\" program as it allegedly did not provide a full release of copyright claims against consumers who were required, as a condition of entering the program, to make admissions of copyright infringement; which led to a negotiated settlement that benefitted consumers nationwide. * Rothken was also lead defense counsel defending a large search engine in Federal Court against claims by the RIAA for secondary copyright infringement arising out of hyperlinks to mp3 music files; in Arista Records et al. v. MP3Board.com. * Rothken defended bit torrent site isoHunt in a copyright case of first impression, regarding the reach of secondary civil copyright infringement and the DMCA safe harbors. \\"One person's 'worst search engine' is another person's 'robust search engine'\\", said isoHunt's attorney, Rothken. \\"Should we as a society not allow torrent search engines because some groups like the major studios don't like the state of the Internet as it relates to .torrent files?\\" he asked. * Rothken served as lead counsel along with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, defending the rights of consumers including Craig Newmark (founder of Craigslist), under the Copyright fair use doctrine; to use their net-connected ReplayTV devices (digital video recorders) to space-shift and commercial-skip television programs, in Newmark v. Turner Broadcasting et al. * Rothken was a co-lead defense counsel in the trial court and Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Stayart v. Yahoo et al.; which found that the plaintiff did not have a protectable commercial interest in her name under certain sections of the Lanham Act; and thus affirmed the trial court's dismissal of such claims against a major search engine and social networking site. Megaupload One of Rothken's best known cases involves the defense of former cloud storage provider Megaupload and its founder Kim Dotcom. Rothken is the lead global defense counsel for Kim Dotcom and Megaupload in what has been called the largest criminal copyright case in US history. Rothken had represented Megaupload and Kim Dotcom in other matters, such as the case alleging Universal Music did an improper takedown notice of a well known Megaupload video from YouTube in which several pop stars gave a performance praising Megaupload. On January 20, 2012, Megaupload and Kim Dotcom were raided by a force involving dozens of members of the New Zealand elite Special Tactics Group and Armed Offenders Squad under the direction of the FBI. In articles and interviews, Rothken pointed out how this raid has caused millions of innocent users to lose access to their personal files, such as Microsoft Word and Excel files, stored on the Megaupload servers, as this raid destroyed the company in an instant. At the SF MusicTech Summit, Julie Samuels, staff attorney for Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Rothken discussed how the government, after seizing the data, then quickly sent a letter to Carpathia, an ISP that provides server space, strongly encouraging them to delete the data of Megaupload and all the data of their customers that was stored on Megaupload. Samuels and Rothken discussed many aspects of the effects of the government actions on innocent parties such as the server company, and customers who relied on Megaupload, as backup storage, who were suddenly denied all access to their personal files. They discuss how the governments actions in this case were incredibly more aggressive than in other cases involving seizures, such as of online gambling sites where the casinos were still allowed to operate. Because of the unnoticed shutdown that resulted from the Megaupload seizure, \\"lots of protected speech is now offline,\\" said Rothken, adding that the process in this case, where the material was taken offline without any chance to avoid harm to innocent parties, shows exactly why the adversarial process must always be used to give courts a chance to narrowly tailor rulings as to what the government should be allowed to take offline while protecting the interests of innocent users. Samuels pointed out that few defendants have the resources to fight a case of this type against the government, and Rothken mentioned, because of government freezing assets, how most of the 20 lawyers working on this case have received very little, if any, payment for their work. Samuels asserts that in many similar cases the government has finally admitted, as much as 12 to 18 months after taking sites offline, they did not have sufficient evidence to support the shutdowns. When the operation was over, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a press release: \\"This action is among the largest criminal copyright cases ever brought by the United States and directly targets the misuse of a public content storage and distribution site to commit and facilitate intellectual property crime.\\" Rothken undertook the representation of Megaupload and Kim Dotcom on the day of the raid and assembled and coordinated the global legal team. Rothken made a number of appearances in the United States Court in the Eastern District of Virginia in an effort, along with EFF, to negotiate the preservation and return of user files, and while the Court initially entertained such arguments and ordered briefing, the Judge has yet to rule. In addition Rothken and his co-counsel, William Burck from Quinn Emmanuel, filed motions to dismiss Megaupload from the case due to failure of the United States to serve the foreign corporate entity. Rothken and his team cited the rule that required the US to serve a foreign corporation at an office in the United States. Megaupload Ltd., a Hong Kong Corporation, did not have a corporate office in the United States and therefore could never be served. The Judge has yet to make a final ruling on the motion to dismiss, leaving Megaupload in a state of limbo where all of its assets were frozen by the US and it is both not dismissed and not served. Rothken had a succinct description of the US government case against Megaupload and Kim Dotcom: \\"wrong on the facts and wrong on the law.\\" In Rothken's words, the government is acting over- aggressively and overbroadly by taking down one of the world's largest cloud storage services \\"without any notice or chance for Megaupload to be heard in a court of law.\\" The result ignores substantial non infringing uses of cloud storage and is both \\"offensive to the rights of Megaupload and to the rights of millions of consumers worldwide\\" who stored personal data with the service. In Rothken's view, attempting to hold a cloud storage provider criminally responsible for the acts of its users is known as \\"secondary\\" criminal copyright liability and there is no such statutory claim under US Law. Secondary copyright liability is judge made law in \\"civil\\" cases, such as Grokster, and such theories are not \\"criminal\\" in nature. Instead, the government's willingness to pursue the case as an international racketeering charge meant \\"essentially only sticking up for one side of the copyright vs. technology debate.\\" The result, Rothken says, is \\"terrible chilling effect it's having on Internet innovators\\" who feature cloud storage components to their business. Rothken was unhappy about the police raid on Kim Dotcom's family: * \\"Using \\"James Bond tactics with helicopters and weaponry, and breaking into homes over what is apparently a philosophical debate over the balance between copyright protection and the freedom to innovate, are heavy- handed tactics, are over-aggressive, and have a detrimental effect on society as a whole,\\" Rothken said. In addition, the raid was a reminder that bills like the Stop Online Piracy Act \\"ought not to ever be passed, because these tactics [the helicopters, etc.] are so offensive that if you take the shackles off of government, it may lead to more abuse, more aggression.\\" Rothken also suggested that the timing of the raid was suspicious; \\"over a two-year period, they happened to pick the one week where SOPA started going south.\\" Rothken and his global legal team were able to show that the U.S. government recruited the New Zealand authorities to engage in various illegal activities in New Zealand. Although some of the facts are still being uncovered, it is undisputed that the New Zealand authorities illegally spied on Kim Dotcom prior to his arrest, and continued to spy on him illegally for an additional time after the arrest. Issues were raised with how broadly the original search warrant was written. According to Rothken the warrant was very broad, and could have included family photos. It provided little guidance on what to actually gather, leading the court to determine the search warrant was overly broad. The U.S. then quickly removed the seized information from New Zealand, even before the court could make this ruling. \\"They just went and grabbed everything. It's like, literally going into someone's home with a search warrant and just clearing the whole place out, which happened.\\" said Auckland defense lawyer Gary Gotlieb. The Court found that the raid on Dotcom's home in Coatesville was illegal based on invalid search warrants and that the police illegally seized Kim Dotcom's computer systems and data. The Court also found that the United States violated the law when they removed Dotcom's data from New Zealand without authorization. While the ultimate repercussions of those illegal activities are still unclear, Rothken has written that they lend no credibility to the U.S. prosecution's case against Megaupload and Kim Dotcom. In an interview with Larry Williams, Rothken made the point \\"how the government conducts themselves in trying to prosecute someone matters.\\" Because of all the problems already found by the courts, Rothken called for a global dismissal of the case. Rothken laid out a \\"constellation of facts\\" that supports his conclusion that this case is related to SOPA failing in the U.S. Congress, and \\"this appears to be some sort of a political solution to gain the support of Hollywood\\". When asked why his client doesn't simply come to the U.S. and answer the charges, Rothken additionally claimed these are the very factors that would deny his client a fair trial in the United States. Rothken, declined to say whether his legal team has uncovered the full details of the illegal spying. He did tell the Huffington Post in a March 2013 interview his views about the nature of illegal US spying on the internet and that they are trying to learn more: * \\"Based upon the public record and cases in the United States, and an understanding about how Echelon works, which is this global spying arrangement between United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain, we came to the preliminary view that in essence New Zealand was working with the United States to basically grab everything,\\" he said. \\"Not just against Kim Dotcom, but basically grabbing all email in relative real time and storing it so that one day if they need to they could datamine it.\\" * \\"As part of our request to the [NZ] court,\\" Rothken said, \\"we asked for discovery that was tailored not only to protecting Kim Dotcom's rights but the rights of all residents of New Zealand, and we've asked for the full scope of all the data they've obtained.\\" E-Discovery Work Rothken has been involved in handling cutting edge issues in electronic discovery in a legal think tank. Rothken as a member of the cutting edge Sedona Conference¬Æ Working Group 1, co-edited a leading Commentary on the issues of preserving, managing, and identifying not reasonably accessible electronically stored information or \\"NRA ESI\\". The result is a five-step framework for analysis and six Guidelines for making reasonable, good-faith assessments where no \\"bright line\\" rules exist. Rothken's activities with the Sedona Conference included speaking at Conferences and Seminars on e-discovery issues. Rothken worked with Judges and technology lawyers to evolve how e-discovery issues are handled in Courts nationwide. E-Commerce & Interactive Entertainment Rothken has been involved in advising on e-commerce legal strategies since the inception of the commercial internet in the mid-1990s. Rothken has represented some of the most successful web sites in the world on a huge range of matters from startup issues to risk reduction strategies to development of early affiliate programs to e-commerce policies and agreements. In many instances he was called upon to handle issues where there was no clear precedent and thus had to innovate a solution. Examples of technology companies Rothken has helped in the startup phase include FriendFinder (Social Networking), Pandemic Studios (which he negotiated the spin off from Activision and started the company), ArenaNet (The makers of Guild Wars in which he helped obtain the seed funding and started the company along with persons formally with Blizzard), Nihilistic (in which he negotiated multiple game development deals and started the company with former LucasArts employees), and Telltale (in which he started the company with former LucasArts employees, negotiated numerous development deals, and helped obtain seed funding). Rothken assisted developers and content creators in negotiating agreements with some of the most valuable intellectual property franchises in the world including for example, Star Wars, The Simpsons, and CSI. Rothken assisted in the negotiations of the sale of the FriendFinder family of websites to a Penthouse controlled entity for a half billion dollars in 2007. Rothken was involved in the global roll out of cloud storage provider Mega and was introduced on stage by Kim Dotcom in the January 20th 2013 New Zealand press conference where he answered questions regarding the service. Rothken has appeared as a guest legal expert on television and radio including CNN (internet privacy), KQED radio (computer keyboard injuries), FOX (internet gambling), NBC (internet copyright), CBS (internet privacy), CNET radio (internet copyright), KTVU Silicon Valley Business Report (software license agreements), Bloomberg (copyright Litigation), and Court TV (internet gambling issues and copyright litigation).

He was also known by his nickname Tarzan. In 1948, he became European boxing champion in the middleweight class. Cyrille Delannoit. boxrec.com Boxing career Delannoit came from a working-class family with 12 children from a working- class neighborhood. Of the 7 sons, three were boxers. Cyriel, known for his powerful punch was certainly the most famous of the brothers and Belgian champion in 1947. On 23 May 1948, he defeated reigning European champion middleweight Marcel Cerdan in a fight in Heysel Stadium in Brussels in front of 20,000 spectators. The victory by a decision in 15 rounds was all the more remarkable because it was the first defeat of Cerdan in 105 boxing fights. Cerdan however won the rematch on 10 July 1948 less than two months later again by a decision. Cyriel Delannoit continued his achievements by recapturing the title again in November 1948 after a win on points against Dutch boxer Luc van Dam. In 1949 he lost back the title to the Italian boxer Tiberio Mitri. On 1 July 1951, he lost a crucial game to world champion Sugar Ray Robinson in 3rd round. Delannoit's shining days had finished despite further matches. In 1951, he appeared briefly in the film Ah! Qu'il fait bon chez nous acting as himself. Delannoit left his residence in Geraardsbergen to live in Brussels, living there for more than 20 years. At the end of the 1970s he returned to his hometown, completely destitute, and in need of social welfare for him and his family. He died in poverty in 1998 after a long illness. Legacy The life story of Cyriel Delannoit has been a source of inspiration for various scripts and films. Fernand Handtpoorter wrote the story of Delannoit for a documentary about him. The Belgian television series Koning van de Wereld (meaning King of the world) was partly based on the life story of the boxer. In 2005 he was nominated for The Greatest Belgian but finishing at 321 in the final listing.

The revolt lacked organization or military resources and was swiftly suppressed by the Bulgarian Army with massive reprisals. The revolt had guidance from the Macedonian politburo of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). Background The Bulgarian Army entered Greece on 20 April 1941, at the heels of the Wehrmacht's invasion of Greece, and eventually occupied the whole of northeastern Greece east of the Strymon River (eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace), except for the Evros prefecture, at the border with Turkey, which was occupied by the Germans. Unlike Germany and Italy in their respective occupation zones, Bulgaria officially annexed the occupied territories, which had long been a target of Bulgarian irredentism, on 14 May 1941.Mazower (2000), p. 276 A massive campaign of Bulgarisation was launched, which saw all Greek officials (mayors, school-teachers, judges, lawyers, priests, gendarmes) deported. A ban was placed on the use of the Greek language, and the names of towns and places changed to the forms traditional in Bulgarian. In addition, the Bulgarian government tried to alter the ethnic composition of the region, by expropriating land and houses from Greeks in favour of Bulgarian settlers, and by the introduction of forced labour and of economic restrictions for the Greeks in an effort to force them to migrate. Uprising In this situation, a revolt broke out on 28 September 1941 under the guidance of the Macedonian politburo of the Communist Party of Greece.Œó ŒùŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÜœåœÅŒ± ŒïœÄŒ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒ∑ œÄŒøœÖ œáŒ¨Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œµ ŒßŒ±œÑŒ∂ŒÆœÇ, ŒòŒ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒ∑œÇ, ŒïŒ∫Œ¥œåœÉŒµŒπœÇ ŒîœâœÅŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, ŒàœÑŒøœÇ ŒàŒ∫Œ¥ŒøœÉŒ∑œÇ: 1983, œÑœåŒºŒøœÇ ŒëŒÑ œÉŒµŒª 168 The uprising initially broke out in Doxato, where local Greeks attacked the police station and killed six or seven Bulgarian policemen.

Reprisals Bulgarian soldiers proudly displaying their beheaded victims The uprising was brutally suppressed by the Bulgarian occupation authorities. The following day, 29 September, all leaders were either killed in battle or in their attempt to escape to the German occupation zone. However, Bulgarian retaliations were not limited to the rebels. Bulgarian troops moved into Drama and the other rebellious cities to suppress the uprising and seized all men between 18 and 45.

The massacres precipitated an exodus of Greeks from the Bulgarian into the German occupation zone in Central Macedonia. Bulgarian reprisals continued after the suppression of the uprising, adding to the torrent of refugees. Villages were destroyed for sheltering ‚Äúpartisans‚Äù who were in fact only the survivors of villages previously destroyed. The terror and famine became so severe that the Athens government considered plans for evacuating the entire population to German-occupied Greece.Miller (1975), p. 128.

Date of the Expositio It has been argued that the Expositio's date cannot now be definitely given, but that it is closer to the 12th century than the 9th century. It has also been said that \\"Berengaudus\\" was a contemporary of Anselm of Laon; and that he was somewhat earlier, c. 1040. But Visser argues from familiarity with the commentary of Haimo of Auxerre, and internal evidence of an acrostic, that the traditional identification is valid.

In power stations, it is usually used to analyze boiler steam and water to ensure the water used to generate electricity is clean from impurities which can cause corrosion to any metallic surface, such as in boiler and turbine.steam_nopw.pdf Steam and water analysis system (SWAS) Corrosion and erosion are major concerns in thermal power plants operating on steam. The steam reaching the turbines need to be ultra-pure and hence needs to be monitored for its quality. A well designed Steam and Water Analysis system (SWAS) can help in monitoring the critical parameters in the steam. These parameters include pH, conductivity, silica, sodium, dissolved oxygen, phosphate and chlorides. A well designed SWAS must ensure that the sample is representative till the point of analysis. To achieve this, it is important to take care of the following aspects of the sample: # Sample Extraction # Sample Transport # Conditioning # Analysis # Controls These aspects are well explained in international standards like ASME PTC 19.11-2008 and VGB S006 -00 2012_09_EN. The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) also gives good information on important measurement points and its significance. Sample handling system components are the most important pressure parts of sample handling system and need to have certification from ASME Section VIII Div1 & Div2 or PED. Also many times country-specific certifications required like * American: ASME Section VIII Div 1 and Div 2 *India: Indian Boiler Regulation (IBR) form IIIC * Malaysia: DOSH * Russia: GOST-R  Sample extraction  To ensure that the sample that is going to be extracted for analysis represents the process conditions exactly, it is important to choose the correct sample extraction probe. The validity of the analysis is largely dependent on the sample being truly representative. As the probe is going to be directly attached to the process pipe work, it may have to withstand severe conditions. For most applications, the sample probe is manufactured to the stringent codes applicable to high-pressure, high- temperature pipework. The selection of the right type of probe is a challenge. Its use depends on the process stream parameter to be measured, the required sample flow rate and the location of the sampling point (which is also called the 'tapping point'). An important aspect of the sample extraction probe design is that the steam must enter the probe at the same velocity as the steam flowing in the pipeline from where the sample (it can be steam or water) was extracted. These probes are designed as per ASTM D1066 standard for steam extraction and must be designed and tested for their structural integrity in High pressure, High Temperature and Higher velocity of samples. Sample extraction probes are extremely important and necessary of proper analysis of suspended impurities like Corrosion products, Total Iron, copper, carryover effects.  Sample transport  Section#4 in ASME PTC 19.11-2008 standard describes details for designing of sample transportation lines. Following care need to take while designing of this sample transportation lines: (1) Line Size Selection: Following aspects are very important while designing of sample Transportation lines. (a) Transportation time i.e. (Velocity) of sample from Isokinetic sample extraction probes to sampling system should be as minimum. SWAS room must be located close to low pressure water (condensate) samples from CEP discharge and condensate Polishing plants with lesser velocities. (b) Pressure drops in lines is an important aspect. It is very important that the sample meets least resistance. Hence joints and bends in the pipeline need to be minimal. Also, sample lines must be continuously sloping to avoid accumulation of samples in lines. (2) Line Material: Minimum Stainless steel SS316 Grade material must be used for sample Transport Lines. This is to avoid corrosion of lines which leads to wrong measurement and analysis. For High pressure and Temperature samples (Super heated steam, Reheated Steam, Saturated Steam, Separator drains, Feed water at Economizer inlets) SS316H must be used which withstand High Temperature of samples.  Sample conditioning system  Sample conditioning system in some countries is also called sampling system, Wet Panel or Wet Rack. This is intended to house various components for sample conditioning. This may be an open rack or a closed enclosure with a corridor in between. The system contains sample conditioning equipment and a grab sampling sink. In this system stage, sample is first cooled in Sample Coolers, depressurized in Pressure Regulator and then fed to various analyzers while the flow characteristics is kept constant by means of Back Pressure Regulator. The need to condition the sample exists, because the sensors used for online analysis are not able to handle the water/steam sample at high temperatures or pressures. To maintain a common reference of analysis, the sample analysis should be done at 25 ¬∞C. However, due to temperature compensation logic being available in most of the analyzers today, it is a practice to cool the sample to 25‚Äì40 ¬∞C. with the help of a well engineered sample conditioning system and then feed the conditioned sample to the analyzers. However, if an uncompensated sample is to be analyzed, it becomes essential to cool the sample to 25 ¬∞C +/- 1 ¬∞C. This can be achieved by two-stage cooling. In the first stage cooling (also known as 'primary cooling'), the sample is cooled by using available cooling water. In most of the countries, cooling water is available in the range of 30‚Äì32 ¬∞C. This cooling water can cool the sample unto 35 ¬∞C(considering an approach temperature of 3 to 5 ¬∞C). A sample cooler is used to achieve this. Sample cooler is a heat exchanger specially designed for SWAS applications. Preferred sample cooler for primary cooling is a double helix coil in shell type design providing contraflow heat exchange. The remaining part of cooling (i.e. from 35 to 25 ¬∞C) is achieved by using chilled water in the secondary cooling circuit. A chilled water supply is required from the plant or else an independent chiller package can be considered for this purpose along with SWAS. The sampling system can be an 'open-frame free standing' type design or a fully or partially closed design, depending on the choice of the user, the environment it is supposed to operate in & the criticality of operation.  Sample coolers  In the sampling system, sample coolers play a major role in bringing down the temperature of hot steam (or water) to a temperature acceptable to the sensors of the on-line analyser. Some of the important design aspects of sample coolers are: # Preferably a sample cooler design should be double helix, coil in shell type, so designed as to provide contra- flow heat exchange. This makes the sample cooler more compact, yet highly effective in terms of heat exchange. # Sample coils made of stainless steel SS-316 are suitable for normal cooling water conditions. However, if the chloride content in the cooling water is high (more than 35 ppm), then other suitable coil materials such as Monel or Inconnel need to be used depending upon the quality of cooling water. # A ‚Äúbuilt-in‚Äù safety relief valve on shell side of the cooler is a must, so as to prevent explosion of the shell in event of sample coil failure. # The sample cooler design must be meeting ASME PTC 19.11 standard requirements.  Pressure reducers  After the sample is cooled, the pressure of the sample must be reduced to meet the requirement of the sensors that receive this sample. Usually, the sensors like pH, conductivity, silica, sodium, and hydrazine require low pressure sample for healthy operation. A rod-in-tube type of pressure reducer is the most effective method of pressure reduction recommended in ASME PTC19.11-2008 standard. As per the latest technology, a Sample rod-in-tube pressure reducer with thermal and safety relief valveRod in Tube Pressure Reducers as per ASME PTC 19.11-2008 standard device is considered to be the most reliable and safe device. Single Rod in Tube System is a system in itself that takes care of some important aspects of sample conditioning. The pressure reducer in the Sampling system is rated for high very high pressure 450 Bar. There is no need of filters before the Rod in tube Pressure Reducers, as cleaning is on-line, without using any tools. For maintenance, no-shut-down is required for cleaning these pressure reducer.  Safety of analyzers against high temperature  Analyzers must be protected from high temperature samples. This is to avoid situations in case of failure of cooling water to primary sample coolers. There are various methods for stopping sample to analyzer in such a situation. The most popular and simple method is use of mechanical thermal shut off valves. These valves close and block samples to analyzer in case of cooling water failures. These valves must be with: (1) High pressure rating and designed inline with ASME standards to assure safety of operator and instruments downstream. (2) This valves must be with MANUAL RESET design as recommended in ASME PTC 19.11-2008 standards. (3) These valves must be equipped with potential free alarm contact for operator indication in Control system.  Sample analysis system  A sample analysis system in some countries is also called Analyser Panel, Dry Panel or Dry Rack. It is usually a free-standing enclosed panel. The system contains the transmitter electronics, usually it is mounted on panels. In this system stage, sample is analyzed on its pH, conductivity, silica, phosphate, chloride, dissolved oxygen, hydrazine, sodium etc.  Types of conductivity measurement  Three types of conductivity measurement are usually done: # Specific conductivity, # Cation conductivity and # De-gassed cation conductivity. There is a difference between these three types of measurements. # Specific conductivity gives overall conductivity value of the sample and is the most generic measurement # Cation conductivity is conductivity measurement after the Cation Column. At the Cation Column, the H+ resins replace the positive ions of all dissolved matter in the solution. When this happens, the treatment chemicals, which are desired ones (and are of basic or alkaline in nature) get converted to H2O, i.e. water. (e.g. NH4OH + H(+) gives NH4+ and H2O). The impurities are nothing but salts of different natures These get converted to respective acids (e.g. NaCl + H(+) gives HCl and CL-). Thus masking effects of treatment chemicals on the conductivity value are eliminated, while the conversion of salts to corresponding acids has an effect of increase in their corresponding conductivity value to around 3 times its original value. Thus, in effect, cation conductivity acts as amplifier of conductivity due to impurities and eliminator of conductivity due to treatment chemicals. # De-gassed conductivity is the finest level of conductivity measurement. Here one removes the masking effects of dissolved gases, mainly CO2, on the conductivity measurement. In the De-Gassed conductivity system, there is a reboil chamber to heat the sample, so that the dissolved gases are liberated and then there is cooling mechanism, by which the hot liquid is cooled again. The conductivity measured after this process is indeed the 'real' value of conductivity because of 'dissolved' impurities after eliminating the dissolved gases. Degas columns are designed inline with ASTM D4519 Standard. These measurements are also recommended in standards like ASME PTC 19.11-2008 and VGB S006 -00 2012_09_EN. You can also refer IAPWS guidelines for more information. #These Three conductivity measurement are very important and also used to Calculate pH and Dissolved CO2 values in Steam and Water Cycles.  Silica problem  When it comes to safety and efficiency of the steam turbine and boiler in a power plant, silica becomes one of the most critical factors to be monitored. Deposition of various impurities on turbine blades has been identified as one of the most common problems. Various compounds deposit on the turbine blades. Of all these compounds, silica (SiO2) deposits can occur at lower operating pressures also. Therefore, silica deposition is quite common in turbines than other types of deposits. Silica usually deposits in the intermediate-pressure and low-pressure sections of the turbine. These deposits are hard to remove, disturb the geometry of turbine blades and ultimately result in vibrations causing imbalance and loss of output from turbine. Another important area of concern as far as silica deposition is concerned is boiler tube. Silica scale is one of the hardest scale to remove. Because of its low thermal conductivity, a very thin silica deposit can reduce heat transfer considerably, reducing efficiency, leading to hot spots and ultimately ruptures. Because of all these issues, it is extremely important to closely monitor silica levels by using on-line silica analyzers that can measure silica levels to a ppb (parts per billion) level.

After suffering war damage, the building was restored with two gables in the Neobaroque style in 1958, re-establishing the square's sequence of gabled buildings dating from the 1820s.  History  There has been a Raths-Apotheke in Bremen since 1510. The exact location of the original building is not known but it was probably situated in S√∂gestrasse. It is first mentioned in a document from 1 October 1532 in which the city requires the pharmacist to sell his wares at fair prices. The pharmacist received his income from the city council. From the 17th century, the council leased the pharmacy for 10 years at a time, later for life. The supervision was ensured by the third mayor and by a councillor. From 1594 to 1820, two beautiful three-storey gabled buildings in the Weser Renaissance style stood of the site of today's Raths-Apotheke. Differing in height and width, they had been designed by L√ºder von Bentheim, one with two bays, the other with three. They housed the apothecary and the excise office. The apothecary itself had a tall triangular gable with pyramids on either side. In the 17th century, additional pharmacies were established in Bremen: the \\"Einhorn-Apotheke\\" in 1640, and the \\"Hirsch-Apotheke\\" and the \\"Apotheke zur wei√üen Rose\\" in 1667. In August 1815, the city council sold the Raths- Apotheke property to Jacob Henschen, the licensee. In 1824, Henschen demolished the buildings which had fallen into disrepair. Around 1830, a new plain three-storey building was erected in the Neoclassical style practised by Biedermeier. Standing in the northwest corner of the Marktplatz, the rendered building looked strange and out of character. In 1893, it was seriously damaged by a fire but the owner, Friedrich Hauck, could not afford to have it repaired. A lively public discussion took place, involving the B√ºrgerschaft of Bremen (city parliament). It became generally accepted that as the market place was close to the hearts of the citizens, its appearance had to be maintained. As a result, the cathedral architect, Max Salzman, submitted plans for a new fa√ßade. Built of yellow Silesian marble, the German Renaissance building was completed in 1894. Its central gable and the oriels on the first and second floors drew out its vertical lines. To cover the additional costs of a building designed to enhance the cityscape, the owner received a subsidy of 15,000 marks from the city and a donation of 10,000 marks from Franz Sch√ºtte who had been successful in the oil-import business. On 6 October 1944, the interior of the building was destroyed by incendiary bombs but the ground floor and the fa√ßade with the oriels were left intact. After the war, the lower two storeys of the building were repaired but it was only in 1958 that restoration was completed. Planned by Herbert Anker, instead of a single central gable, there were now two Neobaroque gables. The work re-established the ensemble of gabled buildings on the Marktplatz from 1830. As the oriels on the first and second floor had originally been designed as features of a single gable, their removal was contemplated but rejected. The roof cover of the oriel which had originally been cupola-shaped was replaced by a sloping copper-covered roof. There is a sundial on the right gable, one of Bremen's 125 sundials. The left entrance provides access to a medical centre while the Raths-Apotheke occupies the right half of the building.  Heritage listings  In 1973, the Raths-Apotheke was listed under the Monument Act. The ensemble on the north-western side of the Marktplatz consists of the following four buildings (from right to left): *Am Markt 1: Rathscaf√©/Deutsches Haus, 1908‚Äì1911 *Am Markt 9: Haus Zum Jonas, built 1600, rebuilt 1963 *Am Markt 11: Raths-Apotheke, built 1893‚Äì1894, rebuilt 1959‚Äì1960 *Am Markt 12: Sparkasse am Markt, 1755, reconstructed 1958  Literature   References   External links  *Raths-Apotheke Buildings and structures in Bremen (city) ","title":"Raths-Apotheke (Bremen)"},{"id":"41196845","text":"Netechma luteopoecila is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

Plot Sisters Asnah and Kumala are polar opposites: Asnah is rude and rough, whereas Kumala is polite and refined. When she is disappointed that the boy of her dreams, Safi'i, is more interested in her sister, Asnah decides to go to Batavia (now Jakarta) to become a singer. Though she becomes rich, Asnah refuses to share her money with her family. The sisters' mother falls ill, and because Asnah has not given the family any of her earnings, Kumala must borrow from a loan shark named Karim; unknown to Kumala, Karim has married Asnah. The treatment paid for by this loan is unsuccessful and her mother dies. All of the family's possessions are repossessed to pay back the debt. Kumala complains to Safi'i, who has been working to remove known loan sharks from the area, and he responds by orchestrating an attack against the loan shark, who has since divorced Asnah. After the loan shark is removed, Kumala and Safi'i can live happily ever after. Production Lintah Darat, produced by Jo Eng Sek for Star Film, was directed by Wu Tsun. The black-and-white film featured cinematography by Chok Chin Hsien. It starred Elly Joenara, Satijem, M. Arief, Aboebakar Djoenaedi, and S Waldy. Joenara had already starred in several films for Star, including Tjioeng Wanara. Legacy A test screening of Lintah Darat, which was targeted at audiences over the age of 17, was held in Batavia on 28 August 1941; this test screening received full audiences and a positive review from De Indische Courant. A review from Surabaya for the Soerabaijasch Handelsblad found the film interesting and easy to follow, particularly praising the condemnation of usury. By the end of September 1941 the film was being shown in Medan. Advertisements for Lintah Darat date as late as December 1948 in the Indies and November 1949 in Singapore, where it was advertised as \\"one of the greatest Malay films\\". The film is now likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

Appearing on as the fourth song on the album's track listing, \\"Sexy Lady\\" was written by Jessie and long-term collaborator Claude Kelly. American record producer Joshua \\"Ammo\\" Coleman wrote and produced the music for the song, whilst additional production came from O.C. and Kevin Figs; Jessie's vocals on the song were produced by Kelly. Though never officially released as a single, following its use in advertisements for No. 7 by Boots, the song charted on the UK Singles Chart at number twenty-two off the back of digital downloads of the album track. Music critics compared the song heavily to previous hits, particularly \\"Domino\\", and were divided over whether it was cheap copy of previous songs or not; however, most critics called the song empowering.  Promotion  Jessie J performed the song on episode 7 of the sixteenth series of wish-granting television show Surprise Surprise. The song was also used as the theme for TV adverts by Boots, for its advertising campaign promoting its No. 7 cosmetics range.  Critical reception  \\"Sexy Lady\\" was met with a mixed critical reception; critics were divided, both positively and negatively comparing it heavily to previous hit single \\"Domino\\" (2011) whilst others called the song empowering. In her review of the album for Allmusic, Heather Phares compared the song to Jessie's previous 2011 hit single \\"Domino\\", which she also compared to songs akin to P!nk and Natasha Bedingfield. Digital Spy's Lewis Corner, also compared the two songs, but concluded that \\"Sexy Lady\\" was a \\"tired knockoff of 'Domino'.\\" Phil Mongredien from The Observer, said that \\"Sexy Lady\\" (along with \\"Excuse My Rude\\") was \\"perfectly palatable\\" but not as arresting as \\"Price Tag\\" or \\"Do It Like a Dude\\".

For six years in a row, the California Grand Casino was voted Best Casino in the San Francisco East Bay by the Bay Area News Group, which includes the Contra Costa Times, San Jose Mercury News and Oakland Tribune. History The casino started in 1854 when the Woodford Hotel and Saloon opened its doors on what is now Pacheco Boulevard and offered alcohol, women and gambling. The hotel became a stagecoach and Wells Fargo Pony Express Stop in 1860. The original building bears a historical marker from the Pony Express Trail Association. In 1979, Lamar \\"Wil\\" Wilkinson, a poker player who has made 7 final tables at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, purchased the casino. He changed the name to the California Grand Casino, and in 2009 moved the casino into a new building. Games The California Grand Casino offers Texas hold 'em poker games, Omaha poker, and a weekly Hold Em tournament. The poker games all feature three blinds, meaning that the player on the button also posts a blind bet. This leads to more players seeing the flop and more action in the games. The Casino has a number of poker jackpots and prizes with more than $23 million in jackpots paid to players. The California Grand Casino also has Hot Action Blackjack, Baccarat, Three Card Poker, and Pai Gow Poker games. In California, the casino does not bank the games, so these games are played with a rotating dealer position so every player has the chance to play the dealer hand and wager against the other players, but the casino dealer still does the actual dealing and settling of all wagers.

Plot  The evil King Zagro (Livio Lorenzon) asks the king of a neighboring country (King Alteo) for permission to wed his daughter, the beautiful Princess Sira (Wandisa Guida), a political union that will join their two countries together. The mighty warrior Ursus, who fought for years in the army of King Alteo, has retired from the military to run a farm in the countryside with his little brother Dario. Ursus had once asked Alteo for the hand of the princess himself, but the king turned him down because Ursus was not of noble birth. After Princess Sira travels to Zagro's kingdom to be wed, she learns that Zagro plans to assassinate her father after the wedding and then dispose of her at a later time, leaving Zagro in complete control of both countries. Zagro has a spy in Alteo's kingdom, the king's foppish advisor Licurgo, whom he uses to influence Alteo's decisions. Ursus learns of the plot and wants to warn Alteo of the danger he is in, but Zagro captures Ursus' brother and threatens to kill the boy if Ursus does not surrender. Ursus turns himself in, and is forced to become a slave in Zagro's prison camp. When some rebels in Zagro's court free the boy from his captivity, Ursus is able to escape from the slave camp without fear of endangering his brother's life, and the two head back to King Alteo's kingdom, to warn him that he is about to be assassinated. Licurgo uses his influence to make Alteo doubt Ursus' warning however, telling him that Ursus is lying about Zagro because he wants to marry the princess himself. Soon after, Licurgo arranges for an assassin to murder the king, and is able to frame Ursus for the assassination. To prove his innocence, Ursus undergoes several tests of strength in an arena, the greatest of which involves being tied to an elephant which then drags Ursus closer and closer to a wooden wall bristling with razor-sharp knives. Ursus uses his great strength to resist the mammoth creature, and succeeds in convincing the people that Zagro was behind the assassination of their king. Enraged, Zagro stabs his confederate Licurgo to death. In desperation, Zagro orders his armies to attack, and a tremendous battle ensues. During the chaos, Ursus stabs Zagro to death with his own sword, and liberates the people, as well as Princess Sira. Sira takes over the throne, and asks Ursus to rule at her side, and the populace celebrates their newfound freedom.

Design and development The Sparviero design, begun in 1937, was intended as an aerobatic competition glider comparable with the 1936 DFS Habicht. It was a mid wing cantilever monoplane with gull wings and straight tapered, rounded tipped plan. The inner panels extended over less than one third span and were mounted with about 10¬∞ of dihedral; there was no dihedral outboard but the trailing edges of these outer panels was completely occupied with ailerons. There were no flaps or spoilers. Its fuselage was ovoid in cross-section and plywood skinned, tapering markedly towards the tail. At the time of the first flight in April 1938 the Sparviero's cockpit was covered with a multi-framed canopy which extended from well behind the nose to the wing leading edge, blending smoothly into both upper nose and rear fuselage lines but limiting the pilot's forward view. By August 1938 the canopy glazing had been extended forward to form the nose profile and enhance the view. The horizontal tail, like the wing was straight tapered and round tipped. The tailplane was mounted over the fuselage on a short pedestal and strut braced from below. Its elevators were both mass and aerodynamically balanced and had a cut-out between them for rudder movement. There was no fin but the aerodynamically balanced rudder was broad and roughly D-shaped, extending down to the keel. The Sparviero landed on a skid which extended from the nose to under mid-chord, aided by a shallow tail bumper. The Sparviero first flew on 13 April 1938, flown by Adriano Mantelli from an airfield near Bologna. The following month Mantelli flew it from Bolongna to Rome where on the 15 May, during a visit from Adolf Hitler it gave a well received aerobatic demonstration. Shortly after that, Mantelli and the Sparviero were in Bern, flying in a competition held during the International Study Commission for Gliding's International Congress. Hanna Reitsch was also there and for a while the two pilots exchanged aircraft. In August it was flown, as part of the Pavullo team, by Captain Laurin in the Second Asiago National Gliding Competition. Only one Sarviero was built.

The passage in the plot Lucia and Renzo are escaping from their native village by barge because don Rodrigo wants to force the young woman to marry him; Lucia sees the place where she used to live and the suitor's castle, so she grieves and begins to cry. Manzoni reports Lucia's reflections and feelings. Short analysis This passage is the most lyrical of the entire novel: critics describe it as a poem in prose; in effect we can find some verses (decasyllables and hendecasyllables) hidden in the text. The register is high-level. The tone is idyllic, but don Rodrigo's presence in some measure darkens and fills with gloom the situation: because of him Lucia begins to cry and to reflect. This passage's purpose is to show character's and writer's feelings, so it is similar to the chorus in Manzoni's tragedies. In his novel the author always wants to control the narration, so he ends the idyllic pause very sharply and restarts narrating. The theme of emigration is very important, but it is not the only one: the passage is also about religion and divine providence, that is The Betrothed's fil rouge (the author writes that God disturbs his sons' joy to donate them, at the end, a bigger joy).

The type of the self-complementary antenna is not limited only to the case of a planar antenna with two terminals, but there are more general types with various grades of complexity, such as, the number of terminals, the number of reference planes, and others. Moreover, there is infinite freedom in their shapes of the structures.http://www.sm.rim.or.jp/~ymushiak/sub.sca.htm They also have constant-impedance property independent of the source frequency and the shape of the structure for respective classes of structures with various grades of complexity. This general principle of self-complementarity is also called the \\"Mushiake Principle\\" by various sources.Ranjan Singh, et al; Spiral-type terahertz antennas and the manifestation of the Mushiake principle, OSA Publishing, Optics Express, Volume 17, Issue 12, Page 9971-9980, (2009)https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-17-12-9971, Examples for two shapes of the structures are shown in the attached figures.

The values of the constant-impedance for various classes of complexity in the self-complementary structures depend on the respective grades of the complexity. For example, the Mushiake relationship for the simplest self-complementary planar antenna with two terminals is expressed as: Z = Z0/2‚âí188.4 [Œ©], (Mushiake relationship) where Z is the input impedance of the antenna, and Z0 is the intrinsic impedance of the medium. Moreover, experimental studies on self-complementary antennas, including radiation properties, are conducted in Japan. As the results of the experiment, it is found that the truncated alternate-leaves type self- complementary antenna (or Square SCA) has practically omnidirectional radiation patternhttp://www.sm.rim.or.jp/~ymushiak/sub.omni.square.htm as well as the broadband property.  Comparison with log-periodic antennas  The log-periodic antenna is a modified, folded up, square self-complementary antenna with log-periodic shape, and the original structure before its modification has a typical self-complementary shape. The log-periodic shape does not provide the broadband property for antennas.Y. Mushiake, ‚ÄúConstant- impedance antennas,\\" J.

The log-periodic structure failed to provide constant-impedance property for antennas over one period. However, one certain way to eliminate such variation is to make the shape self-complementary,V. H. Rumsey, Frequency independent antennas, Academic Press, New York and London. 1966. [pp. 27, 29, 30, 55] and the expression for the constant impedance is called ‚ÄúMushiake‚Äôs relation‚Äù by V. H.

It is located in fare Zone A. The station was inaugurated on 17 October 1919, and was opened to the public on 31 October 1919. The station is the deepest in the Madrid Metro system, with its Line 6 platforms located below street level. However, in terms of absolute elevation above sea level, it is not the lowest, as there are other Line 6 stations with platforms at a lower elevation.  History  Cuatro Caminos is one of the first eight stations in the Madrid Metro system, opening on 17 October 1919 when King Alfonso XIII inaugurated Line 1, which initially ran from Sol to Cuatro Caminos. The Line 1 platforms were originally long, and were extended to in the 1960s. They are located underneath Santa Engracia street close to the roundabout. On 6 March 1929, Line 1 was extended to Cuatro Caminos to Tetu√°n, and as a result Cuatro Caminos was no longer a terminus. The Line 2 platforms were inaugurated on 10 September 1929 when Line 2 was extended from Quevedo to Cuatro Caminos, making it a Line 2 terminus. Line 2 has a central platform and one side platform, both long, and is only one of three stations in the network with this configuration. The platforms are located underneath Bravo Murillo street south of the roundabout at the same depth as the Line 1 platforms. The Line 6 platforms entered into service on 10 October 1979 when the first segment of Line 6 was inaugurated, running from Cuatro Caminos to Pac√≠fico. On 13 January 1987, Line 6 was extended from Cuatro Caminos to Ciudad Universitaria. The platforms are the deepest in the system, and are located beneath Raimundo Fern√°ndez Villaverde street east of the roundabout. In 2004-2005, an underpass was constructed for automotive traffic underneath the roundabout, replacing a previous overpass. The tunnel was built in the free space between Lines 1 and 2 and Line 6, which had previously been left empty in case the Metro decided to connect a fourth line to the station. Between 3 July and 13 November 2016, Line 1 was closed for renovations between Plaza de Castilla and Sierra de Guadalupe, a segment that included Cuatro Caminos. Renovations included tunnel repairs, cleaning, and waterproofing, the installation of rigid overhead lines, and other work. Starting 14 September 20156, Cuatro Caminos was temporarily used as a terminus for Line 1 when service was reestablished between the station and Plaza de la Castilla. Line 1 service was fully restored on 13 November.

Consisiting of 1207 hectares of mainly rural land, it is located north east of Cowbridge. The population of the community was 534 in the 2011 census.

Accessed 17 May 2014 A mile to the east from the village lies the Hensol Forest, while the remains of Talyfan Castle are to the north. History The village of St Donats takes its name from the late medieval church dedicated to St Dunwyd, which was first mentioned in 1173. Set in mainly agricultural lands the compact village contains the 18th century Great House and a fine farm group. Benjamin Heath Malkin mentions Welsh St Donats in his 1803 work The Scenery, Antiquities and Biography of South Wales, while passing along the 'great road' that ran north of the village, which linked England to the port of Milford Haven. He mentioned the varying style of genuine Welsh pigstye in the area and the fact that Welsh St Donats \\"... is perhaps scarcely a village in the principality, where less English is spoken.\\" As of 2019, spoken Welsh in the Vale is one of the lowest levels in Wales, with less than ten percent of adults identifying themselves as Welsh speakers. Buildings of note The church, St Dunwyd, is a Grade I listed building and despite being mentioned in 1173 there are no architectural remains in the present structure from that period.http://www.eastvalechurches.org.uk /ChurchWelshStDonats.html East Vale Churches website. Accessed 17 May 2014. Modifications were made to the church in the 16th century, but remaining features, such as the font to the south door, demonstrate 13th century dates. The church sits to the north end of a knot of houses, mostly recent, and within the middle of these lies the Great House. The Great House, is a two-storey 18th century building of modest features consisting of three, three-bay units, the centre of which is higher than the sides. Prisk Farm, which is situated about a mile to the west, once boasted an elaborate modelled plaster ceiling, of 17th or 18th century design. Unique amongst the farm houses of the area, the ceiling was lost when it collapsed c 1989. To the north of Welsh St Donats lies the remains of Talyfan Castle (Welsh: Castell Tal-y-fan). Once serving as a caput for the Siwards and the St Quintins, Talyfan was one of several lordships within the Vale of Glamorgan during the 12th and 13th century. There is some speculation that it was built to replace the motte castle at Ystradowen, but was never completed. By the middle of the 13th century the castle had passed from the Siwards to the ownership of Richard de Clare, Lord of Glamorgan. The Lords of Glamorgan held onto the castle the late 15th century when it reverted to the monarchy after the death of Jasper Tudor. It was bought by John Thomas Bassett of Llantrithyrd in 1545 and remained in private hands since. Today the remains of the castle stand on the lands of Talyfan Farm, though there is little left to see. The original protective ditch can be observed along with a length of the outer embankment. A jumble of ruined walls mark the remains of the castle itself along with those of the farm house that superseded it. It is presently under the ownership of CADW.

The Garde was named after Walter Garde, a Hartford and New London businessman; it opened on September 22, 1926 with the silent film The Marriage Clause starring matinee idols Francis X. Bushman (1883-1966) and Billie Dove (1903-1997). It was hailed by the press as one of the finest theaters in New England. It was a stage for Vaudeville as well as film, as was typical in that time, and variety acts of music, comedy, acrobatics, and magic were interspersed between feature films, comedy shorts, and newsreels. In September 1929, the theater and the four-story Garde office building were purchased by Warner Bros. for $1 million, one of 18 theaters in New England that the studio purchased to introduce their new \\"talking pictures\\" technology. The Garde was closed in 1977 under the ownership of RKO-Stanley-Warner and sold to a local business family. It was in danger of being demolished until 1985 when the Garde Arts Center was founded to save and reuse the theatre.\\"History\\" on the Garde Arts Center website References Notes External links * Theatres in Connecticut Buildings and structures in New London, Connecticut Art Deco architecture in Connecticut Theatres completed in 1926 ","title":"Garde Arts Center"},{"id":"41197230","text":"John \\"Jack\\" Walton was a professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1900s and 1910s.

Zeng () was a historical state in China. The state exists during the time for Zhou dynasty (1046 ‚Äì 256 BC) and had its territory in the area around Suizhou in the Hubei province. Archaeological findings indicate that Zeng could have been the same state as Sui. The state of Zeng got attention partly because of the finding of Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng in 1978. The center of the territory of Zeng was in the wast part of Suizhou and findings indicate that the area reached up to the south west border of Henan province. Suizhou was an important military hub because of its strategic location towards the threatening state of Chu. The area was also an important transport route between Chinese Central Plateau and the copper findings at the middle Yangtze. All the tombs from the lords of Zeng state was found within 10 km from each other in Suizhou. A historical record indicate that the state of Zeng was founded during the time of Western Zhou (1045 ‚Äì 771 BC) and had its peak of political ambitions in the beginning of Eastern Zhou (770‚Äì256 BC). Zeng still exists in the beginning of the Warring States period that started in the beginning of the 5th-century BC. Zeng was mentioned in the historical chronicle Spring and Autumn Annals where also another state named Zeng was mentioned that was located in the Shandong province. Relations with the state of Sui In most of the earliest Chinese historical annals, Sui was the only state mentioned in the actual area around Suizhou in Hubei during the time for Eastern Zhou. Based on a few relics in the 1930s where the state of Zeng was mentioned, historian stared speculate that also another state exists in the area at the same time. A large number of findings with inscriptions of \\"Zeng\\" was found after 1949 in the territory of former Sui confirmed the speculation. After the finding of Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng in 1978 together with a large number of other well-preserved artefacts from the same area led to discussions around the relationship between Zeng and Sui, and many theories figured. On October 4, 1978 the historian Li Xueqin published the article \\"The Riddle of the State of Zeng\\" in Guangming Daily where he stated that the state of Zeng and Sui was the same place. The professor Ren Wei from the Archaeology Department of Zhengzhou University hade the theorie that Zeng conquered and occupied the state of Sui, but the most supported theory is the one from Li Xueqin and it was common during the Eastern Zhou that one state use two names.

United Square is a board game, a card game and interactive game software for PC's and most tablets. It is a game of logic that may be considered to fall under the same category as chess and checkers, for advance players resort to employing strategy and deep reflection in outwitting their opponents in order to win a match.  History  The United Square game was conceptualized and created by Julien Selz sometime in 2011. The game was featured and is presently among the collection of playable online board games in the website Board Game Arena, which is a free gaming site which provides new gaming experience to board game aficionados by connecting board gaming with video gaming. United Square was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on January 17, 2012 under Registration No. 4086595 and with the Institut National de la Propri√©t√© Industrielle (INPI) in Paris, France under Registration No. 2011 0162 in 2011 On September 10, 2012, United Square unveiled its new version and packaging that carries the name Cube¬≤, literally Cube Square. Improvements were added to the new graphics on the tiles, the weight is much lighter and the size much smaller making it much easier to carry around.  Rules  The board game is composed of 24 square tiles; each tile piece is designed with 4 triangles colored Blue, Red, Yellow and Green. The game can be played by 2 to 4 players (exists in 1 player mode in all Digital Versions for PC, IOS App and Android) where the number of tiles is divided equally among the number of players. Two colors will be assigned to 2 players and one color for players more than two. The players, alternately, place their own tile pieces beside another tile piece completing a single colored square figure. A player gains one point for every complete square figure containing his own color. The game is considered finished when the tiles pieces have all been used or no more tiles could be placed. The player earning the most points wins the game.  Strategy  Advanced players resort to strategy to block an opponent's move and sometimes even forcing the latter to place a tile to gain points in his favor. The game can be compared to the game of chess, where players use tactics to plan moves ahead and strategically place the tile pieces to gain advantage over an opponent. Though it is said that the game is as easy as playing checkers, playing United Square game requires constant concentration and deep knowledge of the possible color combinations of tiles to anticipate your move or that of an opponent's.  Versions  A United Square Pocket Size version Different commercial and non-commercial versions have been made since its conception in 2011 catering to user's varying preferences. * Pocket Size Cube or the Cube¬≤ similar to a card game, this version can be considered as one of the smallest board games around. * United Square Board Game is the classic format. * United Square Digital versions which are free applications can be downloaded from the official website to run on PC and is also available both in Google Play and the Apple Store. Different game levels from Novice, Amateur, Pro, Expert and Master are available on these versions allowing players to progress on their play while enjoying every match. Early 2013, the United Square tile designs was adapted to the twisty puzzles, a format quite similar to the famous Rubik's cube.

Soon after the funeral she was befriended by Simm's brother Samuel; he was a stockbroker whose wife had died, leaving him with two daughters and a debt of ¬£3,000 which Ann paid. Clapham, Finsbury and Herne Bay Hyde Park Gardens, 2007 Ann bought Cottage House at Clapham Common for herself, her sister Sarah Tebbitt and Sarah's children. She then moved to Finsbury Circus where she lived with her companion Louisa Little between August 1835 and January 1838. When she left Clapham she settled a capital of ¬£30,000 and lifetime annuity on Sarah. However, at the 1867 Chancery hearing, Sarah maintained that the settlement was made at the behest of Simm Smith \\"to keep the family out of her pocket.\\" She left Finsbury Circus around 1840. Meanwhile, between 1834 and 1840 she was spending part of each summer in Herne Bay.Herne Bay Cultural Trail: Clock Tower, Central Parade Retrieved 23 November 2013 Her town house, Paddington In 1840 she bought her town house, 17 Hyde Park Gardens, Paddington.

Meanwhile, Samuel managed her accounts. Ann made many additions and improvements to Charmandean. In one room she installed panelling which had been removed from St. Mary's Church, Broadwater during repairs, and in her chapel-room she fitted a stained-glass window from the same church.Smail, Henfrey. \\"Ann Thwaytes\\", in Friends of Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery: Broadsheet, Issue 4, Spring 2011, pp. 9‚Äì12, excerpt from \\"Notable Houses of Worthing\\" She added an iron-framed conservatory, and two pairs of wrought iron entrance-gates made as replicas of the former Buckingham Palace gates. The western gates were requisitioned in World War II. The eastern iron gates remained in Charmandean Lane for some years but are now gone, leaving only the carved gateposts.CharmandeanHistory.co.uk: History The house was demolished in 1963.Sussex Express Saturday 14 April 1866: Obituary of Ann Thwaytes Family rifts During the 1840s, Ann offered to pay for a cadetship for one of Sarah's sons, but the offer was rejected. Sarah was called to Charmandean and told that Ann had been \\"advised by friends\\" to end their connection. A few years later, Ann was visited by one of Sarah's daughters who was received politely, but also told never to return. In 1850 Mrs Cook, another of Sarah's daughters, visited Ann and a friendship began. Ann bought this niece a house in Broadwater, but Mrs Cook too was rejected by Ann due to a financial disagreement, and cut off with a comfortable ¬£450 per annum. Death and contested will Charmandean, 19th century She died aged 76 at her London town house in 1866, and was buried on 13 April in a vaulted grave at Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery, in plot C4.1‚Äì4.10‚Äì13, near the North Chapel.Death cert: Thwaytes, Ann, 76, Worthing, 2b/194Sussex Express, Saturday 14 April 1866: Obituary of Mrs Thwaytes Her estate was worth ¬£400,000. ¬£45,000 was left to her nieces and nephews, but there was no legacy for her sister Sarah Tebbitt. She left ¬£5,000 to Dr Collett who attended her last illness, and generous legacies to servants and acquaintances. One account says that she left the remainder of the estate, plus ¬£30,000 and Charmandean her country house, to Simm Smith. His brother inherited the other half of the residue, and was to inherit Charmandean after Simm Smith's death. Another account says that Simm Smith and his brother Samuel were to inherit ¬£180,000.Robert Bernard Martin, Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life, Faber & Faber 2011 From 26 April to May 1867, The Times reported the case of Smith and Others v Tebbitt and Others, in which Sarah Tebbitt and two nieces contested her Will \\"on the grounds of undue execution, incapacity and undue influence.\\" At the hearing, the legatees declared Ann sane whereas those left out of the Will, led by Ann's nephew, recounted her religious delusions. It was during this case that the unmarried situation of Ann Thwaytes's mother came to light, because illegitimacy might put Sarah Tebbitt's position of rightful heir in doubt. On 6 August 1867 the judge cited monomania as her illness, and found that she was of unsound mind when signing her Will, thus making it invalid. He said, however, that if she had been found to have been in sound mind, there remained the question of possible undue influence by the Smith brothers, putting the validity of the Will doubly in doubt. Religious delusions Sussex Pad Inn, before 1905 These delusions appear to have started in 1832 with the \\"low fever\\" and the conviction that she was part of the Trinity, and they continued for the rest of her life. During the full moon at Broadwater she was observed by worried neighbours to dress in white and to drive the same route in her yellow carriage ritually: past the old Sussex Pad Inn (now replaced with a hotel), over Old Shoreham Bridge, and back home again.\\"The old Sussex Pad Inn is now demolished and replaced with the Sussex Pad Hotel She thought she was the Bride of Christ and that Judgement Day would occur in her lavishly-prepared Hyde Park drawing room. She would talk to her friend Louisa Little, her niece Mrs Cook who noted Ann's sayings in a diary, and to servants and tradesmen, about her religious beliefs, but would close the discussion if rebuffed. She would allow sermons to be read to her, and did not attend church; however she paid for a vault at Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery for the interment of Simm Smith and herself. Gifts and donations Motivations for philanthropy Working class Londoners, 1877. Ann Thwaytes could not hide her humble origins Besides straightforward compassion for the poor, there are two other possible motivations for Mrs Thwaytes's philanthropy. Firstly there was the 19th-century progress of Evangelicalism, which encouraged good works from those with religious sensibility and social pity. Secondly, following the expansion of the middle classes in the 18th and 19th centuries, beneficence was \\"an avenue for entry into elite society for women and gave them a sense of place and direction outside the home.\\"BC Protestand Orphans Home: Women and Philanthropy in the 19th Century In other words, for a woman of known humble origins and at the same time a wealthy widow looking for a place in society, philanthropy would be in her best interests. However 19th-century British elite society was based in the popular imagination upon elegant culture, not money or good deeds, and Herne Bay Clock Tower's opening ceremony drew mockery from the Figaro in London of 6 October 1836, in which she was called a Cockney and her clock, celebration and philanthropy laughed at.Figaro in London, 6 October 1836 Herne Bay area Clock Tower in 1895 Between 1834 and 1840 she visited Herne Bay regularly with friends, staying at 30 Marine Terrace on Central Parade, and became an established town benefactor of Herne Bay. She funded and laid the foundation stone in 1836 for two schoolrooms to be built as an extension of Christ Church in William Street. This church had recently been founded by Sir Henry Oxenden, and her friend Simm Smith was head of the trustees for the church.

There is a blue plaque, recording that she funded the Clock Tower, at Central Parade, Herne Bay.Open Plaques: Ann Thwaytes (1789‚Äì1866 Retrieved 24 November 2013 According to the late Herne Bay historian, Harold Gough, Mrs Thwaytes suddenly \\"took a huff\\" and left Herne Bay. After the Clock Tower had been opened, builder George Burge began work on the old St John's Church in Brunswick Square. Eventually the money ran out; Burge ran out of bricks and had to delay completion. Around 1839 to 1840, Burge informed Mrs Thwaytes that if the Clock Tower's bricks had been available for the building of the church, St John's would have been completed \\"long before.\\" In response, Mrs Thwaytes left Herne Bay, never to return. Broadwater area St Marys, renovations 1866 One of Ann's first good works at Charmandean was to give coal to the poor. A Broadwater coal distribution society was formed; she supported this and continued to distribute coal regularly. She contributed generously to a subscription appeal for a new infirmary at Broadwater. This project was started by her friend and consulting surgeon Dr Frederick Dixon who had founded the local Worthing Dispensary in 1829 and treated poor patients for free. Dixon was an amateur geologist who died young, and Ann funded his book, The Geology of Sussex when it was published posthumously. She became financially involved in the 1853‚Äì1855 restoration of St. Mary's Church, Broadwater, contributing to chancel repairs, giving ¬£100 towards a new organ and committing to the payment of ¬£40 per year to the organist. She contributed towards one of the new stained glass windows which was dedicated to the late Reverends Peter Wood and William Davison.

A sixth-century BCE timber shrine was discovered in 2013.  2013 discovery  Mayadevi Temple and ruins of ancient monasteries in Lumbini In November 2013, an international team of archaeologists digging under the temple discovered the remains of an ancient tree shrine dated before 550 BCE. The researchers speculated that the site is the earliest evidence of Buddhist structures and the first archaeological evidence of Gautama Buddha's life. The excavation was headed by Robin Coningham of Durham University, UK, and Kosh Prasad Acharya of the Pashupati Area Development Trust, Nepal. According to Coningham, the shrine is \\"the earliest Buddhist shrine in the world.\\" The speculations of the researchers were widely reported in international press, to the dismay of the rest of the scientific community, who mostly have disputed the conclusions of the researchers. Julia Shaw, a lecturer in South Asian archaeology at University College London, cautioned that the shrine may represent pre-Buddhist tree worship, and that further research is needed. The conclusions drawn by the researchers were also heavily criticized by Buddhist scholar Richard Gombrich.

For several centuries the main residence was an early Elizabethan mansion. Description The Elizabethan mansion was built on the site of an existing building by John Bere in 1551. After the estate had been sold off in small lots and the mansion had suffered years of neglect, it was demolished and replaced by a smaller house in the late 18th century. The principal front of the mansion faced the west, and was originally approached by an avenue of lime trees from Short-Hill, near the Spital-house. Some of the tree stumps remained until James Storey's time (1780s). A long gallery ran along the whole front of the mansion, into which the several apartments opened. A large court in front of the mansion nearly extended across the present street, rendering the road narrow and inconvenient; but on rebuilding the house, James Storey set back his walls in a line with the rest of the street. Hasted says on the gateway, entering the court, were the initials of the founder, J. B. [John Bere] and the date 1551. At the time it was demolished a record of this family appeared on an oaken beam, to the following effect, \\". On the pulling down of the gate-house, a part of the materials, with some of the letters of the inscription, were purchased by an inhabitant of Horton Kirby, and affixed on the walls of his house, where they were still to be seen in 1844. Ownership In the reign of Edward II (1307‚Äì1327) the manor was owned by Thomas de Luda. Towards the end of the reign of Edward III (1327‚Äì1733) it had passed to John Horsman, and it is likely that he built a large new dwelling. It is after this building that the manor gained its name. Tomas Horsman, John Horsman's son and heir, died without children at the beginning of the reign of Henry VI. So he willed the estate to his widow Margaret. She remarried to ‚Äî‚Äî Shardlow, and upon her death c. 1640 bequeathed it to her kinsman Thomas Brown, whose daughter and sole heir Katherine, annexed it to the patrimony of Robert Blague, one of the Barons of the Exchequer. They had a son Barnaby Blague who inherited the estate and sold it to John Bere in 1541 (the 33rd year of the reign of Henry VIII). In 1551 John Bere rebuilt the mansion and gate-house, and on the latter, inscribed his initials, and the time of its erection. He married twice. His first wife was Alice, daughter and heir of William Nysell, of Wrotham; his second wife, was Joan, or Johanna Egglefield, by whom he left two sons and two daughters. His daughter Ann became the wife of Christopher Twisleton of Barley, Yorkshire; his other daughter Dorothy died unmarried. His eldest son Henry inherited Horsmans Place but died two years later and the estate passed to his brother Nicholas. Edward Bere, his younger son and last remaining descendant, died leaving the estate to John Twisleton, a grandson son and direct living descendant of Alice, aunt of Edward Bere. John Twisleton was created a baronet by the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell in 1658, but that baronetcy passed into oblivion at the restoration. John Twisleton had four wives. By his third wife, Elizabeth (died 1762), eldest daughter and co-heir of James, Viscount Saye and Sele, he left an only daughter, first the wife of George Twisleton, of Wormesly in Yorkshire, and secondly of Robert Mignon. John Twisleton died in 1682, having bequeathed this manor and seat to his nephew, John, eldest son of his younger brother Philip (during the English Civil War a Roundhead colonel). This John (died 28 July 1721) usually resided at Horsmans Place, and throughout his long life appears to have taken much interest in the welfare of Dartford. The estate passed to his nephew John Twisleton (died 1757 without issue). There was a court case between two relatives of the last deceased owner, a Thomas Cockshutt and a John Twisleton (died 1763) over possession of Horsmans Place. The case was tried at Maidstone, in 1758, and John Twisleton was adjudged to be entitled to the estate in Dartford. John Twisleton died leaving three sons, the eldest of whom was killed in Germany the same year. His brothers became entitled to their father‚Äôs estates, as heirs in gavelkind. On a partition of the estates, Horsmans Place in Dartford fell to the share of the second son, Thomas, a colonel in the guards, afterwards Lord Saye and Sele. Thomas sold Horsmans Place in 1768 with the rest of the estates in Dartford, to Thomas Williams and Thomas Smith. The property comprised a great number of the houses and a considerable portion of the lands in Dartford. Williams and Smith broke up the holding, and sold it in separate portions at a great profit. They sold the mansion to Richard Leigh (died 1772), serjeant-at-law, on whose death the house was inherited by his son Richard. Richard Leigh the younger waited until his mother vacated the premises in 1780 and then while it was advertised to be sold or let the mansion remained unoccupied, falling into a dilapidated state. It was rented in 1784 by James Storey, originally an artillery driver, who came to Dartford while the camp existed on Dartford Heath. Being a very industrious man, he was employed and patronised by several gentlemen in the town, and commenced a market garden business in the garden opposite Horsmans Place. He resided in the house for about a year before sub-letting it to the Rev. William Wiseman, master of the Grammar School. When Wiseman left, Storey moved back in, but finding the premises much too large and greatly dilapidated, he obtained Mr. Leigh's consent to replace the mansion with a house of smaller dimensions better adapted for his business. Eventually a James Story purchased the house and remaining land.

This was first reported by Schooler and Englster-Schooler (1990) where it was shown that the effects can be observed across multiple domains of cognition which are known to rely on non-verbal knowledge and perceptual expertise. One example of this is memory, which has been known to be influenced by language. Seminal work by Carmichael and collaborators (1932) demonstrated that when verbal labels are connected to non-verbal forms during an individual's encoding process it could potentially bias the way those forms are reproduced in the future. Because of this, memory performance relying on reportable aspects of memory that encode visual forms, should be vulnerable to the effects of verbalization. Initial findings Schooler and Englster- Schooler (1990) were the first to report findings of verbal overshadowing. In their study, participants watched a video of a simulated robbery and were instructed to either verbally describe the robber or engage in a control task. Those who engaged in giving a verbal description were less likely to correctly identify the robber from a test lineup, compared to those who engaged in the control task. A larger effect was detected when the verbal description was provided 20, rather than 5, minutes after the video, and immediately before the test lineup. A meta-analysis by Meissner and Brigham (2008) supported the effects of verbal overshadowing, showing a small but reliably negative effect. General effects of verbal overshadowing The effects of verbal overshadowing have been generalized across multiple domains of cognition that are known to rely on non-verbal knowledge and perceptual expertise, such as memory. Memory has been known to be influenced by language. Seminal work by Carmichael and collaborators (1932) demonstrated that labels attached to, or associated with, non-verbal forms during memory encoding can affect the way the forms were subsequently reproduced. Because of this, memory performance that relies on reportable aspects of memory that encode visual forms should be vulnerable to the effects of verbalization. Pelizzon, Brandimonte, and Luccio (2002) found that visual memory representations appear to incorporate visual, special, and temporal characteristics. It is explained as follows: Hetano, Ueno, Kitagami, and Kawaguchi found that verbal overshadowing is likely to occur when participants verbally described targets in detail. Detailed verbal descriptions resulted in more frequently inaccurate descriptions that in turn created inaccurate representations in the memories of participants. Inaccuracies are also likely to occur when face recognition comes immediately after verbalization. Other forms of non-verbal knowledge affected by verbal overshadowing include the following: Verbalization of stimuli leads to the disruption of non-reportable processes that are necessary for achieving insight solutions, which are distinct from language processes. Schooler, Ohlsson, and Brooks (1993) found that face recognition requires information that cannot be adequately verbalized, giving rise to difficulty in describing factors in recognition judgments. Subjects were less effective in solving insight problems when compelled to put their thoughts in words, which suggests that language may interfere with thought. The verbal overshadowing effect was not seen when participants engaged in articulatory suppression. Performance was reduced in both the verbal and non-verbal description conditions. This is evidence that verbal encoding plays a role in face recognition. By testing with distracting faces presented between study and test, Lloyd-Jones and Brown (2008) suggested a dual-process approach to recognition memory took place, that verbalization influenced familiarity-based processes at first, but its effects were later seen on recollection, when discrimination between items became more difficult. Verbal overshadowing in facial recognition The verbal overshadowing effect can be found for facial recognition because faces are predominately processed in a holistic or configurable manner. (Tanaka & Farah, 1993; Tanaka & Sengco, 1997) Verbalizing one's memory for a face is done using a featural or analytic strategy, leading to a drift from the configurable information about the face and to impaired recognition performance. However, Fallshore & Schooler (1995) found that the verbal overshadowing effect was not found when participants described faces of races different from their own. A study by Brown and Lloyd-Jones (2003) found that there was no verbal overshadowing effect found in car descriptions; it was only seen in facial descriptions. The authors noted that descriptions were no different on any measure including accuracy. It is suggested that less expertise in verbalizing faces rather than cars invokes a stronger shift in verbal and featural processing. This supports the concept of a transfer inappropriate retrieval framework and addresses some limitations of the effect. Wickham and Swift (2006) suggested that the verbal overshadowing effect is not seen in describing all faces, and one aspect that determines this is distinctiveness. Results showed that typical faces produce verbal overshadowing, while distinctive faces did not. In studies of eyewitness reports, variation in response criteria given by participants influenced the quality of the descriptions generated and accuracy on identification task, known as the retrieval-based effect. Face recognition was also impaired when subjects described a familiar face, such as a parent, or when describing a previously seen but novel face. Dodson, Johnson, and Schooler (1997) found that recognition was also impaired when participants were provided with a description of a previously seen face, and they were able to ignore provided versus self-generated descriptions more easily. This finding of verbal overshadowing suggested that eyewitness recognition is not only affected by their own descriptions, but of descriptions heard from others, such other eyewitness testimonies. Voice recognition The verbal overshadowing effect has also been found to affect voice identification. Research shows that describing a non-verbal stimuli leads to a decrease in recognition accuracy. In an unpublished study by Schooler, Fiore, Melcher, and Ambadar (1996), participants listened to a tape-recorded voice, after which they were asked either to verbally describe it or to not do so, and then asked to distinguish the voice from 3 similar distractor voices. The results showed that verbal overshadowing impaired accuracy of recognition based on gut feeling, suggesting an overall verbal overshadowing for voice recognition. Due to the forensic relevance of voices heard over the telephone and harassing phone calls that are often a problem for police, Perfect, Hunt, and Harris (2002) examined the influence of three factors on accuracy and confidence in voice recognition from a line-up. They expected to find an effect, because voice represents a class of stimuli that is difficult to describe verbally. This meets Schooler et al.'s (1997) modality mismatch criterion, meaning that describing the speakers age, gender, or accent is difficult, making voice recognition susceptible to the verbal overshadowing phenomenon. It was found that the method of memory encoding had no impact on performance, and that hearing a telephone voice reduced confidence but did not affect accuracy. They also found that providing a verbal description impaired accuracy but had no effect on confidence. The data showed an effect of verbal overshadowing in voice recognition and provided yet another disassociation between confidence and performance. Although there was a difference in confidence level, witnesses were able to identify voices over the telephone as accurately as voices heard directly. The authors stated, \\"This effect is useful in the respect that it demonstrates that the lack of a confidence effect with verbal overshadowing is not due to low sensitivity of the confidence measure\\". (p. 979) The data from the study suggested that the main effect of verbal overshadowing was seen mainly in the telephone voices. They also stated, \\"However, because of the statistical limitations, it is perhaps best not to over-interpret this finding until it is replicated in a larger sample\\". (P.979) Perfect, Hunt, and Harris (2002) did a small-scale study that showed a reliable verbal overshadowing effect on voice identification, thus confirming previous research that showed verbally describing a to-be-recognized (non- verbal) stimulus leads to decrease in recognition accuracy without reducing confidence. This disassociation between performance and confidence offers scope to test theoretical accounts of the verbal overshadowing phenomena, and it is an issue that has been neglected so far. A more recent study by Wilson, Seale-Carlisle, and Mickes (2017) found that confidence is predictive of accuracy in verbal overshadowing. They found that high confidence identifications are lower in accuracy compared to what was observed in the lineups. Other results from their study concluded that police should encourage reporting crimes immediately and take down descriptions of perpetrators as soon as possible in order to reduce the effects of verbal overshadowing. Recognition criteria The verbal overshadowing effect may effect changes in recognition criteria rather than in processing style or underlying memory. One explanation for the effect is based on a shift in a person's recognition criteria, or increased hesitancy in choosing someone from a lineup. Verbalization leads witnesses to use more precise or exact recognition criteria, therefore lowering identification rates, the phenomena can be captured by a shift in recognition criteria. Placement of recognition criteria affects performance. With conservative criteria, people are unwilling to identify anyone in a lineup, but with liberal criteria, identification rates are greater. The criterion effect is persistent and known to play a large part in recognition paradigms that allow voluntary responses, moreso when there is a tradeoff between quantity and accuracy. However, with the criterion effect controlled, confidence and perceived difficulty cannot account for the effects of verbalization. The verbal overshadowing effect is caused by strict recognition criteria that only affect identification rates when a \\"not present\\" response is possible. Clare and Lewandowsky (2004) found that verbalization can have a positive effect on identification. Although resulting in fewer correct identifications from lineups, it also reduced the number of false identification rates within lineups. Because of this, verbalization may protect innocent suspects from being falsely identified as perpetrators, suggesting that not all effects of verbalization on eyewitnesses are bad. With the standard description instructions in place, verbal overshadowing occurs because people have become more reluctant to identify someone from a lineup after they provide a description of the perpetrator. The criterion-effect explanation is one that accounts for a large verbal overshadowing effect in optional lineups, the absence of a verbal overshadowing effect with forced choice identification, and the advantageous effect of verbalization with optional-choice lineups. Retrieval-based interference theory Some researchers (e.g. Hunt and Carroll, Clare and Lewandowsky) hypothesize that verbal overshadowing is caused by retrieval-based interference, which is a change to the original memory trace made during verbalization of the given memory. Verbalizing of a non-verbal stimulus brings a verbal memory representation of that stimulus. When tested, this interferes with the original perceptual memory representation on which accurate recognition performance depends. The content of verbalization influences the outcome of identification by retroactively interfering with the original memory trace. Studies have found that when participants were forced to provide detailed descriptions of perpetrators, even if this involved guessing, a larger verbal overshadowing effect resulted than when they were discouraged from guessing. The inaccuracy is thought to be caused by descriptions interfering with the earlier memory. Finger and Pezdek (1999) took this as a retroactive interference effect on memory, caused by higher verbalization when participants completed a complicated rather than an easy task. Meissner and Brigham (2001) showed that when participants were allowed to guess when forced to provide a detailed description of a robber, the size of the verbal overshadowing effect was greater than when they were discouraged from guessing. Verbalization interfered with performance on new and familiar faces, but it did not interfere with priming. They argued that verbalization encouraged a long-lasting shift toward greater visual processing of individual facial features at the expense of more global visual processing (which is, for the most part, beneficial in recognition of faces and important for discriminating faces from non-faces in the face-decision task. Verbally describing a visual memory of a face can interfere with subsequent visual recognition of that face. Retrieval-based interference has been challenged by several findings and by the fact that verbal overshadowing can have an effect on description beyond a specific face, to other, undescribed faces. Recoding interference hypothesis According to the recoding interference hypothesis, verbalizing non-verbal memory makes the visual representations less accurate. The recoding interference hypothesis predicts that verbal overshadowing will occur more readily if participants generate less accurate verbal descriptions. A computational model detected core processing principles of the recoding interference hypothesis to simulate facial recognition, and it reproduced these behavioral phenomena as well as verbal overshadowing, providing an account as to why target description accuracy does not linearly predict recognition accuracy. The study addressed the replicability issues in verbal overshadowing. Hatano et al. (2015) stated: The study found that verbalization changed the nature of representations, rather than shifting the types of processing. Then, this recoded representation was used for (or affected) subsequent visual recognition and resulted in a failure in computing item- specific information. The phenomena from the study are predictable from the recoding interference hypothesis. It is explained as followed by the authors: The researchers found that generated verbal descriptions affected not just the polarity (familiarity) values of \\"old\\" items but also those of \\"new\\" items, as a function of how accurately the descriptions captured the distractor faces. This was the reason why target-description accuracy in isolation does not necessarily predict the effect of verbal overshadowing in a linear fashion. The model links verbal and visual code as in the face-recognition model. Verbal descriptions predicted recognition impairment and indicated that theory about interference in the memory domain is potentially useful when discussing the verbalization effect on non-verbal recognition. The study also noted that it did not consider whether this account can be extended to the visual-imagery domain beyond facial recognition. Brandimonte and Collina (2008) conducted three experiments that support a retrieval based, recording-interference explanation of verbal overshadowing. They found that the effects of verbal overshadowing can be attenuated by reactivating featural aspects of a stimulus, with any cues that trigger the activation of featural representations. Transfer inappropriate retrieval hypothesis The transfer inappropriate retrieval (TIR) hypothesis states that activation of the verbal processes needed for a description stops the following application of nonverbal face recognition processes without changing the memory of the perpetrator. TIR theory does not expect the accuracy of verbalization to be related to accuracy of identification. All that is required for verbal overshadowing to happen is the act of verbalizing, to put a description into words, which produces an expected processing shift to an inappropriate style. This explains the generalization of interference to non-described faces as well as to described ones. The TIR hypothesis assumes the original memory trace of the target remains and becomes temporarily inaccessible, rather than being permanently changed by verbalization. Verbalization leads cognitive processing to an inappropriate style, which stops retrieval of the non-verbal information needed for facial recognition. Verbal overshadowing comes solely because \\"verbalization indices inappropriate processing operations which area incommensurate with the processes required for successful recognition performance, that is, there is a transfer inappropriate processing shift\\". A shift is not tied to a particular item that has been previously coded, but rather generalizes to new stimuli that have not been encountered before. It is proposed that verbalization requires a shift to verbal processing, and this shift obstructs the application of non-verbal (face-specific) processing in the following face recognition test. The key difference from other hypotheses is whether an operation-specific representation is postulated or not. Also referred to as the processing shift account, TIR proposes that verbal overshadowing does not comes from conflicting representations, but from the effect that verbal description has in leading participants to switch from an appropriate to an inappropriate mode of processing, which carries over to the recognition test. Hunt and Carroll (2008) reported results supporting this interpretation. They found that, According to this hypothesis, participants in the proximal imagining condition were more impaired because they encoded the target face at first using a holistic, non-verbal, and non-analytic process. After, a switch was made to explicit, analytic processing, to write or verbalize their description. They then failed to revert to critical non- verbal, holistic mode, which is more effective in making a recognition decision. Contrary to that, participants in the distal imagining condition experienced less disruption from having verbalized the faces prior to the recognition test, adopting instead a distal time perspective, which is known to facilitate abstract or holistic thinking. (Forster et al., 2004) The study found a verbal overshadowing effect when participants were forced to engage in extensive verbalization by making them fill out a blank, lined page with a description of the previously seen face. This effect was not observed when participants were not forced to engage in this extensive verbalization. This suggested that prevention of verbal overshadowing in real life situations can be effected with a manipulation, such as encouraging global thinking. Consistent with TIR, a study by Dehon, Vanootighem, and Bredart (2013) showed the absence of correlation between descriptor accuracy, vocabulary performance, and correct identification. Neither quality nor quantity of descriptors affected identification accuracy, which was only impacted by the act of verbally describing a face. The results held for the immediate test condition, \\"post-encoding delay\\", consistent with the hypothesis. This suggested that the content of description is irrelevant and that the verbal overshadowing effect occurred due to a shift in featural processing caused by the verbalization, thus supporting the TIR. Westerman and Larsen (1997) suggested that verbal overshadowing effects are more pervasive that initially believed. They showed that verbal description can impair face recognition when the described object is not the recognition target. This extends findings from Dodson et al. (1997) to a situation where face recognition is impaired by the description of a non-face object. Consistent with TIR, this points to a general shift in face-recognition processing as a result of producing a description of any object. Some problems with this theory are that identification accuracy can be affected even if no retrieval operations are involved and that unrelated nonverbal processes can alleviate the effect of verbalization on identification. Signal detection theory Signal detection theory views impaired recognition as caused by a reduced ability to discriminate, that reduced discriminability in test suspects is a consequence of describing the robber or perpetrator. Who is susceptible? The verbal overshadowing effect on face identification was found in children as well as adults, with neither accuracy of description, delay, nor target presence in lineup being found to be associated with accuracy. Age increased the number of accurate descriptors produced but not incorrect ones, suggesting that children produce less detailed but not less accurate descriptions than adults. This study holds for 7-8, 10-11, and 13-14 year olds. Further research is needed to detect under which conditions this phenomenon may hold, even in more \\"ecologically valid\\" situations. Older adults have been found to be less affected than young adults by the verbal overshadowing effect. In a study similar to Schooler et al. (1990), Kinlen, Adams-Price, and Henley (2007) showed the following: The findings suggested that verbal expertise, as seen in older adults, may decrease effects of verbal overshadowing in a face recognition task.

The original Article 3 was so drafted because of three main reasons; (a) When it was drafted, the Princely States had not been fully integrated, (b) There was also the possibility of reorganisation of states on linguistic basis; and (c) Constituent Assembly had foreseen that such reorganisation could not be postponed for long. Therefore, accordingly, Article 3 was incorporated in the Constitution providing for an easy and simple method for reorganisation of the states at any time. The Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill, 1955 (Bill No. 60 of 1955) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 21 November 1955. It was introduced by C.C. Biswas, then Minister of Law and Minority Affairs, and sought to amend Articles 3, 100, 101, 103, 148, 189, 190, 192, 276, 297, 311, 316 and 319 of the Constitution. However, the bill could not be taken up for consideration by the House and lapsed on the dissolution of the First Lok Sabha. The government decided to introduce a separate bill to expedite consideration and passing of the amendment to article 3, because it felt that the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill would take a very long time to be disposed of, as it sought to amend several articles. In order to achieve this, the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Bill, 1955 (Bill No. 63 of 1955) which sought to amend article 3, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 28 November 1955, by C.C. Biswas. Clause 2 of this Bill, which sought to amend article 3, was exactly similar to the corresponding clause of the Constitution (Fifth Amendment) Bill, 1955. A motion to refer the Seventh Amendment Bill to the a Select Committee was moved on 30 November 1955. However, this motion failed to obtain the support of a special majority as required by the Rules of Procedure of the House. The government then introduced the Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Bill, 1955 (Bill No. 73 of 1955), which sought to amend article 3. The new bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 9 December 1955, by H.V. Pataskar, then Minister of Legal Affairs, and sought to amend Article 3 of the Constitution. It was debated by the Lok Sabha on 12 and 13 December and passed in its original form on 13 December 1955. After being passed by the House, the Speaker substituted the bracket and words \\"(Eighth Amendment)\\" in clause I of the Bill by the brackets and words \\"(Fifth Amendment)\\", through a formal amendment. This Bill, as so changed, was considered and passed by the Rajya Sabha on 15 December 1955. The Bill received assent from then President Rajendra Prasad on 24 December 1955, and was notified in The Gazette of India on 26 December 1955. The 5th Amendment came into force from 12 December 1956.

The original Hamm Railway Bridge was a double-track bridge built by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company from April 1868 as the first solid bridge across the Rhine in D√ºsseldorf and was opened on 24 July 1870. It was named the K√∂nig-Wilhelm- Br√ºcke (\\"King William Bridge\\") or K√∂nig-Wilhelm-Eisenbahn-Rheinbr√ºcke (‚ÄúKing William railway bridge across the Rhine‚Äù) after the Prussian King William I. It was built as a wrought iron arch supporting a three-span truss to plans of the engineer Pichier of the Harkort Company (Harkort‚Äôsche Fabrik) of Duisburg. The bridge towers on both sides reflected not only a need for architectural decoration, but also a desire to promote the military security of the bridge in the event of a war. For the same reason there was an outer fort at the side of the bridge, which was removed in 1885. Between July and September 1896, the approaches to the bridge were repaired and the track body was renewed under traffic. The whole construction was carried out in heavy traffic with all traffic handled on a single track. After 1896 the greatly increasing train traffic necessitated the building of additional infrastructure to complement the bridge. Between 1909 and 1911, a second, parallel, double-track bridge was built only 32 m upstream. It was built with the same distance between the piers, with a more modern and stronger superstructure as an iron truss arch. As with the older bridge there were bridge towers, but they were larger and stronger. Immediately after the commissioning of the new bridge, the modernisation of old bridge began, with the half-parabolic beams being replaced with new superstructure, which were identical to those of the second bridge. After its completion in November 1912, there were two quasi-identical bridges next to each other, with only the bridge towers differing significantly. Ruins of the old security fort (east bank) Hamm Bridge and ruins of its predecessor During the Second World War, the U.S. Army conquered the neighbouring town of Neuss on 1 March 1945. To slow the advancing troops' crossing of the Rhine, the German Wehrmacht then blew up all the Rhine bridges in D√ºsseldorf, including the Hamm Railway Bridge, on 3 March 1945. Already in late 1945, temporary repairs began on the less damaged northern bridge, on which the two destroyed central arches were replaced by a temporary bridge made from standardised parts to the \\"Schaper-Krupp-Reichsbahn‚Äù design. Despite many difficulties, the bridge was already taken into operation on 31 July 1946. For the final reconstruction of the northern bridge, the least damaged arches of the identical southern bridge were substituted for the temporary spans; this exchange was completed in November 1947, removing the need for speed or weight restrictions. The ruins of the southern bridge were not rebuilt and the iron parts were used for scrap. The piers and bridge towers remain in a ruined condition. The construction of the east‚Äìwest S-Bahn line S 8 in 1984 required the building of a new railway bridge to restore the Hamm Railway Bridge to four tracks again. The cost of this amounted to the equivalent of ‚Ç¨61.4 million. In this case, the span for the shipping channel was greatly expanded. The new bridge was built to the south of the original bridge. The two-span river bridge has as its main span a 250 m long tied arch bridge attached to a through truss span built as a Warren truss with a span of 135 m. The construction is reminiscent of the historic structure. The bridge is designed so that two tracks are within the truss structure and a single track runs on both sides outside of the truss. The 9,000 tonne construction is fully welded. The bridge was built with heavy items of up to 100 tonnes built in an assembly area on the D√ºsseldorf bank and inserted in the final construction. The new bridge was opened in 1987 and had, until the opening of the Gr√ºmpentalbr√ºcke (Gr√ºmpen Viaduct) on the Nuremberg‚ÄìErfurt high-speed railway with a 250-metre-long span, the longest railway bridge span in Germany. The old north bridge was then demolished and the bridge towers were left as a relic of the original bridge of 1870. The Bergische Lehnsritter e. V. club now has its headquarters in the towers.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 13, 1997 and is located in the Wabash Avenue-East Historic District. It opened on January 28, 1922. The theatre was built by Terre Haute resident T. W. Barhydt and was designed by John Eberson. Eberson, who later developed the atmospheric theater style of movie palace, first experimented with atmospheric design elements at the theatre. Eberson stated, \\"Into this Indiana Theatre I have put my very best efforts and endeavors in the art of designing a modern theatre such as I have often pictured as what I would do were I given a free hand.\\" Through this quote Eberson suggests that the Indiana Theatre embodies the raw beginning of his experiment with a \\"dream\\" theater that marked the beginning shift to his atmospheric style. Note: This includes and Throughout its history, the theatre has hosted a wide range of events that have included vaudeville, cinema, performing arts and community celebrations of all types. Long time employees remember nostalgic entertainers such as Frank Sinatra, Red Skelton, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Jack Burns, and the Marx Brothers Road Shows at the Indiana Theater. The Indiana Theatre was chosen as the site for the world premiere screening of Disney's McFarland, USA on November 20, 2014. Through restoration efforts which began in May 2013, the Indiana Theatre's heritage has been preserved and the Indiana has been reborn as a 1,600 seat full service event center which can host a wide range of community gatherings that include live entertainment, performing arts, cinema, wedding events, and fundraisers. Construction The John Schumacher Company of Indianapolis was the builder and the cost of construction was $1,000,000 in 1922 dollars. Construction consisted of 1,665,000 bricks, 7,250 yards of excavation, 24,500 s.f. of cement floor, and 283 tons of steel. All fabrication and plaster work was prepared onsite and the project design and construction was completed in 18+ months. The theater lighting system was the most modern system in the nation. The Indiana Theatre was originally built for vaudeville and silent movies but was adapted to talking movies as vaudeville faded from prominence. Originally, the building fa√ßade featured an enormous peacock which consisted of 3,000 lights and ‚Äúlit up the corner of 7th and Ohio like nothing ever seen before\\". Opening Night On January 27, 1922 dignitaries were invited for a sneak preview of the Theatre. On this night T.W. Barhydt received telegrams from Paramount stars in Hollywood: Bebe Daniels, Gloria Swanson, Rudolph Valentino, Jack Holt, Betty Compton, Wallace Reid, and Adolph Zukor. The Indiana Theatre opened its doors to the public on January 28, 1922. Movie tickets were 25 cents before 6pm and 40 cents after 6pm, a ticket to sit in one of the boxes was 50 cents, and children under 12 were admitted for 10 cents. Theatre staff were dressed for the opening in authentic Spanish attire and live peacocks roamed through the Theatre. A 30 piece orchestra played an overture before the opening silent movie, Cappy Ricks. The first talking movie was shown in the Indiana Theatre on March 13, 1929. The orchestra was directed by Raymond B. Townsley. Old fashioned songs were sung by Jackson Murray and Marion Mills. A fashion show with clothing from Siegel's department store was part of the opening activities. In addition to the movie Cappy Ricks and the Siegel's fashion show, there were five acts of Broadway vaudeville, short subjects, and a prologue. Theodore W. Barhydt The Indiana Theatre at night The Founding President of the Indiana Theatre was T.W. Barhydt. Mr. Barhydt was the driving force to build the Indiana Theatre with family roots in Opera, Theatre and Vaudeville. Mr. Barhydt was prominent in Terre Haute business with ties to the Terre Haute House Hotel, Grand Opera House (1897), Varieties Theatre (1907), Hippodrome Theatre (Terre Haute, Indiana) (Scottish Rite Temple 1916), and Indiana Theatre Corporation (Formed 1920). The Hippodrome is the oldest remaining vaudeville theater in America which was built at the cost of $100,000. John Eberson was the architect and designer of the Hippodrome, TW Barhydt's personal residence, and the Indiana Theatre. Mr. Barhydt built the Indiana Theatre as a gift of appreciation to Terre Haute because he wanted to erase the perception of Terre Haute being a ‚ÄúOne Street Town‚Äù (Wabash Avenue ‚Äì Highway 40). Design Indiana Theatre rotunda Indiana Theatre lobby ballroom Indiana Theatre auditorium The Indiana Theatre was designed to emulate the warmth and carefree lifestyle of Spanish Andalusia and the spirit of its people. The ceiling styles were drawn from Moorish designs with the lobby figurines and other building features influenced by Southern Italy. The Theatre was designed to take visitors through the Lifecycle Of A Day with vibrant daybreak, daytime warmth and mystic nightfall. The Rotunda colors shift from light pastel in the churrigueresque to fierce reds and golds of a sunrise in the railing, leaving the remnants of dawn in the deep burgundys of the dome sky. The Lobby Ballroom simulates the more subdued colors and imagery of daytime to transition visitors from morning to nightfall; 38 male & female statues line both sides and an ornate ceiling with even more faces to fill the lobby with life. The Auditorium represents the mystic mystery of nightfall and guests experience the deep tones of reds, blues, and browns. The original lighting system scattered light across the ceiling with special crystal bulb enclosures to simulate a star field. This is in line with the atmospheric design of the ceiling resembling the open sky. The auditorium was designed without a true balcony; this was intended to make the auditorium reminiscent of a Roman amphitheater built on a hillside. The continuous rise in the seating assured better viewing for all seating. The 6,000 bulb lighting system was greatly hyped prior to the Theatre opening. Lights were rheostatically controlled and could be dimmed to create any color. The opening night program stated ‚Äúthe lighting effects represent in a wonderful manner the Andalusian sunshine in the outer lobbies while one is in the midst of mystic twilight in the main auditorium.‚Äù Originally, the projector was in a glass booth in the center of the auditorium, 78 feet from the screen. There was an intercom system so ushers could communicate with others in the auditorium to check on the availability of seats. Part of the system still exits by the Lobby entrance doors. The Theatre today Significant paint and plasterwork restoration has been completed around the building and 300 theatre seats were removed to make way for a flat terrace in the auditorium. The orchestra pit was also covered, except for a section that will be the future home of an antique Wurlitzer pipe organ console. The terrace and covered orchestra pit provide valuable open floor space to make the auditorium more versatile and capable of table seating. The terrace can accommodate 175 for table seating and the orchestra deck can hold 25. The lobby can accommodate 200. Portable bars are available in the auditorium and lobby as well. Other upgrades include digital projection, a new sound system, and LED atmospheric lighting. Future upgrades include new theatre seats and expansion in other areas of the building to provide more space for events and amenities.

In oils on canvas, it measures 2.80 x 9.52 metres, and is variously dated between about 1630 and 1643.Prado Guide, 409; Harosimowicz; variant titles include: \\"The Beheading of St John the Baptist\\", \\"Herod's Feast\\" (see Fresco), \\"The Banquet of Herod and the Decapitation of John the Baptist\\" ( etc. The Prado's Spanish title is La Degollaci√≥n de San Juan Bautista y el banquete de Herodes and their English one (in the Prado Guide) is The Beheading of St John the Baptist and the Banquet of Herod The painting shows two scenes from the biblical account of the death of John the Baptist. The main part of the painting, on the left, shows the banquet of Herod Antipas at which his daughter Salome produced the head of John the Baptist. The much smaller execution scene is shown on the right hand side, to the right of the column dividing the picture space.Ossowski, 13 The Beheading of John the Baptist had often been combined with the Feast of Herod in this way, with the execution relegated to a different space at the side of the image, a pattern Strobel takes to an extreme. The figures include many portraits of leading figures of the Thirty Years' War, and probably other less well known court figures, not all so far identified, or with agreed identifications. It has been interpreted as an allegorical \\"appeal to the Christian world to save [Strobel's] doomed home country\\" of Silesia, which had suffered greatly from the wars.Harosimowicz Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist, Prado, almost 10 metres wide, this enormous work is probably the masterpiece of Bartholomeus Strobel the Younger Allegory of Europe The military group at the left The painting includes many portraits of leading political and military figures from around Europe, relying on prints for the likenesses of those not known to Strobel. It is probably central to the allegory that the coat of arms of Strobel's home city, now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, which he would have known by its German name of Breslau, includes the image of the head of John the Baptist on a platter. Strobel was forced to leave Breslau by the Thirty Years' War in 1634, finally settling in Poland. Only Herod himself, dressed in oriental costume, reacts strongly to the head produced at the dining table; the other figures seem unconcerned, which may be the point of the allegory.Harosimowicz; Ossowski, 13‚Äì14 Identifications of the figures shown vary.Ossowski, 14‚Äì15; he avoids endorsing any identifications One set, predicated on a date in the early 1640s for the work, is as follows: the figure holding a trumpet at the centre, looking out at the viewer, is the Dutch Admiral Tromp, whose victory at the Battle of the Downs in 1639 had decisively ended Spanish naval power. To his left Henry IV of France (who had died in 1610) pulls at a cloth over a table laid with fruit (so presenting \\"the fruits of victory\\"). The group of men standing in the foreground on the left are the Imperial generalissimo Wallenstein, with the long staff, with behind him his subordinate generals Count Vil√©m Kinsk√Ω, Christian Freiherr von Ilow and Count Adam Erdmann Trcka von Lipa as well as one of their assassins in 1634, the Irish colonel of dragoons Walter Butler of Roscrea. Among the diners at the table are John George I, Elector of Saxony, Charles I of England, the Infanta and from 1637 Empress Maria Anna of Spain (wife of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor), Marie de' Medici, Dowager Queen of France, her favourite Concino Concini (d. 1617), George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (favourite of Charles I until assassinated in 1637), and Marie de Rohan, duchesse de Chevreuse. Herod and the group of ladies The head of John the Baptist on the platter has the features of Duke John Christian of Brieg (d. 1639), the staunch Calvinist champion of Silesian Protestantism. Salome holds the plate, and since her elaborate dress still leaves her implausibly high breasts completely uncovered, she is unlikely to be a portrait of an important figure. To the right of Herod, the group of ladies includes: Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, Queen Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, widow of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (died 1632), with her daughter Christina, Queen of Sweden (only born in 1626) and sister Catherine of Brandenburg, briefly ruler of Transylvania after her husband Gabriel Bethlen, King of Hungary, died in 1629. The boy with the torch in the foreground may be the exiled Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine (born 1617, son of Elizabeth Stuart), who inherited in 1632, and the somewhat lion-like dog in a sitting-up posture may be an illusion to the lions in the arms of the Electorate of the Palatinate as well as those of the Dutch Republic. The lady in the large turban in the row behind may be Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, wife of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, the Dutch stadtholder, who gave the Palatine family refuge in exile. Alternative identifications find a portrait of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, and identify the features of John the Baptist as those of Charles I of England, although he was not beheaded until 1649, which is probably well after Strobel painted the work.Prado Catalogo, 377 Style Detail of the left end of the table. The depiction of the standing figures at front varies, and the two boys wear Polish styles of costume. The style of the figures in the Prado painting varies between realistic portraiture, generalized and idealized faces, especially among the females, and expressive caricature, with the three types often mixed in a single group. The costumes of many figures are painted in great detail and with precision, but the fashions shown vary from French styles of the 1630s to those of Poland, with some purely fanciful elements. The two boys with candles in front of the left end of the table wear Polish styles, from the distinctive szkofia three-plumed hat badge of the right-hand one (held at his waist) to the boots of the one at left, who looks to be a portrait.Ossowski, 13‚Äì14, 17, 19; Prado Guide, 409 He also wears a curved Polish or Hungarian type of szabla (sabre). Behind the two boys is a figure of uncertain gender wearing the modified Roman military uniform typically worn by goddesses and allegorical figures in Northern Mannerism; there is a similar figure at the front of the Munich Feast. This mixture, both as to the depiction of faces and of clothing, is reminiscent of many northern religious paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries, especially those showing the Passion of Jesus. There are reminiscences of the fantastical style of the printmaker Jacques Bellange, another artist whose homeland of Lorraine was to be ravaged by the war. One critic finds the \\"blurred edges, eclecticism, mixed registers and parodic deflation of late Renaissance poetry are mirrored in Mannerist painting, from Jacques Bellange to Bartholomeus Strobel\\".Rogers, Hoyt, The poetics of inconstancy: Etienne Durand and the end of Renaissance verse, p. 221, 1998, University of North Carolina, , 9780807892602 Despite its late date, Strobel's work remains rooted in the Rudolfine Northern Mannerism of Prague which he had absorbed in his youth.Ossowski, 22 History The date of the painting and the circumstances of its commission remain unclear. To some extent these questions are tied to the identification of the portrait figures, in particular those of the boys or youths, as their appearances relate to a narrow time period. According to Harosimowicz, the source used for identifying the figures above, the painting \\"was probably created in Elbing under the patronage of Gerhard and Margaretha von D√∂nhoff in the period from 1640 to 1642\\". The D√∂nhoff family were wealthy German Protestant aristocrats in Silesia, who were also becoming integrated into the Polish nobility.Harosimowicz; for Gerhard D√∂nhoff (1590‚Äì1648), Governor of Pomerania and administrator of Marienburg for the Polish crown, see :pl:Gerard Denhoff (syn) and Schlesien in der Fr√ºhmoderne, by Norbert Conrads. He was the brother of Kasper Doenhoff and Ernst Magnus D√∂nhoff, of a Baltic German family who had joined the Polish nobility. In 1637 D√∂nhoff married Margaretha, the daughter of Duke John Christian of Brieg, whose features may be depicted on the head of John the Baptist. Another suggestion for the patron (but with similar dating) is King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa of Poland (r. 1632‚Äì1649), who had appointed Strobel court artist in 1639.Jagiello The king's half-brother Karol Ferdynand Vasa, Prince-Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau), whose court painter Strobel had previously been before he left Breslau in about 1633, has also been suggested, with an earlier dating to 1630‚Äì33, as used by the Prado (thus preceding Wallenstein's assassination). Only the Prince-Bishop's coat of arms are shown in the painting, and it may have been at his palace at Nysa.Ossowski, 21; Prado biography; Prado Guide, 409 The Alte Pinakothek, Munich Feast of Herod, now attributed to Strobel By 1746 the painting was in the Spanish Royal Collection, belonging to Elisabeth Farnese, Queen to Philip V of Spain, and hung in \\"the room where their Majesties eat\\" in the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, which Philip had built in the 1720s as a summer palace in the mountains near Madrid. Philip had died that year, and his successor Ferdinand VI of Spain had granted the palace and its contents to his step- mother. In the year of her death in 1766 it was still inventoried at La Granja, but in 1794 and 1818 it was recorded at the newer Royal Palace of Aranjuez.Prado page Once in the Prado with the rest of the Spanish royal collection it was for long not on public display. In the 2000s, with the remodelling around the construction of a new wing to the rear, gallery space was found for the painting, which now greets visitors who entered by the new wing as they emerge from the lifts on the main floor in the old building.The space (room 11b) is not numbered on the museum plan, but is between rooms 11 and 26. The painting was long vaguely attributed to an unknown Flemish artist, with suggestions that Joachim von Sandrart, Hendrik Goltzius or Bartholomeus Spranger might be responsible, or an unknown artist from Lorraine or Augsburg. The first attribution to Strobel was made in 1970 by Jaromir Neumann, which was confirmed by Lode Seghers in 1987, on stylistic comparison with a David and Bathsheba signed by Strobel, now in Wallenstein's former castle at Mnichovo Hradi≈°tƒõ, Czech Republic.Ossowski, 14‚Äì16; Prado Catalogo, 377; Fresco Subsequent comparisons with other documented works by Strobel have confirmed the attribution, which now seems generally accepted.Ossowski, 16‚Äì19 Munich version On the basis of the Prado identification another Feast of Herod in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, far smaller at 95 x 73 cm, was also attributed to Strobel, probably with an earlier date. This \\"extremely fascinating, involved and mysterious picture\\" shares many characteristics with the Prado's work, also containing portraits of political and military leaders, mixture of styles, and a complex picture space, with in this case the main feast in the upper background seen through columns. It had previously been attributed to Jacques Bellange among others.Alte Pinakotek, 523-524, 523 quoted; rather oddly Ossowski does not mention this work. Suggested subjects for portraits in the work include Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, who from 1610 until he died of his wounds in 1632 was the Imperial and Catholic League field marshal before Wallenstein, and commander at the notorious Sack of Magdeburg in 1631. He may be the figure to the left behind the balustrade. The man reading to his right may also be a portrait. The \\"richly attired man with a pointed beard\\" at the right hand side of the dining table above may be Gabor Bethlen (d 1629), the Calvinist Prince of Transylvania and Protestant claimant to be King of Hungary, leader of the Hungarian anti-Habsburg forces in the war. His widow Catherine of Brandenburg may be one of the ladies portrayed in the Prado version.Alte Pinakotek, 524 Stroebel's Daniel and Cyrus before the Idol Bel (1636‚Äì1637) in the National Museum, Warsaw is a similar composition, with the figures in eclectic and extravagant costumes, and a feast seen in progress at a lower level in the background. It is still smaller at 39.5 √ó 30 cm (15.6 √ó 11.8 in), and in oil on copper.

Housing 13 monks, it later received donations from Oliba Cabreta (whose sarcophagus lies here) and his brother Mir√≥. A new church built in 1077 was consecrated in 1126. In the fourteenth century, while only six monks were living there, the bell tower was destroyed but was rebuilt under the abbot Berenguer de Llu√ß√† in 1373. The monastery later came under the authority of the Bishop of Urgell. The church was rebuilt in the Neoclassical style between 1798 and 1827. The monastery was also transformed in the Neoclassical style by the architect Josep Torrevedella, the work being completed in 1793. The buildings suffered considerable damage during the Spanish Civil War that destroyed several monastic dependencies.

Coastal meadows are meadows in the coastal zone, influenced by the sea. Under this definition, the salinity of the air and wind is usually high and the flora is dominated by salt-tolerant species. Some coastal meadows may be flooded by seawater occasionally, increasing the demands on the flora even further. These conditions however, do not make a meadow. To be categorized as a meadow in the first place, the plantgrowth has to be low in height, and normally this can only be achieved from wear by general traffic or grazing of the landscape (artificially or by livestock). Coastal meadows are therefore usually thought of as cultural landscapes or biotopes, requiring some degree of intervention and not being able to sustain themselves on their own. If left alone, coastal meadows would often transform into a transitional meadow and eventually a shrubby or bushy seashore habitat. Depending on the geology, climate and local conditions, coastal meadows can take on different expressions, with their own specific ecology. The main subcategories are: * Beach meadows * Fell meadows Coastal meadows can be found all over the world, where grazing is practised near the coast and in some places they emerge as natural landscapes.

In 1962, Marvin became an original board member, along with another Minden attorney, Luther Moore, and later Caddo Parish Sheriff Don Hathaway, of the Louisiana Tech Foundation. In 1990, the LSU Law Center named Marvin an honorary member of the Order of the Coif and inducted him into its hall of fame. In 1956, Marvin married the former Rebecca Campbell (born September 1935) of Minden and began his practice of law there with the firm Campbell, Campbell and Marvin, later Campbell, Campbell, Marvin, and Johnson.

In 1973, DA Marvin pursued originally fourteen counts of public bribery against George Nattin, who stepped down as mayor of Bossier City after twelve years in office, and Nattin's son, George Nattin, Jr. Former Mayor Nattin was subsequently acquitted of the charges. In 1974, Marvin was the DA when rodeo star Jack Favor received a second trial in the 26th Judicial District Court after evidence surfaced that Favor's first murder trial in 1967, when he was prosecuted by DA Padgett, had a rigged outcome. A federal judge granted Favor a new trial on the premise that Judge O. E. Price and DA Padgett had in the first trial illegally conspired to convict Favor. Favor, this time represented by the Bossier City attorney James B. Wells, quickly won acquittal in the second trial. Not long thereafter, Marvin resigned as DA upon his election to the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal, based in Shreveport. Marvin defeated a fellow Democrat, Fred W. Jones, Jr., a native of Rayville in Richland Parish and a then district judge in Ruston.\\"Jones will seek judgeship\\", Minden Press-Herald, April 2, 1975, p. 1 In the nine-parish race, Marvin polled 16,106 votes; Jones, 14,521.

Welborn Ayres, a native of Natchitoches Parish, who retired at the mandatory age of seventy-five.Minden Press-Herald, May 15, 1975, p. 1 Jones was subsequently elected to the circuit court in 1980 and became a colleague of Judge Marvin for the next decade. Thereafter, Marvin was elected to full ten-year terms on the court in 1978 and 1988, both times without opposition. From 1990 until his retirement in 1999, Marvin was the chief judge of the circuit court. He was frequently invited to serve as a pro tempore justice for the Louisiana Supreme Court. He was also a president of the Council of Chief Judges of the United States. He was the author of numerous law review articles and served as an adjunct professor at the LSU Law Center, the historically black Grambling State University, and Bossier Parish Community College. For six terms, he was president of the Webster Parish Bar Association. He was a member of the National Trial Lawyers Association. Judge Marvin was along with bail bondsman Angelo Roppolo and others one of the founding members of the Shreveport Red Mass Society, which holds an annual service for lawyers, judges, and law enforcement personnel to highlight the connection between faith in God and the rule of law. The Red Mass is held at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in downtown Shreveport. Personal life and legacy Judge Marvin was a trustee and Sunday School teacher at the Minden First United Methodist Church. He was also a trustee of the Louisiana Methodist Foundation. He was a member of the Masonic lodge and the Shriners. There are four Marvin children. Melissa Brown (born 1958) is the wife of Gary Lamar Brown (born 1954), whose parents, Newton and Erlene Nealy Brown, were murdered in their home in Dixie Inn west of Minden on Christmas Eve, 1982, by Jimmy Glass and Jimmy Wingo. The murders occurred only a few months after Melissa and Gary Brown were wed in Minden. The tragic case attracted national attention because of an upswing in executions in Louisiana at the time and a debate over the constitutionality of the death penalty. Second daughter Michele Simoneaux and her husband, Rodney J. Simoneaux (both born 1959), reside in Belle Rose in Assumption Parish in south Louisiana. Son John Schuyler Marvin is the husband of the former Jodi Lane Comeaux. The youngest Marvin daughter, Mary Margaret, is the wife of Bruce Johnson. There were twelve grandchildren at the time of the judge's death. Schuyler Marvin is the current DA of Bossier and Webster parishes, having first been elected in November 2002, some five months before his father's death. He was unopposed for a second six-year term in 2008. The junior Marvin is a Democrat-turned- Republican. Judge Marvin died of cancer at the age of seventy-three. Services were held on April 29, 2003, at First United Methodist Church in Minden. He is interred at Gardens of Memory Cemetery.

It is an active United Reformed Church, and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The church was designed by J. Lomax-Simpson and built in 1906‚Äì07 for Lord Leverhulme. It is in Neo-Norman style, reflecting Lord Leverhulme's Nonconformity. Architecture Exterior St George's is constructed in sandstone with stone-slate roofs. The church has a cruciform plan consisting of a five-bay nave, north and south transepts, a chancel with an apse and a north porch, a south vestry, and a tower over the crossing. All the windows are round-headed; the windows along the sides of the church and at the west end have three lights, and those at the east end have two. The windows in the transepts are paired, with a round window above. At the west end are two gabled porches with round-headed entrances. The tower has angle buttresses, and in the bell stage are two-light bell openings and blind arcading. On top of the tower is a corbelled parapet and a recessed pyramidal roof. To the southeast of the tower is an octagonal stair turret with blind arcading and a pyramidal roof. Interior The interior of the church is richly and elaborately decorated, the sculptor being Edward O. Griffith. His work includes the capitals, which are decorated with biblical scenes. The altar contains a frieze, roundels, and arcading with marble columns. The wooden altar rail was carved by Hatch of Lancaster, and contains columns, all of which are different. Both the pulpit and the font are in Caen stone, and are Norman in style. The pews are decorated with cable moulding. The stained glass in the apse windows dates from 1926 and is by Burlison and Grylls. In the windows on the south of the church is glass by Hardman & Co. dated 1907, and by Heaton, Butler and Bayne from about 1919. The two-manual pipe organ was made in 1907 by Norman and Beard. External features At the southwest corner of the churchyard is a hexagonal covered entranceway. This was also designed by Lomax-Simpson, built in 1906‚Äì07, and constructed in sandstone with a stone-slate roof. It has Neo-Norman detailing. There is a round-headed arch on each side, with buttresses, two gargoyles, and a parapet on a corbel table. It has a pyramidal roof. Inside is a ribbed dome with a central boss carved with a dragon.

A paraplegic as a result of an accident when she was 14, she picked up tennis as a wheelchair player following it. She has gone on to represent Spain at the 2004 Summer Paralympics, 2008 Summer Paralympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics, and the 2013 World Championships. In 2013, she was ranked 61st in the world.  Personal  Ochoa was born on October 4, 1978 in Valencia. She has paraplegia as a result of an accident when she was 14 years old. She has an undergraduate degree in business management from a Spanish university. In 2004, she lived in Valencia and was working as a financial manager. In August 2012, she attended a conference organised by Groupama Seguro in Madrid. The group was one of the main sponsors for the Spanish Paralympic Committee in the lead up to the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Alongside several other Paralympians, she presented on athlete preparations for the Games. In 2013, she was working for SabadellCAM.  Wheelchair tennis  Ochoa took up wheelchair tennis when she was a 16-year-old. She originally chose tennis as a young girl because relatives were involved in it on an amateur level. Following the accident, she looked at the sport more seriously after connecting with the Federation of Adapted Sports Valencia. When she first started playing, she used her everyday chair to play wheelchair tennis. It lacked maneuverability and was not always easy to handle. At times, she also had problems finding facilities where she could play. While the situation has improved for her because of improvements in Spain, she does not have the same type of access that players from the United States, Japan and the Netherlands have. By 2013, there is greater acceptance of and normalization of the idea that she belongs on the court. Ochoa has belonged to the Avant tennis club, and has been sponsored by PlusUltra and Groupama Insurance. She is a right handed player. In the IWTF 1998 year end rankings, Ochoa was 55th in the women's singles. In the IWTF 1999 year end rankings, she was 40th in the women's singles and 38th in the doubles. In the IWTF 2000 year end rankings, she was 37th in the women's singles and 93rd in the doubles. In the IWTF 2002 year end rankings, she was 53rd in the women's singles. In the IWTF 2003 year end rankings, she was 29th in the women's singles and 42nd in the doubles. Ochoa competed at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece. She was able to qualify for the Games because of changes to the selection process. Qualification was based on IWTF rankings as opposed to having spots available on a by country level where she had to compete against Spanish men and other women for a spot on the Spanish team. She went out in the singles competition in the round of 32 against Japanese player Chiyoko Ohmae with scores of 2‚Äì6 and 1‚Äì6. Playing with Barbara Vidal in the doubles, they lost to a pair from Switzerland by scores of 3‚Äì6 and 0‚Äì6. Following the Athens Games, she dedicated herself more fully to the game. Ochoa competed at the 2008 Summer Paralympics. She lost to Sharon Walraven of the Netherlands in the round of 32 by 2‚Äì6 and 1‚Äì6. Following the Beijing Games, she took a brief break from the sport to reflect on life. In 2010, she had surgery in June and November that hindered her ability to compete. Her performance during the 2011 season was such that for a time, she was the third ranked female player domestically in Spain. She finished out the 2011 Spanish season as the Spanish women's champion. In April 2012, she was ranked 14th in the world in women's singles. In June 2012, she was ranked 17th in the world in doubles. She competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. She lost to Kgothatso Montjane 7‚Äì5 and 6‚Äì2 in the round of 32. At the time, Montjane was ranked tenth in the world. Turkey hosted the 2013 World Championships in which Ribes was one of five members of the Spanish team. Prior to the start of the competition, she was ranked second in Spain and 61st internationally. In 2013, she was hoping she could qualify for the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. In 2013, she had 16 singles wins and 6 losses. She had 12 doubles wins in 2013 and 6 doubles losses. As of December 2013, she has 164 career singles wins and 87 career losses.

The pump station and associated works were first constructed by private interests in the 1880s to provide a reliable water supply for the burgeoning resort areas of Tisbury as well as the port of Vineyard Haven. The facilities were taken over by the town in the early 20th century, after which some alterations were made to accommodate technological improvements. Followinga series of hurricanes in the mid-20th century, which highlighted the risks of the station's location and ability to provide reliable drinking water, the town abandoned the facility. Since then it has been largely abandoned, although it was used in the 1990s by a bottled water interest, and some work has been done to preserve the Late Victorian main pumping station building. History The town of Tisbury, Massachusetts occupies the West Chop portion of the island of Martha's Vineyard. It is separated from neighboring West Tisbury by a line including Lake Tashmoo, a saltwater lake on the western side of the chop, and a freshwater spring that fed the lake. The Tisbury area was settled in the 17th century, and has since then been home to the island's major port, Vineyard Haven. The northern reaches of West Chop were used for agriculture well into the 19th century. Interest in developing the area as a summer resort began in the 1870s with several failed proposals, but began in a serious way in the 1880s with the establishment of the West Chop Land Company. Financial interests in that company, seeking a reliable water supply for the growing development, formed the Vineyard Haven Water Company in 1886. This company purchased of land, including Tashmoo Spring and lakefront on Lake Tashmoo, and in 1887 constructed a steam-powered pumping station at a cost of $48.300. It was the island's first water pumping station. The pumping station was powered by two steam engines, and drew water from the lake. It was delivered by a series of pipes to the new development at West Chop, and to Vineyard Haven, where it supplied water for a few fire hydrants and private homes. It was relatively quickly found to be inadequate for the needs of water supply and of fire prevention, and the private company was criticized for its high rates. The town took over the facility from the company in 1905 by eminent domain. Between 1905 and 1931 the town expanded the capacity of the system, and introduced new technology to improve its reliability, building an addition onto the main station in 1907. The facility was converted from steam power to electricity in 1919, necessitating further alterations to the plant to accommodate new equipment. In 1932 a major hurricane breached the sandbar that separate Lake Tashmoo from the Atlantic Ocean. This increased the salinity of the water in the lake, and highlighted to the town the risks of the facility's location to its water supply. It consequently constructed a dike to isolate a portion of upper end of the lake from saltwater incursion. This dike was breached by a hurricane 1944, introducing salt water into the station's intake well. Hurricane Carol in 1954 swamped the pumphouse, disabling the equipment. By this time the town had already begun seeking alternatives to the Tashmoo Spring supply, and a new well was able to supply the town during the outage. The town stopped using the Tashmoo Spring facility as its primary water supply in 1971. After that the facilities fell into decline. They were briefly revived in the 1980s by a private interest that sold Tashmoo Spring Bottled Water until 1999. The town has since then taken steps to restore the main pumping station's roof, and has placed a preservation restriction on the building. of land area, encompassing the surviving elements of the water works, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

The building dates to the late 15th century and has been in use as Walloon church since 1586. Every Sunday at 11 a.m. church services are held here in French. The church is also used for concerts and music recordings. It is known for its excellent acoustics. The building has held rijksmonument status since 1970.\\"Monumentnummer: 50 - Oude Walenkerk, Walenpleintje 159 1012 JZ te Amsterdam\\", Monumentenregister, Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed (Dutch) The painter Bartholomeus van der Helst (1613-1670) and the scientist Jan Swammerdam (1637-1680) are interred in the church. Elizabeth Timothy (1702-1757), the first female American newspaper editor and publisher, was most likely christened there. The painter Vincent van Gogh visited the church regularly in the 1870s to attend sermons delivered by his uncle Johannes Paulus Stricker. The church was also known as the Franse Kerk (\\"French Church\\"), Walenkerk (\\"Walloons' Church\\"), Oude Walenkerk (\\"Old Walloons' Church\\"), or Oude Waalse Kerk (\\"Old Walloon Church\\"). History The Walloon Church was originally the chapel of a Roman Catholic monastery, the Sint- Paulusbroederklooster. The monastery's first chapel was built in 1409 but most likely destroyed during the fire of 1452. In 1493, the monastery received permission to build a new chapel, which was taken into use three years later. Following the 1578 Alteratie (the Protestant Reformation in Amsterdam), the chapel was confiscated by the city government. It was used as a storeroom and for various other purposes until 1586, when it was offered to the Walloon Reformed community of religious refugees, French-speaking Protestants who had fled religious persecution in the Southern Netherlands and France. It was one of a large number of Walloon churches established in the Dutch Republic during this period ‚Äî at least fifteen in the period 1571-1590 alone. In 1616, a new entrance was added on the north side of the church, with a gate designed by city architect Hendrick de Keyser. The gate, which gave access to Oude Hoogstraat street, was decorated with skulls, a nod to the funeral processions which passed through this gate. The front gate of the church, in Classical style, dates to 1647. The church, consisting of a central nave and a northern semitransept, was extended in 1661 with a southern semitransept. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 led to another wave of Protestant refugees from France, greatly swelling the Walloon community in Amsterdam. In order to accommodate the larger community, the church was extended with galleries on three sides. The church nevertheless proved too small, so a second church was opened in a disused bell foundry on Prinsengracht canal in 1716. The Walloon church was subsequently known as the Oude Waalse Kerk (\\"Old Walloon Church\\") or Grande √âglise (\\"Great Church\\") to distinguish it from the second church, known as the Nieuwe Waalse Kerk (\\"New Walloon Church\\") of Petite √âglise (\\"Lesser Church\\"). The church underwent further renovations in 1816 and 1891, among others, during which the galleries were again removed. In 1990-1992, the church was restored, whereby the foundations were restored to stop the church from sinking, caused by the front facade installed in 1885. During this restoration, so many tombstones were found that a decision was made to replace the concrete floor with a new, self-supporting floor with its own foundation. The balcony was also restored. The small square in front of the church, known colloquially as the Walenpleintje (\\"Little Walloon Square\\"), was officially given this name in 1976. The address of the church is Walenpleintje 159, as the street numbering still follows that of the Oudezijds Achterburgwal canal. A plaque in the northern semitransept of the church carries the French inscription Fond√©e en 1409; Restaur√©e en 1647; Agrandie en 1661; Reb√¢tie en 1816; Restaur√©e en 1891 par le troupeau Wallon et par ceux qui s'int√©ressent √† son culte; Restaur√©e, amelior√©e et renov√©e en 1991 et 1992. Gunshots in the church On 12 October 1755, a French baker's assistant entered the church during services and fired several rifle shots at the vicar. The baker's servant had fallen in love with the daughter of a rich merchant, far above his station, and the girl's father had requested that the vicar put an end to the love affair, which had infuriated the baker's servant. The vicar was only grazed by a bullet, but was so startled that he fell backwards. The door of the pulpit had not been properly shut, causing the vicar to fall down the stairs leading up to the pulpit. The fall left him with a severe head injury, but he survived and recovered from his injuries. The baker's assistant tried to flee the scene, but was arrested and locked away in the Rasphuis prison for a number of years. The incident left a number of bullet holes in the pulpit and the adjacent pillar. These were however hidden during the 1990 restoration. Organ The church received its first pipe organ in 1680, built by the Ghent organ builder Nicolaas Langlez. This organ however proved unsatisfactory and was frequently altered until Christian M√ºller was commissioned in 1733 to build an entirely new organ, which was taken into use the next year. This organ is still in use and is considered the best-preserved of the M√ºller organs still in existence. In subsequent years the organ was repeatedly repaired and altered, until the church in 1960 decided to restore the organ to its original state. This restoration by organ builders Ahrend & Brunzema was completed in 1965, followed by a second restoration in 1993 and a third in the year 2000. Orphanage The Walloon Church in 1631 purchased three buildings on Laurierstraat in the Jordaan district of Amsterdam and opened an orphanage there. Not only orphans but also widows and elderly were housed there. In 1683 the orphanage was moved to a building on Vijzelgracht canal, which remained in use as an orphanage until 1967. The building now houses French cultural center Institut fran√ßais des Pays-Bas.

The album was released on August 26, 2014, by Linear Labs. The album features guest appearances from Busta Rhymes, William Hart, Snoop Dogg and Scarub. Background In a July 2013, interview on Hip-Hop Nation, the album's producer Adrian Younge announced the album, saying: \\"The next project is Adrian Younge Presents Souls of Mischief. That‚Äôs my next big thing and I‚Äôm super happy about that. It‚Äôs a project that if somebody misses the sounds of 93 'til Infinity meets The Low End Theory meets De La Soul Is Dead. If somebody misses that kind of sound, they‚Äôll be happy to hear this album because it goes back to that time, you know. Kind of like how the Ghostface album [12 Reasons To Die] kind of went back to that time. And I love both styles of music back then, so I‚Äôm very, very excited.\\" He continued: \\"And it‚Äôs also a concept album too ‚Äî Souls of Mischief almost gets killed by some dude that was just crazy and the whole album just starts off with this incident, and then it blossoms into these different stories that are a result of this volatile incident. And that‚Äôs basically what that album is about. It‚Äôs dope though. It‚Äôs really dope. As far as stylistically, it‚Äôs kind of like if Bob James and Herbie Hancock recorded with Q-Tip back in the day, you know what I‚Äôm saying. That‚Äôs the perspective on the album. I was with Ali Shaheed Muhammad yesterday showing him some of the stuff and he was totally getting it because he‚Äôs going to be the narrator on this album, like how RZA was sort of the narrator for Ghost [on 12 Reasons], that‚Äôs what Shaheed‚Äôs going to be doing. It‚Äôs Native Tongues shit, you know what I‚Äôm saying, so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm super psyched about. I mean it‚Äôs done now; I‚Äôm just touching stuff up. But it‚Äôs pretty much done. It‚Äôs going to be released in September.\\" In an August 2014 interview with PopMatters, he spoke about how he produced the album, saying: \\"You‚Äôre doing it over the course of an album, so you have to understand what the different moods are throughout the album and once you understand those points of progress within the story are you compositionally illustrate music that denotes that feeling. So there‚Äôs one part where everybody‚Äôs panicking‚Äîthat song‚Äôs actually called \\"Panic Struck\\"‚Äîso I wanted to make something that feels kind of jarring and pervasive, in your face, temperamental. Then there's a song about love so I want something that feels like love, there's a song where there's a finale closing out the whole story, the whole plot line. So I want to make it seem like a chase scene to the end. So it all depends on what's going on because I'm a film composer first, so I like to approach my music cinematically.\\" He spoke about if there were songs on the album that were difficult to produce, saying: \\"Yes, there was a lot of difficulty because I always try to outdo myself. So I set very high standards because I kind of want to be an exemplary example of who I should be as an artist. I always compare myself to what I did last, so I‚Äôve got to try and beat what I did last I‚Äôm always upping my own bar. It‚Äôs one of those things that creates a lot of difficulty just for myself, but it‚Äôs the kind of difficulty I need to embrace because it makes me a better artist. And I do not want to be one of those artists that falls off later, I want to be one of those artists that is continually pushing the bar. But going back to certain songs on the album that were more difficult than others, I would say. There‚Äôs a song called \\"Miriam Got a Mickey\\" that was pretty difficult, there's a song called \\"Ghetto Superhero\\" that wasn't that easy. I mean there's a lot of... it all ranges. A lot of it is just, you know everything I do is samples. It's tape, analog, hardware, hand crafted music and soul. It's not just creating a loop; every single thing has to be done by hand. A lot of it is just tedious.\\" Critical response There Is Only Now received positive reviews from music critics. Homer Johnsen of HipHopDX said, \\"Philosophically, the message on There Is Only Now is an intelligent one, as is the case with most things Hiero. Part of the experience is hearing the story as it unfolds, but at the same time, the Souls of Mischief are dealing with concepts like the Theory of Relativity, and experiencing life while being fully present. Like the album itself, the cast of guest appearances is minimal, yet praiseworthy for its originality. Busta Rhymes and Scarub (Living Legends) portray Womack and Stoney, two characters in the story, while Snoop Dogg supplies some wisdom of his own on the title-track. The seamless listen from beginning to end, and the intricacy of the story itself make it almost possible to listen to There Is Only Now just once.\\" Kevin Jones of Exclaim! stated, \\"Fresh, crisp drums, creamy keys, luxuriant strings and timely flute and horn flourishes, each held together by a series of mood-defining bass lines, work to soundtrack this production, an inspiring foil that the record's MCs make certain not to waste on this grand testament to Souls' skill and staying power.\\" Sheldon Pearce of XXL said, \\"With There Is Only Now, Souls of Mischief turn out a prize just short of a solid masterpiece. It tremors along steadily, churning out consistently good but not great mini narratives, and it does so with flair but with little change of pace. Still, it is the realization of an ambitious idea seen through to its conclusion, and it is an exceptional attempt to push rap to its limits as a medium.\\" Track listing *All tracks produced by Adrian Younge.

It has a mixture of rural and maritime interest, with views of the River Medway and River Thames. In 2005, the RSPB worked with Medway Council to establish the route on the Hoo Peninsula. Route Starting points can be anywhere along the route, but Higham Railway Station is normally used. Then a clockwise route is taken. The trail takes its name from the RSPB 'Northward Hill Reserve' in High Halstow, which the route passes by. The trail heads down 'Lower Rochester Road', then down 'Two Gates Hill' to the crossroads hamlet of 'Mockbeggar'. It takes 'Bunter's Hill Road' to Noke Street, then 'Higham Road' before turning away from Wainscott and heading along 'Islingham Farm Road' and 'Woodfield Way' to Chattenden. Here it passes the Royal School of Military Engineering (RSME). It takes 'Upchat Road' to Beacon Hill. It crosses over the A228 'Four Elms Hill' before leaving 'National Cycle Route 1' and becoming Regional route 18 which heads up the A228 through another section of Chattenden. It then takes 'Main Road Chattenden' to the village of Hoo St Werburgh. It then takes 'Stoke Road' towards Kingsnorth. But it then breaks left onto 'Roper's Lane' heading back towards the A228 (Ratcliffe Highway). It then takes 'Sharnal Street' towards the street lined hamlet, before crossing over the A228 to take 'Christmas Lane' to High Halstow. After passing St Margaret church in High Halstow, the Heron trail takes 'Cooling Road' to Bromhey Farm (used by the RSPB). 'Then Lipwell Hill' to 'Main Road' leading to Cooling. It then passes 'Cooling Castle' and 'Cooling Castle Barn' and heads along 'Cooling Road' again. It then turns right onto 'Common Lane' to head to Cliffe. It heads along 'Reed Street' in the village towards St Helen's church in Cliffe. Then it heads west via 'Buttway Lane', before turning left onto 'West Street' (confusingly heading North-south!) to 'Buckland Road'. Here it passes the large quarry works and then passes over the Gravesend to Grain railway (carrying freight only). Buckland Road carries on around the edge of Cliffe Woods village.

History Fred Cleary Frederick Ernest Cleary (1905-1984) CBE, who was originally a Chartered Surveyor from Crouch End, London. Later, he formed a very successful company ‚ÄòHaslemere Estates‚Äô, who refurbished many of the City of London‚Äôs fine old buildings during the 70's and 80's. In 1970, he formed the Bay Trust to 'preserving the natural environment in the proximity of St. Margaret‚Äôs Bay and undertaking related environmental education initiatives'. This was due to his work in inner London, where he created green and restful spaces in the City, often on the site of bomb damaged sites. His philanthropic activities and his writing of two books ‚ÄòBeauty and the Borough‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Flowering City‚Äô, resulting in him earning the nickname ‚ÄòFlowering Fred‚Äô. In 1975 Fred purchased and refurbished an old rectory building ('Ripple Down House') in Ringwould. This became an environmental education centre for children. 'Alistair Gould', the founder‚Äôs grandson is on the current trust. Garden The Bay Trust bought the house and the gardens in 1960s. Edda Jones, an artist, was staying in the house, while the Trust added to the garden before they opened it to the public But later the cottage would be demolished as it was not energy inefficient and could not be converted. The trust then opened the garden to the public. The garden has many features including a waterfall and adjoining lake, a grass labyrinth and an organic kitchen garden with around 40 different species of fruit and vegetables. The garden has been run organically since 2002. Due to the ethos of the Trust management, who wish to work in harmony with nature and this includes recycling, composting and uses natural predators to control pests The garden also has a statue of Winston Churchill by Oscar Nemon. The garden also hosts many projects by contemporary artists. The Calyx Centre The Calyx Centre Note: Calyx means \\"husk\\" or \\"pod\\" and the centre is pod shaped. Built on the demolished site of the original bungalow of the garden. The conference centre (built to passiv-haus standards) was designed, by a collaborative team of 'Helionix Designs' (architect \\"Alistair Gould\\"), Structural Engineer \\"Cameron Taylor\\" (now part of Scott Wilson Group)and 'Conker Conservation'. The Bay Trust and designers are all members of the 'Carbon Free Group'. It has pneumatic rammed chalk walls (maximum thickness of 650mm). Its domed roof (Catalan vault) uses techniques patented by Spanish-American architect Rafael Guastavino in 1885. 'Rings of local clay tiles are glued together with fast setting gypsum plaster to form a self-supporting dome that is constantly in a state of compression'. The project was completed in Autumn 2006. Total embodied energy of the building is calculated to be 299 MJ/m2, while embodied carbon is 33 kg CO2/m2. This is compared to 1393 MJ/m2 and 147 kg CO2/m2 for a similar concrete building shell. The result is a venue that achieves savings of 66% in target energy consumption and 67% in target CO2 emissions. Hot water is supplied via solar thermal panels, while a small woodchips-fed biomass generator produces heat for an underfloor heating system if additional warmth is required. Water management is also another essential part of the design. The water supply comes from a sustainably managed bore-hole with all rainwater run-off feeding back into this supply. Grey and black water is fed through a reed bed filter and the resulting cleaned water is then can be used to feed the Pines Garden plants. It claims to be the first conference building in Europe to reach beyond carbon neutral and become carbon negative. It also has a grass roof. The venue is available for private hire and gained a licence for wedding and other ceremonies. St. Margaret‚Äôs Museum St. Margaret‚Äôs Museum and The Pines Garden Tea Room are located at Pines Garden. The museum features changing displays about local history including St Margaret‚Äôs during WW2, and one-time resident No√´l Coward. Other topics focus on area natural history and the environment.

Background Smith was either a native of Bastrop in Morehouse Parish in northeast Louisiana or Springhill in northernmost Webster Parish near the Arkansas state line. According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, she graduated from Springhill High School and attended Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia. However, the Minden Press-Herald reported that she did not move to Springhill until 1957, when she was about twenty-five years of age and therefore would not have graduated from Springhill High School.\\"Funeral services Saturday for state education leader\\", Minden Press-Herald, August 9, 1990, p. 1 Political life A Democrat, Smith in the summer of 1970 defeated two opponents to win a seat on the Webster Parish School Board, an institution on which she served for the following sixteen years.\\"Dorothy G.

Smith died in Schumpert Medical Center in Shreveport of a heart attack while undergoing treatment for leukemia. She was fifty-eight at the time of her death. Roemer called Smith \\"a woman of great courage even in the face of debilitating illness. She continued to dedicate her life to the children.\\" Walter C. Lee of Shreveport, the Caddo Parish school superintendent, won Smith's seat on the BESE board in a special election held on March 23, 1991. Lee prevailed with 15,161 votes (58.9 percent). Republican Sandra Worley Long trailed with 7,128 (27.7 percent), and a second Democrat, Eliot S. Knowles, Jr., held 3,460 votes (13.4 percent). Lee carried majorities or pluralities in all nine parishes in the district. After twenty-three years, Lee resigned from the board in 2015 as its longest-tenured member.

He lost that position in the 1983 general election. There are three surviving Smith sons, Michael B. Smith, Gerald Garrett Smith, and Timothy Lane Smith. She was a member of Central Baptist Church in Springhill. She is interred at Springhill Cemetery. The Smiths sued two physicians, Wallace Harold Brown (1913-1999) and John D. Gladney, for medical malpractice in the death of Dorothy Garrett Smith. She died during a surgical procedure. The proceedings dragged on until 1999, when the case was dismissed. Gerald B. Smith died during the course of the suit. The Smith sons subsequently sued their attorneys, John B. Slattery, Jr., and James Johnson, for allegedly allowing the time to lapse in the proceedings and not informing them of developments in the legal process. In 2004, the Louisiana Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit in Shreveport dismissed the Smiths' case.

Religious services were held in the homes of sponsoring families. For Gurpurb and community events, devotees went to Gurdwaras in Georgia and North Carolina to perform ceremonies or attend Gurpurb. Professionals and businessmen in the community were inspired to plan a Gurdwara and engage community leaders in 1990. Architect Rene Mangat provided architectural plans for the first 60‚Äô X 60‚Äô building as sewa. This triggered the donation drive, putting more energy in the project. The Executive Committee represented Upstate, Midlands and the Low Country in SC. A constitution was developed and the Sikh Religious Society of South Carolina was established and registered with the Secretary of State as a tax exempt Religious institution. This tract of 3.64 acres was donated by a devotee. The site is considered as central location for access from all parts of the state. The first building was designed for a small community and was completed in 1995. It served for both the religious services and as a langar hall.  New Prayer Hall  As congregation was increasing, Community decided to work on a bigger prayer hall and to use first building as dining hall. A fund drive was initiated to apply for the bank loan.

Here we have kept the two places not qualified otherwise as \\"probable\\" for the respective places of birth and death. Primo was one of the earliest followers of Sabbatai Zevi, the self- proclaimed Jewish messiah. Primo became Zevi's private secretary on Zevi's journey from Jerusalem to Smyrna in 1665, cleverly managing to give to the advent of the pseudo-Messiah an air of dignity. From Smyrna, Primo spread the news among foreign Jews that the Messiah had actually appeared. With certain of his confidants he was the first to plan the abolition of rabbinic Judaism. In the name of Zevi, Primo sent a circular to the Jews (December 1665) advising the abolition of the fast-day of the tenth of the tenth day of the month of ·π¨ebet on the Hebrew calendar. In February, 1666, Primo accompanied Zevi to Constantinople. After Zevi converted to Islam, Primo explained this apparent apostasy as having been foreordained in the Messianic role.

Roquette studied in Erlangen, Berlin, and Hamburg. In 1951 he defended a dissertation at the University of Hamburg under Helmut Hasse, providing a new proof of the Riemann hypothesis for algebraic function fields over a finite field (the first proof was given by Andr√© Weil in 1940). In 1951/1952 he was an assistant at the Mathematical Research Institute at Oberwolfach and from 1952 to 1954 at the University of Munich. From 1954 to 1956 he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1954 he was Privatdozent at Munich, and from 1956 to 1959 he worked in the same position at Hamburg. In 1959 he became an associate professor at the University of Saarbrucken and in the same year at the University of T√ºbingen. From 1967 he was professor at the Ruprecht-Karls- University of Heidelberg, where he retired in 1996. Roquette worked on number and function fields and especially local p-adic fields. He applied the methods of model theory (Nonstandard arithmetic) in number theory, joint with Abraham Robinson, with whom he worked on Mahler's theorem (on the finiteness of integral points on a curve of genus g> 0) using non-standard methods. He authored a number of works on the history of mathematics, in particular on the schools of Helmut Hasse and Emmy Noether. In 1975 Roquette was co-editor of the collected essays by Helmut Hasse. Since 1978 Roquette is member of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and since 1985, the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He has an honorary doctorate from the University of Duisburg-Essen and is honorary member of the Mathematical Society of Hamburg.

Among his accomplishments, Tilleman holds the Olympic record for the most three-point baskets in a single basketball game, hitting ten of sixteen three-point shots, and scoring 21 points in a row for Canada, in a game against Spain in the 1988 Seoul Olympics (highlight video). His Olympic and other international performances against such hall of fame basketball players as Michael Jordan, Karl Malone, and Charles Barkley led team coach, Jack Donohue, to call him \\"the best three-point shooter in the world.\\" His Olympic three-point record has never been broken, but has been tied twice, most recently by Carmelo Anthony of the US, in 2012. Tilleman had some of his best games against the United States. For example, in the 1983 Pan American Games, Tilleman scored 28 points in a head-to-head showdown with Michael Jordan; Tilleman's \\"excellent shooting\\" kept Canada in that tight game, which was tied 15 times. In the 1987 World University Games, where \\"Canada challenged the U.S. men all the way,\\" Tilleman again led Canada (and all players) scoring 21 points against a talented U.S. team led by future NBA stars B.J. Armstrong (Chicago Bulls) and Mitch Richmond (Golden State), and coached by the iconic Mike Krzyzewski. Tilleman has also excelled as an attorney. He clerked for former Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Clarence Thomas at the Supreme Court of the United States in 1992‚Äì93. He and Nick Bravin appear to be the only Olympians to also clerk for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. Tilleman is a two-time Olympian. He had strong performances in both the 1984 LA Olympics, where Canada finished fourth, and in 1988 in Seoul, where Canada finished sixth. In addition to setting the three-point record in 1988, Tilleman also was Canada's second leading scorer and had the highest points per minute of any Canadian player. In 1984, Tilleman again had the highest points per minute of any Canadian player (with a minimum of 50 minutes played). In Canada's initial game against the United States in 1984 (led again by Michael Jordan), Tilleman was Canada's second leading scorer with 10 points. In the 1984 bronze-medal game, Tilleman played especially well and was again Canada's second-leading scorer with 13 points (shooting 60% from the field), in a hard-fought loss to Yugoslavia, where Canada had pulled to within one point with one minute left in the game. Tilleman was drafted by the Denver Nuggets as their second pick and the 79th overall in 1984; he was the fourth highest NBA draft pick of any Canadian University basketball player in history. Tilleman had an unprecedented athletic career at the University of Calgary in Canada. He was voted the University's all-time greatest athlete receiving five times more votes than the closest runner-up. He is the only Calgary Dino ever drafted into the NBA. Tilleman has been inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame. He also has been inducted into the University of Calgary's Hall of Fame and had his jersey retired by the University. Tilleman and his Canadian teammates shocked the world in 1983 when they struck gold at the World Student Games held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Canada's 1983 gold- medal performance was one of the two finest moments in Canada's rich basketball history (the other was Canada's silver medal in men's basketball at the 1936 Berlin Olympics). In winning the 1983 Universiade gold medal, Canada solidly defeated powerhouse teams from the United States and Yugoslavia, both of which were laden with future NBA stars such as Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, and Drazen Petrovic. Canada's 1983 Universiade gold medal, Canada's only international gold medal in men's basketball, has been described as the \\"Miracle on Wood.\\" Tilleman was internationally recognized for his \\"superb shooting\\" skills with \\"ballistic range,\\" which allowed him to take games \\"into his own hands,\\" as he did when he scored 22 points in the second half against Puerto Rico in the 1983 Pan American Games, and when he drained 23 points in one quarter in the 1988 Utah Summer Games. Tilleman set his personal three- point record in 1986 against the Montana State Bobcats, who won the Big Sky Conference and went undefeated at home that season. Tilleman scored 50 points - on the Cats' home court - hitting 13 three-pointers and setting a record for the most points in a men's basketball game at Montana State's Worthington Arena. Tilleman holds numerous Canadian basketball records. He hit every free throw he attempted during the entire 1983‚Äì84 regular season, except one, resulting in a record-setting 98% free throw percentage that has never been broken by any Canadian or U.S. college player. Tilleman broke the Canadian University scoring record with a 32.9 points-per-game average (before Canada adopted the three-point line). He was named the most outstanding Canadian male basketball player two years consecutively, the first to accomplish that feat. Tilleman was the Canadian scoring champion in 1982 and 1983. He was voted a first team All-Canadian 4 consecutive years. And, he broke the University of Calgary's all-time point-per-game record and became Calgary's all-time leading scorer averaging 25.9 point-per-game (again, before the three-point line). Tilleman was the Canada-West Conference scoring champion 3 consecutive years (82‚Äì84), the Conference player of the year 3 consecutive years (81‚Äì83), and a unanimous first-team Conference all-star 4 consecutive years. In addition to his respected athletic career, Tilleman has distinguished himself as an attorney and in his charitable service in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Tilleman has been the managing partner of Steptoe & Johnson's Phoenix office, and has held many firm leadership positions, while also representing many high-profile companies, including the Harlem Globetrotters, the University of Southern California, Western Union, State Farm, AIG, and Metlife, Inc. In March 2019, Tilleman led a \\"powerhouse\\" litigation group that joined the Phoenix office of the Dentons law firmhttps://www.dentons.com/en/whats-different-about-dentons/connecting-you- to-talented-lawyers-around-the-globe/news/2019/april/dentons-lands-nine- lawyer-powerhouse-litigation-and-white-collar-team, which is the largest law firm in the world. In the LDS Church, which has no paid local clergy, Tilleman has served as a bishop and stake president in Phoenix, Arizona, and as mission president of the Canada Vancouver Mission. Tilleman currently serves as an Area Seventy in the Church's North America Southwest Area. Professional/Legal career After graduating from the University of Calgary, Tilleman studied at the Brigham Young University's J. Reuben Clark Law School, eventually graduating summa cum laude (with highest distinction), Order of the Coif in 1990 while also serving as the Editor-in-Chief of the BYU Law Review. Tilleman's record-setting performance in the 1988 Olympics was particularly noteworthy in that he was already in his second year of law school, and competing for the top spot in his law-school class, while at the same time training for, and then representing Canada in, the 1988 Olympics. After graduation, he clerked for Hon. John T. Noonan of the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit from 1990‚Äì1991. A year later, Tilleman had the prestigious honor of being selected as a law clerk by both Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice Clarence Thomas at the United States Supreme Court from 1992‚Äì93. No other Canadian Olympian has also been selected as a law clerk by a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. From 2000 through 2019, Tilleman was a partner at Steptoe & Johnson, where he was appointed managing partner of Steptoe's Phoenix office; Tilleman also served as the Practice Group Leader for Steptoe's worldwide complex commercial disputes group, Steptoe's largest practice group. His practice at Steptoe, and now at Dentons, focuses on litigating antitrust, intellectual property, RICO, complex contract, and high-profile insurance disputes. He has similarly earned awards and recognition as an attorney, which include being selected to Best Lawyers in America for insurance law from 2011‚Äì16, Southwest Super Lawyers for business litigation from 2009‚Äì15, Chambers USA: America's Leading Business Lawyers for general commercial litigation from 2011‚Äì12, and Arizona's Finest Lawyers in 2011. Additionally, Tilleman was interviewed by the White House for an appointment as a Federal-Court Judge, but realizing the position would considerably alter his priorities, he declined the offer. His clients include high-profile insurance, money transfer and entertainment companies. In a non- exclusive list, he was the lead trial lawyer for the Harlem Globetrotters in an intellectual property action filed in Federal Court by former Globetrotter superstars Meadowlark Lemon, Curly Neal, and others; Tilleman represented the University of Southern California in a multi-million antitrust and RICO lawsuit; he has represented Western Union in various financial-transaction cases, as well as State Farm, Allstate, AIG, and Metlife in numerous high- profile insurance cases. LDS Church Service In between his Olympic performances, Tilleman served as a full-time missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the California Arcadia Mission, speaking Spanish and working in Latino neighborhoods throughout the Los Angeles area. Additionally, while living in Phoenix, he was called to serve as a bishop\\"New mission presidents\\", Church News, 2011-03-26. and as a stake president. On March 26, 2011, he accepted a three-year assignment from the Church to serve as the mission president of the Canada Vancouver Mission. He put his legal practice on hold to fulfill the assignment, which ended on July 1, 2014. While serving as a mission president, Tilleman suffered a devastating fall, after being attacked by a bull mastiff dog, which left him paralyzed from the neck down because of the trauma, including a tear in the center of his spinal cord. He fought to overcome that paralyzing and potentially life-threatening injury to complete his three-year term as a mission president and then continue his practice of law with Steptoe & Johnson. Tilleman currently serves as an Area Seventy in the Church's North America Southwest Area. Athletic career International career Tilleman played for the Canadian Men's National Team from 1981 to 1984 and from 1986 to 1988. In 1983, he represented Canada on the team that won Gold in the World Student Games held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Later that year, in the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela, Tilleman knocked down 28 points despite being guarded most of the game by Michael Jordan, and before the three-point shot was adopted for international basketball. He participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, where Canada finished fourth overall. In that Olympics, Tilleman averaged 7.4 ppg, 1.4 rpg, and 1.1 apg, and Tilleman scored 10 points in Canada's initial game against the United States, which was his first rematch against Michael Jordan after the 1983 Pan American Games. After interrupting his basketball career to serve a mission for his church, Tilleman continued to represent Canada from 1986 through the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul Korea, where he averaged 11.9 ppg and 1.6 rpg, which points per game was second highest on the Canadian team in that Olympics. He had exceptional performances against Egypt and Spain where he scored 29 and 37 points respectively, with his shooting performance against Spain setting an Olympic record for three-point shots made in single game (10/16). In the mid 80s, Tilleman enjoyed tremendous success competing against top-caliber NCAA talent and future NBA players in AAU tournaments across the U.S. For example, playing against many Big Sky Conference and other NCAA Conference Allstars, Tilleman \\"blistered the nets\\" in the 1983 Western Invitational Tournament in Lewistown, Montana, averaging 41.25 points per game, which set a record for the prestigious 30-year-old tournament. The next year, playing for the Brewster Heights Packing Company, Tilleman and his teammates (including three other Canadian Olympic team members) won the WIT by narrowly defeating the Lewistown Boosters, a team led by John Stockton, the future NBA Allstar and all-time NBA assist leader. University =First Season (1979‚Äì80)= Prior to university, Tilleman attended Sir Winston Churchill High School where he led his team to the Calgary City Championship and later to the 4A Provincial Championship Finals. He started his freshman year and averaged 14.1 points per game with a 49 field goal percentage, and 1.9 rebounds per game, and was selected as a Canada West Conference Second Team Allstar as a freshman. =Second Season (1980‚Äì81)= In his second season, Tilleman greatly enhanced his performance which brought increased recognition and honors. He averaged 27.5 points per game, nabbed 4.8 rebounds per game, and had a 55.9 FG% -- a remarkable season-long shooting percentage given Tilleman's range and how heavily he was guarded by opposing teams. With this performance he was named the University of Calgary Male Athlete of the Year, Conference Player of the Year, a unanimous first team Canada West Athletic Association all-star, and a CIAU first team all-Canadian. =Third Season (1981‚Äì82)= In his third season he almost averaged a double-double with 32.9 ppg and 8.1 rpg with a 47.5 FG% With this scoring, Tilleman broke the previously held CIAU points per game scoring record of 31.3 ppg. Additionally, he maintained his honors as first team Canada West all-star, Conference Player of the Year, and CIAU all-Canadian, while additionally establishing himself as the CIAU MVP, and Conference and CIAU scoring champion of the year. =Fourth Season (1982‚Äì83)= In his fourth season Tilleman averaged 30.9 ppg and 4.1 rpg with a 51.5 FG%, which led him again to earn first team Canada West all-star, Conference player of the year, CIAU all- Canadian, and University of Calgary male Athlete of the Year awards, while additionally being recognized as the City of Calgary's Male Athlete of the Year by Calgary Sports Media. His scoring again lead him to be the Conference and CIAU scoring champion of that year. =Fifth Season (1983‚Äì84)= In the 1983‚Äì1984 season Tilleman again averaged superb numbers with 31.2 ppg, 5.2 rpg, a 48.5 FG%, and an incredible 98 free throw percentage, missing only one free throw during the entire Canada West regular season. With this he again was recognized as a Canada West first team all-star, CIAU all-Canadian, and the Conference scoring champion. In 1984 after his collegiate eligibility, he was drafted in the fourth round by the Denver Nuggets; however, upon arriving in Denver, he suffered from the flu and a sprained ankle and was consequently cut from the team.Carter, Larry. \\"Karl Tilleman: An Example of Determination and Endurance\\", Church News, 2 April 2015.

Under the direction of Wiest, The Jazz Symposium performed at the North Sea Jazz Festival, the Montreux Jazz Festival, and King's College London From 1994 to 1999, Wiest was a member of the Doc Severinsen Big Band. In 2006, Wiest reunited with Maynard Ferguson for Ferguson's final series of concerts: 6 nights, 12 sold-out performances at The Blue Note, Greenwich Village. From the fall of 2007 until August 2014, Wiest was at the University of North Texas as Assistant Professor of Jazz Composition and Jazz Trombone. Wiest founded The U-Tubes, the College's trombone band. In May 2009, Wiest became director of One O'Clock Lab Band and coordinator of the Lab Band Program, after having served as interim director since August 2008. In 2014 Wiest joined the faculty at the University of Denver Lamont School of Music as Coordinator of the 21st Century Music Initiative. Since 2016 he has served as Co-Chair of Jazz Studies.  2013‚Äì2014 project  In August 2013, Wiest, a sci-fi enthusiast, published a sci-fi novel, The Dover Stone: A Concerto for Folded Space. Wiest explains that it is built on inter-connected vignettes or movements that comprise an epic tale of life from other worlds and our place in the cosmos. The Term \\"folded space\\" is a theoretical speed of travel, faster than the speed of light, exceeding relativistic velocity by folding space, bringing far to near, reducing the long distances to a virtual zero. The tale is the impetus for ten compositions by Wiest, who describes the works as \\"programmatically informed\\" by the science fiction.\\" The fictional vignettes culminate to answer real-life physicist Enrico Fermi's famous question, \\"Where is everybody?\\", a reference to the wonderment of life elsewhere in the universe. The stories occur in periods from 1182 to 2457. The Steve Wiest Eclectic Electric Band will record the compositions as one album titled, Concerto for Folded Space. Wiest's compositional style ranges from straight ahead to jazz fusion, and sometimes pop-rock. With this project, Wiest is experimenting with serialism, not in a strict sense, but many elements are generated from rows. The musical portion is an ArtistShare project and is scheduled for release early 2014. The band members are Wiest (composer and trombonist), Stockton Helbing (drums, producer), Braylon Lacy (bass), Ryan Davidson (guitar), Noel Johnston (guitar), and Daniel Pardo (flute). Guest artist are Bob Mintzer (tenor sax), Arlington Jones (n√© Arlington Julius Jones II) (piano), and James Pankow (trombone). Essentially, ArtistShare is the record label and represents Wiest's foray into an alternative model for producing music. ArtistShare is a fan-funded platform where artists provide content for patrons who subscribe to access levels of their choosing. For example, on November 6, 2013, Wiest uploaded one in a series of \\"cool stuff\\", as he phrased it, to the Participant Zone of his ArtistShare Concerto for Folded Space site. The \\"cool stuff\\" included a \\"programmatic\\" analysis and complete score for \\"The Flutes of Glastonbury\\", one of the ten compositions. Other sci-fi inspired compositions Other sci-fi-related works composed by Wiest include \\"Ice-Nine\\", a 2009 composition scored for big band, drawn from Kurt Vonnegut's novel, Cat's Cradle. \\"New Cydoinia\\", a 2010 big-band arrangement, is a programmatic representation of all of the theories and stories surrounding the enigmatic area on Mars known as Cydonia. \\"A Night in Pidruid\\", a 2006 composition scored for big band, is a programmatic and thematic development of characters and events in Robert Silverberg's Lord Valentine's Castle. \\"Blues From Space\\", a 1984 composition scored for big band, is a novelty tune about an alien who brings a philosophy of \\"Sing the Blues\\" to Earth.

He played as a goalkeeper. Life and career Maidment was born in 1901 in Southwick, County Durham, the eldest son of Charles Kirtley Maidment, a labourer in a glassworks, and his wife, Amelia n√©e Charlton. At the time of the 1911 Census, Maidment had two younger brothers living; the younger of the two, Tom, also became a professional footballer. His father died in a mining accident while working at Hylton Colliery during the First World War. Maidment began his football career with Robert Thompson's works team before moving south to join Football League Third Division South club Southend United in 1923. After one season, during which he played infrequently, he moved on to Newport County, on the recommendation of his uncle, Billy Charlton, who was already on the club's books. Over the next six years, he played 220 League matches, missing only two league matches over his first three seasons and, unusually for a goalkeeper, scored three goals, all from the penalty spot. He then spent the 1930‚Äì31 season with Lincoln City as their regular goalkeeper, playing alongside his younger brother Tom as Lincoln finished as runners-up in the Third Division North. He spent two seasons in the Second Division with Notts County before finishing his career back in the third tier with Accrington Stanley. He married Georgina Upton in 1924. The 1939 Register finds him living in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, and working as a dairyman. He died in Rushcliffe, Nottinghamshire, in 1977 at the age of 75.

The parish includes the hamlets of Hele, West Panson, East Panson, Sitcott, Box's Shop, Peter's Finger, West Druxton, Poole and Netherbridge. The parish is surrounded clockwise from the north-west by the parishes of Northcott, Luffincott, Ashwater, Virginstow, Broadwoodwidger and Lifton. Its western border follows the River Tamar which forms the county boundary with Cornwall. In 2001 its population was 617, significantly higher than the 258 residents it had in 1901. The village is part of Broadheath electoral ward. At the 2011 census the population was 1,650. Church history Before 1193 the church of St Giles was a chapelry of North Petherwin belonging to the abbey of Tavistock. However, from 1288 it was a chapelry of St Stephen's by Launceston belonging to Launceston Priory. In 1500 the relationship between the two churches was settled; St Giles chapel was granted the right of burial and was thereafter to be served by a chaplain maintained by the priory who also served the chapel of Werrington. At the Reformation it became a donative.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 101 The parish church, about 1.5 miles north-west of the village, is dedicated to St Giles and dates from the 13th and 15th centuries.

In the past, Doda was largely inhabited by Sarazi population before people started settling here from Kashmir and other adjoining areas. The reasons for kashmiri population settling here in the past in 17th and 18th century is matter of ambiguity between historians. However Sumantra Bose says it was repression by feudal class that drew people to the district of Doda, Ramban and Kishtwar. The Chenab valley consists of areas drawn from the ancient principalities of Kishtwar and Bhadarwah, both of which became part of a district by the name of Udhampur in the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. People Kashmiris form majority in Chenab Valley but Gujjars, Paharis & Bhaderwahis have also significant population.

The multicolored, fragrant, non-invasive flowers of the Cochliasanthus caracalla are said to have corkscrew or nautilus-shell shaped flowers, hence the origin of that common name. Though some claim that the leaves of one species are darker and differently sized compared to the leaves of the other, it is difficult to distinguish between these two plants through foliage alone. There have been multiple instances where both plants have been grown side by side for years and the discovery that they were not the same species was made only after the less mature plant finally bloomed.

The flowers, which grow alone or in small groups rather than in clusters, consist of four petals: one large wavy half-circle on the top, two tear-drop shaped petals that point inwards, and a thin, erect, curly petal sprouting from the center of the flower. Depending on the angle, the two bottom petals can appear to be a single petal that strongly resembles the large, upper petal. When this happens, the three main petals come together to form an open-clam shape. The center of the flower and the end of the thin, erect may have a small area of yellow and/or white but the color is usually faint and only noticeable upon close examination. This invasive vine has taken over a fence and is now spreading across the ground. Immature flower buds often form fat half- crescents but, unlike the corkscrew vine, these buds are green, yellow, or brown. This plant might be more susceptible to aphids but is definitely invasive and has been compared by multiple growers to kudzu.

They are the result of crossbreeding traditional Heck cattle with aurochs-like cattle mostly from Southern Europe to achieve a greater resemblance to the aurochs and larger body size.

History  In 1996 the conservation group Arbeitgemeinschaft Biologischer Umweltschutz in Germany started to crossbreed Heck cattle with primitive cattle from Southern Europe such as Chianina, Sayaguesa Cattle and the Spanish fighting bull in the Lippeaue reserve near the town of Soest. The purpose was and is an increased resemblance to the extinct aurochs, because they considered Heck cattle not satisfying. For example, they write in one of their publications: \\"The 'recreations' by the Heck brothers are too small, too short-legged, not elegant and their horns are not satisfying\\".ABU info 06/07: Bunzel-Dr√ºke, Scharf & Vierhaus: \\"Lydias Ende ‚Äì eine Tragikom√∂die.\\" ABU info 30/31 (2006/07), pp. 58‚Äì67.

Taurus cattle are listed in the herdbook X of the German Heck cattle association VFA.

An increase in size was achieved, large Taurus bulls measure 160‚Äì165 cm at the withers while normal Heck bulls measure only 140 cm. Most bulls are black with a light dorsal stripe, some bulls have a light colour saddle. Cows are on average, but not always, a lighter colour than the bulls, most of them are coloured reddish brown or dark brown. Some cows are as of yet still greyish or beige, an undesirable legacy of Heck and Chianina influence. The horns of most Taurus cattle face forwards and also more inwards compared to un-crossed Heck cattle, but the exact curvature of the horns is variable to a certain degree. The skull is longer and more straight-profiled than that of Heck cattle, and therefore resembles the aurochs. Usually, Taurus cattle have a more athletic body than Heck cattle do, and their shoulder muscles are more developed.

In its opening paragraph, Pope Francis urged the entire Church \\"to embark on a new chapter of evangelism\\". According to the exhortation, the Church must understand itself as a \\"community of missionary disciples\\", who are \\"permanently in a state of mission\\". It has been described as \\"the manifesto of Francis\\" and a \\"Magna Carta for church reform.\\" Evangelii gaudium touches on many of the themes of Francis' papacy, including obligations Christians have to the poor and the duty to establish and maintain just economic, political, and legal orders. Francis says that the world \\"can no longer trust in the unseen forces and the invisible hand of the market\\" and calls for action \\"beyond a simple welfare mentality\\" that \\"attack[s] the structural causes of inequality.\\" Refocusing society's priorities, he asks how \\"it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points?\\" Calling for an \\"ecclesial renewal which cannot be deferred\\", Francis is critical of the over-centralization of church bureaucracy, unthinking preaching, and excessive emphasis on doctrine. Throughout the exhortation he calls for more pastoral creativity and openness, insisting that the entire Church realize \\"a missionary impulse capable of transforming everything\\".... \\"the path of a pastoral and missionary conversion which cannot leave things as they presently are.\\" In regard to what he perceives is a current negative dependence on over-centralization in the Church's structure as opposed to an open and missionary spirit flowing through every level, he writes, \\"I too must think about a conversion of the papacy.... The papacy and the central structures of the universal Church also need to hear the call to pastoral conversion.\\" In contrast to the writing style of previous popes, Evangelii gaudium is not written in an academic style but \\"in language that is both easily understood and captivating.\\" In the 47,560 word document, Francis uses the word \\"love\\" 154 times, \\"joy\\" 109 times, \\"the poor\\" 91 times, \\"peace\\" 58 times, \\"justice\\" 37 times, and \\"common good\\" 15 times.  Redaction  Archbishop V√≠ctor Manuel Fern√°ndez took part in the redaction of the document.  Content   Introduction  In the first chapters the Pope cites several Bible passages that show the relationship between the joy of receiving the Christian faith and the joy of missionary activity. Francis then offers several themes for the exhortation of the reform of the Church in her missionary outreach; the temptations faced by pastoral workers; the Church, understood as the entire People of God which evangelizes; the homily and its preparation; the inclusion of the poor in society; peace and dialogue within society; the spiritual motivations for mission.  Chapter I: The Church's Missionary Transformation (19-49)  In this chapter Francis underlines the importance of the parish, which \\"can assume quite different contours depending on the openness and missionary creativity of the pastor and community\\", and asks oratories, ecclesiastical movements, prelatures, and other communities in the Church to join the activities of the local parish. He shows the responsibility that bishops have for the missionary activities in their own diocese. In this context, in paragraph 32 the Pope says, \\"Since I am called to put into practice what I ask of others, I too must think about a conversion of the papacy\\", and that he is, as he notes Pope John Paul II had been, \\"open to suggestions which can help make the exercise of my ministry more faithful to the meaning which Jesus Christ wished to give it and to the present needs of evangelization\\".  Chapter II: Amid the Crisis of Communal Commitment (50-109)  The chapter is divided in two sections: the first one, Some challenges of today‚Äôs world, deals with economic matters, poverty, and modern culture. It also mentions the new religious movements and moral relativism. The second section, Temptations faced by pastoral workers, describes two errors commonly faced by Christians: first the \\"attraction of Gnosticism\\" that offers \\"a faith whose only interest is a certain experience or a set of ideas and bits of information\\"; the second is \\"the self-absorbed promethean neopelagianism\\" of those who \\"feel superior to others because they observe certain rules or remain intransigently faithful to a particular Catholic style from the past\\" with \\"a narcissistic and authoritarian elitism\\". He also noted that \\"In some people we see an ostentatious preoccupation for the liturgy\\".  Chapter III: The Proclamation of the Gospel (110-175)  Francis describes thoroughly the importance of the homily, which \\"should be brief and avoid taking on the semblance of a speech or a lecture\\", and should be prepared with care: \\"Preparation for preaching is so important a task that a prolonged time of study, prayer, reflection and pastoral creativity should be devoted to it [....] A preacher who does not prepare is not 'spiritual'; he is dishonest and irresponsible with the gifts he has received\\". \\"Missionary discipleship\\": \\"In virtue of their baptism, all the members of the People of God have become missionary disciples (cf. Mt 28:19). All the baptized, whatever their position in the Church or their level of instruction in the faith, are agents of evangelization, and it would be insufficient to envisage a plan of evangelization to be carried out by professionals while the rest of the faithful would simply be passive recipients. The new evangelization calls for personal involvement on the part of each of the baptized. Every Christian is challenged, here and now, to be actively engaged in evangelization\\"  Chapter IV: The Social Dimension of Evangelization (176-258)  The fourth chapter deals with many topics: care for the weakest persons (\\"the homeless, the addicted, refugees, indigenous peoples, the elderly who are increasingly isolated and abandoned, and many others\\"), long term politics, and social dialogue: the dialogue between faith and reason, ecumenical dialogue, and inter-religious dialogue. In paragraph 246, Francis calls for ecumenical unity and trust among Christian missionaries because they must speak in one voice: \\"Given the seriousness of the counter-witness among Christians, particularly in Asia and Africa, the search for paths to unity becomes all the more urgent.... If we concentrate on the convictions we share, and if we keep in mind the principle of the hierarchy of truths, we will be able to progress decidedly toward common expressions of proclamation, service and witness.\\" In paragraph 247 he affirms that \\"As Christians, we cannot consider Judaism as a foreign religion; nor do we include the Jews among those called to turn from idols and to serve the true God (cf. 1 Thes 1:9). With them, we believe in the one God who acts in history, and with them we accept his revealed word.\\" In paragraph 249 he writes, \\"While it is true that certain Christian beliefs are unacceptable to Judaism, and that the Church cannot refrain from proclaiming Jesus as Lord and Messiah, there exists as well a rich complementarity which allows us to read the texts of the Hebrew Scriptures together and to help one another to mine the riches of God‚Äôs word. We can also share many ethical convictions and a common concern for justice and the development of peoples\\". In paragraph 254 he teaches that non-Christian rituals of any religion can have a divine origin, that they are \\"a communitarian experience of journeying towards God\\" and can be \\"channels which the Holy Spirit raises up in order to liberate non-Christians from atheistic immanentism or from purely individual religious experiences\\".  Chapter V: Spirit-filled Evangelizers (259-288)  The last part of the exhortation deals with the personal relationship with Christ and the imitation of the Virgin Mary as an icon of joy and missionary activity.Rino Fisichella in his press conference in the Vatican In English, IN LINGUA INGLESE  Influences  Most of the exhortation is Francis' own personal insight. His text cites several sources. The main source is the Propositions of the synodal fathers of the XIII assembly of the Synod of Bishops, cited 27 times. Among Church Fathers, Francis cites Irenaeus of Lyon, Ambrose of Milan and Augustine of Hippo. Among medieval teachers he cites Isaac of Stella, Thomas Kempis, and Saint Thomas Aquinas. Modern authors cited by the Pope include John Henry Newman, Henri de Lubac, Romano Guardini and Georges Bernanos.Lorenzo Baldisseri in his press conference in the Vatican On 10 May 2015, Ra√∫l Castro met Pope Francis at the Vatican and was presented a copy. When Donald Trump visited Vatican City on 25 May 2017, Pope Francis presented to him copies of Evangelii gaudium and Laudato Si. In May 2007, at the Fifth Episcopal Conference of Latin America in Aparecida, Brazil, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, later Pope Francis was elected by his brother bishops to chair the important committee charged with drafting the final document. The Aparecida document includes themes concerning evangelism, care for the poor and more that are also found in Evangelii Gaudium. Analogous to Pope John Paul II's Redemptor hominis published in the first year of that papacy, Pope Francis published this document in the first year of his papacy to establish recurring themes.  In music  On behalf of the Diocese of Limburg, Peter Reulein wrote the music for the oratorio Laudato si' - a Franciscan Magnificat to the libretto by Helmut Schlegel OFM. This work is based on the Latin version of the Magnificat, corresponds to the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, and includes texts from the apostolic exhortation Evangelii gaudium and the encyclical Laudato si'. The premiere of the oratorio took place in the Limburg Cathedral on 6 November 2016.  Response Adam Rasmussen, an openly \\"pro- Francis partisan\\" at Georgetown University, favors Evangelii gaudium, wherein \\"Francis already spoke positively of religious pluralism\\", over the Document on Human Fraternity: \\"Despite the commotion this document has made, what it says about religions is actually less noteworthy than what is in Evangelii Gaudium. I don't think many people noticed section 254 when it came out because they were too busy arguing about other sections of EG!\\" But that \\"Francis takes up and even advances Vatican II's teachings on other religions\\" \\"in his first official document\\", did not fail to be noticed. Pat Perriello, associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, calls the document \\"truly remarkable\\", representing \\"a bold new vision for the church.\\"Perriello, Pat. \\"Some gems from 'Evangelii Gaudium'\\", National Catholic Reporter, December 9, 2013  References   External links  * \\"Evangelii Gaudium -English text * Quoted by the (): * 21st-century Catholicism Apostolic exhortations of Pope Francis Christianity and other religions Islam-related controversies 2013 in Vatican City 2013 in Christianity ","title":"Evangelii gaudium"},{"id":"41199629","title":"Croat Muslims"},{"id":"41199635","text":"Mark Jun Hashem is an American politician and a Democratic member of the Hawaii House of Representatives since January 19, 2011 representing District 18.

Article 334 had stipulated that the reservation of seats should expire within a period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution (i.e. 26 January 1960). The 8th Amendment extended the period for reservations to 1970. The period of reservation was extended to 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020 and 2030 by the 23rd, 45th, 62nd, 79th, 95th and 104th Amendments respectively. Text The full text of Article 334 of the Constitution, after the 8th Amendment, is given below: Proposal and enactment Article 334 of the Constitution laid down that the provisions of the Constitution relating to the reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the representation of the Anglo-Indian community by nomination in the House of the People and the Legislative Assemblies of the States would cease to have effect on the expiration of a period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution (i.e., it would expire in 1960). According to the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the bill, \\"Although the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes had made considerable progress in the last ten years, the reasons which weighed with the Constituent Assembly in making provision for the aforesaid reservation of seats and nomination of members had not ceased to exist.\\" The government proposed that the reservation and the representation of Anglo-Indians by nomination be continued for a further period of ten years. In extending the period of nomination of members of the Anglo- Indian community, it was also proposed to fix the number of such members who might be nominated by Governors to State Assemblies and an amendment of article 333 was accordingly proposed. The Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Bill, 1959 (Bill No. 79 of 1959) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 16 November 1959. It was introduced by Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant, then Minister of Home Affairs, and sought to amend articles 333 and 334 of the Constitution. The bill was debated by the Lok Sabha on 30 November and 1 December. A motion to adopt clause 2 of the bill, which sought to amend article 333 of the Constitution, failed to get a majority of the total membership of the House (though more than two-thirds of the members present and voting had voted in favour of the motion). The said clause was omitted from the Bill. Clause 3 of the bill, which sought an amendment of article 334, was adopted in its original form by the Lok Sabha on 1 December. The bill, with the omission of clause 2, was passed by the House on 1 December 1959. Clause 3 was then re-numbered as clause 2, and the bill was considered and adopted by the Rajya Sabha on 7 December 1959. The bill, after ratification by the States, received assent from then President Rajendra Prasad on 5 January 1960, came into force on the same date. It was notified in The Gazette of India on 6 January 1960. Ratification The Act was passed in accordance with the provisions of Article 368 of the Constitution, and was ratified by more than half of the State Legislatures, as required under Clause (2) of the said article.

Matari Advertising is also one of the founder of \\"Persatuan Perusahaan Periklanan Indonesia\\" (Indonesian Advertising Company association) or also known as PPPI. Matari advertising started as Matari Inc. which was a subsidiary company of Mark Lean Advertising Agency and used most of their resources from the company, before finally separate themselves from the company and become an independent company which fully uses local resources, because they believe that the Indonesian understand their country better than anyone else. On 1973, Matari advertising had a problem with Indonesian Advertising Company Association and Grant International, which resulted in Matari advertising being suspended for a short period of time. During the period of 1975 - 1976, Matari advertising faced a hard time because they were trying to speculate outside advertising industry.

The prototype was developed in secrecy under the pseudonyms Ryujo Maru and Fuso Maru using features later adopted by other navies for dock landing ships and amphibious transport docks. Additional ships were built after combat experience validated the concept, but most were completed after the Japanese invasions of the early war, and used primarily as troopships during later operations. Today's amphibious assault ships bear a strong similarity to this concept. Prototype Shinsh≈´ Maru Hei-type Akitsu Maru Prototype Shinsh≈´ Maru was completed in 1935 and modified in 1936 to include a floodable well dock. She was the world's first ship specifically designed to carry and launch landing craft. She introduced stern and side gates to launch landing craft for the 2,200 soldiers she carried. She demonstrated the advantages of the concept at the invasions of Shanghai, Malaya and Java. Hei-type Hei-type landing craft carriers included a flight deck with a capacity for 28 aircraft, but no hangar deck, since the deck beneath the flight deck was used to carry 25 landing craft launched through stern doors. Akisu Maru was completed in time to participate in the invasion of Java; but she and the other Hei-types were thereafter used primarily as ferries to transport short-range aircraft to distant bases. The first two were completed from 11,800-ton, Nippon Kaiun, K. K. passenger ships under construction by Harima Shipbuilding. They operated two Kayaba Ka-1 autogyros. Both were sunk by submarines in 1944. * Akitsu Maru was completed in January 1942. * Nigitsu Maru was completed in March 1943. The others were based on Hitachi Shipbuilding Corporation's standard 8,000-ton, Type-M cargo steam ship modified (Type-MB) to carry twelve Toku-Daihatsu class landing craft launched through stern doors with funnels installed horizontally on the starboard side to accommodate a flight deck. * Kumano Maru was completed in March 1945 and survived for use as a repatriation ship. * Tokitsu Maru was incomplete when World War II ended. She was completed as a whaling ship in 1946 and sank in the Antarctic in 1953. Ko-type The larger type were 11,910-ton, diesel-engined ships fitted with stern ramp gates for launching twenty Daihatsu class landing craft stored in floodable holds. At the time, this launching method was unprecedented. Both were sunk by submarines with very heavy loss of life. * Mayasan Maru was completed in December 1942. * Tamatsu Maru was completed in January 1944. Later production was Hitachi's standard Type-M steam ship modified (Type-MA) to carry twelve Toku-Daihatsu class landing craft. The landing craft were launched from rails which ran along the main deck (between port and starboard funnels for those carried forward of the superstructure) down to the waterline through large hinged doors at the stern. Settsu Maru survived for use as a repatriation ship, but her sister-ships were sunk in air raids on Japanese ports. * Kibitsu Maru was completed in December 1943. * Hyuga Maru was completed in November 1944. * Settsu Maru was completed as a coal-burner in January 1945. Otsu- type Takatsu Maru was a 5,656-ton, 19-knot steam ship completed in January 1944 with icebreaker capability, and used conventional cranes rather than gates for handling nine Toku-Daihatsu class landing craft. She was sunk by United States aircraft in Ormoc Bay during the invasion of the Philippines.

The focus here is on English-language editions. Many other artists have created illustrations for non-English language editions. The illustrator for the original editions was John Tenniel, whose illustrations for Alice and Looking Glass are perhaps the best known illustrations ever published. This article is an ongoing attempt to list all major illustrators of the Alice books from 1899 to the present day. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland was first published in 1865, but it was withdrawn as the illustrator, Tenniel, was unhappy with the quality of the printing. The text blocks were sent to America where they were bound with a new title page and sold there. Apart from E. Gertrude Thomson, who illustrated the cover of The Nursery \\"Alice\\" (1890), the first artist other than Tenniel to produce illustrations for Alice was Beatrix Potter, who created six illustrations in the 1890s although none appeared in book form.Illustrating Alice. Artists' Choice 2013 page22  Copyright  In America, until 1891, publishers could reprint British books without the copyright restraint, but from that date on they had to get the agreement of the UK publishers and authors. As a result, several US publishing houses issued copies of the Alice books with Tenniel illustrations. McManus was the first to attempt the task of providing new illustrations for the books in 1899. Up to 1907, Macmillan held the exclusive copyright of Alice's Adventures in Britain and the Colonies. When the copyright ran out many publishers took the opportunity to issue the Alice book with new illustrations, and around 20 editions appeared in the following two years alone.

He previously served two terms in the Florida House of Representatives, representing the parts of the West Palm Beach area from 2012 to 2016. History Powell was born in Riviera Beach, and attended Florida A&M; University, where he received his degree in public relations. He then attended Florida State University, receiving his master of science in planning. Powell then took a job working as the city planner of West Palm Beach in 2007, and then began as a legislative aide for State Representative Mack Bernard in 2009. Florida House of Representatives In 2012, Bernard declined to seek re-election so he could instead run for a seat in the Florida Senate, and the legislative districts in the state were redrawn, so Powell opted to run in the newly created 88th District. He faced Evelyn Garcia, Nikasha Wells, and Charles Bantel in the Democratic primary, and he earned the endorsement of The Palm Beach Post, which praised him for his \\"good record of community service\\" and for his familiarity with the district. Powell ended up defeating his opponents by a wide margin, winning 51% of the vote to Garcia's 24%, Wells's 17%, and Bantel's 8%, and advanced to the general election, where he was elected unopposed. Entering the 2013 legislative session, Powell announced that his top three legislative priorities were allowing local governments to prohibit concealed weapons at certain events, postponing the expiration date of state-funded \\"health flex plans\\" for five years, and making it more difficult for prosecutors to try children as adults for criminal offenses. When the Republican-controlled legislature did not act on a bill authored by State Senator Dwight Bullard and State Representative Cynthia Stafford that would have raised the state's minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, Powell joined several of his colleagues in support of raising the minimum wage by living on it for a week.

Early and family life Jaudon was born in 1796, the eldest son of Daniel and Anna (McNeal) Jaudon. He graduated from Princeton University in 1813.Princeton University General Catalogue (1875) at p. 48, available at https://books.google.com/books?id=3nzOAAAAMAAJ&dq;=samuel+jaudon+1874&source;=gbs_navlinks_s Marguerite Peyton Alricks (1799-1880) married Jaudon and bore six children, three of whom survived their parents: Francis Orme Jaudon (1825-1827); Julia Webster Jaudon (1831-1901); Samuel Peyton Jaudon (1831-1891, who married Oshidzu Matsura (d. 1896 in Japan); Francis Duncan Jaudon (1833-1906); Lawson White Jaudon (1836-1852); and Ada Mary Jaudon (1839).http://records.ancestry.com/samuel_jaudon_records.ashx?pid=117002589 A sister-in-law was Mary T. Bainbridge, daughter of Commodore William Bainbridge ( -1835), who bequeathed his daughters Pennsylvania state bonds. Jaudon managed the money, ultimately to ill effect, as described below. Career In 1835, Jaudon sold the Bainbridge estate bonds and invested the money in the Delaware and Raritan Canal Company. Jaudon's principal job at the time was cashier of the Bank of the United States under Nicholas Biddle when the bank was still an authorized national bank and the heart of the Bank War between Biddle and U.S. president Andrew Jackson. During these years, the bank was \\"plagued with allegations of poor management and fraud\\" including improper investments made by Jaudon and others, and election fraud in the form of preferential loans to political allies. The bank lost its national charter but stayed in business with a state charter. In 1837-1838, Jaudon served as a director of the Wilmington and Susquehanna Railroad, one of the four companies that created the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. (The main line survives today as part of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.) When the W&S; merged into the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, Jaudon stayed on as a director. His service as a railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument in Philadelphia. Jaudon resigned from the railroad's board in 1838, and traveled to London to try to sell various U.S. securities on behalf of the now-private second Second Bank of the United StatesBank of the United States. Among his endeavors, he sought in March to secure a $400,000 loan for the PW&B-connected; Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mountjoy and Lancaster Railroad. In May, he told railroad officials that the bond market was glutted, but they pressed him to lower his price. In August, PW&B; officials authorized he and William Strickland to negotiate a loan for their railroad. He ultimately succeeded in 1840 in obtaining a loan of $113,000 by using United State Bank bonds as collateral. Jaudon was noted as a skilled \\"financial diplomat\\" who managed to keep European capital flowing to the Bank amid the Panic of 1837, his efforts to abet U.S. cotton speculation, and dubious bond sales, but could not ultimately keep the bank afloat. It suspended payments in late 1839, and closed in 1841. On December 10, 1841, Jaudon, along with Biddle and John Andrews, were indicted by a grand jury on charges of defrauding the bank's stockholders of $400,000 in 1836 and trying to cover it up through fraudulent recordkeeping in 1841. By 1844, Jaudon and his family lived in New York City. In 1855, Jaudon was secretary of the Texas Pacific Railway Company based in New York, but which sought to build a railroad with land grants from the Mississippi River. President Polk's Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker was President, and Samuel Butler King of Georgia was also involved.Building a State in Apache Land, available at Project Gutenberghttp://www.ttarchive.com/Library/Articles/Texas- Pacific_Oxteams-to-Eagles.html The American Civil War interrupted the project, which ultimately succeeded after Jaudon's death as the Texas and Pacific Railway under Jay Gould. In 1865, Jaudon took out a loan from the National City Bank of New York to finance coal speculation, and gave as collateral 47 shares of his sister-in-law's stock without her knowledge, and later the remaining 70 shares. In December 1867, when the loan came due, he sold Mary's stock to cover his own debt. Mary sued Jaudon, who sued his bank, who countersued in a case that was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court. The Jaudons lost the money. Death Jaudon died in Philadelphia on May 31, 1874, survived by his widow and three children.

He had a reputation for being quixotic, brilliant and stylish (\\"more worthy of a novel than a brief obituary,\\" per The Independent),Adrian Dannatt (February 07, 1996), OBITUARY: Guillaume Gallozzi The Independent. and played a role in the careers of significant artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Stan Peskett and Steven Sykes. In the early 1980s Gallozzi and partner Joe La Placa (the latter went on to found All Visual Arts in London in 2007) opened the Gallozzi-La Placa Gallery in New York's TriBeCa. In 1981 Gallozzi had presented the first significant solo exhibition of Stan Peskett's installation art in New York, subsequently becoming Peskett's dealer. In the mid-1980s Gallozzi diversified into representing Italian Futurists, the Hudson River School and British surrealists, and mounted notable exhibitions until 1988, when the Gallozzi-La Placa Gallery ceased active operations. In the meantime, however, Stan Peskett had introduced Gallozzi to the drama of war art, specifically to British war artists and, in 1989, working with The British Council USA (cultural department of the British Embassy in Washington DC) and its then cultural affairs officer Barbara Rosen, Gallozzi mounted a show of British war artists at the National Museum of the United States Navy in Washington DC. Several of Gallozzi's catalogs, including those on war art, are collectors items, other examples being Metamorphose: British Surrealists and Neo-romantics (1992), and Back in No Time (1994), a catalog featuring works of painter and performance artist Brion Gysin. The only criticism leveled at Gallozzi during the final few years of his life is that his tastes had become, if anything, too sophisticated, or \\"decidedly r√©cherch√©\\" as The New Yorker put it.

For instance, a particular recipe to imitate roe-filled mitten crabs, shows that the demand and intense fondness for crab and crab-roe in Chinese cuisine goes back several centuries, and that people have also actively attempted to find a substitute for it when it is unavailable: Annotated manuscript More than half a century after the publication of the Suiyuan Shidan, Xia Chuanzheng (, 1843‚Äì1883) annotated and expanded the contents of the original work and published it as the (, The Way of Eating, Extended and Rectified). The modified work contains two additional chapters: *\\"Sweeteners and colourants\\" () *\\"Condiments\\" () The original text was also thoroughly annotated with reference to Chinese historical and philosophical works, and listed therapeutic effects of the food based on traditional Chinese medicine. Correction to errors in the Suiyuan Shidan were also provided by Xia along with sometimes humorous anecdotes about the foods.

The anthem is a setting of a passage from the litany compiled by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, and later included in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. It was composed circa 1679‚Äì82 at the beginning of Purcell's tenure as Organist and Master of the Choristers for Westminster Abbey. Composition Remember not, Lord, our offences is an anthem for an a cappella choir consisting of five voice parts: two soprano parts, alto, tenor and bass (SSATB). Purcell originally composed the 44-measure work in the key of A minor. Some arrangements of the anthem include a continuo instrumental accompaniment. Musicologist and historian Franklin B. Zimmerman (born 1923) designated the anthem as \\"Z.50\\" in his catalogue of Purcell's works.

During this time, Purcell had been appointed Organist and Master of the Choristers of Westminster Abbey in 1679 with the resignation of John Blow.Runciman, John F. Purcell. (London: George Bell & Sons, 1909), passim. He dedicated the next few years entirely to the composition of sacred music. In July 1682, following the death of Edward Lowe, Purcell was appointed organist of the Chapel Royal--an office which he held simultaneously with his position at Westminster Abbey.Hutchings, Arthur. Purcell. (London: British Broadcasting Corporation, 1982), 85. In his personal life, Purcell had married Frances Peters (or Pieters) who bore him a son that died shortly after birth.Westrup, J. A. Purcell. (London: J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd., 1975), 41. During the 1680s and tenure at Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal, Purcell compiled earlier and contemporary sacred music (including several of his own compositions) into one collection for the use of the choirs of both churches. Two extant manuscripts compiled by Purcell are currently held in the collections of the University of Cambridges Fitzwilliam Museum. Both manuscripts include Remember not, Lord, our offences.University of Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum MS 88, item 25, folio 99r, and MS 117, item 79, folio 124, page 213 as \\"Vers of ye litany\\" (Remember not, O Lord)Thompson, Robert ‚ÄúPurcell's great autographs‚Äù in Price, Curtis (editor) Purcell Studies (Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press, 1995), 6‚Äì34, at 31.Shay, Robert. \\"Purcell as collector of 'ancient' music: Fitzwilliam MS 88\\" in Price, Curtis (editor) Purcell Studies (Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press, 1995), 35‚Äì50, at 50. The choral anthems, including Remember not, Lord, our offences, that Purcell composed after his appointment to Westminster and before his appointment at the Chapel Royal are described as his \\"last concentrated involvement with the verse anthem without strings.\\" After 1681, Purcell began including string accompaniments to his choral anthems‚Äîa shift that musicologist Martin Adams attributes to having more resources available to him with his appointment to the Chapel Royal.Adams, Martin. Henry Purcell: The Origins and Development of His Musical Style. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995). Adams states that the anthems of this period included revisions of earlier works, including his well-known setting of the Anglican funeral sentences, and that these works are \\"distinguished by complex contrapuntal textures, a concentration on a limited quantity of motivic material, and the somber expression of penitential texts.\\" Purcell's anthems reflect the influence of compositional techniques developed by earlier composers William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons. These anthems are closely related to those composed by Purcell's friend and teacher, John Blow, \\"with their basso seguente continuo and severe counterpoint, they are true stile antico.\\" See also * Anglican church music * List of compositions by Henry Purcell Notes References External links * Compositions by Henry Purcell Choral compositions Anthems Compositions in A minor Anglican church music British church music Classical church music ","title":"Remember not, Lord, our offences"},{"id":"41200391","text":"Sigbj√∏rn Apeland (born 10 May 1966 was raised in Sveio, Norway) is a musician (organ and Harmonium) and scientist, known from several recordings and for his work in the borderland between folk music, church music and improvisational music.

It was named in honour of Saint Mark the Evangelist. The order may have lasted from the 780s to 1797, when the Republic of Venice fell.  History  The Order of Saint Mark was the only chivalry order of the Republic of Venice. Its institution date is unknown, but quoted as early as year 787., or 1180 and fully documented since the XV century. It held different values in importance and public consideration depending on whether the authority by decree with which it was granted was greater or lesser, that is, that the resolution of the appointment came from the Major Council, the Senate or the Doge. The delivery of the insignia of the Order took place in the Full Assembly (Pien Collegio) or in the ducal private rooms. The Knights, however, were always armed by the Head of the Republic, who touched their shoulders with a sword saying the Latin words \\"Esto miles fidelis\\" (\\"you will be a faithfull knight\\"). The knighthood was not hereditary with the only exceptions of the descendants of count Giacomo Zanotto, nominated Cavaliere di San Marco for the role played in the Battle of Lepanto by the doge Alvise I Mocenigo with diploma on December 16, 1571 \\"with benefit transmissible to all its legitimate descendants in perpetuity\\" and the descendants of Benedetto Quirini in 1597, awarded the Order for his great merits during the famine and plague that struck the Kingdom of Candia in 1590 and 1592. Furthermore, in 1769 the Serenissimo doge Alvise IV Mocenigo conferred, in perpetuity, the title of Knight of San Marco also to the Most Reverend Canons of the Venerable Chapter of the Cathedral of Treviso. The Order become extinguished on May 12, 1797, when the Doge and the magistrates renounced the insignia of command and the Major Council abdicated and declared the Republic of Venice lapsed. The insigna The insigna of the order, when granted by the Doge as a \\"public and honorable mark for actions of marked value\\" and reserved for \\"low officers and soldiers\\", was a bifurcated cross enamelled in white and blue with the Lion of Saint Mark \\"in majesty\\"In Maest√†, frontal view. The lion \\"passant\\" was common in other heraldry devices of the Republic of Venezia, like flags, statues, paintings, etc, but on medals, coins, seals etc the more circular-shaped \\"in majesty\\" pose was often used instead. in the center, suspended around the neck by a gold chain, and was granted either in the gold class (which gave the right to an extra one-month pay yearly bonus) or in the silver one (with a half-month pay bonus). When it was instead granted by the Major Council or by the Senate, in addition to the cross, a gold medal was also used depicting the winged lion of Saint Mark on the recto and on the reverse a dedication inscription, hanging on a more elaborate gold necklace often of great value. The few patricians awarded the Order (about twenty) could not wear their insignia when they dressed in the traditional robe and used instead a golden border on the stole of the ordinary robe, or, with the ceremonial robe, a stole of flowery gold brocade, passing from the left shoulder to the right hip, which made them known as the \\"Knights of the Order of the Golden Stole\\".It was not a separate order, but simply an appellative of the patrician Knight of Saint Mark However, the use of the golden stole by the patricians did not necessarily indicate the conferment of the Order of Saint Mark, as it was also used as a distinction for the knighthoods given by foreign princes and sovereigns to the ambassadors of the Serenissima Republic and recognized by the Veneto Governo upon their return to Venice.

In 1979, the building was donated by John Rauch Jr. to the Junior League of Indianapolis to be used for their headquarters and operated as an event venue and house museum. In 2009, the building was purchased by The Children's Museum of Indianapolis, which sits on adjacent property, and is currently an event venue. History The land on which the house was built was purchased by Gustav A. and Matilda Mayer Schnull, of the wealthy Schnull merchant family, in 1901. They worked together with the architect Bernard Vonnegut of Vonnegut and Bohn, who was the husband of Matilda's sister, in designing the house, and the Brandt Brothers firm built it. Construction began in the fall of 1902, and the Schnulls and their three daughters moved in on April 4, 1904. After Matilda's death in 1923, their daughter Gertrude and her husband John G. Rauch, a lawyer who became president of the Art Association of Indianapolis, joined Gustav in the home. The house remained a residence for the Rauch family until the late 1970s, and kept its original furnishings and design into the modern era. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs After John Rauch died in February 1978, his son John Rauch Jr. worked with the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana to conduct a study on the future use of the home, intending to donate it for community use. There was serious consideration given to converting the building into the official mayor's residence, official city reception house, a community center, a house museum, or allowing The Children's Museum of Indianapolis to absorb it. After city use of the building was ruled out due to the taxpayer expense that would be required for its upkeep, the Rauch family eventually decided to donate it to the Junior League of Indianapolis. The first floor remained true to the original decorations, and was used for receptions and as a museum, while the second floor was rented for other non-profits' use, and the third floor was reserved for the Junior League headquarters. The Junior League moved its headquarters to the building and constructed a parking lot in 1981, and in 1983 it completed the restoration of the structure. The house was built to be used for entertaining, with a spacious ballroom with a dance floor, formal drawing room, and library, and these features have allowed it to continue to be used as a popular venue for weddings and other events; by the 1990s, reservations were required a year in advance for wedding receptions due to its popularity. The Children's Museum of Indianapolis purchased the property from the Junior League in 2008, to be used for events. In the spring of 2013, the house was renovated as part of the St. Margaret's Hospital Guild's annual Decorators' Show House and Gardens charity event. The Children's Museum brands the building as \\"The Manor at The Children's Museum of Indianapolis\\".  Architectural and historical significance  Schnull‚ÄìRauch House after completion in 1904 The three-story structure is described as Romanesque Revival architecture. The house was originally decorated with oriental rugs from Persia, moire silk wallpaper, several ornate mantles, stained glass windows, heavy velvet curtains, hand-carved woodwork, inlaid hardwood floors, and marble bathrooms‚Äîmuch of which survives to the present. The building is unique in being the only remaining historic home of its era along Meridian Street not to have been demolished or remodeled as offices. The house also exhibits many surviving objects from the Schnull and Mayer German immigrant families to which Gustav and Matilda Schnull belonged, prominent in the Indianapolis banking and wholesaling industries in the late 19th century. Called \\"one of the best-designed of the city's Meridian Street mansions\\" by the Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission, the house is also an outstanding example of the architecture of Bernard Vonnegut, a German-trained architect and the first licensed architect in Indiana, who designed many other Indianapolis landmarks. He took a special interest in the house, as he was personally designing it for his brother- and sister-in-law. He also designed the china cabinets, mantelpieces, and carved wood sideboards. The house is architecturally distinctive for its castle keep-inspired tower, thick brick walls, red tile roof, and large stone porch entrance.

A modular process skid is a process system contained within a frame that allows the process system to be easily transported. Individual skids can contain complete process systems and multiple process skids can be combined to create larger process systems or entire portable plants. They are sometimes called ‚Äúa system in a box.‚Äù An example of a multi- skid process system might include a raw materials skid, a utilities skid and a processing unit which work in tandem. Process skids are considered an alternative to traditional stick-built construction where process system parts are shipped individually and installed incrementally at the manufacturing site. They provide the advantage of parallel construction, where process systems are built off-site in a fabrication facility while civil site upgrades are completed at the plant site simultaneously. Skids are not always appropriate. If individual process parts are large and cannot reasonably be contained within the frame of a modular process skid, traditional construction methods are preferred. Skid design and layout Process skids are designed to contain a complete process system, a complete unit of operations or to organize a manufacturing process into logical units. All skids have the following characteristics in common: * Portable design‚Äì because they are self- contained units, built within frames, skid systems are easier to transport than traditional process systems. * Small footprint ‚Äì process skid frames allow equipment layering. Piping, tanks, and necessary process equipment can be fit into a smaller footprint with a skid design * Gathered process connections ‚Äì process connections are gathered into one spot on the skid, making plant connections easier. In traditional process systems, connections are spread throughout the plant. * Controlled assembly ‚Äì skids are typically built in controlled conditions offsite. Existing operations are not affected by skid fabrication. *FAT testing before installation ‚Äì Factory acceptance testing (FAT) can be completed before modular process skids are shipped to site. This reduces the amount of on-site startup time. *Accessible layout ‚Äì skids are designed for accessibility, usually including a center hallway, and major pieces of equipment placed around the edge of the frame.

The Sunrise Movement recognized Lee as likely \\"the most accomplished climate change legislator in the country.\\" The Progressive Campaign Change Committee included Lee on their political Power List for his \\"long list of accomplishments\\" and \\"helping to build the power of the progressive community.\\" The Honolulu Star-Advertiser noted that \\"Lee has been effective in shepherding legislation on energy and advancing a range of progressive goals\\" These include passing the nation's first legislation committing a state to ensuring basic financial security for all families, the first law requiring utilities to sell 100 percent renewable energy, the first law committing a state to carbon neutrality, the first tax breaks for organic farming, the first laws requiring all public schools and universities to become net-zero facilities, and co-authoring the first law banning the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos, and the first law banning toxic chemicals in sunscreens. He was also the first elected official to raise the national alarm about widespread harm to vulnerable children and adults resulting from predatory gambling mechanisms in video games.  Winning battles against large corporations and industry influence  Lee has also received attention for successfully winning several high-profile political battles against multi-billion dollar corporations and industries. = Industrial pesticide companies = 90 percent of all industrial genetically modified corn in the United States is developed in Hawaii, a testing ground for new pesticides. Following reports of aerial pesticide spraying impacting the health of children and families in Hawaii, in 2010 Lee introduced the first of a series of bills to address the business practices of large pesticide companies and their impacts on public health. This bill sought to protect small farmers from lawsuits routinely used by large pesticide companies to intimidate and threaten smaller farmers. Pesticide companies lobbied and killed the bill. Undeterred, Lee began coordinating with community groups and environmental organizations and in subsequent years introducing bills to require disclosure of pesticide use, ban toxic pesticides, establish buffer zones around schools, and establish tax breaks for organic agriculture. In 2014, while pesticide companies such as Monsanto, Syngenta, and Pioneer Hybrid International battled in court to prevent county regulation of their pesticide operations, and poured millions of dollars into local elections, Lee led his House Committee on Energy and Environmental Protection to conduct public hearings in which he questioned officials about large quantities of unreported pesticides being sprayed around the state and a lack of meaningful oversight to ensure public safety. In 2015 Lee passed a law to help farmers end their dependence on pesticides sold by large pesticide companies by creating the first tax breaks of up to $50,000 per year for organic farmers. In 2018 Lee championed legislation and helped negotiate a deal between lawmakers to overcome strong lobbying and opposition by pesticide companies, and pass a law setting a new precedent by making Hawaii the first state to ban the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos, require disclosure of pesticides being sprayed, and establish 100 foot pesticide buffer zones around all public schools. The following year California, Oregon, New York and Connecticut introduced similar legislation following the success of the ban in Hawaii. This political battle over pesticide regulation in Hawaii was the subject of a 2019 documentary \\"Poisoning Paradise\\" produced by Pierce Brosnan and directed by Keely Shaye Brosnan. = NextEra Energy Inc. = In 2014 Florida-based NextEra Energy Inc. launched a $4.3 billion bid to acquire Hawaiian Electric Industries, which includes 3 of Hawaii's major electric utilities serving over 90 percent of the state's households. After months of investigation in which it became clear NextEra Energy Inc. may pass an excessive $30 billion in costs to consumers, Lee became the first Legislator to publicly oppose the acquisition because he \\"must put the best interest of the public first.\\" Lee led the opposition amongst state legislators and county leaders and organized over 40 other elected officials from both parties to collectively announce at a press conference that better alternatives must be sought. Lee pushed legislation to stop the acquisition in the 2016 legislative session, and successfully included $1.2m in the 2016 state budget to examine alternative utility ownership and business models. He continued to coordinate elected officials and public stakeholders at public hearings and in an aggressive earned media campaign opposing the acquisition. At the announcement of the acquisition in December, 2015, public polls showed 32 percent public support for the acquisition. Despite over $20 million in utility advertising, by February, 2016 just 16 percent of the public supported the acquisition. The Public Utilities Commission subsequently rejected the acquisition in July, 2016. After the defeat of the NextEra Energy Inc. acquisition, the official study to examine alternative utility ownership and business models that better serve consumers began and is now underway. In 2017 Lee authored House Bill 1283, a first-of-its-kind bill to change the electric utilities' business model to ensure utilities better serve the interests of consumers. Known as the Hawaii Ratepayer Protection Act, it required the Public Utilities Commission to \\"directly tie electric utility revenues to a utility's achievement on performance metrics\\" such as progress toward integration of renewable energy, customer satisfaction, rate affordability, data sharing with other stakeholders, and interconnection of customer distributed generation. This changes the centralized 20th century business model in which utilities like NextEra Energy Inc automatically profit while passing growing risk and cost on to consumers, in favor of the people these utilities serve. The Hawaii Ratepayer Protection Act passed in 2018 as Senate Bill 2939 and was signed into law as Act 5. = Longline fishing industry and the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument = Overfishing and other factors have led to the depletion of fish in the Pacific Ocean. In 2016 U.S. Senator Brian Schatz proposed the expansion of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument to create the world's largest marine protected area encompassing the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and surrounding waters to ensure protection of this critical habitat. The commercial fishing industry had organized opposition to new protections for Pacific ocean habitats for some time and began organizing opposition to an expansion of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument as early as 2014. Throughout 2016 the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council and commercial fishing interests strongly opposed the expansion arguing that it would decrease their catch and profitability. Several former Hawaii Governors and a former U.S. Senator joined a rally in opposition to the expansion. The 51st House district Lee represents includes the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. In spite of the heavy industry and political opposition, Lee led grassroots efforts to coordinate environmental organizations and students from schools across the state supporting the monument expansion, testified at public hearings, and organized an earned media campaign supporting additional protections for the endangered habitat. Lee noted that expanding the monument is \\"a first step that must be taken to make sure we have this incredible valuable resource protected in perpetuity.\\" In a commentary he published in The Hill, Lee argued, \\"The claim that marine monuments kill jobs and reduce fish catch is not supported by logic or scientific data.\\" In late August, 2016, President Barack Obama signed an executive order expanding the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, making it the world's largest marine protected area. Lee joined Obama at the announcement ceremony.  Policy achievements  = Renewable energy and climate change = Lee actively promotes renewable energy and addressing climate change. In 2014 he authored the Hawaii Climate Adaptation Initiative, which established the State of Hawaii's framework to address climate change. When utilities were accused of blocking homeowners from installing their own rooftop solar panels, Lee convened oversight hearings and passed Act 109, directing the utility to allow customers to install more rooftop solar panels. In 2015, Lee authored Act 97, which made Hawaii the first state to require all utilities to sell 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. Also that year he authored Act 38, which directs the state to eliminate all fossil fuels for ground transportation. Lee also authored laws in 2015 and 2016 directing all public schools and university campuses to become energy net-zero and generate 100 percent their own renewable power by 2035,and another law creating a green special fund to help the university pay for these upgrades. Responding to President Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement in 2017, Lee co- authored Act 32, expanding the Hawaii Climate Adaptation Initiative to include meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, and authored Act 33, establishing a task force to implement carbon sequestration in the state. Building on the consumer savings seen as a result of Hawaii's tripling of renewable energy between 2007 and 2017, Lee also passed a resolution calling on the federal government and other states to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy. Lee also authored House Bill 1283, a first-of-its-kind bill to change electric utilities' business models to ensure they better serve the interests of consumers. Known as the Hawaii Ratepayer Protection Act, it required the Public Utilities Commission to \\"directly tie electric utility revenues to a utility's achievement on performance metrics\\" such as progress toward integration of renewable energy, customer satisfaction, rate affordability, data sharing with other stakeholders, and interconnection of customer distributed generation. This changes the centralized 20th century business model in which utilities like NextEra automatically profit while passing growing risk and cost on to consumers, in favor of the people which these utilities serve. The Hawaii Ratepayer Protection Act passed in 2018 as Senate Bill 2939 and was signed into law as Act 5. In 2018, Lee authored and passed Act 15, which made Hawaii the first state legally committing to a zero- emissions clean economy and statewide carbon neutrality by 2045. He also authored Act 17, which ensures all projects prepare for sea level rise by requiring all environmental impact statements to consider its implications. Since 2015, Lee has worked with policymakers and organized local advocates in other states to help spread policies committing states and cities to 100 percent clean energy and carbon neutrality. Such policies have since been adopted by states such as California, New Mexico, Washington, and New York, among others. = Equal rights and LGBT issues = Lee has been a strong and consistent advocate on LGBT issues \\"because all citizens deserve the same benefits and protections of the Constitution,\\" according to his website. He was a strong supporter and spoke out as a newly elected freshman legislator when passing legislation legalizing civil unions in 2009 and 2011. In 2013 while serving in the State Legislature Lee also served as spokesperson for the Hawaii United for Marriage campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in Hawaii. In the midst of the campaign leading up to a legislative special session to decide the issue, Lee received a death threat for his role frequently advocating for same-sex marriage in the media. At the close of a contentious special session in October 2013, the Hawaii legislature passed the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act of 2013. On November 12, Lee delivered remarks on behalf of the House of Representatives at a ceremony in which Governor Neil Abercrombie signed the bill into law, making Hawaii the 15th state to legalize same-sex marriage. \\"It is never the wrong time to do the right thing,\\" Lee noted in his speech. In 2015, Lee authored Act 226 allowing transgender individuals to change their birth certificates to reflect their gender identities as recommended by the American Medical Association. In 2016 he authored Act 135 barring health insurance companies from discriminating against transgender individuals by unfairly denying them medical coverage. = Money in politics and elections = The US Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC has allowed billions of dollars of money to flow through superPACs and influence decision makers, according to Lee. In 2009, his first year in office, Lee successfully authored an amendment to House Bill 2003. The amendment prohibited state contractors from making political contributions, helping to prevent what many call a \\"pay-to-play\\" culture which exists in politics in many places. In 2013, Lee authored Act 112 which created a new law requiring superPACs to disclose their top donors in all elections advertising. In 2014, he authored Act 128, which made voter fraud a felony, preventing fraudulent elections advertising which has been used for voter suppression by misdirecting voters to the wrong polling sites or vote on the wrong day. Lee has also been a strong supporter of improving publicly funded elections to ensure all candidates equal voice, and reduce the influence of money in elections, and has supported calls to overturn the Citizens United v. FEC decision. = Other legislation = Lee has also passed legislation making Hawaii the first state to commit to ensuring basic financial security for all families and begin exploring a guaranteed income for all residents. He passed laws establishing the nation's first tax credits for organic farming. Lee co-authored the first law banning the toxic pesticide chlorpyrifos, and the first law banning toxic chemicals in sunscreens. In November 2017, Lee, along with Rep. Sean Quinlan, became the first elected officials in the United States to raise concerns about predatory online gaming practices involving loot boxes encouraging minors to gamble after the Star Wars Battlefront II monetization controversy.

It is an extremely rare cause of pleural effusion. It is secondary to obstructive uropathy whereby urine forms a collection in the pleural cavity. The urine arrives in the pleural space either retroperitoneally (under the peritoneum) under the posterior diaphragm, or via the retro peritoneal lymphatics. It remains a rare, possibly under-diagnosed, differential in the case of transitive pleural effusion. Respiratory symptoms are usually mild. Handa et al., described 47 cases between 1967 and 2007, noting that it was more prevalent in males, generally ipsilateral (on the same side of) to the obstruction, and in most of the cases it is relieved by clearance of the obstruction.  Symptoms  The defining characteristics of people affected by urinothorax are poorly defined. Symptoms include difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, chest pain, and reduced urination.  Causes  It is either caused by an obstruction (obstructive uropathy), caused by trauma, or iatrogenic. Traumatic cases tend to occur on one side, while obstructive cases tend to be bilateral.  Diagnosis  The pleural fluid is most often straw-colored, and it has a distinct smell like ammonia. Primary factors for diagnosing urinothorax include low protein and high LDH content. Low glucose levels and acidity are also described, but not reliable ways to diagnose or rule out urinothorax. The most important chemical diagnostic factor of the fluid is that the ratio of creatinine to serum is more than 1 and usually more than 10.  Treatment  Treatment mainly consists of relieving urinary obstruction if it is present. If respiratory symptoms are minimal or nonexistent, thoracentesis may not be needed, as urinothoraces can resolve on their own in some cases after resolution of the underlying condition.

(formerly Cosmogia, Inc.) is an American private Earth imaging company based in San Francisco, California. Their goal is to image the entirety of the Earth daily to monitor changes and pinpoint trends. The company designs and manufactures Triple-CubeSat miniature satellites called Doves that are then delivered into orbit as secondary payloads on other rocket launch missions. Each Dove is equipped with a high-powered telescope and camera programmed to capture different swaths of Earth. Each Dove Earth observation satellite continuously scans Earth, sending data once it passes over a ground station. This is accomplished through a technique called a line scan, which allows for continuous, high resolution imagery due to the fact that this type of camera is not restricted to specific vertical resolution. The images gathered by Doves, which can be accessed online and some of which is available under an open data access policy, provide up-to-date information relevant to climate monitoring, crop yield prediction, urban planning, and disaster response. With acquisition of BlackBridge in July 2015, Planet Labs had 87 Dove and 5 RapidEye satellites launched into orbit. In 2017, Planet launched an additional 88 Dove satellites, and Google sold its subsidiary Terra Bella and its SkySat satellite constellation to Planet Labs. By September 2018 the company had launched nearly 300 satellites, 150 of which are active.

However, due to a failure during the second stage burn, the payloads failed to reach orbit.  RapidEye  RapidEye was a five-satellite constellation producing resolution imagery that Planet acquired from the German company BlackBridge. The satellites were built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL) of Guildford, subcontracted by MacDonald Dettwiler (MDA) of Richmond, Canada. Each satellite was based on an evolution of the flight-proven SSTL-150 bus, measuring less than and weighing (bus + payload) each. They were launched on 29 August 2008 on a Dnepr rocket from Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Each of RapidEye's five satellites contained identical Jena-Optronik Spaceborne Scanner JSS 56 multi-spectral pushbroom sensor imagers. The five satellites traveled on the same orbital plane (at an altitude of 630 km), and together were capable of collecting over of resolution, 5-band color imagery every day. They collected data in the Blue (440-510 nm), Green (520-590 nm), Red (630-690 nm), Red-Edge (690-730 nm) and Near-Infrared (760-880 nm). The RapidEye constellation was officially retired in April 2020.  SkySat  SkySat is a constellation of sub-metre resolution Earth observation satellites that provide imagery, high-definition video and analytics services. Planet acquired the satellites with their purchase of Terra Bella (formerly Skybox Imaging), a Mountain View, California-based company founded in 2009 by Dan Berkenstock, Julian Mann, John Fenwick, and Ching-Yu Hu, from Google in 2017. The SkySat satellites are based on the CubeSat concept, using inexpensive automotive grade electronics and fast commercially available processors, but scaled up to approximately the size of a minifridge. The satellites are approximately long, compared to approximately for a 3U CubeSat, and weigh . The first SkySat satellite, SkySat-1, was launched on a Dnepr (rocket) from Yasny, Russia on 21 November 2013, and the second, SkySat-2, launched on a Soyuz-2/Fregat rocket from Baikonur, Kazakhstan on 8 July 2014. Four more SkySat units were launched on 16 September 2016, by the Vega rocket's seventh flight from Kourou, and six more SkySat satellites, along with four Dove CubeSats, were launched on a Minotaur-C rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 31 October 2017. SkySat 1 is orbiting at an altitude of and has a multispectral, panchromatic, and video sensor. It has a spatial resolution of 0.9 metres in its 400‚Äì900 nm panchromatic band, making it the smallest satellite to be put in orbit capable of such high resolution imagery. The multispectral sensor collects data in blue (450‚Äì515 nm), green (515‚Äì595 nm), red (605‚Äì695 nm), and near-infrared (740‚Äì900 nm) bands, all at 2 metre resolution.

Livingstone took up the post on 17 May 1981, and remained in office until the GLC was abolished on 1 April 1986. Becoming leader of the GLC: 1979‚Äì1981 Inspired by the Bennites, Livingstone planned a GLC take-over; on 18 October 1979, he called a meeting of Labour leftists entitled \\"Taking over the GLC\\", beginning publication of monthly newsletter, the London Labour Briefing. Focused on increasing leftist power in the London Labour Party, he urged socialists to stand as candidates in the upcoming GLC election. When the time came to choose who would lead London Labour in that election, Livingstone put his name down, but was challenged by the moderate Andrew McIntosh; in the 28 April 1980 vote, McIntosh beat Livingstone by 14 votes to 13.Livingstone 1987. pp. 90, 92‚Äì94, 107‚Äì113.Hosken 2008. pp. 72‚Äì77. In September 1980, Livingstone separated from his wife Christine; they remained amicable, holidaying in the Far East together. Moving into a small flat at 195 Randolph Avenue, Maida Vale with his pet reptiles and amphibians, he divorced in October 1982 and began a relationship with Kate Allen, chair of Camden Council Women's Committee.Carvel 1984. pp. 87, 91, 105.Hosken 2008. pp. 96, 98.

Supporting leftist candidates across London, Cutler and the Conservatives learned of Livingstone's plans, proclaiming that a GLC Labour victory would lead to a takeover of London by \\"Marxists and extremists\\". The rightist press picked up the story, with the Daily Express using the headline of \\"Why We Must Stop These Red Wreckers\\", in which Cutler warned of a potential communist takeover of Britain.Carvel 1984. p. 10.Livingstone 1987. pp. 133‚Äì136.Hosken 2008. p. 84. Such scaremongering was ineffective, and the GLC election on 6 May 1981 proved a victory for Labour, with McIntosh installed as Head of the GLC; within 24 hours he would be deposed by members of his own party, replaced by Livingstone.Carvel 1984. p. 15.Livingstone 1987. p. 137. On 7 May, Livingstone called a caucus of his supporters; announcing his intent to challenge McIntosh's leadership, he invited those assembled to stand for other GLC posts. The meeting ended at 4:45pm having agreed on a full slate of candidates. At 5 o'clock, McIntosh held a GLC Labour meeting; the attendees called an immediate leadership election, in which Livingstone defeated him by 30 votes to 20. The entire left caucus slate was then elected. The next day, a leftist coup deposed Sir Ashley Bramall on the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA), replacing him with Bryn Davies; the left group now controlled both the GLC and the ILEA.Carvel 1984. pp. 16‚Äì18.Livingstone 1987. pp. 138‚Äì140.Hosken 2008. pp. 88‚Äì91.

The mainstream right-wing press criticised the coup; the Daily Mail called Livingstone a \\"left wing extremist\\", and The Sun nicknamed him \\"Red Ken\\", stating his victory meant \\"full-steam-ahead red-blooded Socialism for London.\\" The Financial Times issued a \\"warning\\" that leftists could use such tactics to take control of the government, when \\"the erosion of our democracy will surely begin.\\"Carvel 1984. pp. 18‚Äì20.Hosken 2008. p. 95. Thatcher joined the rallying call, proclaiming that leftists like Livingstone had \\"no time for parliamentary democracy\\", but were plotting \\"To impose upon this nation a tyranny which the peoples of Eastern Europe yearn to cast aside.\\"Carvel 1984. p. 19.Hosken 2008. pp. 94‚Äì95. Leader of the GLC: 1981‚Äì1983 Entering County Hall as GLC leader on 8 May 1981, Livingstone initiated changes; he converted the building's Fremasonic temple into a meeting room, removed many of the GLC members and senior officers' privileges by phasing out the use of chauffeurs, removing the annual international holiday and unsuccessfully attempting to stop the supply of free alcohol.Livingstone 1987. pp. 144‚Äì145.Hosken 2008. pp. 91‚Äì92. He initiated an open-door policy allowing citizens to enter County Hall to raise issues or hold meetings in the committee rooms free of charge. County Hall gained the nickname of \\"the People's Palace\\"; Livingstone took great pleasure watching the disgust expressed by some Conservative GLC members when non-members began using the building's restaurant.Livingstone 1987. p. 151.Hosken 2008. p. 100. In the London Labour Briefing, Livingstone announced \\"London's ours! After the most vicious GLC election of all time, the Labour Party has won a working majority on a radical socialist programme.\\" He stated that their job was to \\"sustain a holding operation until such time as the Tory [Conservative] government can be brought down and replaced by a left-wing Labour government.\\"Carvel 1984. p. 86.Hosken 2008. p. 92. There was a perception among Livingstone's allies that they constituted the genuine opposition to Thatcher's government, with Foot's Labour leadership dismissed as ineffectual; they hoped Benn would soon replace him.Hosken 2008. pp. 100‚Äì101. There was a widespread public perception that Livingstone's GLC leadership was illegitimate, while the mainstream British media remained resolutely hostile to the hard left.Hosken 2008. pp. 94‚Äì96, 98. Livingstone received the levels of national press attention normally reserved for senior Members of Parliament.Carvel 1984. pp. 13‚Äì14. A press interview was arranged with the Max Hastings for the Evening Standard, in which Livingstone was portrayed as affable but ruthless and \\"lacking in humanity.\\"Hosken 2008. pp. 96‚Äì97. Kelvin MacKenzie, editor for The Sun, took a particular interest in Livingstone, establishing a reporting team to \\"dig up the dirt\\" on him; they were unable to uncover any scandalous information, focusing on his love of amphibians, a personality trait mocked by other media sources.Carvel 1984. p. 88.Hosken 2008. p. 98.Turner 2010. p. 80. The satirical journal Private Eye referred to him as \\"Ken Leninspart\\" after Vladimir Lenin,Hosken 2008. p. 110. proceeding to erroneously claim that Livingstone received funding from the Libyan Jamahiriya; suing them for libel, in November 1983 the journal apologised, giving Livingstone ¬£15,000 in damages in an out-of-court settlement.Carvel 1984. pp. 184‚Äì185.Hosken 2008. pp. 137‚Äì138. During 1982, Livingstone made new appointments to the GLC governance, with John McDonnell appointed key chair of finance and Valerie Wise chair of the new Women's Committee, while Sir Ashley Bramall became GLC chairman and Tony McBrearty was appointed chair of housing. Others stayed in their former positions, including Dave Wetzel as transport chair and Mike Ward as chair of industry; thus was created what biographer John Carvel described as \\"the second Livingstone administration\\", leading to a \\"more calm and supportive environment\\".Carvel 1984. pp. 149, 195. Turning his attention once more to Parliament, Livingstone attempted to get selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency of Brent East, a place which he felt an \\"affinity\\" for and where several friends lived. At the time, the Brent East Labour Party was in strife as competing factions battled for control, with Livingstone attempting to gain the support of both the hard and soft left. Securing a significant level of support from local party members, he nonetheless failed to apply for candidacy in time, and so the incumbent centrist Reg Freeson was once more selected as Labour candidate for Brent East. A subsequent vote at the council meeting revealed that 52 local Labour members would have voted for Livingstone, with only 2 for Freeson and 3 abstentions. Nevertheless, in the 1983 United Kingdom general election, Freeson went on to win the Brent East constituency for Labour.Carvel 1984. pp. 166‚Äì175.Hosken 2008. pp. 174‚Äì181. In 1983, Livingstone began co-presenting a late night television chat show with Janet Street-Porter for London Weekend Television.Carvel 1984. p. 199. Fares Fair and transport policy The Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, although written under McIntosh's leadership, had been determined by a special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The manifesto focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned.Carvel 1984. p. 83-4.Hosken 2008. p. 101. One of the primary manifesto focuses had been a pledge known as Fares Fair, which focused on reducing London Underground fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1975, it was widely considered to be a moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London rates.Carvel 1984. pp. 115‚Äì118. The legality of the Fares Fair policy was challenged by Dennis Barkway, Conservative leader of the London Borough of Bromley council, who complained that his constituents were having to pay for cheaper fares on the London Underground when it didn't operate in their borough. Although the Divisional Court initially found in favour of the GLC, Bromley Borough took the issue to a court of appeal, where three judges ‚Äì Lord Denning, Lord Justice Oliver and Lord Justice Watkins ‚Äì reversed the previous decision, finding in favour of Bromley Borough on 10 November. They proclaimed that the Fares Fair policy was illegal because the GLC was expressly forbidden from choosing to run London Transport at a deficit, even if this was in the perceived interest of Londoners.Carvel 1984. pp. 128‚Äì133.Hosken 2008. pp. 117‚Äì118. The GLC appealed this decision, taking the case to the House of Lords; on 17 December five Law Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Bromley Borough Council, putting a permanent end to the Fares Fair policy.Carvel 1984. pp. 135‚Äì136. GLC transport chairman Dave Wetzel labelled the judges \\"Vandals in Ermine\\" while Livingstone maintained his belief that the judicial decision was politically motivated.Carvel 1984. pp. 137‚Äì138. Initially presenting a motion to the GLC Labour groups that they refuse to comply with the judicial decision and continue with the policy regardless, but was out-voted by 32-22; many commentators claimed that Livingstone had only been bluffing in order to save face among the Labour Left.Carvel 1984. pp. 140‚Äì143. Instead, Livingstone got on board with a campaign known as \\"Keep Fares Fair\\" in order to bring about a change in the law that would make the Fares Fair policy legal; an alternate movement, \\"Can't Pay, Won't Pay\\", accused Livingstone of being a sell-out and insisted that the GLC proceed with its policies regardless of their legality.Carvel 1984. pp. 148‚Äì150. One aspect of the London Transport reforms was however maintained; the new system of flat fares within ticket zones, and the inter-modal Travelcard ticket continues as the basis of the ticketing system. The GLC then put together new measures in the hope to reduce London Transport fares by a more modest amount, 25%, taking them back to roughly the price that they were when Livingstone's administration took office; it was ruled legal in January 1983, and subsequently implemented.Carvel 1984. pp. 203‚Äì204. GLEB and nuclear disarmament Livingstone and Mike Cooley https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/apr/06/londonmayor.uk founded the Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB) to create employment by investing in the industrial regeneration of London, with the funds provided by the council, its workers' pension fund and the financial markets. Livingstone and Cooley later claimed that GLC bureaucrats obstructed much of what GLEB tried to achieve.Carvel 1984. p. 126.Livingstone 1987. pp. 148‚Äì149. Other policies implemented by the Labour Left also foundered. Attempts to prevent the sale- off of GLC council housing largely failed, in part due to the strong opposition from the Conservative government.Carvel 1984. pp. 124‚Äì126. ILEA attempted to carry through with its promise to cut the price of school meals in the capital from 35p to 25p, but was forced to abandon its plans following legal advice that the councillors could be made to pay the surcharge and disqualified from public office.Carvel 1984. p. 124. The Livingstone administration took a strong stance on the issue of nuclear disarmament, proclaiming London a \\"nuclear-free zone\\". On 20 May 1981, the GLC halted its annual spending of ¬£1 million on nuclear war defence plans, with Livingstone's deputy, Illtyd Hamilton, proclaiming that \\"we are challenging... the absurd cosmetic approach to Armaggedon.\\" They published the names of the 3000 politicians and administrators who had been earmarked for survival in underground bunkers in the event of a nuclear strike on London. Thatcher's government remained highly critical of these moves, putting out a propaganda campaign explaining their argument for the necessity of Britain's nuclear deterrent to counter the Soviet Union.Hosken 2008. pp. 152‚Äì155. Socialist policies A socialist, Livingstone's administration advocated measures to improve the lives of disadvantaged minorities within London, including women, the disabled, homosexuals and ethnic minorities, who together made up a sizeable percentage of the city's population; what Reg Race called \\"the Rainbow Coalition\\". The GLC allocated a small percentage of its expenditure on funding minority community groups, including the London Gay Teenage Group, English Collective of Prostitutes, Women Against Rape, Lesbian Line, A Woman's Place and Rights of Women.Hosken 2008. pp. 142‚Äì145. Believing these groups could initiate social change, the GLC increased its annual funding of voluntary organisations from ¬£6 million in 1980 to ¬£50 million in 1984.Hosken 2008. pp. 148. They provided loans, most notably to the Sheba Feminist Publishers, coming under a barrage of press criticism, who claimed the press' works were pornographic.Hosken 2008. pp. 142‚Äì143. In July 1981, Livingstone founded three groups; the Ethnic Minorities Committee, an organisation with a budget of ¬£2.9 million, the Police Committee, and the Gay and Lesbian Working Party. 11 months later, in June 1982, a Women's Committee was established. Believing the Metropolitan Police to be a racist organisation, he appointed Paul Boateng to head the Police Committee. Considering the police a highly political organisation, he publicly remarked that \\"When you canvas police flats at election time, you find that they are either Conservatives who think of Thatcher as a bit of a pinko or they are National Front.\\"Turner 2010. p. 90. The Conservatives and mainstream rightist press were largely critical of these measures, considering them symptomatic of what they derogatorily termed the \\"loony left\\". Claiming that these only served \\"fringe\\" interests, their criticisms often exhibited racist, homophobic and sexist sentiment.Hosken 2008. pp. 142‚Äì148. A number of journalists fabricated stories designed to discredit Livingstone and the \\"loony left\\" in the eyes of the electorate, for instance claiming that the GLC made its workers drink only Nicaraguan coffee in solidarity with the country's socialist Sandinista government, and that Haringey Council leader Bernie Grant had banned the use of the term \\"black bin liner\\" and the rhyme \\"Baa Baa Black Sheep\\" because they were perceived as racially insensitive.Hosken 2008. pp. 145‚Äì146.Turner 2010. p. 155. Writing in 2008, BBC reporter Andrew Hosken noted that although most of the Livingstone GLC administration's policies were ultimately a failure, its role in helping to change social attitudes towards women and minorities in London remained its \\"enduring legacy\\".Hosken 2008. p. 156. =Scandal: Republicanism and Ireland= Invited to the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer at St Paul's Cathedral on 29 July 1981, Livingstone ‚Äì a republican critical of the monarchy ‚Äì wished the couple well but turned down the offer, remarking that he intended \\"to pull back from ceremonial functions in order to concentrate on the work for which the group had been elected.\\" The refusal was leaked to the press, who were further enraged when he permitted Irish republican protesters from the H-Block Armagh Committee to hold a 48-hour vigil and fast on the steps of County Hall throughout the wedding celebrations, during which they launched 100 black balloons over the city.Carvel 1984. pp. 90‚Äì91.Livingstone 1987. pp. 145‚Äì146.Hosken 2008. p. 99.Turner 2010. p. 78. His administration supported the People's March for Jobs, a demonstration of 500 protestors against unemployment who marched to London from Liverpool, Llanelli and Huddersfield, allowing those involved to sleep in County Hall for two nights in May and catering for them. Costing ¬£19,000, critics argued that Livingstone's regime was illegally using public money for their own political causes.Livingstone 1987. pp. 151‚Äì152.Hosken 2008. pp. 99‚Äì100. The GLC orchestrated a propaganda campaign against Thatcher's government, in January 1982 erecting a sign on the top of County Hall ‚Äì a building clearly visible from the Houses of Parliament ‚Äì stating the number of unemployed in London. Initially set at 326,238, it was updated every month as a reminder of the high levels of unemployment in Thatcher's Britain.Carvel 1984. p. 153.Turner 2010. p. 86. Later that year, he caused further press controversy when he stated that to a certain extent, \\"everyone is bisexual\\", at the Harrow Gay Unity Group on 18 August.Carvel 1984. pp. 91‚Äì92.Hosken 2008. p. 147. Becoming estranged from the publishers of the London Labour Briefing, in September 1981, Livingstone began production of weekly newspaper, the Labour Herald, co-edited with Ted Knight and Matthew Warburton. The Labour Herald was published by Astmoor Litho Ltd, a press owned by a Trotskyist organisation known as the Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP), who had financed it with funding from the Arab socialist governments of Libya and Iraq. Livingstone became an ally of the WRP's leader, Gerry Healy, a controversial move among British socialists, many of whom disapproved of Healy's violent nature and criminal past; Livingstone maintained that he had \\"a straightforward commercial relationship\\" with Healy and that he published through the WRP because they offered the cheapest rate.Carvel 1984. pp. 182‚Äì184Hosken 2008. pp. 126‚Äì135. In 1985, the WRP ousted Healy as their leader after he was exposed as a sexual predator; the Labour Herald subsequently folded.Hosken 2008. p. 139. A supporter of Irish reunification, Livingstone had connections with the left-wing Irish republican party Sinn F√©in and on 21 July, met with Mrs Alice McElwee, the mother of an imprisoned member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), Thomas McElwee, then taking part in the 1981 Irish hunger strike. Mrs McElwee had originally been invited to speak to the London Labour group on the situation of the hunger strikers by GLC councillor Andy Harris, a member of the Labour Committee on Ireland, and Livingstone took the time to privately meet with her. That same day, Livingstone publicly proclaimed his support for those prisoners on hunger strike, claiming that the British government's fight against the IRA was not \\"some sort of campaign against terrorism\\" but was in fact \\"the last colonial war.\\" He was heavily criticised for this meeting and his statements in the mainstream press, while Prime Minister Thatcher claimed that his comments constituted \\"the most disgraceful statement I have ever heard.\\"Carvel 1984. pp. 88‚Äì90, 100.Hosken 2008. pp. 103‚Äì104. He would soon after meet with the three sons of Yvonne Dunlop, an Irish Protestant who had been killed in McElwee's bomb attack, on their visit to London.Hosken 2008. pp. 104‚Äì105. On 10 October, the IRA bombed London's Chelsea Barracks, killing 2 and injuring 40, including 23 soldiers. Denouncing the attack, Livingstone informed members of the Cambridge University Tory Reform Group that it was a misunderstanding to view the IRA as \\"criminals or lunatics\\" because of their strong political motives and that \\"violence will recur again and again as long as we are in Ireland.\\" The mainstream press criticising him for these comments, The Sun labeling him \\"the most odious man in Britain\\". In response, Livingstone held a press conference, proclaiming that the press coverage had been \\"ill-founded, utterly out of context and distorted\\", reiterating his opposition both to the IRA's attacks and to British rule in Northern Ireland.Carvel 1984. pp. 95‚Äì97.Hosken 2008. pp. 158‚Äì159. Anti-Livingstone pressure mounted and on 15 October he was publicly attacked in the street, being sprayed with red aerosol paint by members of The Friends of Ulster. In a second incident, Livingstone was attacked by far right skinheads shouting \\"commie bastard\\" at the Three Horseshoes Pub in Hampstead.Carvel 1984. p. 98.Hosken 2008. p. 159. Known as \\"Green Ken\\" among Ulster Unionists, Unionist paramilitary Michael Stone of the Ulster Defence Association plotted to kill Livingstone, only abandoning the plan when he became convinced that the security services were onto him.Hosken 2008. p. 161.Matthew Tempest, \\"Loyalists planned to kill Livingstone\\", The Guardian, 10 June 2003\\"My plot to murder Livingstone, by former hitman \\" thisislondon.co.uk, 1 November 2006 Livingstone's willingness to meet with Irish republican leader Gerry Adams (above, pictured in 2001), caused outrage within his own party and the British press. Livingstone agreed to meet Gerry Adams, Sinn F√©in President and IRA-supporter, after Adams was invited to London by Labour members of the Troops Out campaign in December 1982. The same day as the invitation was made, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) bombed The Droppin Well bar in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, killing 11 soldiers and 6 civilians; in the aftermath, Livingstone was pressured to cancel the meeting. Expressing his horror at the bombing, Livingstone insisted that the meeting proceed, for Adams had no connection with the INLA, but Conservative Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw banned Adams' entry to Britain with the 1976 Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act.Carvel 1984. pp. 157‚Äì159.Hosken 2008. pp. 165‚Äì168. On 26 and 27 February 1983, Livingstone visited Adams in his constituency of West Belfast in Northern Ireland, receiving a hero's welcome from the local republican community.Carvel 1984. p. 160.Hosken 2008. p. 169. In July 1983, Adams finally came to London on the invitation of Livingstone and MP Jeremy Corbyn, allowing him to present his views to a mainstream British audience through televised interviews.Carvel 1984. p. 161. On 26 August, Livingstone was interviewed on Irish state radio, proclaiming that Britain's 800-year occupation of Ireland was more destructive than the Holocaust; he was publicly criticised by Labour members and the press. Courting further controversy, during the Falklands War of 1982, during which the United Kingdom battled Argentina for control of the Falkland Islands, Livingstone stated his belief that the islands rightfully belonged to the Argentinian people, but not the military junta then ruling the country.Carvel 1984. p. 156. Upon British victory, he sarcastically remarked that \\"Britain had finally been able to beat the hell out of a country smaller, weaker and even worse governed than we were.\\"Turner 2010. p. 113. Challenging the Conservative government's militarism, the GLC proclaimed 1983 to be \\"Peace Year\\", solidifying ties with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in order to advocate international nuclear disarmament, a measure opposed by the Thatcher government.Hosken 2008. p. 155. In keeping with this pacifistic outlook, they banned the Territorial Army from marching past County Hall that year.Hosken 2008. pp. 168‚Äì169. The GLC then proclaimed 1984 to be \\"Anti-Racism Year\\".Hosken 2008. p. 151. In July 1985, the GLC twinned London with the Nicaraguan city of Managua, then under the control of the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front. The press also continued to criticise the Livingstone administration's funding of volunteer groups that they perceived represented only \\"fringe interests\\". As Livingstone biographer Andrew Hosken remarked, \\"by far the most contentious grant\\" was given in February 1983 to a group called Babies Against the Bomb, founded by a group of mothers who had united to campaign against nuclear weapons.Carvel 1984. p. 207. Members of the London Labour groups chastised Livingstone for his controversial statements, believing them detrimental to the party, leading Labour members and supporters to defect to the Social Democratic Party (SDP).Carvel 1984. pp. 93‚Äì95. Many highlighted Labour's failure to secure the seat in the 1981 Croydon North West by-election as a sign of Labour's prospects under Livingstone.Hosken 2008. pp. 162‚Äì163. Some called for Livingstone's removal, but Michael Foot's Trotskyist assistant Una Cooze defended Livingstone's position to her boss.Hosken 2008. p. 109. Television and radio outlets welcomed Livingstone on for interviews; described by biographer John Carvel as having \\"one of the best television styles of any contemporary politician\\", Livingstone used this medium to speak to a wider audience, gaining widespread public support, something Carvell attributed to his \\"directness, self-deprecation, colourful language, complete unflappability under fire and lack of pomposity\\", coupled with genuinely popular policies such as Fares Fair.Carvel 1984. p. 102. Abolition of the GLC: 1983‚Äì1986 The 1983 general election proved disastrous for Labour. Obtaining their worst results since the Second World War, much of their support went to the Social Democrat-Liberal Alliance, while Thatcher entered her second term in office. Accepting this loss, Foot stepped down to be succeeded by Neil Kinnock, a man Livingstone considered \\"repellent\\".Hosken 2008. pp. 191‚Äì193. Livingstone publicly asserted that Labour's electoral failure was due to the leading role that the party's capitalist right wing had played under Foot's leadership. In order to gain the support of the nation's working class, he argued, the party had to promote a socialist program of \\"national reconstruction\\", overseeing the nationalisation of banks and major industry and allowing for the investment in new development.Carvel 1984. pp. 219‚Äì223. Considering it a waste of rate payer's money, the Conservative government was keen to abolish the GLC and devolve control to the Greater London boroughs, stating its intention to do so in its 1983 electoral manifesto.Carvel 1984. pp. 199‚Äì200.Hosken 2008. pp. 195‚Äì199. Secretary of State for Employment Norman Tebbit, lambasted the GLC as \\"Labour-dominated, high-spending and at odds with the government's view of the world\\"; Livingstone commented that there was \\"a huge gulf between the cultural values of the GLC Labour group and everything that Mrs Thatcher considered right and proper.\\"Turner 2010. p. 171. The government felt confident that there was sufficient opposition to Livingstone's GLC administration that they could abolish the entire body: according to a MORI poll undertaken for the Evening Standard in April 1983, 58% of Londoners were dissatisfied with Livingstone, compared with 26% satisfied with him.Hosken 2008. p. 197. Attempting to fight the proposals, the GLC devoted ¬£11 million to a three-pronged campaign led by Reg Race focusing on press campaigning, advertising and parliamentary lobbying. The campaign sent Livingstone on a ¬£845,000 party roadshow conference, in which he successfully convinced the Liberal and Social Democratic parties to oppose abolition. Using the slogan \\"say no to no say\\", the GLC team publicly highlighted that if the Conservative's proposals were passed, London would be the only capital city in Western Europe without a directly elected body.Carvel 1984. pp. 213‚Äì218.Hosken 2008. pp. 198‚Äì202. The GLC campaign proved successful, with polls indicating majority support among Londoners for retaining the Council, and on 29 March 1984, 20,000 public servants held a 24-hour strike in support.Hosken 2008. p. 202. The government nevertheless remained committed to the cause of abolition. In order to become law, the bill had to have three readings in each of the Houses of Parliament, and could have been defeated if it was voted down in any of the six readings. The third and final readings took place on 28 June 1984, passing the Local Government Act 1985 with 237 votes in favour and 217 against.Hosken 2008. pp. 202‚Äì204. The GLC was formally abolished at midnight on 31 March 1986.

It is located near Onna Village (ÊÅ©Á¥çÊùë Onna-son, Okinawan: Unna) in the Kunigami District of Okinawa Prefecture. Cape Manzamo is one of the most popular places among both Japanese and international travelers who visit Okinawa Island. Location Cape Manzamo is located on the Western side of Okinawa Island (), facing the East China Sea. It is accessed most easily from Onna Village, which is served by public transportation buses travelling between Naha and Nago. Origin of the name When visiting Cape Manzamo, 18th Century Ryukyuan king Sho Kei is said to have noted that the top of the cliff was big enough for 10,000 people to sit. The kanji characters of the Japanese written form of Manzamo reflect the king's expression: ‰∏á (Man - 10,000) Â∫ß (Za - to sit) ÊØõ (Mo - field). The third syllable \\"mo\\" is pronounced long, therefore Manzamo is sometimes transliterated as Manzamou (or alternately Manzam≈ç, with the ≈ç denoting the long vowel). Another English translation of the name is Cape Manza. Popularity Due to its location, Cape Manzamo is facing the open East China Sea to the West. This makes it a very popular spot on Okinawa for viewing the sunset, and for taking photos of the cliff from its side facing Onna Village. At low tide, at the bottom of the rock formation which constitutes the picturesque cliff, tidal pools are formed. Directly on the sea-facing side of these pools, there is a popular scuba-diving spot known as The Toilet Bowl.

The object of the game is to move cards to the foundations to create a gallery full of picture or face cards.\\"Royal Parade\\" (p.239-40) in The Complete Book of Card Games by Peter Arnold, Hamlyn Publishing, 2010. Rules Royal Parade has 24 foundations total. There are three rows with eight foundations each. The top row of foundations all start with twos, and build up in suit by threes, e.g. 2‚ô£, 5‚ô£, 8‚ô£, J‚ô£. The next row's foundations all start with threes, and build up in suit by threes, e.g. 3‚ô•, 6‚ô•, 9‚ô•, Q‚ô• The last row's foundations all start with fours, and build up in suit by threes, e.g. 4‚ô†, 7‚ô†, 10‚ô†, K‚ô†. Underneath the 24 foundations are eight tableau piles, and no building is allowed. An Ace Pile or Castoff Pile is also present, due to the fact that there is no need for Aces in this game. When new cards are needed, an entire row of eight cards is dealt from the stock to the tableau. Seeing how there is no need for Aces in Royal Parade, all Aces are discarded to the Ace Pile (Castoff Pile). This will create some openings in the foundations, creating the availability to move cards around. Only twos can be placed onto the first row's openings, threes onto the second row's openings, and fours onto the last row's openings. The game is won after the foundations are completely filled with \\"Picture\\" cards (face cards). Virginia Reel Albert H. Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith created Virginia Reel as an improvement on Royal Parade. Among other differences, in Virginia Reel a gap left behind in the gallery has to be filled before new cards can be dealt.

He also played for St Mirren in the Scottish League, for Portsmouth and Ebbw Vale in the Southern League, and in non-League football for Jarrow. Life and career Dowling was born in 1890 in Jarrow, County Durham, the son of Arthur Patrick Dowling, a merchant seaman, and his wife Catherine n√©e Dowey. He attended St Bede's Catholic School in the town and played for St Bede's F.C. Dowling moved on to Jarrow Croft, from where he joined Scottish First Division club St Mirren in September 1909. He played mainly at outside right, but also appeared in other forward positions, scored four goals from 16 appearances in all competitions, and St Mirren were keen to retain his services at the end of the season, but he chose to return to England. He signed for The Wednesday in May 1910, and made his English Football League debut on 17 September away to Preston North End in place of Sam Kirkman. Despite his early goal being disallowed for fouling an opponent, his team won 3‚Äì1. He played in the next three matches, once at outside right and twice at centre forward, and a further three in the second half of the season, all in the First Division. When Wednesday's scout, Robert Brown, left to become secretary-manager of Portsmouth, newly relegated to the Second Division of the Southern League and struggling financially, Dowling and another young forward, Frank Stringfellow, went along. The pseudonymous \\"Athleo\\" of the Sheffield Sports Special \\"[could] not understand Dowling being allowed to go\\", and later described him as \\"a good worker with a sensible habit of popping frequently at goal.\\" Dowling helped Portsmouth finish as runners-up in his first season, and remained with the club for a further season at the higher level, before returning to his native north-east where he signed for Jarrow, an amalgamation of the former Jarrow Croft and Jarrow Caledonians clubs. After one season in the North-Eastern League, Dowling returned to the Football League with Lincoln City. He made 14 appearances in the Second Division, and scored his first Football League goal, on 17 April 1915 in a 2‚Äì1 defeat away to Bristol City. His ability to play in any forward position made him valuable cover for Jack Manning, Arthur Wolstenholme or Frank Pattison, and he earned himself a reputation as \\"a dashing and assertive forward\\", but he was never a first choice in the side. Dowling returned to Jarrow during the First World War where he worked in the shipyards. He married Julia Pearson in 1915, but the marriage was not a success. In 1919, she summoned him for desertion. According to her evidence, she had left him more than once because he mistreated her, and after he joined the Navy in 1918 he had stopped paying her allowance. The court ruled that there was no desertion, and made no order against Dowling. After demobilisation he rejoined Lincoln City, and made a further 14 appearances during the first post-war season, at the end of which Lincoln finished 21st and failed to be re-elected. Dowling moved on to Ebbw Vale, scored freely as they won the Southern League Welsh Section in 1921‚Äì22 and the overall Southern League title the following year, his record including four goals \\"in about ten minutes\\" as Ebbw Vale beat Abertillery 9‚Äì0 in March 1923, and was still playing for them in the 1924‚Äì25 season. The 1939 Register finds Dowling living in Kilnhurst, Yorkshire, and working as a colliery fitter. His death at the age of 79 was registered in the Rother Valley district of Yorkshire in the last quarter of 1969.
